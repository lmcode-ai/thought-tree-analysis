In the original Java program, if min==0, then the loop will try to compute modulus by zero and crash. How should we handle? The original program does not handle min==0. So we must assume that the input does not contain 0? Or that if min==0, then the condition fails? Actually, the condition: every element must be divisible by min. If min==0, then the only way is if every element is 0? But then modulus by zero is undefined. We must mimic the Java behavior: the original program crashes on min==0. But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we should crash? But Fortran doesn't have exceptions. We can check for min==0 and then set res = -1? But the original program crashes. Alternatively, we can let the Fortran program crash when trying to compute mod(a(i), min) when min==0? That would be the same behavior.",

So the absolute value of the integer is at most 10 digits? So 20 is safe. Let's test with a small example: Input to the first program: \n          3\n          2 4 6\n\n      Then:\n          sorted: [2,4,6]\n          min=2\n          2%2=0 -> ok, 4%2=0 -> ok, 6%2=0 -> ok -> res=2. Then buffer = '2' (with I0, the buffer will be \"2\" and then 19 spaces? But we take the first character: '2' -> next_char = '3'\n\n      Output: '3'\n\n      But the original chain: \n          First program outputs \"2\\n\", then the second program reads \"2\" (without the newline) and then outputs the next character of '2' which is '3'. So output is '3'. Matches. Another example: Input: \n              3\n              3 6 7\n\n          sorted: [3,6,7]\n          min=3\n          3%3=0, 6%3=0, 7%3=1 -> not zero -> res=-1. Then buffer = '-1' -> first character is '-' -> next_char is '.'.\n\n      Output: '.' So it matches. But note: the modulus operation for negative min_val? Example: Input: \n              3\n              -6 3 9\n\n          sorted: [-6, 3, 9] -> min_val=-6\n\n          Check: \n            mod(-6, -6) = 0 -> ok\n            mod(3, -6) = 3? But in Fortran: mod(3, -6) = 3 (because 3 = 0*(-6) + 3) -> remainder 3 -> not zero -> so set res=-1. Then output the next character of '-' is '.'. In Java: \n          3 % (-6) = 3 -> non-zero -> so output -1. So matches. Therefore, we write the program as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (codeforces_299_A):\n  - Reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers.\n  - Sorts the array.\n  - Checks if every element is divisible by the smallest element (the first after sorting).\n  - If yes, prints the smallest element; otherwise, prints -1.\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a string and prints the next character (the character that is one greater in the ASCII value) of the first character.\n\nHowever, note that the second program uses a BufferedReader and reads a whole line, but then only uses the first character.\n\nThe requirement:\n  - The entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program.\n  - Only the first block (which will be the first program) should read input.\n  - Only the last block (which will be the second program) should produce output.\n  - Intermediate steps without I/O.\n\nBut note: the first program produces an output (either the smallest element or -1) and then terminates. The second program reads a string and outputs a character.\n\nHow to chain?\n  The output of the first program becomes the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string (a line of text) and then outputs a character.\n\nHowever, the first program outputs an integer (or -1). The second program expects a string. We must consider the data flow.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the output of the first program (an integer or -1) is passed as input to the second program? But the second program is reading a string and then taking the first character.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let's reexamine:\n\nThe two programs are independent. The first program reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. The second program reads a string and outputs a character.\n\nBut the problem states: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the output of the first program (which is either a positive integer or -1) is the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string. How is that connected?\n\nIn a typical Unix pipeline, we might do:\n  $ java FirstProgram | java SecondProgram\n\nThe output of FirstProgram (a number) is passed as a string to SecondProgram.\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read the string \"5\", and then output the next character after '5', which is '6'.\n\nBut note: if the first program outputs \"-1\", then the second program reads the string \"-1\", and then takes the first character which is '-' and then outputs the next character which is '.' (since '-' has ASCII 45, then 45+1=46 which is '.').\n\nSo the plan for the Fortran program:\n\n1. We must combine both operations without intermediate I/O.\n\nSteps:\n\nStep 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer `n` and then `n` integers). This is the only reading from standard input.\n\nStep 2: Process the first program: sort the array, check divisibility. Instead of printing, we store the result (either the minimum value or -1) as an integer.\n\nStep 3: Then we pass that integer to the second program. But the second program expects a string? Actually, we have to convert that integer to a string because the second program reads a string.\n\nStep 4: The second program then takes the first character of that string and outputs the next character.\n\nHowever, note: the second program only reads one line. And the integer we have is going to be the entire string? But the integer might be negative? So we have to convert the integer to a string.\n\nBut the second program only uses the first character. So even if the integer has multiple digits (or a negative sign), we only use the first character.\n\nSo:\n\n  If the first program yields 5, then the string is \"5\", first character is '5', then output '6'.\n\n  If the first program yields -1, then the string is \"-1\", first character is '-', then output the next character which is '.'.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the integer without any extra spaces. So we have to format the integer as a string without any extra spaces.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the integer n and the array of n integers.\n\n  Step 2: Process the array: sort and check. Let the result be an integer variable, say `res`.\n\n  Step 3: Convert `res` to a string. We'll use an internal write.\n\n  Step 4: Take the first character of that string, compute the next character (by getting its ASCII and adding 1, then convert back to character).\n\n  Step 5: Output only that character (without any extra newlines? The second Java program uses `printf` without a newline. But Fortran by default adds a newline? We have to use non-advancing I/O? Actually, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The second program outputs a single character and then the program ends. In Fortran, if we do a `print *, char` we get the character and a newline. But the original second program does not output a newline.\n\n  However, the second Java program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not append a newline. So we must output without a newline? But in a terminal, the output might be without a newline and then the shell prompt comes next. But the requirement is to behave identically.\n\n  How to output without a newline in Fortran? We can use:\n\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are allowed to output only at the end.\n\n  However, the entire output of the combined program is the single character? Then we output that character and then we are done.\n\n  But the original first program might output a number with a newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println` which appends a newline. But in the chain, that newline is part of the input to the second program? Or not?\n\n  Let's clarify the chain:\n\n    First program: \n        If condition fails: outputs \"-1\" (without newline? Actually, println adds newline) -> so it outputs \"-1\\n\".\n        If condition passes: outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\n    Then the second program: \n        It uses BufferedReader.readLine() -> which reads a line (so the entire line including the newline? Actually, readLine() discards the newline). So the string `s` in the second program is the string without the newline.\n\n    Therefore, the newline from the first program is consumed by the readLine() and not part of the string.\n\n    So the second program only gets the digits and possibly a minus sign.\n\n    Then the second program outputs a single character (without newline).\n\n    Therefore, the combined output of the entire chain is the first program's output (with newline) being passed to the second program, but the second program only outputs a single character without newline? Actually, the first program's output is not directly output by the combined program. Only the second program's output is.\n\n    So the combined program's output is a single character without a newline.\n\n  However, the problem says: the entire sequence. The input to the combined program is the same as the input to the first program. The output of the combined program is the same as the output of the last program.\n\n  Therefore, the combined Fortran program:\n\n      Input: same as the first program: first an integer n, then n integers.\n\n      Output: a single character (without newline).\n\n  But wait: the first program might output a newline? That is not part of the output of the combined program because it is only the intermediate step. The second program reads the entire line (which includes the number as a string without the newline) and then outputs a character without a newline.\n\n  So the final output is a single character without a newline.\n\n  However, if we run the combined program in a terminal, the shell prompt will appear right after the character. That is acceptable.\n\n  Steps in Fortran:\n\n    1. Read n and the array (from standard input).\n    2. Process the array to compute the result (an integer, either the minimum or -1).\n    3. Convert the integer to a string (without any leading/trailing spaces and without a newline). We'll remove any trailing spaces? Actually, we want the entire integer representation. We can use an internal file to write the integer to a string, then trim? But note: the integer might be negative.\n\n    4. Take the first character of that string.\n\n    5. Convert that character to its ASCII value, add 1, and then convert back to a character.\n\n    6. Write that character to standard output without a newline.\n\n  How to convert integer to string in Fortran:\n\n      character(len=20) :: buffer\n      integer :: res\n      write(buffer, *) res   ! This will write with leading spaces for positive, and for negative it will have a minus and then digits.\n      But then we have to remove leading spaces? Because the first non-blank character might be the minus or the first digit.\n\n      Actually, we want the entire integer without any extra spaces? But the second program only takes the first character. However, the string we form must be the same as what would be passed in the pipeline: the integer as a string of digits (with a minus if negative) without any leading spaces (except that in Fortran, the write with * will have leading spaces for positive numbers?).\n\n      Example: \n          res = 5 -> buffer will be \"           5\" (with 11 spaces and then 5? because 20 characters). We don't want the spaces? Because in the pipeline, the output of the first program would be \"5\" (without the spaces) and then the newline.\n\n      How to remove the leading spaces? We can use `adjustl` to left adjust, but note that negative numbers: \n          res = -1 -> buffer will be \"          -1\", then after adjustl it becomes \"-1          \".\n\n      But we only need the first character. So we can do:\n\n          str = adjustl(buffer)   ! This moves the significant part to the left, but then we have trailing spaces? We don't care because we only take the first character.\n\n      Then we take the first character of the left-adjusted string.\n\n      However, what if the integer is 0? Then the string is \"0\", and the first character is '0'.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Read n and the array.\n\n      Step 2: Sort the array and then:\n\n          min = a(1)   ! after sorting\n\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (mod(a(i), min) /= 0) then\n                 res = -1\n                 exit\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          If we didn't set res to -1, then res = min.\n\n      But note: what if min is 0? Then mod(a(i), min) is undefined? The original Java program: if min is 0 then we get an ArithmeticException: division by zero. But in Fortran, mod by zero is undefined and will cause an error.\n\n      The original Java program does:\n\n          if (value % min != 0) \n\n      If min is 0, then we get an exception. But the problem says: the array of integers. The integers are from the input. We must consider the possibility of min=0.\n\n      How does Java sort? The array can have negative numbers? The problem doesn't specify. But note: the modulus in Java for negative numbers: the sign of the result is the same as the dividend? But the condition is (value % min != 0). If min is 0, it crashes.\n\n      We must avoid that. The original program does:\n\n          int min = a[0];   // after sorting, so the smallest element\n\n          Then for each value: if (value % min != 0) -> then output -1.\n\n          But if min is 0, then we get division by zero. So we must check for min==0.\n\n      Actually, the problem states: the array of integers. The integers can be negative? The modulus operation in Java for negative numbers: \n\n          Example: (-5) % 3 -> -2, but (-5) % (-3) -> -2? \n\n      However, the condition is: if (value % min != 0). If min is negative, then the modulus might be negative? But the condition is just non-zero.\n\n      But if min is negative, then we can use absolute value? Actually, the condition is about divisibility: we want to check if value is divisible by min. But note: if min is negative, then value % min might be negative? But we only care about being non-zero.\n\n      However, the problem is: if min==0, then we have to avoid the modulus. In the original Java program, if min==0, then the loop will try to compute modulus by zero and crash.\n\n      How should we handle? The original program does not handle min==0. So we must assume that the input does not contain 0? Or that if min==0, then the condition fails? Actually, the condition: every element must be divisible by min. If min==0, then the only way is if every element is 0? But then modulus by zero is undefined.\n\n      We must mimic the Java behavior: the original program crashes on min==0. But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we should crash? But Fortran doesn't have exceptions. We can check for min==0 and then set res = -1? But the original program crashes.\n\n      Alternatively, we can let the Fortran program crash when trying to compute mod(a(i), min) when min==0? That would be the same behavior.\n\n      However, the problem says: the array of integers. The integers can be negative? And zero? The problem does not specify. Since the original program does not handle zero, we assume that the test inputs do not contain zeros? Or that if they do, we are allowed to crash.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we should crash. However, in the problem statement, we are to translate the entire sequence. We are not to change the behavior.\n\n      But the second program might not run if the first program crashes? Actually, in a pipeline, if the first program crashes, the second program doesn't run? But in our combined program, we have to run the entire chain? \n\n      Actually, the first program in the chain might crash. Then the combined program should crash at that point? But the problem says: the entire sequence. So if the first program crashes, we don't run the second.\n\n      How to handle:\n\n          We read the array, sort.\n\n          If min==0, then we try to do the modulus and we get a division by zero? In Fortran, the MOD function for integer arguments: if the second argument is 0, the result is undefined? Actually, the standard says it is processor dependent. We cannot rely on that.\n\n      We can avoid the modulus if min==0? Then we check: if min==0, then we must check if every element is 0? Because 0 is divisible by 0? But mathematically, that is undefined. In Java, it throws an exception.\n\n      So we should throw an error? But we cannot throw in Fortran. We can output an error message and stop? But the original program throws an exception and then terminates without outputting the second program.\n\n      How about: if min==0, then we set res = -1? But that is not the behavior of the original program.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if (min == 0) then\n              do i = 1, n\n                  if (a(i) /= 0) then\n                      res = -1\n                      exit\n                  end if\n              end do\n              ! if we get to the end of the loop, then all are zero -> but then what? \n              ! The condition: every element divisible by min? min=0 -> undefined. So we set res = -1? \n              ! But the original program would crash. So we cannot do that.\n\n      Actually, the original program crashes at the first modulus when min==0. So we can simulate that by doing:\n\n          if (min == 0) then\n              ! We have to cause a division by zero.\n              ! We can compute mod(1,0) to crash? But Fortran standard says it is undefined. Some compilers might catch and throw an error.\n\n      Since the problem does not specify the behavior for min==0, and the original program crashes, we can let the Fortran program crash by attempting mod(1,0). But we cannot rely on the compiler to crash? We can do:\n\n          if (min == 0) then\n              ! Force a division by zero: we can do 1 / 0? That is also undefined.\n\n      Alternatively, we can just set res = -1 and proceed? But that is not the same.\n\n      Considering the problem: the test inputs might not have min==0. So we do as the original program: if min==0, then when we try to compute mod(a(i), min) we get a crash.\n\n      We will write the program without a special check for min==0. Then if min==0, the program crashes at the mod operation.\n\n      Step 3: Format the integer to a string:\n\n          We'll write the integer to a character buffer, then left-adjust to remove leading spaces.\n\n          Example: \n              buffer = ''\n              write(buffer, '(I0)') res   ! The I0 format writes without leading spaces? But note: I0 is for minimal width.\n\n          However, for negative numbers, it will write with a minus sign.\n\n          But we only need the first character. So we can do:\n\n              character(len=:), allocatable :: str\n              character(len=20) :: buffer\n              integer :: length\n\n              write(buffer, '(I0)') res   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces? But the buffer is 20 characters. We might get trailing spaces? Actually, we are writing to a fixed-length buffer. Then we can take the entire written part? But we only need the first character.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n              write(buffer, *) res   ! list-directed write: it will write with spaces? Then we adjustl.\n\n          Then:\n\n              str = trim(adjustl(buffer))   ! This gives a string without leading or trailing spaces? But we only need the first character.\n\n          Then:\n\n              c = str(1:1)\n\n      Step 4: Compute the next character: \n\n          We can use the IACHAR and ACHAR functions:\n\n          next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n      Step 5: Output next_char without a newline.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain only outputs one character. So we output that character and then exit.\n\n  However, the first program might output -1 and then the second program outputs '.' (the next character after '-'). But the original first program outputs the integer and then a newline? But that newline is consumed by the readLine() of the second program? So the second program does not see the newline. Therefore, the string we pass to the second step must not include the newline? Because we are not writing the newline in the intermediate step.\n\n  So in our combined program, we are not writing the newline at all. We are only passing the integer as a string (without newline) to the second step? But wait: in the first program, we are not actually printing the integer and the newline. We are storing the integer and then converting to string without newline.\n\n  That is consistent: the second program in the chain reads the entire line (which is the string representation of the integer without the newline). So we don't need to include the newline.\n\n  Therefore, the steps are:\n\n      Step 1: Read n and the array.\n\n      Step 2: Sort the array.\n\n      Step 3: \n          min_val = a(1)\n          if (min_val == 0) then\n              ! This will cause a crash in the modulus below? We don't handle, so we proceed to the modulus and let it crash.\n          end if\n          res = min_val   ! by default\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n                 res = -1\n                 exit\n             end if\n          end do\n\n      Step 4: Convert the integer `res` to a string without leading spaces and without newline.\n\n      Step 5: Take the first character of that string.\n\n      Step 6: Compute the next character.\n\n      Step 7: Output that next character without a newline.\n\n  But note: the second program only uses the first character. So even if the integer has more than one digit, we only use the first character.\n\n  Example: \n      If the first program outputs 10, then the string is \"10\", the first character is '1', then the next character is '2'.\n\n      If the first program outputs -1, then the string is \"-1\", the first character is '-', then the next character is '.'.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Implementation in Fortran:\n\n      We need to sort the array. We can use a simple sort (like bubble sort) or use an intrinsic? Fortran has an intrinsic `sort`? Actually, Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort for arrays. We have to write one? Or we can use a simple one.\n\n      We'll use a simple selection sort or bubble sort? Since the array size is not specified, but the problem is from competitive programming, n is probably small.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the `minloc` repeatedly? But that is inefficient.\n\n      We'll use a simple bubble sort.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          integer, dimension(100) :: a   ! We don't know the maximum n? But we read n. We can allocate? Or use a large enough size.\n\n          But the problem: the first program reads n, so we can use:\n\n          integer :: n\n          integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n          read(*,*) n\n          allocate(a(n))\n\n          Then read the array.\n\n      Sorting:\n\n          do i = 1, n-1\n             do j = i+1, n\n                if (a(i) > a(j)) then\n                    temp = a(i)\n                    a(i) = a(j)\n                    a(j) = temp\n                end if\n             end do\n          end do\n\n      But note: the original Java uses Arrays.sort which is a stable sort? But we don't care about stability for integers.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers? In Fortran, the MOD function: \n\n        MOD(A, P) = A - INT(A/P)*P   [for P/=0]\n\n        The sign of the result is the same as the sign of A.\n\n        Example: mod(5, 3) = 2, mod(5, -3) = 2? Actually, no: the standard says the result has the same sign as A.\n\n        mod(5, 3) = 2\n        mod(5, -3) = 2   ? But wait: 5 = (-1)*(-3) + 2 -> so remainder 2? \n        mod(-5, 3) = -2\n        mod(-5, -3) = -2\n\n        But the condition in the original Java: (value % min) != 0.\n\n        In Java, the sign of the modulus result: same as the dividend? Actually, yes.\n\n        So in Fortran, the MOD function for integers behaves the same as Java's % for integers? \n\n        Therefore, we can use MOD.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i, j, temp, min_val, res, ios\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n        character(len=20) :: buffer\n        character :: c, next_char\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(a(n))\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a(i)\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 2: Sort the array\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            do j = i+1, n\n                if (a(i) > a(j)) then\n                    temp = a(i)\n                    a(i) = a(j)\n                    a(j) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 3: Check divisibility\n        min_val = a(1)\n        res = min_val   ! by default\n        do i = 1, n\n            ! If min_val is zero, then mod will crash -> we don't handle.\n            if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n                res = -1\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Step 4: Convert res to string without spaces\n        write(buffer, '(I0)') res   ! I0: minimal width without spaces\n        ! But note: the I0 format writes without leading spaces? Yes.\n\n        ! Step 5: Take the first character of buffer? But buffer is 20 characters. We only care about the first non-space? Actually, the I0 format writes without leading spaces. So the first character of buffer is the first character of the number.\n\n        ! However, if the number is negative, the first character is '-'. If positive, it's a digit.\n\n        c = buffer(1:1)\n\n        ! Step 6: Compute the next character\n        next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n        ! Step 7: Output without newline\n        write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n        deallocate(a)\n      end program\n\n  But note: what if the integer `res` is too big for the buffer? The buffer is 20 characters. The integer range in Fortran: typically large enough? The problem doesn't specify. We assume 20 is enough.\n\n  However, we can make the buffer large enough: say 50.\n\n  Also, the original first program uses int (32-bit). So the absolute value of the integer is at most 10 digits? So 20 is safe.\n\n  Let's test with a small example:\n\n      Input to the first program: \n          3\n          2 4 6\n\n      Then:\n          sorted: [2,4,6]\n          min=2\n          2%2=0 -> ok, 4%2=0 -> ok, 6%2=0 -> ok -> res=2.\n\n      Then buffer = '2' (with I0, the buffer will be \"2\" and then 19 spaces? But we take the first character: '2' -> next_char = '3'\n\n      Output: '3'\n\n      But the original chain: \n          First program outputs \"2\\n\", then the second program reads \"2\" (without the newline) and then outputs the next character of '2' which is '3'. So output is '3'. Matches.\n\n      Another example:\n\n          Input: \n              3\n              3 6 7\n\n          sorted: [3,6,7]\n          min=3\n          3%3=0, 6%3=0, 7%3=1 -> not zero -> res=-1.\n\n          Then buffer = '-1' -> first character is '-' -> next_char is '.'.\n\n      Output: '.'\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  But note: the modulus operation for negative min_val? \n\n      Example: \n          Input: \n              3\n              -6 3 9\n\n          sorted: [-6, 3, 9] -> min_val=-6\n\n          Check: \n            mod(-6, -6) = 0 -> ok\n            mod(3, -6) = 3? But in Fortran: mod(3, -6) = 3 (because 3 = 0*(-6) + 3) -> remainder 3 -> not zero -> so set res=-1.\n\n          Then output the next character of '-' is '.'.\n\n      In Java: \n          3 % (-6) = 3 -> non-zero -> so output -1.\n\n      So matches.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n  One more note: the second program in the chain (the Java) only reads the first character of the entire line? What if the first program outputs multiple lines? \n\n      But the first program outputs only one integer and a newline. So the entire output is one line.\n\n      The second program uses readLine() -> so it reads the entire line (without the newline) and then we take the first character of that string.\n\n      In our Fortran, we are converting the integer to a string that is the same as what the first program would output? But without the newline. And then we take the first character.\n\n      So it's the same.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: We must use the I0 format for the integer to avoid spaces.\n\n  However, what if the integer is positive? The I0 format writes without any leading space. So the first character is the first digit.\n\n  For negative, it writes the minus sign and then the digits. The first character is the minus.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Code:"
