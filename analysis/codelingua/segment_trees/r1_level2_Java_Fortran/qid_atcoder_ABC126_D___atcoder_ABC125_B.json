Steps for DFS: We have an array `colors` of size n, initialized to -1 (meaning unvisited). We start at node0 with initial length=0. We set colors(0) = 0 (if length mod2==0, then 0; else 1). Then for each neighbor of node0, we push (neighbor, current_length + edge_weight) to the stack. Then pop and process.

So when stack_top=1, we assign stack(1)=0 -> that's valid. Then when we push more, we assign stack(2)=v (if stack_top=2) -> that is also valid (index 2 is within 0 to n-1? Actually, n-1 is the last index. If n=3, then indices are 0,1,2. So we can only go up to stack_top = n? But n might be 3 -> then stack(3) would be index 3? which is out of bounds. Therefore, we should allocate the stack to have at least n elements. Since we have n nodes, we can push at most n nodes. We can allocate stack(1:n) and then use indices 1..n? But then we lose 0. Alternatively, allocate stack(0:n-1) and then use indices 0..n-1.

But the arrays: \n   degree(0:n-1)\n   graph(0:n-1)\n   colors(0:n-1)\n   c_arr(0:n-1)\n\nThis is consistent. We can test with the example: n=3, edges: (0,1,2) and (1,2,1), c_arr=[1,2,3]\n\n  Then colors(0)=0, colors(1)=mod(0+mod(2,2)=0, then for node1: we push node0 (visited) and node2. Then pop node1, then push node2: \n             node2: from node1: w=1 -> mod(1,2)=1 -> colors(2)=mod(0+1,2)=1. Then total = (0-1) + (0-2) + (1-3) = -1-2-2 = -5 -> then we take only positive? none. total=0. Print 0. But note: the DFS from node0: We start by pushing node0. Then pop node0 -> then we push its unvisited neighbors: only node1 (because node0 has one edge to node1? and node1 is unvisited). Then pop node1 -> then we push its unvisited neighbors: node2. Then pop node2. So the stack: \n        push0: stack=[0], top=1. pop0: then push1: stack=[1], top=1.\n        pop1: then push2: stack=[2], top=1. pop2: then no more. This is correct. However, in the graph building, note that the edge (0,1) is stored in both node0 and node1. When we are at node0, we see neighbor node1 (unvisited) -> we push it. Then when we are at node1, we see neighbors: node0 (visited) and node2 (unvisited). So we push node2. But the graph for node0: \n   degree(0)=1 -> only neighbor node1.\n\n  for node1: \n   degree(1)=2 -> neighbors: node0 and node2.\n\n  for node2: degree(2)=1 -> neighbor node1. This is correct. But note: in the edge list, we stored for each edge twice. So the graph is built correctly. One more: the edge (1,2) is stored at node1 and node2. We are using the entire input: first the graph, then the c array. But what if the input has more? The problem says the entire input for the first program and then the input for the second program?",

Output: 0.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be run in sequence. However, note that the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But the first program (atcoder_ABC126_D) produces multiple lines of output (each line is an integer), and the second program (atcoder_ABC125_B) expects two lines of input: the first line is an integer `n`, and the next two lines are space separated integers.\n\nBut wait, let's see the structure:\n\nFirst program (ABC126_D):\n  Input: \n    First integer `n`\n    Then `n-1` lines, each with three integers: u, v, w\n\n  Output: `n` integers (each on a new line)\n\nSecond program (ABC125_B):\n  Input:\n    First line: integer `n`\n    Second line: space separated integers (n numbers) for `v`\n    Third line: space separated integers (n numbers) for `c`\n\n  Output: a single integer (the maximum profit)\n\nHowever, the output of the first program is exactly `n` integers (each on a new line). The second program expects:\n  - First line: `n`\n  - Second line: `v0 v1 ... v_{n-1}`\n  - Third line: `c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}`\n\nSo we cannot directly chain the output of the first program to the second. This indicates that the problem might be misrepresented? But note the instruction: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire set of programs is to be run as a chain? The first program takes the initial input and produces an output that is then the input to the second.\n\nBut the first program produces `n` lines (each line an integer), and the second program expects three lines. We have to convert the output of the first program into the input format of the second.\n\nLooking at the second program, the first line is the integer `n`. Then the next two lines are `n` space separated integers.\n\nSo the output of the first program is `n` integers (each on a new line). We can convert that to:\n  Line 1: the integer `n` (which we already know from the first program, but note the second program reads it again)\n  Line 2: the entire list of `n` integers from the first program, space separated? But wait, the second program expects two arrays: one for `v` and one for `c`. \n\nHowever, the second program uses the same `n` and then two arrays. The problem does not specify how the output of the first program is transformed to become the input of the second. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nWe have to mimic the chain. The chain would be:\n\n  Input for the first program: \n      n\n      then n-1 lines (each with u, v, w)\n\n  Output of first program: n integers (each per line) -> let's call this array `colors` of size n.\n\n  Then the second program is run with:\n      First input: n (same n)\n      Second input: an array of n integers (for v) -> but the first program output is `colors`. \n      Third input: an array of n integers (for c) -> but we don't have this.\n\nWait, there is a disconnect. The second program requires two arrays: `v` and `c`. However, the first program only produces one array (the colors). How can we use the output of the first program as the input to the second? \n\nLooking at the original problem statement, it says the programs are meant to be executed in sequence with the output of the first as the input to the second. But in the provided Java code, the second program does not take the output of the first. It reads from `System.in` again.\n\nThis suggests that the two programs are independent and the problem might have intended that we run the two programs independently? But the instruction says \"entire sequence\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example provided is two separate problems? And we are to run them in sequence? But the input to the second program is not the output of the first.\n\nThis is confusing. However, note that the problem says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nBut the second program does not use the output of the first. It reads its own input. So how can we chain them?\n\nAfter re-examining, I see that the first program produces `n` integers (each on a new line). The second program expects:\n  First line: n\n  Second line: n integers (space separated) for `v`\n  Third line: n integers (space separated) for `c`\n\nBut we don't have the `c` array from the first program. So it seems the chain is broken.\n\nI suspect that the problem intended to provide two separate programs that are to be run independently? But the instruction says \"entire sequence\". Alternatively, perhaps the two programs are meant to be run on the same initial input? But that doesn't make sense because the input formats are different.\n\nWait, the first program's input:\n  n\n  then n-1 lines of edges\n\nThe second program's input:\n  n\n  then one line of n integers (v)\n  then one line of n integers (c)\n\nSo they are different. Therefore, the chain must be that the output of the first program is the input to the second? But the second program requires two arrays and we only have one.\n\nUnless the problem is that the entire output of the first program (which is n lines) becomes the input to the second program? The second program would then read:\n\n  Line1: n (the first integer of the first program's output? but the first program outputs the colors, and the first line is the color for node0, which is 0 or 1, not n)\n\nThis does not match.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think there might be a mistake in the problem description. However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nBut note: the two Java programs are independent. They are two different problems. The first is ABC126_D and the second is ABC125_B. They are not chained by data.\n\nBut the problem says \"meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nUnless the example provided is actually two separate chains? But the problem says \"a set of Java programs\", and then two are given.\n\nI think the only logical way is to run the first program, then use its output (the `n` integers) as the array for `v` in the second program? But then what about `c`? The second program requires two arrays.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that we run the first program and then the second program on the same initial input? But the second program does not use the graph structure.\n\nAfter careful thought, I notice that the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program should read the input for the first program, then process both the first and the second program's logic without intermediate I/O, and then output the result of the second program.\n\nBut what is the input for the entire program? It must be the input for the first program. And then the second program must use the output of the first as part of its input? But the second program requires additional input (the array `c`).\n\nThis is not specified. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the entire input to the Fortran program is the input for the first program. Then, the second program must run on the output of the first program and some additional data? But we don't have the additional data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are independent and the problem meant to say that we are to run two separate programs on the same initial input? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem intended to show two examples of chains? But the instruction says \"entire sequence\" and we are to translate the entire set.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the problem. However, to proceed, I will assume that the entire input to the Fortran program is:\n\n  The input for the first program (which is n and then n-1 edges) AND then the input for the second program (which is the two arrays for `v` and `c`)? But that would be two separate inputs.\n\nBut the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", meaning the first program's output becomes the second program's input. Therefore, the entire Fortran program should:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the edges).\n  Step 2: Run the first program's logic to produce an array `colors` of size n (which is the output of the first program).\n  Step 3: Then, the second program is to be run with input:\n          n\n          the array `colors` (as the `v` array)\n          and then it needs an array `c`? \n\nBut wait, the second program reads two arrays: `v` and `c`. However, we don't have `c` from anywhere. So unless `c` is provided in the initial input after the graph? \n\nThe initial input would then be:\n\n  n\n  then n-1 edges (each edge: u, v, w)\n  then two lines:\n        one line for the `c` array? \n\nBut the first program only reads n and n-1 edges. The second program reads n and then two lines (v and c). \n\nSo the entire input would be:\n\n  Line 1: n (for the graph)\n  Next n-1 lines: edges (each: u, v, w)\n  Then: a line with n integers for the array `c`? \n\nBut then the second program would use:\n   n (the same n) \n   v = the `colors` array from the first program\n   c = the additional array read after the graph\n\nAnd then compute the profit.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The first program produces `colors`. That becomes the `v` array for the second program. And then we need an additional array `c` which must be read from the input after the graph.\n\nTherefore, the entire input to the Fortran program is:\n\n  n\n  n-1 edges\n  one line of n integers for `c`\n\nAnd then the program does:\n\n  Step 1: Build the graph and run the DFS to compute `colors` (for the first program).\n  Step 2: Use `colors` as `v` and the next line as `c` to compute the profit (second program).\n\nThen output the profit (a single integer).\n\nThis seems to be the only way to chain them.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n1. Read integer `n`\n2. Read `n-1` edges (each edge: three integers: u, v, w). Note: in the first program, the vertices are 0-indexed and the input subtracts 1 to make them 0-indexed.\n3. Then read one more line: which is the `c` array (space separated integers of size `n`)\n\nThen:\n\n  Step A: Build the graph and run the DFS (from the first program) to compute the `colors` array (size n) which will be 0/1 for each node.\n\n  Step B: Now, we have:\n          v_i = colors[i]   (for i in 0..n-1)\n          c_i = the i-th integer from the last line we read.\n\n  Step C: For each i, compute profit_i = v_i - c_i. If profit_i > 0, add it to a total.\n\n  Step D: Output the total.\n\nBut note: the second program uses `vList` and `cList` as arrays of integers. And the `vList` is built from the first line after the integer `n` (which in our case is the `colors` array). And the `cList` is built from the next line (which we read as the `c` array).\n\nHowever, the second program reads an integer `n` again and then two lines. But we already have `n` and the two arrays (the `colors` array and the read `c` array). So we don't need to read again.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  - Reads `n`\n  - Reads `n-1` edges (each with u, v, w) -> note: the vertices in the edge are given as integers. We subtract 1 to make 0-indexed.\n  - Then reads a line of `n` integers for the array `c_arr`\n\n  - Builds the graph (using adjacency list) and runs DFS starting from node 0 (which is node index 0) to compute `colors` (an array of 0/1)\n\n  - Then, for i from 1 to n (0-indexed), compute:\n          profit = colors(i) - c_arr(i)\n          if profit > 0, add to total\n\n  - Print total\n\nBut note: the first program (ABC126_D) uses a class `Point` and a DFS that accumulates the path length mod 2. The DFS starts at node0 with length=0.\n\nWe need to simulate the graph and DFS in Fortran.\n\nHowever, Fortran does not have classes, so we will use arrays and structures for the graph.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  - An array to store the color of each node (initialized to -1, meaning unvisited)\n  - We'll build an adjacency list: for each node, we store a list of neighbors and the weight of the edge.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  type :: edge\n      integer :: to, weight\n  end type\n\n  Then, an array of lists (or we can use an array of arrays, but Fortran has allocatable arrays of arrays, but we can also use a 2D array? Alternatively, we can use an array of derived type that holds a variable-length list? \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the degree and then use a CSR format? \n\nBut the graph has n-1 edges (tree), so we can use:\n\n  Let's create an array `adj` of size `n` of linked lists? But Fortran doesn't have linked lists. We can use an array of arrays, but we don't know the degree in advance.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  - A 2D array with fixed maximum degree? But n can be up to 10^5? That might be inefficient.\n\nWe can use dynamic arrays for each node? But Fortran 90+ has allocatable arrays in derived types.\n\nBut note: we are going to do a DFS. We can build the graph as:\n\n  We'll create two arrays: \n      `neighbor` of size (n-1)*2? \n      `weight` of size (n-1)*2\n      and then `start` for each node: the index in the neighbor array where the neighbors of node i start.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a ragged array: an array of pointers to arrays? Not in standard Fortran.\n\nAnother way: use an allocatable array of arrays? But that is non-standard in Fortran 90/95? We can do:\n\n  type :: node\n      integer, allocatable :: neighbors(:)   ! neighbor indices\n      integer, allocatable :: weights(:)     ! weights for each edge\n  end type\n\n  type(node), allocatable :: graph(:)\n\nBut then we can do:\n\n  allocate(graph(n))\n  for each edge (u, v, w):\n      append v to graph(u)%neighbors, and w to graph(u)%weights\n      append u to graph(v)%neighbors, and w to graph(v)%weights\n\nBut appending to an allocatable array in Fortran requires reallocation and copying, which is expensive. But n is up to 10^5? We can precompute the degree? \n\nAlternatively, we can read the edges, count the degree for each node, then allocate each node's neighbor array to the degree, and then fill.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Step 1: Read n\n  Step 2: Allocate an array `degree` of size n, initialized to 0.\n          Read n-1 edges: for each edge (u, v, w) (and convert to 0-indexed by subtracting 1 for u and v)\n          increment degree(u) and degree(v)\n  Step 3: Allocate graph(n) with each graph(i)%neighbors of size degree(i) and graph(i)%weights of size degree(i), and also allocate a counter for each node (init to 0).\n  Step 4: Reread the edges? Or we can store the edges in an array and then process twice? Or we can read the edges, store in temporary arrays, and then build the graph.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire input\" is to be read at the beginning.\n\nSo:\n\n  Read n\n  Allocate edges array: edges(3, n-1)  [or three arrays: u_arr, v_arr, w_arr, of size n-1]\n  For i=1 to n-1:\n        read u, v, w\n        u_arr(i) = u-1, v_arr(i)=v-1, w_arr(i)=w\n\n  Then compute degree: \n        degree = 0\n        do i=1, n-1\n            u = u_arr(i)\n            v = v_arr(i)\n            degree(u) = degree(u)+1\n            degree(v) = degree(v)+1\n        end do\n\n  Then allocate graph for each node: \n        do i=0, n-1\n            allocate(graph(i)%neighbors(degree(i)))\n            allocate(graph(i)%weights(degree(i)))\n        end do\n\n  Then, create a counter array (count_deg) of size n, initialized to 0.\n        do i=1, n-1\n            u = u_arr(i)\n            v = v_arr(i)\n            w = w_arr(i)\n            graph(u)%neighbors(count_deg(u)+1) = v   ! Fortran 1-indexed? Actually, we are using 0-indexed for nodes? \n            graph(u)%weights(count_deg(u)+1) = w\n            count_deg(u) = count_deg(u)+1\n\n            graph(v)%neighbors(count_deg(v)+1) = u\n            graph(v)%weights(count_deg(v)+1) = w\n            count_deg(v) = count_deg(v)+1\n        end do\n\nBut note: the DFS in the first program uses recursion. We might have to worry about recursion depth (n up to 10^5). We can use a stack for DFS.\n\nAlternatively, we can do iterative DFS to avoid recursion limits.\n\nSteps for DFS:\n\n  We have an array `colors` of size n, initialized to -1 (meaning unvisited).\n\n  We start at node0 with initial length=0.\n\n  We set colors(0) = 0 (if length mod2==0, then 0; else 1).\n\n  Then for each neighbor of node0, we push (neighbor, current_length + edge_weight) to the stack.\n\n  Then pop and process.\n\nBut note: the DFS in the first program is recursive and uses the accumulated length from the root.\n\nWe can do iterative DFS:\n\n  stack: nodes to visit, and the accumulated length so far.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      type :: stack_node\n          integer :: node_index\n          integer :: total_length\n      end type\n\n      stack: array of stack_node (we can use an array and a pointer for top)\n\n  Steps:\n\n      colors(0) = 0   [because 0 mod2 is 0]\n      push all neighbors of 0: (neighbor, weight) and then mark as visited? But we mark when we pop? \n\n      Actually, we mark when we pop? That can lead to duplicates. Instead, we mark when we push.\n\n      Algorithm:\n\n          colors(0) = 0\n          push node0 with length=0\n\n          while stack not empty:\n              pop a node u and its accumulated length L.\n              for each neighbor v of u:\n                  if colors(v) is not -1 (visited), skip.\n                  else:\n                      new_length = L + weight(u->v)\n                      if new_length mod2==0 then colors(v)=0 else colors(v)=1\n                      push (v, new_length)\n\n          However, note: in the original DFS, we passed the accumulated length from the root to the current node. Then for an edge (u->v) with weight w, we add w to get the new length.\n\n      But the original DFS started at the root and then for each edge, we add the weight. And then mod2.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note that we only care about mod2. So we can do:\n\n          new_length_mod2 = mod(L + w, 2)   but actually we don't need the entire length, just the parity.\n\n          But the original DFS does: \n              if (length % 2 == 0) then set color to 0, else 1.\n\n          Then for the next edge, we pass (length + w). But mod2: (length + w) mod2 = (length mod2 + w mod2) mod2.\n\n          And w mod2 is either 0 or 1.\n\n      So we can store the parity from the root? Actually, the entire DFS can be done with mod2 arithmetic.\n\n      We can change the state to be the parity (0 or 1) at the node.\n\n      Then the rule: \n          color(u) = (color(parent) + w mod2) mod2? \n\n      Actually: \n          Let the root has color0 (which is 0). Then for an edge from root to child with weight w: \n             if w is even -> then the length mod2 is 0 -> so child is 0.\n             if w is odd -> then the length mod2 is 1 -> so child is 1.\n\n          But then for an edge from u (which has color c_u) to v with weight w, the color of v is (c_u + (w mod2)) mod2.\n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n          colors(0) = 0\n          stack: push node0\n\n          while stack not empty:\n              pop u\n              for each neighbor v (that is not visited) of u:\n                  let w = weight of edge (u,v)\n                  colors(v) = mod(colors(u) + mod(w,2), 2)   [because mod(w,2) is 0 or 1, then mod2 sum]\n\n          But note: mod(colors(u)+mod(w,2),2) is the same as ieor(colors(u), mod(w,2))? Actually, since mod(w,2) is 0 or 1, then:\n\n             if mod(w,2)=0: then colors(v)=colors(u)\n             if mod(w,2)=1: then colors(v)=1-colors(u) ??? \n\n          Actually: \n              if colors(u)=0 and w is even: then 0+0=0 mod2 -> 0\n              if colors(u)=0 and w is odd: then 0+1=1 mod2 -> 1\n              if colors(u)=1 and w is even: then 1+0=1 mod2 -> 1\n              if colors(u)=1 and w is odd: then 1+1=2 mod2 -> 0\n\n          So it is: colors(v) = mod(colors(u) + mod(w,2), 2)\n\n          But note: mod(w,2) is either 0 or 1.\n\n      This is equivalent to: colors(v) = ieor(colors(u), mod(w,2))? \n\n          ieor(0,0)=0\n          ieor(0,1)=1\n          ieor(1,0)=1\n          ieor(1,1)=0\n\n      So yes, it's the same.\n\n      However, the original DFS used the accumulated length mod2. This method is equivalent and avoids large integers.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          colors(0) = 0\n          then for each edge from u to v with weight w, if v is unvisited, then:\n               colors(v) = ieor(colors(u), mod(w,2))\n\n      We can do BFS or DFS arbitrarily because the tree is acyclic.\n\n  We'll use a stack (or a queue) for DFS? The original used DFS (recursive) which is depth-first. But the order doesn't matter because the parity only depends on the parent.\n\n  We'll use a stack for DFS (iterative).\n\nSteps:\n\n  Initialize:\n      colors(0:n-1) = -1   (unvisited)\n      colors(0) = 0\n      stack = [0]\n\n  While stack is not empty:\n      u = pop from stack\n      for each neighbor v of u that is not visited (i.e., colors(v)==-1):\n          w = weight of edge (u,v)\n          colors(v) = ieor(colors(u), mod(w,2))\n          push v to stack\n\nAfter DFS, we have the colors array.\n\nThen, we read the next line: which is the `c_arr` of n integers.\n\nThen, we compute:\n\n      total = 0\n      do i = 0, n-1\n          profit = colors(i) - c_arr(i)   ! But wait: colors(i) is either 0 or 1, and c_arr(i) is an integer (could be any value)\n          if (profit > 0) then\n              total = total + profit\n          end if\n      end do\n\nBut note: the second program did:\n\n      for (Integer i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          Integer profit = vList.get(i) - cList.get(i);\n          if (profit > 0) {\n              max += profit;\n          }\n      }\n\nSo yes.\n\nHowever, the `colors` array we computed is of integers (0 or 1). The `c_arr` is an array of integers. The subtraction is integers.\n\nBut note: the `colors` array is 0/1, so the profit for each i is 1 - c_arr(i) or 0 - c_arr(i). Only when colors(i)=1 and c_arr(i)=0, then profit=1; if colors(i)=1 and c_arr(i)=1, then profit=0; if colors(i)=0, then profit is negative or zero? So only when colors(i)=1 and c_arr(i)=0, we get profit=1. \n\nBut wait, the second program does not assume that the `v` array is 0/1. It can be any integers? However, in our case, the `v` array is the `colors` array which is 0/1. But the second program is general: it subtracts the two arrays element-wise and adds positive profits.\n\nBut the input for the second program in the chain is: \n   n\n   the `colors` array (which is 0/1) as the `v` array\n   the `c_arr` array (which we read after the graph)\n\nSo we do as above.\n\nFinally, output total.\n\nBut note: the second program reads the integer `n` again? In our case, we already have `n` from the beginning. So we don't need to read it again for the second program.\n\nTherefore, the entire input format for the Fortran program is:\n\n  Line 1: n\n  Next n-1 lines: each has three integers: u, v, w (the edge description)\n  Next line: n integers (the array c)\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 3\n\nThis means:\n  n=3\n  edges: \n        edge1: u=1, v=2, w=2 -> convert to 0-indexed: (0,1,2) and (1,2,1) -> wait, the next edge is 2 3 1 -> becomes (1,2,1)\n  then the next line: \"1 2 3\" -> c_arr = [1,2,3]\n\nBut wait, the first program will output:\n\n   colors for node1 (index0): 0\n   node2 (index1): ? \n        from the root (node0) to node1: edge (0,1,2): mod(2,2)=0, so color1 = ieor(0,0)=0.\n        then from node0 to node2: no direct? Actually, the graph:\n\n        nodes: 0, 1, 2\n        edges: (0,1,2) and (1,2,1) [since the second edge is between node1 and node2?]\n\n        Actually, the input for the first program:\n\n          3\n          1 2 2   -> this is an edge between node0 (if we subtract 1: 1-1=0, 2-1=1) and node1? \n          2 3 1   -> becomes (2-1=1, 3-1=2) -> so edge (1,2) with weight 1.\n\n        Then the graph:\n\n          0 --2-- 1 --1-- 2\n\n        DFS from node0:\n          node0: color0=0\n          then neighbors: node1 -> edge weight=2 (mod2=0) -> color1=0\n          then from node1: neighbors: node0 (visited) and node2 -> edge weight=1 (mod2=1) -> color2 = ieor(0,1)=1.\n\n        So the output of the first program: \n            0\n            0\n            1\n\n        Then the second program uses:\n            n=3\n            v = [0,0,1]\n            c = [1,2,3]\n            profit0 = 0-1 = -1 -> skip\n            profit1 = 0-2 = -2 -> skip\n            profit2 = 1-3 = -2 -> skip\n            total=0.\n\n        Output: 0.\n\nBut the example input for the second program would be:\n\n  3\n  0 0 1\n  1 2 3\n\nBut note: the original second program reads:\n\n  n = 3\n  vStr = \"0 0 1\"\n  cStr = \"1 2 3\"\n\nSo we are consistent.\n\nTherefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n  - We'll use an iterative DFS with a stack (using an array for the stack, and a stack pointer).\n\n  - We'll represent the graph as an array of derived types, each containing an array of neighbors and an array of weights. \n\n  - Steps:\n\n        integer :: n\n        read *, n\n        integer, allocatable :: u_arr(:), v_arr(:), w_arr(:)\n        allocate(u_arr(n-1), v_arr(n-1), w_arr(n-1))\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            read *, u, v, w\n            ! convert to 0-indexed\n            u_arr(i) = u - 1\n            v_arr(i) = v - 1\n            w_arr(i) = w\n        end do\n\n        !

However, when we pop a node, we process all its neighbors. But the order of pushing and popping is LIFO. The original DFS was recursive (which is LIFO). So it's the same.\n\nBut note: the stack might be large enough (n nodes). We allocated stack(0:n-1) but then we use from 1 to n? Actually, we allocated stack(0:n-1) meaning n elements? Then we use indices from 1 to n? But we set:\n\n        stack(1) = 0, then stack_top=1.\n\n        Then when we pop, we take stack(1) and then decrement stack_top to 0 -> then the loop ends? But we haven't processed the neighbors of node0.\n\nWe need to push node0 and then process it.\n\nActually, in the loop:\n\n   We pop node0 (u=0), then we traverse its neighbors. For each unvisited neighbor, we set its color and push it.\n\nThen we pop the next node (which is the last neighbor pushed) and so on.\n\nBut the code above:\n\n        stack_top = 1\n        stack(1)=0\n        colors(0)=0\n\n        then while stack_top>0:\n            pop: u=0, stack_top becomes 0.\n            then we process u=0: loop over its neighbors (from 1 to degree(0)):\n                for each neighbor v that is unvisited: \n                    set color and push.\n\n            Then we push all unvisited neighbors of 0? \n\n        Then we set stack_top = number of unvisited neighbors, and then the next pop will be the last pushed.\n\n        That is DFS.\n\nBut note: the stack array was allocated with size n (0:n-1). But we might push up to n-1 nodes? Then the maximum stack size might be n. So we allocated stack(0:n-1) which has n elements? Actually, we allocated stack(0:n-1) meaning n elements? Then we can use indices 1 to n? But we started at index1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can allocate stack(1:n) and use stack_top as the current number of elements.\n\n        But in the allocation: \n\n          allocate(stack(0:n-1))  -> creates an array of indices from 0 to n-1, which is n elements.\n\n        Then we can use:\n\n            stack_top = 0\n            ! push: stack_top = stack_top+1; stack(stack_top)=node\n\n        Then:\n\n            push node0: stack_top=1, stack(1)=0.\n\n        Then pop: take stack(stack_top)=stack(1)=0, then stack_top=0.\n\n        Then we process node0: and then push its neighbors. Then stack_top becomes the number of neighbors.\n\n        So the code above is correct.\n\nHowever, we note that the graph is a tree (n-1 edges, connected, no cycles). So we don't have to worry about multiple edges? The problem says tree.\n\nBut the input says: n-1 edges.\n\nTherefore, the program.\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious about the indices. We are using 0-indexed for the nodes.\n\nAlso, the stack array: we allocated it as (0:n-1) but then we use indices from 1 to n? Actually, we are using stack_top as the current size, and we store the node in stack(1), stack(2), ... stack(n). But the allocation stack(0:n-1) has indices 0,1,...,n-1. So we can use stack(1) without problem? \n\nBut in Fortran, if we declare stack(0:n-1), then the valid indices are 0 to n-1. So when stack_top=1, we assign stack(1)=0 -> that's valid. Then when we push more, we assign stack(2)=v (if stack_top=2) -> that is also valid (index 2 is within 0 to n-1? Actually, n-1 is the last index. If n=3, then indices are 0,1,2. So we can only go up to stack_top = n? But n might be 3 -> then stack(3) would be index 3? which is out of bounds.\n\nTherefore, we should allocate the stack to have at least n elements. Since we have n nodes, we can push at most n nodes. We can allocate stack(1:n) and then use indices 1..n? But then we lose 0. Alternatively, allocate stack(0:n-1) and then use indices 0..n-1. Then stack_top=0 initially, and we push:\n\n      stack_top = stack_top+1\n      stack(stack_top) = node\n\nBut then the maximum stack_top is n? But the array only has indices 0..n-1 -> so we can only go to n-1? \n\nWe need an array of size n, indices 1..n? \n\nLet me allocate:\n\n      integer, allocatable :: stack(:)\n      allocate(stack(1:n))   ! indices 1 to n\n\n      stack_top = 0\n\n      push: \n          stack_top = stack_top+1\n          stack(stack_top) = node\n\n      pop:\n          node = stack(stack_top)\n          stack_top = stack_top-1\n\nThen the stack array has indices 1..n, and we never exceed n.\n\nSo we do:\n\n      allocate(stack(1:n))\n\n      stack_top = 0\n\n      ! push node0:\n          stack_top = 1\n          stack(1) = 0\n\n      then while stack_top>0: ...\n\nWe'll do that.\n\nAlso, note: the mod function in Fortran: mod(w,2) returns 0 or 1.\n\nAnd ieor: bitwise xor. But for integers, we can use:\n\n      colors(v) = mod(colors(u) + mod(w,2), 2)\n\nBut mod(colors(u)+mod(w,2), 2) is the same as ieor? Actually, for 0 and 1, it is the same as xor.\n\nBut we can do either. Let me use:\n\n      colors(v) = mod(colors(u) + mod(w, 2), 2)\n\nBut note: colors(u) is 0 or 1, mod(w,2) is 0 or 1, so the sum is 0,1, or 2. Then mod(sum,2) is 0,1,0 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      colors(v) = colors(u)  ! if mod(w,2)==0\n      colors(v) = 1 - colors(u)  ! if mod(w,2)==1\n\nBut that would require an if. The mod is simple.\n\nSo we do:\n\n      colors(v) = mod(colors(u) + mod(w,2), 2)\n\nBut note: the mod function: mod(a,2) is the remainder when a is divided by 2. It is 0 or 1.\n\nFinally, the output: we print the total.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs a single integer.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  We assume the input is from standard input.\n\n  We must declare variables.\n\n  Let's write the program.\n\n  Note: We are using Fortran. We'll use free form.\n\n  We'll use:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n\n      ! ... declarations ...\n\n      !

We allocated stack(1:n). The maximum number of nodes we push is n, so it is safe.\n\nAlso, we are using 0-indexed for the nodes: 0 to n-1.\n\nBut the arrays: \n   degree(0:n-1)\n   graph(0:n-1)\n   colors(0:n-1)\n   c_arr(0:n-1)\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nWe can test with the example: n=3, edges: (0,1,2) and (1,2,1), c_arr=[1,2,3]\n\n  Then colors(0)=0, colors(1)=mod(0+mod(2,2)=0, then for node1: we push node0 (visited) and node2. \n        Then pop node1, then push node2: \n             node2: from node1: w=1 -> mod(1,2)=1 -> colors(2)=mod(0+1,2)=1.\n\n  Then total = (0-1) + (0-2) + (1-3) = -1-2-2 = -5 -> then we take only positive? none.\n\n  total=0.\n\n  Print 0.\n\nBut note: the DFS from node0: \n   We start by pushing node0.\n   Then pop node0 -> then we push its unvisited neighbors: only node1 (because node0 has one edge to node1? and node1 is unvisited).\n   Then pop node1 -> then we push its unvisited neighbors: node2.\n   Then pop node2.\n\n  So the stack: \n        push0: stack=[0], top=1.\n        pop0: then push1: stack=[1], top=1.\n        pop1: then push2: stack=[2], top=1.\n        pop2: then no more.\n\n  This is correct.\n\nHowever, in the graph building, note that the edge (0,1) is stored in both node0 and node1. When we are at node0, we see neighbor node1 (unvisited) -> we push it. Then when we are at node1, we see neighbors: node0 (visited) and node2 (unvisited). So we push node2.\n\nBut the graph for node0: \n   degree(0)=1 -> only neighbor node1.\n\n  for node1: \n   degree(1)=2 -> neighbors: node0 and node2.\n\n  for node2: \n   degree(2)=1 -> neighbor node1.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut note: in the edge list, we stored for each edge twice. So the graph is built correctly.\n\nOne more: the edge (1,2) is stored at node1 and node2.\n\nWe are using the entire input: first the graph, then the c array.\n\nBut what if the input has more? The problem says the entire input for the first program and then the input for the second program? The second program's input is the next line (the c array). \n\nSo the entire input is:\n\n  n\n  n-1 edges (each: u, v, w)\n  then a line of n integers for c\n\nThat's it.\n\nTherefore, the program.\n\nBut note: the second program originally read an integer `n` again? In our program, we don't. We use the same `n` from the beginning.\n\nThis is consistent with the chain: the first program outputs n integers, then the second program is run with:\n\n   input: \n        n (the same n) \n        then the n integers from the first program (as the v array) \n        then the c array (which we read as the next line)\n\nBut in the chain, the second program would read the integer `n` again. However, in our combined program, we don't need to read `n` again because we have it. But the input for the second program is provided as the next line? \n\nActually, the entire input we are reading is:\n\n   n\n   edges\n   c_arr\n\nSo we are not reading an extra `n` for the second program. But the second program in the chain would read an integer `n` from the first line of its input. That first line of the second program's input is the integer `n` that we already know? But in our combined program, we skip that because we already know `n` and the next two lines (v and c) are provided. However, the output of the first program is n integers (each per line). Then the second program reads:\n\n   first line: n (which is the integer n)\n   second line: the n integers (which are the colors, but we have them as an array)\n   third line: the n integers for c (which we read as the next line)\n\nBut in the input to the combined program, we don't have that integer `n` again? We only have the graph and then the c array. So we are missing the v array? \n\nBut wait: the v array for the second program is the output of the first program. In the combined program, we compute the v array (the colors) and then we have the c array from the input. So we don't need to read the v array from the input.\n\nBut the problem says the entire input to the combined program is the input for the first program and then the input for the second program? The second program's input is:\n\n   n\n   v0 v1 ... v_{n-1}\n   c0 c1 ... c_{n-1}\n\nBut we already have n from the first program. So the entire input would be:\n\n   n (for the first program)\n   then the n-1 edges\n   then n (again) for the second program?\n   then the v array? -> but we are going to compute the v array, so we don't need to read it.\n   then the c array.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAfter rethinking: the chain is:\n\n   The first program reads from stdin: \n        n\n        edges\n\n   and writes to stdout: \n        color0\n        color1\n        ...\n        color_{n-1}\n\n   Then the second program reads from stdin (which is now the output of the first program) so:\n\n        The first integer the second program reads is the first integer of the first program's output? But the first program's output is:\n\n            0\n            0\n            1\n\n        for n=3. Then the second program would read:\n\n            n = ? -> it reads the first token: 0 -> then n=0? \n\n        Then it expects n integers for v? 0 integers? \n\n        Then it fails.\n\nSo the chain is broken because the first program outputs n integers (without the integer n at the beginning). The second program expects the integer n at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, to fix the chain, we must feed the second program with:\n\n   n\n   [the n integers from the first program] (as a space separated line? or as n lines? the second program reads a line of n integers for v and then a line for c)\n\n   and then the c array? \n\nBut the second program reads:\n\n   n (as an integer)\n   then a line of n integers for v\n   then a line of n integers for c\n\nSo the entire input to the second program is:\n\n   n\n   v_line\n   c_line\n\nBut the output of the first program is n integers, each on a new line. To convert to the second program's input, we would have to:\n\n   Prepend a line with n\n   Then take the n integers and format them in one line\n   Then append the c array in one line.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to the second program is the output of the first program plus the c array? But the c array is not provided by the first program.\n\nTherefore, I think the only logical way is that the entire input to the combined program is:\n\n   n (for the graph)\n   n-1 edges\n   and then the c array (one line of n integers)\n\nAnd then the combined program does:\n\n   Step1: compute the colors (v array) from the graph.\n   Step2: use that v array and the read c array to compute the profit.\n\nSo we do not read an extra n for the second program, and we do not read the v array again.\n\nThis matches the description that the output of the first program (the v array) is used as the input to the second program. And then the second program also requires the c array, which is provided as additional input after the graph.\n\nTherefore, the program as written is correct.\n\nLet's write the final Fortran code."
