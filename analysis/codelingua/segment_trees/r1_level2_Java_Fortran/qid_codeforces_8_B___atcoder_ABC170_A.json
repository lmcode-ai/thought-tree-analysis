So we can do:\n\n      result = 0\n      token = output_str\n      result = result + 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          !",

Then we output `result_second` (which is 1). But note: the second program in Java uses a loop. We are doing one iteration. We can avoid the splitting by just counting the tokens? Actually, we don't need the tokens individually? We only need to check each token until we find a \"0\". But we know the entire string is one token and it's not \"0\", so we can skip. But to be generic, we can split the string by spaces? We can do:\n\n  We count the number of tokens by:\n\n      tokens: we can split manually. However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We are allowed to do computations. But the second program is very simple: we can do:\n\n      result_second = 0\n      i = 1\n      do while (i <= len_trim(out_str))\n          ! find next space\n          j = index(out_str(i:), ' ')\n          if (j == 0) then\n              ! last token\n              token = out_str(i:)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == '0') exit\n              exit   ! because no more tokens\n          else\n              ! token from i to i+j-2? because j is the position of the space in the substring starting at i.\n              token = out_str(i:i+j-2) result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == '0') exit i = i + j   ! move past the space and the token\n          end if\n      end do But this is complex? And we know there is no space. So we can do: result_second = 1\n      if (out_str == '0') then\n          ! then we break -> but we don't change result_second? It is already 1 and we break. end if\n\n  But wait: if we break, we don't process the rest? But there is no rest. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      result_second = 0\n      token = out_str   ! the whole string is one token\n      result_second = result_second + 1\n      if (token == '0') then\n          ! break: nothing more to do\n      end if\n\n  And then output result_second.

Specifically, when storing the point after the 100th move, we are at k=101 (which is safe) and then the 101st move would try to store at k=102 -> out of bounds.

And we do `co[0][k]` for `k` up to `s.length()+1`, which is 101 for 100 moves. If we have 101 moves, then k becomes 102 -> out of bounds. So the Java program is only safe for moves up to 100. Therefore, we can assume the input moves are at most 100. Alternatively, we could make the arrays dynamic? But the problem does not specify. We stick to the Java program's limits. Therefore, the Fortran program as above is correct. However, note: the Java program uses 0-indexed arrays. In Fortran, we use 1-indexed. So we start k=1 for the first point. Then for i=1 to length, we add a point at k=2, then k=3, etc. Then the total points are k = length+1.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (codeforces_8_B) reads a string of moves (L, R, U, D) and then checks if the path has any \"self-intersection\" within a certain condition (within 3 steps and adjacent). It outputs \"OK\" or \"BUG\". The second program (atcoder_ABC170_A) reads a line of space separated integers and outputs the index of the first occurrence of \"0\" (counting from 1).\n\nHowever, note that the problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nBut observe the outputs:\n  First program: either \"OK\" or \"BUG\" (a string of non-zero length without spaces? or two lines? Actually, it's one line: either \"OK\" or \"BUG\")\n  Second program: expects a line of space separated integers.\n\nBut the output of the first program is not a line of space separated integers. It is either:\n  \"OK\" or \"BUG\"\n\nSo if we chain:\n  Input to first program: a string (e.g., \"URLD\")\n  Output of first: \"OK\" (for example)\n\nThen the second program would read the string \"OK\", split it by space -> array of one element: [\"OK\"]\nThen it iterates until it finds \"0\", which it never does? Then it would output 1? Because it breaks at the first element? Actually, no: the loop breaks when it finds \"0\". If it doesn't find \"0\", then the loop would run for all elements? And then set result to the number of elements? Actually, the loop:\n\n    for (String str : input_array) {\n        result += 1;\n        if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n    }\n\nSo if the input_array is [\"OK\"], then:\n   result starts at 0.\n   first element: result becomes 1 -> then check if \"OK\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> so no break.\n   then loop ends (only one element). Then it prints 1.\n\nBut wait: the second program is designed to read a line of integers? Actually, the problem says: the first program outputs either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", which are two different strings.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"the entire sequence\" of programs. But note: the second program is independent? Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut the two programs are independent? They don't share any data structure. So we have to run the first program, then take its output and use as input to the second.\n\nBut the second program expects a line of space separated integers? and the first program outputs a string that is not integers.\n\nThis suggests that the two programs are not meant to be chained? Or is there a misunderstanding?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nBut the example provided is two programs. The first program's output is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", and the second program expects a line of integers. This is incompatible.\n\nWait: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". But note: the two programs are independent? Or are they meant to be run one after the other on the same initial input? Actually, no: the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nBut the example input for the first program is a string of moves. The second program expects integers? This chain does not make sense.\n\nHowever, let me reexamine the problem: it says \"reproduces the same behavior\". But the behavior of the entire sequence is:\n\n  Step 1: Read input (a string for the first program) -> process -> output a string (\"OK\" or \"BUG\")\n  Step 2: Take that string as input for the second program -> process -> output an integer.\n\nBut the second program is written to read a line of integers? Actually, no: the second program reads a line and splits by space, then looks for the string \"0\". So it can handle non-integer strings? It just checks for the string \"0\".\n\nSo if the first program outputs \"OK\", then the second program would read the string \"OK\", split it -> [\"OK\"], then it would iterate:\n   count=1, then check if \"OK\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> then output 1.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"BUG\", then the second program would read \"BUG\", split -> [\"BUG\"] -> then output 1.\n\nSo regardless of the first program's output, the second program outputs 1? That doesn't seem useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to run the two programs independently? But the problem states the output of the first is the input to the next.\n\nAnother possibility: the two programs are part of a sequence, but the input to the entire sequence is the same as the input to the first program? Then the output of the first becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second is the final output.\n\nBut then the example: \n  Input to the entire sequence: the string of moves (say \"URLD\")\n  Output of the entire sequence: the integer 1.\n\nBut that would be the same for any input? Because the second program always outputs 1 in this scenario.\n\nThis is confusing. However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nSo we have to mimic:\n\n  Input: the same as the first program's input (a string for the moves)\n\n  Then we run the first program, which produces a string (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\").\n\n  Then we run the second program, which uses that string as its input. The second program then outputs an integer.\n\nBut note: the second program is designed to read a line of space separated integers? Actually, no: it reads a line and splits by space. Then it looks for the exact string \"0\". Since the first program outputs one word (without spaces), the second program will have an array of one element.\n\nSo:\n\n  If the first program outputs \"OK\", then the second program's input is \"OK\". Then it will output 1 (because it counts the first element and then breaks? Actually, no: it breaks only when it finds \"0\". So it doesn't break and counts the only element -> result=1.\n\n  Similarly, if the first program outputs \"BUG\", then the second program outputs 1.\n\nSo the entire sequence always outputs 1? That doesn't depend on the input.\n\nThis seems odd. However, the problem says to translate the entire sequence.\n\nBut wait: the second program might be intended for a different purpose? The problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". We are given two. So we have to do:\n\n  Program1(input) -> output1\n  Program2(output1) -> output2\n\nAnd then the Fortran program should output output2.\n\nSo regardless of the input to the first program, the output of the entire sequence is 1.\n\nBut that can't be the intended behavior? Or maybe the example is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two programs are from different problems and are not intended to be chained? But the problem states they are to be executed in sequence.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will stick to the specification: chain the two as described.\n\nPlan:\n\n  The Fortran program will:\n    Step 1: Read a string (the initial input, which is a sequence of moves)\n    Step 2: Process that string to simulate the first program (codeforces_8_B) and determine if the output is \"OK\" or \"BUG\". Let that result be a string variable.\n    Step 3: Then, without any I/O in between, process that string (which is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") as the input to the second program (atcoder_ABC170_A). The second program expects a line of space separated tokens? But we only have one token. So we split by space? Actually, we don't need to split because we know the string has no space. We can consider it as a single token.\n\n    The second program: \n        It counts the tokens until it finds one that is \"0\", then it outputs the count (starting at 1 for the first token). Since our token is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", which are not \"0\", we will count the entire list (which has one token) and output 1.\n\n    So the final output is always 1.\n\nBut wait: the second program in Java:\n\n        String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String str : input_array) {\n            result += 1;\n            if (\"0\".equals(str)) break;\n        }\n\nSo if we have one token that is not \"0\", then the loop runs once: result becomes 1 and then the loop ends (because there is only one token). Then it prints 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  Reads a string (the moves) -> processes to compute a flag (true for \"OK\", false for \"BUG\") -> then we set a string variable to either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", and then we process that string as if it were the input to the second program -> which will output 1.\n\nSo the final Fortran program always prints 1? \n\nBut that seems incorrect because the first program might output \"BUG\" for some inputs, but the second program doesn't care: it always outputs 1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". So if we run the two Java programs in sequence, we get:\n\n  $ java codeforces_8_B\n  URLD   [for example]\n  OK\n\n  Then we run:\n  $ java atcoder_ABC170_A\n  OK\n  1\n\nSo the final output is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the first program outputs \"BUG\", then the second program outputs 1.\n\nSo the Fortran program should always output 1.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program fails? The problem doesn't say. We assume valid input.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended the two programs to be independent and run on the same initial input? But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the above, we write:\n\n  Read the initial string (the moves) into a variable.\n\n  Simulate the first program to compute a logical variable `flag` (true meaning \"OK\", false meaning \"BUG\").\n\n  Then we set a string variable `second_input` to either \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\n  Then we simulate the second program on `second_input`:\n\n      We split `second_input` by spaces? But it has no spaces -> one token.\n\n      We then look for the token \"0\". Since we have either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", we don't find it.\n\n      Then the result is the number of tokens? Actually, the second program counts the tokens until it finds a \"0\", and then breaks. Since we don't break, it counts every token? Actually, no: the loop breaks only when it finds \"0\". Otherwise, it counts all tokens? But note: the count is incremented for each token, and then if a token is \"0\", it breaks. So the result is the position (starting at 1) of the first occurrence of \"0\", or the total number of tokens if none is \"0\".\n\n      Since there is no \"0\", the result is the total number of tokens -> 1.\n\n  Then we output 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n  Reads the initial string (the moves) and then outputs 1.\n\nBut that is independent of the moves? Then why run the first program?\n\nThis is the behavior of the chain. So we can skip the first program? Actually, no: the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The chain always outputs 1. So we can just output 1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and we must only have the first block reading and the last block writing.\n\nHowever, the first program might have side effects? But it doesn't. So we can skip the entire first program? But note: the first program might crash on some inputs? We have to be faithful.\n\nActually, the first program does not crash on any input? It reads a string and processes each character. We must simulate the first program to be faithful? But the problem says: the entire sequence. And the output of the entire sequence is always 1. So we can just output 1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program is to check the path. Even though the second program ignores the result, the chain might be intended to be used in a context where the first program does something important? But the output is always 1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have provided the wrong programs? But we must work with what we have.\n\nGiven the above, we write a Fortran program that:\n\n  Reads a string (the moves) and then does the same processing as the first program (to be faithful to the chain, even though the result is not used for the final output beyond setting a string that is not \"0\") and then runs the second program which always outputs 1.\n\nBut note: the second program only outputs 1 because the string from the first program has one token and no \"0\". So we can do:\n\n  Step 1: Read the string (moves)\n  Step 2: Process the moves as in the first program (to compute `flag`)\n  Step 3: Then, regardless of `flag`, we set the token for the second program to be one token (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") but we don't actually need to break it into tokens? We know there is one token and no \"0\", so the second program will output 1.\n\n  So we can simply output 1.\n\nBut to be faithful to the original programs, we must simulate the first program? Because the first program might have bugs? Or it might crash on invalid input? We have to mimic that.\n\nTherefore, we must simulate the first program exactly, and then the second program exactly.\n\nHowever, note: the first program does not crash on any input? It reads a string and processes each character. If the character is not one of 'L','R','U','D', then it does nothing? Actually, the switch does nothing for other characters? Then it still records the same (x,y) again? Then the path might be incorrect? But the problem doesn't specify invalid characters. We assume the input only contains these four.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  Read a string `s` (the moves)\n\n  We simulate the path: starting at (0,0). For each move, update (x,y). Record every step (including start) in an array `co` (which is a 2D array: first row for x, second for y) for k steps (k = len(s)+1).\n\n  Then we check for self-intersection: for i from 0 to k-4 (because k-3 in Java: i < k-3) and j from i+3 to k-1. For each pair (i,j), we compute the absolute differences dx and dy. Then if (dx<=1 and dy==0) or (dy<=1 and dx==0) then set flag to false.\n\n  Then set `output_str` to \"OK\" if flag is true, else \"BUG\".\n\n  Then we simulate the second program on the string `output_str`:\n\n      We split `output_str` by spaces? But there are no spaces -> one token.\n\n      Then we traverse the tokens until we find a token that is \"0\". We count the tokens as we go. Since we have one token and it is not \"0\", the count becomes 1 and then we finish the tokens.\n\n      Then the result is 1.\n\n  Then we write 1.\n\nBut note: the second program does not break in the loop until it finds a \"0\". So we can break early? Actually, we don't break, so we just count the first token and then move on (because there is only one). So the count is 1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  integer :: result = 1   (because we know there's one token and it's not \"0\")\n\nBut to be faithful, we simulate the loop.\n\nSteps:\n\n  We'll split the string `output_str` by space? But note: the second program uses `split(\" \")`. However, if the string has no space, we get an array of one element.\n\n  We can simulate the tokenization by:\n\n      tokens(1) = output_str   (if we know there's one token)\n\n  Then we set `result` to 0 and then for each token, we increment `result` and check if the token is \"0\". If we find \"0\", we break.\n\n  Then output `result`.\n\nBut note: the second program does not require the input to be integers? It just checks for the string \"0\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n  We read the initial string (the moves)\n\n  We simulate the first program to get a string `output_str` (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\")\n\n  Then we split `output_str` by spaces? Actually, we don't need to split because we know there are no spaces. We can treat the entire string as one token.\n\n  Then we set `result = 1` because we have one token and it's not \"0\". But to be safe and if we had multiple tokens, we would need to split.\n\n  However, the output of the first program is one word. So we can avoid splitting? But the second program splits by space. So if the output of the first program had a space, we would get multiple tokens? But it doesn't.\n\n  Therefore, we can simply set:\n\n      num_tokens = 1\n      token = output_str\n\n  Then we do:\n\n      result = 0\n      do i = 1, num_tokens\n          result = result + 1\n          if (token == \"0\") exit\n      end do\n\n  But note: the second program breaks at the first occurrence of \"0\". So if we had multiple tokens, we would break early. But we have one token and it's not \"0\", so we do one iteration.\n\n  Then we output `result` (which is 1).\n\nBut we know the token is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so we can skip the loop? The problem says: without I/O in the middle, but we can do computations.\n\nHowever, to be faithful, we simulate the tokenization and the loop.\n\nBut note: the second program does:\n\n      String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n\n  So if the string is \"OK\", then input_array = [\"OK\"]\n\n  Then the loop:\n\n      for each token in input_array:\n          result += 1\n          if token is \"0\", break\n\n  We can do:\n\n      tokens = [character(len=len_trim(output_str)) ::]   ? Actually, we have one token.\n\n  How to split by space in Fortran? We can use `index` to find spaces? But if there are no spaces, then we don't need to split? We can just use the whole string.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid splitting by noting that there are no spaces. So we have one token.\n\n  Therefore:\n\n      token = trim(output_str)   ! we have one token\n\n      result = 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          ! break, so result remains 1? Actually, we break after setting result to 1? But then we don't process further tokens? But there are none.\n      else\n          ! we don't break, so we just have result=1 and then done.\n      end if\n\n  But the loop in the second program does:\n\n        result = 0\n        for each token:\n            result += 1\n            if token==\"0\": break\n\n  So we can simulate:\n\n        result = 0\n        token = the first token (which is the entire string)\n        result = result + 1\n        if (token == \"0\") then\n            exit   ! but there are no more tokens anyway\n        end if\n\n        ! then next token? none.\n\n  So we don't need a loop? Because we know there is one token.\n\n  But to be generic (if we had multiple tokens) we would need to split? However, the output of the first program is without space. So we know one token.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      result = 1   ! because we have one token and we break only if we find \"0\", which we don't.\n\n  But note: if the token were \"0\", we would break and output 1.\n\n  However, our token is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so we output 1.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program:\n\n  Reads the moves string.\n\n  Simulates the path and the self-intersection check (as in the first Java program).\n\n  Sets `output_str` to \"OK\" if no self-intersection, else \"BUG\".\n\n  Then, for the second program, we set `result = 1` (because we know there is one token and it's not \"0\") and output `result`.\n\nBut wait: what if the output_str had a space? It doesn't. So we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the simulation of the second program in a generic way? But the problem says: without I/O in the middle, but we can do computations.\n\nHowever, to be safe and generic, we can split the string by spaces? But the output_str has no spaces. So we can skip.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The second program in Java uses `split` and then iterates. We can simulate:\n\n  We split the string `output_str` by spaces? We know there is none. So we get one token.\n\n  Then we set `result = 0` and then for each token:\n\n        result = result + 1\n        if (token == \"0\") then\n            exit\n        end if\n\n  Then output result.\n\nIn Fortran, we can split a string by spaces? We can do:\n\n  We count the number of tokens: by counting the spaces? Actually, we can use intrinsic functions.\n\n  But note: the Java `split` method: if the string is empty, it returns an array of one element (the empty string). Also, if there are consecutive spaces, it returns empty tokens? But our output_str has no space.\n\n  So we can simply:\n\n      token = output_str   ! the entire string is the token.\n\n      result = 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          ! then we break the loop (but we don't have a loop) -> we can set result=1 and then break? Actually, we break after the first token anyway.\n\n  How about:\n\n      result = 0\n      ! we have one token: we do one iteration.\n\n      result = result + 1\n      if (token == \"0\") exit   ! but we are not in a loop? We can do without a loop.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      result = 0\n      token = output_str\n      result = result + 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          ! break: meaning we don't process any more tokens (but there are none)\n      end if\n\n  Then output result.\n\nBut note: if we had multiple tokens, we would need a loop. But we don't.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  integer :: result_second = 0\n  character(len=3) :: token   ! because \"OK\" and \"BUG\" are 2 and 3 characters? But we can use dynamic allocation? Or we know the max length: 3.\n\n  token = trim(output_str)   ! but we know there are no trailing spaces? The first program outputs without space.\n\n  result_second = result_second + 1\n  if (token == \"0\") then\n      ! we break: but nothing else to do\n  end if\n\n  Then print result_second.\n\nBut note: the token is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so we don't break.\n\nBut what if the first program output \"0\"? It never does.\n\nSo we can simply set result_second = 1.\n\nBut to be faithful to the code, we write the steps.\n\nHowever, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We are doing computations.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  Read the initial string.\n\n  Simulate the first program (without I/O) to get a string `out_str` (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\").\n\n  Then, for the second program:\n\n      We set `result_second = 0`\n      We split the string `out_str` by spaces? We know there is one token.\n\n      We set `result_second = result_second + 1` -> becomes 1.\n      We check if the token is \"0\": it isn't, so we don't break.\n\n      Then we output `result_second` (which is 1).\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses a loop. We are doing one iteration.\n\nWe can avoid the splitting by just counting the tokens? Actually, we don't need the tokens individually? We only need to check each token until we find a \"0\". But we know the entire string is one token and it's not \"0\", so we can skip.\n\nBut to be generic, we can split the string by spaces? We can do:\n\n  We count the number of tokens by:\n\n      tokens: we can split manually.\n\n  However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We are allowed to do computations.\n\n  But the second program is very simple: we can do:\n\n      result_second = 0\n      i = 1\n      do while (i <= len_trim(out_str))\n          ! find next space\n          j = index(out_str(i:), ' ')\n          if (j == 0) then\n              ! last token\n              token = out_str(i:)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == '0') exit\n              exit   ! because no more tokens\n          else\n              ! token from i to i+j-2? because j is the position of the space in the substring starting at i.\n              token = out_str(i:i+j-2)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == '0') exit\n              i = i + j   ! move past the space and the token\n          end if\n      end do\n\n  But this is complex? And we know there is no space. So we can do:\n\n      result_second = 1\n      if (out_str == '0') then\n          ! then we break -> but we don't change result_second? It is already 1 and we break.\n      end if\n\n  But wait: if we break, we don't process the rest? But there is no rest.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      result_second = 0\n      token = out_str   ! the whole string is one token\n      result_second = result_second + 1\n      if (token == '0') then\n          ! break: nothing more to do\n      end if\n\n  And then output result_second.\n\nThis is safe and simple.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n  program chained\n      implicit none\n      character(len=100) :: s\n      integer :: i, j, x, y, k, dx, dy\n      logical :: flag\n      integer, dimension(2, 101) :: co   ! co(1,:) for x, co(2,:) for y; maximum 101 points (len(s) up to 100)\n      character(len=100) :: ch   ! to hold the moves\n      integer :: length\n      character(len=3) :: out_str   ! either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so 3 is enough for \"BUG\" (3 letters)\n      integer :: result_second\n      character(len=3) :: token   ! for the second program\n\n      ! Read the input string (the moves)\n      read(*, '(a)') s\n      length = len_trim(s)\n\n      ! Initialize\n      x = 0\n      y = 0\n      k = 1\n      co(1, k) = x\n      co(2, k) = y\n\n      ! Copy the string to ch? But we can use s directly.\n      ! We'll process each character in s\n      do i = 1, length\n          select case (s(i:i))\n              case ('L')\n                  x = x - 1\n              case ('R')\n                  x = x + 1\n              case ('U')\n                  y = y + 1\n              case ('D')\n                  y = y - 1\n          end select\n          k = k + 1\n          co(1, k) = x\n          co(2, k) = y\n      end do\n\n      ! Now k is the total number of points (length+1)\n      flag = .true.\n      do i = 1, k-3   ! i from 1 to k-3\n          do j = i+3, k   ! j from i+3 to k\n              dx = co(1, i) - co(1, j)\n              dy = co(2, i) - co(2, j)\n              if (dx < 0) dx = -dx\n              if (dy < 0) dy = -dy\n              if ((dx <= 1 .and. dy == 0) .or. (dy <= 1 .and. dx == 0)) then\n                  flag = .false.\n                  exit\n              end if\n          end do\n          if (.not. flag) exit\n      end do\n\n      ! Set out_str\n      if (flag) then\n          out_str = \"OK\"\n      else\n          out_str = \"BUG\"\n      end if\n\n      ! Now, simulate the second program with input out_str\n      result_second = 0\n\n      ! We have one token: the entire out_str\n      token = trim(out_str)   ! though out_str has no trailing spaces? But we set it to \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so no space.\n\n      result_second = result_second + 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          ! break: nothing more to do\n          ! but we don't have more tokens, so we just break the token processing\n      end if\n\n      ! Output the result_second\n      write(*, '(i0)') result_second\n\n  end program chained\n\nBut note: the second program only has one token. So we don't need a loop for multiple tokens? But the Java program uses a loop that would break on the first \"0\". We break after the first token anyway? Actually, we break if we find \"0\" in the first token? Then we don't process the rest? But in our case, there is no rest.\n\nBut what if the string had multiple tokens? The problem states the output of the first program is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", which are single words. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, to be generic to the second program's behavior, we should split the input string (out_str) by spaces and then iterate until we find a \"0\". But we know there is only one token and no space. So we can do without splitting.\n\nAlternatively, we can split by spaces? We can use:\n\n      tokens: we don't know how many? But maximum one.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      ! We'll find the first token: from start to first space or end.\n      ! But we know there is no space. So:\n\n      token = out_str\n\n      result_second = 1\n      if (token == \"0\") then\n          ! break: we don't need to look at more tokens? but we don't have any.\n      end if\n\n  But the second program breaks and then stops processing? So if we had multiple tokens, we would break and not count the rest? We are only counting the first token? So we don't need to split the entire string? We only need to process until we break.\n\n  How about:\n\n      result_second = 0\n      i = 1\n      start = 1\n      do while (start <= len_trim(out_str))\n          ! find next space\n          pos = index(out_str(start:), ' ')\n          if (pos == 0) then\n              ! last token\n              token = out_str(start:)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == \"0\") exit\n              exit\n          else\n              token = out_str(start:start+pos-2)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == \"0\") exit\n              start = start + pos   ! move to the next token (after the space)\n          end if\n      end do\n\n  But we know there are no spaces, so we can skip the loop? But we want to be generic? However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The second program would split the entire string and then iterate? But the output of the first program is one word.\n\n  We decide to do the simple thing: since there is no space, we do one token.\n\n  But note: the second program in Java does split the entire string at once? Then iterates over the array. So it does all the tokens? But we break when we find a \"0\". So we only process until we find a \"0\".\n\n  We can simulate without splitting the entire string? We can split on the fly.\n\n  However, the problem is small: the output of the first program is at most 3 characters. So we can split easily.\n\n  Let me write a simple tokenizer:\n\n      integer :: start, pos, token_count\n      character(len=3) :: token   ! max token length is 3\n\n      result_second = 0\n      start = 1\n      do while (start <= len_trim(out_str))\n          ! find next space starting from `start`\n          pos = index(out_str(start:), ' ')\n          if (pos == 0) then\n              ! take the rest\n              token = out_str(start:)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == \"0\") exit\n              exit\n          else\n              ! the token is from start to start+pos-2\n              token = out_str(start:start+pos-2)\n              result_second = result_second + 1\n              if (token == \"0\") exit\n              start = start + pos   ! now start is at the character after the space\n          end if\n      end do\n\n  But note: the split in Java: consecutive spaces would yield empty tokens? For example, if the string is \"A  B\", then split by space gives [\"A\", \"\", \"B\"]? Actually, no: the split method in Java without a limit: trailing empty tokens are discarded? But consecutive delimiters are treated as one? Actually, no: by default, consecutive delimiters are allowed and will produce empty strings? \n\n  From the Java documentation: \n      \"The string \"boo:and:foo\", for example, yields the following results with these expressions:\n       Regex     Result\n        :        { \"boo\", \"and\", \"foo\" }\n        o        { \"b\", \"\", \":and:f\" }\"\n\n  But we are splitting by a single space: \" \". \n\n  Example: \"A  B\" (with two spaces) -> split(\" \") -> [\"A\", \"\", \"B\"]? \n\n  Actually, no: the split method without a limit argument discards trailing empty strings? But for leading and consecutive, it includes empty tokens? \n\n  Let me check: \n      \"A  B\".split(\" \") -> returns an array of 3 elements: [\"A\", \"\", \"B\"]? \n\n  Actually, no: the split method without a limit will not include trailing empty tokens? But consecutive delimiters are considered to split, so the two spaces: the first space splits \"A\" and then the next character is space -> so the next token is the empty string? Then the next token is \"B\".\n\n  So we must be prepared for empty tokens.\n\n  However, the output of the first program is either \"OK\" or \"BUG\", so no space. So we don't have to worry.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip the tokenizer and simply do:\n\n      result_second = 1\n      if (out_str == \"0\") then\n          ! break: but we don't need to do anything because we are not in a loop? We just set result_second=1 and break? \n          ! Actually, we break the tokenization? But we only have one token.\n\n      end if\n\n  But the second program would break in the first token? So we do the same.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      result_second = 1\n      if (out_str == \"0\") then\n          ! we break, so we don't process further tokens (none anyway)\n      else\n          ! we don't break, so we would have processed the next token? but there is none.\n      end if\n\n  Therefore, we output 1.\n\n  But if the string had been \"0\", we output 1? Yes.\n\n  And if the string had been \"0 1\", then the second program would break at the first token and output 1.\n\n  But our `out_str` is not \"0\", so we output 1.\n\nTherefore, the program is:\n\n  We read the moves string.\n\n  We simulate the first program to compute `out_str`.\n\n  We set `result_second = 1`.\n\n  We output `result_second`.\n\nBut note: the second program might have multiple tokens? But we know `out_str` has one token.\n\nSo we can skip the tokenization.\n\nFinal Fortran program:\n\n  program chained\n      implicit none\n      character(len=100) :: s\n      integer :: i, j, x, y, k, dx, dy, length\n      logical :: flag\n      integer, dimension(2, 101) :: co   ! 101 because the path has at most 101 points (100 moves)\n      character(len=3) :: out_str\n      integer :: result_second\n\n      !

(dy <= 1 .and. dx == 0)) then\n                  flag = .false.\n                  exit\n              end if\n          end do\n          if (.not. flag) exit\n      end do\n\n      if (flag) then\n          out_str = \"OK\"\n      else\n          out_str = \"BUG\"\n      end if\n\n      ! Now, for the second program: we know out_str is one token and not \"0\", so:\n      result_second = 1\n\n      ! Output the result of the second program\n      write(*, '(i0)') result_second\n\n  end program chained\n\nBut wait: what if the path has more than 100 moves? The first Java program uses `ch = new char[100]` and `co = new int[2][101]`, so it only handles up to 100 moves? Then we are safe with 101 points.\n\nWe assume the input string length is at most 100.\n\nTherefore, we use:\n\n      character(len=100) :: s   ! the input moves\n\n  and\n\n      integer, dimension(2, 101) :: co   ! 101 points: from 0 to 100 moves.\n\nThis matches the first program.\n\nWe output the integer 1.\n\nBut note: the second program might be intended to read the output of the first program? And if the first program output \"BUG\", then the second program would output 1? Yes.\n\nBut the entire chain always outputs 1.\n\nSo we could replace the entire program with:\n\n  program chained\n      implicit none\n      character(len=100) :: s\n      read(*, '(a)') s\n      write(*, '(i0)') 1\n  end program\n\nBut then we are not simulating the first program. The first program might crash on long inputs? Or if the input has more than 100 characters? The Java program uses `char[100]`? Actually, no: `s = scan.next()` can read a string of any length? Then `ch = s.toCharArray()` and then `for (i=0; i < s.length(); ...)`.\n\nBut the `ch` array is initialized to `new char[100]`? Then if `s.length()` is more than 100, we get an exception? \n\nIn Java: `char[] ch = new char[100];` then `ch = s.toCharArray();` -> this assigns a new array to `ch`? So it can be any length.\n\nBut the `co` array is `new int[2][101]`, which is fixed size. Then if `s.length()>100`, we will write beyond the array.\n\nSo the first program is only safe for up to 100 moves? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nIn the Fortran program, we have:\n\n      character(len=100) :: s   ! which can hold up to 100 characters? But what if the input is longer? Then we read only 100.\n\n      length = len_trim(s)   ! then we process up to 100 moves.\n\n  and the array `co` is dimensioned (2,101), which is safe for 100 moves.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut to be faithful, we must only process up to 100 moves? Actually, the Java program would crash for moves>100? Because `co` is only 101 columns? And we do `co[0][k]` for `k` up to `s.length()+1`, which is 101 for 100 moves. If we have 101 moves, then k becomes 102 -> out of bounds.\n\nSo the Java program is only safe for moves up to 100.\n\nTherefore, we can assume the input moves are at most 100.\n\nAlternatively, we could make the arrays dynamic? But the problem does not specify.\n\nWe stick to the Java program's limits.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program as above is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the Java program uses 0-indexed arrays. In Fortran, we use 1-indexed. So we start k=1 for the first point. Then for i=1 to length, we add a point at k=2, then k=3, etc. Then the total points are k = length+1.\n\nIn the loop:\n\n      do i = 1, k-3   ! i from 1 to k-3 (which is from 1 to (length+1)-3 = length-2)\n\n      and j from i+3 to k.\n\nThis matches the Java: i from 0 to k-4 (0-indexed) and j from i+3 to k-1 (0-indexed). In Fortran, we are using i from 1 to k-3 (which is the same number of iterations) and j from i+3 to k (which is the same as j from i+3 to k-1 in 0-indexed? Actually, in Java the array has indices 0 to k-1. In Fortran, we have 1 to k. So the point indices are the same.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nBut note: the Java program uses:\n\n        co[0][k] = x;\n        co[1][k] = y;\n\n  and k starts at 0 and then increments after each point.\n\n  In Fortran, we do:\n\n      k=1: (x,y) at (0,0) -> co(1,1)=0, co(2,1)=0\n      then for the first move: update (x,y) and then set k=2 -> co(1,2)=x, co(2,2)=y.\n\n  So the array of points is the same.\n\nNow, we output 1.\n\nBut what if the first program crashes? For example, if the input string has more than 100 moves? Then the Java program would crash with ArrayIndexOutOfBounds? We don't handle that. We assume the input is within 100 moves.\n\nSimilarly, in Fortran, if the input string is longer than 100, we only read 100 and then process those 100 moves. But the array `co` is 101, so we are safe.\n\nBut the Java program would read the entire string? and then crash when storing the 101th point? \n\nIn the Java program:\n\n      co = new int[2][101];   // 101 columns, indexed 0 to 100.\n\n      k starts at 0 and increments to s.length()+1.\n\n      So if s.length()>100, then k will exceed 100 -> array index out of bounds.\n\nIn Fortran, we have:\n\n      character(len=100) :: s   -> so we read at most 100 characters.\n\n      Then length = len_trim(s) is at most 100.\n\n      Then k goes from 1 to length+1, which is 101. And we have co dimensioned (2,101), so we are safe.\n\nSo the Fortran program avoids the crash by truncating the input? \n\nBut the Java program does not truncate: it reads the entire string and then crashes.\n\nTo be faithful, we should read the entire string? But we don't know the length in advance. And if the string is longer than 100, we cannot store in `s` which is 100.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the entire line? But the problem says the input is a string of moves.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the maximum length.\n\nWe decide to mimic the Java program's behavior: if the input string has more than 100 moves, then we will get an array out of bounds in the first program. But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we should crash? But Fortran doesn't necessarily crash? We can check:\n\n      if (length > 100) then\n          ! then we would have k from 1 to 101 (for 100 moves) and then for the 101st move, k becomes 102 -> co(1,102) is out of bounds.\n          ! so we should avoid that.\n\n          ! But the Java program crashes, so we should too? Or we can let it crash.\n\n      end if\n\nBut the problem says to write a Fortran program. We can write:\n\n      if (length > 100) then\n          write(*, *) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n          stop\n      end if\n\nBut the Java program throws an exception. We can do:\n\n      if (k+1 > 101) then   ! after a move, k becomes k+1, and we assign to co(1,k) and co(2,k). So after the 100th move, k becomes 101 -> which is within bounds? \n\n      Actually:\n\n          k starts at 1.\n          Then we do for i=1 to 100 (if length=100) -> then we do 100 moves, so k becomes 101 at the end.\n\n          And we have co(2,101) -> which is the last element? So we are safe for 100 moves.\n\n      But if length>100, then we try to do i=101, which would be beyond the string? We read s(101:101) -> but s is only 100 characters? Then we get a blank? Actually, Fortran will not crash? It will take s(101:101) as a blank? \n\n      Then the move for a blank: the select case does nothing? Then we record the same (x,y) again? Then k becomes 102 -> and we assign to co(1,102) -> out of bounds.\n\n  So we can check during the loop:\n\n        if (k+1 > 101) then\n            ! crash\n            write(*,*) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n            stop\n        end if\n\n  But the Java program crashes naturally.\n\n  Alternatively, we can rely on the Fortran compiler to catch out of bounds? But we should compile with bounds checking? The problem doesn't say.\n\n  To be safe, we note the problem says: the Java programs. We assume the input is at most 100 moves.\n\n  So we don't handle it.\n\n  In the read: we read up to 100 characters. So if the input has more than 100 moves, we only take the first 100.\n\n  This is different from the Java program.\n\n  To mimic, we should read the entire string? But we don't know the length. We can do:\n\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: s_long\n      integer :: input_size\n\n      ! Read the entire line\n      read(*, '(a)') s   ! but we declared s as 100, so it will read up to 100.\n\n  How to read an arbitrary long string in Fortran? We can do:\n\n      character(len=1000000) :: s   ! a big buffer\n\n  But the problem says the first program only handles up to 100 moves? So we can read up to 1000000, but then we only process the first 100 moves? Or we can crash if the string length>100? \n\n  We decide to read the entire line and then take the first 100 characters? Or we can read only 100.\n\n  The Java program: `scan.next()` reads the next token? It might be limited by the buffer? But we don't know.\n\n  We'll read up to 100 characters.\n\n  So:\n\n      read(*, '(a)') s   ! reads the entire line? but if the line is longer than 100, it reads 100 and leaves the rest? \n\n  Actually, it reads up to 100 characters. So we get the first 100 moves.\n\n  Then we set `length = min(100, len_trim(s))`? But what if the string has trailing spaces? The moves are without space? So we can do:\n\n      length = min(100, len_trim(s))\n\n  But the moves are contiguous. So we can just use the whole string we read? But if it's longer than 100, we only use the first 100.\n\n  Then we set `length = 100`? Or we do:\n\n      do i = 1, min(length, 100)\n\n  But we set `length = len_trim(s)`, then we do:\n\n      do i = 1, min(length, 100)\n\n  But if `length>100`, then we only do 100 moves.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, we modify:\n\n      read(*, '(a)') s\n      length = len_trim(s)\n      ! We'll only process up to 100 moves\n      length = min(length, 100)\n\n  Then we are safe.\n\n  But the Java program would crash if the string is longer than 100? Because it tries to store more than 101 points.\n\n  We avoid the crash by truncating.\n\n  This is a difference.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the behavior for long strings. We assume the input is within 100 moves.\n\n  To be faithful, we can crash if the string is longer than 100? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      if (len_trim(s) > 100) then\n          write(*, *) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n          stop\n      else\n          length = len_trim(s)\n      end if\n\n  But the Java program crashes when storing the point, not when reading.\n\n  We can simulate by:\n\n      if (len_trim(s) > 100) then\n          ! We know that k will become 102 at the 101st move -> we can simulate until k=101 and then crash on the 101st move?\n          ! But we are truncating to 100 moves, so we don't crash.\n\n      end if\n\n  We decide to truncate to avoid crashing. The problem says \"behaves identically\" for the same input. For an input with more than 100 moves, the Java program crashes, but ours doesn't? So it's not identical.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      length = len_trim(s)\n      if (length > 100) then\n          ! In the first program, it would crash when k becomes 102, which is at i=101 in the loop? But we don't do i=101 because we limit the loop to 100.\n          ! Instead, we can set length=100, but then after the loop, k=101, which is within bounds.\n          ! So we don't crash.\n\n          ! To crash, we can do:\n          co(1, 102) = 0   ! This will crash if compiled with bounds checking? Or we can do:\n          write(*, *) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n          stop\n      end if\n\n  But the Java program crashes at the first move beyond 100? Specifically, when storing the point after the 100th move, we are at k=101 (which is safe) and then the 101st move would try to store at k=102 -> out of bounds.\n\n  So if the string has 101 moves, then after the 100th move, we have k=101. Then we do i=101: which is within the string? Then we update x,y and then do:\n\n          k = k + 1   -> 102\n          co(1,102) = x   -> out of bounds.\n\n  So in Fortran, we can:\n\n      if (length > 100) then\n          ! We process the first 100 moves without problem.\n          ! Then for i=101, we do the 101st move?\n          ! But we have a loop: do i=1, min(length,100) -> so we skip i=101.\n\n          ! But if we don't truncate, then we do i=101 and then try to assign to co(1,102) -> crash.\n\n      end if\n\n  So if we remove the truncation and rely on bounds checking, it will crash.\n\n  But the problem says to compile without bounds checking? Not specified.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      read(*, '(a)') s\n      length = len_trim(s)\n\n      ! Then we do the loop for i=1 to length\n\n      ! But if length>100, then at i=101, we will try to write co(1, k) with k=102 -> which is out of bounds.\n\n  So if the Fortran program is run with bounds checking, it will crash. Without, it might silently write to memory.\n\n  To be safe, we do:\n\n      if (length > 100) then\n          write(*, *) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n          stop\n      end if\n\n  Then we crash for length>100, like the Java program.\n\n  Therefore, we add:\n\n      read(*, '(a)') s\n      length = len_trim(s)\n      if (length > 100) then\n          write(*, *) \"Array index out of bounds\"\n          stop\n      end if\n\n  Then the behavior is identical for inputs with more than 100 moves.\n\n  But note: the array `co` is dimensioned (2,101), so we can store up to 101 points, which is 100 moves. So if the input has 100 moves, we are safe.\n\n  So we crash only if the input has more than 100 moves.\n\n  This matches.\n\nFinal program:"
