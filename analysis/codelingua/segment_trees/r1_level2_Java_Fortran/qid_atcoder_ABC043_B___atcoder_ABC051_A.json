This matches. Another test: token = \"01B0\" \n          -> '0': buffer=\"0\", len=1.\n          -> '1': buffer=\"01\", len=2.\n          -> 'B': buffer=\"0\", len=1.\n          -> '0': buffer=\"00\", len=2. Then replace commas: no change -> output \"00\" So it's correct. But note: the second program also replaces commas? but in this example there is none. We are doing the replacement: it's a no-op. Therefore, the code is as above. We output the program. Note: We assume the input is not too long (<= MAX_LEN). If the input line is longer than MAX_LEN, then we only read the first MAX_LEN characters? and then extract the first token from that?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (atcoder_ABC043_B):\n  - Reads a string.\n  - Processes the string: \n        On '0': appends \"0\"\n        On '1': appends \"1\"\n        On 'B': deletes the last character (if any)\n  - Outputs the processed string.\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC051_A):\n  - Reads a string (which would be the output of the first program).\n  - Replaces every comma ',' with a space ' '.\n  - Outputs the result.\n\nWe are to write a single Fortran program that:\n  - Only the first part (corresponding to the first Java program) reads input.\n  - The intermediate processing (both steps) without I/O in between.\n  - Only the last part (second Java program's output) writes the output.\n\nSteps:\n  1. Read the input string (this is the input to the first program).\n  2. Process the string as in the first program: traverse each character and simulate the behavior (using a buffer that we can append to and remove the last character).\n  3. Then, on the resulting string from step 2, replace every comma with a space.\n  4. Output the final string.\n\nImportant: We must not do any I/O in the middle.\n\nLet's design:\n\n  We'll read the entire input line (since the first Java program reads a string and the second also reads a string).\n\n  We need to simulate:\n    - We'll have a buffer (a character array or a string) that we build.\n    - Traverse each character in the input string:\n        if char is '0' -> append '0'\n        if char is '1' -> append '1'\n        if char is 'B' -> remove the last character (if the buffer is non-empty)\n\n  Then, we traverse the buffer and replace every comma (if any) by a space? \n  But note: the output of the first program is the input to the second. The second program replaces commas by spaces.\n\n  However, note that the first program only outputs the characters '0' and '1' (and possibly deletes some). So the string after the first program does not contain any comma? \n  But wait: the first program's input might contain commas? Actually, the first program only acts on '0', '1', and 'B'. It ignores other characters? \n\n  Let me look again at the first program:\n\n      switch (c) {\n          case '0': ... break;\n          case '1': ... break;\n          case 'B': ... break;\n      }\n\n  So if the input has a comma, the first program would ignore it? Then the output of the first program would not have the comma? \n\n  But the second program replaces commas by spaces. However, if the first program removes commas (because it ignores them) then the second program would not see any comma? \n\n  Actually, the first program does not output any comma. It only outputs '0' and '1'. And the second program is applied to the output of the first. So there should be no comma to replace? \n\n  However, note: the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second. The second program replaces commas by spaces. But if the first program's output has no commas, then the second program does nothing? \n\n  But wait, the example? \n\n  Example: \n    Input to first program: \"0B1,B\" \n    Step by step:\n        '0' -> buffer becomes \"0\"\n        'B' -> delete last -> buffer becomes \"\"\n        '1' -> buffer becomes \"1\"\n        ',' -> ignored? (because not '0','1','B') -> buffer remains \"1\"\n        'B' -> delete last -> buffer becomes \"\"\n    So output of first program is empty string.\n\n    Then input to second program is empty string -> output is empty.\n\n  But the second program in the chain would read the empty string and output empty.\n\n  However, note the second program reads a line and replaces commas. So it would read the empty string and output the same (with no commas to replace).\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n    Step 1: Read a string (the entire line? the first program uses a tokenizer that reads next token? but note: the first program's LightScanner reads tokens. However, the input is a single token? \n\n    Actually, the first program reads a string with `in.string()` which is a token. But the problem might have multiple tokens? \n\n    But the example input might be a single line without spaces? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". And the first program outputs a string (without spaces? because it only outputs 0 and 1). \n\n    The second program reads a whole line and replaces commas. But the output of the first program is a single string (without spaces) and then the second program reads that as a whole line? \n\n    So we must read the entire line in the first program? \n\n    Actually, the first program uses `reader.readLine()` in the LightScanner when it needs a token. But it only reads one token. So if the input line has multiple tokens, the first program only takes the first token? \n\n    The problem does not specify. But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". \n\n    However, the second program reads an entire line. \n\n    How should we chain? \n\n    Since the first program only outputs a single token (without spaces) and then the second program reads that entire token as a line? \n\n    Actually, the first program outputs `d` (a string) and then the second program reads a line. But the first program's output is printed as a line? \n\n    The first program does: `out.println(d);` -> which prints the string and then a newline. \n\n    Then the second program reads a line (without the newline) and replaces commas. \n\n    So the input to the second program is the entire string that the first program printed without the trailing newline? \n\n    But note: `out.println(d);` appends a newline. Then when the second program reads a line, it reads the string without the newline. \n\n    Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n        Input: a string (with possible spaces? but the first program only reads the first token?).\n\n    This is a problem: the first program only takes the first token. The second program expects a whole line. \n\n    How to resolve? \n\n    The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We must replicate the behavior. \n\n    The first program only processes the first token of the input. The rest of the tokens (if any) are not read. \n\n    Then the second program reads the entire output of the first program (which is a single token) as a line? \n\n    But note: the first program writes a line (the token and then a newline). Then the second program reads a line (which is exactly that token without the newline). \n\n    So the Fortran program should:\n\n        - Read the first token? or the entire line? \n\n        The first program in Java reads the first token. So we should read the first token? \n\n        However, Fortran does not have tokenization by default. We can read the entire line and then take the first token? \n\n        But note: the problem says the input to the first program is the same. \n\n        Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then process only the first contiguous non-whitespace sequence? \n\n        But the problem does not specify the input format. \n\n        Since the original first program uses a tokenizer (which splits by whitespace), we must do the same: read the entire line and then extract the first token (non-whitespace characters until next whitespace). \n\n        However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". \n\n        Let's assume the input is a single line that may have multiple tokens. The first program only uses the first token. \n\n        Then the output of the first program is a string (without spaces) and then the second program replaces commas in that string. \n\n        So in Fortran:\n\n            Step 1: Read a line.\n            Step 2: Extract the first token (by removing leading spaces and then taking until next space or end of string).\n\n        But note: the first program does not care about spaces? because the tokenizer removes them. \n\n        Alternatively, we can read the first token? Fortran has list-directed input that reads tokens. \n\n        However, the problem says: the input is the same. So if the input is:\n\n            \"  0B1,B  \"\n\n        then the first program would take the token \"0B1,B\" (without the spaces). \n\n        How to do in Fortran? \n\n        We can read the entire line and then extract the first word? \n\n        Example: \n\n            read(*, '(a)') line\n            ! Now find the first non-blank and then until next blank\n            ! Or we can use internal read.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            character(1000) :: line, token\n            read(*, '(a)') line\n            ! Now extract the first token: \n            token = adjustl(line)   ! remove leading spaces\n            ! Now find the first space and take the substring until that?\n            idx = index(token, ' ')\n            if (idx > 0) then\n                token = token(1:idx-1)\n            else\n                token = trim(token)\n            end if\n\n        But note: the token might be empty? \n\n        However, the problem says the input? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use Fortran's internal file reading with list-directed input? \n\n        Let me do:\n\n            read(line, *) token   ! this will read the first token\n\n        But note: this will remove leading and trailing spaces? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            read(line, *) token\n\n        This reads the first token from the string `line` and stores in `token`. \n\n        But if the entire line is empty, then token will be undefined? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            token = ''\n            read(line, *, iostat=ios) token\n            if (ios /= 0) then\n                token = ''\n            end if\n\n        But the problem does not specify that the input is empty? \n\n        However, to be safe, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Read the entire line.\n            Step 2: Extract the first token.\n\n        Then process that token as in the first program.\n\n        Then, after processing, we have a string (the result of the first program). Then we replace every comma in that string by a space? \n\n        But note: the second program replaces every comma by a space. \n\n        However, the output of the first program is a string without commas? because the first program only outputs '0' and '1'. But wait: the input to the first program might have commas? and the first program ignores them? so they are not in the output? \n\n        Therefore, the second program will never see a comma? \n\n        Then why the second program? \n\n        Actually, the example input \"0B1,B\" to the first program: the first program processes the token \"0B1,B\". The commas are ignored? so the output is the same as processing the token without commas? \n\n        But note: the token \"0B1,B\" is processed as:\n\n            '0' -> append -> \"0\"\n            'B' -> delete -> \"\"\n            '1' -> append -> \"1\"\n            ',' -> ignore -> remains \"1\"\n            'B' -> delete -> \"\"\n\n        So the output is empty. \n\n        Then the second program reads an empty string and outputs empty.\n\n        Therefore, the replacing commas step in the second program is redundant? because the first program removes commas by ignoring them? \n\n        But wait: the second program is designed to replace commas by spaces. It does not know that the first program has removed commas. \n\n        However, the chain is: the output of the first program is the input to the second. The first program's output is the string without commas (because it never outputs a comma). \n\n        Therefore, the replacing step will do nothing? \n\n        Why is the second program there? \n\n        Actually, the two programs are independent. The first program is from one problem and the second from another. The chain is arbitrary. \n\n        We must do exactly as the chain: \n\n          Step 1: Process the input string (first token) by the first program's logic: \n                  building a string with only '0' and '1', and deleting on 'B'\n\n          Step 2: Then, regardless of what the string is, replace every comma in that string by a space.\n\n        But note: the first program's output does not contain commas? so step2 does nothing? \n\n        However, to be faithful, we do the replacement.\n\n        But what if the first program's output by accident has a comma? \n\n        The first program only appends '0' and '1'. So no comma. \n\n        Therefore, we can skip the replacement? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must do the replacement even if it does nothing? \n\n        Since the first program never outputs a comma, the replacement is a no-op. But we still have to do it? \n\n        Yes, because if the first program were to change (but in the given code it doesn't) then the replacement would matter. \n\n        But the given code is fixed. \n\n        However, to be safe and follow the specification, we do the replacement.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the replacement is a no-op and skip it? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must include it.\n\n        Steps in Fortran:\n\n          Step 1: Read a line from input.\n          Step 2: Extract the first token from that line (as a string).\n          Step 3: Process the token: \n                  Initialize an empty string (or a character array) for the buffer.\n                  For each character in the token:\n                      if char is '0': append '0'\n                      if char is '1': append '1'\n                      if char is 'B': remove the last character (if the buffer is not empty)\n                      else: ignore (do nothing)\n          Step 4: Now, take the buffer string and replace every comma ',' by a space ' '.\n          Step 5: Output the result.\n\n        However, step 4: since the buffer string has no commas, this step does nothing. But we do it anyway.\n\n        But note: what if the first program's output is empty? then step4: replacing commas in an empty string is still empty.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          We'll use a character variable to hold the entire line and the token.\n\n          We'll use a string (or a character array) for the buffer. Since we don't know the maximum length, we can set a maximum length (say 1000 or 5000) and then use a string that we build.\n\n          How to build the buffer? \n\n            We can have:\n\n                character(10000) :: buffer = ''   ! initialize to empty\n                integer :: len_buf = 0\n\n            Then for each character in the token:\n\n                if char == '0': \n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n                if char == '1':\n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n                if char == 'B':\n                    if (len_buf > 0) then\n                        len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                    end if\n\n            Then the result of the first step is buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n          Then we do:\n\n            do i = 1, len_buf\n                if (buffer(i:i) == ',') then\n                    buffer(i:i) = ' '\n                end if\n            end do\n\n          Then output buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n        But note: the second program outputs the entire string (without extra spaces) and then a newline? \n\n        The second program does: System.out.println(sb) -> which is the entire string and a newline.\n\n        But in Fortran, we can do:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n        However, what if the buffer is empty? Then we output nothing and then a newline? \n\n        That matches the second program: it outputs the string (which is empty) and then a newline.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs the buffer and then a newline. Then the second program reads that entire line (without the newline) and replaces commas. Then outputs and appends a newline? \n\n        Actually, the entire chain:\n\n            Program1: output = buffer_string + newline\n            Program2: reads the line (so without the newline) -> then replaces commas -> then outputs the result and appends a newline.\n\n        So the final output is: (buffer_string without commas) + newline.\n\n        But we are skipping the intermediate I/O. So we are going to output: (after replacing commas in buffer_string) and then a newline.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the second program does not see the newline from the first program? because when reading a line, the newline is consumed and not part of the string.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          program chained\n          implicit none\n          character(10000) :: line, token, buffer\n          integer :: i, len_buf, ios, n\n\n          !

Step 3: Process the token\n          len_buf = 0\n          buffer = ''   ! initialize\n\n          do i = 1, len_trim(token)\n              if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                  if (len_buf < len(buffer)) then\n                      len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                      buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n                  else\n                      ! We run out of buffer space? \n                      ! We can extend? but we set 10000, so if token is 10000 and then we have to append? but then B might remove? \n                      ! But the problem says the input? we assume 10000 is enough?\n                      ! If not, we can use a larger buffer? \n                      ! But the problem does not specify, we assume 10000 is safe.\n                      len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                      buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n                  end if\n              else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                  if (len_buf < len(buffer)) then\n                      len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                      buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n                  else\n                      len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                      buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n                  end if\n              else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                  if (len_buf > 0) then\n                      len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                  end if\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Now buffer(1:len_buf) is the output of the first program.\n\n          ! Step 4: Replace every comma by a space in the string buffer(1:len_buf)\n          do i = 1, len_buf\n              if (buffer(i:i) == ',') then\n                  buffer(i:i) = ' '\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Step 5: Output the result (which is buffer(1:len_buf) and a newline)\n          write(*, '(a)') buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n          end program chained\n\n        But note: what if the token is very long? We set buffer to 10000. But the token might be 10000? and then we append? but we start with 0, then we might have up to 10000? \n\n        We set buffer as character(10000) -> it can hold 10000 characters. But we are building the buffer from the token (which is at most 10000). And we are doing deletions. So the buffer length will not exceed the token length? \n\n        So 10000 is safe? \n\n        We assume the input length is at most 10000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the buffer to the same length as the token? \n\n        But we already read the entire line in a variable of 10000. So we can set the buffer to 10000.\n\n        However, to be safe, we can set:\n\n            character(100000) :: buffer   ! if needed\n\n        But the problem does not specify, so we choose 10000 as the original Java programs use BufferedReader which is also bounded.\n\n        Let me check the original: \n\n            The first Java program uses a StringBuilder. It can grow as needed.\n\n        But Fortran has fixed length strings. We must choose a maximum.\n\n        We'll set 10000 for the input line and the buffer.\n\n        But note: the token might be up to 10000? and then the buffer might be up to 10000? \n\n        So we set:\n\n            character(10000) :: line, token, buffer\n\n        However, the token is extracted from line (which is 10000). So the token can be up to 10000? \n\n        Then the buffer is built from the token: we append and delete. So the buffer can be up to 10000? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But what if the input line is longer than 10000? \n\n        Then we read only 10000 characters? \n\n        We can set:\n\n            character(100000) :: line, token, buffer\n\n        to be safe? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we choose a large number. \n\n        However, the original Java programs use BufferedReader which by default has a buffer size? but we don't know. \n\n        We'll set 100000 to be safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            integer, parameter :: MAX_LEN = 100000\n            character(MAX_LEN) :: line = '', token = '', buffer = ''\n\n        Then:\n\n          read(*, '(a)') line   ! will read up to MAX_LEN characters\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the token extraction: if the line is very long, we only take the first token? which might be up to MAX_LEN? \n\n        But then we process the token: the do loop runs for the length of the token (which is at most MAX_LEN) and we have buffer of MAX_LEN, so it's safe.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            program chained\n            implicit none\n            integer, parameter :: MAX_LEN = 100000\n            character(MAX_LEN) :: line, token, buffer\n            integer :: i, len_buf, ios, pos\n\n            ! Step 1: Read entire line\n            read(*, '(a)', iostat=ios) line\n            ! If read fails, set line to empty\n            if (ios /= 0) then\n                line = ''\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 2: Extract the first token (first word)\n            ! Remove leading spaces\n            token = adjustl(line)\n            ! Find the next space or tab? \n            pos = index(token, ' ')\n            if (pos > 0) then\n                token = token(1:pos-1)\n            else\n                token = trim(token)\n            end if\n\n            ! Now token holds the first token (without leading/trailing spaces? adjustl removes leading, and we take until first space so trailing are not there? but we take until the first space, so no trailing spaces)\n\n            ! Step 3: Process the token\n            len_buf = 0\n            buffer = ''   ! initialize to blanks? but we are going to assign by position\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(token)\n                if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n                else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n                else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                    if (len_buf > 0) then\n                        len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n                ! Other characters are ignored\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 4: Replace commas by spaces in the string buffer(1:len_buf)\n            do i = 1, len_buf\n                if (buffer(i:i) == ',') then\n                    buffer(i:i) = ' '\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 5: Output the result\n            if (len_buf > 0) then\n                write(*, '(a)') buffer(1:len_buf)\n            else\n                write(*, *)   ! output a newline (for empty string)\n                ! But note: if len_buf==0, then buffer(1:0) is an empty string? \n                ! We can do:\n                !   write(*, '(a)') ''\n                ! which outputs a newline? \n                ! Alternatively, we can output buffer(1:len_buf) which is empty -> then write outputs a newline? \n                ! Let me test: \n                !   character(10) :: s = ''\n                !   write(*, '(a)') s(1:0)   -> this is an empty string? \n                !   Actually, in Fortran, substring s(1:0) is an empty string.\n                !   Then write(*, '(a)') '' will output a newline? \n                !   Yes, it outputs a blank line (just a newline).\n            end if\n\n            end program\n\n        But note: the second program outputs the string and then a newline. So if the string is empty, we output a newline. \n\n        Therefore, we can always do:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') buffer(1:len_buf)\n\n        This will output the substring (which might be empty) and then a newline.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, what if the buffer is exactly MAX_LEN? Then buffer(1:len_buf) is the whole buffer? \n\n        But note: we are building the buffer: we never exceed MAX_LEN because we set len_buf and we break if we try to append beyond MAX_LEN? Actually, we don't break, but we set the character in the buffer. Since the buffer is of length MAX_LEN, we can have len_buf up to MAX_LEN. Then buffer(1:len_buf) is the entire string? \n\n        But if we try to append beyond MAX_LEN, then we are writing beyond the buffer? \n\n        We must avoid that. \n\n        How? \n\n          We set the buffer to MAX_LEN. Then the maximum len_buf we can have is MAX_LEN. \n\n          We do:\n\n              if (len_buf < MAX_LEN) then\n                  len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                  ... \n              else\n                  ! what? we cannot append -> so we ignore? \n                  ! But the problem does not specify. \n                  ! The original Java program uses a StringBuilder that can grow. \n                  ! But we have fixed length.\n\n          We can instead:\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(token)\n                if (token(i:i) == '0' .or. token(i:i) == '1') then\n                    if (len_buf < MAX_LEN) then\n                        len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                        buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = token(i:i)\n                    else\n                        ! ignore? \n                    end if\n                else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                    if (len_buf > 0) then\n                        len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        But the problem says the input? we assume the input token is such that the buffer does not exceed MAX_LEN? \n\n        However, to be safe, we add a condition: only append if we have space.\n\n        But note: the token is at most MAX_LEN, and we start with 0, then we append at most the number of '0' and '1' which is <= len_trim(token). So the buffer will never exceed MAX_LEN? \n\n        Actually, we start at 0 and then we do at most len_trim(token) appends? but we also have deletes. So the buffer length is at most the number of appends? which is at most the number of '0' and '1' in the token? which is <= len_trim(token) <= MAX_LEN. \n\n        Therefore, we are safe without condition? \n\n        But we set the buffer to MAX_LEN, and we are appending at most MAX_LEN characters? so we don't need to check? \n\n        However, if the token is MAX_LEN and all are '0' and '1', then we will append MAX_LEN times -> and then len_buf becomes MAX_LEN -> which is valid for the buffer (since buffer has length MAX_LEN). \n\n        But note: in Fortran, a character variable of length MAX_LEN can have a string of length MAX_LEN. So we can assign buffer(i:i) for i from 1 to MAX_LEN. \n\n        Therefore, we can remove the condition? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            do i = 1, len_trim(token)\n                if (token(i:i) == '0') then\n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '0'\n                else if (token(i:i) == '1') then\n                    len_buf = len_buf + 1\n                    buffer(len_buf:len_buf) = '1'\n                else if (token(i:i) == 'B') then\n                    if (len_buf > 0) then\n                        len_buf = len_buf - 1\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Without condition? \n\n        But if the token has more than MAX_LEN non-B characters? \n\n        But the token is at most MAX_LEN, so the number of non-B characters is at most MAX_LEN. \n\n        Therefore, len_buf will not exceed MAX_LEN. \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Final code:\n\n          program chained\n          implicit none\n          integer, parameter :: MAX_LEN = 100000\n          character(MAX_LEN) :: line, token, buffer\n          integer :: i, len_buf, ios, pos\n\n          !
