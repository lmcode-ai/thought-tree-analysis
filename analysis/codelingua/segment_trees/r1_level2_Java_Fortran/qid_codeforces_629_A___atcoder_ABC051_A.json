Then the output is 2. The second program: reads \"2\", replaces commas (none) -> outputs \"2\". So the Fortran program should output \"2\". But note: the example I used in the first program? The example input was 3 and then three strings: \".C.\", \"C.C\", \".C.\". Actually, the first string: \".C.\" has three characters? Then the grid is 3x3. Therefore, the Fortran program should work.

But the token is without spaces? Therefore, we do:\n\n        allocate(character(len=100) :: grid(n)) do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we process the first n characters of each grid(i). But note: the grid(i) might have the token stored in the first n characters and the rest are spaces. Then when we do:\n\n        grid(k)(i:i)   for i from 1 to n: it will be the token. And for i>n, it would be space? But we don't go beyond n. So it's safe. Alternatively, we can set the length of `grid` to n? Then we read:\n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n)) do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we have exactly n characters per row. But if the input token is longer than n? Then it would be truncated? But the problem says the token is of length n. So it should be safe. But the input token is exactly n? Then we can set the length to n.\n\n   I'll change to:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: grid(:)\n        ... \n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n)) do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we can index from 1 to n for the columns. This is better. Revised:\n\n        integer :: n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: grid(:)\n        ...\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n)) do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we use:\n\n        grid(k)(i:i)   for i in 1..n\n\n   and similarly for rows. This avoids extra spaces. But note: the Fortran standard requires that the length of the character variable in the read must be at least the length of the token. Since the token is n, and we set the length to n, it's safe.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nStep 1: Understand the first program (codeforces_629_A)\n- It reads an integer `num`.\n- Then reads `num` strings and stores them in a list `arr`.\n- It then processes the list in two passes:\n   a. For each column index `i`, count the number of 'C' in that column (over all rows). Then, for that column, it adds `counter*(counter-1)/2` to `fine` and resets `counter`.\n   b. For each row index `i`, count the number of 'C' in that row (over all columns). Similarly, it adds `counter*(counter-1)/2` to `fine` and resets `counter`.\n- Finally, it prints `fine`.\n\nStep 2: Understand the second program (atcoder_ABC051_A)\n- It reads a string `a` from standard input.\n- It replaces every comma (',') in the string with a space (' ').\n- Then it prints the modified string.\n\nBut note: the entire sequence means that the output of the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n\nHowever, the first program outputs a single integer (the value of `fine`). The second program expects a string that may contain commas. \n\nBut the first program's output is an integer (without commas). Therefore, the second program would read that integer as a string and then replace commas (if any) with spaces. Since the integer string does not have commas, the output of the second program would be the same integer string.\n\nBut wait: the problem states that the programs are executed in sequence, so the output of the first is the input to the second. The first program outputs an integer (as a string without any commas). The second program replaces commas by spaces. Since there are no commas, the output of the second program would be the same integer.\n\nHowever, this does not match the intended purpose of the second program. The second program was designed to process a string that contains commas (like \"a,b,c\") and replace them by spaces. \n\nBut note: the input to the entire sequence is the input to the first program. The first program expects:\n   - an integer `num`\n   - then `num` strings (each of length `num`)\n\nThe output of the first program is the integer `fine`. This integer is then fed as the input to the second program. The second program reads a line and replaces commas by spaces. Since the integer has no commas, the output of the second program is the same integer.\n\nBut the original chain: \n   Input to the chain: \n        first program's input: \n             num\n             string1\n             string2\n             ...\n             string_num\n   Output of the chain: the integer `fine` (unchanged by the second program).\n\nSo the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? Then why the second program?\n\nActually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Therefore, the output of the first program (the integer) is the input to the second program, and the second program outputs that integer (without commas) as a string. \n\nBut note: the second program reads a whole line. The first program outputs the integer and then a newline? The Java `System.out.println` outputs the integer and then a newline. So the second program reads a line containing the integer.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain: \n   Input: the grid (as described for the first program)\n   Output: the integer (without any commas) and then the second program outputs the same integer (with no commas to replace) and then a newline.\n\nSo the net effect is the same as the first program? Then why the second program?\n\nWait, let's reconsider: the problem says we have two programs. The first program outputs an integer. The second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. \n\nBut the integer output by the first program is a string of digits and a newline. The second program will read that entire line (without the newline? Actually, `BufferedReader.readLine()` in Java does not include the newline). Then the second program replaces commas by spaces (there are none) and then prints the string (which is the integer) and then (in the second program) we use `System.out.println(sb)` which appends a newline.\n\nSo the entire chain: \n   Input: \n        3\n        .C.\n        C.C\n        .C.\n   Output of first: 5\n   Then the second program reads \"5\", replaces commas (none) -> \"5\", then prints \"5\" (with a newline).\n\nSo the chain outputs the same as the first program? \n\nBut note: the second program was designed for a different input. However, in the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a string representation of an integer.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\nBut wait: what if the first program outputs a number that has commas? It doesn't. The first program outputs the integer without any formatting.\n\nTherefore, the second program in the chain is redundant? \n\nHowever, the problem requires to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program.\n\nWe have two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: The chain is as described. We run the first program and then the second program on the output of the first. The output of the chain is the same integer.\n\nBut note: the input to the chain is the grid. The output is the integer. Therefore, the entire chain does the same as the first program. The second program does nothing because there are no commas.\n\nPossibility 2: The problem might have intended that the two programs are independent and meant to be run on the same original input? But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nTherefore, we must design a Fortran program that:\n\n   Step 1: Reads the input for the first program (an integer `n` and then `n` strings of length `n`).\n   Step 2: Computes the value `fine` as in the first program.\n   Step 3: Then, instead of printing, we pass this integer to the next step (the second program) as a string.\n   Step 4: The second step: take the integer string and replace any commas by spaces. But note: the integer string has no commas. So we leave it unchanged.\n   Step 5: Then output the string (which is the integer).\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain reads a whole line. The first program outputs the integer and a newline. The second program reads the integer (without the newline) because `readLine()` in Java drops the newline. Then it outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\nSo the output of the chain is the integer and a newline.\n\nTherefore, we can simply do:\n\n   - Read the grid and compute `fine`.\n   - Then output `fine` (as an integer) with a newline.\n\nBut wait: the second program might have done more? What if the first program output had commas? It doesn't. So we can ignore the second program? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is to output the integer. So we can just do the first program and output the integer? \n\nHowever, we must be cautious: what if the first program outputs a string that has commas? It doesn't. The first program outputs an integer via `System.out.println(fine)`. The integer `fine` is printed in base 10 without any commas.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program. The second program doesn't change the output.\n\nBut the problem requires to translate the entire sequence. So we must simulate the chain.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Read the grid and compute `fine`.\n   Step 2: Convert `fine` to a string (without commas, so no change needed) and then output that string.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs the string and then a newline. The first program also outputs a newline. So the chain outputs the integer and then two newlines? \n\nActually, the first program outputs:\n   System.out.println(fine);   -> prints the integer and a newline.\n\nThen the second program reads a line (the integer without the trailing newline) and then outputs the string and a newline.\n\nSo the chain outputs:\n   [integer string] + newline   (from the second program)\n\nBut the first program already output a newline? Then the input to the second program is the integer and a newline? \n\nNo: the second program uses `BufferedReader.readLine()`, which reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed, a carriage return, or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. The `readLine` returns the string without the line terminator.\n\nTherefore, the input to the second program is the integer as a string without the newline. Then the second program outputs the string (without commas) and then a newline.\n\nSo the chain outputs the integer and then one newline.\n\nIn the first program alone, we output the integer and then one newline.\n\nTherefore, the chain has the same output as the first program.\n\nBut to be faithful, we should design the Fortran program to:\n\n   - Read the grid (as the first program does)\n   - Compute `fine`\n   - Then output `fine` as an integer with a newline.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\".\n\nBut note: the second program is the last block? So the last block (the second program) does the output. In our Fortran program, we must have:\n\n   - The first block: read the grid and compute `fine` (from the first program) without outputting.\n   - The intermediate step: take the integer `fine` and process it as the second program (which is replacing commas by spaces). But there are no commas, so it's a no-op.\n   - The last block: output the string (which is the integer).\n\nBut the second program does not output an integer, it outputs a string. So we must output the string representation of the integer.\n\nIn Fortran, we can write an integer to a string and then output that string. But note: the second program outputs without commas, so we are just outputting the integer as a string.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the integer directly? But the second program might have done formatting? It doesn't. It just replaces commas by spaces.\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n   Step 1: Read the integer `n`.\n   Step 2: Read `n` strings (each of length `n`).\n   Step 3: Compute `fine` (exactly as the first Java program).\n   Step 4: Convert `fine` to a string (without any commas) and then output that string.\n\nBut note: the second program outputs the string and then a newline. So we must output a newline.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, when we write with `print *,` or `write(*,*)` it adds a newline. But we are required to have the same behavior.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the integer without converting to string? The problem says the last block should produce output. And the last block in the chain is the second program which outputs a string. So we must output a string? \n\nBut the integer is the same as its string representation without commas.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   write(*, '(I0)') fine\n\nThis writes the integer without any extra spaces and without commas, and then a newline? \n\nBut note: the original chain outputs the integer and a newline. And the second program outputs the integer (without commas) and then a newline.\n\nSo we can simply output the integer with a newline.\n\nBut the problem says: the last block should be the second program. And the second program outputs a string that has commas replaced by spaces. Since there are no commas, we can just output the integer as a string.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate the second program: take the integer, convert to a string, then replace commas by spaces (but there are none), then output the string.\n\nBut that is redundant.\n\nHowever, to be safe and follow the problem literally, we can:\n\n   - Compute `fine` (an integer)\n   - Convert `fine` to a string (call it `str_fine`)\n   - Then create a new string by replacing every comma in `str_fine` by a space (but there won't be any)\n   - Then output the new string\n\nBut note: the integer `fine` is printed without commas. So `str_fine` has no commas. Therefore, the replacing does nothing.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must do the replacement? \n\nBut the second program does the replacement. Therefore, we must do:\n\n   character(len=20) :: str_fine, output_str\n   write(str_fine, *) fine   ! This might have leading spaces? \n   ! But note: the second program reads the entire line and then replaces commas by spaces.\n\nHowever, the integer we get from the first program is printed without any commas and without any extra formatting? The Java program prints the integer as base 10 without any formatting. \n\nIn Fortran, we can write the integer to a string without leading spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n   write(str_fine, '(I0)') fine   ! This writes the integer with no leading spaces.\n\nThen we do:\n\n   output_str = str_fine   ! and then we replace commas by spaces? But there are none.\n\nBut note: the string might have commas? It won't. So we can skip the replacement? \n\nBut to be faithful, we can do:\n\n   do i = 1, len_trim(str_fine)\n      if (str_fine(i:i) == ',') then\n          str_fine(i:i) = ' '\n      end if\n   end do\n\nThen we output the trimmed string? \n\nBut note: the second program does not trim the string. It replaces commas by spaces. And the integer string has no commas, so it remains the same.\n\nBut the second program outputs the entire string (which is the integer) and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   write(*, '(a)') trim(adjustl(str_fine))\n\nBut wait: the integer might be negative? The problem does not say. The first program: `fine` is computed by sums of combinations. It is nonnegative.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   Steps:\n      Read n and the grid.\n      Compute fine.\n      Convert fine to a string without commas and without leading spaces.\n      Output that string.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java outputs the string exactly as it is (with the commas replaced) and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n   We'll read the grid, compute `fine`, convert `fine` to a string without any extra formatting (like leading spaces), then output the string.\n\nHowever, the second program does not remove leading spaces. It replaces commas. So if the integer string has leading spaces, we must output them? \n\nBut the Java `System.out.println(fine)` does not output leading spaces for positive integers. It outputs the integer in base 10 without any extra formatting. \n\nIn Fortran, if we write:\n\n   write(str_fine, '(I0)') fine\n\nit will write without leading spaces. Then we can output that string.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the string conversion and output the integer? But the problem says the last block should be the second program which outputs a string. So we are simulating the second program by outputting a string.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n   program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, k, counter, fine\n      character(len=100), allocatable :: grid(:)\n      character(len=20) :: str_fine\n      integer :: io_status\n\n      ! Read n\n      read(*,*) n\n      allocate(grid(n))\n\n      ! Read n lines\n      do i = 1, n\n         read(*,*) grid(i)\n         ! Note: the Java program reads tokens without spaces? But the problem says each string is of length n.\n         ! In Fortran, we assume each line is a string of exactly n characters? \n         ! However, the input might have spaces? The problem says: the input for the first program: \n         !   first integer n, then n strings (each of length n). \n         ! The Java program uses `sc.next()` which reads tokens (without spaces). So each token is a string of n characters.\n         ! Therefore, we can read each token as a string of length n.\n\n         ! But note: if the input line has more than n characters? We assume the token is exactly n characters.\n         ! We can read the next n characters? Or we can read the next token and take the first n characters?\n         ! Actually, the Java `sc.next()` reads the next token (by default delimited by whitespace). So each string is without spaces and of length n.\n\n         ! Therefore, we read a token of length n? In Fortran, if we do:\n         !   read(*,*) grid(i)\n         ! then it will read the next token (which is a string of n characters) and store it in grid(i). But we must set the length of grid(i) to at least n.\n\n         ! We allocated grid as character(len=100). We set the length to 100 to be safe. But we only use the first n characters.\n\n      end do\n\n      fine = 0\n      counter = 0\n\n      ! First pass: by columns\n      do i = 1, n\n         do k = 1, n\n            if (grid(k)(i:i) == 'C') then\n               counter = counter + 1\n            end if\n         end do\n         fine = fine + (counter * (counter-1)) / 2\n         counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Second pass: by rows\n      do i = 1, n\n         do k = 1, n\n            if (grid(i)(k:k) == 'C') then\n               counter = counter + 1\n            end if\n         end do\n         fine = fine + (counter * (counter-1)) / 2\n         counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Now, we have the integer `fine`. This is the output of the first program.\n\n      ! Now, we simulate the second program: we convert `fine` to a string and replace commas by spaces (if any).\n      write(str_fine, '(I0)') fine   ! This writes the integer without any leading/trailing spaces and without commas.\n\n      ! Now, we want to replace any commas in `str_fine` by spaces? But there are none.\n\n      ! However, to be generic, we do:\n      do i = 1, len_trim(str_fine)\n         if (str_fine(i:i) == ',') then\n            str_fine(i:i) = ' '\n         end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the string (without any extra spaces? The second program outputs the entire string and then a newline)\n      write(*, '(a)') trim(str_fine)   ! We trim to remove trailing spaces? But the integer has no trailing spaces? \n      ! Actually, the integer string has no trailing spaces. But we wrote with I0, so no leading spaces and no trailing spaces? \n      ! However, the second program outputs the entire string (including any leading or trailing) but the I0 doesn't add any.\n\n      ! But note: the second program outputs the entire line that it read? Actually, it outputs the string that it built by replacing commas. \n      ! In our case, we built `str_fine` without any extra spaces. And we are replacing commas (if any) by spaces. Then we output the entire string? \n\n      ! However, the second program in Java does: `System.out.println(sb)`, which is the entire string and then a newline.\n\n      ! So we output the entire string (without trimming) but note: the string `str_fine` might have trailing spaces? \n      ! How did we write? We used `write(str_fine, '(I0)') fine` and `str_fine` is of length 20. The integer might be 1 digit, then the rest are spaces? \n\n      ! The second program in Java would output the entire string including the trailing spaces? \n\n      ! Actually, the second program in Java reads a line (without the newline) and then replaces commas. The line is the integer without trailing spaces? \n\n      ! How does the first program output the integer? It uses `System.out.println(fine)`. The integer is output without any extra spaces? \n      ! Yes, for example, if `fine=5`, it outputs \"5\\n\". The second program reads the line and gets the string \"5\" (without the newline). Then it outputs \"5\\n\". \n\n      ! In Fortran, when we write `str_fine` with `I0`, we get the integer without any spaces. But the variable `str_fine` is of length 20. The rest of the string is filled with spaces? \n\n      ! We want to output the integer without any extra spaces? Then we should output the trimmed string? \n\n      ! But the second program outputs the entire line (without the newline) that it read? Actually, the second program outputs the entire string that it built (which is the same as the input string without commas) and then a newline. \n\n      ! The input string to the second program is the integer without the trailing newline. And the integer is without any trailing spaces. \n\n      ! Therefore, we should output the non-space part of `str_fine`. \n\n      ! How about:\n\n      !   write(*, '(a)') trim(str_fine)\n\n      ! This removes trailing spaces. But the integer string has no trailing spaces? Actually, the integer string is written without leading or trailing spaces by the I0 format. However, the variable `str_fine` is a fixed-length string. The rest of the characters are spaces. We don't want to output the trailing spaces.\n\n      ! So we output `trim(str_fine)`.\n\n      deallocate(grid)\n   end program combined\n\nBut note: in the first pass, we are indexing the string as `grid(k)(i:i)`. In Fortran, the first dimension of the array is the row. But in the first pass, the first Java program iterates:\n\n   for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {\n      for (int k = 0; k < num; k++) {\n          if (arr.get(k).charAt(i) == 'C') ...\n\n   This means: row index `k` and column index `i`. \n\n   In our Fortran, we have `grid(k)(i:i)` which is the i-th character of the k-th string. This is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the second pass: `grid(i)(k:k)` is the k-th character of the i-th string.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nLet me test with the example:\n\n   Input: \n        3\n        .C.\n        C.C\n        .C.\n\n   First pass (columns):\n        Column0: '.' in row0, 'C' in row1, '.' in row2 -> 1 'C' -> 0\n        Column1: 'C' in row0, '.' in row1, 'C' in row2 -> 2 'C' -> 1\n        Column2: '.' in row0, 'C' in row1, '.' in row2 -> 1 'C' -> 0\n        Total from columns: 1\n\n   Second pass (rows):\n        Row0: \".C.\" -> 1 'C' -> 0\n        Row1: \"C.C\" -> 2 'C' -> 1\n        Row2: \".C.\" -> 1 'C' -> 0\n        Total from rows: 1\n\n   So `fine` = 1+1 = 2? \n\n   But wait, the example in the first program: the example input \"3\\n.C.\\nC.C\\n.C.\" is provided? The first program actually:\n\n        First pass (columns):\n            column0: [ row0: '.', row1: 'C', row2: '.' ] -> 1 -> 0\n            column1: [ row0: 'C', row1: '.', row2: 'C' ] -> 2 -> 1\n            column2: [ row0: '.', row1: 'C', row2: '.' ] -> 1 -> 0\n            -> 1\n\n        Second pass (rows):\n            row0: \".C.\" -> 1 -> 0\n            row1: \"C.C\" -> 2 -> 1\n            row2: \".C.\" -> 1 -> 0\n            -> 1\n\n        Total = 2.\n\n   Then the output is 2.\n\n   The second program: reads \"2\", replaces commas (none) -> outputs \"2\".\n\n   So the Fortran program should output \"2\".\n\n   But note: the example I used in the first program? The example input was 3 and then three strings: \".C.\", \"C.C\", \".C.\".\n\n   Actually, the first string: \".C.\" has three characters? Then the grid is 3x3.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program should work.\n\n   However, note: the first program reads the strings without spaces. In Fortran, if we read with:\n\n        read(*,*) grid(i)\n\n   and the input line is \".C.\" (without spaces), then it will read the entire token. But if the token is longer than the allocated length? We set the length to 100, so it should be safe for n up to 100.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the maximum n, but we can assume n<=100.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the line as:\n\n        read(*, '(A)') grid(i)\n\n   and then take the first n characters? But the input token is exactly n characters? \n\n   The problem says: each string is of length n.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        read(*, '(A)') grid(i)\n\n   and then we only care about the first n characters? But the rest of the line might be ignored? \n\n   However, the input for each row is a single token of n characters. The next token is on the next line? \n\n   We are reading one line per row. So we can do:\n\n        read(*, '(A)') grid(i)\n\n   and then we know the first n characters are the string. The rest of the string (if the line has more than n characters) would be stored? But we only care about the first n.\n\n   But note: the grid(i) is of length 100. We read the entire line? But the line has exactly n characters? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: each string is of length n. So the line should have exactly n characters? \n\n   But the example: the first line after the integer is \".C.\" which is 3 characters? \n\n   However, if the input has more than n characters? Then we only take the first n. \n\n   But the Java program reads tokens. The token is exactly n characters? \n\n   So we can read the entire line and then take the first n characters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can read the line and then assign:\n\n        grid(i) = the entire line? But we only need the first n.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        character(len=100) :: line\n        read(*, '(A)') line\n        grid(i) = line(1:n)\n\n   But that would be safe. However, the problem says the string is exactly of length n. So we can read the next n characters? \n\n   But the input may have the string and then a newline? We want to read the next n characters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then extract the first n non-space characters? But the problem says no spaces.\n\n   Since the problem says the input is tokens without spaces, we can read the token with:\n\n        read(*, *) grid(i)(1:n)\n\n   But that might not work because the token might be stored in the entire variable? \n\n   Actually, the simpler way is to read the entire line and then take the first n characters. \n\n   But note: the input might have trailing spaces? The problem says each string is of length n. So the first n characters are the string.\n\n   So let me change the reading:\n\n        character(len=100) :: line\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*, '(A)') line\n            grid(i) = line(1:n)\n        end do\n\n   This ensures we take the first n characters of the line.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        read(*, '(A)') grid(i)\n\n   and then we know that the first n characters are the string? \n\n   But if the line has more than 100 characters? We set the length to 100, so we can only read 100. The problem doesn't specify n, but we assume n<=100.\n\n   We'll assume n<=100.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read with:\n\n        read(*, *) grid(i)\n\n   which will read the next token. The token is exactly n characters? Yes, because the token is the string of n characters. Then the variable `grid(i)` (which is 100 long) will have the token in the first n characters and the rest are undefined? Actually, in Fortran, when you read a token into a character variable, the entire variable is set: the token is stored left-justified and the rest is filled with spaces. But we don't want spaces? \n\n   We are comparing with 'C'. So if the rest of the string (beyond n) is spaces, then in the column loop when we do i from 1 to n, we are safe because we only look at the first n characters? \n\n   But the grid has n rows and n columns. We only care about the first n characters of each row.\n\n   So if we read the token with:\n\n        read(*, *) grid(i)\n\n   then the first n characters are the token? Actually, the token is stored in the variable without truncation? But if the token is longer than 100, it will be truncated? We assume n<=100.\n\n   And the token is exactly n characters. So we can do:\n\n        read(*, *) grid(i)\n\n   and then we use the first n characters.\n\n   But note: the first n characters are the token? And the rest are spaces? \n\n   Then in the column loop, when we do:\n\n        if (grid(k)(i:i) == 'C') \n\n   for i from 1 to n, we are safe because the token is in the first n characters. The rest are spaces, but we don't look beyond n.\n\n   So we can do either way.\n\n   I'll choose:\n\n        read(*, *) grid(i)\n\n   because it reads the token and discards any leading/trailing spaces? But the token is without spaces? \n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        allocate(character(len=100) :: grid(n))\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we process the first n characters of each grid(i).\n\n   But note: the grid(i) might have the token stored in the first n characters and the rest are spaces. Then when we do:\n\n        grid(k)(i:i)   for i from 1 to n: it will be the token.\n\n   And for i>n, it would be space? But we don't go beyond n.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the length of `grid` to n? Then we read:\n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n))\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we have exactly n characters per row. But if the input token is longer than n? Then it would be truncated? But the problem says the token is of length n. So it should be safe.\n\n   But the input token is exactly n? Then we can set the length to n.\n\n   I'll change to:\n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: grid(:)\n        ... \n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n))\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we can index from 1 to n for the columns.\n\n   This is better.\n\n   Revised:\n\n        integer :: n\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: grid(:)\n        ...\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n))\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*, *) grid(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then we use:\n\n        grid(k)(i:i)   for i in 1..n\n\n   and similarly for rows.\n\n   This avoids extra spaces.\n\n   But note: the Fortran standard requires that the length of the character variable in the read must be at least the length of the token. Since the token is n, and we set the length to n, it's safe.\n\n   Therefore, the final program:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, k, counter, fine\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: grid(:)\n      character(len=20) :: str_fine\n\n      read(*,*) n\n      allocate(character(len=n) :: grid(n))\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          read(*,*) grid(i)\n      end do\n\n      fine = 0\n      counter = 0\n\n      ! First pass: by columns\n      do i = 1, n\n          do k = 1, n\n              if (grid(k)(i:i) == 'C') then\n                  counter = counter + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n          fine = fine + (counter * (counter-1)) / 2\n          counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Second pass: by rows\n      do i = 1, n\n          do k = 1, n\n              if (grid(i)(k:k) == 'C') then\n                  counter = counter + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n          fine = fine + (counter * (counter-1)) / 2\n          counter = 0\n      end do\n\n      ! Convert fine to string\n      write(str_fine, '(I0)') fine\n\n      ! Replace commas by spaces (if any) - though there shouldn't be any\n      do i = 1, len_trim(str_fine)\n          if (str_fine(i:i) == ',') then\n              str_fine(i:i) = ' '\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Output the string\n      write(*, '(a)') trim(str_fine)\n\n      deallocate(grid)\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: the integer division in Fortran: (counter*(counter-1))/2. Since counter*(counter-1) is always even? Yes, because it's the combination formula. But if counter=0 or 1, then 0. So it's integer division? In Fortran, if both operands are integers, then the division is integer division. So it's the same as in Java.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nLet me test with n=1? \n\n   Input: \n        1\n        C\n\n   First pass: column1: [row1: 'C'] -> counter=1 -> 0\n   Second pass: row1: ['C'] -> counter=1 -> 0\n   fine=0.\n\n   But if n=1 and the only cell is 'C', then the row has one 'C' -> 0, the column has one 'C' -> 0. So total 0.\n\n   The program outputs 0.\n\n   Now, with n=2 and grid:\n        CC\n        CC\n\n   First pass: \n        column1: [row1:'C', row2:'C'] -> 2 -> 1\n        column2: [row1:'C', row2:'C'] -> 2 -> 1\n        -> 2\n   Second pass:\n        row1: \"CC\" -> 2 -> 1\n        row2: \"CC\" -> 2 -> 1\n        -> 2\n        total=4.\n\n   The program outputs 4.\n\n   Now, the second program: converts 4 to a string -> \"4\", then replaces commas (none) -> outputs \"4\".\n\n   So the Fortran program outputs \"4\".\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\nNote: we assume the input integer `n` is at most 100, and the integer `fine` can be stored in a Fortran integer (which is typically 4 or 8 bytes). The maximum `fine` is about O(n^2) since each row/column can have up to n 'C's, and the combination formula is O(n^2). For n=100, the maximum value per row/column is 100, so 100*99/2 = 4950, and then multiplied by 2 (for two passes) and then multiplied by 2? Actually, we do two passes: each pass adds up to 4950 per row/column. There are n rows and n columns? Actually, we do one row per row and one column per column. So total for rows: sum_{rows} (count_i*(count_i-1)/2) and similarly for columns. The maximum value for one row is 4950. There are 100 rows? But the maximum for one row is 4950, and then we add 100 such terms? Actually, no: each row independently. So the maximum total is 100 * 4950 = 495000? Similarly for columns: 495000. Total 990000. This fits in a 4-byte integer (max ~2e9).\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nFinal Fortran code:"
