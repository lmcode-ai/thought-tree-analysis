So we must find the maximum contiguous sum? but if all are negative, we take the maximum (least negative) contiguous segment. However, Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray without the constraint of non-emptiness: we can do:\n\n             max_ending_here = b(1)\n             max_so_far = b(1) do i=2, n\n                 max_ending_here = max(b(i), max_ending_here+b(i)) max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n          Then result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          But note: the segment must be non-empty? Yes, because we are forced to flip at least one element. Let's test with [1,1,1]:\n            b = [-1, -1, -1]\n            max_ending_here: \n                i=1: max_ending_here = -1, max_so_far=-1\n                i=2: max_ending_here = max(-1, -1 + -1) = max(-1,-2) = -1 -> max_so_far = max(-1,-1) = -1\n                i=3: max_ending_here = max(-1, -1 + -1)=max(-1,-2)=-1 -> max_so_far=-1\n\n            Then result = 3 + (-1) = 2 -> correct. Now [1,0,0,1,0] (n=5): \n            arr = [1,0,0,1,0]\n            total_ones = 2\n            b = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]\n\n            We run Kadane:\n                i=1: max_ending_here = -1, max_so_far=-1\n                i=2: max_ending_here = max(1, -1+1)=max(1,0)=1 -> max_so_far = max(-1,1)=1\n                i=3: max_ending_here = max(1, 1+1)=max(1,2)=2 -> max_so_far=2\n                i=4: max_ending_here = max(-1, 2-1)=max(-1,1)=1 -> max_so_far=2\n                i=5: max_ending_here = max(1, 1+1)=2 -> max_so_far=2\n\n            Then result = 2+2 = 4. Check: flip the segment [2,5]: \n                Original: [1,0,0,1,0] -> flip [0,0,1,0] becomes [1,1,1,0,1] -> ones: 4 -> correct. So we can replace the first program with:\n\n          total_ones = count of ones\n          b = array of -1 and 1 as above. max_so_far = b(1)\n          current = b(1)\n\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current+b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n        But note: the original program had a special case for n=1. We can handle with the same algorithm?\n\n          n=1: \n             total_ones: if arr(1)=1 -> 1, else 0.\n             b(1): if arr(1)=1 -> -1, else 1. Then max_so_far = b(1) = -1 or 1.\n\n             Then result = 1 + (-1)=0 -> if arr(1)=1 -> 0 -> correct. or = 0+1=1 -> if arr(1)=0 -> 1 -> correct. So we don't need a special case. Therefore, the first program can be replaced by the efficient method.",

The I0 format will write the minus sign and then the digits. There won't be commas. So we are safe. Let me test with the example [1,1,1] -> result=2. Steps:\n\n          str_result = '2' (and then 29 spaces)\n          trim(str_result) = '2'\n          write(*,'(a)') '2'   -> outputs \"2\\n\"\n\n        This matches. Now, what if the integer is large? Example: 1234567 -> I0 writes '1234567' (without commas) -> then we check for commas: none -> then output '1234567\\n'\n\n        Correct. However, note: the first program might output numbers that are negative? The result: total_ones (>=0) plus max_so_far (which can be negative). So the result can be negative? Example: [1,1] -> total_ones=2, max_so_far = max( -1, -1) = -1 (if we run Kadane on [-1,-1] -> the maximum contiguous segment is -1) -> result=1. But wait: flipping a segment of two ones: becomes zeros -> total ones=0? But wait:\n\n          We must flip exactly one contiguous segment. The best we can do: flip one element: then we get one 1 and one 0 -> ones=1. So result=1, positive. Actually, the result is always nonnegative? \n\n          total_ones >=0, and max_so_far >= -n? but the result = total_ones + max_so_far. The minimum total_ones is 0, and the minimum max_so_far is -n? then result >= -n? but n>=1, so it can be negative? Example: n=1, [1] -> result=0 -> nonnegative.\n\n          n=2, [1,1] -> result=1 -> nonnegative.",

Therefore, we are done. However, note: the original first program had a special case for n==1? But we are handling it in the same way? So we don't need the special case. We'll write the program as above. But note: the maximum contiguous sum might be negative? We are using the algorithm that allows negative? We are starting with max_so_far = b(1) and then updating from i=2. This handles negative. One more test: n=2, [1,1] -> \n            total_ones=2\n            b = [-1,-1]\n            max_so_far = -1\n            current = -1\n            i=2: current = max(-1, -1-1) = max(-1,-2) = -1 -> then max_so_far remains -1? result = 2 -1 = 1 -> correct.

We can use:\n\n          if (current > max_so_far) max_so_far = current That is the same. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current) But Fortran has the intrinsic function max? We can write:\n\n          max_so_far = max_so_far   ! no, we can use:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current) But note: max for integers is available. So we can replace:\n\n          if (current > max_so_far) max_so_far = current\n\n        with:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current) That is clearer. Therefore:\n\n          current = b(1)\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current+b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n        We'll use that. Final Fortran code:\n\n          program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, total_ones, max_so_far, current, result\n          integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, b\n          character(len=30) :: str_result\n\n          read(*,*) n\n          allocate(arr(n))\n          allocate(b(n)) do i = 1, n\n             read(*,*) arr(i)\n          end do\n\n          total_ones = 0\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (arr(i) == 1) total_ones = total_ones + 1\n          end do\n\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (arr(i) == 0) then\n                 b(i) = 1\n             else\n                 b(i) = -1\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          current = b(1)\n          max_so_far = b(1) do i = 2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current + b(i)) max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          write(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\n          do i = 1, len(str_result) if (str_result(i:i) == ',') then\n                 str_result(i:i) = ' '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          write(*, '(a)') trim(str_result)\n\n          deallocate(arr)\n          deallocate(b)\n          end program combined\n\n        This should be the complete program. Note: We assume the integers are read correctly.",

The original Java program: \n\n            int n = scanner.nextInt();\n            int arr[] = new int[n];\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        The scanner reads tokens (separated by whitespace). So the integers can be on one line or multiple. Similarly, in Fortran: \n\n            read(*,*) n   ! reads the first integer\n            then for the array: \n               do i=1, n\n                  read(*,*) arr(i)   ! reads one integer per line? But the format * is list-directed: it will read as many as available on one line. Example: if the input is:\n\n            3\n            1 0 0\n\n        Then the first read reads 3. Then the next read in the loop: \n            first iteration: reads the next token -> 1\n            second: 0\n            third: 0\n\n        That matches. But if the input is:\n\n            3\n            1\n            0\n            0\n\n        Then it also works. So we are safe. We output the string without any extra spaces and without commas. This is the final solution.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n\n The first Java program (codeforces_327_A) does:\n   - Reads an integer `n` and an array `arr` of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1).\n   - It then tries to find the maximum number of 1's achievable by flipping a contiguous subarray.\n   - However, note that the naive approach is O(n^3). We can optimize the idea: we are looking for the contiguous subarray that when flipped (0->1, 1->0) maximizes the total number of 1's.\n   - Actually, we can reframe: let A be the original array. Flipping a segment [i, j] changes:\n        1's in the segment become 0's, and 0's become 1's.\n        So the change in the total number of 1's is: (number of 0's in the segment) - (number of 1's in the segment) = (segment length) - 2*(number of 1's in the segment)\n        Therefore, the total 1's after flipping = original_total_ones - (ones in segment) + (zeros in segment)\n                 = original_total_ones + (segment length - 2 * ones_in_segment)\n                 = original_total_ones + (segment length) - 2 * ones_in_segment\n\n   - Alternatively, we can think of it as: we want to maximize (segment_length - 2 * ones_in_segment). Then the result is original_total_ones + max_gain.\n\n   - However, note: the problem is equivalent to \"maximum subarray sum\" on the array where we set:\n        b[i] = 1 if arr[i] == 0   (because we gain 1 by flipping 0 to 1)\n        b[i] = -1 if arr[i] == 1   (because we lose 1 by flipping 1 to 0)\n        Then the gain for flipping a segment is the sum of b[i] in that segment.\n\n        So max_gain = maximum subarray sum (using Kadane) on b.\n\n        Then total ones = original_ones + max_gain.\n\n   - But note: the problem allows not flipping? Actually we can flip any contiguous segment. And we are allowed to flip only one contiguous segment? Yes.\n\n   - However, the original program does consider flipping every contiguous segment and then counts the ones. We can do this more efficiently with Kadane.\n\n   - But the problem says: we are to combine two programs. The second program (atcoder_ABC051_A) simply reads a string and replaces commas with spaces.\n\n   - How are they chained?\n        The first program outputs an integer (the max ones) and then the second program takes that integer? But wait: the second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces.\n\n   - Actually, the second program doesn't depend on the first in the provided code? Let me see:\n\n        Example chain: \n          Input to the first program: \n              3\n              1 0 0 1 0  -> wait, the first integer is n, then n integers.\n\n          Output of the first program: an integer (for the example above, what is it?).\n\n          Then the second program takes that integer (as a string) and replaces commas by spaces? But the integer doesn't have commas.\n\n        However, the second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. So if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program reads \"5\" and outputs \"5\" (since there are no commas).\n\n        This doesn't change the output.\n\n   - Therefore, the entire chain: \n          Input: first integer n and then n integers (each 0 or 1)\n          Output: the integer result (max ones) without any commas.\n\n        But the second program would output the same as the first program's output? So why is it there?\n\n   - Actually, the second program in the example is designed for a different input: it reads a string with commas and replaces them by spaces. But in our chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is an integer. So no commas.\n\n        Therefore, the second program is effectively a no-op? \n\n   - However, we are instructed to translate the entire sequence. So we must chain:\n\n        Step 1: Run the first program on the initial input (n and the array) -> output an integer, say X.\n        Step 2: Run the second program on the string representation of X -> output the same X (because there are no commas).\n\n   - Therefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\n   - But note: the first program has a condition for n==1. We can do the efficient method:\n\n        Let total_ones = count of ones in the original array.\n        Create an array b:\n            b(i) = 1 if arr(i)==0\n            b(i) = -1 if arr(i)==1\n\n        Then we compute the maximum contiguous sum (max_ending_here, max_so_far) for b.\n\n        Then result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to flip any contiguous segment, but also we are allowed to flip nothing? Actually, the problem says we flip one contiguous segment. But note: flipping nothing is not allowed? Actually, the problem does not say we must flip. The original program considers flipping any contiguous segment (including flipping a segment of length 0? Actually, the loops go from i to j (inclusive) and j>=i, so length>=1? Actually, the inner loop j from i to n-1, so when i=j, we flip one element). But note: the problem does not require flipping? Actually, the problem says: \"Iahub can choose at most one contiguous segment\". So we can choose not to flip? Actually, the problem says \"at most\", meaning we can flip 0 or 1 contiguous segment. But the original program does not consider flipping zero segments? \n\n        Let me check the original program: \n            It iterates i and j (with j>=i) and flips the segment [i, j]. Then it counts the ones. Then it takes the maximum.\n\n        But note: if we flip zero segments, then we get the original array. So the original program does not consider the case of flipping zero? \n\n        However, the original program does consider every contiguous segment of at least length 1. But what if the best is to do nothing? Then we must have the original total_ones as a candidate? Actually, the original program does not consider the possibility of flipping an empty segment. So we must account for that.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"at most one\", meaning we can skip flipping. Therefore, the result should be at least the original total_ones.\n\n        How to fix? We can set: result = max(original_total_ones, total_ones + max_so_far) ? \n\n        However, note: flipping a segment might actually reduce the number of ones? Then we wouldn't want to flip. So we must consider not flipping? \n\n        But observe: the original program does not consider flipping zero segments. Therefore, we must include the possibility of flipping zero segments? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement of codeforces_327_A: \n            \"Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper. He writes n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Each integer can be either 0 or 1. We are allowed to choose exactly one contiguous segment and flip all numbers in this segment (changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0). What is the maximum number of 1 we can get?\"\n\n        The key: \"exactly one contiguous segment\" -> meaning we must choose one segment? But note: the problem says \"exactly one\", meaning we cannot skip? Then we must flip one contiguous segment? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"at most one\" in the title? Actually, the problem title: \"Flipping Game\". But the problem statement says \"exactly one\". \n\n        So we must flip exactly one contiguous segment? Then we don't consider the original array? \n\n        But the original program does not consider the original array? It only considers flips on segments of length>=1. So that is consistent.\n\n        However, note: the original program has a special case for n==1.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          if (n==1) then\n             if (arr(1)==1) then output 0\n             else output 1\n          else\n             total_ones = count of ones\n             Build array b: for each element, if arr(i)==0 then b(i)=1, else b(i)=-1.\n\n             Then run Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum contiguous sum (max_so_far) in b.\n\n             result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          But wait: what if max_so_far is negative? Then we are forced to flip a segment that reduces the number of ones? But the problem says we must flip exactly one contiguous segment. So we have to choose the one that minimizes the reduction? Then the result is total_ones + max_so_far (which might be less than total_ones). \n\n          However, the problem asks for the maximum number of ones we can get. So we want to maximize the ones. We are forced to flip one segment. So we have to choose the segment that gives the maximum gain (which might be negative? but then we choose the least negative).\n\n          Actually, we can also consider: we are allowed to flip any segment. We want to maximize the total ones. The gain from flipping a segment is (number of zeros in the segment) - (number of ones in the segment). This can be negative. Then the result is total_ones + gain. We want to maximize that. So we take the maximum gain over all contiguous segments. That maximum gain might be negative? Then we are forced to take a hit? \n\n          Example: [1,1,1] -> we must flip a segment. The best segment: flip one element: [0,1,1] -> total ones=2. So we get 2 ones. Without flipping we had 3, but we must flip.\n\n          Therefore, the original program does not account for the possibility of skipping? and the problem says \"exactly one\", so we are forced to flip.\n\n        However, the original program for n=1: \n            [1] -> flip the only element: becomes 0 -> then output 0? But the program outputs 0 when n=1 and arr[0]=1 -> which is correct.\n\n        So the efficient method is:\n\n          total_ones = count(arr == 1)\n          b(i) = 1 if arr(i)==0, else -1\n\n          max_ending_here = 0\n          max_so_far = -infinity (or a very small number)\n\n          do i=1, n\n             max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + b(i))   ? -> but note: we are allowed to have negative? Actually, we want the maximum contiguous sum, even if negative? \n\n          But the problem: we must flip exactly one contiguous segment. So we have to pick one segment. We are forced to take a segment. Therefore, we cannot skip. So we must find the maximum contiguous sum? but if all are negative, we take the maximum (least negative) contiguous segment.\n\n          However, Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray without the constraint of non-emptiness: we can do:\n\n             max_ending_here = b(1)\n             max_so_far = b(1)\n\n             do i=2, n\n                 max_ending_here = max(b(i), max_ending_here+b(i))\n                 max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n\n          Then result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          But note: the segment must be non-empty? Yes, because we are forced to flip at least one element.\n\n        Let's test with [1,1,1]:\n            b = [-1, -1, -1]\n            max_ending_here: \n                i=1: max_ending_here = -1, max_so_far=-1\n                i=2: max_ending_here = max(-1, -1 + -1) = max(-1,-2) = -1 -> max_so_far = max(-1,-1) = -1\n                i=3: max_ending_here = max(-1, -1 + -1)=max(-1,-2)=-1 -> max_so_far=-1\n\n            Then result = 3 + (-1) = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Now [1,0,0,1,0] (n=5): \n            arr = [1,0,0,1,0]\n            total_ones = 2\n            b = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]\n\n            We run Kadane:\n                i=1: max_ending_here = -1, max_so_far=-1\n                i=2: max_ending_here = max(1, -1+1)=max(1,0)=1 -> max_so_far = max(-1,1)=1\n                i=3: max_ending_here = max(1, 1+1)=max(1,2)=2 -> max_so_far=2\n                i=4: max_ending_here = max(-1, 2-1)=max(-1,1)=1 -> max_so_far=2\n                i=5: max_ending_here = max(1, 1+1)=2 -> max_so_far=2\n\n            Then result = 2+2 = 4.\n\n            Check: flip the segment [2,5]: \n                Original: [1,0,0,1,0] -> flip [0,0,1,0] becomes [1,1,1,0,1] -> ones: 4 -> correct.\n\n        So we can replace the first program with:\n\n          total_ones = count of ones\n          b = array of -1 and 1 as above.\n\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          current = b(1)\n\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current+b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n        But note: the original program had a special case for n=1. We can handle with the same algorithm?\n\n          n=1: \n             total_ones: if arr(1)=1 -> 1, else 0.\n             b(1): if arr(1)=1 -> -1, else 1.\n             Then max_so_far = b(1) = -1 or 1.\n\n             Then result = 1 + (-1)=0 -> if arr(1)=1 -> 0 -> correct.\n                     or = 0+1=1 -> if arr(1)=0 -> 1 -> correct.\n\n          So we don't need a special case.\n\n        Therefore, the first program can be replaced by the efficient method.\n\n        Now, the second program: \n            It reads a string and replaces commas by spaces.\n\n        But the output of the first program is an integer. We convert that integer to a string and then replace commas? But the integer has no commas? \n\n        However, in some locales, integers might be formatted with commas? But the original Java program just printed the integer. So no commas.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will output the same integer as a string without any commas.\n\n        So we can simply output the integer.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain: \n            Read n and an array of n integers (0/1)\n            Compute the result as described above.\n            Print the result.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"translate the entire sequence\". We must mimic the chain. The second program in the chain is:\n\n            Read a string (which is the output of the first program, so it's an integer without commas) -> then replace commas by spaces -> then output.\n\n            Since there are no commas, the output is the same.\n\n        So we can just output the integer.\n\n        However, to be faithful, we can:\n\n            Step 1: compute the integer result (from the flipping game)\n            Step 2: convert that integer to a string and then replace any commas (if any) by spaces? But Fortran doesn't typically format integers with commas. So we can just output the integer.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". So we cannot do:\n\n            Step 1: output the integer -> then step 2: read the integer as a string and then output.\n\n        Instead, we must do:\n\n            Only the first block reads input (the initial array) and only the last block writes output (the final answer). The intermediate steps (the flipping game and the string processing) are done without I/O.\n\n        How to chain without I/O?\n\n            We have:\n                Step 1: flipping game: produces an integer X.\n                Step 2: the string processing: takes X and produces a string (which is the same as the string of X, but with commas replaced by spaces -> which in practice is the same).\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                X = ...   (computed from the array)\n                Then we convert X to a string and remove commas? But Fortran doesn't add commas by default. So we can just write X as an integer.\n\n        Therefore, the entire Fortran program:\n\n          Read n\n          Read an array of n integers\n\n          total_ones = count of ones in the array\n\n          If n==0 then\n             ! but n>=1? the problem says n integers, and the first program conditionally runs if there is input. But the first program reads n and then n integers. We assume at least one.\n\n          Allocate arrays? But n is given.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          total_ones = 0\n          do i=1, n\n             if (arr(i) == 1) total_ones = total_ones + 1\n          end do\n\n          Then build the array b:\n\n          do i=1, n\n             if (arr(i)==0) then\n                 b(i) = 1\n             else\n                 b(i) = -1\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          Then run Kadane:\n\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          current = b(1)\n\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current + b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          Then we have to output result. But we must pass it through the second program? which replaces commas by spaces? \n\n          Since we are outputting an integer, we can just write:\n\n          write(*,*) result   -> but this might have leading space? \n\n          Alternatively, we can format it without any commas and without extra spaces? \n\n          However, the original second program outputs the string without any extra spaces? Actually, it outputs the entire string with commas replaced. But the integer is a single number.\n\n          We can output the integer without any formatting? \n\n          But note: the second program uses `StringBuilder` and appends the entire string. Then prints. So it's the entire string without any extra spaces? \n\n          In Fortran, if we do:\n\n             write(*,'(I0)') result\n\n          This writes the integer without any leading/trailing spaces and without commas.\n\n          This is the same as the second program's output.\n\n        Therefore, we can output the integer with the I0 format.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are doing that.\n\n        But note: the second program is designed for a string that might have commas. But we know the output of the first program is an integer without commas. So the second program does nothing.\n\n        So we can skip the string processing? But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. We are effectively doing the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate the second program:\n\n            We have the integer result -> convert to a string -> then replace commas by spaces -> then output.\n\n          But Fortran: \n\n            character(20) :: str\n            write(str, '(I0)') result   ! convert to string without commas\n            ! then we must replace any commas in str by spaces? \n            ! but we know there are none? \n\n          Then we output str.\n\n        But that is an extra step. Since we know there are no commas, we can just output the integer.\n\n        However, to be safe and follow the chain, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: compute result (integer) from the flipping game.\n          Step 2: convert the integer to a string and then replace every comma (if any) by a space.\n\n          Then output the string.\n\n        But note: the integer representation in Fortran by the I0 format does not include commas. So the string is the same.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          character(len=20) :: temp_str\n          write(temp_str, '(I0)') result\n\n          ! Now, replace every ',' in temp_str by ' ' (space)\n          do i=1, len(temp_str)\n             if (temp_str(i:i) == ',') then\n                 temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          write(*,*) trim(adjustl(temp_str))   ? \n\n        But the second program in Java outputs the string without trimming? \n\n          Example: if the string is \"  5\" (with spaces) then the Java program would output \"  5\" but with commas replaced? \n\n        However, the first program outputs the integer without any spaces? Actually, the first program does:\n\n            System.out.println(max);\n\n        That prints the integer and then a newline. The integer is printed without any formatting, so it's the same as the default.\n\n        The second program:\n\n            sb.append(a.replace(\",\", \" \"));\n            System.out.println(sb);\n\n        So it outputs the entire string (including any leading/trailing spaces) with commas replaced by spaces, and then a newline.\n\n        How did the integer become a string? The first program prints the integer, then the second program reads the entire line? \n\n        But the first program prints only the integer and then a newline. So the second program reads a line that is the integer and then the newline? Actually, the second program reads a whole line? \n\n        The second program: \n\n            String a = br.readLine();\n\n        So it reads the entire line (which is the integer and the newline? but readLine() removes the newline). So the string `a` is the integer as a string without the newline.\n\n        Then it replaces commas by spaces and outputs that string.\n\n        In Fortran, we are reading the array from the input file. Then we output a string that is the integer without commas and without any extra formatting? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n        The entire chain: \n\n            Input: \n                3\n                1 0 0\n\n            Output: the result of the first program is 3? \n                total_ones = 1\n                b = [-1, 1, 1]\n                Kadane: \n                    max_so_far: \n                        i=1: current=-1, max_so_far=-1\n                        i=2: current = max(1, -1+1)=max(1,0)=1 -> max_so_far=1\n                        i=3: current = max(1, 1+1)=2 -> max_so_far=2\n                result = 1+2 = 3.\n\n            Then the first program outputs \"3\\n\".\n\n            The second program reads the line \"3\" (without the newline) and then replaces commas -> becomes \"3\", then outputs \"3\\n\".\n\n            So the final output is \"3\\n\".\n\n        In Fortran, if we do:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') trim(adjustl(temp_str))\n\n        This would output \"3\" without leading spaces and then a newline? \n\n        But the integer 3 has no leading spaces? So temp_str is \"3\", and then we write it without any adjustment? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            write(*,*) temp_str   ! but this might add a leading space? \n\n        To avoid any extra spaces, we can use:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') trim(adjustl(temp_str))\n\n        This trims leading and trailing spaces and then outputs without extra spaces.\n\n        But the second program in Java outputs the exact integer as a string? without trimming? Actually, the integer as a string has no leading spaces? \n\n        Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') trim(temp_str)   ! but temp_str might have trailing spaces? \n\n        Since we wrote with I0, the string has no leading spaces and the exact digits. But the string is of fixed length (20). We can trim.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output without any extra spaces:\n\n            write(*, '(i0)') result   -> this is the same as the integer without any commas and without any extra spaces.\n\n        And that would be the same as the second program's output? \n\n        But the problem says: we must translate the entire sequence. So we must do the string processing step? \n\n        Since the second program is a separate program, we are required to simulate it. So we do:\n\n            integer_result = ...   (from the flipping game)\n            convert integer_result to a string -> s\n            replace every comma in s by space -> s'\n            output s'\n\n        But we know that in Fortran, when we write with I0, we get no commas. So s has no commas. Then s' = s.\n\n        Therefore, we can just output the integer with I0.\n\n        However, to be safe and follow the specification, we do the string processing.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          total_ones = ... (as above)\n          ... Kadane's algorithm ...\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far   (integer)\n\n          ! Now convert to string\n          character(len=30) :: str_result\n          write(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\n          ! Replace commas in str_result by spaces\n          integer :: j\n          do j = 1, len(str_result)\n             if (str_result(j:j) == ',') then\n                 str_result(j:j) = ' '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Output the string without any extra spaces? \n          ! But the string might have trailing spaces? We need to output the whole string? \n          ! The second program outputs the entire string (which is the integer) without trimming? \n\n          However, the integer doesn't have trailing spaces. But we wrote to a fixed-length string: so there are trailing spaces? \n\n          How to avoid? We can trim the trailing spaces? But the second program outputs the entire line? \n\n          Actually, the second program outputs the string as it is (without trimming) but the string we read in the second program (from the first program's output) has no trailing spaces? \n\n          The first program outputs the integer and then a newline. So the second program reads the integer as a string without the newline and without trailing spaces? \n\n          Therefore, we must output the integer without any extra spaces and without a newline? But then we output the newline? \n\n          The second program outputs the string and then a newline (because of println). So we must output the string without the trailing spaces and then a newline.\n\n          How to do:\n\n            We can find the actual length of the integer string? \n\n          Alternatively, we can:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') trim(str_result)\n\n          But note: the trim function removes trailing spaces. The string we built: the I0 format writes the integer without leading spaces, and then the rest of the 30 characters are spaces? So we trim.\n\n          Then we output the trimmed string and a newline (because the format '(a)' and then the write adds a newline? Actually, in Fortran, list-directed write (write(*,*)) adds a newline. But with formatted:\n\n            write(*, '(a)') ...   outputs the string and then a newline? \n\n          Because the format is for one record: the entire string and then the record ends, which by default adds a newline? \n\n          This is the same as the second program: it outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n          write(*, '(a)') trim(str_result)\n\n        But note: what if the integer is negative? The I0 format will write the minus sign and then the digits. There won't be commas.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Let me test with the example [1,1,1] -> result=2.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          str_result = '2' (and then 29 spaces)\n          trim(str_result) = '2'\n          write(*,'(a)') '2'   -> outputs \"2\\n\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Now, what if the integer is large? \n\n          Example: 1234567 -> I0 writes '1234567' (without commas) -> then we check for commas: none -> then output '1234567\\n'\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, note: the first program might output numbers that are negative? \n\n          The result: total_ones (>=0) plus max_so_far (which can be negative). So the result can be negative? \n\n          Example: [1,1] -> total_ones=2, max_so_far = max( -1, -1) = -1 (if we run Kadane on [-1,-1] -> the maximum contiguous segment is -1) -> result=1.\n\n          But wait: flipping a segment of two ones: becomes zeros -> total ones=0? But wait:\n\n          We must flip exactly one contiguous segment. The best we can do: flip one element: then we get one 1 and one 0 -> ones=1.\n\n          So result=1, positive.\n\n          Actually, the result is always nonnegative? \n\n          total_ones >=0, and max_so_far >= -n? but the result = total_ones + max_so_far.\n\n          The minimum total_ones is 0, and the minimum max_so_far is -n? then result >= -n? but n>=1, so it can be negative? \n\n          Example: n=1, [1] -> result=0 -> nonnegative.\n\n          n=2, [1,1] -> result=1 -> nonnegative.\n\n          Actually, the result is the total ones after flipping, so it must be between 0 and n. Therefore, nonnegative.\n\n        So we don't have negative integers to output.\n\n        Therefore, the program:\n\n          We assume the input has at least one integer.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Read n\n            Allocate an integer array of size n? Or we can use a static array? We can read n and then use a fixed maximum? But the problem does not specify n. We can use n_max? \n\n          Since Fortran requires explicit sizes, we can set a maximum n, say 100? But the problem does not specify. \n\n          Alternatively, we can read n and then allocate? But Fortran 90+ allows dynamic allocation.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            integer :: n\n            read(*,*) n\n            integer, dimension(n) :: arr, b\n            ... then read the n integers\n\n          Code:\n\n          program combined\n            implicit none\n            integer :: n, i, total_ones, max_so_far, current, result\n            integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, b\n            character(len=30) :: str_result\n\n            ! Read n\n            read(*,*) n\n            allocate(arr(n))\n            allocate(b(n))\n\n            ! Read the array\n            do i=1, n\n                read(*,*) arr(i)\n            end do\n\n            ! Count total ones\n            total_ones = 0\n            do i=1, n\n                if (arr(i) == 1) total_ones = total_ones + 1\n            end do\n\n            ! Build array b\n            do i=1, n\n                if (arr(i) == 0) then\n                    b(i) = 1\n                else\n                    b(i) = -1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Kadane's algorithm\n            max_so_far = b(1)\n            current = b(1)\n            do i=2, n\n                current = max(b(i), current + b(i))\n                if (current > max_so_far) max_so_far = current\n            end do\n\n            result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n            ! Convert result to a string\n            write(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\n            ! Replace commas by spaces (though unlikely to appear)\n            do i=1, len(str_result)\n                if (str_result(i:i) == ',') then\n                    str_result(i:i) = ' '\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Output the string without trailing spaces and with a newline\n            write(*, '(a)') trim(str_result)\n\n            deallocate(arr)\n            deallocate(b)\n          end program combined\n\n        But note: the Kadane's algorithm: we do max_so_far = b(1) and then start from i=2. Correct.\n\n        Also, we must consider the case when n=1: we have the loop from i=2 to n: if n=1, the loop is not entered -> then max_so_far remains b(1). Correct.\n\n        Let me test with n=1, arr(1)=1: \n            total_ones = 1\n            b(1) = -1\n            max_so_far = -1\n            result = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> correct.\n\n        n=1, arr(1)=0:\n            total_ones=0\n            b(1)=1\n            result=0+1=1 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        However, note: the original first program had a special case for n==1? But we are handling it in the same way? So we don't need the special case.\n\n        We'll write the program as above.\n\n        But note: the maximum contiguous sum might be negative? We are using the algorithm that allows negative? \n\n        We are starting with max_so_far = b(1) and then updating from i=2. This handles negative.\n\n        One more test: n=2, [1,1] -> \n            total_ones=2\n            b = [-1,-1]\n            max_so_far = -1\n            current = -1\n            i=2: current = max(-1, -1-1) = max(-1,-2) = -1 -> then max_so_far remains -1? \n            result = 2 -1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the maximum contiguous sum for [-1,-1] is -1? Actually, the maximum contiguous segment is either -1 (if we take one element) or -2? So the maximum is -1. Correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          current = b(1)\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current+b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n        We don't have an intrinsic max for integers? We can use:\n\n          if (current > max_so_far) max_so_far = current\n\n        That is the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n\n        But Fortran has the intrinsic function max? \n\n        We can write:\n\n          max_so_far = max_so_far   ! no, we can use:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n\n        But note: max for integers is available.\n\n        So we can replace:\n\n          if (current > max_so_far) max_so_far = current\n\n        with:\n\n          max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n\n        That is clearer.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n          current = b(1)\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          do i=2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current+b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n        We'll use that.\n\n        Final Fortran code:\n\n          program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i, total_ones, max_so_far, current, result\n          integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, b\n          character(len=30) :: str_result\n\n          read(*,*) n\n          allocate(arr(n))\n          allocate(b(n))\n\n          do i = 1, n\n             read(*,*) arr(i)\n          end do\n\n          total_ones = 0\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (arr(i) == 1) total_ones = total_ones + 1\n          end do\n\n          do i = 1, n\n             if (arr(i) == 0) then\n                 b(i) = 1\n             else\n                 b(i) = -1\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          current = b(1)\n          max_so_far = b(1)\n          do i = 2, n\n             current = max(b(i), current + b(i))\n             max_so_far = max(max_so_far, current)\n          end do\n\n          result = total_ones + max_so_far\n\n          write(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\n          do i = 1, len(str_result)\n             if (str_result(i:i) == ',') then\n                 str_result(i:i) = ' '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          write(*, '(a)') trim(str_result)\n\n          deallocate(arr)\n          deallocate(b)\n          end program combined\n\n        This should be the complete program.\n\n        Note: We assume the integers are read correctly. The input format: first integer n, then n integers (each 0 or 1) on the next lines? Or on the same line? \n\n        The original Java program: \n\n            int n = scanner.nextInt();\n            int arr[] = new int[n];\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        The scanner reads tokens (separated by whitespace). So the integers can be on one line or multiple.\n\n        Similarly, in Fortran: \n\n            read(*,*) n   ! reads the first integer\n            then for the array: \n               do i=1, n\n                  read(*,*) arr(i)   ! reads one integer per line? \n\n        But the format * is list-directed: it will read as many as available on one line. \n\n        Example: if the input is:\n\n            3\n            1 0 0\n\n        Then the first read reads 3. Then the next read in the loop: \n            first iteration: reads the next token -> 1\n            second: 0\n            third: 0\n\n        That matches.\n\n        But if the input is:\n\n            3\n            1\n            0\n            0\n\n        Then it also works.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        We output the string without any extra spaces and without commas.\n\n        This is the final solution."
