    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (atcoder_ABC169_C):\n  - Reads a long integer `a` and a string `b`.\n  - Removes any '.' from the string `b` and converts it to an integer `bInt`.\n  - Computes `(a * bInt) / 100` and prints the result.\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC170_A):\n  - Reads a line of space-separated integers.\n  - Counts the numbers until it finds the first occurrence of \"0\", then breaks and prints the count (which is the 1-indexed position of the zero).\n\nBut note: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program.\n\nHowever, the first program outputs a single integer (the result of `(a * bInt)/100`). The second program expects a line of space-separated integers. \n\nBut wait: the second program in the chain must read the output of the first. The first program outputs one integer. The second program reads a line of integers until it finds a zero. But the first program does not output a zero? \n\nLet me reexamine:\n\nFirst program: \n  Input: a long `a` and a string `b` (which is a decimal number, e.g., \"1.23\")\n  It removes the decimal point and then does (a * that_integer) / 100.\n\nExample: \n  If a=100 and b=\"1.23\", then b becomes \"123\", then (100 * 123)/100 = 123.\n\nThe output of the first program is a single integer.\n\nNow the second program expects a line of numbers. But the first program only outputs one number. How does the second program work?\n\nThe second program:\n  Reads a line and splits by space. Then it counts the numbers until it finds the first zero. Then it outputs the count (which is the position).\n\nBut if the first program outputs only one number (say 123) and that number is not zero, then the second program would read one token and then break? No, because it breaks only when it finds a zero.\n\nActually, the second program does:\n\n  tokens = [token1, token2, ...]\n  for each token:\n      result += 1\n      if token equals \"0\", break\n\nSo if the input to the second program is \"123\", then:\n  tokens = [\"123\"]\n  result becomes 1, then check if \"123\" equals \"0\"? -> no -> so it doesn't break. Then the loop ends (only one token) and outputs 1.\n\nBut if the first program outputs a zero? Then the second program would output 1 (because the first token is zero and it breaks immediately).\n\nHowever, the chain: the first program's output is the second program's input.\n\nBut note the example: the first program outputs a long integer. The second program expects a line of tokens. We have only one token.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\nInput to the first program: \n  A long integer and a string (which is a decimal number).\n\nOutput of the first program: a single integer.\n\nInput to the second program: that single integer (as a string, without any spaces).\n\nOutput of the second program: the position of the first zero? But wait, the second program is counting until it finds a zero. In the input, we have only one integer. If that integer is zero, then we output 1. If it is non-zero, we output 1 (because there's only one token and we count it and then the loop ends).\n\nBut wait: the second program does not break until it finds a zero. So if there are multiple tokens and the first zero is at the second token, it would break at the second token and output 2.\n\nBut in our case, the input to the second program is a single token. So:\n\n  If that token is zero -> output 1 (because we count the first token and then break).\n  If that token is non-zero -> we count one token and then the loop ends -> output 1.\n\nSo the second program always outputs 1? \n\nThat doesn't match the original purpose of the second program. The original second program was designed to read five integers (as in the problem A of ABC170) and then find the first zero. But here we are feeding it one integer.\n\nThis indicates that the two programs were not designed to be chained. However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo we must chain them as given.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n  Step 1: Read two inputs (a long and a string) from the initial input.\n  Step 2: Process the string to remove the decimal point, convert to integer, then compute (a * that_integer) / 100. This gives a long integer.\n  Step 3: Then, the output of step1 becomes the input to step2. But step2 (the second program) expects a line of tokens. However, we have one integer. We then run the second program's logic: \n        - Split the string representation of that integer? But wait, the second program reads a line and splits by space. But we have one integer without spaces. So we get one token.\n\n        Then we count the tokens until we find a zero. Since we have one token, we count 1 and then the loop ends (unless that token is zero, then we break after counting 1). In either case, the output is 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the two programs are independent and we are to run them on the same initial input? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nLooking at the second program: it actually doesn't use the output of the first. It reads from the same initial input? But the problem says we are to chain.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nSo the first program reads from stdin and writes to stdout. The second program then reads from that stdout (which becomes its stdin). \n\nBut the second program expects multiple integers? How can the first program output multiple integers? It outputs one integer.\n\nTherefore, the chain as described is broken unless we reinterpret the second program to read the one integer and then do its counting until it finds a zero? But that leads to always outputting 1.\n\nAlternatively, the second program might be misrepresented? Let me check the original problem of ABC170_A.\n\nProblem A: Five Variables\n  The input has five integers: x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. We are to output the index i (1-indexed) such that xi=0.\n\nBut note: the program reads a line and splits by space. So if the first program outputs, say, the integer 123, then the second program gets the string \"123\" and splits it? But there are no spaces -> one token. Then it counts 1 and then the loop ends. It never breaks because the token is not zero? Then the output is 1.\n\nBut if the first program outputs 0, then the second program gets the token \"0\", then at the first token it breaks -> output 1.\n\nSo the second program always outputs 1? That is not what the original ABC170_A does.\n\nTherefore, I suspect there might be a misunderstanding. However, we must follow the given programs.\n\nSo the entire chain:\n\n  Input to the first program: \n        a long integer and a string (which is a decimal number) on the same input? Actually, the first program uses a Scanner that reads first a long and then a string (which can be on the same line or next?).\n\n  The first program: \n        reads a long and a string (the string is the next token). \n\n  Example: if the initial input is \"100 1.23\", then a=100, b=\"1.23\".\n\n  Then it computes 100 * 123 / 100 = 123, and outputs \"123\".\n\n  Then the second program reads the string \"123\" (without any spaces). It splits by space -> [\"123\"]. Then it counts: \n        token1: \"123\" -> count becomes 1. Then check: is \"123\" equal to \"0\"? -> no. Then the loop ends. Then it outputs 1.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain: \n        Input: \"100 1.23\"\n        Output: 1\n\n  But note: the first program might read the entire line for the string? Actually, the first program uses `sc.nextLong()` and then `sc.next()`. So the string is the next token.\n\n  The second program: `br.readLine()` reads the entire line? But the first program outputs a single integer without any newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println(result);` so it outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\n  The second program then reads one line: that line is \"123\".\n\nSo the chain is:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial input (two tokens: a long and a string token).\n  Step 2: Compute the result and output that integer (with a newline).\n\n  Step 3: The second program reads that one line (which is the integer as a string) and splits it by space -> one token.\n\n  Then the second program counts the tokens until it finds a zero. Since there is only one token and it's not zero, the count is 1 and the loop ends. Then it outputs 1.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's result is zero? Then the second program would read the line \"0\", split into [\"0\"], then at the first token: count=1 and then break (because it found zero). Then output 1.\n\nSo regardless, the output is 1.\n\nThis seems odd. But that's what the chain does.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n  - Read the initial input: a long integer and a string (which is a decimal number). They are on the same line? Or two lines? The Java program uses `sc.nextLong()` and `sc.next()`, so they are tokens (space separated).\n\n  - Process the string: remove any '.' and convert to integer.\n\n  - Compute: (a * bInt) / 100 -> this gives an integer.\n\n  - Then, without outputting, we must pass this integer to the next step.\n\n  - The next step: we are to simulate the second program. It would take the integer from the first step as a string (without any other tokens) and then count the tokens until it finds a zero. But note: we don't have to actually split the integer into tokens? Because there is only one token: the entire integer.\n\n  - However, the second program counts the tokens until it finds a zero. But we can simulate:\n\n        token_count = 0\n        We have a string representation of the integer? But we don't have the string? We have the integer.\n\n        How to do: we can convert the integer to a string and then split by spaces? But the string is one token. Alternatively, we know that the entire string is one token.\n\n        Then we do:\n            token_count = token_count + 1\n            if the integer is 0, then break.\n\n        Then output token_count.\n\n        But note: the second program breaks as soon as it finds a zero. So if the integer is zero, we break after the first token. Otherwise, we process the entire line (which is one token) and then break the loop? Actually, the loop runs for each token. Since there is one token, we run once.\n\n        Therefore, the output is always 1.\n\n  So we can skip the entire tokenization and just set the result to 1? \n\n  But wait: what if the first program outputs multiple tokens? It doesn't. It outputs one integer.\n\n  Therefore, the entire chain always outputs 1.\n\nBut that seems too trivial. However, that is the behavior of the chain.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the second program is run on the original input? But the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nSo we design the Fortran program:\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Read the initial input: a long integer and a string (which is a token). They are on the same line? We'll assume they are on the same line.\n\n  2. Process the string: remove any '.' and convert to an integer.\n\n  3. Compute: result1 = (a * bInt) / 100   [integer division? note: a is long, bInt is integer, and then divided by 100 (integer division)].\n\n  4. Then we have the integer result1.\n\n  5. Now, we are to simulate the second program: \n        We have a string that is the representation of result1 (without any spaces). But we don't actually need to tokenize because we know there is only one token. We also know that the second program will count one token and then break only if the token is zero? Actually, the break condition is when we find a token equal to \"0\". But we are not going to split the integer? We can simply:\n\n        count = 1\n        if (result1 == 0) then\n            we break after the first token -> so output 1\n        else\n            we still output 1? because there is only one token.\n\n        So we always output 1.\n\n  Therefore, the entire program can be:\n\n      program main\n          implicit none\n          ! Variables for the first program\n          character(100) :: input_line   ! To read the entire line? Or we can read separately?\n          integer(kind=8) :: a           ! long in Java, we use 8-byte integer\n          character(20) :: b_str          ! to hold the string token for b\n          character(20) :: temp_str       ! for processing the string b\n          integer :: i, j, bInt, length\n          integer(kind=8) :: result1      ! the result from the first step\n\n          ! Step 1: read a and the string b\n          read(*,*) a, b_str\n\n          ! Process the string b_str: remove any '.' and form a new string\n          j = 1\n          temp_str = ''\n          do i = 1, len_trim(b_str)\n              if (b_str(i:i) /= '.') then\n                  temp_str(j:j) = b_str(i:i)\n                  j = j + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Now, convert the substring of temp_str (from 1 to j-1) to integer\n          read(temp_str(1:j-1), *) bInt\n\n          ! Compute: result1 = (a * bInt) / 100\n          result1 = (a * bInt) / 100\n\n          ! Now, we have result1. This is the output of the first program and becomes the input to the second.\n          ! But the second program: \n          !   It would read a line and split by space. Then count tokens until it finds \"0\". \n          !   Since we have one token (the entire result1) we don't need to split. We only have one token.\n          !   So the output of the second program is 1 (if we don't break) or 1 (if we break at the first token because it is zero) -> always 1.\n\n          ! Therefore, the final output is 1.\n\n          write(*,*) 1\n\n      end program\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's result1 is a negative number? The second program: it splits the string? The string might be negative? Then the token would be something like \"-123\". Then it's not \"0\", so we output 1.\n\nAnd if result1 is zero, then the token is \"0\", so we break at the first token and output 1.\n\nSo yes, always 1.\n\nHowever, let me check with the example: \n  Input: \"100 1.23\" -> result1 = 123 -> then the second program outputs 1.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs a number that, when converted to a string, has spaces? It won't because the first program outputs a single integer without spaces.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  Read a and the string b.\n  Remove '.' from b and convert to integer bInt.\n  Compute result1 = (a * bInt) / 100.\n  Then output 1.\n\nBut note: the second program counts the tokens until it finds the first zero. But the tokenization is by space. The first program outputs the integer without any spaces. So the entire output is one token.\n\nHowever, what if the integer is very long? It still won't have spaces.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n  We don't even need to compute the entire chain beyond the first step? Because the output is always 1.\n\nBut that is the behavior of the chain.\n\nBut let me reexamine the second program: \n\n  It reads a line and splits by space. Then it iterates over the tokens. It breaks when it finds a token that is exactly \"0\". \n\n  The first program outputs a single integer. The token is the entire integer as a string. So unless the integer is zero, we don't break in the middle? We break only at the first token? Actually, we break when we see the token \"0\", but that token must be exactly the entire token. \n\n  So if the first program outputs 10, then the token is \"10\", which is not \"0\", so we count 1 and then the loop ends (because there are no more tokens). Then output 1.\n\n  If the first program outputs 0, then the token is \"0\", so we break and output 1.\n\n  So indeed, the second program always outputs 1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  program main\n      implicit none\n      integer(kind=8) :: a\n      character(20) :: b_str, temp_str\n      integer :: i, j, bInt\n      integer(kind=8) :: result1\n\n      ! Read the two inputs: a long and a string\n      read(*,*) a, b_str\n\n      ! Remove the '.' from b_str\n      j = 1\n      temp_str = ' '   ! Initialize with spaces\n      do i = 1, len_trim(b_str)\n          if (b_str(i:i) /= '.') then\n              temp_str(j:j) = b_str(i:i)\n              j = j + 1\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Convert the temp_str (without the trailing spaces) to integer\n      ! We have written j-1 characters\n      read(temp_str(1:j-1), *) bInt\n\n      ! Compute the result of the first program\n      result1 = (a * bInt) / 100\n\n      ! Now, the second program: we don't actually need to split the string representation of result1.\n      ! Because we know it is a single token. And the second program would count 1 and then break if it is zero? \n      ! But regardless, the output is 1.\n\n      write(*,*) 1\n\n  end program\n\nBut wait: what if the first program's computation overflows? We are using 8-byte integers for a and result1. But the Java program uses long (8-byte) and then multiplies by an integer (which is 4-byte). Then divides by 100. So we must use 8-byte for the multiplication and then division.\n\nIn Fortran: \n   a is 8-byte, bInt is 4-byte. When we do a * bInt, the result is 8-byte? Yes, because a is 8-byte. Then we divide by 100 (integer division).\n\nSo the computation is safe.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java would have read the entire line and then split. But we are skipping that and outputting 1. \n\nAlternatively, we can simulate the second program without reading from a string? We have the integer result1. How would the second program have processed the string of result1? \n\n  The second program splits the input line by space. The input line is the string representation of result1. That string has no spaces -> one token.\n\n  Then the second program does:\n\n      tokens = [ token1 ]   (only one token)\n      count = 0\n      for each token in tokens:\n          count = count + 1\n          if token == \"0\": break\n\n      print count\n\n  So the count is 1.\n\n  Therefore, we don't need to do anything with the integer result1 for the output. The output is always 1.\n\nSo the final program is as above.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain\". And the original chain would have printed the first program's result and then the second program would have read that and then printed 1. We are skipping the intermediate I/O and just outputting 1.\n\nBut note: what if the second program had multiple tokens? Then we would have to simulate. But the first program outputs one integer -> one token. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  We read the two inputs: a and the string b.\n  We remove the '.' from b and convert to integer bInt.\n  We compute result1 = (a * bInt) / 100 (with 8-byte arithmetic).\n  Then we output 1.\n\nBut note: the second program's output is the final output.\n\nLet me test with an example:\n\n  Input: \"100000 1.11\"\n    a = 100000\n    b = \"1.11\" -> becomes \"111\", so bInt=111\n    result1 = (100000 * 111) / 100 = 11100000 / 100 = 111000\n\n  Then the second program: gets the string \"111000\", splits -> one token. Then it counts 1 and then the loop ends? Then outputs 1.\n\n  So we output 1.\n\n  Input: \"0 0.00\"\n    a=0, b=\"0.00\" -> becomes \"000\" -> then bInt=0.\n    result1 = (0 * 0) / 100 = 0.\n    Then the second program: gets \"0\", then counts 1 and breaks? Then outputs 1.\n\n  So we output 1.\n\nTherefore, the program is:\n\n  We don't even use result1 for the output? Only for the computation? Actually, we don't use it at all for the final output.\n\n  So we can skip computing result1? \n\n  But note: what if the first program had side effects? It doesn't. The only effect is the output which becomes the input to the second. But we are skipping the intermediate I/O. However, the problem says: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we must compute the intermediate data (result1) because the second program uses it? \n\n  How the second program uses it: it reads the string representation of result1. But we don't actually need to compute the string representation? Because we know it is one token. And the second program's output is always 1 regardless of the value of result1.\n\n  Therefore, we don't need to compute result1? \n\n  But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program might have an overflow? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must compute result1 even if we don't use it? \n\n  Actually, the first program might throw an exception? But in Fortran, we must avoid that? We assume valid inputs.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the constraints, so we compute as in the first program.\n\n  But note: the second program does not use the value of result1 for anything except to check if it is zero? But we are not using the value for the output? We are outputting 1 regardless. However, the second program's behavior: it breaks when it finds a token that is \"0\". But the token is the entire result1. So if result1 is zero, then the token is \"0\", and we break at the first token (and output 1). If result1 is non-zero, then we output 1 without breaking? But we break the loop after the first token? Actually, we break the loop because we run out of tokens. So the output is always 1.\n\n  Therefore, we don't need the value of result1 to decide the final output. But the problem says we are to simulate the entire chain. And the chain computes result1. So we must compute it? \n\n  The problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n  The behavior of the chain is: \n      Step1: read a and b, compute result1 and output it.\n      Step2: read the string of result1 (one token), then output 1.\n\n  The final output is 1. But the intermediate step1 is required? Because if we skip step1, then the second program would not get the same input? But we are not actually passing the data via I/O. We are simulating the chain without I/O.\n\n  We are required to compute the intermediate data without I/O. So we must compute result1? \n\n  However, the second program does not use the numeric value of result1? It uses the string representation. But we are not going to convert to string? Because we know the tokenization would yield one token. And then we know the output is 1.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip the computation of result1? \n\n  But what if the computation of result1 causes an overflow? Then the Java program would throw an exception. We must do the same? But Fortran doesn't throw exceptions by default. We assume the inputs are such that the computation doesn't overflow? \n\n  The problem does not specify. We must do the computation as in the first program? \n\n  Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we do the computation. \n\n  But note: the second program doesn't use the result1 for anything except to form a string? And we are not using that string? We are just knowing that the string has one token. So if the computation of result1 overflows, then the first program would have crashed and the second wouldn't run? Then our Fortran program must crash? \n\n  But we are doing the computation: if it overflows, Fortran might wrap around? We are using 8-byte integers. The Java program also uses 8-byte for long. So the same overflow behavior? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the inputs. We assume the inputs are such that the computation doesn't overflow? \n\n  But we are required to do the same as the chain. So we must compute result1? \n\n  However, the final output is 1 regardless. So if we skip the computation, we avoid the overflow? That would be different behavior.\n\n  Therefore, we must compute result1 to have the same potential overflow? \n\n  But Fortran doesn't throw an exception on overflow by default. We can check? The problem doesn't say. We assume the inputs are within the same constraints as the original programs.\n\n  So we compute result1 and then output 1.\n\n  But note: the second program might not run if the first crashes? Then the chain stops. In Fortran, if the computation of result1 overflows, the program might continue with a wrong value? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". Without exception handling, we cannot. \n\n  We'll assume the inputs are such that the computation doesn't overflow.\n\n  So the program:\n\n      program main\n          implicit none\n          integer(kind=8) :: a, result1\n          character(20) :: b_str, temp_str\n          integer :: i, j, bInt\n          integer :: length\n\n          ! Read a and b_str\n          read(*,*) a, b_str\n\n          ! Remove '.' from b_str\n          j = 1\n          temp_str = ' '   ! Initialize with spaces\n          length = len_trim(b_str)\n          do i = 1, length\n              if (b_str(i:i) /= '.') then\n                  temp_str(j:j) = b_str(i:i)\n                  j = j + 1\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Convert the part of temp_str we built to integer\n          read(temp_str(1:j-1), *) bInt\n\n          ! Compute the result1\n          result1 = (a * bInt) / 100\n\n          ! The second program: we know the output is always 1.\n          write(*,*) 1\n\n      end program\n\nBut note: the division by 100: in Java, it is integer division. In Fortran, it is the same.\n\nLet me test with an example that doesn't divide evenly: \n  a=1, b=\"0.99\" -> becomes \"099\" -> bInt=99 -> result1 = (1*99)/100 = 0.\n\n  Then the second program outputs 1.\n\n  Our Fortran program: \n      read a=1, b_str=\"0.99\"\n      remove '.' -> \"099\"\n      convert to integer -> 99\n      result1 = (1*99)/100 = 0 (because 99/100 is 0 in integer division).\n\n  Then output 1.\n\n  Correct.\n\nAnother test: \n  a=100, b=\"1.23\" -> result1=123, then output 1.\n\nBut note: the first program in Java does (100 * 123) / 100 = 123. Then the second program gets \"123\" and outputs 1.\n\nSo our program outputs 1.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are only reading at the beginning and writing at the end.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal Fortran program:\n\n  Note: We are reading the initial input (a and b_str) and then writing the final output (1).\n\n  We compute the intermediate result1 (even though we don't use it for output) to simulate the first program.\n\n  We output 1 at the end to simulate the second program.\n\nCode:"
