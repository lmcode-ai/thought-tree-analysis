So for the first character (Fortran index 1), the Java index is 0 -> even -> 'g'. So we use (i-1) mod 2. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          do i = 1, len_str\n              if (mod(i,2) == 1) then   ! because in Fortran, the first character is at 1 -> which is odd, but in Java it was 0 (even). \n                                         !

So for i=1 (Fortran) we want to be even? How about: \n            We can think: the parity in the Java program is based on (index mod 2). Fortran index i corresponds to Java index i-1. So we do: \n            if (mod(i-1,2) == 0) -> then even -> 'g'\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (mod(i,2) == 1) then   ! because (i-1) mod 2 = mod(i+1,2) mod2?

Actually, the mapping: Java index0 (even) -> Fortran i=1 -> we want to assign 'g'\n                    Java index1 (odd) -> Fortran i=2 -> we want to assign 'p'\n\n          But note: mod(i-1,2) for i=1: mod(0,2)=0 -> then we assign 'g'. For i=2: mod(1,2)=1 -> then we assign 'p'. That matches. Alternatively, we can note that the Java program uses:\n\n                char my = i % 2 == 0 ?

But what if we had \"Poor\"?\n\n      str = \"Poor\" (4 characters)\n\n      i=1: 'g' vs 'P' -> not 'g' -> -1\n      i=2: 'p' vs 'o' -> not 'p' -> +1 -> 0\n      i=3: 'g' vs 'o' -> not 'g' -> -1\n      i=4: 'p' vs 'r' -> not 'p' -> +1 -> 0 So output 0.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to run in sequence. The first program (codeforces_456_A) reads input and produces an output string (\"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\"). The second program (atcoder_ARC062_B) reads a string (which would be the output of the first program) and computes a score.\n\nHowever, note that the first program's output is a string, and the second program expects a string of characters 'g' and 'p'? Actually, the second program expects a string that is the output of the first program. But the first program outputs either \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\". The second program then processes each character of that string.\n\nBut wait: the second program's logic is based on the characters in the string. It assigns:\n   - For even indices (0-indexed): my = 'g'\n   - For odd indices: my = 'p'\nThen it compares with the character in the string at that position. If they are different, it adds:\n   - If my is 'p' (meaning it's an odd index) and his is different, then add 1 (because my is 'p' and his is not, so his must be 'g'? but note: the string is either \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\")\n\nThis doesn't seem to make sense in the context of the first program's output. However, the problem states that the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and to translate into a single Fortran program without intermediate I/O.\n\nSo, the plan:\n  1. We read the input for the first program (which is an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers).\n  2. We simulate the first program to get the string output (either \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\").\n  3. Then we take that string and pass it as input to the second program (which will compute a score).\n  4. The final output of the entire program should be the score (an integer) from the second program.\n\nHowever, note that the original chain would have printed a string from the first program and then the second program would have read that string and printed an integer. But we are to avoid intermediate I/O.\n\nTherefore, in our Fortran program:\n  - We will read the input for the first program (the integer n and the n pairs).\n  - We will run the logic of the first program to determine the string (without printing it).\n  - Then we will run the logic of the second program on that string (without reading from stdin again).\n  - Finally, we will print the integer score from the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain would have read the string from stdin (which was the output of the first). We are replacing that by passing the string in memory.\n\nSteps:\n\nStep 1: Read the first integer `n`, then `n` pairs of integers.\n\nStep 2: Simulate the first Java program (codeforces_456_A) to set a boolean `f` (which we will use to choose between \"Happy Alex\" and \"Poor Alex\").\n\nStep 3: Instead of printing the string, we store the string. We have two possibilities:\n        if (f) then string = \"Happy Alex\"\n        else string = \"Poor Alex\"\n\nStep 4: Then we pass this string to the second program's logic. The second program (atcoder_ARC062_B) processes the string by:\n        score = 0\n        for each index i (0-indexed) in the string:\n            if i is even -> my = 'g'\n            if i is odd  -> my = 'p'\n            if my != S[i] then:\n                if my is 'p', then score += 1\n                else (my is 'g') then score -= 1\n\nStep 5: Print the score.\n\nNote: The second program in the original chain would output the score. So our final output is the integer score.\n\nImportant: The first program's output string is fixed: either 10 characters (\"Happy Alex\") or 9 characters (\"Poor Alex\"). But note that the second program in the original chain would read the entire string (including spaces). So we must form the entire string.\n\nLet's break down the strings:\n  - \"Happy Alex\" has 10 characters (including the space): H a p p y   A l e x -> 10\n  - \"Poor Alex\" has 9 characters: P o o r   A l e x -> 9\n\nBut the second program processes each character. We must form the string exactly.\n\nImplementation in Fortran:\n\n  We'll declare:\n      integer :: n\n      integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n      logical :: f\n      ... (other variables as in the first program)\n\n  Then we read n and the pairs.\n\n  We simulate the first program to set `f`.\n\n  Then we set a string variable:\n      character(len=10) :: str   ! because the longer string is 10 characters\n\n  But note: \"Poor Alex\" is 9 characters. We can set the length to 10 and then when we have \"Poor Alex\", we can use only 9? Actually, we can form the string and then in the loop we use the actual length.\n\n  Alternatively, we can set:\n      character(len=10) :: str\n      integer :: len_str\n\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy Alex\"\n          len_str = 10\n      else\n          str = \"Poor Alex\"\n          len_str = 9\n      end if\n\n  But note: in the second program, we loop for the entire string (S.length()). So we need the exact string.\n\n  However, we can also just use:\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy Alex\"\n      else\n          str = \"Poor Alex\"\n      end if\n\n  And then in the loop, we go from 1 to len_trim(str) ? But note: the string might have trailing spaces? We don't want that. Actually, the original string does not have trailing spaces. But we assigned with fixed length: if we assign \"Poor Alex\" to a variable of length 10, then it will have a trailing space? So we must be cautious.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid fixed length and use:\n      character(:), allocatable :: str\n\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy Alex\"\n      else\n          str = \"Poor Alex\"\n      end if\n\n  Then the loop goes from 1 to len(str).\n\n  This is more straightforward.\n\n  Then we run the second program's logic on the string `str`.\n\n  Finally, we print the integer `score`.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nNote: The first program has some logic that we must translate correctly. We'll try to mimic the same.\n\nVariables in the first program:\n\n  n: integer\n  a, b: arrays of n integers\n  temp, q, w, e: integers\n  f: boolean\n\nThe logic:\n\n  temp = 0\n  q = 0\n  w = 0, e = 0\n  f = false\n\n  for i from 0 to n-1:\n      read a[i] and b[i]\n      if temp < a[i]:\n          if q > b[i] then f = true\n          q = b[i]\n          temp = a[i]\n      if temp > a[i]:   [note: this is an independent if, not else]\n          if q < b[i] then f = true\n          q = b[i]\n          temp = a[i]\n      if a[i] > w:\n          w = a[i]\n          if b[i] < e then f = true\n          e = b[i]\n      if a[i] < w:\n          if b[i] > e then f = true\n\nBut note: the condition \"if temp > a[i]\" is not in an else. So both conditions might run? Actually, at the beginning, temp is 0. So the first a[i] will be positive? Then we set temp = a[i]. Then the next a[i] might be less than temp -> then the second condition runs? But also note that the third condition: if a[i] > w (which is 0) then set w and e. Then the next if (a[i] < w) might also run if the next a[i] is less than the current w? \n\nBut note: the logic is a bit complex. We'll translate exactly.\n\nHowever, we note that the first two conditions update temp and q, and the last two conditions update w and e. And they set f in multiple places.\n\nWe'll do the same.\n\nBut note: the first condition and the second condition are mutually exclusive? Because if temp < a[i] then the second condition (temp > a[i]) is false. But what if temp == a[i]? Then neither runs? Then the next two conditions: if a[i] > w? and a[i] < w? \n\nWe'll do the same.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Step 1: Read n, then n pairs of integers.\n\n  Step 2: Allocate arrays a(n) and b(n).\n\n  Step 3: Initialize:\n          temp = 0\n          q = 0\n          w = 0\n          e = 0\n          f = .false.\n\n  Step 4: Loop i from 1 to n (note: Java uses 0-indexing, Fortran 1-indexing, but the logic is the same as long as we use the same indices for arrays).\n\n          Read a(i), b(i)\n\n          if (temp < a(i)) then\n              if (q > b(i)) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              q = b(i)\n              temp = a(i)\n          end if\n\n          if (temp > a(i)) then\n              if (q < b(i)) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              q = b(i)\n              temp = a(i)\n          end if\n\n          if (a(i) > w) then\n              w = a(i)\n              if (b(i) < e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              e = b(i)\n          end if\n\n          if (a(i) < w) then\n              if (b(i) > e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n          end if\n\n  Step 5: Then set the string based on f.\n\n  Step 6: Then process the string for the second program:\n\n          score = 0\n          len_str = len(str)   ! because str is allocatable and we know its length\n\n          do i = 1, len_str\n              if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then   ! because the second program uses 0-indexed: i-1 for the first character (which is index0 in Java)\n                  my_char = 'g'\n              else\n                  my_char = 'p'\n              end if\n\n              his_char = str(i:i)\n\n              if (my_char /= his_char) then\n                  if (my_char == 'p') then\n                      score = score + 1\n                  else\n                      score = score - 1\n                  end if\n              end if\n          end do\n\n  Step 7: Print score.\n\nNote: We must be cautious about the indexing in the second program: the original Java program uses 0-indexed for the string. In Fortran, the string index starts at 1. But the parity (even/odd) is determined by the position in the string (0-indexed in Java). So for the first character (Fortran index 1), the Java index is 0 -> even -> 'g'. So we use (i-1) mod 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n          do i = 1, len_str\n              if (mod(i,2) == 1) then   ! because in Fortran, the first character is at 1 -> which is odd, but in Java it was 0 (even). \n                                         ! So if we use mod(i-1,2)==0 then equivalent to mod(i,2)==1? \n                                         ! Actually: \n                                         !   i=1 -> mod(0,2)=0 -> even? Actually, we want the first character to be even? \n                                         ! But in the Java program: index0 -> even -> 'g'. \n                                         ! So for i=1 (Fortran) we want to be even? \n\n          How about: \n            We can think: the parity in the Java program is based on (index mod 2). \n            Fortran index i corresponds to Java index i-1.\n\n          So we do: \n            if (mod(i-1,2) == 0) -> then even -> 'g'\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (mod(i,2) == 1) then   ! because (i-1) mod 2 = mod(i+1,2) mod2? Actually: \n                i=1 -> mod(1,2)=1 -> then we want to assign 'g'? but that would be the even index in Java? \n                Actually, the mapping: \n                    Java index0 (even) -> Fortran i=1 -> we want to assign 'g'\n                    Java index1 (odd) -> Fortran i=2 -> we want to assign 'p'\n\n          But note: mod(i-1,2) for i=1: mod(0,2)=0 -> then we assign 'g'. For i=2: mod(1,2)=1 -> then we assign 'p'. That matches.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the Java program uses:\n\n                char my = i % 2 == 0 ? 'g' : 'p';\n\n          So we do:\n\n                if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n                    my_char = 'g'\n                else\n                    my_char = 'p'\n                end if\n\n  Step 8: Print the score.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e, score, len_str\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n  logical :: f\n  character(:), allocatable :: str\n\n  Read n\n  Allocate a(n), b(n)\n\n  ... (the rest as above)\n\nBut note: the original first program does not require storing the entire arrays beyond the loop? Actually, we are storing in arrays but then we don't use them again. We could avoid storing the entire arrays and just read and process each pair? \n\nThe original Java program does:\n\n      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          a[i] = in.nextInt();\n          b[i] = in.nextInt();\n          ... (process using a[i] and b[i] and then update variables)\n      }\n\nSo we don't need the arrays after the loop. We can avoid storing the entire arrays.\n\nWe'll change:\n\n  Instead of allocating arrays, we can read each pair and then discard.\n\n  So:\n\n      integer :: a_val, b_val\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          read(*,*) a_val, b_val\n          ... (use a_val and b_val in the conditions)\n      end do\n\nThis is more memory efficient.\n\nSo we'll do that.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\n  program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e, score, len_str\n      integer :: a_val, b_val\n      logical :: f\n      character(:), allocatable :: str\n\n      !

This position is even in the original index -> we use 'g'\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  ! But note: the condition is if they are different\n                  if ('p' == 'g') then ! This is always false? Wait, we are comparing the expected with the actual?\n                  ! Actually: we have:\n                  !   my_char should be 'g' at even indices.\n                  !   his_char is str(i:i)\n                  !   if they are different, then we do:\n                  !       if my_char is 'p' then add 1, else subtract 1.\n                  ! But here my_char is 'g', so we subtract 1.\n\n                  ! So we can do:\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else\n              ! The above if condition for the character comparison? Actually, we did not check if they are different? \n              ! We need to check if the expected (my_char) is not equal to the actual.\n\n              ! Let's restructure:\n\n              ! Instead, we can do:\n\n              !   if (mod(i-1,2)==0) then\n              !       if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n              !           score = score - 1\n              !       end if\n              !   else\n              !       if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n              !           score = score + 1\n              !       end if\n              !   end if\n\n              ! This is equivalent to the original logic.\n\n          end if\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if (mod(i-1,2) == 0) then\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n                  score = score + 1\n              end if\n          end if\n\n      But note: the original does:\n\n          if (my != his) {\n              score += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1;\n          }\n\n      So if my is 'g' and his is not 'g', then we subtract 1. If my is 'p' and his is not 'p', then we add 1.\n\n      This is exactly the same as:\n\n          if (my is 'g' and his is not 'g') -> subtract 1.\n          if (my is 'p' and his is not 'p') -> add 1.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if (mod(i-1,2) == 0) then   ! my is 'g'\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else                         ! my is 'p'\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n                  score = score + 1\n              end if\n          end if\n\n      This is simpler and avoids an extra variable.\n\n      We'll do that.\n\n      So the inner loop becomes:\n\n          if (mod(i-1,2) == 0) then\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n                  score = score + 1\n              end if\n          end if\n\n      End do\n\n      Print score.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the original second program does not care about the case when they are equal? Then we do nothing.\n\n  We are doing the same.\n\n  Finally, we print the score.\n\n  Let's write the entire code.\n\n  Note: We must be cautious about the initial values of w and e. In the first program, we have:\n\n        if (a[i] > w) {\n            w = a[i];\n            if (b[i] < e) {\n                f = true;\n            }\n            e = b[i];\n        }\n\n  But initially w=0 and e=0. Then the first pair: if a_val>0, then we set w = a_val, and then check if b_val < e (which is 0). So if b_val is negative? But the problem does not specify the range of a and b. However, the original problem (codeforces 456 A) is about laptop prices and quality, so they are positive. But we'll assume non-negative.\n\n  But note: the condition (b_val < e) when e is 0: if b_val is negative then we set f. But if the problem states positive, then we are safe? However, the problem says: \"The next n lines contain two numbers each: the i-th line contains ai and bi (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai,\u2009bi\u2009\u2264\u2009n).\" so they are at least 1.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Code:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e, score, len_str\n      integer :: a_val, b_val\n      logical :: f\n      character(:), allocatable :: str\n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      temp = 0\n      q = 0\n      w = 0\n      e = 0\n      f = .false.\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          read(*,*) a_val, b_val\n\n          if (temp < a_val) then\n              if (q > b_val .and. i > 1) then   ! Actually, the first time q=0 and b_val>=1, so it would be false. But note: the condition is independent of i? \n                  f = .true.                     ! However, the original program doesn't have an i>1 condition. \n              end if                             ! But in the first iteration, temp=0 and a_val>=1 -> we enter the first block. Then we set q = b_val and temp = a_val. \n              q = b_val\n              temp = a_val\n          end if\n\n          if (temp > a_val) then\n              if (q < b_val) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              q = b_val\n              temp = a_val\n          end if\n\n          if (a_val > w) then\n              w = a_val\n              if (b_val < e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              e = b_val\n          end if\n\n          if (a_val < w) then\n              if (b_val > e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Now set the string\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy Alex\"\n      else\n          str = \"Poor Alex\"\n      end if\n\n      score = 0\n      len_str = len(str)\n\n      do i = 1, len_str\n          if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n              ! Expected 'g'\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else\n              ! Expected 'p'\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n                  score = score + 1\n              end if\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      write(*,*) score\n\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: the original first program sets `f` in multiple places. We are replicating the same.\n\nHowever, we note that the condition in the first block:\n\n      if (q > b_val) then\n\n  in the first iteration, q is 0 and b_val is at least 1 -> 0 > 1 is false. So it's safe.\n\nBut what if the first a_val is 0? The problem states ai>=1, so we are safe.\n\nLet's run a small test.\n\nExample for the first program: n=2, pairs: (1,2) and (2,1)\n\n  Iteration 1: a_val=1, b_val=2\n      temp=0 < 1 -> enter first block: \n          q=0, 0>2? false -> f remains false.\n          then set q=2, temp=1.\n      Then check: a_val=1>w=0 -> set w=1, then check b_val=2<e=0? false, then set e=2.\n      Then skip the last block (a_val=1 not less than w=1).\n\n  Iteration 2: a_val=2, b_val=1\n      temp=1 < 2 -> enter first block:\n          q=2 > b_val=1 -> true -> set f = .true.\n          then set q=1, temp=2.\n      Then a_val=2>w=1 -> set w=2, then check b_val=1<e=2 -> true -> set f=.true. (again, but already true) -> then set e=1.\n\n  So f becomes true -> output \"Happy Alex\".\n\nThen the second program processes \"Happy Alex\":\n\n  The string: \"Happy Alex\" (10 characters)\n\n  We'll compute:\n\n      i=1: index0 -> even -> 'g'; actual='H' -> not 'g' -> subtract 1 -> score = -1\n      i=2: index1 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='a' -> not 'p' -> add 1 -> score=0\n      i=3: index2 -> even -> 'g'; actual='p' -> not 'g' -> subtract 1 -> score=-1\n      i=4: index3 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='p' -> skip -> score=-1\n      i=5: index4 -> even -> 'g'; actual='y' -> not 'g' -> subtract 1 -> score=-2\n      i=6: index5 -> odd -> 'p'; actual=' ' -> not 'p' -> add 1 -> score=-1\n      i=7: index6 -> even -> 'g'; actual='A' -> not 'g' -> subtract 1 -> score=-2\n      i=8: index7 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='l' -> not 'p' -> add 1 -> score=-1\n      i=9: index8 -> even -> 'g'; actual='e' -> not 'g' -> subtract 1 -> score=-2\n      i=10: index9 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='x' -> not 'p' -> add 1 -> score=-1\n\n  So the output would be -1.\n\nBut the original chain would output -1? \n\nHowever, note: the original second program would read the string \"Happy Alex\" (with a newline? or without?) - the first program uses System.out.println which adds a newline? Then the second program reads the entire line? \n\nBut in the second Java program, they use:\n\n      String S = in.next();\n\n  This reads one token (without spaces). So actually, the second program would only read \"Happy\" as the first token? \n\nWait, the InputReader class in the second program uses:\n\n      public String next() {\n          while (tokenizer == null || !tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {\n              try {\n                  tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(reader.readLine());\n              } catch (IOException e) {\n                  throw new RuntimeException(e);\n              }\n          }\n          return tokenizer.nextToken();\n      }\n\n  So it reads a line and then tokenizes. The first call to next() returns the first token. So the string S would be \"Happy\", not \"Happy Alex\". \n\n  Therefore, the second program would only process \"Happy\" (5 letters) and then the next token would be \"Alex\", but it is not read because the program only calls next() once.\n\n  This changes everything.\n\n  Correction: the first program outputs a string that is either \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\", but the second program only takes the first token? So the string S is either \"Happy\" or \"Poor\".\n\n  We must adjust: the second program only processes the first word.\n\n  How to fix?\n\n  In the first program, the output is:\n\n        if (f == true) {\n            System.out.println(\"Happy Alex\");\n        } else System.out.println(\"Poor Alex\");\n\n  This prints a line: the entire string including the space and then a newline.\n\n  But the second program's InputReader reads a line and then tokenizes. The first token (by next()) is the first word.\n\n  Therefore, the second program only gets the first word.\n\n  So we should set:\n\n        if (f) then\n            str = \"Happy\"   ! 5 characters\n        else\n            str = \"Poor\"    ! 4 characters\n        end if\n\n  Then the second program processes only that word.\n\n  But note: the original second program would then output the score for that word.\n\n  Therefore, we change the string to the first word only.\n\n  So in the Fortran code, after the first program's loop:\n\n        if (f) then\n            str = \"Happy\"\n        else\n            str = \"Poor\"\n        end if\n\n  Then we process the string of length 5 (or 4).\n\n  Now, let's recompute the example:\n\n      f is true -> str = \"Happy\"\n\n      i=1: index0 -> even -> 'g'; actual='H' -> not 'g' -> -1 -> score=-1\n      i=2: index1 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='a' -> not 'p' -> +1 -> score=0\n      i=3: index2 -> even -> 'g'; actual='p' -> not 'g' -> -1 -> score=-1\n      i=4: index3 -> odd -> 'p'; actual='p' -> skip -> score=-1\n      i=5: index4 -> even -> 'g'; actual='y' -> not 'g' -> -1 -> score=-2\n\n      Then output -2.\n\n  But what if we had \"Poor\"?\n\n      str = \"Poor\" (4 characters)\n\n      i=1: 'g' vs 'P' -> not 'g' -> -1\n      i=2: 'p' vs 'o' -> not 'p' -> +1 -> 0\n      i=3: 'g' vs 'o' -> not 'g' -> -1\n      i=4: 'p' vs 'r' -> not 'p' -> +1 -> 0\n\n      So output 0.\n\n  Therefore, we must change the string to the first word.\n\n  So the corrected Fortran code:\n\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy\"\n      else\n          str = \"Poor\"\n      end if\n\n  Then proceed.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, temp, q, w, e, score, len_str\n      integer :: a_val, b_val\n      logical :: f\n      character(:), allocatable :: str\n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      temp = 0\n      q = 0\n      w = 0\n      e = 0\n      f = .false.\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          read(*,*) a_val, b_val\n\n          if (temp < a_val) then\n              if (q > b_val) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              q = b_val\n              temp = a_val\n          end if\n\n          if (temp > a_val) then\n              if (q < b_val) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              q = b_val\n              temp = a_val\n          end if\n\n          if (a_val > w) then\n              w = a_val\n              if (b_val < e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n              e = b_val\n          end if\n\n          if (a_val < w) then\n              if (b_val > e) then\n                  f = .true.\n              end if\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      if (f) then\n          str = \"Happy\"\n      else\n          str = \"Poor\"\n      end if\n\n      score = 0\n      len_str = len(str)\n\n      do i = 1, len_str\n          if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'g') then\n                  score = score - 1\n              end if\n          else\n              if (str(i:i) /= 'p') then\n                  score = score + 1\n              end if\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      write(*,*) score\n\n      end program combined\n\nBut note: the original second program prints the score and then a newline. We use `write(*,*)` which adds a newline.\n\nThis should be the complete program.\n\nLet me test with the example above: n=2, pairs: (1,2) and (2,1) -> we get f=true -> str=\"Happy\", then score=-2.\n\nWe can run that.\n\nBut note: the original first program would output \"Happy Alex\", but the second program only takes the first token \"Happy\". So our simulation is correct.\n\nWe are done."
