Let me restructure:\n\n        invalid = .false. do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) line(1:m)\n            ... find dexG and dexS ... if (dexG>dexS) invalid=.true.\n            diffs(i) = dexS - dexG   ! we store even if invalid? but we won't use it if invalid. end do\n\n        if (invalid) then\n            res = -1\n        else\n            ... count distinct in diffs(1:n) -> res = distinct_count\n        end if\n\n   This is the same as the Java program. But note: the Java program does:\n\n        int [] length = new int[n];\n        int index = 0;\n        for (String tmp : arrs) {\n            ... \n            length[index++] = dexS - dexG;\n        } So it always stores the difference. Therefore, we do the same. One more issue: what if m is 0? Then we don't read any strings? But n and m are positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the Java program would read. We assume n>=1 and m>=1. Also, the array `diffs` is dimensioned to 100. We assume n<=100. How to handle larger?",

Actually, the difference is at most m-1? Because positions go from 1 to m. So max diff = m-1. We can set:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:max_diff) :: seen\n        max_diff = m   ! because m might be 100, then 0:100 -> 101 elements? but m-1 is max. But we don't know m at compile time? We can use:\n\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: seen\n        allocate(seen(0:max_diff))\n\n   But note: max_diff = m   (because the difference can be from 0 to m-1, but we can set max_diff = m-1? but m is known at runtime). Alternatively, we can avoid the array and use a loop to count distinct? with n<=100, we can do:\n\n        distinct_count = 0 do i = 1, n\n            flag = .true. do j = 1, i-1\n                if (diffs(j) == diffs(i)) then\n                    flag = .false. exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (flag) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n        end do\n\n   This is O(n^2) but n<=100 is acceptable. But the original Java program uses a HashSet which is O(n). But n is small. We can do:\n\n        distinct_count = 0 do i = 1, n\n            duplicate = .false. do j = 1, i-1\n                if (diffs(i) == diffs(j)) then\n                    duplicate = .true. exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. duplicate) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n        end do\n\n   This is simpler. So we change:\n\n        if (invalid) then\n            res = -1\n        else\n            distinct_count = 0 do i = 1, n\n                duplicate = .false. do j = 1, i-1\n                    if (diffs(i) == diffs(j)) then\n                        duplicate = .true. exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (.not. duplicate) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n            end do\n            res = distinct_count\n        end if\n\n   This avoids the need for the `seen` array and its allocation. Let's write the complete program. Note: We must be careful with the array `diffs` for n. We assume n and m are read and n is at least 1. Steps:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, m, i, j, dexG, dexS, res, distinct_count\n        character(len=500) :: line   ! let's make it 500 to be safe for m up to 500? but the problem doesn't specify. integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: diffs\n        logical :: invalid, duplicate\n        character(len=20) :: output_str\n        integer :: k\n\n        !

Actually, we can do:\n\n            ! read(*, '(A)') line(1:m)   ! This reads exactly m characters? but the token is m?",

We store the grid? We don't store the entire grid, only the differences. However, we store the array `diffs` of size n. That's acceptable. Let me test with a small example. Example: Input: \n            2 2\n            GS\n            SG\n\n        First string: \n            dexG=1, dexS=2 -> diff=1\n        Second string:\n            dexG=2, dexS=1 -> invalid=true -> res=-1\n\n        Output: \"-1\"\n\n   Another example: Input:\n            2 3\n            G.S\n            .GS First string: \n            G at 1, S at 3 -> diff=2\n        Second string:\n            G at 2, S at 3 -> diff=1 Then distinct: [2,1] -> distinct_count=2\n\n        Output: \"2\"\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain would output \"2\" without commas? yes. So the above program should output \"2\". However, in the second example, we have a dot? The string \".GS\": \n        positions: \n          1: '.' -> skip\n          2: 'G' -> dexG=2\n          3: 'S' -> dexS=3 -> diff=1\n\n   So correct. But note: the second string is \".GS\", which is valid? because G (2) < S (3). Therefore, the program is as above. One more issue: the reading. We read the tokens using list-directed read.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first Java program (codeforces_400_B) reads integers n and m, then n strings of length m.\n    It then processes each string to find the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If in any string 'G' comes after 'S', it sets returnDex=-1.\n    Otherwise, it calculates the difference (dexS - dexG) for each string and stores in an array. Then it uses a set to count distinct differences.\n\n 2. The output of the first program is either:\n      - \"-1\" (if returnDex=-1) OR\n      - the number of distinct differences (set.size())\n\n 3. The second Java program (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string and replaces every comma with a space, then outputs the string.\n\n However, note: the second program reads from standard input. But in the chain, the output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\n So, the entire chain would be:\n   Input to the first program: n, m and then n strings of length m.\n   Output of first program is a string (either \"-1\" or an integer) and that string is the input to the second program.\n\n The second program then replaces commas in that string by spaces. But note: the output of the first program does not contain commas? \n Actually, the first program outputs an integer (without commas) or the string \"-1\". Therefore, the second program would just output the same integer (or -1) because there are no commas to replace.\n\n However, let's see the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        First program outputs \"-1\", then second program reads the string \"-1\", replaces commas (there are none) and outputs \"-1\".\n\n   Example 2:\n        First program outputs \"3\", then second program reads \"3\", replaces commas -> outputs \"3\".\n\n So the net effect is that the output of the chain is the same as the output of the first program? \n\n But wait, the second program replaces commas by spaces. Why? The problem says the output of the first program is used as input to the second.\n\n However, the first program outputs an integer (without commas) so the second program just outputs the same integer. \n\n But note: the second program is designed to read a line and replace commas. The problem says the entire sequence. \n\n Since the first program outputs an integer (without commas) then the second program will not change the string.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n So the Fortran program must:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m, then n strings of length m (each string is m characters long).\n   Step 2: Process as the first Java program: for each string, find the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If in any string the 'G' is after 'S', then the result is -1.\n            Otherwise, compute the differences (dexS - dexG) for each string and then count the distinct differences.\n\n   Step 3: Then, take the string representation of the result (either the integer or the string '-1') and replace every comma by a space? \n            But note: the result from step2 is an integer and we are going to output it as a string without commas. So there is nothing to replace.\n\n However, the second Java program does not know that. It simply replaces every comma in the input string by a space. \n\n Since the output of step2 is a string without commas, then step3 (the second program) does nothing.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\n But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". So we must simulate both programs.\n\n However, the second program is designed to read a line and replace commas. The input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\n The first program outputs either:\n      System.out.println(returnDex);   -> which is either \"-1\" or an integer (without commas)\n\n Then the second program reads that entire line and replaces commas. Since there are no commas, it outputs the same string.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\n But wait, what if the first program outputs a string that contains commas? It doesn't. \n\n So we can skip the second program? \n\n However, to be faithful, we must implement the chain. We are going to:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m and the grid of n strings of length m.\n   Step 2: Process the grid to get the result (either -1 or the number of distinct differences).\n   Step 3: Convert the result to a string and then replace any commas in that string by spaces? But note: the result is an integer or -1, so no commas.\n\n   But the second program replaces commas in the input string. Since the input to the second program is the output string of the first, and that string has no commas, we can simply output the string.\n\n However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must output the same as the second program.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   We are going to form a string from the result of step2 (call it `result_str`). Then we will replace every comma in `result_str` by a space? \n   But note: the second program replaces commas by spaces. However, `result_str` has no commas. So we can just output `result_str`.\n\n But what if the first program outputs a string that has commas? It does not. So we are safe.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate the second program: read the output of the first as a string and then replace commas. But note: we are in one program.\n\n We can avoid the intermediate string if we just output the integer? But the second program might output the integer with a newline? The first program uses println, so the string has a newline? \n\n The second program reads a line (so including the newline? or without?) and then replaces commas and outputs. Actually, the second program uses `readLine()` and then replaces commas and then outputs. So the newline is part of the string? \n\n Example: \n        First program: System.out.println(-1) -> outputs \"-1\\n\"\n        Second program: reads the entire line (without the newline? because `readLine()` strips the newline) and then outputs the replaced string and then ...? \n\n The second program: \n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        String a = br.readLine();   -> if the first program output \"-1\\n\", then `a` is \"-1\" (without the newline).\n        Then it appends the replaced string (which is \"-1\" with commas replaced -> still \"-1\") and then outputs using System.out.println? No, it does System.out.println(sb) -> which adds a newline.\n\n So the output of the chain is:\n        For -1: the string \"-1\" followed by a newline.\n\n Without the chain, the first program outputs \"-1\" and a newline. The second program reads that, and then outputs \"-1\" and a newline? \n\n Actually, the second program uses `System.out.println(sb)`, which appends a newline. So the output is the same.\n\n Therefore, we can simply output the integer (or -1) with a newline and we are done? \n\n But note: the second program is designed for a general string that may contain commas. However, in our case, the output of the first program does not contain commas. \n\n However, to be generic and follow the chain, we should:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the result (an integer, or -1) and convert it to a string (without any commas, so no change needed).\n   Step 2: Then, we should take that string and replace any commas (if present) by spaces. Then output that string.\n\n Since we know the string doesn't have commas, we can skip the replacement? But what if the first program outputs a number with commas? It doesn't. \n\n The first program outputs either:\n      System.out.println(returnDex);   -> which prints the integer without any formatting (so no commas).\n\n Therefore, the string representation of the integer does not have commas.\n\n So the Fortran program:\n\n   We'll do:\n      Read n, m and the n strings.\n\n      Process the strings to get the result (call it `res`).\n\n      Convert `res` to a string. Then, in Fortran, we can output that string without any commas? But we don't have commas. So we can output the integer.\n\n      However, the chain requires that we then take that string and replace commas by spaces. Since there are none, we just output the string.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java outputs the string and then a newline? Yes.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        if (res == -1) then\n            write(*,*) -1   ! This will output: -1 and a newline? But note: in Fortran, list-directed write might add a space at the beginning? \n        else\n            write(*,*) res   ! same issue: might have leading space and no control over formatting.\n\n   However, we want exactly the same output as the chain: without any extra spaces.\n\n   We can use formatted output.\n\n   Alternatively, we can form a string and then output without any extra spaces.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        integer :: res\n\n        ... compute res ...\n\n        if (res == -1) then\n            str = \"-1\"\n        else\n            write(str, '(I0)') res   ! I0: integer without leading spaces\n        end if\n\n        Then, we need to replace commas in `str` by spaces? But we know there are none. However, to be safe, we can scan the string and replace any commas.\n\n        Then output the string without any extra spaces and a newline.\n\n   But note: the second program outputs the string and then a newline? So we output the string and then a newline.\n\n   How to output without extra spaces? We can:\n\n        write(*, '(a)') trim(adjusted_string)\n\n   But note: the string we form might have trailing spaces? We can remove them? However, the integer string has no trailing spaces? \n\n   Alternatively, we can:\n\n        ! After forming the string without commas, output the non-blank part.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n          str = adjustl(str)   ! remove leading spaces, but our integer string has no leading spaces? because we use I0.\n\n        But the replacement of commas: we can do:\n\n          do i = 1, len_trim(str)\n             if (str(i:i) == ',') then\n                 str(i:i) = ' '\n             end if\n          end do\n\n        Then output: write(*, '(a)') trim(str)\n\n   But note: the second program does not trim the string. It outputs the entire line. However, the integer string we form has no trailing spaces? because we write with I0 and then we trim? \n\n   Actually, the string we form for the integer (using I0) will have no leading or trailing spaces. Then we replace commas (none) and then output. \n\n   But what if the integer is negative? We have the minus sign. That's fine.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the string if we note there are no commas? But to be safe and follow the chain, we do the replacement.\n\n   However, the problem says: the entire chain. So we must do the replacement.\n\n   But note: the second program reads the entire line and then replaces every comma by a space. The entire line? So if the first program output multiple integers? It doesn't: only one integer.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and m and the n strings.\n\n        Step 2: Process the strings:\n\n                res = -1   if any string has G after S? (i.e., if the index of G is greater than the index of S, then invalid)\n                Otherwise, compute an array of differences (dexS - dexG) for each row, then count distinct differences.\n\n        Step 3: Convert the integer `res` to a string without leading spaces (using I0).\n\n        Step 4: In that string, replace every comma by a space? (Note: Fortran uses commas in numbers? No, in output we don't. So no commas.)\n\n        Step 5: Output the string.\n\n   But note: the second program outputs the entire string and then a newline. So we output the string and then a newline.\n\n   However, the first program might output a negative integer? Yes: -1.\n\n   How to convert -1 to string? We write it as a string.\n\n   Example: \n        res = -1 -> write(str, '(I0)') res -> str = \"-1\"\n\n   Then we replace commas: none -> output \"-1\"\n\n   For a positive integer, say 3 -> \"3\"\n\n   So we are done.\n\n   But note: the first Java program outputs the integer without any extra spaces? Yes.\n\n   The second program outputs the same without any extra spaces? Yes.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: n, m, i, j, dexG, dexS, res, idx, distinct_count\n        character(len=100) :: line  ! to read each string, assuming m<=100\n        integer, dimension(100) :: diffs   ! assuming n<=100\n        logical :: invalid\n        character(len=20) :: output_str\n        integer :: k\n\n        ! Step 1: Read n and m\n        read(*,*) n, m\n\n        invalid = .false.\n        idx = 1\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) line(1:m)   ! read a string of length m? But Fortran: we read as a string of m characters? \n            ! But note: the input strings are given without spaces? So we can read as a string of length m.\n\n            ! We'll read the next token as a string of m characters? \n            ! However, the input might have each string on a separate line? The Java program uses sc.next() which reads tokens (separated by whitespace). \n            ! But the problem says: the entire sequence. The input format is: first line: n and m, then n lines? or one line with n tokens? \n\n            ! The Java program: \n            !   int n = sc.nextInt();\n            !   int m = sc.nextInt();\n            !   for (int i=0; i<n; i++) arrs[i] = sc.next();\n            !\n            ! The sc.next() reads the next token (which is a string of m characters). The tokens could be on the same line or next lines? \n            ! We don't know. So we must read each token? \n\n            ! How about we read the next m characters? But the input might have multiple tokens per line? \n\n            ! Alternatively, we can read the next token (using list-directed read) which will read a string without spaces? \n\n            ! But note: the strings are of length m and they might contain any character? and they are contiguous. \n\n            ! Since the problem does not specify, we assume each string is on a separate line? Or the tokens are separated by space? \n\n            ! The problem says: the same input. So we can read tokens.\n\n            ! We'll do: \n            !   read(*,*) line(1:m)   -> but this will read a token of up to m characters? Actually, if the token is longer, it will read only m? \n\n            ! But the token is exactly m characters? \n\n            ! We'll read the next token as a string of length m? \n\n            ! However, in Fortran, if we do:\n\n            !   read(*,*) str(1:m)\n\n            ! it will read the next token and put the first m characters? But if the token is exactly m, then it's okay.\n\n            ! But the problem: the token might be exactly m. So we can read.\n\n            ! However, let's do: read a token of length m? \n\n            ! We can do:\n\n            !   read(*, '(A)') line(1:m)   -> but this reads exactly m characters? including if the next token is on the same line? \n\n            ! We don't know the line structure. The problem says: the entire sequence. The input is the same as for the first program.\n\n            ! The first program uses Scanner which by default uses whitespace as delimiter. So the tokens are separated by whitespace.\n\n            ! Therefore, we can read each token as a string of m characters? \n\n            ! How about we read the next token (using list-directed read) into a variable of length m? \n\n            ! Example:\n\n            !   character(len=m) :: token   ! but m is variable, so we cannot do that.\n\n            ! Instead, we have declared `line` as 100. So we can read:\n\n            !   read(*,*) line(1:m)\n\n            ! But list-directed read will read a token and put it in the variable. If the token is longer than m, it will read only m? and the rest remains? \n\n            ! Actually, it will read the next token and assign it to the variable. If the token is shorter than m, the rest is padded with spaces. If longer, it is truncated? \n\n            ! But the token is exactly of length m? \n\n            ! Since the problem says the strings are of length m, we assume they are exactly m.\n\n            ! So we can do:\n\n            read(*,*) line(1:m)   ! This reads a token and puts the first m characters? Actually, it reads a token and assigns to the variable `line(1:m)`. \n            ! But note: the token might be m characters? and we are reading into a substring of length m? \n\n            ! Now, find 'G' and 'S' in line(1:m)\n\n            dexG = 0\n            dexS = 0\n            do j = 1, m\n                if (line(j:j) == 'G') then\n                    dexG = j\n                else if (line(j:j) == 'S') then\n                    dexS = j\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            ! If we found both? Actually, the problem says each string has one G and one S? \n\n            ! Check: if dexG is 0 or dexS is 0? the problem says \"each string\", so we assume they are present.\n\n            if (dexG == 0 .or. dexS == 0) then\n                ! According to the problem, this should not happen. But we set invalid?\n                ! The Java program: if dexG>dexS -> invalid. Otherwise, store dexS-dexG.\n                ! If one is missing, then the indexOf returns -1? In Java, indexOf returns -1 if not found. \n                ! In our code, we set dexG and dexS to 0 if not found? Then if dexG>dexS: 0>0? false. But if one is missing, then we get 0 and the other a positive index? \n                ! Example: if G is missing, dexG=0, dexS>0 -> then dexG<dexS -> valid? But the problem says each string has one G and one S? \n\n                ! So we assume both are present.\n\n            end if\n\n            if (dexG > dexS) then\n                invalid = .true.\n            end if\n\n            diffs(idx) = dexS - dexG\n            idx = idx + 1\n        end do\n\n        if (invalid) then\n            res = -1\n        else\n            ! Count distinct values in diffs(1:n)\n            ! We can sort and then traverse?\n            ! Or use an array to mark? But the differences can be up to m (which is <=100? the problem doesn't say, but we assume small)\n\n            ! Let's create a boolean array for the possible values? \n            ! But the difference can be negative? No, because we only store when dexG<=dexS, so non-negative.\n\n            ! Alternatively, we can use a set? But Fortran doesn't have built-in set. We can use an array of booleans for [0:max_diff]?\n\n            ! But note: the problem does not specify the constraints. We assume n<=100 and m<=100.\n\n            ! We'll do:\n\n            integer, dimension(0:100) :: seen   ! indices from 0 to 100, because diff = dexS-dexG, and m<=100 -> max diff=100\n            seen = 0\n            distinct_count = 0\n\n            do i = 1, n\n                if (seen(diffs(i)) == 0) then\n                    distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n                    seen(diffs(i)) = 1\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            res = distinct_count\n        end if\n\n        ! Now, form the string representation of res\n        if (res == -1) then\n            output_str = \"-1\"\n        else\n            write(output_str, '(I0)') res\n        end if\n\n        ! Replace commas by spaces in output_str? \n        do k = 1, len_trim(output_str)\n            if (output_str(k:k) == ',') then\n                output_str(k:k) = ' '\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Output the string\n        write(*, '(a)') trim(output_str)\n\n        end program\n\n   However, note: the first program does not set res=-1 only when one invalid is found? It sets returnDex=-1 if at least one string has G after S.\n\n   We set invalid to true if at least one string has dexG>dexS. Then we set res=-1.\n\n   But note: the Java program breaks? It doesn't break, but after the loop, if returnDex was set to -1, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the set size.\n\n   We are doing the same.\n\n   But note: in the Java program, even if one string is invalid, it still computes the differences for all? Yes, but then it ignores the set and outputs -1.\n\n   We do: we set invalid=.true. and then at the end, if invalid, we set res=-1.\n\n   We don't break the loop because we are still reading the strings? Actually, we are reading the entire n strings. The Java program also reads all.\n\n   So the above is correct.\n\n   However, the array `diffs` is computed even when invalid? But that's okay because we don't use it when invalid.\n\n   But note: the Java program does compute the differences even when invalid? Yes, but then it doesn't use them.\n\n   We do the same.\n\n   But we can avoid the distinct_count computation when invalid? We do: we compute the distinct_count only when invalid is false.\n\n   The above code does that.\n\n   Let me restructure:\n\n        invalid = .false.\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) line(1:m)\n            ... find dexG and dexS ...\n            if (dexG>dexS) invalid=.true.\n            diffs(i) = dexS - dexG   ! we store even if invalid? but we won't use it if invalid. \n        end do\n\n        if (invalid) then\n            res = -1\n        else\n            ... count distinct in diffs(1:n) -> res = distinct_count\n        end if\n\n   This is the same as the Java program.\n\n   But note: the Java program does:\n\n        int[] length = new int[n];\n        int index = 0;\n        for (String tmp : arrs) {\n            ... \n            length[index++] = dexS - dexG;\n        }\n\n   So it always stores the difference.\n\n   Therefore, we do the same.\n\n   One more issue: what if m is 0? Then we don't read any strings? But n and m are positive? The problem doesn't specify, but the Java program would read.\n\n   We assume n>=1 and m>=1.\n\n   Also, the array `diffs` is dimensioned to 100. We assume n<=100.\n\n   How to handle larger? We can use:\n\n        integer, allocatable :: diffs(:)\n        allocate(diffs(n))\n\n   But the problem does not specify constraints. However, the original Java program uses an array of size n. So we can allocate.\n\n   Since we don't know the maximum, we can do:\n\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: diffs\n        allocate(diffs(n))\n\n   Similarly, the `seen` array: we can make it from 0 to m? \n\n        integer, dimension(0:100) :: seen   ! if m<=100, then max diff is 100, but what if m>100? \n\n   Actually, the difference is at most m-1? Because positions go from 1 to m. So max diff = m-1.\n\n   We can set:\n\n        integer, dimension(0:max_diff) :: seen\n        max_diff = m   ! because m might be 100, then 0:100 -> 101 elements? but m-1 is max.\n\n   But we don't know m at compile time? We can use:\n\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: seen\n        allocate(seen(0:max_diff))\n\n   But note: max_diff = m   (because the difference can be from 0 to m-1, but we can set max_diff = m-1? but m is known at runtime).\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the array and use a loop to count distinct? with n<=100, we can do:\n\n        distinct_count = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            flag = .true.\n            do j = 1, i-1\n                if (diffs(j) == diffs(i)) then\n                    flag = .false.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (flag) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n        end do\n\n   This is O(n^2) but n<=100 is acceptable.\n\n   But the original Java program uses a HashSet which is O(n). But n is small.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        distinct_count = 0\n        do i = 1, n\n            duplicate = .false.\n            do j = 1, i-1\n                if (diffs(i) == diffs(j)) then\n                    duplicate = .true.\n                    exit\n                end if\n            end do\n            if (.not. duplicate) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n        end do\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   So we change:\n\n        if (invalid) then\n            res = -1\n        else\n            distinct_count = 0\n            do i = 1, n\n                duplicate = .false.\n                do j = 1, i-1\n                    if (diffs(i) == diffs(j)) then\n                        duplicate = .true.\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (.not. duplicate) distinct_count = distinct_count + 1\n            end do\n            res = distinct_count\n        end if\n\n   This avoids the need for the `seen` array and its allocation.\n\n   Let's write the complete program.\n\n   Note: We must be careful with the array `diffs` for n.\n\n   We assume n and m are read and n is at least 1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, m, i, j, dexG, dexS, res, distinct_count\n        character(len=500) :: line   ! let's make it 500 to be safe for m up to 500? but the problem doesn't specify. \n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: diffs\n        logical :: invalid, duplicate\n        character(len=20) :: output_str\n        integer :: k\n\n        !

We store the grid? We don't store the entire grid, only the differences.\n\n   However, we store the array `diffs` of size n. That's acceptable.\n\n   Let me test with a small example.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            2 2\n            GS\n            SG\n\n        First string: \n            dexG=1, dexS=2 -> diff=1\n        Second string:\n            dexG=2, dexS=1 -> invalid=true -> res=-1\n\n        Output: \"-1\"\n\n   Another example:\n\n        Input:\n            2 3\n            G.S\n            .GS\n\n        First string: \n            G at 1, S at 3 -> diff=2\n        Second string:\n            G at 2, S at 3 -> diff=1\n        Then distinct: [2,1] -> distinct_count=2\n\n        Output: \"2\"\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain would output \"2\" without commas? yes.\n\n   So the above program should output \"2\".\n\n   However, in the second example, we have a dot? The string \".GS\": \n        positions: \n          1: '.' -> skip\n          2: 'G' -> dexG=2\n          3: 'S' -> dexS=3 -> diff=1\n\n   So correct.\n\n   But note: the second string is \".GS\", which is valid? because G (2) < S (3). \n\n   Therefore, the program is as above.\n\n   One more issue: the reading. We read the tokens using list-directed read. The tokens are separated by whitespace. But the problem says the input has n tokens (each of length m). \n\n   How does list-directed read work? It will skip whitespace and read the next non-whitespace token? \n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            2 2\n            GS\n            SG\n\n        The first read(*,*) n, m: reads 2 and 2.\n\n        Then the next read(*,*) line(1:2): reads the next token. The next token is \"GS\" (if on the next line) or if the same line? \n\n        But the input after \"2 2\" might be:\n\n            GS SG\n\n        Then the first token is \"GS\", the next token is \"SG\". \n\n        Or:\n\n            2 2\n            GS\n            SG\n\n        Then the first token is \"GS\" (on the next line) and the next token is \"SG\" (on the following line).\n\n        List-directed read skips leading whitespace and newlines? \n\n        So it should work.\n\n   However, if the tokens are separated by newline, the list-directed read will still read each token? \n\n   Yes.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me write the final code.\n\n   Note: We assume that the input tokens are exactly m characters long. If they are shorter, then the rest of the substring (line(1:m)) is padded with spaces? and then when we search for 'G' and 'S', we won't find them? \n\n   But the problem says the strings are of length m. So we assume they are exactly m.\n\n   If they are longer, then we read only the first m? and the rest remains in the input? which would be read by the next token? \n\n   But the tokens are exactly m. \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Code:"
