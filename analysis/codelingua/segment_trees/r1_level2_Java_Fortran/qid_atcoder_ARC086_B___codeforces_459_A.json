Since n>=2 (the array has at least two elements for the loops to run) and the opposite sign count can be 0 to n-1, the minimum k is 0 + (n-1) = n-1. The first program reads n, so n>=1. But the first loop runs for i from 1 to n-1? Actually, the first loop: for (int i=1; i<n; ...) so if n==1, then the first loop does nothing. Then the second loop (for opposite sign) runs for n indices? and then the propagation part: if a[m]>=0, then for i from 1 to n-1? but if n==1, that loop runs for i=1 to 0 -> skipped. So for n=1:\n          m is set to 0 (the only element). Then the second loop: i=0: condition a[m]>=0 ^ a[0]>=0 -> false (since both are the same) -> no operation added. Then the propagation: if a[0]>=0, then we do for i=1 to n-1 (which is 0) -> no operations. So k=0. Then output is:\n          0 That's one integer. Therefore, we cannot assume four integers.",

Actually, the first four tokens are:\n\n                token1 = k\n                token2 = first operation's first index\n                token3 = first operation's second index\n                token4 = second operation's first index [if exists]\n\n            So we can simulate:\n\n                token_list(1) = k\n\n                count = 1\n                need at least 4 tokens. Step 1: for i=1 to n:\n                    if ( (a(m)>=0 .and. a(i)<0) .or. (a(m)<0 .and. a(i)>=0) ) then\n                        count = count + 1\n                        token_list(count) = m   -> this is the first integer of the operation\n                        count = count + 1\n                        token_list(count) = i   -> second integer\n                        if (count>=4) then we have at least the first four tokens?",

But that's okay. But is it meaningful to form a square with these integers? Probably not, but we are mimicking the chain. This design is arbitrary, but it follows the requirement. Let's test with a small example for the first program:\n\n      Example: n=3, a = [3, -2, 1]   (Fortran: a(1)=3, a(2)=-2, a(3)=1)\n\n      Step1: find m: \n          abs(3)=3, abs(-2)=2, abs(1)=1 -> m=1 (since 3 is the largest) Opposite sign: \n          a(1)=3 (>=0), so we look for negative numbers: a(2)=-2 -> opposite -> add operation (1,2) [in Fortran indices: 1,2]\n          a(3)=1 -> nonnegative -> not opposite. Then, since a(1)>=0, we do propagation: \n          operations: \n              for i=1 to 2: \n                  operation1: (1,2) -> add 1,2 [but note: we already did the opposite sign operations, now we do propagation]\n                  operation2: (2,3) -> add 2,3\n\n          So total operations: opposite: one operation (1,2)\n              propagation: two operations (1,2) and (2,3) -> wait, no: the propagation operations are independent. The Java program:\n\n          First loop: for i=0..n-1: if opposite sign? \n                i=0: a[0]=3 -> same as a[m] (which is a[0]) -> skip.\n                i=1: a[1]=-2 -> opposite -> add (m+1, i+1) -> (1,2) [because m=0 -> 0+1=1, i=1 -> 1+1=2]\n                i=2: a[2]=1 -> same -> skip. Then propagation: since a[0]>=0, we do:\n                for i=0 to n-2: \n                    operation: (i+1, i+2) -> (1,2) and (2,3)\n\n          So total operations: \n                k=3\n                operations: \n                    (1,2) [from opposite sign]\n                    (1,2)   [from propagation: i=0: indices0->0 and 1 -> (1,2)]\n                    (2,3) [from propagation: i=1: indices1 and 2 -> (2,3)] So the tokens: \n                k = 3\n                op1: 1 2\n                op2: 1 2\n                op3: 2 3\n\n          The first four tokens: 3, 1, 2, 1. Then the second program: \n                x1=3, y1=1, x2=2, y2=1. Now, check:\n              if x1==x2? 3==2? no. if y1==y2? 1==1? yes -> then we do:\n                  dif = |3-2| = 1\n                  output: x1, y1+dif, x2, y2+dif -> 3, 1+1, 2, 1+1 -> 3,2,2,2. But is that a square? The points are (3,2) and (2,2) -> that's only two points. The second program is supposed to output the two other points? The second program's logic: \n            Input: x1, y1, x2, y2 = 3,1,2,1 -> two points: (3,1) and (2,1). Then it assumes these are two points of a square. Then, because y1==y2 (both 1), it outputs: \n                (x1, y1+dif) and (x2, y2+dif) -> (3,1+1) = (3,2) and (2,1+1)=(2,2). That forms a square: (3,1), (2,1), (3,2), (2,2). So it is correct. Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.

This might not form a square, but we are following the chain. However, the example worked. Let me test with n=2, a = [1, -1] (so that we get enough tokens)\n\n      n=2, a=[1, -1]\n\n      m: abs(1)=1, abs(-1)=1 -> so m=1 (the first occurrence) or m=2? the Java program: \n          for (int i=1; i<n; i++) ... \n          i=1: compare a[0] (1) and a[1] (-1): abs(1)=1, abs(-1)=1 -> not greater, so m remains 0 (if 0-indexed). In our Fortran, we start at m=1, then i=2: compare a(2) to a(1): abs(-1)=1 not greater than abs(1)=1 -> so m=1. Opposite signs: \n          a(1)=1>=0, a(2)=-1<0 -> opposite -> count_opposite=1.\n      total_ops = 1 + (2-1)=2.\n\n      tokens(1)=2. Then, opposite sign operations: \n          i=1: skip? i=2: opposite -> \n              tokens(2)=m=1\n              tokens(3)=i=2 -> count_tokens=3 -> not 4, so we continue to propagation. Since a(1)=1>=0, we do propagation: \n          i=1: operation (1,2)\n              tokens(4)=1\n              count_tokens=4 -> we stop. Then tokens: [2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n      Then the second program: \n          x1=2, y1=1, x2=2, y2=1 -> but wait, the tokens(4)=1, so x2=2? and y2=1? Actually, our tokens: \n            tokens(1)=2 -> x1\n            tokens(2)=1 -> y1\n            tokens(3)=2 -> x2\n            tokens(4)=1 -> y2\n\n          Then: \n            x1==x2? 2==2 -> yes. dif = |1-1|=0\n            then output: x1+dif=2, y1=1, x1+dif=2, y2=1 -> 2 1 2 1. But that's the same point twice? However, the second program: Input: two points (2,1) and (2,1) -> same point. Then it assumes they are two points of a square? It would output: (2+0,1) and (2+0,1) -> the same two points. But a square needs two distinct points? The second program's condition: \n          if (x1 == x2) then ... \n          Here, they are the same, so it uses the difference in y (which is 0) and then outputs (x1+0, y1) and (x1+0, y2) -> which are (2,1) and (2,1). This is a degenerate square? But the problem says: the second program outputs the other two points?",

But the problem says the last block should produce output. The second program normally outputs to stdout. Given the instructions, I think we are allowed to only use stdout for the final output. For errors, we might not be able to mimic exactly. Since the problem is ambiguous, and to provide a working solution for valid inputs (n>=2, so k>=1, and then 1 + 2*k >= 3, but we need 4: so k>=2), I will assume that the input to the first program is such that the first program outputs at least 4 integers. How to ensure? For the first program, the number of operations k = (# of indices with opposite sign) + (n-1). The minimum k is n-1 (if there are no opposite signs). To have 1+2*k>=4, we need k>=2, so n-1>=2 -> n>=3. So if the user provides n>=3, then k>=2, and the total integers = 1+2*k>=5, which is>=4. For n=2: k = (# of opposite signs) + 1. The opposite signs: if the two elements have the same sign, then no opposite signs -> k=1. Then total integers= 1+2*1=3 -> not enough. if they have opposite signs, then k = 1 (from opposite sign) + 1 (propagation) = 2. Then total integers= 1+2*2=5 -> enough. So for n=2 with same sign, we only have 3 integers. Then we cannot.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nFirst Java program (atcoder_ARC086_B):\n  - Reads an integer `n`, then an array `a` of `n` integers.\n  - It then does some processing and outputs a sequence of operations (each operation is a string of the form \"i j\").\n  - The output format: first line is the number of operations, then each operation on a separate line.\n\nSecond Java program (codeforces_459_A):\n  - Reads four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 (which are the coordinates of two points).\n  - It then determines the other two points to form a square, or outputs -1 if not possible.\n\nHowever, note that the first program produces multiple lines of output. The second program expects exactly four integers.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nHow does the second program get its input?\n  - The first program outputs:\n        k   [number of operations]\n        op1\n        op2\n        ...\n        opk\n\n  - The second program expects 4 integers. This mismatch suggests that the chain is not direct? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". We must combine both.\n\nHowever, the second program does not read the entire output of the first. It only reads the next four integers? Actually, the second program reads from standard input, which after the first program would have the entire output of the first.\n\nBut the second program expects four integers. The output of the first program has at least one integer (the count) and then a list of pairs. This is a problem.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem: \n  \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nSo the entire output of the first program is the input to the second. But the second program only reads the first four tokens? That would break.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that we chain the programs in such a way that the second program is run multiple times? But the problem says the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program.\n\nAfter reading the first program: \n  The problem it solves is from ARC086_B. It is about \"Non-decreasing\". The program does:\n    - Finds the index `m` of the element with the maximum absolute value in the array.\n    - Then, it adds operations (strings) to an array `r`: for each index `i` where the sign of `a[m]` and `a[i]` are opposite, it adds an operation (m+1, i+1) to make the sign the same as `a[m]`.\n    - Then, if `a[m]` is non-negative, it does a forward sweep (from index0 to the end) to make the array non-decreasing? Actually, it adds operations to propagate the value at index m to the entire array by doing adjacent operations. Similarly, if negative, it does backward.\n\n  The output is the list of operations (each operation is two indices: i j, meaning we add a[j] = a[j] + a[i]).\n\n  The output format: first integer k (the count), then k lines of \"i j\".\n\nThe second program: \n  It reads four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2). It then prints either the two other points of the square or -1.\n\nBut how do we connect these two? The output of the first program is not four integers. \n\nThis suggests that the problem might have intended a different chain? Or perhaps the two programs are independent and we are supposed to run them in sequence on the same input? But the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nAlternatively, the example might be flawed? But we must follow the instructions.\n\nAfter reconsideration: the problem states that we are given a set of Java programs that are executed in sequence. The example provides two programs. The first program reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. The second program reads four integers. There is a mismatch.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nThe original chain: \n  Input to the first program: starts with an integer `n`, then `n` integers.\n  The first program outputs: \n        k\n        op1\n        op2\n        ...\n        opk\n\n  This output becomes the input to the second program. The second program then reads from that output. The second program expects four integers. However, the output of the first program is not necessarily four integers. It has at least one integer (k) and then k lines (each with two integers). \n\nThis will cause the second program to read the first integer as x1, the next two on the first op line as y1 and x2? That doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, I suspect that the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way. But the problem states they are. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that we chain the two programs by having the second program run multiple times? But the second program only runs once.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem has provided two independent programs and we are to run them in sequence, but the output of the first is not the input to the second? That contradicts the problem.\n\nLooking at the problem again: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nSo if there are two programs, then the input to the first is the original input, and the output of the first is the input to the second, and the output of the second is the final output.\n\nBut the example input for the first program is not the same as the input for the second. \n\nThis suggests that the example might be two separate problems? Or perhaps the problem is that we are to combine both programs into one that does both tasks? But the tasks are unrelated.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem intended the following:\n\n  The first program is run with the initial input (which is for the first program). Then the second program is run with the output of the first program as its input. The final output is the output of the second program.\n\nBut the second program expects four integers, and the first program outputs a variable number of integers (at least 1, then pairs). How can we reconcile?\n\nI notice that the first program's output starts with an integer k. Then k lines each with two integers. The second program expects four integers. \n\nIf we run the second program, it will read the first integer (k) as x1, then the next token (first integer of the first operation) as y1, then the next token (second integer of the first operation) as x2, then the next token (which would be the first integer of the second operation) as y2? That doesn't form a square.\n\nThis chain doesn't make sense. Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are not meant to be chained. But the problem says they are.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the two programs are two steps in a pipeline that is part of a larger context? But we are only given two.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the problem has a mistake. But the instructions are clear: we must chain the two.\n\nAnother possibility: the first program's output is not intended to be the input to the second program as we see. Instead, the second program is run multiple times? But the program only runs once.\n\nI see that the first program outputs a list of operations. The second program is about geometry. They are unrelated. \n\nAfter reading the problem statement again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we are to write a Fortran program that:\n  - Reads the input for the first Java program (an integer n, then n integers).\n  - Then, internally processes the first program's logic (without printing).\n  - Then, uses the output of the first program as the input to the second program. But note: the second program expects four integers. However, the output of the first program is a list of operations. \n\nHow can we make the second program work on the output of the first? \n\nUnless the intended chain is different. Or perhaps the problem is that we are to run the second program on each pair of points from the operations? But the second program only runs once.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire output of the first program is ignored and the second program reads the same initial input? But that contradicts.\n\nGiven the time, I will make a decision:\n\n  The problem might have intended that the two programs are independent and the chain is that the output of the first is the input to the second, but the second program is not designed to read the first program's output. Therefore, we must reinterpret the problem.\n\n  Since the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", we must run the first program and then run the second program on the same original input? But that doesn't use the output of the first as input to the second.\n\n  Or, the problem has a typo and the second program is meant to read the same input as the first? But the first program reads n and n integers, the second reads four integers.\n\n  Or, the problem is that we are to run the first program, and then the second program is run with the original input (ignoring the first program's output). But that is not chaining.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume the following based on the provided example:\n\n  The two programs are completely independent and are both run on the same input? But the input formats are different.\n\n  The first program expects:\n      n\n      a1 a2 ... an\n\n  The second program expects:\n      x1 y1 x2 y2\n\n  So they are different.\n\nTherefore, I suspect that the example provided two separate programs that are not meant to be chained. But the problem says they are to be executed in sequence.\n\nGiven the instructions, I must chain them. The only way is:\n\n  The first program runs and produces output. The second program reads the first program's output as its input. \n\n  But the second program expects four integers. So we must extract four integers from the first program's output to feed to the second.\n\n  How? The problem does not specify.\n\n  I will assume that we are to take the first four integers from the first program's output. The first program's output has:\n\n      k (an integer)\n      then k lines, each with two integers.\n\n  So the first four integers in the output are:\n\n      k, i1, j1, i2   [if k>=2, then the first operation is (i1, j1) and the second operation is (i2, j2) but we only take the first two operations?]\n\n  But then the second program would get:\n\n      x1 = k\n      y1 = i1\n      x2 = j1\n      y2 = i2   [the first integer of the second operation]\n\n  This is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, take the first two operations and flatten them? That would be 4 integers: i1, j1, i2, j2.\n\nBut the first line is k. Should we skip it? The second program doesn't know about the structure. It just reads four integers.\n\nSo if we feed the output of the first program to the second, the second program will read the first token as an integer (k), then the next three tokens (which are the next three integers) to form x1=k, y1, x2, y2.\n\nBut that might not make sense.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity, and since the problem is from two different sources (atcoder and codeforces), I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nHowever, to fulfill the requirement, I will design the Fortran program as follows:\n\n  1. Read the initial input. But we have two different input formats. The first program reads one format, the second another.\n\n  2. We must decide what the initial input is. The problem does not specify. It says \"when run on the same input\".\n\n  Since the first program is run first, the initial input must be the input for the first program: n and then n integers.\n\n  3. Then, we simulate the first program and capture its output (which is a list of integers: k and then k pairs).\n\n  4. Then, we extract four integers from this output to feed to the second program. But which four? \n\n  The problem says the entire sequence. The second program is run on the entire output of the first? But the second program only reads four integers. The rest of the output would be left unread? That is not identical.\n\n  Alternatively, the second program might read only the first four tokens and ignore the rest. But then the behavior is not the same as if the output of the first was fed to the second? Because the second program would only use the first four.\n\n  But the original second program, when run with the first program's output, would read the first four tokens and then stop? Or would it throw an exception if there are more? In Java, using Scanner, if there are extra tokens, they are left in the stream. But the program doesn't read them.\n\n  So in the Fortran program, we can do the same: take the first four integers from the first program's output and use them as the input to the second program.\n\n  How to choose the four integers? We take the first four tokens of the output of the first program.\n\n  The output of the first program is:\n\n      Line 1: one integer (k)\n      Line 2: two integers (i1 j1)\n      Line 3: two integers (i2 j2)\n      ...\n\n  So the first four tokens are: k, i1, j1, i2.\n\n  But note: the first program might output 0 operations. Then k=0, and there are no more tokens. The second program would then try to read four integers and fail.\n\n  We must handle that.\n\n  Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", if the first program outputs fewer than four integers, then the second program would not have enough input and would throw an exception. In Fortran, we would get an error.\n\n  To be safe, we can assume that the first program outputs at least four integers? But it might not.\n\n  Given the first program: \n      It outputs at least the integer k (so one integer). Then, it outputs k pairs (each pair is two integers). So the total number of integers is 1 + 2*k.\n\n      We need at least four integers: so 1+2*k >= 4  => 2*k>=3 => k>=2.\n\n  But k can be as low as 0? Let's see:\n\n      The first loop: it adds an operation for every index i where the sign of a[i] is opposite to a[m]. \n      Then it adds either n-1 operations (forward) or n-1 operations (backward).\n\n      So the total operations k = (# of indices with opposite sign) + (n-1).\n\n      Since n>=2 (the array has at least two elements for the loops to run) and the opposite sign count can be 0 to n-1, the minimum k is 0 + (n-1) = n-1.\n\n      The first program reads n, so n>=1. But the first loop runs for i from 1 to n-1? Actually, the first loop: for (int i=1; i<n; ...) so if n==1, then the first loop does nothing. Then the second loop (for opposite sign) runs for n indices? and then the propagation part: if a[m]>=0, then for i from 1 to n-1? but if n==1, that loop runs for i=1 to 0 -> skipped.\n\n      So for n=1:\n          m is set to 0 (the only element).\n          Then the second loop: i=0: condition a[m]>=0 ^ a[0]>=0 -> false (since both are the same) -> no operation added.\n          Then the propagation: if a[0]>=0, then we do for i=1 to n-1 (which is 0) -> no operations.\n          So k=0.\n\n      Then output is:\n          0\n\n      That's one integer.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot assume four integers.\n\n  In the original chain, if the first program outputs only one integer (0), then the second program will try to read four integers and fail (or get an exception). In Fortran, we would get an end-of-file or an error.\n\n  But the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must also fail in the same way.\n\n  However, the second Java program does not handle exceptions, so it would crash. In Fortran, we can simulate by reading and if we don't have enough, we output an error? but the problem says the last block should handle output. And the second program outputs either four integers or -1.\n\n  How does the second program behave if there are not enough integers? It would throw a `NoSuchElementException` and crash without output.\n\n  In Fortran, we can do:\n\n      We will read the first four integers from the first program's output tokens. If we cannot get four, then we output nothing? and crash? But the problem says the last block should handle output.\n\n  Alternatively, we could output -1 (which is what the second program outputs when it doesn't form a square) but that would be incorrect because the second program would crash.\n\n  Given the complexity and the fact that this chain might not be well-defined, I will assume that the input provided will be such that the first program outputs at least four integers. Otherwise, we output an error or mimic the Java behavior.\n\n  But the problem does not specify error handling.\n\n  To keep it simple, we will assume that the first program outputs at least four integers. We'll note that for n=1, it outputs only one integer, so we must avoid n=1. But the problem does not guarantee n>=2.\n\n  Therefore, I will change the plan: \n\n  We will run the first program's logic and store the output tokens (all integers) in an array. Then, if the number of tokens is less than 4, we will use the available tokens and then use zeros for the missing ones? That would not be identical.\n\n  Alternatively, if the number of tokens is less than 4, we output -1 (like the second program does for invalid input) and then exit. But that is not what the second program would do.\n\n  The second program expects four integers. If we provide fewer, it crashes. But in Fortran, we can check. Let's do:\n\n      We will simulate the first program and collect all the integers it would output (as if they were written to a file).\n\n      Then, we try to read four integers from that collection. If there are not enough, we mimic the Java exception by perhaps printing an error to stderr and exiting? But the problem says the last block should produce output. The second program normally outputs to stdout.\n\n  Given the instructions, I think we are allowed to only use stdout for the final output. For errors, we might not be able to mimic exactly.\n\n  Since the problem is ambiguous, and to provide a working solution for valid inputs (n>=2, so k>=1, and then 1 + 2*k >= 3, but we need 4: so k>=2), I will assume that the input to the first program is such that the first program outputs at least 4 integers.\n\n  How to ensure? For the first program, the number of operations k = (# of indices with opposite sign) + (n-1). The minimum k is n-1 (if there are no opposite signs). To have 1+2*k>=4, we need k>=2, so n-1>=2 -> n>=3.\n\n  So if the user provides n>=3, then k>=2, and the total integers = 1+2*k>=5, which is>=4.\n\n  For n=2: k = (# of opposite signs) + 1. The opposite signs: if the two elements have the same sign, then no opposite signs -> k=1. Then total integers= 1+2*1=3 -> not enough.\n           if they have opposite signs, then k = 1 (from opposite sign) + 1 (propagation) = 2. Then total integers= 1+2*2=5 -> enough.\n\n  So for n=2 with same sign, we only have 3 integers. Then we cannot.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem is not clear, I will output an error message and stop if there are fewer than 4 integers, but that is not what the original chain does. The original chain would crash. In Fortran, we can crash by trying to read beyond available data.\n\n  Alternatively, we can read the tokens and if we don't have four, we output -1 and exit (since the second program would not have enough input, we can consider it as an invalid input to the square problem, so output -1).\n\n  This is a design decision.\n\n  I choose: if the total number of integers from the first program is less than 4, then we output -1 (as the second program does for invalid input) and exit.\n\n  Because the second program is expecting four integers to form a square, and if it doesn't get four, then it's invalid.\n\n  This is not identical to the original chain (which would crash), but it is a graceful handling.\n\n  Steps in Fortran:\n\n  1. Read the initial input: integer n, and then an array a of n integers.\n\n  2. Simulate the first program:\n\n        - Find the index m (0-indexed in our code, but the program uses 1-indexed in output) of the element with the maximum absolute value.\n        - Create a list of operations (strings in the Java program, but we only need the integers for the next step, and we are going to output tokens).\n\n        We will not output strings, but collect the integers in the order they would be printed.\n\n        The output of the first program is:\n\n            First: k (the number of operations)\n            Then: for each operation, a string of the form \"i j\", meaning two integers (i and j) on the same line.\n\n        So the tokens in order: k, then for each operation: i, j.\n\n  3. Collect these tokens in an integer array (or we can store them in a list). We don't know k in advance, but we can compute k.\n\n        k = (# of indices i such that sign(a[m]) != sign(a[i])) + (n-1)\n\n        But note: the sign condition: a[m]>=0 xor a[i]>=0 -> that is, one nonnegative and the other negative. Note: zero is nonnegative.\n\n        Then we know the total number of tokens = 1 + 2 * k.\n\n  4. If the total number of tokens (1+2*k) is less than 4, then we output -1 and exit.\n\n  5. Otherwise, take the first four tokens from this list: \n          token1 = k\n          token2 = first operation's i\n          token3 = first operation's j\n          token4 = second operation's i   [if there is a second operation]\n\n        But wait, the next token after the first operation is the j, then the next operation's i and j? \n\n        The tokens are: [k, op1_i, op1_j, op2_i, op2_j, ...]\n\n        So the first four tokens are: k, op1_i, op1_j, op2_i.\n\n  6. Then, run the second program with these four tokens as x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\n        The second program does:\n\n            if x1 == x2:\n                dif = |y1 - y2|\n                then output: (x1+dif, y1, x1+dif, y2)\n            else if y1 == y2:\n                dif = |x1 - x2|\n                then output: (x1, y1+dif, x2, y2+dif)\n            else if |x1-x2| == |y1-y2|:\n                output: (x1, y2, x2, y1)\n            else:\n                output: -1\n\n  7. Print the result of the second program.\n\n  However, note: the second program in the example outputs either four integers (on one line, space separated) or -1.\n\n  So the final output is either:\n        -1\n    or\n        four integers in one line: x3 y3 x4 y4\n\n  But wait, the example second program outputs:\n\n        if (x1 == x2): \n            pw.println((x1 + dif) + \" \" + y1 + \" \" + (x1 + dif) + \" \" + y2);\n        else if (y1 == y2): \n            pw.println((x1) + \" \" + (y1 + dif) + \" \" + (x2) + \" \" + (y2 + dif));\n        else if (Math.abs(x1 - x2) == Math.abs(y1 - y2)): \n            pw.println(x1 + \" \" + y2 + \" \" + x2 + \" \" + y1);\n        else: \n            pw.println(-1);\n\n  So one line of either 1 integer or 4 integers.\n\n  Therefore, our final Fortran program will output one line: either four integers or -1.\n\n  But note: the first program might output many integers, but we only use the first four.\n\n  This is a design decision.\n\n  Summary of the Fortran program structure:\n\n  Step 1: Read n, and then n integers into array a.\n\n  Step 2: Compute the first program's output tokens:\n\n        m = 0\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            if (abs(a(i)) > abs(a(m))) then   ! note: using 0-indexed or 1-indexed? Fortran usually 1-indexed, but the Java uses 0-indexed for array.\n            We must be cautious.\n\n        Let me reindex: in the Java program, the array a is 0-indexed. In Fortran, we can use 1-indexed.\n\n        We'll store the array a(1:n) for n.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            m = 1   (index 1 initially)\n            do i = 2, n\n                if (abs(a(i)) > abs(a(m))) then\n                    m = i\n                end if\n            end do\n\n        Then, we count the operations:\n\n            k = 0\n            ! We will also record the operations: we need to store the tokens, so we can precompute the tokens.\n\n            tokens(1) = ...  but we don't know the total number of tokens until we compute k.\n\n            We can compute k first:\n\n                count_opposite = 0\n                do i = 1, n\n                    if ( (a(m) >= 0 .and. a(i) < 0) .or. (a(m)<0 .and. a(i)>=0) ) then\n                        count_opposite = count_opposite + 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n                k = count_opposite + (n-1)\n\n            Then, we can allocate an array for tokens of size (1+2*k) but we only need the first four.\n\n        However, we are only going to use the first four tokens. So we don't need to store all the tokens. We only need to compute the first four.\n\n        How to compute the first four tokens without generating all?\n\n        The tokens are:\n\n            token1 = k\n\n            Then the operations:\n\n                Operation 1: for an opposite sign element: (m, i)  -> two integers: m and i (but note: in the Java program, they are 1-indexed: m+1 and i+1 in the original array? Actually, the Java program outputs m+1 and i+1 because the array is 0-indexed in Java. In Fortran, we are using 1-indexed, so we output the indices as they are? But the Java program adds 1 to the index.)\n\n                However, in our Fortran, we are storing the array with index 1..n. So the index m we found is between 1 and n. We don't need to add 1.\n\n                But the Java program outputs: m+1 and i+1. In our Fortran, the index is already 1-indexed, so we output m and i.\n\n                Actually, no: the Java program:\n\n                    r.add(m + 1 + \" \" + (i + 1))\n\n                So if m is the index (0-indexed), then it outputs m+1 and i+1.\n\n                In Fortran, we are using 1-indexed, so the index m we found is the same as m+1 in the 0-indexed? \n\n                Example: if the array has 3 elements, then in Java the indices are 0,1,2. In Fortran, they are 1,2,3.\n\n                The value of m in Java: if the maximum is at index0, then m=0 -> output 1.\n                In Fortran, we would have m=1.\n\n                So in Fortran, we don't add 1.\n\n                Therefore, for an operation, we output the indices as they are.\n\n            Operation 1: two integers: m, i   (for the first opposite sign element we encounter? but the Java program loops in order of i from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, we do i=1 to n? and we do the same order.)\n\n            Then the propagation operations:\n\n                If a(m)>=0, then we do:\n                    for i=1 to n-1: operation (i, i+1) -> so tokens: i, i+1 for each i from 1 to n-1.\n\n                Else, we do:\n                    for i=n down to 2: operation (i, i-1) -> tokens: i, i-1.\n\n        We are only interested in the first two operations (if available) to get the first four tokens.\n\n        So we can generate the tokens until we have at least 4.\n\n        Steps for generating tokens:\n\n            token(1) = k   (the total number of operations)\n\n            Then, we need to generate:\n\n                For each index i=1..n: if the sign is opposite to a(m), then we have an operation (m, i). We traverse i from 1 to n.\n\n                Then, if a(m)>=0, we traverse i=1 to n-1: operation (i, i+1)\n                else, we traverse i=n down to 2: operation (i, i-1)\n\n            We want the first two operations (if they exist) to get tokens 2,3,4,5? Actually, the first four tokens are:\n\n                token1 = k\n                token2 = first operation's first index\n                token3 = first operation's second index\n                token4 = second operation's first index   [if exists]\n\n            So we can simulate:\n\n                token_list(1) = k\n\n                count = 1\n                need at least 4 tokens.\n\n                Step 1: for i=1 to n:\n                    if ( (a(m)>=0 .and. a(i)<0) .or. (a(m)<0 .and. a(i)>=0) ) then\n                        count = count + 1\n                        token_list(count) = m   -> this is the first integer of the operation\n                        count = count + 1\n                        token_list(count) = i   -> second integer\n                        if (count>=4) then we have at least the first four tokens? Actually, we only need four tokens in total for the next stage, so we can break early? But note, the condition: we only need the first four tokens, regardless of how many operations we generate.\n\n                Then, if we haven't reached 4 tokens, we do the propagation operations:\n\n                    if a(m)>=0:\n                        for i=1 to n-1:\n                            count = count+1\n                            token_list(count) = i\n                            count = count+1\n                            token_list(count) = i+1\n                            if (count>=4) exit the loop early? but we don't need more than 4.\n                    else:\n                        for i=n,2,-1   (from n down to 2)\n                            count = count+1\n                            token_list(count) = i\n                            count = count+1\n                            token_list(count) = i-1\n                            if (count>=4) exit\n\n                But we are only interested in the first four tokens. So we can generate until we have four tokens.\n\n        However, we only need the first four tokens for the second program. So we can generate the tokens until we have at least four, then stop.\n\n        But note: k = count_opposite + (n-1). We need k to put as the first token. Then we need three more tokens to have four.\n\n        So we generate:\n\n            token1 = k\n\n            If k>=1, then we generate the first operation: two tokens -> then we have 3 tokens total.\n            If k>=2, then we generate the second operation: two tokens -> then we have 5 tokens? but we only need the fourth token. Actually, we only need the first four tokens: positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n            How many tokens do we need? We need four. So we generate until we have four tokens.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                tokens(1) = k\n\n                if k==0, then we only have 1 token -> not enough.\n\n                else:\n                    Generate the first operation: \n                        token2 = m1   (for the first operation: the first index)\n                        token3 = i1   (the second index)\n\n                    Now we have 3 tokens.\n\n                    if k>=2, then we generate the next operation: \n                        token4 = m2   (for the second operation: the first index of the second operation)\n\n                    But wait: the second operation might be either another opposite sign operation or the first propagation operation.\n\n                    We don't care: we just generate the next operation.\n\n                    However, we must know what the next operation is. We cannot skip.\n\n            So we must generate the operations in the same order as the first program.\n\n        Therefore, we will:\n\n            tokens(1) = k\n\n            count = 1\n\n            ! First: opposite sign operations (for i=1 to n)\n            do i=1, n\n                if ( (a(m)>=0 .and. a(i)<0) .or. (a(m)<0 .and. a(i)>=0) ) then\n                    count = count+1\n                    tokens(count) = m\n                    count = count+1\n                    tokens(count) = i\n                    if (count>=4) then\n                        exit   ! but we only need four tokens, but note: we are in the middle of the operations. We don't want to break the entire program? We just break the loop? but we need to break both loops if we have enough tokens.\n                    endif\n                endif\n            enddo\n\n            if (count<4) then\n                ! Then we do the propagation operations\n                if (a(m)>=0) then\n                    do i=1, n-1\n                        count = count+1\n                        tokens(count) = i\n                        count = count+1\n                        tokens(count) = i+1\n                        if (count>=4) exit\n                    enddo\n                else\n                    do i=n,2,-1\n                        count = count+1\n                        tokens(count) = i\n                        count = count+1\n                        tokens(count) = i-1\n                        if (count>=4) exit\n                    enddo\n                endif\n            endif\n\n        But note: we might break in the middle of the propagation operations.\n\n        However, we only care about the first four tokens.\n\n  7. If count<4 (meaning we generated less than 4 tokens), then we output -1 and exit.\n\n  8. Else, we have tokens(1), tokens(2), tokens(3), tokens(4).\n\n        Set:\n            x1 = tokens(1)\n            y1 = tokens(2)\n            x2 = tokens(3)\n            y2 = tokens(4)\n\n        Then, run the second program's logic:\n\n            if (x1 == x2) then\n                dif = abs(y1 - y2)\n                write(*,*) x1+dif, y1, x1+dif, y2\n            else if (y1 == y2) then\n                dif = abs(x1 - x2)\n                write(*,*) x1, y1+dif, x2, y2+dif\n            else if (abs(x1-x2) == abs(y1-y2)) then\n                write(*,*) x1, y2, x2, y1\n            else\n                write(*,*) -1\n            endif\n\n  But wait: the second program in Java uses integers and prints integers. We do the same.\n\n  However, note: the tokens we generated are indices (from 1 to n) and k might be large. But that's okay.\n\n  But is it meaningful to form a square with these integers? Probably not, but we are mimicking the chain.\n\n  This design is arbitrary, but it follows the requirement.\n\n  Let's test with a small example for the first program:\n\n      Example: n=3, a = [3, -2, 1]   (Fortran: a(1)=3, a(2)=-2, a(3)=1)\n\n      Step1: find m: \n          abs(3)=3, abs(-2)=2, abs(1)=1 -> m=1 (since 3 is the largest)\n\n      Opposite sign: \n          a(1)=3 (>=0), so we look for negative numbers: a(2)=-2 -> opposite -> add operation (1,2)  [in Fortran indices: 1,2]\n          a(3)=1 -> nonnegative -> not opposite.\n\n      Then, since a(1)>=0, we do propagation: \n          operations: \n              for i=1 to 2: \n                  operation1: (1,2) -> add 1,2   [but note: we already did the opposite sign operations, now we do propagation]\n                  operation2: (2,3) -> add 2,3\n\n          So total operations: \n              opposite: one operation (1,2)\n              propagation: two operations (1,2) and (2,3) -> wait, no: the propagation operations are independent.\n\n      The Java program:\n\n          First loop: for i=0..n-1: if opposite sign? \n                i=0: a[0]=3 -> same as a[m] (which is a[0]) -> skip.\n                i=1: a[1]=-2 -> opposite -> add (m+1, i+1) -> (1,2)  [because m=0 -> 0+1=1, i=1 -> 1+1=2]\n                i=2: a[2]=1 -> same -> skip.\n\n          Then propagation: since a[0]>=0, we do:\n                for i=0 to n-2: \n                    operation: (i+1, i+2) -> (1,2) and (2,3)\n\n          So total operations: \n                k=3\n                operations: \n                    (1,2)   [from opposite sign]\n                    (1,2)   [from propagation: i=0: indices0->0 and 1 -> (1,2)]\n                    (2,3)   [from propagation: i=1: indices1 and 2 -> (2,3)]\n\n          So the tokens: \n                k = 3\n                op1: 1 2\n                op2: 1 2\n                op3: 2 3\n\n          The first four tokens: 3, 1, 2, 1.\n\n          Then the second program: \n                x1=3, y1=1, x2=2, y2=1.\n\n          Now, check:\n              if x1==x2? 3==2? no.\n              if y1==y2? 1==1? yes -> then we do:\n                  dif = |3-2| = 1\n                  output: x1, y1+dif, x2, y2+dif -> 3, 1+1, 2, 1+1 -> 3,2,2,2.\n\n          But is that a square? The points are (3,2) and (2,2) -> that's only two points. The second program is supposed to output the two other points? \n\n          The second program's logic: \n            Input: x1, y1, x2, y2 = 3,1,2,1 -> two points: (3,1) and (2,1). Then it assumes these are two points of a square.\n\n            Then, because y1==y2 (both 1), it outputs: \n                (x1, y1+dif) and (x2, y2+dif) -> (3,1+1) = (3,2) and (2,1+1)=(2,2).\n\n          That forms a square: (3,1), (2,1), (3,2), (2,2). So it is correct.\n\n  Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  Steps in Fortran:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer, parameter :: max_tokens_required = 4\n          integer :: n, m, i, k, count_opposite, count_tokens, total_ops\n          integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n          integer, dimension(4) :: tokens  ! we only need the first four tokens\n          integer :: x1, y1, x2, y2, dif, j\n          logical :: found_opposite\n\n          !

This might not form a square, but we are following the chain.\n\n  However, the example worked.\n\n  Let me test with n=2, a = [1, -1] (so that we get enough tokens)\n\n      n=2, a=[1, -1]\n\n      m: abs(1)=1, abs(-1)=1 -> so m=1 (the first occurrence) or m=2? the Java program: \n          for (int i=1; i<n; i++) ... \n          i=1: compare a[0] (1) and a[1] (-1): abs(1)=1, abs(-1)=1 -> not greater, so m remains 0 (if 0-indexed). In our Fortran, we start at m=1, then i=2: compare a(2) to a(1): abs(-1)=1 not greater than abs(1)=1 -> so m=1.\n\n      Opposite signs: \n          a(1)=1>=0, a(2)=-1<0 -> opposite -> count_opposite=1.\n      total_ops = 1 + (2-1)=2.\n\n      tokens(1)=2.\n\n      Then, opposite sign operations: \n          i=1: skip? \n          i=2: opposite -> \n              tokens(2)=m=1\n              tokens(3)=i=2 -> count_tokens=3 -> not 4, so we continue to propagation.\n\n      Since a(1)=1>=0, we do propagation: \n          i=1: operation (1,2)\n              tokens(4)=1\n              count_tokens=4 -> we stop.\n\n      Then tokens: [2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n      Then the second program: \n          x1=2, y1=1, x2=2, y2=1 -> but wait, the tokens(4)=1, so x2=2? and y2=1? \n          Actually, our tokens: \n            tokens(1)=2 -> x1\n            tokens(2)=1 -> y1\n            tokens(3)=2 -> x2\n            tokens(4)=1 -> y2\n\n          Then: \n            x1==x2? 2==2 -> yes.\n            dif = |1-1|=0\n            then output: x1+dif=2, y1=1, x1+dif=2, y2=1 -> 2 1 2 1.\n\n          But that's the same point twice? \n\n      However, the second program: \n          Input: two points (2,1) and (2,1) -> same point.\n          Then it assumes they are two points of a square? \n          It would output: (2+0,1) and (2+0,1) -> the same two points.\n\n      But a square needs two distinct points? \n\n      The second program's condition: \n          if (x1 == x2) then ... \n          Here, they are the same, so it uses the difference in y (which is 0) and then outputs (x1+0, y1) and (x1+0, y2) -> which are (2,1) and (2,1). \n\n      This is a degenerate square? \n\n      But the problem says: the second program outputs the other two points? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"It then determines the other two points to form a square, or outputs -1 if not possible.\"\n\n      Here, the two points are the same. Then the square is not defined? But the program doesn't check that the two points are distinct.\n\n      In the original second program, it does not check if the two points are distinct. So it will output as above.\n\n      Therefore, we are consistent.\n\n  Finally, test n=1: \n        a = [5]\n\n        m=1\n        count_opposite: none -> 0\n        total_ops=0+0=0   (n-1=0)\n        tokens(1)=0\n        then we try to fill: count_tokens=1 -> not 4 -> output -1.\n\n  But the original chain: the first program outputs 0, then the second program would try to read four integers and crash. We output -1. This is not identical, but we decided to output -1 for lack of tokens.\n\n  We are not able to mimic the crash, so we output -1.\n\n  This is the best we can do.\n\n  Write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n  Note: We are using fixed array for tokens of size 4.\n\n  Let's code accordingly."
