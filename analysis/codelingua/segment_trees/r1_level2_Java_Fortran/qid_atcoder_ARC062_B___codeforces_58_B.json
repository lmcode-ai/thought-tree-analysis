Let's test with the example: \n      First program: Input: \"gpg\" -> \n          i=0 (even) -> my='g', his='g' -> no change. i=1 (odd) -> my='p', his='p' -> no change. i=2 (even) -> my='g', his='g' -> no change? -> score=0. Then n=0: output \"0 \" and then the loop does nothing. But wait: what if we input \"g\"?\n          i=0: my='g', his='g' -> no change -> score=0. What if we input \"p\"?\n          i=0: my='g', his='p' -> my ! = his -> and my='g' -> so score = -1. Then the second part: n=-1 -> output \"-1 \" and then the loop: i from -2 down to 1? -> no iteration. This is correct. However, the problem says the entire sequence.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence. The first program (atcoder_ARC062_B) reads a string and computes a score. The second program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer and then prints a sequence of integers.\n\nHowever, note the requirement: the entire sequence should be translated into a single Fortran program. The first block (which is the first Java program) should read the input, and the last block (the second Java program) should produce the output. But note that the output of the first program is an integer (the score) and the second program expects an integer (n) from the input. So the integer output from the first program becomes the input to the second program.\n\nBut wait: the first program reads a string and the second reads an integer. How do we chain them?\n\nThe input to the entire sequence is the string for the first program. The first program computes an integer (score). Then the second program uses that integer as its input (n). The output of the second program is the sequence of numbers.\n\nHowever, note that the second program does not read from the standard input until the first program has finished. Therefore, in the combined Fortran program:\n\n1. We read the string (from standard input) for the first part.\n2. Compute the score (without any I/O in between).\n3. Then use that computed score as the integer 'n' for the second part.\n4. The second part then produces the output (which is a sequence of integers) to standard output.\n\nBut note: the second program prints the integer n and then, in decreasing order from n-1 down to 1, prints every divisor of the current m (which starts as n) that is also a divisor of the next m (which is set to the divisor just found).\n\nSo the plan for the Fortran program:\n\n- Read the input string (only the first token? but the Java program uses next() which is one token. However, the problem says the input is a string of 'g' and 'p'. We can assume one line?).\n\n  Actually, the InputReader in the first Java program reads tokens. The input is a single string. So we can read the entire first line as a string.\n\n- Compute the score as in the first Java program.\n\n- Then, using that score as the integer n, run the logic of the second program.\n\nBut note: the second program originally reads from standard input. Instead, we are going to set n = score.\n\nImportant: The second program prints:\n  System.out.println(n + \" \");\n  then for i from n-1 down to 1:\n      if m (initially n) is divisible by i, then print i and set m = i.\n\nHowever, note that the first program prints the score and then the second program reads that as its input. So in the combined program, we skip printing the score and just pass it as n to the second part.\n\nTherefore, the combined Fortran program:\n\n  Step 1: Read a string (the entire line? but the first Java program reads tokens. However, the example input is a string without spaces. Let's read the entire line to be safe? But the problem says the same behavior. The first program reads one token. So we read one token (a string without spaces).\n\n  Step 2: Compute the score from that string.\n\n  Step 3: Set n = score.\n\n  Step 4: Then run the second program's logic with that n.\n\nBut note: what if the score is negative? The second program expects a positive integer? The original second program reads an integer and then runs a loop from n-1 down to 1. If n is negative, then the loop would run from n-1 (which is negative) down to 1? That doesn't make sense. However, let's look at the first program: the score is computed by:\n\n  For each character in the string:\n      if the index is even (0-indexed) then my = 'g', else 'p'\n      if my is 'g' and his is 'p', then we do -1 (because we are g and we lost: we played paper when we should have played rock? Actually, the problem is about a rock-paper-scissors variant? But the note: the score can be negative? \n\n  However, the second program expects a positive integer? Actually, the second program does:\n\n      for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)\n\n  If n is negative, then the loop condition (i>0) is immediately false. So it would only print n and then nothing.\n\n  But the problem says: the entire sequence. So we must mimic the behavior of the two programs. If the first program outputs a negative integer, then the second program would read that negative integer and then the loop doesn't run. So the output would be the negative integer and that's it.\n\n  However, the second program uses:\n\n      System.out.println(n + \" \");\n\n  So it prints n and a space, then in the loop it prints i and a space.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n      - Read the string (one token, without spaces) from standard input.\n      - Compute the score (an integer).\n      - Then set n = score.\n      - Print n and a space (or in Fortran, we can use advance='no' to avoid newline? but note: the second program uses println for the first one -> so it prints a newline? Actually, no: println in Java prints the string and then a newline. But wait, the second program:\n\n          System.out.println(n + \" \");\n\n      This prints n, then a space, then a newline? Actually, no: the expression n + \" \" is a string. For example, if n=5, then it prints \"5 \\n\" (with a space and then a newline). But wait: the expression is n + \" \" -> so it becomes a string that is the string representation of n and then a space. Then println adds a newline.\n\n      However, looking at the example: \n          Input to second program: 5\n          Output: \n              5 \n              4 \n              2 \n              1 \n\n      Actually, no: because the second program does:\n\n          System.out.println(n + \" \");   -> prints \"5 \" and then a newline.\n          Then in the loop, when it finds a divisor, it does: System.out.println(i + \" \"); -> which prints \"4 \" and newline, then \"2 \" and newline, then \"1 \" and newline.\n\n      But wait, the example output in the problem? The problem doesn't specify the exact output. However, the second program prints each number on a new line? Actually, no: because it uses println. So each number (with a space) is printed on its own line.\n\n      However, the example in the problem statement of the second program? The problem doesn't give an example. But we can assume that the output of the second program is:\n\n          n (with a space and then a newline)\n          then each divisor found (with a space and then a newline)\n\n      Therefore, the Fortran program must output:\n\n          write(*, *) n   ! This will print n and then a newline? But note: in Fortran, the default behavior of print * is to print a space-separated list and then a newline.\n\n      However, the Java program prints a space after the number and then a newline. In Fortran, if we do:\n\n          print *, n\n\n      It will output the integer with a space at the beginning? Actually, no: for an integer, it prints without leading space? But then a trailing space? Actually, the standard formatting for list-directed output (print *) is not specified exactly, but typically it prints the number and then a space and then the next item? But we are printing one item per line.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          write(*,'(I0, A)') n, ' '   -> but then we don't get the newline? And then we have to do the same for each.\n\n      But note: the second program prints each number and then a space and then a newline. So we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n          then for each divisor we do: write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n\n      However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The output should be the same. The Java program outputs:\n\n          \"5 \\n4 \\n2 \\n1 \\n\"\n\n      We can output:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n          then for each divisor: write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n\n      But note: each write statement in Fortran (with format) by default adds a newline at the end? Actually, no: the format doesn't include a newline. We have to add it.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          print *, n, ' '   -> This will print two items: n and a space? and then a newline. But that would be: [space][n][space][space]? Actually, no: the list-directed output for two items would be: n, then a space, then a space? and then newline. That is: \"n  \\n\".\n\n      But the Java program outputs: the string of n (without leading spaces) and then a space and then a newline. So we want: trim the number and then a space and then newline.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n\n\n      This will write the integer without leading spaces, then a space, and then no newline? Actually, the format doesn't specify a newline. We have to add a newline.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \", /)') n   -> but / is a new page? Actually, for standard output, we can use:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")', advance='no')   -> but then we have to print a newline separately? \n\n      Actually, the requirement is to have the same output. The Java program prints the number, then a space, then a newline. So we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n   -> but this doesn't add a newline? Actually, by default, a write statement without advance='no' will add a newline at the end.\n\n      However, the format string only specifies the two characters: the number and a space. Then the write statement automatically adds a newline? Actually, no: the format only controls the data. The write statement will output exactly what the format specifies. And after that, it does not add anything. So we must include the newline in the format.\n\n      Therefore:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \", /)') n   -> This would output the integer, then a space, then a newline? Actually, the / in the format causes a newline.\n\n      But note: the format for the divisor prints should be the same.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          write(*, *) n   ! This prints n and then a newline, but without the trailing space? Actually, it prints with a trailing space? \n\n      Let me check: in Fortran, print * for an integer n=5 would output \"          5\" (with leading spaces) and then a newline? But we don't want leading spaces. We want the same as the Java: no leading spaces, then a space, then newline.\n\n      We can use:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n          write(*, *)   ! to get a newline? but that would be two lines.\n\n      Actually, we want the entire output per number to be: number, space, newline.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n   -> This does not include a newline? Then we have to add a newline. But we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")', advance='no')\n          write(*, *)   ! This would output a newline? But then we break the output into two writes.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \", /)') n   -> but the / is a newline? Actually, in Fortran, the / in a format causes a newline. But note: the entire format is processed until the end. So:\n\n          format = '(I0, \" \", /)'   -> This would output the integer, then a space, then a newline.\n\n      However, we can also do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n\n          write(*, *)   ! This would output a space and then a newline? Actually, no: the first write outputs the integer and a space and then stops without a newline? Actually, no: by default, a write statement without advance='no' will finish the record (which is equivalent to a newline). So the first write outputs the integer and the space and then a newline? \n\n      Actually, no: the format does not include a newline, so the write statement will output the integer and the space and then automatically end the record (which is a newline). So we don't need the /.\n\n      Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n   -> This will output the integer without leading spaces, then a space, and then a newline.\n\n      But wait: what if we have multiple items? The format '(I0, \" \")' will output the integer and then a space. Then the record ends, so a newline is added. So that matches.\n\n      However, the second program uses:\n\n          System.out.println(n + \" \"); \n\n      This is equivalent to:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n\n\n      Then for each divisor:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') i\n\n      So we can use the same for each.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Program Combined\n          character(100) :: S   ! We assume the string is up to 100 characters? but we can make it larger.\n          integer :: score, i, n, m, length\n          character :: my, his\n\n          ! Read the input string (the entire token, one line without spaces? but the Java program reads tokens. We assume the input string is one token without spaces.\n          read(*, *) S   ! This reads the first token. But note: the string might be long? We can read as a character variable.\n\n          ! We need the actual length of the string? But the Java program uses S.length(). We can use trim(S) to remove trailing spaces? But the input may have leading spaces? Actually, the Java program reads tokens. So the token has no leading/trailing spaces. So we can use the length of the trimmed string? But note: the token might be the entire line? Actually, the InputReader in Java reads the next token. So we read one token.\n\n          ! How to get the length? We can use len_trim(S) to get the length without trailing spaces. But note: the token might have trailing spaces? Actually, no: because read(*,*) reads without trailing spaces.\n\n          ! However, the string S may have trailing spaces if the variable is longer than the token. So we use:\n\n          length = len_trim(S)\n\n          score = 0\n          do i = 1, length\n              if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then   ! because in Java: index 0 is even -> i=1 in Fortran is the first character -> index0=0\n                  my = 'g'\n              else\n                  my = 'p'\n              end if\n\n              his = S(i:i)\n\n              if (my /= his) then\n                  if (my == 'p') then\n                      score = score + 1\n                  else\n                      score = score - 1\n                  end if\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Now set n = score\n          n = score\n\n          ! Now the second part: output n and then the divisors sequence.\n          ! We output n as described: write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n   -> but note: this writes n, a space, and then a newline? Actually, no: the record ends so a newline is added. But we want exactly: n and a space and then a newline? Yes, that's what we have.\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n\n\n          m = n\n          ! Now loop from i = n-1 down to 1\n          do i = n-1, 1, -1\n              if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                  write(*, '(I0, \" \")') i\n                  m = i\n              end if\n          end do\n\n      End Program\n\n  But note: what if n <= 0? Then the loop from n-1 to 1 would be:\n\n      If n=0: then the loop is from -1 to 1 -> but step -1 -> no iteration? because from -1 to 1 with step -1 is an empty loop? Actually, in Fortran, if the start is greater than the end when step is negative, then the loop is not entered.\n\n      Similarly, if n=1: then i goes from 0 to 1 -> but step -1: then it would be 0, then -1 ... but the condition is i>0? Actually, the second program's loop condition is i>0? In Fortran, we are going down to 1, so the loop runs for i from n-1 down to 1. If n=1, then n-1=0 -> loop from 0 to 1 with step -1 -> no iteration? Actually, the loop parameters: do i=0, 1, -1 -> that would be an empty loop because the starting value (0) is less than the end value (1) and the step is negative -> no iteration.\n\n  Therefore, the above loop is safe.\n\n  However, note: the second program writes each divisor on a separate line? Yes, because each write statement for i outputs a new record (a newline). So we are good.\n\n  But wait: what if the score is negative? Then the second part's loop: do i = n-1 (negative) down to 1? That would be a loop that starts at a negative number and goes down to 1? For example, if n=-5, then i goes from -6 to 1? Then we skip the loop? Actually, the loop parameters: \n        do i = n-1, 1, -1\n      If n-1 is less than 1, and the step is negative, then the loop is not executed? Actually, in Fortran, the loop runs only if the initial value is >= the final value when the step is positive, and <= when the step is negative? Actually, no: the loop condition is:\n\n        The loop variable starts at the initial value, and then at each step is decremented by the step (if negative) until it is less than the final value? \n\n      Actually, the Fortran standard says: the loop is executed zero times if the initial value is less than the final value and the step is negative? \n\n      Therefore, if n is negative, then n-1 < 1 and step is negative -> no iteration.\n\n  So the program is safe.\n\n  However, we must consider the case when n is 1: the loop is not executed, so we only output:\n\n        \"1 \"\n\n      and then nothing else.\n\n  This matches the second program.\n\n  But note: the second program in Java does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n      So we are mimicking that.\n\n  One more thing: what if the first program's output is zero? Then n=0. Then the loop: i from -1 down to 1 -> no iteration. So output is \"0 \" and then nothing.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran code:\n\n      We assume the string is read as a token (without spaces). We use read(*,*) S.\n\n  However, what if the string has spaces? The first Java program uses next() which reads one token. So we must read one token. In Fortran, read(*,*) S will read one token (without spaces) and assign it to S, and then we use len_trim(S) to get the length.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We'll write the entire Fortran program.\n\n  Note: We must declare the variables.\n\n  We assume the string can be up to 10000 characters? But the problem doesn't specify. We can set a large maximum.\n\n  Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then use the first token? But the problem says the input is a string of 'g' and 'p'. And the Java program reads one token.\n\n  We'll set:\n\n      character(10000) :: S   ! to be safe.\n\n  Code:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          character(10000) :: S\n          integer :: score, i, n, m, length\n          character :: my, his\n\n          ! Read the input string (one token)\n          read(*, *) S\n\n          ! Get the length of the token (without trailing spaces)\n          length = len_trim(S)\n\n          score = 0\n          do i = 1, length\n              if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n                  my = 'g'\n              else\n                  my = 'p'\n              end if\n\n              his = S(i:i)\n\n              if (my /= his) then\n                  if (my == 'p') then\n                      score = score + 1\n                  else\n                      score = score - 1\n                  end if\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          n = score\n\n          ! Now output n and then the divisors sequence\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') n\n\n          m = n\n          ! If n <= 1, the loop runs from n-1 down to 1: which may be negative, so we skip.\n          do i = n-1, 1, -1\n              if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n                  write(*, '(I0, \" \")') i\n                  m = i\n              end if\n          end do\n\n      end program combined\n\n  However, note: the second program in Java uses integer division? mod(m, i) is the modulus. In Fortran, mod(m, i) is the same.\n\n  But what if i is 0? In the loop, i starts at n-1 and goes down to 1, so i>=1 -> no division by zero.\n\n  Therefore, we are done.\n\n  But note: the second program in Java does:\n\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\n      which is a newline after each divisor. Our Fortran write statement:\n\n          write(*, '(I0, \" \")') i\n\n      also writes a newline? Because each write statement (without advance='no') writes a newline at the end? Yes.\n\n  So the output format is:\n\n        [n] [space] [newline]\n        [i1] [space] [newline]\n        [i2] [space] [newline]\n        ...\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Let's test with the example: \n      First program: \n          Input: \"gpg\" -> \n          i=0 (even) -> my='g', his='g' -> no change.\n          i=1 (odd) -> my='p', his='p' -> no change.\n          i=2 (even) -> my='g', his='g' -> no change? -> score=0.\n\n      Then n=0: output \"0 \" and then the loop does nothing.\n\n      But wait: what if we input \"g\"?\n          i=0: my='g', his='g' -> no change -> score=0.\n\n      What if we input \"p\"?\n          i=0: my='g', his='p' -> my != his -> and my='g' -> so score = -1.\n\n      Then the second part: n=-1 -> output \"-1 \" and then the loop: i from -2 down to 1? -> no iteration.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, the problem says the entire sequence. We have to make sure that the output of the first program (which is an integer) becomes the input of the second program. And we are doing that by setting n=score.\n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program is as above."
