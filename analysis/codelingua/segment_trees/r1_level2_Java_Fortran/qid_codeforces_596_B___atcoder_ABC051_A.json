To avoid any extra space, we use the formatted output `'(I0)'`. Therefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: total\n\n    !

Compute total = |arr(1)| + sum_{i=2 to n} |arr(i) - arr(i-1)|\n    total = abs(arr(1)) do i = 2, n\n        total = total + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)) end do\n\n    ! Output the total without any extra spaces and with a newline. write(*,'(I0)') total\nend program combined\n```\n\nThis should match the behavior of the chain.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (codeforces_596_B):\n  - Reads an integer `n`\n  - Reads an array `arr` of `n` long integers\n  - Computes:\n        answer = |arr[0]| + sum_{i=1 to n-1} |arr[i] - arr[i-1]|\n  - Prints the answer\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC051_A):\n  - Reads a string\n  - Replaces every comma (',') in the string by a space (' ')\n  - Prints the modified string\n\nHowever, note the sequence: the output of the first program is a single number (the answer) and that becomes the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string that may contain commas.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs a single number (without any commas) and then the second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. Since the output of the first program is a number (without commas), the second program would read that number as a string and then replace commas (if any) by spaces. Since there are no commas, it would output the same number.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the second program is designed to process a string with commas. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the two programs are independent and meant to be run on different inputs? However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo the output of the first program (a number) becomes the input to the second program. The second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. Since the input string (which is the number) has no commas, it just prints the same number.\n\nBut then the entire chain would output the same number as the first program? That seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, let's reconsider: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". The example provides two programs. The first program reads an array and computes a value. The second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces.\n\nIf we run the first program on its intended input (say, an array of integers), it produces a number. Then we feed that number as a string to the second program, which would output the same number (because there are no commas). So the final output is the same number.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs the number as a string (via `System.out.println(answer)`). Then the second program reads that string. So the entire chain is:\n\n  Input to chain: \n      First, the integer `n` and then `n` integers (for the first program)\n  Output of chain: \n      The same number that the first program computed, but then passed through the second program (which does nothing because there are no commas).\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\".\n\nWe are to write a single Fortran program that does:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (i.e., an integer `n` and then `n` integers).\n  Step 2: Compute the value as in the first program: \n          total = |arr(1)| + sum_{i=2 to n} |arr(i) - arr(i-1)|\n  Step 3: Then, without any intermediate I/O, we have to process that total as the second program would: \n          The second program reads a string and replaces commas by spaces. But note that the total is an integer (or long) and we are going to output it as a string? But in the second program, it simply replaces commas. Since the string representation of the total has no commas, we can just output the total.\n\nBut wait: the second program doesn't do any conversion? It just replaces commas. So if we have the total as a number, we can convert it to a string and then output that string without any changes? \n\nAlternatively, note that the second program in the chain would read the output of the first program. The first program outputs the number in decimal without commas. So the second program would read a string of digits and then output the same string of digits.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is equivalent to the first program? \n\nBut what if the first program's output had commas? Then the second program would remove them. However, the first program outputs without commas. \n\nSo the Fortran program should:\n\n  - Read the input for the first program (n and the array)\n  - Compute the total\n  - Then, without doing any I/O in the middle, output the total (without any commas) as the final output.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain would output the same as the first? So we can simply output the total.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and the array (this is the only input reading).\n  Step 2: Compute the total as described.\n  Step 3: Output the total (this is the only output).\n\nBut wait: what if the second program did more? Actually, the second program is designed to replace commas in a string. Since the total is a number without commas, we don't have to worry.\n\nHowever, what if the first program's output had commas? In Java, `System.out.println` for a long integer does not include commas. So the output is just digits. Therefore, the second program leaves it unchanged.\n\nSo the Fortran program can be:\n\n  Read n, then an array of n integers.\n  Compute the result as the first program does.\n  Print the result.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". We are not doing any I/O in the middle. We compute the result and then at the end we print it.\n\nBut what about the second program's operation? It replaces commas. Since there are no commas in the result, we don't need to do anything. So we skip the second program's operation? \n\nHowever, the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is to output the total without commas. So we are doing the same.\n\nBut what if the second program had a more complex operation? We would have to simulate it. In this case, the operation is trivial because there are no commas.\n\nBut to be safe, we should note: the second program reads a string and replaces every comma by a space. The output of the first program is a string of digits (and possibly a minus sign? But note the first program uses absolute values and adds nonnegative numbers, so the total is nonnegative? Actually, the array elements are read as integers but stored in `long[]`. The computation uses absolute values. So the total is nonnegative? Actually, the array elements could be negative? But the absolute values are taken. So the total is nonnegative. Therefore, the string representation of the total is a nonnegative integer without commas.\n\nSo we don't have to do any replacement.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  Read n\n  Allocate an array of n integers (or long integers? The Java uses long, so we use integer(kind=8) or integer*8? But the problem says the array elements are integers, but stored in long. The absolute value and differences might be large? So we use integer(kind=8) to be safe.\n\n  Read the array\n  Compute:\n      total = abs(arr(1))\n      do i = 2, n\n          total = total + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n      end do\n\n  Then print total\n\nBut note: the first program uses `Math.abs` which for long is the absolute value. We can use `abs` in Fortran for integer(kind=8).\n\nHowever, the problem says the entire sequence. We are effectively skipping the second program because it doesn't change the output? But what if the second program did something else? We must simulate it.\n\nBut the second program: \n   Input: a string (which is the output of the first program, a string of digits without commas)\n   Operation: replace every comma by a space. Since there are no commas, the output is the same.\n\nSo we can just output the total.\n\nBut to strictly follow the chain, we could:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and the array -> compute total (as an integer)\n   Step 2: Convert the total to a string and then replace any commas in that string by spaces? But note: in Fortran, when we write an integer, it does not include commas. So the string representation of the integer does not have commas.\n\nTherefore, we can just write the integer.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and we are not doing any.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n  We'll use integer(kind=8) for the array and total to match the long in Java.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer(kind=8) :: n, i\n          integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n          integer(kind=8) :: total\n\n          ! Read n\n          read(*,*) n\n          allocate(arr(n))\n          ! Read the array\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) arr(i)\n          end do\n\n          ! Compute the total\n          total = abs(arr(1))\n          do i = 2, n\n              total = total + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n          end do\n\n          ! Output the total (as the last block)\n          write(*,*) total\n\n      end program\n\nBut note: the Java first program uses 0-indexed array. Our Fortran array is 1-indexed. So we use arr(1) to arr(n). The computation:\n\n      total = |arr[0]|   -> in Fortran: abs(arr(1))\n      then for i from 1 to n-1: |arr[i] - arr[i-1]| -> in Fortran: for i=2 to n: abs(arr(i)-arr(i-1))\n\nSo it matches.\n\nHowever, the output of the Fortran program: when we write an integer with `write(*,*) total`, it will output the number without any formatting? But note: the second program in the chain outputs the same string. In Fortran, the default integer output does not include commas. So it's safe.\n\nBut the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The original chain outputs the number without commas and without any extra spaces? The Fortran `write(*,*)` adds a space at the beginning? Actually, it depends on the compiler, but typically for positive integers, it outputs without any leading space? However, we can use a formatted write to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      write(*,'(I0)') total\n\nThis writes the integer without any leading or trailing spaces. This matches the Java `System.out.println(total)` which just prints the number and then a newline.\n\nBut note: the second program in Java uses `System.out.println(sb)` which prints the string and then a newline. So we want to output the number and a newline.\n\nThe `write(*,'(I0)')` does not add a newline? Actually, list-directed output `write(*,*)` adds a newline. But if we use formatted I/O, we have to add the newline.\n\nWe can do:\n\n      write(*,*) total   ! This will output the number and a newline.\n\nBut the exact format? The original chain: the first program outputs the number and then a newline. Then the second program outputs the same number (without commas) and then a newline? Actually, the second program outputs the string and then a newline (because `System.out.println` adds a newline). So the chain outputs two newlines? \n\nWait, let's see:\n\n  First program: System.out.println(answer); -> outputs the number and then a newline.\n  Second program: System.out.println(sb); -> outputs the string (which is the same as the number) and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain outputs:\n\n      <number>\\n\\n\n\nBut that's two newlines? However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". But the original chain would output two newlines? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the input for the second program. The second program reads a line (using `readLine`). So it reads the entire line (which is the number and the newline from the first program). Then it replaces commas in that line and outputs the line (without the newline? no, because `readLine` does not include the newline) and then `println` adds a newline.\n\nActually, `BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(...); String a = br.readLine();` reads a line without the trailing newline. Then it replaces commas in that string and then appends the modified string to the StringBuilder. Then it prints the StringBuilder and then a newline.\n\nSo the second program outputs the same number (without the original newline) and then adds one newline.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain outputs:\n\n      <number>\\n\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs the number and then a newline. The second program reads the entire line (including the newline? Actually, `readLine` discards the newline). So the second program gets the string without the newline. Then it replaces commas and then prints that string and then a newline.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n      <number>\\n\n\nWhich is the same as if we just printed the number and a newline once.\n\nTherefore, we can just output the number and a newline in Fortran.\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n      program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer(kind=8) :: n, i\n          integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n          integer(kind=8) :: total\n\n          read(*,*) n\n          allocate(arr(n))\n          do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) arr(i)\n          end do\n\n          total = abs(arr(1))\n          do i = 2, n\n              total = total + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n          end do\n\n          ! Output the total without any extra spaces and with a newline.\n          write(*,'(I0)') total\n      end program\n\nBut note: the `'(I0)'` format writes the integer without any leading spaces and without a newline? Then we have to add a newline.\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n          write(*,*) total   ! This will write the number and then a newline.\n\nBut the list-directed write might add a space at the beginning for positive numbers? For nonnegative, it doesn't? Actually, it might. To be safe and match exactly the string of digits, we can use:\n\n          write(*,'(I0)') total   ! This writes the minimal width, no leading spaces, and no trailing newline? \n          ! But we need a newline.\n\nSo:\n\n          write(*,'(I0)') total   ! Writes the integer without leading spaces and without a newline? \n          ! Actually, the format '(I0)' does not include a newline. We have to add it.\n\nWe can do:\n\n          write(*,'(I0)') total   ! This writes the integer without any leading/trailing spaces, but without a newline.\n          ! Then we need to write a newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(I0)') total   ! This writes the integer, and then the record ends? Actually, in Fortran, each write statement by default ends with a newline? \n\nWait, no: in formatted output, the write statement writes a record. The record is terminated by a newline. So we don't have to do anything else? \n\nBut the format `'(I0)'` does not include a newline. However, when you write to the console, the record is completed by a newline. So the entire output of `write(*,'(I0)') total` is the integer and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, we can use that.\n\nBut to be safe, let's test: \n\n      write(*,'(I0)') 12345\n\nThis should output: \"12345\" and then a newline.\n\nSo it's the same as the chain.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n      write(*,*) total\n\nBut this might output a space at the beginning? For positive integers, the list-directed output does not put a space? Actually, it might. The standard says: \"The output form consists of a string of digits equal in length to the magnitude of w, possibly preceded by a minus sign and possibly followed by a decimal exponent.\" and then the next item would be separated by a space? But we have only one item. And for positive integers, there is no sign. However, the standard does not specify leading spaces. Some compilers might output a space at the beginning? \n\nTo avoid any extra space, we use the formatted output `'(I0)'`.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: total\n\n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n))\n    ! Read the array\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) arr(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute total = |arr(1)| + sum_{i=2 to n} |arr(i) - arr(i-1)|\n    total = abs(arr(1))\n    do i = 2, n\n        total = total + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the total without any extra spaces and with a newline.\n    write(*,'(I0)') total\nend program combined\n```\n\nThis should match the behavior of the chain."
