However, the original first program does:\n\n        HashMap< Integer, String> past = new HashMap<>();\n        ... and then for each word:\n            if (past.containsValue(map.get(i))) -> break\n\n        But note: the HashMap in Java is by index? Actually, it's storing the word at index i. And then it checks if the current word is already in the past words? Yes. We are doing a nested loop that checks for duplicates in the entire array? Actually, we break at the first duplicate we find (when j < i and words(j)==words(i)). This is equivalent. Also, the chain condition: we break at the first broken link.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The first Java program (atcoder_ABC109_B) does:\n   - Reads an integer N, then N strings.\n   - Checks two conditions:\n        1. All strings are distinct.\n        2. For each string (from the second onward), the first character must match the last character of the previous string.\n   - Outputs \"Yes\" if both conditions hold, otherwise \"No\".\n\n The second Java program (codeforces_49_A) does:\n   - Reads a whole line of input.\n   - Finds the last non-space and non-question-mark character in the string.\n   - Converts that character to lowercase and checks if it is a vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y').\n   - Outputs \"YES\" if it is a vowel, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note that the instructions say:\n   - The entire sequence of Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of the first being the input to the second.\n\n But wait: The first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program expects a string (a whole line) as input.\n\n However, the second program expects a string that might have spaces and a question mark? Actually, the second program is designed to read a question (like in codeforces problem) and check the last letter.\n\n But the output of the first program is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are single words without spaces or question marks.\n\n How does the chain work?\n   Input for the entire system: \n      For the first program: \n          First integer N, then N strings.\n      Then the first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n      That output becomes the input to the second program.\n\n   The second program then reads that string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and checks the last non-space, non-question-mark character? \n      In the string \"Yes\", the last non-space character is 's'. Similarly, for \"No\", it is 'o'.\n\n   Then the second program checks if that character (converted to lowercase) is a vowel? \n        's' -> not a vowel -> output \"NO\"\n        'o' -> vowel -> output \"YES\"\n\n But this does not match the original intention of the separate programs. \n\n However, the problem states: \n      \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \n      \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n So the chain is:\n\n   Input to the entire system: the input that the first program expects (i.e., an integer N and then N strings).\n\n   Then the first program runs and produces a string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") which is passed as input to the second program.\n\n   The second program then processes that string and outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n Therefore, the overall output of the chain is the output of the second program.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer N, then N strings).\n\n   Step 2: Process the first program (check the conditions) and form the string \"Yes\" or \"No\". But note: we are not to output it, but pass to the next.\n\n   Step 3: Use that string as the input to the second program.\n\n   Step 4: In the second program, we take that string (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and:\n        - Find the last non-space and non-question-mark character. Since the string has no spaces or question marks, we take the last character.\n        - Convert it to lowercase.\n        - Check if it is one of the vowels.\n\n   Step 5: Output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\n But note: the second program in the original code reads a whole line. The output of the first program is a single line: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n However, the second program in the original code also handles strings that might have trailing spaces and question marks? But in our case, the input string is just \"Yes\" or \"No\". So:\n\n        For \"Yes\": \n            The last non-space, non-question-mark character is 's'. \n            Lowercase 's' -> not a vowel -> output \"NO\"\n\n        For \"No\":\n            The last non-space, non-question-mark character is 'o'.\n            Lowercase 'o' -> vowel -> output \"YES\"\n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs \"Yes\" (with a capital Y) and then we convert to lowercase? The second program does:\n\n        ch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);   -> so 's' becomes 's', which is not a vowel.\n\n So the chain would output:\n\n        If the first condition holds (so first program outputs \"Yes\") then the second program outputs \"NO\".\n\n        If the first condition fails (so first program outputs \"No\") then the second program outputs \"YES\".\n\n This is the behavior we must replicate.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the order of the two programs? But the description says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". The order is given: first atcoder_ABC109_B, then codeforces_49_A.\n\n But let's reconsider: the problem says the output of the first is the input of the next. So the first program's output is the second program's input.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We have to do:\n\n        Step 1: Read an integer N, then N strings.\n\n        Step 2: Check the conditions of the first program without any I/O in the middle.\n\n        Step 3: Form a string variable that is either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (we'll call it `result1`).\n\n        Step 4: Then process `result1` as the input to the second part.\n\n                - Find the last non-space and non-question-mark character? Actually, we can note that `result1` has no spaces or question marks. So we can simply take the last character.\n\n                - But the second program does: \n                      for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n                          if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n                              ch = s.charAt(i);\n                              break;\n                          }\n                      }\n\n                Since our string has no spaces or '?', we can just take the last character.\n\n                However, to be safe, we traverse from the end until we find a non-space, non-question-mark. But note: our string is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are 3 and 2 characters respectively and without spaces. So the last character is the last non-space.\n\n        Step 5: Convert that character to lowercase.\n\n        Step 6: Check if it is a vowel.\n\n        Step 7: Output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the second program outputs in uppercase.\n\n Let's design:\n\n   We need to read the integer N and then N words. We don't know the length of each word. In Fortran, we have to set a maximum length.\n\n   We assume the words (and the strings) are not longer than 100 characters? We'll set a constant for the string length.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        integer :: n, i\n        character(len=100), dimension(100) :: words  ! We assume at most 100 words, and each word at most 100 characters.\n        logical :: condition1, condition2\n        logical :: all_ok\n        character(len=3) :: result1   ! because \"Yes\" is 3, \"No\" is 2, but we can use a variable length? We'll use a string of length 100 and then adjust.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            character(len=100) :: temp_str, last_char_str, result1\n\n        But for the words, we need to store N words.\n\n        We'll read n, then read n words.\n\n        Then we check:\n\n          condition1: all words are distinct? We can use a nested loop? Or we can use an array and compare.\n\n          condition2: for i from 2 to n, the last character of word(i-1) must equal the first character of word(i).\n\n        If both conditions hold, set result1 = \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        Then, for the second part, we take the string result1 and:\n\n          Let s = result1\n          Let ch = the last non-space, non-question-mark character in s (which we know is the last character because there are no spaces, but we traverse backwards to be safe).\n\n          Convert ch to lowercase.\n\n          Check if ch is one of 'a','e','i','o','u','y'\n\n          Then output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Read n\n\n        Step 2: Read n words. We'll use an array of strings.\n\n        Step 3: Check for duplicates: for each word, check if it appears again later? But note: the first program uses a HashMap and breaks at the first duplicate.\n\n        Step 4: Check the chain condition: for i from 2 to n, the last character of the (i-1)-th word must equal the first character of the i-th word.\n\n        Step 5: Set a flag `all_ok` to .true. initially.\n\n                For i=1 to n:\n                  Check if the current word has appeared in the previous words? We can do:\n\n                    do j = 1, i-1\n                      if (words(j) == words(i)) then\n                         all_ok = .false.\n                         exit\n                      end if\n                    end do\n\n                Then, if we are still ok, check the chain for i=2 to n:\n\n                    do i = 2, n\n                      if ( words(i-1)(len_trim(words(i-1)):len_trim(words(i-1)) ) /= words(i)(1:1) ) then\n                         all_ok = .false.\n                         exit\n                      end if\n                    end do\n\n        Step 6: If all_ok is .true., set result1 = \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        Step 7: Now process result1 for the second program:\n\n                s = result1\n                len_s = len_trim(s)   ! get the actual length without trailing spaces? But note: the string might have spaces in the middle? Our result1 doesn't. But the second program looks for the last non-space, non-question-mark.\n\n                We traverse from the end of the string to the beginning:\n\n                  do i = len_s, 1, -1\n                     if (s(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s(i:i) /= '?') then\n                         ch = s(i:i)\n                         exit\n                     end if\n                  end do\n\n                Convert ch to lowercase: we can use the IACHAR and ACHAR to convert to lowercase? Or use a function.\n\n                We can write a helper function? Or inline:\n\n                  if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n                     ch = achar(iachar(ch) + 32)   ! 32 is the difference between 'A' and 'a'\n                  end if\n\n                Then check:\n\n                  if (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n                     print *, \"YES\"\n                  else\n                     print *, \"NO\"\n                  end if\n\n        But note: the second program in the original code reads the entire line. Our result1 is the entire line? Yes.\n\n        However, the first program outputs without any extra spaces? We set result1 to \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the string is exactly that.\n\n        But note: the first program outputs without a newline? Actually, in Java, System.out.println adds a newline. However, the second program uses sc.nextLine() which would read the entire line including the newline? Actually, nextLine() reads and discards the newline.\n\n        But in our chain, we are passing the string without a newline? Because we are just using the string variable.\n\n        So we don't have a newline at the end of result1. The string is exactly \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n        Therefore, the last non-space, non-question-mark character is the last character of the word.\n\n        Example: \n            result1 = \"Yes\" -> len_trim is 3, so the last character is at position 3: 's'\n\n        We convert to lowercase: 's' -> not vowel -> output \"NO\"\n\n        Similarly, \"No\" -> last character is 'o' -> vowel -> output \"YES\"\n\n        However, note: the first program outputs \"Yes\" when the conditions hold, and then the overall output becomes \"NO\", which is the opposite of the first condition? \n\n        But that is the chain: the first program says \"Yes\" (meaning the conditions hold) and then the second program says \"NO\" (because the last letter of \"Yes\" is 's', which is not a vowel).\n\n        This seems odd, but that is the chain as given.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to run the two programs independently? But the instruction says: the output of the first is the input of the next.\n\n        So we must follow.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the first program in Java does:\n\n        if (ans) {\n            System.out.println(\"Yes\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"No\");\n        }\n\n        So the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" followed by a newline.\n\n        The second program then reads a whole line. The whole line would be \"Yes\" or \"No\" without the newline? Actually, nextLine() in Java consumes the newline and returns the string without the newline.\n\n        So we are safe to use the string without the newline.\n\n        Therefore, in Fortran, we don't include a newline in the string result1.\n\n        We set result1 to either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n        Then the second part processes that string.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n        We assume the input words are no longer than 100 characters, and there are at most 100 words.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            integer, parameter :: max_word_len = 100, max_words = 100\n            character(len=max_word_len) :: words(max_words)\n            integer :: n, i, j, len_s, last_index\n            logical :: all_ok, chain_ok\n            character(len=max_word_len) :: result1\n            character(len=1) :: ch\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: temp\n\n            ! Step 1: Read n\n            read(*,*) n\n\n            ! Step 2: Read the n words\n            do i = 1, n\n              read(*,*) words(i)\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 3: Check for duplicates\n            all_ok = .true.\n            do i = 1, n\n              do j = 1, i-1\n                if (words(j) == words(i)) then\n                  all_ok = .false.\n                  exit\n                end if\n              end do\n              if (.not. all_ok) exit\n            end do\n\n            ! Step 4: Check chain condition only if no duplicates found\n            chain_ok = .true.\n            if (all_ok) then\n              do i = 2, n\n                ! Get the last character of the previous word\n                last_index = len_trim(words(i-1))\n                if (words(i-1)(last_index:last_index) /= words(i)(1:1)) then\n                  chain_ok = .false.\n                  exit\n                end if\n              end do\n            end if\n\n            ! Step 5: Set result1\n            if (all_ok .and. chain_ok) then\n              result1 = \"Yes\"\n            else\n              result1 = \"No\"\n            end if\n\n            ! Now, Step 6: Process result1 for the second program\n\n            ! We traverse from the end of the string to the beginning to find the last non-space, non-question-mark\n            len_s = len_trim(result1)   ! We consider the trimmed string? But our string has no trailing spaces. However, the second program doesn't trim, it traverses backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question-mark.\n\n            ! But our result1 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which don't have spaces or question marks. So we can simply take the last non-space non-question-mark as the last character of the trimmed string? Actually, we traverse backwards until we find one.\n\n            ch = ' '   ! default\n            do i = len_s, 1, -1\n              if (result1(i:i) /= ' ' .and. result1(i:i) /= '?') then\n                ch = result1(i:i)\n                exit\n              end if\n            end do\n\n            ! If we didn't find any, then ch remains ' ', but that won't happen.\n\n            ! Convert ch to lowercase\n            if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n              ch = achar(iachar(ch) + 32)\n            end if\n\n            ! Check if ch is vowel\n            if (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n              write(*,*) \"YES\"\n            else\n              write(*,*) \"NO\"\n            end if\n\n          end program combined\n\n However, note: the second program might have an empty string? But our result1 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we are safe.\n\n But what if the string result1 is empty? We have set result1 to either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so it's not empty.\n\n Let's test with an example:\n\n   Example 1: The first program fails -> result1 = \"No\"\n\n        Then we traverse \"No\": \n            i=2: 'o' -> non-space and non-question-mark -> ch='o'\n            Convert to lowercase: 'o' -> vowel -> output \"YES\"\n\n   Example 2: The first program passes -> result1 = \"Yes\"\n\n        Then we traverse \"Yes\": \n            i=3: 's' -> non-space and non-question-mark -> ch='s'\n            Convert to lowercase: 's' -> not vowel -> output \"NO\"\n\n This matches.\n\n But note: the original first program breaks at the first duplicate or broken chain. We do the same.\n\n However, the original first program does:\n\n        HashMap<Integer, String> past = new HashMap<>();\n        ... and then for each word:\n            if (past.containsValue(map.get(i))) -> break\n\n        But note: the HashMap in Java is by index? Actually, it's storing the word at index i. And then it checks if the current word is already in the past words? Yes.\n\n        We are doing a nested loop that checks for duplicates in the entire array? Actually, we break at the first duplicate we find (when j < i and words(j)==words(i)). This is equivalent.\n\n        Also, the chain condition: we break at the first broken link.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program should be:\n\n        [as above]\n\n But note: the original first program does not check the chain condition if a duplicate is found? Actually, the original first program breaks out of the loop as soon as a duplicate is found? \n\n        In the loop for i from 0 to N-1:\n\n            if (past.containsValue(map.get(i))) -> break the loop and set ans=false.\n\n            Then, if i != 0, it checks the chain condition? But note: if a duplicate is found, it breaks immediately and does not check the chain condition for the current i? \n\n        However, in our code, we break out of the duplicate check as soon as we find a duplicate and then skip the chain condition? But note: the original program does both checks in the same loop. It first checks for duplicate, then if it's the first word it doesn't check chain, but for subsequent words it does check chain? And if either condition fails, it breaks.\n\n        But note: if a duplicate is found, we break and set all_ok to false, and then we skip the chain condition? Actually, we break out of the duplicate loop and then we don't do the chain condition at all? \n\n        However, the original program does the chain condition only if it is not the first word and only if the duplicate condition hasn't failed at the current step? Actually, the duplicate condition fails at the current step and breaks the entire loop. So the chain condition for the current step is skipped? But also, the chain condition for the next words is skipped because of the break.\n\n        Our code does:\n\n          We break out of the duplicate check as soon as we find one duplicate (and set all_ok to false) and then we break out of the outer duplicate loop. Then we skip the chain condition entirely? \n\n        But note: the original program does the chain condition for the current word even if a duplicate is found? Actually, no: because the duplicate condition breaks the loop and sets ans=false and then breaks. So the chain condition is not done for the current word? And the loop is broken.\n\n        However, the original program does the chain condition for the words that have been processed so far? Actually, the chain condition is done for every word starting from the second one until a failure. But if a duplicate is found at the current word, the chain condition for the current word (which is the second condition in the same iteration) is not done? \n\n        How the original Java code:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (past.containsValue(map.get(i))) {   // duplicate check\n                    ans = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n                past.put(i, map.get(i));\n                if (i != 0) {\n                    if (!next.equals(map.get(i).substring(0, 1))) {\n                        ans = false;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                next = map.get(i).substring(map.get(i).length() - 1, map.get(i).length());\n            }\n\n        So if at i (with i>=0) we find a duplicate, we break and skip the rest. The chain condition is only checked when i != 0 and if we haven't broken by duplicate.\n\n        Therefore, we must not check the chain condition at all if we found a duplicate? \n\n        Our code does:\n\n          We break out of the duplicate loop and set all_ok to false. Then we skip the chain condition? \n\n          But note: the original program breaks immediately and doesn't do the chain condition for the current i? And also, the chain condition for the previous words? Actually, the chain condition for the previous words was done? \n\n        However, the chain condition is done for every i starting from the second. For i=0, we don't check chain. For i=1, we check chain with the previous word (i=0). \n\n        Our code does the chain condition only if we didn't find a duplicate? But what if we have duplicates at i=3? Then the chain condition for i=2 and i=1 were already done? \n\n        But the original program breaks at i=3 (duplicate) and sets ans=false. It does not check the chain condition at i=3? But the chain condition at i=3 would have been: check if the last character of word[2] equals the first character of word[3]? \n\n        However, the original program does not do that because it breaks at the duplicate check.\n\n        But note: the chain condition for i=1 (which is the second word) was done? And if that was broken, we would have broken earlier? \n\n        So the original program might break at the chain condition earlier than a duplicate? \n\n        Our code currently:\n\n          First, we check for duplicates for every word until we find one. Then we break.\n\n          Then, if we didn't find a duplicate, we check the chain condition.\n\n        This is not the same: because the duplicate might be found at a later word than the chain condition? \n\n        We must break at the first failure: either duplicate or chain condition.\n\n        How to fix?\n\n          We can combine the two checks in one loop? \n\n          We do:\n\n            all_ok = .true.\n            chain_ok = .true.   ! but we don't need separate, we can use a single flag.\n\n            do i = 1, n\n\n              ! Check duplicate for the current word against all previous words (from 1 to i-1)\n              do j = 1, i-1\n                if (words(j) == words(i)) then\n                  all_ok = .false.\n                  exit   ! exit the inner loop, then we break the outer too?\n                end if\n              end do\n\n              if (.not. all_ok) exit   ! break the outer loop if duplicate found\n\n              ! Then check the chain condition: for i>=2\n              if (i >= 2) then\n                last_index = len_trim(words(i-1))\n                if (words(i-1)(last_index:last_index) /= words(i)(1:1)) then\n                  all_ok = .false.\n                  exit\n                end if\n              end if\n\n            end do\n\n          Then set result1 = \"Yes\" if all_ok is still .true., else \"No\".\n\n        This way, we break at the first failure (duplicate or chain condition).\n\n        But note: the chain condition for the current word (at index i) is only done if i>=2 and only for the previous word? \n\n        This matches the original: the chain condition is checked for the current word (if it's not the first) and only if the duplicate condition hasn't broken the loop.\n\n        So we'll rewrite the loop accordingly.\n\n        Also, note: the original program sets a variable 'next' that is the last character of the current word, which is then used in the next iteration? \n\n          In the first program, at iteration i, after checking the conditions, it sets:\n              next = last character of the current word.\n\n          Then in the next iteration (i+1), it checks: if the current word's first character equals 'next'. \n\n        But note: we don't need to store the last character for the next word? Because we are accessing the previous word's last character directly from the array.\n\n        Therefore, we can do without the variable 'next'.\n\n        So the corrected Fortran code:\n\n          program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            integer, parameter :: max_word_len = 100, max_words = 100\n            character(len=max_word_len) :: words(max_words)\n            integer :: n, i, j, last_index\n            logical :: all_ok\n            character(len=100) :: result1   ! we'll set to either \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n            character(len=1) :: ch\n            integer :: len_s\n\n            !

Check chain condition only if i>=2 (so we have a previous word)\n              if (i >= 2) then\n                last_index = len_trim(words(i-1))\n                if (words(i-1)(last_index:last_index) /= words(i)(1:1)) then\n                  all_ok = .false.\n                  exit\n                end if\n              end if\n            end do\n\n            if (all_ok) then\n              result1 = \"Yes\"\n            else\n              result1 = \"No\"\n            end if\n\n            ! Now, process result1 for the second program\n            len_s = len(result1)   ! we don't know if there are trailing spaces? But we set with \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we can use len_trim to ignore trailing spaces? However, the second program doesn't trim the entire string, it traverses backwards.\n\n            ! We traverse backwards to find the last non-space and non-question-mark\n            ch = ' '   ! default\n            do i = len_s, 1, -1\n              if (result1(i:i) /= ' ' .and. result1(i:i) /= '?') then\n                ch = result1(i:i)\n                exit\n              end if\n            end do\n\n            ! Convert to lowercase if it's uppercase\n            if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n              ch = achar(iachar(ch) + 32)\n            end if\n\n            if (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n              write(*,*) \"YES\"\n            else\n              write(*,*) \"NO\"\n            end if\n\n          end program combined\n\n Let's test with a small example:\n\n   Example 1: n=2, words = [\"apple\", \"egg\"]\n\n      Step 1: \n        i=1: \n          duplicate: j from 1 to 0 -> skip. \n          chain: i>=2? no.\n        i=2:\n          duplicate: j=1: \"apple\" != \"egg\" -> no duplicate.\n          chain: i=2 -> check: last character of words(1) is 'e' (if we assume \"apple\" -> last letter is 'e'? Actually, \"apple\" ends with 'e'? No, it ends with 'e'? Actually, \"apple\" is 5 letters: a,p,p,l,e -> last is 'e'. And \"egg\" starts with 'e'. -> matches.\n\n          So all_ok remains .true. -> result1=\"Yes\"\n\n          Then for result1=\"Yes\": last non-space is 's' -> lowercase 's' -> not vowel -> output \"NO\"\n\n   Example 2: n=2, words = [\"apple\", \"orange\"]\n\n        duplicate: none.\n        chain: last of \"apple\" is 'e', first of \"orange\" is 'o' -> fails -> result1=\"No\"\n\n        Then for \"No\": last non-space is 'o' -> vowel -> output \"YES\"\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the first example outputs \"NO\" and the second outputs \"YES\", which is the opposite of the first condition? But that is the chain.\n\n   We are following the chain.\n\n   But note: the original first program would output \"Yes\" for the first example and \"No\" for the second, and then the second program would output \"NO\" and \"YES\" respectively.\n\n   So we are consistent.\n\n   We assume the words are given without spaces? The read(*,*) reads tokens (space separated). So if a word has spaces, we cannot use read(*,*) with format default? \n\n   The original Java program uses sc.next() which reads tokens (space separated). So it's the same.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We set max_words to 100 and max_word_len to 100. The problem doesn't specify, but we assume limits.\n\n   If the problem requires more, we can adjust the parameters.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\"\n\n   We are only reading at the beginning and writing at the end.\n\n   We are done."
