    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_58_B):\n  - Reads an integer `n`.\n  - Prints `n` and then a space.\n  - Then it sets `m = n` and iterates from `n-1` down to 1.\n  - For each `i`, if `m` is divisible by `i`, it prints `i` and a space, and sets `m = i`.\n\nHowever, note that the entire output of the first program becomes the input of the second program.\n\nSecond program (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n  - Reads a string `s`.\n  - If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', it prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs a sequence of numbers (with spaces) and then the second program expects a string.\n\nHowever, the first program's output is a string of numbers separated by spaces. For example, if input to the first program is 10, the output is:\n\"10 5 1 \"   (Note: actually the last number is 1 and then a space? Let me check the code: it prints each number and then a space, and the last one is also followed by space.)\n\nBut note: the second program reads a single token (using `in.next()`). So the entire output of the first program is one string? However, the second program reads a single word. But the output of the first program has multiple numbers and spaces.\n\nActually, the second program reads the entire next token? How does the second program handle the input?\n\nBut note the example: the first program outputs multiple numbers and spaces. The second program's `in.next()` would read the first token? But that would be the first number. However, the entire output of the first program is a string that might have multiple tokens.\n\nBut the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second.\n\nLooking at the second program: it reads a string `s` with `in.next()`. This reads the next token (until whitespace). So if the first program outputs \"10 5 1 \", then the second program would read the first token \"10\", and then the rest of the tokens would be left unread. But the second program only reads one token.\n\nHowever, the second program does not read the entire output? This is a problem.\n\nBut let me check the original Java chain: the first program outputs a sequence of numbers and spaces (without any newline? Actually, `println` adds a newline at the end of each print. So the first program does:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");  -> This prints n and a space and then a newline.\nThen in the loop: System.out.println(i + \" \"); -> each one prints i, space, and then a newline.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n10[space][newline]\n5[space][newline]\n1[space][newline]\n\nNow the second program reads a token. The first token in this output would be \"10\" (because the space and newline are delimiters). So the second program only reads \"10\", and the rest of the output is not read.\n\nBut that does not match the intended chain? The problem says: the output of the first is the input to the next. But the second program only uses the first token? Then the rest is lost.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program is fed as the input stream to the second program.\n\nBut the second program only reads the first token? Then the rest of the tokens (and newlines) are in the input stream but not read. And then the second program writes \"Yes\" or \"No\" and that's the final output.\n\nBut the intended behavior of the chain? The first program outputs a sequence of numbers (each on a new line? Actually, each print is a println). And the second program reads a single token. So the chain's final output is always either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and it only depends on the first token of the first program's output.\n\nBut note: the first token is the original input number `n`. So the second program gets a string that is the string representation of `n`.\n\nThen the condition: if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'? But the string is a number, so it contains digits. How can it contain 'A' and 'B'? It cannot. So the condition would always be false? Then the second program would output \"No\" for any input?\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem: we are to combine two programs. The first program reads an integer and outputs a sequence of numbers (each on a new line). The second program reads a string and checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. But note: the entire output of the first program is the input to the second. However, the second program only reads the first token (the first word) of that input. And the first token is the initial number (as a string). \n\nSo the chain: \n  Input to the first program: integer n (say 10)\n  Output of the first program: \n        \"10 \\n\"\n        \"5 \\n\"\n        \"1 \\n\"\n  Input to the second program: the entire string \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\"\n  But the second program reads the first token from this input, which is \"10\".\n\nTherefore, the second program checks if the string \"10\" contains both 'A' and 'B'. It does not, so it outputs \"No\".\n\nBut what if we input n=12? \n  First program: \n      12 \n      6 \n      3 \n      1 \n  The second program gets the token \"12\", which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B'. So still \"No\".\n\nWhat if n=10? Then the token is \"10\", which doesn't have 'A' or 'B'.\n\nWhat if n=1? Then the token is \"1\".\n\nSo the condition in the second program will never be true? Then why is the second program written that way?\n\nWait, maybe the second program is meant to read the entire string? But the code uses `in.next()`, which reads one token.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the chain is not as intended? But the problem states: the output of each program is the input to the next.\n\nBut note: the second program's code is from a different problem (Atcoder ABC158 A) which expects a string of length 3 with either 'A' and 'B' in it? The problem in Atcoder is: there are two bus companies, A and B, and the string is the bus stops served. The string is either \"AAA\", \"AAB\", \"ABA\", etc. So the input is a string of 3 characters, each either 'A' or 'B'. And the program checks if there is at least one 'A' and one 'B'. \n\nBut in our chain, the input to the second program is the entire output of the first program? And the second program is only reading the first token? That doesn't match.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence. We are to mimic the behavior of the chain.\n\nTherefore, we must simulate:\n\nStep 1: Read an integer n (from standard input).\nStep 2: Run the first program's logic: \n        output = [n] \n        m = n\n        for i from n-1 down to 1:\n            if m % i == 0 then append i to output and set m = i\n        The output is a sequence of numbers, each printed on a new line with a space at the end? Actually, the code prints: \n            System.out.println(n + \" \");   -> that is: n, then space, then newline.\n            Similarly for each i: i, then space, then newline.\n\nStep 3: The second program reads from the entire output of the first program as its input. But the second program only reads the first token? So we are effectively using the first number (as a string) for the condition.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain is:\n\n  Read n (integer)\n  Compute the sequence: starting with n, then all the divisors in descending order that form a chain (each next one divides the previous in the chain) until 1.\n  Then, take the first token of the output (which is the string of n) and check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. \n\nBut note: the string of n is a string of digits. It will never contain the letter 'A' or 'B'. Therefore, the condition is always false, so the second program always outputs \"No\".\n\nSo the final Fortran program:\n\n  - Read an integer n.\n  - We don't need to compute the entire chain for the purpose of the second program? Because the second program only uses the first token (which is the string representation of n). And then we output \"No\".\n\nBut wait, what if n is negative? The first program: the input is positive? The problem says the first program: for i from n-1 down to 1. So n must be positive.\n\nHowever, we can avoid computing the entire chain if we realize that the second program only uses the string of n. But note: the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The first program does compute the entire chain (even though we don't need the entire chain for the output that is used). But we must mimic exactly? The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior includes the computation? But the problem does not specify that we can skip computations. So we must compute the chain? However, the chain is not used in the second program's input? But the chain is computed in the first program. So we do need to compute it? But in Fortran we are combining and we don't output the chain. We only need the first token (which is the string of n) for the second program.\n\nBut note: the first program might have side effects? Only the output is passed. However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we must avoid printing the chain? Then how do we get the first token? The first token is the string of n. So we can avoid computing the chain? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the first program is to compute the chain? But if the chain computation has side effects (like changing the state of the system) then we must do it. However, in this case, the chain computation is purely in memory. The only observable effect is the output. But the second program doesn't use the entire output. However, the problem does not say we can skip computations. So we must compute the chain? \n\nBut note: the chain computation does not affect the string of n. The string of n is fixed. So we can skip the chain? However, if n is large, the chain computation might be heavy. But the problem doesn't specify performance. But to be safe, we do what the original does.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". The original first program does compute the entire chain. So we must compute the chain? Even though we don't output it? \n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we are not allowed to print the chain. Then we must compute the chain and then only use the first token (which is the string of n) for the next step? \n\nBut the chain computation does not affect the string of n. So we can compute the chain without output and then use the string of n for the second step. That would be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid storing the entire chain? We only need to compute it without output? That's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  Step 1: Read integer n.\n  Step 2: Compute the chain (we don't output it, but we do the same computations: starting with m = n, then for i from n-1 down to 1, if m mod i == 0 then set m = i. We don't store the chain, but we do the loop? Actually, the original chain computation doesn't store the entire chain in an array, but it does print each element. But we are not allowed to print. So we just do the loop without printing? That is acceptable because the only observable effect of the chain computation is the output, and we are not doing that output. But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we skip the printing.\n\n  Step 3: Then, we take the string representation of the original n (not the chain) and check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. But note: the original first program outputs the original n as the first token. Then the second program reads that token.\n\n  Step 4: Output \"Yes\" if the string of n contains both 'A' and 'B', else \"No\".\n\nBut wait: the original first program outputs the chain, and the second program only uses the first token. So the chain computation is done, and then the second program uses the first token (the string of n). Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n  Read n\n  Compute the chain (without printing) \n  Convert n to a string\n  Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'\n  Output \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\nHowever, what if the first program had a different effect? For example, what if the chain computation changed the value of n? It doesn't: the first program uses a variable m. The original n is printed first. So in the chain computation, n is not changed. So the string representation is of the original n.\n\nTherefore, we can skip the chain computation? Why do we need to compute the chain? The problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The chain computation is done in the first program. But if the chain computation has no side effects (other than printing) then we can skip it? However, the problem does not specify the environment. But note: the chain computation might be heavy and the program might run in a time-constrained environment. If we skip the chain, we save time. But the original program does the chain. So if we skip the chain, then for large n the program would be faster? That is a different behavior.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we must compute the chain even though we don't use it? Because the problem says \"behaves identically\". The behavior includes the time? But typically, we care about the output. However, the problem does not specify. Since the chain computation does not affect the output of the entire chain (the final output is only based on the first token), we are allowed to skip the chain? But the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain does the computation. So we do it.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior we care about is the output? And the time is not considered? Or we must do the same steps? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"without I/O in the middle\", we are allowed to avoid printing the chain. But we must do the same computations? The chain computation in the first program is:\n\n   m = n\n   for i = n-1 down to 1:\n        if m % i == 0 then m = i\n\nWe can do that without printing. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  1. Read integer n.\n  2. Set m = n\n  3. Do i = n-1, 1, -1\n        if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n            m = i\n        end if\n  4. Convert the original n to a string (call it s)\n  5. Check if s contains 'A' and also contains 'B'\n  6. Print \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\nBut note: the original first program prints the chain? But we are skipping that? The problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we don't do that I/O. And the final output is only the last block (the \"Yes\" or \"No\"). So that's acceptable.\n\nHowever, what if the chain computation is very long? We are doing it, so the time is the same? So the behavior is the same? Yes.\n\nBut note: the original first program does print the chain, so the output of the first program is the chain? But we are not using that output for anything except to extract the first token? And we are not actually building the entire output string? But the problem says: the entire output of the first program is the input to the second. However, the second program only reads the first token. So we don't need the entire chain? We only need the first token? And that token is the string of the original n.\n\nSo the above plan is valid.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program had printed more than just the first token? For example, what if the first program printed multiple tokens? The second program only reads the first. So we only need the first token? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, m, i\n      character(len=20) :: s  ! enough to hold an integer string\n      logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n      ! Read n\n      read(*,*) n\n\n      ! Step 2: simulate the chain computation (without printing)\n      m = n\n      do i = n-1, 1, -1\n          if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n              m = i\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      ! Step 3: convert the original n to a string\n      write(s, '(I0)') n   ! This writes n without any extra spaces\n\n      ! Step 4: check if s contains 'A' and 'B'\n      hasA = index(s, 'A') > 0\n      hasB = index(s, 'B') > 0\n\n      ! Step 5: output the result\n      if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n          write(*,*) 'Yes'\n      else\n          write(*,*) 'No'\n      end if\n\n  end program combined\n\nBut wait: the original first program output the chain? But we are not outputting it. And the problem says: only the last block should produce output. So we are only outputting the \"Yes\" or \"No\". That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the original first program does output the chain? And the second program reads from that output. However, the second program only reads the first token. So we are effectively ignoring the rest? And we are not outputting the chain? That is acceptable because the problem says no I/O in the middle.\n\nBut what if the chain computation had an error? For example, if n is 0? The problem says the first program: for i from n-1 down to 1. If n=0, then the loop goes from -1 down to 1? That would run? But the original Java program would throw an exception? We should mimic that? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". However, the problem does not specify the input range. We assume positive integers? The original problem for codeforces_58_B: it's about coins, and n>=1.\n\nSo we assume n>=1.\n\nBut to be safe, we note that the original first program requires n>=1. So we assume that.\n\nTherefore, the above Fortran program is the solution.\n\nBut note: the second program in the original chain outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" without any extra spaces? Actually, it uses `out.println`, so it appends a newline. In Fortran, we use `write(*,*)` which by default adds a space at the beginning? Actually, no: for a string, it writes the string and then a newline? But note: `write(*,*) 'Yes'` will output \"Yes\" and then a newline? Actually, it might output with a space at the beginning? \n\nIn Fortran, `write(*,*)` is list-directed output. For a character string, it outputs the string without quotes and without leading space? But it might add a trailing space? Actually, the standard says: it outputs the string and then a space? Or a newline? \n\nWe want to output exactly the same as the original: the word and then a newline.\n\nWe can use:\n\n   write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n\nto output without extra spaces.\n\nSo:\n\n  if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n      write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n  else\n      write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n  end if\n\nTherefore, the final program:\n\n```fortran\nprogram combined\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n    ! Read the integer n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    ! Simulate the chain computation from the first program\n    m = n\n    do i = n-1, 1, -1\n        if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n            m = i\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert the original n to a string\n    write(s, '(I0)') n   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces\n\n    ! Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'\n    hasA = index(s, 'A') > 0\n    hasB = index(s, 'B') > 0\n\n    ! Output the result\n    if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n        write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n    else\n        write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n    end if\nend program combined\n```\n\nBut note: the chain computation does not store the entire chain? We are only updating m and i? That's the same as the original. The original doesn't store the chain either? It prints each element as it goes. But we are skipping the printing. So the computation is the same.\n\nThis program should behave identically: for the same input n, it will output \"No\" always? Because the string of n (which is a positive integer) will not contain the letters 'A' or 'B'. But that is what the original chain does.\n\nSo we are done."
