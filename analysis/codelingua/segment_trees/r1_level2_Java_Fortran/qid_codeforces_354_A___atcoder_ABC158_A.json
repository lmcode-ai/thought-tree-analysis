Since the problem constraints: n up to 100000, weights up to 10^6, and L, R, QL, QR up to 10^6? Then the total cost: base cost might be 10^6 * 100000 * 10^6 = 10^17? which is beyond 32-bit (max 2e9). Therefore, we must use 64-bit for L, R, QL, QR? How did the Java program do? It used:\n\n        int L, R, QL, QR;   // 32-bit integers? then: \n            cand = sum[lCount] * L   // sum[lCount] is long? because prefix_sum is long?

We are using 64-bit for prefix_sum, so we are safe. We can do:\n\n        prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + W(i) But then we are adding 32-bit to 64-bit? The result is 64-bit? So it's safe. Alternatively, we can convert W(i) to 64-bit? \n\n        prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + int(W(i), 8)\n\n   This is safer? But since W(i) is 32-bit and we assign to 64-bit, it will be promoted? So we can do without conversion. Now, the penalties: \n\n        imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)   -> lCount and rCount are integers? We are using the integer for indexing? But lCount is from 0 to N (N<=100000) so 32-bit is enough. However, when we multiply by QL (which is 64-bit), we should do: cand = cand + int(imbalance_left, 8) * QL + int(imbalance_right, 8) * QR\n\n        Or we can declare:\n\n            integer(8) :: imbalance_left, imbalance_right   -> but then we can compute:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0_8, int(lCount - rCount - 1, 8)) But we can also do:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)   -> as integer(8)? Actually, we can compute the penalties in 64-bit:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0_8, int(lCount,8) - int(rCount,8) - 1) But that is messy. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            cand = cand + int(imbalance_left,8) * QL + int(imbalance_right,8) * QR\n\n        Since imbalance_left and imbalance_right are small (<=100000) and QL, QR are 64-bit? We can also do:\n\n            cand = cand + QL * imbalance_left + QR * imbalance_right But then we are multiplying 64-bit by 32-bit? The result is 64-bit? Yes, so it is safe. Therefore, we do: cand = cand + QL * imbalance_left + QR *",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n First Java program (codeforces_354_A) does:\n   Reads N, L, R, QL, QR, and an array W of N integers.\n   Computes prefix sums of W.\n   Then iterates from firstR=0 to N (which is effectively the number of right-hand operations? but note: in the loop, lCount = firstR, and rCount = N - firstR)\n   For each split, it calculates:\n        cand = (sum of first lCount weights) * L + (sum of the rest) * R\n        plus additional penalties: \n            llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1) * QL\n            rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1) * QR\n   Then finds the minimum cand.\n\n Second Java program (atcoder_ABC158_A) does:\n   Reads a string s.\n   If the string contains both 'A' and 'B', then prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n However, note the instruction: the entire sequence of programs. The output of the first is the input to the second? \n\n But wait: the first program outputs a long integer, and the second expects a string? \n\n This does not match. Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the first program outputs a long integer and the second expects a string? \n\n Actually, the second program reads a string. How can we chain?\n\n We must reinterpret the problem: the entire sequence of programs. However, the two programs are independent? \n\n But note: the problem says \"executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the first program outputs a long integer. The second program expects a string. How to chain?\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option 1: The output of the first is a number, which we then convert to a string and feed as input to the second.\n\n But the second program (atcoder_ABC158_A) expects a string that is either \"AAA\", \"ABA\", etc. and then checks for the presence of both 'A' and 'B'. \n\n The first program outputs a number, say 123. Then the second program would read the string \"123\", which does not contain both 'A' and 'B'? So it would output \"No\".\n\n That does not seem to be the intended chain? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might have provided two separate chains? But the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n After reexamination: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program\". So we must combine both.\n\n However, the two programs are completely independent? They read different inputs? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we are going to read all the input at the beginning (for both programs) and then at the end produce the output of the last program.\n\n But note: the second program in the chain is the one that produces the final output, and it should take as input the output of the first.\n\n However, the first program outputs a long integer, which we must pass as a string to the second? \n\n But the second program expects a string that is a sequence of 'A' and/or 'B'? \n\n There is a mismatch. Therefore, we must assume that the problem intended a different chain? Or perhaps the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might have provided two separate programs that are to be run in sequence, but the output of the first is not the input to the second? \n\n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n However, the second program does not use the output of the first? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n The original chain: \n   First program reads integers (N, L, R, QL, QR, and array W of N integers) and outputs a long integer.\n   Then the second program reads a string (which, in the chain, is the output of the first program?).\n\n But the second program expects a string that contains only the letters 'A' and 'B'. The first program outputs a number. \n\n How can we run the second program on the output of the first? \n\n Example: if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would read the string \"123\", which does not contain 'A' or 'B'. Then it would output \"No\".\n\n However, the original chain (as two separate programs) would be:\n\n   $ java codeforces_354_A\n        (input: ... numbers ...)\n        output: 123\n\n   $ java atcoder_ABC158_A\n        input: 123   [which is the output from the first?]\n        output: \"No\"\n\n But that is not the intended use of the second program? The second program was designed for a problem about stations and buses, and the input is a string of length 3 of either 'A' or 'B'. \n\n Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are independent and the problem intended to show two separate programs? But the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have provided the wrong set? \n\n But the instruction says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\".\n\n So we must chain them. \n\n How to resolve? \n\n We must interpret the chain as:\n\n   Step 1: Run the first program on the initial input (the integers) and capture its output (a long integer) as a string.\n   Step 2: Use that string as the input to the second program.\n\n Therefore, the entire Fortran program will:\n\n   Read the integers for the first program (N, L, R, QL, QR, and the array W of N integers) and also read the string for the second program? \n\n But wait: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" meaning we read all the input at the beginning? \n\n However, the second program in the chain does not have its input available at the beginning? The input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\n Therefore, we must simulate the chain:\n\n   We read the input for the first program (the integers and the array).\n   Then we run the first program's logic and compute the output (the long integer) and convert it to a string.\n   Then we run the second program's logic on that string.\n\n But note: the second program does not read from the initial input, it reads the output of the first.\n\n So the Fortran program will:\n\n   Step 1: Read the integers: N, L, R, QL, QR, and then the N integers for W.\n   Step 2: Compute the first program's output (min) as a long integer.\n   Step 3: Convert that long integer to a string. (This becomes the input to the second program)\n   Step 4: Then run the second program's logic on that string: check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'? \n\n However, note: the second program expects a string that is the entire input? The example in the second program is a string of three characters? \n\n But the output of the first program might be a multi-digit number. The second program will check the entire string (which is the digits of the number) for the presence of the letters 'A' and 'B'. Since it is a number, it will not contain any letter? So the second program will always output \"No\".\n\n That seems odd.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the two programs are independent and we are to run them on separate inputs? \n\n But the problem says \"executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Therefore, we must do as described.\n\n However, let's check the original problem statements:\n\n First program: \n   Problem A from Codeforces Round 354: \n        http://codeforces.com/contest/676/problem/A\n   Actually, the problem in the code is not that? The problem in the code is about weights and two doors.\n\n   The problem in the code: \n        We have N items, each with weight W[i]. We can take an item to the left door (cost L per unit) or the right door (cost R per unit). \n        Additionally, if we switch from left to right or vice versa, there is an extra cost: \n            If the number of left operations is more than the right by at least 2, then we add QL for each extra switch beyond the first imbalance? \n            Actually, the penalty is: \n                llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1) * QL\n                rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1) * QR\n\n   The output is the minimum total cost.\n\n Second program: \n   Problem A from AtCoder ABC 158: \n        https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc158/tasks/abc158_a\n        Station and Bus: \n          There is a string s of length 3 of either 'A' or 'B'. \n          It represents the bus company for three stations. \n          If there is at least one station of company 'A' and at least one station of company 'B', then print \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\".\n\n   The input to the second program is a string of 3 characters? \n\n Now, the output of the first program is a number (could be large) and then we feed that as a string to the second? \n\n The second program checks if that string (which is a sequence of digits) contains the letter 'A' and the letter 'B'. Since it is digits, it will never contain either? So the second program will always output \"No\".\n\n This is a valid chain? \n\n But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n So if we run the two programs in sequence, the Fortran program should do:\n\n   Read the input for the first program (N, L, R, QL, QR, and the array W of size N) and then run the first program to get a number, then run the second program using the string representation of that number.\n\n   And the second program will output \"No\", unless the string representation of the number contains both 'A' and 'B'? which is impossible.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n   Step 1: Read the integers: \n        integer :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n        integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n        read *, N\n        read *, L, R, QL, QR\n        allocate(W(N))\n        read *, W   ! but note: the array W is read in one go? or one per line? The Java code uses nextInt() in a loop, so we assume one line? \n\n        However, in Fortran, if we do `read *, W` and the input has all the N numbers in one line? or multiple? The Java code uses a loop and the input could be multiple lines.\n\n        We'll read the array W in a loop? or one read? Since the problem does not specify the input format, we assume that the integers are provided in the order: \n            N\n            L R QL QR\n            W0 W1 ... W_{N-1}\n\n        And they can be in separate lines or one line? We'll use list-directed input.\n\n   Step 2: Compute the first program's result (min_total_cost) as a long integer (we use integer(kind=8) for long).\n\n        We'll compute the prefix sum of W.\n\n        Then iterate lCount from 0 to N (which is the number of items taken to the left?).\n\n        For each lCount:\n            rCount = N - lCount\n            cand = prefix_sum(lCount) * L + (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount)) * R\n            imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)\n            imbalance_right = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1)\n            cand = cand + imbalance_left * QL + imbalance_right * QR\n\n            then update min_total_cost.\n\n   Step 3: Convert min_total_cost to a string.\n\n        We'll write the integer to a character variable.\n\n   Step 4: For the second program: \n\n        We have a string (the character variable from step3). We need to check if it contains the character 'A' and the character 'B'. \n\n        But note: the second program checks: \n            if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) -> then \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n        However, our string is the digits of the number. It will not contain 'A' or 'B'. So we can simply output \"No\".\n\n        But to be safe, we write:\n\n            if (index(string, 'A') > 0 .and. index(string, 'B') > 0) then\n                write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n            else\n                write(*,*) \"No\"\n            end if\n\n   However, note: the original second program outputs without quotes? Actually, the Java program uses out.println(\"Yes\") so it outputs without quotes? \n\n   We'll output without quotes.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we output the result of the second program.\n\n But note: the original chain would output the first program's output to stdout, and then the second program would read from stdin? \n\n How to simulate? \n\n   The Fortran program should not output the first program's result to the console? Instead, we capture it as a string and pass to the second.\n\n   Then the second program's output is the only output.\n\n Therefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n      Read the input for the first program (the integers and the array).\n      Compute the first program's result (min_total_cost) and convert it to a string.\n      Then run the second program's logic on that string (check for 'A' and 'B') and output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n But note: the first program's output is a number, and the second program expects a string? \n\n However, the second program in the chain would read the first program's output as a string? \n\n Example: if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would read the string \"123\". \n\n So we do:\n\n      character(len=50) :: str  ! 50 should be enough for a long integer\n      write(str, '(I0)') min_total_cost   ! This writes the integer without leading spaces\n\n      Then check for 'A' and 'B' in the string 'str'\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain might read the entire line? \n\n But in the second program: `String s = in.next();` which reads a token (so it would read the entire number as a string).\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read N, L, R, QL, QR\n     2. Read the array W of N integers.\n\n     3. Compute the prefix sum array (size N+1) and the total sum.\n\n        prefix_sum(0) = 0\n        prefix_sum(i) = prefix_sum(i-1) + W(i) for i=1 to N\n\n     4. Initialize min_total_cost to a large integer (use huge(0_8) but note: we are using integer(8) for cand and min_total_cost)\n\n     5. Loop lCount from 0 to N:\n\n          rCount = N - lCount\n\n          cand = prefix_sum(lCount) * L + (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount)) * R\n\n          imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)\n          imbalance_right = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1)\n\n          cand = cand + imbalance_left * QL + imbalance_right * QR\n\n          min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cand)\n\n     6. Convert min_total_cost to a string.\n\n     7. Check if the string contains 'A' and 'B'? \n\n          posA = index(str, 'A')\n          posB = index(str, 'B')\n          if (posA > 0 .and. posB > 0) then\n              write(*,*) \"Yes\"\n          else\n              write(*,*) \"No\"\n          end if\n\n   But note: the second program outputs without spaces? The Java println outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n   In Fortran, we use: \n        write(*, '(A)') \"Yes\"   or   write(*, '(A)') \"No\"\n\n   This will output without quotes and with a newline.\n\n However, note: the original first program outputs the number and then a newline? \n\n   But in the chain, the second program reads the entire token? The newline would be a separator? \n\n   Our Fortran program does not output the number to the console? We are only using the string representation internally.\n\n   So we don't output the number.\n\n   Therefore, the only output is the second program's output.\n\n But wait: what about the input for the second program? \n\n   The original second program would read from stdin, which in the chain is the output of the first. \n\n   We are simulating by converting the number to a string and then processing that string.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n However, note: the input to the entire Fortran program is only the input for the first program? \n\n   But the second program in the chain does not require additional input? It uses the output of the first.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program reads only the input for the first program.\n\n   There is no additional input.\n\n   So the input format is: \n        First: N, L, R, QL, QR\n        Then: the N integers of W\n\n   The original chain: \n        $ java codeforces_354_A\n            5 1 2 3 4\n            10 20 30 40 50\n        (outputs some number, say 123)\n\n        Then: \n        $ java atcoder_ABC158_A\n            123   [this is entered by the user? or piped?]\n\n   But in the Fortran program, we are reading the first program's input and then we are done? \n\n   The second program's input is generated internally.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program should not read any additional input.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   - We use integer(8) for the min_total_cost and cand? Because the first program uses long (which is 64-bit integer).\n\n   - The array W and prefix_sum: the prefix_sum array might be large? But the problem does not specify constraints. We assume N is not too big.\n\n   - The conversion to string: we use an internal write.\n\n   - The string length: the maximum value of min_total_cost? It can be as large as about 10^5 * 10^5 (if weights and L/R are 10^5) -> 10^10, which is 10 or 11 digits? But worst-case: weights up to 10^5, L and R up to 10^5, and N up to 10^5? Then the total cost could be 10^5 * 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^15 -> 16 digits. So we allocate 20 characters.\n\n   - We'll use: character(len=20) :: str\n\n   - Write: write(str, *) min_total_cost   -> but this might have leading spaces? We don't care because we are only checking for the presence of 'A' and 'B'. However, the string will not have any letters? So it's safe.\n\n   But wait: what if the number is negative? The first program uses non-negative weights? The problem does not say. The Java program uses long and the weights are read as int. The problem statement of the first program? \n\n   Codeforces 354A: \n        Input: \n            The first line contains integers n, l, r, Ql, QR (1<=n<=100000, ...)\n            The second line contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (1<=wi<=10^6)\n\n        So weights are positive, and the other integers are positive? \n\n        Therefore, min_total_cost is positive? \n\n   So we don't have negative numbers.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read N, L, R, QL, QR\n     2. Allocate W and read W.\n\n     3. Compute prefix_sum(0..N) and total_sum = prefix_sum(N)\n\n     4. Initialize min_val to a big number (use huge(0) for integer(8))\n\n     5. Loop lCount from 0 to N:\n\n          rCount = N - lCount\n\n          ! Calculate the base cost\n          cand = prefix_sum(lCount) * L + (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount)) * R\n\n          ! Calculate the imbalance penalties\n          imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)\n          imbalance_right = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1)\n\n          cand = cand + imbalance_left * QL + imbalance_right * QR\n\n          if (cand < min_val) min_val = cand\n\n     6. Convert min_val to string.\n\n     7. Check the string for 'A' and 'B'\n\n   Note: The max function in Fortran: we can use `max` for integers.\n\n   We must be cautious: the array indices? Fortran is 1-indexed. Our prefix_sum:\n\n        prefix_sum(1) = W(1)   -> but in the Java program, prefix_sum[0]=0, prefix_sum[1]=W[0]\n\n        We'll set:\n\n          prefix_sum(1) = 0\n          prefix_sum(2) = W(1)\n          prefix_sum(3) = W(1)+W(2)\n\n        So we have:\n\n          prefix_sum(i) = sum_{k=1}^{i-1} W(k)   for i=1 to N+1\n\n        Then for lCount (which in Java was from 0 to N) corresponds to prefix_sum(lCount+1) in Fortran? \n\n        Actually, in Java: \n            prefix_sum[0] = 0\n            prefix_sum[1] = W0\n            prefix_sum[2] = W0+W1\n            ... \n            prefix_sum[N] = W0+...+W_{N-1}\n\n        And the total sum = prefix_sum[N] (in Java index)\n\n        In Fortran, we can define:\n\n          prefix_sum(1) = 0\n          prefix_sum(2) = W(1)\n          prefix_sum(3) = W(1)+W(2)\n          ...\n          prefix_sum(N+1) = total_sum\n\n        Then when lCount (in Java) is k, then the sum of the first k weights is prefix_sum(k+1) in Fortran? \n\n        But note: in the loop, we are using:\n\n          cand = prefix_sum(lCount) * L   [in Java: prefix_sum[lCount] is the sum of the first lCount weights] \n                 + (sum[N] - prefix_sum[lCount]) * R\n\n        In Fortran, for lCount (which we are iterating from 0 to N) we can use:\n\n          prefix_sum(lCount+1) for the sum of the first lCount weights? \n\n        Actually, if lCount=0, then we want prefix_sum(1) = 0 -> which is our prefix_sum(1)\n        if lCount=1, then we want the first weight -> prefix_sum(2) = W(1)\n\n        So:\n\n          cand = prefix_sum(lCount+1) * L + (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount+1)) * R\n\n        Then we do the penalties.\n\n        We are iterating lCount from 0 to N -> in Fortran, we can do:\n\n          do lCount = 0, N\n\n          end do\n\n     8. Convert min_val to a string: we use internal file.\n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        write(str, *) min_val   ! This writes with leading spaces? \n\n        But we don't care because we are going to check the entire string.\n\n     9. Check:\n\n          if (index(str, 'A') /= 0 .and. index(str, 'B') /= 0) then\n              write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n          else\n              write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n          end if\n\n   However, note: the string written by `write(str, *)` might have leading spaces? The index function ignores the leading spaces? It searches the whole string. So if there is an 'A' or 'B' in the digits? Actually, there won't be. But we do the check.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java: the input is read by `in.next()` which reads the next token (without spaces). In our Fortran, we are writing the entire number with possible leading spaces? \n\n   The second program would see the token without the leading spaces? \n\n   How did we simulate? We are writing the number to a string. The string will have the entire number including leading spaces? \n\n   But the Java Scanner would skip the whitespace? \n\n   In our Fortran, we are writing the number with a list-directed write: which for integers will write the number with a leading space if positive? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        write(str, '(I0)') min_val   ! to avoid leading spaces.\n\n   But the problem: the second program reads the entire token? So if we write without spaces, then the entire string is the number? \n\n   So we do:\n\n        character(len=20) :: str\n        write(str, '(I0)') min_val   ! no leading spaces\n\n   Then we check the string.\n\n   But note: the number might be negative? The problem states positive numbers, but let's be safe: we use I0 for absolute value? Actually, the I0 format writes the integer without leading spaces and with a minus if negative.\n\n   However, the problem says the weights and the other parameters are positive? So the total cost is positive? \n\n   So we can use I0.\n\n   But if negative, we write with a minus. Then we check the string: the minus is not a letter? It's a '-'? \n\n   So we are safe: the string will not contain 'A' or 'B'. \n\n   Therefore, we can simply output \"No\", but we write the check.\n\n   However, what if the number is 65? Then the string is \"65\", which does not contain 'A' (which is 65 in ASCII) but the character '6' and '5'. So no.\n\n   So the check will always be false? \n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if (index(str, 'A') > 0 .and. index(str, 'B') > 0) then\n            write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n        else\n            write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n        end if\n\n   But note: the index function returns 0 if not found. So:\n\n        index(str, 'A') > 0   if there's an 'A' in the string? \n\n   However, the string is composed of digits and possibly a minus? So no 'A' or 'B'. \n\n   Therefore, we can just write \"No\". But we write the check for clarity.\n\n   Alternatively, we can skip the conversion and just output \"No\", but that would be incorrect if the problem changes? \n\n   We'll do the check.\n\n   But note: the second program in the chain would read the entire token? So if the first program outputs \"65\", the second program would get the string \"65\", which does not contain the letter 'A'? \n\n   So the second program outputs \"No\".\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program will always output \"No\"? \n\n   This is the behavior of the chain? \n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs a number that in string form contains the letter 'A'? \n\n   How? The letter 'A' is 65 in ASCII, but we are writing the number 65 as the string \"65\", which is two characters: '6' and '5'. \n\n   So it will never contain the letter 'A'. \n\n   Therefore, the chain always outputs \"No\".\n\n   But that is the behavior.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n   So if we run the two Java programs in sequence, we get:\n\n        $ echo \"5 1 2 3 4\n        10 20 30 40 50\" | java codeforces_354_A\n            (some number, say 123)\n\n        $ echo \"123\" | java atcoder_ABC158_A\n            No\n\n   So the Fortran program should output \"No\".\n\n   But note: the second program might not work if the token is split by spaces? The first program outputs without spaces? \n\n   The first program: System.out.println(min); -> which outputs the number and then a newline.\n\n   Then the second program: in.next() reads tokens (skipping whitespace). So it would read the entire number (without the newline) as the token.\n\n   In our Fortran, we are writing the number without spaces and without a newline? Then we check the entire string? \n\n   But note: the second program does not get the newline? It only gets the token. So we are correct.\n\n   However, in the conversion to string, we don't include the newline? So we are passing the same token.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program is:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: N, L, R, QL, QR, i\n        integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n        integer(8) :: min_val, cand, total_sum\n        integer(8), allocatable :: prefix_sum(:)\n        integer :: lCount, rCount, imbalance_left, imbalance_right\n        character(len=20) :: str\n\n        !

Compute prefix_sum: from 0 to N (so we need N+1 elements)\n        allocate(prefix_sum(N+1))\n        prefix_sum(1) = 0\n        do i = 1, N\n            prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + W(i)\n        end do\n        total_sum = prefix_sum(N+1)\n\n        min_val = huge(0_8)   ! a big number\n\n        do lCount = 0, N\n            rCount = N - lCount\n\n            ! Calculate base cost: \n            !   The first lCount items go to the left: cost L each -> total cost = (prefix_sum(lCount+1)) * L\n            !   The remaining rCount items go to the right: cost R each -> total cost = (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount+1)) * R\n            cand = prefix_sum(lCount+1) * L + (total_sum - prefix_sum(lCount+1)) * R\n\n            ! Penalties for imbalance\n            imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)\n            imbalance_right = max(0, rCount - lCount - 1)\n\n            cand = cand + imbalance_left * QL + imbalance_right * QR\n\n            if (cand < min_val) min_val = cand\n        end do\n\n        ! Convert min_val to string\n        write(str, '(I0)') min_val\n\n        ! Now, check the string for 'A' and 'B'\n        if (index(str, 'A') > 0 .and. index(str, 'B') > 0) then\n            write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n        else\n            write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n        end if\n\n        end program combined\n\n   However, note: the penalties are computed as integers? But the variables imbalance_left, imbalance_right are integers? And we multiply by QL and QR (which are integers). Then add to cand (which is integer(8)). \n\n   But the multiplication: integer * integer(8) -> we should make sure we use 64-bit for the penalties? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        cand = cand + int(imbalance_left,8) * int(QL,8) + int(imbalance_right,8) * int(QR,8)\n\n   But QL and QR are integers (32-bit). And the penalties might be large? \n\n   Since imbalance_left and imbalance_right are at most N (which is up to 100000) and QL, QR up to 100000? Then the penalty term can be up to 10^10, which fits in 64-bit? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        cand = cand + int(imbalance_left,8) * QL + int(imbalance_right,8) * QR\n\n   But note: QL and QR are integers. We can promote to 64-bit by converting to 64-bit? \n\n   Alternatively, we can declare L, R, QL, QR as integer(8)? \n\n   The problem says: the input integers for L, R, QL, QR are integers (in Java, int). But the product: prefix_sum(lCount+1) * L might be huge? \n\n   We are already using 64-bit for cand. The multiplication: if L is 32-bit and prefix_sum is 64-bit, the product will be 64-bit? \n\n   In Fortran, the result of multiplication is the largest type? \n\n   But let me check: \n\n        integer(8) * integer(4) -> integer(8) ? \n\n   Yes, in Fortran, when multiplying two integers of different kinds, the result is the kind with the larger decimal exponent range? But the standard does not specify. \n\n   We can avoid by converting L, R, QL, QR to 64-bit? \n\n   Alternatively, we can read them as 64-bit? \n\n   Since the problem constraints: \n        n up to 100000, weights up to 10^6, and L, R, QL, QR up to 10^6? \n\n   Then the total cost: base cost might be 10^6 * 100000 * 10^6 = 10^17? which is beyond 32-bit (max 2e9). \n\n   Therefore, we must use 64-bit for L, R, QL, QR? \n\n   How did the Java program do? It used:\n\n        int L, R, QL, QR;   // 32-bit integers? \n        then: \n            cand = sum[lCount] * L   // sum[lCount] is long? because prefix_sum is long? \n\n        In Java: \n            long cand = ... \n            and the multiplication: L is int, but it is promoted to long? \n\n   So we should use 64-bit for L, R, QL, QR to avoid overflow? \n\n   Therefore, we change:\n\n        integer(8) :: N, L, R, QL, QR   ! but N is at most 100000, so 32-bit is enough? But the array indexing requires 32-bit? \n\n        Actually, we can keep N as 32-bit. But L, R, QL, QR should be 64-bit? \n\n   But note: the multiplication:\n\n        prefix_sum(lCount+1) is 64-bit, L is 32-bit: then the product is 64-bit? \n\n   But the product might be huge: prefix_sum(lCount+1) can be up to 10^11 (if N=100000 and each weight=10^6) -> 10^11 * 10^6 = 10^17, which is within 64-bit? \n\n   But if L is 32-bit and we multiply by a 64-bit, the result is 64-bit? \n\n   So we are safe? \n\n   However, to be consistent and avoid overflow, we read L, R, QL, QR as 64-bit? \n\n   We'll declare:\n\n        integer(8) :: L, R, QL, QR\n\n   But then when reading:\n\n        read(*,*) N\n        read(*,*) L, R, QL, QR\n\n   But N is 32-bit? We can leave N as 32-bit.\n\n   But the array W is of integers? We are storing as 32-bit? The problem says weights are integers (int in Java) so 32-bit? \n\n   But the prefix_sum is 64-bit? \n\n   So:\n\n        integer :: N, i\n        integer(8) :: L, R, QL, QR\n        integer :: W(N)   ! 32-bit is enough? weights up to 10^6 -> 10^6 * 100000 = 10^11, which is 36 bits? so 64-bit for prefix_sum.\n\n   We are using 64-bit for prefix_sum and cand? \n\n   Therefore, we change the declaration:\n\n        integer :: N\n        integer(8) :: L, R, QL, QR\n        integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n        integer(8) :: min_val, cand, total_sum\n        integer(8), allocatable :: prefix_sum(:)\n\n   And the reading: \n\n        read(*,*) N\n        read(*,*) L, R, QL, QR\n\n   Then the array W: \n\n        allocate(W(N))\n        do i=1, N\n            read(*,*) W(i)\n        end do\n\n   Then the prefix_sum:\n\n        prefix_sum(1) = 0\n        do i=1, N\n            prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + int(W(i), 8)   ! to avoid 32-bit overflow in the sum? \n        end do\n\n   But note: the weights are integers (32-bit) but their sum might be 10^11, which requires 64-bit? \n\n   We are using 64-bit for prefix_sum, so we are safe.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + W(i)\n\n   But then we are adding 32-bit to 64-bit? The result is 64-bit? \n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can convert W(i) to 64-bit? \n\n        prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + int(W(i), 8)\n\n   This is safer? \n\n   But since W(i) is 32-bit and we assign to 64-bit, it will be promoted? \n\n   So we can do without conversion.\n\n   Now, the penalties: \n\n        imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)   -> lCount and rCount are integers? We are using the integer for indexing? \n\n        But lCount is from 0 to N (N<=100000) so 32-bit is enough.\n\n        However, when we multiply by QL (which is 64-bit), we should do:\n\n            cand = cand + int(imbalance_left, 8) * QL + int(imbalance_right, 8) * QR\n\n        Or we can declare:\n\n            integer(8) :: imbalance_left, imbalance_right   -> but then we can compute:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0_8, int(lCount - rCount - 1, 8))\n\n        But we can also do:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)   -> as integer(8)? \n\n        Actually, we can compute the penalties in 64-bit:\n\n            imbalance_left = max(0_8, int(lCount,8) - int(rCount,8) - 1)\n\n        But that is messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            cand = cand + int(imbalance_left,8) * QL + int(imbalance_right,8) * QR\n\n        Since imbalance_left and imbalance_right are small (<=100000) and QL, QR are 64-bit? \n\n        We can also do:\n\n            cand = cand + QL * imbalance_left + QR * imbalance_right\n\n        But then we are multiplying 64-bit by 32-bit? The result is 64-bit? \n\n        Yes, so it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        cand = cand + QL * imbalance_left + QR * imbalance_right\n\n   But note: the variables imbalance_left and imbalance_right are integers? We are multiplying by 64-bit? The result is 64-bit? \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Revised code:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        integer :: N, i, lCount, rCount, imbalance_left, imbalance_right\n        integer(8) :: L, R, QL, QR\n        integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n        integer(8) :: min_val, cand, total_sum\n        integer(8), allocatable :: prefix_sum(:)\n        character(len=20) :: str\n\n        read(*,*) N\n        read(*,*) L, R, QL, QR\n        allocate(W(N))\n        do i = 1, N\n            read(*,*) W(i)\n        end do\n\n        allocate(prefix_sum(N+1))\n        prefix_sum(1) = 0\n        do i = 1, N\n            prefix_sum(i+1) = prefix_sum(i) + W(i)   !
