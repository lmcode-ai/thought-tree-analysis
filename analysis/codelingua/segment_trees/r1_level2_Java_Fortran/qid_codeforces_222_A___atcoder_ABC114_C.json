So 357: \"357\" -> has all -> count=1. Then next: 373: \"373\" -> has 3 and 7, but no 5 -> skip. Then 375: \"375\" -> has 3,7,5 -> count=2. So the algorithm generates every number that uses only 3,5,7 (in base-3-like increment) and then checks if it has all three. We can do the same in Fortran. Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k and then n integers. Step 2: Compute the trailing consecutive count (c) and then:\n        if (c + k > n) then\n            X = n - c\n        else\n            X = -1\n        end if\n\n   Step 3: Set N = X.\n\n   Step 4: Initialize:\n            integer(kind=8) :: i = 357\n            integer :: count_357 = 0 If (N < 357) then the loop won't run? but note: if N is -1, then we skip.

Then after the loop, since flipped is false, we append a '3'. Then the new string is \"333\" (from the loop) and then we append '3'? Then we reverse? How did they build? They built the new string by appending the new digit for each position? So the initial new string is built as:\n                    last digit: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                    middle: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                    first: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                Then the string is \"333\", then we append '3' -> becomes \"3333\", then reverse -> \"3333\" So the next number is 3333. So in Fortran, we can do:\n\n            We have a string `s` representing the current number (as a string of digits, most significant first). We'll create a new string `next_str` that is initially empty. Set flipped = .false. Do j = len(s) down to 1:\n                current_char = s(j:j)\n                if (flipped) then\n                    next_str = trim(next_str) // current_char   ! but we are building from the least significant? so we are appending to the right?",

Example: for 357 (s=\"357\"):\n                    j=0: a = '7' -> becomes '3' -> then we append '3' -> sb becomes \"3\"\n                    j=1: a = '5' -> becomes '7' -> append '7' -> sb becomes \"37\"\n                    j=2: a = '3' -> append '3' -> sb becomes \"373\"\n                    Then we reverse -> \"373\"\n\n            So in Fortran, we can build the string in the same way: we traverse the original string from last character to first, and for each character we append the new digit to a temporary string?

Actually, the Java code: They have a StringBuilder `sb` that after the loop is \"533\". Then they reverse -> \"335\". Then the next number is 335?

So we can do:\n\n            We build a string `temp` by appending the new digit for the last digit, then the new digit for the second last, ... then the new digit for the first? Then we reverse `temp` to get the next number? But note: we already processed the digits from last to first? and then we reverse?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into a single Fortran program.\n The first program (codeforces_222_A) reads integers n and k, then reads a sequence of n integers.\n It then counts the consecutive same numbers at the end (c) and the last number (l).\n Then it checks: if (c + k > n) then output (n - c) else output -1.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads an integer N and then counts numbers (starting from 357) that are <= N and contain exactly the digits 3,5,7 (and only these) and at least one of each. However, note that the second program expects its input to be the output of the first program? But wait, the original problem says the output of each program is used as input to the next.\n\n However, note: the first program outputs either (n-c) or -1. The second program expects an integer N (which in the original context was the input to the second program). But the output of the first program is a single integer (either a nonnegative number or -1). So the chain is:\n\n Input for the entire system: the input for the first program (n, k, and then n integers).\n Then the first program produces an integer (say, X).\n Then the second program is run with input X.\n\n But note: the second program (atcoder_ABC114_C) is designed to count numbers that are <= N (which in the chain becomes X) and that are \"357 numbers\". However, if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would run with input -1? That might not make sense because the second program counts numbers starting at 357 (which is positive) and then increments. Also, the condition in the while loop is `i <= N`. If N is -1, then the while loop condition fails (because 357 > -1) and the program outputs 0.\n\n But let's analyze the chain:\n\n The first program: \n   It counts the trailing consecutive same numbers (c) in the sequence of n integers.\n   Then if (c + k > n) then output n-c (which is between 0 and n-1) else output -1.\n\n The second program: \n   It counts the numbers of the form that are composed of digits 3,5,7 and contain each at least once, and are <= N (where N is the input to the second program, i.e., the output of the first program).\n\n However, note that the second program's original input was a single integer (N) and that integer is the output of the first program.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We must read the input for the first program: n, k, and then n integers.\n\n 2. Process the n integers to compute the trailing consecutive count (c) and then compute:\n        if (c + k > n) then X = n - c\n        else X = -1\n\n 3. Then use X as the input to the second program (which will be the N for the second program).\n\n 4. The second program then counts the numbers i (starting at 357) that are <= X and that satisfy the condition of having at least one 3, one 5, and one 7 (and no other digits). However, note that the second program uses a complex method to generate the next candidate number.\n\n But note: if X is -1, then the second program will not enter the loop (because 357 > -1) and output 0.\n\n However, the first program might output a negative number (-1) and the second program must handle that.\n\n But let's look at the second program: \n   It starts with i=357 and then in the loop condition: while (i <= N). If N is negative, then 357 is not <= N -> loop skipped -> count=0.\n\n So the chain is:\n\n   Input: n, k, and then n integers -> First program -> X -> Second program -> Output: count.\n\n We must write a Fortran program that:\n\n   - Reads the input for the first program (n, k, and n integers).\n   - Computes X (the output of the first program).\n   - Then uses X as the input for the second program (which we call N in the second part).\n   - Then runs the second program's logic with input N (which is X) and outputs the count.\n\n Important: Only the first block (for the first program) reads, and only the last block (for the second program) writes.\n\n Steps for the second program in Fortran:\n\n   We note that the second program in Java does:\n\n        long i = 357;\n        int c = 0;\n        while (i <= N) {\n            // Check if the string representation of i contains '3','5','7' and only these? Actually, it checks that it contains each at least once? But note: it only checks for presence. The number might contain other digits? Actually, the generation method only uses digits 3,5,7. But wait, the generation method:\n\n            The generation method:\n                It starts with a string s of the current number.\n                Then it traverses from the least significant digit to the most:\n                    For each digit (from last to first):\n                        If we haven't done a flip (f=false) then:\n                            if digit is '3', change to '5' and set f=true.\n                            if digit is '5', change to '7' and set f=true.\n                            if digit is '7', change to '3' (and then we continue without setting f? meaning the next digit will be processed in the same way? because f remains false) -> this is a carry-over.\n\n                If we never set f, then we append a '3' at the end (meaning we increased the digit length).\n\n            So the generated numbers are composed only of digits 3,5,7.\n\n            However, the condition in the count is: if (s contains '3' and contains '5' and contains '7') then count.\n\n            So we are only counting numbers that have at least one 3, one 5, and one 7.\n\n   But note: the generation method does not generate all numbers in order? Actually, it generates the next number in the sequence of numbers that are composed of 3,5,7? But it does so in increasing order? And the condition is that we are generating the next number that is composed only of 3,5,7? Yes, but note: the generation method is a base-3-like increment with the digits 3,5,7.\n\n   However, we must note: the second program in Java uses a while loop that starts at 357 and then generates the next candidate until exceeding N.\n\n   We can do the same in Fortran, but note that the Java program uses long. In Fortran we can use integer(kind=8) for large integers? But the input N (which is the output of the first program) is at most n (which is at most 10^5 in the first program? actually the first program reads n, which is the first integer). However, the second program uses long and the numbers can be large? But note: the first program outputs either a number between 0 and n-1 (which is at most 10^5) or -1. So the N for the second program is at most 10^5? Then the while loop in the second program would run at most about (numbers of 357 numbers <= 10^5). The numbers are 3-digit, 4-digit, ... but note 10^5 is 6 digits. The total count of such numbers is not too big (each digit has 3 possibilities, so 3^d for d-digit numbers, but we require at least one of each. The total for d digits is 3^d - 3*2^d + 3, but we don't need to worry because 10^5 is about 100000, and the largest number we generate is 357, then 375, ... up to 777777? But wait, the next number after 777 would be 3333? Actually, the generation method:\n\n        Example: \n          357 -> next: \n            s = \"357\"\n            reverse: 753\n            traverse: \n                first digit (from right) is 7 -> becomes 3? and then we don't set f -> so we continue to the next (more significant) digit? \n                then 5 -> becomes 7 and set f=true -> then the rest are appended as is? but we break? Actually, the rest are appended without change? but we break the flipping.\n\n            Actually, the algorithm: \n                We have a string s, and we create a new string by processing from least significant to most:\n                j from 0 to len-1 (but we are going from last char to first? because j: s.length()-1-j).\n\n            Actually, the loop: for j in [0, s.length()-1]:\n                char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j)   -> so j=0 is the last char, j=1 is the second last, etc.\n\n            We have a flag f (initially false). For each digit:\n                if f is true: we just append the digit as is (from the original string? but note we are building a new string for the next number? Actually, we are building the next number in reverse order? Then we reverse it at the end.\n\n            Without f: \n                if a is '3', we change to '5' and set f=true -> then the rest of the digits are taken as is? but note: the rest of the digits are the more significant ones? and we haven't processed them? Actually, we are processing from least significant to most. So we have already processed the less significant digits? and now we are building the new string from the least significant to the most? Then we reverse.\n\n            Actually, let's take 357:\n                j=0: a = '7' -> change to '3'? and we don't set f -> so we write '3' and then move to next (more significant? but wait, we are going from the last digit to the first? so next is the middle digit: 5).\n                j=1: a = '5' -> change to '7' and set f=true -> so we write '7'\n                j=2: a = '3' -> now f is true so we just write '3'\n                Then we have the new string (so far) as \"377\"? and then we reverse? -> \"773\". But wait, that's not 375.\n\n            Correction: the algorithm in the Java code:\n\n                It builds a string `sb` by processing the digits from least significant (last) to most significant (first). Then after the loop, if we never flipped (f remains false) we append a '3'. Then we reverse the entire `sb` to get the next number.\n\n            Let me step through 357:\n\n                s = \"357\"\n                j=0: last char is '7'. Since f is false, we change '7' to '3' and we do not set f? because we only set f when we change to a higher digit? Actually, changing from 7 to 3 is a reset and we don't set f (meaning we carry over to the next digit). So we write '3'. Now f remains false.\n                j=1: next digit is '5'. Since f is false, we change '5' to '7' and set f=true. Then we break the flipping for the rest? and then we write the rest as is? Actually, the rest of the digits (the first digit) will be written without change because f is now true.\n                j=2: now the digit is '3', and since f is true, we just write '3'. \n                Then the string `sb` is built as: first we wrote the last digit (became '3'), then the middle (became '7'), then the first (became '3') -> so the string is \"373\" (but we built it in reverse order? actually we are building the new number from least significant to most? so the first digit we write becomes the least significant? Then we reverse the entire string to get the most significant first? \n\n                So the built string is \"373\" -> then we reverse to \"373\". But the next number after 357 should be 375? \n\n            Actually, the example in the problem? The problem is from atcoder ABC114 C. The intended next number after 357 is 375? But the algorithm produces 373? \n\n            Let me check: the problem says \"count numbers that are composed of 3,5,7 and have each at least one\". The numbers are generated in increasing order? Then 357, 375, 537, 573, 735, 753, 3333, ...? \n\n            How does the algorithm generate after 357? \n                It does:\n                    s = \"357\"\n                    j=0: last digit is '7' -> becomes '3' (and no flip flag set) -> then j=1: middle digit '5' -> becomes '7' and set flip -> then the first digit '3' is just appended -> so we have the new number as 373? \n\n            But 373 is not in the sequence? because it has two 3's and one 7? and no 5? and it is 373 which is less than 375? \n\n            Actually, the algorithm is designed to generate the next number in the set of numbers that use only the digits 3,5,7? It is an increment in base 3 with digits 3,5,7? \n\n            However, 357 -> 373 is correct? because 357+1? but 357+1=358 -> then the algorithm is not adding one? It is doing a base-3 increment? \n\n            Actually, the algorithm:\n\n                It is treating the number as a base-3 number with digits 3,5,7 representing 0,1,2? But no, because 3 is the smallest, then 5, then 7.\n\n            How it works:\n\n                Start from the least significant digit:\n                    If the digit is 3, then we can increment it to 5? but it sets to 5 and stops? \n                    If the digit is 5, then set to 7 and stop?\n                    If the digit is 7, then set to 3 and carry over to the next digit.\n\n            So 357: \n                last digit is 7 -> set to 3 and carry (so f remains false) -> then the next digit (5) becomes 7 and we set f=true (meaning we don't carry) -> then the rest (3) remains 3? -> so we get 373.\n\n            Then 373: \n                last digit 3 -> becomes 5 -> and set f=true -> so the number becomes 375? \n\n            So the algorithm is: \n                357 -> 373 -> 375 -> 377 -> 533? \n\n            But 357, then 373, then 375? \n\n            However, the condition in the counting is that the number must contain 3,5,7. So 373 doesn't contain 5? so it is skipped? \n\n            But the Java program does: \n                if (s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\")) then c++.\n\n            So 357: \"357\" -> has all -> count=1.\n            Then next: 373: \"373\" -> has 3 and 7, but no 5 -> skip.\n\n            Then 375: \"375\" -> has 3,7,5 -> count=2.\n\n            So the algorithm generates every number that uses only 3,5,7 (in base-3-like increment) and then checks if it has all three.\n\n            We can do the same in Fortran.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k and then n integers.\n\n   Step 2: Compute the trailing consecutive count (c) and then:\n        if (c + k > n) then\n            X = n - c\n        else\n            X = -1\n        end if\n\n   Step 3: Set N = X.\n\n   Step 4: \n        Initialize:\n            integer(kind=8) :: i = 357\n            integer :: count_357 = 0\n\n        If (N < 357) then the loop won't run? but note: if N is -1, then we skip.\n\n        While (i <= N) do:\n            Convert i to a string and check if the string contains '3', '5', and '7'. \n            If it does, then increment count_357.\n\n            Then generate the next candidate:\n                We'll represent the current number as a string (in normal order, most significant first). Then we traverse the string from the last character to the first.\n\n                We'll build the next number in reverse order (so we start from the least significant digit). We'll use a flag `flipped` (logical) initially .false.\n\n                For each digit in reverse order (from last to first):\n                    if (flipped) then\n                         just take the current digit and add it to the new string (which we are building in reverse? actually we are building the next number from least significant to most? so we are going to reverse the entire new string at the end? as in the Java code: they reverse the string builder and then parse it?).\n\n                    else\n                         if the digit is '3', then we set this digit to '5' and set flipped = .true.\n                         else if the digit is '5', then set to '7' and set flipped = .true.\n                         else if the digit is '7', then set to '3' and leave flipped as .false. (meaning we carry over to the next digit)\n\n                After the loop, if we never flipped (i.e., flipped is still .false.) then we append a '3' at the end? but note: we are building the string in reverse order? Actually, in the Java code, they are building the new string by appending the new digit for the current position (which is the least significant so far) and then they reverse the entire string to get the next number (most significant first). \n\n                In Fortran, we can build a character array for the new number? or we can build a string by appending to the right? but note: we are processing from the last digit to the first, so we are building the new number from the least significant digit to the most? Then we need to reverse the string to get the normal representation? Then we convert to integer.\n\n        Then set i to the next candidate.\n\n   Step 5: Output count_357.\n\n However, note: the Java program appends a '3' at the end if there was a carry over the entire number? For example, 777 becomes 7773? Actually, no: \n\n        For 777: \n            Start with s = \"777\"\n            Process the last digit: 7 -> becomes 3, flipped remains false -> then the next (middle): 7-> becomes 3, flipped remains false -> then the first: 7-> becomes 3, flipped remains false. Then after the loop, since flipped is false, we append a '3'. Then the new string is \"333\" (from the loop) and then we append '3'? Then we reverse? \n\n            How did they build? \n                They built the new string by appending the new digit for each position? So the initial new string is built as:\n                    last digit: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                    middle: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                    first: 7 becomes 3 -> append '3'\n                Then the string is \"333\", then we append '3' -> becomes \"3333\", then reverse -> \"3333\"\n\n            So the next number is 3333.\n\n        So in Fortran, we can do:\n\n            We have a string `s` representing the current number (as a string of digits, most significant first).\n            We'll create a new string `next_str` that is initially empty.\n\n            Set flipped = .false.\n            Do j = len(s) down to 1:\n                current_char = s(j:j)\n                if (flipped) then\n                    next_str = trim(next_str) // current_char   ! but we are building from the least significant? so we are appending to the right? Actually, we want to build the new number in reverse order? Then we are going to reverse the entire next_str at the end? Actually, no: the Java code builds the new string in the order of the digits from least significant to most? and then reverses to get the most significant first.\n\n            But note: the Java code:\n\n                for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n                    char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j);   // so j=0 -> last char, j=1 -> second last, etc.\n                    if (f) {\n                        sb.append(a);   // so we are appending the current digit (which is the j-th from the end) to the string builder? so the string builder is building the new number from the least significant digit to the most? Then we reverse the entire string builder to get the normal order? \n\n                Example: for 357 (s=\"357\"):\n                    j=0: a = '7' -> becomes '3' -> then we append '3' -> sb becomes \"3\"\n                    j=1: a = '5' -> becomes '7' -> append '7' -> sb becomes \"37\"\n                    j=2: a = '3' -> append '3' -> sb becomes \"373\"\n                    Then we reverse -> \"373\"\n\n            So in Fortran, we can build the string in the same way: we traverse the original string from last character to first, and for each character we append the new digit to a temporary string? Then we reverse the temporary string? \n\n            Alternatively, we can build the new string by:\n\n                next_str = ''   ! we'll build the next number in reverse order (least significant first)\n                flipped = .false.\n                do i = len(s), 1, -1\n                    c = s(i:i)\n                    if (flipped) then\n                        next_str = next_str // c   ! but note: we are building from the last digit to the first? Actually, we are traversing the original string from last to first, and we are appending the new digit to the end of next_str? Then we don't need to reverse? because the next_str will be the original order? \n\n                But wait: the Java code builds the string in the order of the digits from the last (which becomes the first in the new string in reverse order) to the first (which becomes the last). Then they reverse the entire string to get the normal order.\n\n            Actually, the Java code:\n\n                They have a StringBuilder `sb` that they append each new digit (for the current position) and then they reverse the entire string to get the next number in normal order.\n\n            So in Fortran, we can:\n\n                next_str = ''   ! we are going to build the next number in reverse order (so the first digit we process becomes the least significant in the next number? but then we reverse to get the most significant first).\n\n                do j = 1, len(s)   ! but we want from the last character to the first? so j from len(s) down to 1? \n                    c = s(j:j)   ! but if we do j from len(s) down to 1, then we get the last character first? and then we append that to next_str? Then the next_str has the last character of the original as the first character? and the first character of the original as the last? Then when we reverse next_str, we get the original order? \n\n                Actually, we don't want that. We want to process the last character first? and then the second last? and so on? and then we reverse the entire next_str? \n\n                Example: \"357\" -> we want to process first the last char '7', then the middle '5', then the first '3'. We build next_str by appending the new digit for '7', then the new digit for '5', then the new digit for '3'. So next_str is built as: \n                    first we get the new digit for the last char: '3' -> next_str = \"3\"\n                    then the new digit for the middle: '7' -> next_str = \"37\"\n                    then the new digit for the first: '3' -> next_str = \"373\"\n                Then we reverse next_str -> \"373\"\n\n            But note: the original string was \"357\" and the next number is 373? and we built \"373\" in the order of the original digits? and then reversed? Actually, we built the next_str in the order of the original digits (from last to first) and then reversed to get the normal order? \n\n            Actually, we built the next_str in the order of the original digits (from last to first) without changing the order? Then we reverse to get the normal order? \n\n            So the steps:\n\n                Let s = \"357\"\n                We want to build a string for the next number: \n                    We start with the last digit: we change '7' to '3', then the next (middle) to '7', then the first to '3'. Then we have built the string \"373\" in the order: last digit then middle then first? which is the reverse of the normal order? Then we reverse it to get the normal order: \"373\" -> becomes \"373\"? \n\n            Actually, we built the string in the order of the original digits (from last to first) and then we reverse to get the normal order? But note: the original number was \"357\" (first digit: '3', then '5', then '7'). We processed the last digit first? and built a string \"3\" then \"7\" then \"3\" -> \"373\". Then we reverse to get \"373\", which is the same? \n\n            Why reverse then? Actually, the Java code reverses the entire string builder? \n\n            Example: \n                They have a StringBuilder `sb` that after the loop is \"373\", then they do `sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb)` and then `sb2.reverse()` -> which would reverse \"373\" to \"373\"? because it is a palindrome? \n\n            Actually, \"373\" reversed is \"373\". \n\n            But try with \"357\": \n                The Java code: \n                    They build the string builder as: \n                         j=0: append the new digit for the last char: '3' -> sb = \"3\"\n                         j=1: append the new digit for the middle: '7' -> sb = \"37\"\n                         j=2: append the new digit for the first: '3' -> sb = \"373\"\n                    Then they create a new StringBuffer(sb) -> \"373\", then reverse -> \"373\"\n\n            So it is the same? \n\n            Therefore, we don't need to reverse? because we built the string in the order of the original digits (from last to first) and that is the reverse of the normal order? Actually, no: the next number 373 is the same in both orders? \n\n            But consider a non-palindrome: 375 -> \n                s = \"375\"\n                Process the last digit: '5' -> becomes '7' (and set flipped=true) -> then the rest (without change because flipped is true) -> the next digit is '7' -> then the first digit is '3'. \n                So we build: \n                    j=0: last digit '5' -> becomes '7' -> append -> \"7\"\n                    j=1: next digit is '7', but flipped is true -> so we append the original '7' -> \"77\"\n                    j=2: next digit is '3', flipped true -> append '3' -> \"773\"\n                Then we reverse \"773\" -> \"377\"\n\n            But 375 -> the next number should be 377? \n\n            However, the algorithm: \n                375: \n                  j=0: last digit is 5 -> becomes 7 (set flipped=true) -> then the rest are taken as is? so the next number is 377? \n\n            Then 377: \n                j=0: last digit is 7 -> becomes 3 (and flipped remains false) -> then j=1: the middle digit is 7 -> becomes 3 (and flipped remains false) -> then j=2: the first digit is 3 -> becomes 5 (and set flipped=true) -> so we build: \n                    j=0: '3'\n                    j=1: '3'\n                    j=2: '5' -> so the string is \"533\", then reverse to \"335\"? -> wait, no: the string we built is \"533\" (in the order: last digit then middle then first) and then we reverse to get \"335\"? \n\n            Actually, the Java code:\n\n                They have a StringBuilder `sb` that after the loop is \"533\". Then they reverse -> \"335\". \n\n            Then the next number is 335? \n\n            But 335 is less than 377? and we are generating in increasing order? \n\n            Actually, the algorithm is generating in lex order? \n\n            However, note: the algorithm is generating the next number in the set of numbers that are composed of 3,5,7? It is like a base-3 number? \n\n            The next number after 377 should be 3333? because 377 is 777 in base 3? and then we carry over to a new digit? But the Java code does: after the loop, if flipped is false (which it is because we had two carries and then the first digit was 3 -> we set it to 5 and set flipped to true? so we didn't do the append at the end?).\n\n            Actually, after processing the entire string, if flipped is false (meaning we had a carry out of the most significant digit) then we append a '3'. \n\n            In 377: \n                flipped was set to true at the first digit? so we don't append. \n\n            Then the next number is 533? but then reversed to 335? That is not correct? because 335 is less than 377? \n\n            Let me check the Java code again: \n\n                They build the string from the last digit to the first? and then they reverse? \n\n                For 377: \n                    j=0: last digit: 7 -> becomes 3 -> flipped=false -> append '3'\n                    j=1: middle: 7 -> becomes 3 -> flipped=false -> append '3'\n                    j=2: first: 3 -> becomes 5 -> flipped=true -> append '5'\n                    Then the string builder is \"335\", then reverse -> \"533\" -> which is 533? which is greater than 377? \n\n            So the next number is 533? \n\n            Then the sequence: 357, 373, 375, 377, 533, 537, ... \n\n            So 533 is the next after 377? \n\n            Therefore, we must build the string in the order of the digits from last to first (so we get the reverse of the next number) and then reverse the entire string to get the next number? \n\n            In Fortran, we can:\n\n                Let s = the current number as a string (most significant first)\n                next_str = ''   ! we'll build the next number in reverse order (least significant digit first in the string we build? but then we reverse to get the most significant first)\n\n                flipped = .false.\n                do j = len(s), 1, -1\n                    c = s(j:j)\n                    if (flipped) then\n                        next_str = next_str // c   ! we are appending the current digit (unchanged) to next_str? but note: we are building from the last digit to the first? and then we will reverse the entire next_str? \n                    else\n                        if (c == '3') then\n                            next_str = next_str // '5'\n                            flipped = .true.\n                        else if (c == '5') then\n                            next_str = next_str // '7'\n                            flipped = .true.\n                        else if (c == '7') then\n                            next_str = next_str // '3'\n                            flipped = .false.   ! meaning we carry over\n                        end if\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                if (.not. flipped) then\n                    next_str = next_str // '3'\n                end if\n\n                Then we reverse next_str? \n\n            How to reverse a string in Fortran? We can do:\n\n                next_str_normal = next_str   ! but then we reverse the order of the characters?\n                We can write a function to reverse.\n\n            Alternatively, we can build the next_str in the correct order without reversing? \n\n            How? We can build the next_str by prepending the digits? Then we don't need to reverse. But Fortran doesn't have efficient prepend? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                next_str = '' \n                flipped = .false.\n                do j = len(s), 1, -1\n                    ... as above, but we want to build the next_str in the normal order? Then we would have to prepend the new digit? \n\n                Instead, we can build the string in the order of the original digits (from last to first) and then reverse? \n\n            Let me write a helper function to reverse a string.\n\n        However, note: the Java code does reverse the string builder. So we do the same.\n\n   Implementation of reverse:\n\n        function reverse_string(s) result(res)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n            character(len=len(s)) :: res\n            integer :: i, n\n            n = len(s)\n            do i = 1, n\n                res(i:i) = s(n-i+1:n-i+1)\n            end do\n        end function\n\n   Then:\n\n        next_str = reverse_string(next_str)\n\n   Then convert next_str to an integer.\n\n   But note: the Java code does:\n\n        i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\n        Actually, they have a StringBuilder `sb` that they built in the order: last digit first? and then they create a StringBuffer from it and reverse? \n\n        But note: the StringBuffer.reverse() reverses the entire string? \n\n        So the entire process:\n\n            They built a string `sb` that is in the order of the digits from the last digit of the original to the first? and then they reverse that string to get the next number? \n\n            Example: 357 -> \n                built: \n                    j=0: last digit becomes '3' -> sb=\"3\"\n                    j=1: middle becomes '7' -> sb=\"37\"\n                    j=2: first becomes '3' -> sb=\"373\"\n                Then they reverse sb -> \"373\"\n\n            So we can avoid the reverse by building the string in the normal order? \n\n            How? We can process the digits from the first to the last? but that would be the reverse? Actually, we want the next number to be built from the most significant to the least? \n\n            Alternatively, we can build the string in the order of the original digits (from first to last) but then we have to process the digits from the last to the first? \n\n            Actually, the algorithm is defined on the digits in little-endian order? \n\n        Since the problem is small (the numbers are at most 100000? so the string length is at most 6), we can do the reverse.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        We'll represent the current number as a string (normal order: most significant first) -> call it s.\n\n        We'll create a temporary string `temp` that will be built in the order: for each digit from last to first, we compute the new digit and append it to `temp`? Then we reverse `temp` to get the next number in normal order.\n\n        Then we convert that string to an integer.\n\n   But note: the next number might have an extra digit? (if we appended a '3' at the end) so the length might be increased.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        character(len=20) :: temp   ! we'll build the next number in reverse order (so the first character we put is the last digit of the next number? and then we reverse to get the entire next number in normal order)\n\n        Actually, we don't need to reverse? because the next number we built is in the order of the original digits? and then we reverse? \n\n        Example: 357 -> we built \"373\", then reverse to \"373\" -> then we convert to integer 373.\n\n        But 377 -> we built \"533\" (by: \n            last digit: 7->3 -> append '3'\n            middle: 7->3 -> append '3'\n            first: 3->5 -> append '5'\n            so temp = \"335\", then reverse to \"533\" -> which is 533.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            temp = ''   ! initialize as empty\n            flipped = .false.\n            do j = len(s), 1, -1   ! j from the last character down to 1\n                c = s(j:j)\n                if (flipped) then\n                    temp = temp // c   ! we are building the next number in the order: last digit, then middle, then first? then we reverse to get the normal order? \n                else\n                    if (c == '3') then\n                        temp = temp // '5'\n                        flipped = .true.\n                    else if (c == '5') then\n                        temp = temp // '7'\n                        flipped = .true.\n                    else if (c == '7') then\n                        temp = temp // '3'\n                        flipped = .false.\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (.not. flipped) then\n                temp = temp // '3'\n            end if\n\n            Then we reverse temp -> call it next_str.\n\n            Then i = the integer value of next_str.\n\n   But note: the original Java code does not have the reverse at the end? because they built the string in the same way and then reversed? \n\n        Actually, they did:\n\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n            for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n                char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j);   // so the digit we are processing is the j-th from the end? \n                if (f) {\n                    sb.append(a);\n                } else {\n                    // ... change the digit and set f if needed\n                }\n            }\n            if (!f) sb.append(3);\n            StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n            i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\n        They built the string by appending the digits in the order of the original digits from the last to the first? then they reversed the entire string to get the normal order? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            We build a string `temp` by appending the new digit for the last digit, then the new digit for the second last, ... then the new digit for the first? Then we reverse `temp` to get the next number? \n\n        But note: we already processed the digits from last to first? and then we reverse? \n\n        Actually, the Java code built the string in the order: \n            first digit appended: the last digit of the original? then the second last? then the first? \n            Then they reversed to get: first digit of the original becomes the last? and the last digit of the original becomes the first? which is the normal order? \n\n        Example: \"357\" (original) -> \n            j=0: last digit (7) -> becomes 3 -> appended -> \"3\"\n            j=1: middle (5) -> becomes 7 -> appended -> \"37\"\n            j=2: first (3) -> becomes 3 (because flipped is true? but wait: after the first digit we set flipped to true? no, in 357: \n                j=0: last digit (7) -> becomes 3 -> flipped=false -> so we continue -> \n                j=1: middle (5) -> becomes 7 -> flipped=true -> \n                j=2: first (3) -> since flipped=true, we append the original '3' -> \"373\"\n            Then reverse -> \"373\"\n\n        So in Fortran, we can do the same: \n\n            temp = ''   ! we build the next number in the order: last digit first, then middle, then first? then we reverse to get the normal order.\n\n            flipped = .false.\n            do j = 1, len(s)   ! j from 1 to len(s) meaning from first to last? but we want last to first? \n\n            Actually, we need to traverse the original string from the last character to the first? We can do:\n\n                do j = len(s), 1, -1   ! j from len(s) down to 1.\n\n            Then we are processing the last character first? and then we append that to temp? so the first character in temp is the new last digit? and the last character in temp is the new first digit? Then we reverse temp to get the normal order? \n\n            Example: 357: \n                j=3: first character? no, j from 3 down to 1: \n                    j=3: the third character? but the string \"357\": \n                        s(3:3) is '7' -> becomes '3' -> append to temp: \"3\"\n                    j=2: s(2:2)='5' -> becomes '7' -> append to temp: \"37\"\n                    j=1: s(1:1)='3' -> since flipped is true? actually, after j=2 we set flipped=true? so we append the original '3' -> temp=\"373\"\n                Then we reverse temp: \"373\" -> \"373\"\n\n            So that matches.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            temp = ''\n            flipped = .false.\n            do j = len(s), 1, -1\n                c = s(j:j)\n                if (flipped) then\n                    temp = temp // c\n                else\n                    if (c == '3') then\n                        temp = temp // '5'\n                        flipped = .true.\n                    else if (c == '5') then\n                        temp = temp // '7'\n                        flipped = .true.\n                    else if (c == '7') then\n                        temp = temp // '3'\n                        flipped = .false.\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n\n            if (.not. flipped) then\n                temp = temp // '3'\n            end if\n\n            Then we reverse temp -> next_str = reverse(temp)\n\n            Then read next_str as an integer.\n\n   However, note: the Java code did the reverse? They built the string in the same way? and then reversed? \n\n   But we must note: the next_str might have more digits? so we need to use a big enough character variable? \n\n   We'll assume the numbers are not too big? the first program outputs at most 10^5? so the next_str has at most 6 digits? but if we get a carry over the entire number, we add one digit? so at most 7 digits? \n\n   We can use a character(len=20) for temp and next_str.\n\n   Then we convert next_str to an integer(kind=8) using internal read.\n\n   But note: the Java program uses long. In Fortran, we can use integer(kind=8) for i.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        Read n, k, then n integers.\n\n        Compute trailing consecutive count (c) and then X.\n\n        Then set N = X.\n\n        Then initialize:\n            i = 357 (as integer(kind=8))\n            count_357 = 0\n\n        If (N >= 357) then we start the loop? But note: if N is negative we skip.\n\n        While (i <= N) do:\n\n            Convert i to a string -> s\n\n            Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. We can do:\n\n                if (index(s,'3')>0 .and. index(s,'5')>0 .and. index(s,'7')>0) then\n                    count_357 = count_357 + 1\n                end if\n\n            Then generate the next candidate:\n\n                temp = ''   ! character(len=20) but we'll use a variable that we can extend? Actually, we can use a character variable and we'll build it by concatenation? \n\n                flipped = .false.\n\n                do j = len_trim(s), 1, -1   ! but note: s might have trailing spaces? we should use the actual length? Actually, when we convert i to a string, we should remove leading spaces? \n\n            How to convert integer to string without spaces? \n\n            We can use:\n\n                write(s, '(I0)') i   ! I0 format gives the integer without leading spaces? then s will be the string without spaces? and we can get the length by len_trim(s) or just use the whole string? \n\n            But note: the string might have leading spaces? I0 format in Fortran writes without leading spaces? but then the string variable we write to must be of fixed length? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                character(len=20) :: s_str\n                write(s_str, '(I0)') i   ! this will write the integer to s_str without leading spaces? and then we can use s_str and the actual length is len_trim(s_str)\n\n            Then:\n\n                do j = len_trim(s_str), 1, -1\n                    c = s_str(j:j)\n                    ... as above ...\n\n            Then after building temp, we reverse:\n\n                next_str = reverse_string(temp)   ! we write a helper function for reverse\n\n            Then convert next_str to an integer(kind=8) by:\n\n                read(next_str, *) i\n\n        End while\n\n        Then output count_357.\n\n   But note: if the first program outputs -1, then N=-1, and the while loop condition: i=357 <= -1 is false -> count_357=0 -> output 0.\n\n   This matches the chain.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We'll write a helper function for reversing a string.\n\n   However, note: the entire program must be in one file? and we are not allowed to use modules? We can use internal functions.\n\n   We'll put the reverse function at the end.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\", so we only read at the beginning and write at the end.\n\n   We'll write the Fortran program.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n\n        !

But note: the Java program counts consecutive same numbers at the end? \n        ! The above counts the consecutive same numbers from the beginning? \n\n        ! Correction: the Java program:\n        !   for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        !       int a = in.nextInt();\n        !       if (a == l) c += 1;\n        !       else c = 1;\n        !       l = a;\n        !   }\n        ! So it counts the consecutive same numbers at the end? Actually, it counts the consecutive same numbers for the entire sequence? but the last value of c is the consecutive count of the last number? \n\n        ! Example: [1,2,2,3,3,3] -> \n        !   i0: a=1 -> c=1 (since l=0 initially? but l=0 and a=1 -> else: c=1) -> then l=1\n        !   i1: a=2 -> not equal to 1 -> c=1, l=2\n        !   i2: a=2 -> equal to 2 -> c=2, l=2\n        !   i3: a=3 -> not equal to 2 -> c=1, l=3\n        !   i4: a=3 -> equal to 3 -> c=2, l=3\n        !   i5: a=3 -> equal to 3 -> c=3, l=3\n        ! So at the end, c=3.\n\n        ! Therefore, we can do:\n\n        !   last = arr(1)\n        !   c_count = 1\n        !   do i_int = 2, n\n        !       if (arr(i_int) == last) then\n        !           c_count = c_count + 1\n        !       else\n        !           c_count = 1\n        !       end if\n        !       last = arr(i_int)\n        !   end do\n\n        ! This gives the consecutive count of the last number? \n\n        ! Then:\n        if (c_count + k > n) then\n            X = n - c_count\n        else\n            X = -1\n        end if\n\n        ! Now, set N_long for the second program\n        N_long = X   ! convert to kind=8? but X is integer, and we can assign to integer(kind=8)\n\n        !

We are interested in the actual digits. We can get the length by len_trim(s_str)\n            !

We use trim(s_str) to remove trailing spaces? but when we write with I0, the string has no leading spaces? and the trailing part is spaces? so we trim to get the actual digits? \n\n   But when we build the next candidate, we are using the trimmed string? \n\n   Also, in the loop we do j from the last non-space character down to the first? \n\n   But note: the variable s_str is of length 20? and we write an integer that might be 3 digits? then the rest are spaces? so we must use the trimmed length? \n\n   We did: length = len_trim(s_str) -> that's the actual length.\n\n   Then we do j from length down to 1? \n\n   Then we build temp? and then we reverse the entire temp? \n\n   But note: the length of temp is the same as the length of s_str? or more? because we might append a '3' at the end? \n\n   The function reverse_string requires the length of the string? we are passing trim(temp) to reverse_string? but the function reverse_string has:\n\n        character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n        then res = character(len=len(s)) :: res\n\n   So if we pass trim(temp) (which is of length L), then the result is of length L? \n\n   Then we read next_str (which is of length L) and convert to integer? \n\n   This should be okay.\n\n   But note: the concatenation: \n\n        temp = trim(temp) // c\n\n   This might cause truncation if the length of temp is fixed? We declared temp as character(len=20). We are building a string that might be up to 20 characters? \n\n   But the input to the second program (N_long) is at most 10^5? so the numbers we generate are at most 6 digits? and then we might add one digit? so 7 digits? and 20 is enough.\n\n   However, we are building temp by concatenation? and we declared temp as character(len=20). Then if we do:\n\n        temp = trim(temp) // '3'\n\n   and the length of trim(temp) is 7? then the result is 8 characters? but temp is only 20? so it will be truncated? \n\n   We need to make temp big enough? and then we use trim to remove trailing spaces? but the concatenation operator // will pad with spaces to the declared length? \n\n   Actually, in Fortran, if we do:\n\n        character(len=20) :: temp = ''   ! initially 20 spaces? then we set to ''? which is one space? \n\n   Actually, we set temp = '' -> this sets the entire string to blanks? \n\n   Then we do:\n\n        temp = trim(temp) // '3'\n\n   This sets temp to '3' followed by 19 spaces? but then when we do the next concatenation? \n\n   We can avoid by using a temporary variable for building? or we can use a different approach? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a character variable with a large length? and then we trim it? \n\n   But note: the maximum length we need is the length of the current number plus one? so 20 is enough? because the current number is at most 6 digits? and we add one digit? so 7? and 20>7.\n\n   When we do:\n\n        temp = trim(temp) // c\n\n   This will assign a string of length (len_trim(temp)+1) to temp? and then pad with spaces to 20? \n\n   Then when we pass to reverse_string(trim(temp))? we get the non-space part? \n\n   This should work.\n\n   Let's test with 357:\n\n        s_str = \"357\"   (with trailing spaces? but we use len_trim=3)\n\n        temp = '' (which is 20 spaces? then trim(temp) is ''? so length 0? then we do:\n\n        j=3: c='7' -> becomes '3', flipped=.false. -> then temp = '' // '3' -> becomes '3' (and 19 spaces) -> then trim(temp) is '3'\n\n        j=2: c='5' -> becomes '7', flipped=.true. -> then temp = trim(temp) // '7' -> '3' // '7' -> '37' (and 18 spaces)\n\n        j=1: c='3' -> since flipped=true, we do temp = trim(temp) // '3' -> '37' // '3' -> '373' (and 17 spaces)\n\n        Then after the loop: flipped is true? so we don't append.\n\n        Then next_str = reverse_string(trim(temp)) = reverse_string('373') -> '373'\n\n        Then we read 373 into i_long.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: we must be cautious with the fixed-length strings? but 20 is enough.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   We'll write the entire Fortran program.\n\n   Important: The first program reads n integers? we are reading into an array? but the Java program does not store the entire array? it only uses the last value? \n\n   Actually, we can avoid storing the entire array? we only need the last consecutive count? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        read(*,*) n, k\n        last = -1   ! or a value that won't appear? \n        c_count = 0\n        do i_int = 1, n\n            read(*,*) a\n            if (a == last) then\n                c_count = c_count + 1\n            else\n                c_count = 1\n            end if\n            last = a\n        end do\n\n   This saves memory.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Final code structure:\n\n        program combined\n        implicit none\n        !

Actually, the do while loop condition already checks i_long<=N_long? and if N_long<357, the condition fails? so we don't need the outer if? \n\n   We can remove the outer if.\n\n   But note: if N_long is negative (like -1) then the condition 357<=-1 is false? so the loop is skipped? \n\n   So we can remove the outer if.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   We'll test with small input? but the problem requires a single program.\n\n   This should be the complete Fortran program.\n\n   Note: the variable `temp` is declared as character(len=20). The initial assignment `temp = ''` sets the entire string to blanks? then we do `trim(temp)` which is an empty string? and then we append? \n\n   This should work.\n\n   We'll write the code.\n\n   Note: the reverse_string function: we pass a string of length L, and we return a string of the same length? which is the reverse.\n\n   But note: when we pass `trim(temp)`, we get a string without trailing spaces? and then we reverse? \n\n   Example: temp = '373   ' (with 17 spaces) -> trim(temp) = '373' (length 3) -> then reverse_string returns '373'? \n\n   Actually, no: the function reverse_string returns a string of the same length as the input? so for '373' (len=3) it returns '373'? \n\n   But 373 reversed is 373? \n\n   For '335' (from 377) -> we built temp = '533'? then we reverse to '335'? but wait, we built temp as:\n\n        For 377: \n            j=3: last digit: 7 -> becomes 3 -> append to temp: '3'\n            j=2: 7 -> becomes 3 -> append: '33'\n            j=1: 3 -> becomes 5 -> append: '335'\n            Then we reverse: '533'\n\n   But the next number is 533? \n\n   So we built temp as the reverse of the next number? then we reverse again to get the next number? \n\n   Actually, we built temp in the order: last digit of the next number first? then the next? then the first digit of the next number last? so we have to reverse to get the next number? \n\n   Therefore, the function is correctly applied.\n\n   We'll output the code."
