So the second program would read a line with one token (that token is the single character). Then it would check each token:\n\n  token1 = the string of that character (say \"c\") -> not \"0\", so count=1 and then move to next token? There is no next token. So it would break the loop after processing the entire array? Then it prints 1? But note: the second program does not break until it finds the token \"0\". In the example, it never finds \"0\", so it counts all tokens. How many tokens? The entire line split by space. Since there are no spaces, there is exactly one token. Therefore, the second program would output 1. But that doesn't match the intended chain? Actually, the chain is:\n\n  Input to first program: a string (say \"a\")\n  First program: outputs the next character, which is 'b' (without newline) -> so the output is the single character 'b'\n\n  Then the second program reads a line: it gets the string \"b\" (without a newline, but the readLine will read until the newline? Actually, the first program doesn't output a newline, so the second program's readLine would block? Or would it see the end of the stream? This is ambiguous. However, in practice, when chaining programs, the output of the first is piped to the second. The first program writes one byte (the character) and then exits. The second program's readLine would read until it gets a newline or EOF. Since there's no newline, it would read the one byte and then the EOF?",

So if the input is empty, then the first character is space. Then we output the next character after space, which is '!'. But in Java, reading an empty line: `s = r.readLine()` returns an empty string. Then `s.charAt(0)` throws an exception. So the Fortran program should not read empty lines? The problem does not specify. We assume the input is non-empty. Alternatively, we can handle empty input? The problem says the same behavior. The original Java program throws an exception on empty input. Our Fortran program would not. But we can check the length. if (len_trim(line) == 0) then\n      ... handle error? but the problem does not specify. We'll assume non-empty. So we'll leave as is.

The second program reads a whole line and splits by space.\n\nSo the output of the first program is a single character (without a space) and then a newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not append a newline. So the output is just one character.\n\nBut then the second program reads a whole line. So if the first program outputs the character 'b' (which is 98+1 -> 99, so 'c') then the second program would read the string \"c\" (without a newline? but then the next read would be the next line?).\n\nHowever, note that the second program expects multiple tokens. But the first program only outputs one character and then exits. The second program then reads one token? and then breaks because it finds \"0\"? Actually, the second program breaks when it finds the token \"0\". But the token is \"c\", not \"0\". So the second program would count all tokens until it finds a \"0\", and if none is found, it counts all tokens? And then prints the total count?\n\nBut wait, the second program breaks at the token \"0\". So if the tokens are \"a b 0 c\", then it would break at the third token and output 3.\n\nBut the input to the second program is the output of the first: which is a single character without a space. So the second program would read a line with one token (that token is the single character). Then it would check each token:\n\n  token1 = the string of that character (say \"c\") -> not \"0\", so count=1 and then move to next token? There is no next token. So it would break the loop after processing the entire array? Then it prints 1? \n\nBut note: the second program does not break until it finds the token \"0\". In the example, it never finds \"0\", so it counts all tokens. How many tokens? The entire line split by space. Since there are no spaces, there is exactly one token.\n\nTherefore, the second program would output 1.\n\nBut that doesn't match the intended chain? Actually, the chain is:\n\n  Input to first program: a string (say \"a\")\n  First program: outputs the next character, which is 'b' (without newline) -> so the output is the single character 'b'\n\n  Then the second program reads a line: it gets the string \"b\" (without a newline, but the readLine will read until the newline? Actually, the first program doesn't output a newline, so the second program's readLine would block? Or would it see the end of the stream? \n\nThis is ambiguous. However, in practice, when chaining programs, the output of the first is piped to the second. The first program writes one byte (the character) and then exits. The second program's readLine would read until it gets a newline or EOF. Since there's no newline, it would read the one byte and then the EOF? Actually, readLine in Java returns a string without the newline, but if the end of the stream is reached, it returns the last line (without a newline). So the second program would read the string \"b\".\n\nTherefore, the second program would split the string \"b\" by space -> one token: [\"b\"]. Then it would count:\n\n  token1: \"b\" -> not \"0\", so count becomes 1, then there are no more tokens -> loop ends. Then it prints 1.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs a space? Actually, it doesn't: it outputs one character.\n\nSo the entire chain: \n  Input: a string S (for the first program)\n  Output of first: next character of the first character of S (without newline)\n  Then the second program: reads that one character as a line, splits by space (gives one token), and then counts 1 because it never finds \"0\".\n\nTherefore, the chain output is always 1.\n\nBut wait, that seems odd. Let me reexamine the problem: the two programs are independent and meant to be run in sequence. The second program is counting the tokens until it finds the token \"0\". However, the output of the first program is a single character (without a space) and without a newline? Then the second program reads one token and never finds \"0\", so it counts all tokens (which is 1) and outputs 1.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs a newline? The problem does not specify. The first program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not output a newline. So the output is just the one character.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain for any input to the first program will output 1.\n\nBut wait, the second program does not see a \"0\", so it counts the entire array? Actually, the second program:\n\n  String[] input_array = br.readLine().split(\" \");\n  Then it iterates for each string in the array:\n      result += 1   (so for the first token, result becomes 1)\n      if the token is \"0\", break -> then it breaks.\n\n  So if the token is \"0\", it breaks and prints 1 (because it has seen one token, which is \"0\"). Otherwise, it continues to the next token.\n\n  But if there is only one token and it is not \"0\", then after the first token the loop ends and it prints 1.\n\n  So regardless of the token, the second program will always output 1? Because the input from the first program is a single token (one character) and that token is never \"0\" (unless the first program outputs the character '0').\n\nWhen does the first program output '0'? \n  It outputs (char)(s.charAt(0) + 1). \n\n  So if the input to the first program is a string whose first character is the character before '0', which is '/'. The ASCII of '/' is 47, then 47+1=48 -> which is '0'. \n\n  Therefore, if the input to the first program is a string starting with '/', then the first program outputs '0'. Then the second program:\n\n      token = \"0\" -> so it breaks at the first token and outputs 1.\n\n  In any case, the output is always 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the first program outputs two characters? It doesn't: it outputs one.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain always outputs 1.\n\nBut this seems too trivial. Let me check the second program again: what if the input to the second program is a line with multiple tokens? But the first program only outputs one character. So the second program always gets one token.\n\nSo the chain is:\n\n  Input to first: a string (we only care about the first character)\n  Output of first: one character (the next character of the first character of input)\n  Output of second: 1\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should:\n\n  - Read a string (the entire first line, but we only need the first character)\n  - Compute the next character (but we don't actually need to use it for anything except to know that the second part always outputs 1)\n  - Then output 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the second program is counting until it finds \"0\", and if it finds \"0\" it breaks? But in our case, the input to the second program is one token. And if that token is \"0\", then it breaks and outputs 1. If it is not, then it still outputs 1 (the count of tokens). So always 1.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program can be:\n\n  program main\n      character(100) :: s  ! to read the input line\n      integer :: i\n      read(*,'(a)') s\n      ! We don't actually need to compute the next character for the output, because the final output is always 1.\n      write(*,*) 1\n  end program\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". The original chain does:\n\n  Step 1: reads a line and outputs the next character of the first character (without newline). \n  Step 2: reads that one character as a line and then outputs 1 (with newline, because `println`).\n\nSo the overall output is: (the next character) and then (the number 1 on a new line)? Actually, no: because the first program outputs without a newline, and the second program outputs the number 1 with a newline. So the overall output would be:\n\n  [first character + 1][without newline] then [1 followed by a newline].\n\nBut wait, when the first program writes its output, it is one byte. Then the second program runs and writes \"1\\n\", so the entire output would be two lines? Actually, no: the first program writes one byte (say 'b') and then the second program writes \"1\\n\", so the output would be:\n\n   b1\n   [newline]\n\nBut note: the first program writes one byte (no newline) and then the second program writes two bytes: '1' and a newline. So the output is:\n\n   b1\\n\n\nBut that is two bytes: 'b', '1', and then a newline? Actually, three bytes.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire chain on the same input should be the same.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\".\n\nSo in the Fortran program, we are not going to output the intermediate character. We are only going to output the final result, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should only output 1 (with a newline?).\n\nBut the original chain outputs the intermediate character and then the 1 and a newline. However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is:\n\n  Input: a string (say \"a\\n\")\n  Output: two things: the character 'b' (without newline) and then the integer 1 (with newline).\n\nBut if we skip the intermediate output, then the Fortran program would only output 1. That is not the same.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the same behavior\". But note that the intermediate output is used as input to the next. And the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we are not to do I/O in the middle.\n\nSo we are to simulate the chain without actually writing the intermediate output to the outside world. The final output should be the same as the chain's final output.\n\nThe chain's final output is the output of the second program: which is the integer 1 (with a newline). The intermediate output (the character) is not part of the final output of the chain? Actually, it is: the chain writes two things: the character and then the number 1 and a newline.\n\nBut that is two outputs: one from the first program and one from the second. The problem says: the entire sequence. The final Fortran program should produce the same output as the entire sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should output:\n\n   [character][without newline] and then [1 followed by newline]\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we cannot have two outputs. We must combine the entire chain and then output the same as the chain.\n\nThe chain writes:\n\n   [character] (from first program) and then [1\\n] (from second program)\n\nSo the total output is: the character and then the string \"1\\n\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must output:\n\n   the next character of the first input character (without a newline) and then the integer 1 with a newline.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program. And we are allowed only the last block to produce output. But the last block in the chain is the second program. However, the first program's output is part of the overall output.\n\nSo we must output both.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that in the Fortran code, we write the output only at the end. But we can write the entire output at the end: first the intermediate character and then the number and a newline.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  Step 1: read the input string (first line) and extract the first character, then compute the next character.\n  Step 2: we know the second part would output 1 (as an integer) and then a newline.\n\n  So we output: the next character (without newline) and then the integer 1 and a newline.\n\nBut wait: the second program in the chain does not know about the intermediate character? It reads the intermediate character as its input. But in our combined program, we are not going to actually write the intermediate character to the outside and then read it back? We are going to simulate the chain.\n\nSo the combined program:\n\n  Reads the input (a string, we only need the first character).\n  Computes the next character: let c = char(ichar(first_character) + 1)\n  Then, for the second part: we note that the second program would read a line that consists of the single character c (without any spaces and without a newline). Then the second program would split by space -> one token: the string of length 1 containing c.\n  Then the second program counts: \n      token1: if the token is \"0\", then output 1 and break. Otherwise, after processing the token, output 1.\n\n  So the second part always outputs 1.\n\n  Therefore, the entire output is: \n      write the character c (without newline) and then write the integer 1 (with newline).\n\nBut note: the second program outputs the integer 1 and then a newline. So the entire output is two lines? Actually, no: because the first part did not output a newline, the output is:\n\n      c1\\n\n\nwhich is two characters and then a newline? Actually, the integer 1 is written as the character '1'. So:\n\n      c (one character) and then the string \"1\\n\" (two characters).\n\nSo total: three characters.\n\nBut if the intermediate character is 'A', then the output would be:\n\n      A1\\n\n\nSo the Fortran program:\n\n   program main\n      character(len=100) :: line\n      character :: c\n      integer :: i\n\n      ! Read the first line of input\n      read(*, '(a)') line\n\n      ! Get the first character and compute the next character\n      c = char(ichar(line(1:1)) + 1\n\n      ! Now, we are going to output the entire output of the chain:\n      ! First: the character c without newline.\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c\n\n      ! Then the second program's output: the integer 1 and a newline.\n      write(*,*) '1'   ! But note: the second program outputs the integer 1 as a string? Actually, it uses `pw.println(result);` which writes the integer and then a newline.\n\n      ! However, in Fortran, if we write an integer, we get a string of digits. But the second program writes the integer 1 as the character '1' and then a newline.\n\n      ! Alternatively, we can write the string '1' and then a newline.\n      ! But note: the second program writes the integer 1, so it's the same as the character '1'.\n\n      ! But to be safe, we can write the integer as a string.\n\n      ! However, the problem says: the entire output of the chain is the character c and then the character '1' and a newline.\n\n      ! So we can do:\n      !   write(*, '(a)') '1'   -> this would write '1' and then a newline, but note that after the first write (without newline) the next write would append after the character? and then a newline.\n\n      ! Actually, we did:\n      !   write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c   --> outputs c without newline\n      !   write(*, *) '1'   --> this would output: space? and then '1' and then newline? because list-directed write.\n\n      ! We want exactly: c, then '1', then newline.\n\n      ! So we can do:\n      !   write(*, '(a, a)') c, '1'\n\n      ! But that would output two characters without space and without newline? and then at the end of the write, a newline? Actually, the format '(a,a)' does not include a newline? Then we need to add one.\n\n      ! Alternatively: \n      !   write(*, '(a, a, /)') c, '1'   -> but that would output two newlines.\n\n      ! Or: write(*, '(a, a)') c, '1'   -> this would output two characters and then a newline? because by default, each write statement ends with a newline? unless we use advance='no'. But we are not using advance='no' for the second write.\n\n      ! Actually, if we do two separate writes:\n\n      !   write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c\n      !   write(*, '(a)') '1'\n\n      ! This would output: c (no newline) and then the next write: '1' and then a newline. So the entire output: c1\\n.\n\n      ! That is exactly what we want.\n\n   end program\n\nBut wait: what if the input to the first program has more than one character? The first program only takes the first character. The rest is ignored. So we read the entire line, but we only use the first character.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program:\n\n  program main\n      character(100) :: line\n      character :: c\n      read(*, '(a)') line\n      c = char(ichar(line(1:1)) + 1\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c\n      write(*, '(a)') '1'\n  end program\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain outputs the integer 1 as a string? Actually, it prints an integer. The integer 1 is printed as the string \"1\". So we output the character '1' (not the integer 1 as a number with possible spaces).\n\nAlternatively, we could output the integer 1 using an integer format, but that would also be the character '1'.\n\nBut the above program outputs two characters: the next character and then the character '1', and then a newline. So the output is two characters and a newline.\n\nBut the chain outputs:\n\n   [next character] (one byte) and then the second program outputs the string \"1\\n\" (two bytes: '1' and '\\n'). So total three bytes.\n\nOur Fortran program: \n   write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c   -> one byte (if the character is one byte) and then \n   write(*, '(a)') '1'   -> writes two bytes: '1' and a newline.\n\nSo total three bytes.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is a multibyte character? The problem doesn't specify. The original Java program uses `char` which is 16 bits (Unicode). But the problem says the chain is run in sequence. We are to write a Fortran program that behaves identically.\n\nIn Fortran, characters are typically single byte? But we can use UTF-8? Actually, the problem does not specify the encoding. We'll assume the input and output are in the same encoding as the original.\n\nBut the problem says: \"behaves identically\". We are to read the first character of the input and then output the next character in the same encoding. \n\nIn Fortran, the `ichar` function returns the integer value of the character in the default character set. The `char` function returns the character for that integer. This is consistent with the Java program which uses `char` (which is a 16-bit Unicode character). However, in practice, if the input is ASCII, then it's one byte. For non-ASCII, it might be more complex.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the encoding. We'll assume the system's default character set.\n\nTherefore, the above program is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if the first character of the input is the last character in the character set? Then adding 1 might wrap? The Java program does: (s.charAt(0) + 1) and then casts to char? which is modulo 2^16? \n\nIn Fortran, the `ichar` function returns the position in the collating sequence. The standard says that the result of `ichar` is in the range 0 to n-1, where n is the number of characters in the collating sequence. And `char(i)` for i in that range returns the corresponding character. If we do `ichar(c)+1` and that is beyond the maximum, then we must take modulo? \n\nBut the standard does not specify what happens if we use `char(i)` for i outside the range. However, we can use modulo arithmetic. The Java program does not do modulo? It just adds 1 and then truncates to 16 bits? \n\nBut in Fortran, we don't know the range. To be safe, we can avoid modulo and let the system handle it? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the second part of the chain always outputs 1. So we don't really care about the intermediate character? Actually we do, because we must output it. \n\nBut the problem does not specify the character set. We'll assume that the input character is in the ASCII range and the next character is also in the ASCII range. \n\nBut to be robust, we can do:\n\n   c = char(ichar(line(1:1)) + 1)\n\nand hope that the system's character set is contiguous and wraps? \n\nAlternatively, we can compute the next character without worrying about modulo because the problem doesn't specify. And the original Java program does not do modulo either: it just adds 1 and then truncates to 16 bits? Actually, the Java `char` is unsigned 16-bit. So if the character is 0xFFFF, then adding 1 becomes 0x0000.\n\nWe can simulate that in Fortran? But Fortran doesn't specify the range.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we'll assume that the input is such that the next character is within the representable range.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program is:\n\n  program main\n      implicit none\n      character(len=100) :: line\n      character :: c\n      read(*, '(a)') line\n      c = char(ichar(line(1:1)) + 1\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c\n      write(*, '(a)') '1'\n  end program\n\nBut wait: what if the input line is empty? Then we try to access line(1:1) -> it will be a space? or an error? In Fortran, if the string is shorter than 100, then the rest is padded with spaces. So if the input is empty, then the first character is space. Then we output the next character after space, which is '!'.\n\nBut in Java, reading an empty line: `s = r.readLine()` returns an empty string. Then `s.charAt(0)` throws an exception. So the Fortran program should not read empty lines? The problem does not specify. We assume the input is non-empty.\n\nAlternatively, we can handle empty input? The problem says the same behavior. The original Java program throws an exception on empty input. Our Fortran program would not. But we can check the length.\n\n  if (len_trim(line) == 0) then\n      ... handle error? but the problem does not specify. We'll assume non-empty.\n\nSo we'll leave as is.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program:\n\n  We are combining two programs. The first program outputs the next character of the first character of the input. The second program, taking that character as input, outputs 1. So the entire output is that next character and then the string \"1\" with a newline.\n\nBut note: the second program in the chain outputs the integer 1 and a newline. We are outputting the character '1' and a newline. This is the same.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly."
