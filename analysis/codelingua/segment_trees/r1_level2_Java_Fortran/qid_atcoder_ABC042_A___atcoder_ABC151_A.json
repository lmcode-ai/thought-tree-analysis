Then the set must be {5,5,7}. Therefore, we must check if the three numbers are exactly two 5's and one 7. So we should fix the condition:\n\n        Instead of:\n\n          if (x == 5 | x == 7 | a == 5 | a == 7 | y == 5 | y == 7) {\n            if (x + y + a == 17) {\n                h = \"YES\";\n            }\n          } We should check:\n\n          if ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. (x==5 .and. a==7 .and. y==5) .or. (x==7 .and. a==5 .and. y==5) ) then\n              h = \"YES\";\n          else\n              h = \"NO\";\n\n        But note: the variables are x, a, y. The first number is x, second a, third y. However, the condition above for permutations: \n          (x=5, a=5, y=7) -> YES\n          (x=5, a=7, y=5) -> YES\n          (x=7, a=5, y=5) -> YES But what about other orders? Actually, that covers all permutations? The set {5,5,7} has three distinct orders? [5,5,7] -> covered by (x=5, a=5, y=7) [5,7,5] -> covered by (x=5, a=7, y=5) [7,5,5] -> covered by (x=7, a=5, y=5) So we have three conditions. Alternatively, we can count the number of 5's and 7's:\n\n          if ( (x+a+y == 17) .and. ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. ... ) )   -> but the condition above already implies the sum is 17? Actually, the three permutations we listed all have sum 17. So we can do:\n\n          if ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. (x==5 .and. a==7 .and. y==5) .or. (x==7 .and. a==5 .and. y==5) ) then\n             h = \"YES\"\n          else\n             h = \"NO\"\n\n        This is safe. Why did the original Java program work in the contest?",

For [5,5,8]:\n            Condition1: true (because of 5) -> then condition2: 5+5+8=18 -> NO -> correct. For [5,6,6]:\n            Condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 5+6+6=17 -> YES -> incorrect. So the original condition is flawed and would fail on [5,6,6]. Since we are to reproduce the same behavior, we must use the same flawed condition? Or the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\". Therefore, we must use the same condition as in the first Java program. So we will:\n\n        Read x, a, y.\n\n        Condition1: (x==5 .or. x==7 .or. a==5 .or. a==7 .or. y==5 .or. y==7) \n        Condition2: (x+y+a == 17)\n\n        Then set the string to \"YES\" if both are true, else \"NO\". Then for the second part, we take the first character of that string and add 1 to it. Then output that character. Steps in Fortran:\n\n        1. Read three integers: x, a, y (note: the second variable is named 'a'). 2. condition1 = (x==5) .or. (x==7) .or. (a==5) .or. (a==7) .or. (y==5) .or. (y==7)\n        3. condition2 = (x + a + y == 17)\n\n        4. if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n               h = \"YES\"\n           else\n               h = \"NO\"\n           end if\n\n        5. Then we take the first character of h: \n             c = h(1:1)\n\n        6. Then compute the next character: \n             next_char = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\n        7. Print next_char. However, note: the second Java program uses `s.charAt(0) + 1` and then prints as a character. Example: \n          For \"YES\", the first character is 'Y'. In ASCII, 'Y' is 89, then 90 is 'Z'. For \"NO\", the first character is 'N'. In ASCII, 'N' is 78, then 79 is 'O'. So we do:\n\n          c = h(1:1)\n          next_char = char( ichar(c) + 1 )\n\n      Then write the next_char. But note: Fortran uses IACHAR for ASCII character to integer, and CHAR for integer to character. However, the Fortran standard guarantees that the default character set is ASCII? Actually, we can assume the environment is the same as the Java program (which uses ASCII).",

But this is incorrect according to the problem? However, we are reproducing the flawed condition of the first Java program. And the chain of the two Java programs would output 'Z' for [5,6,6]? First Java program: \n            For [5,6,6]:\n                condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 5+6+6=17 -> true -> output \"YES\"\n\n          Then second Java program: \n                reads \"YES\", then outputs the next character after 'Y' -> 'Z'\n\n          So our Fortran program must output 'Z' for [5,6,6] to be identical. Therefore, we are consistent. We output a single character.",

The output of the first becomes the input of the second.\n\nFirst Java program (atcoder_ABC042_A):\n  - Reads three integers (x, a, y) from one line of input.\n  - Checks if among the three numbers there are at least one 5 and one 7 (and the third can be either) and that the sum is 17.\n  - Outputs \"YES\" if the conditions are met, else \"NO\".\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a single string (which in this context will be either \"YES\" or \"NO\" from the first program).\n  - Then it outputs the next character in the alphabet after the first character of the string.\n\nHowever, note the second program only reads one string and then takes the first character. Let's see what happens for the two cases:\n\nCase 1: Input to the second program is \"YES\"\n  - The first character is 'Y'. Then 'Y' + 1 in ASCII is 'Z'. So it prints 'Z'.\n\nCase 2: Input to the second program is \"NO\"\n  - The first character is 'N'. Then 'N' + 1 in ASCII is 'O'. So it prints 'O'.\n\nBut wait: the first program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and the second program uses the first character and adds 1 to it.\n\nTherefore, the entire chain:\n\n  Input to the first program: three integers on one line.\n\n  Output of the first program: either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which becomes the input to the second.\n\n  Output of the second program: either 'Z' (if first output was \"YES\") or 'O' (if first output was \"NO\").\n\nSo the entire chain: read three integers, then output a single character: either 'Z' or 'O'.\n\nBut note: the second program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`, so it outputs a single character.\n\nNow, we are to write a single Fortran program that does the same.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read three integers from standard input (like the first Java program).\n2. Process to determine if the condition holds (so that we would have output \"YES\" or \"NO\" in the first program).\n3. Instead of outputting that string, we will use the first character of the string and then compute the next character (like the second Java program).\n4. Output a single character.\n\nSo we skip the intermediate output.\n\nCondition for the first part:\n\n  We have three integers: x, a, y (the Java program reads them in that order, but note the variable names: the second variable is named 'a', which is the same as the third in the split? Actually, the Java program reads:\n\n      String[] list = line.split(\" \");\n      int x = Integer.parseInt(list[0]);\n      int a = Integer.parseInt(list[1]);\n      int y = Integer.parseInt(list[2]);\n\n  So the variables are: x (first), a (second), y (third).\n\n  Condition: \n      if (x == 5 | x == 7 | a == 5 | a == 7 | y == 5 | y == 7) {\n          if (x + y + a == 17) {\n              h = \"YES\";\n          }\n      }\n\n  Actually, note: the condition requires at least one of the numbers to be 5 and one to be 7? But the condition is written with ORs. However, note that the condition is:\n\n      if (any of the three is 5 OR 7) and the sum is 17 -> then YES.\n\n  But wait: the condition does not require both 5 and 7 to be present. For example, if the numbers are [5,5,7] then the condition holds? Let's check:\n\n      5,5,7: \n          each one is either 5 or 7? yes (all are either 5 or 7). \n          sum = 5+5+7 = 17 -> YES.\n\n      However, what about [5,6,6]? \n          The first condition: \n            x=5 -> true (so the outer if condition is true). Then check the sum: 5+6+6=17 -> false -> NO.\n\n      But what about [5,7,5]? \n          condition: true and sum=17 -> YES.\n\n      The problem: the original condition does not require that the three numbers are exactly 5,5,7 in any order? Actually, the problem that this Java program solves is:\n\n          \"Iroha's Haiku\" (ABC042 A): \n          The haiku requires three numbers: 5, 5, 7 or 5,7,5 or 7,5,5? Actually, the problem says: \n          \"The poem must be of the form 5,7,5\". But note the example: 5,5,7 is also accepted? \n\n          The problem statement: \n          \"She will be happy if the three numbers she picks are 5, 7 and 5 in some order.\"\n\n          So the set must contain two 5's and one 7.\n\n      Therefore, the condition in the Java program is not entirely correct? \n\n      Let me check: the condition says: if at least one of the numbers is 5 or 7 (so if there's a number that is not 5 or 7, then the condition fails? Actually, no: because if one number is 5, then the condition is true). \n\n      But then the inner condition: the sum must be 17.\n\n      Since 5+5+7 = 17, then if the three numbers are 5,5,7 (in any order) the condition holds.\n\n      However, what if we have 5,7,7? \n          condition: all are 5 or 7 -> true.\n          sum = 5+7+7 = 19 -> fails.\n\n      So it's safe? Actually, the condition is: the set must be exactly {5,5,7}. Because the only way to get 17 with three numbers each being either 5 or 7 is to have two 5's and one 7.\n\n      Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n        Read three integers: x, a, y (note: the second variable is named 'a', but that's just a name).\n\n        Check: \n          if ( (x==5 .or. x==7 .or. a==5 .or. a==7 .or. y==5 .or. y==7) .and. (x+y+a == 17) ) then\n              we would have set the string to \"YES\"\n          else\n              \"NO\"\n\n        Then take the first character of that string and add 1 to its ASCII.\n\n        Then output that character.\n\n      However, note: the condition in the Java program uses a bitwise OR? Actually, in Java, `|` is bitwise OR, but when used in a condition with booleans, it is a logical OR (without short-circuit). So it's the same as logical OR in this context.\n\n      But in Fortran, we use `.or.`.\n\n      Important: the condition in the Java program does not require every number to be 5 or 7? It only requires at least one of the numbers to be either 5 or 7? Actually, it checks each variable independently: if any one of the three variables is 5 or 7? That condition is always true for the valid set (because they are 5 and 7) and also for [5,5,5]? But [5,5,5] has sum 15 -> fails. Similarly, [7,7,7] has sum 21 -> fails.\n\n      But note: the condition is written as:\n\n          if (x == 5 | x == 7 | a == 5 | a == 7 | y == 5 | y == 7) ...\n\n      This condition is true if at least one of the six conditions is true. So if at least one of the numbers is either 5 or 7, then we proceed to check the sum. \n\n      However, what if the three numbers are [4,4,9]? \n          Then none of the numbers is 5 or 7 -> condition fails -> NO.\n\n      But the problem: the haiku must be 5,7,5. So [4,4,9] is not valid -> correct.\n\n      However, the condition is too broad? For example, [5,4,8]: \n          The first number is 5 -> condition true, then check sum: 5+4+8=17? yes -> then YES? But that's not valid because the haiku must be 5,5,7 or permutations.\n\n      So the condition in the Java program is flawed? \n\n      Let me check the problem: \n          \"Iroha's Haiku\" (ABC042 A): \n          The haiku must be 5,7,5 in some order. So the numbers must be two 5's and one 7.\n\n      Therefore, the condition in the Java program is:\n\n          Condition1: at least one of the numbers is 5 or 7 -> this doesn't ensure that all are 5 or 7? \n          Condition2: the sum is 17.\n\n      But note: the only sets of three numbers that are either 5 or 7 and sum to 17 are [5,5,7] (and permutations). \n\n      However, if we have [5,5,7] -> condition1 is true (because there is at least one 5 or 7) and condition2: 17 -> YES.\n\n      But what about [5,5,7]? condition1 is true and condition2 true -> YES.\n\n      What about [5,6,6]? condition1 is true (because of the 5) and condition2: 5+6+6=17 -> YES? But that is invalid.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is flawed.\n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"The poem must be of the form 5,7,5\". So the numbers must be exactly two 5's and one 7. \n\n      The original Java program for ABC042_A is known to be correct? \n\n      Let me check a known solution for ABC042_A:\n\n        Another known solution in Java:\n\n          import java.util.*;\n          public class Main {\n            public static void main(String[] args) {\n              Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n              int a = sc.nextInt();\n              int b = sc.nextInt();\n              int c = sc.nextInt();\n              if (a == 5 && b == 5 && c == 7 ||\n                  a == 5 && b == 7 && c == 5 ||\n                  a == 7 && b == 5 && c == 5) {\n                System.out.println(\"YES\");\n              } else {\n                System.out.println(\"NO\");\n              }\n            }\n          }\n\n      So the intended condition is to check for permutations of [5,5,7].\n\n      Therefore, the condition in the provided first Java program is incorrect.\n\n      But wait: the problem statement in the contest: \n          \"Iroha decided to make a Haiku. A Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables in each.\"\n\n          So the poem must have 5, 7, 5 syllables. Therefore, the three numbers must be 5, 7, 5? But the problem says \"in some order\"? Actually, the problem does not say that. It says the Haiku has three phrases with 5, 7, and 5 syllables. So the order is fixed? \n\n          But the example input: \n            5 5 7\n\n          and the example output: \n            YES\n\n          So the problem says: \"in some order\". Actually, the problem statement: \n          \"Iroha has come up with the three phrases. The i-th phrase has s_i syllables. Determine whether the combination of s_1, s_2 and s_3 can be arranged into a Haiku.\"\n\n          So the arrangement: we can rearrange arbitrarily? Then the set must be {5,5,7}.\n\n      Therefore, we must check if the three numbers are exactly two 5's and one 7.\n\n      So we should fix the condition:\n\n        Instead of:\n\n          if (x == 5 | x == 7 | a == 5 | a == 7 | y == 5 | y == 7) {\n            if (x + y + a == 17) {\n                h = \"YES\";\n            }\n          }\n\n        We should check:\n\n          if ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. \n                (x==5 .and. a==7 .and. y==5) .or.\n                (x==7 .and. a==5 .and. y==5) ) then\n              h = \"YES\";\n          else\n              h = \"NO\";\n\n        But note: the variables are x, a, y. The first number is x, second a, third y.\n\n        However, the condition above for permutations: \n          (x=5, a=5, y=7) -> YES\n          (x=5, a=7, y=5) -> YES\n          (x=7, a=5, y=5) -> YES\n\n        But what about other orders? Actually, that covers all permutations? The set {5,5,7} has three distinct orders? \n          [5,5,7] -> covered by (x=5, a=5, y=7)\n          [5,7,5] -> covered by (x=5, a=7, y=5)\n          [7,5,5] -> covered by (x=7, a=5, y=5)\n\n        So we have three conditions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can count the number of 5's and 7's:\n\n          if ( (x+a+y == 17) .and. \n               ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. ... ) )   -> but the condition above already implies the sum is 17? Actually, the three permutations we listed all have sum 17.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if ( (x==5 .and. a==5 .and. y==7) .or. \n               (x==5 .and. a==7 .and. y==5) .or.\n               (x==7 .and. a==5 .and. y==5) ) then\n             h = \"YES\"\n          else\n             h = \"NO\"\n\n        This is safe.\n\n      Why did the original Java program work in the contest? \n        The test cases: \n          \"The input is given from Standard Input in the following form:\n          s1 s2 s3\"\n\n          Constraints: each s_i is an integer between 1 and 10.\n\n          The known test cases:\n\n            \"5 5 7\" -> YES\n            \"5 7 5\" -> YES\n            \"7 5 5\" -> YES\n            \"5 5 5\" -> NO\n            \"5 5 8\" -> NO\n\n        The original condition for [5,5,7]:\n            Condition1: true because there are 5 and 7.\n            Condition2: 5+5+7=17 -> YES -> correct.\n\n        For [5,5,8]:\n            Condition1: true (because of 5) -> then condition2: 5+5+8=18 -> NO -> correct.\n\n        For [5,6,6]:\n            Condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 5+6+6=17 -> YES -> incorrect.\n\n        So the original condition is flawed and would fail on [5,6,6]. \n\n      Since we are to reproduce the same behavior, we must use the same flawed condition? Or the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n      Therefore, we must use the same condition as in the first Java program.\n\n      So we will:\n\n        Read x, a, y.\n\n        Condition1: (x==5 .or. x==7 .or. a==5 .or. a==7 .or. y==5 .or. y==7) \n        Condition2: (x+y+a == 17)\n\n        Then set the string to \"YES\" if both are true, else \"NO\".\n\n      Then for the second part, we take the first character of that string and add 1 to it.\n\n      Then output that character.\n\n      Steps in Fortran:\n\n        1. Read three integers: x, a, y (note: the second variable is named 'a').\n\n        2. condition1 = (x==5) .or. (x==7) .or. (a==5) .or. (a==7) .or. (y==5) .or. (y==7)\n        3. condition2 = (x + a + y == 17)\n\n        4. if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n               h = \"YES\"\n           else\n               h = \"NO\"\n           end if\n\n        5. Then we take the first character of h: \n             c = h(1:1)\n\n        6. Then compute the next character: \n             next_char = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\n        7. Print next_char.\n\n      However, note: the second Java program uses `s.charAt(0) + 1` and then prints as a character. \n\n      Example: \n          For \"YES\", the first character is 'Y'. In ASCII, 'Y' is 89, then 90 is 'Z'.\n          For \"NO\", the first character is 'N'. In ASCII, 'N' is 78, then 79 is 'O'.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          c = h(1:1)\n          next_char = char( ichar(c) + 1 )\n\n      Then write the next_char.\n\n      But note: Fortran uses IACHAR for ASCII character to integer, and CHAR for integer to character.\n\n      However, the Fortran standard guarantees that the default character set is ASCII? Actually, we can assume the environment is the same as the Java program (which uses ASCII).\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the ACHAR and IACHAR functions which are for ASCII.\n\n      IACHAR(c) returns the ASCII code of the character c.\n\n      So:\n\n          integer :: code\n          character :: c, next_char\n\n          c = h(1:1)\n          code = iachar(c)\n          next_char = achar(code + 1)\n\n      But note: the function achar is for ASCII.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          next_char = achar( iachar(c) + 1 )\n\n      However, the Java program uses the system default character set? But the problem says the same behavior. And the original Java program uses `charAt(0)` which is a 16-bit Unicode character, but for 'Y' and 'N' (which are in ASCII) it's the same.\n\n      Therefore, we can use achar and iachar.\n\n      Now, the entire program:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: x, a, y, total\n          character(len=3) :: h\n          character :: c, next_char\n          logical :: condition1, condition2\n\n          ! Read the three integers\n          read(*,*) x, a, y\n\n          total = x + a + y\n\n          condition1 = (x == 5) .or. (x == 7) .or. (a == 5) .or. (a == 7) .or. (y == 5) .or. (y == 7)\n          condition2 = (total == 17)\n\n          if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n            h = \"YES\"\n          else\n            h = \"NO\"\n          end if\n\n          c = h(1:1)\n          next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n          ! Output the next_char\n          write(*, '(a)') next_char\n\n        end program combined\n\n      But note: the string h is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so we can also set h to a string of length 3? But we only use the first character.\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid the string h and just set a character for the first letter? But the second program uses the entire string? Actually, the second program only uses the first character.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n             c = 'Y'\n          else\n             c = 'N'\n          end if\n\n          next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n      This is simpler.\n\n      So:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: x, a, y, total\n          character :: c, next_char\n          logical :: condition1, condition2\n\n          read(*,*) x, a, y\n\n          total = x + a + y\n\n          condition1 = (x == 5) .or. (x == 7) .or. (a == 5) .or. (a == 7) .or. (y == 5) .or. (y == 7)\n          condition2 = (total == 17)\n\n          if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n            c = 'Y'\n          else\n            c = 'N'\n          end if\n\n          next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n          write(*, '(a)') next_char\n\n        end program combined\n\n      This is more efficient.\n\n      Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: 5 5 7\n          condition1: true (because 5 is present) -> condition2: 5+5+7=17 -> true -> c = 'Y' -> next_char = 'Z'\n\n        Example 2: 5 5 8\n          condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 18 -> false -> c = 'N' -> next_char = 'O'\n\n        Example 3: 5 6 6\n          condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 17 -> true -> then we get 'Y' -> 'Z'. But this is incorrect according to the problem? \n          However, we are reproducing the flawed condition of the first Java program. And the chain of the two Java programs would output 'Z' for [5,6,6]? \n\n          First Java program: \n            For [5,6,6]:\n                condition1: true (because of 5) -> condition2: 5+6+6=17 -> true -> output \"YES\"\n\n          Then second Java program: \n                reads \"YES\", then outputs the next character after 'Y' -> 'Z'\n\n          So our Fortran program must output 'Z' for [5,6,6] to be identical.\n\n      Therefore, we are consistent.\n\n      We output a single character.\n\n      Note: the second Java program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which outputs a single character without a newline? Actually, in Java, `printf` does not automatically append a newline. But the format string is \"%c\", so it outputs one character and then the program exits. The Fortran `write(*, '(a)')` outputs the character and then a newline? \n\n      But the original chain: the first Java program outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" (which is a string without a newline? Actually, the first program uses `System.out.println(h)`, which appends a newline. Then the second program reads a line (with `r.readLine()`) and then outputs a character without a newline? \n\n      However, the second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which does not append a newline. So the output of the chain is a single character (without a newline) and then the program exits? \n\n      But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n      We must output the same: the single character without a newline? \n\n      However, in Fortran, the `write(*, '(a)')` will by default append a newline? \n\n      We can use:\n\n          write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      But note: the problem does not specify the exact output format (with or without newline) for the entire chain? The first program outputs a string with a newline, but the second program outputs a character without a newline. Then the final output is the character without a newline? \n\n      However, the entire chain output is:\n\n          Program1: outputs \"YES\\n\" (if condition holds) or \"NO\\n\".\n          Program2: then reads the entire line (including the newline? Actually, the Java BufferedReader readLine() discards the newline). Then program2 outputs a single character without a newline.\n\n      So the final output is the single character without a newline.\n\n      Therefore, we must output without a newline.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and we are writing a single Fortran program. We are to output only the last output (the character) without any extra newlines.\n\n      So we use:\n\n          write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      However, this might cause the output to be stuck in the buffer? We can flush? But when the program ends, the output will be flushed.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          write(*, '(a)') next_char   ! This will add a newline -> not identical.\n\n      The specification: \"behaves identically\" meaning same output.\n\n      But the original chain outputs without a newline. So we must avoid the newline.\n\n      But note: the first program outputs with a newline, but that is not the final output. The final output is the character from the second program without a newline.\n\n      Therefore, we output without a newline.\n\n      However, the Fortran standard requires that if we use non-advancing I/O we must also have an IOSTAT or SIZE? Actually, we don't need to if we are just writing to standard output.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      But let me check: in Fortran, this is standard? Yes, and at the end of the program, the output is flushed.\n\n      But note: the Java program exits immediately after printing, so the output is flushed. Similarly, Fortran will flush at the end.\n\n      However, to be safe, we can flush? But not necessary.\n\n      Therefore, the program:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: x, a, y, total\n          character :: c, next_char\n          logical :: condition1, condition2\n\n          read(*,*) x, a, y\n\n          total = x + a + y\n\n          condition1 = (x == 5) .or. (x == 7) .or. (a == 5) .or. (a == 7) .or. (y == 5) .or. (y == 7)\n          condition2 = (total == 17)\n\n          if (condition1 .and. condition2) then\n            c = 'Y'\n          else\n            c = 'N'\n          end if\n\n          next_char = achar(iachar(c) + 1)\n\n          write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n        end program combined\n\n      But note: the variable 'a' is the second integer. The names are just for clarity.\n\n      Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Input: 5 5 7 -> output: 'Z'\n        Input: 5 5 8 -> output: 'O'\n\n      This matches.\n\n      However, note: the second Java program has a RemRing class that is not used. We can ignore it.\n\n      Therefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
