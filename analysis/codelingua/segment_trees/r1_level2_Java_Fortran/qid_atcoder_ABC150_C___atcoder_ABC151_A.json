But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem ABC151_A (which is meant to take a single letter and output the next letter). But note: the problem statement for ABC151_A: \"The program reads one character and prints the next character in the alphabet.\" However, the code reads a string and then takes the first character. So if we run the chain:\n\n  Example input for first program: \n      3\n      1 2 3\n      1 3 2\n\n  Output of first program: 1 (because the permutations of \"123\" are [\"123\", \"132\", \"213\", \"231\", \"312\", \"321\"]; \n      \"123\" is at index 0, \"132\" at index 1 -> |0-1| = 1? Actually, the code does:\n          if (sum == 0) then sum += index of the first string (0)\n          then for the second string (index 1) -> sum = 0 - 1 = -1 -> absolute value 1. Then the second program gets the string \"1\" (which is the output of the first program). The first character is '1', and then we do '1' + 1 -> which is the character '2'. So the output is '2'. But wait: in the first program, the output is an integer, so we have to output the integer as a string? Actually, the first program uses System.out.println(Math.abs(sum)); which prints the integer and then a newline. In the chain, the second program reads that entire line? But note: the second program uses `s = r.readLine();` and then `s.charAt(0)`. So it will take the first character of the line that is read. So we must combine the two programs:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and then 2*n numbers (each in the range 1..n) to form two strings of n characters each. Step 2: Generate all permutations of the string \"123...n\" (with n digits) in lexicographic order?",

So if n>=10, then the string would be multi-digit? But wait: the input tokens are read by `scanner.next()`, so they are tokens. The example input for n=3 is \"1 2 3\" and \"1 3 2\". So each token is a single-digit number? Actually, if n>=10, then the tokens would be two-digit?

So we are doing: Step 1: Read initial input (n and 2*n tokens). Step 2: Compute the integer k (absolute difference of the indices). Step 3: Convert k to a string and take the first character, then compute the next character. Step 4: Output k and then the next character as described. This matches the chain. Implementation details:\n\n      We need to generate permutations of a string of n characters. The string is \"123...n\", each character representing a digit. We can generate the permutations recursively? But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays? We can allocate an array of size factorial(n) and length n? Since n<=8, factorial(8)=40320, which is acceptable.",

Alternatively, we can do as in Java: \n\n            if (len(base) == 1) then \n                new_ans = ans // base\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = new_ans\n            else\n                do i=1, len(base)\n                    ! take the i-th character\n                    c = base(i:i)\n                    new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)\n                    new_ans = ans // c\n                    call gen_perm_recurse(new_base, new_ans, perms, counter)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          But note: the length of base is decreasing? But in Fortran, the string `new_base` will have length = len(base)-1? We are passing `new_base` as a string of length len(base)-1? But the dummy argument `base` is declared as `character(len=*)`. Then in the next call, the length is set to the actual length? So that works. However, we have to define:\n\n            character(len=*) :: base, ans\n\n          and then:\n\n            new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)   -> the length of new_base is (i-1) + (len(base)-i) = len(base)-1. And new_ans = ans // c: the length of new_ans is len(ans)+1.",

But the dummy argument `current` is declared as `character(len=*)` so it takes the length from the actual argument. However, the perms array is defined as `character(len=n)`. When we assign `perms(counter)=current`, if current is of length less than n, then it will be truncated? Or if longer, then it will take the first n characters? We want the permutation to be of length n. So we must have current of length n at the end? We can change: we pass a string of length n for current? And we keep track of the next index to fill? Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            character(len=n) :: current   ! in the main program, we set current to a string of n spaces? and we have an integer `pos` (the next position to fill). Then we don't use string concatenation? We'll do:\n\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, pos, current, perms, counter)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base\n            integer, intent(in) :: pos   ! next position to fill in current (1-indexed: from 1 to n)\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: current   ! the current built permutation (we are filling from 1 to n)\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: perms(:)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n            integer :: i, L\n\n            L = len(base) if (L == 0) then\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = current\n            else\n                do i = 1, L\n                    current(pos:pos) = base(i:i)   !",

This is acceptable. Let me run for the example in the first program: \n        n=3\n        first permutation: 1 2 3 -> str1=\"123\"\n        second permutation: 1 3 2 -> str2=\"132\"\n\n        The permutations: \n          123\n          132\n          213\n          231\n          312\n          321\n\n        So index of \"123\" is 1? (in our array starting at 1) -> 1\n        index of \"132\" is 2 -> k = |1-2| = 1 -> same as above. But wait: the Java program does:\n\n        for the first string (j=0): \n            finds \"123\" at index i=0 -> then sum = 0 + 0 = 0? then for the second string (j=1): \n            finds \"132\" at index i=1 -> then sum = 0 - 1 = -1 -> abs(1) -> 1. In our program, we are using 1-indexed? In the Java program, the list is 0-indexed: \n            listA.get(0) = \"123\", listA.get(1)=\"132\", ... In our Fortran program, perms(1)=\"123\", perms(2)=\"132\", ... so the indices are 1-indexed. Then we compute k = |1-2|=1? But the Java program computes |0-1|=1? So the answer is the same?",

Then we search for str1 in perms? and then str2? We traverse i from 1 to fact:\n\n            if (perms(i) == str1) then\n                idx1 = i\n            if (perms(i) == str2) then\n                idx2 = i\n\n          Then k = abs(idx1 - idx2)   -> but the Java program does:\n\n                if (sum == 0) then \n                    sum += i   (for the first string)\n                else \n                    sum -= i   (for the second string)\n\n          Then output abs(sum). Actually, the Java program:\n\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < line.length; j++) {   // j=0 and j=1\n                for (int i = 0; i < listA.size(); i++) {\n                    if (listA.get(i).equals(line[j][0])) {\n                        if (sum == 0) {\n                            sum += i;\n                        } else {\n                            sum -= i;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            System.out.println(Math.abs(sum));\n\n          So for the first string (j=0) we set sum to the index (say, a), and for the second string (j=1) we set sum = a - b? Then absolute value |a-b|. We can do:\n\n            idx1 = -1\n            idx2 = -1\n            do i=1, fact\n                if (perms(i) == str1) then\n                    idx1 = i\n                end if\n                if (perms(i) == str2) then\n                    idx2 = i\n                end if\n            end do\n            k = abs(idx1 - idx2) Then we have k. Then we convert k to a string? write(str_k, *) k   !",

But new_line('a') is a character? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   ! This outputs the integer and then what? Actually, the format I0 does not include a newline?

Let me check: the format I0 is for integers and then the output will advance to the next line? Actually, yes: a write statement with a format and without advance='no' will add a newline. So:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   -> outputs the integer without leading spaces and then a newline.

How about:\n\n            We define the perms array as character(len=n) perms(fact) Initially, we call:\n\n                call gen_perm_recurse(base, \"\", perms, counter) But then in the recursive call, we do:\n\n                new_ans = ans // c   -> but ans is \"\" (of length 0) and c is a character, so new_ans will be of length 1? But we want the permutation to be of length n? We can define:\n\n                ans: as a string of length n? initially, we set it to a string of n spaces? Then we build from left? We can track the position? Alternatively, we can avoid the fixed length for ans?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each program does:\n\n1. File 1: atcoder_ABC150_C\n   - Reads an integer `n`.\n   - Reads two strings (each string is built by concatenating `n` tokens from the input).\n   - Generates all permutations of the string \"123...n\" (with `n` digits).\n   - For each of the two input strings, it finds the index of that string in the lexicographically ordered list of permutations.\n   - Then it computes the absolute difference of the two indices and prints it.\n\n2. File 2: atcoder_ABC151_A\n   - Reads a string from the input.\n   - Takes the first character of the string, increments it by one (in terms of ASCII), and prints the resulting character.\n\nHowever, note that the output of the first program (which is an integer) is intended to be the input to the second program? But looking at the second program, it reads a string and expects a single line. The first program outputs a single integer. So the chain would be:\n\n  Input to first program: \n      n\n      then 2*n numbers (each from 1 to n) to form two strings.\n\n  Output of first program: an integer (say, k)\n\n  Then the second program would run with input k? But the second program expects a string and then takes the first character and increments it.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string. The output of the first program is an integer, so we would have to convert that integer to a string? However, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the second program would read the integer (as a string) and then take the first character and increment it.\n\nBut note: the second program only reads one line. The first program outputs one integer (without any extra spaces) and then a newline. So the second program would read the entire integer as a string? Then it takes the first character and increments it.\n\nHowever, the second program expects a single character? Actually, it reads a string and then takes the first character. For example, if the first program outputs \"10\", then the second program would take '1' and then add 1 to get '2'. But that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem ABC151_A (which is meant to take a single letter and output the next letter). \n\nBut note: the problem statement for ABC151_A: \"The program reads one character and prints the next character in the alphabet.\" However, the code reads a string and then takes the first character. So if we run the chain:\n\n  Example input for first program: \n      3\n      1 2 3\n      1 3 2\n\n  Output of first program: 1 (because the permutations of \"123\" are [\"123\", \"132\", \"213\", \"231\", \"312\", \"321\"]; \n      \"123\" is at index 0, \"132\" at index 1 -> |0-1| = 1? Actually, the code does:\n          if (sum == 0) then sum += index of the first string (0)\n          then for the second string (index 1) -> sum = 0 - 1 = -1 -> absolute value 1.\n\n  Then the second program gets the string \"1\" (which is the output of the first program). The first character is '1', and then we do '1' + 1 -> which is the character '2'. So the output is '2'.\n\nBut wait: in the first program, the output is an integer, so we have to output the integer as a string? Actually, the first program uses System.out.println(Math.abs(sum)); which prints the integer and then a newline.\n\nIn the chain, the second program reads that entire line? But note: the second program uses `s = r.readLine();` and then `s.charAt(0)`. So it will take the first character of the line that is read.\n\nSo we must combine the two programs:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and then 2*n numbers (each in the range 1..n) to form two strings of n characters each.\n\n  Step 2: Generate all permutations of the string \"123...n\" (with n digits) in lexicographic order? Actually, the permutation function generates in the order of the recursive generation: the first character chosen, then the next, etc. This is lexicographic order? Actually, the recursion goes in order: for each position, it picks the next available character in the order they appear. So it is lexicographic.\n\n  Step 3: Find the indices of the two input strings in the list of permutations.\n\n  Step 4: Compute the absolute difference of the indices.\n\n  Step 5: Use that absolute difference (an integer) as the input to the next program? But the next program expects a string. So we have to convert the integer to a string? Actually, the first program outputs the integer as a string (via println). Then the second program reads that string.\n\n  Step 6: The second program takes the first character of that string and increments it (in the ASCII sense) and then prints the character.\n\nBut note: the second program also has a class `RemRing` that is defined but not used. We can ignore it.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program:\n\n  - Read the integer `n`.\n  - Then read a sequence of `2*n` integers (each in the range 1 to n) from the input. The first `n` form the first string, the next `n` form the second string.\n\n  - Build the two strings: each integer is converted to a character? But note: in the Java program, they are concatenated as strings. The input tokens are strings of one or more digits? Actually, the input tokens are single-digit numbers? Because the numbers are from 1 to n, and n<=? (we don't know, but note: the permutation string is built by `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { number += i; }` and `i` is a single digit only if i < 10. So if n>=10, then the string would be multi-digit? \n\nBut wait: the input tokens are read by `scanner.next()`, so they are tokens. The example input for n=3 is \"1 2 3\" and \"1 3 2\". So each token is a single-digit number? Actually, if n>=10, then the tokens would be two-digit? But the permutation string is built by `number += i` which for i=10 would be \"10\", so the string would be \"123...91011...n\". This would break because the tokens in the input are separated by spaces? But the Java program does:\n\n      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n          line[i][0] += scanner.next();\n      }\n\n  So if the tokens are \"10\", then the string becomes \"10\" and the permutation string would be \"123...910\", which is a string of length n? Actually, the permutation string is built by `number += i` for i from 1 to n. If n=10, then the string would be \"12345678910\", which is 11 characters? But we need a string of n characters? Actually, the permutation function expects a string of n characters? But the input tokens for the two strings are n tokens, each token being a string representation of a number. So if n=10, then the first token might be \"1\", then \"2\", ... \"10\". Then the first string would be \"12345678910\", which is 11 characters. But the permutation string is also \"12345678910\" (11 characters). So that matches.\n\n  However, the permutation generation function assumes that the string `target` is of length n? Actually, the permutation function is recursive and uses the length of the string. So for n=10, the permutation list would have 10! elements? But the string is 11 characters? That's a problem.\n\n  Actually, the problem states: \"Given a permutation of 1..n\". So the tokens are the numbers 1..n, each represented as a string. And the permutation string is built by concatenating the numbers 1..n? But that would be a string of more than n characters if n>=10. And then the permutation function would generate permutations of that string? But the input strings are built by concatenating the tokens. So the tokens are the same representation? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"The input consists of two permutations of 1..n\". So the tokens are the numbers 1..n, each as a separate token. Then the program concatenates the tokens to form a string. So the first permutation is a string of the tokens without spaces.\n\n  But the permutation function is called on the string `number` which is built by `for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) number += i;` which for n=10 would be \"12345678910\", which is 11 characters? But the input tokens for the first permutation for n=10 would be 10 tokens, each being a string of one or two digits? Then when we concatenate, we get a string of 11 or more characters? Actually, the tokens are the numbers from 1 to n, so for n=10, the tokens are \"1\", \"2\", ..., \"10\", so when concatenated we get \"12345678910\", which is 11 characters. And the permutation function is generating permutations of the string \"12345678910\", which is 11 characters? But the input permutations are also 11 characters? So that matches.\n\n  However, note that the permutation function does not know about the multi-digit tokens. It treats the string as a sequence of characters. So the token \"10\" becomes two characters: '1' and '0'. Then the permutation of the string \"12345678910\" would be a permutation of the 11 characters? But the input permutation is also built by concatenating tokens, so each token is represented as a string and then concatenated. But the tokens are numbers, so \"10\" is two characters. \n\n  This leads to a problem: the permutation of the string of 11 characters is not the same as the permutation of the numbers 1 to 10? Because the numbers 1 to 10 are represented as strings of one or two characters. The algorithm is actually broken for n>=10? \n\n  But the problem constraints: ABC150_C says n is at most 8. So n<=8. Therefore, we don't have to worry about multi-digit numbers. Each number is a single digit.\n\n  So we can assume n<=8. Then the string \"number\" is exactly n characters long, and each token in the input is a single character.\n\n  Therefore, in Fortran:\n\n    We can read n (as integer) and then read 2*n integers (each as integer, but we can read as character? or as integer and convert to character?).\n\n    But note: the input tokens are separated by spaces. Since n<=8, we can read each token as a string of length 1? Actually, we can read each token as a character.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Read the integer n.\n\n      Step 2: Read 2*n tokens. We can read the entire line? But the tokens are on two lines? The Java program reads the first n tokens for the first string and the next n tokens for the second string. The tokens are on the same line? Actually, the Java program uses `scanner.next()` which reads tokens regardless of line breaks. So the tokens can be on one or more lines? But the problem says: the input is given in standard format.\n\n      We can read the next 2*n tokens (each as a string of length 1). Since n<=8, we can read them as characters.\n\n      Alternatively, we can read two lines? The problem says: the first line is n, the next line is the first permutation (n numbers), the next line is the second permutation? Actually, the problem does not specify the line breaks. But the Java program uses `scanner.next()` so it doesn't care. We'll read the tokens one by one.\n\n      We'll read n, then we'll read 2*n integers? But they are tokens. Since they are single digits, we can read them as characters.\n\n      How about: \n          read *, n\n          Then allocate an array of 2*n characters? and read them.\n\n      But Fortran: we can read 2*n characters? Actually, the tokens are separated by spaces. So we cannot read as a continuous string.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          character(1) :: tokens(2*8)   ! since n<=8, 2*n<=16\n          do i = 1, 2*n\n              read(*,*) tokens(i)\n          end do\n\n      Then the first string is tokens(1:n) and the second string is tokens(n+1:2*n). Then we form the first string by concatenating tokens(1:n) and the second by tokens(n+1:2*n).\n\n      Step 3: Generate all permutations of the string \"12...n\" (each character is a digit). We need to generate them in lexicographic order? Actually, the Java recursion generates in lex order? Yes, because it fixes the first character (in order of the original string) and then recursively generates the rest.\n\n      Step 4: Build a list (array) of all permutations (as strings).\n\n      Step 5: Find the index of the first string and the second string in the list? Note: the Java program uses a list and then iterates to find the index. We can do the same.\n\n      Step 6: Compute the absolute difference of the two indices.\n\n      Step 7: Now, instead of printing, we use that absolute difference (an integer) to form a string? Then we take the first character of that string? But note: the second program in the chain reads the entire output of the first program as a string. So we have to convert the integer to a string? And then take the first character of that string and increment it? Then output the resulting character.\n\n      However, the second program only outputs the character (without a newline? but in Java it uses printf, which by default doesn't add a newline? Actually, it does: printf does not automatically add a newline? The format string is \"%c\", so no newline. But the example output of the first program is an integer and a newline? Then the second program reads the entire line? The newline is part of the input? Actually, the second program uses `readLine()` which reads until a newline. So the string `s` would be the integer and then the newline? Then the first character of that string would be the first digit? Or if the integer has multiple digits, then the first digit? And then we add one to that digit's ASCII value.\n\n      But note: the integer we are printing is the absolute difference. Since n<=8, the maximum permutation index is 8!-1 = 40319? So the integer can be up to 5 digits? Then the string representation of the integer is a string of 1 to 5 digits, then a newline? Then the `readLine()` in the second program would read the digits and the newline? Actually, the `readLine()` in Java includes the newline? But the Java code then uses `s.charAt(0)`: the first character of the string including the newline? Actually, no: the newline is at the end. The first character is the first digit.\n\n      However, in Fortran, when we write an integer, we typically write without any extra spaces? Then we write the integer and then a newline? But the second program expects to read the entire line. So we have to form a string that is the integer without the newline? Then the second program would read the integer as a string without the newline? Actually, the second program reads the entire line (including the newline as a terminator, so the string `s` does not contain the newline). So in Fortran, we must not output the newline until the very end? But the problem says: the entire sequence. The first program in the chain outputs the integer and then a newline. Then the second program reads that entire line (without the newline? because readLine() in Java removes the newline). So the string `s` in the second program is the digits of the integer. Then we take the first character.\n\n      However, the Fortran program must mimic the entire chain without intermediate I/O. So we are not going to actually print the integer and then read it. We are going to:\n\n          Step 1: Read the initial input (n and 2*n tokens) without any output.\n\n          Step 2: Compute the integer result (abs_diff).\n\n          Step 3: Then convert that integer to a string (without newline) and take the first character of that string, then compute the next character (by incrementing the ASCII value by one).\n\n          Step 4: Then output that single character? But note: the original second program outputs a single character without a newline? Then the final output of the chain would be that character? However, the original second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not output a newline? But then the program ends. The output might be flushed? But in practice, we should output the character and then a newline? The problem says \"behaves identically\". The original chain: the first program outputs an integer and a newline, then the second program outputs a character and then terminates (without a newline). So the overall output is:\n\n              <integer><newline><character>\n\n          But the second program does not output a newline? Then the output would be:\n\n              <integer>\\n<character>\n\n          And then the cursor is left at the end of the character? Without a newline? That is acceptable? But in Fortran, we are to output at the very end. We can output the integer and then the character? But the problem says: only the last block should handle producing output. And we are to avoid intermediate I/O.\n\n          However, the entire chain produces two outputs: first the integer (with newline) and then the character (without newline). But the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second. So we are not allowed to output the integer in the middle? We have to simulate the chain without actually writing the integer and then reading it? So we are going to:\n\n            - Only read the initial input (n and the 2*n tokens).\n\n            - Compute the absolute difference (call it `k`).\n\n            - Then convert `k` to a string. Then take the first character of that string.\n\n            - Then increment that character by one (in the ASCII sense).\n\n            - Then output that character? But wait: the original chain outputs the integer (with newline) and then the character (without newline). So the total output is:\n\n                  k\n                  x\n\n            But without the quotes and with a newline after k and then the character without a newline? That would look like:\n\n                  5\n                  @\n\n            Actually, the integer is printed as a number and then the next character is printed at the beginning of the next line? Or at the end of the same line? The second program does not output a newline, so the character is printed after the newline? Actually, the integer is printed and then a newline, then the second program reads the entire line (which is the integer and the newline? Actually, the readLine() in Java reads the integer without the newline? Then the newline is consumed by readLine? Then the output of the second program (the character) is printed on the next line? Actually, no: the readLine() consumes the entire line including the newline? Then the output of the second program is on the same line? Actually, the readLine() returns the string without the newline. Then the second program prints the character without a newline, so it would appear at the current position? But the current position is after the newline? Actually, the first program's output:\n\n                  System.out.println(Math.abs(sum));   -> prints the integer and then a newline.\n\n            Then the second program reads the line: that gives the integer without the newline? Then the second program prints the character without a newline? So the output would be:\n\n                  [integer]\\n[character]\n\n            Then the console would show:\n\n                  5\n                  @\n\n            But actually, after the newline the cursor moves to the next line, and then the character is printed at the beginning of the next line? And then the program ends, so the cursor remains at the end of that line? \n\n            We have to mimic the same output: we output the integer and a newline, then the character? But the problem says: only the last block should produce output. How can we do both? We are allowed to output only at the end? But the chain has two outputs. \n\n            The problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\" and \"only the last block should handle producing output\". This is ambiguous? But note: the entire sequence is to be run as one program. The intermediate outputs are not actually written to the console? They are passed in memory? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\" and we are to avoid intermediate I/O. So we are to simulate the chain without writing and reading. Therefore:\n\n              - We read the initial input.\n\n              - We compute the integer k (from the first program).\n\n              - Then we simulate the second program: it would take the string representation of k (without the newline? but the second program reads a line, which would be the string representation of k without the newline) and then take the first character and increment it.\n\n              - Then we output the result of the second program? But the problem says: the entire chain produces two outputs? Actually, the overall output of the chain is the output of the last program? But the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain outputs the integer and then the character? So we must output both? But the problem says: only the last block should handle producing output. This is confusing.\n\n            Let me re-read: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that in the Fortran program we write, we should only have one output statement at the end? And that output statement should output the same as the entire chain? \n\n            The entire chain outputs:\n\n                [integer]\\n[character]\n\n            So we have to output the integer and then a newline and then the character? But that is two outputs? How can we do that in one output statement? We can output:\n\n                write(*, '(I0)') k   ! This outputs the integer without any extra spaces and a newline.\n                write(*, '(A)', advance='no') char( ... )   ! Output the character without a newline.\n\n            But that is two output statements? And the problem says only the last block should produce output? And we are allowed only one output? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"only the last block should handle producing output\", meaning that we are allowed to output at the end? And we can have multiple output statements at the end? But the problem says \"without I/O in the middle\".\n\n            Alternatively, we can build a string that is the integer and a newline and then the character? And then output that entire string? But the integer and the newline are written first, then the character? That would be:\n\n                  string = trim(adjustl(str_k)) // new_line('a') // next_char\n\n            Then output the string? But then the output would be:\n\n                  <integer>\\n<character>\n\n            which is the same as the chain.\n\n            But note: the second program does not output a newline after the character? So the entire output would be:\n\n                  <integer>\\n<character>\n\n            and then the program ends? The terminal would show:\n\n                  123\n                  a\n\n            but without a newline after the 'a', so the cursor is at the end of the line? That is acceptable? \n\n            However, the problem does not specify the output format beyond the content. We must match exactly.\n\n            But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must output:\n\n                  [integer] followed by a newline, then [character] without a newline.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                  write(*, '(I0)') k      ! This outputs the integer and a newline.\n                  write(*, '(A)', advance='no') next_char   ! Then outputs the character without a newline.\n\n            But the problem says \"only the last block\" meaning we can have output only at the end? And we are at the end? We are doing two writes at the end? That is acceptable.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"without I/O in the middle\". So we are not doing any I/O until after we have computed the character? Then we output two things? That is acceptable.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          character(len=20) :: buffer\n          integer :: length\n\n          ! Convert k to string\n          write(buffer, *) k\n          ! Trim the string: remove leading spaces and then take the non-space part? But integer conversion has leading spaces? We can adjust.\n          buffer = adjustl(buffer)   ! left adjust, so the integer is at the beginning and trailing spaces?\n          ! But we only need the first character? Actually, we are going to take the first character and then compute the next character.\n\n          Then we set: \n              c = buffer(1:1)\n              next_char = char(ichar(c)+1)\n\n          Then output: \n              write(*, '(I0)') k   ! outputs the integer and a newline\n              write(*, '(A)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      But note: the second program in the chain would have read the entire integer? But we are using the entire integer to form a string? Then we take the first character? So we are simulating the second program without actually reading from stdin? \n\n      However, we are not reading from stdin again? We are just using the integer `k` to form a string? Then we take the first character? Then we output both the integer and the character? \n\n      But the problem says: the output of the first program is the input to the second. We are simulating that by using the integer `k` to form a string? Then we take the first character? So we are effectively passing the integer as a string to the second program? Then the second program's output is the incremented first character? Then we output the entire chain's output: which is the integer (with newline) and then the character (without newline).\n\n      However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we are doing:\n\n          Step 1: Read initial input (n and 2*n tokens).\n\n          Step 2: Compute the integer k (absolute difference of the indices).\n\n          Step 3: Convert k to a string and take the first character, then compute the next character.\n\n          Step 4: Output k and then the next character as described.\n\n      This matches the chain.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n      We need to generate permutations of a string of n characters. The string is \"123...n\", each character representing a digit.\n\n      We can generate the permutations recursively? But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays? We can allocate an array of size factorial(n) and length n? Since n<=8, factorial(8)=40320, which is acceptable.\n\n      Steps for generating permutations:\n\n        We'll write a recursive subroutine that builds the permutations.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a non-recursive method? But recursion is straightforward.\n\n        We'll have:\n\n          character(len=n) :: base   ! the base string: \"123...n\"\n          character(len=n) :: current   ! for building the permutation\n          integer :: fact\n          fact = factorial(n)\n          character(len=n), allocatable :: perms(:)\n          allocate(perms(fact))\n\n          Then we call a recursive subroutine to fill perms.\n\n        How to do recursion? We can have:\n\n          recursive subroutine gen_perm(list, count, base, current, used, depth)\n          But we can also do without a used array? We can pass the available string? Like the Java method: permutation(list, target, ans)\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a recursive method that takes:\n\n            string: the current available characters (like target)\n            ans: the current built string (like ans)\n\n          And we'll have a list (array) to store the result.\n\n        We need to know the current index in the list? Or we can have the list as an allocatable array and we append? But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays that can be appended easily? We can precompute the size and then use an index that we increment.\n\n        We know the total number is factorial(len(target)), but we are generating recursively. We can pass an index that is the next free position in the list? \n\n        Alternatively, we can generate the list without knowing the index? We can use a recursive function that returns a list of permutations? But that might be inefficient? We can do:\n\n          function gen_perm(base) result(perms)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base\n            integer :: n, fact, i\n            character(len=len(base)) :: perms(factorial(len(base)))   ! but factorial is not constant? We can precompute.\n\n          Actually, we can compute the factorial? Since n<=8.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n = len(base)\n          fact = factorial(n)\n\n          We'll use a recursive subroutine that fills an array and uses a counter.\n\n          Let me write:\n\n            integer :: counter\n            counter = 0\n            call gen_perm_recurse(base, \"\", perms, counter)\n\n          Then in the recursive subroutine:\n\n            if (len_trim(base) == 0) then   ? But we are using fixed-length strings? Actually, we are passing base as a string of fixed length? We can pass the available characters? And we are building the permutation in the current string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            base: the string of available characters? But we want to remove one character at a time? We can represent base as a string and then remove the i-th character? But Fortran strings are fixed length? We can use:\n\n              new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)\n\n          But we need to know the length of base? We can pass the length of the base string? Actually, we can let the base string be of fixed length (n) and then we track the available part? We can also use an array of characters? \n\n          However, since n is small, we can do:\n\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, ans, perms, counter)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base, ans\n            character(len=*), intent(inout) :: perms(:)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n            integer :: i, n\n            character(len=len(base)) :: new_base   ! note: base might be of length 0?\n            character(len=len(ans)+1) :: new_ans   ! we are going to add one character\n\n            n = len_trim(base)   ? But we don't trim: we are using the entire base? Actually, base might have trailing spaces? We passed base as a string of fixed length? \n\n          How we call initially:\n\n            base = \"1234\"   (for n=4) -> with no trailing spaces? But we defined it as character(len=n). So base is exactly n characters.\n\n          Then in the recursion:\n\n            if (len(base) == 0) then   ? Actually, we are removing one character at a time. When base becomes empty? But we are using fixed length: base has length n throughout? We can use the length of the base that is non-zero? Actually, we can pass the current length? Alternatively, we can use the method: \n\n            if (len_trim(ans) == n) then   -> then we have a full permutation? But initially ans is empty? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do as in Java: \n\n            if (len(base) == 1) then \n                new_ans = ans // base\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = new_ans\n            else\n                do i=1, len(base)\n                    ! take the i-th character\n                    c = base(i:i)\n                    new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)\n                    new_ans = ans // c\n                    call gen_perm_recurse(new_base, new_ans, perms, counter)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          But note: the length of base is decreasing? But in Fortran, the string `new_base` will have length = len(base)-1? We are passing `new_base` as a string of length len(base)-1? But the dummy argument `base` is declared as `character(len=*)`. Then in the next call, the length is set to the actual length? So that works.\n\n          However, we have to define:\n\n            character(len=*) :: base, ans\n\n          and then:\n\n            new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)   -> the length of new_base is (i-1) + (len(base)-i) = len(base)-1.\n\n          And new_ans = ans // c: the length of new_ans is len(ans)+1.\n\n          Initially, base is a string of length n, and ans is a string of length 0? But we have to define ans as a string of length n? Actually, we can define:\n\n            character(len=n) :: ans   ! initially, ans is empty? We can set to all spaces? But we want to build it.\n\n          How about:\n\n            We define the perms array as character(len=n) perms(fact)\n\n            Initially, we call:\n\n                call gen_perm_recurse(base, \"\", perms, counter)\n\n            But then in the recursive call, we do:\n\n                new_ans = ans // c   -> but ans is \"\" (of length 0) and c is a character, so new_ans will be of length 1? But we want the permutation to be of length n? \n\n            We can define:\n\n                ans: as a string of length n? initially, we set it to a string of n spaces? Then we build from left? We can track the position? \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the fixed length for ans? We can pass the current permutation as a string that is being built? But then the perms array must be of strings of length n? So when we have a full permutation, we set perms(counter) = the current ans (which should be of length n). \n\n          We can do:\n\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, current, perms, counter)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base   ! available characters, of length L\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: current   ! the string built so far, of length n - L\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: perms(:)   ! fixed length n for each permutation\n            integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n            integer :: i, L\n            character(len=len(base)) :: new_base   ! will be L-1\n            character(len=len(current)+1) :: new_current   ! will be current + one char -> but we want to build to length n\n\n          But note: the initial current is of length 0? Then new_current will be of length 1? Then next level: 2? ... until n.\n\n          We can set:\n\n            if (len_trim(base) == 0) then   -> no, because base might have spaces? We don't want to use trim? We are using the entire base? Actually, when base is passed with length 0? We can check the length of base? \n\n            L = len(base)\n            if (L == 0) then\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = current   ! but current must be of length n? How?\n            else\n                do i=1, L\n                    new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)\n                    new_current = current // base(i:i)\n                    call gen_perm_recurse(new_base, new_current, perms, counter)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          But the problem: the length of current? We want perms to have strings of length n. Initially, current is \"\" (of length 0). Then we build. But when we assign perms(counter)=current, current must be of length n? We can define current as a string of length n? Initially, it is a string of n spaces? Then we build by replacing the next available space? But that is messy.\n\n          Alternatively, we can predefine the current as a string of length n, and we keep track of the next position? \n\n          We can do without recursion? Since n is small, we can do iterative? \n\n          Actually, we can use the Heap's algorithm? But for simplicity, recursion is acceptable.\n\n          Another idea: we can use a recursive method that passes the current permutation as a string of fixed length n? and an integer `depth` (the next position to fill). Then we don't need to build new strings? We can use a character array? \n\n          But we'll do:\n\n            We maintain the available characters in an array? Actually, we started with a string? We can use a string for base and then remove one character? \n\n          Given the small n, we can do:\n\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, current, perms, counter)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: current   ! we want current to become length n at the end.\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: perms(:)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n            integer :: i, L\n            L = len(base)\n\n            if (L == 0) then\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = current\n            else\n                do i = 1, L\n                    call gen_perm_recurse( base(1:i-1)//base(i+1:L), current//base(i:i), perms, counter )\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          But note: the length of current? Initially, current is \"\" (length 0). Then at the deepest call, current is of length n. But when we assign perms(counter)=current, we are assigning a string of length n? The variable current is of length n? \n\n          How? We can define:\n\n            character(len=*) :: current   -> but we call initially with current of length 0? Then we do current//base(i:i) -> which is a string of length (len(current)+1). Then we pass that to the next call? The next call has current of length 1? \n\n          But the dummy argument `current` is declared as `character(len=*)` so it takes the length from the actual argument. \n\n          However, the perms array is defined as `character(len=n)`. When we assign `perms(counter)=current`, if current is of length less than n, then it will be truncated? Or if longer, then it will take the first n characters? \n\n          We want the permutation to be of length n. So we must have current of length n at the end? \n\n          We can change: we pass a string of length n for current? And we keep track of the next index to fill? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            character(len=n) :: current   ! in the main program, we set current to a string of n spaces? and we have an integer `pos` (the next position to fill). Then we don't use string concatenation? \n\n          We'll do:\n\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, pos, current, perms, counter)\n            character(len=*), intent(in) :: base\n            integer, intent(in) :: pos   ! next position to fill in current (1-indexed: from 1 to n)\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: current   ! the current built permutation (we are filling from 1 to n)\n            character(len=n), intent(inout) :: perms(:)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n            integer :: i, L\n\n            L = len(base)\n            if (L == 0) then\n                counter = counter + 1\n                perms(counter) = current\n            else\n                do i = 1, L\n                    current(pos:pos) = base(i:i)   ! put the i-th character of base at position pos\n                    call gen_perm_recurse( base(1:i-1)//base(i+1:L), pos+1, current, perms, counter)\n                end do\n            end if\n\n          But then we have to initialize current to a string of n spaces? And set pos=1 initially.\n\n          However, note: we are modifying `current` and then passing it down? Then when we backtrack, we need to restore? Actually, we are overwriting the same `current` array? We can do:\n\n            do i=1, L\n                current(pos:pos) = base(i:i)\n                call gen_perm_recurse( ... )\n            end do\n\n          Then after the call, the next iteration will overwrite the same position? But the base is the same? But we are modifying the same current? So we don't need to restore? Because the next iteration will write a new character at the same pos? \n\n          However, when we return to the caller, the current string should be unchanged? But the caller might have filled further positions? Then we are leaving the filled positions? \n\n          Actually, the caller (at a higher level) has filled positions 1 to pos-1? Then we are filling at pos. Then we go deeper and they fill from pos+1 to n. Then when we return, we want to fill the same pos with the next character? And the deeper levels have overwritten the positions beyond pos? But we don't care because we are going to overwrite them again? \n\n          However, we are sharing the same current string? So after the recursive call returns, the current string has the permutation from the deeper call? Then we overwrite the next character at pos? Then we call again? That is acceptable? \n\n          But we must note: the positions beyond pos are undefined? Actually, we are passing the same current to the next call? The next call will write to pos+1 and beyond. Then when we return, we are going to write a new character at pos and then the next call will write from pos+1? So it is okay.\n\n          However, we must initialize the current string? We can set it to all spaces? Then when we build, we fill from 1 to n? \n\n          But the length of base: initially, base is a string of length n? Then we remove one character at a time? So L = len(base) = n, then n-1, ... until 0.\n\n          We can also do without the base string? We can pass an array of characters? But we started with a string.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            Initially:\n                base = \"123...n\"   (string of length n)\n                current = \"\"   -> but we want a string of length n? We can set current = repeat(' ',n)\n                counter = 0\n                call gen_perm_recurse(base, 1, current, perms, counter)\n\n          Then the recursive subroutine:\n\n            module permutations\n            contains\n            recursive subroutine gen_perm_recurse(base, pos, current, perms, counter)\n                character(len=*), intent(in) :: base\n                integer, intent(in) :: pos\n                character(len=len(current)), intent(inout) :: current   ! actually, current has length n, and we want to fill at position pos\n                character(len=len(current)), intent(inout) :: perms(:)\n                integer, intent(inout) :: counter\n\n                integer :: i, L\n                character(len=len(base)) :: new_base   ! will be base without the i-th character\n\n                L = len(base)\n                if (L == 0) then\n                    counter = counter + 1\n                    perms(counter) = current\n                else\n                    do i = 1, L\n                        ! set current at pos to the i-th character of base\n                        current(pos:pos) = base(i:i)\n                        new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:)\n                        call gen_perm_recurse(new_base, pos+1, current, perms, counter)\n                    end do\n                end if\n            end subroutine\n            end module\n\n          But note: when base is empty, we have a full permutation? But we are also when base is empty, we are at pos = n+1? But we don't check pos? \n\n          Alternatively, we can stop when pos > n? But we are also reducing base? \n\n          Actually, we start with base of length n, then at each step we remove one character? So when we have filled n characters, base becomes empty? So we stop.\n\n      Then we have the perms array? Then we sort it? But the Java program does not sort? It generates in a particular order? The recursive method we use is the same as the Java program? \n\n      The Java program:\n\n          permutation(list, target, ans)\n          for i in [0, len(target)-1]:\n              permutation(list, target without the i-th character, ans + target[i])\n\n      And we are doing the same: we iterate i from 1 to L, and we remove the i-th character and append it to the current.\n\n      So the order should be the same? \n\n      Then we search for the two input strings in the perms array? We traverse the array until we find a match? \n\n      Steps for the first program:\n\n          n = ... (read)\n          read 2*n tokens (each a character) -> tokens(2*n)\n\n          str1 = tokens(1:n)   -> concatenate? \n          str2 = tokens(n+1:2*n)\n\n          base = \"\" \n          do i=1, n\n              base = base // char(ichar('0')+i)   ? But the numbers: if n=3, base should be \"123\"\n          How? \n\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base(i:i) = char(ichar('0')+i)   -> but for i=10? we don't need because n<=8.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base = base // achar(ichar('1') + i - 1)   -> for i=1: '1', i=2: '2', etc.\n\n          But simpler: we can create a string of n characters: \n\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base(i:i) = achar(iachar('0')+i)   -> but '0'+1 is '1', etc.\n\n          But wait: for i=1, base(1:1) = '1', but base was of length 0? We must initialize base to a string of length n? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            allocate(character(len=n) :: base)\n            do i=1, n\n                base(i:i) = achar(iachar('0')+i)   -> but when i=10? we don't do that because n<=8.\n\n          Actually, we can set:\n\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base = trim(base) // achar(iachar('0')+i)   -> but that is inefficient? \n\n          Or we can use an array:\n\n            character(len=1) :: arr(n)\n            do i=1, n\n                arr(i) = achar(iachar('0')+i)\n            end do\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base(i:i) = arr(i)\n            end do\n\n          But easier: \n\n            base = \"\"\n            do i=1, n\n                base = base // achar(iachar('0')+i)\n            end do\n\n          Then we compute the factorial of n:\n\n            fact = 1\n            do i=2, n\n                fact = fact * i\n            end do\n\n          Then allocate perms(fact) as character(len=n)\n\n          Then call:\n\n            current = repeat(' ', n)   ! string of n spaces\n            counter = 0\n            call gen_perm_recurse(base, 1, current, perms, counter)\n\n          Then we have the list of permutations in perms.\n\n          Then we search for str1 in perms? and then str2? \n\n          We traverse i from 1 to fact:\n\n            if (perms(i) == str1) then\n                idx1 = i\n            if (perms(i) == str2) then\n                idx2 = i\n\n          Then k = abs(idx1 - idx2)   -> but the Java program does:\n\n                if (sum == 0) then \n                    sum += i   (for the first string)\n                else \n                    sum -= i   (for the second string)\n\n          Then output abs(sum). \n\n          Actually, the Java program:\n\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < line.length; j++) {   // j=0 and j=1\n                for (int i = 0; i < listA.size(); i++) {\n                    if (listA.get(i).equals(line[j][0])) {\n                        if (sum == 0) {\n                            sum += i;\n                        } else {\n                            sum -= i;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            System.out.println(Math.abs(sum));\n\n          So for the first string (j=0) we set sum to the index (say, a), and for the second string (j=1) we set sum = a - b? Then absolute value |a-b|.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            idx1 = -1\n            idx2 = -1\n            do i=1, fact\n                if (perms(i) == str1) then\n                    idx1 = i\n                end if\n                if (perms(i) == str2) then\n                    idx2 = i\n                end if\n            end do\n            k = abs(idx1 - idx2)\n\n          Then we have k.\n\n      Then we convert k to a string? \n\n          write(str_k, *) k   ! This will give a string with leading spaces? \n          Then we take the first non-space character? But the problem: the second program reads the first character of the integer string? That might be a space? \n\n          But in Java, the integer is printed without any extra spaces? The Java program: System.out.println(Math.abs(sum)); \n\n          How about in Fortran: \n\n            write(str_k, '(I0)') k   -> This will write the integer without leading spaces? Then the string str_k has no leading spaces? Then the first character is the first digit.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            character(len=20) :: str_k\n            write(str_k, '(I0)') k\n            c = str_k(1:1)\n\n          Then next_char = achar(iachar(c)+1)\n\n      Then we output:\n\n          write(*, '(I0)') k   ! the integer and then a newline? Actually, the format I0 does not add a newline? We have to add a newline? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            write(*, *) k   ! This adds a newline? But it also adds leading spaces? \n\n          We want no leading spaces? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   ! This outputs the integer without any spaces and without a newline? Then we add a newline? \n\n          Actually, we want to output the integer and then a newline? \n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   ! outputs the integer without newline? Then we do:\n\n            write(*, *)          ! newline? \n\n          But that is two writes? \n\n          Or we can do:\n\n            write(*, '(I0, A)') k, new_line('a')   -> This outputs the integer and then a newline? But new_line('a') is a character? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   ! This outputs the integer and then what? Actually, the format I0 does not include a newline? Then we need to output a newline? \n\n          According to the Fortran standard, each write statement by default ends with a newline? Actually, no: it depends on the compiler? \n\n          Actually, in Fortran, if we do:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k\n\n          This writes the integer and then a newline? \n\n          Let me check: the format I0 is for integers and then the output will advance to the next line? Actually, yes: a write statement with a format and without advance='no' will add a newline.\n\n          So:\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') k   -> outputs the integer without leading spaces and then a newline.\n\n          Then we output the next_char without a newline:\n\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      Then the program.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Summary:\n\n    program chain\n        implicit none\n        integer :: n, i, j, fact, counter, k, idx1, idx2\n        character(len=1) :: tokens(16)   ! 2*n <= 16\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: base, str1, str2\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: current\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: perms(:)   ! array of strings\n        character(len=20) :: str_k\n        character :: c, next_char\n\n        !

Then when we remove one character, new_base = base(1:i-1) // base(i+1:) has length L-1? \n\n  However, the dummy argument base in the recursive call is passed as a string of length L-1? So that works.\n\n  But the length of base in the next call is set to the length of new_base? \n\n  Also, we pass the current string of fixed length n? And we are modifying it? \n\n  We assume that the array perms is of length `fact` and each element is a string of length n.\n\n  Let me test with n=2: \n\n    base = \"12\"\n\n    call gen_perm_recurse(\"12\", 1, current, perms, counter, 2)\n\n        L=2\n        i=1: \n            current(1:1)='1'\n            new_base = base(1:0) // base(2:2) -> \"\" // \"2\" -> \"2\"\n            call gen_perm_recurse(\"2\", 2, current, perms, counter, 2)\n                L=1\n                i=1:\n                    current(2:2)='2'\n                    new_base = base(1:0) // base(2:1) -> \"\" // \"\" -> \"\"\n                    call gen_perm_recurse(\"\", 3, ...)\n                        L=0 -> then counter+1, perms(1)=current (which is \"12\")\n                then i=2: but L=1 -> only i=1\n            then i=2:\n                current(1:1)='2'\n                new_base = base(1:1) // base(3:2) -> \"1\" // \"\" -> \"1\"\n                call gen_perm_recurse(\"1\", 2, ...)\n                    current(2:2)='1'\n                    new_base = \"\" -> then call with base=\"\", then set perms(2)=\"21\"\n\n    So perms = [\"12\", \"21\"]\n\n    Then for str1 and str2: \n        tokens: for example, tokens(1)='1', tokens(2)='2' -> str1=\"12\"\n        tokens(3)='2', tokens(4)='1' -> str2=\"21\"\n\n        idx1 = 1, idx2=2 -> k = abs(1-2)=1.\n\n        Then write str_k='1', then c='1', next_char = '2'\n\n        Output: \n            write(*,*) '1'   -> outputs \"1\\n\"\n            then write(*, advance='no') '2' -> outputs \"2\" without newline.\n\n        So the output is:\n\n            1\n            2\n\n        But without the newline after the 2? Actually, the 2 is at the beginning of the next line? Because the first write ends with a newline? Then the next write writes \"2\" at the beginning of the next line? And then no newline? So the cursor is after the 2? \n\n        The original chain output:\n\n            First program: \"1\\n\"\n            Second program: \"2\" (without newline)\n\n        So the overall output: \"1\\n2\"\n\n        Which is what we have.\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain would have read the string \"1\" (without the newline) because readLine() in Java discards the newline? Then it outputs '2'? Then the console shows:\n\n        1\n        2\n\n        but the 2 is at the beginning of the next line? \n\n  So we are matching.\n\n  However, the second program in the chain outputs the character without newline? And then the program exits? Then the system might add a newline? But we are not? \n\n  We are not adding a newline, so the output is exactly:\n\n        1\n        2\n\n  with the cursor at the end of the 2? \n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Let me run for the example in the first program: \n        n=3\n        first permutation: 1 2 3 -> str1=\"123\"\n        second permutation: 1 3 2 -> str2=\"132\"\n\n        The permutations: \n          123\n          132\n          213\n          231\n          312\n          321\n\n        So index of \"123\" is 1? (in our array starting at 1) -> 1\n        index of \"132\" is 2 -> k = |1-2| = 1 -> same as above.\n\n  But wait: the Java program does:\n\n        for the first string (j=0): \n            finds \"123\" at index i=0 -> then sum = 0 + 0 = 0? \n        then for the second string (j=1): \n            finds \"132\" at index i=1 -> then sum = 0 - 1 = -1 -> abs(1) -> 1.\n\n        In our program, we are using 1-indexed? \n\n        In the Java program, the list is 0-indexed: \n            listA.get(0) = \"123\", listA.get(1)=\"132\", ...\n\n        In our Fortran program, perms(1)=\"123\", perms(2)=\"132\", ... so the indices are 1-indexed.\n\n        Then we compute k = |1-2|=1? \n\n        But the Java program computes |0-1|=1? \n\n        So the answer is the same? \n\n        However, the indices in the Java program are 0-indexed, in our program 1-indexed? But we subtract the same way? The absolute difference is the same? \n\n        So k=1 in both cases.\n\n  Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n  Note: the second program in the chain is only used for its main logic: take the first character of the input string and increment it. We are simulating that by converting the integer k to a string and then taking the first character and incrementing it.\n\n  We output the integer k and a newline, and then the next character without a newline.\n\n  We assume that the integer k is nonnegative? Since it's an absolute value.\n\n  We assume that k has at least one digit? k>=0? and for n>=1, k is at least 0? Then the string representation of k has at least one digit? \n\n  But if k=0? then the string is \"0\", then the next_char = achar(iachar('0')+1) = '1'\n\n  That is acceptable.\n\n  Code accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the factorial computation: \n        fact = 1\n        do i=2, n\n            fact = fact * i\n        end do\n\n  And the recursive subroutine uses the length of base? \n\n  We'll compile and hope it works? \n\n  Since n<=8, we don't worry about performance.\n\n  Let's write the code."
