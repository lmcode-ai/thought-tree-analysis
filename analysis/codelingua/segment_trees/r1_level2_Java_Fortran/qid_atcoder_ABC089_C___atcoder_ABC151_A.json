    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n The first program (atcoder_ABC089_C) reads an integer `n` and then `n` strings. It counts the number of strings that start with 'M', 'A', 'R', 'C', 'H' (only the first character) and then computes the sum of the products of every combination of three distinct counts. It outputs that sum.\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and then outputs the next character (the character with ASCII code one higher than the first character of the input).\n\n However, note: the output of the first program is a number (a long) and the second program expects a string.\n\n But the second program reads a string and then prints the next character. For example, if the input is \"a\", it outputs \"b\".\n\n How to chain?\n The first program outputs a number. The second program expects a string. We have to convert the output of the first program (a number) to a string and use that as the input to the second program.\n\n But note: the second program only reads one line and takes the first character. Then it prints the character that is one ASCII code higher.\n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the output of the first program (a number) is printed as a string (without any extra spaces, just the number) and then that entire string is the input to the second program.\n\n The second program then reads that string and takes the first character and adds 1 to it.\n\n Example:\n   Suppose the first program outputs 123. Then the input to the second program is the string \"123\". The first character is '1', then the next character is the one after '1' which is '2'. So the second program outputs '2'.\n\n But note: the first program may output a very large number? The second program only uses the first character.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n Steps:\n 1. We must read the input for the first program (which is an integer n and then n strings).\n 2. Process the counts and compute the result (as in the first program).\n 3. Convert the result (a long integer) to a string. This string becomes the input for the second program.\n 4. The second program reads the string and takes the first character, then outputs the next character.\n\n But note: the second program in Java uses `s.charAt(0) + 1`. This is an integer addition to the char, then we cast to char? Actually, the `printf` uses `%c` so it prints the character.\n\n Example: if the first program outputs 10, then the string is \"10\", the first character is '1' (which is 49 in ASCII) then 49+1=50 which is '2'. So output is '2'.\n\n However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then the string is \"0\", the first character is '0' (48) then 48+1=49 -> '1'.\n\n But note: the second program in the provided code also has a class `RemRing` which is not used in the main. So we ignore that.\n\n So the entire Fortran program must:\n   - Read the integer `n` and then `n` strings (each string on a separate line? The Java program uses `next()` which reads tokens separated by whitespace).\n   - Count the starting letters (only M, A, R, C, H) and compute the sum of all combinations of three distinct counts (from the five).\n   - Convert the resulting integer to a string.\n   - Take the first character of that string and compute the next character (by converting to its ASCII code, adding one, and converting back to character).\n   - Output that character.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n Therefore, we design:\n\n Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n Step 2: Process to compute the result (the long integer).\n Step 3: Convert the long integer to a string (without I/O in the middle, so we do it in code).\n Step 4: From the string, take the first character and compute the next character.\n Step 5: Output that character.\n\n Important: The Fortran program must not output anything else.\n\n How to convert a number to a string in Fortran? We can use internal write.\n\n Steps in Fortran:\n\n   integer :: n, i\n   character(len=100) :: s  ! for each string read\n   integer, parameter :: k = 5\n   integer(kind=8) :: cnt(5) = 0, res   ! we need long, so use kind=8\n   character(len=100) :: buffer   ! to hold the string representation of res\n   integer :: code, length\n\n   Read n\n   Loop i=1 to n\n      read a string s\n      if the first character is one of 'M','A','R','C','H', then increment the corresponding cnt.\n\n   Then compute res as the sum of all products of three distinct elements from cnt(1:5).\n\n   Then convert res to a string: write(buffer, *) res   -> but this might have leading spaces? We want the exact digits without spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an internal write with a format.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java prints the next character of the first character of the entire string.\n\n   However, the internal write might have leading spaces? We can adjust by trimming, but note that the first character might be a space? Then we skip? \n\n   Actually, the Java program reads the entire line and then takes the first character. So if we have a string with leading spaces, the first character is space.\n\n   But when we write a number, by default it has leading spaces? We can use a format to avoid that? Or we can adjust the string to remove leading spaces? However, the problem says \"behaves identically\". The original first program outputs the number without any extra spaces? In Java, it uses `out.println(res)`, which prints the number and then a newline. But the second program reads a line and then takes the first character (which is the first non-whitespace? Actually, no: `s.charAt(0)` is the very first character of the line).\n\n   So if the number has 10 digits, the string is 10 digits? But when we print a number in Java, it does not have leading spaces? Actually, no: it prints the digits without any leading spaces. However, in Fortran, if we do:\n\n        write(buffer, '(I0)') res\n\n   Then we get the integer without leading spaces.\n\n   But note: the first program in Java prints the number and then a newline. The second program uses `readLine` which reads the entire line including the newline? Actually, no: the `readLine` in Java does not include the newline. So the string `s` is the number without the newline.\n\n   Therefore, we must write the number without any leading spaces and without a newline? But wait: the second program reads a line and then takes the first character. The line is the entire number. So if we write the number without spaces and then a newline, then the string we get for the second program is the number without the newline? Actually, the `readLine` returns the line without the newline.\n\n   However, in Fortran, when we do the internal write, we can write to a string without the newline. Then we take the first character of that string.\n\n   But note: the second program only uses the first character. So we don't care about the rest? But we must form the entire string as the original output of the first program? Then the second program will read the entire string (without newline) and then take the first character.\n\n   So steps for Fortran:\n\n     1. Read n and then n strings (each string is read as a character variable, and we only care about the first character).\n     2. Count the five letters.\n     3. Compute the result as the sum of the products of every combination of three distinct counts (from the five).\n     4. Convert the result to a string without leading spaces and without trailing newline? Actually, we don't need to store the newline because the second program doesn't read it (it uses readLine which discards the newline).\n\n        We can do: write(buffer, '(I0)') res   -> this writes the integer to the buffer without leading spaces and without a newline? Actually, the internal write doesn't add a newline.\n\n        But note: the buffer must be long enough to hold the number. The maximum value of `res`? The counts are at most 10^5, so n<=10^5. The product of three counts could be (10^5)^3 = 1e15 -> 16 digits. So we allocate a string of 20 characters.\n\n     5. Then take the first character of `buffer` (if the string is empty? then we have a problem, but res is at least 0). Then compute the next character.\n\n     6. Print that character.\n\n   However, what if the buffer is empty? That should not happen because res is nonnegative. If res is 0, then the string is \"0\", so the first character is '0'.\n\n   How to get the next character? We can use the IACHAR and ICHAR functions.\n\n        character :: c\n        integer :: ascii_code\n        c = buffer(1:1)\n        ascii_code = ichar(c)\n        ascii_code = ascii_code + 1\n        c = char(ascii_code)\n\n     7. Then print c.\n\n   But note: the second program prints the character and then the program ends. The first Java program prints a newline? The second prints the character without a newline? Actually, the second program uses `System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...)`, which does not add a newline? But then the program exits and the output is flushed? However, in Fortran, we can use:\n\n        write(*, '(A)', advance='no') c   ? \n\n   But the problem says: behaves identically. The original chain: the first program outputs a number and a newline? Then the second program outputs a character without a newline? So the overall output would be:\n\n        [number]\\n[character]\n\n   However, the second program reads the entire line (which is the number and the newline? Actually, no: because the first program prints the number and then a newline. So the second program's `readLine` reads the number without the newline? Actually, `readLine` in Java reads until a newline and returns the string without the newline. So the string `s` is the number without the newline.\n\n   Then the second program prints the next character of the first character of that string. Then the program ends, and the output is the character without a newline.\n\n   So the overall output of the chain is:\n\n        (first program output): \"12345\\n\"\n        (second program output): \"2\"   (if the first character of \"12345\" is '1', then output '2')\n\n   Therefore, the entire output of the chain is:\n\n        \"12345\\n2\"\n\n   But wait, the two programs run separately? So the output of the first program is \"12345\\n\", and then the second program reads \"12345\" (without the newline) and then outputs \"2\". Then the overall output to the console would be:\n\n        \"12345\\n2\"\n\n   However, when we combine into one Fortran program, we are not writing the intermediate newline? Because we are not outputting the number at all. We are only outputting the final character.\n\n   So the entire Fortran program should only output the final character? Then what about the newline? The original chain output has two outputs: the first program outputs a number and a newline, and the second outputs a character without a newline. But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning the same final output? Actually, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\".\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are not to output the intermediate results.\n\n   So the Fortran program should only output the final character? Then the output would be:\n\n        [character]\n\n   without a newline? But the original chain outputs a number and then a newline and then a character? That would be two separate outputs.\n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"the entire sequence\" and \"reproduces the same behavior when run on the same input\". The overall effect of the chain is that the input is transformed to the output of the second program. But note: the first program outputs the number and then the second program outputs the character. So the entire output is the number and the character? Or are we to simulate the entire chain and output only the final result? The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", meaning the intermediate outputs are not shown? Actually, in a chain:\n\n        $ java First | java Second\n\n   Then the output to the console is only the output of the second program? The first program's output is piped to the second, and only the second program's output is shown.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain only outputs the character (without a newline).\n\n   So our Fortran program should only output the character (without a newline).\n\n   But wait: the second program in Java uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not append a newline. So the output is just the character.\n\n   Therefore, the Fortran program should output the character and nothing else.\n\n   However, note: in the first Java program, we are reading from `System.in` and the second from `System.in` (which is the output of the first). But in Fortran, we are going to read the same input as the first program (the integer n and the n strings) and then output the final character.\n\n   So the Fortran program:\n\n        Reads: first the integer n, then n strings (each string on a separate line? or one per line? The Java program uses `next()` which by default uses whitespace. So the input could be:\n\n                5\n                M\n                A\n                R\n                C\n                H\n\n        But note: the input may be on one line? Actually, the first token is the integer, then the next tokens are the strings. They can be on the same line or different lines.\n\n        We'll read the integer and then for i=1 to n, read a string (we don't care about the rest of the string, only the first character).\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        program combined\n          implicit none\n          integer :: n, i\n          character(len=100) :: s\n          integer(kind=8) :: cnt(5) = 0, res\n          character :: c\n          integer :: idx\n          character(len=20) :: buffer   ! to hold the string representation of res\n          integer :: ascii_code\n\n          ! Read n\n          read(*,*) n\n\n          ! Read n strings\n          do i = 1, n\n             read(*,*) s   ! We read the entire token, but we only use the first character\n             if (s(1:1) == 'M') then\n                 cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n             else if (s(1:1) == 'A') then\n                 cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n             else if (s(1:1) == 'R') then\n                 cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n             else if (s(1:1) == 'C') then\n                 cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n             else if (s(1:1) == 'H') then\n                 cnt(5) = cnt(5) + 1\n             end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Compute res: the sum of all combinations of three distinct indices from 1 to 5.\n          res = 0\n          ! There are 10 combinations: (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,2,5), (1,3,4), (1,3,5), (1,4,5), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), (2,4,5), (3,4,5)\n          res = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5) &\n              + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) &\n              + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) &\n              + cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\n          ! Convert res to a string in buffer without leading spaces\n          write(buffer, '(I0)') res   ! I0 means integer with minimum width\n\n          ! Now take the first character of buffer\n          c = buffer(1:1)\n\n          ! Compute the next character\n          ascii_code = ichar(c)\n          ascii_code = ascii_code + 1\n          c = char(ascii_code)\n\n          ! Output the character without a newline? But Fortran by default adds a newline? \n          ! We can use advance='no' to suppress the newline.\n          write(*, '(A)', advance='no') c\n\n        end program combined\n\n   However, note: if the buffer is shorter than we expected? We have buffer of 20 characters, and the number is written from the beginning. But if the number has fewer than 20 digits, the buffer is padded with spaces? Actually, the format '(I0)' writes the integer without leading spaces and without trailing spaces? And then the rest of the buffer is undefined? Actually, when we write to a fixed-length string, the entire string is filled with spaces after the written number? But we are only taking the first character. So if the number is 0, then buffer(1:1) is '0'. If the number is 123, then buffer(1:1) is '1'. But the rest of the buffer is space? But we don't care.\n\n   But what if the number is negative? The problem states that the counts are nonnegative and the result is nonnegative.\n\n   However, one more issue: the buffer might be empty? But res is at least 0, so the string has at least one character.\n\n   Also, if the number has 20 digits? Then buffer must be at least 20. We set it to 20, which is enough for 1e15 (16 digits) and then we are safe.\n\n   But what if the number has more than 20 digits? Then the write will put asterisks? We must avoid that. The maximum value: the maximum count is n (<=10^5). The maximum product is (10^5)^3 = 10^15 -> 16 digits. So 20 is safe.\n\n   Finally, note: the second program in the original chain only uses the first character of the entire output of the first program. So even if the number has 16 digits, we only take the first digit and then add one to it.\n\n   This matches the chain.\n\n   Let me test with a small example:\n\n        Input to the first program:\n            3\n            M\n            A\n            R\n\n        Then cnt(1)=1, cnt(2)=1, cnt(3)=1, others 0.\n        res = 1*1*1 = 1.\n\n        Then the string is \"1\". The first character is '1', then the next character is '2'.\n\n        Output: '2'\n\n   But the original first program would output \"1\\n\", then the second program would read \"1\" and output '2'.\n\n   So the Fortran program outputs '2'.\n\n   Therefore, the code below.\n\n   Important: We use kind=8 for the integers to avoid overflow.\n\n   One more note: the counts are 5 and we are using an array of 5. We use indices 1 to 5 for M,A,R,C,H respectively.\n\n   We'll code accordingly."
