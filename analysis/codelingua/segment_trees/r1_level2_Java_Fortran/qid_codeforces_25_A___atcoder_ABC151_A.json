To be safe, we can read one integer per line? But the problem says the same behavior. The original program reads tokens. Alternatively, we can read the entire line for the array? But the problem does not specify. However, the problem says: \"the same input\". We are reading the same input as the first program. The first program reads tokens. We can do:\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) array(i)\n        end do\n\n  This will read one integer per line. But the input might be on one line? Actually, the original program:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            array[i] = ob.nextInt();\n        }\n\n      This reads tokens: it will read the next integer, skipping any whitespace. So it can be on one line or multiple.",

So there will be at least one even and one odd? But the problem statement is not repeated here. We assume the input guarantees one outlier. Therefore, the above program should work. Let me test with the example: \n        n=5, array = [2,4,7,8,10]\n        even: 2,4,8,10 -> 4 evens, odd: 7 -> 1 odd.\n        odd > even? 1 > 4? false -> then output odd_ind which is 3.\n\n        Convert 3 to string: \"3\"\n        first_char = '3'\n        next_char = char(ichar('3')+1) = '4'\n\n        Output: \n            write(*, '(a)') \"3\"   --> outputs \"3\" and a newline: \"3\\n\"\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '4'   --> outputs '4' without a newline. So the output is: \"3\\n4\"\n\n  The chain would output:\n        First program: 3\\n\n        Second program: 4 So the total output: \"3\\n4\"\n\n  They match. But note: in the example, the second program outputs the next character of the first character of \"3\", which is '4'. That is correct. Another example: \n        n=4, array = [1, 2, 4, 6] \n        odd: 1 -> count=1, even:2,4,6 -> count=3\n        Then we output the odd_ind (because even>odd -> so output the odd_ind which is 1)\n        Convert 1 to string: \"1\"\n        next_char = '2'\n        Output: \"1\\n2\"\n\n  The chain: first outputs \"1\\n\", second outputs '2'.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs to be executed in sequence.\n\nFirst Java program (codeforces_25_A):\n  - Reads an integer `n`\n  - Reads an array of `n` integers\n  - Counts the number of odd and even numbers and records the last index where an odd and even number occurred.\n  - If there are more odd numbers, it prints the index of the even number (which is the outlier) and vice versa.\n\nSecond Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n  - Reads a string (a single line)\n  - Prints the next character in the alphabet (by taking the first character of the string and adding 1 to it)\n\nHowever, note that the output of the first program is an integer (the index) and the second program expects a string (a single character? but note the input in the second program is a string).\n\nBut the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nSo the output of the first program (an integer) becomes the input to the second program? That does not match because the second program expects a string.\n\nBut looking at the second program: it reads a string and then prints the next character. However, if we feed it an integer as a string, then we are reading a string that is a number. For example, if the first program outputs \"3\", then the second program would read the string \"3\", take the first character '3', and then add 1 to get the character '4'. Then it prints '4'.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". However, the two programs are independent and the problem states that the output of the first is the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, we must design the Fortran program as:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (which is: an integer n and then n integers)\n  Step 2: Process the first program to compute the index (an integer)\n  Step 3: Use that index (as an integer) and convert it to a string to feed as input to the second program? \n    But note: the second program expects a string. However, the second program only reads one string and then takes the first character.\n\nBut wait: the second program only uses the first character of the input string. So we must convert the integer index to a string and then take the first character? Actually, the integer might have multiple digits. The second program in the original chain would have been run independently and would have read the entire output of the first program (which is an integer printed on a line). So the string would be the entire integer.\n\nBut the second program only takes the first character of that string. For example, if the first program outputs 25, then the second program would read the string \"25\", then take the first character '2', and then output the next character which is '3'.\n\nHowever, that is not the intended behavior of the chain? Actually, the problem says we are to reproduce the same behavior. But note that the first program outputs an integer (without any extra characters, just the integer) and then a newline. The second program reads one line. So the entire integer is the string.\n\nBut the second program only uses the first character. So if the index is 10, then the string is \"10\", and the first character is '1', then the output would be the next character after '1', which is '2'.\n\nHowever, the original first program might output a number with more than one digit. We must capture the entire integer as a string for the second program.\n\nBut in the Fortran program, we are to combine both. We don't actually output the integer and then read it again. We can pass the integer from the first part to the second part and then convert that integer to a string. Then we take the first character of that string and compute the next character.\n\nHowever, note: the second program in the original code reads a string. The string might be multiple digits. But we are only concerned with the first character.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the array of n integers).\n  Step 2: Compute the index (as an integer) as in the first program.\n  Step 3: Convert that integer to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits) and then take the first character of that string.\n  Step 4: Compute the next character (by adding 1 to the character code of that first character) and output that character.\n\nBut note: the original second program only outputs one character (without a newline? Actually, it uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)` which does not add a newline). But in Fortran, we have to be cautious about newlines.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are to output the same as the chain.\n\nThe chain would output:\n  First program: an integer (with a newline? because in Java `System.out.println` adds a newline) and then the second program outputs a single character (without a newline). So the overall output would be the integer (with newline) and then a character? But wait: the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the integer and the newline. However, the second program uses `readLine` which consumes the entire line (including the newline) and then outputs one character (without a newline). So the final output is just one character.\n\nBut in the combined program, we are skipping the intermediate I/O. The entire chain output is just the output of the second program? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program outputs to stdout, then the second program reads from stdin (which is the first program's output). Then the second program writes to stdout. So the overall stdout is: first program's output and then the second program's output? \n\nBut that would be two outputs: the first program's integer (with newline) and then the second program's character (without newline). However, the problem states: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that the entire Fortran program should output only once? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Ensure that the final Fortran program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\nThe original chain, when run, would produce two outputs: the first program writes and then the second program writes. So the overall output is the concatenation: the integer (with a newline) and then the character (without a newline). But that is two separate outputs.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" \n\nThis is conflicting? \n\nLet me re-read: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\" \n\nSo the entire Fortran program should only read at the beginning and only write at the end. But the chain produces two outputs? \n\nWe have to reinterpret: the entire sequence is to be run as one program. The intermediate outputs (from the first program) are not actually written to the console but are passed as data to the next stage. Therefore, the combined Fortran program should only output the final result (the output of the last program). \n\nBut then what is the input? The input is the original input to the first program. The output is the output of the last program.\n\nTherefore, the chain of two programs:\n\n  Input: the input to the first program (n and the n integers)\n  Output: the output of the second program (a single character)\n\nSo the Fortran program should:\n\n  Read: n and then n integers (from stdin)\n  Process the first program to compute the index (an integer)\n  Then process the second program: convert the index to a string, take the first character, and then compute the next character.\n  Then output that next character (without a newline? But the original second program used `printf` without newline, so we output without newline? However, Fortran typically adds a newline. We have to match the behavior: output exactly one character without a newline? \n\nBut note: the original chain would have output two things: the integer (with newline) and then the character (without). However, the problem says we are to reproduce the same behavior. But the problem also says that the output of the first program is the input to the second. Therefore, the only output that the user sees at the end is the output of the second program? Actually, the entire stdout would have both. \n\nBut the problem states: \"the entire sequence\" and the final Fortran program should behave identically. So we must output the same as the entire chain? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to simulate the chain without intermediate I/O. The problem says: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". So we are not to do I/O in the middle. Therefore, the Fortran program should only output at the end, and that output should be the same as the entire chain? \n\nBut the entire chain outputs two things: the integer (with newline) and then the character. So the Fortran program should output two things? But the problem says only the last block should produce output. How can we output two things at the end? \n\nWe have to output the integer and then the character? But that would be two separate output operations. And the problem says only the last block should output. So we can do two write statements in the last block? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning that we are allowed to output multiple things in the last block? \n\nAlternatively, we must reconsider: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". In the combined program, we don't actually output the intermediate result to the console but pass it as data to the next stage. Therefore, the only output that the user sees is the output of the last program. \n\nSo the first program's output is internal and not written to the console? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain writes two outputs? \n\nThis is ambiguous. However, looking at the examples: the first program is codeforces_25_A which is a problem that finds the position of the outlier in evenness. It outputs one integer (the index) and then the second program takes that integer (as a string) and outputs the next character. \n\nThe overall effect of the chain: \n  Input: \n      5\n      2 4 7 8 10\n  Then the first program outputs: 3 (because 7 is at index 3 and it's the only odd, so the outlier index is 3) and then the second program takes \"3\" and outputs '4'.\n\nBut the user running the chain would see:\n  3\n  4\n\nBut wait, the second program outputs without a newline? So it would be:\n  3\n  4\n\nBut actually, the first program outputs \"3\\n\", then the second program outputs '4'. So the console would show:\n  3\n  4\n\nBut without a newline after the 4, the next prompt might appear on the same line. However, that is the behavior.\n\nBut the problem states: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can only output at the end. How can we output the integer and then the character at the end? \n\nAlternatively, we must output the entire chain output at the end? That is, we output the string \"3\\n4\" (without the quotes). \n\nBut note: the second program does not output a newline. So we have to output:\n  a line with \"3\" and then the character '4' without a newline.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So the output should be identical.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"the entire sequence\" and we are to write a single Fortran program. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will stick to the requirement: the output of the entire Fortran program must be the same as the output of the chain when run on the same input. That is, the output is the integer (with a newline) and then the character (without a newline). \n\nBut how can we do that in Fortran? We can do:\n\n  Write the integer to the console (with a newline) and then write the character without a newline? But the problem says only the last block should output. And we are allowed to do multiple outputs in the last block? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  We are allowed to do one output at the end? But then we have to output two things: the integer and then the character. We can output them in two write statements? But that would be two output operations.\n\nBut the problem does not specify that the last block must have exactly one output statement. It says \"handle producing output\", meaning we can have multiple.\n\nSo plan:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and the array of n integers).\n  Step 2: Compute the index (call it `idx`) as in the first program.\n  Step 3: Now, we have to output two things: \n        First: the integer `idx` (with a newline)  [this is the output of the first program]\n        Second: the next character of the first character of the string representation of `idx` (without a newline) [this is the output of the second program]\n\n  But note: the second program in the chain takes the entire output of the first program (which is the integer and a newline) as a string. Then it takes the first character (which is the first digit of the integer) and adds 1.\n\n  However, what if the integer is negative? The first program only outputs positive indices (since the array indices are from 1 to n). So we can assume nonnegative.\n\n  How to convert the integer to a string in Fortran? We can use internal file output.\n\n  Steps for step 3 (output block):\n\n      a. Convert the integer `idx` to a string. We can do by writing to a character variable.\n      b. Then take the first character of that string? But note: the string might have leading spaces? How does Fortran format integers? \n\n      We want the same string as the first program: just the digits. We can use an internal write without leading spaces? \n\n      Actually, we can use:\n          character(len=20) :: temp\n          write(temp, '(I0)') idx   ! This writes without leading spaces.\n\n      Then the first character of `temp` is the first digit? But note: if the integer is 0, then it writes '0'. \n\n      Then the next character is the character with code = ICHAR(first_character) + 1.\n\n      However, what if the first_character is '9'? Then adding 1 would give ':'? But that's what the Java code does: it adds 1 to the char value. \n\n      Example: if the index is 39, then the string is \"39\", first character is '3', then next is '4'. If the index is 9, then the string is \"9\", first character is '9', then next is ':'.\n\n      But the original second program would do the same: \n          String s = \"9\"; then (char)(s.charAt(0)+1) is ':' (which is the character with ASCII value 58).\n\n      So we do the same.\n\n  Then we output:\n\n        First: write the integer `idx` to stdout (with a newline)  --> but wait, the problem says the last block should output, and we are going to output two things? However, the problem says the entire chain output is the output of the first program and then the second. So we have to output both.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can output both the intermediate result (the integer) and the final result (the character) in the last block? \n\n  However, the problem also says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". But in the combined program, we don't actually output the integer until the end? Then how does the second program get the input? \n\n  We are not simulating the I/O in the middle. We are processing internally. The second program in the chain is replaced by a computation that uses the integer `idx` (from the first part) and then we compute the character. \n\n  But the original second program requires the entire output of the first program (which is a string of the integer and a newline). So to compute the first character, we need the string representation of the integer (without the newline? because the newline is after the integer). The second program's `readLine` reads the entire line (so the integer and the newline) but then we only use the first character (which is the first digit). The newline doesn't matter because it is after the digits? Actually, the first character is the first digit, which is not a newline.\n\n  Therefore, we can ignore the newline for the purpose of taking the first character.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Step 2: Compute the integer `idx`.\n      Step 3: Convert `idx` to a string (without any leading spaces and without a newline) and take the first character.\n\n      Then compute the next character.\n\n      Then output: \n          first, the integer `idx` (with a newline)   --> this is the first program's output\n          then, the computed character (without a newline)   --> this is the second program's output\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we are allowed to output multiple times? Or we can output the two in one go? \n\n  We can output the two in two write statements? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the order of the output. The chain outputs the integer first (with newline) and then the character (without). We can do:\n\n      write(*,*) idx   ! This adds a newline and also might add leading spaces? \n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char( ichar(first_char) + 1 )\n\n  But note: the first write in Fortran (with *) for an integer might add a space at the beginning? \n\n  How to control the formatting? We want exactly the same as the first program: the integer without any extra spaces? \n\n  We can use:\n\n      character(len=20) :: str\n      write(str, '(I0)') idx   ! This gives the integer as a string without spaces.\n\n      Then we can output the string and then the next character:\n\n          write(*, '(a)') trim(str)   ! This outputs the integer and a newline\n          write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char( ichar(str(1:1)) + 1 )\n\n  However, note: the first program outputs the integer and then a newline. The second program then outputs the character without a newline.\n\n  But the combined program: \n      The first write: outputs the integer and a newline.\n      The second write: outputs a single character and then does not advance.\n\n  This matches the chain.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning we can do output only at the end. And we are doing two outputs at the end? That is acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem also says: \"the entire sequence\" and the output must be identical.\n\n  But note: the first program in the chain outputs the integer and a newline. The second program then outputs the character without a newline. So the overall output is:\n\n        [integer]\\n[character] (without a newline after the character)\n\n  And we are doing:\n\n        write(*, '(a)') trim(str)   --> outputs the integer string and then a newline (so we have: [integer]\\n)\n        write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char   --> outputs the character without a newline.\n\n  So the total output is: [integer]\\n[character] \n\n  Exactly as the chain.\n\n  But wait: the first program in the chain outputs the integer without any extra spaces? The Fortran write with '(I0)' and then outputting the string should be the same.\n\n  Example: if idx=3, then the string is \"3\", then we output \"3\\n\" and then the next_char is '4'. So the output is \"3\\n4\".\n\n  If idx=25, then the string is \"25\", then we output \"25\\n\" and then the next_char is the next after '2', which is '3'. So output: \"25\\n3\".\n\n  This matches the chain: the second program in the chain would take the string \"25\" (without the newline? actually the newline is consumed by readLine) and then take the first character '2' and output '3'. So the chain output is \"25\\n3\".\n\n  Therefore, we do:\n\n      Step 1: Read n and the array.\n      Step 2: Find the index (idx) as in the first program.\n      Step 3: \n          Convert idx to a string without leading spaces.\n          next_char = char( ichar( first_character_of_string ) + 1 )\n      Step 4: \n          Output the string representation of idx (which is the integer) and a newline.\n          Output next_char without a newline.\n\n  However, note: the second program in the original code only uses the first character of the entire input string. The entire input string for the second program is the integer and the newline? But the first character is the first digit (so the newline is not the first character). Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  But what if the integer is 0? Then the string is \"0\", and the next character is '1'. \n  What if the integer is negative? The problem states the indices are positive (from 1 to n). So we don't have to worry.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We'll read the integer n and then an array of n integers.\n\n      We'll compute the index (idx) as in the first program.\n\n      Then we convert idx to a string.\n\n      Then we take the first character of that string.\n\n      Then we compute the next character.\n\n      Then we output the string (with a newline) and then the next character (without advancing).\n\n  But note: the Fortran program must not have any extra output.\n\n  However, the first program in the chain outputs the integer and a newline. The second program outputs one character. So we output two things.\n\n  This is acceptable because the problem says the last block should output (and we are outputting both the intermediate and final result in the last block? Actually, the problem says \"the last block\" meaning the last stage? But we are combining and the entire output is at the end).\n\n  Alternatively, we might reinterpret: the entire sequence is to be run as a pipeline, but the combined program only outputs the final result? The problem states: \"the output of the entire sequence\" meaning the output of the last program? \n\n  But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the same behavior\". The chain outputs two things. \n\n  Given the instructions: \"Only the last block should handle producing output\", we are allowed to output the entire chain output (which is two things) in the last block.\n\n  So we proceed.\n\n  One caveat: the first program in the chain outputs the integer without any extra spaces? In Fortran, if we use:\n\n        write(str, '(I0)') idx\n\n      then str will have the integer without any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n      Then we output trim(str) and then a newline? Actually, we can do:\n\n          write(*, '(a)') trim(str)   ! This writes the string and then a newline.\n\n      Then we write the character without a newline.\n\n  But note: the integer might be large? We set the length of the string to 20, which should be enough.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the first program in the chain outputs the integer and then a newline. We are outputting the integer (as a string) and then a newline, which is the same.\n\n  Now, what if the integer is 0? The first program would output \"0\\n\", then the second program would take the first character '0' and output '1'. So we output \"0\\n1\". \n\n  But wait: the first program in the chain: the array indices are from 1 to n, so the index will never be 0. So we are safe.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      integer :: n\n      integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n      integer :: i, odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind, idx\n      character(len=20) :: str\n      character :: first_char, next_char\n\n      read(*,*) n\n      allocate(array(n))\n      read(*,*) (array(i), i=1, n)\n\n      ! Now, note: the original Java array is 1-indexed (from 1 to n). Our Fortran array is 1-indexed by default.\n\n      odd = 0; even = 0; odd_ind = 0; even_ind = 0\n      do i = 1, n\n          if (mod(array(i), 2) == 0) then\n              even = even + 1\n              even_ind = i\n          else\n              odd = odd + 1\n              odd_ind = i\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      if (odd > even) then\n          idx = even_ind\n      else\n          idx = odd_ind\n      end if\n\n      ! Now convert idx to string\n      write(str, '(I0)') idx\n\n      ! Get the first character of str\n      first_char = str(1:1)\n\n      ! Compute the next character\n      next_char = char( ichar(first_char) + 1 )\n\n      ! Output: first the integer (as a string) and a newline, then the next_char without a newline.\n      write(*, '(a)') trim(str)\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n  But note: the original first program outputs the integer and a newline. Then the second program outputs the next_char without a newline. \n\n  However, the Fortran write for the integer: we write the string and then a newline. Then we write the next_char without a newline. \n\n  This matches.\n\n  But what if the string representation of the integer has leading spaces? The format I0 writes without leading spaces.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  However, note: the original first program outputs the integer without any extra spaces. Our method does the same.\n\n  But what if the integer is 10? Then the string is \"10\", and the first character is '1'. Then next_char is '2'. So we output:\n\n        \"10\" and a newline, then '2'\n\n  The chain would have output:\n\n        first program: 10 and a newline -> \"10\\n\"\n        second program: '2'\n\n  So the total output is \"10\\n2\"\n\n  Our program outputs the same.\n\n  Therefore, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the original second program uses `readLine` which would have read the entire line \"10\\n\" and then taken the first character of the line (which is '1')? Yes, because the line is \"10\" (without the newline? actually the readLine removes the newline). So the string s is \"10\", and the first character is '1'. Then next_char is '2'. So the second program outputs '2'.\n\n  Our method: we have the integer 10, convert to string \"10\", take the first character '1', then output the integer string \"10\" and a newline, and then output '2'. \n\n  This matches.\n\n  One more: if the integer is 1, then the string is \"1\", first_char='1', then next_char='2'. Output: \"1\\n2\".\n\n  The chain: first program outputs \"1\\n\", second program outputs '2'. \n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But note: the second program in the original code uses `s.charAt(0)` which is the first character of the string. The string in the second program is the entire line without the newline? Actually, `readLine` returns the line without the newline. So the string is \"1\" (if the integer is 1) and then the first character is '1'. \n\n  However, we are not including the newline in the string representation for the purpose of taking the first character? We are only using the integer converted to a string (without the newline). So we are matching.\n\n  Therefore, we write the Fortran program accordingly.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are not: we are reading at the beginning and printing at the end (in two statements).\n\n  We also note that the RemRing class in the second Java file is unused. So we ignore it.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n\n  Important: We must not forget to allocate the array.\n\n  Also, we assume the input integers are on the same line or one per line? The original first program uses `ob.nextInt()` which reads tokens. So the input can be:\n\n        5\n        2 4 7 8 10\n\n      or\n\n        5\n        2\n        4\n        7\n        8\n        10\n\n  The Fortran read:\n\n        read(*,*) n\n        allocate(array(n))\n        read(*,*) (array(i), i=1, n)\n\n      will work for both: if the next line has all n integers, it reads them; if they are on separate lines, it will read the next n lines? Actually, the second read reads one line and tries to read n integers from that line. If there are not enough, it will continue to the next line? That is compiler dependent? \n\n  To be safe, we can read one integer per line? But the problem says the same behavior. The original program reads tokens.\n\n  Alternatively, we can read the entire line for the array? But the problem does not specify.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"the same input\". We are reading the same input as the first program. The first program reads tokens. We can do:\n\n        do i = 1, n\n            read(*,*) array(i)\n        end do\n\n  This will read one integer per line. But the input might be on one line? \n\n  Actually, the original program:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            array[i] = ob.nextInt();\n        }\n\n      This reads tokens: it will read the next integer, skipping any whitespace. So it can be on one line or multiple.\n\n  In Fortran, we can read the entire array from one line if they are there, but if not, it will read from the next lines. We can do:\n\n        read(*,*) (array(i), i=1, n)\n\n      This will read from the next line(s) until it gets n integers.\n\n  This should match.\n\n  Therefore, we use that.\n\n  Code:\n\n      program combined\n      implicit none\n      integer :: n, i, odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind, idx\n      integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n      character(len=20) :: str\n      character :: first_char, next_char\n\n      ! Read n\n      read(*,*) n\n      allocate(array(n))\n\n      ! Read the array\n      read(*,*) (array(i), i=1, n)\n\n      odd = 0\n      even = 0\n      odd_ind = 0\n      even_ind = 0\n\n      do i = 1, n\n          if (mod(array(i), 2) == 0) then\n              even = even + 1\n              even_ind = i\n          else\n              odd = odd + 1\n              odd_ind = i\n          end if\n      end do\n\n      if (odd > even) then\n          idx = even_ind\n      else\n          idx = odd_ind\n      end if\n\n      ! Convert idx to a string without leading spaces\n      write(str, '(I0)') idx\n\n      ! Get the first character of the string\n      first_char = str(1:1)\n\n      ! Compute the next character\n      next_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\n      ! Output: first the integer string and a newline, then the next_char without a newline.\n      write(*, '(a)') trim(str)\n      write(*, '(a)', advance='no') next_char\n\n      deallocate(array)\n      end program combined\n\n  But note: the original first program uses 1-indexing for the array and the output index. We are using 1-indexing in the do loop and in storing the index. So it's the same.\n\n  However, what if there are no odd numbers or no even numbers? The condition `odd > even` will be true if there are more odd numbers, then we output the even_ind (which might be 0? but the problem states at least one even and one odd? Actually, the problem of codeforces_25_A: it says there is exactly one outlier. So there will be at least one even and one odd? But the problem statement is not repeated here. We assume the input guarantees one outlier.\n\n  Therefore, the above program should work.\n\n  Let me test with the example: \n        n=5, array = [2,4,7,8,10]\n        even: 2,4,8,10 -> 4 evens, odd: 7 -> 1 odd.\n        odd > even? 1 > 4? false -> then output odd_ind which is 3.\n\n        Convert 3 to string: \"3\"\n        first_char = '3'\n        next_char = char(ichar('3')+1) = '4'\n\n        Output: \n            write(*, '(a)') \"3\"   --> outputs \"3\" and a newline: \"3\\n\"\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '4'   --> outputs '4' without a newline.\n\n        So the output is: \"3\\n4\"\n\n  The chain would output:\n        First program: 3\\n\n        Second program: 4\n\n        So the total output: \"3\\n4\"\n\n  They match.\n\n  But note: in the example, the second program outputs the next character of the first character of \"3\", which is '4'. That is correct.\n\n  Another example: \n        n=4, array = [1, 2, 4, 6] \n        odd: 1 -> count=1, even:2,4,6 -> count=3\n        Then we output the odd_ind (because even>odd -> so output the odd_ind which is 1)\n        Convert 1 to string: \"1\"\n        next_char = '2'\n        Output: \"1\\n2\"\n\n  The chain: first outputs \"1\\n\", second outputs '2'. \n\n  Therefore, the Fortran program is:\n\n      [as above]"
