We'll set the length to 100 and hope that the tokens are within 100. But to be safe, we can use:\n\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: color1, color2, u\n\n        However, Fortran 2003 allows deferred-length character, but we don't know the length until we read. We can read the entire line and then split? That might be more complex. Alternatively, we can read the tokens with a large fixed length. Let me stick with fixed length 100.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence.\n The first program (atcoder_ABC154_A) reads:\n   First line: two strings (split by space) -> we'll call them s1 and s2 (but in the code, stored in str[0] and str[1])\n   Second line: two integers (a and b)\n   Third line: a string u\n\n Then, it outputs:\n   If u equals the first string (str[0]), then (a-1) and b\n   Else, a and (b-1)\n\n The second program (atcoder_ABC143_A) reads:\n   One line with two integers (a and b) and computes: c = max(0, a - 2*b)\n\n However, note that the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\n So, the entire chain is:\n   Input for the first program: \n        Line1: two strings (say color names, e.g., \"red blue\")\n        Line2: two integers (say n1, n2)\n        Line3: a string (either the first color or the second)\n\n   The first program outputs two integers: either (n1-1, n2) or (n1, n2-1)\n\n   The second program then takes two integers (the output of the first) and computes max(0, a - 2*b)\n\n But note: the second program expects one line with two integers? Actually, it reads one line and splits.\n\n So, the output of the first program is a single line with two integers (space separated). That becomes the input for the second.\n\n Therefore, the entire process:\n\n   Step 1: \n        Read two strings (call them color1, color2) from first line.\n        Read two integers (a, b) from second line.\n        Read a string (u) from third line.\n\n        If u equals color1, then set: newA = a-1, newB = b.\n        Else (if u equals color2), set: newA = a, newB = b-1.\n\n   Step 2:\n        Now, using (newA, newB) as the two integers for the second program:\n        Compute: c = newA - 2 * newB\n        If c < 0, then c = 0.\n\n   Then output c.\n\n Since the instructions say:\n   - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n We will read all the input at the beginning (three lines: two strings, two integers, and a string) and then do the processing without intermediate I/O.\n\n Steps in Fortran:\n\n   1. Read the first line to get two strings (color1, color2).\n   2. Read the second line to get two integers (a, b).\n   3. Read the third line to get a string (u).\n\n   4. Check if u equals color1 or color2? Then adjust the integers accordingly.\n\n   5. Then compute: result = max(0, adjustedA - 2 * adjustedB)\n\n   6. Print the result.\n\n Note: The original Java programs are independent, but we are chaining them. The first program's output is two integers (without any prompt) and the second program reads two integers from one line.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We need to be cautious about string comparison. In Fortran, we can read the strings and then trim and compare.\n\n   Also, note that the input order: first line has two words (we don't know the length). We can assume they are short.\n\n   We'll read the first line as two separate character variables.\n\n   Example input:\n\n        red blue\n        5 5\n        red\n\n   Then the first program would output: \"4 5\", and the second would then compute: 4 - 2*5 = 4-10 = -6 -> then 0.\n\n   But wait: the second program reads the two integers from one line. So the output of the first is one line: \"4 5\", which the second program splits.\n\n   So we don't need to output the intermediate as a string. We just need to compute the two integers and then use them for the next step.\n\n   Therefore, we skip the intermediate I/O and do:\n\n        adjustedA = a - 1 if u == color1, else a\n        adjustedB = b if u == color1, else b-1\n\n        Then compute: c = adjustedA - 2 * adjustedB\n        c = max(0, c)\n\n   Then output c.\n\n However, note: what if the string u is neither color1 nor color2? The original Java program only checks against the first string (str[0]) and if not, then uses the else branch (so it assumes it's the second). But in the problem context, it's guaranteed to be one of the two? We assume that.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read first line: two strings (color1, color2)\n   Read second line: two integers (a, b)\n   Read third line: one string (u)\n\n   Compare u with color1:\n\n        If they are equal, then:\n            newA = a - 1\n            newB = b\n        Else (we assume it's color2, but note: the problem says the string u is one of the two) then:\n            newA = a\n            newB = b - 1\n\n   Then compute:\n        result = newA - 2 * newB\n        If result < 0 then result = 0\n\n   Print result.\n\n But note: the second program does an integer operation and then prints the integer.\n\n Implementation in Fortran:\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        character(len=20) :: color1, color2, u\n        integer :: a, b, newA, newB, result\n        read(*,*) color1, color2\n        read(*,*) a, b\n        read(*,*) u\n\n   Then compare:\n\n        if (trim(u) == trim(color1)) then\n            newA = a - 1\n            newB = b\n        else\n            newA = a\n            newB = b - 1\n        end if\n\n        result = newA - 2 * newB\n        if (result < 0) result = 0\n\n        write(*,*) result\n\n However, note: the input might have trailing spaces? We use trim for comparison.\n\n But the read statement without format will read the tokens without trailing spaces? Actually, when reading with list-directed input (the * format), the variables are read as tokens (so without leading/trailing spaces). But it's safer to trim.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the length. But the problem says the strings are color names, so we assume they are without internal spaces.\n\n But note: the first line has two tokens. The third line has one token.\n\n We assume the strings are short and we have set the length to 20. If they are longer, we might need to adjust. However, the problem does not specify. We can use a larger length or even use unformatted read and then parse? But the problem says to mimic the behavior.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        character(len=100) :: line\n        read the first line as a whole? But the Java program splits by space. We can read two tokens.\n\n   The above with three read statements should work.\n\n   However, note: the second program (atcoder_ABC143_A) actually reads one line and splits? So the input to the second program is one line with two integers. But we are skipping that by doing the computation internally.\n\n   So we are not writing the integers and then reading them again. We are just using the integers.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n            character(len=100) :: color1, color2, u\n            integer :: a, b, newA, newB, result\n\n            read(*,*) color1, color2\n            read(*,*) a, b\n            read(*,*) u\n\n            if (u == color1) then\n                newA = a - 1\n                newB = b\n            else\n                newA = a\n                newB = b - 1\n            end if\n\n            result = newA - 2 * newB\n            if (result < 0) result = 0\n\n            write(*,*) result\n        end program combined\n\n But note: the string comparison. The variables color1 and u are read without trailing spaces? Actually, the read(*,*) for character variables will read the next non-blank token and assign to the variable, and if the variable is longer, it pads with spaces. So when comparing, we might have:\n\n        color1 = \"red\" -> stored as \"red   ... (spaces to 100)\n        u = \"red\" -> stored as \"red   ... (spaces to 100)\n\n        Then u == color1 -> true? Only if the entire 100 characters match? But we only read \"red\", so the rest are spaces.\n\n        But in Fortran, when you compare two strings of the same length, it compares the entire string. So if both are declared as 100, and both have \"red\" and then 97 spaces, they are equal.\n\n        However, what if the input for u is longer than 100? Then it would be truncated and not match. But the problem doesn't specify. We assume the input tokens are within 100 characters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use trim:\n\n            if (trim(u) == trim(color1)) then\n\n        But note: the first line has two tokens. The first token is color1 and the second is color2. They are read without trailing spaces? Actually, the read(*,*) trims the tokens. So color1 and color2 have the exact string without spaces. Similarly, u has the exact string without spaces.\n\n        However, if the input for u is exactly the same as the first token, but the first token had trailing spaces? No, because read(*,*) for a string token reads until the next space or end of line.\n\n        So we can do without trim? Actually, if the lengths of the strings are different, then the comparison without trim will fail because the shorter one is padded with spaces to the declared length. But we declared all as 100. So:\n\n            u = \"red\" -> becomes 100 characters: 'red' and 97 spaces.\n            color1 = \"red\" -> becomes 100 characters: 'red' and 97 spaces.\n\n            Then u == color1 -> true.\n\n        But if the input for u is \"red \" (with trailing space) then read(*,*) will read only \"red\" and then pad. So same.\n\n        So we can do without trim? Actually, it's safe without because the read statement removes the trailing and leading. The rest is padded with spaces.\n\n        However, what if the first token in the first line is \"red\" and the u is \"red\" (same) but the variable color1 is declared with length 100 and u with 100, then they are both stored as the same. So we can compare without trim.\n\n        But note: what if the first token has exactly 100 characters? Then u must be exactly 100 characters without trailing space? Actually, the read will read exactly the token (without trailing space) and then pad to the length of the variable? No, the read will read the next token (which is at most 100 characters? Actually, it can read more but then it is truncated). We don't know the exact behavior of the Java program for long tokens. But the problem says to behave identically. We assume the tokens are within 100.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the length to a larger value, say 1000? But the problem does not specify. Since the problem is from atcoder, the constraints are small.\n\n        We'll set the length to 100 and hope that the tokens are within 100.\n\n        But to be safe, we can use:\n\n            character(len=:), allocatable :: color1, color2, u\n\n        However, Fortran 2003 allows deferred-length character, but we don't know the length until we read. We can read the entire line and then split? That might be more complex.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read the tokens with a large fixed length.\n\n        Let me stick with fixed length 100.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            program main\n                implicit none\n                character(len=100) :: color1, color2, u\n                integer :: a, b, newA, newB, res\n\n                read(*,*) color1, color2\n                read(*,*) a, b\n                read(*,*) u\n\n                if (u == color1) then\n                    newA = a - 1\n                    newB = b\n                else\n                    newA = a\n                    newB = b - 1\n                end if\n\n                res = newA - 2 * newB\n                if (res < 0) res = 0\n\n                write(*,*) res\n            end program main\n\n        But note: the second program (atcoder_ABC143_A) outputs the integer without any extra spaces? The original Java program: System.out.println(c); That prints the integer and then a newline.\n\n        In Fortran, write(*,*) res will print the integer with a leading space? And then a newline? Actually, the list-directed output (using *) for an integer will print it with a space at the beginning? But the problem does not specify the exact formatting. The judge usually accepts any reasonable formatting. However, to be safe, we can use:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n\n        This will print without leading spaces and then a newline? Actually, the '(I0)' format prints the integer with no leading spaces and then the next output would be on the same line? But we want a newline.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                write(*,*) res   ! This will output a space and then the number, and then a newline.\n\n        But the Java program prints the integer and then a newline. The Fortran write(*,*) will output the integer in a minimal field? Actually, it uses a field that is just enough? But it might add a space at the beginning.\n\n        According to the Fortran standard, list-directed output for an integer will output the integer with at least one space at the beginning? Actually, no: the standard says that the output is in a form that can be read back by list-directed input. For integers, it will be printed without any leading space? Actually, it might have a leading space if the number is positive? Or it might not? This is compiler-dependent.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                print *, res\n\n        But same as write(*,*).\n\n        To mimic exactly the Java output (which is just the integer and then a newline), we can use:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n\n        This will write the integer without any leading or trailing spaces and then the record ends? Actually, no: the format I0 writes the integer without leading spaces and then the next character is written immediately. But we are not adding a newline in the format. So we do:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res   -> no newline?\n\n        Actually, each write statement by default ends with a newline? Or not? In Fortran, the list-directed write(*,*) automatically adds a newline. But for formatted output, we have to add it.\n\n        So:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res   ! does not output a newline\n\n        We can do:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n                ! then we need to output a newline? Or use:\n\n                write(*,'(I0, /)') res   ! This will output the integer and then a newline? But the / is a newline, but then it outputs two newlines? Actually, no: the / in the format means terminate the current record (so one newline). But then the write statement by default also terminates the record? Actually, the write statement outputs one record (which is one line). So without the /, the record ends with the integer and then a newline is added? Actually, no: the entire output of the format is one record. So without a newline, the record would be the integer and then the next write would be on the same line? But the write statement automatically ends the record.\n\n        Correction: In formatted output, the record is defined by the format. When the format ends, the record is ended (so a newline is implied). But actually, the record is ended when the write statement finishes. However, the format I0 does not include a newline, so the record will be the integer without a newline? Then the next write would append? That is not what we want.\n\n        Actually, in Fortran, the write statement with a format string that doesn't include a newline will write the entire output as one record (which might be one line without a newline? That would be problematic). Then the operating system might flush the buffer and show the output without a newline? But the judge expects a newline.\n\n        So we should do:\n\n                write(*, '(I0)') res   -> This writes the integer and then the record is closed? Actually, no: the record is the entire output of the write. But without a newline in the format, it doesn't output a newline. So we have to include a newline.\n\n        We can do:\n\n                write(*, '(I0, /)') res   -> This writes the integer and then a newline? Actually, the / outputs a newline and ends the current record. But then the record is ended again? So we get two newlines? Actually, no: the / is a control edit descriptor that terminates the current record. Then the write statement ends, and that does not add an extra newline. But we are in one record: the format writes the integer and then the / causes a new record (so a newline). Then the write statement ends, but that doesn't add another. So we get the integer and then a newline.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                write(*, '(I0)') res\n                write(*,*) ''   ! to output a newline? But that would output a blank line.\n\n        That is not what we want.\n\n        Actually, the best is:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res   ! This writes the integer without any spaces and then the record ends? Actually, no: the record is just the integer and then the next write will be on the same line? That is not standard. In fact, the record is the entire output of the format. When the format is done, the record is ended. So the integer is written and then the record is ended (which implies a newline). But I'm not sure.\n\n        Let me test with gfortran: when I do write(*,'(I0)') 42, it outputs \"42\" and then a newline.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n\n        This will output the integer and then a newline.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                write(*,*) res   ! which outputs: [space]42[newline] \n\n        The problem says the judge accepts the same behavior. The original Java program outputs: 42\\n\n\n        So both are acceptable? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". The judge usually does not care about leading spaces. But to be safe, we can use the I0 format to avoid the space.\n\n        Given the original Java program does not have a space (it prints the integer without any extra space), we should use I0.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            program main\n                implicit none\n                character(len=100) :: color1, color2, u\n                integer :: a, b, newA, newB, res\n\n                read(*,*) color1, color2\n                read(*,*) a, b\n                read(*,*) u\n\n                if (u == color1) then\n                    newA = a - 1\n                    newB = b\n                else\n                    newA = a\n                    newB = b - 1\n                end if\n\n                res = newA - 2 * newB\n                if (res < 0) res = 0\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n            end program main\n\n However, note: what if the input for the first line has more than two tokens? The Java program uses split and then takes the first token. Our Fortran read will read the first two tokens and ignore the rest? Actually, no: the read(*,*) color1, color2 will read the first two tokens and then if there are more, it will leave them for the next read? But we are reading the next line for a and b. So the first read reads the entire first line? Actually, the first read reads the first line until it has two tokens? If the first line has more than two tokens, the third token will be left in the input buffer? Then the next read for a and b would read the third token? That would be wrong.\n\n How does Fortran handle multiple tokens in one line?\n\n   Example:\n\n        Input:\n            red blue green\n            5 5\n            red\n\n        Then:\n\n            read(*,*) color1, color2   -> color1='red', color2='blue', and the 'green' is left in the first line? Then the next read(*,*) a, b would try to read from the first line? and read 'green' -> error.\n\n        So we must read the entire first line? But the Java program reads the entire first line and then splits by space. So we need to read the first line and then split into tokens? Or we can read the entire first line and then parse? Alternatively, we can read the first line and then use the tokens.\n\n        The problem says: the input for the first program is:\n\n            Line1: two strings (so two tokens)\n            Line2: two integers\n            Line3: one string\n\n        So we assume the first line has exactly two tokens.\n\n        Similarly, the second line has exactly two integers, and the third line has one token.\n\n        Therefore, we assume the input is well-formed.\n\n        So the code above is safe.\n\n        However, to be safe against trailing tokens, we can read the entire line and then split? But that is more complex.\n\n        Since the problem says the input is as expected, we do as above.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            program main\n                implicit none\n                character(len=100) :: color1, color2, u\n                integer :: a, b, newA, newB, res\n\n                ! Read the first line: two strings\n                read(*,*) color1, color2\n                ! Read the second line: two integers\n                read(*,*) a, b\n                ! Read the third line: one string\n                read(*,*) u\n\n                if (u == color1) then\n                    newA = a - 1\n                    newB = b\n                else\n                    newA = a\n                    newB = b - 1\n                end if\n\n                res = newA - 2 * newB\n                if (res < 0) res = 0\n\n                write(*,'(I0)') res\n            end program main\n\n Let me test with the example:\n\n        Input:\n            red blue\n            5 5\n            red\n\n        Step1: \n            color1='red', color2='blue'\n            a=5, b=5\n            u='red'\n\n        Then: u == color1 -> true -> newA=4, newB=5\n        res = 4 - 2*5 = 4 - 10 = -6 -> then set to 0.\n\n        Output: 0\n\n        But the example in the second program: the input to the second program was \"4 5\", then it computed 4-10=-6 -> 0.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            Input:\n                red blue\n                5 5\n                blue\n\n            Then: u != color1 -> else branch: newA=5, newB=4\n            res = 5 - 2*4 = 5-8 = -3 -> 0.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            Input:\n                red blue\n                10 3\n                blue\n\n            Then: newA=10, newB=2 -> res = 10 - 4 = 6 -> output 6.\n\n        So the program should be correct.\n\n        We output the integer without any leading space and then a newline.\n\n        Therefore, the Fortran code is as below."
