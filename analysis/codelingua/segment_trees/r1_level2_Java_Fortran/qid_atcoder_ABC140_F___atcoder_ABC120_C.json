But the problem says \"behaves identically\", which might include the entire state? But Fortran is a different language. We are required to translate the chain. We'll write the simulation for the second program. How to do the stack in Fortran? We can use an array of characters and an integer top pointer. The string we have is either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters). We'll create a character array for the stack, and a variable `top` to indicate the top. Steps for the second program:\n\n        Initialize a stack (array of characters and top=0). For each character in the string (from first to last):\n\n            push: top = top+1, stack(top) = character. Then, while (top>=2) do:\n\n                pop two: \n                    p = stack(top); top = top-1\n                    q = stack(top); top = top-1\n\n                Check if (p,q) is either (p='1' and q='0') or (p='0' and q='1')? If yes, then c = c+1, and we do nothing else (we just removed them, so we continue the while loop with the new top).",

Our inner do while loop does the same. Therefore, we are simulating correctly. But note: the string \"Yes\" has 3 characters: 'Y','e','s'. Step1: push 'Y': stack = ['Y'] -> no while. Step2: push 'e': stack = ['Y','e'] -> then pop 'e' and 'Y': not removable -> push back and break. Step3: push 's': stack = ['Y','e','s'] -> then pop 's' and 'e': not removable -> push back and break. So c=0. Similarly, for \"No\": \n        Step1: push 'N' -> no while. Step2: push 'o' -> pop 'o' and 'N': not removable -> push back and break. So c=0. Therefore, we output 0. Now, we write the Fortran code accordingly. However, note: the second program in the Java code outputs `c * 2`. So we output 0*2 = 0. We'll write the entire program. We must be cautious about the sorting: the original Java sorts the entire array in ascending order. Our sort subroutine does an ascending sort? Our sort: \n            do i=1,n\n                do j=i+1,n\n                    if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then swap -> so it becomes ascending. So that matches. But note: the active list in the first program: the Java code sorts the active list in descending order at the beginning of each iteration. We have a subroutine sort_desc that sorts in descending order? We do: if (arr(i) < arr(j)) swap -> that means we are swapping if the current is less than a later one? Example: [3,1,2] \n            i=1: compare 3 and 1: 3>1 -> no swap? but we want descending so 3,2,1. Actually, our condition: if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then swap -> so for i=1, j=2: 3<1? false -> no swap. j=3: 3<2? false -> no swap. Then i=2: j=3: 1<2 -> true -> swap: becomes [3,2,1]. So it works. But note: performance. The active list grows. The size of active at iteration i is 2^i. The total iterations N is at most 18? so the maximum active size is 2^18 = 262144. The sort_desc uses a bubble sort? That is O(n^2). 262144^2 is about 68 billion comparisons, which is too slow. Therefore, we need a better sort.",

                                                                                                                                                                                "label": "bug_fixing",

Now, the second program: We have input_str = result_str  (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") Then we simulate the stack. But note: the second program in the Java code uses a stack and removes adjacent '0' and '1'. Our string has no '0' or '1', so we know it will do nothing. However, we simulate it as described. But note: the Java code for the second program:\n\n        while (s.size() > 1) {\n            Character p = s.pop();\n            Character q = s.pop();\n            if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1')) {\n                c++;\n                continue;   // meaning we remove them and then check the next top two\n            } else {\n                s.push(q);\n                s.push(p);\n                break;\n            }\n        } In our simulation, we break the inner while loop when the top two are not removable.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine two Java programs into one Fortran program.\n\n The first Java program (atcoder_ABC140_F) does:\n   - Reads an integer N and an array S of size (1 << N)\n   - Sorts the array S in ascending order.\n   - Then it uses a greedy algorithm to check if it is possible to form a sequence of slimes.\n\n The second Java program (atcoder_ABC120_C) does:\n   - Reads a string of 0s and 1s.\n   - Uses a stack to remove adjacent pairs of '0' and '1' (or '1' and '0') and counts the number of removals.\n\n However, note the requirement: the entire sequence of programs is executed in sequence, with the output of the first used as input to the second.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs either \"No\" or \"Yes\", and the second program takes a string of 0s and 1s.\n\n This does not match. Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem statement: \n \"Translate the *entire sequence* into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the two programs are independent and take different inputs.\n\n However, the problem says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So the first program (atcoder_ABC140_F) outputs either \"No\" or \"Yes\". The second program (atcoder_ABC120_C) expects a string of 0s and 1s.\n\n This does not seem to connect. Therefore, I suspect that the two programs are not meant to be chained in this way? Or perhaps the example is flawed.\n\n But let's look again at the provided code:\n\n The first program reads an integer N and then an array of integers of size (1<<N). It then processes and outputs either \"No\" or \"Yes\".\n\n The second program reads a string and then processes it to output an integer (the count of removals multiplied by 2).\n\n There is no obvious connection.\n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n Therefore, the output of the first program (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") would be the input to the second program.\n\n But the second program expects a string of 0s and 1s. However, \"Yes\" and \"No\" are strings. \n\n So the second program would take either \"Yes\" or \"No\" as input.\n\n How does the second program behave on input \"Yes\" or \"No\"?\n\n Let's analyze the second program:\n\n   It uses a stack and counts the pairs of adjacent different characters that can be removed.\n\n   For the string \"Yes\": \n        'Y' (which is not '0' or '1') and then 'e', 's'. The program will push each character. \n        It will check for adjacent pairs that are either ('1','0') or ('0','1')? But the characters are not 0 or 1.\n\n   So the removals would not occur. The count `c` would remain 0, and then output 0.\n\n   Similarly, for \"No\": same thing.\n\n Therefore, the chain would be:\n\n   Input for first program: \n        First integer: N\n        Then, 2^N integers.\n\n   Then the first program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n   Then the second program takes that string and outputs 0 (in both cases).\n\n But this does not make sense. \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the two programs are independent and the chain is not well-defined? \n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". \n\n Another possibility: maybe the example is two separate chains? But the problem says \"a set of Java programs\".\n\n After reconsidering, it's possible that the two programs are part of a sequence that is run multiple times? But the problem does not specify.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" meaning that we have two programs: the first takes input from stdin, produces output which is the input to the second, and the second produces the final output.\n\n Therefore, we must design:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (N and then 2^N integers).\n   Step 2: Run the logic of the first program to get a string result: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n   Step 3: Pass that string as input to the second program.\n   Step 4: The second program will process that string and output an integer (which is 0 in both cases).\n\n However, that is the behavior.\n\n But wait: the second program in the given code outputs an integer (c*2). In our case, c would be 0, so output is 0.\n\n But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if we run the chain on the same input, the original chain would output 0? \n\n How would the original chain be run? \n\n   We would run the first program with the input, which outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then we run the second program with that output as input, and the second program outputs 0.\n\n So the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n But the original first program might output \"No\" and then the second outputs 0. Or it outputs \"Yes\" and then 0.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is: regardless of the first program's result, the final output is 0.\n\n But that seems odd. Why would we chain them then?\n\n Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n It might be that the two programs are independent and are to be run on the same initial input? But that doesn't fit.\n\n Another possibility: the problem intends that the two programs are two steps in a pipeline? But the inputs are different.\n\n After careful thought, I think there might be a mistake in the example. However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\".\n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, but we must follow the specification:\n\n   We have two programs: \n        Program1: reads an integer N and then 2^N integers. Outputs a string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n        Program2: reads a string and then outputs an integer (which is the count of removed pairs * 2).\n\n   The chain: \n        Input: \n            First: integer N and 2^N integers.\n        Then the output of Program1 becomes the input string of Program2.\n\n   So the Fortran program should:\n\n        Step 1: Read the integer N and the array of 2^N integers.\n        Step 2: Process according to the first program to determine the string result (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n        Step 3: Then, use that string as input to the second program.\n        Step 4: The second program processes the string and outputs an integer.\n\n   However, note the requirement: \n        \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\"\n        \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n   So we read all the input at the beginning (both the data for the first program and then we don't have more input for the second? But the second program's input is the output of the first). \n\n   Therefore, we do not read anything else after the initial input.\n\n   We simulate the chain:\n\n        Read N and the array of size 2**N.\n\n        Then we run the first program's logic and get a string: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n        Then we run the second program on that string.\n\n        Then we output the result of the second program.\n\n   But note: the second program in the given code outputs an integer (c * 2). In the case of the string \"Yes\" or \"No\", the second program will output 0.\n\n   However, this does not seem to be the intended meaning? But the problem says to chain them.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the two programs are independent and the chain is not as described? \n\n   Since the problem is stated as above, we must code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        1. Read N.\n        2. Allocate an array of size = 2**N, and read the integers.\n        3. Process the first program: \n             - sort the array\n             - use the algorithm to check if it is possible to form the sequence of slimes.\n        4. If at any point we determine it's impossible, we set the string to \"No\", otherwise \"Yes\".\n        5. Then we have a string: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n        6. Now, we pass this string to the second program's logic.\n\n        The second program:\n             - We have a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n             - We simulate the stack: we traverse the string and use a stack to remove adjacent '0' and '1'? \n               But note: the string does not contain '0' and '1'. It contains letters.\n\n             The second program in the Java code removes adjacent pairs of '0' and '1' (or '1' and '0'). \n             Since the string \"Yes\" and \"No\" do not have any adjacent pair of '0' and '1', the count `c` remains 0.\n\n        7. Therefore, the second program outputs 0 (because c*2 = 0).\n\n        So the entire Fortran program will output 0.\n\n   But wait: what if the first program outputs \"No\", then the second program gets the string \"No\", and then we output 0? \n        The original chain: \n            First program: outputs \"No\"\n            Second program: outputs 0\n\n        So the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n        Similarly, if the first outputs \"Yes\", the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n   This is the same behavior: always 0.\n\n   However, that seems trivial. But it is what the chain does.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we must output 0.\n\n   However, the problem might have intended that the two programs are independent and are run on separate inputs? But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we follow the specification literally.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll have to read N and then 2**N integers.\n\n        Then we simulate the first program to get a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\n        Then we simulate the second program on that string to get an integer (which is 0).\n\n        Then we write that integer (0).\n\n   However, this is inefficient and seems odd, but it's what the chain does.\n\n   But wait: the second program might have a different behavior if the string contained '0' and '1'? But in our case it doesn't.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the second program's simulation and just output 0? \n\n   But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must simulate the second program even though we know the outcome? \n\n   However, the problem does not say we can optimize. We must simulate the chain.\n\n   But note: the requirement: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\"\n\n   So we must simulate the second program without I/O in the middle.\n\n   Steps for the second program:\n\n        We have a string `s` (either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\n        We simulate a stack. We can use an array as a stack.\n\n        We traverse each character in the string:\n\n            push the character to the stack.\n\n            then, while the stack has more than one element, pop the top two and check if they form a removable pair? \n\n            But note: the removable pair is defined as (one being '0' and the other '1')? \n\n            In the Java code: \n                if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1'))\n\n            Since our string does not contain these, we break immediately.\n\n        So the count `c` remains 0.\n\n        Then we output 0.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply set the result of the second program to 0 without doing the simulation? \n\n   But the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", meaning the same steps? \n\n   We'll do the simulation to be safe.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the same internal steps, only the same input-output behavior. But the problem says \"behaves identically\", which might include the entire state? \n\n   But Fortran is a different language. We are required to translate the chain.\n\n   We'll write the simulation for the second program.\n\n   How to do the stack in Fortran?\n\n        We can use an array of characters and an integer top pointer.\n\n   The string we have is either \"Yes\" (3 characters) or \"No\" (2 characters).\n\n   We'll create a character array for the stack, and a variable `top` to indicate the top.\n\n   Steps for the second program:\n\n        Initialize a stack (array of characters and top=0).\n\n        For each character in the string (from first to last):\n\n            push: top = top+1, stack(top) = character.\n\n            Then, while (top>=2) do:\n\n                pop two: \n                    p = stack(top); top = top-1\n                    q = stack(top); top = top-1\n\n                Check if (p,q) is either (p='1' and q='0') or (p='0' and q='1')? \n\n                If yes, then c = c+1, and we do nothing else (we just removed them, so we continue the while loop with the new top).\n\n                If not, we push back q then p, and break the while loop.\n\n        Then move to the next character.\n\n        Then output c*2.\n\n   But note: the Java code does:\n\n        s.push(x.charAt(i));\n        while (s.size()>1) {\n            pop two: p and q.\n            if they are removable, then we remove them and count one removal (so c++), and then we continue the while loop (without pushing back) because we removed two, so we might have a new pair at the top?\n            else, push back and break.\n\n        But note: after removing, the stack has top-2, and then we push the next character? Actually, no: the next character is pushed and then we start the while loop until no more removals.\n\n        So we must simulate the entire while loop until the stack has less than two or we break.\n\n   However, since our string doesn't have any removable pairs, we break immediately in the while loop.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate without worrying about performance.\n\n   But we must do it for correctness.\n\n   So the Fortran program structure:\n\n        program combined\n            implicit none\n\n            !

Subroutine to sort an integer array in ascending order (using bubble sort for simplicity, but note size is 2**N, N up to 18? -> 2^18=262144, so we need efficient? \n        ! But the problem does not specify performance. We'll use a simple sort for now, but note that the original Java uses Arrays.sort which is quicksort or timsort.\n\n        ! We'll use a simple quick sort for integers? Or use the built-in if available? \n        ! Since we are writing standard Fortran, we'll use a simple one.\n\n        subroutine sort(arr, n)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n            integer, intent(in) :: n\n            integer :: i, j, temp\n            do i = 1, n\n                do j = i+1, n\n                    if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n                        temp = arr(i)\n                        arr(i) = arr(j)\n                        arr(j) = temp\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end do\n        end subroutine sort\n\n        subroutine sort_desc(arr, n)\n            integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n            integer, intent(in) :: n\n            integer :: i, j, temp\n            do i = 1, n\n                do j = i+1, n\n                    if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then\n                        temp = arr(i)\n                        arr(i) = arr(j)\n                        arr(j) = temp\n                    end if\n                end do\n            end do\n        end subroutine sort_desc\n\n        end program combined\n\n   However, note: the Java first program uses a list for active and activated. We are using arrays and managing dynamic resizing.\n\n   Also note: the Java first program breaks and outputs \"No\" immediately when it fails to find a next slime. We use a goto to break out.\n\n   But Fortran does not have break for nested loops, so we use a label.\n\n   But note: the first program might have multiple nested loops. We break the outer loop by jumping to a label.\n\n   However, we must deallocate any allocated arrays that are inside the loop? We are deallocating at the end, but if we jump to 100, we skip the rest of the first program and then set result_str to \"No\", and then proceed to the second program.\n\n   We do deallocate at the end of the program.\n\n   But note: the activated and temp_active arrays are allocated inside the loop. If we break in the middle of the loop (when next<1), we might have activated allocated? \n\n   We can avoid that by not activating if we break? Actually, we break in the inner loop over j (the active slimes). We have allocated activated(active_size) at the beginning of the iteration. \n\n   We must deallocate activated when we break? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        if (next < 1) then\n            result_str = \"No\"\n            deallocate(activated)   ! because we break without using it further\n            goto 100\n        end if\n\n   Similarly, we must deallocate activated at the end of each iteration? We do deallocate(activated) at the end of the iteration, but if we break we skip that.\n\n   So we need to deallocate activated when breaking.\n\n   Alternatively, we can restructure without goto? \n\n   We'll add a condition to break the outer loop and then deallocate.\n\n   Let me restructure the first program without goto? \n\n   We can use a flag.\n\n   But for simplicity, we'll use the goto and then deallocate activated if allocated? \n\n   Actually, we break out of the j loop and then the i loop? We set a flag.\n\n   However, the problem is that we want to break out of the entire processing.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            ... \n            do j = 1, active_size\n                ... \n                if (next < 1) then\n                    result_str = \"No\"\n                    exit outer\n                end if\n                ...\n            end do\n            ... \n        end do outer\n\n        if (i <= N) then   ! meaning we exited the outer loop because of failure\n            ! then we have result_str = \"No\"\n        else\n            result_str = \"Yes\"\n        end if\n\n   But we set result_str to \"No\" inside.\n\n   Then we can avoid the goto.\n\n   Let me restructure:\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            ! sort active descending\n            call sort_desc(active, active_size)\n\n            allocate(activated(active_size))\n            activated_size = 0\n            next = size\n\n            do j = 1, active_size\n                do while (next >= 1)\n                    ... \n                end do\n                if (next < 1) then\n                    result_str = \"No\"\n                    exit outer\n                end if\n                ... \n            end do\n\n            ! Merge active and activated\n            ... \n            deallocate(activated)\n        end do outer\n\n        if (i > N) then\n            result_str = \"Yes\"\n        end if\n\n   But note: if we exit the outer loop normally (without break), then i becomes N+1 and we set to \"Yes\".\n\n   But if we break, we have result_str already set to \"No\".\n\n   However, we must deallocate activated in the case of break? \n\n        In the break, we exit the outer loop and activated is still allocated? \n\n        We can deallocate after the exit.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            if (allocated(activated)) deallocate(activated)\n\n        after the outer loop? \n\n        But note: in the normal iteration, we deallocate activated at the end of the loop. But when we break, we skip that deallocation.\n\n        So we must deallocate activated after the outer loop only in the break case? \n\n        Actually, after the outer loop, we don't need activated anymore. We can check if it is allocated and deallocate.\n\n   So:\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            ... \n            do j = 1, active_size\n                ... \n            end do\n            ! if we get here without break, then we have activated_size set and we merge.\n            ... \n            deallocate(activated)   ! at the end of the iteration\n        end do outer\n\n        if (allocated(activated)) then\n            ! This means we broke out and activated is still allocated? \n            deallocate(activated)\n        end if\n\n        if (result_str == \"Yes\") then   ! but we haven't set it to \"Yes\" if we didn't break?\n            ! We set after the loop if we didn't break? \n        else if (result_str == \"No\") then\n            ! already set\n        else\n            ! This should not happen? \n        end if\n\n   Alternatively, we can set result_str to \"Yes\" only at the end and \"No\" in the break.\n\n   And then after the outer loop, if we haven't set result_str, we set it to \"Yes\".\n\n   We'll initialize result_str to an empty string? Or we can set it to \"Yes\" at the beginning and then if we break set to \"No\".\n\n   But we break in the middle, so:\n\n        result_str = \"Yes\"   ! initially assume success\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            ... \n            do j = 1, active_size\n                ... \n                if (next < 1) then\n                    result_str = \"No\"\n                    exit outer\n                end if\n                ... \n            end do\n            ... \n            deallocate(activated)\n        end do outer\n\n        if (allocated(activated)) deallocate(activated)   ! if we broke, deallocate\n\n   Now, we have result_str set.\n\n   But note: we must deallocate activated in the break case.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            allocate(activated(active_size))\n            activated_size = 0\n            next = size\n            do j = 1, active_size\n                ... \n                if (next < 1) then\n                    result_str = \"No\"\n                    exit outer\n                end if\n                ... \n            end do\n            ... \n            deallocate(activated)\n        end do outer\n\n        if (allocated(activated)) deallocate(activated)   ! if we broke, activated is allocated and we deallocate.\n\n   But note: in the break, we are still inside the outer loop, and activated is allocated. Then we break to after the outer loop and then we deallocate activated? \n\n   Yes.\n\n   So we can do that.\n\n   Revised first program part:\n\n        result_str = \"Yes\"\n\n        outer: do i = 1, N\n            call sort_desc(active, active_size)\n\n            allocate(activated(active_size))\n            activated_size = 0\n            next = size\n\n            do j = 1, active_size\n                do while (next >= 1)\n                    if (spawned(next)) then\n                        next = next - 1\n                        cycle\n                    end if\n                    if (S(next) < active(j)) then\n                        exit   ! break the while, we found one\n                    else\n                        next = next - 1\n                    end if\n                end do\n\n                if (next < 1) then\n                    result_str = \"No\"\n                    exit outer\n                end if\n\n                spawned(next) = .true.\n                activated_size = activated_size + 1\n                activated(activated_size) = S(next)\n                next = next - 1\n            end do\n\n            ! Merge active and activated\n            allocate(temp_active(active_size))\n            temp_active = active(1:active_size)\n            deallocate(active)\n            allocate(active(active_size+activated_size))\n            active(1:active_size) = temp_active\n            active(active_size+1:active_size+activated_size) = activated(1:activated_size)\n            active_size = active_size + activated_size\n\n            deallocate(temp_active)\n            deallocate(activated)\n        end do outer\n\n        if (allocated(activated)) deallocate(activated)\n        if (allocated(temp_active)) deallocate(temp_active)   ! though temp_active should be deallocated in the loop, but if break, it might not be allocated in this iteration? \n\n        Actually, temp_active is allocated after the break in the j loop? \n\n        In the break, we haven't allocated temp_active in this iteration? \n\n        So we don't need to deallocate temp_active here.\n\n   But note: the outer loop might break in the middle of an iteration (j loop) and then we haven't allocated temp_active? \n\n        We allocate temp_active after the j loop. So if we break in the j loop, we haven't allocated temp_active.\n\n   So we only deallocate activated if allocated.\n\n   Now, the second program: \n\n        We have input_str = result_str  (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\n        Then we simulate the stack.\n\n   But note: the second program in the Java code uses a stack and removes adjacent '0' and '1'. Our string has no '0' or '1', so we know it will do nothing.\n\n   However, we simulate it as described.\n\n   But note: the Java code for the second program:\n\n        while (s.size() > 1) {\n            Character p = s.pop();\n            Character q = s.pop();\n            if ((p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1')) {\n                c++;\n                continue;   // meaning we remove them and then check the next top two\n            } else {\n                s.push(q);\n                s.push(p);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n   In our simulation, we break the inner while loop when the top two are not removable.\n\n   But note: we are doing a do while (top>=2) and then we pop two and check. If they are removable, we remove them and then the while condition is checked again (with top reduced by 2). \n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, in the Java code, after pushing a new character, they enter a while loop that may remove multiple pairs? \n\n   Our simulation: we push one character, then we enter a while loop that may remove multiple pairs until no more removal? \n\n   But note: the Java code uses a while (s.size()>1) and then pops two. If they are removable, then we remove and then the while loop continues (so we check the new top two). \n\n   Our inner do while loop does the same.\n\n   Therefore, we are simulating correctly.\n\n   But note: the string \"Yes\" has 3 characters: 'Y','e','s'. \n\n        Step1: push 'Y': stack = ['Y'] -> no while.\n        Step2: push 'e': stack = ['Y','e'] -> then pop 'e' and 'Y': not removable -> push back and break.\n        Step3: push 's': stack = ['Y','e','s'] -> then pop 's' and 'e': not removable -> push back and break.\n\n        So c=0.\n\n   Similarly, for \"No\": \n        Step1: push 'N' -> no while.\n        Step2: push 'o' -> pop 'o' and 'N': not removable -> push back and break.\n\n   So c=0.\n\n   Therefore, we output 0.\n\n   Now, we write the Fortran code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the second program in the Java code outputs `c * 2`. So we output 0*2 = 0.\n\n   We'll write the entire program.\n\n   We must be cautious about the sorting: the original Java sorts the entire array in ascending order. Our sort subroutine does an ascending sort? \n\n        Our sort: \n            do i=1,n\n                do j=i+1,n\n                    if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then swap -> so it becomes ascending.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n   But note: the active list in the first program: the Java code sorts the active list in descending order at the beginning of each iteration. \n\n        We have a subroutine sort_desc that sorts in descending order? \n\n        We do: if (arr(i) < arr(j)) swap -> that means we are swapping if the current is less than a later one? \n\n        Example: [3,1,2] \n            i=1: compare 3 and 1: 3>1 -> no swap? but we want descending so 3,2,1.\n            Actually, our condition: if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then swap -> so for i=1, j=2: 3<1? false -> no swap. j=3: 3<2? false -> no swap.\n            Then i=2: j=3: 1<2 -> true -> swap: becomes [3,2,1].\n\n        So it works.\n\n   But note: performance. The active list grows. The size of active at iteration i is 2^i. The total iterations N is at most 18? so the maximum active size is 2^18 = 262144. \n\n        The sort_desc uses a bubble sort? That is O(n^2). 262144^2 is about 68 billion comparisons, which is too slow.\n\n   Therefore, we need a better sort.\n\n   We'll replace with a quick sort or use the Fortran intrinsic? \n\n   But the problem does not specify the constraints. However, to be safe, we'll use a more efficient sort.\n\n   We can use a heap sort? Or we can use the fact that the active list is built from two sorted lists? \n\n        The active list at the beginning of the iteration is the result of merging the previous active (which was sorted descending) and the activated (which we just collected in the order of decreasing S? But note: we are taking S from the largest available that is less than the active slime? \n\n        Actually, the activated array is collected in the order of the active list (which is sorted descending) and then we take the next available slime that is less than the active slime. But the next available slime is taken from the end of the sorted S (which is ascending, so we are taking from high to low). \n\n        However, we are taking for each active slime, the largest available unspawned slime that is strictly less than the active slime. \n\n        But note: we start next at the end of S and then decrement. And we take the first one we find that is less than the active slime. \n\n        But the active slimes are in descending order, so the first active slime is the largest. We then take the largest available unspawned that is less than that active slime. Then the next active slime is the next largest, and we take the next largest unspawned that is less than that, and so on.\n\n        Therefore, the activated array is in descending order? \n\n        Because we are taking for the first active (largest) the largest available unspawned that is less than it, then for the next active (which is the next largest) we take the next largest unspawned that is less than it (which is less than the first activated one? because the active list is descending and the unspawned array is sorted ascending, so we are traversing from the end backwards).\n\n        So the activated array is in descending order.\n\n        Then we merge two descending arrays: the original active (descending) and the activated (descending) -> the merged active is descending? \n\n        But we are simply concatenating: active_size elements (descending) then activated_size elements (descending). This is not necessarily sorted.\n\n        The Java code does: active.sort(Collections.reverseOrder()) at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n        So we must sort at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n        Therefore, we need an efficient sort.\n\n   We'll write a merge sort for the active list? Or use the intrinsic if available? \n\n   Since we are writing in standard Fortran without modules, we'll write a merge sort for the descending order.\n\n   But note: the active list at iteration i has size 2^i. The total number of iterations is N, so the total number of elements over all iterations is 2^(N+1)-1? \n\n   Actually, we are only sorting the active list at the beginning of each iteration. The active list at iteration i has size 2^i. \n\n   The total time is sum_{i=1}^{N} O(2^i * log(2^i)) = O(2^N * N^2) ? \n\n   Actually, the total number of operations is about O(2^N * N) because the size of the list at iteration i is 2^i, and sorting it is O(2^i * log(2^i)) = O(2^i * i). \n\n   Then the total is O( sum_{i=1}^{N} 2^i * i ) = O(2^N * N) [by properties of exponential series].\n\n   Since N is at most 18, 2^N is about 262144, and then 262144 * 18 is about 4.7e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   But we need to implement a sort that is O(n log n). \n\n   We'll implement a merge sort for the active array in descending order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the built-in quicksort from the standard, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in for this? \n\n   We'll write a recursive merge sort? But Fortran doesn't like recursion for large arrays? \n\n   We'll write an iterative merge sort.\n\n   However, due to complexity, and since the problem does not require it, and the original Java uses a sort that is O(n log n), we should do the same.\n\n   But note: the original Java sorts the active list at the beginning of each iteration with Collections.reverseOrder(), which is O(n log n).\n\n   We'll write a merge sort for the active array.\n\n   But to keep the solution within the scope, and since the maximum size is 262144, we can use the merge sort.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same bubble sort for small sizes? But the sizes grow exponentially.\n\n   We'll write a merge sort.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify performance constraints, but we must avoid O(n^2) for 262144.\n\n   We'll implement a merge sort for descending order.\n\n   But note: we are sorting in descending order.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        recursive subroutine merge_sort_desc(arr, n)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer :: mid\n        integer, allocatable :: left(:), right(:)\n        if (n <= 1) return\n        mid = n/2\n        allocate(left(mid))\n        allocate(right(n-mid))\n        left = arr(1:mid)\n        right = arr(mid+1:n)\n        call merge_sort_desc(left, mid)\n        call merge_sort_desc(right, n-mid)\n        call merge_desc(arr, left, right, mid, n-mid)\n        deallocate(left, right)\n        end subroutine\n\n        subroutine merge_desc(arr, left, right, n1, n2)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: left(n1), right(n2)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n1, n2\n        integer :: i, j, k\n        i=1; j=1; k=1\n        do while (i<=n1 .and. j<=n2)\n            if (left(i) >= right(j)) then   ! for descending: we want larger first\n                arr(k) = left(i)\n                i = i+1\n            else\n                arr(k) = right(j)\n                j = j+1\n            end if\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (i<=n1)\n            arr(k) = left(i)\n            i = i+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (j<=n2)\n            arr(k) = right(j)\n            j = j+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        end subroutine\n\n   But note: the active array is stored in contiguous memory. We are using recursion and allocating many times? \n\n   We can do an iterative non-recursive merge sort to avoid recursion overhead? \n\n   But the depth is only 18 (for 262144) so recursion is acceptable.\n\n   However, Fortran may have stack limits.\n\n   We'll do an iterative one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the sort from the first program? But that was bubble sort.\n\n   Due to time, and since this is an example, and the constraints (N<=18, maximum size=262144) are acceptable for a non-recursive merge sort, we'll do a non-recursive.\n\n   But to keep the code simpler, we'll use the intrinsic if available? \n\n   We are not using any modules. \n\n   We'll write a non-recursive merge sort.\n\n   However, the problem is about the entire chain. We decide to use a merge sort for the active array.\n\n   But note: we only need to sort the active array at the beginning of each iteration, and the size is 2^i. \n\n   We'll write a merge sort for the active array in descending order.\n\n   But given the complexity of the entire program, and the fact that the second program is trivial, we decide to use the efficient sort.\n\n   We'll write a non-recursive (bottom-up) merge sort.\n\n   Steps for bottom-up:\n\n        subroutine merge_sort_desc(arr, n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n        integer, allocatable :: work(:)\n        integer :: width, i\n        allocate(work(n))\n        width = 1\n        do while (width < n)\n            do i=0, n-1, 2*width\n                call merge_desc(arr, work, i+1, min(i+width, n), min(i+2*width, n))\n            end do\n            arr = work   ! copy work back to arr? or swap?\n            width = width * 2\n        end do\n        deallocate(work)\n        end subroutine\n\n   But note: we need to merge two consecutive segments: [left, mid) and [mid, right)\n\n   However, we are using 1-indexing.\n\n   We'll write a helper subroutine for merging two adjacent segments.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the recursive one and hope that the stack is deep enough.\n\n   Since the depth is only about 18, we use recursive.\n\n   We'll use the recursive merge sort as described.\n\n   But note: the array sizes are not powers of two? \n\n   It will work.\n\n   We'll add the recursive merge sort to the contains section.\n\n   However, the Fortran standard does not guarantee recursion, but most compilers support it.\n\n   Given the time, we'll use the recursive version.\n\n   Now, we replace the sort_desc call with:\n\n        call merge_sort_desc(active, active_size)\n\n   and then we write the merge_sort_desc and merge_desc as above.\n\n   But note: we are sorting only a part of the array? The active array is of size active_size, and we are passing the entire array and the size.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        call merge_sort_desc(active(1:active_size), active_size)\n\n   But our subroutine takes an array of exactly size n, and we pass active(1:active_size) which is contiguous and of size active_size.\n\n   But the subroutine is defined as:\n\n        recursive subroutine merge_sort_desc(arr, n)\n\n   and then we split the array.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But note: we are passing the entire array? We are passing the slice: active(1:active_size). \n\n   We'll write the subroutine to work on any array of size n.\n\n   Now, the entire program is very long. \n\n   We'll write it as described.\n\n   However, due to the complexity and length, and since this is an example, we might choose to use a simpler sort for small sizes? \n\n   But the sizes can be up to 262144, which is not small.\n\n   We decide to write the merge sort.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the sort from the first program for the entire array? But that was for ascending. \n\n   We can sort in ascending order and then reverse the array? \n\n        call merge_sort_asc(active, active_size)\n        then reverse the array: O(n)\n\n   But we are doing descending.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        call merge_sort_asc(active, active_size)   ! sorts in ascending order\n        then reverse the array.\n\n   But reversing is O(n), and the merge sort is O(n log n), so overall is O(n log n).\n\n   Or we can do the merge sort for descending directly.\n\n   We choose the direct descending.\n\n   Now, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   Due to the length, I provide the entire program with the merge sort.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious about the indices in the merge.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        recursive subroutine merge_sort_desc(arr, n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(n)\n        integer :: mid, i\n        integer, allocatable :: left(:), right(:)\n        if (n <= 1) return\n        mid = n/2\n        allocate(left(mid))\n        allocate(right(n-mid))\n        left = arr(1:mid)\n        right = arr(mid+1:n)\n        call merge_sort_desc(left, mid)\n        call merge_sort_desc(right, n-mid)\n        call merge_desc(arr, left, right, mid, n-mid)\n        deallocate(left, right)\n        end subroutine merge_sort_desc\n\n        subroutine merge_desc(arr, left, right, n1, n2)\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: left(n1), right(n2)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n1, n2\n        integer :: i, j, k\n        i = 1; j = 1; k = 1\n        do while (i <= n1 .and. j <= n2)\n            if (left(i) >= right(j)) then\n                arr(k) = left(i)\n                i = i+1\n            else\n                arr(k) = right(j)\n                j = j+1\n            end if\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (i <= n1)\n            arr(k) = left(i)\n            i = i+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        do while (j <= n2)\n            arr(k) = right(j)\n            j = j+1\n            k = k+1\n        end do\n        end subroutine merge_desc\n\n   This should work.\n\n   We'll include these subroutines in the contains section.\n\n   Now, the entire program is complete.\n\n   But note: the first program also sorts the entire array S in ascending order. We used a bubble sort. We should replace that with merge sort as well? \n\n        The size of S is 2^N, which can be up to 262144. Bubble sort is O(n^2) which is 262144^2 = 68.7 billion, which is too slow.\n\n   Therefore, we must replace the sort for S with an efficient sort.\n\n   We'll use the same merge sort but for ascending order.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        recursive subroutine merge_sort_asc(arr, n)\n        ... \n        in the merge_asc: if (left(i) <= right(j)) then ...\n\n   But to avoid duplication, or we can write one with a comparator? \n\n   Given time, we'll duplicate.\n\n   We'll write two: one for asc and one for desc.\n\n   But note: the active array we sort in desc, and the S array we sort in asc.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        call merge_sort_asc(S, size)\n\n   for the initial sort.\n\n   Now, the program should be efficient.\n\n   Let me write the entire program.\n\n   Due to the length, I hope it's acceptable.\n\n   We'll write it."
