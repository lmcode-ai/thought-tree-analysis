But the code: \n                        ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n                    So it's: i * t * (t+1) / 2. i=1: 1 * 3 * 4 / 2 = 12/2 = 6\n                i=2: 2 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 4/2 = 2\n                i=3: 3 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 6/2 = 3\n                total = 6+2+3 = 11. Output: 11. In our combined program: \n            We compute x=3, then run the second program's loop (without printing) and then run the third program with n1=3 -> ans=11. Then output 11.

But note: the first program's n0 is at most 200, so x is at most 400. So the loop runs at most 400 iterations. This is acceptable. But wait: the original second program (codeforces_58_B) is designed for inputs up to 1000? Actually, the problem constraints for the second program are not given in the code. However, the first program limits n0 to 200, so x is at most 400. Therefore, we are safe. Let me test with the sample: n0=3, s1=\"abc\", str=\"abc\", we got 11. But the original first program: \n        Input: 3 abc abc -> output: 3? Then the second program: input 3 -> outputs \"3\\n1\\n\"\n        Then the third program: input 3 -> outputs 11. So the final output is 11. Our program outputs 11. Another sample: \n        First program: \n            n0=2, s1=\"ab\", str=\"ab\"\n            b = \"abab\"\n            f[1]=0\n            f[2]: j=0, compare b[1] and b[2]: 'a' vs 'b' -> j=0 -> f[2]=0\n            f[3]: j=0, compare b[1] and b[3]: 'a' vs 'a' -> j=1 -> f[3]=1\n            f[4]: j=1, compare b[2] and b[4]: 'b' vs 'b' -> j=2 -> f[4]=2\n            len = min(f[4]=2, 2) = 2\n            x = 2*2 - 2 = 2\n\n        Second program: \n            input=2\n            loop: i=1 -> 2 % 1==0 -> update m=1\n            output: \"2\\n1\\n\"\n\n        Third program: \n            n=2\n            i=1: 1 * (2) * (2+1)/2 = 1*2*3/2 = 3\n            i=2: 2 * (2/2=1) * (1+1)/2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2\n            total=5\n\n        Our program: \n            First part: x=2\n            Second program: loop runs: i=1 -> update m=1 (but we don't use m)\n            Third program: n1=2 -> ans=5. Output: 5. Therefore, the program is correct. We'll write the final C program accordingly. Note: we are using malloc for b and f. But the maximum size is 420, so we can use stack arrays. Let me change to stack arrays to avoid malloc. Also note: the first program uses N=200+10, so we can define:\n\n        #define MAX_N 210\n\n    Then:\n\n        char b[2*MAX_N]; // 1-indexed, so indices 1 to 2*n0 (max 400) -> 2*210=420\n        int f[2*MAX_N];\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        #define MAX_LEN (2 * 210)   // 420 But the n0 is at most 200, so 400 is the maximum cnt. We can do:\n\n        char b[420];\n        int f[420];\n\n    But note: we are using 1-indexing. We'll use indices 1 to 400. However, we can also use 0-indexed for the KMP? But the original Java program is 1-indexed. We'll stick to 1-indexed: so we ignore b[0] and f[0]. We'll use indices 1 to 400. Revised without malloc:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        #define MAX_LEN 420 // 2 * 210\n\n        int min(int a, int b) {\n            return a < b ? a : b;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            int n0;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n0);\n            char s1[210];\n            char str[210];\n            scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n            scanf(\"%s\", str);\n\n            // Arrays for the first program: 1-indexed\n            char b[MAX_LEN];\n            int f[MAX_LEN];\n            int cnt = 0;\n\n            // We are going to use b[1] to b[2*n0]\n            // Skip b[0] and f[0] for 1-indexing? But we can use b[0] as dummy? Actually, we don't use index0 in the KMP loop.\n\n            // Build b: \n            //   We start at index1: so we set b[1] to b[n0] = str[0.. n0-1]\n            //   Then b[n0+1] to b[2*n0] = s1[0..n0-1]\n            // We'll use a counter starting at 1.\n            for (int i = 0; i < n0; i++) {\n                b[i+1] = str[i];   // index1 to n0\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i < n0; i++) {\n                b[n0 + i + 1] = s1[i]; // index n0+1 to 2*n0\n            }\n            cnt = 2 * n0;\n\n            // KMP failure function: for i from 2 to cnt\n            f[1] = 0;\n            int j = 0;\n            for (int i = 2; i <= cnt; i++) {\n                while (j > 0 && b[j+1] ! = b[i]) \n                    j = f[j];\n                if (b[j+1] == b[i]) \n                    j++;\n                else \n                    j = 0; // not necessary, but safe\n                f[i] = j;\n            }\n\n            int len = min(f[cnt], n0);\n            int x = 2 * n0 - len;\n\n            // Second program: \n            int m = x;\n            for (int i = x-1; i > 0; i--) { if (m % i == 0) {\n                    m = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Third program:\n            long long ans = 0;\n            long long n1 = x;\n            for (long long i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {\n                long long t = n1 / i;\n                ans += i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    Note: in the KMP while loop, if j becomes 0 we break. The condition is j>0. So if j becomes 0, we break and then check the if condition? This is the same as the Java program. We'll run the sample again: \"abc\", \"abc\" for n0=3. b[1]='a', b[2]='b', b[3]='c', b[4]='a', b[5]='b', b[6]='c'\n\n        i=2: j=0 -> while condition fails -> then check: b[1] vs b[2]: 'a' vs 'b' -> not equal -> j remains 0 -> f[2]=0.\n        i=3: j=0 -> then check: b[1] vs b[3]: 'a' vs 'c' -> not equal -> j=0 -> f[3]=0.\n        i=4: j=0 -> then check: b[1] vs b[4]: 'a' vs 'a' -> equal -> j=1 -> f[4]=1. i=5: j=1 -> then check: b[2] vs b[5]: 'b' vs 'b' -> equal -> j=2 -> f[5]=2.\n        i=6: j=2 -> then check: b[3] vs b[6]: 'c' vs 'c' -> equal -> j=3 -> f[6]=3. Then len = min(3,3)=3, x= 6-3=3.\n\n    Correct. Therefore, we write the program as above. Note: the array b and f are on the stack and the sizes are fixed (420) which is safe for n0<=200.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into one C program.\n The input will be read only once at the beginning, and the output will be produced at the end.\n We must chain the outputs of the programs as inputs to the next.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_AGC006_A) reads three integers: n, s1, and str (with n, then two strings).\n    However, note that in the first program, the input is:\n        int n = in.nextInt();\n        String s1 = in.next(), str = in.next();\n\n    But the second program (codeforces_58_B) reads a single integer.\n    The third program (atcoder_ABC172_D) also reads a single integer.\n\n 2. The chain:\n    - The first program produces an integer output (2 * n - len) which is a single integer.\n    - This output becomes the input to the second program.\n    - The second program produces a sequence of integers (printed in a line with spaces) but note: the second program prints the input n and then a sequence of divisors in decreasing order (each followed by a space). However, we are only interested in the chain of data? But note: the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n    However, the second program does:\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        then prints a list of numbers.\n\n    But the third program only reads one integer (the first one). So if we run the second program, it outputs multiple integers, but the third program only uses the first one? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". We have to be careful.\n\n    But looking at the original chain, the first program outputs a single integer (and flushes). Then the second program reads that integer and produces multiple integers (each on the same line, separated by spaces). Then the third program is going to read the first integer of that output? However, the third program only reads one integer.\n\n    The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". But note that the original chain is three separate programs. The second program writes to stdout and the third program reads from stdin. So the entire output of the second program is the input to the third? Actually, the third program only reads one integer (the first one from the input). Therefore, the third program would only use the first integer from the second program's output.\n\n    However, the second program's output is:\n        [n] [space] [then a list of numbers each followed by space]\n\n    The first token of that output is the same as the input to the second program? Then the third program will use that first token.\n\n    But note: the second program's output is a sequence of integers. The first token is the same as the input to the second program, which is the output of the first program.\n\n    So the input to the third program is the same as the input to the second program? Then we can skip processing the entire list? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". We are not running separate processes but combining into one. We have to mimic the same data flow.\n\n    But note: the third program only uses the first integer of the second program's output. Therefore, we can note:\n\n        Let the output of the first program be `x`.\n        Then the second program, when run with input `x`, produces an output that starts with `x` and then a space and then a list of divisors. But the third program reads the first integer of the second program's output, which is `x`.\n\n        Therefore, the input to the third program is `x`.\n\n    So the chain is:\n        First: input (n, s1, str) -> output: x (a single integer)\n        Second: input x -> outputs a string that starts with x and then more numbers, but the third program only uses the first integer (which is x) from that string.\n\n        Then the third program: input x -> outputs a long value.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? But wait, what if the second program's output is more than one integer and the third program only reads the first? Then the third program's input is the same as the second program's input.\n\n    However, let me check the second program:\n\n        int n = sc.nextInt();   // reads the first integer (which is the output of the first program, say x)\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints x and a space\n\n        Then it does:\n            int m = n;\n            for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n                if (m % i == 0) {\n                    System.out.println(i + \" \");   // but note: this is println, which prints a newline. However, the example output in the problem? Actually, the sample run might be:\n\n                    Example: if input to second program is 10, then output is:\n                        10 \n                        5 \n                        1 \n\n                    But wait, the program uses println. So it prints:\n                        \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\"\n\n                    Then the third program would read the first integer 10? But the third program uses:\n                        int n = sc.nextInt();\n\n                    That will read the first token, which is 10.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire output of the second program is the input to the third. But the third program only reads one integer. So it reads the first token (which is 10) and ignores the rest.\n\n    Therefore, the input to the third program is the same as the input to the second program.\n\n    So we can skip the second program? Then why the chain? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The entire chain should produce the same final output as if we ran the three programs in sequence. And indeed, the third program's output depends only on the integer that is the output of the first program (because that becomes the input to the second, and then the third reads the same integer from the second's output).\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step1: Run the first program's logic to get x = 2 * n - len (from the first input: n, s1, str)\n        Step2: Then the second program's output is not needed for the third program's input (because the third program will take the same x). But wait: what if the second program had an effect? Actually, the second program does not change the value that the third program uses. So we can ignore the second program? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". And we must mimic the behavior. But note: the second program produces output that we are not using? Actually, the third program only uses the first integer. So the entire chain is:\n\n        Input: (n, s1, str) -> first program -> output: x\n        Then: second program: input x -> outputs a string S (which starts with x and then more tokens)\n        Then: third program: input is the string S -> but only reads the first token (x) -> then outputs a long value.\n\n    Therefore, the final output (the third program's output) is a function of x, which is the output of the first program.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Read the initial input: n, s1, str (as in the first program)\n        Compute x (as the first program does)\n        Then, use x as the input to the third program? But note: the second program is in the chain. However, the second program's output is not used beyond providing the first integer to the third program. And that first integer is x.\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the second program entirely? \n\n    But wait: what if the second program had side effects? None. And we are not required to output the intermediate results. Only the final output.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the entire chain is: the third program outputs a value that depends on x (which is the output of the first program). The second program's output is not used by the third beyond the first token. So we can compute:\n\n        Step1: from the initial input, compute x (using the first program's logic).\n        Step2: then run the third program with input x (which will compute the answer).\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We are allowed to skip the second program if its output is not needed for the final output? However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". The second program's output is the input to the third. But the third only uses the first token. So we can simulate by passing x to the third.\n\n    However, the problem does not say we can skip the second program. We must include it? But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. So we can run the second program without printing, and then extract the first token? But the second program's output is a string of tokens. We only need the first token for the third program. But the first token is the same as the input to the second program.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip running the second program? \n\n    Actually, we must run the second program? But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The second program does not affect the state of the third program beyond providing the integer x. So we can avoid the second program? \n\n    However, let me reexamine: the second program is part of the chain. The problem does not say we can optimize away a program. We must represent the entire sequence.\n\n    But note: the intermediate steps should process data without I/O. So we can run the second program in memory and capture the first token of its output? But the second program's output is a sequence of integers. We don't need the entire output, only the first token for the next program. And the first token is the same as the input. So we can just use the input to the second program as the input to the third program.\n\n    However, what if the second program did not output the same integer as the input? Actually, the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints the input n and a space and then a newline? Actually, it's println which adds a newline.\n\n        Then the rest are printed with println as well. So the first token of the entire output is the integer n (the input to the second program).\n\n    Therefore, the first token is the same as the input.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        x = output of the first program\n        Then the input to the third program is x (because the second program's output starts with x).\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We are allowed to optimize if the behavior is identical? The problem does not require to output the intermediate results. Only the final output.\n\n    However, to be safe, we should run the second program? But without I/O, we can simulate the second program and capture the first token? Actually, the second program's entire output is not needed. We only need the first token for the third program. And the first token is the input to the second program.\n\n    Therefore, we can avoid running the second program? \n\n    But what if the second program had an error? Or what if the second program's output format changed? The problem states the given programs.\n\n    Let me check the second program: it reads an integer and then outputs the same integer and then outputs the divisors. The first token is the integer. So it is safe.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are going to represent the entire sequence in one C program. We are going to do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial input (n, s1, str) and compute x (the output of the first program).\n        Step 2: Then we run the third program with input x? \n\n    But note: the second program is required to be in the chain. The problem says \"translate the entire sequence\". So we must include the second program? But without I/O, we can run the second program in memory? However, the second program's output is a string. We are only going to use the first token of that string for the third program.\n\n    How to do without actual I/O? We can simulate the second program's output in memory and then parse the first token? But the second program's output is a sequence of integers. The first token is the integer we passed in. So we can just use that integer for the third program.\n\n    Alternatively, we can run the second program's logic and store the output tokens? But we don't need the entire list for the third program. We only need the first token. And the first token is the input.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. So we are not allowed to do I/O. We are allowed to do the computation of the second program? But the second program produces output tokens. We only need the first one. And the first one is the input.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    However, the problem says \"entire sequence\". To be safe, we can run the second program's logic and capture the entire output as an array of integers? Then we take the first integer and pass it to the third program? But note: the third program only uses the first integer. So we don't need the entire array.\n\n    But the problem does not require the intermediate outputs to be printed. The final output is the output of the third program.\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial input (n, s1, str) and compute x (from the first program).\n        Step 2: Then we run the third program with input x.\n\n    This would be equivalent because the input to the third program is x.\n\n    But what if the second program's output had multiple tokens and the third program only reads the first? Then we are safe.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the entire chain is:\n\n        Input: (n, s1, str) -> first program outputs x.\n        Then the second program outputs a string that starts with x and then other numbers. Then the third program reads the first token (x) and then computes the result.\n\n    So if we skip the second program, the third program still gets x.\n\n    Therefore, the final C program:\n\n        Reads: \n            an integer n, and two strings s1 and str (as the first program).\n\n        Then:\n            Compute x = 2 * n - len   (using the first program's logic)\n\n        Then:\n            Use x as the input to the third program's logic? \n\n        But note: the third program does:\n\n            int n = sc.nextInt();\n            long ans = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i < n+1; i++) {\n                ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n            }\n            System.out.println(ans);\n\n        So we compute the third program's output with input = x.\n\n        Then output the ans.\n\n    However, wait: the original chain has the second program. The problem says \"entire sequence\". We are missing the second program. But the second program does not affect the input to the third program? \n\n    Therefore, the plan:\n\n        We are going to do:\n\n            Read the initial input: n, s1, str.\n\n            // First program's logic:\n                We have:\n                    int n0 = n;   // the n from the first input\n                    We build an array b of chars: \n                        b[1..n] = str (each char)\n                        b[n+1..2*n] = s1 (each char)\n                    Then run the KMP failure function on b (with length cnt = 2*n) to get f array.\n                    Then x = 2 * n0 - min(f[cnt], min(n0, n0))   // note: the two mins are the same -> min(n0, n0) = n0, so it's min(f[cnt], n0). Then x = 2*n0 - min(f[cnt], n0)\n\n            Then, set N2 = x (this is the output of the first program, which becomes the input to the second and then the first token for the third).\n\n            Then, run the third program's logic with n = N2.\n\n            Then output the result of the third program.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"without I/O\" in the intermediate steps. We are doing all in memory.\n\n    However, the second program is missing. We must run the second program? \n\n    The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We are not allowed to skip a program.\n\n    But the second program does not affect the input to the third? It does, but only by providing the entire output string. However, the third program only reads the first token. And the first token is the same as the input to the second program.\n\n    Therefore, we can simulate the second program by knowing that the first token it outputs is the same as its input. Then we pass that to the third.\n\n    Alternatively, if we are required to run the second program for correctness (even though the output token is the same), we can run the second program without I/O and capture the entire output as a string? Then parse the first integer from that string? But that is inefficient and the problem does not require the intermediate output.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The third program only reads the first integer. So we can just use the input to the second program as the integer for the third.\n\n    But note: what if the second program did not output the integer we expect? It does: the first thing it prints is the integer it read.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    However, to be absolutely safe and follow the requirement of including the entire sequence, we can run the second program's logic and store the tokens it would output? Then take the first token? But the problem does not require the intermediate output to be printed. We only need the first token for the next program.\n\n    How to run the second program without I/O? We can run the loop and store the integers that would be printed? Then we have an array of integers. Then we take the first one? \n\n    But note: the second program does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints the integer n and a space and then a newline? Actually, println adds a newline.\n\n        Then for each divisor it does:\n            System.out.println(i + \" \");   // prints the integer i, then a space and a newline.\n\n    The third program uses a Scanner which by default uses whitespace as delimiters. So the tokens are: [n, i1, i2, ...]\n\n    The first token is n.\n\n    Therefore, we can just take the input n to the second program as the token for the third program.\n\n    So we don't need to run the loop? \n\n    But the problem says: the entire sequence. We are allowed to skip the second program if we can prove the token for the third is the same? \n\n    Alternatively, we can run the second program's logic and store the first token (which is n) and then ignore the rest? \n\n    Since we are not printing the intermediate output, we can run the loop and not store the entire list? We only need the first token. The first token is the input n.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the loop? \n\n    But note: the second program might have side effects? It only does modulus and assignment. We don't care about the rest of the output.\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step1: Read n0, s1, str -> compute x (from the first program)\n        Step2: Set the token for the third program = x (which is the input to the second program and also the first token of the second program's output)\n\n    Then run the third program with n = x.\n\n    This is safe.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"entire sequence\". We are not running the second program. We are only using the input to the second program for the third. \n\n    But the problem does not require the intermediate outputs to be printed. And the final output is the same.\n\n    Therefore, we write the C program as:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        // We'll define the necessary functions: the KMP from the first program and the third program's logic.\n\n        int min(int a, int b) {\n            return a < b ? a : b;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Read the initial input: an integer n, and two strings s1 and str.\n            int n0;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n0);\n            char s1[200+10]; // note: the Java program uses n up to 200, so 200+10\n            char str[200+10];\n            scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n            scanf(\"%s\", str);\n\n            // First program's logic:\n            int N = 200 + 10;\n            int f[2*(200+10)]; // we need up to 2*n0 (max 400) but we have N=210, so we can do 210*2? Actually, the Java program uses N=210 for f and b.\n            char b[2*(200+10)]; // index from 1 to cnt (which is 2*n0)\n\n            // Build b: \n            //   b[1..n0] = str, b[n0+1..2*n0] = s1\n            // Note: the Java program uses 1-indexing for the array b and f.\n            int cnt = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n0; i++) {\n                b[++cnt] = str[i];\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i < n0; i++) {\n                b[++cnt] = s1[i];\n            }\n\n            // KMP failure function on b (1-indexed, from index1 to index cnt)\n            // getFail(char b[], int m)  // m = cnt\n            int j = 0;\n            f[0] = 0; // not used in 1-indexed? The Java program: f[0] and f[1] set to 0, then for i from 2 to m.\n            f[1] = 0;\n            for (int i = 2; i <= cnt; i++) {\n                while (j > 0 && b[j+1] != b[i]) \n                    j = f[j];\n                if (b[j+1] == b[i]) \n                    j++;\n                f[i] = j;\n            }\n\n            int len = min(f[cnt], n0); // because min(n0, n0) is n0, so we take min(f[cnt], n0)\n            int x = 2 * n0 - len;   // output of the first program\n\n            // Now, the second program's input is x. But the second program outputs a list of integers starting with x. \n            // The third program will read the first integer from the second program's output, which is x.\n            // Therefore, we set n1 = x for the third program.\n\n            long long ans = 0;   // because the third program uses long\n            long long n1 = x;    // the input to the third program\n\n            // Third program's logic:\n            for (long long i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {\n                long long t = n1 / i;\n                ans += i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            // Output the answer (as the third program does)\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    However, note: the second program is not included. We are skipping the second program.\n\n    But the problem says: \"entire sequence\". We must include the second program? \n\n    How can we include the second program without I/O? We can run the second program's logic and store the entire output? Then we would have to parse the first token from that output? \n\n    But the second program's output is a sequence of integers. We can run the second program and store the first integer? Actually, the first integer is the input x. So we already have it.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    Alternatively, we can run the second program's loop and then ignore the output? But we don't need the divisors. We only need the first integer which is x.\n\n    Therefore, we do nothing for the second program? \n\n    But note: the problem says \"intermediate steps should process data without I/O\". The second program's processing might be required? However, the second program does not produce any side effect that we use. The only output we use is the first token which is x, and we have x already.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    To be safe and include the entire sequence, we can run the second program's logic and store the first token (which is x) and then the rest we don't care. But we already have x.\n\n    So we do:\n\n        // After computing x, we run the second program's logic to produce the tokens? But we don't need them.\n\n        // Second program's logic:\n        //   int n = x;\n        //   We are going to output: n and then the divisors in decreasing order? But we don't output, we just compute and then take the first token? \n        //   But the first token is n, which is x.\n\n        // Therefore, we do nothing: we have the token x.\n\n    Then we proceed to the third program.\n\n    Therefore, the C program above is complete.\n\n    However, note: the second program's logic might be heavy? But the input x can be as large as 400 (because the first program's n0 is at most 200, so x = 2*200 - min(...) which is at least 200 and at most 400). So the second program runs in O(x) which is 400. We can run it? \n\n    But we don't need the divisors. We only need the first token. So we can skip the loop? \n\n    Alternatively, we can run the loop and not store the divisors? We are allowed to do the computation? But we are not required to output the divisors.\n\n    Since the problem says \"without I/O\", we can run the second program's computation without printing? Then we do nothing with the divisors. But the problem does not require the divisors. \n\n    Therefore, we can skip the loop? \n\n    But the problem says: \"entire sequence\". We are allowed to skip a program if it does not affect the final output? \n\n    After reconsideration, the problem does not require the intermediate outputs to be printed. The entire chain is to be combined without intermediate I/O. The second program's output is not used by the third beyond the first token. So we can avoid storing the entire output of the second program.\n\n    Therefore, we can skip the second program? \n\n    But to strictly follow the requirement of including the entire sequence, we can run the second program's loop and do nothing? \n\n    However, the problem does not require the intermediate output to be printed. So we can run the second program's logic without output? \n\n    We do:\n\n        int m = x;\n        // We don't print, but we run the loop?\n        for (int i = x-1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                // This would be printed in the second program, but we don't print.\n                m = i;   // we do the assignment? \n            }\n        }\n\n    But note: the third program does not use m. And the first token we need is x, which we have. So we can run the loop? It doesn't harm and it is the entire sequence.\n\n    But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The state of the system after the second program is not used. The only thing that matters is the output of the second program (which we are not storing). \n\n    Therefore, we can skip the loop? \n\n    Alternatively, we can run the loop for correctness? But it doesn't affect the state that we use.\n\n    Since the second program's output is not captured beyond the first token, and the first token is the input, we can skip the loop.\n\n    However, to be safe and include the entire sequence, we run the second program's logic without producing output? \n\n    We do:\n\n        // Second program\n        int m = x;\n        // We are not going to print, but we run the loop to update m? \n        for (int i = x-1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                // This would be printed: i, but we don't print. \n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n    But note: the third program does not use m. So we don't care about m after the loop. \n\n    Therefore, we can run it or skip it. It doesn't change the final result.\n\n    But the problem says: \"entire sequence\". We must run the second program? \n\n    We decide to run it to follow the requirement.\n\n    Therefore, the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        int min(int a, int b) {\n            return a < b ?

\n                    But the code: \n                        ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n                    So it's: i * t * (t+1) / 2.\n\n                i=1: 1 * 3 * 4 / 2 = 12/2 = 6\n                i=2: 2 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 4/2 = 2\n                i=3: 3 * 1 * 2 / 2 = 6/2 = 3\n                total = 6+2+3 = 11.\n\n            Output: 11.\n\n        In our combined program: \n            We compute x=3, then run the second program's loop (without printing) and then run the third program with n1=3 -> ans=11.\n\n        Then output 11.\n\n    Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n    However, note: the second program's loop updates m. We do update m, but we don't use m. So it's safe.\n\n    We'll write the C program accordingly.\n\n    One more note: the second program's loop condition: for (int i = x-1; i>0; i--). We do that.\n\n    Code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        // Helper function for min\n        int min(int a, int b) {\n            return a < b ? a : b;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            int n0;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n0);\n            char s1[210]; // 200+10\n            char str[210];\n            scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n            scanf(\"%s\", str);\n\n            // First program: building the array b (1-indexed) of length 2*n0\n            int max_len = 2 * n0 + 10; // we'll allocate a bit more\n            char *b = (char*)malloc(max_len * sizeof(char));\n            int *f = (int*)malloc(max_len * sizeof(int));\n            // We don't use index0 in b and f?

But note: the first program's n0 is at most 200, so x is at most 400. So the loop runs at most 400 iterations.\n\n    This is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: the original second program (codeforces_58_B) is designed for inputs up to 1000? Actually, the problem constraints for the second program are not given in the code. However, the first program limits n0 to 200, so x is at most 400.\n\n    Therefore, we are safe.\n\n    Let me test with the sample: n0=3, s1=\"abc\", str=\"abc\", we got 11.\n\n    But the original first program: \n        Input: 3 abc abc -> output: 3? \n        Then the second program: input 3 -> outputs \"3\\n1\\n\"\n        Then the third program: input 3 -> outputs 11.\n\n    So the final output is 11.\n\n    Our program outputs 11.\n\n    Another sample: \n        First program: \n            n0=2, s1=\"ab\", str=\"ab\"\n            b = \"abab\"\n            f[1]=0\n            f[2]: j=0, compare b[1] and b[2]: 'a' vs 'b' -> j=0 -> f[2]=0\n            f[3]: j=0, compare b[1] and b[3]: 'a' vs 'a' -> j=1 -> f[3]=1\n            f[4]: j=1, compare b[2] and b[4]: 'b' vs 'b' -> j=2 -> f[4]=2\n            len = min(f[4]=2, 2) = 2\n            x = 2*2 - 2 = 2\n\n        Second program: \n            input=2\n            loop: i=1 -> 2 % 1==0 -> update m=1\n            output: \"2\\n1\\n\"\n\n        Third program: \n            n=2\n            i=1: 1 * (2) * (2+1)/2 = 1*2*3/2 = 3\n            i=2: 2 * (2/2=1) * (1+1)/2 = 2*1*2/2 = 2\n            total=5\n\n        Our program: \n            First part: x=2\n            Second program: loop runs: i=1 -> update m=1 (but we don't use m)\n            Third program: n1=2 -> ans=5.\n\n        Output: 5.\n\n    Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n    We'll write the final C program accordingly.\n\n    Note: we are using malloc for b and f. But the maximum size is 420, so we can use stack arrays.\n\n    Let me change to stack arrays to avoid malloc.\n\n    Also note: the first program uses N=200+10, so we can define:\n\n        #define MAX_N 210\n\n    Then:\n\n        char b[2*MAX_N]; // 1-indexed, so indices 1 to 2*n0 (max 400) -> 2*210=420\n        int f[2*MAX_N];\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        #define MAX_LEN (2 * 210)   // 420\n\n    But the n0 is at most 200, so 400 is the maximum cnt.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        char b[420];\n        int f[420];\n\n    But note: we are using 1-indexing. We'll use indices 1 to 400.\n\n    However, we can also use 0-indexed for the KMP? But the original Java program is 1-indexed.\n\n    We'll stick to 1-indexed: so we ignore b[0] and f[0]. We'll use indices 1 to 400.\n\n    Revised without malloc:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        #define MAX_LEN 420 // 2 * 210\n\n        int min(int a, int b) {\n            return a < b ? a : b;\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            int n0;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n0);\n            char s1[210];\n            char str[210];\n            scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n            scanf(\"%s\", str);\n\n            // Arrays for the first program: 1-indexed\n            char b[MAX_LEN];\n            int f[MAX_LEN];\n            int cnt = 0;\n\n            // We are going to use b[1] to b[2*n0]\n            // Skip b[0] and f[0] for 1-indexing?

The condition is j>0. So if j becomes 0, we break and then check the if condition? \n\n    This is the same as the Java program.\n\n    We'll run the sample again: \"abc\", \"abc\" for n0=3.\n\n        b[1]='a', b[2]='b', b[3]='c', b[4]='a', b[5]='b', b[6]='c'\n\n        i=2: j=0 -> while condition fails -> then check: b[1] vs b[2]: 'a' vs 'b' -> not equal -> j remains 0 -> f[2]=0.\n        i=3: j=0 -> then check: b[1] vs b[3]: 'a' vs 'c' -> not equal -> j=0 -> f[3]=0.\n        i=4: j=0 -> then check: b[1] vs b[4]: 'a' vs 'a' -> equal -> j=1 -> f[4]=1.\n        i=5: j=1 -> then check: b[2] vs b[5]: 'b' vs 'b' -> equal -> j=2 -> f[5]=2.\n        i=6: j=2 -> then check: b[3] vs b[6]: 'c' vs 'c' -> equal -> j=3 -> f[6]=3.\n\n        Then len = min(3,3)=3, x= 6-3=3.\n\n    Correct.\n\n    Therefore, we write the program as above.\n\n    Note: the array b and f are on the stack and the sizes are fixed (420) which is safe for n0<=200.\n\n    We are done."
