Actually, the program does:\n\n                for (int i = y0+1; ; i++) {\n                    if (check_leap(i)) \n                        sum += 366;\n                    else \n                        sum += 365;\n                    if (sum % 7 == 0) { if ((check_leap(i) && leap0) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap0)) {\n                            output i and break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } However, note: the condition checks the leap status of the current year i? But the requirement is that the calendar for the year i should start on the same day as the year y0? And also the leap status of i must be the same as y0?",

So we can do:\n\n                // Alternatively, we can accumulate mod7 from the beginning? \n\n                // Actually, we can do without mod: because the condition is total_days % 7 == 0.

So the condition: (is_leap(current) == leap0) is exactly that. Therefore, we can code accordingly. But note: the leap year function: In Java: y % 400 == 0 || ( y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 ! = 0)\n\n   We'll write a helper function:\n\n        int is_leap(int year) { if (year % 400 == 0) return 1;\n            if (year % 100 == 0) return 0;\n            if (year % 4 == 0) return 1;\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Now, what if the starting year is negative?

But the cycle for the leap years is 400? and the week cycle is 7. The combined cycle is 2800? So we might have to iterate at most 2800 years? which is acceptable. But what if the starting year is very big?",

But we need the days from y to i-1? days from y to i-1 = days_in_y + days_in_y+1 + ... + days_in_i-1.

Because 2016 is leap and 2044 is leap? The leap years in 2016 to 2043: \n                2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040 -> 7 leap years? The leap years in 2017 to 2044:\n                2020,2024,...,2040,2044 -> also 7 leap years. So the total days in both periods is the same: 28 years with 7 leap years -> 28*365+7. Therefore, the program's total_days = 28*365+7 = the same as the period we need. So the program is correct? But why? The program's total_days = days from 2017 to 2044 -> but that is the same number of days as from 2016 to 2043? Because: \n            days_in_2016 = 366, and days_in_2044=366. So 366 + (days from 2017 to 2043) = (days from 2017 to 2043) + 366 = (days from 2016 to 2043) [if we include 2016 and exclude 2044] \n            and (days from 2017 to 2044) = (days from 2017 to 2043) + 366. Therefore: \n                days_2016_to_2043 = 366 + (days_2017_to_2043)\n                days_2017_to_2044 = (days_2017_to_2043) + 366\n\n            -> so they are equal. So the program is correct. Therefore, our C code is also correct. Final code: We do the same: \n            total_days_mod = 0\n            for current from y0+1 upwards:\n                add = (is_leap(current) ? 366 : 365;\n                mod = (mod + add) % 7   // or mod = (mod + (add %7)) %7\n\n            Then when mod==0 and is_leap(current)==leap0, break. We output the current as a string. But note: the third program? It outputs the string and then a newline. Therefore, we output the string and a newline. Let me write the code accordingly.",

Then we check: if that mod is 0? no. Then current becomes y0+2. Then we add the days of y0+2: mod = (previous_mod + ...) mod7. So we are not checking the year y0+1 at the first iteration? Actually, the condition is checked after adding the year. So the original program: \n            i = y0+1: add the days of y0+1 -> then check condition. We do the same. But note: the condition for the leap status: we are comparing the leap status of the current year (which is the year we just added) to the leap status of the starting year (y0). Therefore, the algorithm is the same. However, note: the leap status of the starting year y0 is computed at the beginning.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single C program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC171_B) reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers.\n    It sorts the array and sums the first k smallest numbers, then prints the sum.\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_678_B) reads an integer y (a year). It checks if y is a leap year.\n    Then it starts from the next year (y+1) and counts days (sum) until it finds a year that is exactly a multiple of 7 days ahead (so same day of the week) and also has the same leap year status as y. Then it prints that year.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_59_A) reads a word and counts uppercase and lowercase letters.\n    It then converts the entire word to uppercase if there are more uppercase letters, to lowercase if more lowercase, and to lowercase in case of tie.\n\n However, note the sequence: The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But wait: \n   The first program outputs an integer (the sum of the first k numbers). \n   The second program expects a year (an integer) as input.\n   The third program expects a word (a string) as input.\n\n How the chain works:\n   Input for the entire chain: \n        First, the input for the first program: which is n, k, and then n integers.\n   Then the first program outputs an integer (say S).\n   The second program uses S as the input (the year y). \n   Then the second program outputs a year (an integer, say Y).\n   The third program expects a word. But we have an integer? \n\n This mismatch indicates that the chain as described (by feeding the output of one to the next) is broken.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the output of the first program is an integer, and the second program expects an integer (a year). That works.\n The output of the second program is an integer (a year), but the third program expects a string (a word). \n\n This is a problem.\n\n Let me check the original Java programs:\n\n   Program 1: outputs an integer (the sum) and then exits.\n   Program 2: reads an integer (the year) from standard input.\n   Program 3: reads a string (a word) from standard input.\n\n Therefore, the chain must be:\n\n   Input for the entire system: \n        First, the input for program1: n, k, and the n integers. \n        Then, the output of program1 (an integer) is fed as the input to program2. \n        Then, the output of program2 (an integer) is fed as the input to program3.\n\n   But program3 expects a string. So we have to convert the integer output of program2 to a string for program3.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\".\n\n We have to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O. That means:\n\n   We will read the input for the first program (n, k, and the array) at the beginning.\n\n   Then we compute the result of the first program (the sum S).\n\n   Then we use S as the input for the second program (which is the year y). Then we run the second program's logic to compute the next year Y that has the same leap status and lands on the same day of the week.\n\n   Then we use Y (an integer) as the input for the third program. But the third program expects a string. \n\n   However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n   The output of program2 is an integer. So when we feed it to program3, we must convert that integer to a string? \n\n   But note: in the original chain, if we were to run the programs separately, we would do:\n\n        $ java atcoder_ABC171_B < input.txt > temp1.txt\n        $ java codeforces_678_B < temp1.txt > temp2.txt\n        $ java codeforces_59_A < temp2.txt\n\n   The third program would read the integer from temp2.txt as a string? \n\n   Example: if temp2.txt contains the number 2024, then the third program reads the string \"2024\".\n\n   So we have to convert the integer output of the second program to a string, and then pass that string to the third program.\n\n   The third program then counts the uppercase and lowercase letters in that string.\n\n   But note: the string representation of the integer consists only of digits (which are neither uppercase nor lowercase in the usual sense?).\n\n   Actually, in Java, `Character.isUpperCase` and `isLowerCase` are defined for letters. Digits are not letters. \n   So for the string \"2024\", every character is a digit -> neither uppercase nor lowercase. Therefore:\n\n        uppercase = 0\n        lowercase = 0\n\n   Then the condition: \n        if (uppercase > lowercase) -> false\n        else if (lowercase > uppercase) -> false\n        else -> use lowercase (so convert to lowercase)\n\n   But converting a string of digits to lowercase (or uppercase) does nothing.\n\n   Therefore, the third program would output the same string of digits.\n\n   However, let me test: \n        Input: \"2024\" -> uppercase=0, lowercase=0 -> then output word.toLowerCase() -> which is \"2024\".\n\n   So the entire chain would output \"2024\".\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n        Step1: Read n and k and an array of n integers. Compute the sum of the first k smallest -> S.\n        Step2: Use S as the year. Then compute the next year Y (>= S+1) such that the total days from S to Y-1 is a multiple of 7, and Y has the same leap status as S.\n        Step3: Convert the integer Y to a string. Then count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters (which will be 0 for both). Then output the string in lowercase (which is the same as the original string).\n\n   But note: the second program uses the original year (which is S) to check leap status? Actually, the second program:\n\n        It reads an integer y (which is S). Then it sets a variable `leap` for y (whether S is leap).\n        Then it starts from i = S+1 and onwards, until it finds a year i such that:\n            (a) the total days from S to i-1 (i.e., the days in years [S, i-1]) is a multiple of 7.\n            (b) and the leap status of i is the same as that of S.\n\n        Then it outputs i.\n\n   Therefore, we have to do the same.\n\n   How to do without I/O in the middle?\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Read the input for the first program (n, k, array of n integers).\n        Compute S = sum of first k after sorting.\n\n        Then set y0 = S. Then we need to compute the next year Y (>= y0+1) such that:\n            Let `leap0` = is_leap(y0)\n            Then for year i (starting from y0+1, then y0+2, ...), we compute the total days from y0 to i-1 (i.e., the days in each year from y0 to i-1) is a multiple of 7? \n            Actually, the second program does:\n\n                sum = 0\n                for i from y0+1 upwards:\n                    if check_leap(i) then add 366 else add 365\n                    then check if sum % 7 == 0 -> condition on the total offset.\n\n            But note: the program actually accumulates the days from the year y0+1 to the current i? \n\n            Actually, the program does:\n\n                for (int i = y0+1; ; i++) {\n                    if (check_leap(i)) \n                        sum += 366;\n                    else \n                        sum += 365;\n                    if (sum % 7 == 0) {\n                        if ((check_leap(i) && leap0) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap0)) {\n                            output i and break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            However, note: the condition checks the leap status of the current year i? But the requirement is that the calendar for the year i should start on the same day as the year y0? \n            And also the leap status of i must be the same as y0? \n\n            Actually, the problem in codeforces_678_B is: \"New Year and the days of the week are matching again\". The condition for the same leap status is to have the same structure of the year? \n\n            But the problem says: \"if the leap status of the current year i is the same as the leap status of the starting year y0, then we output i\".\n\n            So we do that.\n\n        Step3: Convert the integer Y to a string, then count the uppercase and lowercase (which will be 0) and then output the string.\n\n   However, note: the second program might run for many iterations? But the cycle of the week is 7, so we can break within at most 28 years? (because the leap pattern has a cycle of 28? but actually 400 for the full Gregorian). But the problem does not specify the upper bound. We'll do as the original: iterate until found.\n\n   Implementation in C:\n\n        We will read the first input: n, k, and then an array of n integers.\n\n        Then:\n            sort the array (using qsort) and take the sum of the first k.\n\n        Then set y0 = sum.\n\n        Then compute leap0 = is_leap(y0)   [define a function is_leap]\n\n        Then set sum_days = 0, and then start from i = y0+1 and go on until we find the next year that satisfies:\n            sum_days = (sum_days + (is_leap(i) ? 366 : 365)) % 7;   [but we don't need the full sum, only mod7?]\n            Then check if sum_days % 7 == 0? Actually, we can do mod 7 to keep the numbers small.\n\n            But note: the condition is not only mod7==0, but also the leap status of i must be the same as leap0.\n\n        However, note: the original program does not break immediately when mod7==0? It continues until the leap status condition is also met? \n\n        Actually, the original program breaks only when both conditions are met: mod7==0 and the leap status of i is same as leap0.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            int y = y0;\n            int current = y0 + 1;\n            int total_days = 0;\n            while (1) {\n                if (is_leap(current))\n                    total_days += 366;\n                else\n                    total_days += 365;\n\n                // We can do mod 7 to avoid big numbers? Actually, we care about mod7\n                total_days %= 7;   // but note: we need the exact mod, but adding mod at each step is safe? \n                // However, 366 mod7 = 2, 365 mod7 = 1. So we can do:\n\n                // But let me: 366 % 7 = 2, 365 % 7 = 1. So we can do:\n\n                // Alternatively, we can accumulate mod7 from the beginning? \n\n                // Actually, we can do without mod: because the condition is total_days % 7 == 0. But total_days might be huge? So we do mod7 to avoid overflow.\n\n                if (total_days % 7 == 0) {\n                    if (is_leap(current) == leap0) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                current++;\n            }\n\n        But wait: the original program does not do mod7 at every step? It does:\n\n            if (sum % 7 == 0) { ... }\n\n        But we can do mod7 at every step? Because we only care about mod7.\n\n        However, note: if we do mod7 at every step, then we are effectively keeping the total_days modulo 7. That is safe.\n\n        But: the condition is that the total days mod7 is 0. So we can do:\n\n            total_days_mod = (total_days_mod + (is_leap(current) ? 2 : 1)) % 7;\n\n        Then check if total_days_mod == 0.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            int mod = 0;\n            int current = y0 + 1;\n            while (1) {\n                mod = (mod + (is_leap(current) ? 2 : 1)) % 7;\n                if (mod == 0 && (is_leap(current) == leap0)) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                current++;\n            }\n\n        But note: the leap status of the current year is used in the condition? And we are using the leap status for the year we are adding? \n\n        However, the original program adds the days of the year 'current' and then checks the leap status of 'current'? \n\n        So the above matches.\n\n        But note: the leap status of the starting year y0 is leap0. We require that the current year has the same leap status? \n\n        Why? Because the starting year y0 and the current year must have the same leap status? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the leap status must be the same\" meaning the same as the starting year? \n\n        So we break when mod==0 and (is_leap(current)==leap0).\n\n        Then we have found the year: current.\n\n        Then we convert current to a string.\n\n        Then we count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in that string? But the string is composed of digits -> so both counts are 0.\n\n        Then we output the string in lowercase? which is the same as the original.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply output the integer current? But note: the third program outputs the string in the same case? and since it's digits, we can output the integer as a string.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire chain must produce the same output. The third program outputs the string of the integer.\n\n        So we have to output the integer as a string? But the third program outputs the string without any change (because converting to lowercase does nothing). So we can just output the integer? \n\n        But the third program outputs the string, so we must output the string representation.\n\n        How to output an integer as a string in C? We can use sprintf to convert to a string and then output that string.\n\n        However, note: the third program does not output a newline? Actually, it does: \n            System.out.println(...) -> which outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n        So we must output the string and then a newline.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step1: Read n and k, then n integers.\n        Step2: Sort the array and compute S = sum of first k.\n        Step3: \n            leap0 = is_leap(S);   // Note: S is the year we are starting with.\n\n            Then set current = S+1, mod = 0.\n            while (1) {\n                mod = (mod + (is_leap(current) ? 366 % 7 : 365 % 7)) % 7;\n                // 366 % 7 = 2, 365 % 7 = 1 -> so we can do:\n                // mod = (mod + (is_leap(current) ? 2 : 1)) % 7;\n                if (mod == 0 && is_leap(current) == leap0) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                current++;\n            }\n\n        Step4: Convert the integer current to a string and then output that string (and a newline).\n\n   However, note: the second program might have an off-by-one? \n\n   Let me see: the original program adds the year y0+1, then checks if the total sum mod7 is 0. Then if so and the leap status of y0+1 is the same as y0, then it outputs y0+1.\n\n   But our algorithm: \n        Start at current = y0+1.\n        Then mod = (0 + (is_leap(y0+1)?2:1) mod7 = either 1 or 2.\n        Then we check: if that mod is 0? no. Then current becomes y0+2.\n\n        Then we add the days of y0+2: mod = (previous_mod + ...) mod7.\n\n        So we are not checking the year y0+1 at the first iteration? \n\n        Actually, the condition is checked after adding the year.\n\n        So the original program: \n            i = y0+1: add the days of y0+1 -> then check condition.\n\n        We do the same.\n\n   But note: the condition for the leap status: we are comparing the leap status of the current year (which is the year we just added) to the leap status of the starting year (y0). \n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is the same.\n\n   However, note: the leap status of the starting year y0 is computed at the beginning. The current year in the loop is the candidate for the next year that matches.\n\n   But what if the starting year is leap, and the candidate year is leap? Then we break.\n\n   But note: the leap status of the candidate year must be the same as the starting year? \n\n   Why? Because the starting year's leap status is leap0, and we require the candidate year to have the same leap status? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"if the leap status of the candidate year is the same as the leap status of the starting year\". \n\n   So we break.\n\n   However, the original program does:\n\n        if (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)\n\n   So if leap0 is true, then we break when the candidate is leap? and if leap0 is false, then we break when candidate is not leap.\n\n   So the condition: (is_leap(current) == leap0) is exactly that.\n\n   Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the leap year function: \n        In Java: y % 400 == 0 || (y % 4 == 0 && y % 100 != 0)\n\n   We'll write a helper function:\n\n        int is_leap(int year) {\n            if (year % 400 == 0) return 1;\n            if (year % 100 == 0) return 0;\n            if (year % 4 == 0) return 1;\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Now, what if the starting year is negative? The problem doesn't specify. But the first program's output is a sum of positive integers? So S is positive.\n\n   Also, the second program's input is a year? and the problem says \"year\" so we assume positive.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        // Helper function for leap year\n        int is_leap(int year) {\n            if (year % 400 == 0) return 1;\n            else if (year % 100 == 0) return 0;\n            else if (year % 4 == 0) return 1;\n            else return 0;\n        }\n\n        // Comparison function for qsort\n        int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step1: Read the first input: n and k\n            int n, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n            int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Sort the array\n            qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n\n            // Compute the sum of the first k\n            int S = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n                S += arr[i];\n            }\n            free(arr); // free the array\n\n            // Now S is the year for the next program\n            int y0 = S;\n            int leap0 = is_leap(y0);\n\n            // Now, we are going to find the next year that matches\n            int current = y0 + 1;\n            int mod = 0;\n\n            // Note: we break when we find a year that has mod==0 and same leap status as y0.\n            while (1) {\n                // Add the days of the year 'current'\n                if (is_leap(current)) {\n                    mod = (mod + 2) % 7; // because 366 mod7 = 2\n                } else {\n                    mod = (mod + 1) % 7; // 365 mod7 = 1\n                }\n\n                // Check condition\n                if (mod == 0 && is_leap(current) == leap0) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                current++;\n            }\n\n            // Now current is the result of the second program\n\n            // Step3: We need to pass current as a string to the third program logic.\n\n            // But the third program: \n            //   It counts uppercase and lowercase. Since the string of current has only digits, both counts are 0.\n            //   Then it outputs the string in lowercase -> which is the same as the original.\n\n            // Convert current to a string\n            // How many digits? At most 10 (for a 32-bit int) plus one for the sign? But current is positive? \n            char buffer[20]; // enough for 64-bit?\n            sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", current);\n\n            // Now, we could simulate the third program: \n            //   But we know: \n            //        uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0 -> so we output the string in lowercase? \n            //        But the string is already in digits (so no uppercase letters). \n            //        We can just output the string.\n\n            // However, the third program does: \n            //   if (uppercase > lowercase) -> convert to uppercase and output.\n            //   else if (lowercase > uppercase) -> convert to lowercase and output.\n            //   else -> convert to lowercase and output.\n\n            // Since both counts are 0, we output the string in lowercase -> which is the same.\n\n            // So we can just output the string.\n\n            // But note: the third program outputs the string and then a newline? Yes, because it uses println.\n\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the second program might run for a long time? But the cycle for the leap years is 400? and the week cycle is 7. The combined cycle is 2800? So we might have to iterate at most 2800 years? which is acceptable.\n\n   But what if the starting year is very big? The problem does not specify constraints. But the first program: n and k are at most 10^5? and the integers in the array? The sum S might be large? \n\n   However, the second program iterates until it finds the next matching year. The next matching year might be up to 28 years away? Actually, the cycle is 28? but wait: the leap year cycle is 28? not exactly: because 28 years is a multiple of 7? and the leap pattern repeats every 28 years? \n\n   Actually, the leap years in the Gregorian calendar have a cycle of 400 years. But the problem doesn't require to be efficient.\n\n   We'll do the iterative method.\n\n   Let me test with a small example: \n        y0 = 2016 (leap year: leap0=1)\n        Then we start at 2017.\n\n        We need to accumulate mod7 until we get 0 and the leap status of the candidate year is 1.\n\n        How many years? \n            2017: not leap -> mod = (0+1) = 1\n            2018: not leap -> mod = 2\n            2019: not leap -> mod = 3\n            2020: leap -> mod = (3+2) = 5\n            2021: not leap -> mod = 6\n            2022: not leap -> mod = 0? (6+1=7 mod7=0) -> then check: is 2022 leap? no -> but leap0=1 -> skip.\n            2023: not leap -> mod = 1\n            2024: leap -> mod = 1+2=3\n            2025: not leap -> mod=4\n            2026: not leap -> mod=5\n            2027: not leap -> mod=6\n            2028: leap -> mod=6+2=8 mod7=1\n            2029: not leap -> mod=2\n            2030: not leap -> mod=3\n            2031: not leap -> mod=4\n            2032: leap -> mod=4+2=6\n            2033: not leap -> mod=0? (6+1=7 mod7=0) -> check: 2033 not leap -> skip.\n            ... until 2044? \n\n        Actually, the next leap year that starts on the same day as 2016 is 2044? \n\n        But note: the condition is that the leap status of the candidate year must be the same as the starting year? \n        So we require the candidate year to be leap? because 2016 is leap.\n\n        So we break when we get mod==0 and candidate is leap.\n\n        How about 2044? \n            We start at 2016 (leap). Then we add 28 years? \n\n        The days in 28 years: \n            There are 7 leap years in 28 years? (2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040) -> 7 leap years? \n            Then total days = 28*365 + 7 = 28*365+7.\n            28*365 = 10220, plus 7 = 10227.\n            10227 mod7 = 0? because 7 mod7=0, and 28 mod7=0 -> 0 + 0 = 0? \n\n            Actually: 28 mod7=0, so 28*365 mod7=0, and 7 mod7=0 -> total mod7=0.\n\n            And 2044 is leap? yes.\n\n        So we break at 2044.\n\n        How many iterations? 2044 - 2016 = 28? but we start at 2017 and go to 2044 -> 28 years? \n\n        So we do 28 iterations? acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the original program does not do mod7 at every step? It accumulates the total days. But we are doing mod7 to avoid overflow? \n\n   But the original program uses an integer for total_days? which might be huge? but in our case the maximum iteration is 2800? (or 400? worst-case 400*7=2800) so the total_days would be at most 2800 * 366 which is about 1e6? which is acceptable. But we do mod7 to be safe for any input? \n\n   Actually, the input year S might be as large as 10^5? Then we might have to iterate 2800 years? which is acceptable.\n\n   But we'll do mod7 to be safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int is_leap(int year) {\n            if (year % 400 == 0) return 1;\n            if (year % 100 == 0) return 0;\n            if (year % 4 == 0) return 1;\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Read n and k\n            int n, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n            int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n\n            int S = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n                S += arr[i];\n            }\n            free(arr);\n\n            int y0 = S;\n            int leap0 = is_leap(y0);\n            int current = y0 + 1;\n            int mod = 0;\n\n            while (1) {\n                int days = is_leap(current) ? 366 : 365;\n                // We can do mod7: \n                mod = (mod + (days % 7)) % 7;\n                // But note: 366 % 7 = 2, 365 % 7 = 1, so we can also do:\n                // mod = (mod + (is_leap(current) ? 2 : 1)) % 7;\n\n                if (mod % 7 == 0) {   // mod %7 is mod, so mod==0\n                    if (is_leap(current) == leap0) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                current++;\n            }\n\n            // Convert current to string and output\n            char buffer[20];\n            sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", current);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the condition in the while loop: we break when mod==0 and the leap status matches.\n\n   However, we did mod = (mod + ...) % 7, so mod is always in [0,6]. Then we check mod==0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the original program does not do mod7? It checks if the total days is divisible by 7. We are doing mod7 so we are effectively checking the same.\n\n   Let me test with 2016:\n\n        We break at 2044. Then mod must be 0? \n\n        We start at 2016: then we start with current=2017, mod=0.\n\n        For 2017: mod = (0 + 1) %7 = 1\n        For 2018: 1+1=2\n        For 2019: 3\n        For 2020: 3+2=5\n        For 2021: 5+1=6\n        For 2022: 6+1=7 mod7=0 -> then check: 2022 is leap? no -> leap0=1 -> skip.\n\n        Then 2023: 0+1=1\n        ... until 2044: \n\n        How to compute 28 years? \n            We are adding 28 years: each non-leap adds 1, each leap adds 2.\n            How many leap years in [2017,2044]? \n                2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040,2044 -> 7 leap years? \n                Then total mod = 21 (non-leap: 21 years) * 1 + 7 * 2 = 21+14=35 -> 35 mod7=0.\n\n        So at 2044, mod becomes 0? and 2044 is leap? same as leap0 (1) -> break.\n\n        Therefore, correct.\n\n   But note: the leap year 2044 is included in the list? Because we are adding the days of the year 2044? \n\n        The original program: \n            It starts at i = 2016+1 = 2017, then adds the days of 2017, then checks the condition for i=2017? \n            Then i=2018, adds 2018, then checks condition for i=2018? \n            ... \n            Then at i=2044: we add the days of 2044 (which is 366 -> 2 mod7) and then check condition for i=2044.\n\n        But wait: we are including the year 2044? \n\n        However, note: the condition for the matching day of the week is that the total days from the starting year (2016) to the year before the candidate? \n\n        Actually, the problem: the calendar for the candidate year must start on the same day as the starting year? \n\n        The original program's logic: \n            It adds the days of the year i (which is the next year) and then checks the condition? \n\n        But the candidate year i is the next year we are looking for? \n\n        The total days added is the number of days from the starting year (2016) to the end of the candidate year? \n\n        Actually, no: the program starts at i=2017 and adds the days of 2017 (which is the year 2017) and then checks? \n\n        Then the condition is that the total days from 2016 to the end of 2017? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n        Let me read the problem of codeforces_678_B: \n            \"You are given a year y. Find the earliest year strictly greater than y which has the same week day for January 1st and the same leap year status.\"\n\n        How is the week day computed? \n            The week day of January 1st of the next year is (current year's January 1st + number of days in the current year) mod7.\n\n        The original program: \n            It starts at i = y+1, and then adds the days of the year i? \n\n        Actually, the program does:\n\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (check_leap(i)) \n                    sum += 366;\n                else\n                    sum += 365;\n\n                if (sum %7 == 0) {\n                    if ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || ... ) \n                        output i;\n                }\n            }\n\n        This implies: \n            The total days from the year y to the year i-1? \n\n        Actually, the program is adding the days of each year starting from y+1? \n\n        Then the week day of January 1st of the year i is: \n            (weekday of Jan1 of y) + (days in y) + (days in y+1) + ... + (days in i-1) mod7.\n\n        But the problem requires: same week day for January 1st as the year y? \n\n            So: (weekday_y + total_days) mod7 = weekday_y mod7 \n            => total_days mod7 = 0.\n\n        And the total_days is the sum from the year y to the year i-1? \n\n        However, the program adds the days for the year i? and then checks? \n\n        Then the total_days at the time of checking for candidate i is the days from y+1 to i? \n\n        But that would be: \n            weekday for Jan1 of i+1 = weekday_y + (days from y to i) mod7.\n\n        The problem requires the weekday for Jan1 of the candidate year (say candidate) to be the same as the weekday for Jan1 of y? \n\n        Actually, the candidate year is the year we output? \n\n        The condition for the candidate year: \n            weekday for Jan1 of candidate = weekday for Jan1 of y.\n\n        And the total days from y to candidate-1 must be a multiple of 7.\n\n        The program: \n            It starts at i = y+1 and adds the days of the year i (which is the year y+1) and then checks: \n                total_days = days of y+1 -> then if that mod7==0, then candidate = y+1? \n                Then the total days from y to (y+1)-1 = y -> but that's just the year y? \n\n        That doesn't match.\n\n        Actually, the program should add the days of the year y? But note: the starting condition: \n            The week day of Jan1 of y is known. \n            The week day of Jan1 of y+1 = (weekday_y + days_in_y) mod7.\n\n        To get the week day of y+2: (weekday_y + days_in_y + days_in_y+1) mod7.\n\n        So to get the week day of the candidate year i: \n            = (weekday_y + (days from year y to year i-1)) mod7.\n\n        We require that to be equal to weekday_y mod7? \n            => (days from y to i-1) mod7 = 0.\n\n        Therefore, the total days we need is from y to i-1.\n\n        The original program: \n            It starts at i = y+1, and then adds the days of i (which is the year i) -> but that is the year i, which is the candidate year? \n\n        Actually, the candidate year is i? and we are adding the days of the candidate year? \n\n        That doesn't fit.\n\n        Let me check: \n            We want the days from y to i-1? \n            For candidate i, we need to add: \n                year y: days_in_y\n                year y+1: days_in_y+1\n                ...\n                year i-1: days_in_i-1\n\n        The program does:\n\n            for (int i = y+1; ; i++) {\n                if (leap(i)) then add 366; else 365;\n                ... \n            }\n\n        So when i = y+1, we add the days of the year y+1? but we haven't added the year y? \n\n        Therefore, the program is missing the year y? \n\n        But note: the starting year y is the input? and we don't add it? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: strictly greater than y.\n\n        How about we consider the offset from the starting year? \n\n            The week day for Jan1 of y+1 = (weekday_y + days_in_y) mod7.\n\n            We want the week day for Jan1 of candidate i to be the same as weekday_y? \n                => (weekday_y + total_days) mod7 = weekday_y mod7\n                => total_days mod7=0.\n\n            where total_days = days_in_y + days_in_y+1 + ... + days_in_i-1.\n\n        The program starts at i=y+1 and adds the days of i? \n\n        Then at i = y+1, total_days = days_in_y+1? -> which is not including the year y.\n\n        So it is not the total_days we need.\n\n        How to fix? \n\n        We should start by adding the days of the year y? But note: the program uses the leap status of the candidate year? \n\n        The program also uses the leap status of the starting year? \n\n        Actually, the program does not add the starting year? \n\n        The problem says: \"Find the earliest year strictly greater than y\"\n\n        The candidate year must be greater than y.\n\n        The total days we need: from the year y to the year candidate-1? \n\n        The program: \n            sum = 0;\n            for i from y+1 to candidate:\n                if check_leap(i) then add 366 else 365.\n\n            Then the total_days = sum.\n\n        But then the week day of candidate: \n            = (weekday_y + days_in_y + days_in_y+1 + ... + days_in_candidate-1) mod7\n            = (weekday_y + total_days) mod7.\n\n        And we require that to be weekday_y? so total_days mod7=0.\n\n        But the program is adding the days from the year y+1 to candidate? \n\n        Actually, the total_days from y to candidate-1 = days_in_y + (days_in_y+1 to candidate-1).\n\n        The program does not include the year y? \n\n        Therefore, we must add the days of the year y? \n\n        But the program doesn't. \n\n        And the leap status condition: the candidate year must have the same leap status as the starting year? \n\n        The program checks the leap status of the candidate year? \n\n        But the condition for the same leap status is for the candidate year? \n\n        The problem says: \"same leap year status\" meaning the starting year and the candidate year? \n\n        So the program's condition is correct.\n\n        How about the total days? \n\n        The program starts at i=y+1 and adds the days of i? Then the total_days at candidate i is the days from y+1 to i? \n\n        But we need the days from y to i-1? \n\n            days from y to i-1 = days_in_y + days_in_y+1 + ... + days_in_i-1.\n\n        The program: \n            at i = y+1: we add days_in_y+1 -> then total_days = days_in_y+1.\n            at i = y+2: total_days = days_in_y+1 + days_in_y+2.\n            ...\n            at i = candidate: total_days = days_in_y+1 + ... + days_in_candidate.\n\n        But we need the days from y to candidate-1? \n            = days_in_y + (days_in_y+1 to days_in_candidate-1)\n\n        The program is including an extra year: the candidate year? \n\n        Therefore, the condition should be: \n            (weekday_y + (total_days - days_in_candidate)) mod7 = weekday_y? \n            -> (total_days - days_in_candidate) mod7 = 0.\n\n        But the program checks total_days mod7=0.\n\n        So the program is not matching the requirement.\n\n        Actually, the problem: \n            \"New Year and the days of the week are matching again\"\n\n        The sample: \n            Input: 2016 -> Output: 2044.\n\n        How the original program runs:\n\n            y = 2016 -> leap = true.\n            i=2017: add 365 (because 2017 is not leap) -> total_days=365 -> 365 mod7=1 -> not 0.\n            i=2018: add 365 -> total_days=730 -> 730 mod7=2 -> not 0.\n            i=2019: 365 -> 1095 mod7=3\n            i=2020: 366 -> 1461 mod7= 1461%7 = 1461/7=208*7=1456, 5 -> 5\n            ... until i=2044: we add 366 (because 2044 is leap) -> then total_days mod7=0? \n\n            Then it checks: is 2044 leap? yes -> same as 2016? yes -> output 2044.\n\n        Now, the week day for Jan1 of 2044: \n            = (weekday_2016 + (days from 2016 to 2043)) mod7.\n\n        How many days from 2016 to 2043? \n            = total_days (which the program computed) - 366 (the days of 2044) -> but the program didn't subtract.\n\n        The program's total_days is the days from 2017 to 2044.\n\n        The days from 2016 to 2043 = days_in_2016 + (2017 to 2043) \n            = 366 + (total_days - 366) = total_days - 366 + 366 = total_days? \n\n        But wait: \n            total_days = days_in_2017 + ... + days_in_2044.\n            We need: days_in_2016 + days_in_2017 + ... + days_in_2043.\n\n            = days_in_2016 + (total_days - days_in_2044)\n\n        = 366 + (total_days - 366) = total_days.\n\n        Therefore, the total_days computed by the program is exactly the number of days from 2016 to 2043? \n\n        Why? \n            Because the program starts at 2017 and goes to 2044 -> that is 28 years? \n            The days from 2016 to 2043 is 28 years? \n\n        But note: the years 2016 to 2043 inclusive is 28 years? \n\n        Actually: 2043 - 2016 + 1 = 28 years.\n\n        And the program adds 28 years: 2017 to 2044 -> 28 years? \n\n        But 2017 to 2044 is 28 years? \n\n        How many years: 2044 - 2017 = 27 years? \n\n        Actually: \n            The number of years from 2017 to 2044 inclusive is: 2044 - 2017 + 1 = 28.\n\n        And the days from 2016 to 2043: \n            years: 2016, 2017,...,2043 -> 2043-2016+1 = 28 years.\n\n        Therefore, the program's total_days is the sum of the days of 2017 to 2044? which is 28 years.\n\n        But we need the sum of the days of 2016 to 2043? which is also 28 years? \n\n        And the two sets of years are different? \n\n        Actually, 2017 to 2044 is 28 years, and 2016 to 2043 is 28 years, and the leap years in these two periods are the same? \n\n        Because 2016 is leap and 2044 is leap? \n            The leap years in 2016 to 2043: \n                2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040 -> 7 leap years? \n            The leap years in 2017 to 2044:\n                2020,2024,...,2040,2044 -> also 7 leap years.\n\n        So the total days in both periods is the same: 28 years with 7 leap years -> 28*365+7.\n\n        Therefore, the program's total_days = 28*365+7 = the same as the period we need.\n\n        So the program is correct? \n\n        But why? \n\n        The program's total_days = days from 2017 to 2044 -> but that is the same number of days as from 2016 to 2043? \n\n        Because: \n            days_in_2016 = 366, and days_in_2044=366.\n            So 366 + (days from 2017 to 2043) = (days from 2017 to 2043) + 366 = (days from 2016 to 2043) [if we include 2016 and exclude 2044] \n            and (days from 2017 to 2044) = (days from 2017 to 2043) + 366.\n\n            Therefore: \n                days_2016_to_2043 = 366 + (days_2017_to_2043)\n                days_2017_to_2044 = (days_2017_to_2043) + 366\n\n            -> so they are equal.\n\n        So the program is correct.\n\n        Therefore, our C code is also correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        We do the same: \n            total_days_mod = 0\n            for current from y0+1 upwards:\n                add = (is_leap(current) ? 366 : 365;\n                mod = (mod + add) % 7   // or mod = (mod + (add %7)) %7\n\n            Then when mod==0 and is_leap(current)==leap0, break.\n\n   We output the current as a string.\n\n   But note: the third program? It outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n   Therefore, we output the string and a newline.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly."
