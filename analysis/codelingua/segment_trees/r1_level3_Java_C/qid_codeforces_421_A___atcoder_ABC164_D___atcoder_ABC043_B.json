We can use arrays in C.\n\n   Steps for the first program in C:\n\n        int n, a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d % d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n        // We'll create an array for the result?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. However, note that the first program (codeforces_421_A) reads integers and then two lists of integers, and then prints a sequence of 1's and 2's for n items.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) expects a string as input (from the first program's output). But note: the first program outputs integers (1 or 2) separated by spaces. We cannot feed that directly to the second program which expects a string of digits without spaces? Actually, the second program is designed for a problem that takes a string of digits. So we must change the chain.\n\nBut wait: the original sequence is that the output of the first becomes the input of the second? However, the second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) in the given code reads a single string. The first program outputs a sequence of integers (each 1 or 2) with spaces. That doesn't form a single digit string? It has spaces and the numbers are 1 or 2. So the second program would read the first token? Actually, the second program reads the entire next token? But the first program outputs multiple tokens.\n\nThis chain is not naturally compatible. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nLooking at the third program (atcoder_ABC043_B): it reads a string and simulates a backspace. It expects a string that may contain '0', '1', and 'B'.\n\nBut note: the first program outputs a string of numbers (each 1 or 2) separated by spaces. The second program expects a string of digits (without spaces) and counts substrings divisible by 2019. The third program expects a string that can have '0','1','B'.\n\nWe must reconsider: the problem says the entire sequence. How do we chain?\n\nThe problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nBut the behavior of the chain is:\n\n1. First program: reads n, a, b, then a integers for list1, then b integers for list2. Then outputs n integers (each 1 or 2) separated by spaces.\n\n2. Second program: reads a string (which would be the entire output of the first program? But that output has spaces and numbers). Then it processes that string and outputs a long integer (the answer).\n\n3. Third program: reads a string (which would be the output of the second program? The second program outputs a single integer). Then it processes that string (which should be a string of digits and possibly 'B') and outputs a string.\n\nBut note: the output of the first program is a sequence of tokens? The second program uses `sc.next()` which reads the next token. So the second program would only read the first token from the first program's output? Then the rest of the tokens would be left for the third program? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, we must interpret the chain as:\n\n- The output of the first program is written to stdout. Then the second program reads from stdin which is the entire output of the first program. Similarly, the third program reads the entire output of the second program.\n\nSo the entire output of the first program becomes the input to the second program, and the entire output of the second program becomes the input to the third program.\n\nBut the second program expects a string without spaces? Actually, the second program reads a string of digits (without spaces) because the problem it solves (ABC164_D) is about a digit string. But the first program outputs a string that has spaces. So the second program would fail? \n\nWait: the example input for the first program is:\n\n3 1 2\n1\n3 2\n\nThis outputs: \"1 2 2\" (for n=3). Then the second program would read \"1\" (the first token) and leave \"2 2\" for the next tokens? But the second program only reads one token. Then the third program would read \"2\" (the next token) and then leave \"2\" which is not read? That breaks.\n\nAlternatively, we must consider that the entire output of the first program is a string that is then fed as the entire input to the second program. So the second program would read the entire string (including spaces) as S.\n\nBut the second program's code:\n\n    String S = sc.next();\n\nThis reads one token. So if the first program outputs \"1 2 2\", then the second program reads \"1\", and the rest \" 2 2\" would be available for the next read? But the second program doesn't read anything else. Then the third program would read the next token? That is \"2\", and then the last \"2\" would be left? That is not the intended behavior.\n\nAlternatively, we must change the second program to read the entire line? But we are not allowed to change the original programs. However, we are translating the entire chain. We must simulate the chain as if each program runs independently, with the output of the first being the input of the second, and then the output of the second being the input of the third.\n\nBut note: the first program writes to stdout, and the second reads from stdin. The second program would read the entire output of the first as if it was typed. How does Scanner work? It would read the tokens in order. The second program only reads one token. Then the third program would read the next tokens? But the third program uses a LightScanner that reads tokens? Actually, the third program reads a string by `in.string()`, which reads the next token. So:\n\nFirst program output: \"1 2 2\" (without newline? actually, it uses `System.out.print` so it doesn't end with a newline? Actually, the last token is printed without a trailing space? Let me check: the first program prints for i from 0 to n-1: (value) and then a space. So the output ends with a space? Then the second program reads the first token? which is \"1\", then the third program would read the next token \"2\", and then there is one more token \"2\" which is not read? That would break.\n\nAlternatively, we must capture the entire output of the first program as a string and feed that entirely to the second program as a string? Then the entire output of the second program as a string to the third.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". So we are to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O? So we can store the intermediate results in memory.\n\nTherefore, we design:\n\nStep 1: Read the input for the first program: n, a, b, then a integers, then b integers.\n\nStep 2: Run the first program's logic: produce a string that is the output (which is n integers (1 or 2) separated by spaces). But note: the first program outputs without a trailing newline? Actually, it prints a space after every number. We have to replicate that exactly.\n\nStep 3: Instead of printing, we capture that string and use it as input to the second program.\n\nBut the second program expects a string of digits? However, the string we captured has spaces. The second program (atcoder_ABC164_D) is designed for a problem that expects a string of digits (without spaces). But in the chain, we are feeding it the output of the first program which has spaces. So the second program would fail? \n\nThis indicates that the chain as given is not well-formed. However, the problem states to reproduce the same behavior. We are to run the chain as if each program is run independently. So we must consider that the second program reads the entire output of the first program as a string? Actually, the second program uses `sc.next()` which reads the next token (without spaces). So the second program would only take the first token? That is the first integer? Then what happens to the rest? The third program would then read the next token? \n\nBut the third program is designed to read one string? It uses `in.string()` which reads one token. So the chain would break because the second program only uses the first token and the third program uses the second token? But there are n tokens. So the third program would only process one token? \n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is not meant to be run on the same input? The problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So we are given the input for the first program. Then the entire chain must produce the same output as the third program when run on that input.\n\nBut the chain:\n\nInput for first program: \n  3 1 2\n  1\n  3 2\n\nFirst program outputs: \"1 2 2\" (with a space between each and no trailing newline? Actually, the program prints with a space and then the next, and the last token is printed with a space? Actually, the loop prints for i in [0, n-1]: \n   if (list1.contains(i+1)) then print \"1 \" else print \"2 \"\n\nSo for n=3, it prints: \"1 2 2 \" (with a trailing space). \n\nThen the second program reads the next token? which is \"1\", then the rest \"2 2 \" is left. The second program then processes \"1\" as the string S? Then it computes the answer for the string \"1\". The length is 1. Then it does:\n\n   mod_arr[0] = (1 * 1) % 2019 = 1.\n   mod_cnt[1] becomes 1.\n   Then mod_cnt[0] is incremented (because mod_cnt[0]++ at the end) -> becomes 1? Then the answer is computed as:\n      ans = mod_cnt[0]*(mod_cnt[0]-1)/2 + ... for all mod_cnt[i]\n      For i=0: 1*0/2 = 0\n      For i=1: 1*0/2 = 0\n      ... so ans=0.\n\nThen the second program prints \"0\" (with a newline? because it uses `System.out.println`).\n\nThen the third program reads the next token? which is the next token from the original first program's output? That is \"2\". Then the third program would process the string \"2\": \n   It appends '2'? But the third program only handles '0','1','B'. So it would skip? Actually, the switch statement in the third program:\n\n   switch (c) {\n        case '0': ... break;\n        case '1': ... break;\n        case 'B': ... break;\n   }\n\nThere is no case for '2'. So it does nothing? Then the output is the empty string? But then the third program outputs the string builder which is empty? So it prints a newline? \n\nBut that is not the intended behavior of the chain? \n\nAlternatively, we must consider that the entire output of the first program is captured as a string and fed to the second program as a whole? But the second program only reads one token. Then the entire output of the second program is captured and fed to the third program as a whole? But the third program reads one token? So we have:\n\nStep 1: Input: \"3 1 2\\n1\\n3 2\\n\"\nStep 2: First program: outputs \"1 2 2 \" (without newline? but the program doesn't print a newline at the end? Then the output is \"1 2 2 \".\n\nStep 3: Second program: reads the first token from the string \"1 2 2 \" -> that is \"1\". Then it processes \"1\" and outputs \"0\\n\".\n\nStep 4: Third program: then we have the rest of the tokens: \"2 2 \" and then the output of the second program: \"0\\n\". But the third program starts reading from the beginning of the input? Actually, in the chain, the second program's output becomes the third program's input. So the third program's input is the string \"0\\n\". Then it processes that:\n\n   First character: '0' -> append \"0\"\n   Second character: '\\n' -> not in the switch? so ignored? Then output \"0\".\n\nBut that doesn't match the original chain? \n\nAlternatively, we must simulate the entire chain by having the first program write to a string, then the second program reads from that string (as if it was stdin) and writes to another string, and then the third program reads from that string.\n\nBut the problem says: \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. So we will capture the output of the first program in a string, then use that string as the input to the second program (by simulating the token reading from that string), and then capture the output of the second program as a string and feed to the third.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we design:\n\n1. Read the entire input for the first program (which includes integers and two lists) from stdin.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic and store the output string (the sequence of numbers and spaces) in memory.\n\n3. Use that output string as the input for the second program. But the second program uses a Scanner that reads tokens. We must simulate the tokenization. The second program only reads one token (the first one). So we extract the first token from the string.\n\n4. Then the second program processes that token (as a string of digits) and produces a long integer. Then it outputs that integer (with a newline). We capture that entire output (the string representation of the integer and the newline) in memory.\n\n5. Then that becomes the input for the third program. The third program uses a LightScanner that reads tokens. So we extract the next token? But wait, the third program only reads one token? Actually, the third program reads one token (the entire string for the third program is the output of the second program? But the third program expects a string that may contain multiple tokens? However, the output of the second program is one integer and then a newline. The LightScanner in the third program reads tokens? So it would read the integer (without the newline) as a string? For example, if the second program outputs \"0\\n\", then the third program's `in.string()` would return \"0\".\n\n6. Then the third program processes that string: it goes character by character. The string \"0\" has one character: '0'. So it appends \"0\". Then outputs \"0\".\n\nBut then the final output is \"0\".\n\nBut what if we run the original chain independently?\n\nExample input: \n  3 1 2\n  1\n  3 2\n\nFirst program output: \"1 2 2 \" (without newline? actually, the program uses `System.out.print` and does not print a newline at the end? Then the output is:\n\n   \"1 2 2 \"\n\nThen we run the second program with that input? The second program reads the first token \"1\", and then ignores the rest? Then it outputs \"0\\n\".\n\nThen the third program is run with input \"0\\n\". It reads the token \"0\", and then processes: \n   c = '0' -> append \"0\"\n   then the newline is not in the switch? so ignored? Then outputs \"0\".\n\nSo the final output is \"0\".\n\nBut note: the third program uses `out.println(d)`, so it prints the string and then a newline.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the chain is \"0\\n\".\n\nSo we must output \"0\\n\".\n\nBut wait: the example input for the first program is just an example. We must write a general program.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read the integers n, a, b.\n2. Then read a integers for list1 and b integers for list2.\n\n3. Build the output string for the first program: for i from 1 to n, if i is in list1 then \"1 \", else \"2 \". (Note: the program checks for i+1? because i goes from 0 to n-1, and it checks for i+1. So for index 0, it checks 1, index 1 checks 2, etc.)\n\n   Actually, the first program:\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (list1.contains(i + 1)) {\n                System.out.print(1 + \" \");\n            } else {\n                System.out.print(2 + \" \");\n            }\n        }\n\n   So we build a string with n tokens: the tokens are either \"1\" or \"2\", each followed by a space. The entire string has n tokens and n spaces? and length = 2*n? But the last character is a space? Yes.\n\n4. Now, we simulate the second program. The second program expects to read a string S. It uses `sc.next()`, which reads the next token (without spaces). So we take the first token from the string we built. How to tokenize? We can split by spaces. But note: the entire string is tokens separated by spaces. The first token is the first number (as a string).\n\n   Let token1 = the first token of the first program's output? But wait, the entire output of the first program is a string of tokens. The second program only reads the first token. So we extract the first token.\n\n   However, the first token is the first word? For example, the output string: \"1 2 2 \" -> the tokens would be: [\"1\", \"2\", \"2\"] (if we split and ignore trailing space). But the trailing space: we can split and take the first element.\n\n   But note: the second program is designed for a string of digits. The token we extract is a string of one or more digits? In this case, each token is a single digit (either \"1\" or \"2\"). So we can take the first token as the string S.\n\n5. Then we run the second program's logic on S. The second program:\n\n        String S = ...; // the token we extracted\n        int N = S.length();\n        ... // then it does the computation for the problem ABC164_D.\n\n   But note: the problem ABC164_D is about counting the number of substrings (in the contiguous sense) that form a number divisible by 2019. However, the method they use is by a known technique: from right to left, compute the suffix mod 2019 and then count pairs of the same mod value.\n\n   However, we are going to reimplement the same logic in C.\n\n6. Then we capture the output of the second program: which is a string representation of the long integer `ans` and a newline.\n\n7. Then we feed that entire string to the third program. The third program uses `in.string()` which reads the next token. The output of the second program is a single token? Because it's one integer and a newline. The token would be the integer without the newline? So we extract the token (the integer as a string) and then the third program processes that string.\n\n   But note: the third program only handles three types of characters: '0','1','B'. The string we feed is the integer from the second program. It might be a multi-digit number? For example, if the second program outputs \"123\\n\", then the token for the third program is \"123\". Then we iterate over each character:\n\n        '1' -> append '1'\n        '2' -> not in switch? so nothing? (the program ignores it)\n        '3' -> nothing.\n\n   So the output would be \"1\".\n\n   But wait, the example: second program outputs \"0\", so the third program gets \"0\", then appends '0', then outputs \"0\".\n\n8. Then we output the result of the third program? But the third program outputs a string and then a newline.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So we output the string that the third program produces (which is the result of processing the token from the second program's output).\n\nBut note: the third program uses `out.println(d)`, so we must output the string and then a newline.\n\nBut what if the second program outputs a number that contains digits other than '0' and '1'? Then the third program will ignore those digits? And also, if there is a 'B', it will remove the last character? \n\nExample: if the second program outputs \"10B1\", then the third program would process:\n\n   '1' -> append '1'\n   '0' -> append '0' -> now \"10\"\n   'B' -> remove last -> becomes \"1\"\n   '1' -> append '1' -> becomes \"11\"\n\nBut wait: the second program outputs a number? Actually, the second program outputs an integer. That integer might be 0, 1, 123, etc. But the third program will get the string representation of that integer. For example, 123 is represented as \"123\". Then the third program will remove any character that is not '0' or '1'? Actually, it only does something for '0','1','B'. So for '2' and '3', it does nothing. So the output for \"123\" would be \"1\".\n\nThis is the behavior of the chain.\n\nBut note: the chain might not be designed to work together? The problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must exactly simulate the three programs in sequence, using the output of one as the input to the next, without any extra I/O.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program: n, a, b, then a integers, then b integers.\n\n2. Build an array (or two arrays) for list1 and list2. But note: the first program uses ArrayLists. We can use arrays in C.\n\n   Steps for the first program in C:\n\n        int n, a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n        // We'll create an array for the result? Actually, we don't need to store the lists, we need to know for each index i (from 1 to n) whether it is in list1 or not.\n\n        // We can create an array `assigned` of n+1? (index 1..n) to mark if in list1.\n        int *list1 = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n        int *list2 = (int*)malloc(b * sizeof(int));\n        for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &list1[i]);\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &list2[i]);\n        }\n\n        // We'll create an array `mark` of size n+1: mark[i] = 1 if i is in list1, else 0? But note: the first program uses list1 only? It checks if i+1 is in list1. If not, then it uses 2 (which is list2? but it doesn't check list2? actually, it doesn't matter: if in list1 -> 1, else 2.\n\n        // We can create an array `res` for the first program's output tokens? Actually, we are going to build a string.\n\n        // Instead, we can build a string: we'll allocate a string of length (n * 2) because each token is a digit and a space. But note: the last token has a space? Then the total length is 2*n? But we don't need to store the entire string? We only need the first token for the next program? But wait: the second program only uses the first token. So we don't need to build the entire string? We only need the first token? \n\n        Actually, the first token is for i=0: i+1 = 1. So if 1 is in list1, then the first token is \"1\", else \"2\". Then the rest we don't care? \n\n        But wait: the second program only reads the first token. So we only need to know the first token? Then we don't need to build the entire string? \n\n        However, the rest of the tokens are part of the output? But they are not read by the second program? They become available for the third program? But the third program does not read them? Because the third program reads from the output of the second program? \n\n        Actually, in the chain, the entire output of the first program is written to stdout, then the second program reads from stdin (which has that entire output). But the second program only reads one token. Then the third program starts reading from the same stdin? at the next token? \n\n        But we are simulating without I/O: we are going to capture the entire output of the first program and then use it as input to the second program? and then the entire output of the second program as input to the third program? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the second program's input is the entire output of the first program? and the third program's input is the entire output of the second program? \n\n        But the second program only reads the first token of its input? Then the rest of the input (for the second program) is not passed to the third program? The third program gets only the output of the second program? \n\n        Therefore, the intermediate data is:\n\n          Program1 output -> entire string S1 (which is the n tokens with spaces)\n          Program2 input = S1, but program2 only uses the first token of S1. Then program2 outputs a string S2 (which is the integer and a newline).\n          Program3 input = S2 (only the output of program2).\n\n        So we don't need the entire S1? Only the first token of S1.\n\n        Therefore, we can avoid building the entire string for S1? We only need the first token? \n\n        How to get the first token? It is the value for the first element: i=0 -> i+1=1. We check if 1 is in list1? \n\n        So: \n            char *firstToken = (char*)malloc(2); // because it's either \"1\" or \"2\", and we can make a string.\n            if (list1 contains 1) {\n                firstToken[0] = '1';\n            } else {\n                firstToken[0] = '2';\n            }\n            firstToken[1] = '\\0';\n\n        But note: what if the first token is more than one digit? In the first program, the tokens are single digits. So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if the first program's output for the first token is \"10\"? No, because the tokens are only 1 or 2.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            char firstToken[2];\n            if (in_list(1, list1, a)) {   // we need a helper function to check if 1 is in list1\n                firstToken[0] = '1';\n            } else {\n                firstToken[0] = '2';\n            }\n            firstToken[1] = '\\0';\n\n        But wait: the second program expects a string of digits? It might be multiple digits? But here it is one digit.\n\n        Then we run the second program on firstToken.\n\n        Then we run the third program on the output of the second program.\n\n        And then output the result of the third program.\n\n        But note: the first program might have more output? but the second program only uses the first token. The rest of the output of the first program is discarded? \n\n        So we don't need to generate the entire output of the first program? Only the first token? \n\n        This is a significant optimization? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". And in the original chain, the first program outputs the entire string. However, the second program only reads the first token. The rest of the output is not read by any program? So we can avoid generating it.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            Step 1: read n, a, b, then list1 (a integers) and list2 (b integers).\n\n            Step 2: Check if 1 is in list1? (because the first token is for the element 1). We don't care about the rest.\n\n            Step 3: Then run the second program on the string which is either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\n            Step 4: Then run the third program on the output of the second program.\n\n        However, what if the first program's output has more than one token? But we are not using them? So we skip.\n\n        But what if the second program had read the entire string? But it doesn't. It only reads the first token.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But note: the second program is designed for a string of digits. The first token is a string of one digit. So we can use that.\n\n        However, the second program's algorithm:\n\n            int N = S.length();   // will be 1 for our case.\n\n            Then it creates an array `mod_arr` of length N.\n\n            Then for i=0 (only one character):\n\n                tmp = (digit at position N-1-i) * radix % 2019.\n\n                radix starts at 1.\n\n                So tmp = (S[0] - '0') * 1 % 2019 -> that is the digit itself mod 2019.\n\n                Then if i != 0, we add mod_arr[i-1]? but i==0, so we skip.\n\n                mod_arr[0] = tmp.\n\n                mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n                Then radix = radix * 10 % 2019 -> becomes 10.\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                mod_cnt[0]++;   // so mod_cnt[0] becomes 1 (if originally 0) then 1? \n\n                Then for each i in 0..2018: \n                    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2.\n\n            For our case: \n                mod_cnt[tmp] is 1? then mod_cnt[0] becomes 1 (because we did mod_cnt[0]++)? \n                But note: the mod_arr[0] is the digit mod 2019. Let the digit be d. Then mod_cnt[d] becomes 1.\n\n                Then we do mod_cnt[0]++ -> mod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n\n                Then for i=0: ans += 1*0/2 = 0.\n                For i=d: ans += 1*0/2 = 0.\n                For others: 0.\n\n                So ans=0.\n\n            Then the second program outputs 0.\n\n        Then the third program gets the string \"0\" (because we capture the output of the second program as a string? which is \"0\\n\"? but then we tokenize for the third program: we take the token \"0\")? \n\n        Then the third program processes the token \"0\": appends '0'. Then outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        So the final output is \"0\\n\".\n\n        But what if the first token is \"2\"? Then the second program:\n\n            tmp = 2 % 2019 = 2.\n\n            mod_cnt[2] becomes 1.\n\n            then mod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n\n            Then ans = mod_cnt[0]*(0)/2 + mod_cnt[2]*(0)/2 + ... = 0.\n\n        So always 0? Then the third program outputs \"0\".\n\n        But wait: what if the string in the second program is \"0\"? Then:\n\n            tmp = 0 % 2019 = 0.\n\n            mod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n\n            then mod_cnt[0]++ -> becomes 2.\n\n            Then ans = mod_cnt[0]*(2-1)/2? = 2*1/2 = 1.\n\n            So the second program outputs 1.\n\n            Then the third program gets \"1\", and processes: appends '1'? then outputs \"1\".\n\n        So the chain output is \"1\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, we must be careful: the first token of the first program might be \"0\"? But the first program only outputs \"1\" or \"2\". So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if the first program outputs a token that is more than one digit? It doesn't: it only outputs single digits.\n\n        So we proceed.\n\n        But note: the first program might output a token that is \"1\" or \"2\". So the second program will always output 0? \n\n        Therefore, the third program always gets \"0\", and outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But wait: the second program outputs a newline? Then the third program's input is \"0\\n\". The token for the third program is \"0\". Then it outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        So the final output is \"0\\n\".\n\n        But what if the first program's first token is \"1\" or \"2\", the second program outputs 0? Then the third program outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        So the chain output is always \"0\\n\"? \n\n        But what if the first program's first token is \"0\"? Then the second program outputs 1? and the third program outputs \"1\\n\"? \n\n        However, the first program never outputs \"0\". It only outputs \"1\" or \"2\".\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But what if the first program outputs a multi-digit number? It doesn't: because the tokens are for each i, and the value is either 1 or 2.\n\n        Therefore, we can simplify: the first token is either \"1\" or \"2\". Then the second program outputs 0. Then the third program gets \"0\", and outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But wait: the second program outputs \"0\\n\", so the third program's input is \"0\\n\". The third program's token is \"0\". Then it outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        So the final output is \"0\\n\".\n\n        However, we must consider: the second program might output a number that is not zero? For example, if the first token is \"0\", then it outputs 1. But our first token is never \"0\".\n\n        But what if the first token is \"1\" and the string is \"1\", then the second program:\n\n            mod_arr[0] = 1.\n            mod_cnt[1] = 1.\n            then mod_cnt[0] is incremented to 1 (from 0? then becomes 1).\n\n            Then ans = 0 for mod_cnt[0] (because 1*(0)/2=0) and 0 for mod_cnt[1] (1*0/2=0) -> 0.\n\n        So it is 0.\n\n        Similarly, for \"2\": 0.\n\n        Therefore, the second program always outputs 0 for the first token being \"1\" or \"2\".\n\n        Then the third program always outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But what if the second program outputs a multi-digit number? For example, if the first token were a longer string? But it is one digit. So the output of the second program is \"0\\n\".\n\n        Then the third program: \n            reads the token \"0\" -> appends '0' -> then outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        So the final output is \"0\\n\".\n\n        But note: the example input we had: \n            n=3, a=1, b=2, then list1: [1], list2: [3,2] -> first token is \"1\", then second program outputs 0, then third outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But what if the first token is \"1\", but the second program's algorithm on the string \"1\" should output 0? as above.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the second program is designed for a string of arbitrary length? But we are only giving one digit. The algorithm works for any length.\n\n        Therefore, the C program:\n\n            Step 1: read n, a, b.\n            Step 2: read a integers for list1 and b integers for list2.\n\n            Step 3: Check if 1 is in list1? \n                We can do: \n                    int firstTokenValue = 1;\n                    int inList1 = 0;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n                        if (list1[i] == firstTokenValue) {\n                            inList1 = 1;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                Then if inList1, the string for the second program is \"1\", else \"2\".\n\n            Step 4: Run the second program on the string (which is either \"1\" or \"2\") to compute the answer (which will be 0).\n\n            Step 5: Format the output of the second program: which is the integer 0 -> we convert to string: \"0\".\n\n            But note: the second program outputs the integer and a newline? So we need to capture \"0\\n\".\n\n            Step 6: Then run the third program on the input \"0\\n\". The third program will read the token \"0\" (without the newline) and process it: \n                    d = new StringBuilder();\n                    for each char in \"0\": \n                         c = '0' -> append \"0\"\n                    then output d -> \"0\", then a newline.\n\n            Step 7: Output the result of the third program: which is \"0\\n\".\n\n        But wait: the third program outputs \"0\\n\", so we output \"0\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, the entire program outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        However, we are to write a C program that does the entire chain.\n\n        We can avoid actually building the entire second program's algorithm? Since we know that for the string \"1\" or \"2\" the answer is 0, we can hardcode? But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. So we must reimplement the second program's algorithm.\n\n        Similarly, the third program's algorithm must be reimplemented.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            // Step 1: read input for the first program\n            int n, a, b;\n            scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n            int *list1 = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n            int *list2 = (int*)malloc(b * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &list1[i]);\n            }\n            for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &list2[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: Determine the first token (for i=1)\n            int firstElement = 1;\n            int tokenValue = 2; // by default we use 2\n            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n                if (list1[i] == firstElement) {\n                    tokenValue = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            // Now, we have tokenValue: either 1 or 2. We convert to string.\n            char S_str[2]; // we'll make a string of one digit and null terminator\n            S_str[0] = tokenValue + '0';\n            S_str[1] = '\\0';\n\n            // Step 3: Run the second program on S_str.\n\n            // The second program: \n            //   String S = ...; // we have S_str\n            int N = strlen(S_str);\n            // We'll create mod_arr of length N, and mod_cnt array of 2019 (initialize to 0)\n            int *mod_arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n            int mod_cnt[2019] = {0}; // initialize to zeros\n\n            int radix = 1;\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                // character at position (N-1-i) in S_str\n                char c = S_str[N-1-i];\n                int digit = c - '0';\n                int tmp = digit * radix % 2019;\n                if (i != 0) {\n                    tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n                }\n                mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n                mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n                radix = (radix * 10) % 2019;\n            }\n\n            long ans = 0;\n            mod_cnt[0]++; // because the program does this\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n                ans += (long)mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i] - 1) / 2;\n            }\n\n            // Now, ans is the output of the second program. We need to convert to string and add a newline to form the input to the third program.\n\n            // Format ans to a string. The maximum value of ans: what is the maximum value? \n            // The second program: the string we passed is one digit. The maximum value we computed is 0. So ans=0? But in general, we do the computation.\n\n            // We'll create a string for the second program's output: we need to represent the long integer and then a newline.\n\n            // How big can ans be? The original program uses a string of up to 200000 characters? but our string is only length 1. So ans is at most 0? as we saw.\n\n            // But we do it generally.\n\n            char second_output[50]; // enough for a long integer\n            sprintf(second_output, \"%ld\\n\", ans); // this includes the newline\n\n            // Step 4: Run the third program on second_output.\n\n            // The third program: \n            //   It reads one token: we have to extract the next token from second_output? But the third program's LightScanner reads tokens. We'll simulate by tokenizing the string second_output.\n\n            // How to tokenize: we can use strtok? but note: the third program's LightScanner reads the next token. The string second_output might be \"0\\n\", which has one token \"0\".\n\n            // We'll extract the first token from second_output.\n\n            // But note: the third program expects a string that may contain multiple tokens? However, the second_output is one integer and a newline. So the token is the integer.\n\n            // We can use sscanf to read the token? or we can remove the newline and then use the entire string? But the token is the integer without the newline.\n\n            // Actually, the third program's LightScanner reads tokens by splitting by spaces and newlines. So the token is the integer string.\n\n            // How to extract: we can do:\n\n            char token[50];\n            // We'll read the first token from second_output: skip leading whitespace, then read until whitespace.\n            int j = 0;\n            int idx = 0;\n            // skip leading spaces if any? but our second_output is a number and then newline.\n            while (second_output[j] != '\\0' && (second_output[j] == ' ' || second_output[j] == '\\n' || second_output[j] == '\\t')) j++;\n            while (second_output[j] != '\\0' && !(second_output[j] == ' ' || second_output[j] == '\\n' || second_output[j] == '\\t')) {\n                token[idx++] = second_output[j++];\n            }\n            token[idx] = '\\0';\n\n            // Now, token is the string for the third program.\n\n            // Now, we simulate the third program's logic:\n\n            //   StringBuilder d = new StringBuilder();\n            //   for each char in token:\n            //        if char is '0', append '0'\n            //        if char is '1', append '1'\n            //        if char is 'B', then delete last character if exists.\n\n            // We'll use a dynamic array or a fixed array for the result.\n\n            char d[100]; // we hope 100 is enough? the token is a string representation of a long integer? which is at most 20 digits? and we are only appending '0' and '1'? but note: the token might have other digits? \n            int d_index = 0;\n\n            for (int i = 0; token[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                char c = token[i];\n                if (c == '0') {\n                    d[d_index++] = '0';\n                } else if (c == '1') {\n                    d[d_index++] = '1';\n                } else if (c == 'B') {\n                    if (d_index > 0) {\n                        d_index--;\n                    }\n                }\n                // ignore other characters? as in the Java program\n            }\n            d[d_index] = '\\0';\n\n            // Then output d and a newline? because the third program uses out.println(d);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", d);\n\n        But note: the third program's output is the string d and then a newline.\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire chain. We output the third program's output.\n\n        But in the example, we output \"0\\n\".\n\n        However, we must consider: what if the token for the third program is \"123\"? Then we output only the '1'? and then the '2' and '3' are ignored? Then the output is \"1\\n\".\n\n        But in our case, the token is \"0\", so we output \"0\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, the program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n\n            int main() {\n                // Step 1: Read n, a, b\n                int n, a, b;\n                scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b);\n                int *list1 = (int*)malloc(a * sizeof(int));\n                int *list2 = (int*)malloc(b * sizeof(int));\n                for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &list1[i]);\n                }\n                for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &list2[i]);\n                }\n\n                // Step 2: Determine the first token for the first program's output (for element 1)\n                int firstElement = 1;\n                int tokenVal = 2;\n                for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {\n                    if (list1[i] == firstElement) {\n                        tokenVal = 1;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                char S_str[2];\n                S_str[0] = tokenVal + '0';\n                S_str[1] = '\\0';\n\n                // Step 3: Second program on S_str\n                int N = strlen(S_str);\n                int *mod_arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n                int mod_cnt[2019] = {0}; // initialize to 0\n                int radix = 1;\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    char c = S_str[N-1-i];\n                    int digit = c - '0';\n                    int tmp = digit * radix % 2019;\n                    if (i != 0) {\n                        tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n                    }\n                    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n                    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n                    radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n                }\n\n                long ans = 0;\n                mod_cnt[0]++; // as in the Java code\n\n                for (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n                    ans += (long)mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1) / 2;\n                }\n\n                // Format the second program's output: a string representation of ans and a newline.\n                char second_output[50];\n                sprintf(second_output, \"%ld\\n\", ans);\n\n                // Step 4: Extract the first token from second_output for the third program.\n                char token[50];\n                int j = 0, idx = 0;\n                // Skip leading whitespace\n                while (second_output[j] != '\\0' && (second_output[j] == ' ' || second_output[j] == '\\n' || second_output[j] == '\\t')) {\n                    j++;\n                }\n                while (second_output[j] != '\\0' && !(second_output[j] == ' ' || second_output[j] == '\\n' || second_output[j] == '\\t')) {\n                    token[idx++] = second_output[j++];\n                }\n                token[idx] = '\\0';\n\n                // Step 5: Process the token in the third program's logic.\n                char d[100]; // result for third program\n                int d_index = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; token[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                    char c = token[i];\n                    if (c == '0') {\n                        d[d_index++] = '0';\n                    } else if (c == '1') {\n                        d[d_index++] = '1';\n                    } else if (c == 'B') {\n                        if (d_index > 0) {\n                            d_index--;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                d[d_index] = '\\0';\n\n                // Output the result of the third program (which is the final output)\n                printf(\"%s\\n\", d);\n\n                // Free memory\n                free(list1);\n                free(list2);\n                free(mod_arr);\n\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But note: the second program's output might be a big integer? We used %ld and a buffer of 50, which should be enough.\n\n        However, we must test with the possibility that the first token is \"0\" (even though we don't have that) to see if the second program outputs a big number? But the maximum value of ans for a string of length 1 is 1 (if the digit is 0) or 0 (otherwise). So it's safe.\n\n        But what if the first program had a first token of a multi-digit string? It doesn't. It's either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\n        Therefore, we output the above.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We have implemented the chain.\n\n        But note: the first program may have more tokens? but we discard them. And the second program only uses the first token of the first program's output. The third program only uses the entire output of the second program? \n\n        We have simulated that.\n\n        Let me run the example: \n            Input: \"3 1 2\\n1\\n3 2\\n\"\n\n            Step 1: n=3, a=1, b=2.\n            list1 = [1]\n            list2 = [3,2]\n\n            Step 2: Check: 1 is in list1 -> tokenVal=1 -> S_str=\"1\"\n\n            Step 3: \n                N=1\n                mod_arr: \n                    i=0: c='1' -> digit=1, radix=1 -> tmp=1*1 %2019=1.\n                    mod_arr[0]=1, mod_cnt[1] becomes 1.\n                    radix becomes 10.\n                Then mod_cnt[0]++ -> mod_cnt[0]=1.\n                Then ans = mod_cnt[0]*(0)/2 + mod_cnt[1]*(0)/2 = 0.\n\n            Step 4: second_output = \"0\\n\"\n\n            Step 5: token extracted: \"0\"\n\n            Step 6: Process token \"0\": \n                c='0' -> append '0' -> d = \"0\"\n            Then output \"0\\n\".\n\n        So we output \"0\\n\", which matches.\n\n        But what if the first token is not in list1? \n            Example: if list1 does not contain 1, then tokenVal=2 -> S_str=\"2\"\n\n            Step 3: \n                tmp = 2 * 1 %2019 = 2.\n                mod_cnt[2] becomes 1.\n                mod_cnt[0] becomes 1.\n                ans = 0 for 0: 1*0/2=0, for 2: 1*0/2=0 -> 0.\n\n            Then the rest same -> output \"0\\n\".\n\n        Therefore, it works.\n\n        But note: the third program's output is always \"0\\n\" for the inputs we have. However, if the second program outputs a non-zero integer that contains digits other than '0' and '1', then the third program would filter them. But in our case, the second program outputs 0.\n\n        We'll run one more test: what if the second program outputs 10? Then the token for the third program is \"10\". \n            Process: \n                '1' -> append -> d becomes \"1\"\n                '0' -> append -> d becomes \"10\"\n            Then output \"10\\n\".\n\n        But in our case, the second program outputs 0, so the token is \"0\", and we output \"0\".\n\n        So the program is complete.\n\n        However, we must note: the second program might output a negative number? But the problem says nonnegative.\n\n        We write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the third program's buffer d[100] is set arbitrarily. The token for the third program is the string representation of the second program's output (ans). The maximum length of ans? for a long integer, it's 20 digits. Then the d buffer: worst-case we append every digit, so at most 20 characters? then 100 is safe.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" So we only read at the beginning and print at the end.\n\n        We are doing that.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        Note: We must free memory? but the program ends. But we free for good practice.\n\n        But note: the second program's mod_arr: we allocated with N (which is 1) so it's small.\n\n        We free list1, list2, mod_arr.\n\n        Final code:"
