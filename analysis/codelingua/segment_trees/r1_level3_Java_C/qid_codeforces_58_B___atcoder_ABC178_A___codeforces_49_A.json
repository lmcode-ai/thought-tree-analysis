But note: the original second program reads a single integer and then outputs either 0 or 1. However, in the chain, the input for the second program is the output of the first program? But wait: the first program outputs multiple numbers. How do we chain?\n\nActually, the chain must be defined by the input/output. The problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nHowever, the first program (codeforces_58_B) outputs multiple integers (each on a new line). The second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) reads only one integer. So how do we chain?\n\nWe have to reinterpret the chain: the entire output of the first program becomes the input of the second? But the second program only reads the first token? That would be the first integer (which is the original n). Then the second program outputs one integer (either 0 or 1). Then the third program reads a whole line? But the output of the second is just one integer (and then a newline). The third program expects a string.\n\nBut note: the original programs are independent and each reads from standard input and writes to standard output. When chaining, we have to consider that the output of the first program is a sequence of integers (each printed on a separate line). The second program then reads the first integer from that output (ignoring the rest) and outputs either 0 or 1. Then the third program reads the output of the second (which is one integer and a newline) as a string? But the third program's example input is a string (a question) and it checks the last non-space, non-question mark character to see if it's a vowel.\n\nThis chain does not seem to make sense. However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the entire output of the first program (which is multiple lines) is fed as input to the second program. But the second program only reads one integer. Then what happens to the rest? The second program leaves the rest of the input unread? Then the third program would read the next line? But the third program uses `nextLine()` which would read the rest of the input? Actually, after the second program reads one integer, the rest of the input (which is the rest of the output from the first) would be available for the third program? But the third program expects a single line.\n\nAlternatively, we have to reconsider: the problem might intend that each program in the chain is run independently and the output is captured and then fed as input to the next. However, the second program only uses the first integer from the output of the first. The third program then gets the output of the second (which is one integer) and then the rest of the output from the first is lost? That doesn't seem right.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" and \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we have to simulate the chaining without I/O in the middle. We have to capture the output of the first step and pass it to the second, and then the output of the second to the third.\n\nLet me break down:\n\nStep 1: Read an integer n (from stdin) and then produce a list of integers: starting with n, then the next divisor (which is the next number that divides the current m) until 1. For example, if n=10, the output would be:\n10 \n5 \n1\n\nBut note: the first program outputs: \"10 \" (with a space, and then a newline for each). Actually, the first program uses:\n    System.out.println(n + \" \");\n    ... and then for each found i: System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\nBut note: `println` prints the string and then a newline. So for n=10, the output is:\n10 \n5 \n1 \n\nEach number is on a new line, but note that there is a space after each number? Actually, it's printing the number and then a space and then a newline? So the first line is \"10 \\n\", then \"5 \\n\", then \"1 \\n\".\n\nStep 2: The second program reads one integer from stdin. It reads the first token (which would be 10). Then it sets:\n    boolean bool = (x == 1) ? true : false;\n    int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\nSo if x is 1, then bool becomes true, then result = 0. Otherwise, result = 1.\n\nSo for x=10, result=1.\n\nThen it prints `result` (so prints 1) and flushes.\n\nStep 3: The third program reads a line from stdin. The input to the third program is the output of the second program: which is \"1\\n\" (if the second program got 10) or \"0\\n\" (if the second program got 1). Then it processes that string.\n\nIt goes backwards until it finds a non-space, non-question mark character. Then it converts that character to lowercase and checks if it's a vowel or 'y'. Then prints \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the string read by the third program is the entire output of the second program? In the example, if the second program outputs \"1\\n\", then the string is \"1\\n\". The last non-space, non-question mark character is the newline? Actually, no: the newline is a space? The condition in the third program: \n    if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?')\n\nSo the newline character is not a space? (Note: in Java, the newline is '\\n', which is not a space). So it would break at the last non-space, non-question mark, which is the last character that isn't one of those. In the string \"1\\n\", the last character is '\\n'. Then we skip that? Actually, we break when we find a non-space and non-question mark? But the loop goes from the end backwards until it finds one. So in \"1\\n\", the last character is '\\n' -> skip? Then the next character (if any) is at index length-2? Actually, the string \"1\\n\" has two characters: '1' and '\\n'. The loop starts at index 1 (i=length-1=1) and checks: s.charAt(1) is '\\n' -> skip? Then i=0: s.charAt(0) is '1' -> non-space and non-question mark -> ch='1'. Then we convert to lowercase: still '1'. Then we check: is it a vowel? or 'y'? -> no. So it would output \"NO\".\n\nBut if the second program outputs \"0\\n\", then the last non-space non-question character is '0' -> then output \"NO\".\n\nWait, what if the second program outputs a number without a newline? But the second program uses `out.println(result);` so it appends a newline.\n\nSo the third program will always get a string that ends with a newline? Then the last non-space, non-question character is the digit (either '0' or '1')? Because the newline is skipped and then the digit is found.\n\nBut note: the third program was designed for a question string, but we are feeding it a digit and a newline. So the last non-space, non-question character is the digit. Then we check that digit.\n\nNow, what is the chain? \nInput to the entire program: one integer (for the first program).\n\nThen the first program produces a list of integers (each on a line: with a space and then a newline). But the second program only reads the first integer from that list. Then the third program reads the output of the second (which is one integer and a newline) and then outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the entire output of the first program is not entirely consumed by the second? How do we handle that in a single C program without I/O in the middle? We are not actually running separate processes. We have to simulate the chain.\n\nWe have to:\n\n1. Read the integer n (only once, at the beginning).\n2. Simulate the first program: we don't output, but we need the first integer (n) and then we need to know the next integers? But the second program only uses the first integer (n). So we don't need the entire list for the chain? Actually, the second program only reads the first integer (the original n). So we can ignore the rest of the output of the first program? \n\nBut wait: the third program does not get the rest of the first program's output. It only gets the output of the second program. So the chain is:\n\n  Input: n\n  Step1: output = [n, ...] (multiple lines) -> but Step2 only reads the first token (n) from that output and produces either 0 or 1.\n  Step3: reads the entire output of Step2 (which is one line: either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\") and then produces \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nSo in the combined program:\n\n  We read n.\n  Then we compute what the second program would output given the first integer n (which is the same n we read). The second program's output depends solely on n: \n        if n == 1 -> output 0\n        else -> output 1\n\n  Then we take that output (a string of either \"0\" or \"1\" and then a newline) and feed it to the third program? But note: the third program is designed to look at the last non-space, non-question mark character. In the string \"0\\n\", the last non-space non-question mark is '0'. Similarly, \"1\\n\" has last non-space non-question mark '1'. Then we check if that character is a vowel? It's not. So the third program would always output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: that doesn't match the original chain? The original chain: \n  For n=10: \n      Step1: outputs 10, 5, 1 (each on a line with a trailing space and newline).\n      Step2: reads 10 -> outputs 1 (and then a newline).\n      Step3: reads \"1\\n\" -> last non-space non-question is '1' -> not a vowel -> outputs \"NO\".\n\n  For n=1:\n      Step1: outputs 1 (on a line).\n      Step2: reads 1 -> outputs 0 (and then a newline).\n      Step3: reads \"0\\n\" -> outputs \"NO\".\n\nSo the entire chain for any n outputs \"NO\". \n\nBut that seems odd. However, that's what the chain does.\n\nAlternatively, we might have misunderstood the chaining. The problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the entire output of the first program is the input to the second program. The second program then reads the first token (the integer 10) and leaves the rest (the lines with 5 and 1) unread. Then the third program would read from the same input stream? But the problem states that each program reads from standard input and writes to standard output. In a pipe, the second program would only see the entire output of the first. And the third program would only see the entire output of the second. The unread data from the first program is lost because the second program only reads one token? Then the third program only gets the output of the second.\n\nBut in the combined program, we don't have to worry about the unread data because the next program in the chain only gets the output of the previous one. So the second program does not see the entire output of the first? Actually, in a pipe, the second program's standard input is the entire output of the first. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, the second program can read the first integer and leave the rest unread. But then the third program does not get the unread part? The third program gets a new pipe: the output of the second. The unread part of the first program's output is lost.\n\nTherefore, in the combined program:\n\n  We only need to do:\n      read n (the first integer from stdin)\n      then compute the output of the second program: \n          if n==1 -> output 0, else output 1.\n      then take that output (as a string: either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\") and then run the third program's logic on that string.\n\nBut note: the third program was designed to read a line. The output of the second program is a line (with a newline). So the third program will read the entire line (which is either \"0\" or \"1\", and then a newline). \n\nSo the combined program:\n\n  Step1: Read n (from stdin).\n  Step2: Compute result2 = (n==1) ? 0 : 1.\n  Step3: Create a string s that is either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\". Then process that string as in the third program.\n\nBut wait: the third program's code:\n\n    String s = sc.nextLine();\n    int length = s.length();\n    char ch = 0;\n    for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n            ch = s.charAt(i);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    ch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n    if (ch == 'a' || ...) ...\n\nIn our case, the string s is either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\". But note: the newline is part of the string? In Java, when you read a line with `nextLine()`, it consumes the line without the trailing newline? Actually, no: `nextLine()` returns the line without the newline. So the string s would be either \"0\" or \"1\", without the newline.\n\nBut wait: the second program uses `println` which prints the integer and then a newline. Then when the third program uses `nextLine()`, it reads the next line (which is the entire line without the newline). So the string s is either \"0\" or \"1\", without any newline.\n\nSo the string s is either \"0\" or \"1\", each of length 1.\n\nThen the loop: \n    i starts at length-1 (which is 0) -> check the character at index 0: which is either '0' or '1'. It is not a space and not a question mark -> we set ch to that character.\n\nThen we convert to lowercase: which doesn't change '0' or '1'.\n\nThen we check: is it a vowel? -> no. So we output \"NO\".\n\nSo the entire program for any n will output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, the combined C program:\n\n  Read an integer n.\n  Then output \"NO\".\n\nBut wait: is that correct? Let's test with the original chain:\n\n  Input: 10\n  First program: outputs\n        10 \n        5 \n        1 \n  Second program: reads the first integer 10 -> outputs 1 (and then a newline).\n  Third program: reads the string \"1\" (without the newline? because nextLine() strips the newline) -> then checks the last non-space non-question character: which is '1' -> outputs \"NO\".\n\n  Input: 1\n  First program: outputs\n        1 \n  Second program: reads 1 -> outputs 0 (and then a newline).\n  Third program: reads the string \"0\" -> outputs \"NO\".\n\nSo the output is always \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the first program is actually producing more output? But that output is not used by the subsequent programs. So we can skip the entire computation of the first program? We only need the first integer (which we read) and then we do the second and third steps.\n\nTherefore, the combined C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <ctype.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n      // Step2: compute the result for the second program\n      int result2;\n      if (n == 1) {\n          result2 = 0;\n      } else {\n          result2 = 1;\n      }\n\n      // Now, the third program: \n      // We have to create the string that the third program would read: which is the string representation of result2, and note that the third program reads a line (so without the newline, because the second program's println becomes a newline that is consumed by the nextLine() as a delimiter).\n\n      // But the third program does not see the newline? It sees a string without the newline. So we have a string containing either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n      // We can represent that string as a character array: \n      char s[2]; // we'll have one character and then a null terminator\n      sprintf(s, \"%d\", result2); // s will be either \"0\" or \"1\"\n\n      // Now, find the last non-space, non-question mark character in the string s.\n      int len = strlen(s);\n      char ch = 0;\n      for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n          if (s[i] != ' ' && s[i] != '?') {\n              ch = s[i];\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n      // Convert to lowercase: but note the string is digits, so tolower doesn't change.\n      ch = tolower(ch);\n\n      // Check if ch is a vowel or 'y'\n      if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u' || ch == 'y') {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nHowever, we know that the string s is either \"0\" or \"1\", so the last non-space non-question character is the only character in the string. And that character is either '0' or '1'. Then we convert to lowercase (still '0' or '1') and then check: which is not a vowel. So we always print \"NO\".\n\nWe can simplify:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      // We don't even need to compute the second step? because the third step will always output \"NO\"?\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut is that the same behavior? Yes, because the chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\nHowever, what if the second program outputs a number that has a vowel in its string representation? For example, if the second program outputs 11? But the second program only outputs 0 or 1. So the string is either \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nTherefore, the simplified program is:\n\n  Read n, then print \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain does compute the entire divisor chain in the first program? But that output is not used by the subsequent programs. However, the problem does not require to compute the divisor chain? Because the second program only uses the first integer (n) and then the divisor chain is ignored.\n\nSo we don't have to compute the divisor chain? We only need the first integer (n) and then we do the second and third steps.\n\nBut wait: what if the first program had side effects? The problem says the entire sequence. However, the first program only outputs to stdout, and in the chain that output is captured and fed to the second program. But we are not actually outputting it in the combined program. However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. So we don't output the divisor chain? That's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut wait: what if the third program had a different behavior for a different output of the second program? But the second program only outputs 0 or 1, and the third program always outputs \"NO\" for these values.\n\nAlternatively, we could do the entire computation of the first program and then ignore the rest? But that would be inefficient. The problem does not require it.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The observable behavior is: read one integer and then output \"NO\". So the above program is correct.\n\nHowever, let me reexamine the chain with a different example: what if the second program output a vowel? For example, if the second program output 97? But the second program only outputs 0 or 1. So it's safe.\n\nBut what if the first program outputs a lot? We don't care because the second program only reads the first integer. So we don't need to simulate the entire divisor chain.\n\nTherefore, the C program is:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      int n;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut wait: what if the third program had a bug? Actually, we are reproducing the same behavior. The chain always outputs \"NO\", so we output \"NO\".\n\nHowever, note: the third program was originally designed for a string that ends with a letter. But we are feeding it a digit. So it outputs \"NO\". \n\nBut what if the input to the entire chain was 1? Then the first program outputs \"1 \\n\", the second program outputs \"0\\n\", the third program outputs \"NO\". So same as above.\n\nTherefore, the program is correct.\n\nBut to be safe, we can also note: the third program does not depend on the entire divisor chain? So we don't need to compute it.\n\nFinal code:"
