But note: the string might not contain any \"BC\", so we can just copy.

We are doing a single pass. Then we traverse the string buffer2 to compute `cnt` and `tmp` as in the second program. long cnt = 0;\n            long tmp = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer2[i]; i++) {\n                if (buffer2[i] == 'A') {\n                    tmp++;\n                } else if (buffer2[i] == 'D') {\n                    cnt += tmp;\n                } else {\n                    tmp = 0;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Step3: Now we have a long integer `cnt`. We then run the third program with n = (int)cnt? But note: the third program reads an integer. The value of `cnt` might be too big for an int? The problem says the third program reads an integer. We have to cast to int? But the third program uses `int n = sc.nextInt()`. So we assume that `cnt` is within the range of int. Then we do:\n\n                printf(\"%d \", n);   // without newline? The original program prints without newline? Actually, the first print is `System.out.println(n + \" \")` -> that is a newline. So we should print with newline? But wait: \n                System.out.println(n + \" \") This prints the string (n + \" \") and then a newline.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into a single C program.\n The input is read only at the beginning (from the first program) and the output is produced at the end (from the last program).\n However, note that the second program (BABC) takes a string input and the third program (codeforces_58_B) takes an integer input.\n But the first program (atcoder_AGC007_C) reads three doubles: N, d, x.\n\n How do we chain them?\n The original sequence: \n   Program 1: reads three doubles, does some computation, and outputs a decimal number (with 20 fractional digits).\n   Program 2: reads a string (from stdin), replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", then does a counting process and outputs a long.\n   Program 3: reads an integer, then outputs a sequence of integers.\n\n But note: the output of program 1 is a decimal number, which is then used as the input for program 2? \n However, program 2 expects a string. This doesn't match.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n But the three programs are independent? They read different inputs.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n So we must read all the input at the beginning? But the three programs read different inputs.\n\n However, note that the example programs are independent. The problem does not specify how the output of one is the input of the next.\n\n After reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n This implies:\n   Input to the entire chain: the input for the first program.\n   Then the output of the first program becomes the input to the second.\n   Then the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n\n   Program 1: reads three doubles (N, d, x) and outputs a decimal number (with 20 fractional digits).\n   Program 2: expects a string (like \"ABCBD\" etc.) and outputs a long integer.\n   Program 3: expects an integer and outputs a sequence of integers.\n\n The output of program 1 is a floating-point number (with many decimals), and program 2 expects a string. \n How can we chain them? We must convert the output of program 1 to a string and use that as input for program 2?\n\n But the example programs are from different problems and likely not designed to be chained. \n\n However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\" when run on the same input.\n\n But note: the entire chain. The input to the chain is the input for the first program? Then the output of the first program is fed as input to the second? \n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact chaining, we have to assume that the original input to the chain is the input for the first program, and then the output of the first program is the input for the second, and so on.\n\n But the programs are from different problems and might not be compatible.\n\n Let me analyze the intended chain:\n\n   Step 1: Input is three doubles (N, d, x) -> Program 1 runs and outputs a decimal string (with 20 fractional digits).\n   Step 2: That decimal string becomes the input to Program 2? But Program 2 replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts. The decimal string might not contain 'B' or 'C'. \n            So the second program would output 0? Then step 3: the input to Program 3 is the integer 0? Then it would output \"0 \" and then nothing because the loop from i=0-1 to 0 (i>0) would not run.\n\n This doesn't seem meaningful.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that each program is run independently on the same original input? But that contradicts \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After re-reading the problem: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So we must chain them. Therefore, we must design:\n\n   Read the initial input (which is for the first program) from stdin.\n\n   Run the first program's logic and capture its output (as a string) without printing it.\n\n   Then use that string as the input for the second program.\n\n   Then run the second program's logic and capture its output (as a string) without printing it.\n\n   Then use that string as the input for the third program.\n\n   Then run the third program's logic and print its output.\n\n However, the third program prints multiple integers on separate lines. We must capture that entire output and then print it at the end.\n\n But note: the third program does not return a single value, it prints a sequence.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" meaning the entire output of the chain is the output of the third program.\n\n How to do this in C?\n\n We have to simulate:\n\n   Step 1: Read three doubles (N, d, x) and compute the result of the first program (a BigDecimal represented as a string with 20 fractional digits).\n\n   Step 2: Take that string and use it as the input for the second program. The second program replaces \"BC\" with \"D\" and then counts the number of A's that are followed by D's (with possible consecutive A's). Then it produces a long integer.\n\n   Step 3: Convert that long integer to a string? Then the third program expects an integer. So we convert the output of step2 (a long) to an integer? But note the third program reads an integer and then prints a sequence.\n\n However, there are issues:\n\n   The first program's output is a floating-point number. The second program is designed to process a string that may contain letters. How do we reconcile?\n\n   Example: if the first program outputs \"123.456\", then the second program will replace \"BC\" in that string? There are no 'B' or 'C' so it becomes \"123.456\". Then the second program counts: \n        It goes through each character. When it sees 'A', it increments tmp. But there's no 'A'? Then it sees 'D'? Only the digits and the dot. So the count remains 0.\n\n   Then the third program gets the integer 0. It prints \"0 \" and then the loop: m=0, then for i from -1 down to 1? Actually, the loop condition is i>0, so it runs from -1? No, n=0? Actually, the third program reads an integer n. Here n=0.\n\n   The program: \n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints \"0 \"\n        int m = n;  // m=0\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--)  // i = 0-1 = -1; condition i>0 is false -> loop doesn't run.\n\n   So the output is \"0 \".\n\n But is that the intended chain? The problem does not specify the intended overall behavior.\n\n Since the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain\", we have to assume that the input to the entire chain is the three doubles for the first program, and then the chain proceeds as described.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We read three doubles: N, d, x.\n\n   We run the first program's logic to compute a BigDecimal value (we'll use high precision in C, perhaps with `double` or `long double`? But note: the Java program uses BigDecimal for arbitrary precision. We might need to use a library? However, the problem says to output in C. We can use `double` but we risk precision. Alternatively, we can use strings to simulate the BigDecimal? But that is complex.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the first program does iterative calculations and then outputs with 20 fractional digits. We can try to use `double` in C, but the problem is that the iterative steps involve many operations and might accumulate error.\n\n   However, the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. We must be cautious.\n\n   Let me try to rewrite the first program without BigDecimal? The operations:\n\n        ans = 0.0\n        while (N > 0.5):\n            adnum = d + x * (N - 0.5)\n            ans += adnum\n            d = (N+1)*d/N + (5*x)/(2*N)\n            x = (1 + 2/N) * x\n            N = N - 1\n\n   We can use `double` for this? The values of N start at up to ... the input N? The input N is a double? It could be fractional? Actually, the sample input in the original problem (AGC007_C) is integers. But the problem says double.\n\n   We'll use `double` for the first program and then format the answer to 20 fractional digits. We'll use `snprintf` to convert to a string.\n\n   Step 2: The second program takes the string we just produced (the formatted double) and processes it:\n\n        s = the string (without any newline? The Java program uses `format.format(ans)`)\n        Then replace every occurrence of \"BC\" by \"D\". But note: the string is a floating-point number. It won't contain the substring \"BC\". So the replacement does nothing.\n\n        Then traverse the string:\n            tmp = 0\n            cnt = 0\n            for each char c in s:\n                if c == 'A': tmp++\n                else if c == 'D': cnt += tmp\n                else: tmp = 0\n\n        Then the result is a long integer (cnt).\n\n   Step 3: The third program takes an integer (the cnt from step2). Then:\n\n        n = cnt\n        Print n and a space: printf(\"%d \", n);\n        m = n\n        for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                printf(\"%d \", i);\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        But note: the original program prints each number followed by a space and then a newline? Actually, it uses `System.out.println` for the first one and then for each in the loop. So each is on a new line? Actually, no: the first prints n and a space (without newline) and then in the loop it prints i and a space (without newline). Then after the loop, the program ends? There is no trailing newline? Actually, the last print is without newline.\n\n        However, the problem says to output exactly as the original chain. The third program's output is:\n\n            n + \" \"\n            then for each i that satisfies the condition: i + \" \"\n\n        So the entire output is a sequence of integers separated by spaces.\n\n        But the entire chain's output is the output of the third program.\n\n   However, note: the first program outputs a floating-point number with 20 fractional digits (and a newline? In the Java code: `System.out.println(format.format(ans))` -> so it adds a newline). But we are capturing the string without the newline? Or with? We must remove the newline if present because the second program reads the entire next token? Actually, the second program reads the entire next token? No, the second program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token (without spaces). But the floating-point number might have a decimal point and digits, and then a newline. The `in.next()` would read the entire number as a string? Without the newline? Actually, the Scanner by default uses whitespace as delimiter. So the token would be the floating-point string without the newline.\n\n   But we are not using a scanner in C for the intermediate steps. We are passing the string we built (without newline) to the second program.\n\n   How we design:\n\n        Step1: \n            double N, d, x;\n            scanf(\"%lf %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n            Then we simulate the loop (with double variables) to compute `ans`.\n\n            Then we format `ans` to a string with 20 fractional digits. We can use:\n                char buffer1[1000];\n                snprintf(buffer1, sizeof(buffer1), \"%.20f\", ans);\n\n            However, note: Java's DecimalFormat with 20 fractional digits might format differently? It uses the default rounding? We can use the same in C: %.20f.\n\n        Step2: \n            We have the string in buffer1. Now we want to replace every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\". But note: the string is a number, so we can skip this? But we do the replacement anyway.\n\n            However, we must note: the replacement might create new occurrences? For example, if we have \"ABCBC\", then replacing the first \"BC\" gives \"ADBC\", then replacing the next \"BC\" gives \"ADD\". But the original program replaces all non-overlapping occurrences? Yes, because it uses `replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\")`.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                char buffer2[1000]; // for the replaced string\n                // We traverse buffer1 and whenever we see \"BC\", we replace by 'D' and skip the next character.\n\n                But note: the string might not contain any \"BC\", so we can just copy.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                int j = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; buffer1[i]; i++) {\n                    if (buffer1[i] == 'B' && buffer1[i+1] == 'C') {\n                        buffer2[j++] = 'D';\n                        i++; // skip the next character\n                    } else {\n                        buffer2[j++] = buffer1[i];\n                    }\n                }\n                buffer2[j] = '\\0';\n\n            But wait, the Java program replaces ALL occurrences of \"BC\" by \"D\", and the replacement is done on the entire string at once. We are doing a single pass.\n\n            Then we traverse the string buffer2 to compute `cnt` and `tmp` as in the second program.\n\n            long cnt = 0;\n            long tmp = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer2[i]; i++) {\n                if (buffer2[i] == 'A') {\n                    tmp++;\n                } else if (buffer2[i] == 'D') {\n                    cnt += tmp;\n                } else {\n                    tmp = 0;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Step3: \n            Now we have a long integer `cnt`. We then run the third program with n = (int)cnt? But note: the third program reads an integer. The value of `cnt` might be too big for an int? The problem says the third program reads an integer. We have to cast to int? But the third program uses `int n = sc.nextInt()`. So we assume that `cnt` is within the range of int.\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                printf(\"%d \", n);   // without newline? The original program prints without newline? Actually, the first print is `System.out.println(n + \" \")` -> that is a newline. So we should print with newline? \n\n            But wait: \n                System.out.println(n + \" \") \n                This prints the string (n + \" \") and then a newline.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", n);   // but note: the original program prints the number, then a space, then a newline.\n\n            However, the next prints in the loop are `System.out.println(i + \" \")` which also print the number, a space, and a newline.\n\n            But the problem says the entire chain's output is the output of the third program. And the third program outputs:\n\n                [n] followed by a space and a newline\n                then for each i: [i] followed by a space and a newline\n\n            So we have:\n\n                printf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n                for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n                    if (m % i == 0) {\n                        printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n                        m = i;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            However, the original program does not output a newline after every number? It uses `println` which adds a newline. So we do the same.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". We are only printing at the end (in the third block) and that is allowed.\n\n   However, note: the first program in the chain originally printed a floating-point number with 20 fractional digits and a newline. But we are not printing that at the beginning? We are capturing it as a string for the next step. Similarly, the second program originally printed the long integer and a newline. But we are capturing that as an integer for the third step.\n\n   So the entire chain in C:\n\n        Read three doubles.\n\n        Step1: compute the BigDecimal value (as a double) and format it to a string with 20 fractional digits (without newline? Because the next step uses `in.next()` which would not include the newline). But note: the formatting in Java did have a newline? We must not include the newline in the string for step2.\n\n        How did we format? We used snprintf to a string without including a newline.\n\n        Step2: process that string (replace \"BC\" by \"D\") and then count.\n\n        Step3: use the count as an integer and then print the sequence as described (with each number followed by a space and a newline? Actually, the original program used `println` for each, so each is on a separate line).\n\n   But note: the third program in the original code does:\n\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints n, then a space, then a newline? Actually, no: the argument is a string: n + \" \" -> which is a string without a newline? Then `println` adds a newline.\n\n        So it prints: (n + \" \") and then a newline.\n\n        Similarly, in the loop: it prints (i + \" \") and then a newline.\n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            printf(\"%d \\n\", n);   // This prints: <n><space><newline>\n\n            Then in the loop: \n                for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n                    if (m % i == 0) {\n                        printf(\"%d \\n\", i);   // prints: <i><space><newline>\n                        m = i;\n                    }\n                }\n\n        However, note: the space and the newline: the string printed is exactly the same as in Java.\n\n   But the problem says: the entire chain's output is the output of the third program. So we are printing the sequence of integers, each on a separate line? Actually, each print is a line: the string is the integer, then a space, then the newline.\n\n   However, the original third program does not print a trailing newline at the end of the entire output? Actually, the last number printed (which is the last divisor) is printed with a newline. So the entire output ends with a newline.\n\n   But what if the input to the third program is 0? Then we print \"0 \\n\" and then the loop doesn't run. So the output is one line.\n\n   So the C program structure:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <math.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            double N, d, x;\n            scanf(\"%lf %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n            // Step1: the first program\n            double ans = 0.0;\n            double current_N = N;\n            double current_d = d;\n            double current_x = x;\n\n            while (current_N > 0.5) {\n                double adnum = current_d + current_x * (current_N - 0.5);\n                ans += adnum;\n\n                // Update d and x for the next iteration\n                double next_d = (current_N + 1.0) * current_d / current_N + (5.0 * current_x) / (2.0 * current_N);\n                double next_x = (1.0 + (2.0 / current_N)) * current_x;\n                current_d = next_d;\n                current_x = next_x;\n                current_N -= 1.0;\n            }\n\n            // Format ans to a string with 20 fractional digits\n            char buffer1[1000];\n            snprintf(buffer1, sizeof(buffer1), \"%.20f\", ans);\n\n            // Step2: the second program\n            // Replace \"BC\" with \"D\" in buffer1 -> store in buffer2\n            char buffer2[1000];\n            int j = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer1[i] != '\\0'; ) {\n                if (buffer1[i] == 'B' && buffer1[i+1] == 'C') {\n                    buffer2[j++] = 'D';\n                    i += 2;\n                } else {\n                    buffer2[j++] = buffer1[i];\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n            buffer2[j] = '\\0';\n\n            // Now traverse buffer2 to compute cnt\n            long cnt = 0;\n            long tmp = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer2[i]; i++) {\n                if (buffer2[i] == 'A') {\n                    tmp++;\n                } else if (buffer2[i] == 'D') {\n                    cnt += tmp;\n                } else {\n                    tmp = 0;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step3: the third program\n            int n = (int)cnt;   // cast to int? But the third program uses int. Note: if cnt is too big, we truncate. But the problem says the input to the third program is an integer.\n            // But the third program uses an integer. We assume n is in the range of int.\n\n            // Print the sequence as in the third program\n            printf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n            int m = n;\n            // Note: the loop condition: i from n-1 down to 1 (inclusive) because i>0\n            for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {\n                if (m % i == 0) {\n                    printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n                    m = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the third program does not print anything else? And we have printed the entire sequence.\n\n   But there is a problem: the first program's formatting in Java uses DecimalFormat which might use locale-specific formatting? In C, snprintf uses the current locale. We want a period as the decimal separator? The Java program uses a period? Yes.\n\n   We can set the locale to \"C\" to ensure period?\n\n        #include <locale.h>\n        setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"C\");\n\n   But the problem does not specify the locale. However, the original program uses a period.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid locale by using formatting that is independent? We can use:\n\n        snprintf(buffer1, sizeof(buffer1), \"%.20f\", ans);\n\n   This will use the current locale. To force period, we can use:\n\n        #include <locale.h>\n        setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\");\n\n   Or we can use a more controlled formatting? But the problem says the original chain.\n\n   Let me assume that the environment is set to use period.\n\n   Another issue: the first program in Java uses BigDecimal and might have more precision? We are using double in C which might not be enough for 20 fractional digits? The problem says to reproduce the same behavior. We might need to use `long double`? But the input is double and the operations are not extremely complex. Let me try with double and see if it passes the sample? But we don't have a sample.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use `long double` for the first program to get more precision.\n\n   Steps for long double:\n\n        We read with `scanf` using `%Lf`? But note: the input is double? The problem says the input is doubles. We can read into long double? But the input might be in the range of double.\n\n        We change:\n\n            long double N, d, x;\n            scanf(\"%Lf %Lf %Lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n        Then in the computation, use long double.\n\n        Format the long double with snprintf? The standard doesn't guarantee long double support in snprintf. Alternatively, we can use `sprintf` with `%.20Lf`? But it is C99.\n\n        We assume the system supports it.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the input range. We'll use long double for the first program to get as much precision as possible.\n\n   Revised Step1:\n\n        long double N, d, x;\n        scanf(\"%Lf %Lf %Lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n        long double ans = 0.0;\n        long double current_N = N;\n        long double current_d = d;\n        long double current_x = x;\n\n        while (current_N > 0.5) {\n            long double adnum = current_d + current_x * (current_N - 0.5);\n            ans += adnum;\n\n            long double next_d = (current_N + 1.0) * current_d / current_N + (5.0 * current_x) / (2.0 * current_N);\n            long double next_x = (1.0 + (2.0 / current_N)) * current_x;\n            current_d = next_d;\n            current_x = next_x;\n            current_N -= 1.0;\n        }\n\n        char buffer1[1000];\n        snprintf(buffer1, sizeof(buffer1), \"%.20Lf\", ans);\n\n   But note: the while loop condition: we are subtracting 1.0 from current_N until it is <=0.5. The number of iterations is floor(N) if N is integer? But if N is fractional, we stop when current_N<=0.5.\n\n   However, the original program uses double and then BigDecimal. We are using long double which might have the same or better precision? But we are doing the same operations.\n\n   Let's hope it's enough.\n\n   Now, what if the input N is very large? The loop runs about N times? But N is a double (or long double) and if N is 1e9, the loop would run 1e9 times. That might be too slow.\n\n   However, the original program also runs in O(N). So we assume that the input N is not too big.\n\n   Alternatively, we can derive a closed form? But the problem says to translate the programs.\n\n   We'll do the iterative loop.\n\n   Finally, note: the second program expects a string. The formatting of long double might produce \"inf\" or \"nan\"? We assume valid input.\n\n   Let me write the entire code.\n\n   One more note: the third program's loop: for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--). If n is 0, then i = -1, and the loop condition i>0 is false -> skip. So it's safe.\n\n   If n is negative? The third program does not handle negative. The second program produces a nonnegative count (cnt>=0). So n>=0.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   Code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <math.h>\n        #include <locale.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\"); // to ensure decimal point is '.'\n\n            long double N, d, x;\n            scanf(\"%Lf %Lf %Lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n            // Step1: the first program\n            long double ans = 0.0;\n            long double current_N = N;\n            long double current_d = d;\n            long double current_x = x;\n\n            while (current_N > 0.5) {\n                long double adnum = current_d + current_x * (current_N - 0.5);\n                ans += adnum;\n\n                long double next_d = (current_N + 1.0) * current_d / current_N + (5.0 * current_x) / (2.0 * current_N);\n                long double next_x = (1.0 + (2.0 / current_N)) * current_x;\n                current_d = next_d;\n                current_x = next_x;\n                current_N -= 1.0;\n            }\n\n            char buffer1[1000];\n            snprintf(buffer1, sizeof(buffer1), \"%.20Lf\", ans);\n\n            // Step2: the second program\n            char buffer2[1000];\n            int j = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer1[i] != '\\0'; ) {\n                if (buffer1[i] == 'B' && buffer1[i+1] == 'C') {\n                    buffer2[j++] = 'D';\n                    i += 2; // skip two characters\n                } else {\n                    buffer2[j++] = buffer1[i];\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n            buffer2[j] = '\\0';\n\n            long cnt = 0;\n            long tmp = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; buffer2[i]; i++) {\n                if (buffer2[i] == 'A') {\n                    tmp++;\n                } else if (buffer2[i] == 'D') {\n                    cnt += tmp;\n                } else {\n                    tmp = 0;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step3: the third program\n            int n = (int)cnt;\n            // If cnt is too big for int, we cast. But the problem says the third program reads an integer (int). So we do as the original.\n            printf(\"%d \\n\", n);\n            int m = n;\n            for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {\n                if (m % i == 0) {\n                    printf(\"%d \\n\", i);\n                    m = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   However, note: the third program in the original code does not print anything if the condition fails? So we skip non-divisors.\n\n   But the problem says to output exactly as the chain. We are done.\n\n   Let me test with a small input?\n\n   Input for first program: 1 1 1\n\n   Step1:\n        N=1, d=1, x=1.\n        Loop: current_N=1.0 -> >0.5 -> true.\n            adnum = 1 + 1*(1-0.5) = 1+0.5 = 1.5 -> ans=1.5.\n            next_d = (1+1)*1/1 + (5*1)/(2*1) = 2 + 2.5 = 4.5\n            next_x = (1+2/1)*1 = 3\n            Then current_N becomes 0 -> break.\n\n        So ans = 1.5 -> formatted as \"1.50000000000000000000\"\n\n   Step2:\n        Replace \"BC\" in \"1.50000000000000000000\" -> same string.\n        Traverse:\n            '1' -> else: tmp=0\n            '.' -> else: tmp=0\n            '5' -> else: tmp=0\n            ... all digits: tmp remains 0.\n        cnt = 0.\n\n   Step3: n=0 -> print \"0 \\n\", then loop: i = -1 -> skip.\n\n        Output: \"0 \\n\"\n\n   But the original first program would output \"1.50000000000000000000\\n\" (with newline) and then the second program would read that token? Then the second program would output \"0\\n\", then the third program would output \"0 \\n\" (and then nothing). So the entire chain output is \"0 \\n\".\n\n   Our program outputs the same.\n\n   However, the original first program outputs the formatted string with 20 fractional digits and a newline. But we are not printing that intermediate result? We are passing the string without newline to the second program? But the second program uses `in.next()` which reads tokens (without newline). So it's the same.\n\n   But note: the second program in the original code would read the entire token (the string without spaces) and then the newline would be left? Actually, the scanner would skip the newline? The token is the entire floating-point string. So we are correct.\n\n   Therefore, we output the entire code as described.\n\n   One more issue: the cast from long to int in step3 might truncate. But the third program uses `int n = sc.nextInt()`. The `nextInt` reads an integer in the range of int. So we assume the value of `cnt` is in the range of int. If it's not, we truncate? But the problem does not specify. We do as the original: the third program would read an integer. So if the value is too big, the original third program would throw an exception? But we are in C. We'll cast.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        int n;\n        if (cnt > INT_MAX) n = INT_MAX;\n        else if (cnt < INT_MIN) n = INT_MIN;\n        else n = (int)cnt;\n\n   But the second program produces a nonnegative `cnt`. So we can do:\n\n        int n = (cnt > INT_MAX) ? INT_MAX : (int)cnt;\n\n   But the original third program would not read a number larger than INT_MAX? In Java, `nextInt` would throw an exception if the token is out of range? But the problem says the input to the third program is an integer. We assume it is in the range.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        #include <limits.h>\n        ...\n        int n;\n        if (cnt > INT_MAX) {\n            n = INT_MAX;\n        } else {\n            n = (int)cnt;\n        }\n\n   But the problem does not specify the constraints. We'll do it to avoid overflow.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem says the original chain. We are not told the constraints. We'll assume the value is within int.\n\n   Since the second program counts the number of A's followed by D's in a string that is the formatted double (at most 1000 characters), the maximum cnt is about (number of A's) * (number of D's) and the string length is 1000, so the maximum cnt is about 500*500 = 250000, which is within int.\n\n   So we can cast safely.\n\n   Final code without including the overflow check.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n   Note: the long double snprintf might not be available in some compilers? But we assume C99.\n\n   We'll write the code as below.\n\n   One last note: the first program uses BigDecimal and might have done exact arithmetic? We are using long double which might have rounding errors. But we hope that 20 fractional digits are accurate enough.\n\n   We output the code."
