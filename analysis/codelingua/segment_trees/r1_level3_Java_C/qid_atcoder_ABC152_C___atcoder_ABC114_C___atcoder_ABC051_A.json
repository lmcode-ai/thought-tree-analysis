We can do:\n\n          char *s = string_of_i;\n          int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n          for (int j=0; s[j]; j++) {\n              if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n              else if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n              else if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n          }\n          if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n      Then generate the next candidate:\n\n          We'll build a new string for the next number. We traverse the original string from right to left. Steps:\n\n            int len = strlen(s);\n            char *sb = (char*)malloc(len+2); // we might add one digit at the end, and then the null terminator. int index = 0;   // index in sb (we are building backwards, then we reverse)\n            int f = 0;       // false\n\n            for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                if (f) {\n                    // just copy the digit\n                    sb[index++] = s[j];\n                } else {\n                    if (s[j]=='3') {\n                        sb[index++] = '5';\n                        f = 1;\n                    } else if (s[j]=='5') {\n                        sb[index++] = '7';\n                        f = 1;\n                    } else if (s[j]=='7') {\n                        sb[index++] = '3';\n                        // f remains 0\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (!f) {\n                // we have to add a digit at the end? But note: we are building backwards, so we are at the most significant end? \n                //",

Then we have f=0, so we append '3' -> then sb becomes \"333\" -> then we reverse? no, the algorithm in Java appends then reverses?

Then the last digit we append is the most significant? But then we reverse the entire string. //      Example: we have built the string as \"333\", then we append '3' -> becomes \"3333\", then reverse -> \"3333\" becomes \"3333\". Then the number is 3333. // But the next number after 777 should be 3333? //      Actually, the algorithm: \n                //        777 -> change every digit to 3 (and we haven't set f, so we do a carry over the entire number and then add a 3 at the end? which becomes 3333. // So we do:\n\n                    sb[index++] = '3';   // this is the extra digit at the end. }\n\n            Then we have to reverse the string in sb? Actually, the Java code does: \n                StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \n                i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString()); So we reverse the string we built. Then convert the reversed string to a long. We must be cautious: the string we built is not null-terminated? We have to null-terminate it. Steps:\n\n          sb[index] = '\\0';\n          // Now reverse the string sb to get the new number string?\n          // But note: we built the string by appending the digits from the least significant (first) to the most significant (last) in the order of processing (which was from the least significant digit to the most significant digit of the original number). Then we added an extra digit at the end (if needed) which becomes the new most significant? Then we reverse the entire string to get the correct order. Example: for 357: \n             Original: \"357\"\n             We process: j0: last digit '7' -> becomes '3' -> so we append '3' -> then j1: '5' -> becomes '7' -> append '7' -> then j2: '3' -> because we set f=true at the second digit, we just append the original digit? Actually, we don't have the original digit? We have the original digit for the current position? Actually, we are at j2: the digit is '3'. We are not in the f state (because we set f=true at the second digit, but we are now at the third digit independently?",

Then the numbers generated in the second program are at most 200000? Actually, the while loop condition is i_val<=N_val, and N_val=A<=200000. So the maximum number we generate is 200000. So we are safe. But note: the second program's generation might produce a number that is larger than 200000? Yes, but then we break the loop. So it's safe. Let me test with a small example: \n      Input for the first program: \n          5\n          4 2 5 1 3   -> A=3. Then the second program: \n          i_val=357 -> 357<=3? false -> so the loop doesn't run -> c=0. Then output 0. But wait: 357>3, so we break immediately -> c=0. Another example: Input: \n          5\n          4 2 5 1 100000   -> then A=4 (because the last element 100000 is not <= the min_so_far (which becomes 1) -> so A=4). Then the second program: \n          i_val=357 -> 357<=4? false -> c=0. Another example: Input: \n          1\n          1000000   -> then min_so_far=1000000 -> A=1. Then the second program: i_val=357>1 -> c=0. How to get a positive count? The first program must output at least 357?",

Then the second program: \n          N_val=10 -> then i_val=357 -> 357>10 -> so c=0. How to get a positive c? The first program must output at least 357.

Then the second program: \n              i_val=357 -> <=1000 -> c becomes 1 (because \"357\" has 3,5,7) -> then generate next number: 373 -> then check: 373: has 3 and 7, but no 5 -> skip. Then next: 375 -> has 3,7,5 -> c=2 -> then 377 -> skip -> then 533 -> has 5,3,3 -> no 7? -> skip -> ... until we get to 777? then next is 3333 (which is 3333>1000? then break) -> so c=2. Then the output is 2. Therefore, the program should work. But note: the second program's generation of the next number:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. The output of the first program becomes the input to the second, and the output of the second becomes the input to the third.\n\nHowever, note that the original programs are designed to take input from standard input and write to standard output. We are to combine them so that:\n- Only the first program reads from stdin.\n- The last program writes to stdout.\n- The intermediate programs process data without I/O (i.e., they get their input from the previous program's output and pass their output to the next program without using stdin/stdout).\n\nBut note: the three programs are independent. We have to understand the input and output of each.\n\nProgram 1 (ABC152_C):\n  Input: First integer N, then N integers.\n  Output: A single integer (the value of `sum`).\n\nProgram 2 (ABC114_C):\n  Input: An integer N (which in the original is read via `gi()`).\n  Output: An integer (the value of `c`).\n\nProgram 3 (ABC051_A):\n  Input: A string (with commas) that is read by `br.readLine()`.\n  Output: The same string with commas replaced by spaces.\n\nHowever, the chain is:\n  Input to the entire system -> Program1 -> (output1) -> Program2 -> (output2) -> Program3 -> (output3) -> stdout.\n\nBut note: Program2 expects an integer input, which is the same as the output of Program1 (an integer). Then Program3 expects a string, which is the output of Program2 (an integer) as a string? Actually, the output of Program2 is an integer and then printed as an integer. Then Program3 expects a string that may contain commas. But the output of Program2 is just an integer without commas. So replacing commas in that string won't change anything.\n\nBut wait: the third program (ABC051_A) replaces commas by spaces. If the output of the second program is a number (without commas) then replacing commas in that string will leave it unchanged. So the entire chain would output the same integer as the second program? \n\nBut let me reexamine the chain:\n\nExample:\n  Suppose the input to the first program is:\n      5\n      4 2 5 1 3\n\n  Then the first program outputs: 3 (because there are 3 positions where the element is the minimum so far from the left).\n\n  Then the second program takes 3 as input. It counts numbers of the form 357, 375, etc. that are <= 3. The smallest such number is 357 which is greater than 3. So it outputs 0.\n\n  Then the third program takes the string \"0\", which has no commas, so it outputs \"0\".\n\nSo the entire chain for this input would output \"0\".\n\nBut note: the third program expects a string that might have commas. Since the output of the second program is an integer (without commas) then the third program will just output the integer as a string.\n\nHowever, the third program is designed to read a whole line and replace commas by spaces. So if the input to the third program is \"0\", then it becomes \"0\" (unchanged). But if the input is \"1,000\", it becomes \"1 000\". But the output of the second program is a simple integer without commas.\n\nSo we can represent the chain as:\n\n  Step 1: Read the first input (for the first program) and compute an integer A.\n  Step 2: Use A as the input to the second program to compute an integer B.\n  Step 3: Convert B to a string and then output that string (without any change because there are no commas) but the third program will replace commas if any. However, since there are none, we can skip the replacement? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior.\n\nBut note: the third program does:\n      String a = br.readLine();\n      ... replace commas by spaces.\n\nSo if the output of the second program is the string \"12345\", then the third program outputs \"12345\". If the output of the second program is \"12,345\", then the third program would output \"12 345\". However, the second program outputs an integer without commas. So we can avoid the replacement step? But we must follow the specification.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the third program is essentially:\n\n      read a string and output the same string with commas replaced by spaces.\n\nBut the input to the third program is the string representation of the integer from the second program. Since that string does not contain commas, we can simply output the integer from the second program. However, to be faithful, we must simulate the third program: convert the integer to a string, then replace commas by spaces (which in this case does nothing) and then output.\n\nBut the problem says: the entire sequence must be reproduced. So we must do exactly the same steps.\n\nHowever, the chain of data:\n\n  Input to the entire system: the input for the first program (N and then N integers).\n  Output of the entire system: the string produced by the third program.\n\nWe are to write a single C program that does:\n\n  Step 1: Read the input for the first program (from stdin).\n  Step 2: Compute the result of the first program (an integer A).\n  Step 3: Use A as the input for the second program and compute the result of the second program (an integer B).\n  Step 4: Convert B to a string and then output that string, but if the string had any commas they would be replaced by spaces. However, since the integer B does not have commas, we can simply output the string of B. But to be safe, we can write the replacement logic.\n\nBut note: the second program (ABC114_C) is more complex. It actually uses a while loop that increments a counter for numbers that are composed only of the digits 3,5,7 and contain each at least once, and then it generates the next candidate number in a special way.\n\nHowever, we are to chain the output of the first program to the second program. The second program originally read an integer from stdin. Now we are going to set the input of the second program to be the integer A (the output of the first program). Similarly, the third program will take the integer B (the output of the second program) as a string and then output it with commas replaced by spaces.\n\nBut note: the third program expects a string that might be multi-line? Actually, the second program outputs a single integer. So the third program reads one line (the integer as a string) and replaces commas by spaces. Since the integer string has no commas, it's the same.\n\nTherefore, the entire C program structure:\n\n  1. Read the input for the first program (N and then N integers).\n  2. Compute the integer A (as the first program does).\n  3. Use A as the input for the second program (i.e., set N = A for the second program) and compute the integer B (the count).\n  4. Convert B to a string and then output that string (without any commas, so we can just output the integer? but the problem says to use the third program). Actually, the third program does a readLine and then replaces commas. Since the second program outputs a single integer and then a newline? Actually, the original second program does: System.out.println(c); which is the integer and then a newline.\n\n  But in our chain, we are not writing to stdout in the second program. We are passing the integer B to the third program. The third program expects to read from stdin? But in our combined program, we are not using stdin for the second and third. Instead, we are passing data in memory.\n\n  The key: the third program in the chain is given the output of the second program as a string. The original third program reads from stdin, but we are going to simulate that by using the string we got from the second program.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      Step 1: Read the first input (using scanf or similar) for the first program.\n      Step 2: Compute A (first program).\n      Step 3: Use A as the input to the second program (so we set the variable N in the second program to A) and run the second program to get B.\n      Step 4: Convert B to a string (without commas, so we don't expect any) and then output that string (without any change? but the third program would replace commas by spaces). However, since the integer string has no commas, we can simply output the string of B.\n\n  But note: the third program in the original code appends a newline? Actually, the third program does:\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        ... replace the string and then System.out.println(sb) -> which is the string and then a newline.\n\n  So we must output the string of B and then a newline.\n\n  However, the original second program also output a newline. So the third program would read the integer string including the newline? Actually, the third program uses `br.readLine()` which reads a line without the newline. Then it replaces commas by spaces and then outputs that string. Then it appends a newline? Actually, the third program does `System.out.println(sb)`, which appends a newline.\n\n  But in the original chain, the second program outputs (for example) \"0\\n\", then the third program reads the line \"0\", replaces commas (does nothing) and then outputs \"0\\n\". So the final output is \"0\\n\".\n\n  In our combined program, we can simply output the integer B as a string and then a newline.\n\n  However, to be exactly the same, we must simulate the third program: take the string representation of B (without any commas) and then output that string and then a newline.\n\n  But note: the third program might have been designed for a string that has commas. Since we know the integer string has no commas, we can skip the replacement? But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". And for the integer string, the replacement does nothing. So we can output the integer and a newline.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\".\n\n  Therefore, we are going to:\n\n      Step 1: Read the input for the first program (from stdin).\n      Step 2: Compute A (the result of the first program).\n      Step 3: Use A as the input to the second program (which we are going to translate to C without I/O, and compute B).\n      Step 4: Output the string representation of B (with a newline) and that's it.\n\n  However, the third program is supposed to replace commas by spaces. But since we know that the integer B has no commas, we can skip that step? But what if the integer is formatted with commas? The original second program outputs an integer without commas. So we are safe.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We must include the third program. Even if it does nothing, we must simulate it? Actually, the third program is part of the chain. However, the third program does:\n\n          String a = br.readLine();   // reads the entire line (which is the output of the second program, without the newline? but the second program outputs a newline, so readLine() discards the newline and returns the string without it)\n          then replaces commas by spaces and then outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n  So if we skip the third program, we would output the integer without a newline? But the second program in the chain originally outputs a newline. Then the third program outputs the same integer without commas (so same) and then a newline. So the output is the integer and two newlines? Actually, no: the second program's output is captured and fed to the third program as a string. The third program reads the entire line (which is the integer as a string without the trailing newline) and then outputs that string (without commas) and then a newline.\n\n  So the entire output is the integer and one newline.\n\n  In our combined program, we are going to output the integer and one newline. So it's the same.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip the third program's replacement step and just output the integer and a newline? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior. The third program might be necessary for other inputs? But note: the input to the third program is the output of the second program, which is an integer without commas.\n\n  However, to be safe and follow the specification, we must include the third program. We are going to:\n\n      Convert the integer B to a string (without any formatting, just the decimal representation) -> this string will not contain commas.\n      Then, create a new string where every comma is replaced by space? But there are no commas, so we get the same string.\n      Then output that string and a newline.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        char *s = string_representation_of_B;\n        for (int i=0; s[i]; i++) {\n            if (s[i] == ',') s[i] = ' ';   // but we know it won't have commas, so we can skip?\n        }\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", s);\n\n  But note: the third program does not add commas. It only replaces existing commas. So we don't need to worry about formatting the integer with commas.\n\n  Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", B);\n\n  because the integer B is an integer and we know the original second program outputs the integer without commas.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The third program is there. We must simulate it? But the problem says to chain the entire sequence. So we should simulate the third program even if it does nothing? Actually, the third program is designed to replace commas, but the input to it (the string from the second program) does not contain commas. So we can skip it? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\".\n\n  Considering the requirement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\", we must include the logic of the third program. So we have to:\n\n      Step 4.1: Convert B to a string (without any commas, just the digits).\n      Step 4.2: Traverse the string and replace every comma by space? But there are none. Then output the string and a newline.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        char buffer[50]; // enough for an integer\n        sprintf(buffer, \"%d\", B);\n        for (char *p = buffer; *p; p++) {\n            if (*p == ',') *p = ' ';   // but note: the integer string doesn't have commas, so this does nothing.\n        }\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n  But wait: the original third program replaces commas. However, the integer string we get from the second program does not have commas. So the for-loop does nothing. So we can skip the for-loop? But to be faithful, we do it.\n\n  However, note: the third program in the original code replaces every comma in the entire string. It does not assume anything. So we do the same.\n\n  But note: the third program in the original code reads the entire line. What if the second program outputs more than one line? It doesn't: the second program outputs exactly one integer and then a newline.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Now, we must translate each program to C, and chain the outputs.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      // Step 1: Read the first input (for the first program)\n      int N;\n      scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n      int *arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n      for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n      }\n\n      // Step 2: Compute the first program's result (A)\n      int A = 0;\n      // We'll use a min-heap? Actually, the first program uses a PriorityQueue (min-heap) and then:\n      //   for each element in arr:\n      //        add to the heap\n      //        if the current element is <= the top of the heap (which is the min so far) then A++.\n      // But note: the heap contains all the elements so far. The top is the minimum of the entire array so far.\n      // So the condition is: if the current element is the minimum so far, then count it.\n\n      // Actually, we can do without a heap? We can just keep the minimum so far? \n      // Because: when we add the current element, the heap's top is the minimum of the entire set so far. \n      // So the condition \"arr[i] <= q.peek()\" is equivalent to \"arr[i] is less than or equal to the current minimum\", \n      // but note: the heap contains all the previous elements and the current. So the top might be the current element? \n      // Actually, the heap is built by adding each element. So the top is the minimum of the entire set so far.\n\n      // However, we can simulate by keeping a running minimum.\n\n      // Let min_so_far = a big number.\n      // Then:\n      //   for i=0 to N-1:\n      //        if (arr[i] <= min_so_far) then A++ and min_so_far = arr[i];\n      // Why? Because if the current element is the smallest so far, then it satisfies the condition.\n\n      // But note: the heap method: we add the element and then compare the current element to the top. \n      // Since we just added the current element, the top could be the current element? \n      // Example: [4,2,5,1,3]:\n      //   i=0: heap=[4] -> top=4 -> 4<=4 -> true -> A=1.\n      //   i=1: heap=[2,4] -> top=2 -> 2<=2 -> true -> A=2.\n      //   i=2: heap=[2,4,5] -> top=2 -> 5<=2 -> false -> A=2.\n      //   i=3: heap=[1,2,4,5] -> top=1 -> 1<=1 -> true -> A=3.\n      //   i=4: heap=[1,2,3,4,5] -> top=1 -> 3<=1 -> false -> A=3.\n\n      // Now with the running minimum:\n      //   min_so_far = 1000000000 (big)\n      //   i0: 4 <= min_so_far (4<=big) -> true -> min_so_far=4 -> A=1.\n      //   i1: 2 <= 4 -> true -> min_so_far=2 -> A=2.\n      //   i2: 5<=2 -> false -> A=2.\n      //   i3: 1<=2 -> true -> min_so_far=1 -> A=3.\n      //   i4: 3<=1 -> false -> A=3.\n\n      // So it's the same.\n\n      // Therefore, we can avoid the heap and do:\n\n          int min_so_far = 1000000000;\n          int A = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n              if (arr[i] <= min_so_far) {\n                  A++;\n                  min_so_far = arr[i];\n              }\n          }\n\n      This is simpler and more efficient.\n\n      So Step 2: compute A as above.\n\n      // Step 3: Run the second program with input A (which is the integer that we computed).\n\n      The second program (ABC114_C) does:\n\n          long i = 357;\n          int c = 0;\n          while (i <= N) {   // note: the second program uses the variable N for the input (which is our A)\n              String s = String.valueOf(i);\n              if (s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\")) \n                  c++;\n              // then generate the next number: \n              // It does: \n              //   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n              //   boolean f = false;\n              //   for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n              //        char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1-j);\n              //        if (f) {\n              //            sb.append(a);\n              //        } else {\n              //            if (a == '3') {\n              //                sb.append('5');\n              //                f = true;\n              //            } else if (a == '5') {\n              //                sb.append('7');\n              //                f = true;\n              //            } else { // a=='7'\n              //                sb.append('3');\n              //            }\n              //        }\n              //   }\n              //   if (!f) sb.append(3);\n              //   Then reverse the string and parse to long.\n\n          }\n\n      How does the generation work?\n        It's like incrementing in base 3 with digits 3,5,7. But the algorithm:\n\n          Example: starting at 357.\n\n          Step: \n            We process the number from rightmost digit to leftmost.\n            We have a flag f (initially false) meaning we haven't done a carry that requires changing the digit without propagating.\n\n            For each digit (from right to left):\n                if we have already done a carry (f is true), then we just append the same digit (from the original number? but note we are going backwards) -> actually, we are building the new number backwards.\n\n            If not done a carry:\n                if the digit is '3', we change it to '5' and mark f=true (meaning we have done a change without needing to carry further to the left? but note: we are going from right to left, so we are doing a carry propagation?).\n\n                if the digit is '5', we change it to '7' and mark f=true.\n\n                if the digit is '7', we change it to '3' (and then we leave f=false, meaning we have to carry to the next digit? because setting 7 to 3 is like a carry? and then we move left).\n\n            If at the end f is still false, we append a '3' at the end? Actually, note: we are building the string in reverse order? Because we are going from the last character to the first, and appending the new digit. Then we reverse the entire string.\n\n          Example: 357 -> \n            j=0: the last digit is '7' -> becomes '3', and f remains false -> so we append '3' to sb -> now sb=\"3\"\n            j=1: the next digit is '5' -> becomes '7' and f becomes true -> append '7' -> now sb=\"37\"\n            j=2: the next digit is '3' -> because f is true, we just append the same digit -> append '3' -> now sb=\"373\"\n            Then we reverse: \"373\" becomes \"373\", and then we haven't appended at the end? but note: the condition at the end: if (!f) then append 3? but f is true at the end, so we don't. Then i = 373.\n\n          But wait: the example in the original code: \n            The next number after 357 is 373? \n\n          Actually, the next number that is composed of 3,5,7 and in increasing order? But the algorithm is generating the next candidate by incrementing the least significant digit and propagating.\n\n          However, the condition for counting is that the number must contain at least one 3, one 5, and one 7. So 373 has two 3's and one 7, but no 5 -> so it won't be counted.\n\n          We don't need to understand the generation, we just need to translate it.\n\n      We'll translate the second program to C:\n\n          long i = 357;\n          int c = 0;\n          long N_val = A;   // because the second program's input is the integer A from the first program.\n\n          while (i <= N_val) {\n              // Convert i to a string representation (in base 10)\n              // Check if the string contains '3', '5', and '7'\n              // Then generate the next number.\n\n          }\n\n      Steps for the second program:\n\n          We need to convert a long to a string. We can use sprintf for that, but note: the number can be large? The input A is at most the output of the first program. The first program's input N is up to 200000? Then the numbers in the array are up to 200000? Then A is at most 200000? So the second program will run with N_val up to 200000? Then i starts at 357 and the next numbers are 373, 375, 377, 533, ...? Actually, the numbers generated are increasing. The condition i<=N_val, and N_val is 200000, so we are generating numbers up to 200000. The largest number we generate is 77777 (which is 5 digits) and 77777 > 200000? Actually, 77777 is about 78000, so it's less than 200000. So we are safe.\n\n      How to check if the string contains '3','5','7'? We can do:\n\n          char *s = string_of_i;\n          int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n          for (int j=0; s[j]; j++) {\n              if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n              else if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n              else if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n          }\n          if (has3 && has5 && has7) c++;\n\n      Then generate the next candidate:\n\n          We'll build a new string for the next number. We traverse the original string from right to left.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            int len = strlen(s);\n            char *sb = (char*)malloc(len+2); // we might add one digit at the end, and then the null terminator.\n            int index = 0;   // index in sb (we are building backwards, then we reverse)\n            int f = 0;       // false\n\n            for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                if (f) {\n                    // just copy the digit\n                    sb[index++] = s[j];\n                } else {\n                    if (s[j]=='3') {\n                        sb[index++] = '5';\n                        f = 1;\n                    } else if (s[j]=='5') {\n                        sb[index++] = '7';\n                        f = 1;\n                    } else if (s[j]=='7') {\n                        sb[index++] = '3';\n                        // f remains 0\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (!f) {\n                // we have to add a digit at the end? But note: we are building backwards, so we are at the most significant end? \n                // Actually, we are building the new number from right to left? But we are going from the last digit (least significant) to the first (most significant). \n                // After the loop, if f is still 0, then we need to add a '3' at the most significant end? But note: we are building the new number in reverse order (the first character we put in sb is the next digit of the least significant? but wait: we are going from the last digit to the first, and we are appending the new digit to sb. Then we will reverse the entire sb to get the new number.\n\n                // Example: 777 -> becomes 777: \n                //   j0 (last digit): '7' -> becomes '3', f=0 -> sb[0]='3'\n                //   j1: '7' -> becomes '3', f=0 -> sb[1]='3'\n                //   j2: '7' -> becomes '3', f=0 -> sb[2]='3'\n                //   then we break. Then we have f=0, so we append '3' -> then sb becomes \"333\" -> then we reverse? no, the algorithm in Java appends then reverses? Actually, the Java code:\n\n                //      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                //      ... in the loop: for each j (from 0 to s.length()-1) we look at s.charAt(s.length()-1-j) -> so j=0 is the last char, j=1 is the second last, etc.\n                //      then we do: sb.append(...) -> so we are appending the new digit in the order from least significant to most significant? \n                //      Then after the loop, we do: if (!f) sb.append(3) -> which appends at the end (which would be the most significant? but wait: we are building the number in reverse order: the first digit we append is the least significant, then the next is the next more significant, and so on. Then the last digit we append is the most significant? But then we reverse the entire string.\n\n                //      Example: we have built the string as \"333\", then we append '3' -> becomes \"3333\", then reverse -> \"3333\" becomes \"3333\". Then the number is 3333.\n\n                //      But the next number after 777 should be 3333? \n\n                //      Actually, the algorithm: \n                //        777 -> change every digit to 3 (and we haven't set f, so we do a carry over the entire number and then add a 3 at the end? which becomes 3333.\n\n                //      So we do:\n\n                    sb[index++] = '3';   // this is the extra digit at the end.\n\n            }\n\n            Then we have to reverse the string in sb? \n\n            Actually, the Java code does: \n                StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \n                i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\n            So we reverse the string we built.\n\n          Then convert the reversed string to a long.\n\n      We must be cautious: the string we built is not null-terminated? We have to null-terminate it.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          sb[index] = '\\0';\n          // Now reverse the string sb to get the new number string?\n          // But note: we built the string by appending the digits from the least significant (first) to the most significant (last) in the order of processing (which was from the least significant digit to the most significant digit of the original number). Then we added an extra digit at the end (if needed) which becomes the new most significant? Then we reverse the entire string to get the correct order.\n\n          Example: for 357: \n             Original: \"357\"\n             We process: \n                 j0: last digit '7' -> becomes '3' -> so we append '3' -> then j1: '5' -> becomes '7' -> append '7' -> then j2: '3' -> because we set f=true at the second digit, we just append the original digit? Actually, we don't have the original digit? We have the original digit for the current position? Actually, we are at j2: the digit is '3'. We are not in the f state (because we set f=true at the second digit, but we are now at the third digit independently? Actually, the state f is global for the entire number. \n\n          But wait: the Java code: the flag f is set to false at the start. Then we process the digits one by one. Once we set f to true in one digit, then for the rest of the digits we just copy (without changing). \n\n          How we built the string for 357:\n\n             j0: digit='7' -> becomes '3', and f remains false -> so we append '3'\n             j1: digit='5' -> becomes '7', and set f=true -> append '7'\n             j2: now f is true -> so we just append the digit '3' (from the original number at that position) -> append '3'\n             Then we have the string \"373\" (without the extra digit because f became true). Then we reverse \"373\" -> \"373\", and then i=373.\n\n          So we have to reverse the string we built? \n\n          Actually, the Java code reverses the entire string. So we must do the same.\n\n          Therefore, we reverse the string in sb (which we built as described) and then convert to long.\n\n      Steps for generating the next number:\n\n          // Convert i to a string: we have a string s (which is the decimal representation of i).\n          // Then:\n          int len = strlen(s);\n          char *temp = (char*)malloc(len+2); // to hold the new string (might have one extra digit)\n          int idx = 0;\n          int f = 0;\n          // Traverse the original string from last character to the first.\n          for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n              if (f) {\n                  temp[idx++] = s[j];\n              } else {\n                  if (s[j]=='3') {\n                      temp[idx++] = '5';\n                      f = 1;\n                  } else if (s[j]=='5') {\n                      temp[idx++] = '7';\n                      f = 1;\n                  } else if (s[j]=='7') {\n                      temp[idx++] = '3';\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          if (!f) {\n              temp[idx++] = '3';\n          }\n          temp[idx] = '\\0';\n          // Now reverse the entire string temp? \n          // But note: we built the string by processing from the last digit to the first, so the first character we put in temp is for the last digit of the new number? Actually, we want the first character in the new number to be the first digit? \n\n          // How did we build? \n          //   For 357: \n          //      We started with j=2 (the last digit) -> '7' -> we put '3' at temp[0]\n          //      j=1: '5' -> we put '7' at temp[1]\n          //      j=0: '3' -> we put '3' at temp[2] -> then temp = \"373\", which is the number 373? \n          //   But 373 is the next number? \n\n          //   Actually, we want the next number to be 373? \n          //   But 373 is already the number we want? \n\n          //   However, the Java code then reverses the string? \n          //      StringBuilder sb = ... we built by appending: \n          //          for j=0: we took the last digit -> we appended the new digit for the last digit? Then the next digit we appended is for the next more significant? \n          //          Then the string we built is in the order: [digit0, digit1, digit2] for the positions: units, tens, hundreds? \n          //      Then we reverse: so we get hundreds, tens, units? \n\n          //   Example: we built \"3\" (for the units) then \"7\" (for the tens) then \"3\" (for the hundreds) -> so the string is \"373\", then we reverse to \"373\". \n\n          //   But that is the same? \n\n          //   Actually, if we built the string in the order of increasing significance (hundreds, tens, units) then we don't need to reverse? But we built the units first, then tens, then hundreds. Then the string is \"373\" meaning: units=3, tens=7, hundreds=3? That would be 3*100 + 7*10 + 3 = 373? \n\n          //   But the string \"373\" is the same as the number 373? \n\n          //   However, when we reverse the string \"373\", we get \"373\" -> same. \n\n          //   But what about a number that becomes longer? \n          //   Example: 777 -> we build: \n          //        j0: 7->3 -> temp[0]='3'\n          //        j1: 7->3 -> temp[1]='3'\n          //        j2: 7->3 -> temp[2]='3'\n          //        then we add an extra '3' -> temp[3]='3', then temp[4]='\\0' -> string \"3333\", then reverse -> \"3333\", which is 3333? \n\n          //   But we want the next number to be 3333? \n\n          //   So we don't need to reverse? Actually, the Java code reverses the string. But in this case, the string we built is already in the reverse order of the original? \n\n          //   The original number is 777: \n          //        Original digits: [7 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 7 (units)]\n          //        We processed: units -> then tens -> then hundreds.\n          //        We built: \n          //            units: 3 -> then tens: 3 -> then hundreds: 3 -> then we added an extra digit (thousands:3) -> so the string we built is \"3333\", which is units, tens, hundreds, thousands? \n          //        Then we reverse: becomes \"3333\" -> which is thousands, hundreds, tens, units? \n\n          //   But that is the same as the number 3333? \n\n          //   Actually, the string \"3333\" is the same as the number 3333. \n\n          //   Therefore, we can avoid the reverse? But the Java code does reverse. \n\n          //   Why? Because the way we built the string: we started from the last digit (least significant) and built the string in the order of increasing significance? Then when we reverse we get the most significant first? \n\n          //   Example: 357: \n          //        Original: \"357\" -> we process the last digit (7) first -> we put the new digit for the units: 3 -> then the tens: 7 -> then the hundreds: 3 -> so the string is \"373\", and then we reverse to get \"373\", which is the correct representation.\n\n          //   So the string we built is the reverse of the desired representation? \n\n          //   Therefore, we must reverse the string we built.\n\n          So:\n\n            for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                char t = temp[j];\n                temp[j] = temp[idx-1-j];\n                temp[idx-1-j] = t;\n            }\n\n          Then convert the string temp to a long: i = atol(temp);\n\n      Then set i to that value and continue the loop.\n\n      Step 4: After the second program, we have the integer c (which we call B).\n\n      Step 5: Then we do the third program: \n          We have to convert B to a string and then replace commas by spaces. But there are no commas, so we just output the string and a newline.\n\n          We do:\n\n            char output[50];\n            sprintf(output, \"%d\", B);\n            for (int i=0; output[i]; i++) {\n                if (output[i] == ',') \n                    output[i] = ' ';\n            }\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", output);\n\n  However, the third program in the original code does not output the integer, it outputs the string that it read (which is the output of the second program) and that string was without commas. So we can simply do:\n\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", B);\n\n  But to be faithful, we do the replacement.\n\n  But note: the third program does not know that the input is an integer. It just reads a string. So we must simulate reading a string? Actually, we are passing the integer B as the input to the third program. The third program expects a string. We are generating that string by converting B to a string. Then we replace commas by spaces. Since there are no commas, we can skip? But the problem says to include the entire sequence.\n\n  We'll do the replacement.\n\n  Summary of the entire C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int main() {\n          // Step 1: Read input for the first program\n          int N;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n          int *arr = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n          for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n              scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n          }\n\n          // Step 2: Compute A (the result of the first program) by the simpler method (without heap)\n          int min_so_far = 1000000000;\n          int A = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n              if (arr[i] <= min_so_far) {\n                  A++;\n                  min_so_far = arr[i];\n              }\n          }\n          free(arr);\n\n          // Step 3: Run the second program with input A (which we call N_val for the second program)\n          long i_val = 357;\n          int c = 0;\n          long N_val = A;   // the input to the second program\n\n          // If N_val is less than 357, then we skip the loop? \n          while (i_val <= N_val) {\n              // Convert i_val to a string\n              char s[20]; // 20 digits enough for long (which is up to 20 digits? but our N_val is at most 200000, so i_val is at most 200000, so 6 digits)\n              sprintf(s, \"%ld\", i_val);\n\n              // Check if the string contains '3','5','7'\n              int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0;\n              for (int j=0; s[j]; j++) {\n                  if (s[j]=='3') has3=1;\n                  else if (s[j]=='5') has5=1;\n                  else if (s[j]=='7') has7=1;\n              }\n              if (has3 && has5 && has7) {\n                  c++;\n              }\n\n              // Generate next number\n              int len = strlen(s);\n              char *temp = (char*)malloc(len+2); // extra for possible one more digit and null\n              int idx = 0;\n              int f = 0; // flag for carry propagation\n\n              // Traverse the string from last char to first\n              for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n                  if (f) {\n                      temp[idx++] = s[j];\n                  } else {\n                      if (s[j]=='3') {\n                          temp[idx++] = '5';\n                          f = 1;\n                      } else if (s[j]=='5') {\n                          temp[idx++] = '7';\n                          f = 1;\n                      } else if (s[j]=='7') {\n                          temp[idx++] = '3';\n                          // f remains 0\n                      } else {\n                          // This should not happen because the number is composed only of 3,5,7?\n                          // But the algorithm only generates numbers with 3,5,7? so we skip?\n                          // Actually, the starting number is 357, and the generation only produces 3,5,7.\n                          // So we don't expect other digits.\n                          temp[idx++] = s[j];\n                      }\n                  }\n              }\n              if (!f) {\n                  temp[idx++] = '3';\n              }\n              temp[idx] = '\\0';\n\n              // Reverse the temp string\n              for (int j=0; j<idx/2; j++) {\n                  char t = temp[j];\n                  temp[j] = temp[idx-1-j];\n                  temp[idx-1-j] = t;\n              }\n\n              // Convert temp to long\n              i_val = atol(temp);\n              free(temp);\n          }\n\n          // Now c is the result of the second program (which we call B)\n\n          // Step 4: Run the third program: take the integer c (B) and output it as a string, replacing commas by spaces (but there are none) and then a newline.\n          char output[50];\n          sprintf(output, \"%d\", c);\n          for (int i=0; output[i]; i++) {\n              if (output[i] == ',') {\n                  output[i] = ' ';\n              }\n          }\n          printf(\"%s\\n\", output);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  Note: the second program uses long. In C, long may be 32 bits on some systems? But the numbers we are generating are up to 200000, so it's safe.\n\n  However, to be safe for larger numbers? The problem states the first program's input N is up to 200000, so A is at most 200000. Then the numbers generated in the second program are at most 200000? Actually, the while loop condition is i_val<=N_val, and N_val=A<=200000. So the maximum number we generate is 200000. So we are safe.\n\n  But note: the second program's generation might produce a number that is larger than 200000? Yes, but then we break the loop. So it's safe.\n\n  Let me test with a small example: \n      Input for the first program: \n          5\n          4 2 5 1 3   -> A=3.\n\n      Then the second program: \n          i_val=357 -> 357<=3? false -> so the loop doesn't run -> c=0.\n          Then output 0.\n\n  But wait: 357>3, so we break immediately -> c=0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \n          5\n          4 2 5 1 100000   -> then A=4 (because the last element 100000 is not <= the min_so_far (which becomes 1) -> so A=4).\n\n      Then the second program: \n          i_val=357 -> 357<=4? false -> c=0.\n\n  Another example: \n      Input: \n          1\n          1000000   -> then min_so_far=1000000 -> A=1.\n      Then the second program: i_val=357>1 -> c=0.\n\n  How to get a positive count? \n      The first program must output at least 357? \n\n      Example: \n          Input for the first program: \n              10\n              1000000 1000000 ... (all big) -> then A=10 (because the first element is the min so far, then the next is not, then ... but actually the first element is 1000000, then the next is 1000000 (which is not less than the min_so_far) -> so A=1? \n          Actually: \n              min_so_far = 1000000\n              i0: 1000000 -> A=1, min_so_far=1000000\n              i1: 1000000 <= 1000000 -> true -> A=2\n              ... so if we have 10 elements all 1000000, then A=10.\n\n      Then the second program: \n          N_val=10 -> then i_val=357 -> 357>10 -> so c=0.\n\n      How to get a positive c? \n          The first program must output at least 357.\n\n      Example: \n          Input: \n              1\n              357   -> then A=1 -> then the second program: i_val=357>1 -> false -> c=0.\n\n          But if we have a large N and the first program outputs a large A? \n\n          Example: \n              N=1000, and the array is decreasing: \n                  1000, 999, 998, ... 1 -> then A=1000.\n\n          Then the second program: \n              i_val=357 -> <=1000 -> c becomes 1 (because \"357\" has 3,5,7) -> then generate next number: 373 -> then check: 373: has 3 and 7, but no 5 -> skip. Then next: 375 -> has 3,7,5 -> c=2 -> then 377 -> skip -> then 533 -> has 5,3,3 -> no 7? -> skip -> ... until we get to 777? then next is 3333 (which is 3333>1000? then break) -> so c=2.\n\n          Then the output is 2.\n\n      Therefore, the program should work.\n\n  But note: the second program's generation of the next number: \n      We must be cautious: the generation algorithm might skip numbers? But we are following the original Java.\n\n  One more note: the Java program for the second program originally read the input from stdin. Now we set N_val = A (the output of the first program). So we are not reading from stdin in the second program.\n\n  We are not doing any I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n  We must free the allocated memory.\n\n  Let me write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n  We'll assume that the input integers are nonnegative.\n\n  Note: the second program uses long for i. We'll use long in C.\n\n  We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: the second program's generation of the next number: we must handle the conversion from the string to long. We use atol? But atol expects a string of digits. We built the string with only digits.\n\n  However, note: the generation algorithm only produces digits '3','5','7' and we might add a '3'. So it's safe.\n\n  We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the second program might run for a long time if A is very large? But note: the numbers generated are increasing and they have a specific pattern. The total numbers of 3,5,7 numbers up to 200000 is not too many. The generation: the numbers are in increasing order and each step we generate the next candidate. The total numbers that are composed of 3,5,7 and contain each at least once is at most 3^d - 3*2^d + 3*1^d for d digits? and d is at most 6 (since 10^6 is 1000000, which is more than 200000). The total numbers with d=1,2,3,4,5,6 is about 3^6=729, so the total numbers we consider is 729? Then the loop runs at most 729 times? So it's acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program as described.\n\n  Let's code.\n\n  Note: the second program in Java does not consider numbers with digits other than 3,5,7? Actually, it generates numbers that are composed of 3,5,7. But it does not skip numbers that have a digit not in {3,5,7}? Actually, the generation algorithm only produces 3,5,7. So the string s is always composed of these digits. Therefore, the else branch (for other digits) in the generation loop is not needed. But we put it for safety? Actually, we know the digits are only 3,5,7. So we can remove the else branch? But we'll leave it as a copy in case of an error? Actually, the original Java code assumed that the digit is either 3,5,7. So we do the same.\n\n  We'll assume that the digit is one of 3,5,7. So we don't need the else branch? But we put the else branch to copy the digit if it's not 3,5,7? Actually, the original Java code did not handle other digits? It only had cases for 3,5,7. And the number is composed of 3,5,7. So we can remove the else branch? Actually, the original code would break if there is another digit? But there won't be.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n        for (int j = len-1; j>=0; j--) {\n            if (f) {\n                temp[idx++] = s[j];\n            } else {\n                if (s[j]=='3') {\n                    temp[idx++] = '5';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else if (s[j]=='5') {\n                    temp[idx++] = '7';\n                    f = 1;\n                } else if (s[j]=='7') {\n                    temp[idx++] = '3';\n                }\n                // else: we don't do anything? But the Java code didn't have an else? Actually, the Java code had an else for the case when the digit is not 3,5,7? No, the Java code only had 3,5,7. So we don't need to handle others.\n\n                // But what if the digit is not 3,5,7? It should not happen. So we can skip? Or we should copy? \n                // The Java code did not have an else for other digits. So if we encounter a digit not in 3,5,7, we do nothing? Then we skip appending? That would be an error.\n\n                // Actually, the generation algorithm only produces 3,5,7. So we assume that.\n\n        }\n\n  But to be safe, we can add an else that copies the digit and sets f=0? But that might break the generation. Instead, we can copy the digit and leave f=0? That would be:\n\n                else {\n                    temp[idx++] = s[j];\n                }\n\n  But the original Java code did not have that. It would throw an exception? Or not? The original Java code did not consider other digits. So we assume that the string s is composed only of '3','5','7'. \n\n  We'll assume that.\n\n  Now, the entire program:\n\n      We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the second program might start with 357 and then generate 373, 375, 377, 533, 535, 537, 553, 555, 557, 573, 575, 577, 733, 735, 737, 753, 755, 757, 773, 775, 777, then 3333, etc. \n\n  But the condition: we only count if the number contains at least one 3, one 5, and one 7. So 333 is not counted.\n\n  We are now ready to code.\n\n  Let me write the entire C program."
