But note: the second program output is an integer and the third program outputs a string. But in the chain, the third program's output is the final output. But the problem says: the entire sequence must behave identically. How the original chain would run:\n\n   Example input for first program: \n        2\n        10 15\n\n   Step1: computes the GCD of 10 and 15 -> 5? Actually, let me run the first program:\n\n        n=2, list = [10,15]\n        sort: [10,15]\n        Then call func:\n            min=0, then set min=10 (first element). Then for the next element 15: set 15 % 10 = 5. Then the list becomes [10,5] -> then sort: [5,10]\n        Then in the next iteration (while true) we call func again on [5,10]:\n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 % 5 = 0 -> remove 0? Then the list becomes [5] -> then in the next iteration of the while loop, we break and output 5. So step1 outputs 5. Step2: input is 5 -> then output 1 (because 5 != 1 -> so output 1). Step3: input is the string \"1\". Then it counts: \n        uppercase: 0, lowercase: 0 -> so it outputs \"1\" (in lowercase, which is \"1\"). So the entire chain outputs \"1\". But if step1 outputs 1, then step2 outputs 0, then step3 outputs \"0\". Therefore, the final output is either \"0\" or \"1\". However, note the first program has an exit condition when n==1: it outputs the single integer. Also when the list becomes all zeros. But note: the first program might output 0? Then step2: input 0 -> output 1. Then step3: output \"1\". Also, if the first program outputs 1, then step2: output 0 -> step3: output \"0\". So the entire chain: the output is the string \"0\" if the result of the first program is 1, otherwise the string \"1\". However, we must note: the first program might output 0? Then step2 outputs 1 -> step3 outputs \"1\". But the first program outputs 0 only when all numbers are zero? Then step2 outputs 1 -> step3 outputs \"1\". How to structure the C program:\n\n   We are to avoid I/O in the middle. So:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program. int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n        if (n == 1) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            // then we have the result for step1 = x.\n        } else {\n            // read n integers into an array\n        }\n\n   Then we run the first program's logic to compute the integer result (call it res1). Step 2: \n        int res2;\n        if (res1 == 1) {\n            res2 = 0;\n        } else {\n            res2 = 1;\n        }\n\n   Step 3: \n        Now we have res2 (which is either 0 or 1). We need to pass this as a string to the third program? But the third program expects a string.",

So we must simulate: If n==1, then we read the one integer and that becomes the result (res1). Then we break out of the first program and proceed to step2. If the list is all zeros (after sorting, the last element is 0) then we set res1=0 and break. Then we have the while loop that repeatedly calls func until the list has one element. But inside func, if we ever get a 1, we immediately set res1=1 and break out of the entire first program? Actually, the original program does:\n\n                  if (a.get(i) == 1) {\n                      System.out.println(1);\n                      System.exit(0);\n                  } So we must do the same: if at any point during the processing we get a 1, we set res1=1 and break out of the processing and then proceed to step2?

Yes. However, the condition in the beginning: if the last element is 0 -> then output 0. We do: if (a[n-1]==0). So we are sorting in ascending order? Then the last element is the maximum. So we are safe. But note: the initial sort: we sort the entire array of n integers. Then we check a[n-1] (the last element) for zero. Then in the while loop, we sort the current list (size) at the end of each func. We assume the array can be up to 100000 elements.",

But in the first call, we didn't set any to zero? Then we copy both? But note: we don't copy the 10? Actually, we do: because min was 0 so we set min=10 and then copy 10. Then 15: mod=5 -> non-zero -> we copy. So we have [10,5]. Then we sort. Then second call: \n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 % 5 = 0 -> skip. Then new array becomes [5]. Then we break out of the while loop because next time we have size=1. This is the same. But if we have [5,10] in the second call: \n        min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 %5 =0 -> we skip. Then we are left with [5]. So our simulation is the same. However, the original program might leave zeros in the list? For example, if we have [10, 15, 20]? First call: \n            min=0 -> set min=10. Then 15%10=5 -> non-zero -> copy. Then 20%10=0 -> skip. Then we have [10,5]. Then sort: [5,10]. Then second call: \n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10%5=0 -> skip. Then we have [5]. Then break. Our simulation: same. But what if we have [10, 0, 15]? The original program: \n            The list is sorted: [0,10,15]\n            Then in func:\n                i=0: element=0 -> remove -> now list becomes [10,15] and i becomes 0? (because we did i-- after removal). Then we process i=0: 10 -> min=0 so set min=10. Then i=1: 15 -> mod 10=5 -> set the element to 5 -> then check if 5==1? no. Then the list becomes [10,5]? Then sort: [5,10]. Our simulation: \n            We start with the list [0,10,15] (size=3). We iterate:\n                i=0: element=0 -> skip (so we don't copy to new array). i=1: element=10 -> min=0 -> set min=10, and copy to new array: new_array[0]=10, new_size=1. i=2: element=15 -> min!=0 -> mod=15%10=5 -> non-zero -> then we check: if 5==1? no -> then copy to new array: new_array[1]=5, new_size=2. Then we set the list to [10,5] and sort to [5,10]. Same. Therefore, our simulation of the func is equivalent.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into one C program.\n The idea is to chain the output of one program as the input to the next.\n\n However, note that the original programs are independent and meant to be run in sequence with the output of one as the input to the next.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC118_C) reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers. It then processes the list of integers to compute an answer (which is the GCD of all the numbers, but note the algorithm is a bit different: it repeatedly reduces the numbers by the smallest non-zero and removes zeros). It outputs a single integer.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC178_A) reads an integer `x` and then outputs 1 if x is 0, and 0 if x is 1. Actually, let's see: \n      boolean bool = x == 1 ? true : false;\n      int result = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n    So if x is 1, then bool becomes true, then result = 0.\n    If x is not 1 (so 0 or any other number) then bool becomes false, then result = 1.\n    However, note that the first program outputs a positive integer (or zero) and the second program expects an integer. But the second program only checks for 1: if the input is 1, output 0; otherwise output 1.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_59_A) reads a string and then counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. Then it outputs:\n        if uppercase > lowercase: the word in uppercase\n        else: the word in lowercase (including when equal)\n\n But note: the second program outputs either 0 or 1. So the input to the third program will be either the string \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n However, the third program expects a word. Since the output of the second program is a single digit (either '0' or '1'), we have to note:\n\n   - The third program will read that digit as a string of length 1.\n   - Then it counts the case: \n        Since '0' and '1' are not letters (they are digits), both `uppercase` and `lowercase` will be 0.\n   - Then it will output the string in lowercase (because 0>0 is false, and 0>0 is false, so it goes to the else: word.toLowerCase()).\n\n But note: the string \"0\" or \"1\" has no letters, so toLowerCase() will leave it unchanged.\n\n However, let's check the Java code: \n    Character.isUpperCase('0') -> false\n    Character.isUpperCase('1') -> false\n\n So both counts are 0 -> then it prints the string in lowercase. But since the string is already in lowercase (digits are not affected by case conversion), the output will be the same as the input.\n\n But wait: the third program's output is the same as its input? Then the entire chain would be:\n\n   Step1: outputs an integer (say X)\n   Step2: outputs 0 if X==1, otherwise 1 -> so output is either 0 or 1 (as a string? but in the second program, we are printing an integer. Then the third program reads an integer? Actually, the third program reads a string. How do we chain?\n\n How we chain in C:\n\n   We are going to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O. So:\n\n   - The first program (step1) will read the input (from stdin) and produce an integer result (call it X).\n   - The second program (step2) will take X and produce an integer result Y (which is 0 if X==1, else 1). But note: the second program in Java outputs an integer to stdout. Then the third program reads a string from stdin? But we are not going to write to stdout in the middle.\n\n   Instead, we will:\n\n     Step 1: read the initial input (which is the input for the first program: first integer n, then n integers).\n\n     Step 2: run the logic of the first program to get an integer X.\n\n     Step 3: use X as input to the second program: then compute Y = (X==1) ? 0 : 1.\n\n     Step 4: use Y as input to the third program. But the third program expects a string. However, note that the third program in the chain would have read the output of the second program as a string. The second program outputs the integer as a string (via out.println(result)). So if Y is 0, the output is \"0\", if Y is 1, the output is \"1\".\n\n        So we have to convert Y to a string? Actually, the third program in our chain will receive a string of the integer.\n\n     Step 5: the third program then processes that string and outputs the string in either uppercase or lowercase. But as reasoned, since the string is composed of digits, the output will be the same as the input.\n\n     So the final output will be either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n However, wait: the third program outputs the same string? Then the entire chain output is the same as the output of the second program? But note: the second program output is an integer and the third program outputs a string. But in the chain, the third program's output is the final output.\n\n But the problem says: the entire sequence must behave identically.\n\n How the original chain would run:\n\n   Example input for first program: \n        2\n        10 15\n\n   Step1: computes the GCD of 10 and 15 -> 5? Actually, let me run the first program:\n\n        n=2, list = [10,15]\n        sort: [10,15]\n        Then call func:\n            min=0, then set min=10 (first element). Then for the next element 15: set 15 % 10 = 5. Then the list becomes [10,5] -> then sort: [5,10]\n        Then in the next iteration (while true) we call func again on [5,10]:\n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 % 5 = 0 -> remove 0? Then the list becomes [5] -> then in the next iteration of the while loop, we break and output 5.\n\n   So step1 outputs 5.\n\n   Step2: input is 5 -> then output 1 (because 5 != 1 -> so output 1).\n\n   Step3: input is the string \"1\". Then it counts: \n        uppercase: 0, lowercase: 0 -> so it outputs \"1\" (in lowercase, which is \"1\").\n\n   So the entire chain outputs \"1\".\n\n   But if step1 outputs 1, then step2 outputs 0, then step3 outputs \"0\".\n\n Therefore, the final output is either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n However, note the first program has an exit condition when n==1: it outputs the single integer. Also when the list becomes all zeros.\n\n But note: the first program might output 0? Then step2: input 0 -> output 1. Then step3: output \"1\".\n\n Also, if the first program outputs 1, then step2: output 0 -> step3: output \"0\".\n\n So the entire chain: the output is the string \"0\" if the result of the first program is 1, otherwise the string \"1\".\n\n However, we must note: the first program might output 0? Then step2 outputs 1 -> step3 outputs \"1\".\n\n But the first program outputs 0 only when all numbers are zero? Then step2 outputs 1 -> step3 outputs \"1\".\n\n How to structure the C program:\n\n   We are to avoid I/O in the middle. So:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n\n        int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n        if (n == 1) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            // then we have the result for step1 = x.\n        } else {\n            // read n integers into an array\n        }\n\n   Then we run the first program's logic to compute the integer result (call it res1).\n\n   Step 2: \n        int res2;\n        if (res1 == 1) {\n            res2 = 0;\n        } else {\n            res2 = 1;\n        }\n\n   Step 3: \n        Now we have res2 (which is either 0 or 1). We need to pass this as a string to the third program? But the third program expects a string. However, note that the third program's output is the same as its input because the string is digits. So we can simply output the integer res2 as a string? But wait, the third program does:\n\n            if (uppercase > lowercase) -> then convert the whole string to uppercase, else to lowercase.\n\n        But the string is either \"0\" or \"1\", which are digits. Converting to uppercase or lowercase leaves them unchanged.\n\n        So the final output is the same as the string representation of res2.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply output res2 as an integer? But the original third program outputs a string. However, the string is the same as the integer representation of res2.\n\n        But note: the third program in Java outputs the string exactly as the integer was printed? Actually, the second program printed the integer without any extra spaces, and the third program reads the entire next token (which is the integer as a string). Then the third program outputs the same string? So we can just output the integer as a string.\n\n        How to output: we can simply printf(\"%d\\n\", res2); but that would output the integer. However, the third program's output is the same as the integer converted to a string? So yes, we can output the integer.\n\n        However, note: the chain must output the same as the original chain. The original chain's final output is a string of one digit and then a newline? The third program uses System.out.println(word) which prints the string and then a newline.\n\n        So we must output the digit and then a newline.\n\n        But wait: the first program outputs an integer without any extra spaces? It uses System.out.println(ans). Similarly, the second program outputs the integer and then a newline (because of out.println(result)). Then the third program reads that with next() which reads a token (so it reads the digit without the newline). Then it outputs the string and then a newline.\n\n        So the final output of the chain is the string of the digit (which is the same as the digit) and a newline.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", res2);\n\n        However, note: what if the first program outputs a number that is not 1? Then step2 outputs 1. Then step3 outputs \"1\\n\". Similarly, if the first program outputs 1, step2 outputs 0, step3 outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But wait: the third program might have done more? Actually, the third program does:\n\n            if (uppercase > lowercase) -> convert the entire string to uppercase and print with newline.\n            else -> convert to lowercase and print with newline.\n\n        Since the string is a digit, converting to uppercase or lowercase doesn't change it. So the output is the same.\n\n        However, what if the second program outputs a multi-digit number? Actually, the second program only outputs 0 or 1. So we are safe.\n\n   But note: the second program in Java outputs the integer without any formatting. It could be more than one digit? The input to the second program is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a nonnegative integer. But the second program only cares: if it is 1 then output 0, otherwise 1. So even if the first program outputs 2, 3, ... the second program outputs 1. And 1 is a single digit.\n\n   However, what if the first program outputs 10? Then the second program outputs 1. Then the third program gets the string \"1\" (which is one character). So the third program will output \"1\\n\".\n\n   So the entire chain: the output is either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\".\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: compute res1 (the result of the first program)\n        Step 2: compute res2 = (res1 == 1) ? 0 : 1;\n        Step 3: output res2 as an integer with a newline.\n\n   But wait: the third program does not change the string? So we can skip simulating the third program? Because the output of the third program is the same as the output of the second program? But note: the third program outputs a string that is the same as the integer string of the second program's output? And we are going to output that integer string? So we can skip.\n\n   However, what if the first program outputs 0? Then step2: 0 != 1 -> output 1. Then step3: outputs \"1\". But if we skip the third program, we output 1. But the chain would output \"1\", so we are consistent.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the third program? But note the problem: we must reproduce the entire chain. The chain has three programs. The third program might have side effects? But in this case, it doesn't. However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is to output either \"0\" or \"1\" with a newline.\n\n   But wait: the third program might output in a different way? For example, if we had a letter, it would change the case. But we don't. So we are safe.\n\n   However, the problem requires to translate the entire sequence. So we must simulate the third program? But note: the third program's output is the same as the second program's output (as a string) because the string is digits. So we can just output the integer from step2? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output\". So we are allowed to output only at the end. And we are going to output the string that the third program would output? That string is the same as the integer from step2 converted to a string? So we can do:\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", res2);\n\n   However, the third program outputs the string exactly as the second program's output? The second program outputs the integer and then a newline. The third program then reads that entire line? Actually, the third program uses `in.next()` which reads the next token. The token would be the integer without the newline? But the second program outputs the integer and then a newline. Then the third program's `next()` method reads the token (the integer as a string) without the newline. Then the third program outputs that token (without the newline) and then appends a newline? Actually, it outputs the token (which is the integer string) and then a newline.\n\n   So the final output is the integer string and then a newline. Which is exactly what `printf(\"%d\\n\", res2)` does.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the third program's processing? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". We are going to simulate the entire chain without I/O in the middle. We are simulating the third program? Actually, we are not simulating the third program at all. We are relying on the fact that the third program's output is the same as the second program's output. But what if the third program had a different effect? \n\n   Let me reexamine the third program: \n\n        Input: a string (which is the output of the second program: either \"0\" or \"1\")\n        It counts uppercase and lowercase: \n            For \"0\": \n                each char: '0' -> not uppercase -> not lowercase? Actually, the Java method Character.isUpperCase('0') returns false, similarly for lowercase. So both counts are 0.\n            Then it outputs the string in lowercase? But the string is \"0\", and converting to lowercase leaves it as \"0\". Then it outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        Similarly for \"1\".\n\n   So the third program does nothing to the string. Therefore, we can skip it.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is: \n        Step1: outputs an integer (say X) with a newline.\n        Step2: reads that integer and outputs (if X==1 then 0 else 1) with a newline.\n        Step3: reads that integer as a string and then outputs the same string with a newline.\n\n   So the entire chain outputs either \"0\\n\" or \"1\\n\".\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Step1: compute X (the result of the first program)\n        Step2: compute Y = (X==1)?0:1;\n        Step3: output Y with a newline.\n\n   Therefore, the entire C program:\n\n        Read n and the list of integers for the first program.\n        Compute the result of the first program (X).\n        Compute Y = (X==1)?0:1;\n        Print Y and a newline.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the first program has several exit conditions:\n\n        Condition 1: if n==1, then it reads the one integer and immediately prints it and exits.\n        Condition 2: if after reading the list and sorting, the last element (max) is 0, then it prints 0 and exits.\n\n        In these cases, we must not run the rest of the first program's logic? Actually, we break out and use that value for the next steps.\n\n   So we must simulate the entire first program.\n\n   How to simulate the first program in C:\n\n        We note the first program uses an ArrayList and repeatedly calls `func` until the list has one element.\n\n        The `func` method:\n            - Removes zeros.\n            - Then, if it finds a non-zero, it sets that as `min` (if min is 0) and then for subsequent elements, it sets the element to element % min (if min is not zero). And if during this modulo operation, it gets 1, it prints 1 and exits the entire program.\n\n        We must simulate the same behavior: if at any point we get a 1, we can break and set the result to 1 and then exit the processing? But note: the program exits immediately.\n\n        However, in our chain, we are going to use the result of the first program and then pass it to the second. So if the first program would have printed 1 and exited, then we set res1=1 and then proceed to the second program? But note: the first program in the chain would have printed 1 and then the entire program would have terminated. The next programs wouldn't run? Actually, no: the chain runs the programs in sequence. The first program outputs 1 and terminates. Then the second program runs with input 1. Then the second program outputs 0. Then the third program runs with input \"0\" and outputs \"0\\n\".\n\n        But wait: the first program has two exit points: one in the condition (n==1) and when the list is all zeros, and also in the func if it gets a 1.\n\n        So we must simulate:\n\n            If n==1, then we read the one integer and that becomes the result (res1). Then we break out of the first program and proceed to step2.\n\n            If the list is all zeros (after sorting, the last element is 0) then we set res1=0 and break.\n\n            Then we have the while loop that repeatedly calls func until the list has one element. But inside func, if we ever get a 1, we immediately set res1=1 and break out of the entire first program? Actually, the original program does:\n\n                  if (a.get(i) == 1) {\n                      System.out.println(1);\n                      System.exit(0);\n                  }\n\n            So we must do the same: if at any point during the processing we get a 1, we set res1=1 and break out of the processing and then proceed to step2? But note: the program exits immediately, so the rest of the processing is skipped.\n\n        However, in the chain, the entire first program runs to completion and then the second runs. So we are simulating the entire chain in one process. Therefore, if we get a 1 during the func, we can set res1=1 and break out of the first program's processing and then move to the second.\n\n        But note: the original program exits the entire JVM. So we break out of the processing and then we continue to the second step? Yes, because we are in the same program and we are not actually exiting. We are just simulating.\n\n        So we must be cautious to break out of the loops and skip the rest of the first program's processing when we get a 1.\n\n   Steps for the first program in C:\n\n        int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n        int res1;\n        if (n == 1) {\n            int x;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n            res1 = x;\n        } else {\n            // Read n integers\n            int a[100000]; // we need to choose a size.

But we are going to remove zeros and then reduce the array.\n\n                // We'll create a list that we can modify. We can use an array and track the current size.\n                int list[100000]; // same as a\n                int size = n;\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    list[i] = a[i];\n                }\n\n                // We also note: the program might exit early if it finds a 1 during the modulo step.\n\n                int found_one = 0; // flag to indicate if we found a 1 and need to break\n\n                while (1) {\n                    if (size == 1) {\n                        res1 = list[0];\n                        break;\n                    }\n\n                    // Now we are going to simulate the func function.\n\n                    // First, remove zeros and also do the modulo step.\n                    // Step 1: sort the current list?

But we break in the while condition when size==1. \n                        // Actually, we break the while loop only when size==1. So we have to set the size to new_size and then check if size==1? But if new_size==0, then we break the while loop? The original program would have broken in the next iteration? Actually, the original program does:\n                        //   while (true) {\n                        //      if (a.size()==1) break;\n                        //      a = func(a);\n                        //   }\n                        // So if after func the list becomes empty? Then the next iteration: a.size()==0 -> then the condition a.size()==1 fails -> then we call func again? But the func on an empty list? Actually, the original func on an empty list would set min=0 and then skip everything -> then return an empty list? Then the while loop continues? That would be an infinite loop.\n\n                        // But note: we started with non-zero elements? and we removed zeros? Then we set min to the first non-zero and then modulo the others. Then if we get an empty list? Then we break the while loop? Actually, we break only when the list has one element. So we must avoid infinite loops.\n\n                        // However, the original program has a condition at the beginning: if the max is 0, then output 0 and exit. But after the first call to func, we might get an empty list? Then the next iteration: size==0 -> then the condition (size==1) fails -> then we call func again. Then in func: we skip all zeros (and we have an empty list) -> then we return an empty list? Then we sort the empty list? Then the next iteration: size==0 -> again fails. So infinite loop.\n\n                        // But the problem says the original program is from atcoder. Let me think: the input is positive integers? The modulo operation produces nonnegative integers. The only way we get zeros is when the modulo is zero. Then we remove them. Then we are left with non-zero? But if we have an empty list, then we break out of the while loop? Actually, the condition in the while loop is: if the list size is 1 -> break. But we have 0 -> then we break? No.\n\n                        // The original program does not break on empty list? So we must avoid that.\n\n                        // Instead, we break here: if new_size==0, then we set res1=0? Actually, the original program does not have this condition. But note: if the list becomes empty, then the next call to func returns an empty list, and then the while loop continues. So we must break when the list becomes empty? Actually, the problem says: the first program. It has an exit condition when the list becomes of size 1. But if we get an empty list, we break the while loop? Then we would use the previous res1? But we haven't set it.\n\n                        // We should break the while loop and set res1=0? Because if all numbers become zeros, then the answer is 0.\n\n                        // Actually, the original program had a condition at the beginning: if the max is 0. But during the process, we might remove all elements? Then the answer should be 0? But note: the algorithm is computing the GCD. The GCD of an empty set? Conventionally, we consider GCD of an empty set to be 0? But let me see: the GCD of an empty set is defined as 0? (because 0 is the identity for GCD: GCD(0,x)=x, but for an empty set, we want GCD() = 0).\n\n                        // However, the original program does not handle an empty list. It breaks only when the list has one element. So we must avoid an infinite loop.\n\n                        // How about: if new_size==0, then we set res1=0 and break the while loop.\n\n                        res1 = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n\n                    // If we didn't break and didn't find a 1, then we update the list and sort.\n                    size = new_size;\n                    // sort the list from index 0 to new_size-1\n                    qsort(list, size, sizeof(int), compare_ints);\n\n                    // Also, note: the original program checks after sorting if the last element is zero? Actually, we already removed zeros? So the last element is the maximum and it should be positive? But if we have an empty list, we handled above.\n\n                    // But note: the original program does not have the condition for zero in the while loop? It only had that condition at the beginning. So we don't check again.\n\n                } // end while\n\n                // If we broke because of found_one, then res1 is already 1.\n                // If we broke because of size==1, then res1 is set in the loop.\n                // If we broke because of new_size==0, then res1=0.\n            }\n        }\n\n   Then step2: \n        int res2;\n        if (res1 == 1) {\n            res2 = 0;\n        } else {\n            res2 = 1;\n        }\n\n   Then step3: \n        printf(\"%d\\n\", res2);\n\n   However, note: the first program has an exit condition in func when it finds a 1: it prints 1 and exits. So we set res1=1 and break out of the while loop. Then we do step2 and step3.\n\n   Also, the first program has an exit condition at the beginning for n==1 and for all zeros.\n\n   We must also note: the original program might have multiple passes through the while loop. Our simulation of func uses a flag for found_one and then breaks the while loop.\n\n   But note: the func method in the original program does:\n\n        for (int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {\n            if (a.get(i)==0) { remove and adjust index }\n            else {\n                if (min != 0) {\n                    int mod = a.get(i) % min;\n                    a.set(i, mod);\n                    if (mod==0) {\n                         // then we remove it? Actually, no: the next time we see zero we remove? But in the same pass? Actually, the zero is set and then we continue. Then we remove zeros in the same loop? Actually, no: the loop doesn't remove zeros that are set by the modulo operation until the next iteration? Actually, the modulo operation might set the element to zero, and then in the same loop we skip? No, because we are at the same element: we set the element to mod, and then if mod==0, then we remove it? Actually, the code:\n\n                         a.set(i, a.get(i) % min);\n                         if (a.get(i) == 1) ... -> then if it becomes 1, we break.\n                         // but if it becomes 0, then we don't remove it immediately? Then when we come to this element again? Actually, no: the element is set to 0, and then we move to the next. Then the next time we see a zero? We remove it? But the index is beyond this element? Actually, the code does:\n\n                         if (a.get(i)==0) { \n                             a.remove(i); \n                             i--; \n                         }\n\n                    So zeros are removed in the same loop. But note: we set the element to mod, and if mod==0, then we don't immediately remove? We leave it as zero? Then later when we come to the same element? Actually, we are at the same index? Then the next element we haven't processed? Then the zero will be removed in the next iteration of the loop? But we are at the same index? Actually, the code does:\n\n                         a.set(i, mod);   // sets the current element to mod (could be zero)\n                         if (mod==1) -> break\n                         // and then we don't remove it now? So the element becomes zero and remains in the list? Then we have to remove it later? Actually, the loop does not check the same element again for zero? Because we set it to zero and then move to the next? Then the zero will be there until the next time we sort and then in the next call to func? But note: the current func call doesn't remove that zero? Then at the end of the loop, we sort and return the list with zeros? Then the next call to func will remove the zeros? \n\n                    However, the original code has a condition at the top of the loop: if the element is zero, remove it. So if we set an element to zero, then in the same loop we will remove it? No, because we are at index i, we set it to zero, and then we move to the next index. Then the zero remains? Then when we do the next iteration? We don't revisit the same index? So the zero is left until the next call to func? \n\n                    But note: the original program does:\n\n                         for (int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {\n                             if (a.get(i)==0) {   // now we are at the element we just set to zero? not in the same iteration? \n                                 // we remove it and then do i-- so that the next element is not skipped.\n                             }\n                         }\n\n                    Actually, in the same iteration, we set the element to zero and then we don't check if it's zero? We move to the next index. So the zero remains until the next time we call func? \n\n                    But then the next time we call func, we remove zeros. \n\n                    However, we are simulating the entire func in one pass? We are removing zeros in the same pass? We are skipping zeros? In our simulation, we skip zeros by not copying them? So we are effectively removing them.\n\n                    How we do:\n\n                         We have a new array: we are copying the non-zero elements? So if we set an element to zero (by mod operation) we skip it? \n\n                    In our simulation:\n\n                         for each element in the current list:\n                             if element==0 -> skip (and we don't copy to the new array)\n                             else:\n                                 if min==0 -> set min and copy to new array.\n                                 else:\n                                     mod = element % min\n                                     if mod==0 -> skip (don't copy)\n                                     else:\n                                         if mod==1 -> set flag and break the for loop.\n                                         else -> copy mod to the new array.\n\n                    So we remove zeros and also remove elements that become zero by mod.\n\n                    This is equivalent.\n\n   However, note: the original program does the modulo operation in-place and then removes zeros in the same loop? Actually, no: the removal of zeros is only for the original zeros? And the zeros produced by modulo are not removed until the next call to func? \n\n   But then the original program might leave zeros in the list? Then when we sort, zeros are at the front? Then the next call to func will remove them. But our simulation removes them in the same call? \n\n   This is a difference? \n\n   Example: \n        List: [10, 15]\n        First call to func:\n            min=0 -> set min=10, and copy 10 to new array? Then next element: 15 -> mod 10 gives 5. 5 !=0 -> so we copy 5. Then new array is [10,5]. Then we sort: [5,10]. Then the next call to func.\n\n        In our simulation: we do the modulo and we remove zeros? But in the first call, we didn't set any to zero? Then we copy both? But note: we don't copy the 10? Actually, we do: because min was 0 so we set min=10 and then copy 10. Then 15: mod=5 -> non-zero -> we copy. So we have [10,5]. Then we sort.\n\n        Then second call: \n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 % 5 = 0 -> skip. Then new array becomes [5]. Then we break out of the while loop because next time we have size=1.\n\n        This is the same.\n\n   But if we have [5,10] in the second call: \n        min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10 %5 =0 -> we skip. Then we are left with [5]. \n\n   So our simulation is the same.\n\n   However, the original program might leave zeros in the list? For example, if we have [10, 15, 20]? \n        First call: \n            min=0 -> set min=10. Then 15%10=5 -> non-zero -> copy. Then 20%10=0 -> skip. Then we have [10,5]. Then sort: [5,10].\n        Then second call: \n            min=0 -> set min=5. Then 10%5=0 -> skip. Then we have [5]. Then break.\n\n        Our simulation: same.\n\n   But what if we have [10, 0, 15]? \n        The original program: \n            The list is sorted: [0,10,15]\n            Then in func:\n                i=0: element=0 -> remove -> now list becomes [10,15] and i becomes 0? (because we did i-- after removal). Then we process i=0: 10 -> min=0 so set min=10. Then i=1: 15 -> mod 10=5 -> set the element to 5 -> then check if 5==1? no. Then the list becomes [10,5]? Then sort: [5,10].\n\n        Our simulation: \n            We start with the list [0,10,15] (size=3). \n            We iterate:\n                i=0: element=0 -> skip (so we don't copy to new array). \n                i=1: element=10 -> min=0 -> set min=10, and copy to new array: new_array[0]=10, new_size=1.\n                i=2: element=15 -> min!=0 -> mod=15%10=5 -> non-zero -> then we check: if 5==1? no -> then copy to new array: new_array[1]=5, new_size=2.\n            Then we set the list to [10,5] and sort to [5,10].\n\n        Same.\n\n   Therefore, our simulation of the func is equivalent.\n\n   However, note: the original program does the modulo operation and then if the result is 1, it breaks the entire program. We do the same: we set a flag and break the for loop and then the while loop.\n\n   But note: the original program might do the modulo operation and get 1, and then break immediately. We do the same.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Implementation details:\n\n        We need a compare_ints function for qsort.\n\n        We assume a maximum size for the array? The problem does not specify, but we can choose 100000.\n\n        We are going to read the integers for the first program.\n\n        Then we simulate the first program.\n\n        Then compute res2.\n\n        Then print res2.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the original program also breaks in the beginning if n==1. And if the max is zero (after the initial sort) then we set res1=0.\n\n   Also, note: the original program breaks if it finds a 1 during the modulo step and prints 1 and exits. We set res1=1 and break out of the while loop.\n\n   We must be cautious: the first program might break at any of these points.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n.\n        If n==1, then read the one integer -> res1 = that integer.\n        Else:\n            Read n integers into an array.\n            Sort the array.\n            If the last element (max) is 0 -> then res1=0.\n            Else:\n                Initialize a list (with the same array) and size = n.\n                found_one = 0;\n                while (1) {\n                    if (size==1) {\n                        res1 = list[0];\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    // simulate func:\n                    int min = 0;\n                    int new_list[100000]; // we'll use the same array? or we can overwrite the list? We'll use the same array and overwrite.\n                    int new_size = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {\n                        if (list[i]==0) {\n                            continue;\n                        }\n                        if (min==0) {\n                            min = list[i];\n                            new_list[new_size] = list[i];\n                            new_size++;\n                        } else {\n                            int mod = list[i] % min;\n                            if (mod==0) {\n                                // skip\n                                continue;\n                            }\n                            if (mod==1) {\n                                found_one = 1;\n                                break; // break the for loop\n                            }\n                            new_list[new_size] = mod;\n                            new_size++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (found_one) {\n                        res1 = 1;\n                        break; // break the while loop\n                    }\n                    if (new_size==0) {\n                        res1 = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    // copy new_list back to list? Actually, we can just use new_list as the current list? But we are going to sort and then use in the next iteration.\n                    // We'll copy the new_list into the beginning of list? and set size = new_size.\n                    for (int i=0; i<new_size; i++) {\n                        list[i] = new_list[i];\n                    }\n                    size = new_size;\n                    // sort the list (from 0 to size-1)\n                    qsort(list, size, sizeof(int), compare_ints);\n                }\n\n        Then:\n            res2 = (res1==1) ? 0 : 1;\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", res2);\n\n   We must write the compare_ints function.\n\n   Let me write:\n\n        int compare_ints(const void* a, const void* b) {\n            int arg1 = *(const int*)a;\n            int arg2 = *(const int*)b;\n            if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n            if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the original program sorts in ascending order? Yes.\n\n   However, the condition in the beginning: if the last element is 0 -> then output 0. We do: if (a[n-1]==0). So we are sorting in ascending order? Then the last element is the maximum. So we are safe.\n\n   But note: the initial sort: we sort the entire array of n integers. Then we check a[n-1] (the last element) for zero.\n\n   Then in the while loop, we sort the current list (size) at the end of each func.\n\n   We assume the array can be up to 100000 elements. We are using a fixed size array for the list (100000) and we are making a new_list of the same size? But the size can only decrease? So it's safe.\n\n   However, worst-case: the list might be reduced slowly? But modulo operations reduce the numbers quickly.\n\n   We are ready to code.\n\n   But note: the original program might have an element that becomes 1? We break and set res1=1. Then we break the while loop.\n\n   Also note: the condition in the for loop: if we break because of found_one, we break the for loop and then set res1=1 and break the while loop.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Important: we must not output anything until the very end.\n\n   We assume the input for the first program is provided on stdin.\n\n   Example test: \n        Input: \n            2\n            10 15\n        Expected chain output: \"1\"\n\n        Step1: res1 = 5 (from the first program: GCD(10,15)=5)\n        Step2: res2 = 1 (because 5 != 1)\n        Output: \"1\\n\"\n\n   Another test:\n        Input:\n            1\n            1\n        Then res1 = 1\n        Then res2 = 0\n        Output: \"0\\n\"\n\n   Another test:\n        Input:\n            3\n            2 4 6\n        Step1: \n            n=3, list = [2,4,6] -> sort: [2,4,6]\n            func:\n                min=0 -> set min=2. Then 4%2=0 -> skip. Then 6%2=0 -> skip. Then new_list = [2] -> new_size=1.\n            Then the while loop: now size=1 -> break, res1=2.\n        Step2: res2 = 1 (because 2 != 1)\n        Output: \"1\\n\"\n\n   Another test:\n        Input:\n            2\n            1 2\n        Step1: \n            n=2, list=[1,2] -> sort: [1,2]\n            func:\n                min=0 -> set min=1. Then 2%1=0 -> skip. Then new_list=[1] -> size=1 -> break, res1=1.\n        Then step2: res2=0 -> output \"0\\n\"\n\n   But note: in the original first program for [1,2]:\n        In the func: \n            min=0 -> then set min=1 (first element). Then for the next element: 2 % 1 = 0 -> skip? Then the list becomes [1]. Then the next iteration: size=1 -> break and output 1.\n\n        However, the original program does not break in the func? It does: after setting 2%1=0, it does not check for 1? Because the modulo operation did not yield 1? It yielded 0. So no break.\n\n        But wait: what if we have an element that becomes 1? \n\n        Example: [3, 7] \n            func1: \n                min=3, then 7%3=1 -> then the original program would break and output 1? \n            So for [3,7]: \n                Step1: res1=1 -> then step2: res2=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n        But wait: the GCD of 3 and 7 is 1? So the first program should output 1? Actually, the algorithm:\n\n            It repeatedly does: \n                [3,7] -> sort -> [3,7]\n                func: \n                    min=3, then 7%3=1 -> then the program prints 1 and exits.\n\n            So our simulation: \n                In the for loop for [3,7]:\n                    i=0: min=0 -> set min=3, copy 3 to new_list -> new_size=1.\n                    i=1: 7 -> mod=7%3=1 -> which is 1 -> we set found_one=1 -> break the for loop and then break the while loop and set res1=1.\n\n        Then step2: res2=0 -> output \"0\".\n\n        But the chain output is \"0\", which is correct? Because the first program outputs 1, then the second program outputs 0, then the third program outputs \"0\". \n\n        However, the GCD of 3 and 7 is 1? So the first program outputs 1? Then the chain outputs 0? Then the final output is \"0\". \n\n        But the expected output of the chain is \"0\" for this input? \n\n        So we are consistent.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: we must handle the case when the list becomes empty during the func (new_size==0) -> then we set res1=0 and break.\n\n   Let me test with zeros:\n\n        Input: \n            2\n            0 0\n        Then: \n            n=2, read [0,0] -> sort: [0,0] -> then check the last element (0) -> then set res1=0.\n        Then res2 = 1 -> output \"1\".\n\n        But the original first program: \n            if the last element is 0 -> output 0 and exit.\n\n        Then the chain: step2: input 0 -> output 1 -> step3: output \"1\".\n\n        So we output \"1\".\n\n   Another test: \n        Input: \n            3\n            0 0 0\n        Then: sort -> [0,0,0] -> last element=0 -> res1=0 -> then output \"1\".\n\n   Another test: \n        Input: \n            3\n            0 5 0\n        Then: sort -> [0,0,5] -> last element=5 (non-zero) -> then we go into the while loop.\n\n        Then we remove zeros: so the list becomes [5] -> then we break and set res1=5.\n\n        Then res2=1 -> output \"1\".\n\n   But the GCD of [0,5,0] is 5? Then the chain outputs \"1\", which is correct.\n\n   So we code accordingly.\n\n   Let me write the entire C program."
