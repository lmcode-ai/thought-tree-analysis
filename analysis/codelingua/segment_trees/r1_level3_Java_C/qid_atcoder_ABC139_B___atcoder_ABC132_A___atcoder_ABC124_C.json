But note: the third program's flipping logic: it flips a character to the opposite of what it is? But only if it is '1' or not? In the Java code: \n        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else to '1'. Similarly for the backward. This is defined for any character: if the character is '1', then becomes '0'; otherwise becomes '1'. So for the string \"No\": \n        In the forward pass: \n            We have two characters: 'N' and 'o'. The first character is 'N', the second is 'o'. They are different -> no flip. In the backward pass: \n            We start at the last character (index1: 'o') and compare to the previous (index0: 'N') -> different -> no flip. So counts are zero. But what if the string had two same characters? Example: s2 = \"aa\" (which might happen if the first program outputs 11? then s1=\"11\", then the second program: \n            distinct=1 (only '1') and frequency=2 -> then s2=\"Yes\" -> but wait, the second program requires distinct==2? So if the first program outputs 11, then distinct=1 -> so s2=\"No\". However, if the first program outputs 1122? (but the first program outputs one integer, so the number is 1122? Then the string is \"1122\". Frequency: \n                '1': 2 times\n                '2': 2 times -> distinct=2 and each twice -> s2=\"Yes\"\n\n        Then the third program gets \"Yes\": Forward: \n                index0: 'Y'\n                index1: 'e' -> different -> no flip. index2: 's' -> different from 'e'? -> no flip.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n However, note the types:\n   File1: reads two integers and outputs an integer.\n   File2: reads a string and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n   File3: reads a string and outputs an integer.\n\n But the output of File1 is an integer, which becomes the input to File2. However, File2 expects a string of four letters (from the context of the problem, but actually it expects any string).\n We have to adjust: The first program outputs an integer (say, 3) and then the second program expects a string. So we must convert the integer to a string for the second program.\n\n However, note the original chain: the output of the first program (an integer) is passed as the input to the second program. In the second program, it uses `in.next()` to read a string. \n That means the integer is read as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 3, then the second program will read the string \"3\".\n\n But the second program's logic: it checks that the string has exactly two distinct characters and that each appears exactly twice. \n However, if the input is a string of one digit (like \"3\"), then the length is 1. Then the map will have one entry with count 1 -> so it prints \"No\".\n\n So the chain: \n   Input to first program: two integers (A and B)\n   Output of first: one integer (result)\n   Input to second: that integer as a string (so the string representation of the integer)\n   Output of second: \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n   Input to third: that string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n   Output of third: an integer (the minimum of two counts)\n\n However, the third program expects a string of '0's and '1's? Actually, the third program in the original reads a string that is a sequence of '0's and '1's. \n But we are giving it either \"Yes\" or \"No\". This does not match.\n\n This indicates that the chain as provided might not be intended to be connected? But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Let me reexamine: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". But the three programs are from different contests (ABC139, ABC132, ABC124). \n They are independent problems. So it is likely that the problem intended to have three separate programs that we have to chain arbitrarily? \n\n However, the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\" meaning that we have to simulate the chain.\n\n Since the outputs and inputs are of different types, we have to connect them by converting the output of one to the input format of the next.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. First program: reads two integers (A and B) and computes an integer result.\n    Output: that integer (as a decimal string? but in the original it is printed as integer)\n\n 2. Second program: expects a string. So we take the integer output of the first and convert it to a string (without spaces, just the number as a string).\n\n 3. Second program: processes that string and outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (with a newline?).\n\n 4. Third program: expects a string. So we take the output of the second (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and use that as the input string.\n\n 5. Third program: processes that string (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and then does its flipping algorithm? \n    But note: the third program is designed for a string of '0's and '1's. However, we are giving it \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n    The program will try to flip characters to make adjacent ones different? \n\n    For example, if the string is \"Yes\":\n        'Y' (which is not '0' or '1') and then 'e' and then 's'. \n\n    The program's logic: \n        It builds two string builders (a and b) from the input string.\n        Then it traverses and flips when adjacent are the same? \n\n    But this is not the intended input for the third program. \n\n This chain does not make sense in terms of the problem contexts. \n\n However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically to the original chain\". \n\n But note: the original chain is three independent programs. The chain is defined by the output of one being the input to the next. \n\n We must follow the specification:\n\n   Input to the entire system: the input for the first program (two integers).\n   Then the output of the first becomes the input to the second (so we have to pass the integer as a string to the second program).\n   Then the output of the second becomes the input to the third (so we have to pass the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the third program).\n\n The third program will then run on that string and produce an integer output.\n\n Therefore, the entire system:\n\n   Step1: Read two integers (A, B).\n   Step2: Compute the integer result from the first program.\n   Step3: Convert that integer to a string (call it s1).\n   Step4: Run the second program on the string s1 (which expects a string and counts the frequency of each character). \n          It will output either \"Yes\" or \"No\", but we capture that as a string (call it s2).\n   Step5: Run the third program on the string s2 (which expects a string and then does the flipping operations to make adjacent characters different). \n          It will output an integer? Actually, the third program outputs an integer (the minimum number of flips). \n\n But note: the third program's output is an integer. So the entire system ends with an integer.\n\n However, the third program's original problem is about coloring stones (with 0 and 1). But we are feeding it \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n This is arbitrary, but we are just following the chain.\n\n Therefore, we have to code:\n\n   - Read two integers (A and B) at the beginning.\n   - Compute the first program's result (as an integer) and then convert to a string (without any extra spaces, just the integer in base 10).\n   - Then run the second program's logic on that string: \n          Count frequency of each character. Then check that there are exactly 2 distinct characters and each appears exactly twice -> then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n          But note: in the second program, if the string has length 4 and two distinct characters each twice, it says \"Yes\". But our string is a number, so it might be of any length and have any digits.\n\n   - Then take the string \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without newline? we'll capture the exact string) and feed it to the third program.\n\n   - The third program: \n          It has two methods: one starting from the front and one from the back? Actually, it builds two patterns: \n          Pattern a: traverse from left to right, and whenever two adjacent are the same, flip the current one and count a1.\n          Pattern b: traverse from right to left, and whenever two adjacent are the same, flip the left one and count a2.\n          Then output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\n   - Finally, output that integer.\n\n However, note: the third program's input is the string from the second program. For example, if the second program outputs \"Yes\", then the string is \"Yes\" (without quotes, and without any extra spaces?).\n\n Implementation in C:\n\n   We are to write one C program that does:\n\n      int A, B;\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n      // First program logic\n      int result1 = (B - 1) / (A - 1);\n      int amari = (B - 1) % (A - 1);\n      if (amari != 0) {\n          result1++;\n      }\n\n      // Convert result1 to a string (we don't know the length, so we can use a fixed buffer of 20 characters)\n      char s1[20];\n      snprintf(s1, sizeof(s1), \"%d\", result1);\n\n      // Now run the second program on s1\n      // The second program: count frequency of each char in s1\n      // We'll use an array for frequency (for all ASCII, but we know digits, so 0-9, but also negative? result1 is nonnegative so no minus)\n      // Actually, result1 is nonnegative? The problem: A and B are positive? In the first program, A>=2? because A-1 in denominator.\n\n      // But note: the first program: \n      //   It does (B-1)/(A-1). If A==1, then we have division by zero? \n      //   The original problem: atcoder_ABC139_B: \"Takahashi's House\" -> constraints: A>=2, B>=1.\n\n      // So we assume A>=2, B>=1 -> so result1 is nonnegative.\n\n      // Frequency count for s1\n      int freq[256] = {0}; // frequency array for ASCII\n      for (int i=0; s1[i]; i++) {\n          freq[(int)s1[i]]++;\n      }\n\n      // Now, we need to check: \n      //   - There are exactly 2 distinct characters? \n      //   - And each character appears exactly twice?\n      int distinct = 0;\n      int ok = 1;\n      for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n          if (freq[i] > 0) {\n              if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                  ok = 0;\n                  // break; // we can break early? but let's just set ok to false.\n              }\n              distinct++;\n          }\n      }\n      char s2[10]; // either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we need 3 or 4 bytes? including null terminator? \"Yes\" is 3, \"No\" is 2, but we'll use 10.\n      if (ok && distinct == 2) {\n          strcpy(s2, \"Yes\");\n      } else {\n          strcpy(s2, \"No\");\n      }\n\n      // Now run the third program on s2\n      // We are going to simulate the third program on the string s2.\n      // The third program: \n      //   It has two methods: \n      //     Method 1: traverse from left to right (starting at index1) and flip when same as left neighbor.\n      //     Method 2: traverse from right to left (starting at last index and going to index1) and flip the left neighbor when same.\n\n      // We are not going to actually modify the string? We can simulate without modifying? \n      // But the original modifies a copy. However, we are going to simulate the counts.\n\n      // Alternatively, we can simulate the two methods:\n\n      // Method1 (forward):\n      int a1 = 0;\n      // We make a copy of the string? but we don't want to modify the original s2. We can simulate by keeping the current pattern in an array? \n      // However, note: the third program uses two StringBuilders (a and b) and modifies them. We can do the same.\n\n      // But note: the third program's input is arbitrary? It was designed for '0' and '1' but we are giving it \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n      // It will still run: for example, for \"Yes\": \n      //   String: \"Yes\" -> length=3\n      //   Pattern a: \n      //        index0: 'Y'\n      //        index1: 'e' -> compare to index0: different -> do nothing.\n      //        index2: 's' -> compare to index1: different -> do nothing.\n      //        so a1=0.\n      //   Pattern b: \n      //        start from index2: \n      //        index2: 's'\n      //        index1: 'e' -> compare to index2: different -> do nothing.\n      //        index0: 'Y' -> compare to index1: different -> do nothing.\n      //        so a2=0.\n      //   Then output min(0,0)=0.\n\n      // How about \"No\": \n      //   \"No\": length=2\n      //   Pattern a: \n      //        index0: 'N'\n      //        index1: 'o' -> compare to 'N': different -> do nothing -> a1=0.\n      //   Pattern b:\n      //        index1: 'o'\n      //        index0: 'N' -> compare to 'o': different -> do nothing -> a2=0.\n      //   Output 0.\n\n      // But the third program's logic: \n      //   Pattern a: \n      //        for (int i=1; i<len; i++) {\n      //            if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n      //                flip a[i] (if it's '1' to '0' or vice versa) -> but note: in the original it was only for '0' and '1'. \n      //                However, the program uses: \n      //                  if (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else to '1'. \n      //                But in our case, the character might not be '0' or '1'. \n      //                For example, if we have \"YY\", then at i=1, we see 'Y' and then we set it to '0' if it was '1'? \n      //                But it was 'Y' -> so else branch: set to '1'. \n      //                So it becomes 'Y' and then '1'. \n      //            }\n      //        }\n      //   This is arbitrary. \n\n      // But note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\".

The first program's output is an integer that becomes the string for the second. The second outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the third takes that and outputs an integer.\n\n However, note: the original first program outputs the integer and then the second program reads that integer as a string. \n But in our C program, we are simulating the entire chain without any intermediate I/O. \n\n But the problem says: \n      - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n      - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n So we do:\n\n      Read A and B (with scanf).\n      Then compute the integer for the first program and convert to a string (s1).\n      Then run the second program's logic on s1 to produce a string (s2: \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n      Then run the third program's logic on s2 to produce an integer (result3).\n      Then print result3.\n\n However, note: the second program in the original prints \"Yes\" or \"No\" (with a newline). But we are capturing the string without the newline? \n We are building s2 as \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without any newline). That matches because the original output is without any extra spaces? \n\n But the third program reads the next token? In the third program, it uses `in.next()` which reads a token (without spaces). \n So if the second program output \"Yes\\n\", then the third program would read \"Yes\". \n\n In our chain, we are passing the string \"Yes\" (without newline) to the third program. So it is the same.\n\n However, the third program's InputReader uses `next()` which reads tokens. So we are safe.\n\n But note: the third program's InputReader is designed to read tokens. We are giving it one token.\n\n Therefore, we write the entire chain as described.\n\n However, there is an issue: the first program might have edge conditions? For example, when A==1? \n The original problem states: 2<=A<=20, 1<=B<=20. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we assume the input constraints of the original problems.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Steps in the C program:\n\n   Step 1: Read two integers A and B.\n   Step 2: Compute the first result (as an integer) and then convert to a string (s1).\n   Step 3: For the second program:\n        - Count the frequency of each character in s1.\n        - Check that there are exactly 2 distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n        - Set s2 to \"Yes\" if true, else \"No\".\n   Step 4: For the third program:\n        - Make two copies of s2 (a_str and b_str).\n        - For the forward pass (a_str): \n            for i from 1 to len-1 (inclusive) of a_str:\n                if a_str[i] equals a_str[i-1]:\n                    flip a_str[i]: if it is '1' set to '0', otherwise set to '1'\n                    increment count1.\n        - For the backward pass (b_str):\n            for i from len-1 down to 1:\n                if b_str[i] equals b_str[i-1]:\n                    flip b_str[i-1]: if it is '1' set to '0', otherwise set to '1'\n                    increment count2.\n        - result3 = min(count1, count2)\n   Step 5: Print result3.\n\n Let's test with a small example:\n\n   Input: A=2, B=3\n   First program: \n        result = (3-1)/(2-1) = 2/1 = 2, amari=0 -> so result=2.\n   Then s1 = \"2\"\n   Second program: \n        frequency: \n           '2': 1 -> distinct=1 -> not two distinct and each twice -> so s2 = \"No\"\n   Third program: \n        s2 = \"No\" (which is two characters: 'N' and 'o')\n        Forward pass:\n            i=1: compare 'o' and 'N' -> not equal -> no flip -> count1=0.\n        Backward pass:\n            i=1: compare b_str[1]='o' and b_str[0]='N' -> not equal -> no flip -> count2=0.\n        result3 = 0.\n\n   Output: 0.\n\n   But the original chain: \n        Program1: input \"2 3\" -> outputs 2.\n        Program2: input \"2\" -> outputs \"No\".\n        Program3: input \"No\" -> outputs 0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we are doing correctly.\n\n But note: the third program's flipping logic: it flips a character to the opposite of what it is? But only if it is '1' or not? \n In the Java code: \n        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else to '1'. \n        Similarly for the backward.\n\n This is defined for any character: if the character is '1', then becomes '0'; otherwise becomes '1'. \n So for the string \"No\": \n        In the forward pass: \n            We have two characters: 'N' and 'o'. \n            The first character is 'N', the second is 'o'. \n            They are different -> no flip.\n\n        In the backward pass: \n            We start at the last character (index1: 'o') and compare to the previous (index0: 'N') -> different -> no flip.\n\n        So counts are zero.\n\n   But what if the string had two same characters? \n        Example: s2 = \"aa\" (which might happen if the first program outputs 11? then s1=\"11\", then the second program: \n            distinct=1 (only '1') and frequency=2 -> then s2=\"Yes\" -> but wait, the second program requires distinct==2? \n            So if the first program outputs 11, then distinct=1 -> so s2=\"No\". \n\n        However, if the first program outputs 1122? (but the first program outputs one integer, so the number is 1122? \n            Then the string is \"1122\". \n            Frequency: \n                '1': 2 times\n                '2': 2 times -> distinct=2 and each twice -> s2=\"Yes\"\n\n        Then the third program gets \"Yes\": \n            Forward: \n                index0: 'Y'\n                index1: 'e' -> different -> no flip.\n                index2: 's' -> different from 'e'? -> no flip.\n            Backward:\n                index2: 's' -> compare to index1: 'e' -> different -> no flip.\n                index1: 'e' -> compare to index0: 'Y' -> different -> no flip.\n            So counts=0.\n\n        Then output 0.\n\n   How about if we have \"00\" (which won't come from the second program because the second program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\")? \n   But if we had a string \"00\" in the third program, then:\n\n        Forward: \n            index1: '0' and index0: '0' -> same -> flip index1: \n                since it's '0', we set to '1' -> becomes \"01\". Then count1=1.\n        Backward:\n            index1: '0' and index0: '0' -> same -> flip index0: \n                since it's '0', set to '1' -> becomes \"10\". Then count2=1.\n\n        Then output 1.\n\n   So the program is defined for any string.\n\n Therefore, we code accordingly.\n\n Important: we must not do any I/O in between. \n\n Let's write the C code accordingly.\n\n Note: the third program in the original uses a custom InputReader that reads tokens. We are passing the entire string s2 (without spaces) so it's one token.\n\n But note: the third program's original input might have been a string of 0s and 1s of arbitrary length. Our string s2 is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so length 3 or 2.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n\n   int main() {\n       // Step 1: Read A and B\n       int A, B;\n       scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n       // Step 2: First program logic\n       int result1 = (B - 1) / (A - 1);\n       int amari = (B - 1) % (A - 1);\n       if (amari != 0) {\n           result1++;\n       }\n\n       // Convert result1 to string\n       char s1[20];\n       snprintf(s1, sizeof(s1), \"%d\", result1);\n\n       // Step 3: Second program logic\n       int freq[256] = {0}; // all zeros\n       int len1 = strlen(s1);\n       for (int i = 0; i < len1; i++) {\n           freq[(unsigned char)s1[i]]++;\n       }\n\n       int distinct = 0;\n       int ok = 1;\n       for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n           if (freq[i] != 0) {\n               distinct++;\n               if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                   ok = 0;\n               }\n           }\n       }\n\n       char s2[10];\n       if (ok && distinct == 2) {\n           strcpy(s2, \"Yes\");\n       } else {\n           strcpy(s2, \"No\");\n       }\n\n       // Step 4: Third program logic\n       int len2 = strlen(s2);\n       // We need two copies of s2: a_str and b_str\n       char a_str[len2+1]; // +1 for null terminator\n       char b_str[len2+1];\n       strcpy(a_str, s2);\n       strcpy(b_str, s2);\n\n       int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;\n\n       // Forward pass: traverse from i=1 to len2-1\n       for (int i = 1; i < len2; i++) {\n           if (a_str[i] == a_str[i-1]) {\n               // flip a_str[i]\n               if (a_str[i] == '1') {\n                   a_str[i] = '0';\n               } else {\n                   a_str[i] = '1';\n               }\n               count1++;\n           }\n       }\n\n       // Backward pass: traverse from i = len2-1 down to 1\n       for (int i = len2-1; i > 0; i--) {\n           if (b_str[i] == b_str[i-1]) {\n               // flip b_str[i-1]\n               if (b_str[i-1] == '1') {\n                   b_str[i-1] = '0';\n               } else {\n                   b_str[i-1] = '1';\n               }\n               count2++;\n           }\n       }\n\n       int result3 = (count1 < count2) ? count1 : count2;\n\n       // Step 5: Output the result of the third program\n       printf(\"%d\\n\", result3);\n\n       return 0;\n   }\n\n However, note: the backward pass in the third program flips the left neighbor (b_str[i-1]), and then we continue? \n The next comparisons use the modified string? \n\n Example: \"000\"\n   Original backward pass in the third program (Java) for the string \"000\":\n\n        Start: b_str = \"000\"\n        i=2: compare b_str[2] and b_str[1]: both '0' -> same -> flip b_str[1] to '1'. Now string becomes \"010\". Then count2=1.\n        Then i=1: compare b_str[1] and b_str[0]: now '1' and '0' -> different -> no flip.\n\n        So total count2=1.\n\n   In our C code for the backward pass:\n\n        We start with b_str = \"000\"\n        i=2: b_str[2]=='0', b_str[1]=='0' -> same -> flip b_str[1] to '1'. Then string becomes \"010\". Then count2=1.\n        Then i=1: compare b_str[1] and b_str[0]: now '1' and '0' -> different -> skip.\n\n        So same.\n\n   But note: the forward pass in the third program (Java) for \"000\":\n\n        i=1: a_str[1]=='0' and a_str[0]=='0' -> same -> flip a_str[1] to '1'. Now string becomes \"010\", count1=1.\n        i=2: a_str[2]=='0' and a_str[1]=='1' -> different -> skip.\n\n        So count1=1.\n\n   Then result3=min(1,1)=1.\n\n   In our C code, we do the same.\n\n   However, note: the Java code for the backward pass flips the left neighbor (i-1) and then we move to the next (which is i-1, then i-2). \n   So the next comparison (i-2 and i-3) uses the modified left neighbor? \n\n   But in the example above, we don't have an element at i-2? \n\n   The C code does the same: we traverse from high index to low index, and we flip the left neighbor (at i-1). \n   Then the next iteration (i-1) will compare the new value at i-1 (if we haven't passed it) and i-2? \n\n   Actually, the loop index is going down: \n        i starts at len2-1, then i-1, ... until 1.\n\n   And when we flip at position i-1, then the next comparison (for i-1 and i-2) will use the new value at i-1? \n\n   But note: the next iteration is i = i-1, and then we compare b_str[i] (which is at the old i-1, now the new i) and b_str[i-1] (which is at the old i-2). \n   So the flip at the current iteration (at position i-1) will affect the next comparison (if the next iteration is for i-1 and i-2) because the value at i-1 is now changed? \n\n   Example: \"0000\"\n\n        Without flips: \n          Backward pass:\n            i=3: compare b_str[3] and b_str[2]: both '0' -> flip b_str[2] to '1' -> becomes \"0010\", count2=1.\n            i=2: compare b_str[2] and b_str[1]: now b_str[2] is '1', b_str[1] is '0' -> different -> skip.\n            i=1: compare b_str[1] and b_str[0]: both '0' -> flip b_str[0] to '1' -> becomes \"1010\", count2=2.\n\n        But wait: after the first flip, the string becomes \"0010\", then at i=2 we compare the new b_str[2] (which is '1') and b_str[1] (which is '0') -> skip.\n        Then at i=1: we compare b_str[1] and b_str[0]: both are now '0'? Actually, we have:\n            Original: \"0000\"\n            After first flip (at i=3): flip index2 -> becomes \"0010\"\n            Then at i=2: we compare index2 and index1: '1' and '0' -> skip.\n            Then at i=1: we compare index1 and index0: '0' and '0' -> same -> flip index0 to '1'. Then becomes \"1010\".\n\n        So the backward pass does two flips.\n\n        Now the forward pass for \"0000\":\n            i=1: same -> flip index1 to '1' -> becomes \"0100\", count1=1.\n            i=2: compare index2 and index1: '0' and '1' -> skip.\n            i=3: compare index3 and index2: '0' and '0' -> same -> flip index3 to '1' -> becomes \"0101\", count1=2.\n\n        Then result3 = min(2,2)=2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we are simulating the backward pass correctly: we modify the array and then the next comparisons use the modified array.\n\n   So the code above is correct.\n\n   Let's write the entire C code.\n\n   Note: we assume the input constraints (A>=2, B>=1) so no division by zero.\n\n   Also, the string s1 for the second program: the integer is nonnegative, so no minus sign.\n\n   We use unsigned char for frequency to avoid negative indices? But the digits are in the positive ASCII range.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: if the string s2 has length 0 or 1? \n        If the string has length 0 or 1, then the loops in the third program do nothing -> counts are 0.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   We run the code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:"
