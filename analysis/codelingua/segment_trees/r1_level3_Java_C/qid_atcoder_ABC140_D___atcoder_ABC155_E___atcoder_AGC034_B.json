Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program. We read two integers and then a string. The string is after the two integers and we assume it is on the same line or next line? In the first Java program, it uses `sc.next()` for the string. So the string is the next token. We can read:\n\n          int N, K;\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n          char S[200000];   // We need to know the max size? The problem says N, so we can allocate dynamically or with a large buffer. scanf(\"%s\", S);\n\n        But note: the first program uses `sc.next()` for S, which reads the next token (without spaces). So we can do the same. Step 2: Run the first program's logic on (N, K, S) and get an integer res1. Step 3: Convert res1 to a string:\n\n          char input2[20]; // since res1 is an integer, 20 digits is safe. snprintf(input2, sizeof(input2), \"%d\", res1); Then we run the second program's logic on the string input2.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three programs into one C program.\n The input of the entire sequence is the input for the first program (atcoder_ABC140_D).\n The output of the first program becomes the input of the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E).\n The output of the second program becomes the input of the third program (atcoder_AGC034_B).\n However, note that the first program outputs an integer (via System.out.println) and the second program reads a string (via sc.next()).\n Similarly, the second program outputs an integer and the third program reads a string.\n\n We must design the flow without I/O in between. We will:\n\n 1. Read the input for the first program (N, K, and S) from stdin.\n 2. Run the logic of the first program and capture its output as an integer (let it be `output1`).\n 3. Use `output1` as the input for the second program: convert the integer to a string (since the second program reads a string of digits).\n    But note: the second program expects a string of digits (like \"1234\") and then reverses it and processes each digit.\n 4. Run the logic of the second program on the string representation of `output1` and capture its output (an integer, `output2`).\n 5. Use `output2` as the input for the third program: convert the integer to a string (since the third program expects a string) and then replace \"BC\" with \"D\".\n    However, note that the third program's input is a string that may contain only 'A', 'B', 'C', but in our case we are converting an integer to a string? \n    But wait: the third program expects a string that can contain 'A', 'B', 'C'. However, the output of the second program is an integer and we convert it to a string of digits. \n    This does not match the expected input of the third program.\n\n This indicates a problem: the programs are not designed to be chained by the output of the previous one? \n\n Let me reexamine the original programs:\n\n Program 1: Reads N, K, and a string S. Then it processes S and outputs an integer (the maximum of two sums).\n\n Program 2: Reads a string (which represents a number) and outputs an integer (the minimal number of bills).\n\n Program 3: Reads a string (which in the example is a string of A, B, C) and outputs a long (the count of operations).\n\n How can we chain them?\n\n The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So:\n\n  Input to the entire system is the input for program1: (N, K, S) -> output1 (an integer) -> becomes input for program2 (as a string of digits) -> output2 (an integer) -> becomes input for program3 (as a string of digits?).\n\n But program3 expects a string that may contain letters, not digits. \n\n However, note the example in program3: the sample input is \"ABC\" or \"ABBC\", etc.\n\n This suggests that the programs are independent and not designed to be chained arbitrarily. \n\n But the problem states: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n Therefore, we must assume that the output of program1 (an integer) is passed as a string to program2, and the output of program2 (an integer) is passed as a string to program3.\n\n However, program3's logic is designed for a string of 'A','B','C'. But we are giving it a string of digits. \n\n This will cause program3 to process the string of digits: it will replace any occurrence of \"BC\" (which in digits would be if we have the characters 'B' and 'C'? but we have digits) with 'D'. \n But in the string of digits, there are no 'B' or 'C'. So the replacement does nothing. Then it counts:\n\n   - When it sees 'A' (which is the character 'A', not in a digit string) it increments tmp.\n   - When it sees 'D' (which we don't have) it adds tmp.\n   - Otherwise (which for digits, we always have) it sets tmp=0.\n\n So the result would be 0.\n\n This does not make sense. Therefore, I suspect that the problem intended that the programs are chained with the same data type? \n\n But the problem does not specify. However, note the original programs:\n\n Program1: input is (int, int, string) and output is an integer.\n Program2: input is a string (of digits) and output is an integer.\n Program3: input is a string (of letters) and output is a long.\n\n So the output of program1 is an integer, which is then converted to a string for program2. Then the output of program2 is an integer, which is then converted to a string for program3.\n\n But program3 expects a string of letters. How can we reconcile?\n\n After re-reading the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n However, the original chain is not defined. We are just given three programs. The problem says they are meant to be executed in sequence.\n\n How to test? We are not given sample input for the entire chain.\n\n Since the problem does not specify how the programs are connected beyond the output being the input of the next, we must assume that the output of one is the input of the next as a string.\n\n Therefore, we must:\n\n   Step 1: Run program1 on the initial input (N, K, S) -> produces an integer, say X.\n   Step 2: Convert X to a string (without any extra characters, just the digits) and use that as the input for program2.\n   Step 3: Program2 processes that string and produces an integer, say Y.\n   Step 4: Convert Y to a string and use that as the input for program3.\n\n But note: program3's sample input is a string of letters. However, we are feeding it a string of digits. \n\n This might be acceptable if the problem intended to run the entire chain on arbitrary input? But the first program expects a string S that is composed of 'L' and 'R'. \n\n How can we run the entire chain? \n\n We must run the entire chain on the same input that the first program expects. The first program expects:\n\n   Input: \n        N K\n        S (a string of length N, composed of 'L' and 'R')\n\n Then the entire chain would:\n\n   Step1: Compute the maximum happiness (the integer output by program1) from the string S with at most K operations.\n   Step2: Treat that integer as a string and run the second program (which computes the minimal number of bills for that number).\n   Step3: Treat the output of step2 (an integer) as a string and run the third program (which counts operations in a string of A, B, C, but now we are giving it digits).\n\n The third program will output 0 because there are no 'A' or 'D' in the string of digits? \n\n This seems nonsensical. \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the programs are independent and we are to run them in sequence on the same initial input? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the input to the entire system is the input for the first program. The second program does not get the same input, but the output of the first.\n\n I see two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The problem has a mistake and the programs are not intended to be chained arbitrarily.\n\n   Possibility 2: The problem expects that we chain the output of one as the input of the next, regardless of the original context.\n\n Since the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\", we must do what the problem says.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the initial input (for the first program): two integers and a string.\n\n   Run the first program's logic and get an integer result (call it res1).\n\n   Then, for the second program, we convert res1 to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits) and use that as the input string for the second program.\n\n   The second program then processes that string and produces an integer (res2).\n\n   Then, for the third program, we convert res2 to a string and use that as the input string for the third program.\n\n   The third program then processes that string and produces a long (res3).\n\n   Then we output res3.\n\n But note: the third program originally outputs a long. However, the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\", so we output res3.\n\n However, the third program in Java uses `out.println(cnt);` which prints a long (if cnt is long) and then a newline.\n\n So in C, we will print a long and then a newline.\n\n But wait: the second program outputs an integer (bills) and the third program expects a string. We are converting that integer to a string.\n\n How to convert integers to strings in C?\n\n   We can use `snprintf` to write the integer to a character array.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program.\n\n        We read two integers and then a string. The string is after the two integers and we assume it is on the same line or next line? \n        In the first Java program, it uses `sc.next()` for the string. So the string is the next token.\n\n        We can read:\n\n          int N, K;\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n          char S[200000];   // We need to know the max size? The problem says N, so we can allocate dynamically or with a large buffer.\n          scanf(\"%s\", S);\n\n        But note: the first program uses `sc.next()` for S, which reads the next token (without spaces). So we can do the same.\n\n   Step 2: Run the first program's logic on (N, K, S) and get an integer res1.\n\n   Step 3: Convert res1 to a string:\n\n          char input2[20]; // since res1 is an integer, 20 digits is safe.\n          snprintf(input2, sizeof(input2), \"%d\", res1);\n\n        Then we run the second program's logic on the string input2.\n\n        The second program:\n\n            It reverses the string and converts each char to a digit (by subtracting '0').\n\n            But note: the original program does:\n\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n\n            We will create an array of integers for the digits. The length of the string is len = strlen(input2). We also note that the program uses an array of length (len+1) and one extra for the next digit.\n\n            We have to simulate the same.\n\n   Step 4: After the second program, we get an integer res2.\n\n   Step 5: Convert res2 to a string: \n\n          char input3[20]; // for res2\n          snprintf(input3, sizeof(input3), \"%d\", res2);\n\n        Then run the third program on input3.\n\n        The third program:\n\n            It replaces every occurrence of \"BC\" with 'D'. But note: our string input3 is a string of digits. There is no \"BC\", so it does nothing.\n\n            Then it counts:\n\n                long cnt = 0;\n                long tmp = 0;\n                for each char in the string:\n                    if char=='A' -> tmp++\n                    else if char=='D' -> cnt += tmp\n                    else -> tmp=0\n\n            Since there are no 'A' and no 'D', then tmp remains 0 and cnt remains 0.\n\n        So the output is 0.\n\n   Step 6: Print the output (0) and then the program ends.\n\n However, this is the behavior: the chain of the three programs on the initial input for the first program will output 0.\n\n But note: the first program might output a very large integer? Then the second program does some bill calculation? Then the third program outputs 0.\n\n This is what the code does.\n\n But is that the intended behavior? We are just following the chain.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior as the original chain\".\n\n So we must do exactly that.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We are going to write one C program that:\n\n        - Reads the input for the first program (N, K, S).\n        - Executes the first program's logic to get res1.\n        - Converts res1 to a string (str1).\n        - Executes the second program's logic on str1 to get res2.\n        - Converts res2 to a string (str2).\n        - Executes the third program's logic on str2 to get res3.\n        - Prints res3.\n\n   We must be cautious about:\n\n        - The first program: it does two passes (one for turning L to R and one for turning R to L) and then computes two sums and then takes the max.\n\n        - The second program: it processes the string as digits and then does a greedy algorithm.\n\n        - The third program: it replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", but note that our string has no 'B' or 'C', so no replacement.\n\n   We must be cautious about the array sizes.\n\n   For the first program:\n\n        The string S has length N. We are told that N is read. We can assume a maximum? The problem does not specify, so we will use dynamic allocation? Or we can set a max.\n\n        But the problem says: the original Java program uses `sc.next()` and then `toCharArray()`. We don't know the maximum N.\n\n        We'll assume that the input size is not too big (like 200000) and we can allocate on the stack if we set a max, or we can use dynamic allocation.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we will set a maximum. The first program reads N, so we can use N to allocate.\n\n        However, in C we cannot allocate variable-sized arrays on the stack if they are too big. We can use dynamic allocation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read the constraints: the first program is from ABC140_D which had constraints N up to 200000.\n\n        So we can declare:\n\n            #define MAX_N 200000\n\n        and then:\n\n            char S[MAX_N+1];\n\n        and then read:\n\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n            scanf(\"%s\", S);\n\n   Steps for the first program:\n\n        We are going to duplicate the logic.\n\n        The first program:\n\n            It creates two copies: c1 and c3 (both same as S).\n\n            Then two loops:\n\n                Loop1 (for c1):\n                    flag = false\n                    count = 0\n                    for i from 0 to N-1:\n                         if (flag and c1[i]=='R') -> flag=false, count++.\n                         if count==K: break.\n                         if c1[i]=='L': flag=true, c1[i]='R'\n\n                Loop2 (for c3):\n                    flag = false\n                    count = 0\n                    for i from 0 to N-1:\n                         if (flag and c3[i]=='L') -> flag=false, count++.\n                         if count==K: break.\n                         if c3[i]=='R': flag=true, c3[i]='L'\n\n            Then it computes the happiness for the string c1:\n\n                count = 1\n                sum1 = 0\n                bef = c1[0]\n                for i from 1 to N-1:\n                    if c1[i]==bef: count++ and if at the last, then add count-1.\n                    else: add count-1, set bef to c1[i], reset count to 1.\n\n            Similarly for c3: compute sum3.\n\n            Then res1 = max(sum1, sum3)\n\n   Steps for the second program:\n\n        We have a string (str1) which is the representation of res1.\n\n        We create an array of integers `digits` of length (len+2) [to have an extra for the next digit and one beyond].\n\n        Initialize:\n\n            len = strlen(str1)\n            digits[i] for i from 0 to len-1: \n                 digits[i] = str1[len-1-i] - '0'\n\n            Set digits[len] = 0; digits[len+1] = 0; ... (we need to initialize the next positions to 0 because we might increment beyond the last digit).\n\n        Then:\n\n            bills = 0;\n            for i from 0 to len (inclusive, because the original goes to number.length() which is len, and then uses digits[i+1] which might be at len+1) {\n                if (digits[i] == 10) { // note: the original checks for 10 and then sets to 0 and increments next.\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then res2 = bills.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        We have a string (str2) which is the representation of res2.\n\n        We don't need to replace \"BC\" because there are none. We can skip the replacement step? But the original replaces \"BC\" with 'D'. \n        We can do:\n\n            // We are not going to actually replace, because there is no \"BC\", but we must simulate the same loop.\n\n            long cnt = 0;\n            long tmp = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n                if (str2[i]=='A') {\n                    tmp++;\n                } else if (str2[i]=='D') {   // note: the original replaced \"BC\" with 'D', but we don't have any 'D'? and we didn't have any \"BC\" to replace, so we won't have any 'D'\n                    cnt += tmp;\n                } else {\n                    tmp = 0;\n                }\n            }\n            res3 = cnt;\n\n        Since the string is digits, we never see 'A' or 'D', so tmp is always 0 and cnt remains 0.\n\n   Then we print res3.\n\n However, note: the third program in the original code also sets the output to `cnt` (a long). So we output that.\n\n But we must be cautious: the third program's original code:\n\n        s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\n        Then it iterates over the string.\n\n   We are not doing the replacement, but we are passing the string of digits. So we are effectively doing:\n\n        s = the string of digits (without any replacement)\n\n        Then the loop: which in our case will set tmp=0 for every non-A and non-D? And since there are no A and D, then the entire time tmp=0.\n\n   So the output is 0.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n   But we must verify with a sample.\n\n   We are not given a sample for the entire chain. We are only given the three programs independently.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\".\n\n   We are following the chain: the output of program1 (an integer) is passed to program2 as a string. Then the output of program2 (an integer) is passed to program3 as a string.\n\n   And program3 will output 0.\n\n   So for any input, the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n   But that cannot be the intended behavior? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we run the three programs independently on the same input? \n\n   But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n   We must follow the specification.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the first program reads three tokens: N, K, and S.\n\n   The second program reads one token: a string.\n\n   The third program reads one token: a string.\n\n   So the entire input for the chain is the three tokens for the first program.\n\n   The output is the integer 0.\n\n   We write:\n\n        Step 1: Read N, K, and S.\n\n        Step 2: Run the first program's logic to compute res1.\n\n        Step 3: Convert res1 to a string (str1).\n\n        Step 4: Run the second program's logic on str1 to compute res2.\n\n        Step 5: Convert res2 to a string (str2).\n\n        Step 6: Run the third program's logic on str2 to compute res3.\n\n        Step 7: Print res3.\n\n   But note: the third program outputs a long. We use `printf(\"%ld\\n\", res3);`\n\n   However, if we are on Windows and using long long, we might use `%lld`? But the problem doesn't specify the range.\n\n   Let's check:\n\n        The third program: the variable `cnt` is a long. In Java, long is 64-bit.\n\n        In C, we can use `long` or `long long`? But note: the value of res3 is 0, so we can use `long` and then `%ld`.\n\n        But the third program's input is the string representation of res2 (which is an integer from the second program). The second program's output is an integer (bills). The value of bills can be large? \n\n        However, the third program's output is 0, so it doesn't matter.\n\n   We'll use `long` for the third program's result.\n\n   But note: in the third program, we have:\n\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n\n        Then we iterate and set:\n\n            if (str2[i]=='A') -> tmp++ (which is a long)\n            else if (str2[i]=='D') -> cnt += tmp (long addition)\n\n        So we must use `long` for these.\n\n   However, since our string has no 'A' or 'D', we don't need to worry about overflow? But we still use `long` for the variables.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll write the C program step by step.\n\n   We assume the maximum length for the first string is 200000.\n\n   We'll define:\n\n        #define MAX_N 200000\n\n   Then:\n\n        int N, K;\n        char S[MAX_N+10];   // extra buffer\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n        scanf(\"%s\", S);\n\n   Then we run the first program's logic.\n\n   Note: the first program uses two arrays: c1 and c3, which are copies of S.\n\n        char c1[MAX_N+10];\n        char c3[MAX_N+10];\n        strcpy(c1, S);\n        strcpy(c3, S);\n\n        // Then the two loops.\n\n        // First loop for c1:\n        int count = 0;\n        int flag = 0; // false\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n            if (flag && c1[i]=='R') {\n                flag = 0;\n                count++;\n                if (count == K) break;\n            }\n            if (c1[i]=='L') {\n                flag = 1;\n                c1[i] = 'R';\n            }\n        }\n\n        // But note: the original breaks when count==K. So we break.\n\n        // Second loop for c3:\n        count = 0;\n        flag = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n            if (flag && c3[i]=='L') {\n                flag = 0;\n                count++;\n                if (count == K) break;\n            }\n            if (c3[i]=='R') {\n                flag = 1;\n                c3[i] = 'L';\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Now compute happiness for c1:\n\n        int count_seq = 1;\n        int sum1 = 0;\n        char bef = c1[0];\n        for (int i=1; i<N; i++) {\n            if (c1[i]==bef) {\n                count_seq++;\n                if (i==N-1) {\n                    sum1 += count_seq - 1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                sum1 += count_seq - 1;\n                bef = c1[i];\n                count_seq = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Similarly for c3:\n\n        count_seq = 1;\n        int sum3 = 0;\n        bef = c3[0];\n        for (int i=1; i<N; i++) {\n            if (c3[i]==bef) {\n                count_seq++;\n                if (i==N-1) {\n                    sum3 += count_seq - 1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                sum3 += count_seq - 1;\n                bef = c3[i];\n                count_seq = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        int res1 = (sum1 > sum3) ? sum1 : sum3;\n\n   Then we convert res1 to a string:\n\n        char str1[20];\n        snprintf(str1, sizeof(str1), \"%d\", res1);\n\n   Now run the second program on str1:\n\n        int len1 = strlen(str1);\n        // We create an array `digits` of length len1+2, initialized to 0 beyond the string.\n        int digits[len1+2];\n        for (int i=0; i<len1+2; i++) digits[i] = 0;\n\n        // Convert the string: the original reverses the string and subtracts '0'\n        for (int i=0; i<len1; i++) {\n            digits[i] = str1[len1-1-i] - '0';\n        }\n\n        int bills = 0;\n        for (int i=0; i<=len1; i++) { // the original goes to number.length() (which is len1) inclusive? and then uses i+1 which might be at len1+1, which we have allocated.\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i] = 0;\n                digits[i+1]++;\n            }\n            if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                bills += 5;\n            } else {\n                bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                digits[i+1]++;\n            }\n        }\n        int res2 = bills;\n\n   Then convert res2 to a string:\n\n        char str2[20];\n        snprintf(str2, sizeof(str2), \"%d\", res2);\n\n   Now run the third program on str2:\n\n        // We don't do the replacement because we are passing a string of digits and there is no \"BC\", so we skip.\n        // But we have to simulate the same loop: we are going to iterate over the string.\n\n        long cnt = 0;\n        long tmp = 0;\n        int len2 = strlen(str2);\n        for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n            if (str2[i]=='A') {\n                tmp++;\n            } else if (str2[i]=='D') {\n                cnt += tmp;\n            } else {\n                tmp = 0;\n            }\n        }\n        long res3 = cnt;\n\n   Then output:\n\n        printf(\"%ld\\n\", res3);\n\n   However, note: the third program originally replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", but we are skipping that. We are passing the string of digits and not replacing anything.\n\n   This matches the behavior: the original third program would do:\n\n        String s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\n        Then iterate.\n\n   We are doing the same: we are not replacing any \"BC\" because there is none, so the string remains the same.\n\n   Therefore, we are correct.\n\n   Let's compile and test with a sample.\n\n   Sample input for the first program:\n\n        Example from ABC140_D: \n          Input: \"3 1\\nLRR\"\n\n          Expected output for the first program: 2\n\n        Then the second program:\n\n          Input: \"2\"\n          The second program: \n              digits = [2] -> then we consider it as [2] (with an extra zero at the next digit?).\n              i=0: digits[0]=2 -> bills += 2.\n              Then res2 = 2.\n\n        Then the third program:\n\n          Input: \"2\" (the string \"2\")\n          Then we iterate: \n              i=0: char is '2' -> not 'A', not 'D', so tmp=0.\n          Then output 0.\n\n        So the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n   Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n   But note: the third program does a replacement of \"BC\" to 'D'. We are not doing that because we are passing a string of digits. \n   However, if we were to do the replacement, we would have to do:\n\n        We are not going to change the string because there is no \"BC\", so we skip.\n\n   But if we wanted to be generic, we could do:\n\n        We could create a new string by replacing every occurrence of \"BC\" by 'D'. But note: the string is a string of digits, so we don't have to.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do the replacement for the sake of correctness? \n\n   However, the problem says: we are to reproduce the same behavior. The third program in the chain will be given a string of digits. \n   So the replacement will do nothing.\n\n   Therefore, we skip.\n\n   We write the entire program.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious about the array bounds for the digits in the second program. We allocated an array of len1+2 and initialized to 0. That should be safe.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the second program originally uses:\n\n        int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\n        Then we have digits[number.length()] = 0? Actually, the Java array is initialized to 0.\n\n        We do the same: we set digits[i] to 0 for i beyond the string.\n\n   We'll write the program accordingly.\n\n   We assume that the integers are not too big for the second program: the first program's output is at most (N-1) which is 200000? Then the string has at most 6 digits? Then the second program will not have an array too big.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Code:\n\n        We include necessary headers.\n\n        We define MAX_N 200000\n\n        We use dynamic allocation for the string? Or we use MAX_N. We'll use MAX_N.\n\n        But note: the problem says N, so we can use the read N to allocate on the stack? But 200000 is acceptable on the stack? \n\n        However, to be safe, we can use the defined MAX_N.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            char *c1 = (char*)malloc(N+1);\n            char *c3 = (char*)malloc(N+1);\n\n        But the problem says N up to 200000, and we are using two arrays of that size, and then we have the original S. So total 3 arrays of 200000 -> 600000 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\n        But we'll do:\n\n            #define MAX_N 200000\n\n        and then:\n\n            char S[MAX_N+10];\n            char c1[MAX_N+10];\n            char c3[MAX_N+10];\n\n        Then we proceed.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let's write the entire C program."
