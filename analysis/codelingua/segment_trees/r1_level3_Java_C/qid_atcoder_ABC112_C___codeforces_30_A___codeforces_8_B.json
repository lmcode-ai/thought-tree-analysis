But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must do what the Java code does? The Java code: Math.pow(x, n) == B. But note: Math.pow returns a double. For large n, this might be infinity? or lose precision? And for x=0: 0^n = 0 if n>0, but if n==0 then 1. But note: n=ch_value is at least 1? (since h0>0, so ch_value>=1). So 0^n = 0. For x=1: 1^n = 1. For x>=2: then 2^n is astronomical for n=10^9. So it will be represented as Infinity? Then the condition Math.pow(x,n)==B would be false. Therefore, the second program would only find a solution for:\n\n                x=0: then B must be 0 -> then we have 0^n = 0 -> then we output 0 (if not neg) or 0 is nonnegative so no issue? \n\n                x=1: then 1^n=1, so B must be 1. And for x>=2, we skip because we cannot compute. So we can avoid the exponentiation for large n? We note: If n > 1000000, then we can skip the loop? Because for x>=2, 2^n is huge and will be greater than B (which is at most 100) for n>=7 (2^7=128>100). So for n>=7 and x>=2, we know it will be too big. But wait: what about x=0? and x=1? We can handle:\n\n                if (x == 0) {\n                    if (B_val == 0) -> then we found a solution? But note: 0^n = 0 for n>0. So if B_val==0, then we have a solution: 0.\n                } if (x == 1) {\n                    if (B_val == 1) -> then we have a solution: 1.\n                } For x>=2: \n                    if n is too large, then we skip. But note: n might be 1,2,..., so we cannot skip for small n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note: if x>=2 and n>=7, then 2^7=128>100 (since B_val<=100). So we can break early. However, the exponent n is the height from the first program, which is at least 1. So we can do:\n\n                if (x==0) {\n                    if (B_val == 0) then we found 0.\n                } else if (x==1) {\n                    if (B_val == 1) then we found 1.\n                } else {\n                    // x>=2\n                    if (n > 0) {\n                        // We want to know if x^n == B_val.\n                        // But B_val is at most 100.\n                        // We know that for x>=2, the smallest power is 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ... until it exceeds 100.\n                        // We can compute for exponents until the power exceeds 100? long long product = 1;\n                        int exponent = n;\n                        // But n might be huge? We can break early: if exponent>0 and product>B_val, we break. while (exponent) {\n                            if (product > B_val) break;\n                            product *= x;\n                            exponent--;\n                            if (exponent==0) break;\n                        }\n                        if (exponent==0 && product==B_val) {\n                            found = 1;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But note: the exponent n might be very large, but the loop in the exponentiation by repeated multiplication will run at most about 7 times for x>=2 (because 2^7=128>100) and then break. So it's safe. Steps for the second program:\n\n                A = cx, B = cy, n = ch_value. if (A == 0) {\n                    if (B == 0) then output = \"1\"\n                    else output = \"No solution\"\n                } else if (B % A != 0) {\n                    output = \"No solution\";\n                } else {\n                    int B_val = B / A;\n                    int neg = 0; if (B_val < 0) {\n                        neg = 1;\n                        B_val = -B_val;\n                    }\n                    if (neg && (n % 2 == 0)) {\n                        output = \"No solution\";\n                    } else {\n                        int found = 0;\n                        int solution = 0;\n                        // We try x from 0 to B_val (inclusive) but note: x might be fractional?

Then it is positive -> then it tries to solve: x such that x^n = 1? with n=-1? But note: the first program: the check function returns -1 if the center is not valid.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single C program that runs them in sequence.\n The output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n However, note that the original programs are independent and each reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n We are going to simulate the entire chain without intermediate I/O.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC112_C) reads an integer `n` and `n` triples (x, y, h). It then loops over grid (0..100, 0..100) and for each (cx, cy) it checks using the `check` function. If the check returns a positive value, it prints \"cx cy ch\".\n\n 2. The second program (codeforces_30_A) reads three integers: A, B, n. It then solves the equation A * x^n = B.\n\n 3. The third program (codeforces_8_B) reads a string of moves (L, R, U, D). It then checks if the path has a \"BUG\", meaning if there is any two points (with at least 3 moves in between) that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) then it's a BUG.\n\n How to chain:\n - The first program's output is a single line with three integers: cx, cy, ch. We are going to capture that output and use it as input to the second program? \n   But note: the second program expects three integers (A, B, n). However, the first program's output is not in the form of three integers that the second program expects.\n\n Actually, the problem states: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n However, looking at the programs, the outputs and inputs are not compatible:\n\n Program 1: outputs three integers (cx, cy, ch) for the first valid center it finds. But note: the program loops over cx and cy and prints multiple valid centers? Actually, the original program breaks after the first valid center? Let me check:\n\n The original Java program for atcoder_ABC112_C:\n   It loops over i from 0 to 100 and j from 0 to 100. For each (i, j) it calls `check`. If `check` returns a positive value, it prints (i, j, ch) and then continues? Actually, no: it does not break. So it might print multiple centers? \n\n But the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n How do we chain if the first program produces multiple outputs? And the second program expects one set of three numbers? \n\n The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" of the entire sequence.\n\n However, the original chain would have:\n\n   Program1: writes multiple lines? (each valid center) -> then Program2 would read the first line and use that as input? But Program2 expects three integers. Then Program3 would read the output of Program2.\n\n But note: the second program (codeforces_30_A) only writes one line: either \"No solution\", or a number.\n\n Then the third program reads a string.\n\n So the chain is:\n\n   Input for the entire system: \n        First: the input for Program1 (n and n triples)\n        Then: the input for Program2? But wait, the chain is: \n            Program1's output becomes input to Program2, and Program2's output becomes input to Program3.\n\n But the inputs are incompatible.\n\n After rethinking: the problem states that the entire sequence is to be executed. This implies that the output of the first program is fed as input to the second, and the output of the second to the third.\n\n However, the original programs are independent. We must design the chain such that:\n\n   Step1: Run the first program with the initial input (from stdin) and capture its entire output as a string.\n   Step2: Run the second program using the output of the first as its input, and capture its entire output.\n   Step3: Run the third program using the output of the second as its input.\n\n But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\" and without intermediate I/O.\n\n How to do:\n\n   We are going to simulate the chain by:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program (n and n triples) from stdin.\n\n        Step2: Run the logic of the first program to produce an output string (which is the first valid center it finds? or all? but note the problem says \"the same behavior\"). However, the original first program prints every valid center. But the second program expects one set of three numbers? \n\n        We have a problem: the second program expects three integers, but the first program may output multiple lines? \n\n        The problem does not specify that the chain must use the entire output of the first program as the entire input of the second. It says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n        In a typical Unix pipe, the second program would read the first line of the first program's output and then the rest would be left in the pipe? But the second program only reads three integers. So the rest of the output of the first program would be ignored? \n\n        However, the second program (codeforces_30_A) only reads three integers. So if the first program outputs:\n\n            10 20 30\n            40 50 60\n\n        Then the second program would read 10, 20, 30 and leave \"40 50 60\" unread? Then the third program would get that as input? But the third program expects a string. \n\n        This would be messy.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might intend that the entire output of the first program is the input to the second? But the second program only reads three integers. Then the rest of the output would cause an error? \n\n        Actually, in the first program, we note that it prints the first valid center it finds? Actually, the program does not break after the first valid center. It prints every center that passes the check. But the problem says: \"If the check returns a positive value, it prints\".\n\n        However, the problem statement for atcoder_ABC112_C says: \"There exists exactly one center (cx, cy) and height ch such that the conditions are satisfied.\" So there should be exactly one valid center. Therefore, the first program will output exactly one line.\n\n        So we can assume that the first program outputs one line with three integers.\n\n        Then the second program reads that one line (three integers: A, B, n). But note: the second program expects three integers: A, B, n. The first program outputs cx, cy, ch. We are going to use:\n\n            A = cx\n            B = cy\n            n = ch   ??? \n\n        But wait: the second program uses the variable `n` for the exponent. And the first program's `ch` is the height. This does not match the problem of the second program.\n\n        This indicates that the chain might be arbitrary? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the entire sequence of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". So we are not changing the meaning of the data. We are just connecting the output of one to the input of the next.\n\n        However, the second program is expecting:\n\n            A * (x)^n = B\n\n        and the first program outputs three integers (cx, cy, ch). So we are going to set:\n\n            A = cx\n            B = cy\n            n = ch\n\n        Then the second program will solve: cx * (x)^(ch) = cy.\n\n        Then the second program outputs either:\n            - \"No solution\"\n            - or a number (which might be negative)\n\n        Then the third program reads a string. The output of the second program is a string (either a number or \"No solution\"). But the third program expects a string of moves (like \"LRUD\"). \n\n        This does not make sense.\n\n        Therefore, I suspect that the chain is not intended to be connected by the content of the outputs, but rather by the order of execution? And the problem says \"the entire sequence\", meaning we run the three programs one after the other, each reading from the original stdin? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n        And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n        So the entire input is read at the beginning, and the entire output is written at the end. The intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\n        How can we do that?\n\n        We must restructure the three programs to run in sequence without writing to stdout until the last one, and without reading from stdin after the first block.\n\n        The input for the entire system is:\n\n            For the first program: \n                n\n                x1 y1 h1\n                ... \n                xn yn hn\n\n            Then, for the second program: \n                A B n   [but we are going to take these from the output of the first program?]\n\n            Then, for the third program:\n                a string   [from the output of the second program?]\n\n        But the outputs of the first and second are not in the format that the next program expects.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that the three programs are independent and we run them on the same initial input? \n\n        The problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to the entire system is the input for the first program. The output of the entire system is the output of the last program.\n\n        Therefore, we must design:\n\n            Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and n triples) from stdin.\n\n            Step 2: Run the first program's logic to produce its output (which is one or more lines). But we are not going to print it. Instead, we capture the first line of output (if any) and use that as the input for the second program? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". And the second program is designed to read three integers. So we assume the first program produces at least one line? \n\n            But note: the first program might not produce any output? Actually, the problem states there is exactly one center, so it will produce one line.\n\n            Step 3: Use the three integers from the first program's output (cx, cy, ch) as the input (A, B, n) for the second program? \n\n            Then run the second program's logic with A = cx, B = cy, n = ch.\n\n            Step 4: Capture the output of the second program (a string) and use that as the input for the third program.\n\n            Step 5: Run the third program's logic on that string to produce the final output.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n            Input to the entire system: \n                The first program's input: n, and the n triples.\n\n            Output of the entire system:\n                The third program's output: either \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\n        But note: the second program outputs either a number (which we convert to string) or \"No solution\". The third program expects a string of moves. \n\n        However, the third program expects a string of characters 'L','R','U','D'. The second program outputs either:\n\n            \"No solution\"\n\n        or a string representation of an integer (possibly negative, so it might contain a minus sign and digits). \n\n        This string is then passed to the third program. The third program will then try to interpret that string as a sequence of moves? \n\n        For example, if the second program outputs \"5\", then the third program will see the string \"5\", which is one character '5'. Then it will try to switch on that character? It will not match any of the cases (L, R, U, D). Then the path is just one step? Then it will check for adjacent points? \n\n        This is clearly not the intended meaning of the third program.\n\n        Therefore, I suspect that the chain is not as described. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended to run the three programs independently on the same input? \n\n        But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n        After careful thought, I think the problem is misinterpreting the chain. The three programs are completely independent and not designed to be chained. \n\n        However, the problem states: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n        And: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n        So we have to do as described.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n and n triples).\n\n          Step 2: Run the first program. It will compute the center (cx, cy, ch). We capture that as a string? But we are in C and we are not actually printing. We are going to store the three integers.\n\n          Step 3: Pass these three integers (cx, cy, ch) as the input to the second program. So the second program's input will be: \n                  A = cx, B = cy, n = ch.\n\n          Step 4: Run the second program. It will produce an output string. We capture that string without printing.\n\n          Step 5: Pass that string as the input to the third program.\n\n          Step 6: Run the third program on that string and capture its output (either \"OK\" or \"BUG\") and then print that at the end.\n\n        But note: the second program may output \"No solution\". Then the third program will get the string \"No solution\", which is 12 characters? The third program will then try to process each character as a move? \n\n        This is arbitrary.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". In the original chain, the second program would write \"No solution\" to stdout, and then the third program would read that string as its input. So the third program would see the string \"No solution\" and then run its logic on that.\n\n        The third program's logic:\n\n            It records a path: starting at (0,0). For each character in the string:\n\n                'L': x--\n                'R': x++\n                'U': y++\n                'D': y--\n\n            Then it checks if the path has a \"BUG\": meaning if there is any two points (with at least 3 steps apart) that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically with distance 1).\n\n            The string \"No solution\" does not contain any of these characters. So the path would be:\n\n                (0,0) -> then for each character in \"No solution\", it would do nothing (because the switch doesn't match) -> so the entire path is just the starting point? \n\n            Then k = 1 (only the starting point). Then the loop:\n\n                for (i=0; i<k-3; i++) ...   -> k-3 = -2, so the loop doesn't run -> flag remains true -> output \"OK\".\n\n        So if the second program outputs \"No solution\", then the third program outputs \"OK\".\n\n        But if the second program outputs a number, say \"123\", then the third program would process:\n\n            '1': not a move -> no change.\n            '2': not a move -> no change.\n            '3': not a move -> no change.\n\n            So again, the path is only the starting point -> \"OK\".\n\n        Alternatively, if the second program outputs a negative number, say \"-5\", then the string is \"-5\". The third program would see:\n\n            '-': not a move -> no change.\n            '5': not a move -> no change.\n\n        So always the path is only the starting point? \n\n        This does not seem useful.\n\n        Therefore, I suspect the problem intended a different chain. But the problem explicitly states the sequence of the three given Java programs.\n\n        Alternatively, the chain might be:\n\n            The input for the entire system is:\n\n                For the first program: the n and n triples.\n\n                Then, the output of the first program (cx, cy, ch) is passed to the second program as input.\n\n                Then, the output of the second program (a string) is passed to the third program as input.\n\n            And the final output is the output of the third program.\n\n        And we are to run that.\n\n        Given that, we implement:\n\n            Read the first program's input.\n\n            Run the first program to get (cx, cy, ch). Since the problem guarantees one center, we break after the first valid center? But the original program does not break. However, the problem says there is exactly one center, so we can break at the first valid center? Actually, the check function returns the same ch for every valid center? And the condition is that the center must satisfy all points. So there is only one. We can break after the first valid center? But the original program does not break. However, we are free to break because there is only one? But the problem does not say we can break. We must mimic the original program? \n\n            But note: the original program prints every valid center. However, the problem says there is exactly one. So it will print one line. We can capture that one line.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must run the entire loops? But that is inefficient. But since MAX is only 100, it's acceptable.\n\n            How do we capture the output? We are not going to print it. We are going to store the first valid center we find? But what if there are multiple? The problem says exactly one. So we can break after the first? But the original program does not break. It prints every center that is valid. But the problem says exactly one, so there will be one. We can break after the first? Or we can store all? But the second program only reads one set of three integers. So we will only use the first valid center.\n\n            Therefore, we can break after the first valid center? Or note: the original program prints in increasing order of i then j. And the first valid center we find is the first in that order. The second program will read that first line. The rest of the output of the first program would be ignored by the second program? But in our C program, we are not actually writing to stdout. We are storing the first valid center to pass to the second program.\n\n            So we will break after the first valid center? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". The original first program prints all valid centers. But the second program only reads the first one. The rest of the output would be read by the second program? But the second program only reads three integers and then exits. The rest of the output would be left unread? Then the third program would read the rest? \n\n            This is complex.\n\n            Alternatively, we can simulate the entire chain without actually writing the intermediate outputs to a buffer? But the problem says: without I/O in the middle.\n\n            We decide:\n\n                For the first program: we run the double loop. We break at the first valid center? But wait, what if there are multiple? The problem says exactly one. So we can break.\n\n            However, to be safe and mimic the original, we must run the entire double loop? But then we would have multiple centers. Then the second program would read the first center and ignore the rest. \n\n            How do we handle that? \n\n            We note: the second program uses a Scanner that reads three integers. It will read the first three integers from the input (which is the first center) and leave the rest of the output of the first program unread? \n\n            But in our C program, we are not actually going to write the intermediate data to a buffer and then parse it again? We can avoid that.\n\n            Instead, we will run the first program and capture only the first valid center? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\", so we must run the first program completely? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The behavior of the chain is:\n\n                The first program writes all valid centers (one per line) to stdout.\n\n                The second program reads the first line and parses three integers, and then ignores the rest of the output of the first program.\n\n                The third program then gets the output of the second program.\n\n            But the rest of the output of the first program is never read by the second program? So it is lost? \n\n            Therefore, we only need the first valid center for the second program.\n\n            So we can break at the first valid center? \n\n            How did the original first program work? It prints every center that passes the check. But the problem says there is exactly one center. So there will be one line.\n\n            Therefore, we can break at the first valid center.\n\n            Steps for the first program:\n\n                Read n and the n triples.\n\n                For i from 0 to 100:\n                    For j from 0 to 100:\n                        ch = check(n, x, y, h, i, j)\n                        if ch > 0, then we have a candidate (i, j, ch). We break out of both loops after the first candidate? \n\n                But note: the problem says there is exactly one center. So we break.\n\n            Then we pass (i, j, ch) to the second program.\n\n        Step 2: The second program:\n\n            Input: A = i, B = j, n = ch.\n\n            Then the second program does:\n\n                if (A == 0) {\n                    if (B == 0) then output \"1\"\n                    else output \"No solution\"\n                    return;\n                }\n                if (B % A != 0) -> output \"No solution\"\n                else {\n                    B = B / A;\n                    neg = (B<0);\n                    if (neg and n even) -> output \"No solution\"\n                    if (neg) B = -B;\n                    for (x from 0 to B) {\n                        if (x^n == B) then output (neg?-x:x) and return;\n                    }\n                    output \"No solution\"\n                }\n\n            We capture the output as a string (either the integer as a string or \"No solution\").\n\n        Step 3: The third program:\n\n            Input: the string from the second program.\n\n            We run the third program on that string.\n\n            We simulate the path:\n\n                x=0, y=0, k=0.\n                store (0,0) at co[0][0] and co[1][0] = 0, k=1.\n\n                for each char c in the string:\n                    if c is 'L': x--\n                    if c is 'R': x++\n                    if c is 'U': y++\n                    if c is 'D': y--\n                    then store (x,y) at co[0][k] = x, co[1][k] = y, k++.\n\n                Then, we check for i from 0 to k-3, and j from i+3 to k-1:\n                    dx = abs(co[0][i] - co[0][j])\n                    dy = abs(co[1][i] - co[1][j])\n                    if (dx<=1 && dy==0) or (dy<=1 && dx==0) then flag = false.\n\n                Then output \"OK\" if flag is true, else \"BUG\".\n\n        Step 4: Print the output of the third program.\n\n        But note: the third program expects moves. The output of the second program is either \"No solution\" or a string of digits (possibly with a minus). This string does not contain any of the move characters. So the entire path will be only the starting point? \n\n        Therefore, the third program will always output \"OK\", because the path has only one point? \n\n        This does not match the original third program's intended use.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain\". The original chain would do exactly that.\n\n        So we implement accordingly.\n\n        Implementation in C:\n\n            We will read the first program's input.\n\n            Then we run the first program's logic to find the center. We break at the first valid center.\n\n            Then we run the second program with A = cx, B = cy, n = ch.\n\n            Then we run the third program with the string output by the second program.\n\n            Then we write the third program's output.\n\n        Note: We assume the first program finds exactly one center.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n.\n            Allocate arrays for x, y, h of size n.\n            For i in 0..n-1: read x[i], y[i], h[i].\n\n            int cx, cy, ch_value = -1;\n            for (int i=0; i<=100; i++) {\n                for (int j=0; j<=100; j++) {\n                    int candidate = check(n, x, y, h, i, j);\n                    if (candidate > 0) {\n                        cx = i;\n                        cy = j;\n                        ch_value = candidate;\n                        goto after_loop;   // break out of both loops\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            after_loop:\n\n            If we didn't find any center? Then the first program would have printed nothing? Then the second program would read nothing? But the second program uses Scanner.nextInt() which would throw an exception? In C we would have to handle that.\n\n            But the problem guarantees there is exactly one center.\n\n            Then we run the second program with A = cx, B = cy, n = ch_value.\n\n            We have to be cautious: the second program uses the variable 'n' for the exponent, and we are using 'ch_value'. But note: the exponent must be at least 1? The first program's ch_value is the height, which is at least 1? Because h[i] are nonnegative and at least one is positive? So ch_value is positive.\n\n            The second program:\n\n                if (cx == 0) {\n                    if (cy == 0) then output = \"1\"\n                    else output = \"No solution\"\n                } else if (cy % cx != 0) {\n                    output = \"No solution\";\n                } else {\n                    int B_val = cy / cx;\n                    int neg = 0;\n                    if (B_val < 0) {\n                        neg = 1;\n                        B_val = -B_val;\n                    }\n                    if (neg && (ch_value % 2 == 0)) {\n                        output = \"No solution\";\n                    } else {\n                        // We try x from 0 to B_val (inclusive) such that x^ch_value == B_val.\n                        int found = 0;\n                        int x_val;\n                        for (x_val = 0; x_val <= B_val; x_val++) {\n                            // Compute power: x_val raised to ch_value\n                            long long power = 1;\n                            int exp = ch_value;\n                            int base = x_val;\n                            // We can break early if power exceeds B_val?\n                            while (exp) {\n                                if (exp & 1) power *= base;\n                                base *= base;\n                                exp /= 2;\n                                // But note: base might overflow? But B_val <= 10000? Because cy <= 100, cx>=1 -> cy/cx <= 100. And ch_value is at least 1? So the exponent is at most 100? Then x_val is at most 100 (because B_val<=100). So we can do:\n\n                                // Alternatively, we can use pow from math? But we are in integers and we want exact. We can do a loop for exponentiation.\n\n                                // Actually, we can do a simple loop for exponentiation for the exponent ch_value? But ch_value might be large? The height? The height in the first program: h[i] can be up to 10^9? But then we are exponentiating x_val to the power of ch_value? That would be astronomical.\n\n                            This is a problem.\n\n                            Actually, the second program's original Java code:\n\n                                for (int x = 0; x <= B; x++) {\n                                    if (Math.pow(x, n) == B) ... \n\n                            But note: B is at most 100 (because cy is at most 100 and cx is at least 1, so B_val=cy/cx <=100). And n is the height from the first program? Which is the computed height = |x_i - cx| + |y_i - cy| + h[i]. And h[i] can be up to 10^9? \n\n                            Then n (the exponent) is about 10^9? Then the loop for x from 0 to B_val (which is 100) and then raising x to the power of 10^9? That is impossible.\n\n            Therefore, we must reconsider: \n\n            The first program's `ch_value` is the height at the center, which is computed as:\n\n                ch_value = |x0 - cx| + |y0 - cy| + h0   [for the first point with h0>0]\n\n            And h0 can be up to 10^9? So ch_value can be 10^9? \n\n            Then the second program will try to compute x^(10^9) for x from 0 to 100? That is not feasible.\n\n            This indicates that the chain is not practical? \n\n            But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So we must do what the Java code does? \n\n            The Java code: Math.pow(x, n) == B. But note: Math.pow returns a double. For large n, this might be infinity? or lose precision? \n\n            And for x=0: 0^n = 0 if n>0, but if n==0 then 1. But note: n=ch_value is at least 1? (since h0>0, so ch_value>=1). So 0^n = 0.\n\n            For x=1: 1^n = 1.\n\n            For x>=2: then 2^n is astronomical for n=10^9. So it will be represented as Infinity? Then the condition Math.pow(x,n)==B would be false.\n\n            Therefore, the second program would only find a solution for:\n\n                x=0: then B must be 0 -> then we have 0^n = 0 -> then we output 0 (if not neg) or 0 is nonnegative so no issue? \n\n                x=1: then 1^n=1, so B must be 1.\n\n            And for x>=2, we skip because we cannot compute.\n\n            So we can avoid the exponentiation for large n? We note:\n\n                If n > 1000000, then we can skip the loop? Because for x>=2, 2^n is huge and will be greater than B (which is at most 100) for n>=7 (2^7=128>100). So for n>=7 and x>=2, we know it will be too big.\n\n            But wait: what about x=0? and x=1? \n\n            We can handle:\n\n                if (x == 0) {\n                    if (B_val == 0) -> then we found a solution? But note: 0^n = 0 for n>0. So if B_val==0, then we have a solution: 0.\n                }\n                if (x == 1) {\n                    if (B_val == 1) -> then we have a solution: 1.\n                }\n                For x>=2: \n                    if n is too large, then we skip.\n\n            But note: n might be 1,2,..., so we cannot skip for small n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note: if x>=2 and n>=7, then 2^7=128>100 (since B_val<=100). So we can break early.\n\n            However, the exponent n is the height from the first program, which is at least 1. So we can do:\n\n                if (x==0) {\n                    if (B_val == 0) then we found 0.\n                } else if (x==1) {\n                    if (B_val == 1) then we found 1.\n                } else {\n                    // x>=2\n                    if (n > 0) {\n                        // We want to know if x^n == B_val.\n                        // But B_val is at most 100.\n                        // We know that for x>=2, the smallest power is 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ... until it exceeds 100.\n                        // We can compute for exponents until the power exceeds 100? \n                        long long product = 1;\n                        int exponent = n;\n                        // But n might be huge? We can break early: if exponent>0 and product>B_val, we break.\n                        while (exponent) {\n                            if (product > B_val) break;\n                            product *= x;\n                            exponent--;\n                            if (exponent==0) break;\n                        }\n                        if (exponent==0 && product==B_val) {\n                            found = 1;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n            But note: the exponent n might be very large, but the loop in the exponentiation by repeated multiplication will run at most about 7 times for x>=2 (because 2^7=128>100) and then break. So it's safe.\n\n            Steps for the second program:\n\n                A = cx, B = cy, n = ch_value.\n\n                if (A == 0) {\n                    if (B == 0) then output = \"1\"\n                    else output = \"No solution\"\n                } else if (B % A != 0) {\n                    output = \"No solution\";\n                } else {\n                    int B_val = B / A;\n                    int neg = 0;\n                    if (B_val < 0) {\n                        neg = 1;\n                        B_val = -B_val;\n                    }\n                    if (neg && (n % 2 == 0)) {\n                        output = \"No solution\";\n                    } else {\n                        int found = 0;\n                        int solution = 0;\n                        // We try x from 0 to B_val (inclusive) but note: x might be fractional?

(the original program ignores non-move characters)\n\n                    store the new position: co_x[k]=x, co_y[k]=y; k++;\n\n                Then, check for i from 0 to k-3:\n                    for j from i+3 to k-1:\n                        dx = abs(co_x[i]-co_x[j])\n                        dy = abs(co_y[i]-co_y[j])\n                        if (dx<=1 && dy==0) || (dy<=1 && dx==0) -> then we have a bug.\n\n                If we found any such (i,j), then output \"BUG\", else \"OK\".\n\n        Step 4: Print the output.\n\n        We must be cautious: the third program uses an array of size 101 for the coordinates. The string from the second program is at most 20 characters? So k is at most 20? Then the loop: i from 0 to k-3 (which is 17) and j from i+3 to 19 -> acceptable.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                int co_x[200], co_y[200];   // we allocate more than 101 to be safe.\n\n                int x=0, y=0, k=0;\n                co_x[k] = x; co_y[k] = y; k++;\n\n                for (int i=0; s[i]!='\\0'; i++) {\n                    char c = s[i];\n                    if (c=='L') x--;\n                    else if (c=='R') x++;\n                    else if (c=='U') y++;\n                    else if (c=='D') y--;\n                    // else: no change\n\n                    co_x[k] = x;\n                    co_y[k] = y;\n                    k++;\n                }\n\n                int flag = 1;\n                for (int i=0; i<k-3; i++) {\n                    for (int j=i+3; j<k; j++) {\n                        int dx = co_x[i] - co_x[j];\n                        int dy = co_y[i] - co_y[j];\n                        if (dx<0) dx = -dx;\n                        if (dy<0) dy = -dy;\n                        if ( (dx<=1 && dy==0) || (dy<=1 && dx==0) ) {\n                            flag = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (!flag) break;\n                }\n\n                if (flag) {\n                    printf(\"OK\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"BUG\\n\");\n                }\n\n        But note: the original third program breaks after the first occurrence.\n\n        However, we see a problem: the third program might have the same coordinate appearing multiple times? But the problem says that the path might self-intersect? But the check is for adjacent points (with at least 3 moves apart). \n\n        But note: the original third program does not check consecutive points? Because j starts at i+3. So adjacent consecutive moves are allowed? \n\n        We are good.\n\n        Now, we put it all together.\n\n        Steps in the C program:\n\n            // Step 1: Read input for the first program.\n            int n;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            int x[100], y[100], h[100];   // n<=100, so 100 is safe.\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &x[i], &y[i], &h[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: Run the first program to find the center.\n            int cx = -1, cy = -1, ch_value = -1;\n            for (int i=0; i<=100; i++) {\n                for (int j=0; j<=100; j++) {\n                    int candidate = check(n, x, y, h, i, j);   // we have to define check\n                    if (candidate > 0) {\n                        cx = i;\n                        cy = j;\n                        ch_value = candidate;\n                        goto after_loop;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            after_loop:\n\n            // If no center found?

i<n; i++) {\n                    if (h[i] > 0) {\n                        ch = abs(x[i]-cx) + abs(y[i]-cy) + h[i];\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                // If no positive h[i] found? then we return -1? But the problem says at least one has h[i]>0? \n                // Then, check every point i.\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    int expected = ch - abs(x[i]-cx) - abs(y[i]-cy);\n                    if (expected < 0) expected = 0;\n                    if (h[i] != expected) {\n                        return -1;\n                    }\n                }\n                return ch;\n            }\n\n        Note: We need to include headers.\n\n        Let's write the entire C program.\n\n        We include:\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n            #include <math.h>\n\n        But note: we don't use math.h? We can remove.\n\n        We'll write the check function.\n\n        Note: abs is in stdlib.h? Actually, we can use abs from stdlib.h? Or we can define our own?\n\n        We'll use abs: we include <stdlib.h> for abs.\n\n        However, abs is also in <math.h>? Actually, in C, abs is in <stdlib.h> for integers.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Important: We assume the input is as described.\n\n        We note: the second program's buffer for the string is 20, which is enough for an integer.\n\n        We'll write the entire code.\n\n        There is one more issue: the first program might not find any center? Then we break with cx=-1, etc. Then the second program runs with A=-1, which is non-zero -> then it checks if B % A != 0 -> which is -1 % -1? That is 0? So then it sets B_val = (-1)/(-1)=1? Then it is positive -> then it tries to solve: x such that x^n = 1? with n=-1? \n\n        But note: the first program: the check function returns -1 if the center is not valid. And we break at the first candidate that returns positive. So if we break the loop without finding any candidate, then we have ch_value=-1. Then the second program will run with n=-1.\n\n        But the problem guarantees one center.\n\n        We'll assume we always find a center.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        We'll write the entire C program.\n\n        Note: We are using goto to break the nested loops. Alternatively, we can use a flag and break the inner loop and then break the outer.\n\n        We'll use goto for simplicity.\n\n        We'll write the check function first.\n\n        Here is the complete C code:"
