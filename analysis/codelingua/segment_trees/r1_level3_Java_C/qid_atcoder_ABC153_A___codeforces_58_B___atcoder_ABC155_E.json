We allocated only len+2. But note: the number we started with is the string of num, which is a positive integer. The maximum value of the extra digit (at index len) after any carry is 1? And then at index len+1, we set it to 0 initially and then if we get a carry at index len, we set digits[len+1] to 1. Then when i=len+1, we would have to process? But our loop only goes to i<=len. So we miss the digit at len+1. The original program iterates to i<=number.length() (which is len) so it doesn't process beyond index len? But note: the array is of size len+1 (in the original: digits = new int[number.length()+1] -> indices 0..len). Then the loop goes i from 0 to len (inclusive). So it does process index len. Then if at index len we have 10, we set digits[len+1]++ and then set digits[len]=0. But then the loop does not process index len+1? Therefore, the original program might have a carry beyond the allocated array? Actually, the array is of size len+1, so the valid indices are 0..len. Then when i=len, we access digits[len+1] which is out of bounds? Let me check the original:\n\n        int [] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];   // indices: 0 to number.length() (inclusive) -> that's number.length()+1 elements.\n\n        for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {   // i from 0 to number.length() (which is the last index of the array? no: the array has indices 0..number.length() (which is the index of the last element) -> but note: the array has size number.length()+1, so the last index is number.length(). Then in the loop, when i = number.length(), we do:\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i+1]++;   // here, i+1 = number.length()+1 -> which is beyond the array. This is an array index out of bounds. But wait: the array is of size number.length()+1 -> the indices are 0 to number.length(). So digits[number.length()] is the last element. Then digits[i+1] when i=number.length() is beyond. How did the original Java program run without an error? The initial array: \n            digits[number.length()] = 0? Then we process i=0,1,...,number.length()-1: then at i=number.length()-1: we might set digits[number.length()] to 1? Then at i=number.length(), we have digits[i] which is the last element (index number.length()). If it is 10? Then we try to set digits[number.length()+1] which is beyond. But the array was allocated with size number.length()+1, so the last valid index is number.length(). Therefore, the original program has a bug? However, note: the array is of size number.length()+1 -> indices 0 to number.length(). The loop runs i from 0 to number.length() (so the last iteration i=number.length()). Then we access digits[i+1] which is index number.length()+1 -> which is out of bounds. This must be fixed? But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. We are to reproduce the same behavior. The same behavior might be an array out of bounds? Alternatively, the original problem might not have been tested?",

Actually, it's better to carry? The algorithm does: if the next digit is >=5, then we increment the next digit (so we are effectively borrowing) and then use the 5? Why? Actually, the algorithm is minimizing the number of bills. The bills are of denominations 1 and 10^k, 5*10^k, 10*10^k. Example: 5 in the current digit: we can use one 5-bill. But if the next digit is >=5, then we can do: use a 10-bill in the next higher denomination and then get 5 back?

The solution: dynamic programming or greedy. The algorithm here is greedy from the least significant digit. However, the array out of bounds is a real issue. How to fix? We allocated the array to be one larger? Actually, we allocated len+2. Then in the loop, we go to i<=len (which is the last index we allocated: index len+1? no, we allocated indices 0..len+1 -> that's len+2 elements). Then when i=len, we set digits[i+1] (which is index len+1) which is within the allocation? In our C code: we allocated len+2 elements -> indices 0 to len+1. Then the loop runs for i from 0 to len (inclusive). Then when i=len, we set digits[i+1] -> index len+1 -> which is the last element? But note: the original Java program does not have that allocation. It only allocated len+1. So we are being safe. However, we are translating, so we can fix the array size to be len+2 to avoid the out of bounds.",

Then the carry beyond the last digit (which is the most significant) is unlikely? Actually, the algorithm: We start with a number (num) and then we process each digit. The maximum carry: the most significant digit might be 9, then we add 1 -> becomes 10, then we set it to 0 and carry to the next. Then we have a new digit 1. Then we process that new digit?

But to be safe, we can change the loop to run until the entire array including the last allocated digit? Actually, we allocated len+2, so we can run the loop for i from 0 to len+1? Then we set:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len+1; i++) But then we need to initialize digits for indices beyond len to 0? We did calloc, so they are 0. Then we process i=len+1: which is 0 -> bills+=0. So it's safe. Therefore, we change the loop to go to i<=len+1. But the original program only goes to i<=len. Why? Because the array size was len+1? We are translating the entire sequence, but we are fixing an array out of bounds? Alternatively, we can run the loop until the highest digit that is non-zero? Given the time, we will run the loop to len+1. Steps for the third program in C:\n\n            Allocate digits for len+2 (indices 0 to len+1) -> calloc sets to 0. Convert the number to reversed digits: for i in [0, len-1]: digits[i] = s[len-1-i]-'0'\n            Then set the rest (from len to len+1) to 0? calloc already did. Then for i from 0 to len+1 (inclusive) do the algorithm. This should be safe. Therefore, the final C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int h, a;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &a);\n\n            // Compute num (number of times we can subtract a from h until h<=0)\n            int num = 0;\n            while (h > 0) { h -= a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n            // Convert num to a string\n            char s[20];\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", num);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            // Allocate and initialize the digits array (with zeros) for len+2 elements\n            int *digits = (int *)calloc(len+2, sizeof(int));\n            // Convert the string to reversed digits (least significant at index0)\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = s[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n            long long bills = 0; // use long long to avoid overflow? The original used int, but the number of bills might be large? But our num is not huge. // We'll iterate from i=0 to i=len+1 (inclusive)\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len+1; i++) {\n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                } if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (i+1 <= len+1) { // we can check i+1 is within our allocated array? We allocated len+2, so i+1 is up to len+2? But we only go to i=len+1, so i+1=len+2 is beyond? We should avoid accessing beyond.\n                        // Actually, we are iterating i only up to len+1, so i+1 is at most len+2 -> but we allocated only len+2 elements (indices 0..len+1). So digits[i+1] when i=len+1 is beyond.\n                        // Therefore, we need to check i+1 < (len+2) -> i+1 <= len+1? i<=len?\n                        // But note: we allocated for indices 0..len+1 -> so the last valid index is len+1. Then when i=len+1, we access digits[i+1] which is len+2 -> out of bounds.\n                        // We must avoid that.\n                        // Instead, we can only check the next digit if i+1 is within the allocated array. Since our loop goes to i=len+1, then i+1 would be len+2 -> beyond. // We should break the array bounds. // How about: we allocated len+2 elements, so the valid indices are 0 to len+1. Then we can only check if i+1 < (len+2) -> i < len+1. if (i < len+1 && digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                            digits[i+1]++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    if (i < len+1) { // to avoid writing beyond the array\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                }\n            }\n\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", bills);\n            free(digits);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the condition for the 5 branch: we only check the next digit if we are not at the last element? And similarly for the >=6 branch, we only increment the next digit if we are not at the last element. This should avoid array out of bounds. However, what if at i=len+1, we have a digit that is 10? Then we do:\n\n        digits[i+1]++ -> which is beyond the array? But we are at i=len+1, which is the last index we allocated? We allocated indices 0..len+1. Then i+1 = len+2 -> beyond. We must not allow that. Therefore, we should break the array bounds only for i < len+1 in the 10 branch? Actually, the 10 branch comes first. We do:\n\n        if (digits[i] == 10) {\n            if (i < len+1) { // we need to check?\n                digits[i+1]++;\n            } else {\n                // then we have a carry beyond the array? We cannot represent it.\n                // But then we have an error? \n            }\n            digits[i] = 0;\n        } But the problem: the original program didn't account for that. We are translating and we want to avoid crashing. Alternatively, we can allocate one more digit? We allocated len+2 -> indices 0..len+1. Then we run the loop to i<=len+1. Then when i=len+1, we might set digits[len+2]? But we didn't allocate that. So we need to allocate len+3? Then run the loop to len+2?",

Test with num=10:\n\n        s=\"10\", len=2. digits[0] = 0, digits[1] = 1, then the rest 0.\n        n=2+3=5.\n        i=0: \n            digits[0]=0 -> bills +=0. i=1:\n            digits[1]=1 -> <5 -> bills +=1 -> total=1.

We can use one 10-bill and get 1 back -> then we have to use 1 one-bill to return? But we are the payer, we want to pay 9. Alternatively, we can use 9 one-bills -> 9 bills.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single C program.\n The first program (atcoder_ABC153_A) reads two integers (h and a) and calculates the number of times we can subtract 'a' from 'h' until h<=0.\n The second program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer n and then prints a sequence of numbers: starting from n, then the next number is the largest divisor of the current number that is less than the current number, until 1.\n The third program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string of digits (a big number) and calculates the minimum number of bills (using a greedy method with coin change, similar to paying with minimal bills and getting change).\n\n However, note that the original chain uses the output of the first program as the input to the second, and the output of the second as the input to the third.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n\n Program 1: Input is two integers (h and a). Output is one integer (num).\n\n Program 2: Input is one integer (n). It then prints a sequence of numbers (each followed by a space) on separate lines. The first number is n, then the next numbers are divisors.\n\n Program 3: Input is a string (a big number). It then processes the string and outputs an integer (bills).\n\n How the chain works:\n\n Step 1: The first program outputs an integer (num). This becomes the input to the second program.\n\n Step 2: The second program reads that integer (n = num) and then outputs a sequence of numbers. However, note that the second program outputs multiple numbers (each on a new line) and the last number is 1.\n\n Step 3: The third program expects a string. But the second program outputs multiple integers. This mismatch indicates that the chain might be broken.\n\n However, let's reexamine the problem statement: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n For the chain to work, the output of the first program (an integer) is the entire input to the second program. The second program then produces output that is the entire input to the third.\n\n But the second program produces multiple integers. The third program expects a string. How to resolve?\n\n We must note: the problem says to reproduce the same behavior as the chain. So we have to simulate:\n\n Input to the entire chain: the input to the first program (two integers: h and a)\n\n Step 1: Run the first program: reads h and a, outputs an integer (num). This num is the input to the second program.\n\n Step 2: The second program is run with the input being the string representation of num. It then outputs a sequence of numbers. For example, if num is 10, the output is:\n    10 \n    5 \n    1 \n (each on a new line, with a space after each? Actually, the program prints: \"10 \" then newline? Actually, the program does:\n    System.out.println(n + \" \");   // prints n and a space, then newline?\n    then for each divisor found: System.out.println(i + \" \");   // prints i and a space, then newline.\n\n So the entire output of the second program is a string that looks like (for n=10):\n    \"10 \\n5 \\n1 \\n\"\n\n Step 3: The third program reads a string. It uses sc.next() which reads the next token (so it will read the first token of the second program's output? But the second program's output has multiple tokens and newlines).\n\n However, note that the third program does:\n        String number = sc.next();\n\n This reads the next token (by default, until whitespace). So it will read the first token of the input? But the input to the third program is the entire output of the second program. The second program's output has multiple numbers. The scanner by default uses whitespace as delimiter, so sc.next() will read the first token (the first number) and ignore the rest? That doesn't match the chain.\n\n Actually, the chain is broken because the second program outputs multiple numbers and the third program only reads one token (the first number). So the chain as described might not be intended? Or we are misinterpreting.\n\n Let me look at the original problem: we are to translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the entire output of the first program is the input to the second, and the entire output of the second is the input to the third.\n\n However, the second program writes multiple integers (each on a new line). The third program reads only the first token? That would be the first integer.\n\n This is inconsistent. Therefore, we must reconsider the intended chain.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be that the chain is not as described? But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n How the chain is actually run:\n\n Example input for the first program: \"10 3\"\n\n First program: \n   h=10, a=3 -> subtract 3 four times: 10,7,4,1 -> then 1-3 = -2 -> stops. So num=4.\n\n Then the second program is run with input \"4\". It outputs:\n   4 \n   2 \n   1 \n\n Then the third program is run with input \"4\\n2\\n1\\n\". The third program uses sc.next() which will read the first token: \"4\".\n\n So the third program only uses the first token? That means it processes the number 4.\n\n However, the third program is designed to process a string of digits (like a big number) and then calculate the minimal bills. But 4 is a small number.\n\n So the chain is:\n\n First program: input \"10 3\" -> output \"4\" (without quotes, and note: the first program prints just the integer and then a newline? Actually, it uses System.out.println(num); -> so \"4\\n\")\n\n Second program: input \"4\\n\" -> output \"4 \\n2 \\n1 \\n\" (with spaces and newlines)\n\n Third program: input \"4 \\n2 \\n1 \\n\" -> reads the first token \"4\", and then processes the string \"4\" (which is one digit). Then it outputs the result for the number 4.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain for input \"10 3\" would output the result of the third program for the number 4.\n\n How does the third program work for the number 4?\n\n Let me simulate the third program for the string \"4\":\n\n   digits = new int[2] (because length of \"4\" is 1, so array of size 2: index0 and index1)\n   digits[0] = 4 (since we reverse: but for one digit, reversing doesn't matter)\n   digits[1] = 0? (uninitialized? Actually, the array is of length 2, and we set for i=0: digit[0] = '4' -> 4)\n\n   Then we iterate i from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n\n   i=0:\n        digits[0] = 4 -> less than 5 -> bills += 4 -> bills=4.\n   i=1:\n        digits[1] is 0? Actually, we did not set digits[1] (but the array was allocated with zeros). So:\n        digits[1] = 0 -> then we check: 0<5 -> bills +=0 -> still 4.\n\n   Then output 4.\n\n So the entire chain outputs 4.\n\n But note: the first program outputs 4, the second program outputs 4,2,1, and the third program outputs 4. So the entire chain output is 4.\n\n However, if we run the first program alone on \"10 3\", we get 4. Then if we run the second program on 4, we get:\n     4 \n     2 \n     1 \n Then if we run the third program on that output, we get 4.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain output is 4.\n\n But wait: the third program is designed for a big number? It has logic for carrying over (like when a digit is 5 or more, it increments the next digit and adds 10 - digit). However, for a single-digit number, the logic is straightforward.\n\n How do we combine?\n\n We are to write a single C program that:\n\n   - Only the first block reads input (so we read the initial h and a).\n   - Then we compute the first program's result (num) without I/O.\n   - Then we use that num to simulate the second program, but without I/O: we need to produce the sequence of divisors and then pass the entire output string of the second program to the third program? But the third program only uses the first token (the first number) of that string.\n\n Alternatively, note that the second program's output is a sequence of numbers starting with the input number (which is num from the first program) and then decreasing divisors. The third program only uses the first number of that sequence, which is exactly num. So we can skip generating the entire divisor sequence and just use num as the input to the third program? \n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The same behavior would be that the third program is fed the entire output of the second. But if the third program only reads the first token, then we can feed it the token \"num\" and ignore the rest? \n\n But the problem does not allow us to change the logic arbitrarily. We must simulate the entire chain.\n\n However, we can avoid generating the entire divisor string if we realize that the third program only uses the first token. But note: what if the second program's output has multiple tokens and the third program uses only the first? Then we can avoid generating the entire divisor sequence? But the problem says \"without I/O\" for intermediate steps. We are allowed to process without I/O, so we can simulate the second program and only store the first token (which is the same as the input to the second program, i.e., num) and then use that for the third program? \n\n However, the third program expects a string. The string it gets is the entire output of the second program. But the third program uses a Scanner which by default uses whitespace delimiters. The first token in that output is the string representation of num. The rest of the output is irrelevant for the third program? \n\n Therefore, we can note: the third program only uses the first token. So we can take the output of the first program (the integer num) and convert that to a string and then use that as the input to the third program? \n\n But wait: what if the second program's output is more than one token and the third program uses multiple tokens? It doesn't: the third program only uses the first token. \n\n However, to be safe, we must simulate the entire chain exactly. But generating the entire divisor sequence and then passing the entire string to the third program is expensive in memory (if num is very large, the divisor sequence could be long). But the problem does not specify constraints. \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid building the entire string for the second program's output if we can simulate the third program to only take the first token. But the third program is fixed: it reads the next token. So we can feed it the token (the string of num) and then nothing else? But the third program expects a single token? Actually, it uses sc.next() which reads one token. So we can just pass the string of num.\n\n How was the second program's output used? It was written to stdout and then read by the third program. The third program only reads the first token. So we can skip the rest.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Read h and a (as the first program does).\n   Step 2: Compute num (as the first program does).\n   Step 3: We now want to simulate the second program: it takes an integer n (which is num) and then produces a string that is the entire output. But we don't need the entire string for the third program? Only the first token. And the first token is the string representation of n (which is num). So we can just take the string of num and use that as the input to the third program.\n\n   But note: the second program does:\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");   // This is the first line: n and a space, then a newline.\n        then for each divisor, it does: System.out.println(i + \" \");   // which is i and a space and then a newline.\n\n   The third program does:\n        sc.next()   // This reads the next token. The first token in the second program's output is the string of n.\n\n   So the third program will get the token n (as a string) and then the rest of the tokens (the divisors) are left unread? But the third program doesn't read them.\n\n   Therefore, we can avoid building the entire divisor sequence and the entire output string of the second program, because the third program only uses the first token.\n\n   So the entire chain is equivalent to:\n\n        Read h and a.\n        Compute num = ceil(h/a) ??? Actually, the first program does a while loop: subtract a until h<=0. It's equivalent to: num = (h + a - 1) / a;   (if h and a are positive).\n\n        Then, the third program is run on the string of num.\n\n   But wait: what if the second program had side effects? It doesn't. So we can skip the second program's divisor generation and just use the string of num for the third program.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". If we skip the second program, then it's not the same. But note: the second program's output to stdout is not used by the third program beyond the first token. So we can skip generating the rest? \n\n   But the problem does not allow I/O in the middle, so we are going to simulate without printing. However, we don't need to simulate the entire divisor sequence if we know that the third program only uses the first token.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read h and a.\n        Step 2: Compute num = (h + a - 1) / a;   (if h is positive, and a positive). But note: the first program uses integer arithmetic and a loop. We can do the same.\n\n        Step 3: We set the input string for the third program to be the string representation of num.\n\n        Step 4: Run the third program on that string.\n\n   However, the third program expects a string of digits (which may be a big number). But num is an integer, so we can convert it to a string.\n\n   But note: the third program reverses the string? \n\n        for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n            digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n        }\n\n   So it reverses the digits. But if we have a small number (like 4), then it's the same.\n\n   How does the third program work? It processes the digits from least significant to most? Actually, it reverses the string and then processes from index0 (least significant) to the most significant.\n\n   We can simulate the third program on the string of num.\n\n   However, note: the original second program outputs the entire divisor sequence. The third program only uses the first token, which is the string of num. So we can skip the second program's divisor generation.\n\n   But what if the second program's output had a different representation for the number? For example, what if the second program output the number with leading zeros? It doesn't. It outputs the integer as is.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the second program entirely? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". But we are allowed to avoid I/O in the middle. We are going to simulate the entire chain without I/O. We are going to compute:\n\n        num = (h + a - 1) / a   (if h>0) or by a loop.\n\n        Then, we form a string from num (without generating the divisor sequence) and then run the third program's logic on that string.\n\n   This would be equivalent.\n\n   But note: the third program expects an array of digits of the number. We are going to form the string from num and then reverse the digits? Actually, the third program reverses the string to get the least significant digit first. We can do the same.\n\n   Steps for the third program:\n\n        Convert the integer num to a string (without any extra spaces or newlines). Let that string be s.\n        Then, we create an array of integers for the digits, but in reverse order? Actually, the third program does:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n            }\n\n        So we can avoid building the entire string and then reversing by processing the digits from the least significant to the most.\n\n        Alternatively, we can convert the integer to a string and then reverse the string? But note: the third program also allocates an array of length (number.length()+1). We have to account for the extra digit (for carry).\n\n        We can do:\n\n            char s[20]; // enough for an integer\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", num);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            Then create an array of integers of length len+1, and set:\n                for (i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                    digits[i] = s[len-1-i] - '0';\n                }\n                digits[len] = 0; // for the next digit (which might be used for carry)\n\n        Then run the same logic as the third program.\n\n   But note: the third program also has an extra digit at the end (digits[number.length()]) which is initially 0? Then it iterates from i=0 to i<=number.length(). So we have to set the digit at len to 0.\n\n   However, what if the carry propagates beyond the last digit? The third program's array has one extra position (digits of length number.length()+1). So we set the last digit (at index len) to 0, and then we iterate from 0 to len (inclusive). That is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read h and a (two integers).\n        Step 2: Compute num (using a loop: subtract a until h<=0, counting the number of subtractions).\n        Step 3: Convert num to a string s.\n        Step 4: Process the string s as in the third program (with the same algorithm) to compute the bills.\n        Step 5: Print the bills.\n\n   But wait: the second program is completely skipped? What about the divisor sequence? The third program only uses the first token of the second program's output, which is the string of num. So we are effectively simulating:\n\n        First program: computes num.\n        Then we skip the second program's divisor generation because the third program doesn't use it.\n\n   This is acceptable because the third program does not read the entire output of the second program. It only reads the first token.\n\n   However, what if the second program had an error? Or what if the second program did not output the first token as the string of num? It does: it outputs n (which is num) as the first token.\n\n   Therefore, we can skip the divisor generation.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\". We are including the logic of the second program? We are not. We are skipping the divisor generation because it's unnecessary.\n\n   Alternatively, we can generate the entire divisor sequence and then take the first token? But that would be inefficient and we are not allowed to output in the middle.\n\n   We are to avoid I/O in the middle. We are allowed to process without I/O. So we can generate the divisor sequence in memory and then form the entire output string of the second program? Then pass that entire string to the third program? Then the third program would read the first token. But that would be inefficient in memory and time.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the constraints, we can do it either way. But note: the divisor sequence for an integer n has at most O(sqrt(n)) elements? Actually, the divisors in the second program are consecutive divisors: it starts at n and then the next divisor is the largest divisor less than the current that divides the current. For example, 10 -> 5 -> 1. The sequence is the chain of divisors by dividing by the smallest prime factor? Actually, it's the chain of divisors by the next divisor being the largest divisor less than the current that divides the current. The length is the number of divisors? Actually, it's the chain: n, n/d1, n/(d1*d2), ... until 1. The length is the number of distinct prime factors? Actually, it can be the number of divisors? For 10: 10,5,1 -> 3. For 100: 100,50,25,5,1 -> 5.\n\n   The maximum length is the exponent of the prime factors? It can be up to O(log n). So it's manageable.\n\n   However, the problem says: we are to reproduce the same behavior. We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Read h and a -> compute num.\n\n        Step 2: Simulate the second program without printing: generate the entire divisor sequence and form the output string (as a string in memory). The output string would be:\n\n            [num] [space] [newline] then for each divisor: [divisor] [space] [newline] ... \n\n        Step 3: Then, use that entire string as the input to the third program. But the third program uses a Scanner that by default uses whitespace as delimiter. The first token in that string is the string representation of num.\n\n        So we can extract the first token from the divisor sequence string? Actually, the first token is the first number in the string. We can parse the string until the first space or newline? But the third program does that automatically.\n\n        However, we are writing a single C program and we are not allowed to use I/O in the middle. So we have to simulate the third program's reading from the string we built.\n\n        How the third program reads: it uses sc.next(), which is the first token. In C, we can simulate by reading the first token from the divisor output string.\n\n        But note: the divisor output string is built by us. We know that the first token is the string of num. So we don't need to parse the entire divisor output string to get the first token: we already have num as an integer and we can convert it to a string.\n\n        Therefore, we are back to the simpler solution: skip building the divisor sequence and use the string of num for the third program.\n\n   Given that the problem does not specify the constraints and we are to avoid I/O, we choose the efficient way.\n\n   But to be faithful to the original chain, we note that the third program is fed the entire output of the second program, but it only uses the first token. Therefore, we can simulate the third program by feeding it the string of num (ignoring the rest of the divisor sequence) because the rest does not affect the third program.\n\n   Therefore, the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read h and a (like the first program)\n            int h, a;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &a);\n\n            // Step 2: Compute num (as in the first program)\n            int num = 0;\n            while (h > 0) {\n                h -= a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n            // Now, we skip the second program's divisor generation because the third program only uses the first token of its output, which is the string of num.\n\n            // Step 3: Convert num to a string (we'll use a buffer)\n            char s[20]; // 20 characters is enough for an integer\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", num);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            // Now, we simulate the third program: which expects a string (the entire output of the second program) but we are going to use only the first token, which is s.\n            // We'll create an array of digits, reversed, and with an extra digit at the end (for carry).\n\n            // Allocate an array of integers of size len+2 (to be safe). We need indices 0..len (so len+1) and one extra for safety?\n            int *digits = (int*) calloc(len+2, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n            // Convert the string to reversed digits: least significant at index0.\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = s[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n            // Now, run the third program's logic.\n            // Note: the original program has an array of size (number.length()+1) -> so our array has len+1? Actually, we allocated len+2, and we set the first len digits and the rest are 0.\n            long long bills = 0; // the original uses long, but the number of bills might be large? The original has: final long INF = (long)1e15; -> so we use long long to be safe.\n            // But the problem: the original uses 'bills' as an integer? Actually, it's an int? Let me check: in the third program, 'bills' is an int? \n            // In the third program: \n            //     int bills = 0;\n            //     ... \n            //     bills += ... \n            // But note: the number can be up to 10^15? The string can be up to 1e6 digits? Actually, the problem says the number can be big. But our num is at most h/a (and h and a are integers, so num is at most 10^5 or 10^6?).\n\n            // However, the third program in the chain is run on the string of num (which is the output of the first program, so an integer). Therefore, the string length is at most 20.\n\n            // We iterate i from 0 to len (inclusive) because the original goes to number.length() (which is len) and then the next digit (at index len) is the carry that we set to 0 initially, but might be incremented.\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n                // The original Java code:\n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                }\n                if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (i+1 <= len+1) { // we have digits[i+1] because we allocated up to len+1 (index len) and then one more (index len+1) for safety?\n                        if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                            digits[i+1]++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    if (i+1 <= len+1) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step 5: Output the bills (as the last output)\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", bills);\n\n            free(digits);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the third program uses an array of length (number.length()+1). We set digits for indices 0..len-1 and then digits[len] is 0 (from calloc). We then run the loop for i from 0 to len (inclusive). So when i==len, digits[i] is 0 (so we do the <5 branch). Then we don't have an index len+1? But in the branch for digits[i]>=10, we do digits[i+1]++ -> which is at index len+1. But we allocated len+2, so that is safe.\n\n   However, what if the carry propagates beyond len+1? We allocated only len+2. But note: the number we started with is the string of num, which is a positive integer. The maximum value of the extra digit (at index len) after any carry is 1? And then at index len+1, we set it to 0 initially and then if we get a carry at index len, we set digits[len+1] to 1. Then when i=len+1, we would have to process? But our loop only goes to i<=len. So we miss the digit at len+1.\n\n   The original program iterates to i<=number.length() (which is len) so it doesn't process beyond index len? But note: the array is of size len+1 (in the original: digits = new int[number.length()+1] -> indices 0..len). Then the loop goes i from 0 to len (inclusive). So it does process index len. Then if at index len we have 10, we set digits[len+1]++ and then set digits[len]=0. But then the loop does not process index len+1? \n\n   Therefore, the original program might have a carry beyond the allocated array? Actually, the array is of size len+1, so the valid indices are 0..len. Then when i=len, we access digits[len+1] which is out of bounds? \n\n   Let me check the original:\n\n        int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];   // indices: 0 to number.length() (inclusive) -> that's number.length()+1 elements.\n\n        for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {   // i from 0 to number.length() (which is the last index of the array? no: the array has indices 0..number.length() (which is the index of the last element) -> but note: the array has size number.length()+1, so the last index is number.length().\n\n        Then in the loop, when i = number.length(), we do:\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                digits[i+1]++;   // here, i+1 = number.length()+1 -> which is beyond the array.\n\n        This is an array index out of bounds.\n\n   But wait: the array is of size number.length()+1 -> the indices are 0 to number.length(). So digits[number.length()] is the last element. Then digits[i+1] when i=number.length() is beyond.\n\n   How did the original Java program run without an error? \n\n        The initial array: \n            digits[number.length()] = 0? \n            Then we process i=0,1,...,number.length()-1: then at i=number.length()-1: we might set digits[number.length()] to 1? Then at i=number.length(), we have digits[i] which is the last element (index number.length()).\n\n            If it is 10? Then we try to set digits[number.length()+1] which is beyond.\n\n        But the array was allocated with size number.length()+1, so the last valid index is number.length(). \n\n        Therefore, the original program has a bug? \n\n        However, note: the array is of size number.length()+1 -> indices 0 to number.length(). The loop runs i from 0 to number.length() (so the last iteration i=number.length()). Then we access digits[i+1] which is index number.length()+1 -> which is out of bounds.\n\n        This must be fixed? But the problem says to translate the entire sequence. We are to reproduce the same behavior. The same behavior might be an array out of bounds? \n\n        Alternatively, the original problem might not have been tested? Or the constraints of the original problem ensure that the carry does not propagate to the last digit? \n\n        Let me see: the algorithm is for the minimal bills for paying an amount. It is known that the greedy algorithm for Japanese currency (with coins 1,5,10,...) works? But the algorithm here is a bit different.\n\n        Actually, the algorithm is:\n\n          For each digit (from least significant to most):\n            if the digit is 10 -> carry to next and set to 0.\n            then:\n              if digit < 5: use that many 1-bills.\n              if digit == 5: then use a 5-bill, but then check the next digit: if the next digit is >=5, then we can do: use a 10-bill and get change? Actually, it's better to carry? The algorithm does: if the next digit is >=5, then we increment the next digit (so we are effectively borrowing) and then use the 5? Why? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm is minimizing the number of bills. The bills are of denominations 1 and 10^k, 5*10^k, 10*10^k.\n\n          Example: 5 in the current digit: we can use one 5-bill. But if the next digit is >=5, then we can do: use a 10-bill in the next higher denomination and then get 5 back? Actually, the algorithm is:\n\n            if digit==5:\n                if the next digit is >=5, then we do: pay 10 for the current digit and then get 5 back? That would be: we add 10 to the current digit? Actually, no: they are doing: \n                    bills += 5;\n                    and then if the next digit is >=5, they increment the next digit.\n\n            Why increment the next digit? Because if we pay 10 for the current digit, then we have to add 1 to the next digit? And then we get 5 back? But we don't add the 5 back? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm is:\n\n            if digit==5:\n                use a 5-bill -> cost 5 bills.\n                then, if the next digit is >=5, then we can combine the next digit's payment with the change? Actually, it's better to pay 10 and get 5 back? Then we have 5 in the current digit and then we can use that 5 to reduce the next? \n\n          But the algorithm doesn't do that. It simply increments the next digit? \n\n          Actually, the algorithm is:\n\n            We can either use a 5-bill and then leave the next digit as is, or we can use a 10-bill and then get 5 back, which effectively adds 1 to the next digit and then we have 5 in the current digit? But then the current digit becomes 5? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n        But note: the original problem for the third program is from atcoder ABC155 E. We can look it up? \n\n        The problem: paying an amount N using only 1-bill, 10-bill, 100-bill, ... and also 5-bill, 50-bill, 500-bill, ... and the goal is to minimize the total number of bills.\n\n        The solution: dynamic programming or greedy. The algorithm here is greedy from the least significant digit.\n\n        However, the array out of bounds is a real issue.\n\n        How to fix? We allocated the array to be one larger? Actually, we allocated len+2. Then in the loop, we go to i<=len (which is the last index we allocated: index len+1? no, we allocated indices 0..len+1 -> that's len+2 elements). Then when i=len, we set digits[i+1] (which is index len+1) which is within the allocation? \n\n        In our C code: we allocated len+2 elements -> indices 0 to len+1. Then the loop runs for i from 0 to len (inclusive). Then when i=len, we set digits[i+1] -> index len+1 -> which is the last element? \n\n        But note: the original Java program does not have that allocation. It only allocated len+1. So we are being safe.\n\n        However, we are translating, so we can fix the array size to be len+2 to avoid the out of bounds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the carry beyond the last digit is possible? Then we must process that digit? But the loop only goes to i<=len. The next digit (at index len+1) is never processed? \n\n        Actually, the algorithm in the third program is known to work with an extra digit? The problem from atcoder has solutions that use an extra digit. \n\n        But to be safe, we change the loop to go to i<= (len+1) if we allocate enough? \n\n        However, the original program does not do that. We are to reproduce the same behavior. The same behavior would be: if the carry propagates beyond the array, then the original Java program crashes. But we don't want to crash.\n\n        Since the problem says the number can be big, but in our chain the number is the integer num (which is the output of the first program), and num is at most (h/a) and h and a are integers (so num is at most 10^9? then the string length is at most 10). Then the carry beyond the last digit (which is the most significant) is unlikely? \n\n        Actually, the algorithm: \n\n          We start with a number (num) and then we process each digit. The maximum carry: the most significant digit might be 9, then we add 1 -> becomes 10, then we set it to 0 and carry to the next. Then we have a new digit 1. Then we process that new digit? \n\n          But in the original program, the array has only len+1 elements. The new digit is at index len (if we started with len digits, then the array has indices 0..len-1 and then we have an extra at index len for the carry). Then when we process i=len, we see a 1? Then we do nothing (because 1<5) and then we are done.\n\n          But what if the carry at the last digit (index len) becomes 10? Then we set digits[len+1] to 1 and set digits[len] to 0. But the array is only up to index len? Then we write beyond.\n\n        Therefore, we must allocate one more digit? \n\n        In our C code, we allocated len+2, so we have indices 0..len+1. Then the loop runs i from 0 to len (inclusive). So when i=len, we might set digits[len+1] to 1. Then we don't process i=len+1? \n\n        But the loop condition: i<=len -> so we stop at i=len. The digit at index len+1 is never processed? \n\n        That digit might be 1 (which is <5) so it would add 1 to bills? But we didn't process it.\n\n        Therefore, we must extend the loop to i<= (the last index that we have a digit)? \n\n        However, the original program does not do that. The original program stops at i=len (which is the last index of the array). \n\n        How to fix the algorithm? \n\n        We can note: the carry beyond the array might happen, but then we have to account for that digit? \n\n        Alternatively, we can run the loop until we have processed the entire array including any new digit generated by the last carry? \n\n        But the original program does not.\n\n        Since the problem in the chain is for a small number (num), we can hope that the carry doesn't go beyond the allocated array. \n\n        But to be safe, we can change the loop to run until the entire array including the last allocated digit? \n\n        Actually, we allocated len+2, so we can run the loop for i from 0 to len+1? \n\n        Then we set:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len+1; i++) \n\n        But then we need to initialize digits for indices beyond len to 0? We did calloc, so they are 0.\n\n        Then we process i=len+1: which is 0 -> bills+=0.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, we change the loop to go to i<=len+1.\n\n        But the original program only goes to i<=len. Why? Because the array size was len+1? \n\n        We are translating the entire sequence, but we are fixing an array out of bounds? \n\n        Alternatively, we can run the loop until the highest digit that is non-zero? \n\n        Given the time, we will run the loop to len+1.\n\n        Steps for the third program in C:\n\n            Allocate digits for len+2 (indices 0 to len+1) -> calloc sets to 0.\n            Convert the number to reversed digits: for i in [0, len-1]: digits[i] = s[len-1-i]-'0'\n            Then set the rest (from len to len+1) to 0? calloc already did.\n\n            Then for i from 0 to len+1 (inclusive) do the algorithm.\n\n        This should be safe.\n\n   Therefore, the final C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int h, a;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &a);\n\n            // Compute num (number of times we can subtract a from h until h<=0)\n            int num = 0;\n            while (h > 0) {\n                h -= a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n            // Convert num to a string\n            char s[20];\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", num);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            // Allocate and initialize the digits array (with zeros) for len+2 elements\n            int *digits = (int *)calloc(len+2, sizeof(int));\n            // Convert the string to reversed digits (least significant at index0)\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = s[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n            long long bills = 0; // use long long to avoid overflow? The original used int, but the number of bills might be large? But our num is not huge.\n\n            // We'll iterate from i=0 to i=len+1 (inclusive)\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len+1; i++) {\n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                }\n                if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (i+1 <= len+1) { // we can check i+1 is within our allocated array? We allocated len+2, so i+1 is up to len+2? But we only go to i=len+1, so i+1=len+2 is beyond? We should avoid accessing beyond.\n                        // Actually, we are iterating i only up to len+1, so i+1 is at most len+2 -> but we allocated only len+2 elements (indices 0..len+1). So digits[i+1] when i=len+1 is beyond.\n                        // Therefore, we need to check i+1 < (len+2) -> i+1 <= len+1? i<=len?\n                        // But note: we allocated for indices 0..len+1 -> so the last valid index is len+1. Then when i=len+1, we access digits[i+1] which is len+2 -> out of bounds.\n                        // We must avoid that.\n                        // Instead, we can only check the next digit if i+1 is within the allocated array. Since our loop goes to i=len+1, then i+1 would be len+2 -> beyond.\n                        // We should break the array bounds.\n\n                        // How about: we allocated len+2 elements, so the valid indices are 0 to len+1. Then we can only check if i+1 < (len+2) -> i < len+1.\n                        if (i < len+1 && digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                            digits[i+1]++;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    if (i < len+1) { // to avoid writing beyond the array\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                }\n            }\n\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", bills);\n            free(digits);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But note: the condition for the 5 branch: we only check the next digit if we are not at the last element? And similarly for the >=6 branch, we only increment the next digit if we are not at the last element.\n\n   This should avoid array out of bounds.\n\n   However, what if at i=len+1, we have a digit that is 10? Then we do:\n\n        digits[i+1]++ -> which is beyond the array? \n\n   But we are at i=len+1, which is the last index we allocated? We allocated indices 0..len+1. Then i+1 = len+2 -> beyond.\n\n   We must not allow that.\n\n   Therefore, we should break the array bounds only for i < len+1 in the 10 branch? \n\n   Actually, the 10 branch comes first. We do:\n\n        if (digits[i] == 10) {\n            if (i < len+1) { // we need to check?\n                digits[i+1]++;\n            } else {\n                // then we have a carry beyond the array? We cannot represent it.\n                // But then we have an error? \n            }\n            digits[i] = 0;\n        }\n\n   But the problem: the original program didn't account for that. We are translating and we want to avoid crashing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can allocate one more digit? We allocated len+2 -> indices 0..len+1. Then we run the loop to i<=len+1. Then when i=len+1, we might set digits[len+2]? But we didn't allocate that.\n\n   So we need to allocate len+3? Then run the loop to len+2? \n\n   Given that the number is small (at most 20 digits originally), we can allocate more.\n\n   But to be safe, we can allocate len+3 and run the loop to len+2.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        digits = calloc(len+3, sizeof(int));   // indices 0..len+2\n        for (int i=0; i<=len+2; i++) { ... }\n\n   Then in the loop, for i=len+2, we access digits[i+1] which would be len+3 -> beyond. So we must avoid.\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n        for (int i=0; i<=len+2; i++) {\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                if (i < len+2) { // because we allocated up to index len+2, so we can write to i+1 if i+1 <= len+2 -> i < len+2\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                // else: ignore carry beyond the array? But that would lose a carry.\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n            // then the rest\n        }\n\n   But losing a carry is not acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break out of the loop if we are at the last possible digit and there's a carry? \n\n   Given the complexity and that the number is small, we can hope that the carry doesn't go beyond len+2. \n\n   But note: the maximum carry is 1 per digit. And we start with a number of at most 20 digits. The maximum number of new digits is 2? \n\n   We'll allocate len+3 and run the loop to len+2.\n\n   Final allocation: len+3 for the array, and loop i from 0 to len+2.\n\n   How about:\n\n        n = len+3;\n        int *digits = (int*) calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n        ... fill 0..len-1 with the reversed digits.\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {   // i from 0 to n-1 (which is len+2)\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                if (i < n-1) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                } else {\n                    // This should not happen? \n                    // But if it does, we ignore.\n                }\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n            // then the rest of the conditions\n        }\n\n   But the rest of the conditions might then see a 0? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do the 10 adjustment repeatedly? But the problem says the original did it only once per digit.\n\n   Given the time, we will do:\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            // First, handle the carry from previous? But the 10 might be introduced by a carry from the left? \n            // The original only does one adjustment: if 10 then carry and set to 0, then move to the next condition.\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                if (i < n-1) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                digits[i] = 0;\n            }\n\n            // Then the rest of the conditions for the current digit.\n\n            if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                bills += digits[i];\n            } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                if (i < n-1) {\n                    if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                }\n                bills += 5;\n            } else {\n                if (i < n-1) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                bills += 10 - digits[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n   This should be safe.\n\n   But note: after we do the 10 adjustment, the digit becomes 0, and then we go into the <5 branch. So it's safe.\n\n   However, what if the adjustment to the next digit makes that digit 10? Then we will process that when we get to i+1.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   But the original program did not do the 10 adjustment in a separate loop? It did it once per digit. But we are also doing it once per digit. And we are processing the digits in order. So it should be the same.\n\n   Let me test with a small number: 15 (as a two-digit number) -> but wait, our num is from the first program, and then we convert to string.\n\n   Due to the complexity and the fact that the numbers are small, we assume it's safe.\n\n   Final C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int h, a;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &h, &a);\n            int num = 0;\n            while (h > 0) {\n                h -= a;\n                num++;\n            }\n\n            char s[20];\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", num);\n            int len = strlen(s);\n\n            int n = len + 3;   // we are going to have len+3 elements in the array\n            int *digits = (int *)calloc(n, sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = s[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n            long long bills = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    if (i < n-1) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                }\n                if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (i < n-1 && digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    if (i < n-1) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                }\n            }\n\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", bills);\n            free(digits);\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   But wait: the original third program did not have the 10 adjustment at the beginning of the loop? It had it as a separate condition that if met, then it does the carry and then continues to the next conditions? \n\n   In our code, after adjusting the 10 to 0 and carry, we then check the conditions for the current digit (which is now 0). So it will go to the <5 branch.\n\n   In the original, after setting to 0, it then checks the next conditions? And 0 is <5, so it adds 0.\n\n   So it's the same.\n\n   Therefore, this should work.\n\n   Let me test with num=4:\n\n        s = \"4\", len=1.\n        digits[0] = 4, and the rest are 0.\n        n = 1+3 = 4.\n        loop i=0 to 3:\n            i=0: \n                digits[0]=4 -> not 10.\n                then 4<5 -> bills +=4 -> bills=4.\n            i=1,2,3: digits[i]=0 -> bills +=0.\n\n        output 4.\n\n   Test with num=10:\n\n        s=\"10\", len=2.\n        digits[0] = 0, digits[1] = 1, then the rest 0.\n        n=2+3=5.\n        i=0: \n            digits[0]=0 -> bills +=0.\n        i=1:\n            digits[1]=1 -> <5 -> bills +=1 -> total=1.\n        Then output 1? \n\n        But the third program for the number 10 should be? \n\n        We can simulate the original third program for \"10\":\n\n            number = \"10\", digits = new int[3] (indices0,1,2) -> initial: digits[0]=0, digits[1]=1, digits[2]=0.\n            i=0: \n                digits[0]=0 -> <5: bills=0.\n            i=1:\n                digits[1]=1 -> <5: bills=1.\n            i=2: \n                digits[2]=0 -> <5: bills=1.\n            output 1.\n\n        But the minimal bills for 10: we can use one 10-bill -> 1 bill. So it's 1.\n\n        Therefore, it's correct.\n\n   But what about 9? \n\n        num=9: \n            s=\"9\", len=1.\n            digits[0]=9, then the rest 0.\n            n=4.\n            i=0:\n                9>=6 -> else branch: \n                    if i<3: digits[1]++ (so digits[1] becomes 1)\n                    bills += 10-9 = 1.\n                bills=1.\n            i=1:\n                digits[1]=1 -> <5: bills +=1 -> total=2.\n            i=2,3: 0.\n\n            output 2.\n\n        How to pay 9? \n            We can use one 10-bill and get 1 back -> then we have to use 1 one-bill to return? But we are the payer, we want to pay 9. \n            Alternatively, we can use 9 one-bills -> 9 bills.\n            Or one 5-bill and 4 one-bills -> 5 bills.\n            Or a 10-bill and get 1 back: but then we give 10 and get 1 back, so net we give 9. And the number of physical bills exchanged: we give 1 bill (10) and get 1 bill (1) back? But the problem counts the bills we give? \n\n        The problem: we are the customer and we want to pay exactly N. We can use any number of bills. The cashier can give change. The goal is to minimize the total number of bills (that we hand over, regardless of change).\n\n        But the common solution for this problem is to use dynamic programming. The greedy might not work for 9? \n\n        However, the original third program is from atcoder ABC155 E, and there is a known greedy solution that works from the least significant digit.\n\n        But the known solution for 9 is: \n            We can use a 10-bill and then get 1 back: so we give 10 and get 1. The total number of bills we hand over is 1 (the 10) and the cashier hands us 1 (the 1) -> but the problem asks for the total number of bills that change hands? \n\n        The problem statement of ABC155 E: \n            \"Print the minimum number of bills and coins that he and the clerk use in total.\"\n\n        So it's the total number of bills used by both. Therefore, 10 (given by customer) and 1 (given by clerk) -> total 2.\n\n        So 2 is the answer for 9.\n\n        Therefore, our program is correct.\n\n   Given the above, we output the C program as below."
