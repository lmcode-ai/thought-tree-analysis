But the state machine might combine two chars into one digit. Actually, the state machine for the second program: It was designed for a ternary code: \n          '.' -> 0\n          '-.' -> 1\n          '--' -> 2 But we are feeding it arbitrary characters. We treat every char that is not '.' as '-'. We traverse the string:\n\n          for each char c in S:\n            if c == '.':\n               if s is 1:\n                 output '1'\n                 s = 0\n               else:\n                 output '0'\n            else: // c is not '.' (so treat as '-')\n               if s is 1:\n                 output '2'\n                 s = 0\n               else:\n                 s = 1\n\n        After the loop, if s is 1, we have a pending '-' that hasn't been processed? But the original program doesn't output anything. So we leave it. We will simulate and store the output in a buffer. Third program:\n\n  Take the string from the second program's output and convert to an integer. Then find the next prime number >= that integer, but if the number is even and not 2, then start from the next odd. Steps for the third program:\n\n    x = atoi(second_output);\n\n    if (x < 2) x = 2;\n    else if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n\n    while (1) {\n        // check if x is prime\n        if (x == 2) break;\n        int is_prime = 1;\n        int sqrt_num = sqrt(x);\n        for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt_num; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                is_prime = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (is_prime) break;\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\nBut note: the third program in Java has a condition: it starts by ensuring x is odd (if not 2). Then it checks from 3 to sqrt(x) by step 2. However, what if x is 2? Then we break immediately. But in the loop, the condition: \n   if (x == 2) break; -> then we output 2. But the original program does:\n\n   if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n   while (true) {\n        int i;\n        double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) break;\n        }\n        if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n        x += 2;\n   }\n\nWe can simulate similarly. But note: the condition `i > sqrtNum` means that no divisor was found. We can do the same in C by having a flag. Let's code accordingly.

But the second_output might be partial. But we still have the earlier outputs. For example, the string \"14:50\" produces \"22\", so x=22. Then the third program: 22 is even and not 2, so set x=23. Then check 23: prime -> output 23. This matches. Let's test with a small example. Input for first program: \"00:00\" and \"00:01\" -> \n      total1 = 0, total2 = 1 -> diff = -1 -> then diff = 1439 -> h=23, m=59 -> \"23:59\"\n\n  Then second program on \"23:59\":\n      '2' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1 -> no output. '3' -> not '.' -> state=1 -> output '2', state=0.\n      ':' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1.\n      '5' -> not '.' -> state=1 -> output '2', state=0.\n      '9' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1. [then end, so no output for the last state] So the output is \"22\", then x=22 -> then next prime is 23.\n\n  Output: 23. Another example: \n      First program: \"20:20\" and \"05:30\" -> \n          20:20 = 20*60+20 = 1220\n          05:30 = 5*60+30 = 330\n          diff = 1220-330 = 890 minutes = 14*60+50 -> \"14:50\"\n\n      Second program on \"14:50\":\n          '1' -> state0 -> becomes state1, no output.\n          '4' -> state1 -> output '2', state0.\n          ':' -> state0 -> becomes state1. '5' -> state1 -> output '2', state0. '0' -> state0 -> becomes state1. (then end, no output) So output is \"22\", then x=22 -> then next prime is 23.\n\n  Output: 23. But wait, the first example in the first program: Input: \"20:20\" and \"05:30\" -> output \"14:50\" (which is printed in the first program) but in our chain, we then feed to second program and then third program to get 23.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain the three programs together. Since the first program reads two time strings and outputs a time, the second program reads a string of '.' and '-' and outputs a decoded string of digits, and the third program reads an integer and outputs the next prime number (or the same if prime and odd, or the next odd prime if even and not 2), we must note:\n\nThe first program outputs a time in the format \"HH:mm\" (e.g., \"19:45\"). However, note that if the time is negative, it wraps around? Actually, in Java, LocalTime handles midnight. But we are going to chain: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n\nBut wait: the second program expects a string of '.' and '-'. The first program outputs a time string (e.g., \"19:45\") which contains digits and colon. This does not match the input expected by the second program. Similarly, the second program outputs a string of digits (e.g., \"012\") and the third program expects an integer.\n\nThis indicates that the original chain might not be intended to be run as a sequence? However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nBut clearly, the output of the first program (a time string) is not a valid input for the second program (which expects a string of '.' and '-'). Similarly, the output of the second program (a string of digits) is not an integer but the third program reads an integer.\n\nTherefore, we must reconsider the problem: the three programs are independent. But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nHowever, the inputs and outputs do not match. This suggests that the chain might be broken. But note: the problem states that the programs are meant to be executed in sequence. \n\nLooking at the programs:\n\n1. The first program (codeforces_387_A) reads two time strings (current time and a duration) and subtracts the duration from the current time. It prints the result in the format \"HH:mm\". For example, if the input is \"20:20\" and \"05:30\", then the output is \"14:50\".\n\n2. The second program (codeforces_32_B) decodes a string of '.' and '-' (which represent a ternary code) into digits: \n   - \".\" is 0\n   - \"-.\" is 1\n   - \"--\" is 2\n\n   But note: the input to the second program is the output of the first? That doesn't make sense because the first outputs a string with colons and digits.\n\n3. The third program (atcoder_ABC149_C) reads an integer and prints the next prime number that is at least as big as the input (if the input is even and not 2, then it starts from the next odd number).\n\nThis chain is not compatible. Therefore, we must assume that the chain is independent? But the problem says \"the entire sequence\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain is:\n\nInput for the entire system: \n  For the first program: two time strings (like \"20:20\" and \"05:30\")\n  Then the output of the first program is passed as input to the second? But the second expects a string of '.' and '-'.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nBut wait: the problem states that we are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence. How can they be in sequence if the outputs and inputs don't match? \n\nWe must look at the context: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". It might be that the entire system has a single input (the one for the first program) and the final output (from the third program). But the intermediate outputs are not intended to be printed but passed as data.\n\nHowever, the mismatch in data types is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have been intended as three separate chains? But the instruction says \"entire sequence\".\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the output of the first is the input of the second, and the output of the second is the input of the third.\n\nBut the first program outputs a time string (with colons) and the second expects a string of '.' and '-'. This is not compatible.\n\nThis suggests that the chain is not as provided? Or there is a misunderstanding.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program\". We must interpret the sequence as:\n\n1. The first program runs and produces an output string (say S1).\n2. The second program is run with S1 as input? But that doesn't work because the second program expects a string of '.' and '-', and S1 is of the form \"HH:mm\".\n\nSimilarly, the second program outputs a string of digits (which is not an integer? It is a sequence of digits without spaces). The third program reads an integer. So the third program would read the entire string of digits and try to parse it as an integer.\n\nBut that might work? For example, if the second program outputs \"123\", then the third program would read 123 and then compute the next prime.\n\nHowever, the input to the second program is a time string, which is not composed of '.' and '-'. So the second program would fail.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the chain is not as provided? Or perhaps the programs are meant to be independent and the chain is broken? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". \n\nAnother possibility: the problem is to run the three programs independently on the same initial input? But that doesn't match \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the confusion, let's assume the problem is to chain the programs as:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> Output1 -> Program2 -> Output2 -> Program3 -> Output3\n\nand we are to write a C program that does the same without I/O in the middle.\n\nBut the data types don't match. Therefore, we must reinterpret the problem: the entire input for the system is the input for the first program, and then the output of the first program is transformed to the input of the second program? But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the three programs are independent and the chain is not intended to be connected? But the problem states that they are in sequence.\n\nAfter careful thought, I notice: the problem says \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". But it doesn't specify that the output of the first is the input of the second? It says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\nHowever, without matching data types, we must assume that the intended chain is:\n\n1. The first program reads two time strings and produces a time string (say T).\n2. The second program reads a string of '.' and '-' (which is not T, but what is it?) \u2014 wait, the second program does not use the output of the first? \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the chain is broken and the problem intended three separate programs that are run independently on the same input? But that doesn't make sense because the problem says \"in sequence\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to run the three programs in sequence, each reading from the same input source? Then the input would be:\n\nFor the first program: two time strings (on one line? two tokens)\nThen for the second program: a string (on the next line? or same line? \u2014 the second program reads one token)\nThen for the third program: an integer (on the next line? or same line? \u2014 the third program reads one token)\n\nSo the entire input would be:\n\n<time1> <time2>\n<code_string>\n<integer>\n\nAnd the entire output would be:\n\n<time_result>\n<decoded_string>\n<next_prime>\n\nBut the problem says: the output of each program is the input to the next. That would not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that the first program's output is the input to the second, and the second's output is the input to the third. Then the entire input is only for the first program, and the final output is only from the third.\n\nBut then we must convert the outputs appropriately.\n\nHowever, the output of the first program is a time string (e.g., \"14:50\"), which is not a valid input for the second program (which expects '.' and '-'). Similarly, the output of the second program is a string of digits, which the third program can read as an integer? \n\nBut the second program's output is a string of digits without spaces. The third program reads an integer. So if the second program outputs \"120\", then the third program would read 120 and compute the next prime.\n\nThe problem is the first program's output being fed to the second. The second program expects only '.' and '-', but the first program outputs a string with digits and colon.\n\nThis means the chain as described is not runnable. \n\nGiven the confusion, I suspect that the three programs are independent and are meant to be run on different inputs. But the problem says \"in sequence\" and the output of one is the input of the next.\n\nWithout further clarification, we must assume that the chain is:\n\nInput for the entire system is the input for the first program (two time strings). The output of the first program is a string (HH:MM). This string is then passed to the second program. But the second program expects '.' and '-'. This is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the provided chain is not intended to be connected by their inputs and outputs in a straightforward manner. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to run the three programs in sequence on the same input data (which would be provided as three separate inputs) but that doesn't match \"output of each is input to the next\".\n\nAfter re\u2010examining the problem statement: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior\".\n\nAnd \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\nSo we are to read the input once (which includes all necessary data for the entire chain) and then produce the final output without intermediate I/O.\n\nThe input must include everything needed for all three programs. But then how do we chain? \n\nWe must assume that the input is structured as:\n\n- First, the two time strings for the first program.\n- Then, the string of '.' and '-' for the second program (on the next line?).\n- Then, the integer for the third program (on the next line).\n\nBut then the chain is not connected: the first program's output is not used by the second, and the second's output is not used by the third.\n\nThe problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the only way is to have the entire input for the system be the input for the first program, and then the output of the first becomes the input for the second, and so on.\n\nGiven the data type mismatch, we must abandon the literal interpretation and look for the intended functionality.\n\nPerhaps the three programs are from different problems and are not meant to be chained? But the problem says they are to be executed in sequence.\n\nAnother possibility: the examples are provided as three separate programs, but the chain is not defined by their inputs and outputs but by the problem's own specification? But the problem doesn't specify the chain.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the chain is as follows:\n\n1. The first program takes two time strings and outputs a time string.\n2. We then take the time string and interpret it as a string of '.' and '-' for the second program? That doesn't make sense.\n3. Or, we use the output of the first program as a string and then the second program is applied to a different part of the input?\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the programs and their purposes, and since the problem is from different sources (codeforces, atcoder), they are likely independent.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will assume that the entire input consists of:\n\n- The first two tokens (which are the two time strings) for the first program.\n- Then the next token (a string of '.' and '-') for the second program.\n- Then the next token (an integer) for the third program.\n\nAnd the entire output will be:\n\n- The output of the first program (the time string) is not output.\n- The output of the second program (the decoded string) is not output.\n- Only the output of the third program (the next prime) is output.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" So only the third program's output will be printed.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" as the chain. The chain would normally output three things. But if we are only outputting the last one, then the behavior is not the same.\n\nAlternatively, the chain is:\n\nInput -> Program1 -> some data1 -> Program2 -> some data2 -> Program3 -> output\n\nand the final output is the output of the third program.\n\nSo the intermediate outputs are not printed, only passed as data.\n\nTherefore, we must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (two time strings).\n- Compute the result of the first program (a time string, but we don't print it).\n- Use that time string as input to the second program? But the second program expects '.' and '-'. This is not compatible.\n\nGiven the deadlock, I will assume that the chain is not defined by the provided programs because of the data type mismatch. Therefore, we must contact the problem setter for clarification. However, as an AI, I must make a decision.\n\nDecision: The three programs are independent and the input will have three parts. The first program's output is discarded, the second program's output is discarded, and only the third program's output is printed. But then the chain is not connected.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended the first program's output to be the input to the second, but the first program's output format is not what the second program expects. This is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the provided programs, the only logical chain that can be formed is if we reinterpret the output of the first program as a string and feed to the second program, and then reinterpret the output of the second program as an integer for the third.\n\nBut the first program's output is a time string. The second program expects '.' and '-'. We cannot change the first program's output to be '.' and '-'. \n\nTherefore, I will assume that the chain is not as provided and that the three programs are to be run on separate inputs that are provided at the beginning. The entire input will have three lines:\n\nLine1: two time strings (e.g., \"20:20 05:30\")\nLine2: a string of '.' and '-' for the second program.\nLine3: an integer for the third program.\n\nAnd then we run:\n\n1. Program1 on the first line -> produces a string, but we discard it because it's not used.\n2. Program2 on the second line -> produces a string of digits.\n3. Program3 on the third line -> produces an integer.\n\nBut then the output of the second program is not used by the third. The problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So that doesn't hold.\n\nUnless the output of the second program is not used? The third program uses the integer from the input.\n\nThis is not satisfying.\n\nGiven the time, I will do the following:\n\n- The entire system input will be the input for the first program (two time strings).\n- The output of the first program (a time string) will be passed to the second program as its input.\n- The second program will have to be modified to accept any string? But its logic only works on '.' and '-'. It will produce gibberish.\n\nThis is not the same behavior.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to change the second program to accept the time string and treat it as a string of '.' and ':' by mapping ':' to '-' or something? But that is not specified.\n\nWithout specification, we cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, after careful thought, I think the intended chain is independent and the problem meant that we have to run the three programs in sequence on the same initial input data, but each program reads from the initial input independently.\n\nSo the input will be read once, and then each program will extract its own input from the overall input.\n\nFor example, the overall input might be three lines:\n\nLine1: the two time strings for program1.\nLine2: the string for program2.\nLine3: the integer for program3.\n\nThen we run program1 on line1, program2 on line2, program3 on line3, and then the final output is the output of program3.\n\nBut then the outputs of program1 and program2 are not used and are printed in the original, but the problem says intermediate steps should not do I/O. So we would suppress their output and only output program3's result.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"Only the last block should handle producing output\", so we only output the result of program3.\n\n And for the chain: the output of program1 is not used by program2, etc.\n\n This does not match \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nGiven the instructions, I will assume that the chain is not data-dependent between the programs and that each program takes its input from the initial input data. Therefore, the C program will:\n\n1. Read the entire input (which has the data for all three programs).\n2. Process the first program's logic on its input data, but not use the result for anything (since the next program doesn't use it) and not output it.\n3. Process the second program's logic on its input data, and not output it.\n4. Process the third program's logic on its input data, and output it.\n\nBut then what is the point of the first two programs? This is not a chain.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have meant that the three programs are to be composed in a chain, but the data types are to be passed as strings. Then:\n\n- The first program outputs a string S1.\n- The second program takes S1 as input and outputs a string S2.\n- The third program takes S2 and tries to parse it as an integer.\n\nThis is the only way to chain them. \n\nSo for the first program, we compute the time string.\n\nFor the second program, we would normally expect '.' and '-', but we are giving it a string of digits and colon. The second program's logic will:\n\n- It will iterate over each character in S1.\n- When it sees a '.', it will output a '0' or '1' (depending on state).\n- When it sees a '-', it will set a state and then on the next '.' or '-' output '1' or '2'? \n\nBut in our case, the string S1 contains ':' and digits. The digits are characters from '0' to '9' and colon is ':'. \n\nThe second program will:\n\n- Take the first character, say '1' (which is not '.' or '-') -> it will set `s = true` and move on.\n- The next character might be '4' (not '.' or '-') -> then since `s` is true, it will print '2' and set `s` to false? But wait, the second program's code:\n\n```java\n        for (int i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {\n            if (n[i] == '.') {\n                if (s) {\n                    System.out.print(1);\n                    s = false;\n                } else {\n                    System.out.print(0);\n                }\n            } else {\n                if (s) {\n                    System.out.print(2);\n                    s = false;\n                } else {\n                    s = true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nSo for '1' (which is not '.' and not '-', but in the code the else branch is for '-')? Wait, the code for the second program actually treats any character that is not '.' as if it is '-'. Because the input is only '.' and '-' (from the problem of codeforces_32_B). \n\nBut in our case, we are passing in a string that contains other characters. The code will treat any char not '.' as the else branch, which is for '-'.\n\nSo we can use the second program on any string, but it will interpret '.' as a dot and any other character as '-'.\n\nThis means the time string \"14:50\" will be interpreted as:\n\n- '1' -> not '.', so else branch: since s is initially false, we set s to true (and do nothing else).\n- '4' -> not '.', so else branch: now s is true, so we print '2' and set s to false.\n- ':' -> not '.', so else branch: s is false, so we set s to true.\n- '5' -> not '.', else branch: s is true, so print '2' and set s to false.\n- '0' -> not '.', else branch: s is false, so set s to true. But then the loop ends, and we have an unterminated state.\n\nThe second program does not flush the state at the end. So if the state is true at the end, it doesn't output anything.\n\nSo for \"14:50\", the second program would output \"22\". \n\nThen the third program will take the string \"22\" and parse it as the integer 22. Then it will find the next prime >=22. The next prime is 23.\n\nSo the final output would be 23.\n\nThis is a possible chain.\n\nTherefore, we will:\n\n1. Read the two time strings for the first program.\n2. Compute the resulting time string from the first program (in the format \"HH:mm\", but note that if the hour is single digit, it might not have a leading zero? In Java, LocalTime uses two digits for hour and minute).\n3. Pass this string (e.g., \"14:50\") to the second program.\n4. The second program will process this string as if it were a string of '.' and '-', but using the code: \n   - '.' -> triggers the if branch.\n   - any other character (including '0'-'9' and ':') -> triggers the else branch (which is for '-' in the original).\n5. Collect the output string of the second program (a string of digits).\n6. Convert this string to an integer and pass to the third program.\n7. The third program will find the next prime >= that integer.\n8. Output that prime.\n\nSo the C program will:\n\n- Read two time strings (each of the form \"HH:mm\" actually they are given as two tokens? The first program reads two tokens by `sc.next()`. In the example, the input might be \"20:20\" and \"05:30\", so tokens by space? Or the input is one token for the first time and then another token for the second time.\n\nThe first program: \n   String[] s = sc.next().split(\":\");\n   String[] t = sc.next().split(\":\");\n\nSo it reads two tokens (each token is a string that may contain colon) and then splits by colon.\n\nSo the overall input has two tokens for the first program. We can assume tokens are separated by space.\n\nTherefore, the input format is:\n\n<token1> <token2>\n\nwhere token1 is a time string (e.g., \"20:20\") and token2 is a time string (e.g., \"05:30\").\n\nThen we compute the time difference.\n\nIn C, we can read two strings for the first part.\n\nSteps for the first program in C:\n\n  char time1[6], time2[6]; // format \"HH:MM\", so 5 chars + null\n  scanf(\"%5s %5s\", time1, time2);\n\n  // Parse time1: sscanf(time1, \"%d:%d\", &h1, &m1);\n  // Parse time2: sscanf(time2, \"%d:%d\", &h2, &m2);\n\n  // Compute the time difference: subtract h2 hours and m2 minutes from (h1, m1)\n  // Convert both to total minutes: total1 = h1*60 + m1;\n  // total2 = h2*60 + m2;\n  // result_minutes = total1 - total2;\n  // If result_minutes is negative, add 24*60 to wrap around to the previous day.\n  // But note: LocalTime in Java does not wrap around? Actually, LocalTime.minus* methods handle overflow by wrapping around the 24-hour clock.\n\n  // So we do: result_minutes = (total1 - total2 + 24*60) % (24*60);\n  // Then convert to hours and minutes: \n  //   h = result_minutes / 60;\n  //   m = result_minutes % 60;\n\n  // Format the result as a string: sprintf(result_time, \"%02d:%02d\", h, m);\n\n  // But note: the first program uses LocalTime which has a format of two digits for hour and minute.\n\n  // Example: if result_minutes is 14*60+50, then we get \"14:50\"\n\nThen this string `result_time` is the input to the second program.\n\nSecond program:\n\n  We have a string S = result_time (e.g., \"14:50\")\n  We simulate the second program on this string.\n\n  We need to produce a string of digits (without spaces) as the second program would.\n\n  We can simulate the state machine:\n\n    int s = 0; // false=0, true=1\n    char *p = result_time;\n    char output_buffer[100]; // we don't know the length, but the input is 5 or more? Actually, the first program's output is 5 chars, so we'll have 5 chars. The second program's output for 5 chars might be up to 5*? But the state machine might combine two chars into one digit.\n\n    Actually, the state machine for the second program:\n        It was designed for a ternary code: \n          '.' -> 0\n          '-.' -> 1\n          '--' -> 2\n\n        But we are feeding it arbitrary characters. We treat every char that is not '.' as '-'.\n\n        We traverse the string:\n\n          for each char c in S:\n            if c == '.':\n               if s is 1:\n                 output '1'\n                 s = 0\n               else:\n                 output '0'\n            else: // c is not '.' (so treat as '-')\n               if s is 1:\n                 output '2'\n                 s = 0\n               else:\n                 s = 1\n\n        After the loop, if s is 1, we have a pending '-' that hasn't been processed? But the original program doesn't output anything. So we leave it.\n\n    We will simulate and store the output in a buffer.\n\nThird program:\n\n  Take the string from the second program's output and convert to an integer.\n\n  Then find the next prime number >= that integer, but if the number is even and not 2, then start from the next odd.\n\n  Steps for the third program:\n\n    x = atoi(second_output);\n\n    if (x < 2) x = 2;\n    else if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n\n    while (1) {\n        // check if x is prime\n        if (x == 2) break;\n        int is_prime = 1;\n        int sqrt_num = sqrt(x);\n        for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt_num; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) {\n                is_prime = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (is_prime) break;\n        x += 2;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\nBut note: the third program in Java has a condition: it starts by ensuring x is odd (if not 2). Then it checks from 3 to sqrt(x) by step 2.\n\nHowever, what if x is 2? Then we break immediately.\n\nBut in the loop, the condition: \n   if (x == 2) break; -> then we output 2.\n\nBut the original program does:\n\n   if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n   while (true) {\n        int i;\n        double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n        for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n            if (x % i == 0) break;\n        }\n        if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n        x += 2;\n   }\n\nWe can simulate similarly.\n\nBut note: the condition `i > sqrtNum` means that no divisor was found. We can do the same in C by having a flag.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nSummary of the C program:\n\n  #include <stdio.h>\n  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #include <string.h>\n  #include <math.h>\n  #include <stdbool.h>\n\n  int main() {\n      // Step 1: Read two time strings\n      char time1[6], time2[6];\n      scanf(\"%5s %5s\", time1, time2);\n\n      // Parse time1 and time2\n      int h1, m1, h2, m2;\n      sscanf(time1, \"%d:%d\", &h1, &m1);\n      sscanf(time2, \"%d:%d\", &h2, &m2);\n\n      // Convert to total minutes\n      int total1 = h1 * 60 + m1;\n      int total2 = h2 * 60 + m2;\n\n      // Subtract and wrap around to 24 hours\n      int diff = total1 - total2;\n      if (diff < 0) {\n          diff += 24 * 60;\n      }\n      int h = diff / 60;\n      int m = diff % 60;\n\n      // Format the result time as a string: HH:MM\n      char result_time[6]; // \"HH:MM\" + null -> 6 bytes\n      sprintf(result_time, \"%02d:%02d\", h, m);\n\n      // Now, result_time is the input to the second program.\n\n      // Step 2: Process the second program on result_time\n      // We'll simulate the state machine.\n      // We'll create a buffer for the output of the second program.\n      char second_output[100]; // we'll write digits here\n      int out_index = 0;\n      int s = 0; // state: initially false (0)\n\n      for (int i = 0; i < strlen(result_time); i++) {\n          char c = result_time[i];\n          if (c == '.') {\n              if (s) {\n                  second_output[out_index++] = '1';\n                  s = 0;\n              } else {\n                  second_output[out_index++] = '0';\n              }\n          } else {\n              if (s) {\n                  second_output[out_index++] = '2';\n                  s = 0;\n              } else {\n                  s = 1;\n              }\n          }\n      }\n      second_output[out_index] = '\\0'; // null-terminate\n\n      // Step 3: Convert the second_output string to an integer\n      int x = atoi(second_output);\n\n      // Step 4: Find the next prime >= x (with the same conditions as the third program)\n      if (x < 2) {\n          x = 2;\n      } else if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) {\n          x++;\n      }\n\n      while (1) {\n          if (x == 2) {\n              break;\n          }\n          bool is_prime = true;\n          int sqrt_num = (int)sqrt(x) + 1; // we do +1 to be safe, because of floating point inaccuracies. The original uses <= sqrt(x), so we can use i <= sqrt_num-1? or < sqrt_num?\n          // Alternatively, we can do: for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt_num; i+=2) but note: if x is 3, then sqrt_num=1, then the loop doesn't run -> prime.\n          // Let's do: sqrt_num = (int)sqrt(x); then i<=sqrt_num.\n          // But we already handled 2, so x>=3.\n          // Recompute sqrt_num without +1.\n          int sqrt_x = (int)sqrt(x);\n          int i;\n          for (i = 3; i <= sqrt_x; i += 2) {\n              if (x % i == 0) {\n                  is_prime = false;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          if (is_prime) {\n              break;\n          }\n          x += 2;\n      }\n\n      printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n      return 0;\n  }\n\nBut note: the third program's condition: \n   The original starts by increasing x if it is even (and not 2) to the next odd. Then it checks. Then if it breaks, it breaks the while.\n\n  However, what if x is 2? We break immediately.\n\n  Also, the atoi of an empty string or a string that doesn't start with digit? \n  The second_output string might be empty if there was no output? But the first program's output is at least 5 chars, and the second program will output something.\n\n  However, if the second_output is empty, then atoi returns 0, and then we set x=2.\n\n  But the second program will always output something? Not necessarily: if the input string is empty. But our string is \"HH:MM\", which is 5 chars, so there will be output.\n\n  Also, note: the state machine: if the string ends with a pending state (s=1), then it doesn't output anything. But the second_output might be partial. But we still have the earlier outputs.\n\n  For example, the string \"14:50\" produces \"22\", so x=22.\n\n  Then the third program: 22 is even and not 2, so set x=23. Then check 23: prime -> output 23.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Let's test with a small example.\n\n  Input for first program: \"00:00\" and \"00:01\" -> \n      total1 = 0, total2 = 1 -> diff = -1 -> then diff = 1439 -> h=23, m=59 -> \"23:59\"\n\n  Then second program on \"23:59\":\n      '2' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1 -> no output.\n      '3' -> not '.' -> state=1 -> output '2', state=0.\n      ':' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1.\n      '5' -> not '.' -> state=1 -> output '2', state=0.\n      '9' -> not '.' -> state=0 -> set state=1. [then end, so no output for the last state]\n      So the output is \"22\", then x=22 -> then next prime is 23.\n\n  Output: 23.\n\n  Another example: \n      First program: \"20:20\" and \"05:30\" -> \n          20:20 = 20*60+20 = 1220\n          05:30 = 5*60+30 = 330\n          diff = 1220-330 = 890 minutes = 14*60+50 -> \"14:50\"\n\n      Second program on \"14:50\":\n          '1' -> state0 -> becomes state1, no output.\n          '4' -> state1 -> output '2', state0.\n          ':' -> state0 -> becomes state1.\n          '5' -> state1 -> output '2', state0.\n          '0' -> state0 -> becomes state1. (then end, no output)\n          So output is \"22\", then x=22 -> then next prime is 23.\n\n  Output: 23.\n\n  But wait, the first example in the first program: \n        Input: \"20:20\" and \"05:30\" -> output \"14:50\" (which is printed in the first program) but in our chain, we then feed to second program and then third program to get 23.\n\n  The original standalone first program would output \"14:50\", and that's it.\n\n  But the chain output is 23.\n\n  This is the behavior of the chain.\n\n  Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n  Note: We must be cautious about the third program's prime finding.\n\n  Let me test the third program with x=22:\n\n      x is even and not 2 -> x becomes 23.\n      Then check 23: \n          sqrt(23) is about 4.79 -> so sqrt_x = 4.\n          for i from 3 to 4 (step 2): i=3 -> 23%3 !=0, then i=5 (but 5>4) -> so break -> prime.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Another test: x=24 -> becomes 25.\n      Check 25: sqrt(25)=5 -> i=3: 25%3 !=0, i=5: 25%5==0 -> not prime -> then 27 (not prime), 29 (prime).\n\n  But the program will break when it finds a divisor at 5? Then mark not prime, then x becomes 27? Then 27: i=3 -> divisible -> not prime -> then 29: prime.\n\n  However, in the loop, after increasing to 25, we then check and find it is not prime -> then we do x +=2 -> 27 -> then check 27: \n      sqrt(27)=5.1 -> sqrt_x=5.\n      i=3: 27%3==0 -> not prime -> then x=29.\n      Check 29: \n          i=3: 29%3!=0, i=5: 29%5!=0 -> prime.\n\n  So output 29.\n\n  But the next prime after 24 is 29? Actually, 24,25,26,27,28,29 -> yes.\n\n  However, note the condition: the third program starts by making x odd (if even) and then checks. Then if not prime, increases by 2 until prime.\n\n  So the program is correct.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  Note: We must include math.h for sqrt.\n\n  Also, the second program's output buffer: we are writing a string of digits. The string from the first program is 5 characters. The second program might output up to 5 digits? But in the worst-case, if the string is all '.', then we output 5 '0's. So 5 digits. But if there are states, it might be fewer. We allocated 100, which is safe.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Important: the first program's output is in the format with leading zeros? We used \"%02d\", so yes.\n\n  Now, write the C program."
