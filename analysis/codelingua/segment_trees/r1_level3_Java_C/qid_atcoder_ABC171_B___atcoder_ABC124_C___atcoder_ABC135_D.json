But note: the third program does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n            ... \n        } So the last row is at i = len2-1? Actually, we have len2 rows (from i=0 to i=len2-1). So the last row is at index len2-1. Therefore, we output dp[len2-1][5]. But note: the third program uses the entire string. We are processing all characters. However, we must test with a small example. Example: \n        First program: \n            n=3, k=2, array = [5, 3, 1] -> sorted: [1,3,5] -> S = 1+3 = 4. Then s1 = \"4\"\n        Second program: Forward pass: \n                a = \"4\", len=1 -> no change -> a1=0. Backward pass: b = \"4\", len=1 -> no change -> a2=0. F = min(0,0)=0. Then s2 = \"0\"\n        Third program: \n            len2=1, base=1.\n            i=0: c = '0' -> digit=0.\n            for pre in [0..12]: \n                i==0: only pre=0 -> ways=1.\n                new_rem = (1*0 + 0) % 13 = 0. dp[0][0] = 1. Then base = (1*10)%13 = 10. Then output dp[0][5] = 0. So we output 0. But 0 mod 13 is 0, which is not 5 -> so 0 is correct. Another example: First: n=2, k=2, [13, 5] -> sorted [5,13] -> S = 5+13=18. s1 = \"18\"\n        Second program: \n            Forward pass:\n                a = \"18\": \n                    i=1: compare '1' and '8' -> different -> no flip. -> a1=0. Backward pass:\n                b = \"18\":\n                    i=1: compare b[1]='8' and b[0]='1' -> different -> no flip. -> a2=0. F=0 -> s2=\"0\" -> output 0. But what if we have consecutive digits? Example: S=11 -> s1=\"11\"\n        Forward pass: \n            i=1: a[1]=='1' and a[0]=='1' -> same -> flip a[1] to '0'. Then a becomes \"10\". a1=1. Backward pass:\n            i=1: b[1]=='1' and b[0]=='1' -> same -> flip b[0] to '0'. Then b becomes \"01\". a2=1.\n        F=1 -> s2=\"1\"\n        Third program: \n            s2=\"1\": \n                i=0: digit=1. pre=0 -> ways=1. new_rem = (1*1+0) %13 = 1.\n                dp[0][1]=1. Output dp[0][5]=0. Another: S=5 -> s1=\"5\", then F=0 -> s2=\"0\" -> output 0. But note: we want the third program to output 1 if the number mod13 is 5. For F=5: \n            s2=\"5\": \n                dp[0][ (1*5+0) %13 ] = 1 -> so dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1. Therefore, the chain for S=5 would be: \n        Step1: S=5 -> s1=\"5\"\n        Step2: Forward: no flips -> F=0? Actually, the string \"5\" has length 1 -> no adjacent pairs -> F=0. Then s2=\"0\" -> output 0. So we never get 1? How do we get F=5? We need a string representation of S that, when passed to the second program, yields 5. Example: \n            Let S=5 -> string \"5\" -> second program outputs 0 -> then third program outputs 0. How to get 5? We need the second program to output 5. The second program outputs the number of flips. The flips are at most the length of the string. So to get 5, we need at least 5 flips. Example: \n            We need a string of digits that has many consecutive identical digits. Example: \"00000\" (five zeros) -> \n                Forward: \n                    i=1: flip to '1' -> becomes \"01\"\n                    then at i=2: now the string is \"010\", and we compare the second and third: \n                         '1' and '0' -> no flip. then i=3: compare third and fourth: '0' and '0' -> flip to '1' -> becomes \"0111\" -> wait, we are building sequentially. Actually, we must do sequentially:\n\n                    Start: \"00000\"\n                    i=1: change the second char (index1) to '1': becomes \"01000\" -> now we have:\n                         index0: '0', index1: '1' -> then i=2: compare index1 and index2: '1' and '0' -> no flip. i=2: no flip -> then i=3: compare index2 and index3: '0' and '0' -> flip index3 to '1': becomes \"01010\"\n                    then i=4: compare index3 and index4: '1' and '0' -> no flip. So a1 = 2. Backward: Start: \"00000\"\n                    i=4: compare index4 and index3: both '0' -> flip index3 to '1': becomes \"00010\"\n                    i=3: compare index3 and index2: '1' and '0' -> no flip. i=2: compare index2 and index1: '0' and '0' -> flip index1 to '1': becomes \"00110\"\n                    i=1: compare index1 and index0: '1' and '0' -> no flip. So a2=2. Then F=2. We need 5 flips? How about a string of 10 zeros: \"0000000000\"\n\n            Forward: \n                Step1: flip index1 -> becomes \"0100000000\"\n                Step2: index2: now we have '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                Step3: index3: '0' and next '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101000000\"\n                Step4: index4: '0' and '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101100000\"\n                Step5: index5: '0' and '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101101000\"\n                ... and so on. Actually, we flip every other adjacent pair? How many flips? The forward pass: we flip at positions 1,3,5,7,9 -> 5 flips. Then F=5. Then the third program: \n                s2 = \"5\" -> but wait, we have 5 flips -> so s2 = \"5\" (the string \"5\") Then the third program: \n                    dp[0][ (1*5+0) %13 ] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] = 1. Therefore, the entire chain outputs 1. So we have an example that outputs 1. Therefore, the program is written.",

But note: base might be negative? we are doing mod 13, so we can do:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13; But modulus of positive numbers: we can do:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13; Since base starts at 1, then 1, 10, 100 mod 13, etc.\n\n   But note: the third program does:\n\n        base = base * 10 % 13; So we do the same. However, there is a possibility of integer overflow? base is int, and 10 * base is at most 10*12 = 120 -> so no overflow. But let me do: base is updated as:\n\n        base0 = 1\n        base1 = 10 % 13 = 10\n        base2 = (10*10) % 13 = 100 % 13 = 9\n        base3 = (9*10) % 13 = 90 % 13 = 12\n        base4 = (12*10) % 13 = 120 % 13 = 3\n        base5 = (3*10) % 13 = 30 % 13 = 4\n        ... So we do modulus at each step. We'll do that. But note: the DP array: we are using i from 0 to len2-1. And we output dp[len2-1][5] mod MOD.",

Note: The third program's dp for the first row: \n        We only set for pre=0: \n            new_rem = (base * digit) % 13. And we set dp[0][new_rem] = 1. This is correct.

And the new_rem = (base * digit + pre) % 13.\n\n        But note: the base for the current digit is 10^i mod 13, and the digits are processed from right to left (so the rightmost digit is the first processed). This is equivalent to:\n\n            number = 0;\n            for (i=len-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                number = (number * 10 + digit[i]) % 13;\n            } Actually, no: the standard way is left-to-right?

Step2: base = 100 % 13 = 9, then digit=1: state = (9*1 + 10) % 13 = 19 % 13 = 6. But 123 mod 13: \n            123 / 13 = 9*13=117, remainder 6. -> so correct. However, the base is updated as base = base * 10 % 13. So for a fixed string, we can compute the mod 13 by the standard method. But note: the third program's DP for a fixed string without '?' is deterministic and we can compute the mod 13 by:\n\n            long rem = 0;\n            long base = 1;\n            for (int i = len-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                //",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Java programs into one C program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (atcoder_ABC171_B) reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers.\n    It sorts the array and sums the first k smallest elements, then outputs the sum.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC124_C) reads a string of '0's and '1's and computes the minimum number of changes needed so that adjacent characters are different.\n    It does this by trying two approaches: \n        - Forward: starting at index 1, if the current char is same as previous, flip it and count.\n        - Backward: starting at the end, if the current char is same as previous (looking backwards), flip the previous and count.\n    Then it outputs the minimum of the two counts.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string of digits and '?' and computes the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the entire number mod 13 is 5.\n    It uses dynamic programming over the string (from right to left) and mod 13.\n\n However, note: the output of the first program is an integer, which becomes the input to the second program? \n But the second program expects a string of '0' and '1'. \n\n But the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program? \n But the second program expects a string of '0' and '1'? This seems inconsistent.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output.\"\n\n And: \"Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\"\n\n So we are going to chain the three programs. However, the output of the first is an integer, which is then fed as input to the second? \n But the second program in the given code (atcoder_ABC124_C) reads a string. \n\n This indicates that the chain might not be directly from one to the next? Or perhaps we are misinterpreting the sequence.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n So the output of the first program (which is an integer) must be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string of '0' and '1'. \n\n This implies that the integer output by the first program is to be interpreted as a string? \n\n For example, if the first program outputs 101, then the second program would get the string \"101\". \n\n However, note that the first program outputs a single integer (without spaces) and then a newline. \n\n So we can convert the integer to a string to feed to the second program.\n\n Similarly, the output of the second program is an integer (the minimum number of changes) which we then feed to the third program? \n But the third program expects a string of digits and '?'. \n\n This does not match: the second program outputs an integer, and the third program expects a string that might contain '?'.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider the chain. \n\n The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". But note the three programs are independent and solve different problems. \n\n However, the problem states: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning that the entire chain of three programs must be simulated.\n\n How the chain works:\n   Program1: reads input (n, k, then n integers) -> outputs an integer (say X)\n   Then Program2: reads a string (which is the string representation of X) -> outputs an integer (say Y)\n   Then Program3: reads a string (which is the string representation of Y) -> but wait, the third program expects a string that may contain '?' and digits. \n        However, Y is an integer, so its string representation does not contain '?'. \n\n This doesn't match the third program's input requirement.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the three programs are run on the same initial input? \n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n After reading the problem again, I think we are misinterpreting the chain. The three programs are independent and are meant to be run in sequence, but the input to the entire chain is the input to the first program, and the output of the entire chain is the output of the last program. The intermediate programs take the output of the previous as their input.\n\n However, the input formats don't chain naturally. \n\n Let me look at the programs:\n\n Program1: \n   Input: \n        n k\n        a1 a2 ... an\n   Output: integer (the sum of the k smallest)\n\n Program2:\n   Input: a string (of '0's and '1's)\n   Output: integer (the minimum number of flips to make adjacent characters different)\n\n Program3:\n   Input: a string (of digits and '?')\n   Output: integer (the number of ways mod 1e9+7 such that the number mod 13 is 5)\n\n How do we chain?\n   Step1: Run Program1 on the initial input -> produces integer S.\n   Step2: Convert S to a string (without any extra spaces, just the digits) and use that as input to Program2.\n   Step3: Program2 produces an integer F (the flips). Convert F to a string and use as input to Program3? \n        But note: Program3 expects a string that may contain '?'. However, the string we are giving (which is the string representation of F) does not contain any '?'. \n        Therefore, the third program will treat it as a fixed string (with no '?') and compute the number of ways? \n\n        However, the third program's algorithm: \n          It iterates from right to left. For each position, if it's a digit, it uses that digit; if it's '?', it tries 0-9.\n\n        Since the string we are giving has no '?', the third program will compute the remainder mod 13 of the number represented by the string, and then check if that remainder is 5? \n        But note: the problem in the third program is: count the ways to assign the '?' so that the number mod 13 is 5. \n        If there are no '?', then there is exactly one way (if the number mod 13 is 5 then count=1, else 0).\n\n        So the third program's output for a string without '?' would be either 0 or 1.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain would do:\n   Input: the first program's input (n, k, and n integers)\n   Output: either 0 or 1 (if the number of flips F, when interpreted as a number, mod 13 is 5 then 1, else 0)\n\n But note: the chain is fixed: \n   Step1: compute S = sum of k smallest.\n   Step2: convert S to string, then compute F = min_flips for that string (which is a string of digits? but the digits are arbitrary? the string might have multiple digits, and the digits are 0-9, but the program expects only '0' and '1'? \n\n Here we have a problem: the second program expects the string to be composed of '0' and '1'. But the string we are giving is the decimal representation of an integer, which can have digits from '0' to '9'. \n\n This will break the second program because it only checks for '0' and '1'. \n\n Therefore, the chain as described doesn't make sense.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the three programs are run independently on the same input? \n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Given the ambiguity, we must stick to the literal requirement: \n   The entire sequence: \n        Program1 runs on the initial input and produces an output (an integer).\n        Program2 runs on the output of Program1 (which is a string representation of that integer) and produces an output (an integer).\n        Program3 runs on the output of Program2 (which is a string representation of that integer) and produces an output (an integer).\n\n However, the second program is designed for a string of '0' and '1'. If we feed it a string that contains digits other than '0' and '1', then the program will still run, but the logic might not make sense.\n\n But note the second program's logic:\n   It has two passes: \n        Forward: \n          for i from 1 to len-1:\n             if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n                 flip a[i] (if it was '1' set to '0', else set to '1') and count++.\n\n        Backward:\n          for i from len-1 down to 1:\n             if b[i] == b[i-1]:\n                 flip b[i-1] and count++.\n\n   The flip operation: \n        If the character is '1', set to '0'; otherwise set to '1'. \n\n   This operation is defined for any character? Actually, the program sets the character to either '0' or '1'. But if the initial character is not '0' or '1', then the flip operation might produce an unexpected result.\n\n   For example, if the character is '2', then in the forward pass: \n        if a[i] is '2' and a[i-1] is '2', then it will set a[i] to '1' (because the condition checks: if it's '1'? no, so else branch -> set to '1')? \n        Actually, the code:\n            if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n            else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n\n        So for a '2', it will become '1'. \n\n   Similarly, in the backward pass, if we have a '2', then when we see two adjacent '2's, we flip the previous one: \n        if b.charAt(i-1) is '1' then set to '0', else set to '1'. So a '2' becomes '1'.\n\n   But the problem is: the second program was designed for a string of '0' and '1'. The problem of alternating characters is defined for any alphabet? Actually, the problem in the original context is for a string of '0' and '1'. \n\n   However, the program does not check for invalid input. So if we feed it a string with other digits, it will still run and produce a number, but that number might not be meaningful.\n\n Given the instructions, we must simulate the chain exactly as the three programs would run in sequence: \n        Step1: Run the first program on the initial input to get an integer S.\n        Step2: Convert S to a string (in base 10) and run the second program on that string to get an integer F.\n        Step3: Convert F to a string (in base 10) and run the third program on that string to get an integer (either 0 or 1, because the string has no '?') and output that integer.\n\n But note: the third program's algorithm for a string without '?' is to check the entire number mod 13. So the output is 1 if the number mod 13 is 5, else 0.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input: \n        n k\n        a1 a2 ... an\n\n   Steps:\n        S = sum of the k smallest numbers in the array.\n\n        Let S_str = string representation of S (in base 10, no extra spaces)\n\n        Then run the second program on S_str: \n            We get an integer F = min(forward_flips, backward_flips) for the string S_str.\n\n        Then let F_str = string representation of F (in base 10, no extra spaces)\n\n        Then run the third program on F_str: \n            Since F_str has no '?', we compute the number mod 13. \n            Then the output is 1 if (F mod 13 == 5) else 0.\n\n   Output: that 0 or 1.\n\n However, note: the second program might be doing something nonsensical for a string of arbitrary digits? \n But we are following the program exactly as written.\n\n Implementation in C:\n\n   We will:\n     1. Read the first input: n and k, then n integers.\n     2. Sort the array (or just get the k smallest) and compute S.\n     3. Convert S to a string (using sprintf) -> this is the input to the next step.\n     4. Process that string with the second program's logic to compute F.\n     5. Convert F to a string -> this is the input to the third step.\n     6. Process that string with the third program's logic to compute the result (0 or 1) and output it.\n\n   We must note the modulus (1e9+7) in the third program, but since the string has no '?', we don't need the full DP? \n        Actually, we can compute the number mod 13 directly? \n        But the third program's algorithm is designed for strings with '?'. However, if there are no '?', then the DP state is deterministic: \n            We traverse the string from right to left, and at each step we know the digit.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the entire number mod 13? But note: the number might be large? \n        However, the second program outputs an integer F which is the number of flips. The flips are at most the length of the string (which is the number of digits of S). \n        The length of S is at most the number of digits in the sum of k numbers (each number in the first input is an integer). \n\n        The constraints from the first program: \n            n and k up to 100,000? But the numbers are integers (we don't know the bounds, but typically up to 10^9). \n            So S is at most 10^5 * 10^9 = 10^14, which has at most 15 digits. Then F is at most 15 (because the string length is at most 15, and each flip operation might be done at most 15 times). \n\n        So F is a small integer (at most 15). Therefore, the string for the third program is a string representation of a small integer (at most 15). \n\n        Then we can compute the mod 13 of F directly? Actually, we can just do F % 13 and then check if it equals 5? \n        But note: the third program does a DP that goes from right to left. However, without '?' the DP is essentially:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 1   [base: no digits processed, remainder 0]\n            Then for each digit (from rightmost to leftmost) we update the state.\n\n        However, since the string is fixed, we can simulate:\n\n            number = F\n            mod = number % 13   [but note: the third program's DP does modulus in a base-10 expansion]\n\n        Actually, the DP in the third program does:\n\n            base = 1 (for the rightmost digit), then base = 10 % 13, then base = 100 % 13, etc.\n\n            For a fixed string without '?', the DP state at step i (processing the i-th digit from the right) is:\n\n                state = (digit_i * base + previous_state) % 13\n\n        But note: the modulus properties: we can compute the entire number mod 13 by:\n\n            num = 0;\n            for (i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                num = (num * 10 + (s[i]-'0')) % 13;\n            }\n\n        However, the program processes from right to left? \n\n        Actually, the program uses:\n\n            dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + dp[i-1][pre]) % MOD\n\n        for each digit. And the new_rem = (base * digit + pre) % 13.\n\n        But note: the base for the current digit is 10^i mod 13, and the digits are processed from right to left (so the rightmost digit is the first processed).\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            number = 0;\n            for (i=len-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                number = (number * 10 + digit[i]) % 13;\n            }\n\n        Actually, no: the standard way is left-to-right? \n\n        Let me do an example: \"123\" from right to left:\n\n            Step0 (rightmost digit): digit = 3, base = 1 -> state = 3.\n            Step1: base = 10, then digit=2: state = (10*2 + 3) % 13 = 23 % 13 = 10.\n            Step2: base = 100 % 13 = 9, then digit=1: state = (9*1 + 10) % 13 = 19 % 13 = 6.\n\n        But 123 mod 13: \n            123 / 13 = 9*13=117, remainder 6. -> so correct.\n\n        However, the base is updated as base = base * 10 % 13.\n\n        So for a fixed string, we can compute the mod 13 by the standard method.\n\n        But note: the third program's DP for a fixed string without '?' is deterministic and we can compute the mod 13 by:\n\n            long rem = 0;\n            long base = 1;\n            for (int i = len-1; i>=0; i--) {\n                // Actually, the program processes from right to left, so we traverse the string from last character to first? \n                // But in the program: \n                //   cs = the string, and it does: \n                //        for i from 0 to len-1: \n                //          digit = cs[cs.length-1-i]   --> so the i-th character from the right.\n                // So we can do:\n\n                // We have the string in normal order (the first character is the most significant).\n                // But the program does the least significant digit first.\n\n            }\n\n        Actually, we can just compute:\n\n            long num = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                num = (num * 10 + (s[i]-'0')) % 13;\n            }\n\n        But wait: \n            \"123\": \n                i0: num = (0*10+1)=1\n                i1: num = (1*10+2)=12\n                i2: num = (12*10+3)=123 % 13 = 6 -> same as above.\n\n        So both methods are equivalent? \n\n        Actually, modulus is linear and the left-to-right method is standard.\n\n        Therefore, for a string without '?' we can compute the mod 13 by:\n\n            long res = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {\n                res = (res * 10 + (s[i]-'0')) % 13;\n            }\n\n        Then the output is 1 if res==5, else 0.\n\n        But note: the third program does modulo 1e9+7? However, without '?' the result is either 0 or 1, so we can do:\n\n            if (res == 5) \n                output 1\n            else \n                output 0\n\n        And we don't need the DP.\n\n        However, to be faithful to the original program, we should simulate the DP? \n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n        And the original third program for a string without '?' would run the DP and then output dp[last][5] which would be 1 if the entire number mod 13 is 5, else 0.\n\n        So we can do the same: \n            We know the string has no '?', so we can run the DP as in the third program, but without the loop for '?' and without the inner loop for 0-9. We just use the fixed digit.\n\n        However, since the number F is small (at most 15, so the string length is at most 2 or 3), we can run the DP without performance issues.\n\n        But note: the DP in the third program is written for a string that may be long? but in our case the string for the third step is short (max 2 or 3 digits). \n\n        We'll write the DP as in the third program, but without the '?' branch? Actually, we can do:\n\n            char *s = ...; // the string representation of F\n            int len = strlen(s);\n            long long dp[len][13];   // we'll use 0-indexed for the positions, and 13 states for mod.\n            // But note: the original program processes from right to left. We'll do the same.\n\n        Steps for the third program without '?':\n\n            base = 1\n            for i=0 to len-1: \n                char c = s[len-1-i];\n                if c is not '?', then digit = c - '0'\n                then for each remainder pre (0..12):\n                    new_rem = (base * digit + pre) % 13\n                    dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0))) % MOD\n\n            But note: the base case: for i==0, the state pre is 0? and then we add 1 for the base state? \n\n            Actually, the original program: \n                dp[i][new_rem] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 : 0))\n\n            This means for the first digit (i=0) and pre=0, we add 1. For pre!=0, we add 0.\n\n            Then we update base: base = (base * 10) % 13.\n\n        We can do the same.\n\n        However, note: the third program uses a modulo of 1e9+7. Even though the numbers are small, we must do mod 1e9+7 for the counts.\n\n        But the counts without '?' are either 0 or 1? Actually, no: the DP state at step i might accumulate multiple paths? \n        But without '?' there is only one way. So the DP state for the correct remainder at each step should be 1? \n\n        Actually, the DP for the fixed string is deterministic: there is exactly one path. So the entire DP array will have one non-zero entry at each row.\n\n        Therefore, we can also compute the remainder as above and then output 1 if remainder==5 else 0.\n\n        But to be safe, we'll write the DP as in the third program, but without the loop for the '?'. We'll do:\n\n            for each i (from 0 to len-1):\n                digit = s[len-1-i] - '0';   // because the string has no '?' and is digits only.\n                for each pre in [0..12]:\n                    new_rem = (base * digit + pre) % 13;\n                    dp[i][new_rem] = (dp[i][new_rem] + (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0?1:0))) % MOD;\n\n        Then output dp[len-1][5].\n\n        However, note: the original program uses a 2D dp array of size [len][13]. We can do that.\n\n        But note: the base case: \n            For i=0, we consider pre from 0 to 12: \n                Only pre=0 gives 1, others 0.\n\n        Then for the first digit (i=0): \n            new_rem = (base * digit + 0) % 13 = (1 * digit) % 13.\n            So dp[0][digit] = 1.\n\n        Then for the next digit, we use the state from the first row.\n\n        This is the standard base-10 expansion mod 13 from right to left.\n\n        We'll do that.\n\n   However, note: the modulus for the DP counts is 1e9+7. Since the counts are at most 1 (for a fixed string) we don't need to worry about overflow? But we do modulus anyway.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will:\n        Step 1: Read n, k, and the array of n integers.\n        Step 2: Compute S = sum of k smallest.\n        Step 3: Convert S to a string (call it s1).\n        Step 4: Process s1 with the second program's logic to get F.\n        Step 5: Convert F to a string (call it s2).\n        Step 6: Process s2 with the third program's logic (with DP for a fixed string) to get the result = dp[len2-1][5] (mod 1e9+7) and output it.\n\n   However, note: the second program is designed for a string of '0' and '1'. We are feeding it a string of arbitrary digits. \n        But we are going to run the exact same code as the second program, which will flip any digit that is the same as the previous to the opposite (if it's '1' set to '0', otherwise set to '1'). \n\n        This might not be what was intended for the original problem, but we are simulating the chain.\n\n   We must write the second program's logic for any string of digits? \n\n        The second program does:\n\n            a1 = 0, a2 = 0;\n            StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder(s);   // we'll create a copy of the string for forward pass.\n            StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder(s);   // for backward pass.\n\n            Forward pass:\n                for i from 1 to len-1:\n                    if a[i] == a[i-1]:\n                         if a[i] == '1' then set a[i] to '0'; else set to '1'; then a1++.\n\n            Backward pass:\n                for i from len-1 down to 1:\n                    if b[i] == b[i-1]:\n                         if b[i-1]=='1' then set b[i-1] to '0'; else set to '1'; then a2++.\n\n            Then F = min(a1, a2);\n\n        We'll do the same in C. Note: we are modifying the string for the forward and backward passes.\n\n        But note: the string is the decimal representation of S. It might have any digit from '0' to '9'. \n\n        The flip operations:\n\n            Forward: \n                if a[i] == a[i-1] then:\n                    if a[i] is '1', set to '0'; else set to '1'. (so if it's '2', it becomes '1'; if it's '3', it becomes '1'; ...)\n\n            Similarly, backward:\n                if b[i]==b[i-1] then:\n                    if b[i-1] is '1', set to '0'; else set to '1'. (so if it's '2', then set to '1'? but note: we are setting the previous character, i.e., b[i-1].)\n\n        We must be cautious: we are modifying the array.\n\n        We'll create two copies of the string for the two passes.\n\n        We'll use: \n            char *a = strdup(s1);\n            char *b = strdup(s1);\n\n        Then do the passes.\n\n        Then free the copies.\n\n   Summary of the C program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <limits.h>\n        #include <ctype.h>\n        #define ll long long\n\n        // Step 1: Read the input\n        int main() {\n            int n, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n            int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: sort the array and compute S (the sum of the first k smallest)\n            // We can use qsort, but note: k might be 0?

we are doing mod 13, so we can do:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13;\n\n        But modulus of positive numbers: we can do:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % 13;\n\n        Since base starts at 1, then 1, 10, 100 mod 13, etc.\n\n   But note: the third program does:\n\n        base = base * 10 % 13;\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n   However, there is a possibility of integer overflow? base is int, and 10 * base is at most 10*12 = 120 -> so no overflow.\n\n   But let me do: base is updated as:\n\n        base0 = 1\n        base1 = 10 % 13 = 10\n        base2 = (10*10) % 13 = 100 % 13 = 9\n        base3 = (9*10) % 13 = 90 % 13 = 12\n        base4 = (12*10) % 13 = 120 % 13 = 3\n        base5 = (3*10) % 13 = 30 % 13 = 4\n        ... \n\n        So we do modulus at each step.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   But note: the DP array: we are using i from 0 to len2-1.\n\n   And we output dp[len2-1][5] mod MOD.\n\n   However, the third program outputs dp[dp.length-1][5] (which is the last row, 5-th column).\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   But note: the third program does:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n            ... \n        }\n\n        So the last row is at i = len2-1? \n\n        Actually, we have len2 rows (from i=0 to i=len2-1). So the last row is at index len2-1.\n\n   Therefore, we output dp[len2-1][5].\n\n   But note: the third program uses the entire string. We are processing all characters.\n\n   However, we must test with a small example.\n\n   Example: \n        First program: \n            n=3, k=2, array = [5, 3, 1] -> sorted: [1,3,5] -> S = 1+3 = 4.\n        Then s1 = \"4\"\n        Second program: \n            Forward pass: \n                a = \"4\", len=1 -> no change -> a1=0.\n            Backward pass: \n                b = \"4\", len=1 -> no change -> a2=0.\n            F = min(0,0)=0.\n        Then s2 = \"0\"\n        Third program: \n            len2=1, base=1.\n            i=0: c = '0' -> digit=0.\n            for pre in [0..12]: \n                i==0: only pre=0 -> ways=1.\n                new_rem = (1*0 + 0) % 13 = 0.\n                dp[0][0] = 1.\n\n            Then base = (1*10)%13 = 10.\n\n            Then output dp[0][5] = 0.\n\n        So we output 0.\n\n        But 0 mod 13 is 0, which is not 5 -> so 0 is correct.\n\n   Another example: \n        First: n=2, k=2, [13, 5] -> sorted [5,13] -> S = 5+13=18.\n        s1 = \"18\"\n        Second program: \n            Forward pass:\n                a = \"18\": \n                    i=1: compare '1' and '8' -> different -> no flip. -> a1=0.\n            Backward pass:\n                b = \"18\":\n                    i=1: compare b[1]='8' and b[0]='1' -> different -> no flip. -> a2=0.\n            F=0 -> s2=\"0\" -> output 0.\n\n   But what if we have consecutive digits? \n        Example: S=11 -> s1=\"11\"\n        Forward pass: \n            i=1: a[1]=='1' and a[0]=='1' -> same -> flip a[1] to '0'. Then a becomes \"10\". a1=1.\n        Backward pass:\n            i=1: b[1]=='1' and b[0]=='1' -> same -> flip b[0] to '0'. Then b becomes \"01\". a2=1.\n        F=1 -> s2=\"1\"\n        Third program: \n            s2=\"1\": \n                i=0: digit=1.\n                pre=0 -> ways=1.\n                new_rem = (1*1+0) %13 = 1.\n                dp[0][1]=1.\n            Output dp[0][5]=0.\n\n   Another: S=5 -> s1=\"5\", then F=0 -> s2=\"0\" -> output 0.\n\n   But note: we want the third program to output 1 if the number mod13 is 5. \n        For F=5: \n            s2=\"5\": \n                dp[0][ (1*5+0) %13 ] = 1 -> so dp[0][5]=1 -> output 1.\n\n   Therefore, the chain for S=5 would be: \n        Step1: S=5 -> s1=\"5\"\n        Step2: \n            Forward: no flips -> F=0? \n                Actually, the string \"5\" has length 1 -> no adjacent pairs -> F=0.\n            Then s2=\"0\" -> output 0.\n\n        So we never get 1? \n\n        How do we get F=5? \n        We need a string representation of S that, when passed to the second program, yields 5.\n\n        Example: \n            Let S=5 -> string \"5\" -> second program outputs 0 -> then third program outputs 0.\n\n        How to get 5? \n            We need the second program to output 5.\n\n        The second program outputs the number of flips. The flips are at most the length of the string. \n        So to get 5, we need at least 5 flips. \n\n        Example: \n            We need a string of digits that has many consecutive identical digits.\n\n            Example: \"00000\" (five zeros) -> \n                Forward: \n                    i=1: flip to '1' -> becomes \"01\"\n                    then at i=2: now the string is \"010\", and we compare the second and third: \n                         '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                    then i=3: compare third and fourth: '0' and '0' -> flip to '1' -> becomes \"0111\" -> wait, we are building sequentially.\n\n                Actually, we must do sequentially:\n\n                    Start: \"00000\"\n                    i=1: change the second char (index1) to '1': becomes \"01000\" -> now we have:\n                         index0: '0', index1: '1' -> then i=2: compare index1 and index2: '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                    i=2: no flip -> then i=3: compare index2 and index3: '0' and '0' -> flip index3 to '1': becomes \"01010\"\n                    then i=4: compare index3 and index4: '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n\n                    So a1 = 2.\n\n                Backward: \n                    Start: \"00000\"\n                    i=4: compare index4 and index3: both '0' -> flip index3 to '1': becomes \"00010\"\n                    i=3: compare index3 and index2: '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                    i=2: compare index2 and index1: '0' and '0' -> flip index1 to '1': becomes \"00110\"\n                    i=1: compare index1 and index0: '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                    So a2=2.\n\n                Then F=2.\n\n            We need 5 flips? \n\n            How about a string of 10 zeros: \"0000000000\"\n\n            Forward: \n                Step1: flip index1 -> becomes \"0100000000\"\n                Step2: index2: now we have '1' and '0' -> no flip.\n                Step3: index3: '0' and next '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101000000\"\n                Step4: index4: '0' and '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101100000\"\n                Step5: index5: '0' and '0' -> flip: becomes \"0101101000\"\n                ... and so on.\n\n                Actually, we flip every other adjacent pair? \n\n                How many flips? \n                    The forward pass: we flip at positions 1,3,5,7,9 -> 5 flips.\n\n            Then F=5.\n\n            Then the third program: \n                s2 = \"5\" -> but wait, we have 5 flips -> so s2 = \"5\" (the string \"5\")\n                Then the third program: \n                    dp[0][ (1*5+0) %13 ] = 1 -> then output dp[0][5] = 1.\n\n            Therefore, the entire chain outputs 1.\n\n   So we have an example that outputs 1.\n\n   Therefore, the program is written.\n\n   Note: We must free the allocated memory for the copies in the second program step.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the second program might be inefficient for long strings? \n        But the string s1 (which is the string representation of S) has at most 20 digits.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #define ll long long\n\n        int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n            return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);\n        }\n\n        int main() {\n            // Step 1: Read n, k, and the array\n            int n, k;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n            int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Step 2: sort and compute S\n            qsort(arr, n, sizeof(int), compare);\n            ll S = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n                S += arr[i];\n            }\n            free(arr);\n\n            // Convert S to string s1\n            char s1[25]; // enough for 20 digits\n            sprintf(s1, \"%lld\", S);\n            int len1 = strlen(s1);\n\n            // Step 4: second program\n            char *a = strdup(s1);\n            char *b = strdup(s1);\n            int a1 = 0, a2 = 0;\n\n            // Forward pass: i from 1 to len1-1\n            for (int i = 1; i < len1; i++) {\n                if (a[i] == a[i-1]) {\n                    if (a[i] == '1') {\n                        a[i] = '0';\n                    } else {\n                        a[i] = '1';\n                    }\n                    a1++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Backward pass: i from len1-1 down to 1\n            for (int i = len1-1; i > 0; i--) {\n                if (b[i] == b[i-1]) {\n                    if (b[i-1] == '1') {\n                        b[i-1] = '0';\n                    } else {\n                        b[i-1] = '1';\n                    }\n                    a2++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            free(a);\n            free(b);\n\n            int F = (a1 < a2) ?
