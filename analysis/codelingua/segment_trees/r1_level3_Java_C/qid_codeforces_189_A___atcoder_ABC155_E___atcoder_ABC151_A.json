But to be safe, we output without newline. However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are only outputting one character at the end. Implementation details:\n\n  For the first program:\n\n    We note that the original Java program sets:\n        int maxn = 4010;\n        int [] dp = new int[maxn];   // size 4010\n\n    But note: the loop in the first program goes from j = arr[i] to dp.length-1 (which is 4009). The original dp array is of length 4010. However, the input n is at most 4000? Because maxn is 4010 and the loop for j goes up to dp.length-1 (which is 4009). We can set:\n        #define MAXN 4010\n\n    Steps for the first program: Initialize an array dp of size MAXN (4010) with:\n            for i from 0 to n-1: dp[i] = INT_MIN (but note: the original sets for i in [0, n-1] to MIN_VALUE, and dp[0]=0)\n            Actually, the original sets dp[0]=0 and then for the rest up to n-1? Actually, the loop for i in [0, n) sets dp[i]=MIN_VALUE. But note: the original sets dp[0]=0 and then the rest from 1 to n-1? Actually, the initialization:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n            } This sets dp[0..n-1] to MIN_VALUE, and then sets dp[0]=0. Then the nested loops:\n\n            for each of the three coins (a, b, c) in the array `arr`:\n                for j from the coin value to MAXN-1:\n                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)\n\n        Then output dp[n]. Important: the dp array in the original is of length maxn (4010). We must do the same. For the second program:\n\n    The original Java program:\n\n        String number = ... (the input string, which we get from the first program's output, so we have it in str1) It creates an array `digits` of length = number.length()+1. Then it reverses the string and stores each character as a digit (from char to int) in the array. Then it processes from the least significant digit (which is at index0) to the most significant.",

But the problem says the number can be up to 10^1000000, so the string is 1000001 digits. Then we need an array of 1000003? However, the Java program does not get an exception? Let me test with a small example: \"5\"\n\n            digits = new int[1+1] = [0,0] (initially zeros? but then we set: \n                i=0: digits[0] = '5' (from the string \"5\") -> so digits[0]=5, digits[1]=0. Then processing:\n                i=0: \n                    digits[0]=5 -> then check: 5==5 -> then check digits[1] (which is 0) >=5? -> false -> so we add 5 to bills -> bills=5.\n                i=1: digits[1]=0 -> then 0<5 -> add 0 -> bills=5. Then output 5.\n\n          Example: \"9\" \n            digits[0]=9, digits[1]=0.\n            i=0: 9>=6 -> so we do: digits[1]++ -> becomes 1, and bills += 10-9=1 -> bills=1.\n            i=1: digits[1]=1 -> then 1<5 -> bills+=1 -> total=2. Example: \"10\" The string is \"10\", so L=2. digits[0]=0, digits[1]=1, digits[2]=0 (from initialization? but note: the array is of size 3? indices 0,1,2? Then:\n                i=0: digits[0]=0 -> bills=0. i=1: digits[1]=1 -> bills=1 -> total=1.\n                i=2: digits[2]=0 -> bills=0 -> total=1? But the expected answer for 10 is 1? (because we can use one 10-yen bill). However, the known solution for the problem uses:\n\n            n = \"10\"\n            reverse: \"01\" -> then we add a sentinel? Actually, the known solution in C++:\n\n            #include <iostream>\n            #include <string>\n            #include <algorithm>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                string n;\n                cin >> n;\n                reverse(n.begin(), n.end());\n                n += '0';   // add a sentinel at the end (so now the string has one extra digit at the end, which is '0')\n                int ans = 0;\n                int carry = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++) {\n                    int x = n[i] - '0' + carry;\n                    if (x < 5) {\n                        ans += x;\n                        carry = 0;\n                    } else if (x == 5) {\n                        if (i < n.size()-1 && n[i+1]-'0' >= 5) {\n                            carry = 1;\n                            ans += 10 - x;\n                        } else {\n                            ans += x;\n                            carry = 0;\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        carry = 1;\n                        ans += 10 - x;\n                    }\n                }\n                cout << ans << endl;\n            } So the known solution adds a sentinel and then the loop runs for the entire string (including the added sentinel) but not beyond.",

But the first program: the input n is at most 4000? Then the first program outputs at most 4000 (if a=b=c=1) or less. So the string for the second program is at most 4 digits. Then the second program: the output is an integer (the number of bills) which is at most around 4000? (if we use 1-yen bills) or less. So the string for the third program is at most 4 digits. Therefore, the buffer of 20 is safe. Let me test with a small example:\n\n      First program: Input: n=5, a=5, b=3, c=2 -> \n          dp[0]=0\n          Then for coin=5: j from 5 to 4009: dp[5]=max(dp[5], dp[0]+1)=1 -> so dp[5]=1. Then for coin=3: j from 3 to 4009: \n              j=3: dp[3]=max(INT_MIN, dp[0]+1)=1 -> dp[3]=1\n              j=5: dp[5]=max(1, dp[2]+1) -> dp[2] is INT_MIN -> so stays 1 -> but wait, we haven't processed coin=2? Then for coin=2: \n              j=2: dp[2]=1\n              j=3: dp[3]=max(1, dp[1]? -> dp[1] is INT_MIN -> so stays 1 -> but then j=5: dp[5]=max(1, dp[3]+1=2) -> so dp[5]=2. Then output x=2. Then second program: Input string \"2\"\n          digits: [2] -> then we allocate digits of size 1+2=3 -> [2,0,0]\n          Process i=0: \n              digits[0]=2 -> <5 -> bills=2. i=1: digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=2. Then y=2. Then third program: Input string \"2\" -> first char '2' -> output '3' So we output '3'. However, the original first program for (5,5,3,2) outputs 2? We have two pieces: 5 can be cut as 3+2 -> two pieces? But the problem of the first program: \"Cut Ribbon\" -> maximize the number of pieces. The maximum pieces for n=5 with pieces 5,3,2: \n          We can use one piece of 5 -> 1 piece. Or we can use one piece of 3 and one piece of 2 -> 2 pieces. So 2 is correct. Then the chain: \n      Input: 5 5 3 2 -> first program outputs 2 -> second program outputs 2 -> third program outputs '3'\n\n  But the original third program: \n      Input \"2\" -> outputs the next character of '2' -> which is '3'. Therefore, the output of the entire chain is '3'. We write the C program accordingly. Note: The RemRing class in the third Java file is not used. We ignore it. Let's code accordingly.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Java programs into a single C program.\n The plan:\n 1. The first program (codeforces_189_A) reads an integer `n` and three integers `a, b, c`.\n    It then computes the maximum number of pieces (using coins of sizes a, b, c) to break a ribbon of length `n`.\n    We will capture the output of this program (which is an integer) and pass it as input to the next program.\n\n 2. The second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) reads a string (a number) and then computes the minimum number of bills needed for a payment.\n    However, note that the first program outputs an integer. So the second program in the chain would take that integer as a string.\n\n    But wait: the original second program expects a string of digits. The first program outputs an integer (say `x`). \n    Then the second program would read the string representation of `x`.\n\n    However, note: the second program in the chain is atcoder_ABC155_E. It expects a string (the number) and then processes it.\n\n    But the first program outputs an integer. So we must convert the integer output of the first program into a string for the second program.\n\n 3. The third program (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a single character and outputs the next character in the alphabet.\n\n    However, the second program outputs an integer (the number of bills). Then the third program would read that integer? \n    But the third program expects a string of length 1? \n\n    Actually, the third program reads a string and then outputs the next character of the first character of the string.\n\n    But note: the second program outputs an integer (say `y`). So we have to convert that integer to a string? \n    Then the third program would take the string representation of `y` and then take the first character and add 1.\n\n    However, the original chain:\n\n        Program1: reads n, a, b, c -> outputs an integer (say x)\n        Program2: reads a string (which is the string representation of x) -> outputs an integer (say y)\n        Program3: reads a string (which is the string representation of y) -> outputs the next character of the first character of that string.\n\n    But note: the third program only reads one line and takes the first character. So if the output of program2 is \"123\", then the third program would take '1' and output '2'.\n\n    However, this chain does not make logical sense? But we are just translating the sequence.\n\n Steps in the C program:\n\n  We are going to do:\n\n  Step 1: Read the initial input (for the first program): four integers: n, a, b, c.\n\n  Step 2: Run the logic of the first program to compute an integer result (x).\n\n  Step 3: Convert the integer x to a string (this string will be the input for the second program).\n\n  Step 4: Run the logic of the second program on that string to compute an integer y (the number of bills).\n\n  Step 5: Convert the integer y to a string (this string will be the input for the third program).\n\n  Step 6: Run the logic of the third program: take the first character of that string and output the next character (i.e., the character code plus one).\n\n  However, note: the third program only reads one character? Actually, it reads a string and then takes the first character.\n\n  But the problem says: the entire sequence must be transformed without I/O in the middle, except the first reads and the last writes.\n\n  So we must avoid doing any I/O in between. Therefore, we will:\n\n    - Read the initial input (n, a, b, c) with scanf.\n    - Compute the result of the first program (x) and store it.\n    - Convert x to a string (without printing) and then use that string as input for the second program.\n    - The second program then computes y (an integer) from that string.\n    - Convert y to a string and then use that string as input for the third program.\n    - The third program then takes the first character of that string, adds 1, and prints that character.\n\n  But note: the third program does not output a newline? The original Java program uses `printf(\"%c\", ...)`. So we'll output a single character.\n\n  However, the original third program does not output a newline? But in the example, if the input for the third program is \"a\", then it outputs \"b\". \n\n  But wait: the original third program reads a string and then outputs the next character of the first character. \n\n  Example: \n      Input: \"a\" -> Output: 'b'\n      Input: \"z\" -> Output: '{' (because 'z' + 1 is the next ASCII character)\n\n  But note: the output of the second program is an integer. So the string we pass to the third program is the string representation of that integer.\n\n  Example: \n      If the second program outputs 65, then the string is \"65\". The first character is '6'. Then we output '7'.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" meaning the entire chain.\n\n  But the chain:\n\n      Original chain: \n          Input to first program: four integers (n, a, b, c)\n          Output of first program: integer x (printed to stdout)\n          Then the second program reads that integer as a string (from stdin) and outputs an integer y (to stdout)\n          Then the third program reads that integer y as a string (from stdin) and outputs the next character of the first character.\n\n      Our combined program must do the same without intermediate I/O.\n\n  How to structure:\n\n      We will have:\n          int main() {\n              // Step 1: Read n, a, b, c\n              int n, a, b, c;\n              scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b, &c);\n\n              // Step 2: First program logic (computes x = dp[n])\n              int x = run_first_program(n, a, b, c);\n\n              // Step 3: Convert x to a string (we need to allocate a buffer for the string representation of x)\n              char str1[20]; // enough for an integer\n              sprintf(str1, \"%d\", x);\n\n              // Step 4: Second program logic (takes the string and computes y = bills)\n              long y = run_second_program(str1);   // note: the second program uses a string of digits\n\n              // Step 5: Convert y to a string\n              char str2[20]; // enough for a long integer\n              sprintf(str2, \"%ld\", y);\n\n              // Step 6: Third program logic: take the first character of str2, add 1, and output that character.\n              char result_char = str2[0] + 1;\n              printf(\"%c\\n\", result_char);   // note: the original third program doesn't output a newline? \n              // But the original third program: \n              //      System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n              // This does not output a newline. However, in C, if we don't output a newline, the output might not be flushed? \n              // But the problem says to behave identically. So we output without newline? \n              // However, the problem says \"behaves identically\", meaning the output must be the same.\n\n              // But note: the third program in the chain is the last one and outputs a single character without newline.\n\n          }\n\n  However, the original third program does not output a newline. So we should not output a newline.\n\n  But wait: the original chain: the third program outputs a single character and then the program ends. \n  Without a newline, the terminal might not show the output until the program exits? That is acceptable.\n\n  But to be safe, we output without newline.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\" and we are only outputting one character at the end.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n  For the first program:\n\n    We note that the original Java program sets:\n        int maxn = 4010;\n        int[] dp = new int[maxn];   // size 4010\n\n    But note: the loop in the first program goes from j = arr[i] to dp.length-1 (which is 4009). \n    The original dp array is of length 4010.\n\n    However, the input n is at most 4000? Because maxn is 4010 and the loop for j goes up to dp.length-1 (which is 4009). \n\n    We can set:\n        #define MAXN 4010\n\n    Steps for the first program:\n\n        Initialize an array dp of size MAXN (4010) with:\n            for i from 0 to n-1: dp[i] = INT_MIN (but note: the original sets for i in [0, n-1] to MIN_VALUE, and dp[0]=0)\n            Actually, the original sets dp[0]=0 and then for the rest up to n-1? Actually, the loop for i in [0, n) sets dp[i]=MIN_VALUE.\n\n        But note: the original sets dp[0]=0 and then the rest from 1 to n-1? Actually, the initialization:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n            }\n\n        This sets dp[0..n-1] to MIN_VALUE, and then sets dp[0]=0.\n\n        Then the nested loops:\n\n            for each of the three coins (a, b, c) in the array `arr`:\n                for j from the coin value to MAXN-1:\n                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - coin] + 1)\n\n        Then output dp[n].\n\n    Important: the dp array in the original is of length maxn (4010). We must do the same.\n\n  For the second program:\n\n    The original Java program:\n\n        String number = ... (the input string, which we get from the first program's output, so we have it in str1)\n\n        It creates an array `digits` of length = number.length()+1.\n\n        Then it reverses the string and stores each character as a digit (from char to int) in the array.\n\n        Then it processes from the least significant digit (which is at index0) to the most significant.\n\n        We note: the original program uses an array `digits` that has an extra element at the end (for carry).\n\n        Steps:\n\n            bills = 0\n            for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive? because the array is of length number.length()+1, so indices 0..number.length())\n                if (digits[i] == 10) -> then set digits[i]=0 and carry to next (digits[i+1]++)\n\n                Then:\n                  if digits[i] < 5: bills += digits[i]\n                  else if digits[i] == 5: \n                      if the next digit (digits[i+1]) >=5 then we do a carry (so we add 1 to the next) and then bills +=5? \n                      but note: the original adds 5 regardless? Then if the next digit is >=5, we do a carry? \n                  else: (>=6) then we add 1 to the next (carry) and then bills += (10 - digits[i])\n\n            Then output bills.\n\n        However, note: the array `digits` was initialized to have one extra element at the end (for the potential carry beyond the most significant digit). \n        The original program does: \n            for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++)   // because digits has length = number.length()+1, so indices 0..number.length()\n\n        But note: the last digit (most significant) is stored at the highest index? Actually, the string is reversed: \n            The original string: \"123\" -> \n                digits[0] = 3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, and then digits[3] is 0 initially? \n\n        Then when processing i=0 (the least significant) to i = number.length() (which is 3 in this example, so the extra element).\n\n        We have to be cautious: the array `digits` for the string of length L has indices 0 to L-1 for the digits, and then index L is initially 0.\n\n        We must allocate an array of integers of length (len+1) for the digits.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let len = strlen(str1)   // the string we got from the first program's output.\n\n          We create an array `digits` of size len+1 (so indices 0..len) and initialize to 0.\n\n          Then we reverse the string: the original reverses the string and stores each character as a digit.\n\n          Actually: \n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = str1[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n          But note: the original uses the entire string? Yes.\n\n          However, the string might have leading zeros? But it's the string representation of an integer, so no leading zeros? \n          But the integer could be 0? Then the string is \"0\", then len=1, and digits[0]=0.\n\n          Then we process i from 0 to len (inclusive). \n\n          We note: the array `digits` has an element at index `len` (which was initially 0) and beyond that? We allocated only len+1, so we cannot access beyond len.\n\n          But the loop condition is `i <= len` (which is the same as i from 0 to len). \n\n          However, when i is len, then we look at digits[i] (which is the extra element) and then we might do:\n            if (digits[len] == 10) -> then we would set digits[len+1]++? But that is beyond the array.\n\n          How did the original handle that? The original allocated an array of length number.length()+1, so the valid indices are 0..number.length(). \n          Then when i = number.length(), we are at the last element (the extra one). Then we do:\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) -> then we set digits[i+1]++ -> but that would be at index number.length()+1, which is out of bounds.\n\n          But note: the original code does:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    digits[i+1]++;   // this is at i+1 -> if i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1 -> but the array is of size number.length()+1? \n                    // Actually, the array was created: new int[number.length()+1] -> indices 0..number.length() -> so index i+1 = number.length()+1 is out of bounds.\n\n          This is a bug? \n\n          However, the original problem at atcoder_ABC155_E is a known problem and the solution is standard. \n\n          Actually, the problem: \"Payment\" is known. The solution is to simulate the payment by processing the digits and using greedy.\n\n          The known solution in C++ (from known submissions) does:\n\n            string n;\n            cin >> n;\n            reverse(n.begin(), n.end());\n            n += '0';   // add a sentinel\n\n          So the original Java program should have allocated one more? \n\n          But the Java program allocated:\n\n            int[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\n          Then the loop runs for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). And when i = number.length(), we do:\n\n            if (digits[i] == 10) -> then digits[i+1]++ -> which is at index number.length()+1 -> but the array only goes to number.length().\n\n          This would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\n          But wait: the problem says the input number is at least 1? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"The input consists of a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^1,000,000)\".\n\n          How can we store a number of 10^1000000? That is a string of 1000001 digits. \n\n          The original Java program does:\n\n            digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\n          So the array has length L+1, where L = number.length(). Then the valid indices are 0..L.\n\n          But then when i=L, we access digits[L+1] -> which is beyond. \n\n          This is an error. \n\n          We need to fix the allocation: we should allocate an array of length L+2? \n\n          However, note: the problem statement of atcoder_ABC155_E has known solutions that use an array of length (n.size()+1) and then process without going beyond? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the Java program might have been intended to have an extra digit at the beginning? \n\n          But looking at the code: \n\n            for (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n                digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n            }\n\n          This sets the first L digits (indices 0 to L-1) and then the last element (index L) is 0? \n\n          Then the loop goes i=0 to i=L (inclusive). \n\n          When i=L, we are at the last element (which was set to 0) and then we do:\n\n            if (digits[L] == 10) -> then set digits[L+1]++ -> which is out of bounds.\n\n          To avoid that, we should allocate L+2 and initialize to 0.\n\n          How did the original run without error? \n\n          Actually, the original problem constraints: the number is positive and we start with the least significant digit. \n          The carry might happen only up to one more digit? \n\n          But the problem says the number can be up to 10^1000000, so the string is 1000001 digits. Then we need an array of 1000003? \n\n          However, the Java program does not get an exception? \n\n          Let me test with a small example: \"5\"\n\n            digits = new int[1+1] = [0,0] (initially zeros? but then we set: \n                i=0: digits[0] = '5' (from the string \"5\") -> so digits[0]=5, digits[1]=0.\n\n            Then processing:\n                i=0: \n                    digits[0]=5 -> then check: 5==5 -> then check digits[1] (which is 0) >=5? -> false -> so we add 5 to bills -> bills=5.\n                i=1: \n                    digits[1]=0 -> then 0<5 -> add 0 -> bills=5.\n\n            Then output 5.\n\n          Example: \"9\" \n            digits[0]=9, digits[1]=0.\n            i=0: 9>=6 -> so we do: digits[1]++ -> becomes 1, and bills += 10-9=1 -> bills=1.\n            i=1: digits[1]=1 -> then 1<5 -> bills+=1 -> total=2.\n\n          Example: \"10\" \n            The string is \"10\", so L=2.\n            digits[0]=0, digits[1]=1, digits[2]=0 (from initialization? but note: the array is of size 3? indices 0,1,2? \n            Then:\n                i=0: digits[0]=0 -> bills=0.\n                i=1: digits[1]=1 -> bills=1 -> total=1.\n                i=2: digits[2]=0 -> bills=0 -> total=1? \n\n            But the expected answer for 10 is 1? (because we can use one 10-yen bill).\n\n          However, the known solution for the problem uses:\n\n            n = \"10\"\n            reverse: \"01\" -> then we add a sentinel? \n\n          Actually, the known solution in C++:\n\n            #include <iostream>\n            #include <string>\n            #include <algorithm>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                string n;\n                cin >> n;\n                reverse(n.begin(), n.end());\n                n += '0';   // add a sentinel at the end (so now the string has one extra digit at the end, which is '0')\n                int ans = 0;\n                int carry = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++) {\n                    int x = n[i] - '0' + carry;\n                    if (x < 5) {\n                        ans += x;\n                        carry = 0;\n                    } else if (x == 5) {\n                        if (i < n.size()-1 && n[i+1]-'0' >= 5) {\n                            carry = 1;\n                            ans += 10 - x;\n                        } else {\n                            ans += x;\n                            carry = 0;\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        carry = 1;\n                        ans += 10 - x;\n                    }\n                }\n                cout << ans << endl;\n            }\n\n          So the known solution adds a sentinel and then the loop runs for the entire string (including the added sentinel) but not beyond.\n\n          Therefore, to fix the Java program (and our C version) we need to allocate an array of length L+2 and set the last two to 0.\n\n          Steps for the second program:\n\n            Let L = length of the string (which we get from the first program's output, stored in str1).\n            Allocate an array `digits` of size L+2, and set all to 0.\n            Then, for i in [0, L-1]:\n                digits[i] = str1[L-1-i] - '0';   // reverse the string\n\n            Then, we process i from 0 to L (inclusive). Why L? because the original string has L digits, and we added one extra (so we have L+1 digits in the array? but we allocated L+2 so we can access index L and L+1).\n\n            Actually, we set the array to have L+2 elements? and we initialized to 0. Then we set the first L digits (from the reversed string). The last two (index L and L+1) are 0.\n\n            Then the loop for i from 0 to L (inclusive) is safe.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            int len = strlen(str1);\n            int *digits = (int*)calloc(len+2, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digits[i] = str1[len-1-i] - '0';\n            }\n\n            long bills = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {   // now we go from 0 to len (inclusive) -> total len+1 digits? but we have allocated len+2 so we can do digits[i+1] for i=len? \n                if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                    digits[i] = 0;\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                }\n                if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                    bills += digits[i];\n                } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                    if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                        digits[i+1]++;\n                    }\n                    bills += 5;\n                } else {\n                    digits[i+1]++;\n                    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n                }\n            }\n\n          Then free the array.\n\n  For the third program:\n\n        We have a string (the string representation of the integer output by the second program). \n        Then we take the first character of that string and add 1 to it, then output that character.\n\n        Example: if the string is \"65\", then we take '6' and output '7'.\n\n        But note: the string might be empty? Then we would have undefined behavior. \n\n        But the second program outputs an integer (the number of bills) which is at least 0. So the string representation of 0 is \"0\". Then we take '0' and output '1'.\n\n        How to do:\n\n            char first_char = str2[0];\n            char output_char = first_char + 1;\n\n        Then we output output_char without a newline.\n\n  Summary of the C program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <limits.h>\n\n      // Function for the first program\n      int run_first_program(int n, int a, int b, int c) {\n          int maxn = 4010;\n          int arr[3] = {a, b, c};\n          int *dp = (int*)malloc(maxn * sizeof(int));\n\n          // Initialize dp[0..n-1] to INT_MIN, but note: the original sets only [0, n-1] to MIN_VALUE? \n          // Actually, the original sets for i=0 to n-1: dp[i] = MIN_VALUE, then sets dp[0]=0.\n          // But we are going to use indices from 0 to maxn-1? \n          // We'll set all to a very small number? But the original only sets 0..n-1 to MIN_VALUE? \n          // Then the rest (from n to maxn-1) are not initialized? Actually, Java initializes to 0? \n\n          // But the original code:\n\n          //   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n          //       dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n          //   }\n\n          //   dp[0] = 0;\n\n          // Then the loops run for j from arr[i] to maxn-1.\n\n          // We are going to set:\n          for (int i = 0; i < maxn; i++) {\n              dp[i] = INT_MIN;\n          }\n          dp[0] = 0;\n\n          for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n              int coin = arr[i];\n              for (int j = coin; j < maxn; j++) {\n                  if (dp[j - coin] != INT_MIN) {   // avoid overflow\n                      if (dp[j] < dp[j - coin] + 1) {\n                          dp[j] = dp[j - coin] + 1;\n                      }\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          int result = dp[n];\n          free(dp);\n          return result;\n      }\n\n      // Function for the second program\n      long run_second_program(char *str) {\n          int len = strlen(str);\n          // Allocate an array for digits: we want len+2 to avoid overflow\n          int *digits = (int*)calloc(len+2, sizeof(int)); // initializes to 0\n          if (!digits) {\n              exit(1);\n          }\n\n          // Reverse the string and store in digits[0..len-1]\n          for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n              digits[i] = str[len-1-i] - '0';\n          }\n\n          long bills = 0;\n          // We process from i=0 to i=len (inclusive) -> that's len+1 digits, but we have allocated len+2 so digits[i+1] for i=len is valid (at index len+1, which we allocated and set to 0)\n          for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++) {\n              if (digits[i] == 10) {\n                  digits[i] = 0;\n                  digits[i+1]++;\n              }\n              if (digits[i] < 5) {\n                  bills += digits[i];\n              } else if (digits[i] == 5) {\n                  if (digits[i+1] >= 5) {\n                      digits[i+1]++;\n                  }\n                  bills += 5;\n              } else {\n                  digits[i+1]++;\n                  bills += 10 - digits[i];\n              }\n          }\n\n          free(digits);\n          return bills;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int n, a, b, c;\n          // Read the first program's input: four integers\n          if (scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &n, &a, &b, &c) != 4) {\n              return 1;\n          }\n\n          // Run the first program\n          int x = run_first_program(n, a, b, c);\n\n          // Convert x to string\n          char str1[20];\n          snprintf(str1, sizeof(str1), \"%d\", x);\n\n          // Run the second program\n          long y = run_second_program(str1);\n\n          // Convert y to string\n          char str2[20];\n          snprintf(str2, sizeof(str2), \"%ld\", y);\n\n          // Run the third program: take the first character of str2 and add 1\n          char output_char = str2[0] + 1;\n          printf(\"%c\", output_char);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the third program in Java does not output a newline. So we output without newline.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the second program might output a very large number? \n      The second program: the number of bills for a number that can be up to 10^1000000? \n      But the first program: the input n is at most 4000? Then the first program outputs at most 4000 (if a=b=c=1) or less. \n      So the string for the second program is at most 4 digits. \n\n      Then the second program: the output is an integer (the number of bills) which is at most around 4000? (if we use 1-yen bills) or less. \n      So the string for the third program is at most 4 digits. \n\n      Therefore, the buffer of 20 is safe.\n\n  Let me test with a small example:\n\n      First program: \n          Input: n=5, a=5, b=3, c=2 -> \n          dp[0]=0\n          Then for coin=5: j from 5 to 4009: dp[5]=max(dp[5], dp[0]+1)=1 -> so dp[5]=1.\n          Then for coin=3: j from 3 to 4009: \n              j=3: dp[3]=max(INT_MIN, dp[0]+1)=1 -> dp[3]=1\n              j=5: dp[5]=max(1, dp[2]+1) -> dp[2] is INT_MIN -> so stays 1 -> but wait, we haven't processed coin=2? \n          Then for coin=2: \n              j=2: dp[2]=1\n              j=3: dp[3]=max(1, dp[1]? -> dp[1] is INT_MIN -> so stays 1 -> but then j=5: dp[5]=max(1, dp[3]+1=2) -> so dp[5]=2.\n\n          Then output x=2.\n\n      Then second program: \n          Input string \"2\"\n          digits: [2] -> then we allocate digits of size 1+2=3 -> [2,0,0]\n          Process i=0: \n              digits[0]=2 -> <5 -> bills=2.\n              i=1: digits[1]=0 -> <5 -> bills=2.\n          Then y=2.\n\n      Then third program: \n          Input string \"2\" -> first char '2' -> output '3'\n\n      So we output '3'.\n\n  However, the original first program for (5,5,3,2) outputs 2? \n      We have two pieces: 5 can be cut as 3+2 -> two pieces? \n\n  But the problem of the first program: \"Cut Ribbon\" -> maximize the number of pieces. \n      The maximum pieces for n=5 with pieces 5,3,2: \n          We can use one piece of 5 -> 1 piece.\n          Or we can use one piece of 3 and one piece of 2 -> 2 pieces.\n\n      So 2 is correct.\n\n  Then the chain: \n      Input: 5 5 3 2 -> first program outputs 2 -> second program outputs 2 -> third program outputs '3'\n\n  But the original third program: \n      Input \"2\" -> outputs the next character of '2' -> which is '3'. \n\n  Therefore, the output of the entire chain is '3'.\n\n  We write the C program accordingly.\n\n  Note: The RemRing class in the third Java file is not used. We ignore it.\n\n  Let's code accordingly."
