Then, for M switches (loop M times), read k bulbs, and for each bulb s (after s--), set a[s] |= (1 << i). So a is indexed by bulb s, and each element a[s] is a bitmask of which switches (i) affect it. Because M is the number of switches. Wait, no. The loop runs M times, each representing a switch i (0..M-1). For each, read k bulbs s (1-based, converted to 0-based). Then, for each bulb s, a[s] |= (1 << i). So a[s] is the bitmask of switches (i) that affect bulb s. So a is of size N (the number of bulbs?), but N was read as the first variable, so perhaps N is the number of bulbs. Then M is the number of switches. But then, the code reads M values for p. Which would mean that p has M bits, each for a bulb. But M is the number of switches. So that's conflicting.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads N and M. Then it creates a list 'a' of size N. For each of the M switches, it reads k values, each representing a bulb connected to that switch. The 'a' array seems to store for each bulb (index s) the switches that affect it. The code uses bitwise operations here: for each bulb s, it sets a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a switch. Then it reads M values for p, which is the desired state of each bulb (each bit in p represents whether bulb i should be on or off). \n\nThe main logic is to iterate over all possible subsets of switches (using a bitmask s from 0 to 2^N - 1). For each subset, it calculates the XOR of the a[i] values where the i-th bit in s is set. This t should equal p for the subset to be a valid solution. The count of such subsets is the answer.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's see:\n\nIn C, there's no ArrayList, so we'll use arrays. The variables N and M are integers. The 'a' array in Java is of integers, so in C, we can declare it as an integer array of size N. \n\nThe scanner in Java is replaced by scanf in C. So for input, we need to read N and M using scanf. Then initialize the array a. \n\nThe next part is reading M switches. For each switch, read k, then for each of the k bulbs, read s, decrement it (since Java uses 0-based index here?), and then set the a[s] to have the i-th bit set. In C, that's similar: a[s] |= (1 << i); \n\nThen, reading the M values for p. Each x is 0 or 1. But in the Java code, p is built by OR'ing (x << i) for each i. So p is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a switch's desired state. So in C, we can do the same: read x for each of the M bits and set p accordingly.\n\nThen, the loop over all subsets s from 0 to (1<<N) -1. For each s, compute t by XOR'ing a[i] for each bit set in s. Then check if t equals p. If yes, increment ans.\n\nSo in C, the steps are similar. The main differences are handling input/output and the data structures.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure:\n\n1. Include headers: #include <stdio.h>, maybe #include <stdlib.h> for malloc if needed.\n\n2. The main function: int main() { ... }\n\n3. Read N and M using scanf.\n\n4. Allocate an array a of size N, initialized to 0. Since in Java, the initial a is all zeros, same in C. So int a[N]; and then memset or loop to set to 0. But if N is variable, maybe we need to use dynamic allocation. Wait, C99 allows variable-length arrays, so if the compiler supports it, we can declare int a[N]; after reading N.\n\n5. Then loop for M times. For each i from 0 to M-1: read k, then read k numbers s, each s is decremented by 1 (since Java code does s--;), then for each of those s, a[s] |= (1 << i). Wait, in Java, the switches are numbered from 0 to M-1, because i is in 0..M-1. So yes, each bit in a[s] represents the switches that affect it.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the Java code, for each switch i (from 0 to M-1), the code reads k bulbs. For each bulb s (after s--), the code sets a[s] to have the i-th bit set. Because each switch i can affect bulb s. So the a array has for each bulb s, a bitmask of switches that affect it. Then, when a subset of switches is selected (s), for each bulb s, if the switch is in the subset, then we XOR the a[i] (no, wait in the code, the loop is for i in 0..N-1 (the bulbs?), and for each bulb i, if the i-th bit is set in the subset s, then t ^= a[i]. So a[i] is the bitmask of switches that affect bulb i. Then t is the XOR (which in this context is equivalent to the sum mod 2) of all a[i] where the i-th switch is in the subset. So each bit in t represents whether the corresponding bulb (switch?) is toggled an odd number of times. Wait, maybe the problem is about switches controlling bulbs. Wait, maybe the problem is that each bulb is controlled by certain switches. Each switch can be on or off, and the bulb's state is the parity (XOR) of the switches that are on. The desired state p is a bitmask where each bit represents a bulb's desired state. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the code is checking whether the combination of switches selected (subset s) will toggle each bulb's state to match p. \n\nHmm. So the code's logic is:\n\nFor each possible subset of switches (s), the t variable is the bitwise XOR of all a[i] where the i-th switch is in the subset. Wait, no. Wait, in Java code:\n\ns is a bitmask of switches selected. For each i (0..N-1), if the i-th bit in s is set, then t ^= a.get(i). So a[i] is a bitmask of bulbs. Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the variables in Java:\n\nN is the number of switches. M is the number of bulbs.\n\nEach bulb is connected to some switches. The a list has for each switch i (0..N-1) a bitmask representing the bulbs it affects. Then, when a subset of switches (s) is selected, each bulb's state is the parity (number of times it's toggled) by the selected switches. So t is the combined effect of all the switches in s: for each bulb, if an odd number of switches in s affect it, then its state is 1, else 0. Then t must equal p, which is the desired state for each bulb.\n\nSo the a array is of size N (number of switches), and each entry is a bitmask of bulbs. So for switch i, a[i] has bits set for the bulbs it toggles.\n\nSo, for example, if switch 0 affects bulbs 0 and 1, then a[0] is 0b11 (binary). Then, if the subset s includes switch 0, then all the bulbs in a[0] are toggled. Then, when other switches are included, their bulb toggles are XORed in.\n\nSo in the Java code:\n\nEach switch i (from 0 to M-1?) Wait, no. Wait the code's loops:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nfor the M switches (i from 0 to M-1):\n\nEach switch has k bulbs. For each bulb s (1-based?), which is decremented by 1 to 0-based. Then, a.set(s, a.get(s) | (1 << i)).\n\nSo for each switch (i), and each bulb s (0-based), the a[s] is updated. Wait, wait, this is confusing. Wait, in the code:\n\nThe M is read first. Then for each i in 0..M-1 (since M times), k is read, then for j in 0..k-1, read s, s--. So s is 0-based. Then a.set(s, ...). So a is indexed by s (the bulb index), and each bulb s has a bitmask of the switches that affect it. Because for each switch i (0..M-1), when it is toggled, it affects all bulbs s that are connected to it. So a[s] is a bitmask where each bit represents a switch (i) that affects bulb s. Then, when a subset of switches is chosen (s is a bitmask of switches selected?), but wait the code loops over s from 0 to (1 << N) -1. Wait N is the number of switches. Oh, right. So in the problem, N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. So each bulb's state depends on which switches are pressed.\n\nSo the a array in Java is of size N (number of switches?), but no, wait the code initializes a as new ArrayList with N elements, but in the loops after that, for each of M switches, and for each bulb s connected to that switch, the a list's s-th element is updated. So perhaps N is the number of bulbs, and M is the number of switches. Wait no, original code:\n\nThe variables are read as N and M. Then a is initialized to N elements. Then, M times, for each switch i (0-based), the code reads k bulbs. So each switch has k bulbs connected. Then, for each bulb s (after reading and s--), the a[s] is set to have the i-th bit. So a has N elements, which suggests N is the number of bulbs, and M is the number of switches. Then, the loop for s from 0 to (1 << N) -1 is wrong? Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait. Let's look back. The code reads N and M. Then creates a list a of size N. Then processes M switches, each connected to some bulbs. So each a element is per bulb. Then, when generating the subset s, which is a bitmask of switches. Wait no, the code later loops over s from 0 to (1 << N) -1, which is 2^N possibilities. So s represents a subset of N elements. But N was the number of bulbs. That's confusing. Wait, this suggests that perhaps in the problem statement, N is the number of switches, and M is the number of bulbs. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal problem: the code's variables:\n\nN is read first, then M. Then, the a list has N elements. Then, for M switches, each has k bulbs connected. Then, each bulb s (after s--), the a list's s-th element is OR'ed with 1 << i (i being the current switch index, from 0 to M-1). Then, p is built by reading M values, which are the desired bulb states. \n\nWait, that's impossible. Because in that case, each switch (i from 0 to M-1) is processed, and for each bulb s connected to it, a[s] (which is of size N) is updated. But if N is the number of bulbs, then a has N elements, each representing a bulb's connected switches. Then, when generating all possible subsets of switches (s is a subset of switches?), but the code loops s from 0 to (1 << N) -1, which would be 2^N possibilities. But N is the number of bulbs. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a confusion in variable names here.\n\nWait, maybe in the problem statement, N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Then, the a list is of size N (each switch has a bitmask of bulbs it affects). Then, for each switch i (0 to N-1), read the bulbs it's connected to, and set the bulb's bits in a[i]. Then, the p variable is a bitmask of M bits (since there are M bulbs). Then, the code iterates over all possible subsets of switches (s is a bitmask of N bits, since there are N switches). For each subset s, compute the XOR of a[i] for each switch i that is in s. Then, check if this XOR equals p. The answer is the number of such subsets.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the code's variables:\n\nN = number of switches\n\nM = number of bulbs\n\nThen, the a list has N elements (one per switch), each is a bitmask of M bits, where each bit represents a bulb that is connected to that switch. \n\nThen, the desired state p is a bitmask of M bits (each bulb's desired state: 0 or 1). \n\nSo, for each subset of switches (s), the total effect is the XOR of all the a[i] for switches i that are in s. Then, if the XOR equals p, then this subset is valid. \n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nIn that case, the code's variables:\n\nThe a array is of size N (number of switches), each entry is a bitmask of M bits. Then, for each switch i (0..N-1), the code reads the bulbs it is connected to, and for each such bulb s (0-based?), it sets the s-th bit in a[i]. Wait, no. Because in the code, for each of M switches (loop runs M times), and for each bulb s connected to that switch, the a[s] is updated. But a has size N. So this would imply that M is the number of switches, and N is the number of bulbs. But then the a list is size N (number of bulbs), and for each switch i (0..M-1), the code reads k bulbs s (0..N-1), and for each, a[s] |= (1 << i). So each a[s] is a bitmask of switches that affect bulb s. Then, p is built by reading M bits (since there are M switches?), but that can't be. Or perhaps p is built by reading M bits, each of which is the desired state for bulb i. \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's try to re-express the code's logic.\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nN and M are read. Then, a list of N elements is created. Then, for M times (loops from i=0 to M-1), read k and then k bulbs s. For each s, decrement by 1, and set a[s] |= (1 << i). So each bulb s is 0-based. So a is indexed by bulb s, and each element a[s] is a bitmask of the switches (i) that affect bulb s. Because for each switch i (0..M-1), the code processes the bulbs connected to it. So a bulb s has a bitmask indicating all the switches (i) that are connected to it. Then, the code reads M values (x), and sets p as a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a bulb's desired state. Wait, no. Because p is built by OR'ing (x << i) for each i in 0..M-1. So each x is the desired state for bulb i. Because M is the number of bulbs. \n\nWait, but that would require that M is the number of bulbs. So:\n\nN is the number of bulbs.\n\nM is the number of switches. \n\nNo, because in the code, after processing M switches, the code reads M values (x) to build p. So if M is the number of switches, then p is the desired state per switch, which doesn't make sense. The problem is about bulbs, so p should be a bitmask of M bulbs' desired states. \n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe code reads N and M. Then creates a list a of size N. Then processes M switches (loop M times). For each switch, read the bulbs it's connected to. For each such bulb s (0-based), set a[s] |= (1 << i) where i is the current switch index (0..M-1). So each bulb s has a bitmask of which switches affect it. Then p is built by reading M values, each x is 0 or 1. These x's are the desired state for each bulb. Because M is the number of bulbs. So N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Wait, no. Because the code's a list is size N. So a bulb s can be up to N-1. But M is the number of bulbs? That would mean N is the number of bulbs, and M is the number of switches. \n\nWait, yes. Because then each bulb s is in 0..N-1 (since a has N elements), and there are M switches. Each switch i is in 0..M-1, and a bulb s is affected by the switches i where the i-th bit in a[s] is set. Then, the desired state p is a bitmask of M bits, but that doesn't make sense. Because the desired state should be per bulb, not per switch. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a mistake in variable names. For example, perhaps N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Then, a is a list of N elements (one per switch), each is a bitmask of M bits (each bit represents a bulb). Then, the code reads for each switch i (0..N-1) the bulbs it affects. Then, for each such bulb s (0..M-1), set a[i] |= (1 << s). But in the code, a is initialized with N elements, and each switch loop runs M times. So this would require that M is the number of switches, but in that case the code would have a problem.\n\nI think the confusion comes from the variable names in the original code. Let me try to re-express the code's logic.\n\nThe code's variables:\n\nN is the number of bulbs.\n\nM is the number of switches.\n\nThen, the code creates a list a of size N (bulbs). For each switch i (0..M-1), read k bulbs connected to it. For each bulb s (after s--), a[s] |= (1 << i). So a[s] is a bitmask of switches that affect bulb s. Then, the desired state p is built by reading M values (each x is 0 or 1), which would correspond to M switches, but that's incorrect. Because p should be the desired state of each bulb. \n\nSo there's a mistake here. Because p is built by OR'ing (x << i) for each i in 0..M-1. So p has M bits. But each bulb s's state is determined by the XOR of the switches in the subset that affect it, which are in a[s]. Then, the code checks if t (the XOR of a[i] for bulbs i in the subset) equals p, which is M bits. That's impossible because t is a bitmask of M switches, but p is the desired bulb states. \n\nWait, this can't be right. There's a confusion between bulbs and switches here. The code must have a logical error. But according to the code's original problem (atcoder ABC128 C), perhaps the problem is as follows:\n\nProblem statement: There are N switches and M bulbs. Each switch is connected to some bulbs. When a switch is flipped, it toggles the state of its connected bulbs. The initial state of all bulbs is off. We need to determine how many subsets of switches will result in the bulbs being in the desired state.\n\nEach bulb's desired state is given. The desired state p is a list of M bits (each 0 or 1). \n\nSo for each bulb i (0..M-1), the sum (mod 2) of the switches that are flipped and connected to bulb i must equal p[i].\n\nThus, the code's variables:\n\nN = number of switches.\n\nM = number of bulbs.\n\nThen, for each bulb i, we need to track which switches affect it. So for each bulb i, the a array would have a bitmask of switches that affect it. But in the original code, the a array is of size N (switches), which is wrong. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code. But looking at the code:\n\nThe code reads N and M. Then initializes a as a list of N elements. Then, for M switches (loop M times), read k bulbs, and for each bulb s (after s--), set a[s] |= (1 << i). So a is indexed by bulb s, and each element a[s] is a bitmask of which switches (i) affect it. Because M is the number of switches. Wait, no. The loop runs M times, each representing a switch i (0..M-1). For each, read k bulbs s (1-based, converted to 0-based). Then, for each bulb s, a[s] |= (1 << i). So a[s] is the bitmask of switches (i) that affect bulb s. So a is of size N (the number of bulbs?), but N was read as the first variable, so perhaps N is the number of bulbs. Then M is the number of switches. \n\nBut then, the code reads M values for p. Which would mean that p has M bits, each for a bulb. But M is the number of switches. So that's conflicting. \n\nSo perhaps the original code has swapped N and M. For example, in the problem statement, N is the number of switches and M is the number of bulbs. So the code's variables are swapped.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the code works as follows:\n\nEach bulb s has a bitmask of switches that affect it (stored in a[s]). When a subset of switches is chosen (represented by the bitmask s in the loop), the XOR of the switches' bitmasks (a[i] for which i is set in s) gives the resulting bulb states. Then, compare this to p. \n\nIn any case, the code's logic must be correctly translated to C. Let's proceed with the code as written.\n\nIn the Java code, a is an ArrayList of N elements. So in C, we can create an array a of size N. Then, for each of M iterations (switches), read k bulbs and update a[s] for each s. \n\nIn C:\n\nRead N and M with scanf.\n\nint a[N];\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) a[i] = 0;\n\nThen, for each switch i from 0 to M-1:\n\nread k.\n\nthen for j from 0 to k-1:\n\nread s, s--.\n\na[s] |= (1 << i);\n\nWait, but in the Java code, it's M switches. So in C, the loop for (i = 0; i < M; i++) { ... }\n\nBut N is the size of a. So if M is larger than the number of bits in an integer, but perhaps the problem constraints are such that M is up to 10 or something. So in C, we'll need to use an integer type that can hold M bits. Assuming M is up to, say, 30, then using int (32 bits) is acceptable.\n\nThen, read M values for x, each 0 or 1. Then p is built by OR'ing (x << i) for each i from 0 to M-1. So:\n\nint p = 0;\n\nfor (i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n\n    int x;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n\n    p |= (x << i);\n\n}\n\nThen, iterate over all subsets s from 0 to (1 << N) -1. For each s, compute t as the XOR of a[i] for each i where the i-th bit is set in s. Then compare to p.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the subset s is of switches (since a is per bulb?), no. The code loops over s from 0 to (1 << N) -1, where N is the original N (number of bulbs?), which makes no sense. There's confusion here. \n\nWait, in the Java code, after reading N and M, the code initializes a with N elements. Then, for M switches, it processes. So perhaps N is the number of bulbs, M the number of switches. Then, the loop for s is from 0 to (1 << M) -1, since each switch can be selected or not. But in the code, the loop is up to (1 << N) -1, which would be wrong if N is the number of bulbs. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps the original problem statement has different variable names, and the code is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the variables are swapped. Let's think: the code's variables:\n\nN is the number of bulbs.\n\nM is the number of switches.\n\nThen, the code's loop for each subset of bulbs (s), but that doesn't make sense. Because the subsets should be subsets of switches. \n\nSo there must be a mistake in the code. But given that the code is part of a programming competition problem that has passed test cases, perhaps the variables are swapped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a mistake in the loop variable. For example, the code should loop up to (1 << M) -1. But in the code, it's (1 << N) -1. \n\nThis is a problem. If N is the number of bulbs, then the loop runs 2^N subsets, which is impossible for large N (like N=30). So perhaps the code is correct, and N is the number of switches. \n\nBut the code reads N and M. So let's assume that N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Then, a is of size N (each switch has a bitmask of bulbs it affects). Then, for each switch i (0..N-1), the code reads k bulbs connected to it, and for each bulb s (0..M-1), a[i] |= (1 << s). Then, the desired state p is a bitmask of M bits (each bulb's state). Then, the code iterates over all subsets of switches (s is a bitmask of N bits). For each subset, compute t as the XOR of a[i] for each i in the subset. Then, if t equals p, increment ans.\n\nThis makes sense. But in the code, the a array is initialized with N elements (number of switches), and each a[i] is a bitmask of bulbs. Then, for each switch i, a[i] is set with the bulbs it affects. \n\nSo in the code:\n\nN is the number of switches.\n\nM is the number of bulbs.\n\nThen, the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when processing the M switches, the loop runs M times. But if N is the number of switches, then the loop should run N times. So there's a mistake in the code. This is conflicting.\n\nAh, this is a critical point. The code's first part reads M switches (loop M times), but if N is the number of switches, this is incorrect. So the code must have a mistake. However, since the code is from a programming competition problem that passed test cases, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variable names.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement's variables are swapped. For example, the original problem may have N as the number of switches and M as the number of bulbs, but the code uses N as the number of bulbs and M as the number of switches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original code:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nint N = sc.nextInt();\nint M = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, creates a list a of size N.\n\nThen, for M times (i from 0 to M-1), reads k bulbs for each switch.\n\nThen, for each bulb s (after s--), sets a[s] |= (1 << i).\n\nSo, for example, if there are N bulbs and M switches, then each of the M switches has some bulbs connected. Each a[s] (for bulb s) is a bitmask of the switches that affect it (bits 0 to M-1). Then, the desired state p is built by reading M values, which is the desired state of each bulb. \n\nNo, that's not possible, because M is the number of switches, but each bulb's desired state is a single bit. So the code's p is built by reading M bits, which would be the desired state of each switch, which is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the code has a variable name swap. For example, perhaps the code's N and M are swapped. So the correct code should read M and N instead. But this is not possible to know for sure. \n\nBut given that the code is accepted, I must proceed to translate it as is. \n\nSo, the code in Java uses:\n\nN is the number of bulbs.\n\nM is the number of switches.\n\nThen, a is of size N (bulbs), each a[s] is a bitmask of M switches that affect bulb s.\n\nThen, the code reads M desired states (x), which are the desired state for each switch. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, no. The code reads M values for x, and sets p as a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a switch's desired state. But that can't be right, because the desired state should be per bulb. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps the code is correct and the problem's logic is as follows:\n\nEach switch affects certain bulbs. The desired state is a set of bulbs (M bulbs) that must be on. For each subset of switches, we check if the bulbs that are on after flipping those switches match the desired state. \n\nThe code's variables:\n\nN is the number of switches.\n\nM is the number of bulbs.\n\nThen, the code creates a list a of size N (switches), each entry is a bitmask of bulbs that the switch affects. Then, for each switch i (0..N-1), read the bulbs connected to it. Then, for each bulb s (0..M-1), a[i] |= (1 << s). Then, the desired state p is a bitmask of M bulbs (each bit is 0 or 1). Then, the code iterates over all subsets of switches (s is a subset of the N switches), computes t as the XOR of a[i] for each switch i in the subset. Then, if t == p, ans is incremented.\n\nThis makes sense. So in this case:\n\nThe code's variable N is the number of switches.\n\nM is the number of bulbs.\n\nThe code reads N and M, then creates a list a of size N (switches), each a[i] is a bitmask of bulbs (M bits) that the switch affects. \n\nThen, for each switch i (0..N-1), reads k and then k bulbs s (1-based, converted to 0-based), and sets a[i] |= (1 << s). \n\nThen, reads M values x (0 or 1), and sets p as the bitmask where each bit s (0..M-1) is x. \n\nThen, for each subset of switches (s is a bitmask of N bits), compute t as the XOR of a[i] for each switch i in the subset. The XOR's result is a bitmask of bulbs, where each bit is 1 if an odd number of switches in the subset affect that bulb. Then, if this equals p, the subset is counted.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the code is correct, and the variable names in the code are swapped. For example, in the code, N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. \n\nBut according to the code's initial lines:\n\nN is read first, then M. Then, a list of N elements is created. Then, M times (loops M times), reads k bulbs for each switch. So this would imply that there are M switches. So perhaps the code's variables are swapped. So the original code's N is M, and M is N. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. To proceed, I'll have to translate the code as is, regardless of the variable name confusion, as long as the C code produces the same logic as the Java code. \n\nSo, in C:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nint a[N]; // initialized to 0.\n\nThen, for M times (i from 0 to M-1) {\n\nread k.\n\nfor j from 0 to k-1:\n\nread s, s--.\n\na[s] |= (1 << i);\n\n}\n\nRead M values x, build p.\n\nThen, loop over s from 0 to (1 << N) -1:\n\nt is 0.\n\nfor i from 0 to N-1:\n\nif (s & (1 << i)) {\n\nt ^= a[i];\n\n}\n\nif (t == p) ans++;\n\n}\n\nPrint ans.\n\nBut this implies that N is the number of bulbs, M is the number of switches. Because a has N elements, and each a[s] is updated for each switch i (0..M-1), which has M iterations. Then, the loop over s is up to (1<<N) which is 2^N subsets. So this would loop through all possible subsets of bulbs, which doesn't make sense. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps the code is correct and the variables are swapped. \n\nBut given that the original code is accepted on the platform, it must be correct. So I must proceed.\n\nSo the C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N, M;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n    int a[N];\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        a[i] = 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int k;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {\n            int s;\n            scanf(\"%d\", &s);\n            s--;\n            a[s] |= (1 << i);\n        }\n    }\n    int p = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n        int x;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        p |= (x << i);\n    }\n    int ans = 0;\n    for (int s = 0; s < (1 << N); s++) {\n        int t = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n            if ((s >> i) & 1) {\n                t ^= a[i];\n            }\n        }\n        if (t == p) {\n            ans++;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in this code, M is the number of switches, and for each switch i (0..M-1), the code reads k bulbs connected to it. Then, each a[s] (bulb s) is a bitmask of switches that affect it. Then, p is built by reading M values (switches' desired states?), but this doesn't make sense. Because the desired state should be for the bulbs, not the switches. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, when a subset of bulbs is chosen (s is a bitmask of N bulbs?), and for each bulb i in the subset, XOR a[i] (the switches affecting it) to compute t, which is compared to p. But this would be the XOR of all the switches affecting each bulb in the subset. But this doesn't correspond to the problem's requirements. \n\nThe code must have a mistake in variable names. But perhaps the original problem's variables are different. For example, the code may have swapped N and M. So to make it work, perhaps the code's N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Then, the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's input processing, after reading N and M, a list of N elements is created. Then, for M switches, each with k bulbs. So if N is the number of bulbs, M is the number of switches, and each a[s] (s is bulb) is a bitmask of switches that affect it. Then, when we generate all subsets of switches (s is a bitmask of M switches), but the code generates s up to (1 << N), which is 2^N possibilities. But if N is the number of bulbs, then this is incorrect.\n\nBut this is conflicting. \n\nGiven that the code is accepted, perhaps the variables are swapped. So in the original problem, N is the number of switches, M is the number of bulbs. Then, the code's variables are swapped. So the code's N is M, M is N. \n\nBut regardless, the C code must replicate the Java code's logic. So regardless of variable names, the code must read N and M, process M switches, etc.\n\nSo the C code is as above.\n\nBut in this case, the code's variables are read as N and M, and the code's logic is as written. \n\nFor example, when the code reads N=2, M=2.\n\nThen, a is an array of 2 elements (size N). Then, process M=2 switches. For each switch i=0 and 1:\n\nRead k, then k bulbs.\n\nSuppose first switch (i=0) has k=1 bulb s=1 (after s-- becomes 0). Then a[0] |= 1 <<0 \u2192 a[0] = 1.\n\nSecond switch (i=1) has k=1 bulb s=2 (after s-- becomes 1). So a[1] |= 1 <<1 \u2192 a[1] = 2.\n\nThen read M=2 x's. Suppose x1=1, x2=1. Then p = (1 <<0) | (1 <<1) = 3.\n\nThen loop s from 0 to 3 (since N=2, 1 <<2 is 4, so s <4). For each s:\n\ns=0: t=0 \u2192 compare with p=3 \u2192 no.\n\ns=1 (bit 0): t = a[0] =1. Not 3.\n\ns=2 (bit 1): t = a[1] =2. Not 3.\n\ns=3 (bits 0 and 1): t = 1 ^ 2 =3. So ans becomes 1.\n\nSo ans is 1.\n\nThe code outputs 1. Which is correct if the problem's desired state is 3 (binary 11), meaning both bulbs are on. \n\nSo the code's logic seems correct in this case. But how does this fit with the variable names?\n\nIn this example, N=2 (number of bulbs?), M=2 (number of switches). Each switch affects one bulb. Then, the code checks all subsets of bulbs (s from 0 to 3), which doesn't make sense. Unless the code is really checking subsets of switches. \n\nThere's a clear confusion here. But the code must be correct, and the C code must be translated as is. \n\nSo the final C code is as written above."
