So if index is 0, there's no such element. So we need to append x to the array. But if index is >0, then we replace array[index-1] with x.\n\nWait, but replacing array[index-1] with x would make the array still sorted. Because array[index-1] < x (since index is the first element >=x, the elements before index are <x). So replacing array[index-1] with x would be array[index-1] = x, which is greater than array[index-2] (if exists), but array[index] is >=x. Wait, this would break the sorted order. For example, if array is [1,3,5], and x is 4. The insertion point (lower_bound) for 4 is 2 (element 5 is >=4). So index-1 is 1 (element 3). Replacing 3 with 4 gives [1,4,5], which is sorted. That's correct. Another example: array is [3], x is 1. Insertion point is 0 (since 3 >=1). index-1 is -1. So append 1. Now array is [3,1], which is not sorted. So this approach is invalid. So the problem is that when we have to add a new element because no smaller element exists, adding it to the end would break the sorted order. So this approach only works if the elements are added in a way that maintains the sorted array. But how to handle this. Ah!",

But in C, the only way to do this is to implement a balanced BST. But given time constraints, perhaps the correct code translation is to use a dynamic array with sorted elements and binary search, even though it's O(n^2), but with the note that this approach is only feasible for small n. But since the user is asking for a translation of the given Java code, which uses TreeMap, and the C code is expected to be correct for the problem, even if it's not efficient, we can proceed.",

Ah! So to maintain the array in sorted order, when the predecessor does not exist, x is the smallest element, and is inserted at the beginning. But how to find this. The correct steps for the multiset approach are: For each x:\n\n1. Find the first element in the array that is >= x using binary search. Let's call this position 'pos'. 2. If pos == 0, it means all elements are >=x. So x is inserted at the beginning. 3. Else, replace the element at pos-1 with x. But this approach ensures that the array remains sorted. Let's see with examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInitial array: [3,4,5]\n\nx = 2.\n\npos is 0 (all elements >=2). So replace pos-1 (invalid), so insert at beginning. Array becomes [2,4,5]. Which is sorted. Example 2:\n\nInitial array: [3,4,5]\n\nx = 3.\n\npos is 0.",

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is: For each x:\n\nFind the first element in the array that is >x. The position where x would be inserted to maintain sorted order is 'pos'.

For each x, find the first element in the array that is >=x. If found, replace it with x. If not found, append x. But this is the standard LIS algorithm, which gives the length of the LIS. But in our case, the answer is the size of the array after this process. But according to the original code's example, this approach gives a different answer. For example:\n\nInput: [3,1,4,1,5,9]\n\nProcessing using LIS approach:\n\n3 \u2192 array becomes [3]\n\n1 \u2192 find first >=1 (index 0), replace 3 with 1 \u2192 array [1]\n\n4 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4]\n\n1 \u2192 find first >=1 (index 0), replace 1 with 1 \u2192 array [1,4]\n\n5 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4,5]\n\n9 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4,5,9]. Size is 4. But the correct answer is 3. Thus, this approach is not correct. So, the problem is that the original code's approach requires finding the largest element less than x, not the first element >=x.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach for the multiset is to find the largest element less than x.

But considering that the original problem likely expects an O(n log n) solution, perhaps the code should use the approach of maintaining a dynamic array where each insertion is done via binary search and the array is kept sorted, with the answer being the size of the array.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me first understand what the Java code does. So, looking at the code, it's using a TreeMap to keep track of some elements. The main logic seems to be processing each number from the input. For each number, it checks if there's a lower key in the TreeMap. If there isn't, it increments the count for that number. If there is, it takes the highest lower key, decreases its count (removing it if the count becomes zero), and then increments the current number's count.\n\nHmm, so the TreeMap here is being used to maintain elements in a sorted order, allowing efficient lookups for the largest key less than the current number. The goal is to determine the minimum number of sequences (like in a patience sorting problem) by tracking how many times each number can be appended to an existing sequence.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Since C doesn't have built-in TreeMap or similar structures, I need to implement a way to handle this. One possible approach is to use a dynamic array that's kept sorted. For each new number, we perform a binary search to find the largest element smaller than it. If found, we replace that element with the current number. If not found, we add the current number to the array. The size of the array at the end would be the answer.\n\nWait, but the original Java code counts occurrences. Let me think again. The Java code increments the count for a number when it's added. But if there's a lower key, it replaces that key's occurrence with the current number. But each key in the TreeMap has a count, which represents how many sequences end with that number. So, for example, if you have a key K with count V, that means there are V sequences ending with K. When a new number comes in, you look for the largest K less than the number. If found, you decrease the count of K by 1 (since you're using one sequence that ended with K to append the new number), and increase the count of the new number by 1. If K's count becomes zero, you remove it from the map.\n\nSo in the end, the total count of all values in the map is the answer, which is the number of sequences.\n\nIn C, to model this, perhaps we can maintain a sorted list of elements, and for each element, track how many times it appears. But that might be complex. Alternatively, since each time a number is processed, it's replacing the first possible lower number, maybe we can use a dynamic array that's kept in sorted order, and for each new number, find the first element that is less than it (using binary search), and replace that element with the current number. If no such element exists, add the current number to the array. The length of the array at the end would be the answer. Wait, that's similar to the approach used in the patience sorting algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem. But in this case, the problem is to find the minimum number of non-decreasing subsequences (or something similar), which the answer is the size of the array. But the original code counts the sum of the values in the TreeMap, which could be higher than the array length if there are multiple counts for the same key.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code's logic. Suppose the input is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]. Let's walk through it:\n\nFor each number:\n\n- 3: no lower key, add to map (count 1)\n- 1: no lower key, add to map (count 1). Now map has 1:1, 3:1. So sum is 2.\nWait, but the answer here would be 2. But in terms of sequences, maybe the sequences are [3,4,5,9], [1,1,5,9], etc. Wait, perhaps the problem is to cover the array with the maximum number of increasing sequences, but the answer is the minimal number of such sequences. Or perhaps the problem is that each sequence must be strictly decreasing? Because the logic here seems to be that when a new number comes, it's placed after the largest possible number smaller than it, thereby forming a sequence. The number of such sequences would be the sum of the counts of all the keys in the TreeMap. Because each key's count represents how many sequences end with that number.\n\nSo in the Java code, the sum of all values in the TreeMap is the answer. So the answer is not the number of elements in the map, but the sum of their counts.\n\nIn C, how to model this? Well, the challenge is that in C, we don't have a TreeMap structure. So perhaps, we need to create a data structure that allows us to find the largest key less than a given number, and track counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem again. Each time a new number comes, we want to assign it to the earliest possible sequence that ends with a number less than it, thereby keeping the sequences as \"efficient\" as possible, minimizing the total number of sequences. This is similar to the problem of scheduling or greedy algorithms.\n\nWait, the Java code's approach is to track for each possible end value, how many sequences end with that value. When a new number comes, we find the largest end value that's less than the new number. If such a value exists, we take one of those sequences (decrement the count) and add the new number to the sequences (increment the count for the new number). If there's no such value, we have to start a new sequence (increment the count for the new number).\n\nThe total sum of counts is the total number of sequences. So, the algorithm is similar to the greedy approach for the problem of finding the minimal number of increasing (or in this case, maybe non-decreasing) subsequences required to cover the array.\n\nBut how to model this in C. Since in Java, the TreeMap allows efficient (log n) lookups for the lower key, but in C, we need to implement this ourselves.\n\nSo, possible approach:\n\nWe can maintain a sorted array, where each element is a structure containing a value and a count. The array is kept sorted by value. For each new number, we perform a binary search to find the largest value less than the current number. If found, we decrease its count by 1 (and remove it if the count reaches zero). Then, we add the current number to the array, either by incrementing its count if it exists or inserting it with a count of 1.\n\nBut maintaining this array in C requires dynamic memory allocation and insertion, which can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a binary search tree structure. However, implementing a balanced BST in C is time-consuming, especially for a code translation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using a multiset approach, similar to how the Java code uses the TreeMap. Each time, for the current number, find the first element in the multiset that is less than the number. If found, remove it and add the current number. The number of elements in the multiset at the end would be the answer. Wait, but this is similar to the approach where each number replaces the largest possible smaller element. The answer would then be the size of the multiset. Wait, but in the original code, the answer is the sum of all counts. For example, if a number appears multiple times in the multiset, each occurrence represents a separate sequence.\n\nAh, right. So in this case, each time we replace an element in the multiset with the current number, we're effectively moving a sequence's end from the old number to the new one. But in the original code, if a key has a count of 3, that means there are 3 sequences ending with that key. So replacing one occurrence (count decremented by 1) and adding a new count for the new key. So the sum of counts is the total number of sequences.\n\nSo, in the multiset approach, each element in the multiset represents a sequence. When we process a new number, we find the first element in the multiset that is less than the number. If found, we remove that element and add the new number to the multiset. The total number of elements in the multiset at the end is the answer.\n\nIn this case, the multiset approach would model the sum of counts as the size of the multiset, but only if each count in the original code is 1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's see. Suppose we have two sequences ending with the same number. For example, two sequences ending with 5. When a new number 6 comes in, we can take one of the 5s, replace it with 6. So the multiset would have one 5 and one 6. So the total count (sum of the values in the TreeMap) would be 2, which is the same as the multiset's size. But in the original code, the TreeMap counts would have 5:1, 6:1. Sum is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the TreeMap allows multiple counts, like 5:2, and a new number 6 comes in, then we can replace one of the 5s, resulting in 5:1 and 6:1. The sum is still 2. So in this case, the multiset approach (each element is a separate sequence) would have the same size as the sum of counts in the TreeMap.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's approach is equivalent to maintaining a multiset where each element is the last element of a sequence, and for each new number, you find the largest element in the multiset that is less than the number. If found, remove that element and add the new number. If not found, add the new number. The total number of elements in the multiset at the end is the answer. So the sum of counts in the TreeMap is the same as the size of this multiset.\n\nIf that's the case, then the Java code's approach could be replaced with using a multiset, and the answer is the size of the multiset. But how to confirm this?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose input is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9].\n\nProcessing each number:\n\n1. 3: no elements in multiset, add 3. Size=1.\n2. 1: no elements less than 1, add 1. Size=2.\n3. 4: find largest less than 4 (3). Remove 3, add 4. Multiset becomes {1,4}. Size=2.\n4. 1: find largest less than 1 (none). Add 1. Size=3.\n5. 5: find largest less than 5 (4). Remove 4, add 5. Multiset {1,1,5}. Size=3.\n6. 9: find largest less than 9 (5). Remove 5, add 9. Multiset {1,1,9}. Size=3.\n\nSo the answer is 3. According to the original code's approach, let's see:\n\nProcessing the same numbers:\n\n- 3: map has 3:1. Sum=1.\n- 1: no lower key, add 1:1. Sum=2.\n- 4: lower key is 3. Remove one 3 (count becomes 0, so removed), add 4:1. Sum=2.\n- 1: no lower key. Add 1:1 (now 1's count is 2). Sum=3.\n- 5: lower key is 4. Remove 4 (count 1, removed). Add 5:1. Sum=3.\n- 9: lower key is 5. Remove 5, add 9:1. Sum=3.\n\nSo the answer is 3. Which matches the multiset approach. So the sum of counts in the TreeMap is equivalent to the size of the multiset. Therefore, we can model the problem using a multiset, and the answer is the size of the multiset.\n\nTherefore, the original code can be simplified to use a multiset approach where each insertion is handled by replacing the first possible element, and the answer is the size of the multiset. So in C, we can model this using a dynamic array that's kept sorted, and for each new number, perform a binary search to find the first element that is less than the current number, and replace it with the current number. If no such element exists, add the current number to the array. The array's size is the answer.\n\nYes! Because each time we process a number, we're either adding a new sequence (when no element is found) or replacing an existing sequence's end (so the total number of sequences remains the same). So the size of the array after all operations is the minimal number of sequences required.\n\nThis approach is known as the \"greedy algorithm\" for this problem. It's similar to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), but here the answer is the minimal number of such sequences needed to cover the array. The algorithm here is to maintain a list of the last elements of the sequences. For each new element, find the first last element that is smaller than it and replace that element with the new one. If none are found, add a new sequence.\n\nSo, in C, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the input numbers.\n2. For each number in sequence:\n   a. Use binary search on the array (sorted) to find the first element that is less than the current number.\n   b. If found, replace that element with the current number.\n   c. If not found, append the current number to the array.\n3. The answer is the size of the array.\n\nWait, but in the example above, after processing 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9:\n\nThe array would be [1, 4, 5, 9] after the first steps? Wait, perhaps not. Let's re-examine:\n\nWait, let's process each number step by step with this approach.\n\nLet's take the same input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9].\n\nInitialize array as empty.\n\n1. 3: array is empty, so add. Array becomes [3]. Size=1.\n2. 1: array is [3]. Find first element less than 1. 3 is not less than 1. So add 1. Array becomes [3,1]. But wait, the array is kept sorted in some order. Wait, no\u2014the way this approach works is that the array is maintained in a way that's sorted in increasing order, but the binary search is looking for the leftmost element that is >= current number. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, in the standard approach for LIS, you maintain an array where each element represents the smallest possible last element of a subsequence of a certain length. For each new number, you find the first element in the array that is >= to it and replace it. But here, the approach is to find the first element that is less than the current number (so you can append to that subsequence). Wait, but the code in Java is replacing the largest possible key less than the current number. So, in the array, for the current number, we want to find the largest element less than it. To find that, we can perform a binary search for the largest element less than the current number.\n\nAlternatively, if the array is kept sorted in ascending order, then for a new number, the largest element less than it would be the rightmost element in the array that is less than the number. So, for example, if the array is [1,3,4], and the new number is 5, the largest element less than 5 is 4. So, in the array, we can find this using binary search.\n\nWait, but how to implement this. Let's think about the binary search. For a sorted array (ascending), to find the first element that is >= x, you can use lower_bound. To find the largest element less than x, it's the element before the lower_bound index.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf the array is sorted, for a new number x, the largest element less than x is the last element in the array that is <x. So, the index is the insertion point (using lower_bound) minus one.\n\nSo, the steps for each number would be:\n\n- Binary search the array for the insertion point of x (using lower_bound). The insertion point is the index where x would be inserted to keep the array sorted. All elements before the index are <=x? Or <x? Wait, lower_bound returns the first element >=x. So elements before the index are <x.\n\nSo, the largest element less than x would be the element at index (insertion point -1). If insertion point is 0, then there is no such element.\n\nSo, for example:\n\narray = [1,3,4], x=3.\n\nlower_bound returns index 1 (since 3 is at index 1). insertion point is 1. So insertion point-1 is 0, which is element 1. But 1 is less than 3. So for x=3, the largest element less than x is 1.\n\nWait, but if array is [1,2,4], and x=3. lower_bound would return index 2 (element 4 is >=3). insertion point is 2. insertion point-1 is 1 (element 2), which is less than 3. So replacing element 2 with 3. array becomes [1,3,4].\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each number x in the input:\n\n1. Find the insertion point using lower_bound (the first element >=x).\n\n2. If insertion point is 0, there's no element less than x. So append x to the array.\n\n3. Else, replace the element at (insertion point -1) with x.\n\nBut wait, this would not work. Because in the example [3,1,4,1,5,9], the array would be:\n\n3 \u2192 added. [3]\n\n1: insertion point is 0, append. [3,1]. Wait, but this array is not sorted. So this approach is invalid because the array must be kept sorted to allow binary search.\n\nAh, right. So the array must be maintained in sorted order. So in the previous approach, we can't append in a way that makes the array unsorted. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the first element in the array that is >=x, and if there are elements before that, replace the largest element less than x with x. Otherwise, add x to the array.\n\nWait, but how to keep the array sorted. For example:\n\nProcessing 3: array is empty. Add 3. [3]\n\nProcessing 1: lower_bound returns 0 (since 3 >=1). Insertion point is 0. insertion point -1 is -1. So no element. So add 1 to array. But array becomes [3,1], which is not sorted. So this approach is invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that appending elements in this way would not maintain the array in sorted order. So this approach must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the initial idea of using the array as a multiset and replacing elements as needed to keep it sorted is not working. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nThe correct approach would be to maintain the array in a sorted manner. For each new number, find the position where it can replace an element in the array such that the array remains sorted, and the replaced element is the largest possible smaller than the current number. Then, replace that element with the current number, keeping the array sorted.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the array is kept sorted in ascending order. For a new number x:\n\nWe need to find the first element in the array that is >=x. Let's call this index. Then, the largest element less than x is at index-1. So if index is 0, there's no such element. So we need to append x to the array. But if index is >0, then we replace array[index-1] with x.\n\nWait, but replacing array[index-1] with x would make the array still sorted. Because array[index-1] < x (since index is the first element >=x, the elements before index are <x). So replacing array[index-1] with x would be array[index-1] = x, which is greater than array[index-2] (if exists), but array[index] is >=x. Wait, this would break the sorted order.\n\nFor example, if array is [1,3,5], and x is 4. The insertion point (lower_bound) for 4 is 2 (element 5 is >=4). So index-1 is 1 (element 3). Replacing 3 with 4 gives [1,4,5], which is sorted. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: array is [3], x is 1. Insertion point is 0 (since 3 >=1). index-1 is -1. So append 1. Now array is [3,1], which is not sorted. So this approach is invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that when we have to add a new element because no smaller element exists, adding it to the end would break the sorted order. So this approach only works if the elements are added in a way that maintains the sorted array.\n\nBut how to handle this. Ah! Wait, the correct approach is to find the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to x, and replace the element at that position. If all elements are less than x, then append x. Wait, but that's the standard approach for LIS. For example, the array is kept sorted, and for each x, find the first element >=x and replace it with x. If none, append x. The length of the array is the length of the LIS.\n\nBut in our problem, the code is trying to find the minimal number of sequences such that each sequence is strictly increasing. The algorithm for this is to find the minimal number of such sequences, which is equivalent to the size of the array after this process.\n\nWait, but I thought the original Java code's answer was the sum of the counts, but according to the multiset approach, the answer is the array size. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to partition the sequence into the minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences. According to the greedy algorithm, the answer is the size of the array after processing all elements using the standard approach where each new element is placed in the first possible subsequence (which is the one with the smallest possible last element greater than the current element). Wait, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, according to the problem's solution, the minimal number of required sequences is equal to the maximum frequency of any element. For example, if a number appears k times, you need at least k sequences. But there's also a relation to the LIS. The minimal number of required sequences is equal to the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence in the original array. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the problem here is that the code is trying to find the minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences. According to the Dilworth's theorem, the minimal number of chains (subsequences) needed to partition a partially ordered set is equal to the size of the largest antichain. In this case, the partially ordered set is the elements of the array, with a \u2264 b if a < b and a appears before b. The antichain would be the maximum number of elements that are all incomparable, which is equivalent to the longest decreasing subsequence. Wait, maybe not. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach where each element is added to the earliest possible subsequence. Let's think again about the example:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n\nProcessing each number:\n\n3 \u2192 starts a new sequence. Sequences: [[3]]\n\n1 \u2192 starts a new sequence. Sequences: [[3], [1]]\n\n4 \u2192 can be added to [3]. Now [[3,4], [1]]\n\n1 \u2192 can't be added to [3,4], so starts a new sequence. Sequences: [[3,4], [1], [1]]\n\n5 \u2192 can be added to [3,4]. Now [[3,4,5], [1], [1]]\n\n9 \u2192 can be added to [3,4,5]. Now [[3,4,5,9], [1], [1]]\n\nThe answer is 3, which is the number of sequences. Wait, but in this case, the number of sequences is 3, but the array size in the algorithm I described earlier would be 3. Let's see how the algorithm would process this.\n\nInitialize array as empty.\n\nProcess 3: append to array. array = [3]\n\nProcess 1: find insertion point. lower_bound(1) in [3] is index 0. Since index-1 is -1, append. array becomes [3,1]. But this is not sorted. So this approach is invalid.\n\nSo the previous approach of appending to the array when no lower element exists is wrong because it destroys the sorted order. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the initial idea to use a multiset and maintain it sorted is necessary. So, perhaps the correct approach is to maintain a sorted array where each time we find the first element that is greater than or equal to the current number, replace it with the current number. But this is the standard approach for finding the LIS length, which gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence. But the problem here is different. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe original Java code's answer is the sum of the counts in the TreeMap. For the example I considered earlier, the answer was 3. But in that example, the minimal number of sequences is 2. Because:\n\nSequences could be [3,4,5,9], [1,1,5,9]. Wait, but 5 appears twice here. Wait, no. Wait, the two sequences are:\n\nFirst sequence: 3 \u21924 \u21925 \u21929\n\nSecond sequence: 1 \u21921 \u21925 \u21929?\n\nBut that's invalid because 1 is followed by 1 (not strictly increasing). Oh right, the code uses lowerKey, which is strictly less. So sequences must be strictly increasing. So in the example, the sequences would be:\n\nFor the input [3,1,4,1,5,9], the sequences would be:\n\n[3,4,5,9]\n\n[1,5,9]\n\n[1]\n\nSo that's three sequences. Which matches the answer from the original code.\n\nSo the minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences is 3. How does the array approach work here?\n\nIf the array is maintained as sorted, and for each new element, we find the first element in the array that is >= current element. If found, replace it with current element. If not, append. Then the array's length would be the LIS length, which in this case is 4 (3,4,5,9). So the answer would be 4, which is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the original code, the answer is 3. So this suggests that the array approach I described earlier is not suitable. Therefore, the initial approach of trying to model the TreeMap with counts is necessary.\n\nSo, back to the original problem. We need to model the TreeMap with counts. Each key in the map is the end of some sequences, and the count is the number of sequences ending with that key.\n\nIn C, how to implement this. Since we can't use a TreeMap, perhaps we can maintain a dynamic array of structs, each struct containing a key and a count, and keep the array sorted by key. For each new number, perform a binary search to find the largest key less than the current number. If found, decrease the count (and remove the key if count becomes zero). Then, check if the current number exists in the array, and either increment its count or add it with count 1.\n\nBut implementing this requires:\n\n1. A sorted array of structs with 'key' and 'count'.\n2. For each new number, binary search for the largest key less than the number.\n3. If found, decrement its count, possibly removing it.\n4. Then, check if the current number exists in the array. If so, increment its count. Otherwise, insert it with count 1.\n\nThis can be done but requires efficient insertion and deletion in a sorted array. For small n, this would be manageable, but for large n (like up to 1e5), this would be O(n^2) time, which is not acceptable. However, the original Java code uses a TreeMap, which has O(log n) time for each operation. So the C code must also have O(n log n) time.\n\nTherefore, perhaps using a balanced binary search tree is the way to go. But implementing a BST with the required operations (find largest less than x, update counts, etc.) is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find another way to model the problem.\n\nWait, the original code's logic can be rephrased as:\n\nEach time a number x is processed:\n\n- Find the largest key less than x in the map. Let's call this key 'k'.\n- If such k exists, we take one sequence that ends with k and replace its end with x. So the count for k decreases by 1, and the count for x increases by 1.\n- If no such k exists, we start a new sequence with x.\n\nSo the sum of counts is the total number of sequences.\n\nIn the C code, we need to model this.\n\nSo, the problem is to track a multiset of sequence ends, and for each x, find the largest element in the multiset that is less than x. If found, remove it and add x. If not found, add x.\n\nThe multiset approach would model this. The total number of elements in the multiset is the answer.\n\nBut how to implement a multiset in C that allows efficient lower_bound and insertion/removal.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a dynamic array maintained in sorted order. For each x:\n\n- Use binary search to find the largest element less than x. If found, remove that element and insert x into the array. If not found, insert x. The array remains sorted.\n\nBut inserting into and deleting from a dynamic array is O(n) time, which is not acceptable for large n.\n\nHmm, but in Java, TreeMap is implemented as a Red-Black tree, which allows O(log n) operations. So for the C code, the challenge is to find a way to perform these operations efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need to track the counts for each key, perhaps we can use a sorted array and binary search, but for each insertion, we can merge counts.\n\nBut this depends on the input. For example, if the same key appears multiple times, the counts can be merged. So for example, if the array is sorted, and for a new key x, if it exists in the array, we can simply increment its count. If not, we can insert it in the correct position.\n\nBut when we need to find the largest key less than x, we can use binary search to find the position where x would be inserted, then check the previous element.\n\nSo the steps for the C code would be:\n\n1. Maintain a sorted array of structs (key, count). The array is sorted by key in ascending order.\n\n2. For each new number x:\n\n   a. Use binary search to find the insertion position of x (lower_bound).\n\n   b. The largest key less than x would be at index (insertion_pos - 1).\n\n   c. If insertion_pos > 0:\n\n       i. Get the key at insertion_pos -1. Let's call it k.\n\n       ii. Decrease the count of k by 1. If the count becomes 0, remove the element from the array.\n\n   d. Then, check if x exists in the array:\n\n       i. Find the position of x using binary search.\n\n       ii. If found, increment its count by 1.\n\n       iii. If not found, insert x into the array with count 1.\n\n3. After processing all numbers, sum all counts in the array to get the answer.\n\nBut this approach requires:\n\n- Binary search to find insertion position.\n\n- Binary search to check if x exists in the array.\n\n- Removing and inserting elements in the array, which can be O(n) time for each operation.\n\nThis would be acceptable for small n (like n up to 1e4), but for larger n (like 1e5), this would be O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, this approach is not suitable for large inputs. However, the original Java code's approach is O(n log n), but in C, without a TreeMap, this is challenging.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we need to find a way to model the problem with a different approach, avoiding the need for a TreeMap.\n\nLet me think again about the problem. The key operation is: for each x, find the largest key less than x. Then, decrease that key's count and increase x's count.\n\nSuppose we can model the sequence ends as a multiset, and for each x, find the predecessor (largest element less than x) in the multiset. If there is a predecessor, remove one occurrence of it and add x. If not, add x.\n\nIn this case, the answer is the total number of elements in the multiset after processing all x.\n\nSo, the multiset approach is equivalent to the original code's logic. The sum of the counts in the TreeMap is the same as the number of elements in the multiset.\n\nTherefore, if we can model the multiset in C, allowing for efficient predecessor queries and insertions/removals, the code can be written with that.\n\nIn C++, we can use a std::multiset and use upper_bound or lower_bound to find the predecessor. But in C, we need to implement this ourselves.\n\nImplementing a balanced BST in C is time-consuming. An alternative is to use a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a Segment Tree, but these require the keys to be in a manageable range. Since the input numbers can be up to 1e9 (assuming), this is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to use a dynamic array and keep it sorted, but this would have O(n) time per insertion/deletion, which is not acceptable for large n.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's constraints are small. Let's check the original problem's constraints. The code is from AtCoder ABC134E. Looking up the problem, the constraints are N up to 1e5. So, O(n^2) algorithms would be too slow.\n\nThus, the approach of using a dynamic array is not feasible for N=1e5. Therefore, we need a more efficient data structure.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each time we process a number x, we can use the same logic as the original code but replace the TreeMap with a Fenwick Tree (BIT) or a Segment Tree that can handle the necessary operations.\n\nWait, but how to map the keys to indexes in the BIT. If the keys are large, coordinate compression is needed.\n\nLet me think. The steps are:\n\n1. For each x, find the largest key less than x.\n\n2. If such a key exists, decrease its count and increase x's count.\n\n3. Otherwise, increase x's count.\n\nThe problem is to track the counts for each key, with the ability to query for the largest key less than x.\n\nThis is similar to maintaining a dynamic set of keys with counts, supporting:\n\n- Predecessor query: find the largest key less than x.\n\n- Update the count of a key.\n\nSo, this requires an ordered data structure that can support predecessor queries and updates.\n\nIn C, the only way to do this efficiently is to use a balanced BST library. However, since C does not have a built-in library for this, I would need to implement it, which is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a treap or other balanced BST implementation. But this is beyond the scope for a code translation.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the same approach as the Java code but using a dynamic array and binary search, but this would not work for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to model the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved with the same approach as the LIS problem but with a multiset. Let's think again.\n\nThe minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences needed to partition the array is equal to the maximal frequency of any element. For example, if the input is [1,1,1,1], the answer is 4. But according to the algorithm where each element is placed in the earliest possible subsequence, the answer would also be 4.\n\nBut according to the original code's approach:\n\nProcessing each 1:\n\nFor the first 1, no lower key, count is 1.\n\nSecond 1: no lower key (since 1's lower key is none), count becomes 2.\n\nThird 1: count becomes 3.\n\nFourth 1: count becomes 4.\n\nSum is 4.\n\nWhich matches the maximal frequency.\n\nSo, the answer is the maximum between the maximal frequency of any element and the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence. But this is getting into the theory.\n\nBut in any case, for the code translation, the original Java code is using a TreeMap with counts, and the sum of counts is the answer.\n\nSo, the correct approach for the C code is to:\n\n- Use a sorted array to track the keys and their counts.\n\n- For each new number x:\n\n   a. Find the largest key less than x using binary search.\n\n   b. If found, decrease its count by 1, and increase x's count by 1.\n\n   c. If not found, increase x's count by 1.\n\nBut in C, implementing this with an array is O(n) per operation, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nThus, the Java code's approach is not directly translatable to C with the same time complexity unless we use a balanced BST.\n\nBut since this is a code translation task, perhaps the answer expected is the C code using a dynamic array approach, even if it's O(n^2) time, assuming that the problem's test cases are small. However, given that the original problem is from AtCoder ABC134E, which likely has n up to 1e5, such an approach would not be feasible.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to realize that the original code's logic can be replaced with the multiset approach, and the answer is the size of the multiset. And this multiset can be represented in C as a dynamic array maintained in sorted order, with each insertion being handled by replacing the first possible predecessor element.\n\nBut how to maintain the array in sorted order when inserting new elements.\n\nWait, here's the correct approach for the multiset:\n\nEach time a new number x is processed:\n\n- Use binary search to find the first element in the sorted array that is >= x.\n\n- The predecessor is the element before this position.\n\n- If the predecessor exists, replace it with x.\n\n- If not, append x to the array.\n\nBut maintaining the array in sorted order.\n\nWait, no. Because replacing the predecessor with x may not keep the array sorted. For example:\n\nArray is [1,3,4], x=2.\n\nPredecessor is 1. Replace 1 with 2. The array becomes [2,3,4], which is sorted.\n\nAnother example: array is [3], x=1. Predecessor does not exist. Append 1. Array becomes [3,1], which is not sorted.\n\nSo this approach is invalid.\n\nThus, this suggests that the multiset approach is not feasible unless the array is maintained in sorted order.\n\nSo the correct way to maintain the array in sorted order is:\n\nFor each x:\n\n- Find the first element in the array that is >= x. Let's call this index 'pos'.\n\n- If pos is 0, there is no predecessor. So x is added to the array. But to maintain sorted order, x should be added to the beginning. But in this case, x is smaller than all existing elements.\n\nWait, but adding x to the beginning may not be correct. For example, array is [3], x=1. The predecessor does not exist. So we add x. The array becomes [1,3], which is sorted.\n\nAh! So to maintain the array in sorted order, when the predecessor does not exist, x is the smallest element, and is inserted at the beginning.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nThe correct steps for the multiset approach are:\n\nFor each x:\n\n1. Find the first element in the array that is >= x using binary search. Let's call this position 'pos'.\n\n2. If pos == 0, it means all elements are >=x. So x is inserted at the beginning.\n\n3. Else, replace the element at pos-1 with x.\n\nBut this approach ensures that the array remains sorted.\n\nLet's see with examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInitial array: [3,4,5]\n\nx = 2.\n\npos is 0 (all elements >=2). So replace pos-1 (invalid), so insert at beginning. Array becomes [2,4,5]. Which is sorted.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInitial array: [3,4,5]\n\nx = 3.\n\npos is 0. Wait, no. lower_bound(3) in [3,4,5] is index 0. So pos is 0. So we replace pos-1 (invalid). So insert at beginning. Array becomes [3,3,4,5], which is not sorted. So this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no. The lower_bound for x=3 in [3,4,5] is the first element >=3, which is index 0. So pos is 0. So the predecessor is pos-1 which is invalid. So we insert x at the beginning, which would be [3,3,4,5], but this is not sorted. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the logic is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each x:\n\nFind the first element in the array that is >x. The position where x would be inserted to maintain sorted order is 'pos'. The predecessor is the element at pos-1, which is <=x.\n\nIf predecessor is <x, replace it with x. This maintains the sorted order.\n\nIf predecessor is equal to x, then x can't be placed after it since the sequences must be strictly increasing.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array as containing the smallest possible last elements of the sequences. For each x, find the first element in the array that is >=x. If found, replace it with x. If not found, append x.\n\nBut this is the standard LIS algorithm, which gives the length of the LIS.\n\nBut in our case, the answer is the size of the array after this process.\n\nBut according to the original code's example, this approach gives a different answer. For example:\n\nInput: [3,1,4,1,5,9]\n\nProcessing using LIS approach:\n\n3 \u2192 array becomes [3]\n\n1 \u2192 find first >=1 (index 0), replace 3 with 1 \u2192 array [1]\n\n4 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4]\n\n1 \u2192 find first >=1 (index 0), replace 1 with 1 \u2192 array [1,4]\n\n5 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4,5]\n\n9 \u2192 append \u2192 [1,4,5,9]. Size is 4. But the correct answer is 3.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nSo, the problem is that the original code's approach requires finding the largest element less than x, not the first element >=x.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach for the multiset is to find the largest element less than x. If found, replace it with x. If not found, add x. This way, the array is maintained in a way that each element is as small as possible, allowing new elements to be added to existing sequences.\n\nTo implement this in C:\n\nThe array is kept sorted in ascending order.\n\nFor each x:\n\n- Perform a binary search to find the largest element less than x. Let's call it 'k'.\n\n- If found, remove 'k' from the array and insert x.\n\n- If not found, insert x.\n\nThe answer is the size of the array.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search for the largest element less than x.\n\nThis can be done by finding the lower_bound of x (the first element >=x), then the largest element less than x is at position (lower_bound_index -1).\n\nIf lower_bound_index == 0, then there is no such element.\n\nOnce found, replace that element with x. But inserting x into the array may require maintaining the sorted order.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nArray is [1,3,4]. x is 2.\n\nlower_bound of 2 is index 1 (element 3 >=2). So the largest element less than 2 is 1 (index 0). Replace it with 2. Now array becomes [2,3,4], which is sorted.\n\nAnother example: array is [3,4,5], x=1. lower_bound of 1 is 0. So no element less than x. Add x to the beginning. Array becomes [1,3,4,5], sorted.\n\nAnother example: array is [1,4,5], x=3. lower_bound of 3 is index 1 (element 4 >=3). largest element less than 3 is 1 (index 0). Replace with 3. array becomes [3,4,5].\n\nAnother example: array is [3], x=3. lower_bound is 0 (element 3 >=3). largest element less than x is at index -1. So add x. array becomes [3,3], which is not sorted.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because x=3 is equal to the existing element. So adding it would break the sorted order. But according to the algorithm, if there is no element less than x, we add x. But this results in a sorted array if x is added to the end.\n\nWait, but in the example where array is [3], x=3, the lower_bound is 0. largest element less than x is index -1. So we add x to the array. So the array becomes [3,3], which is not sorted. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm must have a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the original problem, sequences are strictly increasing. So two consecutive elements in the same sequence must be strictly increasing. So when a new element x is equal to an existing element in a sequence, it cannot be appended. Hence, for x=3, if the array has a 3, we cannot replace any element (since 3 is not less than x). So a new sequence must be created.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, x=3 would be added to the array, increasing its size. But this would break the sorted order.\n\nThus, the algorithm must be modified to handle equal elements correctly.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each x:\n\n- Find the largest element less than x in the array.\n\n- If found, replace it with x.\n\n- Else, add x to the array.\n\nBut the array must be kept sorted in ascending order.\n\nBut when x is added to the array, it must be inserted in the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\nSo, in the example where the array is [3], x=3:\n\nNo element is less than x, so x is added to the array. The array becomes [3,3], which is not sorted. So this approach is wrong.\n\nThus, the correct way is to insert x in the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\nThus, after replacing or adding x, the array must be sorted.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm must be:\n\nFor each x:\n\n1. Find the largest element less than x. Let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. If 'k' exists:\n\n   a. Remove 'k' from the array.\n\n   b. Insert x into the array in the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\n3. Else:\n\n   a. Insert x into the array in the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\nThe array remains sorted after each step.\n\nBut how to efficiently find 'k' and perform these operations.\n\nImplementing this in C requires:\n\n- For each x:\n\n   a. Binary search to find the largest element less than x.\n\n   b. Remove that element from the array if found.\n\n   c. Insert x into the array in the correct position.\n\nBut these operations are O(n) time for each insertion and deletion, which is not feasible for large n.\n\nGiven that the original problem's n is up to 1e5, this approach would be too slow.\n\nThus, the only feasible way to implement this in C with acceptable time complexity is to use a balanced BST. However, implementing a BST is complex.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a library like GLib's balanced BST, but assuming that we can't use such libraries, we have to find a way.\n\nBut given that this is a code translation task and the user expects a C code, perhaps the expected answer is to use the dynamic array approach, even though it's O(n^2), which would work for small n.\n\nBut considering that the original problem likely expects an O(n log n) solution, perhaps the code should use the approach of maintaining a dynamic array where each insertion is done via binary search and the array is kept sorted, with the answer being the size of the array.\n\nBut this leads us back to the problem of how to correctly maintain the array.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Let's think again.\n\nThe correct algorithm for the minimal number of strictly increasing subsequences is to find the maximum number of occurrences of any element. Because each occurrence of the same element must be in a separate sequence.\n\nFor example, if the input is [1,1,1], the answer is 3.\n\nBut according to the algorithm where we replace predecessors, let's see:\n\nProcess 1:\n\nArray is empty. Add 1. Array: [1]. Size=1.\n\nProcess 1:\n\nFind largest element less than 1 (none). Add 1. Array: [1,1]. Not sorted.\n\nThis approach gives size 2, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the maximum between the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence and the maximum frequency of any element.\n\nBut this is getting into the theory of the problem. But for the code translation, perhaps the original code's approach is the correct way, and the answer must be translated as such.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the code must be translated to C using a sorted array of keys with counts, and for each key, find the predecessor using binary search. But for large n, this would be O(n^2) time.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, in C code:\n\nWe can represent the TreeMap as an array of structs containing keys and counts, sorted by key.\n\nFor each number x:\n\n- Use binary search to find the largest key less than x.\n\n- If found, decrement its count and remove if count becomes zero.\n\n- Then, insert x into the array, incrementing its count if it exists, or adding it with count 1.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Initialize an array of structs, sorted by key.\n\n3. For each x in the input:\n\n   a. Use binary search to find the largest key less than x.\n\n   b. If found:\n\n       i. Decrement its count.\n\n       ii. If count is zero, remove it from the array.\n\n   c. Insert x into the array:\n\n       i. Find if x exists in the array using binary search.\n\n       ii. If exists, increment its count.\n\n       iii. Else, insert x with count 1, maintaining the sorted order.\n\n4. Sum all counts in the array and print.\n\nBut inserting and removing elements from a dynamic array is O(n) time.\n\nFor example, inserting x into a sorted array requires shifting elements to the right.\n\nThus, this approach is O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's constraints allow this approach. But given that the code is from AtCoder ABC134E, which has n up to 2e5, this approach would be too slow.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach must be to find a way to model the problem using a data structure with O(log n) operations per step.\n\nBut in C, this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the original code's TreeMap is used to track counts for keys, perhaps the problem can be transformed into using a Fenwick Tree (BIT) with coordinate compression. For each x, we want to find the largest key less than x, then update the count for x.\n\nBut this requires the keys to be processed in a certain way.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Compress all possible x values into a range.\n\n2. For each x, find the largest key less than x using a BIT.\n\n3. Update the counts in the BIT.\n\nBut this approach would require maintaining the maximum count for each x and predecessor.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a greedy algorithm where each x is added to the earliest possible sequence. This can be implemented using a multiset.\n\nBut in C, the only way to do this is to implement a balanced BST.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps the correct code translation is to use a dynamic array with sorted elements and binary search, even though it's O(n^2), but with the note that this approach is only feasible for small n.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a translation of the given Java code, which uses TreeMap, and the C code is expected to be correct for the problem, even if it's not efficient, we can proceed.\n\nSo, the steps to translate the code:\n\n- Use a dynamic array to represent the TreeMap's keys and counts.\n\n- Keep the array sorted by keys.\n\n- For each x:\n\n   a. Find the largest key less than x using binary search.\n\n   b. If found, decrement its count and remove if necessary.\n\n   c. Insert or increment x's count in the array.\n\n- Sum all counts in the array.\n\nImplementing this in C:\n\nWe'll need to manage the array dynamically, using realloc.\n\nFor binary search, we can use the standard bsearch function, or implement our own.\n\nBut for finding the largest key less than x, we can perform a binary search to find the insertion position of x and then check the previous element.\n\nFor example:\n\nint find_lower(int *keys, int len, int x) {\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = len - 1;\n    int res = -1;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = (left + right) / 2;\n        if (keys[mid] < x) {\n            res = mid;\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nThis function returns the index of the largest key less than x.\n\nBut the keys array must be sorted in ascending order.\n\nOnce we find this index, we can decrement the count for that key.\n\nThen, for inserting x, we need to find if x is already present in the array. If so, increment its count. Otherwise, insert x into the array in the correct position and set count to 1.\n\nBut maintaining the array requires shifting elements, which is O(n) time per insertion.\n\nBut for the purpose of code translation, we proceed.\n\nThus, the C code would look something like this:\n\nBut due to time and space constraints, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut first, we need to represent the keys and counts. We can use two separate arrays: one for keys and one for counts, kept sorted by keys.\n\nBut in C, managing dynamic arrays of structs would be better.\n\nSo:\n\nstruct entry {\n    int key;\n    int count;\n};\n\nstruct entry *entries = NULL;\nint size = 0;\n\nFor each x in the input:\n\n1. Find the index of the largest key less than x.\n\n2. If found:\n\n   a. Decrement the count of that entry.\n\n   b. If the count becomes zero, remove the entry from the array.\n\n3. Find the index where x is present in the array.\n\n4. If found, increment the count of that entry.\n\n5. Else, insert a new entry with key x and count 1.\n\nThe code would be complex due to the dynamic array management and binary searches.\n\nBut given time constraints, here's the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nstruct Entry {\n    int key;\n    int count;\n};\n\nint compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return ((struct Entry *)a)->key - ((struct Entry *)b)->key;\n}\n\n// Binary search to find the index of the largest entry with key < x\nint find_lower(struct Entry *entries, int size, int x) {\n    int left = 0, right = size - 1;\n    int res = -1;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (entries[mid].key < x) {\n            res = mid;\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\n// Binary search to find the index of entry with key == x\nint find_exact(struct Entry *entries, int size, int x) {\n    int left = 0, right = size - 1;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (entries[mid].key == x) {\n            return mid;\n        } else if (entries[mid].key < x) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, x;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    \n    struct Entry *entries = NULL;\n    int size = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n        \n        // Find the largest key less than x\n        int lower_idx = find_lower(entries, size, x);\n        \n        if (lower_idx != -1) {\n            // Decrement the count of the found entry\n            entries[lower_idx].count--;\n            if (entries[lower_idx].count == 0) {\n                // Remove the entry at lower_idx\n                for (int j = lower_idx; j < size - 1; ++j) {\n                    entries[j] = entries[j + 1];\n                }\n                size--;\n                // Reallocate to free memory if needed\n                entries = realloc(entries, size * sizeof(struct Entry));\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // Now, add x to the entries\n        int exact_idx = find_exact(entries, size, x);\n        if (exact_idx != -1) {\n            entries[exact_idx].count++;\n        } else {\n            // Insert new entry\n            struct Entry new_entry = {x, 1};\n            // Find the insertion point to keep the array sorted\n            int insert_idx = 0;\n            while (insert_idx < size && entries[insert_idx].key < x) {\n                insert_idx++;\n            }\n            entries = realloc(entries, (size + 1) * sizeof(struct Entry));\n            // Shift elements to make space\n            for (int j = size; j > insert_idx; --j) {\n                entries[j] = entries[j - 1];\n            }\n            entries[insert_idx] = new_entry;\n            size++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate the sum of counts\n    int ans = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\n        ans += entries[i].count;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    \n    free(entries);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut this code has several issues:\n\n1. The binary search functions (find_lower and find_exact) are linear and may not work correctly with a dynamically changing array. The array must be kept sorted after each insertion and deletion.\n\n2. The insertion and deletion steps use for loops to shift elements, which is O(n) time per operation, leading to O(n^2) time complexity. This would be too slow for large n.\n\nHowever, given that the original Java code uses a TreeMap, this C code is the closest translation, even if it's not efficient for large inputs. It accurately models the steps of the original code but uses dynamic arrays and linear searches for insertion and deletion.\n\nThis code will work correctly for small inputs but may not pass time constraints for large ones. However, given the user's request to translate the code, this is the best possible approach without implementing a more complex data structure."
