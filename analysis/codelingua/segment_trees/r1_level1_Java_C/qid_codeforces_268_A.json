    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe code reads an integer n from input. Then, it initializes two arrays h and g, each of size n. It reads n pairs of integers, storing them in h and g. Then, for each element in h, it checks how many times it appears in the g array, summing up all those occurrences. Finally, it prints the total count.\n\nSo, in C, I need to replicate this behavior. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, reading the input. In Java, they use Scanner, but in C, I'll use scanf. The first input is n, which is straightforward. Then, for each of the n lines, read two integers into h[i] and g[i].\n\nWait, the original Java code uses sc.nextLine() after nextInt() might have issues, but looking at the code: the Java code reads n via nextLine(), then uses nextInt() in a loop. Wait, actually, in the Java code, after reading n with nextLine(), then for each i from 0 to n-1, it reads h[i] and g[i] via nextInt(). But in Java, nextInt() leaves the newline in the buffer. However, since each pair is on a separate line, perhaps the input is provided such that each h[i] and g[i] are on the same line, separated by whitespace. So the Scanner's nextInt() will handle that correctly.\n\nIn C, reading n can be done with scanf(\"%d\", &n). Then, loop n times, each time reading two integers into h[i] and g[i].\n\nSo in C, I'll need to declare the arrays h and g. But since n is read at runtime, in C99 or using a compiler that supports variable-length arrays (VLA), I can declare them as int h[n], g[n]. Alternatively, if VLAs are not allowed, perhaps use dynamic allocation with malloc. But for simplicity, assuming the code can use VLA.\n\nThen, the nested loops: for each i and j, if h[i] == g[j], increment result. That's straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate arrays h and g of size n.\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1, read h[i] and g[i].\n\nInitialize result to 0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1, loop j from 0 to n-1, check if h[i] == g[j], increment result.\n\nPrint result.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nIn C, when reading input with scanf, if the input is not properly formatted, it might lead to issues. But assuming the input is correct as per the problem's requirements.\n\nAlso, in Java, the arrays are zero-initialized, but in C, when we declare them, their contents are undefined until assigned. But in the code, all elements are read from input, so that's okay.\n\nSo code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int h[n], g[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &h[i], &g[i]);\n    }\n    int result = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n            if (h[i] == g[j]) {\n                result++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the outer loop is for i and inner for j. So the same here. So the code should be correct.\n\nTesting with sample input. Let's say sample input:\n\n3\n1 2\n2 4\n3 4\n\nh is [1,2,3], g is [2,4,4].\n\nThen checking each h[i] in g:\n\nh[0] =1: appears 0 times in g.\n\nh[1]=2: appears once in g[0].\n\nh[2]=3: 0 times.\n\nSo total is 1. So the code would output 1. Which seems correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nOriginal code's sample? Let me think. For example, the problem statement might be about teams playing home and away games. Each team's home color is h[i], and when they play away, their away color is g[i]. The problem counts how many times a team's home color is the same as another team's away color.\n\nSo the code counts all pairs (i,j) where h[i] == g[j], including i=j? Because in the nested loops, j runs over all elements. So if a team's home color is same as its own away color, it's counted. But in the problem statement, perhaps the teams are playing against each other. Wait, perhaps the problem is that when team i plays at home against team j, they wear h[i], and team j wears g[j]. Then for each pair of teams (i,j) where i != j, if h[i] == g[j], count it. But in the code given, it counts all i and j, including when i equals j. So maybe the problem allows that. Because the code counts for all i and j, even same indices.\n\nSo when translating to C, the code must replicate that.\n\nBut the original code's approach is correct as per the problem's requirements. So the C code is correct.\n\nSo the code looks correct. I think that's the translation."
