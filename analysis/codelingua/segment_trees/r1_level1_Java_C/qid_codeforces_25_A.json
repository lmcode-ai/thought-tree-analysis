So in C, I'll have to adjust for that. Wait, but the original code uses indexes 1 to n, so maybe in C, I should make the array start at 1 as well. But in C, arrays are zero-based by default, so perhaps I should allocate an array of size n, and then adjust the loop indices. Alternatively, allocate n+1 elements and use 1-based indexing, similar to Java.\n\nLet me see. The Java code has array of size n+1, then loops from 1 to n. So in C, I can declare the array as int array[n+1], and then start from 1. That's manageable. So in C, when I read the input, for each i from 1 to n, read into array[i].\n\nThen, the code counts the number of even and odd numbers, keeping track of their indices. Then, if the number of odds is greater than evens, output the even index (since the majority is odd, the even index is the outlier), else output the odd index.\n\nSo the logic is straightforward.\n\nNow, translating to C. Let's start by including necessary headers. For input, we'll need stdio.h. Then, the main function.\n\nIn C, we don't have a Scanner class. We use scanf. So the first part is to read n. Then, create the array. But in C, variable-length arrays are possible if the compiler supports C99. Alternatively, we can use dynamic allocation. Since the Java code uses n+1, maybe the C code should do the same.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n1. Read integer n using scanf.\n\n2. Declare an array of size n+1. But in C, when you declare int array[n+1], n must be a known value. So after reading n, we can declare the array. However, in older C standards, variable-length arrays are not allowed. But assuming the user is using C99 or later, it's okay. Alternatively, we can use dynamic memory with malloc. Let's go with variable-length arrays here for simplicity.\n\nSo:\n\nint n;\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\nint array[n+1]; // indexes 0..n, but use 1..n.\n\nThen, loop from 1 to n, read each element:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &array[i]);\n}\n\nThen, variables to track counts and indices:\n\nint odd = 0, even = 0;\nint odd_ind = 0, even_ind = 0;\n\nLoop through each element again, check if even or odd.\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    if (array[i] % 2 == 0) {\n        even++;\n        even_ind = i;\n    } else {\n        odd++;\n        odd_ind = i;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, compare odd and even counts.

Let me think. Suppose n is 3, and the elements are at positions 1, 2, 3. So when the code checks each element, it's correct. So the indices stored in even_ind and odd_ind are 1-based, which matches the problem's requirement. Because in the original problem, the first element is position 1, so the code should output the 1-based index. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the translation is straightforward. The only thing to note is the 1-based array in C, but since Java and C can both handle that by starting the loop at 1, the code remains the same.\n\nNow, possible edge cases. For example, if all but one are even. But the code handles that by counting and checking which count is higher.\n\nSo the C code should work as intended."
