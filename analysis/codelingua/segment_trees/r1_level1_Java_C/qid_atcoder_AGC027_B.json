But in C, the max function can be implemented with a ternary operator. So max(k -i, 0) is (k -i >0) ? (k -i) : 0. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum of (k-i and 0). So if k-i is larger than 0, then k-i, else 0. Wait, but xsum is defined for 0 to N. So when k is 0, xsum[k] is xsum[0] =0, and if k-i is negative, Math.max(k-i,0) is 0. So in C, for the max part, we can write (k - i >=0) ? (k -i) : 0. But in the code, xsum[k] - xsum[Math.max(k -i, 0)]. So in C, xsum[k] - xsum[ (k -i) >=0 ? (k -i) : 0 ] Now, variables in C need to be declared. So for the inner loop, j starts at 5, k starts at N -i. Then, in each iteration, j increases by 2, k decreases by i.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main logic is in the solve method. It reads N and X, then an array x of N elements. It computes some prefix sums in xsum. Then it calculates an answer by iterating through possible values of i and computing a cost function, which involves some nested loops and calculations based on the xsum array.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle input in C. Java uses Scanner, but in C, I'll use scanf. The variables N and X are read first. Then, the x array is read, which in C would be a dynamic array or a fixed-size array if we know N's maximum possible value. Since the problem probably allows large N, but in practice for programming contests, maybe we can assume a maximum. But in C, it's better to allocate dynamically. However, the original code uses N up to whatever, so perhaps in the translation, we'll use a variable-length array (if C99 is allowed) or malloc.\n\nWait, the Java code creates x as a long array of size N, and xsum of size N+1. So in C, for xsum, we can have a similar approach. Let's see:\n\nIn Java:\nxsum[i + 1] = xsum[i] + x[i]\n\nIn C, we can do the same. So the xsum array is of size N+1, starting from 0 to N.\n\nNext, the initial ans is computed as X*N +5*xsum[N]. But wait, looking at the original code, the Java code has ans initially set to X*N +5*xsum[N], and then after the loop, it adds N*X again when printing. Wait, let me check the original code:\n\nIn the Java code's solve method:\n\nans is initialized to X*N +5 *xsum[N]\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N-1, compute cost = X*i +5*(xsum[N] - xsum[N-i])\n\nThen, after some loops, ans is updated to the minimum of ans and cost.\n\nFinally, the code prints ans + N*X.\n\nWait, that's strange. The initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N], then after the loop, the code adds N*X again. So the total printed is ans (after the loop) + N*X. But the initial ans already includes X*N. That might be a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nans = X*N +5 *xsum[N];\n\nThen, in the loop, for each i, compute cost = X*i +5*(xsum[N] -xsum[N-i]), then there's a nested loop adding j increments, etc. Then ans is the min between ans and cost. Finally, the code prints ans + N*X.\n\nWait, that's odd. The initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N]. Then, when printing, adding N*X again would make it X*N*2 +5xsum[N]. But perhaps there's an error here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code has a bug here? Let me check. The problem statement for which this code is written may clarify, but since I don't have that, perhaps there's a mistake in the code. But in any case, I need to translate it as-is.\n\nSo the Java code's final output is ans + N*X. But ans is initialized as X*N +5xsum[N]. So when printed, it's X*N +5xsum[N] + N*X (if the loop doesn't change ans). So that's 2*N*X +5xsum[N]. But that seems odd. Maybe the original code is wrong, but that's the code I need to translate.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let's proceed.\n\nIn the Java code, the initial ans is set to X*N +5*xsum[N]. Then in the loop, for each i, a cost is computed. Then, after the loop, the code adds N*X again. So the printed value is ans (the minimal cost after considering all i) plus N*X. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect. Let's see:\n\nIn the problem statement, perhaps the correct formula requires adding N*X again. But regardless, the translation should follow the original code.\n\nNow, moving to the C code. Let's structure the code step by step.\n\nFirst, in C, we can't have classes, so we'll write a main function. The variables will be declared in main. Since there's a for loop with i from 1 to N-1, which in Java is (int i =1; i <N; i++), in C, same.\n\nThe variables in Java are N (int), X (long), x array (long), xsum array (long). In C, we can use long long for these to match Java's 64-bit integers.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N and X from stdin. Use scanf with %d and %lld.\n\n2. Read N elements into x array. So x is a long long array of size N. Then compute xsum array, which is size N+1. xsum[0] is 0, xsum[1] = x[0], xsum[2] = xsum[1] + x[1], etc.\n\n3. Compute initial ans as X*N + 5 * xsum[N]. But wait, in the Java code, the code then adds N*X again at the end. So in the initial ans, X*N is part of the calculation, but then the final print adds N*X again. So that's a problem. Let me check:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nans = X * N + 5 * xsum[N];\n\nThen, in the loop, for each i, compute cost = X*i +5*(xsum[N] - xsum[N-i]). Then after some processing, ans is min(ans, cost). Then, after all loops, print ans + N * X.\n\nSo the initial ans includes X*N, but then the print statement adds another N*X. So the initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N], and the final output is ans + N*X. So if ans is not modified, the output would be (X*N +5xsum[N]) + N*X = 2*X*N +5xsum[N]. But the loop may modify ans. Hmm. That seems like a possible error. But perhaps the code is correct. Maybe the original problem's formula has some terms that require this.\n\nBut for the purposes of translation, I need to replicate the behavior, even if there's a possible error.\n\nSo in the C code, after computing ans as the minimal value (which starts with X*N +5xsum[N], and then may be updated in the loop), the code must add N*X again when printing.\n\nSo in the C code, the printf would be ans + N * X.\n\nNow, the loop for i from 1 to N-1:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < N; i++)\n\nIn C, same.\n\nFor each i, compute cost as X*i +5*(xsum[N] -xsum[N-i]). Then, for j starting at 5, k starting at N-i, and while k >=0, increment j by 2 each time, subtract i from k each time. For each step, add j*(xsum[k] -xsum[max(k-i, 0)]). But during this loop, if cost exceeds ans, break.\n\nThen, after the inner loop, set ans to the minimum between current ans and cost.\n\nSo in C, the code would be similar.\n\nBut in C, the max function can be implemented with a ternary operator. So max(k -i, 0) is (k -i >0) ? (k -i) : 0. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum of (k-i and 0). So if k-i is larger than 0, then k-i, else 0.\n\nWait, but xsum is defined for 0 to N. So when k is 0, xsum[k] is xsum[0] =0, and if k-i is negative, Math.max(k-i,0) is 0.\n\nSo in C, for the max part, we can write (k - i >=0) ? (k -i) : 0.\n\nBut in the code, xsum[k] - xsum[Math.max(k -i, 0)].\n\nSo in C, xsum[k] - xsum[ (k -i) >=0 ? (k -i) : 0 ]\n\nNow, variables in C need to be declared. So for the inner loop, j starts at 5, k starts at N -i. Then, in each iteration, j increases by 2, k decreases by i. The loop continues while k >=0.\n\nSo in C:\n\nfor (int j =5, k = N -i; k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\nBut in C, the for loop can't have multiple variables initialized with commas as in Java. Wait, in C, you can have multiple variables in the for loop's initializer and increment sections, as long as they are separated by commas. So:\n\nfor (j =5, k = (N -i); k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\nYes.\n\nSo the inner loop would be:\n\nfor (j =5, k = (N -i); k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\nBut in C, variables j and k must be declared. So inside the outer loop, inside the i loop, we can declare j and k. Wait, in C89, variables must be declared at the beginning of the block, but in C99, you can declare variables in for loops. So assuming C99 is allowed, which is common in programming contests, we can write:\n\nfor (int j =5, k = (N -i); k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\nBut N and i are variables here. So in C code:\n\nfor (int j =5, k = N -i; k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n\nSo inside this loop, if cost > ans, break. Then add to cost j * (xsum[k] -xsum[ max(k -i, 0) ]).\n\nNow, in C, the variables are long long. So all variables involved in large numbers should be declared as long long to prevent overflow.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nWe need to read N as int, X as long long. Then x is a long long array of N elements. xsum is a long long array of N+1 elements.\n\nIn C, dynamic allocation is needed. So:\n\nAfter reading N, allocate x as a long long array of size N. Then xsum as a long long array of size N+1.\n\nSo code:\n\nint N;\nlong long X;\nscanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &X);\nlong long *x = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\nlong long *xsum = (long long*)malloc( (N+1) * sizeof(long long));\nxsum[0] = 0;\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &x[i]);\n    xsum[i+1] = xsum[i] + x[i];\n}\n\nThen compute the initial ans:\n\nlong long ans = X * N + 5 * xsum[N];\n\nThen, loop for i from 1 to N-1:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < N; i++) {\n    long long cost = X * i + 5 * (xsum[N] - xsum[N -i]);\n    for (int j=5, k = N -i; k >=0; j +=2, k -=i) {\n        if (cost > ans) {\n            break;\n        }\n        int prev_k = k -i;\n        if (prev_k <0) prev_k =0;\n        cost += j * (xsum[k] - xsum[prev_k]);\n    }\n    if (cost < ans) {\n        ans = cost;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code says ans = Math.min(ans, cost), which would take the minimum each time. So in C, after computing cost, we compare it with ans and update ans if necessary.\n\nBut in Java, the inner loop can add to the cost, and after that, the code checks ans against cost and takes the minimum.\n\nThen, after all i's are processed, the code prints ans + N * X.\n\nSo the final output is ans + N*X.\n\nPutting it all together, the C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    long long X;\n    scanf(\"%d %lld\", &N, &X);\n    \n    long long *x = (long long*)malloc(N * sizeof(long long));\n    long long *xsum = (long long*)malloc((N + 1) * sizeof(long long));\n    xsum[0] = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%lld\", &x[i]);\n        xsum[i + 1] = xsum[i] + x[i];\n    }\n    \n    long long ans = X * N + 5 * xsum[N];\n    \n    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\n        long long cost = X * i + 5 * (xsum[N] - xsum[N - i]);\n        for (int j = 5, k = N - i; k >= 0; j += 2, k -= i) {\n            if (cost > ans) {\n                break;\n            }\n            int prev_k = k - i;\n            if (prev_k < 0) {\n                prev_k = 0;\n            }\n            cost += j * (xsum[k] - xsum[prev_k]);\n        }\n        if (cost < ans) {\n            ans = cost;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans + N * X);\n    \n    free(x);\n    free(xsum);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N]. Then, the code adds N*X again in the print. So the initial ans is X*N, plus 5xsum[N], and then adding N*X again in the print. So the total printed is X*N*2 +5xsum[N] + whatever is added in the loop. That seems possibly incorrect, but according to the original code, that's how it is.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N]. Then, in the loop, for each i, the code calculates a cost, which starts as X*i +5*(xsum[N] -xsum[N-i]). Then, in the inner loop, j is added. Then, ans is updated to the minimum of ans and cost. Then, after all i, the code adds N*X to ans. So the final answer is ans (after the loop) + N*X. So the initial ans includes X*N, but the loop's ans may have other values. For example, when i=1, cost is X*1 +5*(xsum[N] - xsum[N-1]). Then, after adding some terms in the inner loop, ans becomes the minimum of the previous ans and this cost. Then, after all loops, adding N*X again. So the original code's print statement is ans + N*X.\n\nBut the initial ans is X*N +5xsum[N], and when added N*X, becomes X*N*2 +5xsum[N]. But if during the loop, ans is replaced with a lower cost (like some cost from i=1, which may be lower than the initial ans), then adding N*X could make sense. But perhaps this is a mistake in the original code.\n\nBut regardless, the translation must follow the original code. So the code in C will replicate this.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Java, the variables are 64-bit integers. In C, using long long ensures that.\n\nTesting the code: for example, when N=1. Let's see. But perhaps the code works as intended.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Allocating memory for x and xsum. Need to check for allocation failures, but in programming contests, people often skip that.\n\n- The x array is read with x[i] being sc.nextLong() in Java. In C, scanf(\"%lld\", &x[i]) reads a long long.\n\n- The loop variables are correctly translated.\n\nSo the code should work as the Java code does."
