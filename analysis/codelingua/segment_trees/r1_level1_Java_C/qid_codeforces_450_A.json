Initially, all elements are added to the queues. So the front starts at 0, rear at n-1. Because when you enqueue elements, they are added from the rear. 4. Then, process the queue by checking the front element. If the value is <= m, dequeue both elements and record the index as the answer.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code reads two integers, n and m. Then it uses two queues, q1 and q2. q1 stores the initial values (probably the number of candies each child wants, or something similar), and q2 stores the indices of the children. The process is simulating giving out m candies each time. If a child needs more than m, they go to the back of the queue with the remaining amount. The last child to be processed (when their required candies drop to m or less) is the answer.\n\nIn C, there's no built-in queue data structure, so I'll have to implement it using arrays and manage the front and rear pointers manually. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFirst, the queues in Java are FIFO. So for the C code, I'll need two arrays for each queue's elements. Let's call them q1 and q2 for the values and indices respectively. Then, have variables to track the front and rear of each queue. Wait, but since both queues are manipulated in the same way (enqueued and dequeued together), maybe we can use a single structure. Alternatively, maybe process them as pairs. \n\nIn the Java code, when a child's required candies (q1 element) is more than m, the value is decreased by m and then added back to the queue. Similarly, their index is moved to the end. So in each iteration, the front elements of both queues are processed together.\n\nSo, in C, perhaps use a single queue that holds both the current value and the index. But how to implement a queue in C? Let's use an array and track the front and rear. Let's say we have an array of structs, each struct contains the value (like the candies needed) and the index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps manage two separate arrays, one for the values and one for the indices, since they are always enqueued and dequeued together. Let's consider that approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and m from input.\n2. Initialize two arrays (queues) for the values and indices.\n3. Populate these queues with initial values. Initially, all elements are added to the queues. So the front starts at 0, rear at n-1. Because when you enqueue elements, they are added from the rear.\n4. Then, process the queue by checking the front element. If the value is <= m, dequeue both elements and record the index as the answer. Otherwise, subtract m from the value, dequeue both, then enqueue the new value and index.\n\nWait, but queues in Java's implementation here are dynamic. In C, using a fixed-size array might be okay since each time we process an element, we either remove it or put it back. So the maximum size of the queue would be the same as the initial n. So allocating arrays of size n should be sufficient.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time we process a front element, if it's greater than m, we subtract m and add it back. So the total number of elements in the queue would decrease by 1 only when the element is <=m. Otherwise, it remains the same. So the maximum possible size of the queue after processing is still n. So we can use an array of size n for each queue.\n\nSo in C, the plan is:\n\n- Use two integer arrays for the values (q1) and indices (q2).\n- Have front and rear pointers. Wait, but queues can be implemented in a circular buffer style. Alternatively, for simplicity, perhaps use a dynamic approach where front starts at 0 and elements are dequeued by moving front forward. Then, when enqueuing, rear is moved forward and elements are added. But since the queue can't exceed n elements, the array size is enough.\n\nWait, but in Java's LinkedList-based queue, when elements are added to the end, and removed from the front. So in C, let's model this with a queue where elements are added to the end, and removed from the front. However, using a standard array might require shifting elements when dequeuing, which is inefficient. But in the Java code, the queues are accessed via poll() which removes the front element. So perhaps the C code can use a linked list approach, but that's more complex. Alternatively, use indices to track the current start and end.\n\nWait, here's an idea: use a queue implemented with an array and track the current start and size. For example, we can have a struct or variables for the queue's start index and current size. Each time we dequeue, we increment the start and decrement the size. Each time we enqueue, we add to the end (start + size) mod array_size. But since the array is large enough (n elements), we can manage it with a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, given that the maximum number of elements in the queue is n, perhaps just use an array and track the front and rear. But perhaps a more straightforward way is to have a start index (front) and a count (current number of elements in the queue). Then, when adding an element, we put it at (front + count) % n (assuming the array is size n). Wait, no. Let's think: if the array is size n, and the queue is a circular buffer, the start is front, and the count is the number of elements. Then the next position to add is (front + count) % n. So each enqueue increases the count. Each dequeue increases front by 1 (mod n) and decreases count by 1.\n\nBut in our case, the queues start with all n elements. Then, when processing, each time we might add one element (if the value is more than m) after removing one. So the count remains the same in that case. Otherwise, it decreases by one.\n\nSo for the C code:\n\nWe can have two arrays: one for the values (q1), and one for the indices (q2). The queue's front is tracked by a variable (say, front), and the size (current elements in the queue) is tracked by a variable (size). Wait, perhaps using a struct for the queue. But in C, perhaps easier to have separate variables.\n\nAlternatively, since the two queues are always modified in the same way (since each operation on q1 and q2 in the Java code is paired), perhaps model them as a single queue where each element has a value and an index. So, create a struct:\n\nstruct element {\n    int value;\n    int index;\n};\n\nThen, have a queue of struct elements.\n\nThis might simplify the code. Let's see:\n\nIn C, the queue can be represented as an array of struct elements, with front and size variables.\n\nInitialize the queue with all elements (n elements), with front = 0, size = n.\n\nThen, while size > 0:\n\n- Check the front element's value.\n\n- If value <= m: record the index as ans, remove the front element (front++, size--).\n\n- Else: subtract m from the value, then move the front element to the end of the queue. Which would involve: take the front element, add it to the end, then front++, and size remains the same (since we remove from front and add to end). Wait, no. Because after removing the front, the size would decrease by 1, but then adding it back would increase the size by 1. So the net effect is that size remains the same. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, in the case where the value is > m:\n\n- Take the front element.\n\n- Subtract m from its value.\n\n- Dequeue it (front++, size--).\n\n- Enqueue it again (add to the end of the queue, which is (front + size) % array_size, but since we just decremented size, adding it back would increment size again. So size remains the same as before.\n\nBut how to manage the queue in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nOriginal front is at position 'front' in the array. The queue is from front to front + size - 1 (mod n).\n\nWhen you dequeue, you take the front element, then front = (front + 1) % n, size--.\n\nIf the element's value is greater than m, subtract m, then enqueue it (add to the end of the queue). Enqueuing would mean adding to (front + size) % n (since after dequeuing, front has moved and size is now size-1). Wait, perhaps the enqueue function would place the new element at (front + size) % n, and then increment size by 1.\n\nBut in this case, when we enqueue after dequeuing, the steps are:\n\nOriginal front is at index F, size S.\n\nDequeue: take element at F. Front becomes F+1 (mod n), size S-1.\n\nEnqueue the modified element: the new element is placed at (F+1) + (S-1) mod n = F + S mod n. Which is the next available position. Then size becomes S.\n\nSo the overall size remains S.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, using a struct to hold the value and index, and a queue implemented with an array of structs, along with front and size variables.\n\nIn C code:\n\nWe can have variables:\n\nstruct element {\n    int value;\n    int index;\n};\n\nstruct element queue[1000]; // Assuming n is up to 1000, but maybe better to use dynamic allocation. But for simplicity, let's assume a maximum n.\n\nint front = 0;\nint q_size = 0;\n\nBut since n can be up to... Well, in the problem, the original code uses a scanner and reads n from input, which can be up to any value. But since in programming competition problems, the constraints are usually given. But since the original Java code uses queues, perhaps the code expects n to be up to a reasonable size.\n\nAlternatively, in C, we can read n, then dynamically allocate the queue array with size n.\n\nBut perhaps for the code, let's read n and m, then create a queue with n elements.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, initialize the queue. For each child from 1 to n:\n\n- Read the value (candies) and add to the queue with their index (1-based).\n\nSo, the initial queue has n elements, front is 0, size is n.\n\nThen, process the queue:\n\nInitialize ans = 0.\n\nWhile the queue is not empty (size > 0):\n\n- Check the front element's value.\n\n- If <= m: set ans to this element's index, then dequeue (front++, size--).\n\n- Else: subtract m from the value, dequeue the element (front++, size--), then enqueue the modified element (add to end, size++).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the element is greater than m, after subtracting m, the element is added to the end of the queue. So in C terms:\n\nTake the front element. If its value is x > m:\n\nx = x - m\n\nThen, remove it from the queue (front++, size--), then add x back to the queue (size++).\n\nBut in the Java code, the order is:\n\nq1.poll(); // front removed\n\nq1.add(val); // added to the end.\n\nSimilarly for the index queue.\n\nSo in the C code, when the value is greater than m:\n\nWe take the front element, subtract m, then add it to the end of the queue.\n\nSo for the struct element:\n\ncurrent = queue[front]\n\ncurrent.value -= m;\n\nThen, dequeue (front = (front + 1) % n, size--)\n\nThen, enqueue (queue[(front + size) % n] = current; and size++.\n\nWait, but the enqueue would be at the position (front + size) % array_size. But after dequeuing, size is now size-1, so adding to (front + (size-1)) % array_size.\n\nWait, perhaps the code for enqueuing is:\n\nint new_pos = (front + size) % array_size;\nqueue[new_pos] = current;\nsize++;\n\nBut after dequeuing, the front is front+1, size is size-1.\n\nSo after dequeuing, to add the element back, the new position is (front + (size-1)) % array_size?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, when using a circular queue, the enqueue is added to (front + size) % capacity. But the capacity is the array size, which is n. So when the queue is initialized, the array is of size n. So when the queue has elements, the positions are from front to front + size - 1 modulo n.\n\nSo when we dequeue (front increments by 1 mod n, size decreases by 1), then enqueue would add the element to (front + (size-1 + 1)) mod n = (front + size) mod n.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the queue as a circular buffer where:\n\n- The queue starts with front =0, size =n.\n\n- Each element is at position (front + i) mod n, for i in 0 to size-1.\n\nSo when dequeuing, front becomes (front +1) mod n, size decreases by 1.\n\nWhen enqueuing, the new element is placed at (front + size) mod n, and size increases by 1.\n\nBut in the case where we dequeue and then enqueue (like when the value is >m), the steps are:\n\n1. current = queue[front] (front is 0, size is n).\n\n2. if current.value >m:\n\n3. current.value -=m.\n\n4. dequeue: front becomes 1, size becomes n-1.\n\n5. enqueue: add current to (1 + (n-1)) mod n = (n) mod n =0. So the element is added to position 0. Then size becomes n.\n\nSo after this operation, the queue has the same size as before (since we removed one and added one), and the elements are shifted.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nstruct element *queue = malloc(n * sizeof(struct element));\nfront =0;\nsize =0;\n\nThen, read each of the n elements, adding to the queue. For example:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    int val;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &val);\n    queue[i].value = val;\n    queue[i].index = i+1; // since the Java code uses 1-based indices.\n}\nfront =0;\nsize =n;\n\nThen, process:\n\nint ans =0;\n\nwhile (size >0) {\n    struct element current = queue[front];\n    if (current.value <=m) {\n        ans = current.index;\n        front = (front +1) %n;\n        size--;\n    } else {\n        current.value -=m;\n        // dequeue\n        front = (front +1) %n;\n        size--;\n        // enqueue\n        int enqueue_pos = (front + size) %n;\n        queue[enqueue_pos] = current;\n        size++;\n    }\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nWait, but when we dequeue (front increments, size decreases), then the enqueue position is (front + size) %n. Because after the dequeuing, size is now size-1. Then, adding the element back would make the new size (size-1)+1 = size again.\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nInitially, size is S.\n\nWhen the element is dequeued, front becomes (front +1) mod n, size becomes S-1.\n\nThen, enqueue_pos is (front (now front+1) + (S-1)) mod n = (front +1 + S-1) mod n = (front + S) mod n. Which is the same as the original (front + S) mod n. Because before dequeuing, the next enqueue position is (front + S) modn. But after dequeuing, front is front+1, size is S-1, so enqueue position is (front+1 + S-1) modn = front + S modn. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the code correctly adds the element to the end of the queue.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with a small example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3 1 4 2\n\nThe Java code's queues:\n\nq1: [1,3,1,4,2]\n\nq2: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst element is 1 (<=2). Dequeue, ans=1. Now queues are [3,1,4,2] and [2,3,4,5].\n\nNext element is 3>2. Subtract 2, becomes 1. Dequeue and add to end. So queues are [1,4,2,1] and [3,4,5,2].\n\nNext element is 1 <=2: ans=3. Dequeue. queues [4,2,1] and [4,5,2].\n\nNext element is4>2. subtract 2: 2. Dequeue and add to end. queues [2,1,2] and [5,2,4].\n\nNext element is 2 <=2: ans=5. Dequeue. queues [1,2] and [2,4].\n\nNext element is1<=2: ans=2. Dequeue. queues [2].\n\nNext element is2<=2: ans=4. Dequeue. queues empty.\n\nThe final answer is 4.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let's walk through the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let's take sample input from codeforces to see.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut in any case, translating the Java code into C with the queue implemented as a circular buffer using arrays and structs should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in C, dynamic allocation can be done with malloc. But for code submission, sometimes variable-length arrays (VLA) are allowed if using C99. But if n can be up to 1e5, then stack allocation may not be possible. But the original Java code uses queues, which are dynamically allocated. So the C code should handle dynamic allocation.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nstruct element *queue = (struct element*)malloc(n * sizeof(struct element));\n\nThen, read the n values and assign their indices (1-based).\n\nThen proceed with the loop.\n\nAnother thing to note: the queue's maximum possible size is n. So the array is allocated to size n, which is sufficient.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nstruct element {\n    int value;\n    int index;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    struct element *queue = (struct element*)malloc(n * sizeof(struct element));\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &queue[i].value);\n        queue[i].index = i + 1;\n    }\n    int front = 0;\n    int size = n;\n    int ans = 0;\n    while (size > 0) {\n        struct element current = queue[front];\n        if (current.value <= m) {\n            ans = current.index;\n            front = (front + 1) % n;\n            size--;\n        } else {\n            current.value -= m;\n            front = (front + 1) % n;\n            size--;\n            int enqueue_pos = (front + size) % n;\n            queue[enqueue_pos] = current;\n            size++;\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    free(queue);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but when we enqueue, the code uses (front + size) %n. But after dequeuing, front is front+1, and size is size-1. So (front + size) is (front+1) + (size-1) = front + size. Which is the same as before. So enqueue_pos is (front + size) mod n.\n\nBut in code, after dequeuing (front becomes (front+1) modn, size becomes size-1), then enqueue_pos is (front + size) %n.\n\nYes. Because after dequeuing:\n\nnew_front = front + 1 modn\n\nnew_size = size -1\n\nenqueue_pos = (new_front + new_size) modn\n\n= (front+1 + size-1) modn\n\n= (front + size) modn\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting with the example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\n1 3 1 4 2\n\nAfter initial setup, the queue has:\n\nelements 0: {1,1}, 1: {3,2}, 2:{1,3}, 3:{4,4}, 4:{2,5}\n\nfront=0, size=5.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ncurrent is {1,1} (value 1 <=2). ans=1. front becomes 1, size=4.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ncurrent is {3,2} (value 3>2). subtract 2 \u21921. front becomes 2, size=3. enqueue_pos is (2 +3) mod5=5 mod5=0. queue[0] becomes {1,2}. size=4.\n\nNow queue elements:\n\npositions 2: {1,3}, 3: {4,4},4:{2,5},0:{1,2}\n\nThird iteration:\n\ncurrent is {1,3} (value 1 \u22642). ans=3. front becomes3, size=3.\n\nFourth iteration:\n\ncurrent is {4,4} (value4>2). subtract 2 \u21922. front becomes4, size=2. enqueue_pos= (4 +2) mod5=6 mod5=1. queue[1] = {2,4}. size=3.\n\nNow queue elements:\n\n4: {2,5},0:{1,2},1:{2,4}\n\nFifth iteration:\n\ncurrent is {2,5} (value2 \u22642). ans=5. front becomes0 mod5, size=2.\n\nSixth iteration:\n\ncurrent is {1,2} (value1 \u22642). ans=2. front becomes1, size=1.\n\nSeventh iteration:\n\ncurrent is {2,4} (value2 \u22642). ans=4. front becomes2, size=0.\n\nLoop exits. Output is 4.\n\nWhich matches the expected result.\n\nThus, the code should work."
