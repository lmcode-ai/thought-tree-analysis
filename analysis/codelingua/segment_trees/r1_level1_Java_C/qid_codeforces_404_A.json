    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into C. Let me look at the original code first to understand what it does.\n\nSo the Java program reads an integer n, then reads n strings. Each string is stored in a 2D char array. The code checks if the diagonals (both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal) have the same character 'a', and all other positions have the same character 'b'. Also, a and b must be different. If these conditions are met, it outputs YES, else NO.\n\nHmm. Now, translating this to C. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in C, I can't use Scanner, so I'll need to use scanf for input. The variables n is an integer. Then, the array in Java is a 2D char array, but in C, I can have a 2D array of chars as well. However, since strings in C are null-terminated, each row should be a char array with enough space. So maybe declare a 2D array like char arr[300][300], assuming that n is up to 300? Well, the original code uses next() which reads the next token, so perhaps each string is a line of n characters.\n\nWait, the original code for each i, reads str[i] as sc.next(), which in Java reads the next token (split by whitespace). So the input is probably given as n lines, each line being a string of length n. So in C, I can read each line as a string using fgets or scanf. But with scanf, if I use %s, it will read until whitespace, which could be a problem if the input has spaces. But assuming that the input is formatted correctly, each line is a single string of n characters, then using scanf with %s for each row should work.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nRead n using scanf. Then, for each of the n rows, read a string into arr[i]. But in C, arr would be a 2D array where each row is a char array of size n+1 (for the null terminator). Wait, but in the original code, each row is exactly n characters. So in C, the code can declare a 2D array of size, say, 300x301 (assuming n is up to 300, each row can hold 300 characters plus a null terminator). Then, read each row using scanf(\"%s\", arr[i]);.\n\nWait, but if the user inputs a string longer than n, it would overflow. But the problem likely expects that the input is correct, so we can proceed under that assumption.\n\nNext, the variables a and b are the first two characters of the first row. Then, check if a == b. If they are the same, output NO. Otherwise, check the entire grid.\n\nIn the checking part: for each cell (i,j), if it's on the main diagonal (i == j) or the anti-diagonal (i + j == n-1), then it should be equal to a. All other cells should be equal to b. If any of these conditions are not met, the result is false.\n\nSo in C, the code would need to loop through each i and j, and perform these checks. The main steps are similar.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- In C, the indices are zero-based, just like Java, so no problem there.\n- When reading the input, each string should be exactly length n, but in the code, perhaps we need to ensure that. But the original Java code doesn't check that either. So we proceed under the assumption that input is correct.\n- The main structure of the code would be similar: read n, read n strings, check the conditions.\n\nNow, let's outline the C code:\n\n1. Declare variables: n, i, j, a, b, res (as a boolean, but in C we can use an int, 1 for true, 0 for false).\n2. Read n using scanf.\n3. Declare a 2D array for the grid. Since C can't have variable-length arrays in all compilers (unless using C99), perhaps declare a fixed size, like 300x301. So char arr[300][301];\n4. Read each row using scanf. For i from 0 to n-1: scanf(\"%s\", arr[i]);\n5. Check the first two characters of the first row. a = arr[0][0], b = arr[0][1]. If a == b, print \"NO\".\n6. Else, loop through each cell, check the conditions.\n   - Initialize res to 1 (true).\n   - For each i, j in 0..n-1:\n     - if (i == j) || (i + j == n-1): check if arr[i][j] == a. If not, set res to 0.\n     - else: check if arr[i][j] == b. If not, set res to 0.\n     - Break loops early if res becomes 0.\n7. After checking all, print \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on res.\n\nNow, in C, handling the loops and breaking early. The Java code uses a nested loop and breaks when res is false. So in C, we can have flags and break out of the loops.\n\nWait, in the original code:\n\nfor (i=0; i <n; i++) {\n    for (j=0; j <n; j++) {\n        check...\n        if condition not met, res=false; break;\n    }\n    if (!res) break;\n}\n\nBut in C, to break out of the nested loops, we can use a flag.\n\nAlternatively, structure the loops with a check on res.\n\nSo in C:\n\nint res = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n && res; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n && res; j++) {\n        if (i == j || i + j == n -1) {\n            if (arr[i][j] != a) {\n                res = 0;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (arr[i][j] != b) {\n                res = 0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this would check all cells even if res is already 0. Wait, the original code breaks when res is false. So in Java, once res is set to false, it breaks out of the inner loop and then the outer loop.\n\nIn C, to replicate that, perhaps:\n\nint res = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n        if ( (i == j || i + j == n -1) ) {\n            if (arr[i][j] != a) {\n                res = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (arr[i][j] != b) {\n                res = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (!res) {\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nYes, that would work. Because once res is 0, the inner loop breaks, then the outer loop checks if res is false and breaks.\n\nSo putting that into code.\n\nOther edge cases: n=1. For example, if n is 1, then the anti-diagonal is also the same cell. But in that case, all elements are on the diagonal. So the code should check that all cells (the single cell) is a, and the other positions (none) are b. So if n is 1, then after checking a != b (since the first two characters don't exist?), wait in the code, when n is 1, the code checks arr[0][0] and arr[0][1], which is out of bounds. Wait, the original Java code has:\n\nchar a = arr[0][0];\nchar b = arr[0][1];\n\nBut when n is 1, the first row has only one character. So accessing arr[0][1] would throw an exception. Wait, in the original code, when n is 1, the code would crash when trying to read the first row's second character. So the problem's test cases probably have n >= 2? Or is there an error in the original code?\n\nWait, the original code reads a grid of n x n, and for the first row, accesses the 0th and 1st characters. So if n is 1, the code will crash. But the problem's constraints probably ensure that n is at least 2? Or perhaps the code has a bug.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, perhaps n can be 1. So when translating to C, we need to handle that.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the input is a square of size n x n. So if n is 1, then the code checks the first two characters of the first row (which has only one character). That would cause an error. Therefore, the original code is incorrect for n=1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases don't have n=1, but as a programmer, we need to handle it. However, the code as written in Java would crash for n=1. Therefore, the C code would also have the same issue. So the translation must replicate that.\n\nBut in the original code, when n is 1, the code would throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to get str[0].charAt(1). So when translating to C, for n=1, the code would access arr[0][1], which is beyond the string's length. In C, that would read some garbage value (or the null terminator if the string is properly null-terminated). But since the code uses scanf(\"%s\", arr[i]), arr[i] is a string. For example, if the input is \"X\" for n=1, then arr[0][0] is 'X', and arr[0][1] is '\\0'. So in this case, a is 'X', and b is '\\0', which is not equal to a. Then, the code proceeds to check all cells.\n\nBut in the case of n=1, the code would check if the cell (0,0) is a. Since that is the case, and there are no other cells (since j runs up to n-1=0). So the code would output YES. But in reality, the original code would crash for n=1. So the problem must have n >= 2.\n\nSo in the translation, perhaps the code will have the same behavior as the Java code. So for n=1, it's undefined (since in C, accessing arr[0][1] is allowed but may have unexpected results). But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps n is at least 2. So the code can proceed as is.\n\nTherefore, proceed with the translation.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe C code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n strings into a 2D array.\n\nCheck if a == b. If yes, output NO.\n\nElse, check all cells.\n\nNow, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    char arr[300][301]; // Assuming maximum n is 300.\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", arr[i]);\n    }\n    char a = arr[0][0];\n    char b = arr[0][1];\n    if (a == b) {\n        printf(\"NO\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n    int res = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            if (i == j || i + j == n -1) {\n                if (arr[i][j] != a) {\n                    res = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else {\n                if (arr[i][j] != b) {\n                    res = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (!res) break;\n    }\n    printf(res ? \"YES\\n\" : \"NO\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial check for a and b is done even if n is 1, which may cause reading arr[0][1] which is beyond the string. So for n=1, the code's behavior is undefined, but that's the same as the original Java code. So the translation is accurate.\n\nAnother thing: in C, when you read a string with scanf(\"%s\", arr[i]), it will stop at whitespace. So if the input lines have spaces, that would be a problem. But according to the problem's input format, each line is a string of n characters, so no spaces. So this is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work as intended."
