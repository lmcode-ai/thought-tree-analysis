So the string is \"11\". Then counts two 1s. Which is correct. So using the approach of counting during the loop would give the same result.

Instead of building a string, maybe we can avoid that and count the 1s directly as we compute them. That would be more efficient and simpler in C.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code's approach: it converts the number to binary by taking mod 2 and dividing by 2, appending each digit to a string. Then it counts the 1s in the string.\n\nBut instead of building the string, in C, we can just count the 1s as we compute each bit. That would save memory and time. So maybe the original Java code's approach isn't the most efficient, but the C translation could optimize this step.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to exactly replicate the steps (for correctness), we can build a string in C, but since C strings are arrays of characters and require manual management, that's a bit more involved.\n\nBut let's think: the Java code's loop is while (n > 0). So for each iteration, n is divided by 2. The remainder x is added to the string s as a string. But in Java, s starts as empty. So the first remainder is the least significant bit, and the string ends up being the reverse of the binary digits. Wait, for example, if n is 5 (101 in binary), the loop would process:\n\nn=5: x=5%2=1, n becomes 2. s is \"1\".\nn=2: x=0, s becomes \"10\".\nn=1: x=1, s becomes \"101\".\nn=0, loop ends.\n\nBut then the string s is \"101\", which is the binary digits in reverse order (LSB first). Then when they loop through s, they check each character. But since the order doesn't matter for counting the 1s, it's okay. The number of 1s is correct regardless of the order.\n\nSo in C, even if we build the string in reverse (as the code does), the count of '1's will still be correct. But building a string in C is a bit more involved. Let's see. The Java code appends each x (0 or 1) to the string s as a string. So for x=0, it adds \"0\", etc.\n\nIn C, we can have a character array. But since the maximum possible number of bits for an int is, say, 32 or 64, we can pre-allocate a buffer. For example, an array of size 33 (for 32 bits plus null terminator).\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just count the 1s as we compute the bits, without building the string. That would be more efficient. Let's see the original code's logic again.\n\nThe Java code first converts n to binary by taking mod 2 and div 2, appending each bit to a string. Then it counts the 1s in the string.\n\nBut the same could be done by incrementing a counter each time the mod 2 is 1. For example:\n\nint ans = 0;\nwhile (n > 0) {\n    if (n % 2 == 1) {\n        ans++;\n    }\n    n = n / 2;\n}\n\nThat would give the same result. Because each time you take mod 2, if it's 1, you count it, then divide by 2. So this way, you don't need to build the string at all. The original Java code uses the string approach, but perhaps the C code can optimize it by directly counting the 1s.\n\nThat would simplify the code. So the C translation can avoid the string handling part. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nYes, because in the original code, the string s is only used to count the 1s. So combining the two steps into one would be better.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize ans to 0.\n\nLoop while n > 0:\n\n   if n % 2 is 1, increment ans.\n\n   divide n by 2.\n\nAfter loop, print ans.\n\nThat's much simpler and more efficient. So the Java code can be translated into C by using this approach, which is better.\n\nBut wait, the original code may have a bug or not? Let's check.\n\nThe original Java code converts n to a binary string by appending each remainder. For example, n=3: 3%2=1, n=1, then 1%2=1, n=0. So the string is \"11\". Then counts two 1s. Which is correct.\n\nSo using the approach of counting during the loop would give the same result.\n\nTherefore, the C code can be written as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int ans = 0;\n    while (n > 0) {\n        if (n % 2 == 1) {\n            ans++;\n        }\n        n = n / 2;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work. Let me test with a sample input.\n\nFor example, if n is 5, binary 101. The loop:\n\nn=5: 5%2=1 \u2192 ans=1. n=2.\n\nn=2: 0 \u2192 ans remains. n=1.\n\nn=1: 1 \u2192 ans=2. n=0. So total 2. Wait, but 5 in binary is 101, which has two 1s. Wait, no, 101 has two 1s? Wait 1+0+1 is two 1s. Wait no: 5 is 101, which has two 1's. Yes, the code would output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 7 (111 in binary). The code would count 3. Correct.\n\nInput 1: code counts 1.\n\nInput 0: the loop doesn't run, so ans is 0. But according to Java code, if n is 0, the loop doesn't run, so the string is empty. Then the for loop over s (length 0) gives ans 0, which is correct. So for input 0, the C code returns 0, same as Java.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, if the input is 0, the code outputs 0. But when n is 0, the loop doesn't execute, so the string is empty. So the count is 0. So the C code would also output 0 for input 0. That's correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct C translation is as written above. The original Java code's approach of building the string and then counting can be simplified, and the C code can directly count the 1s during the division loop."
