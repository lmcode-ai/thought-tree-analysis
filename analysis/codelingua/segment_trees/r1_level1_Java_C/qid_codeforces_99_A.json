So when you create a BigInteger from \"009\", it's 9, and adding 1 gives 10. So the output is \"10\". But in the C code, when handling the integer part as a string, if it has leading zeros, incrementing would preserve them, but according to the original code's logic, leading zeros should be removed. So for example, \"009.5\" would become \"10\" in Java code, but in the C code, if we process \"009\" as the integer part, increment to \"010\", which when printed is \"010\". Wait, that's a problem. So the original Java code treats the integer part as a number, so leading zeros are not part of the output.

But in code, we need to handle it. So, the code after incrementing should process the string to remove leading zeros. So, a function to remove leading zeros:\n\nvoid remove_leading_zeros(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int non_zero_index = 0;\n    while (non_zero_index < len && num[non_zero_index] == '0') {\n        non_zero_index++;\n    }\n    if (non_zero_index == len) {\n        // all zeros, leave as \"0\"\n        num[0] = '0';\n        num[1] = '\\0';\n    } else {\n        // shift the string to the left\n        memmove(num, num + non_zero_index, len - non_zero_index + 1); // +1 for null terminator\n    }\n} So this function will turn \"010\" into \"10\", \"0010\" into \"10\", etc. So in the C code, after incrementing the integer_part, we call remove_leading_zeros on it. But wait, in the Java code, when creating the BigInteger, leading zeros are ignored. So when the integer_part is \"009\", the BigInteger is 9, adding 1 gives 10, which is \"10\". So the leading zeros are stripped. Thus, in C, after incrementing the integer_part, we need to process it to remove leading zeros. So, the steps when rounding up:\n\n1.",

But in the Java code, the code loops through each character and appends to _str, then uses BigInteger. So the code is a bit different, but in the case of no rounding, the code just prints the original characters, including leading zeros. So in C, for the no-rounding case, we can just print the substring from 0 to dot_pos. Thus, the code steps:\n\nRead input into a buffer. Find the dot position. Check if the character before the dot is '9'. If yes, print message. Else, check next character after dot. If next character >= '5':\n\n- extract integer_part.\n\n- increment it. - remove leading zeros.\n\n- print the result. Else:\n\n- print the substring from 0 to dot_pos. But in C, strings are null-terminated, so when we have the input as \"123.456\", the str is an array of {'1','2','3','.', ...}, and dot_pos is 3. So the integer_part is the first 3 characters (indices 0,1,2). So, in code:\n\nchar str[1000];\nfgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);\n// Remove possible newline\nstr[strcspn(str, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';\n\nint dot_pos = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; str[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n    if (str[i] == '.') {\n        dot_pos = i;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nif (dot_pos == -1) {\n    // No dot found?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe Java code reads a string from input, which represents a number. It looks for the decimal point. Then, depending on the digits around the decimal point, it decides whether to round up, print \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", or just output the integer part.\n\nLet me go through the Java code step by step. \n\nFirst, they convert the input line into a character array. Then they find the index of the dot. If the character before the dot is '9', they print \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" because rounding would carry over and make it 10, which isn't a single digit. Otherwise, if the first digit after the dot is 5 or more, they round up the integer part. If it's less than 5, they just print the integer part as is.\n\nIn C, I'll need to handle strings as char arrays. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string. In C, I can use fgets or scanf to read a line. But need to be careful with buffer sizes. Let's assume the input isn't too long. So maybe declare a buffer like char str[1000], then use fgets.\n\n2. Find the position of the dot. Loop through the characters until '.' is found. Store that index.\n\n3. Check the character before the dot. If it's '9', output the message.\n\n4. Else, check the first character after the dot. If it's >=5, increment the integer part. Otherwise, print the integer part as is.\n\nWait, but in Java, when they check the next character, they take the first digit after the dot. So in Java code, str[dotIndex +1], which is the first digit after the decimal. So in C, same logic. So if that digit is >4, then round up.\n\nBut in C, handling the integer part's increment is a bit trickier, especially if the integer part is a big number (like leading zeros, etc.). The Java code uses BigInteger to handle the addition, which suggests that the integer part could be very large, but in practice, the problem's test cases might not require handling extremely large numbers. Wait, but the problem could have a very long integer part. So how to handle that in C?\n\nIn C, we can't use arbitrary-precision integers by default. So we need to process the integer part as a string and increment it as a string. That's a bit more complex.\n\nSo the steps when we need to round up:\n\n- Extract the integer part as a string (up to dotIndex characters), then increment that number as a string.\n\nSo, for example, if the integer part is \"123\", increment to \"124\". If it's \"999\", becomes \"1000\".\n\nIn Java, they use BigInteger to add 1, which handles all the cases. But in C, we need to implement this increment manually.\n\nSo the main challenge is to implement the increment function for the integer part string.\n\nLet's plan the steps again:\n\nIn C:\n\nRead the input string into a buffer.\n\nFind the dot's position. Let's call it dot_pos.\n\nCheck if the character before the dot is '9'. If yes, output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nElse, check if the first digit after the dot is >=5. If yes, increment the integer part and output the result. Otherwise, output the integer part.\n\nSo, the key part is implementing the increment function for the integer part string.\n\nSo first, let's process the integer part.\n\nFor example, if the integer part is \"123\", after increment, it's \"124\".\n\nIf it's \"999\", after increment, it's \"1000\".\n\nSo, the steps for incrementing a number represented as a string:\n\nStart from the end of the string, move left, add 1, handle carry.\n\nBut since the string is stored as a C string (array of chars), we need to process each character.\n\nBut first, the integer part is from the start of the string up to dot_pos -1? Wait, in the Java code, the loop is from 0 to dotIndex (exclusive) to build the _str, which is the integer part. For example, if the input is \"123.456\", the integer part is \"123\".\n\nSo in C, the integer part is the substring from 0 to dot_pos, but since the dot is at position dot_pos, the integer part is from 0 to dot_pos-1, length dot_pos.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can create a buffer to hold the integer part. For example, copy the first dot_pos characters into a separate buffer. Then increment that buffer as a number.\n\nBut in C, since strings are null-terminated, we can create a new buffer of size dot_pos + 2 (to handle possible carry over, leading to an increase in length by 1), but maybe better to process in place.\n\nWait, let's think. The integer part could be up to, say, 1000 characters. So we need a buffer large enough to hold it plus possible leading digits.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nchar integer_part[1000] = {0};\n\nstrncpy(integer_part, str, dot_pos);\n\ninteger_part[dot_pos] = '\\0';\n\nThen process this string.\n\nSo the increment function:\n\nFunction to increment a number represented as a string.\n\nStart from the end of the string (the least significant digit). Add 1. If there is a carry, move left. If all digits are 9, then after increment, it becomes 1 followed by all 0s, and the length increases by 1.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"999\" becomes \"1000\"\n\n\"12345\" becomes \"12346\"\n\n\"8999\" becomes \"9000\"\n\nSo how to implement this in C:\n\nvoid increment(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int carry = 1;\n    for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0 && carry; --i) {\n        int digit = num[i] - '0';\n        digit += carry;\n        carry = digit / 10;\n        num[i] = (digit % 10) + '0';\n    }\n    if (carry) {\n        // need to add a '1' at the beginning\n        memmove(num + 1, num, len + 1); // shift right by 1, including null terminator\n        num[0] = '1';\n    }\n}\n\nThis function assumes that num is a valid number string with no leading zeros. But in the problem statement, the input could have leading zeros? For example, \"009.87\". Then after increment, it would become \"010\" if the third 9 is in the position before the dot. But the problem's input may not have leading zeros. Let's see the problem's sample input.\n\nLooking at the original code: the code in Java uses new BigInteger(_str).add(new BigInteger(\"1\")), which handles leading zeros correctly. For example, if _str is \"009\", then adding 1 gives \"10\". Because BigInteger parses the string as a decimal number, ignoring leading zeros. Wait, no. Wait, BigInteger's string constructor treats leading zeros as part of the number. For example, new BigInteger(\"009\") is equivalent to new BigInteger(\"9\"), but no. Wait, no, actually, leading zeros in the string are allowed but treated as part of the number. Wait, no, actually, no. From Java's BigInteger documentation: \"The String representation consists of an optional minus or plus sign followed by a sequence of one or more digits in the specified radix. The character-to-digit mapping is provided by Character.digit. The String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace, for example).\" So leading zeros are allowed, but the value is parsed as the numeric value. So \"009\" is 9, same as \"9\".\n\nWait, but the code in Java constructs _str by looping through the characters up to the dot. So for example, if the input is \"009.9\", then _str is \"009\", which when passed to BigInteger becomes 9. Then adding 1 gives 10, which when converted to string is \"10\". So the leading zeros are stripped.\n\nBut in C, if we process the string as is, leading zeros would be preserved. For example, if the integer part is \"009\", then when we increment, it would become \"010\", but according to the problem's logic, the correct output would be \"10\". But the original Java code would output \"10\".\n\nWait, this suggests that leading zeros in the integer part should be stripped, except for the case when the number is zero. So in the Java code, when constructing _str, which is the integer part as a string, when creating a BigInteger, leading zeros are ignored (as per BigInteger's parsing). So when you create a BigInteger from \"009\", it's 9, and adding 1 gives 10. So the output is \"10\".\n\nBut in the C code, when handling the integer part as a string, if it has leading zeros, incrementing would preserve them, but according to the original code's logic, leading zeros should be removed. So for example, \"009.5\" would become \"10\" in Java code, but in the C code, if we process \"009\" as the integer part, increment to \"010\", which when printed is \"010\".\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the original Java code treats the integer part as a number, so leading zeros are not part of the output. So in the C code, when incrementing, leading zeros would be preserved unless we handle them.\n\nWait, but the original code in Java does not process leading zeros. Let's see: the code in Java loops through the characters up to dotIndex and appends them to _str, which is the integer part. For example, if the input is \"009.9\", then _str is \"009\". Then, when creating a new BigInteger(_str), the BigInteger's value is 9, then add 1 gives 10. So the output is \"10\".\n\nSo in the C code, after incrementing \"009\" to \"010\", the output would be \"010\", but according to the original code, it should be \"10\". So this is a problem.\n\nSo in C, after incrementing, we need to remove leading zeros. Unless the number is zero (but according to the problem, the integer part can't be zero? Or can it? For example, input like \"0.9\" would be possible. So in that case, after incrementing, it becomes \"1\".\n\nSo, how to handle leading zeros after incrementing.\n\nThus, in the C code, after incrementing the integer part, we need to remove any leading zeros except when the number is zero.\n\nSo, the steps for the C code:\n\nWhen we need to increment the integer part:\n\n1. Copy the integer part into a buffer (as a string).\n\n2. Increment the string.\n\n3. Remove leading zeros.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the increment function as before.\n\nThen, after incrementing, process the string to remove leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nOriginal integer_part: \"009\" \u2192 after increment \u2192 \"010\" \u2192 then remove leading zeros \u2192 \"10\".\n\nAnother example: \"0999\" \u2192 becomes \"1000\" \u2192 no leading zeros to remove.\n\nAnother example: \"0000\" \u2192 becomes \"1000\" \u2192 after removing leading zeros, \"1000\" (but this case is impossible, since original code would have checked for '9' in the digit before the dot. But in code, we need to handle it.\n\nSo, the code after incrementing should process the string to remove leading zeros.\n\nSo, a function to remove leading zeros:\n\nvoid remove_leading_zeros(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int non_zero_index = 0;\n    while (non_zero_index < len && num[non_zero_index] == '0') {\n        non_zero_index++;\n    }\n    if (non_zero_index == len) {\n        // all zeros, leave as \"0\"\n        num[0] = '0';\n        num[1] = '\\0';\n    } else {\n        // shift the string to the left\n        memmove(num, num + non_zero_index, len - non_zero_index + 1); // +1 for null terminator\n    }\n}\n\nSo this function will turn \"010\" into \"10\", \"0010\" into \"10\", etc.\n\nSo in the C code, after incrementing the integer_part, we call remove_leading_zeros on it.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, when creating the BigInteger, leading zeros are ignored. So when the integer_part is \"009\", the BigInteger is 9, adding 1 gives 10, which is \"10\". So the leading zeros are stripped.\n\nThus, in C, after incrementing the integer_part, we need to process it to remove leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps when rounding up:\n\n1. Extract the integer_part as a string.\n\n2. Increment it.\n\n3. Remove leading zeros.\n\n4. Output the result.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code structure in C:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFind the dot position.\n\nCheck if the character before the dot is '9'. If yes, output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nElse, check if the first character after the dot is >=5.\n\nIf yes:\n\n- Extract the integer_part (0 to dot_pos-1).\n\n- Increment the integer_part.\n\n- Remove leading zeros.\n\n- Print the result.\n\nElse:\n\n- Print the integer_part (0 to dot_pos-1), but note that in Java, leading zeros are preserved here. Wait, wait in the Java code, when the code does not round up, it just loops through the integer part and prints each character. So if the integer part is \"009\", it prints \"009\". But according to the Java code's example, for input \"123.456\", it would print \"123\". For \"009.3\", it would print \"009\".\n\nBut that's different from how the code handles the rounded case, where leading zeros are stripped.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So in the Java code, when rounding is not needed, the code just prints the integer part as is, including leading zeros. But when rounding is needed, leading zeros are stripped because the code uses BigInteger, which parses the string as a number, thus removing leading zeros.\n\nSo in the original Java code:\n\nCase 1: no rounding. For input like \"009.4\", the code outputs \"009\".\n\nCase 2: rounding. For input like \"009.5\", the code parses the integer part as 9, adds 1 to get 10, and outputs \"10\".\n\nSo in C, for the no-rounding case, the code must output the integer part as is (including leading zeros), and for the rounding case, output the incremented integer part with leading zeros removed.\n\nThus, in C:\n\nWhen rounding is needed (i.e., first digit after dot is >=5), the code increments the integer part and removes leading zeros.\n\nWhen rounding is not needed, the code outputs the integer part as is, including leading zeros.\n\nSo for example, if input is \"000123.456\", then output is \"000123\".\n\nIf input is \"000123.5\", then output is \"124\" (since 000123 becomes 123, add 1 to 124, leading zeros removed).\n\nSo in the code:\n\nIn the case where we don't round up, we loop through the integer part and print each character. So in C, for that case, we can print the characters from the start up to dot_pos-1.\n\nBut in the Java code, the code loops through each character and appends to _str, then uses BigInteger. So the code is a bit different, but in the case of no rounding, the code just prints the original characters, including leading zeros.\n\nSo in C, for the no-rounding case, we can just print the substring from 0 to dot_pos.\n\nThus, the code steps:\n\nRead input into a buffer.\n\nFind the dot position.\n\nCheck if the character before the dot is '9'. If yes, print message.\n\nElse, check next character after dot.\n\nIf next character >= '5':\n\n- extract integer_part.\n\n- increment it.\n\n- remove leading zeros.\n\n- print the result.\n\nElse:\n\n- print the substring from 0 to dot_pos.\n\nBut in C, strings are null-terminated, so when we have the input as \"123.456\", the str is an array of {'1','2','3','.', ...}, and dot_pos is 3. So the integer_part is the first 3 characters (indices 0,1,2).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nchar str[1000];\nfgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);\n// Remove possible newline\nstr[strcspn(str, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';\n\nint dot_pos = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n    if (str[i] == '.') {\n        dot_pos = i;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nif (dot_pos == -1) {\n    // No dot found? According to the problem statement, perhaps input is always a valid decimal number.\n    // But code may need to handle this. However, per Java code, input has a dot.\n    // Assume that input is correct.\n    // For safety, perhaps return error, but the problem may assume the input has a dot.\n    // So proceed under assumption that dot is found.\n}\n\nif (str[dot_pos - 1] == '9') {\n    printf(\"GOTO Vasilisa.\\n\");\n} else if (str[dot_pos + 1] >= '5') {\n    // Need to round up.\n    char integer_part[1000];\n    strncpy(integer_part, str, dot_pos);\n    integer_part[dot_pos] = '\\0';\n    increment(integer_part);\n    remove_leading_zeros(integer_part);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", integer_part);\n} else {\n    // Print the integer part as is.\n    for (int i = 0; i < dot_pos; i++) {\n        putchar(str[i]);\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n}\n\nNow, the functions increment and remove_leading_zeros need to be implemented.\n\nBut wait, in C, when you pass a string to a function, it's passed as a pointer. So the functions can modify the array in place.\n\nImplement the increment function:\n\nvoid increment(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int carry = 1;\n    for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0 && carry; --i) {\n        int digit = num[i] - '0';\n        digit += carry;\n        carry = digit / 10;\n        num[i] = (digit % 10) + '0';\n    }\n    if (carry) {\n        // Need to add a '1' at the beginning.\n        // Move all characters one position to the right.\n        memmove(num + 1, num, len + 1); // len +1 to include null terminator\n        num[0] = '1';\n    }\n}\n\nThen the remove_leading_zeros function:\n\nvoid remove_leading_zeros(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int non_zero_index = 0;\n    while (non_zero_index < len && num[non_zero_index] == '0') {\n        non_zero_index++;\n    }\n    if (non_zero_index == len) {\n        // All zeros. So leave as \"0\".\n        num[0] = '0';\n        num[1] = '\\0';\n    } else {\n        // Shift the string to remove leading zeros.\n        memmove(num, num + non_zero_index, len - non_zero_index + 1); // +1 for null terminator\n    }\n}\n\nNow, let's test some scenarios.\n\nTest case 1: input \"123.456\"\n\ndot_pos is 3.\n\nstr[dot_pos-1] is '3' (not 9), str[dot_pos+1] is '4' which is <5. So output the integer part: \"123\".\n\nTest case 2: input \"123.499\"\n\ndot_pos is 3. Next character is '4', so output \"123\".\n\nTest case 3: input \"123.5\"\n\ndot_pos is 3. Next character is '5', so need to increment.\n\ninteger_part is \"123\", increment to \"124\", no leading zeros. Output \"124\".\n\nTest case 4: input \"999.5\"\n\ndot_pos is 3. str[dot_pos-1] is '9', so output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nTest case 5: input \"009.5\"\n\ndot_pos is 3. str[2] is '9'? Wait, no. Wait, the input is \"009.5\", the dot is at index 3. So the character before the dot is str[2], which is '9'. So the code would output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nWait, but in this case, the code checks if str[dot_pos -1] is '9', which in this case it is. So the code outputs the message. But the integer part is \"009\", which when rounded would become \"010\" (if not for the 9 check). But since the last digit before the dot is 9, the code outputs the message.\n\nAnother test case: input \"129.5\". The character before the dot is '9', so output the message.\n\nAnother test case: input \"999999999999.5\".\n\nThen, the code would output the message.\n\nAnother case: input \"0000.5\".\n\nThe character before the dot is '0', so no. Then the next character is '5', so need to increment.\n\ninteger_part is \"0000\", increment becomes \"10000\", then remove leading zeros becomes \"10000\".\n\nSo output is \"10000\".\n\nAnother case: input \"0001.5\". Increment \"0001\" to \"0002\" \u2192 but after increment, the function adds 1 to '1', becomes '2', no carry. So integer_part becomes \"0002\". Then remove leading zeros \u2192 \"2\". So output is \"2\".\n\nWait, but according to the code, after incrementing, we call remove_leading_zeros. So for \"0001\" \u2192 increment becomes \"0002\"? No. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal integer_part is \"0001\".\n\nIncrement function:\n\nStart from the last character (index 3, '1').\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1 = 2. carry is 0.\n\nSo the string becomes \"0002\".\n\nNo carry. So no leading digits added.\n\nThen remove_leading_zeros: the non_zero_index is 3 (since first three are zeros). So len is 4.\n\nnon_zero_index becomes 3 (since str[3] is '2' no, wait: the string is \"0002\".\n\nLoop:\n\nnon_zero_index starts at 0. num[0] is '0' \u2192 increment to 1.\n\nnum[1] is '0' \u2192 increment to 2.\n\nnum[2] is '0' \u2192 increment to 3.\n\nnum[3] is '2' \u2192 non_zero_index is 3.\n\nSo len is 4. non_zero_index is 3.\n\nSo memmove(num, num +3, 4-3 +1) \u2192 2 bytes. So the string becomes \"2\\0\".\n\nSo output is \"2\".\n\nBut the original integer_part was \"0001\", which after increment becomes \"0002\". Then leading zeros are removed to become \"2\".\n\nSo in the case where the integer part is \"0001\" and we need to round up, the output is \"2\".\n\nWhich matches the Java code's behavior. Because in Java, _str is \"0001\", parsed as 1, add 1 becomes 2, output is \"2\".\n\nYes. So this code handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0009.4\".\n\nThe character before the dot is '9', so output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nBut the input is \"0009.4\" \u2192 str[dot_pos-1] is '9', so code outputs the message.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0009.5\".\n\ndot_pos is 4. str[3] is '9', so output the message.\n\nAnother case: input \"199.4\".\n\nThen, the first digit after the dot is 4 \u2192 no rounding. So output \"199\".\n\nAnother case: input \"199.6\".\n\nFirst digit after dot is 6 \u2192 need to round up. integer_part is \"199\" \u2192 increment to \"200\". Output \"200\".\n\nSo this code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, code in C.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nInput \"0.9\".\n\ndot_pos is 1. str[0] is '0'. Not '9'. Next character is '9' \u2192 >=5. So increment \"0\" to \"1\". Output \"1\".\n\nInput \"0.4\" \u2192 output \"0\".\n\nInput \"9.9\" \u2192 str[0] is '9', so output message.\n\nSo code should handle these.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nNeed to handle the input correctly. Also, check for the presence of the dot. But the problem's code probably ensures that the input is a valid number with exactly one dot.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, the includes.\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nThen, the function prototypes.\n\nvoid increment(char *num);\nvoid remove_leading_zeros(char *num);\n\nThen, the main function.\n\nint main() {\n    char str[1000];\n    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);\n    // Remove trailing newline\n    str[strcspn(str, \"\\n\")] = '\\0';\n\n    int dot_pos = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        if (str[i] == '.') {\n            dot_pos = i;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (dot_pos == -1) {\n        // According to problem's input, this shouldn't happen\n        // Handle error? Or proceed, but per Java code, input has a dot.\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the digit before dot is '9'\n    if (str[dot_pos - 1] == '9') {\n        printf(\"GOTO Vasilisa.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        // Check first digit after dot\n        if (str[dot_pos + 1] >= '5') {\n            // Need to increment the integer part\n            char integer_part[1000];\n            strncpy(integer_part, str, dot_pos);\n            integer_part[dot_pos] = '\\0';\n            increment(integer_part);\n            remove_leading_zeros(integer_part);\n            printf(\"%s\\n\", integer_part);\n        } else {\n            // Print integer part as is\n            for (int i = 0; i < dot_pos; i++) {\n                putchar(str[i]);\n            }\n            putchar('\\n');\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Function definitions\n\nvoid increment(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int carry = 1;\n    for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0 && carry; --i) {\n        int digit = num[i] - '0';\n        digit += carry;\n        carry = digit / 10;\n        num[i] = (digit % 10) + '0';\n    }\n    if (carry) {\n        memmove(num + 1, num, len + 1);\n        num[0] = '1';\n    }\n}\n\nvoid remove_leading_zeros(char *num) {\n    int len = strlen(num);\n    int non_zero_index = 0;\n    while (non_zero_index < len && num[non_zero_index] == '0') {\n        non_zero_index++;\n    }\n    if (non_zero_index == len) {\n        // All zeros\n        num[0] = '0';\n        num[1] = '\\0';\n    } else {\n        memmove(num, num + non_zero_index, len - non_zero_index + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test with some inputs.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 123.456\n\nOutput: 123\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput: 123.567\n\nOutput: 124\n\nTest case 3:\n\nInput: 999.999\n\nOutput: GOTO Vasilisa.\n\nTest case 4:\n\nInput: 009.500 \u2192 output GOTO Vasilisa. Because the character before the dot is '9'.\n\nWait, input is \"009.500\".\n\ndot_pos is 3. str[2] is '9', so output message.\n\nTest case 5:\n\nInput: 000.5 \u2192 str[dot_pos-1] is '0', so proceed. First digit after dot is '5' \u2192 round up.\n\ninteger_part is \"000\" \u2192 increment to \"001\", then remove leading zeros \u2192 \"1\".\n\nSo output is \"1\".\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: input \"000.4\" \u2192 output \"000\".\n\nAnother case: \"199.4\" \u2192 output \"199\".\n\nAnother case: \"199.6\" \u2192 output \"200\".\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- What if the input has no digits after the dot? Like \"123.\"? But according to the problem statement, the input is a valid number. So the Java code would crash when checking str[dot_pos +1], but the problem's code probably ensures that there is at least one digit after the dot. The code in C would read a '\\0' in str[dot_pos +1], which is 0, which is less than 5, so output the integer part.\n\nBut in the original Java code, str[dotIndex +1] would throw an exception if there are no digits after the dot. So assuming the input is valid, which is likely.\n\nSo the code is correct."
