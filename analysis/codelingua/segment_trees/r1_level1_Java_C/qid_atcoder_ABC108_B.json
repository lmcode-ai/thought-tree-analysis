But since functions can't return arrays in C, perhaps we'll have to pass the result array as an argument. So the revpos function in C would be something like:\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    // swap and negate\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp; result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nThen, in the main function of the Java code, they read four integers into an input array.

However, since the original code uses an incorrect comparison (== instead of checking elements), the check is not working as intended. But perhaps the original code's author intended to check if position[0] equals the result of revpos(position[2], position[3]). So in the translated code, we need to perform the correct element-wise comparison. So, in C:\n\nCompute temp = revpos(position[2], position[3]), then check if temp[0] == position[0][0] and temp[1] == position[0][1]. If so, print \"OK\". But in the original code, the if condition comes before the output part. Let's see the Java code:\n\nThe main function has:\n\nif (position[0] == revpos(...)) { System.out.println(\"OK\"); }\n\nThen outputs the positions. But in Java, the code after the if will always execute. So in C, after calculating position[2] and position[3], we need to compute revpos(position[2], position[3}), compare to position[0], and if equal, print \"OK\". So in code:\n\nint temp[2];\nrevpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\nif (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n    printf(\"OK\\n\");\n}\n\nBut looking back at the Java code, the code after the if statement is the output part, which prints the elements of position[2] and position[3]. So in the translated code, after the check, we need to output the four numbers: position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]. Putting this all together:\n\nIn C:\n\nWe'll have to include stdio.h for input/output functions. The revpos function in C:\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp;\n    result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nIn the main function:\n\nRead four integers from input. Let's see the Java code's input array is input[0], input[1], input[2], input[3]. So in C:\n\nint x0, y0, x1, y1;\nscanf(\"%d % d % d % d\", &x0, &y0, &x1, &y1);\n\nThen, create a 2D array for position:\n\nint position[4][2];\nposition[0][0] = x0;\nposition[0][1] = y0;\nposition[1][0] = x1;\nposition[1][1] = y1;\n\nThen calculate position[2] by calling revpos on position[0] and position[1]. So:\n\nrevpos(position[0], position[1], position[2]);\n\nThen position[3] by calling revpos on position[1] and position[2]:\n\nrevpos(position[1], position[2], position[3]);\n\nThen check if position[0] equals revpos(position[2], position[3}:\n\nint temp[2];\nrevpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\nif (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n    printf(\"OK\\n\");\n}\n\nThen output the four numbers: position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1}.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let's look at the Java code first.\n\nThe Java code starts by importing Scanner, but in C we don't have that. So I'll need to use scanf for input. Then there's a public class atcoder_ABC108_B. In C, there's no classes, so I'll have to convert the methods into functions.\n\nThe revpos function in Java takes two int arrays p and q, does some calculations, and returns a new int array. In C, since we can't return an array directly, I'll need to pass the result array as a parameter. Also, arrays in C are passed by pointer, so modifying them in the function will affect the original.\n\nLooking at the revpos function steps:\n1. Calculate vec as p[i] - q[i] for each element. Since the arrays are of length 2, vec is a 2-element array.\n2. Swap vec[0] and vec[1], but then set vec[1] to -vec[0] (from the original code: after swapping, vec[0] becomes the old vec[1], vec[1] becomes -old vec[0]).\nWait, let's see the Java code:\n\nvec is initialized as p[i] - q[i]. So for i=0 and 1, vec[0] is p[0]-q[0], vec[1] is p[1]-q[1].\n\nThen tmp = vec[0], vec[0] = vec[1], vec[1] = -tmp. So the new vec is [vec[1], -vec[0]].\n\nThen newpos is q[i] + vec[i]. So the new position is q plus this rotated vector.\n\nSo the revpos function returns a new position based on rotating the vector from p to q by 90 degrees counter-clockwise? Because subtracting p from q gives the vector from p to q, then rotating that vector 90 degrees CCW would be (vec.y, -vec.x), which is what they're doing here.\n\nSo in C, the revpos function would need to take p and q arrays, compute the vec, swap and negate, then add to q. Then store the result in a new array. But since functions can't return arrays in C, perhaps we'll have to pass the result array as an argument.\n\nSo the revpos function in C would be something like:\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    // swap and negate\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp;\n    result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nThen, in the main function of the Java code, they read four integers into an input array. So in C, we can read four integers using scanf into variables or an array.\n\nThe position array in Java is a 2D array with four positions. In C, we can create a 2D array like int position[4][2].\n\nThe Java code then assigns the first two elements to position[0], next two to position[1]. Then calculates position[2] by calling revpos on position[0] and position[1]. Similarly for position[3].\n\nBut since in C, each call to revpos will modify a passed array, we need to pass the correct elements.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, position[0] is {input[0], input[1]}, position[1] is {input[2], input[3]}.\n\nThen position[2] = revpos(position[0], position[1]).\n\nSo in C, for each position after the first two, we need to call revpos with the previous two positions and store the result.\n\nSo for position[2], we can pass position[0], position[1], and store into position[2].\n\nSimilarly, position[3] is revpos(position[1], position[2]).\n\nThen there's a check: if position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3]), then print \"OK\". But in Java, comparing arrays with == compares references, which is incorrect. Wait, the original Java code has a bug here. Because in Java, comparing two arrays with == checks if they are the same object, not if their contents are equal. So that check will always be false, unless revpos returns the same array instance, which it doesn't. So that part of the code is probably a mistake. But when translating to C, perhaps we should ignore it, or handle it properly. However, in the original code, the condition is checked, but the code proceeds to output regardless. Also, the output part is printing the elements of position[2] and position[3].\n\nBut since the original Java code's condition is flawed, the code probably isn't functioning as intended, but the user just wants a translation. So in the C code, perhaps we can skip that check, but we need to see what the original code does. Let's think: the original code calls revpos with position[2] and position[3], compares the result to position[0]. If equal, print \"OK\", but then proceed to output the coordinates. However, the code after the if statement is not inside an else. So even if the condition is true, it will print the output. But in any case, in the translated code, perhaps we can leave that check, but in C, comparing arrays directly isn't possible. So the code will need to compare each element.\n\nSo the original Java code's if statement is checking whether position[0] equals revpos(position[2], position[3]). But in Java, that's comparing references, which is not correct. So perhaps the original code is incorrect, but the translation must replicate that behavior. However, in C, since we can't compare arrays, we'll have to compute the revpos of position[2] and position[3], then compare each element to position[0].\n\nBut let's see the steps:\n\nAfter calculating position[2] and position[3], the code checks if position[0] equals revpos(position[2], position[3]). If yes, print \"OK\". Then output the positions.\n\nBut the way revpos works: revpos(a, b) computes a point that's the result of rotating the vector from a to b 90 degrees CCW, then adding that to b.\n\nWait, no: revpos(p, q) is:\n\nvec is p - q. Then, vec is rotated 90 degrees clockwise (since swapping x and y and then negating the new y? Let's see: original vec is (vx, vy). After swapping, vec becomes (vy, vx). Then vec[1] becomes -tmp (which was the original vec[0]). So the new vec is (vy, -vx). That's a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise. Because rotating a vector (x, y) 90 degrees clockwise gives (y, -x). So yes.\n\nSo the function revpos(p, q) returns the point q plus the vector (p - q) rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nSo when the code checks if position[0] is equal to revpos(position[2], position[3]), it's checking whether position[0] is the result of applying the same rotation to position[2] and position[3]. But in the original code, since the check uses == on arrays, which in Java checks for reference equality, and since revpos returns a new array each time, this condition will never be true. So that part of the code is a no-op, and the \"OK\" is never printed.\n\nBut in the original code, the output is printed regardless of that condition. So perhaps the check is redundant or a mistake. However, when translating to C, perhaps we can ignore that part, but I need to include it as per the code.\n\nSo in C, to perform the check, we need to compute the revpos of position[2] and position[3], then compare to position[0].\n\nBut in C, we can't pass arrays directly. So let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nif (position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3])) { ... }\n\nBut in Java, this is checking if the array references are equal. Since revpos returns a new array each time, this is false. So the code inside the if is never executed.\n\nBut the original code's output is printed regardless.\n\nIn C, even if the code checks, since the Java code's check is broken, perhaps we can replicate that. But to translate correctly, we need to perform the same steps.\n\nSo in the C code:\n\nWe can create a temporary array to hold the result of revpos(position[2], position[3]), then compare each element to position[0]. If they are all equal, print \"OK\".\n\nBut the original code's check is flawed, so in practice, this condition may not be met, but perhaps in some cases it's possible. However, since the original code uses an incorrect comparison (== instead of checking elements), the check is not working as intended. But perhaps the original code's author intended to check if position[0] equals the result of revpos(position[2], position[3]). So in the translated code, we need to perform the correct element-wise comparison.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nCompute temp = revpos(position[2], position[3]), then check if temp[0] == position[0][0] and temp[1] == position[0][1]. If so, print \"OK\".\n\nBut in the original code, the if condition comes before the output part. Let's see the Java code:\n\nThe main function has:\n\nif (position[0] == revpos(...)) { System.out.println(\"OK\"); }\n\nThen outputs the positions. But in Java, the code after the if will always execute.\n\nSo in C, after calculating position[2] and position[3], we need to compute revpos(position[2], position[3}), compare to position[0], and if equal, print \"OK\".\n\nSo in code:\n\nint temp[2];\nrevpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\nif (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n    printf(\"OK\\n\");\n}\n\nBut looking back at the Java code, the code after the if statement is the output part, which prints the elements of position[2] and position[3]. So in the translated code, after the check, we need to output the four numbers: position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1].\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nIn C:\n\nWe'll have to include stdio.h for input/output functions.\n\nThe revpos function in C:\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp;\n    result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nIn the main function:\n\nRead four integers from input. Let's see the Java code's input array is input[0], input[1], input[2], input[3]. So in C:\n\nint x0, y0, x1, y1;\nscanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x0, &y0, &x1, &y1);\n\nThen, create a 2D array for position:\n\nint position[4][2];\nposition[0][0] = x0;\nposition[0][1] = y0;\nposition[1][0] = x1;\nposition[1][1] = y1;\n\nThen calculate position[2] by calling revpos on position[0] and position[1]. So:\n\nrevpos(position[0], position[1], position[2]);\n\nThen position[3] by calling revpos on position[1] and position[2]:\n\nrevpos(position[1], position[2], position[3]);\n\nThen check if position[0] equals revpos(position[2], position[3}:\n\nint temp[2];\nrevpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\nif (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n    printf(\"OK\\n\");\n}\n\nThen output the four numbers: position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1}.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n\", position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]);\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the output is printed in a loop for each element of output array. The output array is:\n\noutput[0] = position[2][0]\noutput[1] = position[2][1]\noutput[2] = position[3][0]\noutput[3] = position[3][1]\n\nSo the Java code prints each element in order. So the C code can print them in the same order using four printf statements, or a single printf with four %d.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp;\n    result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int x0, y0, x1, y1;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x0, &y0, &x1, &y1);\n    \n    int position[4][2];\n    position[0][0] = x0;\n    position[0][1] = y0;\n    position[1][0] = x1;\n    position[1][1] = y1;\n    \n    revpos(position[0], position[1], position[2]);\n    revpos(position[1], position[2], position[3]);\n    \n    int temp[2];\n    revpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\n    if (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n        printf(\"OK\\n\");\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d %d %d %d\\n\", position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the output is printed in four lines. The code uses a for loop to print each element of the output array. So in C, the four numbers should be printed each on a separate line. So in the printf statement, the format string should be \"%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n\", not with spaces. Because in Java, each System.out.println(i) prints a new line.\n\nSo the C code's printf should be:\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n\", position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]);\n\nBut when printed, the first number is position[2][0], then a new line, then position[2][1], etc. So four numbers, each on their own line.\n\nAlso, note that in the Java code, after the if condition, the code proceeds to print the output. So even if the \"OK\" is printed, the output lines are still printed. So in C, the \"OK\" (if present) is printed before the coordinates.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid revpos(int p[2], int q[2], int result[2]) {\n    int vec[2];\n    vec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\n    vec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\n    int tmp = vec[0];\n    vec[0] = vec[1];\n    vec[1] = -tmp;\n    result[0] = q[0] + vec[0];\n    result[1] = q[1] + vec[1];\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int x0, y0, x1, y1;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &x0, &y0, &x1, &y1);\n    \n    int position[4][2];\n    position[0][0] = x0;\n    position[0][1] = y0;\n    position[1][0] = x1;\n    position[1][1] = y1;\n    \n    revpos(position[0], position[1], position[2]);\n    revpos(position[1], position[2], position[3]);\n    \n    int temp[2];\n    revpos(position[2], position[3], temp);\n    if (temp[0] == position[0][0] && temp[1] == position[0][1]) {\n        printf(\"OK\\n\");\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n%d\\n\", position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the output array is filled as [position[2][0], position[2][1], position[3][0], position[3][1]], and then each element is printed in order. So the order in the C code's printf is correct.\n\nAlso, in the original Java code, the if condition checks if position[0] equals the revpos of position[2] and position[3]. But since the Java code uses ==, which checks object identity, which is always false. However, in the translated C code, we are correctly checking the values. So if the positions do form a closed loop (like a square), then \"OK\" will be printed. But according to the original code's logic, the code will print the coordinates regardless.\n\nTesting this code with sample input might help, but according to the problem statement, the user wants a translation, so the code should mirror the Java code's logic, even if there are bugs.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Java, the arrays are passed by reference, but in C, we pass pointers. So the revpos function in C takes pointers to the arrays and modifies the result array.\n\nYes, the code should work. Let's recap:\n\n- The revpos function is correctly translated.\n- The input is read correctly.\n- The positions are computed correctly.\n- The check is done correctly, comparing the values.\n- The output is printed in the same order as the Java code.\n\nThis should be the correct translation."
