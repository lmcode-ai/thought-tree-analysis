It increments a result counter and breaks when it finds \"0\". Then it prints the result.\n\nHmm. In C, I don't have the BufferedReader or PrintWriter. So I'll need to use standard C functions like scanf or fgets for input, and printf for output.\n\nFirst, the input. The Java code reads a line and splits by spaces. In C, I can read the entire line using fgets, then split into tokens using strtok. Each token is a part of the input array.\n\nWait, but in C, handling strings is a bit more manual. Let me think. The input is a line of space-separated integers. The Java code checks each token; once it finds a \"0\", it stops and returns the position (starting from 1, since result increments before checking).\n\nWait, let me see: in the Java code, the loop is over the input_array. For each str in the array, result starts at 0, then increments by 1. Then checks if the str is \"0\" and breaks. So the result is the position (1-based) of the first 0 in the input array. For example, if the input is \"3 1 4 0 5\", then the result would be 4, because the fourth element is 0.\n\nSo the C code needs to do the same.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the entire line of input.\n2. Split into tokens based on spaces.\n3. Iterate through each token, keeping a count starting at 0.\n4. For each token, increment the count, then check if it's \"0\". If so, break.\n5. Output the count.\n\nIn C, the steps would be:\n\nUse fgets to read the line. Then use strtok to split into tokens. Loop through each token, incrementing a counter. Check if the token is \"0\", and break the loop if so. Then print the counter.\n\nBut I need to handle the input correctly. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the input is read as a line. So in C, using fgets with a buffer. For example:\n\nchar buffer[256];\nfgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n\nThen split using strtok:\n\nchar *token;\ntoken = strtok(buffer, \" \");\nint result = 0;\n\nThen loop through tokens:\n\nwhile (token != NULL) {\n    result++;\n    if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) {\n        break;\n    }\n    token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n}\n\nThen print result.\n\nWait, but strtok splits on consecutive spaces. So if the input line has multiple spaces between numbers, strtok will handle it. But when using fgets, the newline is included. So when splitting by space, the last token might have a newline. For example, if the input is \"3 1 0\\n\", the last token would be \"0\\n\". Then strcmp with \"0\" would fail.\n\nSo need to trim the newline from the buffer. How?\n\nAfter fgets, replace the newline with a null terminator:\n\nsize_t len = strlen(buffer);\nif (len > 0 && buffer[len-1] == '\\n') {\n    buffer[len-1] = '\\0';\n}\n\nThen proceed to split.\n\nAlternatively, when comparing, maybe check if the token ends with a newline. But trimming the buffer first is better.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead the line with fgets, trim the newline.\n\nSplit into tokens using strtok.\n\nInitialize result to 0.\n\nLoop over tokens, increment result each time. Compare the token to \"0\". If match, break.\n\nPrint result.\n\nSo code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[256];\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n    // Trim newline\n    size_t len = strlen(buffer);\n    if (len > 0 && buffer[len-1] == '\\n') {\n        buffer[len-1] = '\\0';\n    }\n    char *token = strtok(buffer, \" \");\n    int result = 0;\n    while (token != NULL) {\n        result++;\n        if (strcmp(token, \"0\") == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        token = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but what if the input line is longer than 255 characters? Well, the original Java code reads the entire line, but in practice, the input is probably within the buffer size. If it's a problem, maybe use a larger buffer. But for the purposes of this problem, assuming the input line isn't longer than 255.\n\nAnother edge case: if there's no 0 in the input. Then the result is the number of tokens. But according to the problem statement, I think there's supposed to be exactly one 0. But the original Java code handles even if there's no 0. For example, if the input is all numbers, then it would count all tokens.\n\nBut according to the problem's context (probably a programming competition problem), perhaps the input is guaranteed to have exactly one 0. So the code can proceed as written.\n\nTesting this code: for input \"3 1 4 0 5\", the code would split into tokens \"3\", \"1\", \"4\", \"0\", \"5\" (wait, no. Because after trimming the newline, the input line \"3 1 4 0 5\" would split into \"3\", \"1\", \"4\", \"0\", \"5\" (assuming the input line is entered correctly). Wait, no. Wait, if the input line is \"3 1 4 0 5\", then after fgets, the buffer contains \"3 1 4 0 5\\n\" (assuming the user hit enter). Then trimming the newline, the buffer becomes \"3 1 4 0 5\". Then strtok splits on space. So tokens are \"3\", \"1\", \"4\", \"0\", \"5\". Then in the loop:\n\ntoken is \"3\", result increments to 1. Not 0. Then next token \"1\", result 2. \"4\" result 3. \"0\" -> result 4, check strcmp, which is 0. Break. So output 4. Which matches the Java code.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0\", then after trimming, buffer is \"0\". strtok gets token \"0\", result increments to 1, then break. Output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"5 3 2 0 0\", the loop stops at first 0, result is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work."
