Then, even if n is reduced, the loop continues up to the original sqrt. But that's okay because after dividing out all factors of i (starting from 2), the remaining n will not have any factors smaller than i. So if i is larger than the current sqrt(n), then it's impossible for i to divide the current n. So in that case, the loop can continue but won't do anything. So the code is correct. So the C code can follow the same approach. So the steps are:\n\nRead n as a long long. Compute sqrt_n as (int)sqrt(n). Loop i from 2 to sqrt_n:\n\n   while i divides n, count the exponent. then, for j from 1, subtract j from count, add to answer each time. After processing all i, if n >1, answer++.

Suppose during the loop, n is reduced to a value smaller than the original sqrt_n. For example, original n is 100, sqrt_n is 10. Then, during processing i=2, n becomes 25. Then i=3, but 3^2 is 9 <25. Then i=5, which is <=10. Then processing i=5, count=2, and after that, n becomes 1. So the loop continues to i=10, but after i=5, n is 1, so all subsequent i's will not divide n. So the code is still correct. But the loop runs up to the original sqrt_n, but after n is reduced, the actual sqrt(n) may be smaller. But since any remaining factors would have to be primes, and the code checks if n>1 at the end. So the code is correct. Another test case: n=12. Factors are 2^2*3^1. Processing i from 2 to sqrt(12)=3.\n\ni=2: count=2. Then j=1: count-1=1 >=0, answer becomes 1. j=2: count is 1, 1-2=-1 <0, so loop ends. So total 1 for 2^2.\n\ni=3: count=1. j=1: 1-1=0 >=0, answer increments to 2. j=2: 0-2 <0. So answer is 2. Then n becomes 1. The loop continues to i=3 (since sqrt_n is 3).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me first understand what the original code does. \n\nThe Java program reads a long integer n, then finds the number of prime factors in a specific way. Let's break it down. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Take the square root of n.\n2. Iterate from i=2 to sqrt, checking if i is a factor of n.\n3. For each i, count how many times it divides n (the exponent).\n4. Then, subtract j from the count starting at 1, incrementing j each time, as long as count -j >=0. Each time this happens, increment the answer.\n5. Finally, if after processing all factors up to sqrt(n), the remaining n is greater than 1, add 1 to the answer (since that remaining n is a prime).\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's think about the differences between Java and C here.\n\nFirst, in Java, the variables are declared with types like long, int. In C, we'll need to use long long for the large numbers, since n can be up to 1e12 (since in Java, the input is a long, which is 64-bit). So in C, we should use long long for n.\n\nThe input part: Java uses Scanner, but in C, we can use scanf with %lld to read a long long.\n\nThen, the square root. Java's Math.sqrt returns a double, but in C, sqrt() is in math.h. However, since we need to cast it to an integer, maybe we can use sqrtl to get the square root of a long long, then cast to int. Wait, but in the original code, sqrt is the integer part of the square root. So perhaps in C, we can compute (long long)sqrt(n) but cast to int. Wait, but n can be up to 1e12, so the square root can be up to 1e6 (since 1e6 squared is 1e12). So an int should be sufficient, as int can hold up to 2e9 (assuming 32-bit int). So the sqrt variable in Java is an int. In C, we'll do the same: take the sqrt of n as a double, cast to int. But wait, when n is a long long, perhaps we need to use sqrtl to get the correct square root. Let me think. In Java, the code is (int) Math.sqrt(n), where n is a long. So when n is a long, Math.sqrt(n) returns a double. So in C, when n is a long long, we can compute sqrt(n) as a double, but that might lose precision for very large values. So maybe we should use a more accurate method to compute the integer square root. Alternatively, since the loop runs up to sqrt, maybe the code will still work even if the sqrt is a bit off. But perhaps in the Java code, when you cast the sqrt to int, it's taking the floor. So in C, we can do the same: compute sqrt(n) as (long long)sqrt(n), but wait, n is a long long. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the original Java code:\n\nlong n = scanner.nextLong();\nint sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);\n\nSo, for example, if n is 1e18, Math.sqrt(n) would be 1e9, and cast to int. But 1e9 is larger than the maximum int value (which is 2,147,483,647). Wait, Java's int is 32-bit signed, so max is 2^31-1. So if n is 1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is 1,000,000,000. That's less than 2^31-1. So it's safe. But what if n is (2^31)^2 = 2^62? Then sqrt(n) is 2^31, which is 2,147,483,648, which is larger than Java's int max. So in that case, casting to int would overflow. Oh, but in Java, when you cast a double larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE to int, it gives Integer.MAX_VALUE? Or wraps around? That's a problem. But maybe the original code assumes that n is such that sqrt(n) is within int range. But in C, if n is up to 1e18, then sqrt(n) is up to 1e9, which is within the range of a 32-bit int. Wait, 1e9 is 1,000,000,000. Which is under 2^30 (approx 1e9 is 1,073,741,824). Wait, 2^30 is 1,073,741,824. So 1e9 is less than that. So 1e9 can fit into a 32-bit int. So in C, using int for the sqrt variable is okay.\n\nBut perhaps, in C, we can compute the square root as (int)sqrt(n), but since n is a long long, we need to cast it to double first. Wait, sqrt takes a double. So in C, when n is a long long, we can cast it to double, compute sqrt, then cast to int. But that may lose precision for very large n. For example, if n is 1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9, which can be represented exactly as a double. So perhaps this is okay.\n\nAlternatively, to compute the integer square root correctly, perhaps we should use a loop. But that would complicate things. Since the original code uses this approach, perhaps we can proceed similarly.\n\nSo in C, the code would be:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nint sqrt_n = (int)sqrt(n);\n\nBut wait, for n = (k)^2 +1, the sqrt in double could be k, but the actual square root is k. So perhaps the code will still loop correctly. Let's see. For example, if n is 26, then sqrt is 5. So the loop runs up to 5, which is correct. Even if the sqrt is computed as (int)5.999, which is 5, that's correct. So maybe the original code's approach is safe.\n\nSo proceed with that.\n\nThen, the loop runs from i=2 to sqrt (inclusive). For each i, count how many times it divides n. Then, for each j starting from 1, subtract j from count until count >=j. Each subtraction increases the answer by 1.\n\nAfter processing all i up to sqrt, if n is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor, so add 1 to answer.\n\nSo translating this to C:\n\nThe variables:\n\nlong long n;\nscanf(\"%lld\", &n);\nint sqrt_n = (int)sqrt(n);\nint answer = 0;\n\nThen loop i from 2 to sqrt_n:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= sqrt_n; i++) {\n    int count = 0;\n    while (n % i == 0) {\n        n /= i;\n        count++;\n    }\n    for (int j = 1; count - j >=0; j++) {\n        count -= j;\n        answer++;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, n is a long. So in C, after dividing n by i (which is an int), we need to make sure that n is a long long.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter that loop, if n >1, answer++.\n\nThen printf(\"%d\\n\", answer).\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, after processing each i, the code may modify n. Then, after all i's up to sqrt_n, if n is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor. Because any composite number remaining would have a factor <= sqrt(n), but since we have processed all up to sqrt(original n), but after dividing, the remaining n could have a factor larger than the original sqrt(n). But in that case, since all possible small factors have been removed, the remaining n must be a prime. So in that case, adding 1 is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, sqrt is computed once, before the loop. So if during the loop, n is reduced, the sqrt of the original n is still used for the loop. For example, if original n is 100, sqrt is 10. Suppose during the loop, n becomes 2 (after dividing out 2 and 5). But the loop still runs up to i=10. However, since the remaining n is 2, which is less than i (since i starts at 2, but after i=2, the next i is 3, and 3 > sqrt(2) which is ~1.414. So in the loop for i=3 to 10, n is 2. But in those iterations, since 3>2, the loop will not process. So perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the sqrt is computed once, based on the original n. Then, even if n is reduced, the loop continues up to the original sqrt. But that's okay because after dividing out all factors of i (starting from 2), the remaining n will not have any factors smaller than i. So if i is larger than the current sqrt(n), then it's impossible for i to divide the current n. So in that case, the loop can continue but won't do anything. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the C code can follow the same approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n as a long long.\n\nCompute sqrt_n as (int)sqrt(n).\n\nLoop i from 2 to sqrt_n:\n\n   while i divides n, count the exponent.\n\n   then, for j from 1, subtract j from count, add to answer each time.\n\nAfter processing all i, if n >1, answer++.\n\nSo the code in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    long long n;\n    scanf(\"%lld\", &n);\n    int sqrt_n = (int)sqrt(n);\n    int answer = 0;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt_n; i++) {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n % i == 0) {\n            n /= i;\n            count++;\n        }\n        for (int j = 1; count - j >= 0; j++) {\n            count -= j;\n            answer++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (n > 1) {\n        answer++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", answer);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but wait, the sqrt_n is based on the original value of n. Suppose during the loop, n is reduced to a value smaller than the original sqrt_n. For example, original n is 100, sqrt_n is 10. Then, during processing i=2, n becomes 25. Then i=3, but 3^2 is 9 <25. Then i=5, which is <=10. Then processing i=5, count=2, and after that, n becomes 1. So the loop continues to i=10, but after i=5, n is 1, so all subsequent i's will not divide n. So the code is still correct.\n\nBut the loop runs up to the original sqrt_n, but after n is reduced, the actual sqrt(n) may be smaller. But since any remaining factors would have to be primes, and the code checks if n>1 at the end. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=12. Factors are 2^2*3^1.\n\nProcessing i from 2 to sqrt(12)=3.\n\ni=2: count=2. Then j=1: count-1=1 >=0, answer becomes 1. j=2: count is 1, 1-2=-1 <0, so loop ends. So total 1 for 2^2.\n\ni=3: count=1. j=1: 1-1=0 >=0, answer increments to 2. j=2: 0-2 <0. So answer is 2. Then n becomes 1. The loop continues to i=3 (since sqrt_n is 3).\n\nAfter loop, n is 1, so no increment. Total answer is 2. But original code's answer for 12 is 2+1 (from 3^1) ?\n\nWait, let's see the original code.\n\nWait for n=12:\n\ni=2, count=2. Then for j=1, count-j=1 >=0: answer +=1, count=1. Then j=2, count-j= -1: no. So answer is 1 for 2's part.\n\ni=3: count=1. j=1: count-j=0 >=0: answer +=1 (total 2). j=2: 0-2 <0. So answer is 2. Then after loop, n is 12/(2^2*3^1) = 12/ (4*3) = 1. So after loop, n is 1, so no increment. So answer is 2. Which is correct because 12 can be expressed as (2^2) and (3^1). The exponents are handled as 2^1 (using j=1, subtract 1, count becomes 1, but then no more j=2). Then 3^1: j=1. So total 1 +1 = 2. Which is correct. So the code's output is 2.\n\nSo the code works for that case.\n\nAnother test case: n= 24=2^3 *3^1.\n\nProcessing 2^3:\n\nj=1: subtract 1, count=2, answer 1.\n\nj=2: subtract 2, count=0, answer 2. So total 2 for 2^3.\n\n3^1: j=1, subtract 1, answer 3. So total answer is 3.\n\nYes, because 2^3 can be split into 2^1 and 2^2 (so 2 operations), and 3^1 is 1 operation. Total 3.\n\nThe code would output 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the C code should be as written."
