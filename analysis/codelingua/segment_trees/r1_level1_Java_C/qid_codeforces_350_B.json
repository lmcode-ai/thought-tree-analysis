So the Java code may have a bug, but we need to translate it as is, including any potential bugs. So in the translation to C, we need to replicate the exact same string building steps, even if they seem counterintuitive. Now, the steps for the C code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read array a (indices 1..n), then array b (indices 1..n). 3. Compute num array as counts of each value in b.\n\n4. For each i where a[i] is 1, process the path starting at i.\n\n5.

So the output is \"3 2 1\". But the correct path is 1 \u21922 \u21923. So the code's output is reversed. But this is how the Java code works. Thus, in C, the same approach. Now, for the C code:\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read a[1..n] and b[1..n]. Compute num array by counting the occurrences of each value in b. Then, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif a[i] is 1:\n\n   mark st[i] as true. build a temporary string for the path. start with i.\n\n   convert i to string, reverse it, add to the buffer with a leading space. x = b[i]. then loop while st[x] is false, num[x] is 1, x !=0, a[x] is not 1.\n\n   for each x in the loop:\n\n      convert x to string, reverse, append to buffer. mark st[x] as true. x = b[x].\n\n   compare the length of this path with the current maximum, and keep track of the longest. Once all i are processed, output the maximum length and the corresponding path. Now, implementing the string operations:\n\nTo reverse a string in C:\n\nvoid reverse_str(char *str) {\n    int len = strlen(str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {\n        char temp = str[i];\n        str[i] = str[len - 1 - i];\n        str[len - 1 - i] = temp;\n    }\n} Then, for each number, convert to string, reverse it. For example, for number 12:\n\nchar temp[20];\nsprintf(temp, \"%d\", 12); // \"12\"\nreverse_str(temp); // \"21\"\n\nThen append this to the buffer with a space. But the buffer starts with a space.",

For example, if node 2 is part of the path of node 1, then when i=2, even if a[2] is 1, it's skipped because st[2] is already 1. But according to the Java code's logic, this is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to C. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nLooking at the Java code, it's for a Codeforces problem. The main method reads some inputs, processes arrays a, b, num, and then computes something involving paths. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads integer n, then initializes arrays a, b, num of size n+1. Then it reads the a array and the b array. The num array counts the occurrences of each value in b. \n\nThe main logic seems to be in the loop where a[i] is checked if it's 1. For each such i, it builds a path by following the b array elements. The code uses StringBuilders to construct the path in reverse, then reverses them again to get the correct order. The goal is to find the longest path starting from a node where a[i] is 1, following the chain in b until certain conditions are met (like num[x] being 1, and x not 0, and a[x] not 1). The maximum length path is tracked, and then printed.\n\nNow, translating this to C. The main challenges will be handling dynamic strings (since Java uses StringBuilders), simulating the boolean array, and handling input/output.\n\nFirst, let's think about data structures. In C, we'll need to use static arrays since dynamic allocation might be tricky here. The variables n, a, b, num can be declared as static arrays. The boolean array st can be an int array (using 0/1 for false/true) since C doesn't have a built-in bool type (though stdbool.h exists, maybe use that for clarity).\n\nInput: In Java, scanner.nextInt() reads integers. In C, we'll use scanf to read from stdin. So for each loop reading a and b, replace with for loops using scanf.\n\nString handling: The Java code uses StringBuilders to accumulate the path. In C, we'll need to manage character arrays. Since the path is built by appending numbers (as strings) in reverse order and then reversing the whole string, we need to simulate this.\n\nFor example, when the Java code appends \" \" and the reversed sss (which is the string representation of the current number), in C, we can build each part as a string, reverse each part, concatenate with spaces, and then reverse the entire string at the end.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each step, they create a new StringBuilder sss with the current number, reverse it, then append to the main sb. Then, after collecting all parts, the entire sb is reversed. Wait, perhaps the reversing is to handle the order of the path correctly. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nInside the loop when a[i] is 1:\n\n- They create a StringBuilder sb.\n- sss is initialized with i, then reversed. Then sb appends \" \" plus the reversed sss. Wait, but reversing the string of i? For example, if i is 12, sss is \"12\", reversed to \"21\". Then appending \" 21\" to sb. Then, when they collect all the parts, after the loop, they reverse the entire sb. So the order of the numbers is reversed twice. Hmm, perhaps this is a way to build the path in reverse order.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the path is i \u2192 x \u2192 y. The Java code starts with i, appends \" i_reversed\", then x's reversed, then y's reversed. Then, when the entire sb is reversed, the order becomes y_reversed x_reversed i_reversed, but each number's string is reversed. So perhaps this approach is incorrect? Or maybe the numbers are being stored in reverse string order and then reversed again to get the correct numerical order. This part is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the code is building the path in reverse order (like the nodes are collected in reverse, then the entire string is reversed to get the correct order). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Java code has a mistake here. Because when you take i, reverse its string, then append. Then take x, reverse its string, append. Then when the entire sb is reversed, the order of the numbers is in reverse. But perhaps the code is intended to collect the path in reverse order and then reverse the entire string to get the correct path.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the path in reverse order. Let's say the path is i \u2192 x \u2192 y. Then the Java code's loop adds i, then x, then y. But the way they build the string is by appending the reversed string of each, and then reversing the entire thing. Let's see:\n\nSuppose i is 1, x is 2, y is 3.\n\nsss is \"1\", reversed to \"1\". Then sb starts with \" 1\".\n\nThen x=2: sss is \"2\" reversed to \"2\", append \" 2\". So sb is \" 1 2\".\n\nThen y=3: append \" 3\", so sb is \" 1 2 3\". Then sb.reverse(). But wait, the entire string \" 1 2 3\" reversed would be \"3 2 1 \" (since leading space is first). So the output would be \"3 2 1\". But the actual path is 1\u21922\u21923. So the code is generating the path in reverse order. So when the entire sb is reversed, the path is printed in reverse. But that would be 3 2 1. But the actual path is 1 2 3. So perhaps the code has an error here. But according to the problem statement, maybe the correct path is the reverse of the traversal. Hmm, maybe the problem requires the path in the order from the start to the end of the chain. So if the code is building the path as 1 \u2192 2 \u21923, but in the code, the path is stored as 3 \u2192 2 \u21921, but then reversed to get 1 2 3. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the code initializes sss with i, then appends to sb as sss.reverse(). Then in the loop, for each x (which is b[i], then b[x], etc.), the code appends x's reversed string. So, for example:\n\ni is 1: sss is \"1\", reversed is \"1\", sb starts with \" 1\".\n\nThen x = b[1], say 2. Then sss is \"2\", reversed \"2\", so sb appends \" 2\" \u2192 now \" 1 2\".\n\nx becomes b[2], say 3. sss is \"3\" reversed, append \" 3\". So sb is \" 1 2 3\".\n\nThen, after the loop, sb is \" 1 2 3\", then reversed \u2192 \"3 2 1 \" (since the entire string is reversed). So the path becomes 3 2 1. But the actual path is 1 \u21922 \u21923.\n\nSo why does the code do this? That seems like a mistake. Unless the problem requires the path to be in reverse order. Or perhaps the code is incorrect, but that's how it is, and we need to replicate that in C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct. Maybe the problem requires the path to be listed in reverse order. For example, if the chain is 1 \u2192 2 \u21923, then the path is stored as 3 2 1, but when reversed, it becomes 1 2 3. Wait, no. The code does sb.reverse(). So in the example, the sb is \" 1 2 3\", which when reversed becomes \"3 2 1 \". Then the code's output is the reversed string. So the path printed is 3 2 1. But according to the problem statement, this may be incorrect, but since the code is given, we have to replicate its logic.\n\nHmm. So the Java code may have a bug, but we need to translate it as is, including any potential bugs.\n\nSo in the translation to C, we need to replicate the exact same string building steps, even if they seem counterintuitive.\n\nNow, the steps for the C code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read array a (indices 1..n), then array b (indices 1..n).\n\n3. Compute num array as counts of each value in b.\n\n4. For each i where a[i] is 1, process the path starting at i.\n\n5. For each such i, follow the chain x = b[i], then x = b[x], etc., until the conditions (st[x] is false, num[x] == 1, x !=0, a[x] !=1) are met. Each step appends the current x (or i) to the path in a reversed string format, then the entire path is reversed.\n\nSo, in C, the steps for building the string would be:\n\nFor each node in the path, convert the integer to a string, reverse it, append to a temporary buffer. Then after collecting all parts, reverse the entire buffer to get the final path.\n\nBut how to handle this in C? Let's think.\n\nIn Java, for each step, when appending to sb, the code appends \" \" followed by the reversed string of x. Then, after collecting all the parts, the entire sb is reversed and converted to a string.\n\nFor example, in the Java code:\n\n- For i=1, x is 2, then x=3:\n\nss starts as i=1: sss is \"1\", reversed is \"1\", so sb is \" 1\".\n\nThen x=2: sss is \"2\" reversed \u2192 \"2\", append \" 2\" \u2192 \" 1 2\".\n\nx=3: append \" 3\" \u2192 \" 1 2 3\".\n\nThen sb is reversed \u2192 \"3 2 1 \" (assuming leading space?), and then this becomes the path.\n\nSo the path is stored in reverse order, and then reversed again, leading to the correct order.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe Java code's sb starts with appending \" \" + sss.reverse(). Then after collecting all parts, the entire sb is reversed.\n\nSo in the example, the initial sb after the first step is \" 1\".\n\nAfter appending \" 2\", it's \" 1 2\".\n\nAfter appending \" 3\", it's \" 1 2 3\".\n\nThen sb.reverse() would be \"3 2 1 \" (since the entire string is reversed, including the order of the characters). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe string is \" 1 2 3\".\n\nReversed as a string would be \"3 2 1 \" (assuming the original string is \" 1 2 3\" and reversed, each character is reversed. So the entire string becomes '3',' ','2',' ','1',' '.\n\nSo the resulting string is \"3 2 1 \" (but with a leading space in the original string). Wait, no. Let's take the original sb as \" 1 2 3\".\n\nSo the characters are: ' ', '1', ' ', '2', ' ', '3'.\n\nReversed, it would be '3', ' ', '2', ' ', '1', ' '.\n\nSo the string becomes \"3 2 1 \" (with a trailing space). Then, when printed, the output would be \"3 2 1 \" but the Java code trims it? Or maybe the example in the code is not correct.\n\nBut regardless, the C code must replicate this logic.\n\nSo in C, the steps are:\n\nFor each i where a[i] is 1:\n\n- Initialize a temporary buffer to build the path string. Each part is the reversed string of the number, separated by spaces.\n\n- After collecting all parts, reverse the entire string to get the correct order.\n\nWait, but how to do this in C? Let's think.\n\nFor example, for the numbers 1, 2, 3:\n\nIn Java, the parts are added as \" 1\", \" 2\", \" 3\", so the full string is \" 1 2 3\".\n\nReversed, this becomes \"3 2 1 \".\n\nBut the actual desired path is 1 \u21922 \u21923, so the printed path is \"3 2 1\", which is reversed. But that's probably a mistake in the Java code. However, since the problem requires to translate the code as is, we need to replicate this.\n\nSo in C, the approach would be:\n\n- For each number in the path (i, x, ...), convert it to a string, reverse the string, and append it with a space.\n\n- Collect all these reversed number strings into a single buffer.\n\n- Then reverse the entire buffer to get the final path.\n\nBut how to reverse a string in C? We can write a helper function to reverse a string.\n\nSo steps for building the string in C:\n\n1. For each node in the path (starting with i, then x = b[i], etc.):\n\n   a. Convert the number to a string (e.g., using sprintf).\n\n   b. Reverse the string.\n\n   c. Append this reversed string to a buffer, adding a space before each part (similar to the Java code's \" \" + reversed part).\n\n2. Once all parts are added, reverse the entire buffer to get the correct order.\n\nBut wait, the Java code's sb is a collection of parts that are reversed. Then the entire sb is reversed. So the order of the parts in the buffer is reversed. For example, if the parts are [reversed(i), reversed(x), reversed(y)], then the entire buffer is reversed, leading to reversed(y) reversed(x) reversed(i), which when reversed again gives i x y in their original order. Wait, no. Wait, the buffer is built as \" reversed(i) reversed(x) reversed(y) ... \", but the entire buffer is then reversed, which would flip the order of the characters. So in the example, the Java code's sb is built as \" 1 2 3\", then reversed to \"3 2 1 \".\n\nBut perhaps this approach is incorrect, but we need to replicate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's intention is to build the path in reverse order (from the last node to the first), then reverse the string to get the correct order. But in that case, the code is adding the nodes in reverse order and then reversing them again to get the correct path order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct for some problem-specific reason.\n\nIn any case, the C code needs to replicate this exactly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIn C:\n\n- For each i where a[i] is 1, start building the path.\n\n- Create a temporary buffer to hold the parts. Each part is the reversed string of the node number.\n\n- Append each reversed node string with a space.\n\n- After collecting all parts, reverse the entire buffer to get the final path string.\n\nBut in C, managing the buffer is a bit more involved.\n\nFor example:\n\nInitial path for i=1, x=2, x=3:\n\nIn Java, the sb is \" 1 2 3\".\n\nReversed, it's \"3 2 1 \".\n\nSo in C, the same approach:\n\nWe can build a buffer that starts with \" 1 2 3\" (assuming each node is converted to a string, then reversed. Wait, but the Java code reverses the string of the node. For example, node 12 becomes \"21\" as part of the buffer.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the Java code:\n\nFor example, when i is 12, the code does:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(i); // sss is \"12\"\n\nsss.reverse(); // becomes \"21\"\n\nthen sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse().toString()). Wait, no. Wait, the code is:\n\nsss.append(i); // \"12\"\n\nthen sss.reverse(); so sss is \"21\".\n\nThen sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()). Wait, no. Wait, the code is:\n\nIn Java:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(i); // \"12\"\n\nsb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()); \n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(i); // creates a string \"i\"\n\nsb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, sss is the StringBuilder for the current node. For example, if i is 12, then sss is \"12\". Then sss.reverse() is \"21\", so the code appends \" 21\" to sb.\n\nThen, when x is 34, sss is \"34\", reversed to \"43\", append \" 43\".\n\nSo the sb becomes \" 21 43\".\n\nThen, when reversed, the entire sb becomes \"34 12 \" (assuming the entire string is reversed, but considering each character). Wait, the entire string is \" 21 43\". Reversing it gives \"34 12 \".\n\nSo the code's logic is that each node's number is reversed as a string, and then the entire path is reversed as a string. For example, the path is 12 \u219234. The code's sb would have \" 21 43\", which when reversed becomes \"34 12 \", which when printed is \"34 12\" (assuming trimming the trailing space). But the actual path is 12 \u219234, but the code's output is 34 12. So this is incorrect. Unless the problem requires the path to be in reverse order.\n\nBut the Java code is as given, so we have to replicate it.\n\nTherefore, in C, for each node in the path (starting from i, then x = b[i], etc.), we need to:\n\n1. Convert the node number to a string.\n\n2. Reverse the string.\n\n3. Append a space and the reversed string to the buffer.\n\nThen, after collecting all parts, reverse the entire buffer (as a string), which will flip the order of the parts and their characters.\n\nFor example, if the nodes are 12 \u219234:\n\nThe buffer would be \" 21 43\".\n\nReversing the entire buffer gives \"34 12 \".\n\nSo the output is \"34 12\".\n\nBut the actual path is 12 \u219234. So the code's output is reversed. This suggests a possible error in the original Java code, but again, we have to replicate it.\n\nSo for the C code, the steps are:\n\n- For each node in the path, convert the number to a string, reverse it, append to the buffer with a leading space.\n\n- Then reverse the entire buffer string.\n\n- Trim leading and trailing spaces if needed.\n\nBut how to handle this in C.\n\nNow, the code for building the string in C:\n\nWe can create a temporary buffer (a character array) of sufficient size. For each step, we need to:\n\n1. Take the current number (e.g., i), convert it to a string.\n\n2. Reverse that string.\n\n3. Append a space and the reversed string to the buffer.\n\nAfter collecting all nodes, reverse the entire buffer (each character in reverse order), then output.\n\nBut let's take an example:\n\nSuppose i is 1. The path is 1 \u21922 \u21923.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\n- i=1: reversed to \"1\". Append \" 1\".\n\n- x=2: reversed to \"2\". Append \" 2\".\n\n- x=3: reversed to \"3\". Append \" 3\".\n\nThe buffer is \" 1 2 3\".\n\nReversed as a whole: \"3 2 1 \".\n\nSo the output is \"3 2 1\".\n\nBut the correct path is 1 \u21922 \u21923. So the code's output is reversed. But this is how the Java code works.\n\nThus, in C, the same approach.\n\nNow, for the C code:\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read a[1..n] and b[1..n].\n\nCompute num array by counting the occurrences of each value in b.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif a[i] is 1:\n\n   mark st[i] as true.\n\n   build a temporary string for the path.\n\n   start with i.\n\n   convert i to string, reverse it, add to the buffer with a leading space.\n\n   x = b[i].\n\n   then loop while st[x] is false, num[x] is 1, x !=0, a[x] is not 1.\n\n   for each x in the loop:\n\n      convert x to string, reverse, append to buffer.\n\n      mark st[x] as true.\n\n      x = b[x].\n\n   compare the length of this path with the current maximum, and keep track of the longest.\n\nOnce all i are processed, output the maximum length and the corresponding path.\n\nNow, implementing the string operations:\n\nTo reverse a string in C:\n\nvoid reverse_str(char *str) {\n    int len = strlen(str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {\n        char temp = str[i];\n        str[i] = str[len - 1 - i];\n        str[len - 1 - i] = temp;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, for each number, convert to string, reverse it.\n\nFor example, for number 12:\n\nchar temp[20];\nsprintf(temp, \"%d\", 12); // \"12\"\nreverse_str(temp); // \"21\"\n\nThen append this to the buffer with a space.\n\nBut the buffer starts with a space. Wait, the Java code appends \" \" + reversed string. So the first part is \" \" + reversed i, then \" \" + reversed x, etc.\n\nSo the buffer starts with a space, then the reversed i, then space, reversed x, etc.\n\nThen, the entire buffer is reversed.\n\nFor example, the buffer is \" 21 43\", reversed becomes \"34 12 \".\n\nBut when printed, leading spaces may be an issue. However, in the Java code, the output is the reversed string, which may start with a space. For example, if the path is only one node, the buffer is \" 1\", reversed to \"1 \", which when printed would be \"1 \" (with a trailing space). But the Java code's output uses System.out.println(ss), which prints the string as is.\n\nBut in Codeforces, trailing spaces may cause presentation errors, but the original code may have been accepted, so we have to replicate it.\n\nThus, the C code will replicate the same string handling.\n\nNow, the steps for building the buffer in C:\n\nInitialize a buffer array (e.g., char buffer[1000000] or something large enough).\n\nStart with buffer[0] = '\\0';\n\nThen for each node in the path:\n\n   Convert the number to a string, reverse it.\n\n   Append a space and the reversed string to the buffer.\n\nBut how to do this. For example:\n\nstrcat(buffer, \" \");\nstrcat(buffer, reversed_str);\n\nBut since the buffer may be large, we can manage it with a position pointer.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic approach, but in C, it's easier to use fixed-size buffers with enough space.\n\nFor example:\n\nchar current_num_str[20];\nchar reversed_num_str[20];\nfor each node in path:\n\n   sprintf(current_num_str, \"%d\", node);\n   strcpy(reversed_num_str, current_num_str);\n   reverse_str(reversed_num_str);\n   strcat(buffer, \" \");\n   strcat(buffer, reversed_num_str);\n\nBut after this, buffer will have \" 21 43 56\", etc.\n\nThen, after collecting all parts, reverse the entire buffer.\n\nThen, the buffer becomes \"65 34 12 \" (if original buffer was \" 21 43 56\").\n\nWait, no. For example, original buffer is \" 21 43 56\". Reversed character by character, it becomes \"65 34 12 \".\n\nSo the path printed is \"65 34 12 \".\n\nBut in reality, the path is 12 \u219234 \u219256. Wait, no. The original numbers are 12, 34, 56. Their reversed strings are \"21\", \"43\", \"65\". The buffer is \" 21 43 65\". Reversed, the entire string is \"56 34 12 \".\n\nWait, no. The original buffer is \" 21 43 65\". The characters are: ' ', '2', '1', ' ', '4', '3', ' ', '6', '5'.\n\nReversing this entire string gives '5', '6', ' ', '3', '4', ' ', '1', '2', ' '.\n\nSo the reversed string is \"56 34 12 \".\n\nWhich represents the numbers 56, 34, 12. So the path is 12 \u219234 \u219256, but the printed path is 56 34 12, which is the reverse order. So the code's output is reversed. Which again suggests a possible error in the original Java code, but we have to replicate it.\n\nThus, the C code needs to build the buffer with reversed strings of each node, then reverse the entire buffer to get the path in reverse order.\n\nNow, the code structure in C:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a[1..n] and b[1..n].\n\nCompute num array.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\n   if a[i] is 1:\n\n      initialize st[i] = 1.\n\n      create a buffer, start with i's reversed string, prepended by a space.\n\n      x = b[i].\n\n      current length s = 1.\n\n      while st[x] is 0, num[x] == 1, x !=0, a[x] !=1:\n\n          add x to the buffer (reversed string with a space).\n\n          st[x] =1.\n\n          x = b[x].\n\n          s++\n\n      compare s with ans, if larger, update ans and save the buffer.\n\nBut in C, how to manage the buffer for each possible path.\n\nIn the Java code, each candidate path is built, and the longest is kept. So in C, we need to build each possible buffer, then for the longest path, save the buffer.\n\nBut storing the buffer in C requires dynamically managing it. Since the maximum possible n is not given, but for Codeforces problems, it's usually up to 1e5 or 1e4.\n\nBut for the code, let's assume that the maximum path length is manageable. Let's say, for each possible path, the buffer can be up to 1e5 characters. So we can use a temporary buffer for each candidate path, then compare and keep the longest.\n\nThus, in C:\n\nWe can have a global buffer (or a local array) to build the current path's string. Then, if this path is the longest so far, we copy it into a result buffer.\n\nBut in C, handling dynamic memory can be error-prone, so using fixed-size buffers may be better.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nInitialize ans =0.\n\nchar ss[100000] = \"\"; // to store the longest path string.\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\n   if a[i] is 1:\n\n      initialize st[i] =1.\n\n      current buffer: char temp_buffer[100000] = \" \"; // starts with a space.\n\n      // but how to build the temp buffer.\n\n      // need to add the reversed string of i.\n\n      char num_str[20];\n\n      sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", i);\n\n      reverse_str(num_str);\n\n      strcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\n      s =1.\n\n      x = b[i].\n\n      while x is not 0, st[x] is 0, num[x] ==1, a[x] !=1:\n\n          // process x.\n\n          sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", x);\n\n          reverse_str(num_str);\n\n          strcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\n\n          strcat(temp_str, num_str);\n\n          st[x] =1.\n\n          x = b[x].\n\n          s++;\n\n      // after loop.\n\n      reverse_str(temp_buffer);\n\n      // now, trim leading and trailing spaces? Or not.\n\n      // compare s with ans.\n\n      if s > ans:\n\n          ans = s.\n\n          strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n      else if s == ans:\n\n          // if multiple paths have same length, choose the lex smallest? Or no, the problem may not require it.\n\n          // but the Java code overwrites with the latest one with the same length.\n\n          // so the C code should do the same.\n\nThus, the code would need to process each possible i where a[i] is 1, build the temp buffer for each path, and track the maximum.\n\nBut how to reverse the temp_buffer. Because the Java code's sb is built by appending reversed strings of each node, and then reversing the entire buffer.\n\nSo in C, the temp_buffer is built by appending the reversed node strings with spaces, then the entire buffer is reversed.\n\nFor example, for path i=12, x=34, x=56:\n\ntemp_buffer starts as \" 21\".\n\nThen append \" 43\" \u2192 \" 21 43\".\n\nThen append \" 65\" \u2192 \" 21 43 65\".\n\nThen reverse the entire buffer:\n\nOriginal buffer is \" 21 43 65\".\n\nLength is len = strlen(buffer) \u2192 8 (assuming 3 parts: \" 21\", \" 43\", \" 65\" \u2192 each part is 3 characters, total 3*3=9? Let me check: \" 21 43 65\" is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 characters. But the example's string is \" 21 43 65\", which has len 9.\n\nReversing this gives \"56 34 12 \".\n\nBut when we reverse the entire string:\n\nOriginal buffer: \" 21 43 65\".\n\nCharacters: ' ', '2', '1', ' ', '4', '3', ' ', '6', '5'.\n\nReversing each character:\n\n'5', '6', ' ', '3', '4', ' ', '1', '2', ' '.\n\nWhich forms \"56 34 12 \".\n\nSo the string after reversal is \"56 34 12 \".\n\nBut in the Java code, the path is printed as this reversed string. So the output for this example would be \"56 34 12 \".\n\nBut the actual path is 12 \u219234 \u219256, which is correct, but the output is reversed. Unless the problem expects the path in reverse order. So the original Java code may have a bug, but again, we have to replicate it.\n\nThus, in C, for each path, build the temp buffer as a sequence of reversed node strings separated by spaces, then reverse the entire buffer, then store the result if it's the longest.\n\nNow, the code in C.\n\nBut there are some potential issues:\n\n- Managing the st array. The Java code uses a boolean array st, which marks nodes as visited to avoid processing them again. In C, we can use an int array st, initialized to 0, and set to 1 when processed.\n\nBut in the Java code, for each i, the code processes the path, and during that, marks st[x] as true. This is to prevent processing the same node again in other paths. So once a node is part of a path, it is marked and not processed again.\n\nBut in the Java code, after processing a node i, the code marks st[i] as true, then marks each x in the path as true. So other paths that include x will not be processed.\n\nThus, the st array is global, and once a node is part of any path, it's marked as processed.\n\nBut in the C code, we need to reset the st array for each possible i? No, because the st array is reused for all i. So once a node is marked as st[x] =1, it's not processed again.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the st array is initialized as a new boolean array each time. Wait, no. The Java code's st array is declared inside the loop. Wait, no, the Java code's st array is declared outside the loop, but is initialized for each i. Let me check.\n\nIn Java:\n\nboolean st[] = new boolean[n + 1];\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Java code's st array is declared inside the main function, outside the loop. The code has:\n\nboolean st[] = new boolean[n + 1];\n\nThen, for each i in 1..n where a[i] is 1:\n\nst[i] = true;\n\nThen, during processing the path, x is processed and st[x] is set to true.\n\nBut this means that once a node is processed in any path, it's marked as true. So other paths that include this node will not be processed. But this is incorrect, because a node can be part of multiple paths. For example, if a node is part of a path processed in one iteration, but is part of another path in another iteration. But the st array is global, so once marked, it's not processed again.\n\nBut the Java code's st array is declared outside the loop. So it's reused for all i. Thus, once a node is processed in any path, it's marked and not processed again.\n\nBut this is a mistake. Because for example, if there are two paths that start with different i's but share nodes, the first path's processing would mark those nodes as st[x] =true, and the second path's processing would skip them.\n\nBut according to the Java code's logic, this is correct? Or not.\n\nWait, the problem's logic may be that each node can be part of only one path, so once processed, it's marked and not processed again. But the code's logic may have a bug here. However, the translation must replicate this behavior.\n\nThus, in the C code, the st array must be declared as a static array, initially all zeros. Then, when processing each i, if a[i] is 1 and st[i] is 0, then process it, mark st[i] and the subsequent nodes in the path.\n\nBut in the Java code, the st array is declared inside the loop. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe Java code's st array is declared before the loop:\n\nboolean st[] = new boolean[n + 1];\n\nThen, for each i in 1..n:\n\nif (a[i] == 1) {\n\n   st[i] = true;\n\n   ... process ...\n\n   while (...) {\n\n       st[x] = true;\n\n       x = b[x];\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThus, the st array is reused for each i. So, for example, when processing i=1, st[i] is set to true, and all nodes in its path are marked as true. Then, when processing i=2, if a[i] is 1 and st[i] is false (because it wasn't part of any previous path), it's processed. But if it was part of a previous path, st[i] is already true, so it's skipped.\n\nThus, the C code must have the st array declared outside the loop, and initialized to 0 before processing each i.\n\nWait, no. The Java code's st array is declared inside the main function, so each iteration of the loop for i=1..n may process a different i, but the st array is the same. So once a node is marked as true in any iteration, it remains true for all subsequent iterations.\n\nBut this is incorrect, because for example, in a later iteration, another i may have a[i]=1 and not processed yet, but if it's part of a previous path, it's skipped.\n\nBut according to the problem's logic, the code is correct. So the C code must replicate this.\n\nThus, in C, the st array is declared as a static array, initialized to 0, and marked as 1 when processed. So once a node is processed, it's not processed again.\n\nBut in the Java code, for each i where a[i] is 1, it's processed even if st[i] is true? No. Because in the Java code, the st array is initially all false. Then, for each i, if a[i] is 1, st[i] is set to true, and the code proceeds.\n\nBut once i has been processed in a previous iteration (because it was part of another path), st[i] is already true, so the code won't process it again.\n\nThus, in the C code, the st array must be initialized to 0, and once a node is processed, it's marked as 1 and not processed again.\n\nSo the code in C:\n\nint st[MAX_N] = {0}; // where MAX_N is sufficient.\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n\n   if (a[i] == 1 && !st[i]) {\n\n      st[i] = 1;\n\n      // process the path.\n\n      // build the temp buffer.\n\n      char temp_buffer[100000] = \"\";\n\n      // add i to the buffer.\n\n      char num_str[20];\n\n      sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", i);\n\n      reverse_str(num_str);\n\n      strcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\n\n      strcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\n      int s = 1;\n\n      int x = b[i];\n\n      while (x != 0 && st[x] == 0 && num[x] == 1 && a[x] != 1) {\n\n          st[x] = 1;\n\n          sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", x);\n\n          reverse_str(num_str);\n\n          strcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\n\n          strcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\n          x = b[x];\n\n          s++;\n\n      }\n\n      // reverse the temp buffer.\n\n      reverse_str(temp_buffer);\n\n      // compare s to ans.\n\n      if (s > ans) {\n\n          ans = s;\n\n          strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n      } else if (s == ans) {\n\n          // compare lex order? Or take the last one.\n\n          // Java code takes the last one with the same length.\n\n          // So in C, we can do the same.\n\n          strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the st array is initialized inside the loop for each i. No, the Java code's st array is declared once before the loop, and each iteration reuses it. So if during processing i=1, some nodes are marked as true, then when processing i=2, those nodes are already marked.\n\nBut in the Java code, the st array is declared inside the main function, but outside the loop:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    // code to read n, a, b, etc.\n\n    boolean st[] = new boolean[n + 1];\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n\n        if (a[i] == 1) {\n\n            st[i] = true;\n\n            // process...\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, no. The Java code declares the st array once before the loop. So for each i in 1..n, the same st array is used. Thus, once a node is marked as true in any iteration, it remains true for all subsequent iterations.\n\nThus, in the C code, the st array must be declared once before the loop, and not reinitialized for each i.\n\nThus, in C, the st array is declared outside the loop, and marked as 1 as nodes are processed. This way, once a node is processed in any path, it's not processed again.\n\nBut this is a problem. For example, if node 2 is part of the path of node 1, then when i=2, even if a[2] is 1, it's skipped because st[2] is already 1.\n\nBut according to the Java code's logic, this is correct. So the C code must replicate this.\n\nThus, the C code's st array is declared once, initialized to 0, and nodes are marked as processed as they are visited.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe C code will have:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read a array and b array.\n\n- Compute the num array.\n\n- Initialize st array to 0.\n\n- Initialize ans to 0 and ss to empty.\n\n- For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   if a[i] is 1 and st[i] is 0:\n\n      mark st[i] as 1.\n\n      build the path.\n\n      process x = b[i], and so on.\n\n      build the temp buffer.\n\n      reverse the buffer.\n\n      update ans and ss if necessary.\n\nFinally, print ans and ss.\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the st array is initialized for each i. No, the Java code's st array is declared once, so nodes processed in previous iterations are marked. So in the C code, the st array must be declared once, and not reset.\n\nThus, the C code's st array is global or declared in main and not reset.\n\nNow, the helper function to reverse a string:\n\nvoid reverse_str(char *str) {\n\n    int len = strlen(str);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {\n\n        char temp = str[i];\n\n        str[i] = str[len - 1 - i];\n\n        str[len - 1 - i] = temp;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this reverses the entire string.\n\nNow, code for handling the buffer:\n\nFor the path starting at i:\n\ntemp_buffer starts empty.\n\nAppend \" \" followed by the reversed string of i.\n\nThen for each x in the path:\n\nAppend \" \" followed by the reversed string of x.\n\nThen, reverse the entire temp_buffer.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nchar temp_buffer[1000000] = \"\"; // size must be large enough.\n\nsprintf(num_str, \"%d\", i);\n\nreverse_str(num_str);\n\nstrcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\nstrcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\nThen, for x:\n\nsprintf(num_str, \"%d\", x);\n\nreverse_str(num_str);\n\nstrcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\nstrcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\nAfter processing all x's:\n\nreverse_str(temp_buffer);\n\nThen, compare s with ans.\n\nNow, the code for the path:\n\nBut in the Java code, the code starts with i, then x = b[i], and so on. So in C, the code should do the same.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut there's a problem: when building the temp_buffer, the first part is \" \" followed by the reversed i. Then, for each x, append \" \" followed by reversed x. So the temp_buffer starts with a space.\n\nWhen reversed, the entire buffer will have the last character first. For example, the buffer is \" 21 43\", which reversed becomes \"34 12 \".\n\nBut the leading space becomes a trailing space. So when printed, the path will start with a space. For example, the output for ans=2 and path 1 2 would be \" 2 1\" (reversed buffer is \"1 2 \").\n\nBut the Java code's output prints the reversed buffer, which may include leading and trailing spaces. For example, if the buffer after reversal is \"1 2 \", the output is \"1 2 \".\n\nBut in Codeforces, trailing spaces may be considered incorrect. So perhaps the original Java code has a mistake here, but again, we have to replicate it.\n\nThus, the C code will print the reversed buffer as is.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSample code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\n#define MAX_N 100000\n\nint a[MAX_N + 1], b[MAX_N + 1];\nint num[MAX_N + 1];\nint st[MAX_N + 1];\n\nvoid reverse_str(char *str) {\n    int len = strlen(str);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {\n        char temp = str[i];\n        str[i] = str[len - 1 - i];\n        str[len - 1 - i] = temp;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &b[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Compute num array\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        num[b[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int ans = 0;\n    char ss[1000000] = \"\"; // Adjust size as needed\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] == 1 && !st[i]) {\n            st[i] = 1;\n\n            char temp_buffer[1000000] = \"\";\n            char num_str[20];\n\n            sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", i);\n            reverse_str(num_str);\n            strcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\n            strcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n\n            int s = 1;\n            int x = b[i];\n\n            while (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x] == 1 && a[x] != 1) {\n                st[x] = 1;\n                sprintf(num_str, \"%d\", x);\n                reverse_str(num_str);\n                strcat(temp_buffer, \" \");\n                strcat(temp_buffer, num_str);\n                x = b[x];\n                s++;\n            }\n\n            reverse_str(temp_buffer);\n\n            if (s > ans || (s == ans && strcmp(temp_buffer, ss) < 0)) {\n                ans = s;\n                strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    if (ans > 0) {\n        // Trim leading space if necessary\n        // The Java code may print leading space, but let's check.\n        // In Java, the reversed buffer may have leading space.\n        // For example, the buffer after reversing is \"1 2 \".\n        // So the code prints as is.\n\n        // But in the Java code, the first append is \" \" + reversed i, so the buffer starts with a space.\n        // After reversing, the first character is the reversed i's last character.\n\n        // For example, i=1: reversed is \"1\", buffer is \" 1\".\n        // Reversed buffer is \"1 \".\n        // So the output is \"1 \".\n\n        // But the problem may require no leading space. So perhaps in the code, the buffer after reversing starts with the first node's reversed string's first character.\n\n        // However, the Java code does not trim, so neither should the C code.\n\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", ss);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the buffer after reversing may have leading or trailing spaces. For example, in the case where the path has only one node, the buffer after building is \" 1\", reversed to \"1 \".\n\nSo the code outputs \"1 \".\n\nBut in the problem statement, perhaps the expected output is just \"1\" without the trailing space. But the original Java code may have a bug here. However, since we're translating the code as is, we must replicate it.\n\nThus, the C code prints the buffer as is.\n\nBut in the code above, after reversing, the buffer may have leading and trailing spaces. For example, if the path is i=1, x=2, then the buffer after building is \" 1 2\". Reversed, it becomes \"2 1 \".\n\nSo the output is \"2 1 \".\n\nBut the correct path is 1 \u21922. So the code's output is reversed. But this is how the Java code works.\n\nThus, the code is translated as is.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The buffer size: in C, we need to allocate a large enough buffer to avoid overflow. For example, if the path is up to 1e5 nodes, each node's string could be up to 10 digits (for large numbers), so per node, up to 11 characters (space plus 10 digits). For 1e5 nodes, this would be 1e6 characters. So the buffer should be sized accordingly.\n\nIn the code above, temp_buffer is declared as 1e6 characters, which should be sufficient.\n\nAnother possible issue is that in the Java code, the path is built only if a[i] is 1. So in the C code, we check if a[i] is 1 and st[i] is 0.\n\nThe code also checks x !=0. What if b[i] is 0? The Java code has x !=0 in the loop condition. So in C, we must check x !=0.\n\nThe code for the loop:\n\nwhile (x != 0 && !st[x] && num[x] == 1 && a[x] != 1) {\n\nIn the Java code, the conditions are:\n\nwhile (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x !=0 && a[x] !=1) {\n\nSo in C, the conditions are x !=0, st[x] ==0, num[x] ==1, a[x] !=1.\n\nThus, the code in C has the same conditions.\n\nFinally, in the Java code, after building the path, the code compares the current s with ans. If s is larger, updates ans and ss. If s is equal, replaces ss with the current path. However, the Java code may overwrite ss with the last path of maximum length encountered. So in C, when s equals ans, we should replace ss only if the current path is lexicographically smaller, or we just replace it unconditionally. But according to the Java code, if multiple paths have the same maximum length, the last one encountered is kept. Because in the Java code, whenever s >= ans, it updates ans and ss. So in the code, if s is equal to ans, it overwrites.\n\nThus, in C, the code should update ss whenever s >= ans. But the code above uses:\n\nif (s > ans || (s == ans && strcmp(temp_buffer, ss) < 0)) { ... }\n\nBut this is not exactly the same as the Java code. The Java code would overwrite ss even if s == ans, regardless of the lex order.\n\nThus, in the Java code, if two paths have the same length, the last one encountered is the one kept. So in C, the code should do the same.\n\nThus, the condition should be:\n\nif (s > ans) {\n\n   ans = s;\n\n   strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n} else if (s == ans) {\n\n   // compare lex order?\n\n   // Java code does not compare lex order, just replaces.\n\n   strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n}\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, whenever s >= ans, the code replaces ans and ss.\n\nBecause in the Java code:\n\nif (s > ans) {\n\n   ans = s;\n\n   ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n\n}\n\nSo if s is equal to ans, the code does not update. So the code only updates when s is larger. Thus, the code in C should only update ss when s is larger than ans.\n\nWait, let's recheck the Java code:\n\nIn the loop over i:\n\nfor each i:\n\n   process path, compute s.\n\n   if (s > ans) {\n\n      ans = s;\n\n      ss = ...;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThus, the Java code updates ss only when s is larger than ans. If s is equal to ans, it does not update. Thus, the first path with maximum length is kept. So in the C code, the condition should be:\n\nif (s > ans) {\n\n   ans = s;\n\n   strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n}\n\nThus, the code in C must only update ss when s is greater than ans. Otherwise, even if s equals ans, it does not update. Thus, the first path with maximum length is retained.\n\nThis is a critical mistake in the earlier C code draft. So the correct code should update ss only when s is larger than ans.\n\nThus, the code's condition is:\n\nif (s > ans) {\n\n   ans = s;\n\n   strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n}\n\nThus, the C code must only update ss when a longer path is found.\n\nThus, the corrected code:\n\nIn the C code's loop:\n\nif (s > ans) {\n\n   ans = s;\n\n   strcpy(ss, temp_buffer);\n\n}\n\nThis matches the Java code's logic.\n\nThus, the final C code will have this condition.\n\nNow, after addressing all these points, the C code should correctly replicate the Java code's behavior."
