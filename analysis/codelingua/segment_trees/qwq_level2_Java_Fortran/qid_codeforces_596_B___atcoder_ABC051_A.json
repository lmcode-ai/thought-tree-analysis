    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_596_B) reads an integer n, then an array of n long integers. It calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, starting with the absolute value of the first element. So the total is |arr[0]| + |arr[1]-arr[0]| + ... + |arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]|. The output is this sum.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC051_A) takes a string input, replaces any commas with spaces, and outputs that string. Wait, but how does the output of the first program become the input of the second? The first program outputs a number, which is then the input for the second. But the second expects a string, so the number from the first is treated as a string, and commas in it are replaced with spaces. Wait, but numbers don't usually have commas unless they are written with commas as thousand separators. Hmm, but the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program, which treats it as a string and replaces commas with spaces. So the final output is that modified string.\n\nSo the entire sequence is: take input for first program (n and array), compute the sum, then that sum is the input to the second program, which replaces commas in it with spaces, and outputs that string.\n\nNow, to combine this into a single Fortran program. The key is to process the first part's computation, then pass the result to the second part's processing without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read the input (n and array) from stdin. Then compute the sum as in the first Java program. Then, take that sum, convert it to a string, replace any commas with spaces, and print that string.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string. The first program's output is a number, which when printed, is a string representation. So the second program's input is that string. So in Fortran, after computing the sum, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string by replacing commas with spaces, then output that.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the array from input.\n2. Compute the sum as per first Java program.\n3. Convert the sum to a string.\n4. Replace any commas in that string with spaces.\n5. Print the modified string.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the array elements are read as integers (long in Java). The sum is a long. So in Fortran, the array can be an array of integers (but since Java uses long, maybe in Fortran we can use integer*8 or similar for 64-bit, but perhaps the problem's constraints don't require that. Let me check the problem's constraints. Well, the original code uses long, so in Fortran, perhaps using integer(8) would be better to handle large numbers. But maybe the problem's input doesn't have numbers that big. Anyway, the code should handle it as per the original.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n, then the array. Then compute the sum as:\n\nsum = abs(arr(1)) + sum_{i=2 to n} abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n\nThen, convert that sum to a string. Then replace commas with spaces. Then print that string.\n\nNow, how to do each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The first line is n, then the next line has n integers. Wait, in the first Java program, the input is read as nextInt() each time. So the input is all on one line? Let me see the first Java code:\n\nIn codeforces_596_B, the code reads n with scan.nextInt(), then reads n numbers in a loop with scan.nextInt(). So the input is given as first the n, then the array elements, all on the same line, or possibly multiple lines? The Scanner in Java reads tokens, so as long as they are space-separated, it doesn't matter. So in Fortran, the input would be read as first reading n, then reading n integers from the same input stream.\n\nIn Fortran, to read n and then the array, perhaps:\n\nRead *, n\nRead *, (arr(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is properly formatted. Assuming that the input is given as first the integer n, followed by the array elements on the same line or subsequent lines, but in Fortran, the read statement will read until it gets n numbers for the array.\n\nNext, compute the sum. The first term is abs(arr(1)), then for each i from 2 to n, add abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1)). So in code:\n\nsum = abs(arr(1))\ndo i = 2, n\n   sum = sum + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\nend do\n\nThen, convert sum to a string. In Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str\nwrite(sum_str, '(I0)') sum\n\nBut need to make sure that the length is sufficient. Alternatively, use a larger length.\n\nThen, replace commas in sum_str with spaces. Wait, but in Fortran, how to do string replacement? Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's think.\n\nThe second Java program's code is taking the input string (the output of the first program, which is the sum as a string), and replacing any commas with spaces. So in Fortran, after converting the sum to a string, we need to loop through each character and replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function replace.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003 and later, there is the 'replace' function. But if the code needs to be compatible with older versions, perhaps not. Alternatively, we can loop through each character.\n\nLet me see. Let's say sum_str is the string. We can create a new string, say result_str, and loop through each character in sum_str. For each character, if it is a comma, append a space to result_str, else append the character.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nresult_str = adjustl(sum_str)  ! Not sure, but perhaps better to process each character.\n\nWait, here's a way:\n\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str, temp_str\ntemp_str = ''\ndo i = 1, len_trim(sum_str)\n   if (sum_str(i:i) == ',') then\n      temp_str = trim(temp_str) // ' '\n   else\n      temp_str = trim(temp_str) // sum_str(i:i)\n   end if\nend do\nresult_str = trim(temp_str)\n\nWait, but using trim might not be necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nresult_str = sum_str\ndo i = 1, len_trim(result_str)\n   if (result_str(i:i) == ',') then\n      result_str(i:i) = ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so leading and trailing spaces may be present. However, when we write the sum_str using '(I0)', it should have no leading spaces, but the length is fixed. So perhaps the first approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, using the Fortran intrinsic function:\n\nresult_str = replace(sum_str, ',', ' ')\n\nBut I think that's available in Fortran 2003. Let me check. The 'replace' function is part of the Fortran 2003 standard. If the user expects the code to be compatible with older versions, perhaps not. But assuming that's okay, then that's the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'transcode' or other methods, but perhaps the loop is safer.\n\nAlternatively, here's code for the replacement:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str, modified_str\ninteger :: i, len_sum\nsum_str = ''\nwrite(sum_str, '(I0)') sum\nlen_sum = len_trim(sum_str)\nmodified_str = sum_str\ndo i = 1, len_sum\n   if (modified_str(i:i) == ',') then\n      modified_str(i:i) = ' '\n   end if\nend do\nprint *, trim(modified_str)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with '(I0)', the number is written without leading spaces, but the variable may have trailing spaces. So len_trim gives the actual length of the string. So the loop from 1 to len_sum would process each character of the actual string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with an edit descriptor like '(I0)', the number is written as a string without leading spaces, but the rest of the characters in the variable are spaces. So the actual content is from 1 to len_trim(sum_str). So the loop from 1 to len_trim(sum_str) is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, modified_str is initialized as sum_str, which has the same length. So the loop can go up to len_trim(sum_str).\n\nWait, but in the code, the modified_str is the same as sum_str, so the loop can process each character up to the length of the trimmed string.\n\nSo after replacing commas with spaces, the modified_str will have the desired string, and then we can print it, trimming any trailing spaces (since the original sum_str may have trailing spaces beyond the actual digits, but after replacement, the modified_str's trailing spaces are still there, but when printed with print *, it will automatically trim them).\n\nWait, the print statement in Fortran with * will automatically trim trailing spaces. So the final print statement can be:\n\nprint *, trim(modified_str)\n\nWait, but maybe the modified_str has leading or trailing spaces? Let me think. The original sum_str is written with '(I0)', so the number is written without leading spaces, but the rest of the characters in the variable are spaces. So the actual content is from 1 to len_trim(sum_str). The replacement loop only processes up to that length. So the modified_str's first len_trim(sum_str) characters are the modified string, and the rest are spaces. So when we print it with print *, trim(modified_str), the trim would remove trailing spaces. Alternatively, just print *, modified_str would automatically do that.\n\nWait, the print *, statement in Fortran will output the string, trimming any trailing spaces. So even if the modified_str has trailing spaces, the print statement will not show them. So perhaps the code can be:\n\nprint *, modified_str\n\nBut to be safe, maybe use trim.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nThe array in Fortran needs to be an array of integers. Since Java uses long, which is 64-bit, in Fortran, perhaps using integer(8) to match. But if the problem's constraints don't require that, maybe integer is sufficient. Let's assume that the numbers can be large, so use integer(8).\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger(8) :: sum, arr(100000)  ! Assuming maximum n is up to 1e5, but better to read n first. Wait, but in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with a fixed size. Hmm, problem here.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the array size is n, which is read first. In Fortran, we can't have an array with a size determined at runtime unless we use allocatable arrays.\n\nAh right, so in Fortran, we can declare an array as allocatable. So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nRead n first, then allocate arr(n).\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate arr(n).\n\nRead the array elements.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nThen process the string.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, len_sum\ninteger(8) :: sum\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str, modified_str\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n! Read input\nread *, n\nallocate(arr(n))\nread *, (arr(i), i=1,n)\n\n! Compute the sum\nsum = abs(arr(1))\ndo i = 2, n\n   sum = sum + abs(arr(i) - arr(i-1))\nend do\n\n! Convert sum to string\nwrite(sum_str, '(I0)') sum\nlen_sum = len_trim(sum_str)\n\n! Replace commas with spaces\nmodified_str = sum_str\ndo i = 1, len_sum\n   if (modified_str(i:i) == ',') then\n      modified_str(i:i) = ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Output the modified string\nprint *, trim(modified_str)\n\ndeallocate(arr)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with '(I0)', the number is written as a string without commas. Wait, does Fortran's I0 format include commas? No, I think the Iw format does not include commas. For example, writing 12345678 as I0 would be '12345678', not '12,345,678'. So the original Java second program's input would not have commas unless the first program's output has commas, but in Fortran, the sum is written without commas. So in this case, the replacement would do nothing. But the problem's second Java program is designed to replace commas with spaces, so perhaps the first program's output could have commas? Wait, in the first Java program, the code uses Math.abs(arr[0]), which is a long. When printed with System.out.println(answer), the number is printed as a string without commas. So the second program's input would not have any commas, so the output would be the same as the sum. But perhaps the problem expects that the second program is processing the first's output, which may have commas if the number is written with them. But in Java, the default printing of a long doesn't include commas. So maybe the second program is designed for cases where the input has commas, but in this specific case, the first program's output has no commas, so the second program's output is the same as the first's output. But the code must still perform the replacement.\n\nWait, but the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So even if the first program's output has no commas, the second program's code would process it, replacing commas with spaces. So in the Fortran code, even if the sum_str has no commas, the code must still do the replacement (though it would have no effect).\n\nTherefore, the code above is correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement with '(I0)' will not include commas. So the modified_str will be the same as sum_str. But the code still does the replacement, which is correct.\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the array allocation. The code reads n, then allocates arr(n). Then reads the array elements. That should be okay.\n\nSecond, the sum is computed correctly. The first term is abs(arr(1)), then adding the differences between consecutive elements. That's correct.\n\nThird, converting the sum to a string. The '(I0)' format writes the integer as a string without leading spaces. The length of sum_str is 20, which should be sufficient for a 64-bit integer (max value around 9e18, which is 19 digits). So 20 is enough.\n\nThe replacement loop: loops through each character in the string up to the length of the trimmed string. Replaces commas with spaces. That's correct.\n\nFinally, print the modified_str, trimming any trailing spaces (though the original sum_str's length may be 20, but the actual content is shorter, so the print statement will output correctly).\n\nAnother possible issue: the array elements are read as integer(8). The input in Java is read as long (64-bit), so in Fortran, using integer(8) is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: n=1. Then the sum is abs(arr[0]). Then the string is that number, no commas, so output is same as the number.\n\nTest case 2: n=3, arr = [1,3,5]. The sum is 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Output is \"5\".\n\nAnother test case where the sum has a comma? Like if the sum is 1,000 (but in Java, the first program would output 1000, so no comma. So the second program would output \"1000\".\n\nWait, but in some locales, numbers are printed with commas, but Java's System.out.println for a long doesn't do that. So the first program's output is a number without commas, so the second program's output is same as the first's output. So the Fortran code will also output the same.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the modified_str is declared as length 20. If the sum is very large (like 1e18), it would be 19 digits, so 20 is enough. But if the sum is even bigger? Well, 64-bit integer can go up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 which is 19 digits. So 20 is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code should work."
