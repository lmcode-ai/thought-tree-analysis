So in the Fortran code, after processing all i up to the original sqrt(n), we need to check if n>1, and if so, add 1 to the answer.

So the code's final check is equivalent to processing that remaining prime's exponent (1) by adding 1 to the answer. So in the Fortran code, after the loop over i, we need to do:\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    count =1\n\n    j=1\n\n    do while (count -j >=0) answer = answer +1\n\n        count = count -j\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, it's just adding 1. Wait, no, in the Java code, the code for the final check is:\n\nif (n>1) answer++; So that's adding 1. But according to the logic above, the remaining prime's exponent is 1, so the j loop would add 1 (since k=1). So the code's final check is equivalent to that. So why does the Java code just add 1 instead of processing the j loop?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC169_D) takes a long integer n from input. It calculates the square root of n, then iterates from 2 to that square root. For each i, it counts how many times i divides n, then uses a loop to add to the answer based on the count. Finally, if there's any remaining n (greater than 1), it adds one more to the answer. The output is the answer.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string of characters, which can include '?', and computes some DP array modulo 1e9+7. The DP tracks the remainder mod 13 as digits are processed from right to left. The final output is the count of numbers ending with remainder 5 mod 13.\n\nThe key is to chain these two programs so that the output of the first becomes the input of the second. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in between. So the first program's output (the answer from the first Java code) must be passed as input to the second program's processing. Wait, but the second Java program's input is a string, not a number. Wait, looking back: the second Java program's input is a string (from sc.next()), so the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence here. Wait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. But the second Java program expects a string (since it uses sc.next().toCharArray()), so the first program's output (a number) must be converted to a string and passed as input to the second. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the answer, then that answer is used as the input string for the second part (the second Java program's processing). \n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first Java program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second Java program. But the second Java program reads a string (the input is a string, like \"1234\" or something with '?'). So the first program's output is a number, which is then converted to a string and passed as input to the second program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part must compute the answer (the first program's output), then that answer is converted to a string, and then the second part processes that string as input. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input (the original input to the first Java program), compute the first part's answer, then pass that answer as a string to the second part's processing, and finally output the result of the second part.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the long n for the first program).\n2. Compute the first part's answer (the answer variable from the first Java code).\n3. Convert that answer to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n4. Process that string through the second part's logic (the DP calculations).\n5. Output the final result from the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first program's main steps are:\n\n- Read n as a long.\n- Compute sqrt(n) as integer.\n- Initialize answer to 0.\n- For i from 2 to sqrt(n):\n   - count how many times i divides n (loop dividing n by i until it's not divisible)\n   - Then, for j from 1 upwards until count - j <0, add 1 to answer each time. Wait, the loop is for j=1 to ... such that count -j >=0. The loop is for j in 1,2,... until count -j is non-negative. The loop is structured as for (int j=1; count-j >=0; j++) { count -=j; answer++; }\n\nWait, let me see the code again:\n\nfor (int j = 1; count - j >= 0; j++) {\n    count -= j;\n    answer++;\n}\n\nWait, the loop condition is count - j >=0. So j starts at 1, then increments by 1 each time. Let's see:\n\nSuppose count is 3:\n\nFirst iteration: j=1, 3-1=2 >=0 \u2192 yes. count becomes 2, answer increases by 1.\n\nSecond iteration: j=2 \u2192 2-2=0 \u2192 yes. count becomes 0, answer increases again.\n\nThird iteration: j=3 \u2192 0-3 = -3 <0 \u2192 loop stops. So total 2 increments.\n\nWait, but the loop runs as long as count - j >=0. Wait, the condition is checked before each iteration. Let me see:\n\nInitial j=1: check 3-1 >=0 \u2192 yes. Then after the loop body, j increments to 2.\n\nNext iteration: check 2 (current count) -2 (j=2) \u2192 0 \u2192 yes. So loop runs again. After, j becomes 3.\n\nNext check: count is 0, j=3 \u2192 0-3 =-3 <0 \u2192 loop stops. So total 2 increments.\n\nWait, so the loop runs for j=1 and j=2, adding 2 to the answer. So the total added is the maximum k where 1+2+...+k \u2264 count. Because the sum of 1+2+...+k = k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. The number of terms is the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. The answer increases by k.\n\nWait, the loop is adding 1 for each j step. So the total number of times the loop runs is the maximum k where the sum 1+2+...+k \u2264 count. Because each step j adds 1 to the answer, and the total steps are the number of j's taken. So the loop runs until j exceeds the remaining count. So the total steps is the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. So the number of steps is the floor of (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, the loop is equivalent to finding the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count. The number of steps is k. So the code's loop is effectively calculating that k and adding it to the answer.\n\nBut in code, the loop is implemented as:\n\ncount starts at the exponent of i in n's prime factorization.\n\nThen, for each j starting at 1, subtract j from count, and increment answer each time until count -j becomes negative.\n\nSo the total added to answer is the number of j's taken, which is the maximum k where 1+2+...+k \u2264 original count.\n\nSo the code's first part can be translated into Fortran.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables:\n\nWe need to read n as a long (in Java). In Fortran, integers can be 8-byte (selected_int_kind(18)), so using integer(8) for n.\n\nThe sqrt(n) can be computed as integer(sqrt(real(n))).\n\nThe loop over i from 2 to sqrt(n). For each i:\n\n- count is initialized to 0.\n\n- while n mod i ==0, divide n by i and increment count.\n\nThen, compute the number of steps in the j loop. Let me see how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, the loop can be rewritten as:\n\nk = 0\n\nwhile (count >= (k+1)*(k+2)/2 - (k*(k+1)/2)) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count.\n\nThe maximum k is floor( (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2 )\n\nSo for example, if count is 3, sqrt(25) is 5 \u2192 (5-1)/2 = 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nIf count is 6 \u2192 sqrt(49)=7 \u2192 (7-1)/2=3 \u2192 3*4/2=6 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the number of steps is k = floor( (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the code can be optimized by replacing the j loop with this formula.\n\nThis would make the code more efficient, but since the original code uses a loop, perhaps in Fortran it's better to replicate the loop as is, unless it's too slow. But since the problem is likely small (since it's a programming competition problem), the loop is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the loop can be implemented as:\n\ncount = ... (the exponent)\n\nj = 1\n\ndo while (count - j >=0)\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\n    count = count -j\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop condition is checked before each iteration. So the code would be:\n\nj = 1\n\ndo\n\n    if (count - j <0) exit\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\n    count = count -j\n\n    j = j +1\n\nloop\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop can be written with a do-while structure using a loop control variable. Alternatively, using a do loop with a condition.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nj = 1\n\ndo while (count - j >=0)\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\n    count = count - j\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but after subtracting j, the next iteration's j is increased by 1. Let me see with count=3:\n\nFirst iteration: j=1 \u2192 3-1=2 >=0 \u2192 yes. answer +=1 (now 1). count becomes 2, j becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration: j=2 \u2192 2-2=0 \u2192 yes. answer +=1 (now 2). count becomes 0, j becomes 3.\n\nThird iteration: j=3 \u2192 0-3 =-3 <0 \u2192 exit. So total 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, that works. So the loop can be written as such.\n\nSo in Fortran code for the first part:\n\nRead n as integer(8).\n\nCompute sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n,8)))\n\nanswer =0\n\ndo i=2, sqrt_n\n\n    count =0\n\n    temp = n\n\n    ! divide by i as much as possible\n\n    do while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n        temp = temp / i\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, process the count\n\n    if (count >0) then\n\n        j=1\n\n        do while (count -j >=0)\n\n            answer = answer +1\n\n            count = count -j\n\n            j = j +1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Update n (since we divided it by i^count)\n\n    n = temp\n\nend do\n\n! After loop, check if n>1 (remaining prime factor)\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    ! process the remaining n (which is a prime > sqrt(original n))\n\n    count =1\n\n    j=1\n\n    do while (count -j >=0)\n\n        answer = answer +1\n\n        count = count -j\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the original code's n is being modified in the first loop. Wait in the Java code, after dividing n by i each time, so the n is updated. So in the Fortran code, after dividing temp (which is a copy of n) by i until it can't be divided, then the count is the exponent. Then, the original n is set to temp (the remaining part after division). So that's correct.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the original n is being modified. So in the Fortran code, the variable n is being updated as temp after each i's processing. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after the inner loop (dividing temp by i), the count is the exponent. Then, the code processes the count, and then sets n = temp. So that's correct.\n\nThen, after the loop over i, if n>1, then that remaining n is a prime factor larger than sqrt(original n). So its exponent is 1. So the code adds the steps for count=1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop over i, if n>1, then it adds 1 to the answer. Wait, no, in the Java code, the code says:\n\nif (n >1) {\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, in the Java code, after processing all i up to sqrt(n), if there's any remaining n (which must be a prime factor larger than sqrt(original n)), then the code adds 1 to the answer. But why?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code's first part:\n\nThe code for the first Java program:\n\nAfter the for loop over i from 2 to sqrt, the code checks if n>1. Then adds 1 to the answer.\n\nWait, but in the code, the n is being divided by i each time. So the remaining n after the loop is the remaining part after all factors up to sqrt(n) have been divided out. So if n>1 at that point, it must be a prime factor larger than sqrt(original n), with exponent 1. So the code is handling that case by adding 1 to the answer. But why?\n\nWait, the code's logic for the remaining n>1 is to add 1 to the answer. But according to the earlier processing, the code for exponents would have been handled in the loop. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code's first part:\n\nThe code for the first Java program:\n\nThe loop over i from 2 to sqrt(n) (the initial sqrt is of the original n, but n is being modified in the loop). Wait, no, the sqrt is computed once at the start. Wait, the code:\n\nint sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);\n\nThen the loop runs i from 2 to sqrt. But during the loop, n is being divided by i, so the actual n is changing. However, the sqrt is computed once at the beginning. So the loop runs up to the original sqrt(n), not the current n's sqrt. That's a possible error in the code?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because as n is divided by i, the actual sqrt(n) decreases, but the loop is only going up to the original sqrt. So for example, if n was 100, sqrt is 10. Suppose after processing i=2, n becomes 25. The loop continues up to i=10, but sqrt(25) is 5, so the loop would process up to 10, but the remaining factors (like 5) would be processed when i=5. But since the loop is up to the original sqrt (10), that's okay. Wait, but in the code, the loop is up to the original sqrt, not the current n's sqrt. So perhaps that's correct because any remaining factors larger than the original sqrt would have to be primes, but their exponents would be 1. So the code's final check for n>1 is to account for that.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each i from 2 to original sqrt(n), process all exponents of i in n. Then, after that, if there's any remaining n (which must be a prime greater than the original sqrt(n)), then that's an exponent of 1, so the code adds 1 to the answer.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose n is 121 (11^2). The original sqrt(n) is 11. So the loop runs i from 2 to 11. When i=11, the count would be 2 (since 121 /11 is 11, then divided again by 11 gives 1). So the count is 2. Then, the j loop would process that count.\n\nThe j loop for count=2:\n\nj starts at 1. count -1 =1 >=0 \u2192 yes. answer increases by 1. count becomes 1, j becomes 2.\n\nNext iteration: j=2 \u2192 1-2 =-1 <0 \u2192 exit. So total 1 added. So the total for i=11 is 1. Then, after processing, n becomes 1, so the final check (n>1) is false. So the total answer is 1. But 11^2's exponent is 2. The code's processing for i=11 would have count=2, and the j loop would add 1 (since 1+2=3>2, so the maximum k is 1 (1*2/2=1 \u22642). Wait, the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22642 is k=1 (1*2/2=1 \u22642, but 2*3/2=3>2). So the j loop would run once (k=1), so adding 1. So the total answer would be 1. But what is the correct answer?\n\nWait, the problem's first Java code is for problem ABC169_D. Let me think what the problem is. The problem is probably to find the number of exponents in the prime factorization that can form a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1. For example, for exponent e, the maximum number of terms in a sequence 1+2+...+k \u2264e. So for e=2, the maximum k is 1 (since 1+2=3>2). So the answer for exponent 2 is 1. So the code's calculation is correct.\n\nBut in the case of n=121, the code would process i=11 (count=2), adding 1, and then n becomes 1, so the final check adds nothing. So the total answer is 1. But what is the correct answer for n=121?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the number of ways to represent the exponents as sums of consecutive integers starting from 1. For example, for exponent e, the number of ways is the number of k such that k(k+1)/2 \u2264e. Each such k contributes 1 to the answer. So for e=2, the possible k is 1 (since 1*2/2=1 \u22642, and 2*3/2=3>2). So the count is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, back to the code's final check. Suppose n is a prime number, say 13. The original sqrt is 3 (since sqrt(13) is ~3.605, cast to int 3). The loop runs i from 2 to 3. For i=2, n mod 2 is 1, so count remains 0. For i=3, same. Then, after the loop, n is still 13. The final check (n>1) is true, so answer increases by 1. So the total answer is 1. Which is correct because exponent is 1, so k=1 (1*2/2=1 \u22641 \u2192 yes). So the code's final check adds 1, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. So in the Fortran code, after processing all i up to the original sqrt(n), we need to check if n>1, and if so, add 1 to the answer. Because the remaining n is a prime with exponent 1, so the j loop for count=1 would add 1 (since k=1: 1*2/2=1 \u22641 \u2192 yes). So the code's final check is equivalent to processing that remaining prime's exponent (1) by adding 1 to the answer. So in the Fortran code, after the loop over i, we need to do:\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    count =1\n\n    j=1\n\n    do while (count -j >=0)\n\n        answer = answer +1\n\n        count = count -j\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, it's just adding 1. Wait, no, in the Java code, the code for the final check is:\n\nif (n>1) answer++;\n\nSo that's adding 1. But according to the logic above, the remaining prime's exponent is 1, so the j loop would add 1 (since k=1). So the code's final check is equivalent to that. So why does the Java code just add 1 instead of processing the j loop?\n\nAh, because in the Java code, the remaining n is a prime factor with exponent 1. So the count would be 1. The j loop for count=1 would run once (j=1: 1-1=0 >=0 \u2192 yes. So answer increases by 1, then count becomes 0, j becomes 2. The loop stops. So the total added is 1. So the code's final check is equivalent to adding 1, which is exactly what the Java code does. So in the Fortran code, the final check can be done by simply adding 1 to the answer if n>1. Because the remaining exponent is 1, so the j loop would add exactly 1. Therefore, the code can be simplified here.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the code for the remaining n>1 is:\n\nif (n>1) then\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\nend if\n\nThat would be equivalent to the Java code's approach. So that's better, avoiding the loop. Because the exponent is 1, so the j loop would add exactly 1. So the code can be optimized here.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code for the first part:\n\nAfter the loop over i, if n>1, then answer +=1.\n\nSo the code for the first part is:\n\nRead n as integer(8).\n\nsqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n)))\n\nanswer =0\n\ndo i=2, sqrt_n\n\n    count =0\n\n    temp = n\n\n    do while (mod(temp, i) ==0)\n\n        temp = temp /i\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end do\n\n    if (count >0) then\n\n        j=1\n\n        do while (count -j >=0)\n\n            answer = answer +1\n\n            count = count -j\n\n            j = j +1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    n = temp\n\nend do\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\nend if\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part (the second Java program) takes a string as input, processes it with DP, and outputs the result mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe second Java program's input is a string (from sc.next()), which is converted to a char array. The processing is as follows:\n\nThe DP array is of size [cs.length][13], initialized to 0. The base starts at 1. For each character in reverse order (since the loop is over i from 0 to cs.length-1, but the character is taken from the end), the code processes each character (either '?' or a digit). For each position, it updates the DP array based on possible digits (0-9 for '?', or the specific digit for others).\n\nThe DP[i][pre] represents the number of ways to form a number up to the i-th position (from the end) such that the current remainder mod13 is pre. The transitions are based on the current digit (or all possible digits for '?').\n\nThe base is multiplied by 10 mod13 each step. The final answer is dp[cs.length-1][5].\n\nIn Fortran, the steps are:\n\n- The input to the second part is the string representation of the first part's answer. So after computing the first part's answer, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the DP.\n\nSo in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's answer, we need to convert it to a string. Then, process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe input string is the answer from the first part. So in Fortran, after computing the answer (integer), we can write it as a string. For example, using write(*,*) answer, but capturing the output. Alternatively, in Fortran, we can convert the integer to a string using internal write.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') answer\n\ntrim(s) to remove leading spaces, but perhaps better to use adjustl.\n\nThen, the length of the string is len_trim(s).\n\nThen, the DP array is a 2D array of size (length, 13). Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the DP array is of size [cs.length][13], with indices from 0 to cs.length-1. So in Fortran, perhaps we can make the array (1 to length, 1 to 13), but need to adjust loops accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based indices in Fortran by declaring the array with lower bounds 0. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless specified. So to make it easier, perhaps use 1-based indices and adjust loops.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, for the DP array:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n    ... processing for the i-th step (from the end)\n\n}\n\nThe base starts at 1, and for each step, base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nThe first step (i=0) corresponds to the last character of the input string (since the character is taken as cs[cs.length-1 -i], so when i=0, it's the last character).\n\nIn Fortran, the string s is stored as a character array. Let's say s has length L. The characters are s(1) to s(L). The first character is the first digit of the number (if it's a number), but in the second Java program, the input is a string which can have '?', so the processing is on the entire string.\n\nWait, the second Java program's input is a string (could be like \"1234\" or \"????5\" etc.), and the code processes each character from the end. So in Fortran, the string s (from the first part's answer) is a string of digits (since the first part's answer is a number, so its string representation is digits only). So the second part's processing can proceed as per the code.\n\nNow, the DP array in Fortran:\n\nWe can declare it as a 2D array of integers (or integers with modulo 1e9+7, but in Fortran, integers can be 64-bit, so using integer(8) for the DP array elements.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be declared as:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\nallocate(dp(0: len_s-1, 0:12))\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the indices can be set to 0-based by using the lower bound. Alternatively, use 1-based and adjust loops.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with 0-based indices for the first dimension (i from 0 to L-1), and 0 to 12 for the second.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 10**9 +7\n\ninteger :: L\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\ninteger :: i, j, pre, next, base, current_char, next_digit\n\n...\n\nAfter converting the first part's answer to s, and getting L = len_trim(s).\n\nThen, allocate dp(0:L-1, 0:12)\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nbase =1\n\ndo i=0, L-1\n\n    current_char = s(L -i)  ! because in Java, the character is at position cs.length-1 -i. Since in Fortran, s(1) is first character, so for i=0, it's s(L), the last character.\n\n    if (current_char == '?') then\n\n        do pre=0,12\n\n            do next_digit=0,9\n\n                ! compute new_remainder = (base * next_digit + pre) mod13\n\n                new_remainder = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                if (i ==0) then\n\n                    ! first step (i=0), previous is 0 (pre must be 0?)\n\n                    ! Wait, in Java code, for i=0 (first iteration), the previous dp is dp[i-1][pre], but i-1 is -1. So the code uses (i>0 ? ... : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n                    ! So for i=0, the previous is pre==0 ?1 :0.\n\n                    ! So for the first step (i=0), the initial condition is that the previous count is 1 if pre was 0 (since before any digits, the remainder is 0).\n\n                    ! So for the first iteration (i=0), the contribution is 1 if pre was 0 (but since we are building dp[i][new_remainder], which is the current step.\n\n                    ! Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Let me think.\n\n                    ! The Java code's loop for i from 0 to cs.length-1:\n\n                    ! For each i, the current character is the (cs.length-1 -i)th character (i.e., starting from the end).\n\n                    ! The DP[i][...] is being computed based on DP[i-1][...] (previous step).\n\n                    ! For i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the base case is when i=0, the previous is the initial state (before any digits).\n\n                    ! The initial state is that before any digits, the remainder is 0, so for pre=0, the count is 1 (there's one way to have 0 remainder with no digits).\n\n                    ! So for i=0, when processing the first character (the last character of the input string), the transitions are based on the previous (pre) being 0, and adding the current digit.\n\n                    ! So in the code, for each pre in 0..12, and next_digit, the contribution is (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0)).\n\n                    ! So in Fortran, for each i, the current step's dp[i][new_remainder] += (previous value) mod MOD.\n\n                    ! So for the first iteration (i=0), the previous value is 1 if pre was 0, else 0.\n\n                    ! So in the loops:\n\n                    ! For each pre in 0..12:\n\n                    !   for each next_digit (0-9 for '?'):\n\n                    !       new_remainder = (base * next_digit + pre) mod13\n\n                    !       dp[i][new_remainder] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n                    !       mod MOD.\n\n                    ! So in Fortran code, for each i, we need to loop over pre and next_digit, and compute the new_remainder.\n\n                    ! To handle this, perhaps for each i, we need to make a temporary array to store the new dp values, because we can't modify dp[i][...] while reading from dp[i-1][...] in the same step.\n\n                    ! Because in the Java code, the DP array is updated in place, but since it's overwriting, perhaps in Fortran, we need to use a temporary array for the current i.\n\n                    ! Alternatively, since in the Java code, for each i, the dp[i] is computed based on dp[i-1], so we can use a temporary array for the current step.\n\n                    ! So perhaps in Fortran, we can have two arrays: previous_dp and current_dp, and alternate between them.\n\n                    ! Alternatively, since the DP is only dependent on the previous step, we can use a single array and update it in reverse order, but that might be tricky.\n\n                    ! Let me think of the approach:\n\n                    ! Initialize dp as a 2D array of size (L, 13). But for each step i, we can compute the current dp[i][...] based on dp[i-1][...].\n\n                    ! So for i=0, we can compute dp[0][...] based on the initial condition (pre=0 gives 1).\n\n                    ! So for the first step (i=0):\n\n                    ! For each pre in 0..12:\n\n                    !   if pre is not 0, then the previous count is 0.\n\n                    !   So for each next_digit (0-9):\n\n                    !       new_remainder = (base * next_digit + pre) mod13 \u2192 but pre is the previous remainder before adding this digit.\n\n                    ! Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the formula.\n\n                    ! The new_remainder is (base * next_digit + pre) mod13.\n\n                    ! Wait, the base is 10^i mod13? Let me see the Java code's base variable:\n\n                    ! The base starts at 1.\n\n                    ! For each i (from 0 to L-1):\n\n                    !   base = base *10 mod13 at the end of the loop.\n\n                    ! Wait, in the Java code:\n\n                    ! The base is updated after processing each character.\n\n                    ! The code:\n\n                    ! base = base *10 %13;\n\n                    ! So for each step i (from 0 to L-1), the base is 10^i mod13.\n\n                    ! Because initially base is 1 (10^0).\n\n                    ! After first iteration (i=0), base becomes 10^1 mod13.\n\n                    ! After second iteration (i=1), base becomes 10^2 mod13, etc.\n\n                    ! So for the i-th step (processing the (L -i)th character from the end), the base is 10^i mod13.\n\n                    ! So when processing the current digit (next_digit), the contribution to the remainder is next_digit * base + previous_remainder.\n\n                    ! Wait, the formula in the Java code is:\n\n                    ! (base * next + pre) %13.\n\n                    ! Because base is 10^i mod13, so multiplying next_digit (the current digit) by base gives the contribution of that digit to the total number mod13.\n\n                    ! So the new_remainder is (next_digit * base + pre) mod13.\n\n                    ! Wait, no, the code says:\n\n                    ! (base * next + pre) mod13.\n\n                    ! Wait, base is 10^i mod13. So next_digit * (10^i) mod13, plus previous remainder (pre) mod13.\n\n                    ! So yes, that's correct.\n\n                    ! So the new_remainder is (base * next_digit + pre) mod13.\n\n                    ! So in the code, for each next_digit, the new_remainder is computed as such.\n\n                    ! Now, for the first step (i=0):\n\n                    ! base is 1 (10^0).\n\n                    ! The previous remainder is pre (from the previous step, which is i-1 = -1 \u2192 so the initial state).\n\n                    ! The initial state is that before any digits, the remainder is 0. So for pre=0, the count is 1, else 0.\n\n                    ! So for each next_digit (0-9):\n\n                    ! new_remainder = (1 * next_digit + 0) mod13 \u2192 next_digit mod13.\n\n                    ! The contribution to dp[0][new_remainder] is 1 (since previous count is 1 for pre=0).\n\n                    ! So for each next_digit, the dp[0][new_remainder] +=1.\n\n                    ! So for i=0 and '?', the code loops over all next_digit from 0-9, and for each, adds 1 to the corresponding remainder.\n\n                    ! So for example, if next_digit is 5, then new_remainder is 5 mod13 \u2192 5. So dp[0][5] +=1.\n\n                    ! So after processing all digits, the dp[0][...] will have counts for each possible remainder after the first character.\n\n                    ! Now, in Fortran, to implement this, perhaps the best way is to have a temporary array for the current step's dp values, and then copy it to the next step.\n\n                    ! Alternatively, since the DP is only dependent on the previous step, we can use a single array and update it in a way that doesn't overwrite the previous values until all calculations are done.\n\n                    ! Let me think of the following approach:\n\n                    ! Initialize dp as a 2D array of size (L, 13). But for each step i, we can compute the current dp[i][...] based on dp[i-1][...].\n\n                    ! So for i=0:\n\n                    !   Initialize current_dp as all zeros.\n\n                    !   For each pre in 0..12:\n\n                    !       if pre is not 0, then previous count is 0.\n\n                    !       So only pre=0 contributes.\n\n                    !       So for each next_digit (0-9):\n\n                    !           new_remainder = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n\n                    !           current_dp(new_remainder) += 1 (since previous count is 1 for pre=0)\n\n                    !   Then, set dp(0,:) = current_dp.\n\n                    ! For i>0:\n\n                    !   current_dp is initialized to 0.\n\n                    !   For each pre in 0..12:\n\n                    !       prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                    !       if prev_count ==0, skip.\n\n                    !       for each next_digit (0-9 or the specific digit):\n\n                    !           new_remainder = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n\n                    !           current_dp(new_remainder) = current_dp(new_remainder) + prev_count\n\n                    !           mod MOD.\n\n                    !   Then, set dp(i,:) = current_dp mod MOD.\n\n                    ! But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so need to adjust indices.\n\n                    ! Alternatively, use 0-based indices by declaring the arrays with lower bounds 0.\n\n                    ! Let me try to write this in code.\n\n                    !

Using adjustl(s) ensures that leading spaces are removed, so the actual length is correct.\n\nSecond, in the loop over i in the second part, the current_char is taken as s(L -i: L -i). Since in Fortran, strings are 1-based, so for i=0, L-i is L \u2192 the last character. For i=1, it's L-1 \u2192 second last, etc. That's correct.\n\nThird, in the case of the character being '?', the code loops over next_digit from 0 to9, and for each, adds the contribution. The temp_dp is initialized to zero each time, and then for each pre and next_digit, the contributions are accumulated.\n\nFourth, the base is updated after each step as base = mod(base *10,13). This is correct.\n\nFifth, the final output is dp(L-1,5), which is the last row (i=L-1) and column 5 (since 0-based).\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The DP array is declared as (0:L-1, 0:12). So when L is the length of the string, the indices are correct.\n\n- The modulo operation in Fortran: mod(a,b) returns a result with the same sign as a. But since base and next_digit are non-negative, and pre is between 0-12, the new_remainder will be between 0-12, so mod is okay.\n\n- The use of integer(8) for the DP array is necessary because the counts can be up to 1e9+7, which fits in 64-bit integers.\n\n- The code uses allocate and deallocate for the DP array, which is necessary for variable-length arrays.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: first part's answer is 5 (so the string is \"5\").\n\nThen, the second part processes \"5\".\n\nThe DP steps:\n\nL=1.\n\ni=0 (processing the first and only character, which is '5').\n\nbase is 1 (10^0).\n\ncurrent_char is '5', so next_digit=5.\n\ntemp_dp is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over pre from 0 to12:\n\nFor each pre:\n\nprev_count is 1 if pre==0 (since i=0).\n\nnew_remainder = (1 *5 + pre) mod13.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nnew_remainder =5 mod13 \u21925 \u2192 temp_dp(5) +=1.\n\nFor other pre's, prev_count is 0 except when pre=0.\n\nThus, after processing, temp_dp(5) is 1, others 0.\n\nSo dp(0,5)=1.\n\nThe final answer is 1.\n\nBut what is the expected result?\n\nThe second program's input is \"5\". The problem is to count the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the number mod13 is 5. Since there are no '?', the only number is 5. 5 mod13 is 5 \u2192 so the answer is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: first part's answer is 13 \u2192 string \"13\".\n\nSecond part processes \"13\".\n\nThe string length is 2.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: character '3' (since L=2, L-i=2 \u2192 first character is '1', but wait, no:\n\nWait, the string is \"13\", so s(1) is '1', s(2) is '3'.\n\nFor i=0:\n\ncurrent_char is s(L -i) \u2192 L=2, L-0=2 \u2192 s(2) is '3'.\n\nProcessing '3' (digit 3).\n\nbase is 1 (10^0).\n\ntemp_dp is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over pre 0-12:\n\nprev_count is 1 if pre=0.\n\nnew_remainder = (1*3 + pre) mod13.\n\nFor pre=0 \u2192 new_remainder=3 \u2192 temp_dp(3) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute nothing.\n\nSo after i=0, dp(0,3)=1.\n\nThen, base becomes mod(1*10,13)=10.\n\nNext, i=1:\n\ncurrent_char is s(2-1)=s(1) \u2192 '1'.\n\nnext_digit=1.\n\nbase is 10 (10^1 mod13).\n\nProcessing:\n\nLoop over pre 0-12:\n\nprev_count is dp(0,pre).\n\nFor pre=3 \u2192 prev_count=1.\n\nOther pre's have 0.\n\nSo for pre=3:\n\nprev_count=1.\n\nnew_remainder = (10 *1 +3) mod13 \u2192 (10+3)=13 mod13 \u21920.\n\nSo temp_dp(0) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute nothing.\n\nThus, temp_dp(0) is 1.\n\nSo dp(1,0)=1.\n\nThe final answer is dp(1,5) \u2192 0.\n\nWait, but what is the actual result?\n\nThe number is 13 \u2192 13 mod13 is 0. So the answer should be 0. But the second program's output is dp[L-1][5], which is dp(1,5)=0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: first part's answer is 5 \u2192 string \"5\".\n\nSecond part's output is 1, which matches.\n\nAnother test case: first part's answer is 65 \u2192 string \"65\".\n\nThe number 65 mod13 is 0 (since 13*5=65). So the second program's output should be 0 for remainder 5? Wait, no. The second program's output is the count of numbers mod13 equal to 5. 65 mod13 is 0, so the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nThe string is \"65\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: character '5'.\n\nbase=1.\n\nprev_count for pre=0 is 1.\n\nnew_remainder =1*5 +0 mod13 \u21925 \u2192 temp_dp(5)=1.\n\ndp(0,5)=1.\n\nbase becomes 10.\n\ni=1: character '6'.\n\nnext_digit=6.\n\nbase is 10.\n\nLoop over pre:\n\nprev_count is dp(0,pre).\n\nOnly pre=5 has prev_count=1.\n\nnew_remainder =10*6 +5 mod13 \u219260+5=65 mod13 \u219265 mod13 is 0 \u2192 65/13=5 \u2192 0.\n\nSo new_remainder is 0.\n\nThus, temp_dp(0) +=1.\n\nSo dp(1,0)=1.\n\nFinal answer is dp(1,5)=0 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where the second program's input is \"????\", and the desired remainder is 5.\n\nBut in this case, the first part's answer must be a number with 4 digits, but the code would process it.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, the Fortran code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues in the code:\n\n- The declaration of MOD as an integer. Since MOD is 1e9+7, which is 1000000007, which is within the 32-bit integer range (max 2^31-1 ~2e9). So using integer for MOD is okay.\n\n- The use of integer(8) for the DP array is necessary because the values can reach up to MOD (1e9+7), which is larger than 2^31 (~2e9), so 32-bit integers would overflow. Thus, integer(8) is correct.\n\n- The loops in the second part may be slow for very long strings, but in programming competition problems, the input length is usually manageable.\n\n- The code uses allocate and deallocate for the DP array, which is necessary for variable-length arrays in Fortran.\n\n- The conversion of the first part's answer to a string using write(s, '(i0)') answer may have leading spaces if the answer is shorter than 20 characters, but adjustl(s) removes them, so len_trim(s) is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work."
