So ans is q2's first element (1). Then front_q1 becomes 2, front_q2 becomes 2. length_q1 and q2 become 2. Now q1 has elements [6,4], but stored from front=2 (so elements 2 and 3).

Now q1's elements are at positions 3 and 1 (since front is 3, length is 2: positions 3 and 1 (mod 3)). Next iteration: current_val is array_q1(3) =4 (since the array is [1,6,4] ? Wait, no.

Fourth iteration: 1 <=5 \u2192 ans=2. q1 is now empty. So the final ans is 2. Yes, so the final ans is 2. So the code's approach would need to capture that. In the Fortran code's approach, after processing the 4 (second iteration's else case), then the next iteration's current_val is 4 (from q1's front=3, which is 4). So ans is set to 3. Then the front moves to 4 mod3=1, length becomes 2-1=1 (wait, no, in the first case, when current_val is 4 (<=5), the length is 2 (from previous step's length_q1=2). So after processing, length becomes 1. Then next iteration: current_val is array_q1(1) =1 (since front is 1, length 1). So ans is set to array_q2(1)=2. Then front increments to 2, length becomes 0. So the final ans is 2. Which matches. So this approach seems to work.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_450_A) reads two integers n and m, then n more integers. It uses two queues. The process is: while the first queue isn't empty, if the front element is \u2264 m, it removes both queues' front elements and records the answer as the second queue's popped value. If the front is > m, it subtracts m from the front element, moves it to the end of the first queue, and moves the corresponding second queue element to the end as well. The answer is the last value popped from the second queue.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC172_D) takes an integer n, computes a sum based on divisors, and outputs the result. The formula seems to be summing for each i from 1 to n, the term i multiplied by (n//i) times (n//i +1)/2. Wait, actually, let me check the code again. The code does ans += i * ( (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2 ). So for each i, compute how many times i divides into n, then that term.\n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (ans) is the input n for the second program. Therefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input for the first program, process both steps, and output the second's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n and m from the first program's input, then the n numbers).\n2. Process the first part (the queue operations) to get the intermediate value (ans from first program).\n3. Use that ans as the n for the second part's computation.\n4. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (codeforces_450_A):\n\nThe first program's variables are n, m, two queues. The queues are implemented as linked lists in Java, but in Fortran, we can use arrays or linked lists. Since Fortran doesn't have built-in queues, perhaps using arrays with pointers to track the front and rear? Or maybe a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are dequeued and enqueued, perhaps using arrays with indices to track the current position. Let's think of the queues as arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe first queue (q1) starts with the n numbers. The second queue (q2) starts with 1 to n. The process loops until q1 is empty. Each iteration, check the front of q1. If <= m, pop both queues and set ans to the q2's popped value. Else, subtract m from the front element, add it back to q1, and move the q2's element to the end.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you poll, you remove the first element. So for the queues, each time you poll, you take the first element. So in Fortran, perhaps we can represent the queues as arrays with a pointer indicating the current front. Alternatively, since the queues can be large (but n is up to... well, in the first problem, n is given as input, but the problem constraints aren't specified here. Let's assume n is manageable in array size.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a loop, perhaps using a circular buffer approach. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a head and tail pointer. But maybe for simplicity, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are moved around, perhaps using a list structure with pointers. Hmm, but Fortran arrays are fixed size. So perhaps the maximum size needed is n, but in the first problem, the queues can cycle elements multiple times. Wait, but in the first problem, each time an element is processed, if it's over m, it's reduced by m and put back. So the element's value decreases each time. So eventually, it will be <= m and then removed. So the total number of operations is O(total sum of elements / m), but perhaps for the purposes of code, we can model the queues as arrays with a current size, and track the front and rear indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two arrays for the queues, and track the current size and front index. Let's see:\n\nLet me think of the queues as arrays. Let's say for the first queue (q1), we can have an array of size n, and track the front and rear indices. Similarly for q2. But since elements can be added back, the queues can grow? Wait no, the first queue's elements are being modified but the total number of elements in the queues remains n? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, q1 has n elements. Each time, when the element is over m, it's removed (counted as one element) and then added back (so the total remains the same). So the size of q1 remains n until elements are removed when they are <= m. Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nEach iteration, when the front element is <= m, it's removed from both queues. So the queues' size decreases by 1 each time that happens. When the front is > m, the element is removed (so size decreases by 1) but then added back (so size increases by 1 again). So the size of q1 remains the same until an element is removed permanently (when it's <= m). So the total number of elements in q1 can decrease over time, but each time an element is over m, it's just moved to the end. So the queues can cycle through elements until they are small enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size, and a front index. Let's see:\n\nInitialize q1 and q2 arrays of size n. The front starts at 1, and the rear at n. But when elements are dequeued and enqueued, we can track the current front and rear. Alternatively, perhaps using a circular buffer approach where the front and rear indices wrap around modulo the array size. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are dequeued from the front and enqueued to the end, perhaps we can model the queues as arrays with a current position. Let me think of the queues as arrays where the elements are stored in order, and we track the current front index. For example, for q1, the elements are stored in an array, and the front is the next element to process. When you dequeue, you take the front element and increment the front. If you need to enqueue, you put it at the end and increment the rear. But when the front exceeds the rear, we can wrap around? Or perhaps the queues are implemented as a list that can be rotated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a linked list approach in Fortran. But Fortran doesn't have pointers, so that's tricky. Maybe using arrays with indices to track the current elements. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current size and a front index. Let's see:\n\nInitialize q1 and q2 arrays of size n. The front starts at 1, and the rear at n. The size is n. When you dequeue, you take the element at front, then increment front. If you need to enqueue, you put it at rear+1 and increment rear. But when the front exceeds the rear, perhaps we can reset the front to 1 and start over? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as a list where elements are stored in a circular manner. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current size and a front index. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\nInitialize q1 and q2 arrays of size n. Read the n elements into q1. q2 is initialized with 1 to n.\n\nfront = 1\nrear = n\nsize = n\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So perhaps:\n\nWe can have two arrays, q1 and q2, each of size n. The elements are stored in order. The front is the current position to process. The rear is the next position to add. But when elements are dequeued, they are removed from the front, and enqueued to the rear. So the queues are implemented as a circular buffer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current front and rear, and when elements are dequeued, the front moves forward, and when enqueued, the rear moves forward. But when the front reaches the end, it wraps around to the start. Hmm, this might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size, and the elements are stored in a way that the front is the first element. Each time you dequeue, you take the first element and shift the array left. But that would be O(n) time, which is not efficient, but for the purposes of code translation, maybe acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the queues are implemented with LinkedList, which allows O(1) add/remove from both ends. So in Fortran, perhaps the best way is to use arrays and track the front and rear indices, and when elements are dequeued, we just track the front index, and when enqueued, we add to the end. But when the front exceeds the array size, we can wrap around. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a front and rear pointer, and the elements are stored in a circular buffer.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m, then read n integers into an array (q1_initial). The second queue (q2) is 1 to n.\n\nWe can represent the queues as arrays with front and rear pointers. Let's say for q1 and q2, each has an array of size n, and front and rear indices. Initially, front is 1, rear is n. The size is n.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays of size n, and we track the current front and rear indices. The elements are stored in the array in order. The front is the next element to process. When you dequeue, you take the element at front, then increment front. If you need to enqueue, you put the element at rear+1 and increment rear. But when rear exceeds n, perhaps we can wrap around? Or maybe the queues can grow, but since the problem's first part's queues can cycle elements, but the size remains n until elements are removed permanently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays of size n, and we track the current front and rear. The elements are stored in a circular manner. Let me think of the queues as follows:\n\nInitialize q1 array with the input values. The front starts at 1, rear at n. The size is n. The elements are stored in positions 1 to n. When you dequeue, you take the front element, then front increments. If front exceeds n, it wraps to 1. But when you enqueue, you put the element at rear+1, but if rear is at n, then rear becomes 1 again? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and front index. Let me think of the queues as arrays where the elements are stored in order, and the front is the next element to process. The rear is the end of the array. When you dequeue, you take the front element and increment front. When you enqueue, you put the element at the end (rear) and increment rear. The size is rear - front + 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as a list, and in Fortran, we can use a dynamic array approach. But Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays unless using allocatable arrays. Let me think of using allocatable arrays.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n integers into an array q1_values. The second queue q2_values is 1 to n.\n\nWe can model the queues as two arrays (q1 and q2) of size n, and track the current front and rear indices. Let's say front1 and front2 start at 1, and rear1 and rear2 start at n. The size is initially n for both queues.\n\nWait, but in the first step, when you dequeue from q1, you take the front1 element, then front1 increments. If you need to enqueue, you put it at rear1 +1, but if rear1 is at n, then perhaps we can wrap around? Or maybe the queues can be implemented as a circular buffer with size n. Let me think of the queues as circular buffers of size n. So when you dequeue, front increments modulo n. When you enqueue, rear increments modulo n. But the size can be tracked as (rear - front + n) mod n. Hmm, but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current front index and a current size. Let me try this approach:\n\nInitialize q1 as an array of size n, filled with the input values. The front1 starts at 1, and the size1 is n. Similarly for q2.\n\nThen, in each iteration of the loop:\n\nCheck the element at q1(front1). If it's <= m:\n\n- Dequeue both queues: take the elements at front1 and front2, then increment front1 and front2. Decrement size1 and size2 by 1. The ans is set to the q2 element.\n\nElse:\n\n- Take the element from q1(front1), subtract m, and enqueue it back to q1. Similarly, take the q2(front2) element and enqueue it back to q2.\n\nWait, but how to enqueue? Since the queues are arrays, perhaps when enqueuing, we can shift elements? That would be O(n) time, which is not efficient, but for code purposes, maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be implemented as a list where elements are stored in a way that allows appending to the end. Since in Fortran, arrays are fixed, but we can use a circular buffer approach where the front and rear indices wrap around the array.\n\nLet me try to model the queues as circular buffers with arrays of size n. The front and rear indices are tracked. The size is initially n for both queues.\n\nFor q1:\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nrear1 = n\n\nsize1 = n\n\nSimilarly for q2.\n\nWhen you dequeue from q1:\n\nelement = q1(front1)\n\nfront1 = front1 mod n + 1 (Wait, no. Let me think of mod as 1-based. Maybe front1 = front1 + 1. If front1 exceeds n, set to 1. So:\n\nfront1 = front1 + 1\n\nif (front1 > n) front1 = 1\n\nSimilarly for rear.\n\nWait, but the size is tracked as (rear - front + n) mod n? Not sure. Alternatively, the size is tracked as the number of elements. So when you dequeue, size1 decreases by 1. When you enqueue, size1 increases by 1.\n\nWait, but in the first case, when the element is <= m, both queues lose an element (so their sizes decrease by 1). When the element is > m, the queues lose an element (size decreases by 1) but then add it back (size increases by 1). So the size remains the same except when elements are removed permanently.\n\nHmm, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with front and rear pointers, and the size is tracked. Let me try to code this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays, and when elements are dequeued, they are simply removed from the front, and enqueued elements are added to the end. But since arrays can't be dynamically resized, perhaps we can use a list approach with a pointer to the current front. For example, the queues are arrays of size n, and the front index is tracked. The elements are stored in the array in order, and when you dequeue, you take the element at front, then increment front. When you enqueue, you put the element at the end (current rear) and increment rear. But when front exceeds the array size, we can wrap around to the start. Let me see:\n\nInitialize q1 array with the input values. The front1 starts at 1, rear1 at n+1 (so next position to add is rear1). The size1 is n.\n\nWait, but the array is size n, so rear1 can't go beyond n. Hmm, perhaps the queues can be implemented as a circular buffer with size n. So when you enqueue, if rear exceeds n, it wraps to 1. Let me try:\n\nInitialize q1 array with the input values. front1 = 1, rear1 = n+1 (but mod n). Wait, maybe:\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nrear1 = 1\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is:\n\nFor q1:\n\nThe elements are stored in positions 1 to n. front1 = 1, rear1 = n+1 (but mod n). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the queues as arrays with front and rear indices, and when you dequeue, you take the front element and increment front. When you enqueue, you put the element at rear, then increment rear. The size is rear - front. But when rear exceeds n, perhaps we can wrap around. Alternatively, the queues can be implemented as a list where elements are stored in a way that allows appending to the end, but in Fortran arrays are fixed. So perhaps the maximum size needed is n, since the queues can cycle elements but the size remains n until elements are removed.\n\nWait, in the first part's loop, when an element is over m, it's removed and added back, so the size remains the same. Only when an element is under or equal to m, the size decreases by 1. So the queues can have a maximum size of n, so arrays of size n can hold all elements.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays of size n, and we track the current front and rear indices. The elements are stored in the array in order. The front is the next element to process. The rear is the next position to add an element. The size is (rear - front + n) mod n? Not sure. Alternatively, the size is tracked as a variable.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for the first part in code:\n\nFirst, read n and m, then read n integers into an array q1_values. The second queue q2_values is 1 to n.\n\nWe can model the queues as two arrays (q1 and q2) of size n. The front and rear indices are tracked. Initially, front1 = 1, rear1 = n+1 (but mod n?), but perhaps front1 starts at 1, and the elements are stored from 1 to n. The rear1 is n+1, but since the array is size n, perhaps rear1 is 1 when wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues are implemented as arrays with front and rear pointers, and when you dequeue, you take the front element and increment front. When you enqueue, you put the element at rear and increment rear. The size is (rear - front) mod n? Not sure. Let me think of the queues as follows:\n\nInitialize q1 array with the input values. The front1 is 1, rear1 is n+1. The size1 is n.\n\nWait, but the array is size n, so rear1 can't be n+1. Hmm, perhaps the rear is the next position to write. So for the initial setup, the elements are stored from 1 to n. The front is 1, and the rear is n+1 (but mod n). So when you enqueue, you put the element at rear mod n, then increment rear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with front and rear indices, and the elements are stored in a circular manner. Let me try to code this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, declare the arrays:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: q1, q2\ninteger :: front1, rear1, size1, front2, rear2, size2, ans, current_val, current_val2\n\nRead n and m:\n\nread*, n, m\n\nallocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n\nread*, q1(1:n)\n\nq2(1:n) = [(i, i=1,n)]\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nrear1 = n + 1\n\nsize1 = n\n\nfront2 = 1\n\nrear2 = n + 1\n\nsize2 = n\n\nWait, but rear1 is n+1, but the array is size n. So when we enqueue, we can do mod n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rear is tracked modulo n. Let me think of the queues as circular buffers with size n. So when you enqueue, the rear is (rear -1) mod n? Not sure. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are dequeued from the front and enqueued to the end, perhaps we can represent the queues as arrays and track the current front index. The elements are stored in the array in order, and when you dequeue, you take the front element and increment the front. When you enqueue, you put the element at the end of the array (current rear) and increment the rear. But when the front reaches the end of the array, we can wrap around to the beginning. So the queues are implemented as a circular buffer.\n\nLet me try to code this:\n\nInitialize front1 = 1, rear1 = n+1 (but mod n). Wait, perhaps:\n\nInitialize front1 = 1, rear1 = n+1. But since the array is size n, rear1 can't be n+1. So perhaps rear1 is 1 when wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, the queues can be represented as arrays with front and rear indices, and when you enqueue, you place the element at rear1 mod n, then increment rear1. Let me try:\n\nInitialize front1 = 1, rear1 = 1. The initial elements are stored from 1 to n. So for the first queue, the elements are stored in positions 1 to n. So front1 starts at 1, and rear1 starts at n+1 (but mod n). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays, and when elements are dequeued, they are simply removed from the front by shifting the array. But this would be O(n) time, which is not efficient, but for code purposes, maybe manageable.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the queues are implemented with LinkedList, which allows O(1) add/remove from both ends. So in Fortran, perhaps the best way is to use arrays and track the front and rear indices, and when elements are enqueued, they are added to the end of the array. But since the array is fixed size, perhaps we can use a pointer to track the current front and rear.\n\nWait, here's an idea: since the queues can cycle elements, but the total number of elements in each queue never exceeds n (since when you dequeue and enqueue, the count stays the same until an element is removed permanently), we can represent each queue as an array of size n, and track the current front and rear indices. The elements are stored in the array in a circular manner. The front is the next element to process, and the rear is the next position to add an element. The size is tracked as (rear - front + n) mod n. But perhaps it's easier to track the front and rear indices and the size.\n\nLet me try to code this step by step.\n\nFirst, for the first queue (q1):\n\nInitialize the array with the input values. The front starts at 1, rear at n+1 (but mod n?), but perhaps rear is n+1, but since the array is size n, when we enqueue, we can use modulo n to wrap around.\n\nWait, perhaps the rear is initially n+1, but when we enqueue, we do (rear -1) mod n? Not sure. Let me think of the queues as follows:\n\nThe queues are arrays of size n. The front and rear are indices (1-based). The elements are stored between front and rear. When you dequeue, you take the front element and increment front. When you enqueue, you place the element at rear, then increment rear. If rear exceeds n, it wraps to 1. The size is (rear - front + n) mod n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, for q1:\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nrear1 = n+1 (but mod n would be 1 if n is the array size). Hmm, perhaps rear1 starts at n+1, but when mod n, it's 1. So rear1 = mod(rear1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial rear is n+1, but when you enqueue, you do:\n\nrear1 = mod(rear1, n)\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me try to code this step by step.\n\nInitialize q1 array with the input values. The front1 is 1, rear1 is n+1. The size is n.\n\nWait, but the array is size n, so rear1 can't be n+1. So perhaps rear1 is initialized to n+1 mod n, which is 1. So rear1 starts at 1. But that would mean the initial rear is 1, which is the same as front. Hmm, not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial rear is n+1, but when you enqueue, you do:\n\nposition = mod(rear1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues are implemented as follows:\n\nThe queues are arrays of size n. The front and rear are indices (1-based). The elements are stored in the array from front to rear-1. When you dequeue, you take the front element and increment front. When you enqueue, you place the element at rear and increment rear. If rear exceeds n, then rear wraps to 1. The size is (rear - front + n) mod n.\n\nWait, let's see with an example:\n\nSuppose n=3, initial elements are [a,b,c].\n\nfront1 =1, rear1 =4 (but mod 3 is 1). Hmm, no. Maybe rear1 starts at n+1, but when mod n, it's 1. So rear1 is 1. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial rear is n+1, but when you enqueue, you do:\n\nrear1 = mod(rear1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach for the first part:\n\nInstead of using queues, since the process is to process elements in a loop, perhaps we can represent the queues as arrays and track the current position. Each time we process the front element, we can shift the arrays accordingly.\n\nWait, here's an idea: since the queues are processed in a way that elements are dequeued from the front and enqueued to the end, the queues can be represented as arrays where the elements are rotated. For example, the first queue can be represented as an array, and each time an element is dequeued and enqueued, it's moved to the end. The only time elements are removed permanently is when they are <= m.\n\nSo, the process can be modeled as follows:\n\nInitialize q1 as the array of input values. q2 as 1 to n.\n\nans = 0\n\nloop while q1 is not empty:\n\n    current_val = q1(1)\n\n    if current_val <= m:\n\n        ans = q2(1)\n\n        remove the first element from q1 and q2.\n\n    else:\n\n        current_val = current_val - m\n\n        append current_val to the end of q1\n\n        append q2(1) to the end of q2\n\n        remove the first element from q1 and q2 (since we took it out and put it back?)\n\nWait, no. Wait in the Java code, when the element is > m, they do:\n\nx = q1.poll();\n\nval = x - m;\n\nq1.add(val);\n\nSimilarly for q2's element.\n\nSo the element is removed from the front of q1 and added to the end. So the queues' elements are rotated, except when the element is small enough.\n\nTherefore, the queues can be represented as arrays, and each time an element is processed, if it's over m, it's moved to the end of the queue, and the corresponding q2 element is also moved to the end. The queues are effectively being rotated, except when elements are removed.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays, and we can track the current position. Each time we process an element, we check if it's <= m. If yes, we remove it (so the queues' lengths decrease by 1). If not, we subtract m and put it back to the end (so the queues' lengths stay the same).\n\nTo model this in Fortran, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current length, and the elements are stored in a way that allows appending to the end and removing from the front.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So perhaps we can use a circular buffer approach where the elements are stored in an array of size n, and we track the current length and the front index.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nFor q1 and q2, each has an array of size n. The front index is tracked, and the current length is tracked.\n\nInitially, for q1:\n\narray_q1(1:n) = input values\n\nfront_q1 = 1\n\nlength_q1 = n\n\nSimilarly for q2:\n\narray_q2(1:n) = 1,2,...,n\n\nfront_q2 =1\n\nlength_q2 =n\n\nThen, in each iteration:\n\ncurrent_val = array_q1(front_q1)\n\nif current_val <= m:\n\n    ans = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n    front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n    front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n    length_q1 = length_q1 -1\n\n    length_q2 = length_q2 -1\n\nelse:\n\n    current_val = current_val - m\n\n    ! append to the end of q1:\n\n    new_pos = (front_q1 + length_q1 -1) mod n +1\n\n    array_q1(new_pos) = current_val\n\n    ! append to the end of q2:\n\n    new_pos_q2 = (front_q2 + length_q2 -1) mod n +1\n\n    array_q2(new_pos_q2) = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n    ! remove the front elements (since they were polled and added back)\n\n    front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n    front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\nWait, but this might not be correct. Because when you add the element back, you need to increment the length? No, because when you poll and add back, the length remains the same. So the length doesn't change in this case.\n\nWait, in the else case:\n\nThe element is removed from the front (so front increments by 1, but the length remains the same because we add it back). So the length stays the same.\n\nHmm, perhaps the length remains the same in the else case. So the length only decreases in the if case.\n\nTherefore, the length variables can be tracked as:\n\nIn the if case:\n\nlength_q1 = length_q1 -1\n\nlength_q2 = length_q2 -1\n\nIn the else case:\n\nNo change to length.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndo while (length_q1 >0)\n\n    current_val = array_q1(front_q1)\n\n    if (current_val <= m) then\n\n        ans = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n        front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n        front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n        length_q1 = length_q1 -1\n\n        length_q2 = length_q2 -1\n\n    else\n\n        current_val = current_val - m\n\n        ! append to q1's end:\n\n        new_pos = (front_q1 + length_q1 -1) mod n\n\n        if (new_pos ==0) new_pos =n\n\n        array_q1(new_pos +1) = current_val\n\n        ! append to q2's end:\n\n        new_pos_q2 = (front_q2 + length_q2 -1) mod n\n\n        if (new_pos_q2 ==0) new_pos_q2 =n\n\n        array_q2(new_pos_q2 +1) = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n        ! move front pointers:\n\n        front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n        front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this might have off-by-one errors. Let me think of the new_pos calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the new position to append is (front_q1 + length_q1 -1) mod n +1 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better way is to use a circular buffer where the elements are stored in the array, and the front and length are tracked. The next position to write is (front + length -1) mod n +1 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current length and front index, and when appending, the new element is placed at (front + length -1) mod n +1 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a list-like structure where the elements are stored in an array, and the front is tracked. When you need to append, you can shift elements, but that's O(n) time. For small n, this might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current length and front index. The elements are stored in the array from front to front + length -1 (mod n). So when you append, you place the new element at (front + length) mod n, and increment length.\n\nWait, let's try this approach:\n\nInitialize array_q1(1:n) with the input values.\n\nfront_q1 =1\n\nlength_q1 =n\n\nSimilarly for q2.\n\nThen, in each iteration:\n\ncurrent_val = array_q1(front_q1)\n\nif current_val <=m:\n\n    ans = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n    ! remove from front:\n\n    front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n    front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n    length_q1 = length_q1 -1\n\n    length_q2 = length_q2 -1\n\nelse:\n\n    current_val = current_val -m\n\n    ! append to q1:\n\n    new_pos = (front_q1 + length_q1) mod n\n\n    if (new_pos ==0) new_pos =n\n\n    array_q1(new_pos) = current_val\n\n    ! append to q2:\n\n    new_pos_q2 = (front_q2 + length_q2) mod n\n\n    if (new_pos_q2 ==0) new_pos_q2 =n\n\n    array_q2(new_pos_q2) = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n    ! move front pointers:\n\n    front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n    front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\nWait, but in this case, the length remains the same because we added back the element. So length_q1 and length_q2 are not changed in the else case.\n\nWait, but when we append, the length increases by 1, but we also removed one element (the front), so net change is zero. So the length remains the same.\n\nAh, right! So in the else case, the length stays the same. So the length variables don't change.\n\nTherefore, the code for the else case would be:\n\ncurrent_val = current_val -m\n\n! append to q1:\n\nnew_pos = (front_q1 + length_q1 -1) mod n +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the new position is (front_q1 + length_q1) mod n ?\n\nWait, let me think of the array as circular. The current elements are from front to front + length -1 (mod n). To append, we place the new element at (front + length) mod n, and the length remains the same.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove the front element (by incrementing front), and then append, the length remains the same.\n\nWait, in the else case:\n\nWe remove the front element (by incrementing front), then append the new element. So the total length remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the length variables are not changed in the else case.\n\nSo the code for the else case would be:\n\ncurrent_val = current_val - m\n\n! append to q1:\n\nnew_pos = (front_q1 + length_q1) mod n\n\nif (new_pos ==0) new_pos =n\n\narray_q1(new_pos) = current_val\n\n! append to q2:\n\nnew_pos_q2 = (front_q2 + length_q2) mod n\n\nif (new_pos_q2 ==0) new_pos_q2 =n\n\narray_q2(new_pos_q2) = array_q2(front_q2)\n\n! move front pointers:\n\nfront_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\nfront_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\nWait, but the front is incremented, so the next element is the next one in the array.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach will work. Let me test with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=5, and the input values are 3, 6, 4.\n\nInitial q1 array: [3,6,4], front_q1=1, length_q1=3.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ncurrent_val =3 (<=5). So ans is q2's first element (1). Then front_q1 becomes 2, front_q2 becomes 2. length_q1 and q2 become 2.\n\nNow q1 has elements [6,4], but stored from front=2 (so elements 2 and 3).\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ncurrent_val =6>5.\n\ncurrent_val becomes 1 (6-5=1).\n\nAppend to q1: new_pos = (2 + 2) mod 3 =4 mod3=1. So array_q1(1)=1.\n\nThen front_q1 increments to 3, front_q2 to 3.\n\nNow q1's elements are at positions 3 and 1 (since front is 3, length is 2: positions 3 and 1 (mod 3)).\n\nNext iteration:\n\ncurrent_val is array_q1(3) =4 (since the array is [1,6,4] ? Wait, no. Wait initial array was [3,6,4]. After first iteration, front is 2, so elements are 6 and4. Then in the else case, after processing 6, we append 1 to position (2+2) mod3=4 mod3=1. So array_q1(1)=1. Then front increments to 3. So the current elements are at positions 2 (6?), 3 (4), and 1 (1). But the length is still 2? Wait no, the length remains 2. So the elements are from front=3 to front+length-1 =3+2-1=4 mod3=1. So the elements are at positions 3 and 1 (4 and 1).\n\nSo next iteration's current_val is array_q1(3) =4 (since the array at position3 is 4). 4 <=5, so ans is q2's front (which is now at front_q2=3, so array_q2(3)=3).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter first iteration, q2's front is 2, length is 2. The elements are at positions 2 and 3 (values 2 and3).\n\nIn the else case processing the 6:\n\nWe append the q2's front (2) to the end. The new_pos_q2 is (2 +2) mod3=4 mod3=1. So array_q2(1)=2. Then front_q2 increments to 3. So the q2's elements are now at positions 3 and 1 (3 and 2). The length is still 2.\n\nSo when we process the next element (4):\n\ncurrent_val is 4 (array_q1(3)=4). Since 4 <=5, ans is array_q2(3)=3. Then front_q1 becomes 4 mod3=1, front_q2 becomes4 mod3=1. The lengths become 1 each.\n\nNow the queues have length 1. The next iteration:\n\ncurrent_val is array_q1(1)=1 (since front is 1, length 1). 1 <=5, so ans is array_q2(1)=2. Then front increments to 2, lengths become 0. The loop ends.\n\nWait, but the final ans should be the last value popped from q2, which in the Java code would be the last ans set. In this example, the first time ans is set to 1, then when processing the 4, ans is set to3, then when processing the 1, ans is set to2. So the final ans is 2?\n\nWait, but let's see what the Java code would do.\n\nJava code steps:\n\nInitial queues:\n\nq1: [3,6,4], q2: [1,2,3]\n\nFirst iteration: 3 <=5 \u2192 ans=1. q1 becomes [6,4], q2 becomes [2,3].\n\nSecond iteration: 6>5 \u2192 subtract 5 \u21921. Add back to q1 \u2192 [4,1]. q2's element 2 is added back \u2192 q2 becomes [3,2].\n\nThird iteration: 4 <=5 \u2192 ans=3. q1 becomes [1], q2 becomes [2].\n\nFourth iteration: 1 <=5 \u2192 ans=2. q1 is now empty. So the final ans is 2.\n\nYes, so the final ans is 2. So the code's approach would need to capture that.\n\nIn the Fortran code's approach, after processing the 4 (second iteration's else case), then the next iteration's current_val is 4 (from q1's front=3, which is 4). So ans is set to 3. Then the front moves to 4 mod3=1, length becomes 2-1=1 (wait, no, in the first case, when current_val is 4 (<=5), the length is 2 (from previous step's length_q1=2). So after processing, length becomes 1.\n\nThen next iteration:\n\ncurrent_val is array_q1(1) =1 (since front is 1, length 1). So ans is set to array_q2(1)=2. Then front increments to 2, length becomes 0. So the final ans is 2. Which matches.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the code for the first part can be structured this way.\n\nNow, moving to the second part (atcoder_ABC172_D):\n\nThe second program takes an integer n (which is the ans from the first part) and computes the sum over i from 1 to n of i multiplied by (n//i) * (n//i +1)/2.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be done with a loop from i=1 to n, accumulating the sum.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe entire Fortran program must read the initial inputs (n and m, then the n numbers), process the first part to get the intermediate value (ans), then compute the second part's result using that ans as n, and output it.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, ans_part1, ans_part2\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: q1, q2\n\ninteger :: front_q1, front_q2, length_q1, length_q2, current_val, current_val2, i, j\n\nRead the initial inputs:\n\nread*, n, m\n\nallocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n\nread*, q1(1:n)\n\nq2(1:n) = [(i, i=1,n)]\n\nfront_q1 =1\n\nfront_q2 =1\n\nlength_q1 =n\n\nlength_q2 =n\n\nans_part1 =0\n\nThen, process the first part:\n\ndo while (length_q1 >0)\n\n    current_val = q1(front_q1)\n\n    if (current_val <= m) then\n\n        ans_part1 = q2(front_q2)\n\n        front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n        front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n        length_q1 = length_q1 -1\n\n        length_q2 = length_q2 -1\n\n    else\n\n        current_val = current_val - m\n\n        ! append to q1:\n\n        new_pos = mod(front_q1 + length_q1 -1, n) +1\n\n        q1(new_pos) = current_val\n\n        ! append to q2:\n\n        new_pos_q2 = mod(front_q2 + length_q2 -1, n) +1\n\n        q2(new_pos_q2) = q2(front_q2)\n\n        front_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\n        front_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, the calculation of new_pos might need to be adjusted. Let me think:\n\nThe new position to append is (front + length -1) mod n +1 ?\n\nWait, the current elements are from front to front + length -1 (mod n). The next position to append is (front + length) mod n. But since arrays are 1-based, perhaps:\n\nnew_pos = mod(front_q1 + length_q1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose front is 1, length is 3, n=5. Then front + length -1 =3 \u2192 mod5 is 3 \u2192 new_pos is 4?\n\nWait, perhaps the new position is (front + length) mod n. If mod is zero, then n.\n\nWait, let me think of the new position as (front + length) mod n. If the result is zero, then it's n.\n\nWait, in the else case:\n\nWe need to append the new element to the end of the current elements. The current elements are from front to front + length -1 (mod n). The next position is (front + length) mod n.\n\nSo:\n\nnew_pos = mod(front_q1 + length_q1, n)\n\nif (new_pos ==0) new_pos =n\n\nSimilarly for q2.\n\nWait, let me rework the code for the else case:\n\ncurrent_val = current_val - m\n\n! append to q1:\n\nnew_pos = mod(front_q1 + length_q1, n)\n\nif (new_pos ==0) new_pos =n\n\nq1(new_pos) = current_val\n\n! append to q2:\n\nnew_pos_q2 = mod(front_q2 + length_q2, n)\n\nif (new_pos_q2 ==0) new_pos_q2 =n\n\nq2(new_pos_q2) = q2(front_q2)\n\nfront_q1 = front_q1 +1\n\nfront_q2 = front_q2 +1\n\nWait, let's test this with the previous example:\n\nExample where n=3, m=5, q1 initial [3,6,4].\n\nFirst iteration (current_val=3):\n\nans_part1 is set to 1. front_q1 becomes 2, length_q1=2.\n\nSecond iteration (current_val=6>5):\n\ncurrent_val becomes 1.\n\nnew_pos for q1: front_q1=2, length_q1=2 \u2192 2+2=4 mod3=1 \u2192 new_pos=1.\n\nSo q1(1)=1.\n\nfront_q1 increments to 3.\n\nNow q1's elements are at front=3, length=2 \u2192 positions 3 and 1 (4 and 1).\n\nThird iteration (current_val is q1(3)=4):\n\n4 <=5 \u2192 ans_part1 becomes3. front becomes4 mod3=1, length becomes1.\n\nFourth iteration (current_val is q1(1)=1):\n\nans_part1 becomes2. front becomes2, length becomes0. loop ends.\n\nYes, this works.\n\nSo the code for the else case should use mod(front + length, n).\n\nTherefore, the code for the else case is as above.\n\nOnce the first part is done, ans_part1 holds the value needed for the second part.\n\nNow, compute the second part:\n\nans_part2 =0\n\ndo i=1, ans_part1\n\n    temp = ans_part1 / i\n\n    ans_part2 = ans_part2 + i * temp * (temp +1)/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans_part2\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe full Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, ans_part1, ans_part2\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: q1, q2\n    integer :: front_q1, front_q2, length_q1, length_q2, current_val, new_pos, new_pos_q2, i\n\n    !
