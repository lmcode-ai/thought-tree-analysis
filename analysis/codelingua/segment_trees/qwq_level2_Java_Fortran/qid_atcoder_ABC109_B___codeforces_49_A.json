    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC109_B) reads N strings. It checks two conditions: all the strings must be unique, and each subsequent string must start with the last character of the previous one. If both conditions are met, it outputs \"Yes\"; else, \"No\".\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_49_A) reads a string and checks if the last non-space or non-question mark character is a vowel (case-insensitive). If yes, outputs \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So when we run them in sequence, the first's output (\"Yes\" or \"No\") is the input for the second program. The second then processes that string.\n\nWait, but the second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then the input for the second. The second program will check the last character (ignoring spaces and ?) of that input. Let me see:\n\nSuppose first outputs \"Yes\". The second program will look for the last non-space or ? character. Since \"Yes\" has no spaces or ?, the last character is 's'. Then check if 's' is a vowel. 's' is not a vowel, so the second would output \"NO\".\n\nIf first outputs \"No\", then the last character is 'o', which is a vowel. So the second would output \"YES\".\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFor \"Yes\":\nThe last character is 's', which is not a vowel. So second program would output \"NO\".\n\nFor \"No\":\nThe last character is 'o', which is a vowel. So second outputs \"YES\".\n\nTherefore, the combined program's output depends on the first's result. So the final Fortran program must first process the input as per the first Java program, then take its result (Yes/No) and process it as per the second Java program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read the input (from the first Java program's input), process the first part, then process the second part on the result of the first, and output the final result.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the N strings (from input).\n2. Check the conditions for the first program (uniqueness and chain of first/last characters).\n3. Determine the first output (Yes/No).\n4. Take that string (\"Yes\" or \"No\") and process it as per the second program.\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nWe need to read N, then N strings. Then check for uniqueness and the chain condition.\n\nIn Fortran, handling strings and maps (hashmaps) is a bit different. Since Java uses a HashMap, but in Fortran, we can use arrays. Since the order matters, perhaps we can store the strings in an array, and also track the last character of each.\n\nWait, the first program's steps:\n\n- Read N strings, store them in a list (array in Fortran).\n- Check that all are unique. So for each string, check if it's already in the list before it.\n- Also, check that each next string starts with the last character of the previous.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first loop reads N strings into a HashMap with keys 0 to N-1. Then, in the second loop, for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n- Check if the current string is already in the past map's values. So, for uniqueness, each string must not have appeared before.\n\nWait, the code uses a HashMap 'past' to track the strings encountered so far. For each i, if the current string (map.get(i)) is already present in past's values, then it's a duplicate, so ans becomes false.\n\nWait, but in Java, past is being built incrementally. So for each i, before adding to past, check if the current string is already in past's values. So the check is for duplicates in the list up to that point.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can have an array of strings, and for each new string, check if it exists in the array up to the current index.\n\nAlternatively, for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nCheck if any of the previous entries (0 to i-1) have the same string as current. If yes, then it's a duplicate.\n\nSo for uniqueness, for each i, loop from 0 to i-1 and check if any of those entries equal current string.\n\nThat's manageable in Fortran.\n\nThen, the second condition: each next string must start with the last character of the previous.\n\nSo, for i from 1 to N-1, the first character of the current string must be the last character of the previous string.\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program:\n\nnext is initialized as empty. Then, for each i in 0 to N-1:\n\nif i !=0, check if the current string starts with next (which is the last character of previous). Then, next is set to the last character of current.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nnext is initially empty. Then, for each i:\n\nif i !=0, check if current's first character is next (the last character of previous). Then, set next to current's last character.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nnext is set to the last character of the current string. So for the next iteration, the next string must start with that.\n\nSo the first string's last character is the next's first character, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can track the previous last character as we go.\n\nNow, handling the strings in Fortran:\n\nFortran strings can be stored in an array of character arrays. Let's say each string is up to some maximum length, say 1000 characters. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume a reasonable length, or read line by line.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the strings are read with sc.next(), which reads tokens separated by whitespace. But in the problem's context, perhaps each line is a single string? Or maybe each line is a separate input? Wait, the first Java program uses sc.nextInt() for N, then for each of N times, sc.next() which would read the next token. So the input is N followed by N space-separated strings? Or each on separate lines?\n\nWait, the first Java program's code:\n\nAfter reading N, it loops N times, each time doing sc.next(). So the input is N followed by N tokens (each token is a string, possibly with spaces? No, because next() reads up to the next whitespace). Wait, but in the problem's context, perhaps each string is a single word, so the input is N followed by N words, each on a separate line or space-separated.\n\nBut in any case, in Fortran, to read the input correctly, we need to read N first, then read N strings. Each string can be read as a line, but perhaps using list-directed input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's input is given as N followed by N lines each with a string. Or maybe all on one line separated by spaces. Since Java's Scanner's next() reads tokens, so the input is space-separated.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, when reading with read(*,*) it reads until whitespace. So for each string, we can read as a character variable. But the problem is that in Fortran, strings can have varying lengths, but perhaps we can use a fixed length, say 100 characters, and read each string into a character array of that length.\n\nAlternatively, using a list-directed read for each string. Let me think.\n\nLet me structure the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst part (first Java program):\n\nRead N.\n\nThen read N strings. Let's say each string is stored in an array of strings. Let's use a character array with a sufficient length, say 100.\n\nThen check for uniqueness:\n\nLoop over each i from 1 to N (assuming 1-based index in Fortran?), but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Wait, in the Java code, the indices start at 0. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless specified otherwise. So let's say the strings are stored in an array s(1:N), each of length, say, 100.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nCheck if any of the previous entries (1 to i-1) have the same string as s(i). If yes, set ans to .false. and break.\n\nAlso, check the chain condition:\n\nInitialize prev_char as the first character of s(1). Wait no, the first string's last character is the next's first.\n\nWait, the first string's last character is the next string's first character. So for the first iteration (i=1?), no previous, so next is the last character of s(1). Then for i=2, check if s(2)(1:1) == prev_char (the last character of s(1)), etc.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe 'next' variable is initialized as empty. Then, for each i in 0 to N-1:\n\nif i !=0, check if current string starts with next (which is the last character of previous). Then set next to current's last character.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize next_char as a character variable. Initially, it's empty (but in Fortran, perhaps we can set it to a space or some default, but need to track properly).\n\nWait, for the first iteration (i=0 in Java, which is 1 in Fortran?), the next is set to the last character of the first string. Then, for the next i (second string), check if its first character matches next_char (the previous's last character).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nprev_char is the last character of the previous string. Let's track it as follows:\n\nInitialize prev_char as the last character of s(1). Then, for i from 2 to N:\n\nCheck if s(i)(1:1) == prev_char. If not, set ans to .false.\n\nThen, set prev_char to the last character of s(i).\n\nWait, but the first iteration (i=1) doesn't have a previous, so the first check is only for uniqueness. The chain check starts from the second string.\n\nSo the steps for the first part:\n\nInitialize ans as .true.\n\nCheck uniqueness:\n\nLoop over all i from 1 to N:\n\n   Loop over j from 1 to i-1:\n\n      if s(i) == s(j), then ans = .false., exit loops.\n\nThen, check the chain:\n\nprev_char = last character of s(1)\n\nLoop i from 2 to N:\n\n   if s(i)(1:1) /= prev_char, then ans = .false., exit.\n\n   prev_char = last character of s(i)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the check for uniqueness is done in the same loop as the chain check. So if any condition fails, it breaks early.\n\nIn Fortran, to do this efficiently, perhaps we can do the uniqueness check first, then the chain check, but that might not be as efficient, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, combine both checks in a loop.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps first check uniqueness, then check the chain.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the uniqueness check is done in the same loop. So if a duplicate is found, it breaks early. So in Fortran, perhaps we can do the same.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, it's a bit more involved. Let me think of the steps.\n\nFirst, read all the strings into an array.\n\nThen, check for duplicates:\n\nDo i = 1 to N:\n\n   do j = 1 to i-1:\n\n      if s(i) == s(j), then set ans to .false., exit loops.\n\n   end do\n\n   if ans is already false, break.\n\nend do\n\nThen, if ans is still true, check the chain:\n\nprev_char = s(1)(len_trim(s(1)):len_trim(s(1)))  'last character'\n\ndo i = 2 to N:\n\n   if s(i)(1:1) /= prev_char then ans = .false., exit loop.\n\n   prev_char = s(i)(len_trim(s(i)):len_trim(s(i)))\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the len_trim function gives the length of the string (excluding trailing spaces). So assuming that the strings don't have trailing spaces, which is probably the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if the strings are read with a fixed length, perhaps we need to use the last character of the string as stored. But using len_trim is better.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the strings are read with sc.next(), which trims whitespace, so the strings don't have leading/trailing spaces. So in Fortran, when reading, perhaps using list-directed input (read(*,*) s(i)), which would read until whitespace, so each s(i) is a single token, so len_trim(s(i)) gives the actual length.\n\nTherefore, the last character is s(i)(len_trim(s(i)):len_trim(s(i))).\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, after determining the first output (Yes or No), we need to process it through the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\nTake the input string (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), and check the last non-space or non-? character. Since the input here is \"Yes\" or \"No\", there are no spaces or ? in them, so the last character is the last character of the string.\n\nThen, check if that character (lowercased) is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the code:\n\nch is the last non-space or non-? character. Then, it converts to lowercase and checks if it's in the vowels.\n\nIn our case, since the input is \"Yes\" or \"No\", the last character is 's' or 'o'.\n\nSo for \"Yes\", last character is 's' (lowercase 's'), which is not a vowel (since vowels are a,e,i,o,u,y). Wait, 'y' is considered a vowel here. So 's' is not, so output is NO.\n\nFor \"No\", last character is 'o', which is a vowel, so output is YES.\n\nTherefore, the second part's result depends on the first's output.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the second part's processing:\n\nTake the first output string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), process it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\n1. Take the input string (from first part's result).\n\n2. Find the last character that is not a space or '?'. Since the input is \"Yes\" or \"No\", there are no such characters, so the last character is the last character of the string.\n\n3. Convert that character to lowercase.\n\n4. Check if it is one of a, e, i, o, u, y.\n\n5. Output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nAfter determining the first result (ans_str = \"Yes\" or \"No\"), process it:\n\ns = ans_str\n\nch = ' '\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c /= ' ' .and. c /= '?') then\n\n      ch = c\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (ch == ' ') then ... but in our case, there will be a character.\n\nThen, convert to lowercase: ch = lowercase(ch)\n\nThen check if ch is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y']\n\nIf yes, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nNow, in Fortran, converting to lowercase can be done with ichar and achar functions.\n\nFor example:\n\nch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32) if it's uppercase.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first part's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo \"Yes\" has 'Y' as uppercase, so converting to lowercase would be 'y'.\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSo for \"Yes\", the last character is 's', but the first character is 'Y', but the last character is 's', which is lowercase already. Wait, the string \"Yes\" is Y-e-s, so last character is 's', lowercase. The second program's code converts the character to lowercase, so even if it was uppercase, it would be converted. But in \"Yes\", the 'Y' is uppercase, but the last character is 's', which is lowercase. So converting to lowercase is okay.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n\nSo regardless of the case, it's converted to lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the character:\n\nch = s_char (the last non-space/? character)\n\nThen, if it's uppercase, convert to lowercase.\n\nSo:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n   ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nThen check if ch is in the vowels.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nRead N and N strings.\n\nProcess first part to get ans_str (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nProcess ans_str through the second part's logic to get the final output.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need an array to hold the N strings. Let's say each string is up to 100 characters.\n\ninteger :: N\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s(1000)  ! Assuming N up to 1000, but maybe better to read N first.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we can't have an array with size determined at runtime unless using allocatable arrays. So perhaps read N first, then allocate the array.\n\nAlternatively, use a fixed size, say 1000, which is sufficient for the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter. Let's proceed with a fixed size for simplicity.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nThen read N strings.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: N, i, j, len_s, found, vowel\n  character(len=100) :: s(1000)\n  logical :: ans\n  character(len=3) :: first_result\n  character(len=1) :: ch, c\n  logical :: is_vowel\n\n  ! Read N and the strings\n  read(*,*) N\n  do i = 1, N\n     read(*,*) s(i)\n  end do\n\n  ! First part processing\n  ans = .true.\n\n  !

If still ans is true, check the chain condition\n  if (ans) then\n     if (N >= 1) then\n        ! Get last character of first string\n        len_s = len_trim(s(1))\n        ch = s(1)(len_s:len_s)\n        do i = 2, N\n           ! Check first character of current string matches previous last\n           if (s(i)(1:1) /= ch) then\n              ans = .false.\n              exit\n           end if\n           ! Update ch to current's last character\n           len_s = len_trim(s(i))\n           ch = s(i)(len_s:len_s)\n        end do\n     end if\n  end if\n\n  ! Determine first_result\n  if (ans) then\n     first_result = \"Yes\"\n  else\n     first_result = \"No\"\n  end if\n\n  ! Now process through second part\n  ! Find last non-space or non-? character in first_result\n  ch = ' '\n  do i = len_trim(first_result), 1, -1\n     c = first_result(i:i)\n     if (c /= ' ' .and. c /= '?') then\n        ch = c\n        exit\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert to lowercase\n  if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n     ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n  end if\n\n  ! Check if vowel\n  is_vowel = .false.\n  select case(ch)\n  case ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y')\n     is_vowel = .true.\n  end select\n\n  ! Output\n  if (is_vowel) then\n     print *, \"YES\"\n  else\n     print *, \"NO\"\n  end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first part's uniqueness check, the code compares the strings with trim(s(i)) == trim(s(j))? Or without trim?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the strings are stored as they are, so in Fortran, the comparison should be exact, including any trailing spaces? But in the Java code, sc.next() trims the input, so the strings don't have leading/trailing whitespace. So in Fortran, when reading with list-directed input (read(*,*) s(i)), the strings are stored without trailing spaces. So using trim is not necessary here. Wait, but in Fortran, when you read a string with list-directed input, it reads until the next whitespace, so the stored string has no trailing spaces. So the trim is redundant here. So the comparison can be done without trim.\n\nWait, for example, if the input is \"abc   \" (with trailing spaces), the read(*,*) would read \"abc\" (without the spaces). So the stored s(i) would have the correct string. So the trim is unnecessary. So the code can compare s(i) == s(j) directly.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when comparing two character strings of different lengths, the shorter one is padded with spaces. So if two strings have different lengths but same content up to the shorter length, they would be considered equal. To avoid that, we can use the len_trim function to get the actual length and compare only up to that.\n\nAlternatively, use the trim function to remove trailing spaces, but in our case, the strings don't have trailing spaces, so the trim is not needed. So perhaps the correct way is to compare the trimmed strings, but since the input doesn't have trailing spaces, the strings are stored correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the trim function to be safe, but in this case, it's not necessary. Let me think.\n\nSuppose two strings are \"abc\" and \"abc \" (with a space). The first is stored as \"abc\", the second as \"abc \" (but when read with list-directed input, the second would actually be read as \"abc\" if the space is a separator. Wait, no. The list-directed input reads until the next whitespace, so \"abc \" would be read as \"abc\" (without the trailing space). So the stored string would not have trailing spaces. So the strings are stored correctly. So comparing s(i) == s(j) would work because the actual content is the same.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when comparing two strings of different lengths, the comparison is done up to the length of the shorter one, with the longer one's extra characters being ignored. So if one string is \"abc\" (length 3) and another is \"abcd\" (length 4), then comparing them would return false because the first three characters are same, but the fourth is not considered. Wait, no, actually, in Fortran, when comparing two character variables of different lengths, the shorter one is extended with spaces to the length of the longer one, then compared. So \"abc\" (length 3) vs \"abcd\" (length4) would be compared as \"abc \" vs \"abcd\", so they are different.\n\nTherefore, to compare the actual content, we need to ensure that the strings are of the same length, or compare only up to the minimum length. Alternatively, use the len_trim function to get the actual length and compare the strings up to that length.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. To handle this correctly, perhaps the best way is to compare the trimmed strings, but since the input doesn't have trailing spaces, maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, use the len_trim function to get the length of each string and compare the substrings up to that length.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nif (s(i)(1:len_trim(s(i))) == s(j)(1:len_trim(s(j))) then ... but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, use the trim function:\n\nif (trim(s(i)) == trim(s(j))) then ...\n\nBut since the strings don't have trailing spaces, trim is redundant, but it ensures that any leading or trailing spaces (if any) are removed. Since the input is read correctly, this is safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input ensures that the strings are unique without considering trailing spaces, so the code can proceed with the trim.\n\nTo be safe, I'll use trim(s(i)) == trim(s(j)).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the strings are stored as they are, so if two strings have the same characters but different lengths (due to trailing spaces?), but in the problem's context, the input is such that sc.next() gives the exact string without trailing spaces. So in Fortran, the strings are stored correctly, so trimming is not needed. But to be safe, perhaps use trim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such edge cases, so the code can proceed without.\n\nHmm, perhaps proceed without trim for now, but in the code, the comparison is s(i) == s(j). Let me see.\n\nWait, in the code above, the uniqueness check is:\n\nif (trim(s(i)) == trim(s(j))) then\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, I didn't use trim. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, the code was:\n\nif (s(i) == s(j)) then\n\nBut that may not be correct if the strings have different lengths but same content up to the shorter length.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. For example, if two strings are \"abc\" and \"abc \", but in reality, the second would not be read as such. But if the input has such cases, the code would consider them equal even if they are different.\n\nBut according to the problem's first Java program, the strings are read via sc.next(), which trims whitespace, so the stored strings don't have leading/trailing spaces. So the lengths are correct. So comparing s(i) == s(j) is okay.\n\nWait, because in Fortran, when you read a string with list-directed input, the string is stored without trailing spaces. So the length of the string (len_trim(s(i))) is exactly the length of the input token. So two strings that are the same in content and length will have s(i) == s(j) as true. Those with different lengths will be considered different even if the first part is same.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed with s(i) == s(j).\n\nSo the uniqueness check can be done as:\n\nif (s(i) == s(j)) then\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, the chain check:\n\nThe first string's last character is s(1)(len_trim(s(1)):len_trim(s(1))). So in code:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s(1))\n\nch = s(1)(len_s:len_s)\n\nThen for each next string, check if its first character matches ch.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part's processing.\n\nThe first_result is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWe need to process this string to find the last non-space or non-? character.\n\nIn \"Yes\", the characters are 'Y','e','s', so the last is 's'.\n\nIn \"No\", the last is 'o'.\n\nSo the loop over the string from the end backwards until a non-space and non-? is found.\n\nOnce found, convert to lowercase.\n\nThen check if it's a vowel.\n\nThe code for that part is as written.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\ncba\n\narc\n\nCheck uniqueness: all unique.\n\nCheck chain:\n\nabc ends with 'c', next is cba starts with 'c' \u2192 okay.\n\ncba ends with 'a', next is arc starts with 'a' \u2192 okay.\n\nSo first output is \"Yes\".\n\nThen second program processes \"Yes\" \u2192 last character 's' (lowercase 's') \u2192 not vowel \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nSo the final output is \"NO\".\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n2\n\nab\n\nba\n\nUnique, chain: 'ab' ends with 'b', next starts with 'b' \u2192 okay. So first output \"Yes\".\n\nSecond program: \"Yes\" \u2192 's' \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nAnother test case where first outputs \"No\".\n\nSuppose N=2, strings \"ab\" and \"cd\".\n\nThen the second string starts with 'c' which is not the last character of first ('b'), so first outputs \"No\".\n\nSecond program processes \"No\" \u2192 last character 'o' \u2192 vowel \u2192 output \"YES\".\n\nAnother test case where first has duplicates:\n\nN=2, \"ab\" and \"ab\".\n\nFirst outputs \"No\" \u2192 second outputs \"YES\".\n\nAnother case where first has a duplicate but chain is okay.\n\nN=3, \"a\", \"a\", \"a\".\n\nThe first check finds duplicate at i=2 (j=1), so ans is false \u2192 first outputs \"No\".\n\nSecond outputs \"YES\".\n\nNow, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the first_result is stored as a 3-character string. \"Yes\" is 3 characters, \"No\" is 2. Wait, \"No\" is two characters. So when stored in a 3-character variable, it would be \"No \" (with a space). But in Fortran, when assigning \"No\" to a 3-character variable, it pads with spaces. So the len_trim(first_result) would be 2 for \"No\".\n\nTherefore, when processing the second part, the loop over the first_result from the end:\n\nFor \"Yes\" (3 characters):\n\nLoop from 3 down to 1:\n\ni=3: character is 's' (not space or ? \u2192 so ch is 's'.\n\nFor \"No\" (stored as \"No \"):\n\nLoop from 3 down to 1:\n\ni=3: character is ' ' \u2192 skip.\n\ni=2: 'o' \u2192 not space or ?, so ch is 'o'.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code for the second part:\n\nThe first_result is assigned as \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn Fortran, when assigning to a 3-character variable, \"No\" becomes \"No \" (with a space at the end). But when we loop from len_trim(first_result) down, which for \"No\" is 2, so the loop starts at 2, then 1.\n\nWait, len_trim(first_result) for \"No\" (stored as \"No \") is 2, so the loop starts at 2, then 1.\n\nAt i=2, the character is 'o', so it's taken.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when N=0? But the problem probably assumes N is at least 1.\n\nBut in the code, when N=0, the first part's ans remains true, but the chain check would not execute. Then first_result is \"Yes\".\n\nThen the second part processes \"Yes\" \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nBut according to the first Java program, if N=0, the code would have N=0, then the loop for i from 0 to N-1 (which is -1) doesn't run. The ans remains true, so outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother possible issue: when N=1.\n\nThen, the first part's chain check is skipped (since i starts from 2 to N=1, which is no iterations). So the chain condition is automatically satisfied. The uniqueness is also okay (only one string). So first outputs \"Yes\".\n\nSecond part processes \"Yes\" \u2192 output \"NO\".\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
