Loop ends. pos remains 0 (since initially pos=0, and first mid was 2, but in first step, low=1, high=3, mid=2, keys(2)=3 <0? No, 3 is not less than 0. Wait, in this case, num is 0, so keys(1)=1 is greater than 0. So the first mid is 2 (keys(2)=3 >=0 \u2192 so high becomes 1. Then mid is (1+1)/2=1. keys(1)=1 >=0 \u2192 high becomes 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC134_E). It reads an integer n, then n numbers. It uses a TreeMap to track the counts of numbers, but with some logic involving lower keys. The TreeMap's keys are sorted, so for each number, it checks the lower key. If there's no lower key, it just increments the count of that number. Otherwise, it decreases the count of the lower key (removing it if it reaches zero) and then increments the current number's count. Finally, it sums all the values in the TreeMap to get the answer. The output of this first program is the sum, which would be the input for the second program?\n\nWait, but the second program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string (using nextLine()), not a number. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, and the second program expects a string? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The user said that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a string (since it uses nextLine()), so the first program's output must be a string. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So the second program would read that integer as a string? Like, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program reads \"5\" as the input string?\n\nWait, but the second program's code is expecting a string input (the s variable is a char array from nextLine()), so the first program's output must be a string that the second program can process. So the first program's output is a number, but the second program reads it as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program's input is \"123\", which is a string of three characters. So the second program processes that string.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is a number, which is written to the console, and the second program reads that as a string. So in the Fortran program, I need to first process the first part (the first Java program's logic), then pass its result to the second part (the second Java program's logic) without I/O in between.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the input for the first program (the initial input), process it through the first's logic, then take the result (the sum from the first program) and use that as the input for the second program's processing. The second program's processing requires a string, so the sum from the first must be converted into a string, then processed as per the second's logic, and finally output the result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst part (Java's first program):\n\nThe first program reads n, then n integers. It uses a TreeMap to track counts with some logic. The TreeMap is ordered, so in Fortran, I need a way to keep track of keys in sorted order. Since TreeMap in Java is a sorted map, in Fortran, perhaps an array or a list that's kept sorted. Alternatively, since the operations involve finding the lower key (the largest key less than the current number), maybe we can manage this with an array and keep it sorted, then perform a binary search to find the lower key.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations are a bit complex, maybe we can represent the map as an array of key-value pairs, and keep it sorted. Each time a new number comes in, we can search for the lower key (the largest key less than the current number). To do this efficiently, perhaps we can use a list and keep it sorted, so that we can perform a binary search.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, dynamic arrays are a bit tricky. Maybe we can use an array that's large enough, and track the current size. Let's think of the steps:\n\nInitialize an array for keys and counts. Let's say keys and counts arrays. Initially, they are empty. For each number in the input:\n\n- Find the largest key in keys that is less than the current number. If none, then proceed to add to the current number's count.\n\nWait, the logic in Java is:\n\nFor each num:\n\nif map.lowerKey(num) is null (no key less than num):\n\n   then, get the current count of num (default 0), increment by 1, and put into the map.\n\nelse:\n\n   key = lowerKey(num)\n\n   val = map.get(key)\n\n   if val ==1, remove the key (so decrease count to 0 and remove)\n\n   else, decrease val by 1 and put back.\n\n   then, for the current num, get its current count (default 0), increment by 1, and put into the map.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if there exists a key less than num. If not, then just increment num's count.\n\n2. If there is, then decrease the count of that key (the lower key). If that key's count reaches zero, remove it.\n\n3. Then, increment the count of the current num.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of all counts in the map.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, the keys need to be kept in a sorted array so that we can find the lower key quickly. Let's think of using an array for keys and counts, and keep them sorted. Each time a new number comes in, we can perform a binary search on the keys array to find the largest key less than the current num.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\nInitialize keys and counts arrays. Let's say keys is an array of integers, and counts is an array of integers. We also need a variable to track the current size of the arrays (since they can grow).\n\nInitially, size =0.\n\nFor each num in the input (after reading n and the numbers):\n\n   perform a binary search on keys(1:size) to find the largest key less than num.\n\n   if not found (i.e., all keys are >= num, or size is 0):\n\n      then, check if num is already in keys. If yes, increment its count. If not, add it to keys and set count to 1.\n\n   else:\n\n      key = the found key (the lower key)\n\n      idx = position where key is found.\n\n      val = counts(idx)\n\n      if val ==1:\n\n          remove the key from keys and counts (so decrease size by 1, and shift elements if needed)\n\n      else:\n\n          counts(idx) = val -1\n\n      Now, handle the current num:\n\n      check if num is present in keys. If yes, increment its count. If not, add it to keys and set count to 1.\n\n      But after adding, we need to keep the keys sorted. So inserting into the correct position.\n\nWait, but inserting into a sorted array can be done by finding the insertion point via binary search again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to keep the keys array unsorted, but that would make the binary search impossible. So the keys must be kept in sorted order.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex. Let's think of the steps again.\n\nFirst, for each num:\n\n1. Find the lower key (the largest key less than num). To do this, we can perform a binary search on the keys array (which is kept sorted).\n\n   Let's say the keys array is sorted in ascending order.\n\n   The binary search would find the insertion point for num, and the previous index would be the lower key.\n\n   For example, if the keys are [1,3,5], and num is 4, the insertion point is 2 (since 3 <4 <5), so the lower key is 3 at index 1.\n\n   If the insertion point is 0, then there is no lower key.\n\n   So the binary search can give us the index where the lower key is located.\n\n   So, the steps for finding the lower key:\n\n   - perform binary search to find the first key >= num. The index before that is the lower key's index.\n\n   - if all keys are less than num, then the lower key is the last element.\n\n   Wait, perhaps better to use a standard binary search approach.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach for the binary search:\n\nInitialize low=1, high=size.\n\nInitialize pos =0 (the position where the lower key is found).\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)/2\n\n   if keys(mid) < num:\n\n       pos = mid\n\n       low = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\nAt the end, if pos is 0, then no lower key exists. Else, the lower key is keys(pos).\n\nWait, let me test this logic.\n\nSuppose keys are [1,3,5], num=4.\n\nlow=1, high=3.\n\nmid=2 (keys(2)=3 <4 \u2192 pos=2, low=3.\n\nNext iteration: low=3, high=3.\n\nmid=3 \u2192 keys(3)=5 >=4 \u2192 high=2. Loop ends.\n\npos is 2 \u2192 which is correct (3 is the lower key).\n\nAnother example: num=0. Then, all keys are larger. So during the first iteration, mid=2 (keys(2)=3 >=0 \u2192 high=1.\n\nmid=1 (keys(1)=1 >=0 \u2192 high=0. Loop ends. pos remains 0 (since initially pos=0, and first mid was 2, but in first step, low=1, high=3, mid=2, keys(2)=3 <0? No, 3 is not less than 0. Wait, in this case, num is 0, so keys(1)=1 is greater than 0. So the first mid is 2 (keys(2)=3 >=0 \u2192 so high becomes 1.\n\nThen mid is (1+1)/2=1. keys(1)=1 >=0 \u2192 high becomes 0. So loop ends. pos remains 0. So no lower key exists.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo this binary search approach can find the position of the lower key.\n\nOnce we have the lower key (if exists), then we process it as per the Java code.\n\nNow, after processing the lower key (if exists), we need to add the current num to the map.\n\nAdding the current num:\n\nWe need to check if it's already present in the keys array. To do this, we can perform another binary search to find the index where num is located.\n\nIf found, increment its count.\n\nIf not found, insert it into the keys array at the correct position to maintain sorted order, and set its count to 1.\n\nSo inserting into the keys array requires shifting elements if necessary.\n\nThis is manageable but requires some array manipulation.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, but we can use allocatable arrays and reallocate as needed. Let's see.\n\nWe can start with an initial size, say 1000, and increase as needed. Alternatively, since the problem's constraints are not given, but in programming competition problems, n can be up to 1e5 or so. But since the first program's input is n numbers, perhaps n is up to 1e5. So the keys array could be up to n elements in the worst case (if all numbers are unique and no deletions). So maybe we can start with an array of size, say, 1e5, and dynamically reallocate if needed. But in Fortran, handling dynamic arrays can be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is for code submission, perhaps we can use a large enough array. Let's assume that the maximum possible keys is 1e5, so we can allocate arrays of size 1e5.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of using linked lists, but that's more complex in Fortran.\n\nHmm, perhaps the easiest way is to use an array for keys and counts, and keep track of the current size. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, read n, then read n numbers.\n\nInitialize keys and counts arrays. Let's say:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\ninteger :: size =0, max_size = 100000\n\nallocate(keys(max_size), counts(max_size))\n\nThen, for each num in the input:\n\n   perform the binary search to find the lower key.\n\n   process the lower key if exists.\n\n   then, process the current num.\n\nProcessing the lower key:\n\nIf there is a lower key (pos >0):\n\n   key = keys(pos)\n\n   val = counts(pos)\n\n   if val ==1:\n\n       remove the key from the keys and counts arrays.\n\n       (so, shift all elements from pos+1 to end left by one, and decrease size by 1)\n\n   else:\n\n       counts(pos) = val -1\n\nThen, process the current num:\n\n   perform a binary search to find if num is present in keys.\n\n   Let's do another binary search for this.\n\n   Initialize low=1, high=size (after processing the lower key, the size may have changed?)\n\nWait, after processing the lower key, the size may have decreased (if we removed the key). So the keys array's current size is the variable 'size'.\n\nWait, the 'size' variable tracks the current number of elements in the keys and counts arrays.\n\nSo after processing the lower key, the size may have decreased.\n\nSo, for the current num, we need to check if it's present in the current keys array (size elements).\n\nSo, to check if num is present:\n\n   perform a binary search on keys(1:size) to see if num exists.\n\n   Let's do that:\n\n   low =1, high = size\n\n   found =0\n\n   pos2 =0\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high)/2\n\n       if keys(mid) == num:\n\n           found =1\n\n           pos2 = mid\n\n           exit\n\n       else if keys(mid) < num:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   if found ==1:\n\n       counts(pos2) = counts(pos2) +1\n\n   else:\n\n       need to insert num into the keys array at the correct position.\n\n       The insertion position is where keys(insert_pos) < num and keys(insert_pos+1) >= num, or at the end.\n\n       To find the insertion position, perhaps another binary search.\n\n       Alternatively, since the keys are sorted, the insertion point can be found via the same method as before.\n\n       Let me think: the insertion point is the first index where keys(i) >= num. The position to insert is before that index.\n\n       So, similar to the first binary search but looking for the first key >= num.\n\n       Let me do that:\n\n       low =1, high = size\n\n       insert_pos = size +1\n\n       while low <= high:\n\n           mid = (low + high)/2\n\n           if keys(mid) >= num:\n\n               insert_pos = mid\n\n               high = mid -1\n\n           else:\n\n               low = mid +1\n\n       So, the insertion position is insert_pos.\n\n       So, we need to insert num at position insert_pos.\n\n       So, shift all elements from insert_pos to the end (up to size) to the right by one, then insert num at insert_pos, and increment size.\n\n       But since the array is allocated with max_size, as long as size < max_size, this is okay.\n\n       So:\n\n       if size +1 > max_size:\n\n           ! need to reallocate, but perhaps we can assume max_size is sufficient.\n\n       do i = size, insert_pos, -1\n\n           keys(i+1) = keys(i)\n\n           counts(i+1) = counts(i)\n\n       end do\n\n       keys(insert_pos) = num\n\n       counts(insert_pos) =1\n\n       size = size +1\n\nWait, but this is a lot of steps. Also, in Fortran, loops can be written, but this might be a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a list-like structure with dynamic arrays, but in Fortran, it's manageable with the allocatable arrays and reallocation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a linked list approach, but that's more complex.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut before proceeding, let me think of the steps again.\n\nThe first part's logic is quite involved. Let me see if there's a smarter way to represent the TreeMap in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a hash map, but Fortran doesn't have built-in hash maps. So the sorted array approach is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, since the keys are kept in a sorted array, the binary search approach is manageable.\n\nNow, moving on to the second Java program (atcoder_ABC129_E):\n\nThis program reads a string (s) and computes some DP based on the characters. The DP is a 2D array of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of the string. The transitions depend on whether the current character is '0' or '1', and the DP states track something like the number of valid sequences.\n\nThe final output is (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) mod 1e9+7.\n\nIn the original sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is the input string for the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's answer (the sum), we need to convert that integer into a string, then process it as the input string for the second part's DP.\n\nSo the second part's processing is on the string representation of the first's answer.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after computing the first part's answer (ans), we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the DP.\n\nNow, the second part's DP:\n\nThe DP array is of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of the string. The initial condition is dp[0][0] =1.\n\nThe transitions are a bit complex. Let me parse the Java code:\n\nThe code loops over each character in the string (s[i]).\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, there's another block:\n\nif s[i] is '0':\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M\n\n   mod again.\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M\n\n   then mod both.\n\nWait, the code in Java has some nested conditions. Let me re-express the code:\n\nThe first part of the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nThen, after that, another block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse the code step by step.\n\nThe first part of the loop:\n\nThe first if-else block sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] based on the current character.\n\nThen, the second if-else block adds more to the dp values.\n\nWait, the code is structured as:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    if s[i] is '0':\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n    else:\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\n    // Then:\n\n    if s[i] is '0':\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n        mod again.\n\n    else:\n\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n        mod both.\n\nWait, so the first part of the loop (the first if-else) sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], and then the second part adds more to them.\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first block sets dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the previous values. Then, in the second block (since s[i] is '0'), it adds (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1].\n\nSo the total for dp[i+1][1] would be dp[i][1] (from first block) plus (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 total 3*dp[i][1] mod M?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFirst block (s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nThen, second block (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so total becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1], mod M.\n\nWait, but the code uses +=, so yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the first part sets the base, and the second part adds more.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me re-express the code's logic for each character:\n\nCase 1: current character is '0'\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nSecond part (since it's '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so dp[i+1][1] becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1]\n\nThen mod M.\n\nCase 2: current character is '1'\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\ndp[i+1][0] remains whatever? Wait, no. The first part's else clause only sets dp[i+1][1], but what about dp[i+1][0]?\n\nAh, in the first part's else clause (when s[i] is '1'), the code only sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] undefined? Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nIn the first part's else clause (s[i] is '1'):\n\nThe code sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, but what about dp[i+1][0]?\n\nThe code doesn't set it, so it would retain whatever value it had before. But in the first part's code, the first block (if s[i] is '0') sets both, but the else block only sets dp[i+1][1]. So in the else case (s[i] is '1'), the first part leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before (probably 0?), but that's not correct.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nSo in the else case (s[i] is '1'), the code only sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before. But in Java, arrays are initialized to 0, so perhaps the initial values are 0, but in the first iteration, dp[0][0] is 1, and dp[0][1] is 0.\n\nWait, the initial condition is dp[0][0] =1, others are 0.\n\nSo for the first iteration (i=0), if s[0] is '1', then the first part sets dp[1][1] to (1 +0) mod M =1, and dp[1][0] remains 0 (since it wasn't set).\n\nThen, in the second part of the loop (the else clause for s[i] is '1'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 so dp[1][0] becomes 0 + (1 *2) mod M \u2192 2 mod M.\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 which was 1, so adding 0*2 \u2192 1 +0 \u2192 1 mod M.\n\nWait, but the first part set dp[1][1] to 1, then the second part adds (0 *2) \u2192 so total 1.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nIn the first part (s[0] is '1'):\n\ndp[1][1] = (1 +0) mod M \u2192 1.\n\ndp[1][0] remains 0 (since not set).\n\nThen, in the second part (since s[0] is '1'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] (which is dp[1][0]) += (dp[i][0] *2) \u2192 0 + (1 *2) \u2192 2 mod M.\n\ndp[i+1][1] (which is 1) += (dp[i][1] *2 \u2192 0 *2 \u2192 0 \u2192 so remains 1.\n\nThen mod both.\n\nSo after the second part, dp[1][0] is 2, dp[1][1] is 1.\n\nHmm, okay. So the code's logic is a bit involved, but in Fortran, we can replicate this.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire Fortran program must read the input for the first part (n followed by n integers), process them through the first's logic to get the answer (ans), then convert ans to a string, then process that string through the second's DP, and output the final result.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the n integers.\n\n2. Process them through the first part's logic (the TreeMap equivalent) to compute ans.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string (e.g., using write and read to a character variable).\n\n4. Process the string through the second part's DP.\n\n5. Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's processing.\n\nImplementing the first part in Fortran:\n\nWe need to read n, then n integers. Then process each number as per the TreeMap logic.\n\nLet me outline the variables:\n\ninteger :: n, num, ans\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\ninteger :: size =0, pos, pos2, insert_pos, val, key, M =1000000007\n\nWait, but M is for the second part.

to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, the length of s is len_trim(s).\n\nNow, the second part's processing.\n\nThe second part's DP requires a string s, which is the string representation of ans.\n\nThe DP array is (n+1)x2, where n is the length of s.\n\nIn Fortran, we can allocate a 2D array for dp.\n\ninteger, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: dp(0:len_s, 0:1)\n\ndp(0,0) =1\n\ndp(0,1) =0\n\ndo i=0, len_s-1\n\n   character :: c = s(i+1:i+1)  ! since Fortran is 1-based\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n       dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n\n   else\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! second part of the loop\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2*dp(i,1), M)\n\n   else\n\n       dp(i+1,0) = mod(dp(i+1,0) + 2*dp(i,0), M)\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2*dp(i,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThe final result is mod(dp(len_s,0) + dp(len_s,1), M)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after all the steps, they do:\n\nSystem.out.println((dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) % M);\n\nSo in Fortran, the final result is (dp(len_s,0) + dp(len_s,1)) mod M.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based indices by declaring the array with lower bounds.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based for the DP array.\n\nWait, in the code above, the DP is declared as dp(0:len_s, 0:1), which is allowed in Fortran with explicit shaping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use 1-based indices for the string.\n\nWait, let me adjust the code:\n\nThe string s is of length len_s = len_trim(s).\n\nLoop over each character from 1 to len_s:\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   ... \n\nBut in the DP, the indices would be from 1 to len_s.\n\nWait, perhaps better to adjust the indices to start at 1.\n\nLet me rework the DP part:\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: dp(0:len_s, 0:1)  ! assuming 0-based for the steps.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++), so the indices go from 0 to n-1, and the DP is up to n.\n\nIn Fortran, if we have len_s = length of s, then the loop runs from i=0 to len_s-1 (assuming 0-based), but in Fortran arrays can be 0-based if declared so.\n\nAlternatively, let's use 1-based for the loop:\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: dp(1:len_s+1, 1:2)  ! assuming 1-based indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based for the DP indices to match the Java code.\n\nIn Fortran, you can declare arrays with lower bounds:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len_s, 0:1) :: dp\n\nThen, the initial condition is dp(0,0)=1, dp(0,1)=0.\n\nThen, loop over i from 0 to len_s-1:\n\n   c = s(i+1:i+1)  ! since s is 1-based in Fortran.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the code step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's use 1-based for the string and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me proceed with the code as follows:\n\nAfter converting ans to s:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate(dp(0:len_s, 0:1))\n\ndp(0,0) =1\n\ndp(0,1) =0\n\ndo i=0, len_s-1\n\n   c = s(i+1:i+1)  ! because s is 1-based, so the first character is s(1)\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n       dp(i+1,0) = dp(i,0)\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n\n   else\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i,0) + dp(i,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! second part\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2*dp(i,1), M)\n\n   else\n\n       dp(i+1,0) = mod(dp(i+1,0) + 2*dp(i,0), M)\n\n       dp(i+1,1) = mod(dp(i+1,1) + 2*dp(i,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nresult = mod(dp(len_s,0) + dp(len_s,1), M)\n\nThen, print result.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut there are some details to handle, like the initial allocation of keys and counts arrays.\n\nAlso, in the first part's processing, the keys and counts arrays may need to be reallocated if they exceed max_size. But assuming max_size is 1e5, which is sufficient for programming competition problems.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program starts with reading n and the numbers.\n\nThen, process the first part.\n\nThen, convert ans to a string.\n\nThen process the second part.\n\nNow, the full code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, num, ans, i, j, pos, pos2, insert_pos, val, key, M = 1000000007\n\n   integer, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\n   integer :: size =0, max_size = 100000\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: len_s, result\n\n   !

The binary search loops in the first part must be properly implemented. The variables like low, high, mid are declared inside the loops, but in Fortran, variables declared inside a do loop are allowed, but need to be properly scoped.\n\nWait, in the first part's code, variables like low, high, mid are declared inside the do loop? No, in the code I wrote above, they are declared inside the do loop for each iteration. Wait, no, in the code I wrote, for example:\n\n      low =1\n\n      high = size\n\n      pos =0\n\n      do while (low <= high)\n\n          mid = (low + high)/2\n\n          if (keys(mid) < num) then\n\n              pos = mid\n\n              low = mid +1\n\n          else\n\n              high = mid -1\n\n          end if\n\n      end do\n\nHere, low, high, mid are variables declared in the outer scope? Or are they local?\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So in the code above, variables like low, high, mid, pos, etc., need to be declared before the loop.\n\nAh, this is a problem. In the code I wrote earlier, I didn't declare these variables. So I need to add declarations for all variables used in the first part.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nFirst, in the first part's code, variables like low, high, mid, pos, pos2, insert_pos, found, etc., need to be declared.\n\nSo, inside the first part's processing loop (the do i=1, n loop), we need to declare these variables.\n\nAlternatively, declare them at the beginning of the program.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\nInside the program:\n\n   integer :: n, num, ans, i, j, pos, pos2, insert_pos, val, key, M = 1000000007\n\n   integer, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\n   integer :: size =0, max_size = 100000\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: len_s, result\n\n   ! Declare variables used in loops\n\n   integer :: low, high, mid, found\n\n   !

Compute ans\n\n   ans =0\n\n   do i=1, size\n\n      ans = ans + counts(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! ... rest of the code ...\n\nThis way, variables like low, high, mid, found are declared at the beginning.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part's processing, when we remove a key (when val ==1), we shift the elements from pos to size-1. The loop is:\n\ndo j = pos, size-1\n\n   keys(j) = keys(j+1)\n\n   counts(j) = counts(j+1)\n\nend do\n\nThis is correct because after the loop, the elements from pos to size-1 are replaced by the next elements, effectively removing the element at pos.\n\nNow, testing for possible errors:\n\n- The keys array must be kept sorted after each insertion and deletion. The binary searches rely on this.\n\n- The insertion and deletion steps must maintain the sorted order.\n\n- The DP part must correctly handle the string derived from ans.\n\nAnother possible issue is the size of the keys array. If the initial max_size is too small (e.g., if n is larger than 1e5), the code will fail. But given that the problem's constraints are not specified, assuming max_size is sufficient.\n\nNow, the final code should look like this, with all variables properly declared and the logic as described.\n\nI think this should work. Now, I'll write the final Fortran code accordingly."
