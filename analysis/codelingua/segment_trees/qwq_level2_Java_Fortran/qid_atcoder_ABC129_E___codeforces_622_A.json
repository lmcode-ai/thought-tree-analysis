    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string from input, processes it using a dynamic programming approach, and outputs a number modulo 1e9+7. The second program (codeforces_622_A) reads a long integer, does some calculations involving sequences, and outputs another number. The output of the first program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first compute the first's result, then use that as input to the second's logic, and output the final result.\n\nHmm, but how do I chain them in Fortran without I/O in between? The key is to compute the first part's result, store it in a variable, then pass that variable to the second part's computation. The first part's input comes from the user, and the final output is the second part's result.\n\nLet me look at the first Java program's code. It reads a string, processes it with DP. The DP array is 2D, size (n+1)x2. The transitions are a bit complex. Let me see:\n\nThe first loop goes through each character of the string. Depending on whether the current character is '0' or not, it updates the DP arrays. The final output is (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) mod M, where M is 1e9+7.\n\nThe second Java program takes a long 'position', finds the nearest sequence start index, and calculates the answer based on that. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. The solve function uses a loop to find where the position falls in the sequence.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the input string (from the user) for the first part.\n2. Compute the first part's result (the DP calculation).\n3. Use that result as the input to the second part's calculation (the position variable in the second Java program).\n4. Output the final result from the second part.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part in Fortran. The string input can be read as a character array. The DP array in Java is int[n+1][2], so in Fortran, maybe an integer array of size (n+1, 2). Since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code starts at 0, I need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1, and the DP is from 0 to n. So in Fortran, perhaps the array is (0:n, 0:1) but since Fortran starts at 1, maybe we can shift indices. Alternatively, use 1-based arrays but adjust the loops. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, declare the DP array as (n+1, 2), with indices from 1 to n+1 for the first dimension, and 1 to 2 for the second. Then, the initial condition dp[0][0] =1 would be dp(1,1) =1. The loops would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nint n = s.length;\nint[][] dp = new int[n + 1][2];\ndp[0][0] = 1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    ... processing s[i], which is s's 0-based index.\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the string can be read as a character array of length n. Let's say s is a character array of length n, with indices 1 to n (since Fortran is 1-based). So s(1) corresponds to the first character.\n\nThen, the DP array in Fortran would be dp(0:n, 1:2), but since Fortran arrays start at 1, perhaps better to use dp(1 to n+1, 1 to 2). So dp(1,1) =1 (since dp[0][0] in Java is 1). Then for each i from 1 to n (since the loop runs n times, for each character in s), the current character is s(i).\n\nWait, the loop in Java is for i from 0 to n-1, so in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to n, with i being the current position in the string (since s in Fortran is 1-based). So the first iteration (i=1 in Fortran) corresponds to the first character (Java's i=0).\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be do i = 1, n\n\nInside the loop, the code checks if s(i) is '0' or not, then updates the dp array.\n\nThe DP transitions are a bit involved. Let me parse the code step by step.\n\nFirst part of the loop:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nWait, but then there's another block after that:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n}\n\nHmm, so the first part of the code (the first if-else) sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second if-else adds more to them. So in Fortran, I need to structure this correctly.\n\nWait, in Java, the first block sets the initial values, then the second block adds to them. So in code:\n\nFor example, if s[i] is '0', then first block sets dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]. Then the second block (since s[i] is '0') adds (dp[i][1] *2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would need to first compute the initial values, then apply the second part.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nFirst, handle the first part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n    dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)  ! dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0] (Java's 0 is first element here)\n    dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)  ! dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i,1) + dp(i,2)) mod M\n\nThen, handle the second part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n    temp = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n    dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp) mod M\n\nelse:\n\n    temp0 = (dp(i,1) * 2) mod M\n    temp1 = (dp(i,2) * 2) mod M\n    dp(i+1,1) = (dp(i+1,1) + temp0) mod M\n    dp(i+1,2) = (dp(i+1,2) + temp1) mod M\n\nWait, but in the else part of the second block, the code adds to both dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1]. So in Fortran, the first part of the code (the first if-else) sets the initial values, then the second if-else adds to them.\n\nWait, in the else part of the second block (when s[i] is not '0'), the code adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. But wait, in the first part of the code (the first else), when s[i] is not '0', the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M. Then, in the second else, adding (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, the code in Java for the second else:\n\nelse {\n    dp[i + 1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i + 1][0] %= M;\n    dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n}\n\nSo the += is adding to the existing values. So in the first part of the code (the first else), the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M. Then, in the second else, the code adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], and (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. But the first part of the first else didn't set dp[i+1][0], so that would be 0? Wait, no, in the first else block (when s[i] is not '0'), the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? Wait, no, in the first else block, the first part (the first if-else) only sets dp[i+1][1], but what about dp[i+1][0]?\n\nWait, in the first part of the code (the first if-else):\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nSo in the else case (s[i] is not '0'), the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before. Wait, but in Java, arrays are initialized to 0, so maybe in the first else, dp[i+1][0] remains 0? Or is there an implicit initialization?\n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is initialized to all 0s. So when the first part is the else clause (s[i] is not '0'), then the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, but dp[i+1][0] remains 0 (since it wasn't set in the first part). Then, in the second part (the second else clause), the code adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], so that would set it to (0 + (dp[i][0] *2) mod M). \n\nHmm, so in the first else case (s[i] is not '0'), the first part sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0. Then, in the second else clause (since s[i] is not '0'), the code adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], so the final value of dp[i+1][0] is (dp[i][0] *2) mod M. \n\nWait, but in the first part of the code (the first else), the first part sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0. Then, in the second else clause, the code adds (dp[i][0] *2) to dp[i+1][0], so the final value is (0 + (dp[i][0] *2 mod M)) mod M. \n\nSo in Fortran, I need to make sure that the first part of the code (the first if-else) sets the initial values, and then the second part adds to them. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me try to structure this in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\n- The input string s is read as a character array. Let's say s is a character array of length n.\n\n- The DP array is declared as an integer array of size (n+1, 2), with modulo 1e9+7. Since Fortran uses 1-based indices, dp(1,1) corresponds to dp[0][0] in Java, and dp(1,2) is dp[0][1].\n\nInitialize dp(1,1) = 1, and dp(1,2) =0 (since Java initializes to 0).\n\nThen, loop over each character in s (from 1 to n):\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nFirst part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n    dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n    dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n\nelse:\n\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n    temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\n\nelse:\n\n    temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n    temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n    dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n\nWait, but in the else part of the second block (when current_char is not '0'), the first part of the code (the first else) set dp(i+1,2) to (dp(i,1)+dp(i,2)) mod M, and dp(i+1,1) was 0 (since it wasn't set in the first part). Then, in the second else, adding temp0 (dp(i,1)*2 mod M) to dp(i+1,1) (which was 0) gives dp(i+1,1) = temp0 mod M. \n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the second else part would be:\n\ntemp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\ntemp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\ndp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, after processing all characters, the result is (dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2)) mod M. That's the first part's output, which is the input to the second program.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program. The second program takes a long integer (the output of the first program) and computes the answer based on that.\n\nThe second Java program's solve function does the following:\n\n1. Read position from input (which in our case is the first program's output).\n\n2. Find the nearest sequence start index (nrstSeqStartIndx) such that the value at that index is less than or equal to position, but doubling the index until the value is too big.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nlong nrstSeqStartIndx = 1;\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n}\n\nThen, it increments nrstSeqStartIndx until the next value is beyond position.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2;\n}\n\nThis is to find the largest power of two where the value is still less than position. Then, the next step is to find the exact starting index.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nThis increments nrstSeqStartIndx until the next value exceeds position. So the final nrstSeqStartIndx is the starting index of the sequence where the position falls.\n\nThen, the start index is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the answer is (position - start) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's code would take the first part's result (the computed value from the first program) as the 'position' variable, then compute the answer as follows.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nGiven position (the first part's output):\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *= 2\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx +=1\n\nCompute startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nReturn result.\n\nNow, the getValueAtIndex function is straightforward: 1 + (index-1)*index/2. Since in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we need to ensure that it's integer division. Since (index-1)*index is even (since it's n*(n-1)), so dividing by 2 is okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (the DP calculation).\n\n3. Use that result as the 'position' variable for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, let's think about data types. The first part's result can be up to (1e9+7)^something, but since it's mod 1e9+7, it's up to 1e9+6. So in Fortran, using integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(9)) would be better to handle large numbers. The second part's position is up to 1e9+6, but the calculations in the second part can involve very large numbers (since getValueAtIndex can be up to very large indices). So for the second part, variables like nrstSeqStartIndx and position should be 64-bit integers (integer(8)).\n\nIn Fortran, integers can be declared with kind parameters. Let's use integer(8) for all variables involved in the second part.\n\nNow, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, read the input string. In Fortran, reading a string can be done with read(*,*) s, but the length may vary. Alternatively, read a line into a character array. Let's use a character array of sufficient length, say 100000 (since the first Java program's input is a string, but the problem may have constraints on the length. Since the first Java code uses nextLine(), the input is a single line. So in Fortran, we can read the entire line into a character array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read a line, we can use a read statement with an asterisk, but that may stop at whitespace. Alternatively, use a list-directed read, but that's not reliable. Alternatively, use the GET command with a unit, but perhaps the best way is to read the entire line into a character variable.\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread(*,'(a)') s\n\nThen, the length of the string is len_trim(s). So n = len_trim(s).\n\nThen, the DP array can be declared as integer(8), dimension(0:n, 2). Wait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. Alternatively, to make it easier, let's use 1-based indices. So the DP array is (n+1, 2). The first element (1,1) corresponds to dp[0][0], etc.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate a DP array of (n+1, 2) as integer(8). Since the maximum value is 1e9+7, which is about 1e9, so 8-byte integers are okay.\n\nInitialize dp(1,1) = 1, dp(1,2) =0.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i:i)\n\nThen proceed as per the logic above.\n\nAfter processing all characters, the result of the first part is (dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2)) mod 1000000007.\n\nThen, this value is the 'position' for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nposition = (dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2)) mod 1000000007\n\nThen compute the answer as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nNow, implementing the second part's loops:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n\nloop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nThen, loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position:\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nCompute startIndex = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*nrstSeqStartIndx /2\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nPrint result.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since (nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*nrstSeqStartIndx is even, it's okay.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the getValueAtIndex function can be a function in Fortran:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1 + (index -1)*index /2\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can be inline. Alternatively, compute it inline.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: n\n    integer(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n    integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result\n    integer(8) :: i, current_char_code\n\n    !

Process the first part\n    do i = 1, n\n        current_char = s(i:i)\n        if (current_char == '0') then\n            ! First part of the first if-else\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n            dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n        else\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\n        end if\n\n        ! Second part\n        if (current_char == '0') then\n            ! Add to dp(i+1,2)\n            temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\n        else\n            temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n            temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    position = mod( dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2), M )\n\n    ! Now process the second part\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*nrstSeqStartIndx /2\n    result = (position - startIndex) +1\n\n    print *, result\n\ncontains\n    integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n        getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index -1)*index /2\n    end function\nend program\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, I need to use the current character. Let me check the variables again.\n\nWait, in the code above, I have:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i:i)\n\nBut in Fortran, to get the character at position i, it's s(i:i). So that's correct.\n\nThen, the first part of the first if-else is handled correctly.\n\nWait, but in the first part of the code (the first if-else), when the character is '0', the first part sets dp(i+1,1) and dp(i+1,2) to the previous values. Then, in the second part (the second if-else), when the character is '0', we add to dp(i+1,2).\n\nWait, in the code above, the first part of the first if-else is:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n    dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n    dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\nelse\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\nend if\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n    temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\nelse\n    temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n    temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n    dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n    dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\nend if\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part of the first else clause (when the character is not '0'), the first part sets dp(i+1,2) to (dp(i,1)+dp(i,2)) mod M. Then, in the second else clause (since the character is not '0'), we add temp0 and temp1 to dp(i+1,1) and dp(i+1,2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the variables temp, temp0, temp1 need to be declared. Oh right, in the code above, I didn't declare them. So I need to add variables for those.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, I have:\n\ntemp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n\nBut temp is not declared. So I need to declare temp as an integer(8) variable inside the loop.\n\nHmm, so inside the loop, perhaps:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    current_char = s(i:i)\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n        dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n        dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n    else\n        dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\n    end if\n\n    ! Second part\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n        temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n        dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\n    else\n        temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n        temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n        dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n        dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut variables temp, temp0, temp1 need to be declared. So perhaps declare them inside the loop, or before the loop.\n\nAlternatively, declare them as integer(8) variables before the loop.\n\nSo adding:\n\ninteger(8) :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nbefore the loop.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. So in the main program, after the declarations of the other variables, add:\n\ninteger(8) :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nThen, inside the loop, use them.\n\nAlternatively, compute the mod inline without variables, but that might be more code.\n\nAlternatively, compute the terms directly.\n\nWait, for the first case (current_char is '0') in the second part:\n\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + mod( dp(i,2)*2, M ), M )\n\nBut that would be:\n\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + mod( 2*dp(i,2), M ), M )\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + (2*dp(i,2)) mod M, M )\n\nBut in Fortran, mod(a,b) is the remainder, so mod(2*dp(i,2), M) is okay.\n\nSo perhaps we can inline the temp variables.\n\nLet me try rewriting the code without temp variables:\n\nIn the second part when current_char is '0':\n\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + mod( 2*dp(i,2), M ), M )\n\nSimilarly for the else case:\n\ntemp0 = mod(2*dp(i,1), M)\ntemp1 = mod(2*dp(i,2), M)\ndp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n\nBut to inline:\n\ndp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + mod(2*dp(i,1), M ), M )\ndp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + mod(2*dp(i,2), M ), M )\n\nBut this might be more efficient without variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use variables to make it clearer.\n\nBut for code brevity, let's proceed with variables.\n\nSo adding the variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: temp, temp0, temp1\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nWait, what if the input string is \"0\"?\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=1.\n\nProcessing first character (i=1):\n\ncurrent_char is '0'.\n\nFirst part:\n\nsince it's '0', set dp(2,1)=dp(1,1)=1, dp(2,2)=dp(1,2)=0.\n\nSecond part:\n\nsince '0', compute temp = mod(0*2, M) =0. So dp(2,2) becomes 0 +0 =0 mod M.\n\nSo dp(2,1)=1, dp(2,2)=0.\n\nTotal is 1+0=1 mod M =1.\n\nThen, the second part's position is 1.\n\nNow, compute the second part:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2. Since 2 <1? No, because position is 1. So the loop condition (getValueAtIndex(2) <1) is false. So the first loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ncheck getValueAtIndex(1+1)=getValueAtIndex(2)=2. Is 2 <=1? No. So the loop doesn't run. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nstartIndex = 1 + (1-1)*1/2 =1.\n\nresult = (1-1)+1 =1. Which is correct, since the first sequence starts at 1, and position 1 is the first element.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see the first Java program's sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps the first Java program's sample input is not given, but let's think of a simple case.\n\nSuppose the input is \"1\".\n\nThen, n=1.\n\nProcessing i=1 (char '1'):\n\nFirst part (else clause):\n\ndp(2,2) = (dp(1,1) + dp(1,2)) mod M \u2192 (1+0)=1 mod M.\n\nSecond part (else clause):\n\ntemp0 = mod(2*1, M)=2, temp1=mod(0*2, M)=0.\n\ndp(2,1) = 0 (initial value from first part's else clause, which didn't set it) +2 \u2192 2 mod M.\n\ndp(2,2) =1 +0 \u21921 mod M.\n\nWait, wait, in the first part's else clause, the first part sets dp(2,2) to 1, and dp(2,1) remains 0 (since first part's else clause only sets dp[i+1][1] in Java's terms, which is dp(2,2) here). Then, in the second else clause, adding temp0 (2) to dp(2,1) (which was 0) gives 2 mod M. So dp(2,1)=2, dp(2,2)=1.\n\nTotal is 2+1=3 mod M \u21923.\n\nSo the position is 3.\n\nThen, the second part's calculation:\n\nposition=3.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) =2. 2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\nNow, check getValueAtIndex(4) \u21921 +3*4/2 =1+6=7. 7 <3? No. So loop stops. So nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nNow, second loop:\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(3) \u21921 +2*3/2 =1+3=4. 4 <=3? No. So the loop doesn't run. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 2.\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(2) =2.\n\nresult =3-2 +1 =2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nWait, what's the sequence here?\n\nThe sequence is built as follows:\n\nThe sequence starts at index 1: value 1.\n\nIndex 2: 1+1=2.\n\nIndex 3: 1+2+3=6? Wait, no, the getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nWait, for index=2: 1 + (2-1)*2/2 \u21921+1=2.\n\nIndex=3: 1 + (3-1)*3/2 \u21921 + 3 \u21924.\n\nIndex=4: 1 + (4-1)*4/2 \u21921 +6 \u21927.\n\nSo for position=3, it's between index 2 (value 2) and index3 (4). So the starting index is 2 (value 2). The position 3 is the second element in the sequence starting at index2 (since 3-2+1=2). So the answer is 2, which matches.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nWait, also, in the first part's DP array, the initial allocation is:\n\nallocate(dp(n+1, 2))\n\nBut in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so dp(1,1) is the first element. The loop runs from i=1 to n, and the final result is dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2).\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: n\n    integer(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n    integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result\n    integer(8) :: i, temp, temp0, temp1\n\n    ! Read input string\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n    n = len_trim(s)\n\n    ! Allocate DP array\n    allocate(dp(n+1, 2))\n    dp = 0\n    dp(1,1) = 1\n\n    ! Process the first part\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n            ! First part of the first if-else\n            dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1)\n            dp(i+1,2) = dp(i,2)\n        else\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i,1) + dp(i,2), M )\n        end if\n\n        ! Second part\n        if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n            temp = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp, M )\n        else\n            temp0 = mod( dp(i,1)*2, M )\n            temp1 = mod( dp(i,2)*2, M )\n            dp(i+1,1) = mod( dp(i+1,1) + temp0, M )\n            dp(i+1,2) = mod( dp(i+1,2) + temp1, M )\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    position = mod( dp(n+1,1) + dp(n+1,2), M )\n\n    ! Now process the second part\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = 1 + (nrstSeqStartIndx -1)*nrstSeqStartIndx /2\n    result = (position - startIndex) +1\n\n    print *, result\n\ncontains\n    integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n        getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index -1)*index /2\n    end function\nend program\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, after the first if-else, the second part's code is executed. So the code is structured correctly.\n\nNow, check for possible off-by-one errors.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0\".\n\nFirst part's result is 1.\n\nSecond part's position is 1.\n\nThe code computes:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) =2. 2 <1? No. So loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, check getValueAtIndex(2) (since nrstSeqStartIndx is 1, so next is 2). The second loop's condition is getValueAtIndex(2) <=1? 2 <=1 \u2192 no. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nstartIndex is 1 \u2192 result is 1-1+1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"10\".\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first part's processing:\n\nn=2.\n\nFirst character '1' (i=1):\n\nFirst part (else clause):\n\ndp(2,2) = dp(1,1) + dp(1,2) \u21921+0=1 mod M.\n\nSecond part (else clause):\n\ntemp0 = 2*1 mod M \u21922.\n\ntemp1 = 2*0 mod M \u21920.\n\ndp(2,1) =0 +2 \u21922 mod M.\n\ndp(2,2) =1 +0 \u21921 mod M.\n\nSecond character '0' (i=2):\n\nFirst part (if clause):\n\ndp(3,1) = dp(2,1)=2.\n\ndp(3,2) = dp(2,2)=1.\n\nSecond part (if clause):\n\ntemp = mod( dp(2,2)*2, M ) \u21922*1 mod M \u21922.\n\ndp(3,2) =1 +2 \u21923 mod M.\n\nSo after processing both characters:\n\ndp(3,1)=2, dp(3,2)=3.\n\nTotal is 2+3=5 mod M \u21925.\n\nPosition is 5.\n\nSecond part:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) =2 <5 \u2192 yes. Multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(4) \u21921 +3*4/2 =7. 7 <5? No. So loop stops. nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nNow, check the second loop:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(3) \u21921 +2*3/2 \u21924. 4 <=5 \u2192 yes. So increment nrstSeqStartIndx to 3.\n\nCheck again: getValueAtIndex(4)=7 >5 \u2192 stop.\n\nNow, nrstSeqStartIndx is 3.\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(3) \u21924.\n\nresult =5-4 +1 =2.\n\nThe sequence for index3 starts at 4. Position5 is the second element (4+1=5 \u2192 2nd position).\n\nSo the output is 2, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
