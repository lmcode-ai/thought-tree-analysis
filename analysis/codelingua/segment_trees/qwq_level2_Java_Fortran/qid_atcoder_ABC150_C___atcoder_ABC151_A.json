    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this sequence of Java programs into a single Fortran program. Let me start by understanding what each Java file does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC150_C). It seems to generate all permutations of a number string from 1 to n, then checks two input strings against these permutations to compute a sum. The second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string and outputs the next character after the first character. Wait, but the second file's main method only prints the first character plus 1? That might be a typo, but I have to follow the code as given.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second. But looking at the first Java program's main method, it outputs Math.abs(sum). The second program's main reads a string (from input) and then prints the first character plus 1. Wait, but the second program's code is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe second Java program's main does:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo it reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. So if the first program outputs, say, \"123\", then the second program would take that as input, take the first character '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 to get 50 which is '2', and output \"2\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's behavior is: take input for the first program, process it to get a number (the absolute difference between the permutation indices of two strings), then that number is passed as input to the second program, which outputs the next character after the first digit of that number.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, which when converted to a string would be a sequence of digits. The second program takes that string, takes the first character (the first digit), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character.\n\nSo the overall process is:\n\nInput to first program (n and two lines of numbers) \u2192 compute the absolute difference between the permutation indices of the two input strings \u2192 output that number as a string \u2192 second program takes that string, takes first character, adds 1, outputs that character.\n\nNow, the task is to translate this entire sequence into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first Java program's input is read in Fortran's first part.\n- The second program's output is the final output of the Fortran program.\n- The intermediate steps (the first program's processing and the second's processing) must be done without I/O in between.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (n and the two lines of numbers).\n2. Compute the permutations and find the indices of the two input strings in the permutation list, compute the absolute difference of their indices (sum = |index1 - index2|).\n3. Then, take that sum (as a number), convert it to a string, take the first character (digit), add 1 to its ASCII value (or equivalent in Fortran), and output that character.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the sum is computed as follows: for each of the two lines (j from 0 to 1), it loops through all permutations. For each permutation, if it matches line[j][0], then if it's the first occurrence (sum is 0), add the index, else subtract. Since there are two lines, the first line's index is added, the second's subtracted, so sum = index1 - index2, then absolute value is taken. Wait, the code in the first Java program:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor each j (0 and 1):\n\n   for each permutation i:\n\n      if permutation matches line[j][0], then:\n\n          if sum is 0 (meaning first time, j=0?), add i to sum.\n\n          else (j=1?), subtract i from sum.\n\nSo sum = (index1) - (index2). Then the absolute value is printed.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nsum is initialized to 0.\n\nfor j in 0 to 1 (since line has length 2):\n\n   for each i in listA (permutations):\n\n      if listA.get(i) equals line[j][0], then:\n\n          if sum ==0, add i to sum (so first occurrence is the first line's index)\n\n          else subtract i (so second occurrence is subtracting the second line's index)\n\nSo sum = index1 - index2. Then the absolute value is printed.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is |index1 - index2|.\n\nThen the second program takes that number as a string, takes the first character (the first digit of the number), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead n, then two lines (each line is a string made by concatenating n numbers? Wait, looking at the first Java code's input handling:\n\nIn the first Java program's main:\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nn = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());\n\nThen line is a 2x1 array. For each i (0 and 1):\n\n   Arrays.fill(line[i], \"\"); // initializes the first element to empty string?\n\nThen for each j from 0 to n-1:\n\n   line[i][0] += scanner.next();\n\nSo for each of the two lines (i=0 and 1), the code reads n tokens and appends them to line[i][0]. So each line is a string formed by concatenating n numbers input as separate tokens. For example, if n=3 and the input lines are \"1 2 3\" and \"3 2 1\", then line[0][0] is \"123\" and line[1][0] is \"321\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the input is:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read two lines, each consisting of n numbers (as strings?), concatenated into a single string.\n\nWait, the Java code uses scanner.next() each time, so each token is a separate input. So for each of the two lines (i=0 and 1), the code loops n times, appending each next token to line[i][0]. So the two input lines are each a sequence of n tokens, which are concatenated into a single string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the input would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read two lines, each line has n tokens, which are concatenated into a single string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading lines can be done with read(*,*) but perhaps we need to read all the tokens for each line. Alternatively, read the entire line as a string and process it. Hmm, perhaps the easiest way is to read each line's tokens as a string array, then concatenate them.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps read the entire line as a string, then process it. But the exact input handling needs to be precise.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the first part must read the input:\n\nRead n, then read two lines, each consisting of n numbers (as strings?), concatenated into a single string.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the input for each line is n tokens, which are concatenated into a single string. So for example, if the user inputs for the first line: 1 2 3, then the string becomes \"123\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each of the two lines, we need to read n numbers (as strings) and concatenate them into a single string.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read two lines, each line has n numbers (as strings). So perhaps:\n\nRead the first line's n tokens into a character array, then concatenate them into a string.\n\nSame for the second line.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a single string, but split into tokens. But in Fortran, splitting strings can be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a string, then process it to remove spaces and get the concatenated string.\n\nWait, perhaps the user inputs each line as a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, so the entire line can be read as a string, then the spaces are stripped, and the characters are concatenated.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the scanner.next() reads each token (so each number is a token, possibly with leading or trailing spaces, but scanner.next() gets each token as a string, so for example, if the input line is \"1 2 3\", scanner.next() would get \"1\", then \"2\", then \"3\", and the line[i][0] becomes \"123\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each of the two lines, we can read the entire line as a string (including spaces), then process it to remove spaces and concatenate the characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each token one by one. Let's think of code steps.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen for each of the two lines:\n\n   Read a line, then process it to get the concatenated string.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps:\n\nRead the first line as a string, then process it to remove spaces and get the concatenated string.\n\nBut how to read the entire line? Using a read statement with an asterisk and a format that reads until end of line.\n\nAlternatively, using list-directed input, but that might not work for variable-length strings.\n\nAlternatively, using a character array of sufficient length, but that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, read each token one by one for each line.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to read each line's tokens as a list of characters, then concatenate them.\n\nWait, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nAfter reading n, for each of the two lines:\n\n   Read n characters, each as a string, and concatenate them.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading n numbers as strings can be done with a loop.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, for each of the two lines:\n\n   Initialize a character string of length n.\n\n   Do i = 1 to n:\n\n      Read a character (or a string) and append to the string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading individual characters can be done with read(*,*) but perhaps better to read each token as a string.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line as a string, then process it.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nSuppose for the first line:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: line1, line2\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*, '(a)') line1\n\nread(*, '(a)') line2\n\nThen, process line1 and line2 to remove spaces and get the concatenated string.\n\nWait, but the input lines may have spaces between the numbers. For example, if the user inputs \"1 2 3\" for the first line, then line1 would be \"1 2 3\", and we need to remove the spaces to get \"123\".\n\nSo, to process line1 into a string without spaces:\n\ninteger :: i, len1, len2\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s1, s2\n\ns1 = adjustl(line1)  ! remove leading spaces\n\nlen1 = len_trim(s1)\n\ns1 = s1(1:len1)\n\n! Now, remove spaces from s1:\n\ncharacter(len=len1) :: temp1\n\ninteger :: pos, count = 0\n\ntemp1 = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len1\n\n   if (s1(i:i) /= ' ') then\n\n      count = count + 1\n\n      temp1(count:count) = s1(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ns1 = temp1(1:count)\n\nSimilarly for s2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a loop to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to remove spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input lines are given without spaces, but the problem says the Java code uses scanner.next() which splits on whitespace, so the user can input the numbers separated by any whitespace, but the concatenated string is the numbers without spaces.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after reading the entire line as a string, we can process it to remove all spaces and get the concatenated string.\n\nOnce we have the two strings (s1 and s2), then we need to generate all permutations of the numbers 1 to n as strings, then find the indices of s1 and s2 in that list, compute the absolute difference, then pass that number to the second part.\n\nNow, the permutation part.\n\nThe first Java program uses a recursive permutation function. In Fortran, recursion can be done, but perhaps it's easier to generate all permutations iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, since n can be up to... Well, the problem's constraints for ABC150 C problem probably have n up to 10 or so, since permutations of n digits would be n! which for n=10 is 3.6 million, which is manageable.\n\nWait, the problem is from AtCoder, so let me recall: ABC150 C is \"Permutation\", which requires generating all permutations of 1..n and finding the positions of two given permutations. The constraints for that problem are n \u2264 10^5? No, that can't be. Wait, no, for permutation generation, n can't be that big. Looking up the problem, ABC150 C's constraints are n \u2264 10^5? Wait, no, probably n is small. Wait, the problem's actual constraints: the original problem (ABC150 C) has n up to 10^5? No, that's impossible for permutation generation. Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think: the problem is called \"Permutation\", and the task is to find the number of permutations between two given permutations. Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to the one where you have two permutations and you need to find their difference in lex order. But in any case, the code given here uses a recursive permutation generator, which would only work for small n (like up to 10, since 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable in memory, but 12! is over a billion, which is too big). So assuming n is small enough for this code to work, the Fortran code can handle it similarly.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to generate all permutations of the string \"123...n\", then find the indices of s1 and s2 in that list, compute the absolute difference, then proceed.\n\nWait, the first Java code's permutation function builds a list of all permutations in some order (probably lex order?), and the indices are based on that order.\n\nWait, the permutation function in Java is recursive, and the order in which permutations are added to the list depends on the recursion. Let's see:\n\nThe permutation function is called with target being the remaining characters, and ans being the accumulated string.\n\nThe base case is when target's length is 1: add ans + target.\n\nElse, for each i from 0 to target.length-1:\n\n   call permutation with target without the i-th character, and ans + target[i].\n\nThis is a standard recursive permutation generator, which generates permutations in lex order? Let's see:\n\nSuppose target is \"123\".\n\nFirst iteration i=0: take '1', then permute \"23\".\n\nIn the next step, for \"23\", i=0: take '2', then permute \"3\" \u2192 \"123\".\n\ni=1: take '3', then permute \"2\" \u2192 \"132\".\n\nThen back to the first level, i=1: take '2', then permute \"13\".\n\nThen for \"13\", i=0: take '1' \u2192 \"213\", etc.\n\nWait, the order in which permutations are generated is the same as the standard recursive approach, which produces permutations in lex order? Let me see for \"123\":\n\nThe first permutation would be \"123\", then \"132\", then \"213\", \"231\", \"312\", \"321\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first call for \"123\" (target length 3):\n\nLoop i from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0: call permutation with target \"23\", ans \"1\".\n\nThen in that call, for \"23\", i=0: call with target \"3\", ans \"12\" \u2192 adds \"123\".\n\ni=1: call with target \"2\", ans \"13\" \u2192 adds \"132\".\n\nThen back to the first level, i=1: target is \"13\", ans is \"2\".\n\nThen for \"13\", i=0: call with target \"3\", ans \"21\" \u2192 \"213\".\n\ni=1: call with target \"1\", ans \"23\" \u2192 \"231\".\n\nThen i=2 in the first level: target is \"12\", ans is \"3\".\n\nThen for \"12\", i=0: call with target \"2\", ans \"31\" \u2192 \"312\".\n\ni=1: call with target \"1\", ans \"32\" \u2192 \"321\".\n\nSo the order is 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321. Which is lex order.\n\nYes, so the permutations are generated in lex order. Therefore, the listA is the list of all permutations in lex order.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we need to generate all permutations of the digits 1 to n in lex order, then find the indices of s1 and s2 in that list.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n, read the two input strings s1 and s2 (after processing to remove spaces).\n\n2. Generate all permutations of the string \"123...n\" in lex order.\n\n3. Find the indices (starting from 0?) of s1 and s2 in the permutation list.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the listA is built by adding permutations in the order generated, so the first permutation is at index 0, next 1, etc. So the indices are 0-based.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for (int i = 0; i < listA.size(); i++) loops over all elements, so the index is 0-based.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the permutations must be stored in an array, and the indices are 0-based.\n\nOnce we have the indices (index1 and index2), compute sum = index1 - index2, then take absolute value.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the sum is computed as:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor j from 0 to 1 (two lines):\n\n   for each i in 0 to listA.size-1:\n\n      if listA.get(i) equals line[j][0], then:\n\n          if sum is 0 (first occurrence, j=0), add i to sum.\n\n          else (j=1), subtract i from sum.\n\nSo sum = index1 - index2.\n\nThen the absolute value is printed.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is abs(index1 - index2).\n\nThen, the second program takes that number as input, converts it to a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing the difference (let's call it 'diff'), we need to convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, and output that.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead two lines, process to get s1 and s2 (each is a string of length n, concatenated from the input tokens).\n\nGenerate all permutations of \"123...n\" in lex order, store in an array.\n\nFind index1 = position of s1 in the permutation list.\n\nFind index2 = position of s2 in the permutation list.\n\nCompute diff = abs(index1 - index2).\n\nConvert diff to a string (as a character string).\n\nTake the first character of that string (the first digit), add 1 to its ASCII value (in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions).\n\nOutput that character.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n1. Generating all permutations in lex order.\n\n2. Efficiently finding the indices of s1 and s2 in the permutation list.\n\nGenerating permutations in lex order can be done with a recursive function or an iterative approach. Since Fortran is not as flexible as Java for recursion, perhaps an iterative approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, use a recursive subroutine. Let's think of a recursive approach.\n\nFirst, the base case: when the remaining characters are one character, add the current string plus that character.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling strings and building a list of permutations can be done with an array of strings.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be stored in an array. Let's see:\n\nWe can have a character array, say, perms, with size n! (but n can be up to 10, so 3.6 million elements for n=10, which is manageable in memory? Well, each string is length n, so for n=10, each string is 10 characters, so 3.6e6 * 10 bytes is ~36MB, which is okay).\n\nAlternatively, for n up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nSo steps for permutation generation:\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold all permutations.\n\nStart with an empty string and the initial string \"123...n\".\n\nRecursively build permutations by choosing each character in turn and appending to the current string, then permuting the remaining characters.\n\nAlternatively, here's an outline of the recursive approach in Fortran:\n\nWe can have a subroutine that builds the permutations:\n\nsubroutine generate_perms(current, remaining, perms, count)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: current, remaining\n\n   character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(inout) :: perms\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: count\n\n   ! base case: if remaining is length 1\n\n   if (len_trim(remaining) == 1) then\n\n      perms(count) = current // remaining\n\n      count = count + 1\n\n   else\n\n      do i = 1, len_trim(remaining)\n\n         call generate_perms(current // remaining(i:i), remaining(1:i-1) // remaining(i+1:), perms, count)\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays have fixed size, so we need to preallocate the perms array with the correct size (n! elements). So first, compute n! to know the size.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we can use a dynamic array, but perhaps it's easier to precompute the factorial.\n\nAlternatively, use a list approach with a dynamic array, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the factorial and allocate the array.\n\nSo first, compute the factorial of n to get the number of permutations.\n\nThen allocate the perms array with that size.\n\nInitialize count to 1 (or 0?), then call the recursive function.\n\nWait, let's think of code steps:\n\ninteger :: n, fact, count = 1\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: initial = \"123456789\"  ! but need to build the initial string properly.\n\nWait, first, build the initial string as \"123...n\".\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: initial_str\n\ninitial_str = ''\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   write(initial_str, '(i0)') i\n\n   ! but need to append each digit.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: temp\n\ninitial_str = ''\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   write(temp, '(i0)') i\n\n   initial_str = trim(initial_str) // trim(temp)\n\nend do\n\nSo initial_str is \"123...n\".\n\nThen, allocate the perms array as a character array of size fact, each element length n.\n\nfact = factorial(n)\n\nallocate(perms(fact))\n\nThen call the generate_perms subroutine with current = '', remaining = initial_str, perms, count=1.\n\nWait, but the count needs to be passed by reference. So in the subroutine, count is an intent(inout) variable.\n\nWait, the initial call would be:\n\ncall generate_perms('', initial_str, perms, count)\n\nBut the initial count is 1, but after the first call, it will be incremented.\n\nWait, perhaps the count starts at 1, and each time a permutation is added, perms(count) is set, then count is incremented.\n\nWait, the base case:\n\nif remaining length is 1:\n\n   perms(count) = current // remaining\n\n   count = count + 1\n\nElse:\n\n   loop over each character in remaining:\n\n      call generate_perms with new current and remaining.\n\nSo the initial count is 1, and after all permutations are added, count will be fact +1.\n\nBut the perms array is size fact, so the indices go from 1 to fact.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the list is 0-based. So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so when finding the indices of s1 and s2, we need to subtract 1 to match the Java's 0-based indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, if the permutation is stored in perms(1) to perms(fact), then the index in Java would be (fortran index -1).\n\nTherefore, when finding the indices in Fortran, the Java's index1 is (fortran index -1).\n\nTherefore, when calculating the difference, it's (fortran_index1 -1) - (fortran_index2 -1) = fortran_index1 - fortran_index2.\n\nWait, no, the difference would be (Java index1 - Java index2) = (fortran index1 -1) - (fortran index2 -1) = fortran_index1 - fortran_index2.\n\nSo the difference is the same as fortran indices.\n\nWait, because (i-1) - (j-1) = i-j.\n\nSo the difference between the Java indices is the same as the difference between the Fortran indices.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is the same.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the difference is abs(fortran_index1 - fortran_index2).\n\nSo the steps are okay.\n\nNow, the problem is implementing the permutation generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps an iterative approach is better for Fortran.\n\nAnother approach to generate permutations in lex order is to use the next permutation algorithm.\n\nStart with the initial string, then generate each next permutation in order until all are generated.\n\nThe next permutation algorithm can be implemented in Fortran.\n\nThe steps for generating permutations in lex order using next permutation:\n\n1. Start with the initial string (sorted in ascending order).\n\n2. Generate the next permutation in lex order until no more permutations can be generated.\n\nThis approach is iterative and might be easier to implement in Fortran.\n\nThe algorithm for next permutation is as follows (from Wikipedia):\n\nTo find the next permutation in lex order:\n\n1. Find the largest index k such that a[k] < a[k+1]. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n\n2. Find the largest index l greater than k such that a[k] < a[l].\n\n3. Swap a[k] and a[l].\n\n4. Reverse the sequence from a[k+1] up to and including the final element.\n\nSo, implementing this in Fortran:\n\nWe can start with the initial string, then generate each permutation step by step, storing them in an array.\n\nThis might be more straightforward.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize the initial permutation as \"123...n\".\n\nStore this in the first position of the perms array.\n\nThen, loop to generate each next permutation until all are generated.\n\nThe code would look something like this:\n\ninteger :: n, fact, i, k, l\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: current\n\ncharacter(len=n), dimension(:), allocatable :: perms\n\n! Initialize current as \"123...n\"\n\ncurrent = ''\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   write(current(i:i), '(i1)') i\n\nend do\n\nperms(1) = current\n\ncount = 1\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   ! Generate next permutation\n\n   ! Step 1: find largest k where current(k) < current(k+1)\n\n   k = -1\n\n   do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (current(i:i) < current(i+1:i+1)) then\n\n         k = i\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (k == -1) exit  ! no more permutations\n\n   ! Step 2: find largest l >k with current(k) < current(l)\n\n   l = n\n\n   do while (current(l:l) <= current(k:k))\n\n      l = l -1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Step 3: swap k and l\n\n   temp = current(k:k)\n\n   current(k:k) = current(l:l)\n\n   current(l:l) = temp\n\n   ! Step 4: reverse from k+1 to end\n\n   current(k+1:) = reverse(current(k+1:))\n\n   ! Store the new permutation\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   perms(count) = current\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string slicing and reversing may need careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, implement the reverse step manually.\n\nThis approach requires writing a function to reverse a substring.\n\nAlternatively, for the reverse step:\n\ndo i = k+1, (k + (n -k)/2 )\n\n   swap current(i) and current(n - (i - (k+1)) + k +1 )\n\nWait, perhaps better to loop from start and end towards the center.\n\nAlternatively, for the substring from position m to n:\n\nstart = m\n\nend = n\n\ndo while (start < end)\n\n   swap current(start) and current(end)\n\n   start = start +1\n\n   end = end -1\n\nend do\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger :: start, end\n\nstart = k+1\n\nend = n\n\ndo while (start < end)\n\n   temp = current(start:start)\n\n   current(start:start) = current(end:end)\n\n   current(end:end) = temp\n\n   start = start +1\n\n   end = end -1\n\nend do\n\nThis would reverse the substring from k+1 to n.\n\nPutting this all together, the code for generating permutations would be manageable.\n\nThis iterative approach might be better in Fortran since it avoids recursion and stack issues.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, read the two input strings s1 and s2.\n\n2. Generate all permutations of \"123...n\" in lex order using the next permutation algorithm, storing them in an array perms.\n\n3. Find the indices of s1 and s2 in perms.\n\n4. Compute the difference between the indices (since they are 1-based, the difference is the same as in Java's 0-based indices).\n\n5. Convert the difference to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output.\n\nNow, implementing each part step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the input:\n\nRead n, then read two lines, process each to remove spaces and concatenate into s1 and s2.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: line1, line2, s1, s2\n\ninteger :: n\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*, '(a)') line1\n\nread(*, '(a)') line2\n\n! Process line1 to s1:\n\ns1 = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(line1)\n\n   if (line1(i:i) /= ' ') then\n\n      s1 = trim(s1) // line1(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for s2.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can have trailing spaces, so using trim is important.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to build s1:\n\ninteger :: len1, len2, i, pos\n\nlen1 = len_trim(line1)\n\ns1 = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len1\n\n   if (line1(i:i) /= ' ') then\n\n      s1 = s1 // line1(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSame for s2.\n\nNow, generating permutations:\n\nWe need to precompute the factorial to know the size of the perms array.\n\nBut using the next permutation approach, we can dynamically build the array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays must be allocated with a fixed size. So we need to know the number of permutations in advance, which is n!.\n\nSo first compute n!.\n\ninteger function factorial(n)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   integer :: i, res = 1\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      res = res * i\n\n   end do\n\n   factorial = res\n\nend function\n\nThen, allocate perms as:\n\nfact = factorial(n)\n\nallocate(perms(fact))\n\nThen proceed to generate permutations.\n\nNow, the next permutation code.\n\nInitialize current as the initial string \"123...n\".\n\ncurrent is a character(len=n) variable.\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   write(current(i:i), '(i1)') i\n\nend do\n\nperms(1) = current\n\ncount = 1\n\nthen loop:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   ! find k\n\n   k = -1\n\n   do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (current(i:i) < current(i+1:i+1)) then\n\n         k = i\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (k == -1) exit\n\n   ! find l\n\n   l = n\n\n   do while (current(l:l) <= current(k:k))\n\n      l = l -1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! swap k and l\n\n   temp = current(k:k)\n\n   current(k:k) = current(l:l)\n\n   current(l:l) = temp\n\n   ! reverse from k+1 to end\n\n   start = k+1\n\n   end_pos = n\n\n   do while (start < end_pos)\n\n      temp = current(start:start)\n\n      current(start:start) = current(end_pos:end_pos)\n\n      current(end_pos:end_pos) = temp\n\n      start = start +1\n\n      end_pos = end_pos -1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! store current\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   perms(count) = current\n\n   if (count > fact) exit  ! safety check\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop should terminate naturally when k is -1, so the safety check may not be needed.\n\nOnce the permutations are generated, we need to find the indices of s1 and s2 in the perms array.\n\ninteger :: index1 = 0, index2 = 0\n\ndo i = 1, fact\n\n   if (perms(i) == s1) then\n\n      index1 = i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (perms(i) == s2) then\n\n      index2 = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but we need to ensure that both s1 and s2 are present in perms. Since they are permutations of 1..n, they should be there.\n\nThen compute diff = abs(index1 - index2).\n\nNow, convert diff to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: diff_str\n\nwrite(diff_str, '(i0)') diff\n\nThen, take the first character of diff_str (since it's a number, the first character is the first digit).\n\ncharacter :: c = diff_str(1:1)\n\ninteger :: ascii = ichar(c)\n\nascii = ascii +1\n\ncharacter :: result_char = char(ascii)\n\nprint *, result_char\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling the case where the diff is zero? Well, the problem says to output the absolute value, so diff is non-negative. So the first character is always present.\n\nNow, putting all the code together in Fortran.\n\nBut need to make sure that all variables are declared properly.\n\nNow, the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, fact, count, i, k, l, start, end_pos, index1, index2, diff\n\n   character(len=100) :: line1, line2, s1, s2\n\n   character(len=10) :: current\n\n   character(len=10), dimension(:), allocatable :: perms\n\n   character(len=1) :: temp\n\n   !

The permutation generation loop may not generate all permutations. The loop condition is 'do while (count < fact)', but the count starts at 1, and increments each time. So for n=3, fact is 6, so the loop runs while count <6, so when count reaches 5, it will loop again, but after the first iteration, count becomes 2, etc. Wait, no, the loop is 'do while (count < fact)', so for fact=6, the loop runs until count reaches 6.\n\nWait, the initial count is 1 (after first assignment). The loop condition is 'do while (count < fact)'.\n\nInside the loop, after generating the next permutation, count is incremented. So for example, when count is 1, the loop runs, and after processing, count becomes 2, etc. So the loop will run until count reaches fact.\n\nWait, but the loop is 'do while (count < fact)', so when count reaches fact, the loop stops.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAnother thing: the current variable is declared as len=10, but n can be up to 10, so that's okay.\n\nAlso, in the permutation generation, the current is stored in perms(count), which is allocated to size fact. Since the loop runs until count reaches fact, that's okay.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 s1 is \"123\"\n\n3 2 1 \u2192 s2 is \"321\"\n\nThe permutations in order are:\n\n123 (index1=1)\n\n132 (2)\n\n213 (3)\n\n231 (4)\n\n312 (5)\n\n321 (6)\n\nSo index1 is 1, index2 is 6 \u2192 difference is 5 \u2192 output is '5' +1 \u2192 '6'.\n\nWait, the first character of \"5\" is '5', adding 1 gives '6', so output is 6.\n\nSo the code should output '6'.\n\nAnother test case: n=1.\n\nInput lines: 1 and 1 \u2192 s1 and s2 are both \"1\".\n\nIndices are 1 and 1 \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 output is '0' +1 \u2192 '1'.\n\nAnother test case: n=2.\n\nInput lines: 1 2 \u2192 s1 is \"12\", and 2 1 \u2192 s2 is \"21\".\n\nPermutations are \"12\" (1), \"21\" (2). So difference is 1 \u2192 output '1' +1 \u2192 '2'.\n\nThe code should output '2'.\n\nNow, in the code, when converting diff to a string, the write statement uses '(i0)', which should format as an integer without leading spaces. So for diff=5, the string is \"5\", first character is '5'.\n\nYes.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The permutation generation may not be in lex order. Need to ensure that the next permutation algorithm is correctly implemented.\n\n- The indices are found correctly.\n\n- The string processing for s1 and s2 correctly removes spaces.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the permutation generation, the current is a character(len=10) variable, but for n up to 10, that's okay. For n=10, it's exactly 10 characters.\n\nAlso, in the code, the perms array is allocated as len=10 for each element, which matches the current's length.\n\nAnother thing: in the permutation loop, after swapping and reversing, the current is stored in perms(count). The loop continues until count reaches fact.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as written above."
