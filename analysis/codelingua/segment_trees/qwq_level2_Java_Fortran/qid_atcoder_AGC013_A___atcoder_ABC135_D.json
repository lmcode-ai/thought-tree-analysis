    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_AGC013_A) reads an integer N and an array A of N integers. It then counts something based on consecutive elements. The count is printed at the end. The second program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string, processes it with some dynamic programming, and outputs a number modulo 1e9+7. The output of the first program is the input to the second. So in the original setup, the first program's output is the input for the second. But in the Fortran program, I have to combine them so that the first's processing feeds into the second's without any I/O in between.\n\nHmm, so the first step is to read the input for the first program, process it, get the count, then use that count as the input for the second program. But in Fortran, I can't have intermediate I/O steps. So the first part must process the input, compute the count, then pass that count directly into the second part's processing. The second part's input is a string, but in the original setup, the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second. Wait, but the second Java program expects a string input. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string (since it reads a string with sc.next().toCharArray()). So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then converted into a string and passed as input to the second program. But in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read that as the string \"5\".\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (count), which is then the input to the second program. But the second program reads a string (the next() method reads the entire next token, which would be the number as a string). So the second program's input is the string representation of the first program's output. Therefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first part must compute the count, then pass that count as a string to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and array A).\n2. Compute the count as per the first Java program.\n3. Use that count as the input to the second program's processing (i.e., the second program's input is the string representation of the count).\n4. The second part processes this string and outputs the result.\n\nSo the key is to compute the count from the first part, then pass it as a string to the second part's processing.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's logic is a bit tricky. Let me re-express it in pseudocode:\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nLoop over each element from 0 to N-1:\n\n- If it's the last element, increment count by 1.\n- Else if current element equals next, do nothing (so just move to next element).\n- Else if current < next:\n   - While the next element is >= current (since current is less than next, but the loop continues as long as A[i] <= A[i+1], so we move i forward until it's not.\n   - Then increment count by 1.\n- Else (current > next):\n   - While the next element is <= current (since current is greater than next, but the loop continues as long as A[i] >= A[i+1], so move i forward until it's not.\n   - Then increment count by 1.\n\nWait, the loop in the Java code for the first case (current < next) is:\n\nwhile (A[i] <= A[i+1]) { i++; if (i == N-1) break; }\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while A[i] <= A[i+1], so as long as the current element is less than or equal to the next, we increment i. But since we started at i, and the next element is greater, so the loop continues until the next element is smaller than current. Wait, perhaps the logic is to count the number of \"runs\" where the direction changes. Hmm, perhaps the count is the number of \"segments\" where the direction is non-decreasing or non-increasing. The code seems to be counting the number of such segments.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of \"runs\" where each run is a maximal increasing or decreasing sequence. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts at i, and if the next element is equal, it just moves to next (since the condition is A[i] == A[i+1], so it skips to next i). But if the next is higher, then it moves forward as long as the next is higher or equal, so the run continues. Each time a new direction starts, it increments the count. Hmm, perhaps the count is the number of times the direction changes, but I need to see the code again.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nIf it's the last element, count +=1.\n\nElse if A[i] == A[i+1], do nothing (so the loop continues to next i).\n\nElse if A[i] < A[i+1], then enter a loop where we increment i until A[i] > A[i+1], then count +=1.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the first check (if i is last, count++), else if A[i] == A[i+1], do nothing (so the loop proceeds to next i). Else if A[i] < A[i+1], then enter the while loop, which increments i until the next element is smaller than current. Then, after breaking, count is incremented by 1. Similarly for the else case (A[i] > A[i+1]).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is counting the number of \"segments\" where each segment is a non-decreasing or non-increasing run. Each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. The count is the total number of such segments.\n\nWait, let's see an example. Suppose the array is [1,2,3,2,2,1]. Let's walk through the code.\n\nN=6.\n\nInitialize count=0.\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0]=1, A[1]=2. Since 1 < 2, enter the while loop.\n\nInside the while loop:\n\nCheck A[i] <= A[i+1]. 1 <=2 \u2192 yes. i increments to 1.\n\nNow i=1, check A[1]=2 vs A[2]=3 \u2192 2 <=3 \u2192 yes. i becomes 2.\n\nNow i=2, A[2]=3 vs A[3]=2 \u2192 3 <=2 \u2192 no. So exit loop. Then count +=1 (now count=1). Then the loop continues with i=3 (since the for loop's i is now 3? Wait, no. Wait, the for loop is for (int i=0; i<N; i++). But inside the else if (A[i] < A[i+1]) block, the code has a while loop that increments i. So after the while loop, the for loop's i will be incremented again. Wait, that's a problem. Because the for loop's i is controlled by the loop, but inside the code, we are modifying i. That might be causing an off-by-one error. Wait, let me look at the code again.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    if (i == N-1) count++;\n    else if (A[i] == A[i+1]) ;\n    else if (A[i] < A[i+1]) {\n        while (A[i] <= A[i+1]) {\n            i++;\n            if (i == N-1) break;\n        }\n        count++;\n    } else {\n        while (A[i] >= A[i+1]) {\n            i++;\n            if (i == N-1) break;\n        }\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the problem here is that the for loop's i is being modified inside the loop. For example, in the case where the while loop increments i, then the for loop's i will be incremented again, leading to skipping elements. Wait, that's a classic off-by-one error. Wait, but the code is written in Java, so perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's logic. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's take the example array [1,2,3,2,2,1].\n\nLet me walk through the code step by step.\n\nInitial i=0:\n\nCheck if i is N-1 (5)? No.\n\nCheck A[0] (1) vs A[1] (2): 1 < 2 \u2192 enter the first else if block.\n\nEnter the while loop:\n\nA[0] (1) <= A[1] (2) \u2192 yes. i becomes 1. Check if i is N-1 (5)? No.\n\nLoop again: A[1] (2) <= A[2] (3) \u2192 yes. i becomes 2. Not N-1.\n\nAgain: A[2] (3) <= A[3] (2)? 3 <=2 \u2192 no. So exit loop.\n\nThen count is incremented by 1 (count=1).\n\nNow, the for loop's i is now 2 (since the while loop ended at i=2). Then the for loop increments i to 3.\n\nNow, i=3:\n\nCheck if i is 5? No.\n\nA[3] is 2, A[4] is 2 \u2192 equal. So do nothing. So the for loop proceeds to next i (4).\n\ni=4:\n\nCheck A[4] (2) vs A[5] (1). 2 >1 \u2192 enter else block.\n\nEnter the while loop:\n\nA[4] (2) >= A[5] (1) \u2192 yes. i becomes 5. Check if i is N-1 (5) \u2192 yes, break.\n\nThen count is incremented by 1 (count=2).\n\nNow, the for loop's i is 5. The for loop checks i < N (5 <6 \u2192 yes). Then the if (i == N-1) \u2192 yes, so count +=1 (now 3). Then the for loop increments i to 6, which is beyond N-1 (5), so loop ends.\n\nWait, but in the code, when i is 5 (the last element), the first condition (i == N-1) is true, so count is increased by 1. So in this example, the total count would be 3?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe segments would be:\n\n1-2-3 (increasing), then 3-2-2 (decreasing?), then 2-1 (decreasing). Wait, but the code's count is 3. Let me see:\n\nThe first segment is from 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2). Then the next segment starts at 3. The while loop in the else block (since A[3] is 2 and A[4] is 2, so the first else if (equality) is taken. Wait, no. Wait when i=3, A[3] is 2 and A[4] is 2 \u2192 so the else if (equality) is taken, so the code does nothing. So the for loop proceeds to i=4. At i=4, A[4] is 2, A[5] is 1 \u2192 so enter the else block (A[i] > A[i+1]). The while loop runs once (i becomes 5, then breaks). Then count is incremented to 2. Then the for loop increments to i=5. The first condition (i == N-1) is true, so count becomes 3. So the total is 3. So the code counts each time a new segment starts, except the last element is counted as a segment. Hmm, perhaps the code is counting the number of \"runs\" where each run is a non-decreasing or non-increasing sequence. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts. The count is the number of runs.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. Now, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare them with a lower bound of 0. Alternatively, adjust indices. Let me think.\n\nThe first part of the Fortran program will read N and the array A. Then compute the count as per the code.\n\nNow, the second Java program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string, processes it with DP, and outputs the result modulo 1e9+7. The input to this part in the combined program will be the string representation of the count from the first part.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing the count, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string as the input for the second part.\n\nNow, let's tackle the first part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read N and the array A. Let's use integer arrays. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: N\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n\nRead N, then allocate A(N), then read the elements.\n\nThen, compute the count as per the Java code.\n\nThe loop in the Java code is a for loop over i from 0 to N-1. In Fortran, indices can be 1-based, so perhaps we need to adjust. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, if we use 1-based, then the indices would be from 1 to N. So when translating, we need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use 0-based in Fortran by declaring the array with lower bound 0. Let me see:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: A\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with explicit bounds. So perhaps:\n\nRead N first, then allocate A(0:N-1).\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based and adjust the indices.\n\nHmm, perhaps using 1-based is easier, but need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nLet me think through the code again.\n\nThe Java code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\nSo in Fortran, if we have A(1) to A(N), then the loop would be from i=1 to N.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is:\n\nif (i == N-1) \u2192 in Java, the last index is N-1 (0-based). So in Fortran with 1-based, the last index is N. So the condition would be i == N.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based in Fortran for easier translation. Let me try that.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead N.\n\nallocate(A(0:N-1))\n\nThen read the N integers into A(0), A(1), ..., A(N-1).\n\nThen, the loop over i from 0 to N-1.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to N-1:\n\nif (i == N-1) then \u2192 count = count +1\n\nelse if (A(i) == A(i+1)) \u2192 do nothing.\n\nelse if (A(i) < A(i+1)) \u2192 enter the while loop.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops are a bit different. The while loop in Java can be translated with a do loop.\n\nWait, the code inside the else if (A[i] < A[i+1]) block is:\n\nwhile (A[i] <= A[i+1]) {\n\n    i++;\n\n    if (i == N-1) break;\n\n}\n\ncount++;\n\nSimilarly for the else case.\n\nBut in Fortran, modifying the loop variable inside the loop can be tricky. Since the outer loop is a for loop, but in Fortran, the loop variable is controlled by the loop. So this approach may not work directly.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in the Java code, the for loop's i is being modified inside the loop body, which can lead to skipping elements. So in Fortran, we can't do that in a straightforward for loop. So perhaps we need to restructure the code to avoid modifying the loop variable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a while loop for the outer loop, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can restructure the code to track the current position and not use the for loop's i as the index.\n\nLet me think of the algorithm again. The code is trying to count the number of runs. Each run is a maximal sequence where the direction is non-decreasing or non-increasing. So the code is moving through the array, and whenever the direction changes, it starts a new run.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be rephrased as:\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nSet current index to 0.\n\nWhile current index < N:\n\n    count +=1\n\n    if current index is the last element, break.\n\n    compare A(current) and A(current+1):\n\n    if equal \u2192 move to next index.\n\n    else if A(current) < A(current+1):\n\n        move forward until A[i] > A[i+1]\n\n    else:\n\n        move forward until A[i] < A[i+1]\n\n    set current to the new position.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach would be better. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to restructure the code logic:\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\ncurrent =0\n\nwhile current < N:\n\n    count +=1\n\n    if current == N-1:\n\n        exit loop\n\n    next_val = A(current+1)\n\n    if A(current) == next_val:\n\n        current +=1\n\n    else if A(current) < next_val:\n\n        while current < N-1 and A(current) <= A(current+1):\n\n            current +=1\n\n    else:  # A(current) > next_val\n\n        while current < N-1 and A(current) >= A(current+1):\n\n            current +=1\n\n    # after the while, current is at the end of the run.\n\n    # so the next iteration starts at current+1?\n\nWait, no. Because after the while loop, current is at the end of the run. So the next run starts at current+1. So the next iteration of the outer loop will start at current+1.\n\nWait, let me see with the example:\n\nTake the array [1,2,3,2,2,1].\n\ncurrent starts at 0.\n\ncount becomes 1.\n\nCompare A(0)=1 and A(1)=2 \u2192 less than. So enter the while loop.\n\ncurrent increments until A(current) > A(current+1.\n\nAt current=0: 1 <=2 \u2192 yes, current becomes 1.\n\ncurrent=1: 2 <=3 \u2192 yes, current becomes 2.\n\ncurrent=2: 3 vs 2 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 no. So exit loop.\n\ncurrent is now 2. So the next run starts at current+1 =3?\n\nWait, no. The next run starts at current+1? Or current is now at the end of the first run, so the next run starts at current+1.\n\nWait, the code above would set current to 2, then the next iteration of the outer loop starts at current=2.\n\nWait, in the outer loop:\n\ncurrent starts at 0.\n\nAfter processing, current is 2. So the next iteration of the outer loop (current=2):\n\ncount +=1 (now 2).\n\nCheck if current is N-1 (5)? No.\n\nCompare A(2)=3 and A(3)=2 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 enter the else block.\n\nThe while loop checks while current <5 and A(current)>=A(current+1).\n\nAt current=2: 3 >=2 \u2192 yes. current becomes 3.\n\ncurrent=3: A(3)=2 vs A(4)=2 \u2192 2 >=2 \u2192 yes. current becomes4.\n\ncurrent=4: A(4)=2 vs A(5)=1 \u2192 2 >=1 \u2192 yes. current becomes5.\n\nNow, current is 5, which is N-1 (since N=6, 5 is N-1). So the while loop stops.\n\nNow, the next iteration of the outer loop starts at current=5.\n\ncount +=1 (now 3).\n\nCheck if current is N-1 \u2192 yes, so exit loop.\n\nTotal count is 3, which matches the previous example.\n\nThis approach avoids modifying the loop variable in a way that would conflict with the loop control. So this is better for Fortran.\n\nTherefore, the code can be restructured as:\n\nInitialize current =0, count=0.\n\nloop:\n\nwhile current < N:\n\n    count +=1\n\n    if current == N-1:\n\n        exit loop\n\n    next_val = A(current+1)\n\n    if A(current) == next_val:\n\n        current +=1\n\n    else if A(current) < next_val:\n\n        do while (current < N-1 .and. A(current) <= A(current+1))\n\n            current +=1\n\n        end do\n\n    else:\n\n        do while (current < N-1 .and. A(current) >= A(current+1))\n\n            current +=1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop structure would be:\n\ncurrent =0\n\ncount =0\n\ndo while (current < N)\n\n    count = count +1\n\n    if (current == N-1) then\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\n    next_val = A(current+1)\n\n    if (A(current) == next_val) then\n\n        current = current +1\n\n    else if (A(current) < next_val) then\n\n        do while (current < N-1 .and. A(current) <= A(current+1))\n\n            current = current +1\n\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        do while (current < N-1 .and. A(current) >= A(current+1))\n\n            current = current +1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but after the inner loops, the current is already at the end of the run. So the next iteration of the outer loop will start at current+1? No, because the outer loop is a do-while loop. Wait, the outer loop is a do-while, so after the inner loops, the current is updated, and the loop continues.\n\nWait, let me see with the example again:\n\ncurrent starts at 0.\n\ncount becomes 1.\n\ncurrent is not N-1 (5). next_val is 2.\n\nA(0) < next_val \u2192 enter the inner do-while.\n\ncurrent increments until A(current) > next_val.\n\nAfter the inner loop, current is 2.\n\nThen, the outer loop continues (current is now 2 <6 \u2192 yes).\n\ncount becomes 2.\n\ncurrent is 2, not N-1.\n\nnext_val is A(3)=2.\n\nA(2)=3 > next_val (2). So enter else block.\n\nThe inner do-while checks while current <5 and A(current)>=A(current+1).\n\ncurrent=2: 3 >=2 \u2192 yes. current becomes 3.\n\ncurrent=3: A(3)=2 vs A(4)=2 \u2192 yes. current becomes4.\n\ncurrent=4: A(4)=2 vs A(5)=1 \u2192 yes. current becomes5.\n\nNow, current is 5. The inner loop exits.\n\nThen, the outer loop continues (current is 5 <6 \u2192 yes).\n\ncount becomes 3.\n\ncurrent is now 5, which is N-1 (5). So the if (current == N-1) is true \u2192 exit loop.\n\nThus, the total count is 3, which is correct.\n\nThis structure works. So in Fortran, this can be implemented with a do-while loop.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran code.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: the second Java program.\n\nThe second program reads a string (char array), and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5. The result is printed modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe input to this part in the combined program is the string representation of the count from the first part. So in Fortran, after computing the count, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string as the input for the second part.\n\nFirst, let's see the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe DP array is dp[i][pre], where i is the number of digits processed (from the end?), and pre is the current mod 13 value. The base is multiplied by 10 each step, mod 13.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe loop is over i from 0 to cs.length-1. But the characters are processed in reverse order (cs.length-1 -i). So the first character processed is the last character of the string, then the second to last, etc. So the processing is from the end towards the start.\n\nThe DP is built as follows:\n\nInitially, dp[0][0] =1 (since for the first character (the last of the string), if it's a digit, then the contribution is 1 if the mod is correct).\n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nThe dp array is of size [cs.length][13], and for each step i (from 0 to length-1), it processes the (length-1 -i)th character (so starting from the end).\n\nThe base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod 13.\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each position i (processing the (length-1 -i)th character):\n\nIf the current character is '?', then for each previous mod value (pre), and for each possible digit (0-9), compute the new mod value ( (base * digit + pre) mod 13 ), and add the previous count to the new dp[i][new_mod].\n\nElse, the digit is fixed, so only that digit is considered.\n\nThe DP transitions are:\n\nFor each pre in 0..12:\n\n   for next in 0..9 (if '?') or next = digit (if not):\n\n       new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod 13\n\n       dp[i][new_mod] += dp[i-1][pre] (if i>0) or 1 if pre is 0 and i=0.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n    if (cs[cs.length - 1 - i] == '?') {\n\n        for (pre in 0..12) {\n\n            for (next in 0..9) {\n\n                dp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n                mod by MOD.\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        next = digit.\n\n        for (pre in 0..12) {\n\n            new_mod = (base * next + pre) mod13\n\n            dp[i][new_mod] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n            mod MOD.\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    base = base *10 mod13.\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are structured as:\n\nfor each i from 0 to length-1:\n\n    process the (length-1 -i)th character.\n\n    for each pre in 0..12:\n\n        if the character is '?', loop over next 0-9:\n\n            compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod]\n\n        else, next is fixed, compute new_mod and add.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (next in 0..9 (if ?) or next is fixed):\n\n        compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod]\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are:\n\nIn the case of '?', for each pre, loop over next 0-9:\n\n    dp[i][new_mod] += ... \n\nBut in Fortran, we need to implement this.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran can be a 2D array of size (length, 13), with modulo operations.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and each step multiplies by 10 mod13.\n\nThe initial condition is that for i=0 (the first step, processing the last character of the original string), when i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0).\n\nWait, in the code, for i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0).\n\nThus, the DP transitions are:\n\nFor each i from 0 to length-1:\n\n    current_char = the (length-1 -i)th character.\n\n    if current_char is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9):\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_mod = (base * digit + pre) mod13\n\n            dp[i][new_mod] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre ==0 ?1 :0))\n\n    else:\n\n        digit = current_char - '0'\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_mod = (base * digit + pre) mod13\n\n            dp[i][new_mod] += (if i>0 then dp[i-1][pre] else (pre ==0 ?1 :0))\n\n    then mod by MOD.\n\n    base = (base *10) mod13.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are structured as:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n    for next in 0..9 (if ?):\n\n        compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod]\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, no, in the code for the '?' case:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n\n        new_mod = (base * next + pre) %13\n\n        dp[i][new_mod] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but this would loop over all pre and next, but the order may not matter as long as all combinations are considered.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n    for each next in 0..9:\n\n        compute new_mod and add to dp[i][new_mod] the value from dp[i-1][pre] (or 1 if i=0 and pre=0).\n\nWait, but this is not correct, because for each pre, the contribution from dp[i-1][pre] is added to multiple new_mods (for each next). So the code is accumulating all possible transitions from pre to new_mod via next.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but in Fortran, we need to implement this.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the DP array can be a 2D array of integers (or integers with modulo operations). Since the numbers can be up to 1e9+7, we need to use 64-bit integers. In Fortran, integers can be declared as integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18).\n\nThe steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing the count from the first part, we need to convert it to a string. Let's say the count is stored in a variable called count_val. Then, we can write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\n\nwrite(input_str, '(I0)') count_val\n\nThen, the input_str is the string representation of count_val. We can then process this string as the input for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe length of the string is len_trim(input_str).\n\nWe need to process each character in reverse order (from the end to the start).\n\nInitialize the DP array. Let's say:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:len-1, 0:12) :: dp\n\nwhere len is the length of the string.\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char is the (len-1 -i)th character of the string.\n\n    if current_char is '?', then process all digits 0-9.\n\n    else, process the digit.\n\n    compute the transitions.\n\nWait, let's structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, read the string (input_str) and get its length.\n\nlen = len_trim(input_str)\n\nallocate the DP array as (0:len-1, 0:12)\n\nInitialize dp to 0.\n\nbase =1\n\nThen, loop over i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = input_str(len - i) \u2192 because for i=0, it's the last character (index len-1 -0 = len-1 \u2192 but in Fortran, strings are 1-based? Wait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So input_str(1) is first character, input_str(len) is last.\n\nWait, the original Java code processes the characters in reverse order. The first character processed is the last character of the string (index length-1 in Java, which is 0-based). In Fortran, the string is 1-based, so the last character is input_str(len).\n\nSo for i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    the current character is input_str(len - i) \u2192 because when i=0, it's the last character (len), when i=1, it's len-1, etc.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"abcd\", length 4. The characters are 1:a, 2:b, 3:c,4:d.\n\nProcessing in reverse order (d, c, b, a).\n\nFor i from 0 to 3 (since len-1 is 3):\n\ni=0 \u2192 character at position 4 (len -0 =4)\n\ni=1 \u2192 position 3 (4-1=3)\n\ni=2 \u2192 position 2 (4-2=2)\n\ni=3 \u2192 position 1 (4-3=1)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo current_char = input_str(len -i)\n\nNow, for each i:\n\n    if current_char == '?' then:\n\n        loop over next_digit from 0 to9:\n\n            for each pre in 0..12:\n\n                new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                if i ==0:\n\n                    contribution = 1 if pre ==0 else 0\n\n                else:\n\n                    contribution = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n    else:\n\n        digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_mod = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            contribution = if i==0 then (pre ==0 ?1 :0) else dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + contribution\n\n            mod by MOD.\n\n    after processing all, update base:\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops are a bit different. Also, the DP array needs to be handled carefully.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the DP array for each i depends on the previous i-1. So for each i, we can compute the current dp based on the previous.\n\nBut in the code, for each i, the current dp is built from the previous dp (i-1). So we can process each i step by step.\n\nNow, the initial step (i=0):\n\nFor i=0, the previous is i-1 = -1, so the contribution is 1 if pre ==0 else 0.\n\nThus, for i=0:\n\n    if current_char is '?', then for each next_digit (0-9):\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_mod = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n\n            contribution = 1 if (pre ==0) else 0\n\n            dp(0, new_mod) += contribution\n\n    else:\n\n        digit = ... \n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_mod = mod(base * digit + pre, 13)\n\n            contribution = 1 if pre ==0 else 0\n\n            dp(0, new_mod) += contribution\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are over all pre and next, so for each pre and next, the contribution is added to the new_mod.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be structured as:\n\nfor each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    initialize a temporary array (or overwrite the current dp[i] based on previous dp[i-1])\n\n    but in Fortran, since arrays are static, perhaps we can use a temporary array or overwrite in place.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can compute the current dp based on the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (len, 13). Initially, all elements are 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n    current_char = input_str(len -i)\n\n    if i ==0:\n\n        previous_dp is the initial condition (pre=0 \u2192 1, else 0)\n\n    else:\n\n        previous_dp is dp(i-1, : )\n\n    then, for the current character, compute the new_dp (current dp[i]) based on previous_dp.\n\n    then, set dp(i, :) = new_dp.\n\nBut in Fortran, this can be done with loops.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can loop over all possible pre and next, and accumulate into the current dp.\n\nLet me try to write this in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\n\ninteger :: len, i, current_char_code, digit, next_digit, pre, new_mod, base\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\nFirst, after computing count_val, we have:\n\nwrite(input_str, '(I0)') count_val\n\nlen = len_trim(input_str)\n\nallocate(dp(0:len-1, 0:12))\n\ndp = 0\n\nbase =1\n\ndo i =0, len-1\n\n    current_char = input_str(len -i)\n\n    if (i ==0) then\n\n        ! previous is initial condition (pre=0 \u2192 1, else 0)\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            if (pre ==0) then\n\n                prev_val =1\n\n            else\n\n                prev_val =0\n\n            end if\n\n            ! process current character\n\n            if (current_char == '?') then\n\n                do next_digit =0,9\n\n                    new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                    dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_val\n\n                    dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n                end do\n\n            else\n\n                digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n                new_mod = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_val\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        ! previous is dp(i-1, pre)\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            prev_val = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            if (prev_val ==0) cycle\n\n            if (current_char == '?') then\n\n                do next_digit =0,9\n\n                    new_mod = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                    dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_val\n\n                    dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n                end do\n\n            else\n\n                digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n                new_mod = mod( base * digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_val\n\n                dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    ! update base\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this may not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code above for the case when current_char is '?', for each pre, and each next_digit, the contribution is prev_val (from previous step) added to new_mod.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each pre and next_digit, the new_mod is computed, and the contribution is added to dp(i, new_mod).\n\nBut in the loops above, for each pre, and for each next_digit (if '?'), we loop over all next_digits and add to new_mod.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each pre, the contribution is prev_val (from previous step's pre), and for each next_digit, the new_mod is computed and the contribution is added to that new_mod.\n\nThus, the code above for the '?' case would accumulate all next_digits for each pre.\n\nBut in the code above, for each pre, and next_digit, the new_mod is computed and the contribution is added to dp(i, new_mod).\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops are:\n\nfor each pre in 0..12:\n\n    if current_char is '?', then for each next_digit in 0..9:\n\n        new_mod = ... \n\n        dp[i][new_mod] += prev_val\n\n    else:\n\n        new_mod = ... \n\n        dp[i][new_mod] += prev_val\n\nThus, the code above should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for the case of '?', the loop over next_digit is inside the pre loop. So for each pre, and each next_digit, the contribution is added to the new_mod.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, after processing all i, the result is dp(len-1,5).\n\nThus, the final answer is dp(len-1,5).\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N and array A.\n\n2. Compute the count using the first part's logic.\n\n3. Convert count to a string.\n\n4. Process the string using the second part's DP.\n\n5. Output the result.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, i, current, count_val\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A\n\n    !

Output the result\n\n    write(*,*) dp(len-1,5)\n\n    deallocate(A, dp)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are a few things to check:\n\n- The current_char is read as a substring of length 1. In Fortran, input_str(len -i : len -i) should give the correct character.\n\n- The loops for the DP are correctly structured.\n\n- The base is initialized to 1 and updated correctly.\n\n- The final output is dp(len-1,5).\n\nTesting this code with the example where the first program's output is 3 (count_val=3), the input_str is \"3\".\n\nThe second part processes \"3\".\n\nThe length is 1.\n\nProcessing i=0 (the first and only character):\n\ncurrent_char is '3'.\n\nbase is 1.\n\nFor i=0:\n\npre loops from 0 to 12.\n\nFor each pre:\n\nprev_val is 1 if pre==0 else 0.\n\ncurrent_char is '3', so digit=3.\n\nnew_mod = mod(1 *3 + pre,13).\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nprev_val=1 \u2192 new_mod = 3 mod13 \u21923. So dp(0,3) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0 except when pre=0.\n\nThus, after processing, dp(0,3) is 1.\n\nThen, base becomes mod(1*10,13)=10.\n\nBut since len is 1, the loop ends.\n\nThe final result is dp(0,5) \u2192 which is 0. But wait, the input is \"3\", so the number mod13 is 3 mod13 =3. The required mod is 5, so the answer should be 0.\n\nBut perhaps the example is not correct. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the first program outputs 5. Then the input_str is \"5\".\n\nThe second program's input is \"5\".\n\nThe length is 1.\n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ncurrent_char is '5'.\n\ndigit=5.\n\nbase is 1.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nprev_val=1 \u2192 new_mod = 1*5 +0 mod13 \u21925 mod13 is5 \u2192 so dp(0,5) +=1.\n\nThus, the result is 1, which is correct because the number 5 mod13 is5, so the count is1.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 5, so the second program's input is \"5\", the output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 13 \u2192 input_str is \"13\".\n\nThe second program's input is \"13\".\n\nThe length is 2.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (processing the second character '3'):\n\nbase=1.\n\ncurrent_char is '3'.\n\nFor pre=0:\n\nprev_val=1.\n\ndigit=3 \u2192 new_mod =1*3 +0 mod13 \u21923 \u2192 dp(0,3) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute nothing.\n\nThus, after i=0, dp(0,3)=1.\n\nbase becomes 10 mod13 \u219210.\n\ni=1 (processing first character '1'):\n\ncurrent_char is '1'.\n\nbase is 10.\n\nFor each pre in 0..12:\n\nprev_val is dp(0, pre).\n\nOnly pre=3 has prev_val=1.\n\nSo for pre=3:\n\nprev_val=1.\n\ndigit=1 \u2192 new_mod =10*1 +3 mod13 \u219213 mod13=0 \u2192 new_mod=0.\n\nThus, dp(1,0) +=1.\n\nOther pre's have prev_val=0.\n\nThus, after i=1, dp(1,0)=1.\n\nThe final result is dp(1,5) \u21920.\n\nThe number 13 mod13 is0, so the correct answer is0.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and that the loops are correctly structured.\n\nAlso, in the first part, the array A is 0-based, which is handled correctly.\n\nIn the second part, the DP array is allocated as (0:len-1, 0:12), which is correct.\n\nThe final output is dp(len-1,5).\n\nThus, the code should work."
