    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC139_B) reads two integers A and B from input. Then it calculates some result. Let me see the formula here. The result is (B-1)/(A-1) using integer division, then if there's a remainder (amari), it adds 1. So essentially, it's the ceiling of (B-1)/(A-1). Because when you divide (B-1) by (A-1), if there's a remainder, you need an extra step. So the formula can be written as ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)). \n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_669_A) takes an integer n, and computes (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2, plus 1 if n mod 3 is not zero. Let me see: for example, if n is 4, then 4/3 is 1, so 1*2=2, plus 1 (since 4 mod3 is 1) gives 3. Wait, but the code says (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1). So when n mod3 is zero, add 0, else add 1. So for n=3, it would be (3/3)*2 +0 = 2. For n=4, (4/3)=1, so 2 +1=3. So the formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). \n\nNow, the first Java program outputs the result, which is then the input for the second program. So the Fortran program must read A and B, compute the first result, then pass that into the second computation, then output the final result.\n\nThe key is to chain the two computations without I/O in between. So in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read A and B from input.\n2. Compute the first result (result1) using the first formula.\n3. Use result1 as the input to the second computation (n in the second Java program).\n4. Compute the second result (result2) using the second formula.\n5. Output result2.\n\nNow, translating the first part: \n\nFirst Java's result is ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)). In Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since we need ceiling, perhaps we can compute (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1). Because (x + y -1)/y gives ceiling(x/y). Let me check:\n\nLet x = B-1, y = A-1. So ceiling(x/y) = (x + y -1)/y. So yes, that formula works. So (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1) would be the same as the original code's calculation. Alternatively, in code:\n\nresult1 = (B-1 + A -2) / (A-1) \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nresult = (B-1)/(A-1) using integer division (so floor). Then if there's a remainder (amari !=0), add 1. So the total is floor((B-1)/(A-1)) + (1 if remainder exists). Which is exactly the ceiling. So the formula (B-1 + (A-2)) divided by (A-1) would give the same as ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)). Let me test with some numbers.\n\nSuppose A=3, B=7. Then (B-1)=6, (A-1)=2. 6/2=3, no remainder, so result is 3. Using the formula (6 +2-1)/2 = (7)/2=3.5 \u2192 3 in integer division? Wait, no, in Fortran, integer division truncates. Wait, in Fortran, if both operands are integers, the division is integer division, which truncates towards zero. So (6 + (2-1)) is 7, divided by 2 gives 3.5 \u2192 3. But in the original code, since remainder is zero, the result is 3. So that works. \n\nAnother example: A=2, B=5. Then (B-1)=4, (A-1)=1. 4/1=4, no remainder \u2192 result 4. The formula (4 +1-1)/1 =4/1=4. Correct.\n\nAnother case where there is a remainder: A=3, B=5. (B-1)=4, (A-1)=2. 4/2=2, no remainder \u2192 result 2. But if B=6, then (5)/2=2.5 \u2192 floor is 2, but remainder is 1, so result is 3. Using the formula (5 + (2-1)) /2 \u2192 (5+1)/2=6/2=3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. So in Fortran, the first result can be computed as (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1). Wait, but in code, variables are integers. So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nresult1 = (B -1 + A -2) / (A -1)\n\nSimplify numerator: (B -1 + A -2) = (A + B -3). So:\n\nresult1 = (A + B -3) / (A -1)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to code it as (B-1 + (A-2)) / (A-1). Either way, same result.\n\nNow the second part: the second Java program takes n (which is result1 here) and computes (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). \n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, so n/3 gives the integer division. The mod can be done with mod(n,3). So the second result is (n/3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 then 1 else 0). \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead A and B from input.\n\nCompute result1 = (B-1 + A-2) / (A-1)\n\nThen compute result2 = (result1 /3)*2 + (1 if mod(result1,3) /=0 else 0)\n\nThen print result2.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nWe need to read two integers from input. Let's see variables. Let me use variables A and B as in the first program. Then compute result1, then compute result2.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: A, B, result1, result2\n\n  ! Read A and B\n  read(*,*) A, B\n\n  ! Compute first result\n  result1 = (B -1 + A -2) / (A -1)\n\n  ! Compute second result\n  result2 = (result1 / 3) * 2\n  if (mod(result1,3) /= 0) then\n    result2 = result2 + 1\n  end if\n\n  ! Output the final result\n  write(*,*) result2\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again for the first part. Let me test with some examples.\n\nTake the first Java code's example. Let's see:\n\nSuppose A=2, B=3. Then according to the first Java code:\n\nresult = (3-1)/(2-1) = 2/1 =2. Since amari is 0, so result is 2. \n\nIn the formula (B-1 + A-2)/(A-1) \u2192 (2 +0)/1 \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: A=3, B=5. Then (5-1)=4, (3-1)=2 \u2192 4/2=2, no remainder \u2192 result 2. The formula (4 + (2-1)) /2 \u2192 (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 in integer division. Correct.\n\nAnother case where there is a remainder: A=3, B=6. (6-1)=5, (3-1)=2 \u2192 5/2=2 with remainder 1. So result is 3. The formula (5 +1)/2 =6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=4, B=7. (7-1)=6, (4-1)=3 \u2192 6/3=2, no remainder \u2192 result 2. The formula (6 +2)/3 \u21928/3=2.666 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Correct.\n\nAnother case where remainder exists: A=5, B=10. (10-1)=9, (5-1)=4 \u2192 9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor is 2, remainder 1. So result is 3. The formula (9 +3)/4 \u219212/4=3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow the second part. Let's take the first example where result1 is 2. Then the second code would compute (2/3)*2 + (since mod(2,3)=2\u22600 \u2192 add 1). So (0)*2 +1 \u21921. Wait, but according to the code in the second Java program, the formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod !=0). So for n=2, (2//3)=0 \u2192 0*2=0, plus 1 \u2192 total 1. So the second result would be 1. \n\nWait, but let me see the code again. The second Java code's solve function is:\n\nSystem.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n\nWait, so for n=2, n/3 is 0, so 0*2=0, plus 1 (since mod is 2\u22600) \u2192 total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if result1 is 3, then (3/3)=1 \u2192 2, plus 0 \u2192 total 2. \n\nAnother example: result1=4 \u2192 4/3=1 \u2192 2 +1 (since mod1) \u21923.\n\nSo the code in Fortran for the second part is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code. Let me write the code step by step.\n\nVariables: A and B are integers. Read them first. Then compute result1 as (B-1 + A-2)/(A-1). Then compute result2 as (result1/3)*2 plus 1 if mod(result1,3) is not zero.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the sign of the divisor. Since A and B are positive (as per problem constraints?), but perhaps we can assume that A>1, since in the first Java code, A-1 is the denominator, so A must be at least 2. So mod(result1,3) will be between 0 and 2. So the condition mod(result1,3)/=0 is correct.\n\nSo the code should be as I wrote before.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is truncating. So for negative numbers, but in this problem, since A and B are inputs from the first program, which presumably are positive integers (since in the first Java code, they are parsed as integers, but the problem might have constraints). But the code as written should handle all cases where A-1 is positive (so A>1). Since in the first Java code, if A-1 is zero (A=1), then division by zero would occur. So the problem must have constraints that A>1. So in the Fortran code, we can assume that A is at least 2, so A-1 is positive, so no division by zero.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting the entire sequence with an example:\n\nSuppose input is A=2, B=3.\n\nFirst program outputs 2. Then second program takes 2 and outputs 1. So the final output is 1.\n\nAnother example: A=3, B=5 \u2192 first result is 2 \u2192 second gives 1.\n\nAnother example: A=2, B=5 \u2192 first result is (5-1)/(2-1)=4 \u2192 so 4. Then second part: 4/3=1 \u2192 2 +1 (since mod1) \u21923. So output 3.\n\nAnother test case: A=3, B=6 \u2192 first result is 3 \u2192 second gives (3/3)*2 +0 \u21922.\n\nAnother case: A=4, B=10 \u2192 first result: (10-1 +4-2)/(4-1) \u2192 (9+2)/3 \u219211/3=3.666 \u2192 integer division gives 3. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, (B-1 + A-2) is (9 + (4-2)=2 \u2192 9+2=11. Divided by 3 (A-1=3). 11/3 is 3.666, so integer division truncates to 3. But according to original code:\n\nOriginal code for A=4, B=10:\n\nB-1=9, A-1=3 \u2192 9/3=3, remainder 0 \u2192 result is 3. So correct. So the formula works here.\n\nThen second part: 3 \u2192 (3/3)*2 +0 \u21922.\n\nAnother example where remainder exists in first step: A=3, B=7 \u2192 (7-1)=6, (3-1)=2 \u21926/2=3, no remainder \u2192 result1=3. Then second part gives 2.\n\nAnother example where first step has remainder: A=3, B=8 \u2192 (8-1)=7, divided by 2 \u21923 with remainder 1 \u2192 so result1=4. Then second part: 4/3=1 \u2192 2 +1 \u21923.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written."
