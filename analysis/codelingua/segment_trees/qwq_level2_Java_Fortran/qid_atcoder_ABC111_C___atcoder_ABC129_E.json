So to make it 0-based, we can use:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\nBut need to check the maximum value in v. The problem says the input is n integers, but the code uses v[i] as an index into the arrays. So the values in v must be between 0 and 100009, otherwise the code would have an out-of-bounds error. So assuming that the input is valid, we can proceed. So steps for first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array v (size n).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs an answer. The second takes that output as input and processes further. But in Fortran, I have to combine them so that the first's output is the input for the second, but without any actual I/O in between. So the entire process must be done in memory.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does.\n\nLooking at the first Java file (ABC111_C):\n\nIt reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. Then it counts occurrences of each number in even and odd indices, plus the total. Then sorts those counts in descending order. Then calculates an answer based on the top counts. The output is the answer.\n\nThe second Java file (ABC129_E):\n\nIt reads a string, then uses a DP approach to compute some value modulo 1e9+7. The DP is based on the characters of the string. The output is the final DP value.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, which is the input for the second? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, and the second program expects a string (since it reads a line as a char array). So that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. The user said the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first outputs a number, and the second expects a string. That would mean that the second program is expecting the first's output as a string input. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input string to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs 123, the second would read \"123\" as the input string.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part must compute the first answer, then pass that as a string to the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (n and array v).\n\n2. Compute the first answer (ans).\n\n3. Use that ans as the input string for the second program's processing.\n\n4. Compute the second answer and output it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first input (n and array v).\n\n- Compute the first part's answer (ans1).\n\n- Then, convert ans1 to a string, which becomes the input for the second part's processing (as if it's the input line for the second Java program).\n\n- Then compute the second part's answer (ans2) using that string.\n\n- Finally, output ans2.\n\nSo the key is to model the first part's processing, then the second part's processing using the first's output as the input string.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (ABC111_C):\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\nRead n, then n integers into array v.\n\nThen, create three arrays vo, ve, vt (for odd, even, total counts). They are initialized to 0. Then, for each element in v:\n\n- Increment vt[v[i]] (total count).\n\n- If the index i is even (0-based?), then increment ve[v[i]], else vo[v[i]].\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. The code says if i%2 ==0 (even index) then ve[v[i]]++, else vo[v[i]]++.\n\nWait, the indices are 0-based. So even indices (0,2,4...) are even, so counted in ve. Odd indices (1,3,5...) in vo.\n\nThen, the arrays vo, ve, vt are sorted in reverse order (descending). But in Java, the Arrays.sort with reverse order sorts the array, but since they are arrays of Integers, the sort is done on the elements. However, in the code, the arrays are initialized with 0s, but only the elements corresponding to the v's values are incremented. Wait, actually, the code uses vt[v[i]]++ etc. Wait, the arrays vo, ve, vt are of size 100010, but the indices are the values of v[i]. So for example, if v[i] is 5, then vo[5] is incremented. So the arrays are acting as frequency counters for the values in v.\n\nWait, but in Java, the arrays are of type Integer, initialized with 0. So for each element in v, the code is incrementing the count at the index equal to the value of v[i]. So for example, if v[i] is 3, then vo[3] is incremented (if i is odd). So the arrays are frequency arrays for the values in v, partitioned into even and odd indices.\n\nThen, after counting, the arrays are sorted in reverse order (so the highest counts come first). But since the arrays are of size 100010, but most elements are 0, sorting them in reverse order would put the non-zero counts first, in descending order.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you sort an array of Integers, the sort is based on the elements. So when you sort vo in reverse order, the elements are reordered so that the highest counts come first. But the original indices (the values of v) are lost. Wait, no, that's a problem. Wait, the code is sorting the entire array, so the indices (which correspond to the actual values of v) are being reordered. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the code is using Arrays.sort on the vo array, which is an array of Integers. So the elements of vo are being sorted, but the indices (which were the original values of v) are no longer associated with their counts. Wait, this is a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, looking at the code again:\n\nThe code initializes vo, ve, vt as arrays of 100010 elements, filled with 0. Then, for each v[i], they increment vo[v[i]] (if i is odd) or ve[v[i]] (if even), and vt[v[i]] (always). So the vo array's index is the value of v[i], and the count is how many times that value occurs in odd indices. Similarly for ve and even indices. Then, the code sorts the vo, ve, and vt arrays in reverse order. But when you sort the array, the indices (the original values) are lost. So after sorting, the first element of vo is the maximum count among all values in odd indices, but we don't know which value it corresponds to. However, in the code's calculation of ans, they only use the top elements of the sorted arrays. The code then checks if the sum of the top elements of vo and ve equals the top of vt. If so, then it takes the minimum of two possibilities, else subtracts the sum of the top vo and ve.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum possible number of elements that can be removed by choosing two different modes for even and odd indices. The logic is a bit unclear, but the key point is that the code's variables are the counts, and after sorting, the top elements are the highest counts. The code's logic is based on the counts, not the actual values, so the sorting is done to get the top counts.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to replicate this process.\n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and the array v. The array v has n elements. The maximum possible value in v is up to 1e5? Because the arrays are size 100010, which is 1e5+10. So in Fortran, we can have arrays of size 100010 for vo, ve, vt.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can make them 0-based. Alternatively, adjust indices. Let me think.\n\nIn Java, the arrays are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 0-based indices by declaring arrays from 0 to 100009 (since 100010 elements). But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless specified. So to make it 0-based, we can use:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\nBut need to check the maximum value in v. The problem says the input is n integers, but the code uses v[i] as an index into the arrays. So the values in v must be between 0 and 100009, otherwise the code would have an out-of-bounds error. So assuming that the input is valid, we can proceed.\n\nSo steps for first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array v (size n).\n\nInitialize vo, ve, vt arrays (size 0:100009) to 0.\n\nLoop over each element in v (i from 1 to n, since Fortran is 1-based). Wait, in Java, the loop is from 0 to n-1 (0-based). So in Fortran, the first element is i=1 (Java's 0), so the index in Java is (i-1) in Fortran. So for each element v(i) in Fortran (which is v[i] in Java), the index in Java is (i-1). So the parity check is (i-1) mod 2 ==0 ?\n\nYes. So for Fortran's i from 1 to n:\n\nif (i-1) mod 2 ==0 (even index in Java) then increment ve(v(i)), else vo(v(i)).\n\nAlso, increment vt(v(i)) for all.\n\nThen, after counting, we need to sort the arrays vo, ve, vt in descending order of their elements. But in Fortran, how to sort an array in descending order?\n\nWe can use the 'sort' intrinsic with a custom comparator, but perhaps it's easier to create a list of the elements, sort them, and then assign back. Alternatively, use a temporary array.\n\nAlternatively, since we only need the top elements (the first few elements after sorting), perhaps we can find the maximum elements without sorting the entire array. Wait, but the code in Java sorts the entire array. Let me see:\n\nThe code in Java sorts the arrays vo, ve, vt in reverse order (descending). Then, the first element of each is the maximum count. The second element is the next maximum, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, to get the top elements, we can sort the arrays in descending order.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, for each array, we can collect all the non-zero elements, sort them in descending order, and then take the first two elements. But perhaps the code's approach is to sort the entire array, which includes a lot of zeros, but the first elements are the top counts.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses Arrays.sort with reverse order. The Arrays.sort for an array of Integers will sort all elements, so the first element after sorting is the maximum count, the second is the next, etc. So even if there are many zeros, the first elements are the top counts.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to sort the arrays in descending order, we can do the following:\n\nFor each array (vo, ve, vt):\n\n- Create an array of the elements (since they are 0-based in Java, but in Fortran, the indices are 0 to 100009).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the arrays are 0-based here. So for each array, we can loop through all elements, collect their values, sort them in descending order, and then store them back into the array? No, that would overwrite the original indices. Wait, no, the code in Java is sorting the entire array, so after sorting, the elements are reordered. But the original indices (the values of v) are lost. However, the code only uses the first elements of the sorted arrays. So the actual indices after sorting don't matter, only the top counts.\n\nWait, the code after sorting does:\n\nvo is sorted in reverse order, so vo(1) (assuming 1-based) would be the maximum count. Wait, in Java, after sorting, the first element (index 0) is the maximum. So in Fortran, if we sort the array in descending order, the first element (index 0) would be the maximum.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if the array is 0-based, then after sorting in descending order, the first element (index 0) is the largest.\n\nSo the steps for sorting in Fortran:\n\nWe can use the 'sort' function with a custom comparator. Alternatively, use a temporary array.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to sort an array in descending order:\n\ncall merge_sort(arr, 1, size(arr), .descend)\n\nBut I need to write a sorting routine or use a library function. Alternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic with a reverse.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, the 'sort' intrinsic can be used with a key and a mask, but perhaps it's easier to use a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to sort an array in descending order:\n\ninteger :: temp\ndo i = 1, size(arr)\n   do j = i+1, size(arr)\n      if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then\n          temp = arr(i)\n          arr(i) = arr(j)\n          arr(j) = temp\n      end if\n   end do\nend do\n\nBut that's a bubble sort, which is O(n^2). Since the arrays are 1e5 elements, this would be too slow. So need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in 'sort' function with a custom comparator. Wait, in Fortran, the 'sort' intrinsic can take an optional argument for the order. Wait, no, the 'sort' function in Fortran is a bit limited. Let me check.\n\nThe Fortran standard sort function (intrinsic) is in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module, but I might be mistaken. Alternatively, the 'sort' function is part of the standard library. Wait, perhaps I can use the 'merge_sort' function from the standard library, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function with a key array. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to use the 'sort' function with a custom comparator via a subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function and then reverse the array.\n\nWait, the 'sort' function sorts in ascending order by default. So if I sort the array in ascending order, then reverse it, that would give descending order.\n\nYes, that's a possibility.\n\nSo steps for each array:\n\n1. Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n2. Reverse the array.\n\nThus, the first element will be the largest.\n\nSo in code:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\ncall reverse(array)\n\nBut how to reverse an array in Fortran?\n\nThere's a reverse function in the standard library? Or we can write a loop.\n\nAlternatively, here's code to reverse an array:\n\ninteger :: i, temp\ndo i = 1, size(array)/2\n   temp = array(i)\n   array(i) = array(size(array)+1 -i)\n   array(size(array)+1 -i) = temp\nend do\n\nWait, but the array is 0-based. So the indices are from 0 to 100009. So the size is 100010 elements. So the loop would be from 1 to 50005 (half of 100010). Wait, but the array is 0-based, so the indices are 0 to 100009. So the total elements are 100010. So the middle is at 50005.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use:\n\ndo i = 0, (size(array)-1)/2\n\n   temp = array(i)\n   array(i) = array(size(array)-1 -i)\n   array(size(array)-1 -i) = temp\nend do\n\nYes, that would work for 0-based arrays.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each array (vo, ve, vt):\n\ncall sort(array)  ! sorts in ascending order\n\ncall reverse(array)  ! reverses to descending order\n\nBut the 'sort' function in Fortran sorts in ascending order. So this approach would work.\n\nWait, but the 'sort' function in Fortran is for arrays of default kind integers. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the sort function is available for integer arrays. So:\n\ncall sort(vo)\n\ncall reverse(vo)\n\nSame for ve and vt.\n\nOnce the arrays are sorted in descending order, then the code proceeds to compute ans.\n\nThe code then checks if vo(0) + ve(0) == vt(0). If so, then ans is the minimum between (n - vo(0) - ve(1)) and (n - vo(1) - ve(0)). Else, ans is n - vo(0) - ve(0).\n\nWait, in Java, the arrays are 0-based, so the first element is [0], second [1], etc.\n\nIn Fortran, after sorting and reversing, the first element (index 0) is the maximum.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nif (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0]) then\n\n   ans = min( n - vo[0] - ve[1], n - vo[1] - ve[0] )\n\nelse\n\n   ans = n - vo[0] - ve[0]\n\nend if\n\nWait, but why?\n\nThe problem is probably about choosing two different modes for even and odd indices to maximize the number of deletions. The explanation might be that when the top two counts (from even and odd) sum to the total top count, there's an overlap, so we have to choose the second best for one of them.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic must be replicated.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (ABC129_E):\n\nThis program reads a string, then uses a DP approach. The DP is a 2D array of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of the string. The DP transitions depend on the current character.\n\nThe DP starts with dp[0][0] = 1. The transitions are a bit complex.\n\nThe problem is to compute the number of valid sequences under some constraints, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe key is to translate the DP logic into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input is a string. The first program's output (ans1) is an integer, which is converted to a string and becomes the input for the second program.\n\nSo in the Fortran program, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string as the input for the second part.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\n- Convert ans1 to a string s.\n\n- Compute the DP based on s's characters.\n\n- Output the final result mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: ans1\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\nBut need to ensure that the string is properly null-terminated or handled as a character array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of sufficient length.\n\nNow, the DP array in the second Java program is a 2D array of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of the string. The initial state is dp[0][0] = 1.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\nFor each character in the string (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n   if current char is '0':\n\n      dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n      dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n   else:\n\n      dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\n   Then, depending on the character:\n\n   if '0':\n\n      dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n   else:\n\n      dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M\n\n      dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n   Then mod M again for both.\n\nWait, the code in Java has some nested conditions. Let me parse it again.\n\nLooking at the Java code for the second program:\n\nThe loop is over each character in s (i from 0 to n-1):\n\nInside the loop:\n\nFirst block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nThen, another block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, so the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and [1] based on the current character, then the second part adds more based on the same condition.\n\nWait, the first part is:\n\nIf the current character is '0', then the next dp's 0 and 1 are same as current's 0 and 1. Else, the next 1 is sum of current 0 and 1.\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nIf the character is '0', then add 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1].\n\nElse, add 2*dp[i][0] to dp[i+1][0], and 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, but the first part already set some values, and the second part adds to them.\n\nSo the code is combining two conditions. Let me rephrase:\n\nFor each character s[i]:\n\nFirst, set the next dp's 0 and 1 based on the first condition (whether it's '0' or not).\n\nThen, add the contributions from the second part (the '0' or not again).\n\nWait, but the second part's condition is the same as the first. So the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, handle the first part (the initial assignment), then handle the second part (the addition).\n\nSo for '0' characters:\n\nFirst part: dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0], dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1].\n\nThen, second part: add (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1].\n\nSo the total for dp[i+1][1] becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1] ?\n\nWait, no, because the first part sets it to dp[i][1], then adds 2*dp[i][1], so total 3*dp[i][1].\n\nWait, but modulo M each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that the first part is the base, and the second part adds more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with two separate if statements, so the first part is executed, then the second part is executed again based on the same condition.\n\nSo for a '0' character:\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1]\n\nThen mod M.\n\nFor a non-'0' character (i.e., '1'):\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is not '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 so becomes (original 0? Wait, the first part didn't set dp[i+1][0], so it's 0? Or was it initialized?\n\nWait, in Java, the dp array is initialized to 0 except dp[0][0] =1. So in the first part, for non-'0' characters, the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0 (since it wasn't assigned). Then in the second part, the code adds to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nThe first part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nSo for non-'0' characters, the first part only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0 (since it wasn't assigned). Then, in the second part:\n\nelse (non '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M \u2192 so adding to the current value (0) gives 2*dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 adding to the first part's value (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) gives (dp[i][0]+dp[i][1]) + 2*dp[i][1] = dp[i][0] + 3 dp[i][1]\n\nWait, but modulo M each time.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. So the code's logic is:\n\nFor each character, first set the next dp's values based on the first condition, then add the contributions from the second condition.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code must be structured similarly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the DP array can be declared as a 2D array of integers, with dimensions (0:n, 0:1), where n is the length of the string s (the converted ans1).\n\nWait, the string s is the output of the first program, which is an integer. So the length can be up to, say, 10 digits (if n is up to 1e5, but the first program's output is an integer which could be up to n, so maybe up to 5 digits? Not sure, but in Fortran, we can handle it dynamically.\n\nWait, in the second part, the string is the output of the first program, which is an integer. So the maximum possible length of the string is, say, 10 characters (for numbers up to 1e9). So in Fortran, we can read the string as a character array of sufficient length, say 20.\n\nSo steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing ans1 (the first program's output), convert it to a string s.\n\nThen, n = len_trim(s)\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp(0:n, 0:1) with dp(0,0) = 1, dp(0,1) =0.\n\nThen loop over each character in s (from 1 to n, since Fortran is 1-based for strings? Or 0-based? Wait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based by default. So s(1) is the first character.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the string is stored as a character array, so s(1) is the first character.\n\nSo for i from 1 to n:\n\n   current_char = s(i)\n\n   if current_char == '0' then:\n\n      dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n      dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n   else:\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   end if\n\n   if current_char == '0' then:\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   else:\n\n      dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + 2*dp(i-1,0), M )\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   end if\n\nWait, but in the first part (the first if-else), for non-'0' characters, the first part sets dp(i,1) but leaves dp(i,0) as 0 (since it wasn't assigned). Then in the second part, the else clause adds to dp(i,0) and dp(i,1).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0, so if we don't set dp(i,0) in the first part, it remains 0. So the code above would work.\n\nWait, but in the first part, for non-'0' characters, the first part sets dp(i,1) to (dp(i-1,0)+dp(i-1,1)) mod M, and leaves dp(i,0) as 0 (since it wasn't assigned). Then in the second part, the else clause adds 2*dp(i-1,0) to dp(i,0), so dp(i,0) becomes 2*dp(i-1,0). And adds 2*dp(i-1,1) to dp(i,1), so dp(i,1) becomes (original value) + 2*dp(i-1,1).\n\nWait, but the first part's assignment to dp(i,1) is before the second part's addition. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code for the second part would look like this.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe overall structure is:\n\nRead the input for the first program (n and array v).\n\nCompute ans1 using the first part's logic.\n\nConvert ans1 to a string s.\n\nCompute ans2 using the second part's logic on s.\n\nOutput ans2.\n\nNow, let's start writing the code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and the array v.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, i, v(100010)  ! Wait, but n can be up to 1e5, so the array needs to be size n. But in Fortran, we can read the array dynamically. Alternatively, since the Java code uses 100010 as the array size, perhaps we can preallocate.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the array v is declared as new int[100010], but the loop runs for i from 0 to n-1. So the actual size needed is n. But in Fortran, we can read n first, then allocate the array. But since the maximum n is up to 1e5, perhaps we can preallocate.\n\nAlternatively, use a fixed size array of 100010 elements.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 100010\n\ninteger :: n, v(maxn)\n\nread*, n\n\nread*, (v(i), i=1,n)\n\nWait, but in the input, after n, there are n integers. So the second read statement would read n integers into v(1) to v(n).\n\nThen, initialize the vo, ve, vt arrays.\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\n! Initialize to 0 (Fortran does this automatically for variables declared in a program, but better to set explicitly?)\n\n! Wait, in Fortran, variables are initialized to 0 if not assigned. So perhaps we can skip initialization.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps set all to 0.\n\ndo i = 0, 100009\n\n   vo(i) = 0\n\n   ve(i) = 0\n\n   vt(i) = 0\n\nend do\n\nThen, loop over each element in v:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   val = v(i)\n\n   vt(val) = vt(val) +1\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then  ! since i is 1-based, i-1 is 0-based index. If even (0,2, etc.), then even index.\n\n      ve(val) = ve(val) +1\n\n   else\n\n      vo(val) = vo(val) +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, sort the arrays vo, ve, vt in descending order.\n\nFirst, sort each array in ascending order, then reverse.\n\nsubroutine sort_and_reverse(arr)\n\n   integer, dimension(0:100009), intent(inout) :: arr\n\n   call sort(arr)  ! sorts in ascending order\n\n   ! reverse the array\n\n   integer :: temp, j\n\n   do j = 0, (size(arr)-1)/2\n\n      temp = arr(j)\n\n      arr(j) = arr(size(arr)-1 -j)\n\n      arr(size(arr)-1 -j) = temp\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nThen, call this subroutine for each array:\n\ncall sort_and_reverse(vo)\n\ncall sort_and_reverse(ve)\n\ncall sort_and_reverse(vt)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort function is part of the intrinsic. Wait, the 'sort' function is in the intrinsic module, but I need to make sure it's available. Alternatively, use the 'merge_sort' function. Alternatively, use a bubble sort, but that's not feasible for large arrays.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module. Wait, perhaps the code can use the built-in sort.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the sort function is part of the standard library. The syntax is:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\nBut this sorts the array in ascending order. So the above code for the subroutine is correct.\n\nOnce the arrays are sorted, compute ans1.\n\nans1 = 0\n\nif (vo(0) + ve(0) == vt(0)) then\n\n   temp1 = n - vo(0) - ve(1)\n\n   temp2 = n - vo(1) - ve(0)\n\n   ans1 = min(temp1, temp2)\n\nelse\n\n   ans1 = n - vo(0) - ve(0)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the arrays are 0-based, so the first element is (0).\n\nNow, moving to the second part.\n\nConvert ans1 to a string s.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\n\ninteger :: M = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: dp(0:len_s, 0:1)\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\ndp(0,1) = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n      dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n      dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   end if\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + 2*dp(i-1,0), M )\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M )\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Apply mod M again for both\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0), M)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1), M)\n\nend do\n\nThe final answer is (dp(len_s,0) + dp(len_s,1)) mod M.\n\nThen, print it.\n\nprint*, mod( dp(len_s,0) + dp(len_s,1), M )\n\nPutting all together, but need to make sure the code is in one program.\n\nNow, some possible issues:\n\n1. The sorting subroutine must be inside the program or in a module. Since it's a small program, perhaps include it as an internal subroutine.\n\n2. The arrays for vo, ve, vt are large (1e5 elements). In Fortran, this is manageable, but need to ensure that the compiler can handle it.\n\n3. The string conversion must be correct. The write statement may pad with spaces, so using len_trim is important.\n\n4. The DP array's size depends on the length of the string, which is determined after computing ans1. So the DP array must be dynamically sized. However, in Fortran, arrays can be allocated dynamically.\n\nWait, in the current code, the DP array is declared with size (0:len_s, 0:1). But len_s is determined after ans1 is computed. So we need to use an allocatable array.\n\nAh, right! So the DP array can't be declared with a fixed size because len_s is not known until runtime. So we need to use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo modifying the second part:\n\nAfter computing ans1 and converting to s:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate( dp(0:len_s, 0:1) )\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\nThen proceed with the loop.\n\nBut in Fortran, the allocation must be done before using the array.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\n...\n\n! After computing ans1:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\nallocate( dp(0:len_s, 0:1) )\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\n...\n\nThen, after the loop, deallocate.\n\nBut in the code, after the loop, we can compute the result and then deallocate.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe full Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: maxn = 100010\n\n   integer :: n, i, val, ans1\n\n   integer, dimension(0:100009) :: vo, ve, vt\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: len_s, M = 1000000007\n\n   !

The size of the array is fixed (0:100009), so that's okay.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\n- The sorting subroutine must be inside the program or in a module. Since I used 'contains', it's okay.\n\n- The arrays vo, ve, vt are declared with 0:100009, which is correct.\n\n- The v array is declared as v(maxn), but maxn is 100010. Wait, in the code above, v is declared as integer :: v(maxn), but maxn is 100010. So v(1) to v(100010). But the loop reads up to n, which is <=1e5, so that's okay.\n\n- The sorting of the arrays: the sort function sorts the entire array, which is correct.\n\n- The calculation of ans1: the indices are correct (0-based).\n\n- The string conversion: using write(s, '(i0)') ans1 should give the correct string without leading spaces. len_trim(s) will get the length.\n\n- The DP array allocation: len_s is the length of the string, so the DP array is 0:len_s (inclusive), which is correct.\n\n- The loop over the characters: from 1 to len_s, which is correct for Fortran's 1-based strings.\n\n- The mod operations: in Fortran, mod(a,b) returns a remainder with the same sign as b. Since all values are positive, it's okay.\n\n- The final result is mod( dp(len_s,0)+dp(len_s,1), M ), which matches the Java code's (dp[n][0]+dp[n][1])%M.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. The sort function in the sort_and_reverse subroutine may not work as expected. The 'sort' function in Fortran sorts the array in ascending order. Then reversing it gives descending order. Let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose the array is [3,1,2]. After sorting, it becomes [1,2,3], then reversed to [3,2,1]. So yes, that's correct.\n\n2. The vo, ve, vt arrays are of size 0:100009, which is 100010 elements. The loop for initializing them to 0 is necessary because in Fortran, variables are initialized to 0, but perhaps the compiler may not guarantee that for arrays. So better to set them explicitly.\n\n3. The v array is declared as v(maxn), but in the code above, the read statement is read*, (v(i), i=1,n). So if n exceeds maxn, it would be a problem. But according to the problem's first Java code, the array is declared as 100010 elements, so n is up to 1e5, which is within maxn (1e5+10). So it's okay.\n\n4. The DP array is allocated as 0:len_s, which is correct because the loop runs from 1 to len_s, and the initial state is 0.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when counting ve and vo, the indices are correct. For example, for i from 1 to n (Fortran's 1-based), the Java's index is i-1. So mod(i-1,2) ==0 means even index in Java.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs would be good, but since I can't do that here, I'll proceed.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should look like the above."
