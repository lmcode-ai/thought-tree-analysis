    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC125_C. It reads N integers from input, stores them in array A. Then it computes two arrays L and R. L is the array where each element is the GCD of all elements from the start up to that index. R is similar but from the end backwards. Then it calculates the maximum GCD between L[N-2], R[1], and for each i between 1 and N-2, the GCD of L[i-1] and R[i+1]. The final answer is the maximum of all these.\n\nThe second Java file, codeforces_622_A, reads a long integer (position) and calculates some value based on it. The solve function finds the nearest sequence start index and computes the position's value. The getValueAtIndex function seems to compute the starting value of a block given an index. The main function reads the input and writes the output.\n\nWait, but the user said the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each being the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the code, the first program's output is the answer from the first problem, and the second program's input is a single number. So the first program's output is the input to the second program?\n\nWait, the user says the entire sequence is to be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. Therefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as input to the second program's logic, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is the answer from the first problem, which is then the input to the second Java program. So the sequence is: run first Java program, take its output, run second Java program with that output as input, and the final output is the second program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program (the N and the array A), compute the first program's result (the maximum GCD), then use that result as the input to the second program's logic (the position variable in the second Java program), and then output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the array A (from user input).\n2. Compute the first program's answer (max GCD).\n3. Use that answer as the 'position' input for the second program.\n4. Compute the second program's result based on that position.\n5. Output the second program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must combine both steps into one, without any intermediate I/O except for the initial input and final output.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first program's main steps are:\n\n- Read N and array A.\n- Compute L array (left GCDs).\n- Compute R array (right GCDs).\n- Compute the maximum between L[N-2], R[1], and for each i from 1 to N-2, GCD(L[i-1], R[i+1]).\n\nThe GCD function is implemented in Java. In Fortran, I can write a GCD function. Since Fortran uses functions with parameters, I need to implement that.\n\nSecond part (second Java program):\n\nThe second program takes a position (the first program's output) and calculates the answer based on that. The key functions here are the solve function and getValueAtIndex.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is straightforward: returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. So in Fortran, that's easy.\n\nThe solve function does:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx to 1. Then loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position: multiply by 2. Then loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position: increment. Then compute startIndex as getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nGiven position (from first program's output), compute the result as per the second program's logic.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read N and the array A. Then compute the first program's answer (max GCD). Then use that as the position for the second program's calculation, then output the result of the second program.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, declare variables. Since the first part uses integers, and the second part uses long integers (Java's long is 64-bit, but in Fortran, we can use integer(8) for 64-bit integers).\n\nThe first part:\n\nRead N, then read N integers into an array A.\n\nCompute L and R arrays. L is size N, R is size N.\n\nInitialize L(1) = A(1). Then loop from 2 to N, L(i) = gcd(L(i-1), A(i)).\n\nSimilarly, R(N) = A(N). Then loop from N-1 down to 1, R(i) = gcd(R(i+1), A(i)).\n\nThen compute the maximum between L(N-1) (since in Java, indices start at 0, so L[N-2] is the second last element here?), wait need to check indices carefully.\n\nWait in Java, the first program's L array is 0-based. So L[0] = A[0], then for i from 1 to N-1, L[i] = gcd(L[i-1], A[i]). So L has N elements. The first program's answer is the maximum between L[N-2], R[1], and the GCDs between L[i-1] and R[i+1] for i from 1 to N-2 (since in Java, i runs from 1 to N-2 inclusive).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So in Fortran, the L array will be 1-based. So for N elements, L(1) = A(1), then for i from 2 to N, L(i) = gcd(L(i-1), A(i)). The R array is R(N) = A(N), then for i from N-1 down to 1, R(i) = gcd(R(i+1), A(i)).\n\nThe first part's answer is the maximum between L(N-1) (since L[N-2] in Java is L(N-1) in Fortran?), R(2) (since R[1] in Java is R(2) in Fortran?), and for each i from 2 to N-1 (since in Java i runs from 1 to N-2, which in Fortran would be 2 to N-1?), compute GCD(L(i-1), R(i+1)), and take the maximum over all those.\n\nWait let me recheck indices:\n\nJava's L array is 0-based. The first element is L[0] = A[0]. The last element is L[N-1], which is the GCD of all elements up to A[N-1]. The first program's answer starts with answer = max(L[N-2], R[1]). In Java, L[N-2] is the second to last element of L (since N-1 is the last index). R[1] is the second element of R (since R is 0-based, R[1] is the second element). \n\nIn Fortran, L is 1-based. So L(N-1) corresponds to L[N-2] in Java (since Java's L has indices 0 to N-1, so L[N-2] is the second to last element, which in Fortran is L(N-1)). Similarly, R(2) corresponds to R[1] in Java (since R in Java is 0-based, so R[1] is the second element in Fortran's 1-based array).\n\nThe loop in Java is for (int i = 1; i < N-1; i++), so i runs from 1 to N-2 (since in Java, the upper limit is exclusive). In Fortran, the loop would be from i=2 to i=N-2 (since in Fortran, the first element is 1, so the equivalent indices would be 2 to N-1-1? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait in Java, the loop is for (i from 1 to N-2 inclusive). Because the loop is for (i=1; i < N-1; i++). So when N-1 is the upper limit, the loop runs up to i = N-2. So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=2 to i = N-1 (since in Fortran, the first element is 1, so the equivalent of Java's i=1 is Fortran's i=2? Wait no, perhaps I need to adjust the indices properly.\n\nWait let me think again:\n\nJava's loop for i from 1 to N-2 (inclusive):\n\nIn Java, the loop is for (int i = 1; i < N-1; i++). So the condition is i < N-1, so the maximum i is N-2.\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be a loop from i=2 to i = N-2 (since in Fortran, the first element is 1, so the indices are shifted by 1). Wait no, perhaps not. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in Java, the loop runs i from 1 to N-2 (inclusive). The equivalent in Fortran would be i from 2 to N-1 (since in Fortran, the first element is 1, so the Java's i=1 corresponds to Fortran's i=2? Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop variable i starts at 1 (Java's second element) and goes up to N-2 (Java's index N-2). So in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the first element is 1, so the equivalent indices would be from 2 (Java's i=1) up to (N-2 +1) = N-1? Wait no, perhaps the Fortran indices for the loop would be from 2 to N-1 (since Java's i=1 is the second element, which is Fortran's 2, and Java's i=N-2 is the (N-2 +1) = N-1 in Fortran). So the loop in Fortran would be from i=2 to i=N-1 (inclusive).\n\nTherefore, in the loop for the intermediate steps, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 2, N-1\n\nthen compute the GCD of L(i-1) and R(i+1). Wait, but in Java, for each i (starting at 1), the code is GCD(L[i-1], R[i+1]). So in Fortran, for i starting at 2 (Java's i=1), the L(i-1) would be L(1) (Java's L[0]), and R(i+1) would be R(3) (Java's R[2]). Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices properly.\n\nWait let's take an example. Suppose N=5 (Java's indices 0-4). Then in Java, the loop runs i from 1 to 3 (since N-1 is 4, so i <4 \u2192 up to 3). For i=1 (Java), the GCD is L[0] and R[2]. In Fortran, the indices would be 1-based. So L(1) is Java's L[0], R(3) is Java's R[2]. So in Fortran, for i=2 (since Java's i=1 is Fortran's i=2?), the L(i-1) is L(1) (Java's L[0]), and R(i+1) is R(3) (Java's R[2]). So yes, the loop in Fortran would be from i=2 to N-1 (since N-1 in Fortran is Java's N-2).\n\nTherefore, the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 2, N-1\n\n    current_gcd = gcd(L(i-1), R(i+1))\n\n    if (current_gcd > answer) then\n\n        answer = current_gcd\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait but the initial answer is set to the maximum of L(N-1) (Java's L[N-2]) and R(2) (Java's R[1]). So the initial answer is max(L(N-1), R(2)), then loop over the rest.\n\nSo the first part's answer is computed correctly.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem: the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program takes a position (the first program's output) and computes the result as per the code.\n\nThe code in Java for the second program:\n\nsolve() function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position \u2192 multiply by 2.\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position \u2192 increment.\n\nThen startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx).\n\nResult is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nIn Fortran, this is straightforward.\n\nSo in Fortran, given the position (the first program's answer), we need to compute the result as per the second program's logic.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N and the array A (as integers).\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (max GCD).\n\n3. Use that answer as the position for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result.\n\n5. Output the second part's result.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read N, then an array of N integers. Let's use integer arrays.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, L, R\n\nBut since we can know N at runtime, we can read N first, then allocate the arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since in the first part, N is known, we can read N, then allocate arrays of size N.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can also use a fixed size if we read N first. Let's see.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, i, answer_part1, current_gcd\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, L, R\n\n    integer(8) :: position, result_part2, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n\n    ! Read input for first part\n\n    read*, N\n\n    allocate(A(N), L(N), R(N))\n\n    read*, A(1:N)\n\n    ! Compute L array\n\n    L(1) = A(1)\n\n    do i = 2, N\n\n        L(i) = gcd(L(i-1), A(i))\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute R array\n\n    R(N) = A(N)\n\n    do i = N-1, 1, -1\n\n        R(i) = gcd(R(i+1), A(i))\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute the maximum between L(N-1) and R(2)\n\n    answer_part1 = max(L(N-1), R(2))\n\n    ! Now loop through the middle elements\n\n    do i = 2, N-1\n\n        current_gcd = gcd(L(i-1), R(i+1))\n\n        if (current_gcd > answer_part1) then\n\n            answer_part1 = current_gcd\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, answer_part1 is the first program's output, which is the position for the second part.\n\n    position = answer_part1\n\n    ! Now compute the second part's result.\n\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n\n    ! First loop: while getValue < position, multiply by 2.\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position)\n\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Second loop: while getValue at (nrst+1) <= position, increment.\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position)\n\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n    result_part2 = (position - startIndex) + 1\n\n    ! Output the result_part2\n\n    print*, result_part2\n\n    ! Deallocate arrays\n\n    deallocate(A, L, R)\n\ncontains\n\n    integer function gcd(a, b)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n\n        integer :: tmp, r\n\n        gcd = a\n\n        if (b > a) then\n\n            tmp = a\n\n            a = b\n\n            b = tmp\n\n        end if\n\n        if (b == 0) then\n\n            gcd = a\n\n            return\n\n        end if\n\n        do\n\n            r = mod(a, b)\n\n            a = b\n\n            b = r\n\n            if (r == 0) exit\n\n        end do\n\n        gcd = a\n\n    end function gcd\n\n    integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n        getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index -1)*index / 2\n\n    end function getValueAtIndex\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the GCD function, the parameters are integers. Since in the first part, the numbers are integers (as per the first Java program's input), so the GCD function is okay. The second part uses 64-bit integers (since the position can be up to the maximum of the first program's output, which could be up to the GCD of large numbers, but in the second program, the position is a long in Java, so in Fortran, using integer(8) is correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the answer_part1 is an integer (since the first program's input is integers, and GCD is computed between integers). So when we assign position = answer_part1, which is an integer, but in Fortran, position is declared as integer(8), so that's okay. The assignment will cast it to 8-byte integer.\n\nNow, checking the loops in the second part:\n\nThe first loop in Java is while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position). So in Fortran, the loop is a do while loop. The same logic applies.\n\nThe second loop is while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position). So in Fortran, the same.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is correctly implemented.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's answer is 1. Then the second program's position is 1. Let's see:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(1) is 1. So the first loop: check getValue(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2. Since 2 is not less than 1, the loop doesn't run. Then the second loop: check getValue(2) is 2. 2 <=1? No. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1. startIndex is 1. The result is (1-1)+1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: position=3.\n\ngetValue(2) is 2, getValue(3)= 1 + (3*2)/2 = 4. So first loop: check getValue(2*1=2) is 2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u2192 nrst becomes 2. Now check getValue(4) \u2192 1 + (4*3)/2 = 7. 7 <3? No. So exit first loop.\n\nNow second loop: check getValue(2+1=3) \u21924 <=3? No. So nrst remains 2. startIndex is getValue(2)=2. So result is 3-2 +1 =2. Which is correct because the sequence for index 2 is 2, and the next starts at 4. So position 3 is in the block starting at 2, so 3-2+1=2.\n\nAnother test case: position=4. Then the first loop:\n\nStart with nrst=1. getValue(2)=2 <4 \u2192 yes. nrst becomes 2. Now check getValue(4)=7 <4? No. So first loop stops. Then second loop: check getValue(3)=4 <=4 \u2192 yes. So increment nrst to 3. Now check getValue(4)=7 <=4? No. So nrst is 3. startIndex is getValue(3)=4. So result is 4-4+1=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check the GCD function in Fortran. The Java GCD function uses a loop with do-while (r !=0). The Fortran code uses a do loop with exit when r==0. That should be equivalent.\n\nWait in the Java code, the GCD function:\n\npublic static int gcd(int a, int b) {\n\n    int tmp;\n\n    if (b > a) {\n\n        tmp = a;\n\n        a = b;\n\n        b = tmp;\n\n    }\n\n    if (b == 0) {\n\n        return a;\n\n    }\n\n    int r = -1;\n\n    do {\n\n        r = a % b;\n\n        a = b;\n\n        b = r;\n\n    } while (r != 0);\n\n    return a;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran's function:\n\ngcd = a\n\nif (b > a) swap a and b.\n\nif b is zero, return a.\n\nElse, loop:\n\nr = mod(a, b)\n\na = b\n\nb = r\n\nloop until r is zero.\n\nWait in the Fortran code, after swapping, the code proceeds. Let me see:\n\nWait in the Fortran code:\n\nThe function starts with gcd = a, but then if b > a, swaps a and b. So after swapping, a is the larger, b the smaller. Then, if b is zero, return a (the original a after swap? Wait no, after swapping, a is the original b, and b is the original a? Wait let me see:\n\nWait in the code:\n\nif (b > a) then\n\n    tmp = a\n\n    a = b\n\n    b = tmp\n\nend if\n\nSo after this, a is the larger, b the smaller. Then, if (b ==0), return a (which is the original larger, so correct).\n\nElse, enter the loop.\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo\n\n    r = mod(a, b)\n\n    a = b\n\n    b = r\n\n    if (r ==0) exit\n\nend do\n\nWait the loop is a do loop, and the exit is when r is zero. So the loop continues until r is zero. Then, the gcd is a (since after the last step, when r is zero, a is the previous b, which is the GCD).\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose a=8, b=4.\n\nAfter swapping (if needed, here a is already larger), then b is 4.\n\nThen, since b is not zero, enter loop.\n\nr = mod(8,4)=0. So r is zero \u2192 exit loop.\n\nThen, the gcd is a (which is 4). Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=9, b=6.\n\nAfter swapping, a=9, b=6.\n\nr = mod(9,6)=3 \u2192 a becomes 6, b becomes 3.\n\nNext iteration: r = mod(6,3)=0 \u2192 exit. So gcd is 3.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the GCD function is correct.\n\nNow, the arrays in Fortran are 1-based. So all indices are handled correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should work."
