    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C). The main part reads input using an InputReader, then calls the solve method. The solve method takes a string, which is the input. It processes this string in two ways: one from left to right, flipping characters when they are the same as the previous, counting the changes (a1). The other is processing from right to left, flipping the previous character when duplicates are found, counting a2. Then it outputs the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads an integer N. It then counts numbers from 357 up to N that contain at least one '3', '5', and '7'. Additionally, there's a loop that generates numbers by some process involving building a new number from digits, but I need to look closer. Wait, the code in the loop seems a bit more complex. Let me parse it again.\n\nWait, the second program's loop starts with i=357 and increments? Or is it generating numbers in a different way? Let me see the code again. The loop is while i <= N. The code inside the loop checks if the current number (as a string) contains all three digits 3,5,7. If so, it increments c. Then there's a part where they build a new number. The code uses a StringBuilder to process the digits of the current number. The process seems to be modifying the digits in some way to get the next i. Hmm, perhaps the next number is generated by appending digits in a specific way. Let me see:\n\nThe code for generating the next i is a bit tricky. The current number is converted to a string s. Then, they create a new string using a loop over the digits in reverse. The loop starts from the end of the string and builds the new string. The logic is:\n\n- For each character in reverse (starting from the last character), if 'f' is false, then:\n   - if the current character is '3', replace it with '5' and set f to true.\n   - if it's '5', replace with '7' and set f to true.\n   - else, append '3'.\n- If f is true, just append the current character.\n- After the loop, if f is still false, append '3' to the string.\n- Then reverse the string and parse it as the next i.\n\nWait, this seems like a way to generate the next number in some sequence. The process is a bit hard to follow. Let me think of an example. Suppose the current number is 357. The string is \"357\". The loop processes each character in reverse (so '7', '5', '3').\n\nStarting with j=0 (the first character in reverse is '7'), since f is false, check the character. Since it's '7', which is not 3 or 5, so append '3'? Wait, no. Wait the code says:\n\nfor each j from 0 to s.length()-1:\n\nWait, the loop is for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) but the index is s.length() -1 -j. So for j=0, it's the last character of s. For j=1, the second last, etc. So processing from the end to the start.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n    char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n    if (f) {\n        sb.append(a);\n    } else {\n        if (a == '3') {\n            sb.append('5');\n            f = true;\n        } else if (a == '5') {\n            sb.append('7');\n            f = true;\n        } else {\n            sb.append('3');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo for each character in reverse order (starting from the end), if f is false, then decide what to append. The first character (the last digit of the original number) is processed first. \n\nLet me take an example. Let's say the current number is 357 (string \"357\"). The first character in reverse is '7' (j=0). Since f is false, check if it's 3 or 5. It's 7, so append '3'? Wait, no. Wait the code says else (if it's not 3 or 5), then append '3'? So for '7', since it's not 3 or 5, we append '3', and f remains false? Wait, no, the code says:\n\nelse (the a is not 3 or 5), then append '3', but f is not set to true. So in this case, after processing '7', the sb has '3', and f is still false.\n\nThen next j=1: the next character is '5' (second last in original string). Since f is still false, check if it's 3 or 5. It's 5, so append '7', set f to true. Now f is true.\n\nThen j=2: the first character of the original string is '3'. Since f is now true, we just append '3'.\n\nSo the sb after processing all characters would be '3' (from first step) + '7' (second step) + '3' (third step) \u2192 \"373\". Then, since f was set to true during processing, the next step is to reverse this string? Wait, no. Wait the code then does:\n\nsb2 is a StringBuffer of sb, then reverse it and parse as i. Wait, the code is:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is \"373\", then sb2 is a StringBuffer of that. Then reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\". So the next i would be 373. Wait, but that's not the next number. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me retrace. The current i is 357. The string s is \"357\". The processing:\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false. Since a is 7 (not 3 or 5), so append '3', and f remains false?\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nelse (if a is not 3 or 5) \u2192 append '3', but f is not set to true. So after this, f is still false.\n\nThen next character (5):\n\nNow j=1, the character is '5'. Since f is still false, check: it's 5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThen next character (3):\n\nj=2, character is '3'. Since f is now true, append the original '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, after the loop, since f was set to true (because in the second step, we set f to true), so the code does not append 3. Then, the sb is \"373\". Then, the code reverses it? Wait, no. The code does:\n\nsb2 is a StringBuffer of sb, then reverse it. So \"373\" reversed is still \"373\". So the next i is 373. \n\nWait, but the next number after 357 would be 357, then 373, then next step?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is generating numbers that have 3,5,7 digits in some way. The loop is counting how many numbers up to N have all three digits. But the way the next i is generated is a bit unclear. Maybe the code is generating all numbers that consist of 3,5,7 digits, and the loop is traversing them in some order. The initial i is 357, and each step generates the next number in the sequence. The loop continues until i exceeds N, counting how many of those numbers have all three digits present.\n\nWait, the code's c is incremented when the current i (the original number, not the new one) has all three digits. So the loop is processing each number in the sequence generated by this process, and for each, checks if it contains 3,5,7. The next i is generated by the process described. So the loop is going through all numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits, starting from 357, and counts how many of them up to N have all three digits present.\n\nSo the second program's task is to count numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits (each digit is 3,5, or7) that are between 357 and N, and contain at least one of each digit. The way the numbers are generated is by building them digit by digit in a way similar to counting, but only using 3,5,7 digits. The code's method of generating the next number is a bit like incrementing but with digits 3\u21925\u21927\u21923? Not sure, but the code's logic is a bit involved.\n\nNow, the problem is to translate both Java programs into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the minimum of a1 and a2, which is then used as input to the second program? Wait, no. Wait the original Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the two Java files, the first one's output is the minimum of a1 and a2. The second program's input is N, which is read via scanner. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the second program's N is the output of the first program.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number (the min(a1,a2)), and the second program reads an integer N. So the first program's output is the N for the second program. So the entire sequence is: input to first program is some string, first program outputs a number, which is the input to the second program, which then outputs the count.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input string (for the first program), process it through both steps, and output the final count from the second program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n2. Process it as per the first Java program to compute the min(a1,a2) \u2192 this is the N for the second step.\n3. Then, process that N through the second Java program's logic to compute the count.\n4. Output the count.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must combine both steps into one, without any intermediate I/O except for the initial input and final output.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first program takes a string x as input. Let's see how to process it in Fortran.\n\nThe steps for the first part:\n\n- Read the input string (x).\n- Process the string in two ways:\n   a) Left to right: for each position from 1 to length-1 (assuming 1-based?), check if current character is same as previous. If so, flip it (1\u21920, 0\u21921), count a1.\n   b) Right to left: process from the end, checking previous (i-1) and current (i). Wait, the second loop in Java is for i from x.length()-1 down to 1. For each i, check if b's char at i and i-1 are same. If so, flip the i-1 character (since moving backward, perhaps). The code in the second loop is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n        a2++;\n    }\n}\n\nSo in this loop, when two adjacent characters are the same, the left one (i-1) is flipped. So the processing is done from the end towards the start, flipping the left character when duplicates are found.\n\nThe result is the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's think of the steps.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Let's say the input is a single line, so in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: x\nread(*,'(A)') x\n\nBut in Fortran, handling variable-length strings can be done with allocatable character variables. Alternatively, since the input is a single string, perhaps read it as a fixed length, but better to use a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line into a character variable. Let's see.\n\nThen, process the first part:\n\nInitialize a1 and a2 to 0.\n\nFor the left-to-right processing (a):\n\nWe can create a copy of the string (a_str), then loop from 2 to len(x) (since indices start at 1 in Fortran). For each i from 2 to len(x):\n\nif a_str(i) == a_str(i-1), then flip it (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nWait, but in Java, the first loop starts at i=1 (Java uses 0-based indices?), but in the code, the loop is for (i=1; i < x.length(); i++). Wait, in Java, the string's indices are 0-based. So the first loop starts at i=1 (second character), and compares to i-1 (the previous character). So in Fortran, which is 1-based, the loop would be from 2 to len(x).\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nJava's x.length() is the length. The first loop runs from i=1 to x.length()-1 (since i < x.length()).\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be i from 2 to len(x).\n\nSo for the first loop (a processing):\n\nallocate a_str(len(x)), and set it to x.\n\nThen:\n\ndo i = 2, len(x)\n    if (a_str(i) == a_str(i-1)) then\n        if (a_str(i) == '1') then\n            a_str(i) = '0'\n        else\n            a_str(i) = '1'\n        end if\n        a1 = a1 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the second loop (processing b):\n\nWe need to process from the end towards the start. The loop in Java is for i from x.length()-1 downto 1 (since i starts at x.length()-1 and goes down to 1, since i>0).\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from len(x)-1 down to 1 (since in Java, the indices are 0-based, so x.length()-1 is the last index, but in Fortran, the last index is len(x)).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--). So in Fortran, the equivalent indices would be from len(x) down to 2 (since in Fortran, the indices start at 1). Wait, let's see:\n\nJava's i runs from (x.length()-1) down to 1 (since i>0). So in Fortran, the equivalent indices would be from len(x) down to 2 (since in Fortran, the first character is 1, last is len(x)). So the loop would be:\n\ndo i = len(x), 2, -1\n\nThen, check if b_str(i) == b_str(i-1). If so, flip the (i-1)th character.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when they find that the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are the same, they flip the (i-1)th character. So in Fortran:\n\nif (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n    if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n        b_str(i-1) = '0'\n    else\n        b_str(i-1) = '1'\n    end if\n    a2 = a2 +1\nend if\n\nSo that's the second loop.\n\nOnce both loops are done, the minimum of a1 and a2 is computed, which is the N for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part (the second Java program):\n\nThe second program takes N as input (which is the output of the first program). The second program counts numbers from 357 up to N that contain at least one 3,5,7 each. Wait, no, the code in the second program's loop is a bit more involved. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe second program's main loop:\n\nint N = gi(); // which is the input from first program's output.\n\nlong i = 357;\nint c =0;\nwhile (i <= N) {\n    if (s contains 3,5,7 \u2192 then c++)\n    then generate next i via the string processing.\n}\n\nWait, the code inside the loop first checks if the current i (as a string) has all three digits. If so, increment c. Then, generate the next i via the string processing.\n\nThe next i is generated by processing the current i's digits in a certain way. The code's process for generating the next i is as follows:\n\nTake the current i as a string s.\n\nProcess each character in reverse order (from last to first), building a new string.\n\nThe processing is:\n\n- Initialize a flag f as false.\n\n- For each character in reverse order (starting from the last character):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the current character is '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n      else (it's '7' or other?), replace with '3', and leave f as false?\n\nWait, no. Let me look again:\n\nThe code for the loop over the characters:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n    char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n    if (f) {\n        sb.append(a);\n    } else {\n        if (a == '3') {\n            sb.append('5');\n            f = true;\n        } else if (a == '5') {\n            sb.append('7');\n            f = true;\n        } else {\n            sb.append('3');\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo for each character in reverse order (starting from the end of the string):\n\nIf f is false, then decide what to append based on the current character:\n\n- if it's '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n- if it's '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n- else (it's '7' or something else?), append '3', and leave f as false.\n\nWait, in the else clause (when a is not 3 or 5), then append '3', and f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false (meaning none of the characters were 3 or 5?), then append a '3' to the string.\n\nThen, reverse the string and parse as the next i.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the initial i = 357 \u2192 s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character in reverse (7,5,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false. Since a is 7 (not 3 or5), so append '3', and f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\nj=1, the character is 5 (since s.length() -1 -1 = 1 \u2192 s[1] is '5').\n\nSince f is still false (from previous step), check a=5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nj=2, the character is '3'. Since f is now true, append the original '3'.\n\nSo the sb after processing is '3' (from first step) + '7' (second step) + '3' (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true (because in the second step), we don't append anything else. Then reverse the string: \"373\" reversed is still \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nNext iteration, i is 373. Check if it contains 3,5,7? 373 has 3 and 7 but no 5 \u2192 so not counted. So c remains same.\n\nThen generate next i:\n\ns is \"373\".\n\nProcessing in reverse (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false. a is '3' \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nsince f is true, append '7'.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nsince f is true, append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\". Reversed \u2192 \"375\"? Wait, no. Wait the sb is built as follows:\n\nWait the first character in reverse is the last character of s, which is '3' (since s is \"373\", the last character is third character '3'). So first step (j=0):\n\na is s[2] (since s.length() is 3, so s.length()-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 third character '3').\n\nSo first step: a is '3', so append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond step (j=1): the character is s[1] (second character '7'). Since f is true, append '7'.\n\nThird step (j=2): the character is s[0] (first character '3'). Since f is true, append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\". Then reverse it \u2192 \"375\". So next i is 375.\n\nCheck if 375 has all three digits: 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So c increments by 1.\n\nThen generate next i from 375.\n\nThis process continues until i exceeds N.\n\nThe key is that the next i is generated by this digit manipulation, which effectively builds numbers with digits 3,5,7 in a way similar to counting, but only using those digits. The loop is generating all numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits in increasing order, starting from 357, and counts how many of them up to N have all three digits present.\n\nSo the second part's logic is to generate all numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits, starting from 357, and count those \u2264 N that contain all three digits.\n\nThe Fortran code must implement this.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (the input to the first Java program).\n\n2. Process it to compute N = min(a1, a2).\n\n3. Then, compute the count of numbers from 357 up to N (inclusive) that are made of 3,5,7 digits and contain all three.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's loop starts with i=357 and proceeds until i exceeds N. Each step's i is generated by the digit processing, so the numbers are generated in a specific order. The count is how many of those generated numbers (up to N) have all three digits.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must:\n\n- Start with i = 357.\n\n- Initialize count c=0.\n\n- While i <= N:\n\n   - Check if the string representation of i contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   - Generate the next i using the digit processing method.\n\n- Finally, output c.\n\nThe challenge is to implement the digit processing to generate the next i correctly.\n\nFirst, the first part (computing N):\n\nRead the input string, process it as per the first Java program.\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nImplement the loop for generating i and counting.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead the input string:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: input_str\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nThen, process the first part:\n\ninteger :: a1 = 0, a2 = 0\ncharacter(len=len(input_str)) :: a_str, b_str\na_str = input_str\nb_str = input_str\n\n! Process a_str (left to right)\ndo i = 2, len(a_str)\n    if (a_str(i) == a_str(i-1)) then\n        if (a_str(i) == '1') then\n            a_str(i) = '0'\n        else\n            a_str(i) = '1'\n        end if\n        a1 = a1 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\n! Process b_str (right to left)\ndo i = len(b_str), 2, -1\n    if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n        if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n            b_str(i-1) = '0'\n        else\n            b_str(i-1) = '1'\n        end if\n        a2 = a2 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\ninteger :: N = min(a1, a2)\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nWe need to generate the numbers starting from 357, and process each to see if they have all three digits, then count.\n\nThe key is to generate the next i correctly. Let's think of how to implement the digit processing.\n\nThe next i is generated by:\n\n1. Convert current i to a string s.\n\n2. Process the characters in reverse order, building a new string as per the rules.\n\n3. Reverse the new string and parse as the next i.\n\nThe processing steps for the string s:\n\nInitialize a flag f = .false.\n\nCreate a new string (sb) by processing each character in reverse order (from last to first):\n\nfor each character in reverse order (starting from the end of s):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if current_char is '3' \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if current_char is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\n      else (current_char is '7' or other?) \u2192 append '3', leave f as false.\n\n   else:\n\n      append current_char.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false \u2192 append '3' to the string.\n\nThen reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after building the sb, they reverse it again? Let me recheck:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the characters in reverse order (from the end of s to the start). The code then creates a StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb), then reverse it, and parse as the next i.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is built by processing the reversed order, but then reversed again?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe original s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the characters in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 since f is false, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 f is false \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 f is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the code does:\n\nsb2 = new StringBuffer(sb) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nSo the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's next i is the reversed string of the sb? Or the sb is already in the correct order?\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the reversed order of the original string. The code then reverses the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the next number by incrementing in a way similar to counting, but with digits 3\u21925\u21927\u21923?\n\nAlternatively, the code's process is to generate the next number by incrementing the rightmost possible digit, but in the sequence 3\u21925\u21927\u21923?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's process is similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7. Let me think of the example:\n\nStarting at 357:\n\nNext is 373 (as above). Then 375 (from 373 \u2192 processing gives 375?), then 377? Not sure. But the code's process is a bit involved.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must replicate the digit processing exactly as per the Java code.\n\nTo implement this in Fortran:\n\nWe need a function to generate the next i from the current i.\n\nFunction next_i(current_i) result(next_i_val)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: current_i\n   integer :: next_i_val\n   character(len=20) :: s, new_s\n   integer :: len_s, i_char, j, f\n   character(len=1) :: c\n\n   write(s, '(I0)') current_i\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n   new_s = ''\n   f = 0  ! 0 means false, 1 means true\n   do j = 1, len_s\n       ! process the j-th character from the end of s (i.e., s(len_s - j +1))\n       i_char = len_s - j +1\n       c = s(i_char:i_char)\n       if (f == 0) then\n           if (c == '3') then\n               new_s = trim(new_s) // '5'\n               f = 1\n           else if (c == '5') then\n               new_s = trim(new_s) // '7'\n               f = 1\n           else  ! c is '7' or other (but should only be 3,5,7)\n               new_s = trim(new_s) // '3'\n           end if\n       else\n           new_s = trim(new_s) // c\n       end if\n   end do\n\n   ! After processing all characters, check if f is still 0 (false)\n   if (f == 0) then\n       new_s = trim(new_s) // '3'\n   end if\n\n   ! Now reverse the new_s to get the next number\n   character(len=len_trim(new_s)) :: reversed_s\n   reversed_s = ''\n   do i = len_trim(new_s), 1, -1\n       reversed_s = reversed_s // new_s(i:i)\n   end do\n\n   read(reversed_s, *) next_i_val\nend function next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string handling can be a bit tricky. Let me think of the steps again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using arrays to handle the characters.\n\nAlternatively, here's a step-by-step plan for the function:\n\nGiven current_i, convert to a string s.\n\nProcess each character in reverse order (from last to first character of s):\n\nInitialize new_s as empty, f as false (0).\n\nLoop over each position in reverse (from last to first):\n\n   current_char = s's character at position (len_s - j +1) where j is from 1 to len_s.\n\nWait, for j from 1 to len_s:\n\n   the position is (len_s - j +1). For j=1, it's the last character, j=2, second last, etc.\n\nFor each such character:\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if current_char is '3', append '5' to new_s, set f to true.\n\n      else if current_char is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n      else (current_char is '7' or other?), append '3', leave f as false.\n\n   else:\n\n      append current_char to new_s.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false \u2192 append '3' to new_s.\n\nThen, reverse the new_s string to get the next number.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after building the new_s (the sb), they reverse it again. Wait, the code in Java does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is built by processing the reversed order of the original string. The code then reverses the sb to get the next i.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe original s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the characters in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe new_s (sb) is built as \"3\" (from 7), then \"7\" (from 5), then \"3\" (from 3, since f is now true). So the new_s is \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing this gives \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code reverses the sb, which was already built in a way that the first character of the new_s corresponds to the first character of the reversed processing. So the reversal is necessary to get the correct number.\n\nWait, perhaps the new_s is built in the order of the reversed processing, so to get the correct number, you have to reverse it again.\n\nYes, because the processing builds the new_s in the order of the reversed digits, so reversing it gives the correct number.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after building new_s as per the processing, we need to reverse it to get the next i.\n\nThus, the function next_i would:\n\nTake current_i, convert to string s.\n\nProcess each character in reverse order of s, building new_s as per the rules.\n\nThen reverse new_s to get the next number.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nBut in Fortran, string manipulation can be done with character arrays.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nFunction next_i(current_i) result(next_val)\n   integer, intent(in) :: current_i\n   integer :: next_val\n   character(len=20) :: s, temp_str, new_str\n   integer :: len_s, i, f = 0, j\n   s = trim(adjustl(transfer(current_i, s)))  ! Not sure, better to use write statement.\n\n   write(s, '(I0)') current_i\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n   temp_str = ''\n   f = 0\n\n   do j = 1, len_s\n       i = len_s - j +1\n       character(len=1) :: c = s(i:i)\n       if (f == 0) then\n           if (c == '3') then\n               temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '5'\n               f = 1\n           else if (c == '5') then\n               temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '7'\n               f = 1\n           else\n               temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '3'\n           end if\n       else\n           temp_str = trim(temp_str) // c\n       end if\n   end do\n\n   if (f == 0) then\n       temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '3'\n   end if\n\n   ! Now reverse temp_str to get new_str\n   new_str = ''\n   do i = len_trim(temp_str), 1, -1\n       new_str = new_str // temp_str(i:i)\n   end do\n\n   read(new_str, *) next_val\nend function next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the '//' operator for strings can be used, but need to ensure that the strings are properly handled. Also, the function must return an integer.\n\nNow, the main loop for the second part:\n\ninteger :: N = ... (from first part)\ninteger :: current_i = 357\ninteger :: count =0\n\ndo while (current_i <= N)\n    !

Since in Fortran, character arrays are initialized with spaces, but the input_str is read as a string. So when we set a_str = input_str, it should copy the characters correctly.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part's loops, the indices are correct. For example, in the left-to-right loop, starting at i=2 (since Fortran is 1-based), and comparing to i-1.\n\nTesting the code for possible issues:\n\n- The next_i function must correctly handle leading zeros? Probably not, since the numbers are generated from 357 upwards, so the temp_str after processing and reversing should not have leading zeros. But the code uses 'read(new_str, *) next_i', which should ignore leading spaces but not leading zeros. Wait, but the temp_str is built from digits 3,5,7, so the reversed string should not have leading zeros. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the temp_str is empty? Probably not, since the initial current_i is 357, and the processing should generate valid numbers.\n\nAnother test case: when current_i is 357:\n\nProcessing in next_i:\n\ns is '357', len_s=3.\n\nLoop j from 1 to 3:\n\nj=1 \u2192 i = 3 (3rd character '7'):\n\nf is 0 \u2192 c is '7', so append '3', f remains 0.\n\nj=2 \u2192 i=2 (second character '5'):\n\nf is 0 \u2192 c is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f to 1.\n\nj=3 \u2192 i=1 (first character '3'):\n\nf is 1 \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo temp_str is '3' (from j=1) + '7' (j=2) + '3' (j=3) \u2192 '373'.\n\nThen, since f was set to 1, no need to append '3'.\n\nReverse temp_str '373' \u2192 '373', so next_i is 373. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: current_i = 373:\n\ns is '373', len_s=3.\n\nj=1 \u2192 i=3 (third character '3'):\n\nf is 0 \u2192 c is '3' \u2192 append '5', set f=1.\n\nj=2 \u2192 i=2 (second character '7'):\n\nf is 1 \u2192 append '7'.\n\nj=3 \u2192 i=1 (first character '3'):\n\nf is 1 \u2192 append '3'.\n\ntemp_str is '5' + '7' + '3' \u2192 '573'.\n\nReverse \u2192 '375', so next_i is 375. Which is correct.\n\nThen, checking 375:\n\ncontains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes \u2192 count increases by 1.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program combines all these steps."
