    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_632_B). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers, followed by a string s. It calculates a sum of elements in the array where the corresponding character in s is 'B'. Then it does some more calculations with 'A's and 'B's to find the maximum value of a certain sum, and outputs that maximum. \n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_678_B) reads an integer y, checks if it's a leap year, then loops through years starting from y+1, accumulating days until the total modulo 7 is zero and the leap year status matches the original. It then outputs the first such year.\n\nThe key here is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. But since we need to combine them into a single Fortran program, the first part's output must be used as the input to the second part's logic without any I/O in between. So the first part's result (the 'ans' variable) is the input y for the second part.\n\nSo the Fortran program will read the input for the first part, process it to get the answer, then use that answer as the input y for the second part's processing, and finally output the result of the second part.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n, array a, string s from input.\n2. Compute the first part's answer (ans) as per the first Java code.\n3. Use this ans as the y input for the second part.\n4. Compute the second part's result using that y.\n5. Output the second part's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based. Need to adjust indices. Let's see:\n\nJava code for first part:\n\n- Reads n, then n integers into array a (0-based).\n- Then reads a string s.\n- Sum is initialized to 0, then for each character in s (0-based), if it's 'B', add a[i] to sum.\n- Then ans is sum, and sum1 is sum. Then two loops: first forward, then backward.\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nThe first loop for the 'A's and 'B's:\n\nThe first loop is for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n    ans = max(ans, sum1);\n}\n\nWait, no, the code after the initial sum is:\n\nsum1 is initialized to sum (the initial B sum). Then, for each character in s, if it's 'A', add a[i], else subtract a[i], and track the maximum.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nsum is the sum of a[i] where s[i] is 'B'.\n\nThen, sum1 is set to sum. Then, in the first loop (forward):\n\nfor each i from 0 to s.length-1:\n\nif s[i] is 'A', add a[i] to sum1, else subtract a[i]. Then compare to ans.\n\nWait, but the loop is over the entire string again. So the first part's logic is:\n\nThe initial sum is the sum of a[i] where s[i] is 'B'.\n\nThen, the first loop (forward) starts with sum1 = sum, and for each character in s, if it's 'A', add a[i], else subtract a[i], and track the maximum.\n\nWait, but the code is:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nfor i from 0 to s.length-1:\n\n   if s[i] is 'A', sum1 += a[i]\n\n   else (it's 'B'), sum1 -= a[i]\n\n   ans = max(ans, sum1)\n\nWait, but the original code's first loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i]; \n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but the 'B' case here subtracts a[i], but in the initial sum, B's were added. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me recheck the code.\n\nWait the first part's code:\n\nThe initial sum is the sum of a[i] where s[i] is 'B'. So sum is sum of B's a[i].\n\nThen, in the first loop (the first for loop after sum is computed):\n\nsum1 is initialized to sum. Then, for each character in s (from 0 to length-1):\n\nif the character is 'A', add a[i] to sum1, else subtract a[i].\n\nWait, so for 'B's, it subtracts a[i], which is the opposite of the initial sum. That's because the initial sum was adding B's, but here, when processing 'B's, it subtracts. So this is a different calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is considering a different scenario where each 'A' adds and 'B' subtracts, but starting from the initial sum. Not sure, but the code is as written. So in Fortran, need to replicate that.\n\nNow, for the second part of the first loop (the backward loop):\n\nsum1 is reset to sum again, then loop from the end backwards, doing the same: for each character, if 'A' add a[i], else subtract, and track the maximum.\n\nSo the first part's code is calculating the maximum between the initial sum, and the sum1 after each step in the forward and backward passes.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- n is an integer, read from input.\n\n- a is an array of integers of size n.\n\n- s is a string (character array) of length len_s (which is the length of the input string).\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be read as a character array. Let's see.\n\nThe first part's steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into array a (but note that Fortran arrays are 1-based, so need to adjust indices).\n\nThen read the string s. The length of s is len_s = len_trim(s). \n\nThen compute sum:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the array a is 0-based, so in the Java code, a[i] corresponds to the i-th element (starting at 0). In Fortran, the array a would be 1-based, so when reading the a array, the first element is a(1), which corresponds to the first input number. So the indices in the string s (which is 1-based in Fortran) would correspond to the same as Java's 0-based indices. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIn Java, for the first element of a (a[0]), it's the first number after n. The string s's first character (s.charAt(0)) is the first character after the array. So in Fortran, the string s is read as a character array of length len_s, with s(1) being the first character. So the indices in the loop for the string would be from 1 to len_s, and the a array is 1-based. So the code can be written as:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, sum1 is initialized to sum. Then the first loop (forward):\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nans = sum\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n      ans = sum1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, reset sum1 to sum again, and loop backward:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = len_s, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n      ans = sum1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the backward loop is from s.length()-1 down to 0. In Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the loop would go from len_s down to 1.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part of the Java code (codeforces_678_B) takes an integer y (which is the ans from the first part) and processes it.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\nReads y, then checks if it's a leap year. Then loops from y+1 upwards, accumulating days until the total mod 7 is 0, and the leap year status of the current year matches the original y's leap status. Then output that year.\n\nWait, the code in Java for the second part:\n\nThe loop is infinite, starting at i = y+1, and for each i:\n\nsum += 366 if leap, else 365.\n\nThen, if sum mod 7 ==0, check if the current year's leap status is same as original y's leap status. If so, output and return.\n\nWait, the original code's condition is:\n\nif (sum %7 ==0) {\n\n   if ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ) {\n\n      print and return.\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is whether the current year's leap status is same as the original y's leap status. Because (check_leap(i) == leap) is equivalent to ( (check_leap(i) and leap) or (not check_leap(i) and not leap) )\n\nSo the condition is: if the current year's leap status is same as original y's, then it's okay.\n\nSo in code, the condition is (check_leap(i) == leap).\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's code would be:\n\nFirst, compute leap for the original y (the ans from first part).\n\nleap = check_leap(y)\n\nThen, starting from i = y+1, loop:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = y+1, ... (infinite loop until found)\n\n   if (check_leap(i)) then\n\n      days = 366\n\n   else\n\n      days = 365\n\n   end if\n\n   sum = sum + days\n\n   if (mod(sum,7) ==0) then\n\n      if ( check_leap(i) == leap ) then\n\n          print *, i\n\n          exit the loop and program\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is infinite until it finds the correct i. So in Fortran, we can use a do loop with a condition, or a loop that breaks when found.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps a do loop with a label and goto, but better to use a do loop with a condition.\n\nAlternatively, a do loop that runs indefinitely until the condition is met, then exits.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can have a do loop with an exit statement.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = y+1, huge_number\n\n   if (check_leap(i)) then\n\n      days = 366\n\n   else\n\n      days = 365\n\n   end if\n\n   sum = sum + days\n\n   if (mod(sum,7) ==0) then\n\n      if ( check_leap(i) == leap ) then\n\n          print *, i\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since the loop could be infinite, but in practice, it will find a solution eventually. So in Fortran, this should work.\n\nNow, the check_leap function:\n\nIn Java, it's a static method returning true if y is divisible by 400, or divisible by 4 but not 100.\n\nIn Fortran, a function:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: y\n\n   if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else if (mod(y,100) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   else if (mod(y,4) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nWait, the Java code's check_leap is:\n\nreturn y%400 ==0 || (y%4 ==0 && y%100 !=0);\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncheck_leap is true if (y mod 400 ==0) or ( (y mod4 ==0) and (y mod100 /=0) )\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n\n   integer :: y\n\n   if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else if (mod(y,100) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   else if (mod(y,4) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read n, then n integers into array a (1-based).\n\n2. Read the string s (as a character array, with length len_s).\n\n3. Compute the first part's ans as per the first Java code.\n\n4. Use ans as the y for the second part.\n\n5. Compute the second part's result and output it.\n\nNow, handling the input for the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, reading the input:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n integers into array a.\n\nThen read the string s. Since in Fortran, reading a string with list-directed input will read until a space or end of line. But the problem says that the first program's input is read via Scanner, which for next() would read the next token. So the string s is the next token after the array.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, after reading the array, the next line is sc.next() which reads the next token (the string s). So the input for the first part is:\n\nn followed by n integers, then the string s (as a single token, possibly with spaces? No, because next() reads until whitespace. Wait, but in the problem's context, the string s is probably a single token without spaces. So in Fortran, to read the string, after reading n and the array, we can read the next line as a string, but perhaps using a read statement with a format.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a character array with a sufficient length. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the string s, perhaps:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut the 'A' format reads the entire line as a string. However, the string s in the Java code is read via sc.next(), which would read the next token (so it's possible that the string is on the same line as the array, but after the array's numbers. So perhaps the input for the first part is structured as:\n\nFirst line: n followed by n integers (all on the same line).\n\nSecond line: the string s.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be on the same line as the array, but after the numbers. For example, if the input is like:\n\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\nABBCD\n\nThen the first line has n=5 and the array, then the second line is the string.\n\nBut in the Java code, after reading the array, the next token is sc.next(), which would read the next token, which could be on the same line or next line. To handle this in Fortran, perhaps the best way is to read the string as a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line after the array, but in Fortran, perhaps using a read statement with a format that reads the rest of the line as the string.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a character array of sufficient length. Let's assume that the string is read as a single line. So in code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nThen, the length of s is len_trim(s).\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nWe need to have the first part's variables (n, a, s, sum, ans) and then the second part's variables (y, leap, sum_days, etc.)\n\nBut in Fortran, variables can be declared in the main program.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, len_s, ans, y\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nlogical :: leap\n\n! First part:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\n! Compute sum for first part:\n\ninteger :: sum, sum1\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nans = sum\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = len_s, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\n! Now, second part:\n\ny = ans\n\nleap = check_leap(y)\n\ninteger :: current_year, days, total_days\n\ntotal_days = 0\n\ndo current_year = y +1, huge(current_year)\n\n   if (check_leap(current_year)) then\n\n      days = 366\n\n   else\n\n      days = 365\n\n   end if\n\n   total_days = total_days + days\n\n   if (mod(total_days,7) ==0) then\n\n      if (check_leap(current_year) .eqv. leap) then\n\n         print *, current_year\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ncontains\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: y\n\n   if (mod(y,400) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else if (mod(y,100) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   else if (mod(y,4) ==0) then\n\n      check_leap = .true.\n\n   else\n\n      check_leap = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop, the initial total_days is 0. Let me check the Java code's second part:\n\nIn Java, the sum starts at 0, and for each i starting from y+1, adds 365 or 366, then checks if sum mod7 is 0.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, total_days starts at 0, and for each current_year (starting at y+1), adds days (365/6) to total_days, then check mod.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = y +1; ; i++) {\n\n   if (leap(i)) sum +=366 else 365\n\n   if (sum mod7 ==0) {\n\n      if (leap(i) == leap(y)) then print and return.\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo the code in Fortran is correct.\n\nNow, the loop in Fortran is an infinite loop until exit. The 'do current_year = y+1, huge(...)' is a way to make it loop indefinitely, but in practice, the exit statement will break it.\n\nAlternatively, use a do-while loop with a label and goto, but the above approach should work.\n\nNow, testing for possible issues:\n\n- The first part's array a is 1-based, which matches the Java's 0-based indices? Wait, in Java, the array a is 0-based, so for i from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so when the Java code uses a[i], in Fortran it's a(i+1) if the indices were same. Wait, no, no. Wait, in the Java code, the first element of a is a[0], which is read as the first integer after n. In Fortran, the first element is a(1), so when reading the array, the first number after n is stored in a(1). So the indices in the loops for the string and array are correctly aligned. Because in the Java code, for i from 0 to s.length-1, the a[i] is the i-th element (starting at 0). In Fortran, the loop is from 1 to len_s, and a(i) is the i-th element (starting at 1). So the indices are offset by 1, but since the Java's a[0] corresponds to Fortran's a(1), the code is correct.\n\nWait, no, that's a problem. Wait, in the Java code, the array a is filled with the next n integers. The first element a[0] is the first number after n. In Fortran, the array a is 1-based, so a(1) is the first number. So when the Java code uses a[i], where i is from 0 to n-1, in Fortran, the equivalent is a(i+1). But in the loops for the string and array, the indices are the same as the Java code's indices. Wait, the string s in Java is 0-based, so s.charAt(i) for i from 0 to len-1. In Fortran, the string is 1-based, so s(i:i) for i from 1 to len_s. So the indices in the loops are shifted by 1. That would be a problem.\n\nWait, this is a critical error. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first part's code:\n\nJava:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n   char ch = s.charAt(i);\n\n   if (ch == 'B') sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is from 1 to len_s (since s is 1-based). So for each i from 1 to len_s:\n\nif s(i:i) is 'B', add a(i). But in Java, a[i] is the (i)th element (0-based), so in Fortran, the a array is 1-based, so a(i) corresponds to Java's a[i-1]. Wait, no. Wait, the Java code's a array is filled with the next n integers after n. So the first element in the input after n is a[0], which in Fortran is stored in a(1). So when the Java code uses a[i], it's the (i)th element (0-based), which in Fortran is a(i+1). \n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in the loops over the string and array, the indices are not aligned. For example, in Java, for i=0 (the first character of s), the a[i] is a[0], which is the first element of the array. In Fortran, the first element is a(1). So in the loop over the string's characters (1-based), the a array's index should be the same as the string's index. So in Fortran, the code is correct because the first element of a is a(1), which corresponds to the first element in the input (Java's a[0]). So when the string's first character (i=1 in Fortran) is processed, it uses a(1), which is correct. So the indices are correctly aligned. Because the Java's a[0] is the first element, which is stored in a(1) in Fortran. So the loops in Fortran are correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: the second part's loop may take a long time for large y. But since the problem requires the same behavior, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code should be correct. Let me check the variables:\n\nIn the first part, after computing ans, we set y = ans. Then proceed with the second part.\n\nThe check_leap function is correctly implemented.\n\nThe loop in the second part starts at y+1, and for each current_year, adds days, then checks mod 7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
