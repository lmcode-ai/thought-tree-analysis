    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC172_D. It reads an integer n from input, then calculates some formula involving a loop. The loop runs from 1 to n, and for each i, it adds (i * (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2) to the answer. The final answer is printed. So this is a mathematical computation based on n.\n\nThe second Java file is atcoder_ABC151_A. It reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but there's also a RemRing class here. Wait, but in the main method of the second file, they only use the first character's next character. The RemRing class might be part of another problem, but in the given code, the second program's main method doesn't use RemRing. Wait, looking again: the second program's main is in atcoder_ABC151_A, which just takes the first character of the input string and outputs the next character. The RemRing class is part of the same file but not used here. So maybe that's a mistake, but according to the problem statement, the user provided these two Java programs as the sequence. Wait, but the second program's code is supposed to take the output of the first and process it. But the first program outputs a number, and the second expects a string input. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (the ans variable). The second program expects a string input (since it reads a line and takes the first character). So how does the first program's output become the input for the second? The first program outputs a number, which would be a string when passed to the next program. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program would read that as the string \"123\", take the first character '1', add 1 to get '2', and output that. So the overall sequence would take an input n, compute the first program's answer, then take that number as a string, take its first character, increment it, and output that character.\n\nWait, but the second program's code in the given Java is in atcoder_ABC151_A's main. Let me check the code again. The second program's main does:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo, the input to the second program is a line (the output of the first program, which is a number printed as a string). So for example, if the first program outputs \"456\", then the second program reads \"456\", takes the first character '4', adds 1 to get '5', and outputs '5'.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's behavior is: take an integer n, compute the first program's answer (the ans variable), then convert that answer to a string, take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nNow, the task is to translate this entire sequence into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's input is read via Fortran's input (probably from stdin).\n- The first program's computation is done, then the result is passed to the second program's computation without I/O in between.\n- The second program's computation takes the first character of the string representation of the first's output, increments it, and outputs that.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the integer n from input.\n2. Compute the ans as per the first Java program's loop.\n3. Convert ans to a string.\n4. Take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII code (i.e., increment the character), then output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to handle converting the number to a string? We can use internal write or the intrinsic function to convert to string. For example, using write(*,*) ans would output it, but here we need to get the string representation.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, to get the string, perhaps using the 'adjustl' function or using an internal write. Let me think.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nFirst, read n from input. Then compute ans as per the first Java code's loop. Then, convert ans to a string. Then, take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value (using ichar and char functions), then print that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are handled with ichar and char. For example, if the string is s, then the first character is s(1:1), its ASCII code is ichar(s(1:1)), add 1, then convert back to char.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute ans via the loop.\n\nConvert ans to a string, say s.\n\nTake first character of s, increment its ASCII value by 1, then output that character.\n\nNow, the loop in the first Java program:\n\nThe loop is for i from 1 to n (inclusive). For each i, compute term = i * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2, then sum all terms.\n\nWait, in Java, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, we can use integer division with / operator (since variables are integers). But in Fortran, variables need to be declared properly.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, n is an int, but ans is a long. So in Fortran, we need to use integers of sufficient size. Since Java's long is 64 bits, in Fortran, we can use integer(8) (assuming 64-bit integers are available).\n\nSo variables:\n\nn is integer (since it's read as an int in Java).\n\nans is integer(8).\n\nThe loop variable i is integer.\n\nThe term for each i is (i) * (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) / 2. Since in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we have to ensure that the division is integer division.\n\nWait, in Java, (long) n / (long) i is equivalent to converting to long first, then dividing. In Fortran, if n and i are integers, then n/i would be integer division. So as long as n and i are integers, the division is integer division.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nInitialize ans as 0_8 (8-byte integer).\n\nLoop i from 1 to n:\n\nterm = i * (n / i) * ( (n/i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nans = ans + term\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations and integer division must be correct. Let me check:\n\nThe term is i multiplied by (n divided by i) multiplied by ( (n divided by i) +1 ), divided by 2.\n\nYes. So in code:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    temp = n / i\n\n    term = i * temp * (temp + 1) / 2\n\n    ans = ans + term\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nOnce ans is computed, we need to convert it to a string. How to do that in Fortran?\n\nWe can use an internal write statement. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces\n\nThen, the first character is s(1:1). But need to make sure that the string is properly formatted. Alternatively, using trim(adjustl(...)) but perhaps just writing to the string and then taking the first character.\n\nOnce we have the first character, we can get its ASCII code with ichar, add 1, then convert back to a character with char.\n\nThen, print that character.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n\n  integer(8) :: ans, i, temp, term\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  ans = 0_8\n\n  do i = 1, n\n      temp = n / i\n      term = i * temp * (temp + 1) / 2\n      ans = ans + term\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert ans to string\n  character(len=20) :: s\n  write(s, '(i0)') ans\n  s = adjustl(s)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\n  ! Get first character, increment, output\n  if (len_trim(s) >= 1) then\n      character :: c = s(1:1)\n      integer :: c_code = ichar(c)\n      c_code = c_code + 1\n      write(*, '(a)') char(c_code)\n  else\n      ! Edge case if ans is 0? But n is at least 1, so ans can't be 0.\n      ! Since n is read as input, but the first program's code would have n >=1?\n      ! Well, the problem may require handling n=0, but according to the first Java code, n is read as an int, but the loop runs from 1 to n. If n is 0, the loop doesn't run, ans remains 0. Then the string would be \"0\", so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n      ! So even if s is empty (unlikely here), but in our case, since n is read, but perhaps the user can input 0. So better to handle it.\n      ! But for the problem's purpose, perhaps the input is valid as per the original Java code.\n      ! So proceed with the first character.\n  end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing to a character variable with a format, the write statement may pad with spaces. Using adjustl(s) shifts the string to the left, removing leading spaces. So after that, s(1:1) is the first non-space character, which is the first digit.\n\nWait, but the 'i0' format writes the integer without leading spaces, but perhaps the write statement may have some issues. Let me think: the 'i0' format writes the integer in the smallest possible field, so the resulting string in s would have the number with no leading spaces, but the rest of the characters in the 20-length array would be spaces. So adjustl(s) would move the digits to the left, so the first character is the first digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjustl is unnecessary because the write statement with '(i0)' would not leave leading spaces. Let me test in mind:\n\nSuppose ans is 123. Then writing to s(20) with '(i0)' would put '123' starting at the first position, followed by 17 spaces. So s(1:1) is '1', so adjustl is not needed. Wait, no, the write statement with '(i0)' would write the number as \"123\" into the character variable, but the rest of the characters are spaces. So s would be \"123               \" (with 17 spaces). So adjustl(s) would make it \"123               \" (same?), no, adjustl moves the string to the left, so leading blanks are removed. Wait, adjustl(s) would take the string and shift all non-blank characters to the left, so the first non-blank is at the first position, and the rest are filled with blanks. So in this case, since the first character is already non-blank, adjustl(s) would leave it as is. So perhaps adjustl is redundant here, but it's safe to include.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trim(adjustl(s)) but trim removes trailing spaces. Hmm, perhaps not needed. The first character is the first digit regardless.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but what if the ans is a negative number? But in the first Java code, ans starts at 0 and adds terms which are all positive (since i and (n/i) are positive when n is positive). So if n is positive, ans is positive. If n is zero, then the loop doesn't run, ans remains 0. So the string would be \"0\", so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check for possible overflows. The first Java code uses long, which is 64 bits. In Fortran, using integer(8) should be okay as long as the system supports 64-bit integers. The loop for n up to, say, 1e9 would have a problem with the loop count, but the problem's constraints may not require that. But the code as per the problem's instruction is to translate the given Java code, so we proceed.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program should be as written above."
