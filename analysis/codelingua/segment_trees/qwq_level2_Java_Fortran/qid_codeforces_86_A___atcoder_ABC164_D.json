So for each i, temp is the same as in the first loop. So the second loop is going through the same values as the first, but starting from 0 again. Wait, in the first loop, the temp starts at 0, then for each i:\n\ni=0: temp = 0*10 +9 =9 \u2192 maxxes[0] = 9/2*(9-9/2) \u2192 4*(5) =20. i=1: temp=9*10+9=99 \u2192 maxxes[1] = 49 *50 = 2450.

Wait, but in the Java code, the mult function does:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < pow; ++j) { max = max *10 +9; }\n\nWhich starts with max=0, then after first iteration, 9, then 99, etc. So after pow steps, it's 999...9 (pow digits). So the max is exactly temp_values(pow-1). Therefore, in Fortran, the mult function can be written as:\n\nfunction mult(a) result(res)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger(8) :: res, pow, max_val\n\npow = power(a) if (pow ==0) then \n\n   max_val =0 \n\nelse \n\n   max_val = temp_values(pow-1)\n\nend if \n\nres = a * (max_val - a)\n\nend function \n\nWait, but what if a is 0? Then pow would be 0 (since in power function, a starts at 0, and the loop runs while a>0. So if a is 0, the loop doesn't run, so res is 0. So pow would be 0. But in that case, the max_val would be 0 (since temp_values is for 1 to 10 digits). So the code would handle that. Now, the power function:\n\nfunction power(a) result(res)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: res\n\nres =0 \n\ninteger(8) :: temp = a \n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   res = res +1 \n\n   temp = temp /10 end do \n\nend function Okay.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a result. The second takes that output as input and processes it further, then outputs the final result. But in Fortran, I have to combine them so that the first part's output is passed to the second part internally without any I/O in between. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does. \n\nStarting with the first Java file (codeforces_86_A):\n\nThe main method reads two longs, l and r. Then it calculates some maximum value based on those numbers. The functions power and mult are used here. The power function counts the number of digits in a number. The mult function calculates a value based on the number and the maximum number with the same number of digits (like 999...9). The main part then computes res by comparing mult(l) and mult(r), and also checks if there's a midpoint between 999...9 (for different digit counts) within the l to r range, updating res with the max value from maxxes array.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S, processes it to find the number of substrings whose numeric value mod 2019 is the same, leading to combinations. The output is the count of such pairs.\n\nSo the first program's output is the input for the second. But in Fortran, I need to compute the first's result, then pass it as input to the second's processing, but without I/O in between. \n\nWait, but the second program expects a string input (the S variable). Wait, the first program's output is a number (the res variable printed at the end). So the second program's input is that number as a string? Because the second Java program reads a string S from input. \n\nWait, the first Java program's output is a number (like a long), so when the second program runs, it would read that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs 123, the second would read \"123\" as S. So in the Fortran program, the first part's result (the res from the first Java) must be converted to a string, then passed to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the l and r for the first part) from stdin.\n2. Compute the first part's result (the res from codeforces_86_A).\n3. Convert that res to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n4. Process that string through the second part's algorithm (the atcoder part).\n5. Output the final result from the second part.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read l and r from input.\n- Compute the first part's result (res1).\n- Convert res1 to a string (S).\n- Compute the second part's result (ans) using S.\n- Print ans.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (codeforces_86_A):\n\nFirst, the power function: counts digits. In Fortran, for a number a (as integer*8), we can loop dividing by 10 until it's 0, counting steps.\n\nThe mult function: for a given a, compute the maximum number with the same digits (like 999...9), then compute a*(max - a). \n\nThe main part:\n\nInitialize l and r from input. Then compute maxxes array. The maxxes array is precomputed for each digit count up to 10. The temp starts at 0, then each step adds 9*10^i. Wait, the code for maxxes:\n\ntemp starts at 0. For each i from 0 to 9:\n\ntemp = temp *10 +9. So for i=0, temp is 9. i=1: 99, etc. up to 9999999999 (10 digits). \n\nThen maxxes[i] = temp /2 * (temp - temp/2). Wait, that's (temp//2) * (temp - temp//2). Because in Java, integer division is truncating. So for even temp, it's exactly half. For odd, it's floor(temp/2). \n\nWait, the formula is (temp / 2) * (temp - temp/2). So for temp=9, temp/2 is 4, so 4*(9-4)=20. \n\nThen, the res is initialized to 0. Then, res is set to max between res and mult(l), then again with mult(r). \n\nThen, loop over i from 0 to 9, compute temp (the 999...9 for i+1 digits?), check if l <= temp/2 <= r. If so, compare maxxes[i] with current res and update. \n\nWait, the code for the loop:\n\ntemp is being built again here? Wait in the code, after the first loop (computing maxxes), the temp is reset to 0 again? Let me check the Java code:\n\nAfter the first for loop (i from 0 to 9 for maxxes), the code does:\n\ntemp = 0; \n\nThen loops again for i from 0 to 9, each time temp = temp*10 +9. So for each i, temp is the same as in the first loop. So the second loop is going through the same values as the first, but starting from 0 again. \n\nWait, in the first loop, the temp starts at 0, then for each i:\n\ni=0: temp = 0*10 +9 =9 \u2192 maxxes[0] = 9/2*(9-9/2) \u2192 4*(5) =20.\n\ni=1: temp=9*10+9=99 \u2192 maxxes[1] = 49 *50 = 2450.\n\nThen in the second loop, temp is reset to 0, and again for each i, temp is built again. So for each i in the second loop, temp is the same as the first loop's temp for that i. \n\nSo the second loop is checking for each digit count (from 1 to 10 digits?), whether the midpoint (temp/2) is between l and r. If so, then the maxxes[i] (from the first loop) is a candidate for res.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran:\n\nVariables:\n\nl and r are 8-byte integers (since Java uses long). In Fortran, we can use integer(8).\n\nThe power function can be a function that takes an integer(8) and returns an integer. \n\nThe mult function takes an integer(8) and returns an integer(8). \n\nThe main steps:\n\nRead l and r from input.\n\nCompute maxxes array (size 10). \n\nFirst, compute temp for each i from 0 to 9:\n\ntemp starts at 0. For each i in 0 to 9:\n\ntemp = temp *10 +9 \u2192 but in Fortran, need to track this. \n\nWait, in the first loop for maxxes:\n\ntemp starts at 0. \n\nLoop i from 0 to 9:\n\ntemp = temp *10 +9 \u2192 so for i=0, temp becomes 9, then 99, etc. \n\nmaxxes(i) = (temp /2) * (temp - temp/2). \n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for negative numbers, but here temp is positive. So for even temp, it's exact. For odd, it truncates. \n\nThen, after building maxxes, the res is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, res is set to max(res, mult(l)), then max(res, mult(r)). \n\nThen, reset temp to 0 again, and loop over i from 0 to 9 again, building temp again (same as before). For each i, compute temp (the 999...9 number with i+1 digits?), then check if l <= temp/2 <= r. If yes, then compare maxxes(i) with res and update res if needed. \n\nWait, the code in Java for the second loop:\n\ntemp is reset to 0, then for each i from 0 to 9:\n\ntemp = temp *10 +9 \u2192 same as before. \n\nThen check if l <= temp/2 and temp/2 <= r \u2192 if so, then res = max(res, maxxes[i]). \n\nSo the temp here is the same as the first loop's temp for each i. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps we can precompute the temp values once, store them in an array, so that we don't have to recompute them again. \n\nAlternatively, during the first loop, store the temp values in an array (like temp_values(0:9)), then in the second loop, just use those stored values. \n\nThat would be more efficient and avoid recomputing. \n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, declare an array temp_values(0:9) of integer(8). \n\nIn the first loop (for maxxes):\n\ntemp =0 \n\ndo i=0,9\n\n   temp = temp *10 +9\n\n   temp_values(i) = temp \n\n   maxxes(i) = (temp /2) * (temp - temp/2)\n\nend do \n\nThen, in the second loop, instead of recomputing temp, just use temp_values(i). \n\nThis way, we can avoid the second loop's temp computation. \n\nThat's better. \n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would be structured as such. \n\nNow, the mult function:\n\nfunction mult(a) result(res)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger(8) :: res\n\ninteger :: pow\n\npow = power(a)\n\nthen compute max_val as 999...9 (pow digits). \n\nmax_val = temp_values(pow-1) ? Wait, no. Wait, for pow digits, the max_val is 10^pow -1. \n\nWait, for pow digits, the maximum number is 10^pow -1. \n\nAlternatively, the temp_values array for i from 0 to 9 corresponds to 1-digit (9), 2-digit (99), etc. So for a number with pow digits, the max_val is temp_values(pow-1). \n\nWait, for example, if pow is 3 (3 digits), then temp_values(2) is 999. \n\nYes. So, in the mult function, given a, compute pow = power(a), then max_val is temp_values(pow-1). \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the mult function does:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < pow; ++j) { max = max *10 +9; }\n\nWhich starts with max=0, then after first iteration, 9, then 99, etc. So after pow steps, it's 999...9 (pow digits). \n\nSo the max is exactly temp_values(pow-1). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the mult function can be written as:\n\nfunction mult(a) result(res)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger(8) :: res, pow, max_val\n\npow = power(a)\n\nif (pow ==0) then \n\n   max_val =0 \n\nelse \n\n   max_val = temp_values(pow-1)\n\nend if \n\nres = a * (max_val - a)\n\nend function \n\nWait, but what if a is 0? Then pow would be 0 (since in power function, a starts at 0, and the loop runs while a>0. So if a is 0, the loop doesn't run, so res is 0. So pow would be 0. \n\nBut in that case, the max_val would be 0 (since temp_values is for 1 to 10 digits). So the code would handle that. \n\nNow, the power function:\n\nfunction power(a) result(res)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: res\n\nres =0 \n\ninteger(8) :: temp = a \n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   res = res +1 \n\n   temp = temp /10 \n\nend do \n\nend function \n\nOkay. \n\nNow, putting all together for the first part. \n\nNow, the second part (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n\nThe second part takes a string S, processes it to compute the number of substrings with mod 2019 equal. \n\nThe algorithm in Java is:\n\nRead S as a string. \n\nN is the length. \n\nmod_arr is an array of N elements. \n\nmod_cnt is an array of 2019 elements (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018). \n\nradix starts at 1. \n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\ncurrent character is S[N-1 -i], which is the (i+1)th character from the end (since in Java, the string is 0-based, so S.charAt(N-1 -i) is the ith character from the end when counting from 0). \n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i < N; i++):\n\nthe character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (index N-1), then i=1, N-2, etc. So processing the string from right to left. \n\nThe calculation for mod_arr[i] is:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019 \n\nthen if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019. \n\nThen mod_arr[i] = tmp mod 2019 \n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nradix is updated as (radix *10) mod 2019. \n\nFinally, ans is the sum over all mod_cnt[i] choose 2. \n\nWait, the code does mod_cnt[0]++ before the loop? Wait, no. Let me check the Java code again:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop over i, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, no, looking at the code:\n\nWait the code for the second part:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as new int[2019], so all zeros. \n\nThen in the loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\nmod_arr[i] is computed as (digit * radix) mod 2019, plus mod_arr[i-1] if i>0, then mod 2019. \n\nThen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nThen radix is updated. \n\nAfter the loop, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++; \n\nWait, why? \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nmod_cnt[0] is incremented again after the loop. \n\nWait, the code after the loop:\n\nans is initialized to 0. \n\nmod_cnt[0]++; \n\nthen for each i from 0 to 2018:\n\nans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 \n\nWait, why is mod_cnt[0] being incremented here? \n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nThe code for the second part's main:\n\nAfter the loop over i (processing each character), the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, that's after the loop. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an off-by-one error here. Let me think about the algorithm. \n\nThe problem is to count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) with i < j such that the substring S[j..k] (or whatever the substring is) mod 2019 is equal. \n\nThe approach is similar to the standard method for counting substrings with same mod. \n\nThe algorithm uses the fact that for a substring S[i..j], its value mod 2019 can be computed using a rolling hash. \n\nThe way the code is structured here is processing the string from the end. \n\nThe mod_arr[i] represents the value of the substring from position (N-1 -i) to the end, mod 2019. \n\nWait, perhaps the mod_arr[i] is the mod of the substring starting at position (N-1 -i) and going to the end. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe code processes the string from the end. \n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first character processed is the last character (i=0 in the loop corresponds to the last character). \n\nThe variable 'radix' is 1 initially. \n\nFor each step i (from 0 to N-1):\n\ndigit = S.charAt(N-1 -i) - '0'\n\ntmp = digit * radix mod 2019 \n\nif i !=0, then add mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019 \n\nthen mod_arr[i] = (tmp) mod 2019 \n\nmod_cnt[mod_arr[i]] is incremented. \n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp (after adding mod_arr[i-1] if i>0) mod 2019 \n\nthen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++; \n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nWait, the code:\n\ntmp is (digit * radix) mod 2019 \n\nthen if i !=0, tmp += mod_arr[i-1], then mod 2019 \n\nthen mod_arr[i] = tmp mod 2019 \n\nthen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented? \n\nWait, no, the code says:\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp \n\nthen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\ntmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\nif (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\nSo mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nAh, so mod_arr[i] is set to tmp, and mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nSo the mod_cnt array counts the number of times each mod value occurs in mod_arr. \n\nThen, after the loop, the code does mod_cnt[0]++; \n\nWait, why? \n\nBecause the empty substring? Or perhaps the initial state. \n\nWait, the problem requires counting all pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j such that the substring from j to k (or whatever) has the same mod. \n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to consider all prefixes. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering the empty prefix as having mod 0. \n\nWait, the code's final step is adding mod_cnt[0]++, which might be to account for the empty substring. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the string is \"0\". \n\nThen N=1. \n\nLoop runs for i=0:\n\ndigit is 0. \n\nradix is 1. \n\ntmp = 0 *1 mod2019 =0 \n\nsince i=0, no addition. \n\nmod_arr[0] =0 \n\nmod_cnt[0] becomes 1. \n\nThen after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented again (to 2). \n\nThen ans += 2*(2-1)/2 =1. \n\nWhich would count the pair (0,0) but indices must be different. Hmm, perhaps the code is counting the number of substrings (including the empty one?), but the problem requires substrings of length at least 1. \n\nWait, the problem statement for the second program is from AtCoder ABC164 D, which is \"Substrings with Even Length\". Wait, no, the problem is to count the number of pairs of distinct indices i < j such that the substring from i to j (or some other range) has a mod 2019 equal to another. \n\nWait, the problem's exact statement might be important here, but since I can't look it up, I have to rely on the code. \n\nThe code's approach is that mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the substring starting at position (N-1 -i) and going to the end. \n\nWait, perhaps the mod_arr[i] is the mod of the substring S_{N-1 -i} ... S_{N-1} (the last i+1 characters). \n\nThen, for two indices i and j (i < j), the substring from (N-1 -j) to (N-1 -i) would have a mod difference. \n\nAlternatively, the way the code works is that for each position, the mod is stored, and the count of each mod is tracked. \n\nThe total number of pairs is the sum over all mod values of C(count,2). \n\nBut the code adds mod_cnt[0]++, which increases the count for mod 0 by 1. \n\nThis is likely because the empty prefix (before the first character) has a mod of 0. \n\nSo the algorithm is considering all prefixes, including the empty one. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is:\n\n- The mod of the empty prefix is 0. \n\n- For each position i (from 0 to N-1), the mod of the substring from position (N-1 -i) to the end is stored in mod_arr[i]. \n\n- The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod occurs in mod_arr. \n\n- Then, adding 1 to mod_cnt[0] accounts for the empty prefix. \n\n- The total pairs are the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code must replicate this. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nThe input S is the string from the first part's output. \n\nWait, the first part's output is a number (res1), which is printed as a string. So in Fortran, after computing res1, we need to convert it to a string S. \n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. \n\nFor example:\n\ninteger(8) :: res1\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\nwrite(S, '(I0)') res1 \n\nBut need to make sure that the string is properly formatted. \n\nOnce S is obtained, then process it as per the second part's algorithm. \n\nNow, the variables for the second part:\n\nN is the length of S. \n\nmod_arr is an array of size N, integers mod 2019. \n\nmod_cnt is an array of size 2019, initialized to 0. \n\nradix starts at 1. \n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\ndigit = ichar(S(N - i)) - ichar('0') \n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So S(1) is the first character. \n\nWait, the Java code processes the characters from the end. \n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to N-1, the character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). \n\nIn Fortran, the string S is 1-based, so the first character is S(1), last is S(N). \n\nSo for i from 0 to N-1 (in Java), the corresponding Fortran index is (N - i). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's N-1 -i \u2192 when i=0 \u2192 N-1 (last character in Java's 0-based). \n\nIn Fortran, the last character is S(N). \n\nSo for i from 0 to N-1 (Java's loop), the Fortran character is S(N - i). \n\nWait, when i=0 \u2192 N -0 = N \u2192 correct. \n\ni=1 \u2192 N-1 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 0, N-1 \n\n   pos = N - i \n\n   c = S(pos:pos) \n\n   digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0') \n\n   ... \n\nend do \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variables can be from 0 to N-1. \n\nNow, the variables:\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N. \n\nmod_cnt is an array of size 2019. \n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0. \n\nradix starts at 1. \n\nInside the loop:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019 \n\nif i >0 then \n\n   tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019) \n\nend if \n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp \n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1 \n\nradix = mod(radix *10, 2019) \n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So mod_arr(0) would be invalid. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. \n\nSo to have mod_arr(0:N-1), need to declare it as integer, dimension(0:N-1). \n\nSimilarly for mod_cnt(0:2018). \n\nAlternatively, adjust the indices. \n\nAlternatively, shift the indices by 1. \n\nAlternatively, in the code, use 1-based indices. \n\nLet me think: \n\nIn the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1. \n\nIn Fortran, to have the same indices, we can declare mod_arr as dimension(0:N-1). \n\nBut in Fortran, when declaring arrays, the size must be known at compile time, but here N is variable. \n\nWait, but in Fortran 90+, we can use allocatable arrays. \n\nSo perhaps:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_N = 100000 \n\ninteger, dimension(0:max_N-1) :: mod_arr \n\nBut since the input S can be up to, say, 1e5 characters, but in the first part's output, the maximum possible res1 is when l and r are up to 1e18, but the first program's output is a number which can be up to (for example, when l=0 and r=9999999999, the max could be 9999999999 * (9999999999 - 0) which is a huge number, but when converted to a string, it's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, in the second part, the input S is the output of the first part, which is a number, so its length is manageable. \n\nBut to be safe, perhaps in Fortran, we can read the string S as a character array of sufficient length. \n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nAfter computing res1, we can write it to a string S using write statement. \n\nThen, the length N is len_trim(S). \n\nThen, allocate mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays. \n\nSo steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\n1. Convert res1 to a string S. \n\n2. Get N = len_trim(S). \n\n3. Allocate mod_arr(0:N-1) and mod_cnt(0:2018). \n\n4. Initialize mod_cnt to 0. \n\n5. Initialize radix =1. \n\n6. Loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\n   pos = N -i \n\n   c = S(pos:pos) \n\n   digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0') \n\n   tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019) \n\n   if (i >0) then \n\n      tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019) \n\n   end if \n\n   mod_arr(i) = tmp \n\n   mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1 \n\n   radix = mod(radix *10, 2019) \n\nend do \n\n7. mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1 \n\n8. Compute ans as sum over i=0 to 2018 of mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2 \n\n9. Output ans. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2, since it's an integer, we can compute it as (mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1))/2. \n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program. \n\nThe overall structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: l, r, res1, temp_values(0:9), maxxes(0:9), pow, max_val, temp, i, j\n\ninteger :: N, ans, mod_cnt(0:2018), mod_arr(0:*), radix, digit, tmp, pos\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\n!

Define the power function\n\ninteger function power(a)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a \n\ninteger :: res \n\nres =0 \n\ninteger(8) :: temp = a \n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   res = res +1 \n\n   temp = temp /10 \n\nend do \n\npower = res \n\nend function \n\n! Define the mult function\n\ninteger(8) function mult(a)\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a \n\ninteger :: pow \n\ninteger(8) :: max_val \n\npow = power(a)\n\nif (pow ==0) then \n\n   max_val =0 \n\nelse \n\n   max_val = temp_values(pow-1)\n\nend if \n\nmult = a * (max_val -a)\n\nend function \n\nend program \n\nWait, but there's a problem here: the temp_values array is declared in the main program, but the mult function uses it. \n\nIn Fortran, the function mult is inside the program, so it can access the temp_values array. \n\nBut in the code above, temp_values is declared in the main program, so the functions can see it. \n\nBut in the code above, the temp_values array is declared as:\n\ninteger(8) :: temp_values(0:9), maxxes(0:9), pow, max_val, temp, i, j\n\nWait, variables like pow, max_val, temp, i, j are declared as integers, but in the first part, temp is an integer(8). \n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\ntemp is used in the loop for precomputing temp_values. \n\nIn the code above, temp is declared as integer, but in the loop, temp is multiplied by 10 and added 9. \n\nWait, but in the first part's code, temp starts at 0 and becomes 9, 99, etc. up to 9999999999 (for 10 digits). \n\nThe maximum value for 10 digits is 9999999999, which is 10^10-1, which is 9,999,999,999. That's within the 32-bit integer (since 2^31 is about 2e9, but 1e10 is larger). So we need to use integer(8) for temp. \n\nAh, so in the variable declarations, temp should be integer(8). \n\nLooking back at the variable declarations in the code I wrote earlier:\n\nThe variables after the first part's read:\n\ninteger(8) :: l, r, res1, temp_values(0:9), maxxes(0:9), pow, max_val, temp, i, j\n\nWait, pow is an integer (since it's the number of digits, up to 10). \n\nmax_val is integer(8). \n\ntemp is integer(8). \n\ni and j are loop variables, integers. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nBut in the code, the temp_values array is integer(8), which is correct. \n\nThe mult function uses temp_values, which is okay. \n\nThe power function returns an integer, which is correct. \n\nNow, the second part's variables:\n\nmod_arr is declared as integer, dimension(0:*), but in the code, it's allocated as mod_arr(0:N-1). \n\nmod_cnt is declared as integer, dimension(0:2018). \n\nThe loop over i from 0 to N-1 is okay. \n\nThe code for the second part seems okay. \n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The temp_values array is computed in the main program, and the mult function uses it. Since the mult function is inside the program, this should be okay. \n\n- The variables in the mult function: pow is the number of digits, which is an integer. \n\n- The conversion of res1 to a string S. The write statement uses '(I0)', which should format the number without leading spaces. \n\n- The length of S is up to, say, 20 characters (since the first part's maximum res1 could be up to (9999999999)^2, which is 1e20, so 20 digits). \n\nThe character(len=20) S should be sufficient. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop for checking midpoints, the code loops over i from 0 to 9, and uses temp_values(i). \n\nWait, in the original Java code, after resetting temp to 0, the code loops again, building temp again. \n\nBut in the Fortran code, I replaced that with using temp_values(i). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother check: in the first part's code, after computing maxxes, the code loops over i from 0 to 9 again, but uses temp_values(i) (since temp is reset to 0 and then built again, but in the code I used temp_values(i)). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nNow, testing edge cases. \n\nFor example, if the first part's output is 0, then S is \"0\", N=1. \n\nProcessing that in the second part:\n\nmod_arr(0) is computed as follows:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigit is 0. \n\nradix is 1. \n\ntmp = 0*1 mod2019 =0 \n\nsince i=0, no addition. \n\nmod_arr(0)=0 \n\nmod_cnt(0) becomes 1. \n\nThen, after loop, mod_cnt(0) becomes 2. \n\nans is (2 choose 2) =1. \n\nWhich matches the code's calculation. \n\nAnother test case: if the first part's output is 123, then S is \"123\", N=3. \n\nThe second part processes the string \"123\". \n\nThe code should compute the correct mod counts. \n\nOverall, this should work. \n\nNow, writing the final Fortran code with all these considerations."
