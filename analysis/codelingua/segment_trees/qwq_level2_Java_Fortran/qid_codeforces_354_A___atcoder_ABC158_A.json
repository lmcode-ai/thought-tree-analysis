    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_354_A) reads several integers from input: N, L, R, QL, QR, followed by N integers for the array W. It calculates some sums and then iterates to find the minimum value based on certain conditions. The output is the minimum value.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B', then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is used as input to the next. Wait, but looking at the two Java programs, the first one's output is a number (min), and the second one's input is a string. That doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input for the second? But the second program expects a string, not a number. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or perhaps the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are not directly connected? Wait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a string input. That would mean the first program's output (a number) is given as input to the second, which expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string. So perhaps the first program's output is a string? Wait, looking back at the first Java program, it outputs a number via System.out.println(min). So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the input is a single string). That's a problem. Unless the second program is expecting the first's output as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program reads that as the string \"123\", which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so it would output \"No\". But maybe the actual input for the second program is a different string, but the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the two Java programs are not supposed to be connected in that way? Or maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are not connected. But the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program outputs a number. So perhaps the second program is expecting that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"42\", then the second program reads \"42\" as the input string, which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so it would output \"No\". But maybe the actual test case requires that the first program's output is a string? Wait, looking at the first Java code, the first program's output is a number, so that's a problem. Unless there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the two Java programs are not supposed to be connected in terms of input/output. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed as per the given code. Alternatively, maybe the second program is not part of the sequence? Or perhaps the first program's output is not used as input to the second, but the problem says they are in sequence. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program, it reads N, L, R, QL, QR, then N numbers. The second program reads a string. So perhaps the first program's output is a number, and the second program's input is a separate string. But according to the problem statement, the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program outputs a number. So this is conflicting. Maybe the problem is that the two Java programs are not supposed to be connected, but the user wants to translate them into a single Fortran program that does both steps in sequence, with the first's output being the input to the second. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the second's input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program outputs a number. So maybe the first program's output is written as a string, and the second program reads that as the input string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program reads \"123\" as the input string, which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so it outputs \"No\". But perhaps in some test cases, the first program's output is a string? No, the first program's code clearly outputs a number. So this is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are not connected, and the user wants to translate each into Fortran, but combine them into a single program that does both steps in sequence, with the first part's output being the input to the second part. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then given as input to the second program, which expects a string. That can't work. Unless the second program is expecting a number as input, but in its code, it reads a string. So perhaps the second program is expecting the first's output as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"42\", then the second program reads that as the string \"42\", which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so it outputs \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result (the min value), then use that as the input to the second program's logic. But the second program's logic requires a string input. So the first part's output (the min value) must be converted into a string, then the second part checks if that string contains 'A' and 'B'. But the min is a number, so the string would be like \"1234\", which doesn't have 'A' or 'B', so the second part would output \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is a separate string, but the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program outputs a number. So this is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are not connected, and the user wants to translate them into a single Fortran program that does both steps in sequence, but with the first part reading input, then processing, then the second part processing further, but without I/O in between. Wait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then given as input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that number as a string. So the Fortran program must first compute the first part's output (the min value), then pass that as a string to the second part's processing, which checks if that string contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the inputs for the first Java program, compute the min, then use that min as the input string for the second part, then compute the second part's output (Yes/No based on whether the string contains both 'A' and 'B').\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a single string. So the first program's output (the min) is written as a string, which is then the input to the second part. So the Fortran program must first compute the min, then check if that min's string representation contains both 'A' and 'B'. But numbers don't have letters, so the second part would always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the actual input for the second program is different. Wait, perhaps the two Java programs are not connected, but the user wants to translate them into a single Fortran program that does both steps in sequence, with the first part's input being read first, then the second part's input is read next, but the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then given as input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that number as a string. So the Fortran program must first compute the first part's output (the min), then pass that as a string to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the inputs for the first Java program (N, L, R, QL, QR, then N numbers).\n\n2. Compute the min value as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Then, take that min value as the input string for the second part (i.e., convert the min to a string).\n\n4. Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B', then output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a string, so the first program's output (the min) must be converted to a string and passed as the input to the second part. So the Fortran program must do that.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Read all inputs for the first program (N, L, R, QL, QR, then N W values).\n\n- Compute the min as per first Java code.\n\n- Convert min to a string (e.g., using write statement to a character variable).\n\n- Then, check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n- Output the result of the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part's logic is to check if the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the first part's output is a number, the string would be like \"1234\", which has no letters, so the second part would output \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is not the first's output, but the problem says it is. So the Fortran program must do exactly that.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead N, L, R, QL, QR, then N integers into an array W.\n\nCompute the sum array. The sum array in Java is sum[0] = 0, sum[1] = W[0], sum[2] = W[0]+W[1], etc. So in Fortran, we can have an array sum of size N+1, with sum(1) = 0, and then loop from 1 to N, sum(n+1) = sum(n) + W(n).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for n from 0 to N-1 (since W has N elements). So in Fortran, the indices would be 1-based. So in Fortran, the W array would be of size N, with indices 1 to N. The sum array would be size N+1, with sum(1) = 0, and for each i from 1 to N, sum(i+1) = sum(i) + W(i).\n\nThen, the loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). In Java, firstR is from 0 to N. For each firstR, lCount is firstR (since firstR is the number of elements on the left?), then rCount is N - lCount. Then compute the candidate value as sum[lCount] * L + (sum[N] - sum[lCount]) * R. Then compute llCount and rrCount as max(0, lCount - rCount -1) and max(0, rCount - lCount -1). Then add llCount * QL and rrCount * QR to the candidate. Keep track of the minimum.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. So we need to declare integers for N, L, R, QL, QR, W array, sum array. The min is a long in Java, so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(18) for 64-bit integers).\n\nThe second part is to take the min value, convert it to a string, then check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the min is a number, the string will have digits only, so the answer is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is not a number? Let me check again. The first Java program's output is min, which is a long. So the string would be the numeric value. So the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but perhaps the user intended that the two Java programs are not connected, but the problem says they are. So I have to proceed as per the problem's instruction.\n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read the inputs. The first program's input is N, L, R, QL, QR, followed by N integers.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read them as:\n\nread*, N, L, R, QL, QR\n\nthen read the W array:\n\nread*, (W(i), i=1,N)\n\nThen, the sum array:\n\nallocate(sum(0:N)) or declare as sum(0:N). Wait, in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with lower bounds. Let's see:\n\nWe can declare sum as an array of size N+1, with indices 1 to N+1. Wait, but in Java, sum[0] is 0, sum[1] = W[0], etc. So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N) :: sum\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with explicit sizes. So perhaps:\n\nallocate(sum(0:N)) after reading N.\n\nAlternatively, since N is read first, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\ninteger, allocatable :: W(:), sum(:)\n\ninteger*8 :: min_val, cand\n\ninteger :: firstR, lCount, rCount, llCount, rrCount\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\n\n! Read inputs\n\nread*, N, L, R, QL, QR\n\nallocate(W(N), sum(0:N))\n\nread*, (W(i), i=1,N)\n\n! Compute sum array\n\nsum(0) = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   sum(i) = sum(i-1) + W(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Initialize min_val to a large value\n\nmin_val = huge(min_val)\n\ndo firstR = 0, N\n\n   lCount = firstR\n\n   rCount = N - lCount\n\n   cand = sum(lCount) * L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount)) * R\n\n   llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\n   rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n   cand = cand + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\n   if (cand < min_val) then\n\n      min_val = cand\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now, process the second part\n\n! Convert min_val to string\n\nwrite(str_min, '(I0)') min_val\n\n! Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str_min)\n\n   if (str_min(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (str_min(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   print*, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print*, 'No'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(W, sum)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the 'A' and 'B' check is case-sensitive? The Java code uses contains(\"A\") and \"B\", so case-sensitive. The input string in the second Java program is a string, so the Fortran code must check for uppercase letters.\n\nBut in the first part's output, the min_val is a number, so when converted to a string, it's digits only. So the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the problem's instruction, the second program's input is the first's output, so this is correct.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string, so the first program's output (the number) is written as a string, which is then the input to the second part. So the Fortran code must do exactly that.\n\nNow, checking the code:\n\nThe first part's variables:\n\n- W is an array of integers.\n\n- sum is an array of integers (since W's elements are integers, and sum is their cumulative sum).\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the sum array is of type int, so in Fortran, sum can be integer. The cand is computed as sum(lCount)*L, which could be large, but in Java it's stored as a long. In Fortran, using integer*8 (8-byte integer) for cand and min_val is better to avoid overflow.\n\nYes, so in the code above, min_val and cand are declared as integer*8.\n\nThe loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). The loop in Fortran is do firstR = 0, N.\n\nThe lCount is firstR, rCount is N - lCount.\n\nThe llCount is max(0, lCount - rCount -1). Similarly for rrCount.\n\nThe cand is computed as sum(lCount)*L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount))*R. Then add llCount*QL and rrCount*QR.\n\nThen, the min_val is updated if cand is smaller.\n\nThen, converting min_val to a string, and checking for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The sum array in Fortran is 0-based. So sum(0) is 0, sum(1) is W(1), etc. So that's correct.\n\n- The loop for firstR from 0 to N: in Fortran, the loop variable can be 0, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. However, in the code above, the sum array is declared with 0:N, so firstR can be 0 to N.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you allocate sum(0:N), the indices are 0 to N. So sum(0) is valid.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in the Java code, the initial min is Long.MAX_VALUE. In Fortran, initializing min_val to a large value. Using huge(min_val) which for integer*8 is 2^63-1, which is correct.\n\nThe second part's string conversion: using write(str_min, '(I0)') min_val. This converts the integer to a string without leading spaces. The len_trim(str_min) will give the length of the string.\n\nThen, checking each character in the string for 'A' or 'B'.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second Java program's code is in a class with a solve method. The second Java program's main calls the solve method, which reads the input string and checks for 'A' and 'B'. So the Fortran code correctly replicates that by taking the first program's output (min_val) as the input string for the second part.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program should be as written above.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the variables are declared as int, but in the second part, the string is read as in.next(). So in the second Java program, the input is a single string. So the first program's output must be that string. So the Fortran code correctly converts the min_val to a string and uses that as the input for the second part's check.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I need to write the Fortran code properly, making sure all variables are declared correctly, and the loops are correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the first Java code, the loop for firstR is from 0 to N inclusive. So in Fortran, the loop is do firstR = 0, N.\n\nThe variables lCount and rCount are integers.\n\nThe code should be okay.\n\nNow, the final code:\n\nI'll write it step by step.\n\nThe program starts with the main program block.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, the 'huge' function is from the intrinsic module, so we need to include that.\n\nWait, the 'huge' function is part of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module, but in many compilers, it's available without explicit inclusion. Alternatively, to be safe, perhaps use a large initial value like 2^63-1, but using huge is better.\n\nAlternatively, set min_val to a very large number, like 1e18, but using huge is better.\n\nThe code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\ninteger, allocatable :: W(:), sum(:)\n\ninteger*8 :: min_val, cand\n\ninteger :: firstR, lCount, rCount, llCount, rrCount, i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\n! Read inputs\n\nread*, N, L, R, QL, QR\n\nallocate(W(N), sum(0:N))\n\nread*, (W(i), i=1,N)\n\n! Compute sum array\n\nsum(0) = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   sum(i) = sum(i-1) + W(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Initialize min_val to a large value\n\nmin_val = huge(min_val)\n\ndo firstR = 0, N\n\n   lCount = firstR\n\n   rCount = N - lCount\n\n   cand = sum(lCount) * L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount)) * R\n\n   llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\n   rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n   cand = cand + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\n   if (cand < min_val) then\n\n      min_val = cand\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Convert min_val to string\n\nwrite(str_min, '(I0)') min_val\n\n! Check for 'A' and 'B'\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str_min)\n\n   if (str_min(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (str_min(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   print*, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print*, 'No'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(W, sum)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the first part, the variables lCount, rCount, etc., are integers. The cand is computed as sum(lCount)*L, which is integer multiplied by integer, but stored in an integer*8 variable. That's okay.\n\nThe 'max' function in Fortran is MAX, which works for integers.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"AB123\", but that's impossible because it's a number. So the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second, so this is correct.\n\nTherefore, this code should work."
