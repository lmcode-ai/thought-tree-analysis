So the code is wrong. But since the problem's code is given, I have to replicate it as is. So in the code's logic, when n=1, the code's output is the max_count, which is 1 - arr[0]. But the code's code has a separate check which outputs 0 or 1, which is the same as max_count. So the code's check is redundant but correct. So in Fortran, perhaps the code can just proceed with the max_count as computed, and the check is not needed.",

So the code's check is redundant but correct. So in Fortran, perhaps the code can just use the max_count, but the code's check is there. So to replicate exactly, perhaps the code should have the check. Wait, but in the code's code, the check is only there for n==1. So in Fortran, after computing max_count, we can do:\n\nif (n ==1) then\n\n   if (arr(1) ==1) then\n\n      max_count =0\n\n   else\n\n      max_count =1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but that would overwrite the max_count. But according to the code's logic, the max_count is already correct. So this is redundant. But perhaps the code's original code has a bug here. Alternatively, maybe the code's problem requires that when n=1, you can choose to flip or not. So the maximum is the maximum between the original and the flipped. So the code's code is wrong. But since the problem requires to translate the code as given, I have to follow it exactly. Wait, the code's code for n==1 is:\n\nif (arr[0] ==1) System.out.println(0); else System.out.println(1);\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1 - arr[0].",

Now compute the second part. nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) < = position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\n   end do\n\n   start = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n   result = position - start +1\n\n   print*, result\n\ncontains\n\n   integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index*(index-1))/2\n\n   end function\n\nend program main\n\nThis should work.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_327_A). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It then iterates over all possible subarrays (i to j), flips the bits (0 becomes 1 and vice versa) in that subarray, counts the number of 1s, and keeps track of the maximum count. Finally, it outputs the maximum count unless n is 1, in which case it outputs 0 or 1 based on the original value.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_622_A) takes a long integer position, calculates some sequence, and outputs a value based on that. The sequence seems to be defined such that the value at index k is 1 + (k*(k-1))/2. The solve function finds the starting index of the sequence where the position falls into, then calculates the output as (position - start) +1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these two into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first Java program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the max count) is the input to the second's position variable.\n\n2. The Fortran program must read input from stdin (only the first part), process both steps without intermediate I/O, and output the final result of the second step.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n- Read n and the array from stdin (first part's input).\n- Compute the max count as per the first Java program.\n- Use that max count as the input to the second part's position variable.\n- Compute the result of the second part and print it.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nThe first Java program's main steps:\n\nRead n, then array elements.\n\nLoop over all i and j (i <= j) to form subarrays. For each subarray, create a copy of the array, flip the bits in the subarray, count the 1s, track the maximum.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the flipping is done on a copy of the array each time. So for each i and j, they make a copy of the original array, then flip the elements from i to j. Then count the 1s in that modified array.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are easier to handle. Let's see:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. Need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based, but adjust loops accordingly.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the array is declared as int arr[] = new int[n]; so indices 0 to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with indices starting at 1 unless specified. So perhaps we can use 1-based here, but need to adjust loops.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use 0-based in Fortran by declaring the array with indices 0 to n-1. But Fortran allows that with the DIMENSION statement.\n\nSo first, in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array arr(0:n-1).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each j from i to n-1:\n\n      create a copy of arr into brr.\n\n      flip the bits from i to j in brr.\n\n      count the number of 1s in brr.\n\n      update max if needed.\n\nBut creating a copy each time might be inefficient, but since the problem is likely small (given the original code's approach), it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can be copied with array assignments. So for each i and j, we can do:\n\nbrr = arr\n\nThen loop from k = i to j, and flip each element.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the code for flipping is:\n\nfor (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {\n\n    if (brr[k] == 0) brr[k] = 1;\n\n    else brr[k] = 0;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, for each k from i to j (inclusive), set brr(k) = 1 - brr(k).\n\nYes, that's simpler.\n\nThen, count the number of 1s in brr. The function checKNo in Java just counts the 1s. So in Fortran, we can write a function or just compute it inline.\n\nNow, the first part's output is the maximum count. But in the Java code, if n is 1, it outputs 0 or 1 based on the original array. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the first Java code's main:\n\nif (n == 1) {\n\n    if (arr[0] == 1) System.out.println(0);\n\n    else System.out.println(1);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(max);\n\n}\n\nWait, why? Because when n is 1, the code's loop would have considered flipping the single element. The maximum would be 1 if original was 0, or 0 if original was 1. Because flipping it would give the opposite. Wait, but the code's logic for n=1:\n\nThe loop over i and j would have i=0 and j=0. The code would flip that element, so the count would be 1 - original. But the code's max would be the maximum between the original (if not flipped?) Wait, no, because in the code, for each i and j, they create a copy of the array, then flip the subarray. So for the entire array (i=0, j=0), flipping it would give 1 - arr[0]. The count would be that value. So the maximum would be max between the original array's count (if not flipped?) Wait, no, because the code is considering all possible subarrays. Wait, the code's loop is over all possible i and j, including the entire array. So for n=1, the code would compute the maximum between flipping the element (so count is 1 - arr[0]) and not flipping? Wait no, because the code is considering all possible subarrays. Wait, the code's approach is that for each possible subarray (i to j), it flips that subarray and computes the count. So for n=1, the only possible subarray is the entire array. So flipping it would give 1 - arr[0], so the count is that. The maximum would be the maximum between that and any other subarrays? But there are no other subarrays. Wait, the code's loop for i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1. So for n=1, i=0, j=0. So the code would flip the element, so the count is 1 - arr[0]. But the original array's count (without flipping) is arr[0]. So the maximum between those two? Wait no, because the code is only considering the flipped version. Wait, no, the code is considering all possible subarrays and flipping them. So for each subarray, the code flips it and then counts. So the maximum is the maximum over all possible flipped subarrays. So for n=1, the only option is to flip the single element, so the count is 1 - arr[0]. But the code's output for n=1 is different. Let me see the code again:\n\nIn the code, after computing max, it checks if n ==1. Then, if arr[0] is 1, it outputs 0, else 1. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous logic. Because according to the code's logic, when n=1, the maximum would be 1 - arr[0], so the code's output would be that. But the code instead outputs 0 or 1 based on the original value. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the code has a bug? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=1 and arr[0] is 1. Then, the code's loop would process i=0, j=0. The code creates a copy of the array (so brr[0] =1). Then flips it (so becomes 0). The count is 0. So the max would be 0. But the code's output is 0 in that case, which matches. But if arr[0] is 0, then after flipping, it becomes 1, so count is 1, so the code's output would be 1, which also matches. So the code's output for n=1 is indeed the same as the maximum. So why does the code have a separate check for n==1? Because perhaps the code's logic for the loops is not considering the case where you don't flip any subarray? Wait, no. Because the code's loops consider all possible subarrays, including the empty subarray? Wait no, the loops start at i and j. Wait, the code's loops are for i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1. So for each i and j, the subarray is from i to j. So for n=1, the only subarray is the entire array. So flipping it gives the count as 1 - arr[0]. The maximum would be that. So the code's output for n=1 is indeed the maximum. So why does the code have a separate check for n==1? Maybe because in the code's logic, when n is 1, the loop would have considered flipping the element, but the code's max is initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE. So if the array is [1], then the maximum would be 0 (from flipping), which is correct. But if the array is [0], then the maximum is 1. So the code's output is correct. So why does the code have that separate check? Maybe because the code's loop is not considering the case where you don't flip any elements? Wait, no. Because the code's loop is over all possible subarrays, and for each, it flips that subarray. So the original array is not considered unless the subarray is not flipped. Wait, no. The code is always flipping the subarray. So the original array's count is only considered if there's a subarray that is not flipped. But the code's approach is that for each subarray, you flip it and then count. So the original array's count is only possible if you don't flip any subarray. But the code's loops are considering all possible subarrays, so the only way to get the original array's count is if you don't flip any subarray. But the code's loops are flipping every possible subarray. So the original array's count is not considered. Wait, that's a problem. Because the code's approach is to flip every possible subarray and take the maximum of those. But perhaps the optimal solution could be to not flip any subarray. So the code is missing that possibility.\n\nWait, the problem statement for codeforces_327_A is probably to choose a subarray to flip (or not flip any) to maximize the number of 1s. So the code's approach is to consider all possible subarrays to flip, but not considering the option of flipping none. So the maximum could be the original array's count, which is not considered in the code's current approach.\n\nWait, looking at the code's initialization of max as Integer.MIN_VALUE. Then, for each subarray, it flips it and computes the count. So the original array's count is only considered if there's a subarray that is not flipped. But the code's loops are flipping every possible subarray. So the original array's count is not considered unless there's a subarray that is not flipped. But the code's loops are flipping every possible subarray. So the original array's count is only possible if there's a subarray that is not flipped, which would require not flipping any subarray. But the code's loops are considering all possible subarrays, so the only way to get the original array's count is if there's a subarray that is not flipped. But the code's loops are flipping every possible subarray. So the code is missing the case where you don't flip any subarray. Therefore, the code is incorrect. But perhaps the problem requires that you must flip exactly one subarray. Wait, the problem statement for codeforces 327A is probably: You can choose any subarray (possibly empty?) and flip all its elements. Then find the maximum possible number of 1s. Wait, but flipping a subarray of length 0 (i.e., not flipping anything) would leave the array as is. So the code's approach is wrong because it's not considering the case where you don't flip any subarray. So the code's max is the maximum over all possible flipped subarrays, but the actual maximum could be the original array's count. So the code is incorrect. But the problem's code is given, so perhaps the problem requires that you must flip exactly one subarray. Or maybe the problem's code is correct. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic is as written, so I have to translate it as is. So the code's max is the maximum over all possible subarrays flipped. So for n=1, the code's output is correct as per the code's logic. So in the Fortran code, I need to replicate that.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program (codeforces_622_A). It reads a long integer position, then computes some sequence and outputs a value.\n\nThe sequence is defined such that the value at index k is 1 + (k*(k-1))/2. The solve function finds the starting index of the sequence where the position falls into, then calculates the output as (position - start) +1.\n\nThe algorithm in the solve function:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx to 1.\n\nWhile the value at 2*nrstSeqStartIndx is less than position, multiply nrstSeqStartIndx by 2.\n\nThen, while the value at (nrstSeqStartIndx +1) is <= position, increment nrstSeqStartIndx.\n\nThen, the start is the value at nrstSeqStartIndx, and the output is (position - start) +1.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe first loop finds the largest power of two such that the value at that index is less than position. Then the second loop adjusts to find the exact starting index.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index*(index-1))/2.\n\nWait, let me compute for example:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(1) = 1 + (1*0)/2 = 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) = 1 + (2*1)/2 = 2.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(3) = 1 + (3*2)/2 = 4.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(4) = 1 + (4*3)/2 = 7.\n\nSo the sequence starts as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, etc. Each term is previous + (index-1). Because the difference between consecutive terms is (k*(k-1)/2 +1) - ( (k-1)*(k-2)/2 +1 ) = (k(k-1) - (k-1)(k-2))/2 = (k-1)(k - (k-2))/2 = (k-1)(2)/2 = (k-1). So each term increases by (k-1) when moving to index k.\n\nThe algorithm is trying to find the index where the position is located. The first loop doubles the index until the value at 2*index is beyond the position. Then, it steps forward until the next value exceeds the position. The start is the value at the current index, and the output is position - start +1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's code would take the position (which is the output of the first part) and compute this.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must read the input for the first part (n and array), compute the max count, then use that as the position for the second part, compute the result, and output it.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read n and the array.\n\nThen compute the max count as per the first Java code.\n\nThen compute the second part's result using that max as the position.\n\nFinally, print the result.\n\nNow, let's code each part step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n and array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, arr(0:n-1) \u2014 but in Fortran, we can't have variable-length arrays in older versions, but assuming Fortran 90 or later, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, better to read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(n)) \u2014 but indices from 1 to n. Wait, but the Java code uses 0-based. So perhaps better to use 1-based here, but adjust loops accordingly.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based with indices 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to use 1-based, but adjust loops to start from 1 to n. So the code can be:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nread(*,*) arr\n\nThen, the loops for i and j would be from 1 to n, and j from i to n.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loops are for i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1. So in Fortran, with 1-based arrays, the loops would be i from 1 to n, j from i to n.\n\nThen, for each i and j:\n\ncreate a copy of arr into brr.\n\nflip the elements from i to j.\n\ncount the 1s.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmax_count = -huge(max_count)  ! Initialize to minimum possible.\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = i, n\n\n      brr = arr  ! Copy array.\n\n      do k = i, j\n\n         brr(k) = 1 - brr(k)\n\n      end do\n\n      current_count = sum(brr)\n\n      if (current_count > max_count) then\n\n         max_count = current_count\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the function checKNo counts the number of 1s. So in Fortran, sum(brr) would give the count of 1s, since 0 and 1 are the elements. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array elements can be 0 or 1? The problem probably requires that the input is 0 or 1. So assuming that the input is 0 or 1, then yes.\n\nNow, after computing max_count, check if n ==1. Then, if n is 1, the code's output is 0 or 1 based on the original array. Wait, but according to the code's logic, when n=1, the max_count is 1 - arr(1). Because flipping the single element. So if arr(1) is 1, then max_count is 0. So the code's output is max_count. But the code's code has a separate check for n==1, which outputs 0 or 1. Wait, but according to the code's logic, when n=1, the code's max would be 1 - arr(1). So the code's output is max_count. But the code's code has:\n\nif (n ==1) {\n\n    if (arr[0] ==1) System.out.println(0);\n\n    else System.out.println(1);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(max);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in that case, when n=1 and arr[0] is 1, the code's max would be 0, so the code's output is 0, which matches the code's check. Similarly, if arr[0] is 0, the max is 1, which matches the code's check. So the code's check is redundant, but perhaps the code's logic is correct. So in Fortran, the code can proceed as:\n\nif (n ==1) then\n\n   if (arr(1) ==1) then\n\n      max_count =0\n\n   else\n\n      max_count =1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but according to the code's logic, the max_count is already computed as 1 - arr(1). So the code's check is redundant. But perhaps the code's original code has a bug where the loops don't consider the case where you don't flip any subarray. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n=1 and arr is [1]. The code's loops would process i=1, j=1. The code flips it to 0, so the count is 0. The max is 0. The code's check outputs 0, which is correct.\n\nIf the array is [0], the max is 1, which is correct.\n\nBut if the code's loops were not considering the case where you don't flip any subarray, then the original array's count (1 in the case of [1]) would not be considered. But in the code's logic, the max is initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE, so the first iteration would set it to 0 (for [1]), which is correct. So the code's check is redundant but correct. So in Fortran, perhaps the code can just proceed with the max_count as computed, and the check is not needed. Wait, but in the code's code, when n=1, the code's output is the same as the max_count. So why does the code have that check? Because perhaps the code's loops are not considering the case where you don't flip any subarray. Wait, but in the code's loops, the only possible subarray is the entire array. So flipping it gives the count of 1 - arr[0]. The original array's count is arr[0], which is not considered. So the code's max is the maximum between flipping the subarray (the only option) and the original array? No, the code's loops only consider flipping the subarray. So the code's max is the count after flipping. But the problem might require that you can choose to flip any subarray (including none). So the maximum could be the original array's count. So the code is wrong. But since the problem's code is given, I have to replicate it as is. So in the code's logic, when n=1, the code's output is the max_count, which is 1 - arr[0]. But the code's code has a separate check which outputs 0 or 1, which is the same as max_count. So the code's check is redundant but correct. So in Fortran, perhaps the code can just proceed with the max_count as computed, and the check is not needed. Wait, but in the code's code, the check is there. So perhaps the code's logic is different. Let me re-examine the code's code:\n\nWait, in the code's code, the code's max is initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE. Then, for each subarray, it flips it and computes the count. So the maximum is the maximum over all those flipped subarrays. The original array's count is not considered. So the code's output for n=1 is the count after flipping the only possible subarray. Which is correct according to the code's logic. But the code's code has a separate check for n==1, which outputs 0 or 1. Wait, but that's exactly the same as the max_count. So why is that check there? Maybe a mistake in the code. Or perhaps the code's problem requires that you must flip exactly one subarray, so the original array is not an option. So the code's logic is correct. So in Fortran, the code can proceed with the max_count as computed, and the check is redundant. But to replicate the code exactly, perhaps the code should have the check. Let me see:\n\nIn the code's code, when n=1, the code's loops would have i=0, j=0. The code flips the element, so the count is 1 - arr[0]. The max is set to that. Then, the code's check says: if n==1, then output 0 if arr[0] is 1 (so the max is 0, which matches), else 1 (if arr[0] is 0, max is 1). So the code's check is redundant but correct. So in Fortran, perhaps the code can just use the max_count, but the code's check is there. So to replicate exactly, perhaps the code should have the check. Wait, but in the code's code, the check is only there for n==1. So in Fortran, after computing max_count, we can do:\n\nif (n ==1) then\n\n   if (arr(1) ==1) then\n\n      max_count =0\n\n   else\n\n      max_count =1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but that would overwrite the max_count. But according to the code's logic, the max_count is already correct. So this is redundant. But perhaps the code's original code has a bug here. Alternatively, maybe the code's problem requires that when n=1, you can choose to flip or not. So the maximum is the maximum between the original and the flipped. So the code's code is wrong. But since the problem requires to translate the code as given, I have to follow it exactly.\n\nWait, the code's code for n==1 is:\n\nif (arr[0] ==1) System.out.println(0); else System.out.println(1);\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1 - arr[0]. Which is exactly what the max_count would be. So the code's check is redundant. So in Fortran, the code can just proceed with the max_count. So perhaps the code's check is a mistake, but since the problem requires to translate the code as given, perhaps the code's check is part of the code's logic. Wait, but in the code's code, the check is only for n==1. So in the code's code, when n is 1, the code's output is 1 - arr[0], which is the same as the max_count. So the code's check is redundant. So in Fortran, the code can just use the max_count. So perhaps the code's check is a mistake, but the code's code is correct. So in Fortran, the code can proceed without the check, because the max_count is already correct.\n\nTherefore, the first part's code in Fortran can be written as:\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nread(*,*) arr\n\nmax_count = -huge(max_count)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = i, n\n\n      brr = arr\n\n      do k = i, j\n\n         brr(k) = 1 - brr(k)\n\n      end do\n\n      current_count = sum(brr)\n\n      if (current_count > max_count) then\n\n         max_count = current_count\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second part's code takes the max_count as the position.\n\nNow, the second part's code in Fortran:\n\nThe second part's code reads a long integer (position), then computes the result.\n\nIn Fortran, integers can be 64-bit (selected_int_kind(18)), but assuming that the input can be up to 1e18, so we need to use integer(8) or similar.\n\nBut in the first part's output, the max_count can be up to n (if all elements are 0 and flipped to 1). So for n up to, say, 1e5, the max_count can be up to 1e5, which is way smaller than 1e18. So the second part's position is the max_count from the first part.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's code would be:\n\nposition = max_count\n\nThen compute the result.\n\nNow, the second part's algorithm:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\nWhile getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position:\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx *=2\n\nThen, while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position:\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx +=1\n\nThen, start = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = position - start +1\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, start, result\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nstart = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = position - start +1\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex is:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n   integer(8) :: res\n\n   res = 1 + (index*(index-1))/2\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be written as internal functions or modules. Since this is a single program, perhaps write it as an internal function.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would be structured as:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n   integer :: max_count, current_count, i, j, k\n\n   integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, start, result\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   allocate(arr(n))\n\n   read(*,*) arr\n\n   max_count = -huge(max_count)\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      do j = i, n\n\n         integer :: brr(n)\n\n         brr = arr\n\n         do k = i, j\n\n            brr(k) = 1 - brr(k)\n\n         end do\n\n         current_count = sum(brr)\n\n         if (current_count > max_count) then\n\n            max_count = current_count\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Handle n=1 case as per original code's check?\n\n   ! Wait, according to the code's original code, when n=1, the code's output is 1 - arr(1). Which is the same as max_count.\n\n   ! So no need for extra check.\n\n   position = max_count\n\n   ! Now compute the second part.\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\n   end do\n\n   start = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n   result = position - start +1\n\n   print*, result\n\ncontains\n\n   integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index*(index-1))/2\n\n   end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first part's loops, the brr array is declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables declared inside a loop are allowed in Fortran 90 and later. So the code inside the loops:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = i, n\n\n      integer :: brr(n)\n\n      brr = arr\n\n      ... \n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside a do loop unless it's in a block. Wait, no, in Fortran 90, you can declare variables inside a block, but loops are not blocks. So the code as written would have a syntax error because the declaration of brr is inside the do loop.\n\nAh, right. So the code must declare brr outside the loops. Alternatively, use an array that is allocated once.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So in the first part's code, the brr array is needed for each i and j. So perhaps declare brr as an array of size n outside the loops.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nallocate(brr(n))  ! Or declare as automatic array.\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, the array arr is already allocated. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), brr(:)\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nallocate(brr(n))\n\nThen, inside the loops:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = i, n\n\n      brr = arr\n\n      do k = i, j\n\n         brr(k) = 1 - brr(k)\n\n      end do\n\n      current_count = sum(brr)\n\n      ... \n\nBut this way, brr is allocated once, and reused each time.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:), brr(:)\n\n   integer :: max_count, current_count, i, j, k\n\n   integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, start, result\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   allocate(arr(n))\n\n   read(*,*) arr\n\n   allocate(brr(n))\n\n   max_count = -huge(max_count)\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      do j = i, n\n\n         brr = arr\n\n         do k = i, j\n\n            brr(k) = 1 - brr(k)\n\n         end do\n\n         current_count = sum(brr)\n\n         if (current_count > max_count) then\n\n            max_count = current_count\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   position = max_count\n\n   ! Now compute the second part.\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\n   end do\n\n   start = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n   result = position - start +1\n\n   print*, result\n\ncontains\n\n   integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index*(index-1))/2\n\n   end function\n\nend program main\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The loops in the first part are O(n^3), which could be slow for large n. But the problem's original code is in Java and presumably expects the same time complexity, so it's acceptable.\n\n- The array indices are 1-based, which matches the Java code's 0-based but adjusted.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So in the loops, for i from 0 to n-1, j from i to n-1. In Fortran, with 1-based arrays, the loops are from 1 to n, which is correct.\n\n- The function getValueAtIndex is correctly implemented.\n\n- The second part's loops are correctly translated.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose first part's input is n=1 and arr[0]=1 (Java's 0-based). In Fortran, arr(1)=1.\n\nThe first part's code would compute max_count as 0 (since flipping gives 0). The second part's position is 0. But wait, the second part's code requires position to be a positive integer. Wait, but in the first part's code, when n=1 and arr is [1], the output is 0, which is passed to the second part. But the second part's code expects a position which is a positive integer. However, the problem's second Java code's input is a long, which can be zero? Or perhaps the problem's first part's output is always positive?\n\nWait, the first part's code's output for n=1 and arr[0]=1 is 0, which would be passed to the second part. But the second part's code may not handle position=0. Let's see:\n\nIn the second part's code, the first loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2. So if position is 0, then 2 < 0 is false, so the first loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2. So 2 <=0 is false. So the second loop doesn't run.\n\nstart = getValueAtIndex(1) =1.\n\nresult =0 -1 +1 =0.\n\nBut the second Java code's input is a long, which can be zero. But the problem's first part's output can be zero, so the second part must handle it.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, when position is 0, the result would be 0. But the second Java code's code may have different behavior. Let me see:\n\nIn the second Java code's solve function:\n\nposition is read as a long. Suppose position is 0.\n\nThe first loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2. Since 2 <0 is false, the first loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(1+1)=getValueAtIndex(2)=2. 2 <=0 is false. So the second loop doesn't run.\n\nstart = getValueAtIndex(1)=1.\n\nresult =0-1+1=0.\n\nSo the code would output 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles it.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst part input n=2, arr [0,1].\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nPossible subarrays:\n\ni=1, j=1: flip first element \u2192 [1,1]. count is 2.\n\ni=1, j=2: flip both \u2192 [1,0]. count is 1.\n\ni=2, j=2: flip second \u2192 [0,0]. count 0.\n\nThe maximum is 2.\n\nSo the second part's position is 2.\n\nSecond part's code:\n\nposition=2.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\ngetValueAtIndex(2) is 2. So 2 <2 is false. So first loop doesn't run.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck getValueAtIndex(2) =2. 2 <=2 \u2192 yes. So increment nrstSeqStartIndx to 2.\n\nNow check again: getValueAtIndex(3) is 4. 4 <=2? No. So stop.\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nstart = getValueAtIndex(2)=2.\n\nresult =2-2+1=1.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe second Java code's code for position=2 would output 1.\n\nYes, because the sequence starts at 1 (index 1), then 2 (index 2). So position 2 is the second element in the second block (index 2's start is 2, so 2-2+1=1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
