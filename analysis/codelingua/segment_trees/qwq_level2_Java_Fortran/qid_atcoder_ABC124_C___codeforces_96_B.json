So in Fortran terms, for each i from len(x) downto 2 (since i starts at len(x)-1, but in Fortran, perhaps better to loop from len(x) down to 2?), but let me see: Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C) reads a string input, then processes it in two ways. The first processing counts the number of changes needed so that no two consecutive characters are the same, by flipping the current character if it's the same as the previous. The second processing does a similar thing but starts from the end, flipping the previous character instead. Then it outputs the minimum of the two counts.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_96_B) reads a number, then finds the smallest number composed of 4's and 7's (in binary form, but converted) that is greater than or equal to the input. Wait, actually, looking at the code again, the approach is a bit different. Let me see:\n\nThe second program starts with a mask starting at 2. It converts mask to binary, takes substring from index 1 (so removing the first character?), then checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, it replaces 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, converts to a number, and keeps track of the smallest such number that is >= the input. Wait, but the loop condition is while value < number, so it increments mask until the value is at least the input. Then it prints the value. Hmm, but the loop might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the loop is: while value < number, so mask starts at 2, then increments. The code inside the loop calculates s as the binary of mask, but substring(1) which removes the first character. Then, it checks if the number of zeros is equal to the number of 1s (since zeros != (length - zeros) would mean they are not equal, so continue). So only when zeros equal the number of 1s (so total even length?), then proceed. Then replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, making a string of 4 and 7, then parse as a long. The value is stored, and the loop continues until value is >= number. But the ans is set to -1 initially, but the code just updates value each time. Wait, actually, the code might have a problem here. Because the loop runs while value < number, so once value is >=, it breaks, and then prints the value. But the way the loop is structured, the first value that meets the condition and is >= the input would be the one printed. Because once the value is >=, the loop stops, so the last value is the one that is the first such number. Wait, but the loop is structured as:\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nmask starts at 2, then mask increments each time. The loop is while value < number. So inside the loop, they process the mask's binary (substring 1?), check if zeros equal the count of 1s. If so, compute the value. But the value is being overwritten each time. So the loop continues until the value is >= number. But the first time the value is >=, the loop stops, and the value is printed. So the code is trying to find the first such number (starting from mask=2 upwards) where the binary (without first character) has equal 0s and 1s, and when converted to 4 and 7, the number is at least the input. The first such number found is the one printed. \n\nWait, but the loop is structured as:\n\nwhile (value < number) { ... }\n\nWait, no, the loop is while (value < number), so the loop continues as long as value is less than the input. So inside the loop, they process the current mask, and compute the value. But if the current value is >= the input, then the loop stops. So the first time the value is >= the input, the loop breaks, and the value is printed. So the code is looking for the first such number (in the sequence of masks) that meets the condition and is >= the input. \n\nHmm, okay. So the first program's output is the minimum between a1 and a2, which is an integer. Then that integer is the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a number as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the entire sequence is: take the input string, process it with the first program to get a number, then that number is the input to the second program, which outputs the desired value.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the string for the first program), process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. The key is to have the first part process the string, compute the min(a1,a2), then use that as the input to the second part's logic, and output the result of the second part.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n2. Process the first part (the first Java program's logic) to compute the minimum count.\n3. Use that count as the input to the second part (the second Java program's logic).\n4. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, let's tackle each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first program takes a string x. Then:\n\n- For the first approach (a1):\n   - Start from the second character to the end.\n   - For each position i, if current char is same as previous, flip it (1 to 0 or 0 to 1), and increment a1.\n\nWait, the code in Java does this:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n        if (a.charAt(i) == '1') set to '0', else '1';\n        a1++;\n    }\n}\n\nSo a is a copy of x. Then, for each i from 1 to end, check if current and previous are same. If so, flip the current character (i-th) to the opposite, and count a1.\n\nWait, the code is modifying the a string. So the process is: starting from the first character, when moving forward, whenever two consecutive are same, flip the latter. The count a1 is the number of flips needed so that no two consecutive are same, by flipping the latter each time.\n\nSimilarly, for a2, the code processes the string from the end backwards. The code for a2 is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--) {\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n        if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to '0', else '1';\n        a2++;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, here, they check if the current and previous are same. Then, they flip the previous (i-1)th character. So in this case, when moving backward, whenever two consecutive are same, flip the previous (i-1)th character. The count a2 is the number of flips needed here.\n\nThe minimum of a1 and a2 is printed.\n\nSo the first part's output is the minimum between a1 and a2.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, read the input string. Let's say the input is a string of '0's and '1's. Let's read it as a character array.\n\nThen, compute a1 and a2.\n\nFor a1:\n\nInitialize a copy of the string (since in Java they have a and b as copies). In Fortran, perhaps we can work with arrays.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables:\n\nSuppose the input string is stored in a character array, say, x(:).\n\nTo compute a1:\n\nWe can make a copy of x, say, a(:). Then loop from i=2 to len (since Fortran is 1-based?), and check if a(i) == a(i-1). If so, flip it and increment a1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, indices start at 1. So for a string of length n, indices 1 to n.\n\nSo for a1:\n\na1 = 0\n\na = x (copy the array)\n\ndo i = 2, len(x)\n    if (a(i) == a(i-1)) then\n        if (a(i) == '1') then\n            a(i) = '0'\n        else\n            a(i) = '1'\n        end if\n        a1 = a1 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nSimilarly for a2:\n\na2 =0\n\nb = x\n\ndo i = len(x)-1, 1, -1\n    if (b(i) == b(i+1)) then\n        if (b(i) == '1') then\n            b(i) = '0'\n        else\n            b(i) = '1'\n        end if\n        a2 = a2 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, in the Java code for a2, the loop is from i = x.length()-1 downto 1 (since i>0). So for each i from the end down to 1, check if b at i and i-1 are same. Wait, no, in the Java code for a2, the loop is for i from x.length()-1 downto 1 (since i starts at x.length()-1 and goes down to 1). The condition is if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)), then flip the (i-1)th character. Wait, in the code:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n    if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to '0', else '1';\n    a2++;\n}\n\nWait, so when the current and previous are same, they flip the previous (i-1)th character. So in Fortran terms, for each i from len(x) downto 2 (since i starts at len(x)-1, but in Fortran, perhaps better to loop from len(x) down to 2?), but let me see:\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = x.length()-1; i>0; i--). So i starts at x.length()-1 (the last index), then goes down to 1 (since i>0). So for each i from N-1 down to 1 (assuming N is the length). The check is between i and i-1. So in Fortran, the loop would be from i = N downto 2 (since in Fortran, indices start at 1, so the last index is N). Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the length is N. The Java loop runs i from N-1 down to 1 (since i starts at N-1, and i>0). So in Fortran, the equivalent would be i from N-1 down to 1, but in Fortran indices, the last element is N. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So for a string of length N, the indices are 0 to N-1. So in the a2 loop, the Java code starts at i = N-1 (the last character) and goes down to 1 (so i=1 is the second character). So in Fortran, which is 1-based, the equivalent indices would be from N down to 2 (since the first character is 1, last is N). So the loop in Fortran for a2 would be:\n\ndo i = N, 2, -1\n\nThen, check if b(i) == b(i-1). If so, flip the (i-1)th character.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when they find that the current (i) and previous (i-1) are same, they flip the previous (i-1)th character. So in Fortran, for each i from N downto 2:\n\nif (b(i) == b(i-1)) then\n\n    if (b(i-1) == '1') then\n        b(i-1) = '0'\n    else\n        b(i-1) = '1'\n    end if\n    a2 = a2 +1\nend if\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo after computing a1 and a2, the first part's result is min(a1,a2). So that's the value that will be used as input to the second program.\n\nNow, moving to the second part (the second Java program):\n\nThe second program takes a number (the input from the first program's output) and finds the minimal number composed of 4 and 7 digits (in a certain way) that is >= the input.\n\nThe Java code's logic is as follows:\n\nInitialize mask starting at 2. Then, for each mask, convert it to binary, take substring starting at index 1 (so removing the first character?), then check if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, then parse as a long. The first such value that is >= the input is printed.\n\nWait, let me re-express the steps:\n\nThe mask starts at 2. The loop runs while the current value (from the processing) is less than the input number. The loop increments mask each time. The first time the value is >= the input, it breaks and outputs that value.\n\nWait, but the loop is structured as:\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nmask starts at 2 (initially mask is 2?), then mask increments each time.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nmask starts at 2, then mask is incremented each time (mask++). \n\nThe code does:\n\nString s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask).substring(1);\n\nWait, the binary string of mask (as an integer) is converted to a string, then substring(1) takes from index 1 (so excluding the first character). \n\nWait, for example, if mask is 2 (binary is 10), then substring(1) is \"0\".\n\nmask=3 (binary 11 \u2192 substring(1) is \"1\").\n\nmask=4 (binary 100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\").\n\nmask=5 \u2192 101 \u2192 substring(1) is \"01\".\n\nSo the substring removes the first character of the binary representation. \n\nThen, the code counts the number of '0's in s. If the number of 0s is equal to the number of 1s (since zeros != (length - zeros) \u2192 if they are equal, then zeros == (length - zeros) \u2192 so the condition is checking if they are not equal, so continue. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue;\n\nSo if the number of zeros is not equal to the number of 1s (since s.length() is the total, so zeros + ones = length \u2192 so if zeros != ones, then continue. So only when zeros == ones, proceed.\n\nSo the substring must have an even length, since zeros = ones \u2192 total length even.\n\nThen, the string s is replaced: 0 becomes 4, 1 becomes 7. So the resulting string is made of 4 and 7, with equal number of each? Because the original s had equal 0 and 1.\n\nThen, the value is parsed as a long. \n\nThe loop continues until the value is >= the input number. The first such value is printed.\n\nWait, but the loop is while (value < number). Wait, the loop condition is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as the current value is less than the input. But how is value being updated?\n\nWait, the code inside the loop is:\n\nvalue is initially 0. Then, for each mask, they compute s, check if the zeros and ones are equal. If so, then compute the value as the parsed s (after replacement). But the code overwrites value each time. So the first time a valid s is found (with equal 0 and 1 counts), the value is set to the parsed number. If that value is less than the input, the loop continues. The next masks are tried. The loop continues until the value (from the current mask's processing) is >= the input. Then, the loop breaks, and the value is printed.\n\nWait, but the loop is structured as:\n\nwhile (value < number) { ... }\n\nWait, no, the loop is while (value < number). So the loop runs as long as value is less than the input. So inside the loop, they process the mask, and compute the value. But if the current mask's processing gives a value that is >= the input, then the loop will exit, and the value is printed. \n\nWait, but the code is:\n\nmask starts at 2, then increments each time. The loop runs while value < number. So the first time the value is computed (from mask=2), if that value is >= number, then the loop stops, and the value is printed. \n\nBut the problem is that the code may not have found a valid s (i.e., the substring has equal 0 and 1 counts). In that case, the code skips (continue) and proceeds to the next mask. So the loop continues until a valid s is found where the value is >= the input. \n\nTherefore, the code is looking for the first mask (starting from 2) where the binary (after substring) has equal 0 and 1 counts, and the converted number is at least the input. The first such number is printed.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nThe second part's input is the min(a1,a2) from the first part. Let's call this input_num.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number composed of 4 and 7 digits (in the way described) that is >= input_num.\n\nThe steps in Fortran would be:\n\nInitialize mask starting at 2. \n\nLoop:\n\n   Convert mask to binary string, then take substring starting at the second character (since in Java it was substring(1), which is 0-based, so in Fortran, which is 1-based, the substring would be from 2 to end).\n\n   Check if the number of '0's equals the number of '1's in this substring.\n\n   If yes:\n\n       replace '0's with '4's and '1's with '7's.\n\n       convert this string to a number (value).\n\n       if value >= input_num, then return this value.\n\n   increment mask and repeat.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to handle the binary conversion and string manipulation?\n\nFirst, converting an integer to its binary string. In Fortran, we can use the intrinsic function to get the binary, but perhaps we need to write a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the binary digits manually.\n\nAlternatively, use the BEDIT function or other methods, but perhaps it's easier to write a loop to get the binary digits.\n\nAlternatively, for a given mask, we can compute its binary representation as a string.\n\nLet me think of steps for the second part:\n\nInitialize mask = 2\n\nLoop:\n\n   Convert mask to binary string (without leading zeros?), then take substring from position 2 (since in Java it was substring(1), which skips the first character).\n\n   Let s be this substring.\n\n   Check if the length of s is even (since 0s and 1s must be equal, so length must be even).\n\n   If not even, skip.\n\n   Else, count the number of '0's and '1's in s. If they are equal:\n\n       create a new string where '0' becomes '4', '1' becomes '7'.\n\n       convert this string to a number (value).\n\n       if value >= input_num, then output this value and exit.\n\n   increment mask by 1.\n\nProceed until found.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the mask is incremented each time, even if the current mask's processing didn't yield a valid s. So the loop continues until a valid s is found where the value is >= input_num.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nRead the input_num (from first part's result).\n\nInitialize mask = 2\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   compute the binary string of mask, then substring from 2nd character.\n\n   if the substring is empty (mask=1?), but mask starts at 2, so mask=2's binary is '10', substring from 2 is '0'.\n\n   check if the length is even.\n\n   if not even, skip.\n\n   else count zeros and ones.\n\n   if zeros == ones:\n\n       create the 4/7 string.\n\n       convert to value.\n\n       if value >= input_num, then return this value.\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to handle the binary conversion?\n\nLet me think of a function to get the binary string of a number.\n\nFunction to get binary string of an integer:\n\nsubroutine int_to_bin(n, bin_str)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    character(len=*), intent(out) :: bin_str\n    integer :: i, len\n    bin_str = ''\n    if (n ==0) then\n        bin_str = '0'\n        return\n    end if\n    do i = 0, 31  ! assuming 32-bit integer\n        bin_str = char(mod(n,2)+48) // bin_str\n        n = n /2\n        if (n ==0) exit\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but this would give the binary digits in reverse order. Wait, no, because each step appends the remainder (mod(n,2)) to the left. Let me see:\n\nSuppose n=2 (binary 10):\n\nFirst iteration: mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 bin_str becomes '0'\n\nn becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration: mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10'\n\nn becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo the function returns '10', which is correct.\n\nSo this function would return the correct binary string.\n\nThen, the substring from position 2 (since in Java it was substring(1), which is 0-based, so in Fortran's 1-based, it's from 2 to end).\n\nSo after getting the binary string, we can take s = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str)).\n\nThen, check if the length of s is even.\n\nIf not, skip.\n\nElse, count the number of '0's and '1's.\n\nIf equal, proceed.\n\nThen, replace each '0' with '4', '1' with '7', forming a new string.\n\nConvert that string to a number (value).\n\nCompare with input_num.\n\nOnce found, output that value.\n\nNow, in Fortran, converting the string to a number can be done with the internal read statement.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, the entire Fortran program must read the initial input string, process it through the first part, compute the min(a1,a2), then use that as input_num for the second part's processing, then output the result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a string from stdin, we can use read(*,*) or read(*,'(A)').\n\nBut to read a line, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut need to trim trailing spaces, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to read until end of line.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to read the entire line.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that the input is a single line with the string, and read it as a character array.\n\nWait, perhaps better to read the entire line into a character variable.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nThen process it to compute a1 and a2.\n\nLet me code the first part.\n\nFirst, the input string is stored in a character array.\n\nSuppose the input_str is read as a string, then we can get its length with len_trim.\n\nLet n = len_trim(input_str)\n\nallocate a character array of length n.\n\nx = input_str(1:n)\n\nThen, compute a1 and a2.\n\nFor a1:\n\na1 =0\n\na = x\n\ndo i = 2, n\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for a2:\n\na2 =0\n\nb = x\n\ndo i = n, 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the result is min(a1, a2).\n\nNow, the second part takes this min_val as input_num.\n\nThen, the second part's loop:\n\nmask =2\n\ndo\n\n   call int_to_bin(mask, bin_str)\n\n   s = bin_str(2: len_trim(bin_str))\n\n   if (len_trim(s) ==0) then\n\n       mask = mask +1\n\n       cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n   if (mod(len_s,2) /=0) then\n\n       mask = mask +1\n\n       cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   zeros =0\n\n   ones =0\n\n   do i=1, len_s\n\n       if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n           zeros = zeros +1\n\n       else\n\n           ones = ones +1\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (zeros /= ones) then\n\n       mask = mask +1\n\n       cycle\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now, create the 4/7 string\n\n   temp_str = s\n\n   do i=1, len_s\n\n       if (temp_str(i:i) == '0') then\n\n           temp_str(i:i) = '4'\n\n       else\n\n           temp_str(i:i) = '7'\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! convert to value\n\n   read(temp_str,*) value\n\n   if (value >= input_num) then\n\n       write(*,*) value\n\n       stop\n\n   end if\n\n   mask = mask +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop is an infinite loop, and we break when the condition is met.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut first, the int_to_bin function needs to be defined.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be written as subroutines. Let me write a subroutine to convert an integer to its binary string.\n\nHere's the code for the subroutine:\n\nsubroutine int_to_bin(n, bin_str)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    character(len=*), intent(out) :: bin_str\n    integer :: i, len\n    bin_str = ''\n    if (n ==0) then\n        bin_str = '0'\n        return\n    end if\n    do i = 0, 31  ! assuming 32-bit integer\n        bin_str = char(mod(n,2) + 48) // trim(bin_str)\n        n = n /2\n        if (n ==0) exit\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation is done with //, and the 'trim' is needed to avoid trailing spaces.\n\nWait, the initial bin_str is an empty string. Then, each iteration appends the mod result (as a character) to the left.\n\nWait, let's see for n=2:\n\nFirst iteration: mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 bin_str becomes '0' // previous (empty) \u2192 '0'\n\nn becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration: mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str becomes '1' // '0' \u2192 '10'\n\nn becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo the result is '10', which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3 \u2192 binary '11'\n\nFirst iteration: mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str is '1'\n\nn=1.\n\nSecond iteration: mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 bin_str becomes '1'// '1' \u2192 '11'\n\nn becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo that works.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100) :: input_str\n    integer :: n, a1, a2, min_val, mask, value, zeros, ones, len_s, i\n    character(len=100) :: x, a, b, bin_str, s, temp_str\n\n    !

Need to ensure that the input string is not longer than 100. But since the original Java code uses a string, perhaps the input can be up to some length. But in Fortran, the length can be adjusted as needed. Alternatively, use a larger length, like 1000.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter. But for the problem's constraints, perhaps 100 is sufficient.\n\nAnother thing: in the second part, when converting the temp_str to value, the read statement may have issues if the string is too long. But assuming that the input_num is not too big, and the mask is manageable.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's input is 0. The second program would look for the first mask where the converted value is >=0. The first valid mask would be mask=2 (binary '10', substring '0' \u2192 length 1 (odd \u2192 skip). Next mask=3 (binary '11 \u2192 substring '1' \u2192 length 1 \u2192 skip. mask=4 \u2192 binary '100 \u2192 substring '00 \u2192 length 2. zeros=2, ones=0 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skip. mask=5 \u2192 '101 \u2192 substring '01 \u2192 zeros=1, ones=1 \u2192 equal. So s is '01 \u2192 becomes '47 \u2192 value 47. Since 47 >=0 \u2192 output 47.\n\nWait, but the input_num is 0, so the first valid value is 47. So the code would output 47.\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 1. The second program would look for the first value >=1. The first valid is 47 (as above).\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 47. Then the code would find the first value >=47. The first valid is 47 itself.\n\nAnother case: input to second part is 47. The first valid is 47, so output is 47.\n\nAnother case: input to second part is 48. Then the next mask after 5 (which gives 47) is mask=6 (binary 110 \u2192 substring '10 \u2192 length 2. zeros=1, ones=1 \u2192 yes. s is '10 \u2192 becomes '74 \u2192 value 74. 74 >=48 \u2192 output 74.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The binary string conversion may have leading zeros? No, because the function appends the remainder each time, so leading zeros are not present except for n=0.\n\nWait, for mask=2, the binary is '10', so substring is '0', which is length 1 (odd \u2192 skipped).\n\nmask=6 \u2192 binary '110 \u2192 substring is '10 \u2192 length 2 \u2192 okay.\n\nmask=7 \u2192 binary '111 \u2192 substring '11 \u2192 length 2 \u2192 zeros=0, ones=2 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=9 \u2192 binary '1001 \u2192 substring '001 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=10 \u2192 binary '1010 \u2192 substring '010 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=12 \u2192 binary '1100 \u2192 substring '100 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=14 \u2192 binary '1110 \u2192 substring '110 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=15 \u2192 binary '1111 \u2192 substring '111 \u2192 length 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=16 \u2192 binary '10000 \u2192 substring '0000 \u2192 length 4 \u2192 zeros=3, ones=1 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skipped.\n\nmask=17 \u2192 binary '10001 \u2192 substring '0001 \u2192 zeros=3, ones=1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=18 \u2192 '10010 \u2192 substring '0010 \u2192 zeros=3, ones=1 \u2192 no.\n\nmask=19 \u2192 '10011 \u2192 substring '0011 \u2192 zeros=2, ones=2 \u2192 yes. s is '0011 \u2192 becomes '4477 \u2192 value 4477. But mask=19's binary is 10011 \u2192 substring is '0011 \u2192 length 4. zeros=2, ones=2 \u2192 yes. So the value is 4477. But maybe there's a smaller mask that I missed.\n\nWait, mask= 6 gives 74, which is smaller than 4477. So for input_num=48, the correct output is 74.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's loop, the mask starts at 2, and increments each time. The loop is infinite until a valid value is found. Since the problem's constraints likely ensure that such a value exists, the loop will terminate.\n\nAnother possible issue is the length of the temp_str when converting to value. For very large numbers, the read statement may have issues, but in practice, the mask won't be too large because the problem's constraints probably limit the input.\n\nNow, compiling and testing this code would be needed, but given the problem's constraints, this should work.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as written above."
