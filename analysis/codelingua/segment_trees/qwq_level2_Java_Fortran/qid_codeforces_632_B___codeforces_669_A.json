    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_632_B). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers, then a string s. Then it calculates some sum based on the 'B's in the string, and then does two passes over the string to compute a maximum value. The final answer is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n and then outputs a value based on dividing by 3 and some formula. Wait, but the problem says the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but looking at the first program's output, it's the 'ans' which is a long. The second program takes an integer n as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second program's n?\n\nWait, but the second program's main method reads n via BufferedReader, so the first program's output must be the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the entire sequence is: run first program, take its output, use that as the input to the second program. So the combined Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process both steps, and output the result of the second step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program, process it through both steps, and then output the result of the second step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, array a, string s (from first Java program's input).\n2. Compute the 'ans' from the first Java program.\n3. Take that ans as the input to the second Java program's n.\n4. Compute the result of the second program (which is (n//3)*2 + 1 if n mod 3 !=0 else 0? Wait let me check the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code's solve function:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n    System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n}\n\nSo for example, if n is 5: 5/3 is 1, 5%3 is 2, so 1*2 +1 =3. Wait, but the formula is (n//3)*2 plus 1 if remainder is not zero. Wait, the code is (n/3)*2 + (if n%3 !=0 then 1 else 0). So for n mod3 ==0, add 0, else add 1. So the total is floor(n/3)*2 + (1 if remainder exists, else 0). So for n=3, it's 2*1 +0=2. For n=4, 1*2 +1=3. For n=5, 1*2+1=3. For n=6, 2*2 +0=4.\n\nSo the second program's output is based on the first program's output as its input n.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (n, array a, string s).\n- Compute the first program's 'ans' value.\n- Then compute the second program's result using that ans as n.\n- Output the second program's result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\nRead n, then n integers into array a, then a string s.\n\nThen compute sum as sum of a[i] where s's characters are 'B' at position i. Wait, but the loop is for i from 0 to s.length()-1, so the indices are 0-based. But in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in Java, the array a has size n, and the string s's length can be different? Wait, in the first Java code, the array a is of size n, but the string s can be of any length? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait in the first Java code, the loop for the sum is over s.length(), but the array a is of size n. So if the string's length is different from n, then the code would have an out-of-bounds error. But the problem probably assumes that the input is correct, so the string's length is equal to n. Because otherwise the code would crash. So in the problem's context, the input must have the string s of length n. So in the Fortran code, we can assume that the string's length is n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead n, then n integers into an array (size n), then read a string of length n.\n\nThen compute sum as sum of a(i) where s(i) is 'B' (since in Java, the loop is over s's length, and for each i from 0 to len-1, check if s.charAt(i) is 'B', then add a[i]. So in Fortran, the indices would be 1-based, so for i from 1 to n, check if s(i) is 'B', then add a(i).\n\nWait, but in Java, the array a is of size n, and the loop for a[i] is from 0 to n-1. The string s's length can be any, but in the problem's context, it's n. So in Fortran, the array a will be 1-based, so a(1) to a(n). The string s is a character array of length n, so s(1) to s(n).\n\nThen, the sum is initialized to 0, then for each i from 1 to n, if s(i) is 'B', add a(i) to sum.\n\nThen, the ans is initially sum. Then, sum1 is set to sum, and then we loop over each character in s from first to last (i from 1 to n). For each i:\n\nif s(i) is 'A', add a(i) to sum1.\n\nelse (it's 'B'), subtract a(i) from sum1.\n\nThen, ans is the maximum between ans and sum1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first loop after the initial sum is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the array a is of size n, and the string s's length is n. So the loop is over all characters. But in the first part (sum), the 'B's contribute to the initial sum, but in this loop, for each character, if it's 'A', add a[i], else subtract a[i]. Wait, but the original sum was sum of B's. So this loop is modifying sum1 (starting from sum) by adding a[i] when 'A', subtracting when 'B'? Because the code says:\n\nif (ch == 'B') sum += a[i]; in the first loop (sum is sum of B's). Then, in the first for loop after, the code is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i]\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i]\n\n    ans = max(ans, sum1)\n\n}\n\nWait, so for each character in s, in order, the code is processing the 'A' and 'B' as follows: for 'A', add a[i], for 'B', subtract a[i]. So the sum1 starts at sum (sum of B's). Then, for each step, the current character's effect is applied. The idea is to track the maximum possible value along the way.\n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is trying to find the maximum possible value by considering inserting 'A's and 'B's in some way. Not sure, but the code is as written.\n\nThen, after that first loop, they reset sum1 to sum again, and do a backward loop from the end to the start, doing the same thing but in reverse, and again tracking the maximum.\n\nSo the Fortran code must replicate all that.\n\nNow, the second part is taking the ans from the first part, then compute the second program's result.\n\nThe second program's code is straightforward: given n, output (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0).\n\nSo in Fortran, once we have the ans from the first part, we can compute that.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input:\n\nRead n, then n integers, then a string of length n.\n\nIn Fortran, reading the string can be done with a character array of length n.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading strings can be a bit tricky. Since the input for the first program's string is read via Scanner's next(), which reads the next token. But in the problem's context, the input for the first Java program is probably given as the n, then the array elements, then the string s as the next token (so perhaps the string is on the same line as the array, or on the next line). But the exact input format is important.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program reads n, then the array a via nextInt() n times, then reads the string s via sc.next(). So the input for the first program is:\n\nFirst line: n\n\nSecond line: n integers separated by spaces.\n\nThird line: the string s (as a single token, so perhaps it's on its own line, or after the integers but as a separate token. But in Java's Scanner, next() would read the next token, so if the array is read with nextInt() n times, then the next token is the string s, which could be on the same line or next line. But the exact input format is not specified here, but in the problem's context, the user would input the data accordingly.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the input correctly, we need to read n, then the array, then the string. Assuming that after the n integers, the next token is the string s. So perhaps the input is structured as:\n\nn\n\na1 a2 ... an\n\ns\n\nBut in Fortran, reading the string can be done with a read statement. Let's think of the input as:\n\nFirst line: n\n\nSecond line: the n integers separated by spaces.\n\nThird line: the string s (exactly n characters long).\n\nAlternatively, the string could be on the same line as the integers, but the code uses sc.next() which would read the next token. So perhaps the string is on the same line as the array, but after the integers. For example:\n\nn\n\na1 a2 ... an s\n\nBut in that case, the nextInt() would read the array elements, and then sc.next() would read the s as the next token. So the s is a single token, which must be exactly n characters long.\n\nIn Fortran, to read the string, perhaps we can read it as a single line, but ensuring that it's exactly n characters. Alternatively, read it as a character array of length n.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the array a (size n).\n\nRead the string s (length n).\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s\n\ninteger :: sum, ans, sum1\n\ninteger :: second_result\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n), s(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nWait, but reading the string s as a character array of length n may require a format. Alternatively, read the entire line into a string and then split into characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read the string as a single string variable, then split into individual characters.\n\nAlternatively, using a character array:\n\nSuppose the third input line is the string s of exactly n characters. So:\n\nread(*, '(a)') (s(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of the syntax.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line into a character variable of length n, then assign each character to s array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\nthen s_str is a string of length n, then s(1:n) = s_str(1:n)\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\ns = [ character(len=1) :: (s_str(i:i), i=1,n) ]\n\nBut I need to be careful with the exact syntax.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to read the string as a single string, then loop through each character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third read can be:\n\nread(*, '(a)') (s(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's valid. Let me check.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a character array, you can do:\n\nread(*, '(100a1)') s(1:100)\n\nBut here n is variable. So perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\nthen s_str is a string, and then assign each character to s array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to read the entire line into a string, then loop through each character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for the string is given as a single line with exactly n characters, so:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\nthen s_str is a string of length n, and then:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, strings can be a bit tricky. Let me think of code steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third read is:\n\nread(*, '(a)') (s(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's allowed. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third read is:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\nthen s_str is a string, and then:\n\ns = transfer(s_str, s)\n\nBut that might not work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to read the string as a single string, then loop through each character.\n\nLet me proceed with code steps.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read the array a.\n\nThen read the string s_str as a single string, then loop through each character.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(s(n))\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nBut need to ensure that s_str is exactly n characters long. Otherwise, it's an error. But according to the problem's input, it should be.\n\nNow, moving on to compute the first part's sum and ans.\n\nInitialize sum =0\n\ndo i =1 to n\n\n   if s(i) == 'B' then sum = sum + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nans = sum\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nthen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\n   if s(i) == 'A' then sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   ans = max(ans, sum1)\n\nthen loop over i from n down to 1:\n\n   if s(i) == 'A' then sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   ans = max(ans, sum1)\n\nWait, but in the second loop (the backward one), the code in Java does:\n\nsum1 is reset to sum again before the backward loop.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nsum1 = sum;\n\nfor (int i = s.length() - 1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the first backward loop, the code is:\n\nsum1 is set to sum again before the backward loop.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nAfter the first forward loop (the one that goes from 0 to length-1), the code does:\n\nsum1 = sum;\n\nthen loops backward.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter the first forward loop (the one that processes the forward pass), we need to reset sum1 to sum again, then process the backward loop.\n\nWait, let me recheck the Java code's steps:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nsum = initial sum of B's.\n\nans = sum.\n\nsum1 = sum.\n\nThen first loop (forward):\n\nfor each i from 0 to len-1:\n\n   if A, add a[i], else subtract a[i]\n\n   update ans.\n\nThen, sum1 is set to sum again.\n\nThen the backward loop:\n\nfor i from len-1 downto 0:\n\n   if A, add a[i], else subtract a[i]\n\n   update ans.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter the first forward loop (the one that does the first pass), we have to do the backward loop.\n\nWait, the first forward loop is the one after the initial sum:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nfor i from 1 to n (since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran 1-based):\n\nWait, in Java's first loop after the initial sum:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is from i=1 to n (since s has length n).\n\nThen, after that, sum1 is set to sum again, and then the backward loop from i =n downto 1.\n\nWait, in Java's backward loop:\n\nfor (int i = s.length()-1; i >=0; i--)\n\nso in Fortran, that's i from n down to 1.\n\nSo the code steps in Fortran:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (s(i) == 'B') sum = sum + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nans = sum\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (s(i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i =n, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\nThen, after that, compute the second part's result.\n\nThe second part's input is the ans from the first part. So the second program's n is ans.\n\nThe second program's formula is (n /3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with negative numbers, but since n is a positive integer (as per problem's input?), so:\n\nsecond_result = (ans /3)*2\n\nif mod(ans,3) /=0 then second_result = second_result +1\n\nSo:\n\nsecond_result = (ans /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(ans,3) /=0 )\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsecond_result = (ans /3)*2\n\nif (mod(ans,3) .ne. 0) second_result = second_result +1\n\nThen, print second_result.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nWe need to declare variables properly. Since the first program's ans can be a large number (since a[i] can be up to... well, in Java it's int, but in Fortran, integers can be 4 bytes, but perhaps we need to use integer*8 or something. Wait, but the problem's constraints may not require that. Let me see the first Java code uses long for sum and ans, so in Fortran, we need to use 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, we can use integer(8) variables for sum, ans, sum1.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\n\ninteger(8) :: sum, ans, sum1, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s_str\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n), s(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*, '(a)') s_str\n\n! Assign s_str to s array\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute first part\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (s(i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nans = sum\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (s(i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i =n, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\n! Compute second part\n\nsecond_result = (ans /3)*2\n\nif (mod(ans,3) /=0) second_result = second_result +1\n\n! Output the result\n\nprint*, second_result\n\ndeallocate(a, s)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the read for the string may have issues. The line read(*, '(a)') s_str may read the entire line, but if the string is longer than the allocated length, but in our case, s_str is a deferred-length character variable. Wait, in Fortran 2003, we can have allocatable character variables with deferred length. But in the code above, s_str is declared as allocatable, but not allocated. Wait, no, in the code above, s_str is declared as character(len=:), allocatable, but when we read into it with read(*, '(a)') s_str, it should automatically allocate to the correct length.\n\nWait, but in some compilers, you might need to use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps using a fixed length, but that's not safe. Alternatively, using a large enough length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nallocate(character(len=1000) :: s_str)\n\nBut then read the line into s_str, then take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is okay as written.\n\nAnother thing: in the first loop for reading the array a, the read statement is read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n). That should work, as it reads the next n integers.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose n=3, a = [1,2,3], s = \"BAB\".\n\nFirst part:\n\nsum is B's: positions 1 and 3 (since s(1) is 'B', s(2) 'A', s(3) 'B'. So sum is 1+3 =4.\n\nThen first forward loop:\n\nsum1 starts at 4.\n\ni=1: s(1) is 'B', so subtract a(1) (since in the code, if 'A' add, else subtract). Wait, in the code:\n\nif (s(i) == 'A') then add a(i), else subtract.\n\nSo for 'B', subtract a(i).\n\nWait, in the first forward loop:\n\nAt i=1 (s is 'B'), so subtract a(1) (1) \u2192 sum1 becomes 4-1=3. ans is max(4,3) \u2192 remains 4.\n\ni=2: s is 'A', so add a(2)=2 \u2192 sum1 becomes 3+2=5. ans is now 5.\n\ni=3: s is 'B', subtract a(3)=3 \u2192 sum1 5-3=2. ans remains 5.\n\nThen, after first loop, ans is 5.\n\nThen reset sum1 to 4, and do backward loop from 3 downto 1.\n\ni=3: s is 'B', subtract a(3)=3 \u2192 sum1 =4-3=1. ans remains 5.\n\ni=2: s is 'A', add a(2)=2 \u2192 sum1 1+2=3. ans still 5.\n\ni=1: s is 'B', subtract a(1)=1 \u2192 sum1 3-1=2. ans still 5.\n\nSo the final ans is 5.\n\nThen the second part: 5 divided by 3 is 1, so 1*2 +1 (since 5 mod3 is 2\u22600) \u2192 3.\n\nSo the output is 3.\n\nTesting with the Java code:\n\nFirst program's output is 5, then second program takes 5 and outputs 3. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, s is \"AAA\".\n\nsum is 0 (no B's).\n\nFirst forward loop:\n\nsum1 starts at 0.\n\ni=1: 'A' \u2192 add a(1). Suppose a is [1,2,3]. So sum1 becomes 1. ans is 1.\n\ni=2: add 2 \u2192 sum1 3 \u2192 ans 3.\n\ni=3: add 3 \u2192 sum1 6 \u2192 ans 6.\n\nThen backward loop:\n\nsum1 reset to 0.\n\ni=3: 'A' \u2192 add 3 \u2192 sum1 3. ans is 6 vs 3 \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: add 2 \u2192 sum1 5 \u2192 still 6.\n\ni=1: add 1 \u2192 sum1 6 \u2192 ans remains 6.\n\nSo ans is 6. Then second part: 6/3=2 \u2192 2*2 +0 \u21924. So output 4.\n\nWhich matches the formula.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables for sum, ans, etc. need to be 64-bit integers because the Java code uses long. So in Fortran, using integer(8) is correct.\n\nAlso, the string reading part must be handled properly. The code uses a deferred-length character variable s_str, which should be allocated automatically when reading. So the code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the backward loop, the indices go from n down to 1. The code uses do i =n,1,-1, which is correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as written above."
