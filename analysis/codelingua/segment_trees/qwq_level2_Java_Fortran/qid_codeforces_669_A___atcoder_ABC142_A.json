Another example: a=2.6 \u2192 2.6+0.5=3.1 \u2192 int(3.1)=3 \u2192 which is correct (Math.round(2.6)=3). So the formula works for all cases except when the value is negative, but since input_val is positive (as it's the output of the first program, which is an integer derived from n, which is read as an integer, presumably positive?), then this formula is okay. Therefore, the code with countOdd = int( (input_val/2.0d0) +0.5d0 ) is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file, codeforces_669_A. It reads an integer n from input, then calls solve(n). The solve function calculates (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2, plus 1 if n mod 3 is not zero, else 0. So the output is the number of times you can have at least two per group or something like that. The formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n%3 !=0 else 0). Wait, no, wait: the code is (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1). Wait, let me see: for example, if n is 3, then 3/3 is 1, times 2 is 2, plus 0 gives 2. If n is 4, then 4/3 is 1, so 2 +1=3. Hmm, so the formula is (n divided by 3) *2 plus 1 if there's a remainder. So the first program's output is that value.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC142_A, takes a double input. It calculates countOdd as the rounded value of input divided by 2. Then, it computes countOdd divided by input, and outputs that as a BigDecimal with 10 decimal places. Wait, let me check the code again. The code does:\n\ncountOdd = Math.round(input / 2); \n\nSo input/2 is rounded to the nearest integer. Then, the result is countOdd divided by input, and that is converted to a BigDecimal with 10 decimal places, rounded to the nearest. \n\nWait, the code uses countOdd / input. Since countOdd is an integer (because Math.round returns a double, but in Java, when you do Math.round on a double, it returns a long, but in the code here, they cast it to a double?), Wait, no, Math.round(double) returns a long. So in the code, countOdd is a double? Let me see:\n\ndouble countOdd = Math.round(input / 2); \n\nWait, Math.round(input/2) returns a long, but assigning to a double would be okay, but perhaps in Java, that's allowed. So countOdd is the rounded value of input/2. Then, the result is (countOdd / input) as a BigDecimal, scaled to 10 decimal places. \n\nSo the second program takes the first program's output (which is an integer) as input, then does this calculation. \n\nNow, the task is to combine these two into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input to the second. So in Fortran, I need to read the input (the initial n), compute the first step's result, then pass that into the second step's computation, and then output the final result. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n- The first step's input is read via Fortran's input (probably from stdin), then compute the first value (let's call it x), then compute the second step's result using x as input, then output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read integer n from input.\n\n2. Compute x = (n / 3) * 2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0). Wait, in Java, integer division is truncating towards zero. So for n=4, 4/3 is 1, mod is 1, so x is 1*2 +1 =3. For n=5, 5/3 is 1, mod 2, so 2+1=3? Wait, no, 5 mod 3 is 2, so the term is 1. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\n3. Then, take x as the input to the second program. The second program's input is a double, so x is treated as a real number here. \n\nWait, the second Java program's input is a double, so in the original sequence, the first program's output (an integer) is passed as a double to the second. So in Fortran, the second step's input is the integer x, but treated as a real number. \n\nSo in the second step:\n\ninput_val = x (as a real number)\n\ncountOdd = rounded(input_val / 2.0). Since input_val is an integer, input_val/2 is a real, then rounded to nearest integer. \n\nThen, the result is (countOdd / input_val), which is a real number, and we need to output it with 10 decimal places, rounded properly. \n\nWait, the Java code uses BigDecimal's setScale with 10 decimal places and RoundingMode.HALF_UP. So in Fortran, we need to compute that value with sufficient precision and format the output to 10 decimal places, using proper rounding. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read the integer n from stdin. \n\nCompute x as per first step. \n\nThen compute the second step's variables. \n\nLet me think about variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nCompute x = (n / 3) * 2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0). \n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for integers, it truncates. So n divided by 3 is integer division. So for n=4, 4/3 is 1, mod is 1. So the formula holds. \n\nSo x = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3) /=0 )\n\nThen, the second step's input is x (as a real number). Let me call that input_val = real(x, kind=8) (using double precision). \n\nThen, countOdd is the rounded value of input_val / 2.0. \n\nIn Fortran, to round to the nearest integer, we can use the nint() function. So countOdd = nint(input_val / 2.0d0). \n\nThen, the result is (countOdd / input_val). \n\nBut in Java, the code uses Math.round which rounds to the nearest integer. So yes, nint is correct here. \n\nThen, the result is (countOdd / input_val). \n\nWe need to output this with 10 decimal places, rounded properly. \n\nIn Fortran, to format the output to 10 decimal places, we can use a format like F12.10 or similar. But we have to ensure that the value is rounded correctly. \n\nWait, the Java code uses BigDecimal with setScale(10, RoundingMode.HALF_UP). So the rounding is to 10 decimal places, using the half-up method. \n\nIn Fortran, when using the F format, the rounding is done as per the compiler's default, which is typically half-even (bankers rounding), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the G format or other. Hmm, but maybe for the purposes of this problem, using the default rounding in Fortran's write statement with sufficient precision would suffice, as the problem might not require strict adherence to the rounding mode, but just the same as the Java code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation can be done with enough precision so that when printed to 10 decimals, it matches. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's approach is to compute the division as a double, then use BigDecimal to set the scale. \n\nWait, in the Java code, countOdd is a double (since it's assigned from Math.round which returns a long, but stored as a double). Then countOdd / input is a double, which is then converted to a BigDecimal. Then scaled to 10 decimals with HALF_UP. \n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, using double precision variables and then formatting the output to 10 decimals would be sufficient. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nProgram sequence\n\nImplicit None\n\nInteger :: n, x\n\nReal(Kind=8) :: input_val, countOdd, result\n\nRead(*,*) n\n\nx = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n\ninput_val = dble(x)\n\ncountOdd = nint(input_val / 2.0d0)\n\nresult = countOdd / input_val\n\nWrite(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nEnd Program\n\nWait, but let me check the steps again. \n\nWait, the first step's output is x, which is an integer. The second step's input is that x as a double. So input_val is real(x,8). \n\nThen countOdd is the rounded value of input_val / 2.0d0. \n\nThen result is countOdd / input_val. \n\nThen, output that with 10 decimal places. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the result is (countOdd / input). Since countOdd is an integer (rounded), and input is the original input (the x from first step). \n\nWait, in the Java code, the input is a double, so when you do countOdd / input, it's a double division. \n\nIn Fortran, using real variables, that's okay. \n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose n is 3. \n\nFirst step: x = (3/3)*2 +0 = 2. \n\nSecond step: input_val = 2.0. \n\ncountOdd = nint(2.0/2) = 1. \n\nresult = 1/2 = 0.5. So output is 0.5000000000. \n\nIn Java, input is 2.0, countOdd is Math.round(2/2)=1. Then 1/2.0 is 0.5, so the BigDecimal would output 0.5 with 10 decimals as 0.5000000000. \n\nAnother example: n=4. \n\nFirst step: x = (4/3)*2 +1 = 1*2 +1 =3. \n\nSecond step: input_val=3.0. \n\ncountOdd = nint(3/2) = nint(1.5) = 2. \n\nresult = 2/3 \u2248 0.6666666666666666. \n\nJava would compute 2/3.0, which is 0.6666666666666666, then scaled to 10 decimals with HALF_UP. So 0.6666666667? Wait, let's see. \n\nWait, 2 divided by 3 is 0.6666666666666666..., so when rounded to 10 decimals, the 11th digit is 6, so the 10th is 6, so it would be 0.6666666667? Wait, no, the 10th decimal is the 6th digit after the decimal? Wait, let's count:\n\n0.6666666666666666...\n\nThe first decimal is 6, second 6, third 6, fourth 6, fifth 6, sixth 6, seventh 6, eighth 6, ninth 6, tenth 6, then the 11th is 6 again. So when rounding to 10 decimals, since the 11th digit is 6 (>=5), we round up the 10th digit. So the 10th digit becomes 7. So the result would be 0.6666666667. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, when we write with F12.10, how does it round? Let me see. \n\nSuppose the value is 0.6666666666666666. \n\nThe 10th decimal is the 6th digit? Wait, no, the first decimal is 6 (tenths), second 6 (hundredths), up to the tenth decimal (ten billionths). \n\nThe value is 0.6666666666666666..., so the 10th decimal is the 10th digit after the decimal point, which is 6. The next digit is 6, so when rounding to 10 decimals, it would round up to 7. \n\nSo the output should be 0.6666666667. \n\nIn Fortran, if the variable is stored as a double, then writing with F12.10 would give that? Let me see. \n\nIn Fortran, the format F12.10 would mean 12 columns, with 10 decimals. The value 0.6666666666666666 would be written as 0.6666666667? Because the 11th digit is 6, so rounds up. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation in Fortran would be precise enough. \n\nAnother test case: n=5. \n\nFirst step: x = (5/3)*2 +1 (since mod(5,3)=2\u22600). 5/3 is 1, so 2 +1=3. \n\nWait, wait, 5 divided by 3 is 1, mod 2. So the formula gives 1*2 +1 =3. \n\nSecond step: input_val=3.0. \n\nSame as previous example. So same result. \n\nAnother test case: n=1. \n\nFirst step: x = (0)*2 +1 (since mod(1,3)=1\u22600) \u2192 1. \n\nSecond step: input_val=1.0. \n\ncountOdd = nint(0.5) \u2192 1. \n\nresult = 1/1 =1.0 \u2192 output 1.0000000000. \n\nAnother case: n=2. \n\nFirst step: x = (0)*2 +1 \u21921. \n\nSecond step: input_val=1.0 \u2192 same as above. \n\nAnother case: n=6. \n\nFirst step: x = (6/3)*2 +0 \u2192 2*2=4. \n\nSecond step: input_val=4.0. \n\ncountOdd = nint(4/2) =2. \n\nresult = 2/4 =0.5 \u2192 0.5000000000. \n\nAnother case: n=7. \n\nFirst step: 7/3 is 2, mod 1 \u2192 2*2 +1=5. \n\nSecond step: input_val=5.0. \n\ncountOdd = nint(5/2) \u21922.5 \u2192 rounded to 2 or 3? Wait, 5/2 is 2.5. nint(2.5) in Fortran rounds to even. Wait, nint(2.5) is 2? Or 3? \n\nWait, the nint function in Fortran rounds to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from zero. Wait, no, according to the Fortran standard, the ROUND function rounds to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded to the even integer. Wait, nint is the nearest integer function. Let me check:\n\nThe Fortran intrinsic function NINT(A) returns the nearest integer to A. If A is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the one with the even lower-order digit. Wait, no, actually, the standard says that for halfway cases, it rounds to the nearest even integer. \n\nWait, for example, 2.5 would round to 2 or 3? Let me see. \n\nIf the number is 2.5, then the two integers are 2 and 3. The even one is 2, so NINT(2.5) would be 2. \n\nWait, but in Java's Math.round(2.5) is 3, because it rounds to the closest integer, and if halfway, rounds away from zero. \n\nAh, this is a problem. Because in the second step, the countOdd is computed as Math.round(input/2). \n\nSo in the case of input_val=5.0 (from n=7), input/2 is 2.5. \n\nJava's Math.round(2.5) is 3, because it rounds to the nearest integer, and for halfway cases, rounds away from zero. \n\nBut in Fortran's NINT(2.5) would round to 2 (since 2 is even). \n\nThis discrepancy would cause the results to differ. \n\nOh no, that's a problem. \n\nSo the rounding method is different between Java's Math.round and Fortran's NINT. \n\nHmm, so how to handle this?\n\nThe problem requires that the Fortran program must behave identically to the original Java sequence. \n\nTherefore, in the case of 2.5, the Java code would round to 3, but Fortran's NINT would round to 2. \n\nSo we need to adjust the Fortran code to replicate Java's rounding. \n\nJava's Math.round(double) returns the closest long to the argument. The behavior for halfway cases is to round to the even integer? Or away from zero?\n\nWait, according to Java's documentation, Math.round(double) returns the closest long to the argument. If the value is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the even one. Wait, no, actually, the documentation says: \n\n\"The result is the same as the value of the expression (int)Math.floor(a + 0.5f).\"\n\nWait, no, for double, it's (long)Math.floor(a + 0.5d). \n\nWait, let me check:\n\nJava's Math.round(double a) is equivalent to (long) Math.floor(a + 0.5d). \n\nWait, for example, 2.5 +0.5 is 3.0 \u2192 floor(3.0) is 3 \u2192 so rounds to 3. \n\nSimilarly, 3.5 would be 4.0 \u2192 floor(4.0) is 4. \n\nWait, so for 2.5, it rounds to 3, which is away from zero. \n\nWait, so the formula is adding 0.5 and flooring. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nMath.round(2.5) \u2192 (long) Math.floor(2.5 +0.5) \u2192 3.0 \u2192 3. \n\nMath.round(3.5) \u2192 4.0 \u21924. \n\nSo for halfway cases, it rounds away from zero. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to replicate this, we need a function that rounds 2.5 to 3, 3.5 to 4, etc. \n\nThe Fortran NINT function uses round to nearest, with ties to even. So for 2.5, it would round to 2 (even), but Java rounds to 3. \n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the code to use a different rounding method. \n\nHmm, how can we do that in Fortran?\n\nAlternative approach: compute the rounded value as the integer part of (x + 0.5), where x is the value to be rounded. \n\nWait, for example, for 2.5: 2.5 +0.5 =3 \u2192 integer part is 3. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the INT function truncates towards zero. \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a real number a. To round to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from zero, we can compute:\n\nrounded = int(a + 0.5d0) \n\nWait, let's test:\n\na =2.5 \u2192 2.5 +0.5 =3 \u2192 int(3.0) \u21923. \n\na=3.5 \u21924 \u21924. \n\na= -2.5 \u2192-2.5 +0.5 =-2 \u2192 int(-2.0) \u2192-2. \n\nWait, but for negative numbers, like -2.5, adding 0.5 gives -2.0, which is rounded to -2, but the correct rounding (away from zero) would be -3. \n\nHmm, so this approach works for positive numbers but not for negatives. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the NINT function but adjusting for the difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input to the second program is always non-negative, since the first program's output is an integer (n is a positive integer?), so perhaps in the problem's context, the input to the second program is a positive integer. \n\nAssuming that the input to the second program is a positive number (since n is read as an integer, and the first program's output is x which is at least 0?), then perhaps the negative case is not a problem here. \n\nTherefore, for positive numbers, using the formula rounded = int(a +0.5d0) would work. \n\nSo in the case of 2.5, that gives 3, which matches Java's Math.round. \n\nSo in Fortran, instead of using NINT, we can compute countOdd as INT(input_val / 2.0d0 + 0.5d0). \n\nYes, that would work for positive numbers. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ncountOdd = int( (input_val / 2.0d0) + 0.5d0 )\n\nThis would replicate the Java's Math.round behavior for positive numbers. \n\nTherefore, the corrected code would be:\n\nProgram sequence\n\nImplicit None\n\nInteger :: n, x\n\nReal(Kind=8) :: input_val, result\n\nRead(*,*) n\n\nx = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n\ninput_val = dble(x)\n\ncountOdd = int( (input_val / 2.0d0) + 0.5d0 )\n\nresult = countOdd / input_val\n\nWrite(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nEnd Program\n\nWait, but countOdd is a real variable? Or integer? \n\nWait, countOdd is the rounded value, which is an integer. So in Fortran, countOdd can be an integer variable. \n\nWait, let me adjust variables:\n\nInteger :: countOdd\n\nSo:\n\nProgram sequence\n\nImplicit None\n\nInteger :: n, x, countOdd\n\nReal(Kind=8) :: input_val, result\n\nRead(*,*) n\n\nx = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n\ninput_val = dble(x)\n\ncountOdd = int( (input_val / 2.0d0) + 0.5d0 )\n\nresult = real(countOdd,8) / input_val\n\nWrite(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nEnd Program\n\nWait, because countOdd is an integer, so when dividing by input_val (a real), we need to cast countOdd to real. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, when you divide an integer by a real, it automatically converts the integer to real. \n\nWait, in the line result = countOdd / input_val, since countOdd is integer and input_val is real(8), the division would be done as real(8). \n\nYes, so that's okay. \n\nTesting the previous example where input_val is 5.0 (from x=5):\n\ninput_val /2 =2.5 \u2192 adding 0.5 gives 3.0 \u2192 int(3.0) \u21923. \n\nSo countOdd is 3. \n\nresult is 3/5 =0.6 \u2192 but wait, 3/5 is 0.6 exactly. \n\nWait, but 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, so the output would be 0.6000000000. \n\nWait, but let's see what the Java code would do. \n\nJava code for input_val=5.0 (the input to the second program is 5.0):\n\ncountOdd = Math.round(5.0/2) \u2192 Math.round(2.5) \u21923. \n\nThen, 3/5.0 =0.6 \u2192 which is exactly 0.6, so when scaled to 10 decimals, it's 0.6000000000. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nAnother test case where input_val is 4.0:\n\ninput_val/2 =2.0 \u2192 adding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) \u21922? Wait no, wait, 2.0 +0.5 is 2.5 \u2192 adding 0.5 to 2.0 (input_val/2 is 2.0). Wait, input_val is 4.0, so input_val/2 is 2.0. \n\nAdding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2? Wait no, in Fortran, the INT function truncates towards zero. So 2.5 becomes 2. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, for 2.0 (input_val/2 is 2.0), adding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Wait, the input_val is 4.0, so input_val/2 is 2.0. \n\nThen, adding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2? \n\nWait, no, the INT function in Fortran truncates towards zero. So 2.5 becomes 2. \n\nWait, but that's wrong. Because in Java, Math.round(2.0) is 2.0 \u2192 so countOdd would be 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the formula is correct. \n\nWait, the problem is when the value is exactly halfway between two integers. \n\nWait, in the case of 2.5, the formula gives 3, which is correct. \n\nWait, in the case of 2.0, adding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nWait, no, in the case of input_val=4.0, input_val/2 is 2.0. \n\nAdding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2 (since it truncates). \n\nWait, that's wrong. Because 2.5 should round to 3. \n\nWait, wait, no, the formula is (input_val/2) +0.5 \u2192 then take the integer part. \n\nWait, no, the formula is countOdd = int( (input_val/2) +0.5 )\n\nWait, for input_val/2 =2.0 \u2192 adding 0.5 gives 2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2. \n\nBut that's wrong. Because Math.round(2.0) is 2.0 \u2192 so countOdd should be 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the formula is correct. \n\nWait, the problem is when the value is exactly halfway between two integers. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe formula is countOdd = int( (a) +0.5 ), where a is input_val/2. \n\nWait, for a=2.0 \u2192 2.0 +0.5 =2.5 \u2192 int(2.5) is 2. \n\nBut Math.round(2.0) is 2.0 \u2192 so that's correct. \n\nAh, right. So the formula works for that case. \n\nWait, the problem was when a is exactly halfway between two integers. \n\nWait, for a=2.5 \u2192 input_val/2 is 2.5 \u2192 adding 0.5 gives 3.0 \u2192 int(3.0) is 3 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nAnother example: a=2.4 \u2192 2.4+0.5=2.9 \u2192 int(2.9)=2 \u2192 but Math.round(2.4) is 2. \n\nWait, no, 2.4 rounded is 2. \n\nWait, the formula works. \n\nAnother example: a=2.6 \u2192 2.6+0.5=3.1 \u2192 int(3.1)=3 \u2192 which is correct (Math.round(2.6)=3). \n\nSo the formula works for all cases except when the value is negative, but since input_val is positive (as it's the output of the first program, which is an integer derived from n, which is read as an integer, presumably positive?), then this formula is okay. \n\nTherefore, the code with countOdd = int( (input_val/2.0d0) +0.5d0 ) is correct. \n\nNow, the next part is the output formatting. \n\nThe Java code uses BigDecimal with setScale(10, RoundingMode.HALF_UP). \n\nIn Fortran, when we write with F12.10, does it round correctly? \n\nThe F format in Fortran rounds to the nearest decimal, with the 11th digit determining the rounding. \n\nFor example, if the value is 0.6666666666666666, then the 10th decimal is 6, the 11th is 6, so it rounds up to 7. \n\nThe F12.10 format would display 0.6666666667. \n\nWhich matches the Java's result. \n\nAnother example: 0.6 exactly \u2192 0.6000000000. \n\nAnother example: 0.123456789012345 \u2192 would be 0.1234567890 (if the 11th digit is 1, rounds down) or 0.1234567891 (if 5 or more). \n\nTherefore, using the F12.10 format should be sufficient. \n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, x, countOdd\n  real(kind=8) :: input_val, result\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  x = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1, 0, mod(n,3) /= 0)\n\n  input_val = dble(x)\n  countOdd = int( (input_val / 2.0d0) + 0.5d0 )\n  result = real(countOdd, kind=8) / input_val\n\n  write(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the calculation of result, since countOdd is an integer, dividing by input_val (real(8)) will automatically cast countOdd to real(8). So the real() conversion is unnecessary. \n\nSo the line can be:\n\nresult = countOdd / input_val\n\nWhich is better. \n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, x, countOdd\n  real(kind=8) :: input_val, result\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  x = (n / 3) * 2 + merge(1, 0, mod(n,3) /= 0)\n\n  input_val = dble(x)\n  countOdd = int( (input_val / 2.0d0) + 0.5d0 )\n  result = countOdd / input_val\n\n  write(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nend program main\n\nTesting this code with n=7 (which gives x=5):\n\ninput_val =5.0d0 \u2192 countOdd = int(2.5 +0.5) \u21923. \n\nresult =3/5 =0.6 \u2192 output 0.6000000000. \n\nAnother test case n=2 \u2192 x=1 \u2192 input_val=1.0 \u2192 countOdd = int(0.5 +0.5)=1 \u2192 1/1=1 \u2192 output 1.0000000000. \n\nAnother test case n=4 \u2192 x=3 \u2192 input_val=3 \u2192 countOdd = int(1.5 +0.5)=2 \u2192 2/3 \u22480.6666666666666666 \u2192 output 0.6666666667. \n\nWhich matches the expected result. \n\nTherefore, this should be correct."
