    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst program (codeforces_653_A.java):\n- Reads an integer n, then n integers into a list.\n- Removes duplicates and sorts the list.\n- Checks if there are three consecutive numbers in the sorted list. If yes, outputs \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSecond program (codeforces_276_B.java):\n- Reads a string.\n- Counts the frequency of each character.\n- Counts how many characters have an odd count.\n- If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's an odd number (but wait, the condition is written as \"oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0\". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check again. The condition is \"if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0)\", so if oddCount is 0 or 1, then \"First\", else if oddCount is even? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is \"if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0)\", so if either of those is true, then \"First\", else \"Second\". Hmm, so for example, if oddCount is 3 (which is odd), then it's true. But if it's 2 (even), then it's false. So the condition is met when oddCount is 0,1, or any odd number. Wait, but 3 is odd, so yes. So the \"First\" is printed when the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or an odd number greater than 1. Wait, but 0 is even, so the condition is \"oddCount <=1 (so 0 or 1) OR oddCount is odd (regardless of being more than 1)\". So for example, if oddCount is 3, it's odd, so condition is true. If it's 2, then neither, so \"Second\". So the logic is that if the number of odd counts is even and greater than 1, then \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nWait, the original code's condition is written as:\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) {\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n} else {\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n}\n\nWait, let's parse that. The first part is \"oddCount <=1\" (so 0 or 1). The second part is \"oddCount is odd (since mod 2 !=0)\". So the condition is true if either of those is true. So for example:\n\n- oddCount =0 \u2192 true \u2192 First\n- 1 \u2192 true \u2192 First\n- 2 \u2192 even \u2192 not first \u2192 Second\n- 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 true \u2192 First\n- 4 \u2192 even \u2192 Second\n- 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 First\n\nSo the condition is that if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number (regardless of being more than 1), then \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". Wait, but the first program outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\", and the second program expects a string input. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the first program's output is a string (YES/NO), and that is the input to the second program? But the second program reads a string from input, which would be that \"YES\" or \"NO\". But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is then the input to the second program, which processes that string. But the second program's code is expecting a string input (the first line is \"String str = bufferedReader.readLine();\", so it reads a line, which would be the output of the first program. Then the second program processes that string and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", so the second program's input is that string. So the second program's logic would count the characters in \"YES\" or \"NO\", then decide based on that.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a single line, so the second program reads that line as its input. So the entire sequence is: input to first program \u2192 first's output is input to second \u2192 second's output is the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the original input (the input to the first Java program), process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n followed by n integers).\n2. Process the first step (check for 3 consecutive numbers after dedup and sort).\n3. Then, take the output of that (YES/NO) as the input to the second step (count characters in that string, etc.).\n4. Finally, output the result of the second step (First or Second).\n\nSo the Fortran program must do all that in one go, without any intermediate I/O except for the first read and the final write.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\nStep 1 (First Java program's processing):\n\n- Read n and list of integers.\n- Remove duplicates and sort the list.\n- Check if there are three consecutive numbers in the sorted list. If yes, then the first output is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nStep 2 (Second Java program's processing):\n\n- Take the string from step1's output (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n- Count the frequency of each character in that string.\n- Count how many have odd counts.\n- Determine if the number of odd counts meets the condition (<=1 or odd) \u2192 output \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the input (n and the list of integers).\n\nProcess step1 to get the string (YES/NO).\n\nProcess step2 on that string to get the final output (First/Second).\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each step in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (step1):\n\nWe need to read n, then n integers. Then, process them to remove duplicates, sort, and check for three consecutive numbers.\n\nIn Fortran, to handle duplicates, perhaps we can read all the numbers into an array, then create a sorted array with unique elements.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have built-in functions for this, so we need to do it manually.\n\nFirst, read the numbers into an array. Then, sort them, then remove duplicates.\n\nWait, steps for step1:\n\n1. Read n and the list of integers.\n\n2. Sort the list.\n\n3. Remove duplicates (so that consecutive duplicates are removed).\n\nWait, the Java code uses stream().distinct().sorted(). So the list is first deduplicated and then sorted. Wait, no, the code is a.stream().distinct().sorted().collect... So the order is: first take the stream, then apply distinct (so deduplicate), then sort. So the sorted list is the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nWait, in Java, the distinct() comes before sorted()? Wait, no, the code is a.stream().distinct().sorted(). So the stream is first deduplicated, then sorted. Wait, no, the order is: the stream is first deduplicated, then sorted. Wait, no, the order of the operations matters. The distinct() is applied first, then sorted(). So the distinct elements are then sorted. So the final list is the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nWait, in Java, the order of the stream operations is important. So the code is:\n\na.stream() \u2192 creates a stream of the elements in a.\n\n.distinct() \u2192 removes duplicates, so each element is unique.\n\n.sorted() \u2192 sorts the remaining elements.\n\nSo the sorted list is the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we need to first sort the array, then remove duplicates, or first deduplicate and then sort? Wait, no, the order is first deduplicate, then sort. Wait, no, the stream is first deduplicated, then sorted. So the distinct elements are then sorted. So the correct order is: deduplicate first, then sort.\n\nWait, no, the stream is first deduplicated, then sorted. So the distinct() is applied first, so the elements are unique, then sorted. So the final list is the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nWait, but in code, the order is distinct then sorted. So the elements are first made unique, then sorted. So the sorted list is the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Read all the numbers into an array.\n\n- Create a new array with unique elements. To do this, we can sort the array first, then remove duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to sort the array, then remove duplicates by checking adjacent elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can first sort the array, then go through and remove duplicates.\n\nSo steps for dedup and sort:\n\n1. Read the array, then sort it.\n\n2. Then, create a new array with only the unique elements. Since the array is sorted, duplicates are adjacent.\n\nSo for example, after sorting, we can loop through and add elements to a new array only if they are different from the previous one.\n\nOnce we have the unique sorted array, then check for three consecutive numbers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n, then the array.\n\nSort the array.\n\nCreate a new array for unique elements.\n\nThen, check if there are three consecutive numbers in the unique array.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, so perhaps we can use a dynamic array approach, but since Fortran 90 allows allocatable arrays, that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum n is not specified, but in programming competition problems, n is usually up to 1e5 or so, but in this case, perhaps the problem constraints are small. But for the code, we can proceed with allocatable arrays.\n\nSo first, read the numbers into an array, then sort them.\n\nThen, create a new array for unique elements.\n\nOnce that is done, check for three consecutive numbers.\n\nOnce that is done, the first output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThen, the second part processes that string.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe input is the string from the first step (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in that string.\n\nThen, count how many have an odd count.\n\nThen, decide based on the condition.\n\nSo for example, if the first output is \"YES\", then the characters are 'Y', 'E', 'S' \u2192 each appears once. So counts are all 1 (odd). So oddCount is 3 (since three characters each with count 1). Since 3 is odd, the condition (oddCount <=1 or oddCount is odd) is true \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor \"YES\", the counts are Y:1, E:1, S:1 \u2192 all odd. So oddCount is 3. Since 3 is odd, the condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nFor \"NO\", the counts are N:1, O:1 \u2192 oddCount is 2. Since 2 is even and greater than 1, so condition is false \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nWait, but let's check the condition again. The condition is:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 then \"First\".\n\nSo for \"NO\", oddCount is 2 \u2192 2>1 and even \u2192 so condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nSo the second part's output would be \"First\" for \"YES\" and \"Second\" for \"NO\".\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the code:\n\nIn the second Java program, for \"YES\":\n\noddCount is 3 (each character has count 1, so three entries with odd counts). Since 3 is odd, the condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nFor \"NO\", oddCount is 2 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 condition is false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nSo the final output of the entire sequence would be \"First\" if the first program outputs \"YES\", else \"Second\".\n\nWait, but let me think again. The first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is the input to the second program. The second program processes that string and outputs \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nSo the final output is \"First\" when the first program's output is \"YES\", and \"Second\" when it's \"NO\".\n\nWait, because:\n\nCase 1: first outputs \"YES\" \u2192 second's input is \"YES\" \u2192 oddCount is 3 (each character count 1). 3 is odd \u2192 condition is true \u2192 \"First\".\n\nCase 2: first outputs \"NO\" \u2192 input is \"NO\" \u2192 counts are N:1, O:1 \u2192 oddCount is 2 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 condition false \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is \"First\" if the first program's check is true (found three consecutive numbers), else \"Second\".\n\nWait, that's a simplification. Because the second program's output depends on the first's output. So the entire sequence's final output is \"First\" if the first program's output is \"YES\", else \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the input (n and the list of numbers).\n\nProcess the first step (check for three consecutive numbers in the unique sorted list).\n\nIf found, then the second step's input is \"YES\", leading to \"First\".\n\nElse, the second step's input is \"NO\", leading to \"Second\".\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me confirm with the second program's logic.\n\nWait, the second program's output is \"First\" when the input string (from first program) has an oddCount (number of characters with odd counts) that is 0,1, or any odd number (like 3). So for \"YES\", which has 3 characters each with count 1 (so oddCount=3 \u2192 odd \u2192 condition met \u2192 \"First\").\n\nFor \"NO\", which has two characters each with count 1 \u2192 oddCount=2 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 condition not met \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the final output is \"First\" if the first program's output is \"YES\", else \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute whether the first program's condition is met, then output \"First\" or \"Second\" accordingly.\n\nWait, that's a shortcut. Because the second program's output is determined solely by the first program's output. So instead of actually processing the string \"YES\" or \"NO\" through the second program's logic, we can just compute the result based on the first's result.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nYes, because the second program's output is determined by the first's output. Since the first's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", the second program's processing of those two strings will always result in \"First\" or \"Second\" respectively.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as:\n\nIf the first program's condition is true \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nElse \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written without actually processing the string through the second step's logic, but just based on the first's result.\n\nWait, that's a big simplification. Let me confirm again.\n\nYes, because the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and the second program's processing of those two strings will always give \"First\" or \"Second\" respectively. Therefore, the entire sequence's final output is \"First\" if the first program's condition is met, else \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute the first condition, then output \"First\" or \"Second\" based on that.\n\nThis simplifies the code a lot. So the steps are:\n\nRead n and the list of integers.\n\nProcess the first step (check for three consecutive numbers in the unique sorted list).\n\nIf found \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nElse \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can be written without needing to process the string through the second step's logic. That's a good optimization.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement the first step in Fortran.\n\nLet me proceed to code.\n\nFirst, read n and the list of integers.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) or list-directed input.\n\nWe can read n first, then an array of size n.\n\nThen, sort the array.\n\nThen, remove duplicates.\n\nThen, check for three consecutive numbers.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, found = 0\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), unique(:)\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nSort the array:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort function. Need to implement a sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function. Wait, in Fortran 90, there is the 'sort' function in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or perhaps we can use the 'merge sort' or 'bubble sort'?\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic. Wait, I think in Fortran 90, you can use the 'sort' function via the 'ieee' module? Or perhaps the 'merge' function?\n\nAlternatively, use the 'bubble sort' for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic from the standard library.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Let me check.\n\nIn Fortran, the 'sort' function is part of the Fortran 2003 standard, but perhaps the compiler supports it. Alternatively, use the 'merge sort' or another method.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'heap sort' or 'bubble sort'.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the 'ieee' module? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function via the 'ieee' module.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to use the 'sort' function from the standard library.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function as follows:\n\ncall msort(a)\n\nBut that requires a subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, here's a simple bubble sort for the array:\n\nsubroutine bubble_sort(arr)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer :: i, j, temp\n    logical :: swapped\n    do\n        swapped = .false.\n        do j = 1, size(arr)-1\n            if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n                temp = arr(j)\n                arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n                arr(j+1) = temp\n                swapped = .true.\n            end if\n        end do\n        if (.not. swapped) exit\n    end do\nend subroutine bubble_sort\n\nThen, after reading the array, call bubble_sort(a).\n\nOnce sorted, we need to create the unique array.\n\nTo create the unique array:\n\nWe can loop through the sorted array and collect elements that are not duplicates.\n\nInitialize an array 'unique' with the first element, then for each subsequent element, if it's different from the last in 'unique', add it.\n\nBut since the array is sorted, duplicates are adjacent.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(unique(n)) ! maximum possible size (if all unique)\nj = 1\nunique(1) = a(1)\ndo i = 2, n\n    if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n        j = j +1\n        unique(j) = a(i)\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, the actual size of unique is j.\n\nBut since we allocated unique(n), we can then trim it to size j.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can reallocate:\n\nallocate(unique(j), source=unique(1:j))\n\nWait, perhaps better to first count the number of unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, first count the number of unique elements, then allocate the array.\n\nLet me think:\n\ncount = 1\n\ndo i = 2, n\n\n    if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nallocate(unique(count))\n\nunique(1) = a(1)\n\nj =1\n\ndo i =2, n\n\n    if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n        unique(j) = a(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, we can have the correct size.\n\nAlternatively, proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize count to 1.\n\nLoop through the array from the second element:\n\nif current element is different from previous, increment count.\n\nThen allocate unique(count).\n\nThen loop again to fill the array.\n\nThis is more efficient.\n\nSo code steps:\n\ncount =1\n\ndo i=2, n\n\n    if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nallocate(unique(count))\n\nunique(1) = a(1)\n\nj=1\n\ndo i=2, n\n\n    if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n        j = j +1\n\n        unique(j) = a(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nNow, the unique array has the sorted, unique elements.\n\nNow, check for three consecutive numbers.\n\nWe need to check if there exists i such that unique(i) +1 == unique(i+1) and unique(i+1)+1 == unique(i+2).\n\nSo loop from i=1 to count-2:\n\ndo i=1, count-2\n\n    if (unique(i+1) == unique(i)+1 .and. unique(i+2) == unique(i+1)+1) then\n\n        found = 1\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nIf found is 1, then output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all the code together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, count, j, found = 0\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), unique(:)\n\n    ! Read n and the array\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\n    ! Sort the array\n\n    call bubble_sort(a)\n\n    ! Create unique array\n\n    count =1\n\n    do i=2, n\n\n        if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n            count = count +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    allocate(unique(count))\n\n    unique(1) = a(1)\n\n    j=1\n\n    do i=2, n\n\n        if (a(i) /= a(i-1)) then\n\n            j = j +1\n\n            unique(j) = a(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Check for three consecutive numbers\n\n    found =0\n\n    do i=1, count-2\n\n        if (unique(i+1) == unique(i)+1 .and. unique(i+2) == unique(i+1)+1) then\n\n            found =1\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result based on found\n\n    if (found ==1) then\n\n        print*, 'First'\n\n    else\n\n        print*, 'Second'\n\n    end if\n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine bubble_sort(arr)\n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n        integer :: i, j, temp\n\n        logical :: swapped\n\n        do\n\n            swapped = .false.\n\n            do j = 1, size(arr)-1\n\n                if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n                    temp = arr(j)\n\n                    arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n\n                    arr(j+1) = temp\n\n                    swapped = .true.\n\n                end if\n\n            end do\n\n            if (.not. swapped) exit\n\n        end do\n\n    end subroutine bubble_sort\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, the bubble_sort is a subroutine inside the program, using a 'contains' block.\n\nAlternatively, the bubble sort can be written as an internal subroutine.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, let's test some cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 after dedup and sort \u2192 [1,2,3]. So three consecutive \u2192 found is 1 \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n1 3 5 \u2192 sorted unique is [1,3,5]. Check 1+1=2 !=3 \u2192 no. 3+1=4 !=5 \u2192 no. So no three consecutive \u2192 output \"Second\".\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs \"NO\" \u2192 second outputs \"Second\".\n\nAnother test case where the first program's input has duplicates but after dedup, there are three consecutive.\n\nE.g., input 5 numbers: 1,2,2,3,4 \u2192 dedup gives [1,2,3,4]. So 1,2,3 \u2192 yes \u2192 output \"First\".\n\nAnother case where after dedup, the array is [1,3,4,5]. Then 3,4,5 \u2192 yes \u2192 \"First\".\n\nAnother case where the array after dedup is [2,3,5], so no three consecutive \u2192 \"Second\".\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code uses bubble sort, which is O(n\u00b2), but for programming competition problems, if n is up to 1e4, it might be slow, but for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, use a better sort, but in Fortran, without built-in functions, it's easier to use bubble sort for small n.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge sort' for better performance, but that's more code.\n\nBut given that the problem's code is for code translation, and the original Java code uses streams which are O(n log n) for sorting, but in the Fortran code, the bubble sort may be sufficient for the problem's test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final code is as above.\n\nWait, but in the code, after sorting, the unique array is built correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the code, the 'count' variable is correctly calculated.\n\nYes.\n\nThe check for three consecutive numbers is done correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
