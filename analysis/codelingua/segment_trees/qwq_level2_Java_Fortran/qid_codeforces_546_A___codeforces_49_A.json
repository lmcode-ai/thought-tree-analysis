    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_546_A) reads three long integers: pandu, vundu, and urdu. Then it calculates a sum c by looping from 1 to urdu, adding i*pandu each time. If the total c is less than vundu, it outputs 0; else, it outputs c - vundu.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_49_A) reads a string, then looks for the last non-space and non-question mark character. It checks if that character is a vowel (including 'y'), and outputs YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, the key is to chain them. The output of the first Java program is the input to the second. Wait, but how exactly? The first program's output is a number (either 0 or c - vundu), which would be a string when printed. The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is a number, which becomes the input string for the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string, possibly with a newline.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is printed, and that's the input to the second. So the second program reads that output as its input. So the first program's output is a number (like \"123\" or \"0\"), and the second program reads that as a string. So the second program's input is that number as a string, possibly followed by a newline.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, I need to first compute the first program's result, then pass that result as the input string to the second program's logic, without any I/O in between.\n\nSo the steps for the Fortran program:\n\n1. Read the three numbers (pandu, vundu, urdu) from input (only first part reads input).\n2. Compute c as the sum of i*pandu for i from 1 to urdu.\n3. Determine the first output (either 0 or c - vundu). Let's call this value 'result1'.\n4. Then, process this result1 as the input string for the second part. So, convert result1 to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program), then process that string through the second program's logic.\n5. Finally, output the result of the second part (YES or NO).\n\nWait, but how exactly is the first program's output formatted? The first Java program uses System.out.print, which does not add a newline. So the output is just the number followed by whatever the print stream's next output would be. But in the second Java program, it uses nextLine(), which reads until the next newline. So the first program's output must be the entire input for the second program. So the first program's output is a number (without a newline), but the second program reads a line. Wait, but if the first program's output is, say, \"123\", then the second program would read that as the entire line (assuming that's the only input). But in reality, the first program's print statement is System.out.print, so it doesn't add a newline. So the second program would need to read that as a line. Hmm, but in practice, when you run the first program, its output is the number, and then the second program would read that as its input. So the input to the second program is exactly the output of the first, which is a number (without a newline?), but perhaps the first program's output is followed by a newline? Wait, the first program's code uses System.out.print, not println. So the output is just the number, no newline. But when you run the first program, the output is printed and then the second program is run, so the input to the second program would be that number followed by whatever is next. But in the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So perhaps the first program's output is a single line (without a newline?), but the second program reads a line. Wait, maybe the first program's output is written to stdout, and then the second program reads from stdin. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (without a newline?), but the second program reads a line. So the input to the second program is that number as a string, possibly with a newline? Hmm, perhaps in the problem's setup, the first program's output is a number followed by a newline, because in Java, after printing, the program ends, so the next program would read that as a line. Wait, but the first program uses print, not println. So if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program's input is \"123\" (without a newline). But when you run the first program, the output is just \"123\" and then the second program is run, so the input to the second program is \"123\" followed by whatever is next. But in the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So perhaps the first program's output is a single line (without a newline?), but the second program reads a line. So the second program's input is exactly the first program's output, which is the number as a string, possibly without a newline. But in Java, when you print to System.out, it's buffered, so maybe the first program's output is written and then the second program reads it. But in any case, the second program's input is the first program's output as a string. So in the Fortran program, the first part's result (the number) must be converted to a string, and then that string is the input to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code:\n\n- Read the three numbers (pandu, vundu, urdu) from input.\n- Compute the first part's result (result1).\n- Convert result1 to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program, which uses System.out.print, so no trailing newline).\n- Then process this string through the second part's logic (checking the last non-space and non-? character).\n- Finally, output the second part's result (YES/NO).\n\nNow, let's think about the variables. The first part's variables are all integers (long in Java, so in Fortran, use integer*8 or integer(kind=8) for 64-bit, but maybe just integer*8 for simplicity).\n\nThe second part's processing is on a string. The first part's result is a number, so converting it to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a string variable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read pandu, vundu, urdu from input (using read(*,*) or read(*, '(3(I0,1X))' )). Wait, but in Java, the first program reads three longs via nextLong(), so the input is three space-separated numbers. So in Fortran, read them as three integers (probably 64-bit, but maybe the problem allows 32-bit? Well, the Java code uses long, which is 64-bit, so in Fortran, use integer*8 variables).\n\n2. Compute c as the sum from i=1 to urdu of i*pandu. So c = pandu * sum_{i=1 to urdu} i. The sum of 1 to urdu is urdu*(urdu+1)/2. So c = pandu * urdu*(urdu+1)/2. Wait, that's a better way to compute it without a loop. Because the loop in Java is doing exactly that. So instead of looping, compute it directly. That would be more efficient, but the problem requires the same behavior. Since the original code uses a loop, but mathematically it's the same. So in Fortran, we can compute it as c = pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2. But need to ensure integer division? Wait, in Java, the loop adds i*pandu each time. Since i is an integer, and pandu is a long, so the total is indeed pandu multiplied by the sum of 1 to urdu. So yes, the formula is correct. So that's better to compute directly.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i <= urdu; i++) { c += i*pandu; }, so the sum is 1+2+...+urdu multiplied by pandu. The sum is urdu*(urdu+1)/2. So yes, the formula is correct. So in Fortran, compute c as pandu * urdu*(urdu+1)/2. But need to make sure that the division is integer division. Since in Java, the sum is an integer, so in Fortran, using integer division (since urdu is an integer, so urdu*(urdu+1) is even, so division by 2 is exact). So that's okay.\n\nThen, if c < vundu, then the first result is 0, else c - vundu. So result1 = max(0, c - vundu). Wait, no: if c < vundu, output 0, else output c - vundu. So result1 = (c < vundu) ? 0 : (c - vundu).\n\nThen, convert result1 to a string. Let's say the string is s. The second part of the code processes this string s.\n\nNow, the second part's logic: process the string s to find the last character that is not a space or '?'. Then check if that character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), case-insensitive.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nFirst, convert the result1 to a string. Let's say s is a character variable. We can use an internal write statement. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result1\n\nBut need to make sure that the length is sufficient. Since result1 can be up to (urdu*(urdu+1)/2)*pandu. But for the purposes of the problem, assuming that the length is enough. Alternatively, use a larger length.\n\nOnce we have the string s, we need to process it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program reads the entire line (nextLine()), so in our case, the string s is exactly the input (since the first program's output is the input to the second). So the string s is the entire input for the second part.\n\nNow, process s to find the last character that is not a space or '?'. So loop from the end of the string backward until we find a character that is not ' ' or '?'. Once found, check if it is a vowel (lowercase).\n\nIn Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. So, for example, s(1: len_trim(s)) gives the actual characters. Wait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with a fixed length, trailing spaces are added. So when we write to s using '(I0)', the rest of the characters are spaces. So len_trim(s) gives the length of the string without trailing spaces. Wait, but in the first part's output, the number is printed without a newline, so the string s is exactly the digits of the number, with no trailing spaces. Because in Java, the first program's print statement outputs exactly the number as a string, so the Fortran's s should be exactly that. So when we write to s using '(I0)', the variable s will have the number followed by spaces to fill the length. But len_trim(s) would give the length of the number's string. Wait, but in the second Java program, the input is the entire line, which in this case is the number's string (without any spaces unless the first program's output had them). Since the first program's output is just the number, the string s in Fortran should be exactly the digits, so the trailing spaces in the Fortran variable are irrelevant because we need to process the actual characters of the output. Hmm, perhaps better to use an unformatted write or adjust the length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a character variable of sufficient length, and then process each character from the end backward until we find a non-space and non-? character.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. Convert result1 to a string s. The string s is exactly the digits of result1, with no leading or trailing spaces (since the first Java program's print statement would output exactly that). But in Fortran, when writing to a character variable with a fixed length, the rest is filled with spaces. So for example, if s is length 20 and result1 is 123, then s would be '123' followed by 17 spaces. So when processing, we need to ignore those trailing spaces. So the actual content is the first len_trim(s) characters. Wait, but in the second Java program, the input is the entire line, which in this case is the number's string (without any spaces unless the first program's output had them). Since the first program's output is just the number, the input to the second program is exactly the number's string, so in Fortran, the s variable's content is the number followed by spaces, but the actual input is the number's digits. So when processing, we need to consider the actual digits and ignore the trailing spaces. So the loop in the second part should process the string s, starting from the end (the last character of the actual string, which is the last non-space character?), but perhaps the spaces in the Fortran variable are considered as part of the string. Wait, in the second Java program, the input is the first program's output, which is the number as a string (without any spaces unless the number itself has them, but numbers don't have spaces). So the input to the second program is exactly the digits of the number. So in Fortran, the s variable's content is the digits followed by spaces, but the actual input is the digits. So when processing, the loop should start from the end of the s string (the last character of the allocated length) and move backward until it finds a non-space and non-? character. But since the first program's output doesn't have any spaces or '?', the last character of the actual number is the last digit, and the rest are spaces. So the loop will find the last digit as the first non-space and non-? character. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so the string s is the digits followed by spaces. So the first non-space character from the end is the last digit. So the code will pick that digit, check if it's a vowel.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is looking for the last character in the string that is not a space or '?'. Since the first program's output is a number, which has no spaces or '?', the last character of the actual string (the digits) is the last digit. So the code will pick that digit's character, convert to lowercase, and check if it's a vowel.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nLoop from the end of the string s backward to the beginning:\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\nWait, but len_trim(s) gives the length of the string without trailing spaces. So the actual characters are from 1 to len_trim(s). So the loop can start at len_trim(s) and go down to 1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string is stored as a fixed-length array, so s(1) is the first character, s(2) the second, etc. So the actual content is up to len_trim(s). So the loop should start at the end of the actual content (len_trim(s)), and go backward until it finds a character that is not a space or '?'. Since the first program's output is a number, there are no spaces or '?', so the first character from the end (the last digit) is the one to take.\n\nOnce found, check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), case-insensitive. Since the first program's output is a number, the character is a digit (0-9), which are not vowels. Wait a second! Wait, the first program's output is a number, so the string s is a sequence of digits. So the last character (the last digit) is a digit (0-9), which are not vowels. So the second program would output \"NO\" in all cases except if the last digit is a vowel? But digits are 0-9, which are not vowels. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the second Java program is supposed to process the output of the first program, which is a number. So the input to the second program is a string of digits. The last non-space and non-? character is the last digit. But digits are not vowels, so the second program would always output \"NO\". But that can't be the case. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the second Java program is from codeforces_49_A. Let me recheck its code.\n\nThe second Java program reads a string s, then loops from the end backward to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), case-insensitive.\n\nSo if the input to the second program is a number (like \"123\"), then the last non-space and non-? character is '3', which is a digit. Since digits are not vowels, the output is \"NO\".\n\nBut in the problem's setup, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is a number string, so the second program will always output \"NO\". But that's only if the first program's output is a number. But perhaps the first program's output could be a string with other characters? No, the first program's output is either 0 or c - vundu, which are numbers. So the second program's input is a number string, so the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nWait, but that's strange. Maybe I misunderstood the problem's setup. Let me recheck the Java code for the second program.\n\nAh, the second Java program's code is from codeforces_49_A. Looking at the code:\n\nThe second program reads a string s via nextLine(). Then loops from the end backward to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase). So if the input is a number, like \"123\", then the last character is '3', which is not a vowel, so output is \"NO\".\n\nBut perhaps the first program's output could be a string with letters? No, the first program outputs a number. So the second program's input is a number string, so the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nWait, but that would mean that the second program's output is always \"NO\", but that's only if the first program's output is a number. But maybe the first program's output can be a string with letters? No, the first program's code is:\n\nif (c < vundu) {\n    System.out.print(\"0\");\n} else {\n    System.out.print(c - vundu);\n}\n\nSo the output is either \"0\" (a single character) or a number (like \"123\"). So the second program's input is a string of digits. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nHmm, but that's a problem. Unless there's a case where the first program's output is a string with letters. But according to the code, it's not possible. So perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the second program's input is a string that may have letters, but in this particular case, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's output is always \"NO\".\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me recheck the problem's description again.\n\nThe user provided two Java programs. The first one's output is a number (either 0 or c - vundu). The second program's input is that number as a string. So the second program's input is a string of digits. Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut that's a bit odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code?\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code again:\n\nThe first program's output is either \"0\" or c - vundu. So \"0\" is a single character, which is a digit. So the second program's input is a string of digits, so the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem requires that the second program's input is the first program's output, which is a number, so the second program's output is \"NO\" unless the number's last digit is a vowel. But digits are 0-9, so the only possible vowel digit is '0'? No, 0 is not a vowel. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output can be a negative number? Let me see:\n\nThe first program's code says:\n\nif (c < vundu) {\n    System.out.print(\"0\");\n} else {\n    System.out.print(c - vundu);\n}\n\nSo c is the sum of i*pandu from 1 to urdu. Since pandu and urdu are longs read from input, which can be positive or negative? Wait, in Java, nextLong() can read negative numbers. So if pandu is negative, then the sum could be negative. But then c could be less than vundu even if the sum is negative. For example, if vundu is 100, and c is -5, then c < vundu, so output 0. But if c is 150 and vundu is 100, then output 50.\n\nBut in any case, the output is a number (could be negative). So the second program's input is a string like \"-123\", which has a '-', which is not a vowel. So the last non-space and non-? character is '3', so again \"NO\".\n\nHmm, so in all cases, the second program would output \"NO\". But that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program, but the second program's code is different. Let me recheck the second Java program's code.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nIt reads a string s via nextLine(). Then loops from the end backward to find the first character not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase). So if the input is \"a? \", then the last non-space and non-? is 'a', so output YES.\n\nBut in our case, the input is a number string, so the last character is a digit, so output is NO.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program will always output \"NO\" unless the first program's output is a string with a vowel at the end. But according to the first program's code, that's not possible. So the second program's output is always \"NO\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output can be a string with letters? Like if the first program's output is \"0\" (a single '0'), then the second program's input is \"0\", so the last character is '0', which is not a vowel. So output is \"NO\".\n\nHmm, so the final Fortran program will always output \"NO\" unless the first program's output is a string like \"a\", but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the second program's input is a string with letters, but in this particular case, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's output is \"NO\".\n\nBut regardless, I have to translate the code as per the given Java programs, even if the result is always \"NO\".\n\nNow, proceeding to code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables for the first part:\n\ninteger*8 :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, result1\n\nRead them from input:\n\nread(*,*) pandu, vundu, urdu\n\nCompute c:\n\nc = pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2\n\nThen compute result1:\n\nif (c < vundu) then\n    result1 = 0\nelse\n    result1 = c - vundu\nend if\n\nThen convert result1 to a string s.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen process s to find the last non-space and non-? character.\n\nInitialize ch as a default (maybe 0, but in Fortran, characters are different). Let's use a character variable.\n\ncharacter :: ch = ' '\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n    if (s(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s(i:i) /= '?') then\n        ch = s(i:i)\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen convert ch to lowercase.\n\nch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)  ! assuming uppercase to lowercase. But need to check if it's uppercase.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert to lowercase, we can use the ichar and achar functions. For example:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n    ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\nend if\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function, but I think it's better to do it manually.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the code uses Character.toLowerCase(ch). So in Fortran, we need to handle that.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: ich\n\nich = ichar(ch)\nif (ich >= ichar('A') .and. ich <= ichar('Z')) then\n    ch = achar(ich + 32)\nelse if (ich >= ichar('a') .and. ich <= ichar('z')) then\n    ! already lowercase\nelse\n    ! not a letter, so it can't be a vowel\nend if\n\nBut since in our case, the character is a digit or '-', etc., but let's proceed.\n\nThen check if ch is a vowel.\n\nlogical :: is_vowel\nis_vowel = (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y')\n\nThen output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nprint *, 'YES' if is_vowel else 'NO'\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the print statement can be:\n\nif (is_vowel) then\n    print *, 'YES'\nelse\n    print *, 'NO'\nend if\n\nNow, putting all the steps into code.\n\nBut let me check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the loop to find the last non-space and non-? character:\n\nThe loop starts from the end of the string (len_trim(s)), moving backward. The first character that is not a space or '?' is taken as ch. Since the first program's output is a number, there are no spaces or '?', so the first character from the end (the last character of the number) is the last digit. So ch is that digit's character.\n\nThen converting to lowercase: digits are already lowercase, so no change. Then check if it's a vowel. Since it's a digit, the check will be false, so output \"NO\".\n\nBut the code must be written as per the second Java program's logic, even if the result is always \"NO\".\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer*8 :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, result1\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    character :: ch\n    logical :: is_vowel\n\n    ! First part: compute result1\n    read(*,*) pandu, vundu, urdu\n    c = pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2\n    if (c < vundu) then\n        result1 = 0\n    else\n        result1 = c - vundu\n    end if\n\n    ! Convert result1 to string s\n    write(s, '(I0)') result1\n\n    ! Second part: process s to find last non-space and non-? character\n    ch = ' '  ! default\n    do i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n        if (s(i:i) /= ' ' .and. s(i:i) /= '?') then\n            ch = s(i:i)\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert to lowercase\n    if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n        ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n    end if\n\n    ! Check if vowel\n    is_vowel = (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y')\n\n    ! Output\n    if (is_vowel) then\n        print *, 'YES'\n    else\n        print *, 'NO'\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's code, the second Java program uses nextLine(), which includes the newline character? Or not? The first program's output is printed with System.out.print, so no newline. So the second program's input is exactly the first program's output (the number as a string) without a newline. So the string s in Fortran is exactly that, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the write statement for the string may have leading spaces if the number is shorter than the allocated length. Wait, no. The write(s, '(I0)') will write the number into s starting at the first character, and the rest are filled with spaces. So the actual content is the number followed by spaces. So len_trim(s) gives the length of the number's string. The loop from len_trim(s) down to 1 will process the actual characters of the number.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"123\".\n\nThen s is \"123\" followed by 17 spaces. len_trim(s) is 3. The loop starts at 3, checks s(3:3) is '3', which is not space or '?', so ch is '3'. Then converting to lowercase (still '3'), check if it's a vowel: no. Output \"NO\".\n\nAnother example: first program outputs \"0\".\n\nThen s is \"0\" followed by 19 spaces. len_trim(s) is 1. The loop takes '0', which is not a vowel. Output \"NO\".\n\nAnother case: first program outputs \"-5\".\n\nThen s is \"-5\" followed by 18 spaces. len_trim(s) is 2. The loop takes '5', which is not a vowel. Output \"NO\".\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if the first program's output is a very large number, like 1e18? The Fortran variables are integer*8, which can handle that. The string length is 20, which may be insufficient. For example, 1e18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros, which is 19 characters. So a length of 20 is okay. But if the number is larger, like 1e20, then 21 digits would need a longer string. But the problem's original Java code uses nextLong(), which can handle up to 2^63-1, which is about 19 digits. So 20 characters should be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, use a larger length, like 40.\n\nBut the problem says to translate the sequence, so as long as the code works for the same inputs as the Java code, it's okay. So using 20 is acceptable.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting the character to lowercase. Suppose the character is already lowercase, then no problem. If it's uppercase, it converts. But in our case, the first program's output is a number, so the character is a digit or '-', so no change.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
