Wait, but in the first part, when current is '0', the first part's code sets dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1], then the second part adds (dp[i][1] *2) to it, so the total is 3*dp[i][1].

Then, the loop over s from 0 to 1:\n\ns=0: bits are 0. t=0. Not equal to p=1. s=1: bit 0 is set. t = a(1) =1. So matches p. So ans1=1. The string is \"1\".

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a result. The second takes that output as input and processes further. But in Fortran, I have to combine them so that the first's output is the input for the second, but without any actual I/O in between. So I need to handle all the data passing internally.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does.\n\nLooking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC128_C):\n\nIt reads N and M. Then for M times, it reads k followed by k numbers, which are indices (0-based?), and for each of those indices, it sets a bit in an array 'a' (each element is an integer, probably a bitmask). Then it reads M numbers (x's) and constructs a value p by shifting each x into its position. Then it iterates over all subsets of the N elements (since it's 1<<N), for each subset, it computes a bitwise XOR of the a[i] where the subset's bit is set. If that equals p, it increments the answer. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC129_E):\n\nIt reads a string, then uses a DP approach. The DP array is 2D, tracking two states (maybe whether the current number is less than or equal to the original). The transitions depend on the current character. The final result is the sum of the two states modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the 'ans' variable, which is an integer. The second program expects a string input. Wait, that's a problem. Because the first program outputs a number, but the second expects a string. How can that be? Unless there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first outputs an integer, and the second expects a string (since it reads a line with nextLine()). That can't be right. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's printing an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake here?\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is System.out.println(ans); where ans is an integer. The second program's first line is sc.nextLine(). So the input to the second program is a string, which would be the output of the first. But the first's output is a number, so the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"5\", then the second's input is \"5\".\n\nWait, but the second program's problem might be expecting a string input, like a sequence of digits. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as a string to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. So the Fortran program must take the initial input for the first program, compute the first's output (the integer ans), then pass that as a string to the second program's processing.\n\nTherefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) will compute the integer ans1. Then, the second part (equivalent to the second Java program) will take that ans1 as a string input (i.e., convert it to a string, then process it as the input string for the DP part).\n\nWait, but how exactly does the second Java program process its input? Let me re-examine the second Java code.\n\nThe second Java program's first line is:\n\nchar[] s = sc.nextLine().toCharArray();\n\nSo the input is a single line, which is read as a string, then converted to a character array. So the input to the second program is a string, which is the output of the first program. Since the first program outputs an integer, the second program's input is that integer as a string. For example, if the first outputs 123, the second's input is \"123\".\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's ans, we need to convert that integer to a string, then process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (N, M, etc.), compute ans1 (the first program's output).\n\n2. Convert ans1 to a string s.\n\n3. Use s as the input for the second program's processing (the DP part), compute the final result.\n\n4. Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program):\n\nVariables:\n\n- N and M are integers read from input.\n\n- The array 'a' is an array of integers (size N), each representing a bitmask of M bits (since M is up to, say, 1e5? Wait, but in the code, M is the number of bits? Let me see the first Java code again.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, for each of M times, they read k, then k numbers s. Each s is an index (0-based?), and for each s, they set a[s] |= (1 << i), where i is the current loop index (from 0 to M-1). So each of the M loops corresponds to a bit in the bitmask. So the a array's elements are integers with up to M bits. Since M can be up to, say, 1e5? Wait, but in the code, the loop for M is up to M iterations, but the bitmask for a[i] would need to have M bits. However, in Java, integers are 32 bits, so if M exceeds 32, this would overflow. Wait, but in the problem's context, perhaps M is small enough. Let me check the problem's constraints. Since the user hasn't provided them, but the code uses integers, perhaps M is up to 30 or so? Because otherwise, the bitmask approach would not work. For example, in the first problem, the code loops over all subsets of N elements (1<<N), so N must be small enough (like up to 20, since 2^20 is about a million). So M is probably up to 20 as well. So in Fortran, using integers (probably 32-bit) would be okay.\n\nSo in Fortran, the array 'a' can be an array of integers (integer*4 or integer*8, but let's see).\n\nThe first part's steps:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize an array a of size N, all zeros.\n\nThen for each of M times (i from 0 to M-1):\n\nRead k, then read k numbers s (each 1-based? Wait, in the Java code, s is read as sc.nextInt(), then s-- is done. So the input s is 1-based, converted to 0-based. So in Fortran, when reading, we need to subtract 1 from each s.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int j=0; j<k; j++) {\n\n    int s = sc.nextInt();\n\n    s--;\n\n    a.set(s, a.get(s) | (1 << i));\n\n}\n\nSo each s is 1-based in input, converted to 0-based in the array.\n\nSo in Fortran, when reading the s values, we need to subtract 1 from each to get the correct index (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but maybe we can use 0-based with adjustment).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So perhaps better to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the array a can be of size N, with indices 1 to N. So when the input s is 1-based, we can use it directly (since in Java it was converted to 0-based, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so no need to subtract 1. Wait, let me think:\n\nIn Java, the array a is 0-based (since the loop is for i from 0 to N-1). The input s is 1-based, so s is converted to 0-based by s--.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array a is 1-based, then the input s (1-based) can be used directly. So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nread *, s\n\na(s) = a(s) OR (1 << i)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop for M is from 1 to M (since in Java it's 0-based for i from 0 to M-1). So in Fortran, the loop variable i would be from 1 to M, and the bitmask would be (1 << (i-1)), since in Java it was 1 << i (where i starts at 0). So that's an important point.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for the M loops (i from 0 to M-1), each iteration corresponds to the i-th bit (since 1 << i). So in Fortran, if we loop i from 1 to M, then the exponent would be (i-1).\n\nSo that's a key point to get right.\n\nThen, after processing all M constraints, the code reads M numbers x, and constructs p as p |= (x << i). Wait, in Java:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<M; i++) {\n\n    int x = sc.nextInt();\n\n    p |= (x << i);\n\n}\n\nWait, so for each x, it's shifted left by i bits. So the first x (i=0) is shifted by 0, so added to p as x. The second x (i=1) is shifted by 1, etc. So the bits of p are set based on the x values. Each x is either 0 or 1? Because in the problem, perhaps each x is a bit (0 or 1) that needs to be set in p's bits. So the code is building p as a bitmask where the i-th bit (starting from 0) is x's value.\n\nWait, but in the code, x is read as an integer, and then shifted left by i bits. So for example, if x is 1, then (x << i) is 1 shifted left by i, so the (i)th bit is set. If x is 0, then it contributes nothing. So p is the bitmask of the x's bits.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same logic applies. So after reading all M x's, p is built as the OR of (x_i << (i-1)), since in Fortran the loop is from 1 to M (if we use 1-based), so the exponent is (i-1).\n\nWait, let me re-express the Java code's p construction:\n\nJava:\n\np starts at 0.\n\nfor (i from 0 to M-1):\n\n    x = sc.nextInt();\n\n    p |= (x << i);\n\nSo in Fortran, if we have a loop variable i from 1 to M, then the exponent is (i-1). So:\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read *, x\n\n    p = p OR (x * 2**(i-1))\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nThen, the main loop is over all subsets s of the N elements. Each subset is represented as a bitmask from 0 to 2^N -1. For each subset s, we compute t as the XOR of a[i] for each bit set in s. If t equals p, increment ans.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop over s can be done with a do loop from 0 to 2**N -1. But in Fortran, integers can be up to 32 bits, so N must be small (like up to 20). The problem's constraints probably allow that.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the first part would be:\n\nRead N and M.\n\nInitialize array a(1:N) = 0.\n\nThen loop over M times (i from 1 to M):\n\n    read *, k\n\n    then read k integers s (each 1-based, so no adjustment needed)\n\n    for each s in the k numbers:\n\n        a(s) = a(s) OR (2**(i-1))\n\nThen read M x's:\n\n    p = 0\n\n    do i = 1, M\n\n        read *, x\n\n        p = p OR (x * 2**(i-1))\n\n    end do\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo s = 0, 2**N -1\n\n    t = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        if (btest(s, i-1)) then  ! since s is a bitmask where the 0th bit is the first element (since in Java it was 0-based)\n\n            t = ieor(t, a(i))\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (t == p) then\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) to N-1 (MSB) for the subset s. So for the subset s, the bits correspond to the elements 1 to N. So for each element i (1-based), the bit position is i-1. So the test is whether the (i-1)th bit is set in s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part (Java's second program):\n\nThe second program reads a string, then uses a DP approach. Let's see:\n\nThe input is a string s (from the first program's output, which is an integer, so the string is the digits of that integer).\n\nThe DP array is dp[n+1][2], where n is the length of the string. The initial state is dp[0][0] = 1.\n\nThe transitions depend on the current character and the state (0 or 1). The modulo is 1e9+7.\n\nThe code in Java is a bit complex. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n    }\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n        dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe first part of the loop (the first if-else) handles some transitions, then the second part (another if-else) adds more.\n\nWait, perhaps the code has two separate conditions for each character. Let me re-express the code:\n\nFor each character in the string (index i from 0 to n-1):\n\nFirst part:\n\nif current char is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nSecond part:\n\nif current char is '0':\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n    then mod M again\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M\n\n    then mod both\n\nHmm, this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way to structure it, but I need to translate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is combining two different transitions. Let me think of the DP states.\n\nThe DP states are probably:\n\ndp[i][0] = number of ways to form a number up to the i-th character that is strictly less than the original prefix.\n\ndp[i][1] = number of ways to form a number equal to the original prefix up to i.\n\nWait, maybe the second dimension is whether the current number is already less than the original (state 0) or exactly equal (state 1). So transitions depend on the current digit and the state.\n\nBut the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nFirst part of the loop:\n\nIf the current character is '0':\n\n- For state 0 (already less than), the next state 0 remains the same (since adding a 0 doesn't change the less than condition).\n\n- For state 1 (exactly equal so far), the next state 1 remains the same (since the next digit must also be 0 to stay equal).\n\nElse (current character is not '0'):\n\n- For state 1 (exactly equal so far), the next digit must be equal to the current character. But since the current character is not 0, perhaps the next state 1 can only be achieved if we choose the current character. But the code sets dp[i+1][1] to the sum of dp[i][0] and dp[i][1]. Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is handling transitions where the next digit must be exactly the current character (to stay in state 1), and the second part is adding possibilities where digits can be chosen freely (but in state 0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is combining two different cases. Let me see the code again.\n\nWait, the first part of the code (the first if-else) is setting the next state's values, and then the second part adds more to them based on the character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the first part handles transitions when the next digit must be exactly the current character (to stay in state 1), and the second part adds transitions where digits can be chosen freely (for state 0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is handling two separate conditions for each character, and the order matters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written with some redundancy, but I need to translate it as is.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic must be translated exactly as written.\n\nIn Fortran, the DP array can be a 2D array of integers, with dimensions (0:n, 2), where n is the length of the string.\n\nThe initial condition is dp(0,0) = 1, dp(0,1)=0.\n\nWait, in the Java code, dp[0][0] =1, and dp[0][1] is 0 (since it's initialized to 0). So in Fortran, we can initialize the array with dp(0,1) =0, and dp(0,0)=1.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1 (since the string is 0-based in Java, but in Fortran, the string is 1-based?), wait, in Fortran, the string will be read as a character array, perhaps with indices 1 to len_trim(s).\n\nWait, in Fortran, when reading a string, we can read it as a character array. Let me think:\n\nThe second part's input is the string representation of the first program's output (ans1). So in Fortran, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the DP.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\n1. Convert the integer ans1 to a string s.\n\n2. Compute the length n = len_trim(s).\n\n3. Initialize the DP array (size (n+1) x 2).\n\n4. Process each character in s (from first to last) to update the DP array.\n\n5. The final result is (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the string can be stored as a character array. Let's say s is a character array of length, say, 20 (since the first program's output is an integer which can be up to 2^20, which is about 1e6, so 7 digits max, but maybe more if N is up to 20, but 2^20 is 1,048,576 which is 7 digits. So a length of 20 is sufficient).\n\nSo in code:\n\nAfter computing ans1 (the first part's result), we can write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans1\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nThen, the DP array can be declared as integer, dimension(0:n, 0:1), with modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can set the lower bounds. Alternatively, use 0-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based for the first dimension (since in Java it's 0 to n, but in Fortran, we can have 0 to n by declaring the array as (0:n, 0:1)).\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: dp(0:n, 0:1)\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\ndp(0,1) = 0\n\nThen loop over each character in the string s (from 1 to n, since Fortran strings are 1-based).\n\nWait, the first character is s(1), which corresponds to the first character in the string (the first digit of ans1).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the string is read with nextLine(), so leading zeros? Not sure, but the code in Java uses nextLine().toCharArray(), so the entire line is read as the string, including any leading zeros? Well, the first program's output is an integer, so it won't have leading zeros unless it's zero. So the string s in the second program is the numeric string of ans1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the string s is correctly formed.\n\nNow, the loop over each character:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    current_char = s(i)\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n        dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), MOD )\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Second part of the code\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + mod( dp(i-1,0)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first part of the code (the first if-else), the first assignments set dp(i,0) and dp(i,1), but then in the second part, they are modified again. So the order is important.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first part (the first if-else) is executed first, then the second part (the second if-else) is executed. So in Fortran, the code must do the same.\n\nWait, in the first part, for example, if the current character is '0', then dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] are set to the previous values. Then, in the second part, if the character is '0', we add (dp[i-1][1] *2) mod M to dp[i][1].\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part adds to those values. So in Fortran, the code must first compute the first part's assignments, then apply the second part's additions.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe first part (the first if-else) sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nThen, the second part (the second if-else) adds to those values.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code must first compute the first part's assignments, then add the second part's contributions.\n\nWait, in the first part, for example, if the character is '0', then dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0], and dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1].\n\nThen, in the second part, if the character is '0', then dp[i][1] += (dp[i-1][1] *2) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the second part's first condition (if current is '0') adds to dp[i+1][1] the value (dp[i][1] *2). Wait, in the Java code, the second part's first condition is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, so in the second part, the addition is based on the previous dp[i][1], not the current dp[i+1][1] from the first part. Wait, no, in Java, the first part sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part adds to those values.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe first part (first if-else) sets the initial values for dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nThen, the second part (second if-else) adds to those values.\n\nSo in the second part's first case (current is '0'), the code adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. Wait, no, in the code:\n\nIn the second part's first case (current is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\nWait, the dp[i][1] is the previous value (before the first part's assignment). Or is it the current dp[i+1][1]?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first part's assignments are to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], then the second part's code adds to those same variables. So the second part's code uses the previous dp[i][1]?\n\nWait, no, the second part's code is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n\n}\n\nWait, the term (dp[i][1] *2) is from the previous step (before the first part's assignments). Because in the first part, the first part's assignments are to dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], but the second part's code uses dp[i][1], which is from the previous step (before processing this character).\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me re-express the Java code's steps for a single iteration:\n\nLet me take an example step for i (the loop variable in Java is from 0 to n-1):\n\nOriginal dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] are known.\n\nFirst part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0'):\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\nSecond part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0'):\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    then mod M\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    then mod both\n\nWait, so in the second part, the additions are based on the previous dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], not the current dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, no, in the second part's code, the first part's assignments have already been done, but the additions are to the dp[i+1][...] variables. However, the terms being added are based on the previous dp[i][...] values.\n\nWait, the code in the second part's first case (current is '0'):\n\nThe code adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1]. So the first part's assignments set dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1], then the second part adds (dp[i][1] *2) to it. So the total becomes dp[i][1] + (dp[i][1] *2) = 3*dp[i][1].\n\nWait, but in the first part, when current is '0', the first part's code sets dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1], then the second part adds (dp[i][1] *2) to it, so the total is 3*dp[i][1].\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. So in Fortran, the code must first compute the first part's assignments, then add the terms from the second part, which depend on the previous dp[i][...] values.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n (since the string is 1-based in Fortran):\n\nFirst, compute the first part's assignments:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    temp0 = dp(i-1,0)\n\n    temp1 = dp(i-1,1)\n\nelse\n\n    temp0 = dp(i-1,0)  ! Not sure, but the first part's first case sets dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], the else case only sets dp[i][1]?\n\nWait, in the first part's else clause (current is not '0'), the code sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, but what about dp[i+1][0]?\n\nAh, in the first part's else clause, the code only sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before. Wait, no, in the Java code, the first part's else clause only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? Or is it that the first part's else clause leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first part's else clause (current is not '0'):\n\nThe code does:\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\nBut what about dp[i+1][0]? The code doesn't set it, so it remains as whatever it was initialized to (probably 0, but in Java, arrays are initialized to 0, so if the first part's first clause (if) didn't set it, then it would be 0. Wait, but in the first part's else clause, the first part's code only sets dp[i+1][1], and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0 (since it was initialized to 0 before the loop? Or is it that the first part's code only sets the relevant parts?\n\nWait, in Java, the code for the first part is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\n}\n\nSo in the else clause, dp[i+1][0] is not set, so it remains as whatever it was before. But since the array is initialized to 0, and in the first iteration, for example, when i=0, the first part's else clause would leave dp[1][0] as 0, but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, the first part's if clause sets both dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1], but the else clause only sets dp[i+1][1]. So in the else case, dp[i+1][0] remains as 0 (since it was initialized to 0 before the loop). But that's incorrect, because in the first part's else clause, perhaps dp[i+1][0] should be 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the first part's code is incomplete. Maybe the first part's else clause should set dp[i+1][0] to 0, but the code doesn't do that. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code again:\n\nThe first part's code for the else clause (current is not '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n\nBut what about dp[i+1][0]? It's not set here, so it remains as whatever it was before. Since the array is initialized to 0, and in the first iteration, for example, when i=0, the first part's else clause would leave dp[1][0] as 0. But perhaps that's correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part's code is supposed to set dp[i+1][0] to 0 in the else case. But the code doesn't do that. So perhaps the code is correct as written, and the first part's else clause leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0, which is correct.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the first character is '1'.\n\nIn the first part's else clause (since it's not '0'), the first part sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M. The dp[i][0] is 1 (from initial state), dp[i][1] is 0. So dp[i+1][1] becomes 1. The dp[i+1][0] remains 0 (since it wasn't set).\n\nThen, in the second part of the code (the else clause again, since current is '1'):\n\nThe code adds to dp[i+1][0] the value (dp[i][0] *2) mod M, and to dp[i+1][1] the value (dp[i][1] *2) mod M.\n\nSo dp[i+1][0] becomes 0 + (1 *2) mod M = 2.\n\ndp[i+1][1] becomes 1 + (0 *2) mod M = 1.\n\nSo after both parts, dp[1][0] is 2, dp[1][1] is 1.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. But the code must be translated as written.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the first part's assignments must be done carefully.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_char = s(i)\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    temp0 = dp(i-1,0)\n\n    temp1 = dp(i-1,1)\n\nelse\n\n    temp0 = 0  ! Because in the else case, the first part's code doesn't set dp[i][0], so it remains 0?\n\n    temp1 = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), MOD )\n\nend if\n\nThen, after the first part, we have temp0 and temp1 as the first part's assignments for dp[i][0] and dp[i][1].\n\nWait, but in the first part's if clause (current is '0'), the first part's code sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to the previous values. So in Fortran, for the first part's if clause, the temp0 and temp1 are the previous values.\n\nThen, the second part of the code (the second if-else) will add to these temp values.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to first compute the first part's values into temporary variables, then apply the second part's additions.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nWe can first compute the first part's assignments into dp(i,0) and dp(i,1), then apply the second part's additions.\n\nWait, let's try to structure it step by step.\n\nInitialize dp(i,0) and dp(i,1) based on the first part.\n\nThen, apply the second part's additions.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst part:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n    dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,0) = 0  !

Or is it that the first part's else clause leaves dp(i,0) as whatever it was before? Since in Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0, but in the first part's else clause, we have to explicitly set dp(i,0) to 0?\n\nHmm, perhaps in the first part's else clause, the first part's code leaves dp[i][0] as 0, so in Fortran, we can set it to 0 explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part's else clause leaves dp[i][0] as 0, so we can set it to 0.\n\nThen, the second part of the code:\n\nif (current_char == '0') then\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\nelse\n\n    dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + mod( dp(i-1,0)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the second part's else clause, the code adds to dp[i][0] the value (dp[i-1][0] *2), and to dp[i][1] the value (dp[i-1][1] *2).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    current_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        !

Ensure modulo is applied\n\n    dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0), MOD )\n\n    dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1), MOD )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the second part's else clause, after adding, we need to mod again. The code above does that by using mod in the assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mod is applied after each addition.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nFinally, the result is (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod MOD.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe program must first read the input for the first Java program, compute ans1, then process ans1 as the input for the second part, compute the final result, and output it.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read N and M.\n\nThen, read M times: for each of the M steps, read k followed by k integers (s values).\n\nThen read M x's.\n\nThen compute the ans1.\n\nThen, convert ans1 to a string s.\n\nThen process s through the DP.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so the a array will be 1-based (indices 1 to N).\n\nThe loop for the M steps (i from 1 to M):\n\nIn each iteration, read k, then read k integers s (each 1-based, so no adjustment needed).\n\nThen, for each s, set a(s) = a(s) OR (2**(i-1)).\n\nWait, in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. So 2**(i-1).\n\nBut in Fortran, integers can be up to 32 bits, so if M is up to 30, that's okay.\n\nThen, after that, read M x's:\n\np = 0\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read *, x\n\n    p = ior( p, btest(x,0) * (2**(i-1)) ) ? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in Java, x is read as an integer, and then shifted left by i bits (in the first program's code, the loop variable i is from 0 to M-1, so in Fortran's loop i from 1 to M, the shift is (i-1).\n\nWait, the code in Java for p is:\n\np |= (x << i) where i is from 0 to M-1.\n\nIn Fortran, for each x in the loop (i from 1 to M):\n\nthe shift is (i-1), so the term is x * 2**(i-1).\n\nBut in Java, x is either 0 or 1 (since it's a bitmask bit). So in Fortran, x is an integer, and the code is:\n\np = p OR (x * 2**(i-1))\n\nBut in Fortran, the OR is done with ior function, but since we are dealing with integers, perhaps using bitwise OR.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the bitwise OR is done with the IOR function for integers. So:\n\np = ior( p, (x * (2**(i-1))) )\n\nWait, but 2** (i-1) is an integer, so x multiplied by that gives the value to OR with p.\n\nWait, but x can be 0 or 1 (assuming the problem's constraints). So if x is 1, then the term is 2^(i-1), else 0. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code for p is:\n\np = 0\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n    read *, x\n\n    p = ior( p, (x * (2**(i-1))) )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the ** operator has higher precedence than *? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, in Fortran, exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication. So 2**(i-1) is computed first, then multiplied by x.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the loop over s (subsets):\n\nans1 = 0\n\ndo s = 0, 2**N -1\n\n    t = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        if (btest(s, i-1)) then\n\n            t = ieor(t, a(i))\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (t == p) then\n\n        ans1 = ans1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, 2**N can be a large number. For N=20, 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable. But for N=20, the loop will run 1,048,576 times. That's okay for a programming competition problem, but in Fortran, loops can handle that.\n\nNow, after computing ans1, we need to convert it to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write statement into a character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_str\n\nwrite(s_str, '(i0)') ans1\n\nThen, the actual string is s_str, but we need to trim it to remove leading spaces.\n\nWait, the 'i0' format writes the integer without leading spaces, so len_trim(s_str) will give the correct length.\n\nn = len_trim(s_str)\n\nThen, the DP array is declared as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n, 0:1) :: dp\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed sizes. Since n can vary, we need to use an allocatable array or a fixed size.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible ans1 is 2^20 (if N=20), which is 1,048,576, so the string length is up to 7 digits. So we can set the array size to 20.\n\nBut to be safe, let's use a fixed size of 20.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter for the maximum possible length.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's set the maximum length to 20.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_str\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_n = 20\n\ninteger, dimension(0:max_n, 0:1) :: dp\n\nThen, after computing n = len_trim(s_str), we can proceed.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array must be declared with a fixed size. So if the string length is up to 20, then the DP array can be dimensioned as (0:max_n, 0:1).\n\nNow, the code for the DP part:\n\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndp(0,0) = 1\n\ndp(0,1) = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    current_char = s_str(i:i)\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n        dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,0) = 0\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), MOD )\n\n    end if\n\n    if (current_char == '0') then\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n    else\n\n        dp(i,0) = mod( dp(i,0) + mod( dp(i-1,0)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n        dp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\n    end if\n\n    !

The array a is allocated with size N. Since N can be up to 20, this is okay.\n\n2. The loop over s from 0 to 2**N -1: in Fortran, 2**N is computed as 2**N, but for N=20, this is 1,048,576, which is manageable.\n\n3. The DP array is dimensioned as 0:20, which is okay since the maximum n is 20.\n\n4. The use of mod function: in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor. Since all values are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, when adding terms, we need to ensure that the mod is applied correctly. For example, in the line:\n\ndp(i,1) = mod( dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), MOD )\n\nThis is correct.\n\nAlso, in the second part's additions, the mod is applied to the terms before adding.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ndp(i,1) = mod( dp(i,1) + mod( dp(i-1,1)*2, MOD ), MOD )\n\nThis ensures that the multiplication is modded first, then added to dp(i,1), then modded again.\n\nAlternatively, it can be written as:\n\ntemp = (dp(i-1,1)*2) mod MOD\n\ndp(i,1) = dp(i,1) + temp\n\ndp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1), MOD)\n\nWhich is the same.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the first part's loop for reading the M x's, the code uses ior(p, (x * 2**(i-1))). But in Fortran, the ior function is for bitwise OR. However, if x is 0 or 1, then x * 2^(i-1) is either 0 or 2^(i-1), so the OR is correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the * operator has higher precedence than the exponentiation? No, exponentiation has higher precedence. So 2**(i-1) is computed first, then multiplied by x.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: in the first part's loop for reading the k s values, the s is read as an integer, and used directly as the index (since in Java it was 1-based). So that's correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose N=1, M=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\nThen:\n\na(1) is set to 1 (since i=1, 2^(0) =1).\n\np is 1 <<0 (since x=1, so 1*1=1.\n\nThen, the loop over s from 0 to 1:\n\ns=0: bits are 0. t=0. Not equal to p=1.\n\ns=1: bit 0 is set. t = a(1) =1. So matches p. So ans1=1.\n\nThe string is \"1\".\n\nThen the second part processes \"1\".\n\nn=1.\n\nProcessing first character '1':\n\nFirst part (else clause):\n\ndp(1,0)=0, dp(1,1)= dp(0,0)+dp(0,1) =1+0=1 mod MOD.\n\nSecond part (else clause):\n\ndp(1,0) += dp(0,0)*2 \u2192 0 +1*2=2 mod MOD.\n\ndp(1,1) += dp(0,1)*2 \u21921 +0*2=1 mod MOD.\n\nSo dp(1,0)=2, dp(1,1)=1.\n\nTotal is 3 mod MOD \u21923.\n\nSo the output is 3.\n\nWhich would be correct?\n\nNot sure, but the code should handle it.\n\nOverall, this should be the correct translation."
