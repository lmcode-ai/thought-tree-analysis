Alternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: str\ninteger :: i\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length unless using allocatable. So perhaps better to use a character array of sufficient length. Let's assume the maximum needed length is 1000.\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do But this might not work because each write would overwrite the previous. Alternatively, using a temporary variable and concatenation:\n\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(temp, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't directly concatenate with assignment like that.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_369_B) reads several integers from input: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. Then it calls getPoints and prints the array. The getPoints function initializes an array with all l's, subtracts some values from sAll and sk, then loops to adjust the array elements. The second Java file (codeforces_49_A) reads a string, checks the last non-space and non-question mark character, and determines if it's a vowel (case-insensitive), then outputs YES or NO.\n\nThe key is to combine these into one Fortran program. The first part (Java File 1) processes the input numbers and produces an array. The second part (Java File 2) takes a string input and outputs a result based on it. Wait, but how are they connected? Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the Java code, the first program outputs the array (the ans array) as space-separated numbers. The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is the input to the second program? But the second program's input is a string, so maybe the first program's output is a string? Wait, the first program's output is the array elements separated by spaces. The second program reads a line as a string. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. But the second program's output is YES or NO, which would be the final output of the entire sequence.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the array, then pass that array as input to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program). But how does the second part process that input?\n\nWait, the second Java program's input is a string. The first program's output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. So the second program's input is that string. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part must generate the array, then convert it into a string (like space-separated numbers), then process that string as the input for the second part's logic.\n\nWait, but in the Fortran program, we can't have intermediate I/O. The first block (equivalent to first Java program) must read the input, process it, and pass the data to the second part (equivalent to second Java program) without writing to output. The second part must then process that data and output the final result.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input. Only the last block should handle producing output. Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\"\n\nSo the entire Fortran program must read the input (the first part's input), process it through both steps (the first Java's processing and the second Java's processing), and then output the final result (the second Java's output).\n\nTherefore, the first Java program's input is the initial input, and its output is the input to the second Java program. The second Java program's output is the final output. So in the Fortran program, the first part (Java 1's logic) must compute the array, then the second part (Java 2's logic) must take that array's string representation as input, process it, and output YES/NO.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a string. The first program's output is the array elements as a space-separated string. So in the Fortran program, after computing the array, we need to convert it into a string (like \"a1 a2 ... an \"), then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first part (n, k, l, r, sAll, sk) from stdin.\n\n2. Compute the array ans using the first Java's getPoints function's logic.\n\n3. Convert the array ans into a space-separated string (like \"5 3 7 ...\").\n\n4. Then, process this string as the input for the second part's logic (the second Java program's processing). The second part's logic is to check the last non-space and non-? character in the string, see if it's a vowel.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a line from stdin. So in the Fortran program, the second part's input is the string generated from the first part's output. So the Fortran program must process that string as if it's the input to the second Java program.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n- Read the first set of inputs (the numbers for the first part).\n\n- Compute the array ans.\n\n- Convert ans into a string (space-separated numbers, with a trailing space? Or without? The Java first program's print loop does \"num + \" \", so each element is followed by a space, so the output is like \"5 3 7 \" with a trailing space. But when the second Java program reads it with nextLine(), it would read the entire line, including the trailing space. So the string would be the numbers separated by spaces, possibly ending with a space. But in Fortran, when building the string, we can just make sure that the elements are space-separated, and perhaps add a trailing space, but the second part's processing would ignore that.\n\n- Then, process this string through the second part's logic.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as a line (nextLine()), so the entire line is the string. So in the Fortran program, the first part's output is the string that the second part processes. So the second part's processing is done on that string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after generating the array, we need to create a string that is the space-separated elements of the array, then process that string as per the second Java's logic.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's logic (the getPoints function):\n\nThe getPoints function in Java initializes an array of size n with all elements set to l. Then subtracts sk and (n-k)*l from sAll. Then sk is adjusted by subtracting k*l. Then there are two loops: first, while sk>0, increment the last k elements (starting from the end) until sk is 0. Then, while sAll>0, increment the first (n-k) elements until sAll is 0.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nThe code in getPoints:\n\nint[] ans = new int[n];\nArrays.fill(ans, l);\nsAll -= sk + (n - k)*l;\nsk -= k*l;\n\nWait, the initial sAll is the input sAll. The code subtracts sk (the input sk?) plus (n -k)*l. Wait, perhaps I need to retrace the code step by step.\n\nWait, the initial array is filled with l. The total sum of the array is n*l. The problem's parameters probably have constraints such that the desired total is sAll, and the sum of the first k elements must be exactly sk. So the code is trying to adjust the array to meet those constraints.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nInitially, all elements are l. The sum of the array is n*l. The code then subtracts sk (the desired sum of the first k elements?) plus (n -k)*l from sAll. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to adjust the array so that the first k elements sum to sk, and the remaining (n-k) elements are as high as possible (or something else). Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's first step is to set all elements to l. Then:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l;\n\nWait, that's sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l). Then sk is adjusted by sk -= k*l. So sk becomes sk - k*l.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is that the first k elements are set to l, so their sum is k*l. The remaining (n-k) elements are also l, so their sum is (n-k)*l. The total sum is n*l. The code then subtracts sk (the desired sum of the first k elements?) plus (n-k)*l (the sum of the remaining elements) from sAll. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to adjust the array so that the first k elements sum to sk, and the total sum is sAll. Let me see:\n\nThe code's logic:\n\nAfter filling the array with l, the sum of the array is n*l. The code then subtracts sk (the desired first k sum?) plus (n-k)*l (the sum of the remaining elements) from sAll. So sAll becomes sAll - (sk + (n-k)*l). Then sk is adjusted by subtracting k*l (the initial sum of the first k elements). So sk becomes sk - k*l. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the first k elements need to have a total of sk. The initial sum of the first k elements is k*l. So the difference between sk and that is (sk - k*l) which is the amount to distribute among the first k elements. But the code's first loop is while sk>0, which after adjustment, sk is (original sk - k*l). So if sk was originally larger than k*l, then sk becomes positive, and the code increments the last elements (the first k elements?) until sk is 0. Wait, the code's first loop:\n\nwhile (sk > 0) {\n    int idx = n -1;\n    while (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) {\n        ans[idx] +=1;\n        sk--;\n        idx--;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the inner loop starts at the end (n-1) and moves backward until it reaches n -k (since idx >= n -k). So the first k elements (indices from n-k to n-1) are being incremented. Each time, sk is decremented. So this loop is adding 1 to each of the last k elements until sk reaches 0. So the total added to the first k elements (wait, no, the last k elements?) Wait, the indices from n-k to n-1 are the last k elements. So the first loop is distributing the sk (after adjustment) to the last k elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the first part of the code is ensuring that the first k elements sum to sk. The initial sum of the first k elements is k*l. The desired sum is sk, so the difference is (sk - k*l). The code's sk variable after the adjustment is sk = original_sk - k*l. So if sk (original) was larger than k*l, then the adjusted sk is positive, and the code adds 1 to each of the last k elements (the first k elements?) Wait, no, the indices are from n-1 down to n-k. So the last k elements. Wait, perhaps the first k elements are the first k elements, but the code is modifying the last k elements. That might be a mistake, but I have to follow the code as written.\n\nWait, the code's first loop is modifying the last k elements (indices n-k to n-1). So the first k elements (indices 0 to k-1) are not being modified here. Wait, but the problem's constraints might require that the first k elements have a total of sk. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the code's logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set the first k elements to have a total of sk, and the remaining elements to be as large as possible (up to r?), but the code's logic may not be considering the r constraint. Wait, the original Java code's parameters include r, but in the code provided, the r is not used. Wait, looking at the code for getPoints, the parameters are n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. But in the code, the r is not used. That's odd. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the code for getPoints:\n\nThe code initializes the array to l, then subtracts sk + (n-k)*l from sAll. Then sk is adjusted by subtracting k*l. Then the loops. The code doesn't use r. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the code is incomplete? Or perhaps the problem's constraints are such that the code is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the code is from a problem where the r is a maximum per element, but the code isn't handling it. Hmm, but the user provided the code as is, so I have to translate it as is, even if it's possibly incorrect. So in the Fortran code, I must replicate exactly what the Java code does, even if it doesn't use r.\n\nSo proceeding with that.\n\nNow, the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nWe need to read n, k, l, r, sAll, sk from input. Then compute the array ans as per the Java code.\n\nThe steps for the array:\n\nInitialize ans array of size n, all elements l.\n\nCompute sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\nWait, original sAll is the input sAll. So sAll = sAll - (input_sk + (n-k)*l). Wait, no, the code does:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l;\n\nWait, the code subtracts sk (the input sk) plus (n-k)*l from sAll. So sAll becomes sAll - (input_sk + (n-k)*l). Then sk is adjusted by sk -= k*l. So sk becomes input_sk - k*l.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to set the first k elements to have a total of input_sk. The initial sum of the first k elements is k*l. So the difference between input_sk and that is (input_sk - k*l) = (sk after adjustment). So the code's first loop adds 1 to the last k elements (indices n-k to n-1) until sk reaches 0. Wait, but that would be adding to the last k elements, not the first. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but I have to follow the code as written.\n\nWait, the code's first loop:\n\nThe inner loop starts at idx = n-1 (the last element) and goes down to n -k (the (n-k)th element, which is the first element of the last k elements). So the last k elements are being incremented. The sk variable is the adjusted sk (input_sk - k*l). So if input_sk was larger than k*l, then sk is positive, and the code adds 1 to each of the last k elements until sk is 0. So the total added to the last k elements is (input_sk - k*l). So the sum of the last k elements becomes (k*l) + (input_sk -k*l) = input_sk. Wait, but the first k elements (indices 0 to k-1) are still at l. So the sum of the first k elements is k*l, and the last k elements sum to input_sk. But the problem's requirement might be that the first k elements sum to input_sk. So this code might be incorrect, but since the user provided it, I have to translate it as is.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nwhile sAll >0:\n\n   idx starts at 0, and increments until sAll is 0. So the first (n -k) elements (indices 0 to n-k-1) are being incremented. Each time, sAll decreases by 1. So the total added to the first (n-k) elements is sAll_initial (after the first subtraction). \n\nWait, the sAll after the first step is sAll_initial - (input_sk + (n-k)*l). Then, after the first loop, the remaining sAll is used to add to the first (n-k) elements. \n\nSo the total sum of the array after all steps would be:\n\nInitial sum: n*l\n\nThen, the first loop adds (input_sk -k*l) to the last k elements (since sk was input_sk -k*l, and each increment adds 1 until sk is 0). So the sum increases by (input_sk -k*l).\n\nThen, the second loop adds sAll_initial - (input_sk + (n-k)*l) to the first (n-k) elements. \n\nTotal sum becomes:\n\nn*l + (input_sk -k*l) + (sAll_initial - input_sk - (n-k)*l) \n\n= n*l + input_sk -k*l + sAll_initial - input_sk - (n-k)*l \n\n= n*l -k*l - (n-k)*l + sAll_initial \n\n= n*l -k*l -n*l +k*l + sAll_initial \n\n= sAll_initial \n\nSo the total sum is sAll_initial, which matches the problem's requirement. \n\nSo the code is correct in that aspect, even if the first k elements are not the ones being adjusted for their sum. \n\nNow, in Fortran, to implement this:\n\nFirst, read the variables n, k, l, r, sAll, sk from input. \n\nThen, allocate an array ans of size n, initialize all elements to l.\n\nThen compute sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n\nsk = sk - k*l\n\nThen, the first loop:\n\ndo while (sk > 0)\n\n   idx = n -1\n\n   do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= n -k)\n\n       ans(idx+1) = ans(idx+1) +1  ! Fortran arrays are 1-based\n\n       sk = sk -1\n\n       idx = idx -1\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So the indices in Java (0-based) need to be adjusted. For example, the first element is 1, last is n.\n\nSo in the first loop, the Java code starts at n-1 (last element) and goes down to n-k (since idx >= n -k). In Fortran, the indices would be from n down to (n -k +1). Because in Java, n-1 is the last index (since 0-based), so in Fortran, the last element is n. So the starting index is n, and the condition is idx >= (n -k +1). Because in Java, the loop runs while idx >= n -k (Java's 0-based), so in Fortran, the equivalent is idx >= (n -k) +1 (since Java's n-k is the starting point for the last k elements). \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nJava's indices for the last k elements are from (n -k) to (n-1). So in Fortran, those would be (n -k +1) to n. So the loop in Fortran would start at idx = n, and decrement until idx >= (n -k +1). \n\nSo the inner loop in Fortran would be:\n\nidx = n\n\ndo while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n   ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n   sk = sk -1\n\n   idx = idx -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the outer loop is a do while (sk >0). So the outer loop runs as long as sk is positive. The inner loop runs until sk is 0 or idx is less than (n -k +1). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\ndo while (sk >0)\n\n   idx = n\n\n   do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n\n       ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n       sk = sk -1\n\n       idx = idx -1\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nBut this may loop unnecessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written with a single loop, but the structure is as per the Java code.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nwhile (sAll >0):\n\n   idx starts at 0 (Java's first element), increments until sAll is 0. \n\nIn Fortran, the first element is 1. So:\n\nidx = 1\n\ndo while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n   ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n   sAll = sAll -1\n\n   idx = idx +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, the condition in Java is while (sAll>0 && idx < n -k). Wait, in Java, the loop runs while sAll>0 and idx < (n -k). Because the first (n -k) elements are indices 0 to (n-k-1). So in Fortran, the indices are 1 to (n -k). So the loop should run while idx <= (n -k). \n\nWait, the Java code's loop is:\n\nint idx =0;\n\nwhile (sAll>0 && idx < n -k) {\n\n   ans[idx++]++;\n\n   sAll--;\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\nidx =1\n\ndo while (sAll >0 .and. idx <= (n -k))\n\n   ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n   sAll = sAll -1\n\n   idx = idx +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the original code increments idx after processing. So in Fortran, starting at 1, and going up to (n-k) (since idx < n-k in Java is equivalent to idx <= (n-k) in Fortran? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's loop runs while idx < (n -k). The initial idx is 0. So the loop runs for idx from 0 to (n-k-1). So in Fortran, the indices are 1 to (n-k). So the condition in Fortran should be idx <= (n -k). \n\nYes, so the loop in Fortran is correct as above.\n\nOnce the array is computed, the next step is to convert it into a space-separated string. \n\nIn Fortran, to create a string from the array, we can use a character array or a string variable. Since Fortran strings have fixed length, perhaps we can compute the required length and then build the string.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the array elements into a string, separated by spaces. \n\nThe first part's output is the array elements separated by spaces. So the string would be like \"ans(1) ans(2) ... ans(n) \" (with a trailing space). But in Fortran, perhaps we can build this string by concatenating each element with a space.\n\nWe can do this by:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nWait, but this might not be the best way. Alternatively, using a write statement into a character variable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a character array of sufficient length. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum possible length would be n*(number of digits per element +1). Assuming each element is up to, say, 10 digits, then 1000 should be enough for n up to 100. But perhaps better to compute dynamically. But for simplicity, let's use a large enough length.\n\nAlternatively, use a temporary character variable and build it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use a write statement to a character variable. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nwrite(str, '(1000i0,1x)') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut this might not work because the format would need to be adjusted. Alternatively, using a format that writes each element followed by a space. \n\nWait, the format '(i0,1x)' would write each number followed by a space. So for all elements, the format would be (n*(i0,1x)), but that's not feasible. Alternatively, using a format like '(1000(i0,1x))' and then trimming the trailing space. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nwrite(str, '( (i0,1x), & )') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: str\ninteger :: i\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length unless using allocatable. So perhaps better to use a character array of sufficient length. Let's assume the maximum needed length is 1000.\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nBut this might not work because each write would overwrite the previous. Alternatively, using a temporary variable and concatenation:\n\nstr = \"\"\ndo i = 1, n\n   write(temp, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't directly concatenate with assignment like that. Alternatively, using a character array and building it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to write the array into a string with spaces, then trim the trailing space. But for the second part's processing, the trailing space might not matter, since the second part is looking for the last non-space and non-? character. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without trimming, as the second part's processing will ignore the trailing space.\n\nSo, after building the string, the next step is to process it as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second Java program reads a string (the entire line), then scans from the end backwards to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (case-insensitive). \n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Take the string generated from the first part's array (the str variable).\n\n- Iterate from the end of the string backward until a character that is not ' ' or '?' is found.\n\n- Convert that character to lowercase.\n\n- Check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\n- Output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so the string may have trailing spaces. So when processing, we need to loop from the end of the string (the length of the string) backward until we find a character that is not ' ' or '?'.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string may have trailing spaces. For example, if the array has elements 5, 3, then the string would be \"5 3 \" (with a trailing space). So when processing, the loop would start at the end of the string (position len_trim(str)), and check each character backward.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the actual length of the string can be found with len_trim(str). So the loop would start at i = len_trim(str) down to 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ninteger :: len_str, i\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\ncharacter :: ch\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\nch = ' '\n\ndo i = len_str, 1, -1\n   if (str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. str(i:i) /= '?') then\n       ch = str(i:i)\n       exit\n   end if\nend do\n\nThen, convert ch to lowercase. In Fortran, we can use the ichar and achar functions. \n\ninteger :: ich\nich = ichar(ch)\nif (ich >= ichar('A') .and. ich <= ichar('Z')) then\n   ch = achar(ich + 32)\nend if\n\nThen check if ch is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nif (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n   print *, \"YES\"\nelse\n   print *, \"NO\"\nend if\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input variables (n, k, l, r, sAll, sk).\n\n2. Compute the array ans as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert ans into a space-separated string.\n\n4. Process that string to find the last non-space and non-? character.\n\n5. Output YES or NO based on whether that character is a vowel.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read n, k, l, r, sAll, sk from input. Since the second part doesn't use r, but the first part's code doesn't use it either, we can just read it and ignore.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\nread*, n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\nThen, allocate the array ans. Since Fortran arrays are static, we can declare it as dimension(n). But since n is read from input, we need to use an allocatable array.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: ans(:)\nallocate(ans(n))\n\nInitialize all elements to l:\n\nans = l\n\nThen compute sAll and sk as per the code:\n\nsAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\nsk = sk - k*l\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables are case-insensitive, so need to make sure variable names are unique. The variables are n, k, l, r, sAll, sk. So sAll is okay as a variable name.\n\nThen the first loop:\n\ndo while (sk >0)\n   integer :: idx\n   idx = n\n   do while (sk >0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n       ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n       sk = sk -1\n       idx = idx -1\n   end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in the outer loop, after the inner loop runs, sk may still be positive, so the outer loop continues. The inner loop runs until sk is 0 or idx is less than (n -k +1). \n\nThen the second loop:\n\ninteger :: idx2\nidx2 =1\ndo while (sAll >0 .and. idx2 <= (n -k))\n   ans(idx2) = ans(idx2) +1\n   sAll = sAll -1\n   idx2 = idx2 +1\nend do\n\nWait, the second loop's condition is sAll>0 and idx2 <= (n -k). \n\nNow, building the string:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nstr = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nWait, but this might not work because each write would overwrite the previous. Alternatively, using a temporary variable:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: temp_str\ntemp_str = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp_str\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation can be done with //, but the initial str is empty. So:\n\nstr = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp_str\nend do\n\nBut temp_str needs to be a character variable. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nstr = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(str, '(a,i0,a)') trim(str), ans(i), \" \"\nend do\n\nBut this may not work because each write would start at the beginning. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to use a write statement into a character variable with a format that appends each element followed by a space.\n\nAlternatively, using a format like:\n\nwrite(str, '( (i0,1x), & )') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\nwrite(str, '(1000i0,1x)') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut this would write all numbers with default formatting, followed by a space. However, the total length may exceed 1000, but assuming the input is within reasonable limits, this might work. The trailing space is okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nwrite(str, '( (i0,1x) )') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut the format may need to be adjusted. Alternatively, using a format that can handle variable numbers of elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach with a loop is better.\n\nLet me try the loop approach:\n\nstr = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(temp, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared. So:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp\nstr = \"\"\ndo i =1, n\n   write(temp, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n   str = trim(str) // temp\nend do\n\nThis way, each element is converted to a string with a trailing space, and concatenated to str. The temp variable holds each element's string. The total length must be sufficient. Assuming each element is up to 10 digits, plus a space, for n elements, 1000 should be enough for n up to 100.\n\nOnce the string is built, process it as per the second part.\n\nNow, processing the string:\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\nch = ' '\n\ndo i = len_str, 1, -1\n   if (str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. str(i:i) /= '?') then\n       ch = str(i:i)\n       exit\n   end if\nend do\n\nThen convert to lowercase:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n   ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\nend if\n\nCheck vowels:\n\nif (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n   print *, 'YES'\nelse\n   print *, 'NO'\nend if\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n    integer, allocatable :: ans(:)\n    character(len=1000) :: str\n    character(len=20) :: temp\n    character :: ch\n    integer :: i, len_str, idx, idx2\n\n    !

Compute sAll and sk adjustments\n    sAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l)\n    sk = sk - k*l\n\n    ! First loop to adjust sk\n    do while (sk > 0)\n        idx = n\n        do while (sk > 0 .and. idx >= (n -k +1))\n            ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n            sk = sk -1\n            idx = idx -1\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    !

Build the string from the array\n    str = \"\"\n    do i =1, n\n        write(temp, '(i0,a)') ans(i), \" \"\n        str = trim(str) // temp\n    end do\n\n    ! Process the string to find last non-space and non-? character\n    len_str = len_trim(str)\n    ch = ' '\n    do i = len_str, 1, -1\n        if (str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. str(i:i) /= '?') then\n            ch = str(i:i)\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert to lowercase\n    if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n        ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n    end if\n\n    !

The inner loop may reduce sk to 0, so the outer loop may exit. But if the inner loop can't reduce sk to 0 (e.g., if there are not enough elements to distribute), but according to the problem's constraints, perhaps the code is designed so that sk is non-negative and can be handled. \n\nTesting edge cases might be needed, but the code should follow the original Java's logic.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the first loop, the condition for the inner loop is sk>0 and idx >= (n-k+1). For example, if n=5 and k=2, then n-k+1 =4. So indices 4 and 5 (Fortran's 4 and 5) are the last 2 elements. \n\nAnother possible issue is the string building. The loop appends each element followed by a space. So the final string will have a trailing space. But when processing, the loop starts from the end (len_trim(str)), which includes the trailing space. So the first character checked would be the last character (the space), then the previous character (the last element's last digit?), but the loop skips spaces and '?'. So the trailing space is skipped, and the last non-space character is the last element's last digit. \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the code should work as intended."
