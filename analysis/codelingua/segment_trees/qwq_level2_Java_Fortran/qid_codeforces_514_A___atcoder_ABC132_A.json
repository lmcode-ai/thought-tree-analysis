    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_514_A) takes a long integer as input. It processes each digit of the number. For each digit, if 9 minus the digit is less than the digit itself, it uses 9 - digit instead. Otherwise, it keeps the original digit. Then, it constructs a new number from these processed digits and outputs it. \n\nWait, let me think again. The condition is if (9 - r < r), then replace with 9 - r. So for each digit r, we choose the smaller between r and 9 - r. Because if 9 - r is smaller than r, then we take that. Otherwise, we take r. So the digit is replaced by whichever is closer to 4.5, but since they are integers, it's the minimal sum. For example, if the digit is 5, 9-5 is 4, which is smaller, so we take 4. Wait, but 5 and 4 are equally distant from 4.5? Hmm, but the condition is 9 - r < r. So for r=5, 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 yes, so we take 4. So the digit is replaced by the smaller of the two. \n\nSo the first program processes each digit of the input number, replacing each digit with the smaller between itself and 9 - itself, then constructs the new number from those digits in reverse order (since we process from the least significant digit first, but when building the new number, we start adding from the first digit (the least significant) and multiply by 10 each time, so the digits are reversed. Wait, let me see the code again. \n\nThe first program reads x, then in a loop, takes x mod 10 (the last digit), processes it, adds to the list. Then x is divided by 10. So the digits are added to the list in reverse order (from least to most significant). Then when building newNumber, it starts with the first element (the original last digit) as the least significant digit. So the list is stored in reverse order of the original number's digits, but when building newNumber, the first element is the first digit (units place), then next is tens, etc. So the new number is the same as the original digits processed, but in the same order as the original number. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the input is 123. The first step: x=123, r=3. Then x becomes 12. Next iteration, r=2, x becomes 1. Then r=1, x becomes 0. The list is [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (3) is added as 3*10^0, then 2*10^1, then 1*10^2 \u2192 321. Wait, that's the reverse of the original number. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the original number is 123, but the new number would be 321? That's because the digits are processed in reverse order. Wait, the original number's digits are 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 3 (units). The code processes the digits starting from the units digit (3), then 2, then 1. The list is [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (3) is the units digit, then 2 is tens, then 1 is hundreds. So the new number is 321. So the first program reverses the digits? Or is that part of the processing?\n\nWait, no. The processing is per digit, but the order of the digits in the new number is the same as the order in which they were processed. Since the digits are taken from the end of the original number, the new number is the reverse of the original digits, but each digit is replaced by the minimal between itself and 9 - itself. Wait, but the problem says that the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. \n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So for example, \"aabb\" would be yes, but \"abba\" is also yes. \"aabc\" would be no because 'c' appears once. \n\nSo the sequence is: input a number \u2192 first program processes it to get a new number \u2192 that number is converted to a string (since the second program reads a string) \u2192 then the second program checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. \n\nWait, but the first program outputs a number, which when printed is a string. So the second program reads that as a string. So the output of the first program is a number, which when printed, is a string of digits. So the second program's input is that string. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input number, process it as per the first Java program, then process the resulting number as a string in the second program's logic, and output the final result. \n\nNow, translating this into a single Fortran program. \n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input number (from stdin). \n\n2. Process it as per the first Java program to get the new number. \n\n3. Convert that new number to a string (since the second program's input is a string). \n\n4. Process the string as per the second Java program to check the conditions. \n\n5. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly. \n\nBut in Fortran, how to do this without I/O in between. \n\nFirst, let's handle the first part. \n\nFirst program's processing:\n\nThe first program takes a number, breaks it into digits, processes each digit, then constructs the new number. \n\nIn Fortran, to process the digits, we can read the input as an integer (or a string, but perhaps as an integer). Let's see. \n\nWait, the input is a long in Java, but in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes (if using integer*8 or selected_int_kind). Let's assume the input is a non-negative integer (since in the first Java code, the loop runs while x>0, so leading zeros are not part of the input). \n\nProcessing steps for first part:\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold the processed digits. \n\nLoop while the number is greater than 0:\n\n- get the last digit (mod 10)\n\n- process it (if 9 - digit < digit \u2192 use 9 - digit else digit)\n\n- add to the list (but in reverse order, since we process from the end)\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the digits are added to the list in the order of least significant to most. Then when building the new number, they are added in that order, so the new number is the digits in the same order as they were processed, which is the reverse of the original number's digit order. Wait, but the first program's output is the new number. Let me see with an example. \n\nSuppose input is 123. \n\nProcessing:\n\nx = 123 \u2192 r = 3 \u2192 since 9-3=6 which is not less than 3? Wait, 9-3 is 6, which is greater than 3. So the condition (9 - r < r) \u2192 6 <3 \u2192 false. So we add r (3). \n\nThen x becomes 12. \n\nNext iteration: r = 2 \u2192 9-2=7 >2 \u2192 add 2. \n\nx becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration: r=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 add 1. \n\nSo the list is [3,2,1]. \n\nThen newNumber is 3*10^0 + 2*10^1 +1*10^2 \u2192 3 +20 +100 \u2192 123. Wait, so the new number is the same as the input? That can't be right. Wait, but in this case, all digits were less than or equal to 9 - digit? Wait, for digit 1, 9-1=8, which is larger than 1. So the condition is false, so we take the digit. \n\nWait, but in the first example, if the input is 123, the output is 123. \n\nAnother example: input 5. \n\nr =5 \u2192 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 yes. So add 4. \n\nThen x becomes 0. \n\nnewNumber is 4 \u2192 so output is 4. \n\nAnother example: input 9. \n\nr=9 \u2192 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. So add 0. \n\nnewNumber is 0. \n\nWait, but the first Java code has a condition: if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r); else list.add(9 - r). \n\nWait, looking back at the first Java code's code:\n\nThe code for adding to the list is:\n\nif (x / 10 == 0 && 9 - r == 0) list.add(r);\n\nelse list.add(9 - r);\n\nWait, that's only when the condition (9 - r < r) is true. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n   if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n   else list.add(9 - r);\n\n} else list.add(r);\n\nAh, right. So when 9 - r is less than r, then we check if it's the last digit (x/10 ==0) and if 9 - r is zero. \n\nWait, the condition is: \n\nif (x /10 ==0 (i.e., it's the last digit) and 9 - r ==0 (so the replacement would be zero, but adding that would lead to leading zero?), then we add r instead of 9 - r. \n\nWait, the code is trying to avoid leading zeros? \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the input is 10. \n\nProcessing:\n\nx=10 \u2192 r=0. \n\n9-0=9 which is greater than 0 \u2192 so the first condition (9 - r < r) is 9 <0 \u2192 no. So we add r (0). \n\nWait, but then x becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration: r=1. \n\n9-1=8 <1? 8 <1 \u2192 no. So add 1. \n\nx becomes 0. \n\nThe list is [0,1]. \n\nThen newNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 10. \n\nWait, but the original number was 10, so the output is same. \n\nAnother example: input 19. \n\nOriginal digits: 1 and 9. \n\nProcessing first digit (9):\n\nx=19 \u2192 r=9. \n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck if x/10 (19/10 is 1, not zero \u2192 so not the last digit. So add 0. \n\nThen x becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration: r=1. \n\n9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So add 1. \n\nList is [9,1]? Wait, no. Wait, first iteration: r=9 (the last digit of 19 is 9). \n\nWait, the first step: x=19 \u2192 r=9 mod10 \u2192 yes. \n\nThen x becomes 19/10 \u2192 1. \n\nSecond iteration: x=1 \u2192 r=1 mod10 \u21921. \n\nx becomes 0. \n\nSo the list is [9,1]. \n\nWait, but when building newNumber, the first element is 9 (the first digit added, which was the original last digit). \n\nSo newNumber is 9*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 9 +10 \u219219. \n\nWait, but the first digit (9) was replaced by 0? Wait, no. Wait in the first step, when processing r=9 (the last digit of 19):\n\nThe condition (9 - r < r) \u2192 0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nThen check if x/10 (19/10 is 1, which is not zero \u2192 so the first part of the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. So we add 9 - r \u2192 0. \n\nWait, so the list would be [0,1]. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the code's logic for the first program:\n\nWhen processing a digit r (from the current x mod10):\n\nif (9 - r < r) \u2192 then:\n\n   if (x divided by 10 is zero (i.e., this is the last digit) AND (9 - r ==0)), then add r to the list. \n\n   else \u2192 add (9 - r) to the list. \n\nelse \u2192 add r to the list. \n\nSo in the case of the digit 9 in the number 19 (the first step):\n\nr=9. \n\n9 - r is 0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck if x/10 (19/10 is 1, which is not zero \u2192 so the first part of the condition (x/10 ==0) is false. So the else clause is taken \u2192 add 0. \n\nSo the list after first step is [0]. \n\nThen x becomes 1. \n\nSecond iteration: r=1. \n\n9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So add 1. \n\nList becomes [0,1]. \n\nThen newNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 10. \n\nWait, so the output would be 10. \n\nWait, but the original number was 19. \n\nHmm, so the first program's output for 19 is 10. \n\nSo the code is replacing each digit with the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero, then it keeps the digit. \n\nWait, the condition for the last digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r ==0 \u2192 then add r instead of 9 - r. \n\nSo in the case where the last digit is 9, then 9 - r is 0, but since it's the last digit, we add r (9) instead of 0. \n\nSo for example, input 9 \u2192 \n\nr=9. \n\nx/10 is 0 \u2192 yes. \n\n9 - r is 0 \u2192 so the condition is met. \n\nSo add r (9). \n\nThus the new number is 9. \n\nAnother example: input 10 \u2192 \n\nProcessing the last digit (0):\n\nr=0. \n\n9-0=9 which is not less than 0 \u2192 so add 0. \n\nThen x becomes 1. \n\nNext iteration: r=1. \n\n9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So add 1. \n\nList is [0,1]. \n\nnewNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 10. \n\nSo the output is 10. \n\nOkay, so the first program's logic is to replace each digit with the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and the replacement would be zero (i.e., 9 - digit is zero \u2192 digit is 9), then we keep the original digit. \n\nSo the first program's processing is to minimize each digit's contribution to the sum, but avoiding leading zeros. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nFirst, read the input number. Let's assume it's a non-negative integer. \n\nWe can read it as an integer. Let's say using read(*,*) x. \n\nBut in Fortran, integers can be of different kinds. Since Java uses long (64 bits), but for the problem's input, perhaps the input is within 32 bits. But to be safe, maybe use integer(8). \n\nThen, process each digit. \n\nWe need to collect the processed digits in a list. Since Fortran arrays are static, perhaps we can use an array of sufficient size. Let's assume the input number has up to, say, 20 digits. \n\nInitialize an array of integers (digits) with size 20, and a counter for the number of digits. \n\nLoop while x >0:\n\n   r = mod(x,10)\n\n   process r as per the condition. \n\n   add to the digits array. \n\n   x = x /10 \n\n   increment the counter. \n\nWait, but the digits are collected in reverse order (from least to most significant). \n\nOnce all digits are processed, we need to build the new number. \n\nThe new number is constructed by taking each digit in the order they were stored (since the first digit stored is the least significant digit of the original number, which becomes the least significant digit of the new number). \n\nWait, the digits array is filled in the order of processing (from the end of the original number). So the first element is the least significant digit of the original, which becomes the first digit of the new number. \n\nSo the new number is the sum over i from 0 to n-1 of digits(i+1)*10^i. \n\nWait, in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. \n\nWait, let's think in code. \n\nSuppose we have an array digits(20), and count is the number of digits. \n\ndigits(1) is the first digit (original least significant), digits(2) next, etc. \n\nThen newNumber = 0 \n\ndo i =1, count \n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*10**(i-1) \n\nend do \n\nWait, no. Because the first digit (digits(1)) is the units place (10^0), the second is tens (10^1), etc. \n\nSo the exponent is (i-1). \n\nWait, for i=1: 10^0 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the new number is the sum of digits(i)*10^(i-1) for i from 1 to count. \n\nNow, processing each digit r: \n\nFor each r, compute the replacement. \n\nFirst, check if (9 - r) < r \u2192 if yes, then check if it's the last digit (i.e., whether after this step, x becomes 0). \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the check is whether x/10 ==0 (before dividing by 10). \n\nWait, in the Java code, the condition is: \n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) \u2192 then add r. \n\nElse add 9 - r. \n\nWait, but in the code, the x is divided by 10 after processing the digit. \n\nSo when processing the current digit r, the current x is the original x before division. \n\nSo in the code, the check is whether (x /10) is zero (i.e., the current digit is the last one). \n\nSo in Fortran, during the loop, before dividing x by 10, we can check if (x /10) ==0. \n\nWait, but in the loop, the steps are: \n\nr = mod(x,10)\n\nthen check if (9 - r < r). \n\nIf yes: \n\n   if (x /10 ==0 and (9 - r ==0)) \u2192 then add r \n\n   else \u2192 add (9 - r) \n\nElse \u2192 add r \n\nThen x = x /10 \n\nSo in Fortran, during the loop, before dividing x by 10, we can check (x /10) ==0. \n\nSo in code: \n\ndo while (x >0) \n\n   r = mod(x,10) \n\n   temp_r = r \n\n   if ( (9 - r) < r ) then \n\n      if ( (x /10) ==0 .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then \n\n         temp_r = r \n\n      else \n\n         temp_r = 9 - r \n\n      end if \n\n   end if \n\n   digits(count) = temp_r \n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   x = x /10 \n\nend do \n\nWait, but the count starts at 1? Or 0? \n\nWait, let's initialize count=0. \n\nInitially, count is 0. \n\nInside the loop: \n\ndigits(count+1) = temp_r \n\ncount = count +1 \n\nWait, perhaps better to have count start at 0, and increment after storing. \n\nWait, let me structure it properly. \n\nInitialize count =0 \n\ndigits array is of size, say, 20. \n\nloop: \n\n   r = mod(x,10) \n\n   compute temp_r as per conditions \n\n   digits(count+1) = temp_r \n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   x = x /10 \n\nend loop \n\nWait, but the loop is while x>0. \n\nWait, but in the first iteration, x is the original number. \n\nWait, perhaps the code would be: \n\ninteger :: x, r, temp_r, count=0 \n\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits \n\nread(*,*) x \n\ndo while (x >0) \n\n   r = mod(x,10) \n\n   if ( (9 - r) < r ) then \n\n      if ( (x /10) ==0 .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then \n\n         temp_r = r \n\n      else \n\n         temp_r = 9 - r \n\n      end if \n\n   else \n\n      temp_r = r \n\n   end if \n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   digits(count) = temp_r \n\n   x = x /10 \n\nend do \n\nThen, after the loop, the digits array has count elements, stored in the order of processing (from least to most significant digit of the original number). \n\nThen, compute newNumber: \n\nnewNumber = 0 \n\ndo i=1, count \n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*10**(i-1) \n\nend do \n\nWait, but 10^(i-1) can be computed as 10^(i-1). However, in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. \n\nBut for large exponents, this might be an issue. Alternatively, we can compute it step by step. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum count is 20, 10^19 is manageable as an integer*8. \n\nAssuming newNumber is an integer(8). \n\nSo after this, the newNumber is the output of the first program. \n\nNow, the second program takes this newNumber as input, converts it to a string, and checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. \n\nSo in Fortran, we need to convert newNumber to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. \n\nFor example: \n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s \n\nwrite(s, '(i20)') newNumber \n\ns = adjustl(s) \n\nThis will write the number into the string, left-adjusted, trimming leading spaces. \n\nThen, process the string s. \n\nNow, the second program's logic: \n\nCheck if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. \n\nSo steps: \n\n1. Count the frequency of each character in the string. \n\n2. Check if there are exactly two distinct characters. \n\n3. Each of those has a count of 2. \n\nIn Fortran, we can do this with an array to count frequencies. \n\nFirst, get the length of the string. \n\nn = len_trim(s) \n\nIf the length is not 4, then it can't be two characters each twice (since 2*2=4). Wait, but the first program's output could be a number with any number of digits. Wait, the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is a number. So the string length must be even? Not necessarily. For example, if the first program's output is 12, then the string is \"12\" \u2192 two characters, each appearing once \u2192 so the second program would output \"No\". \n\nWait, the second program checks if exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the total length must be 4. \n\nWait, the second Java program's code: \n\nIt reads a string s, then checks if the map has exactly two entries, and each entry's count is 2. \n\nSo the length of s must be 4. \n\nWait, in the second Java code, the input is a string s, which is read via in.next(). So it's a single token, which is the output of the first program. \n\nThe first program outputs a number, which when printed, is a string of digits. So the second program's input is that string. \n\nTherefore, the length of the string must be exactly 4? No, not necessarily. For example, if the first program's output is 1234, then the string is \"1234\" (4 characters). \n\nBut if the first program's output is 12, then the string is \"12\" (2 characters). Then the second program would check if the counts are two characters each appearing twice \u2192 but 2 characters with counts 1 and 1 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the second program's logic is: \n\n- count the frequency of each character in the string. \n\n- check if there are exactly two distinct characters. \n\n- each of those has a count of exactly 2. \n\nSo the total length must be 2*2=4. \n\nTherefore, if the string length is not 4, then the answer is \"No\". \n\nSo in Fortran, first check the length of the string. \n\nIf the length is not 4 \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nElse proceed. \n\nSo steps in Fortran: \n\nAfter converting newNumber to string s: \n\nn = len_trim(s) \n\nif (n /=4) then \n\n   print *, \"No\" \n\n   stop \n\nend if \n\nThen, count the frequency of each character. \n\nWe can use an array of size 128 (for ASCII) or just track the counts for the characters present. \n\nAlternatively, since the characters are digits (since the first program outputs a number), the characters are '0' to '9'. \n\nSo we can have an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9). \n\nInitialize an array count(0:9) =0 \n\ndo i=1,4 \n\n   c = s(i:i) \n\n   digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0') \n\n   count(digit) = count(digit) +1 \n\nend do \n\nThen, check how many digits have count 2. \n\nnum_two =0 \n\ndo i=0,9 \n\n   if (count(i) ==2) then \n\n      num_two = num_two +1 \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nif (num_two ==2) then \n\n   print *, \"Yes\" \n\nelse \n\n   print *, \"No\" \n\nend if \n\nWait, but also need to ensure that all other counts are zero. Because if there's a digit with count 0, that's okay, but any digit with count not 2 or 0 would invalidate. \n\nWait, the condition is that exactly two distinct digits, each appearing exactly twice. So the counts for those two are 2, and the rest are 0. \n\nSo the num_two must be exactly 2, and all other counts must be zero. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of counts is 4, and exactly two of them are 2. \n\nWait, the code above counts how many digits have exactly 2. \n\nIf that is exactly 2, then yes. \n\nBecause if two digits have 2 each, that's 4 total. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code would work. \n\nPutting it all together. \n\nNow, putting all steps into a single Fortran program. \n\nFirst, read the input number. \n\nProcess it as per first program to get newNumber. \n\nConvert newNumber to a string. \n\nProcess the string as per second program. \n\nNow, code steps: \n\nprogram main \n\n  implicit none \n\n  integer(8) :: x, newNumber \n\n  integer :: r, temp_r, count=0, i, pow \n\n  integer, dimension(20) :: digits \n\n  character(len=20) :: s \n\n  integer :: n \n\n  integer :: count_digits(0:9) \n\n  !

(9 - r ==0) ) then \n\n           temp_r = r \n\n        else \n\n           temp_r = 9 - r \n\n        end if \n\n     else \n\n        temp_r = r \n\n     end if \n\n     count = count +1 \n\n     digits(count) = temp_r \n\n     x = x /10 \n\n  end do \n\n  ! Compute newNumber \n\n  newNumber =0 \n\n  do i=1, count \n\n     newNumber = newNumber + digits(i)*10**(i-1) \n\n  end do \n\n  ! Convert newNumber to string \n\n  write(s, '(i20)') newNumber \n\n  s = adjustl(s) \n\n  n = len_trim(s) \n\n  ! Check length \n\n  if (n /=4) then \n\n     print *, \"No\" \n\n     stop \n\n  end if \n\n  ! Initialize counts \n\n  count_digits =0 \n\n  do i=1,4 \n\n     integer :: c_ascii \n\n     c_ascii = ichar(s(i:i)) \n\n     integer :: digit \n\n     digit = c_ascii - ichar('0') \n\n     count_digits(digit) = count_digits(digit) +1 \n\n  end do \n\n  ! Check counts \n\n  integer :: num_two =0 \n\n  do i=0,9 \n\n     if (count_digits(i) ==2) then \n\n        num_two = num_two +1 \n\n     end if \n\n  end do \n\n  if (num_two ==2) then \n\n     print *, \"Yes\" \n\n  else \n\n     print *, \"No\" \n\n  end if \n\nend program main \n\nWait, but in the code above, when converting newNumber to a string, the write statement may have leading spaces. Using adjustl(s) removes leading spaces. \n\nBut the length_trim(s) will give the actual length. \n\nWait, but in the code, after writing to s, we do s=adjustl(s). \n\nThen, the length_trim(s) is the correct length. \n\nTesting with example inputs. \n\nTest case 1: input 1234 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nWait let's see. \n\nFirst program processing 1234: \n\nProcessing each digit: \n\nOriginal number is 1234. \n\nLoop steps: \n\nx=1234 \u2192 r=4 \n\nCheck 9-4=5 <4 \u2192 5 <4 \u2192 no. So temp_r=4. \n\ncount becomes 1, digits(1)=4. \n\nx becomes 123. \n\nNext iteration: x=123 \u2192 r=3 \n\n9-3=6 <3 \u2192 no. \u2192 temp_r=3. \n\ndigits(2)=3. \n\nx=12. \n\nNext: r=2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 temp_r=2. \n\ndigits(3)=2. \n\nx=1. \n\nNext: r=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 temp_r=1. \n\ndigits(4)=1. \n\nx becomes 0. \n\nSo digits array has [4,3,2,1]. \n\nnewNumber is 4*10^0 +3*10^1 +2*10^2 +1*10^3 \u2192 4 +30 +200 +1000 \u2192 1234. \n\nSo the output of first program is 1234 \u2192 string is \"1234\". \n\nSecond program checks: \n\ndigits are '1','2','3','4' \u2192 four distinct characters, each count 1 \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nSo the final output is \"No\". \n\nAnother test case: input 1122 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nOriginal number 1122 \u2192 digits are 1,1,2,2. \n\nProcessing each digit: \n\nWait let's process step by step. \n\nx=1122 \u2192 r=2. \n\n9-2=7 <2 \u2192 no. So temp_r=2. \n\ndigits(1)=2. \n\nx=112. \n\nr=2 \u2192 same \u2192 temp_r=2. \n\ndigits(2)=2. \n\nx=11. \n\nr=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 temp_r=1. \n\ndigits(3)=1. \n\nx=1. \n\nr=1 \u2192 9-1=8>1 \u2192 temp_r=1. \n\ndigits(4)=1. \n\nx becomes 0. \n\nnewNumber is 2*1 +2*10 +1*100 +1*1000 \u2192 2 +20 +100 +1000 \u2192 1122. \n\nSo the string is \"1122\". \n\nSecond program: counts for '1' \u2192 2, '2' \u21922 \u2192 output \"Yes\". \n\nAnother test case: input 99 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nx=99 \u2192 first iteration: r=9. \n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck if x/10 (99/10=9) \u2192 not zero \u2192 so temp_r=0. \n\ndigits(1)=0. \n\nx becomes 9. \n\nNext iteration: r=9. \n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck x/10 (9/10=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nAlso 9 -r =0 \u2192 so condition met. \n\nSo temp_r =9. \n\ndigits(2)=9. \n\nx becomes 0. \n\nnewNumber is 0*10^0 +9*10^1 \u2192 90. \n\nString is \"90\". \n\nLength is 2 \u2192 so output \"No\". \n\nAnother test case: input 9 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nx=9 \u2192 r=9. \n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck x/10 is 0 \u2192 yes. \n\n9 -r is 0 \u2192 so add r (9). \n\ndigits(1)=9. \n\nnewNumber is 9 \u2192 string \"9\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nAnother test case: input 19 \u2192 first program's output is 10 (as earlier example). \n\nString is \"10\" \u2192 length 2 \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nAnother test case: input 1122 \u2192 works. \n\nAnother test case: input 2233 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nOriginal number 2233 \u2192 digits 2,2,3,3. \n\nProcessing each digit: \n\nFirst digit (3): \n\nr=3 \u2192 9-3=6>3 \u2192 temp_r=3. \n\nWait, let's process step by step. \n\nWait, the first digit (from the end) is 3 (the last digit of 2233 is 3). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nx=2233 \u2192 first iteration: r=3. \n\n9-3=6 <3 \u2192 no (6 is not less than 3). So temp_r=3. \n\ndigits(1)=3. \n\nx=223. \n\nNext r=3 \u2192 same \u2192 temp_r=3. \n\ndigits(2)=3. \n\nx=22. \n\nr=2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 temp_r=2. \n\ndigits(3)=2. \n\nx=2. \n\nr=2 \u2192 9-2=7>2 \u2192 temp_r=2. \n\ndigits(4)=2. \n\nnewNumber is 3*1 +3*10 +2*100 +2*1000 \u2192 3+30+200+2000=2233. \n\nSo the string is \"2233\". \n\nSecond program counts: '2' \u21922, '3' \u21922 \u2192 output \"Yes\". \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, checking the Fortran code for possible issues. \n\nIn the first part, when building newNumber, the exponent is (i-1). \n\nYes, because digits(1) is the first digit (units place). \n\nAnother possible issue: when converting newNumber to a string, if newNumber is zero, but that can only happen if the input was zero? \n\nWait, the first program's loop runs while x>0. So if the input is zero, the loop doesn't run. \n\nWait, the first program's code in Java starts with x = sc.nextLong(); then while (x>0). \n\nSo if the input is zero, the loop doesn't execute. \n\nThen, the list is empty. \n\nThen, newNumber is 0. \n\nSo in Fortran, if the input is zero, then the loop doesn't run. \n\ncount remains 0. \n\nThen, newNumber is 0. \n\nThe string becomes \"0\", length 1 \u2192 output \"No\". \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother edge case: input 1001 \u2192 first program's processing. \n\nOriginal number 1001 \u2192 digits are 1,0,0,1. \n\nProcessing each digit: \n\nFirst iteration (r=1): \n\n9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So temp_r=1. \n\ndigits(1)=1. \n\nx=100. \n\nNext r=0 \u2192 9-0=9>0 \u2192 temp_r=0. \n\ndigits(2)=0. \n\nx=10. \n\nr=0 \u2192 same \u2192 temp_r=0. \n\ndigits(3)=0. \n\nx=1. \n\nr=1 \u2192 same \u2192 temp_r=1. \n\ndigits(4)=1. \n\nnewNumber is 1*1 +0*10 +0*100 +1*1000 \u2192 1 +0 +0 +1000 \u2192 1001. \n\nString is \"1001\". \n\nSecond program: counts '1' \u21922, '0' \u21922 \u2192 output \"Yes\". \n\nSo the code would output \"Yes\". \n\nThus, the code should handle this correctly. \n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the digits array is dimensioned as 20, which should be sufficient for numbers up to 1e20. \n\nThe count starts at 0 and increments each time. \n\nThe code should be correct. \n\nNow, writing the final Fortran code."
