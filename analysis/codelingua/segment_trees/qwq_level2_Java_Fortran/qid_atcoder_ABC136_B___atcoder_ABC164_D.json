    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a number. The second takes that number as input, processes it, and outputs the final result. But in Fortran, I have to combine them so that the first part's output is the input for the second part, but without any I/O in between. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (atcoder_ABC136_B):\n\nIt reads an integer N from input. Then it counts the number of digits in N (count). Then it loops over each digit position from 1 to count. For each i (the digit position), it adds certain values to ans. The logic here is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe loop for i from 1 to count:\n\n- If i is the last digit (i == count), then if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1) to ans. Wait, because 10^(i-1) is the first number with i digits. So for example, if N is 345 (3 digits), when i=3, it's adding 345 - 100 +1 = 246. But why?\n\nThe other cases: for i not the last, if i is 1, add 9. For other even i? Wait, the condition is if i%2 ==1. Wait, the code says:\n\nElse (i is not the last), then if i is 1, add 9. Else if i is odd, add (10^i - 10^(i-1)). \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i from 1 to count:\n\n   if i == count:\n\n      if i is odd, add (N - 10^{i-1} +1)\n\n   else:\n\n      if i ==1: add 9\n\n      else if i%2 ==1: add (10^i - 10^{i-1})\n\nSo the idea is to count numbers with an odd number of digits. Because for each digit count, if the count is odd, then all numbers with that digit count contribute. Wait, maybe the problem is to count how many numbers up to N have an odd number of digits. Let me think.\n\nWait the problem might be from AtCoder, so perhaps the first program is solving a problem where you have to count the numbers from 1 to N that have an odd number of digits. Let me see:\n\nFor example, if N is 123:\n\nDigits count is 3 (odd). So for i=3 (the count), the contribution is (123 - 100 +1) =24 numbers (100-123, which is 24 numbers, each with 3 digits). \n\nFor i=1 (digits 1), since it's not the last, add 9 (numbers 1-9). \n\nFor i=2 (digits 2, which is even, so not added). \n\nSo total ans would be 9 (for 1-digit) + 24 (for 3-digit) = 33. \n\nSo the first program is counting the numbers up to N with an odd number of digits. \n\nNow the second Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D):\n\nIt takes a string S, which is a number (as a string), and computes the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that the substring from i to j (as a number) is divisible by 2019. The approach uses modular arithmetic and some precomputing. \n\nThe algorithm here is a bit more complex. Let me see:\n\nThe code first initializes mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays. It processes the string from the end, calculating the mod 2019 of the numbers formed by the suffixes. The key idea is that for a substring S[i..j], its value mod 2019 can be computed using the precomputed mod values. Since 2019 divides the substring's value if the mod is 0. \n\nThe code loops over each character (from the end), calculates the current digit's contribution, updates mod_arr and mod_cnt. Then, the answer is the number of pairs with the same mod value, which is counted by mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 summed over all mod values. \n\nBut in the second program, the input is a string S. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string S. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string S. That suggests that the first program's output is a number, which is then converted into a string for the second program. \n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program outputs an integer, which is then read as the input string S for the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first program's output. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the integer ans, then pass it as a string to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program). \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after computing the first part's ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string as the input for the second part. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N from input (first program's input).\n\n2. Compute the first program's ans (count of numbers with odd digits up to N).\n\n3. Convert that ans to a string S.\n\n4. Process S through the second program's algorithm to compute the final answer.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first program):\n\nWe need to read an integer N. Then compute the number of digits (count). Then loop over each i from 1 to count, adding to ans as per the conditions.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nVariables needed for first part:\n\n- N: integer input.\n\n- count: integer (number of digits).\n\n- temp: integer (to compute count).\n\n- ans: integer (the result of first part).\n\nThen, the steps:\n\nInitialize count to 0, temp = N.\n\nLoop while temp >0: divide by 10, increment count each time.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to count:\n\n   if i == count:\n\n      if mod(i,2) ==1 then:\n\n          ans = ans + (N - 10^(i-1) +1)\n\n   else:\n\n      if i ==1 then:\n\n          ans = ans +9\n\n      else if mod(i,2) ==1 then:\n\n          ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is **. So 10^(i-1) is 10**(i-1).\n\nWait, but in Java, Math.pow(10, i-1) is used, but since i can be up to the number of digits of N (which could be up to, say, 18 digits?), but in Fortran, 10**i is okay as integer if i is not too big. Wait, but for large exponents, like 10^18, that's a big number. But in the first problem, N is up to whatever the input is, but in the problem's context, perhaps it's manageable. \n\nWait, but in the first Java program, when N is, say, 1000 (4 digits), then for i=4 (count=4, even?), so the code would not add anything for i=4? Wait, let me check the code again.\n\nWait in the first program's code:\n\nif (i == count) {\n\n    if (i % 2 ==1) {\n\n        ans += (N - Math.pow(10, i-1)+1);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo for i equal to count, which is the number of digits, if that count is odd, then add the numbers from 10^{i-1} to N. \n\nSo for example, if N is 1000 (4 digits, even), then when i=4, since 4 is even, the condition is not met, so nothing is added. \n\nSo the first program's code is correct for counting numbers with odd digit counts. \n\nNow, in Fortran, the first part's code would be:\n\nRead N.\n\ncount = 0\n\ntemp = N\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\n   count = count +1\n\nend do\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, count\n\n   if (i == count) then\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n          ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i ==1) then\n\n          ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n          ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the first part. \n\nNow, the second part (Java's second program):\n\nThe input is a string S. The code processes it to compute the number of pairs of indices with substring divisible by 2019. \n\nIn Fortran, the input for the second part is the string representation of the first part's ans. So after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string S. \n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger :: ans\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\nBut we have to make sure that the string is properly null-terminated or handled. Alternatively, use a character array. \n\nOnce S is the string, then process it as per the second program's logic. \n\nThe second program's steps:\n\nInitialize N as the length of S.\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N (since the loop runs from 0 to N-1 in Java, but in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default, but maybe better to use 0-based or adjust accordingly). \n\nWait, in Java, the code uses mod_arr of size N (for i from 0 to N-1). So in Fortran, perhaps declare mod_arr(0:N-1) if using 0-based, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Alternatively, adjust indices. \n\nAlternatively, let's see the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ... \n\n    if (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) %2019;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = ... \n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: mod_arr\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. Alternatively, use 1-based and adjust indices. \n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of Fortran code:\n\nFirst, after getting the string S (length N), we need to process each character. \n\nThe variables needed for the second part:\n\n- S: the string (from first part's ans)\n\n- N: length of S.\n\n- mod_arr: array of integers, size N (since in Java it's N elements, from 0 to N-1).\n\n- mod_cnt: array of integers, size 2019 (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018).\n\n- radix: integer, initialized to 1.\n\n- ans2: the final answer (long in Java, so in Fortran use integer*8 or similar).\n\nWait, in Java, the answer is a long, so in Fortran, we can use integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18) to handle large numbers. \n\nSo steps for second part:\n\nInitialize mod_arr and mod_cnt. \n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1 (Java's loop is i from 0 to N-1). \n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < N; i++), so in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = 1, N (if using 1-based), but then adjust the indices. \n\nAlternatively, let's use 0-based in Fortran by declaring arrays with lower bound 0. \n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower bounds. So:\n\ninteger, parameter :: mod_size = 2019\n\ninteger :: N, mod_arr(0:N-1), mod_cnt(0:mod_size-1)\n\nWait, but N is variable, so we can't have arrays with variable size unless using allocatable arrays. \n\nAh, right. In Fortran, for variable-length arrays, we can use allocatable arrays. \n\nSo, after getting the string S, we can compute N = len_trim(S). \n\nThen, allocate mod_arr(0:N-1), mod_cnt(0:2018). \n\nBut in Fortran 90+, this is possible. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nAfter computing ans from first part:\n\nConvert ans to a string S. \n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nallocate mod_arr(0:N-1), mod_cnt(0:2018)\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0. \n\nradix =1\n\ndo i =0, N-1\n\n    current_char = S(N - i)  (Wait, in Java, the code processes the string from the end. Let me see:\n\nIn Java code:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N-1 -i) - '0') * radix %2019;\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the index in the string is N-1 -i. Because for i=0, it's the last character (since S is 0-based in Java). \n\nIn Fortran, strings are 1-based. So S(1) is first character, S(N) is last. \n\nSo in the loop, for i from 0 to N-1 (Java's i), the character is S(N - i) ?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nJava's S is 0-based. The code uses S.charAt(N-1 -i). \n\nFor i=0: N-1 -0 = N-1 \u2192 the last character (since Java's indices start at 0). \n\nIn Fortran, the string S is 1-based. So the last character is S(N). \n\nSo to get the same character, for i from 0 to N-1 (Java's loop variable), the corresponding Fortran character is S(N - i). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i=0 \u2192 character at position N-1 \u2192 last character (Java's S.length() is N, so indices 0..N-1). \n\nIn Fortran, the last character is S(N). \n\nSo for i=0 in the loop, we need S(N -0) \u2192 S(N). \n\nYes. \n\nSo in the loop over i from 0 to N-1 (Fortran's loop variable):\n\ndigit = ichar(S(N - i)) - ichar('0')\n\nthen multiply by radix mod 2019. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variable can be from 0 to N-1. \n\nWait, in Fortran, loops can have any start and end. \n\nSo:\n\ndo i =0, N-1\n\n    digit = ichar(S(N -i)) - ichar('0_char')\n\n    tmp = mod(digit * radix, 2019)\n\n    if (i ==0) then\n\n        mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n    else\n\n        mod_arr(i) = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n\n    end if\n\n    mod_cnt(mod_arr(i)) = mod_cnt(mod_arr(i)) +1\n\n    radix = mod(radix *10, 2019)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the tmp is added to mod_arr[i-1] only if i !=0. \n\nWait in Java:\n\nif (i !=0) tmp += mod_arr[i-1], then mod 2019. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019\n\nif (i >0) then\n\n    tmp = mod(tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019)\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) +=1 \n\nWait, but in the code, mod_arr is being updated, and mod_cnt is incremented for the new mod_arr(i). \n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\ntmp is computed as (digit * radix) mod 2019. \n\nThen, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, mod 2019. \n\nThen mod_arr[i] = tmp. \n\nThen mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ntmp = mod( (digit * radix), 2019 )\n\nif (i >0) then\n\n    tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1 \n\nThen, update radix: \n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nYes. \n\nAfter the loop, compute the answer. \n\nIn Java, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 before the loop. Wait, no:\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nmod_cnt[0] is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, during the loop, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nAfter the loop, the code does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, why? Let me check the Java code:\n\nThe code after the loop:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i =0; ... ) ans += mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2;\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nmod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. \n\nWait, why? Looking at the code:\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nmod_cnt[0] is initialized as part of the array (all zeros?), then during the loop, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nAfter the loop, the code does mod_cnt[0]++; \n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait the code in Java:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as new int[2019], so all elements are 0. \n\nThen, in the loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. \n\nAfter the loop, the code does mod_cnt[0]++; \n\nWait, why? \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code says:\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\nThen, after the loop:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, that's adding an extra count to 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps that's a mistake? Or maybe it's part of the algorithm. \n\nWait the problem is to count the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring from i to j is divisible by 2019. \n\nThe algorithm uses the fact that for a substring S[i..j], its value mod 2019 is equal to (mod_arr[j] - mod_arr[i-1] * 10^{length} ) mod 2019. But perhaps the way the mod_arr is computed allows for counting pairs where mod_arr[j] == mod_arr[i-1], which would mean their difference is 0 mod 2019. \n\nThe standard approach for this problem is to count the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. \n\nThe code in Java seems to be counting the number of pairs (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], which would correspond to the substring from j+1 to i being divisible by 2019. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is counting the number of pairs (i,j) where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j], and then the number of such pairs is the answer. \n\nThe formula is sum_{k} (count_k choose 2). \n\nBut in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the initial mod_arr[-1] (i=0's previous) is 0, so that the substring starting at 0 (the entire string up to i) would be considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is adding an extra 0 to account for the case where the substring starts at 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code in Java is considering the prefix up to i, and the mod value is stored in mod_arr[i]. \n\nThe number of pairs where mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j] for i < j would be the number of pairs where the substring from j+1 to i has mod 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but the mod_cnt[0] is being incremented to account for the initial 0 (the empty prefix). \n\nWait, in the standard approach for this problem, the initial mod is 0 (the prefix before the first character). \n\nSo the mod array should include the initial 0. \n\nIn the code, the mod_arr starts at index 0, but the initial mod (before any characters) is 0. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach may have missed that. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe loop starts at i=0, and for each i, mod_arr[i] is computed as the mod of the substring from the end up to that point. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is not considering the initial 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the mod_cnt[0] is being incremented to account for the initial 0. \n\nWait, in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1. \n\nSo the total count for 0 is increased by 1. \n\nThis would account for the case where the prefix up to i has mod 0, and the initial 0 (the empty prefix) is considered. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nSo in Fortran, after the loop over i from 0 to N-1, we need to do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1. \n\nThen, compute the answer as the sum over all mod values of (mod_cnt(k)*(mod_cnt(k)-1)/2). \n\nIn Fortran, integer division is okay, but need to ensure that the multiplication doesn't overflow. Since mod_cnt can be up to N (the length of the string), which can be up to, say, 18 digits (if the first program's ans is up to 1e18, then the string length is 18). So mod_cnt can be up to 18, so mod_cnt*(mod_cnt-1)/2 is manageable as integer. \n\nBut in the code, the answer is a long, so in Fortran, using integer(8) for ans2. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N from input (first program's input).\n\n2. Compute ans (first program's output).\n\n3. Convert ans to a string S.\n\n4. Process S through the second program's algorithm to get ans2.\n\n5. Print ans2.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, count, temp, ans, i, digit, N_str, radix, mod_size = 2019\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S_str\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(0:mod_size-1) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger(8) :: ans2\n\n!

Wait, but division by 2 must be integer. \n\n    ! Alternatively, compute as (mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1))/2\n\n    ans2 = ans2 + (mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1))/2\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans2\n\ndeallocate(mod_arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, when converting ans to S_str, the write statement may have leading spaces if the length is less than 20. So using len_trim is okay. \n\nWait, the write statement to S_str: \n\nwrite(S_str, '(i0)') ans\n\nThis will write the integer ans into the character variable S_str, starting at the first character, with no leading spaces. The rest of the characters are blank, but len_trim will get the correct length. \n\nTesting this: if ans is 123, then S_str is '123' followed by 17 spaces. len_trim(S_str) is 3. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nNow, the loop for the second part:\n\nWait, in the code above, the loop over i from 0 to N_str-1:\n\ndigit = ichar(S_str(N_str -i)) - ichar('0')\n\nWait, let's see for i=0:\n\nN_str -i = N_str \u2192 the last character of S_str (since S_str(1) is first, S_str(N_str) is last). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThe rest of the code seems okay. \n\nWait, but in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1. \n\nYes, as per the Java code. \n\nThen, the ans2 is computed as the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nWait, in the code, the loop is:\n\ndo i=0, mod_size-1\n\n    ans2 += mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nYes. \n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1) is even, it's okay. \n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The exponentiation in the first part: 10**i can be very large. For example, if count is 18, then 10^17 is a big number. But in Fortran, integers can be 32 or 64 bits. If N is up to 1e18, then 10^17 is 1e17, which is within 64-bit integer. So using integer*8 for ans and variables in the first part may be necessary. \n\nWait, in the first part, variables like N, count, temp, ans are declared as integers. In Fortran, default integer is 4 bytes (32 bits), which can only hold up to 2^31-1 (~2e9). But if N is up to 1e18, then 10^17 is way larger. \n\nAh, this is a problem. \n\nThe first program's variables must be able to handle very large numbers. \n\nIn the first part, when N is up to 1e18, then 10^(count-1) can be up to 1e17 (if count is 18). \n\nSo in Fortran, the variables N, temp, ans must be 64-bit integers. \n\nTherefore, in the code, we need to declare them as integer(8) or use a kind parameter. \n\nSo modifying the first part variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: N, temp, ans\n\ncount is the number of digits, which is up to 18, so integer is okay. \n\nSimilarly, in the exponentiation terms like 10**i, since i can be up to 18, 10^18 is 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer. \n\nSo changing the first part variables to integer(8):\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: N, count, temp, ans\n\ninteger :: i, digit, N_str, radix, mod_size = 2019\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S_str\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(0:mod_size-1) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger(8) :: ans2\n\n! First part: compute ans\n\n! Read N\n\nread*, N\n\n! Compute count (number of digits)\n\ncount = 0\n\ntemp = N\n\ndo while (temp >0_8)\n\n    temp = temp /10_8\n\n    count = count +1\n\nend do\n\nans =0_8\n\ndo i=1, count\n\n    if (i == count) then\n\n        if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (N - 10_8**(i-1) +1_8)\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        if (i ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans +9_8\n\n        else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (10_8**i - 10_8**(i-1))\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! ... rest of code as before, but with mod_arr and mod_cnt as integers, since the mod is 2019.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the exponents are 10**i, which in Fortran with integer(8) variables should be okay. \n\nYes, using 10_8 as the base ensures that the exponentiation is done in 64-bit integers. \n\nSo that's fixed. \n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, the mod_arr and mod_cnt are integers. Since mod 2019 can be up to 2018, integers are okay. \n\nThe radix variable is also okay as integer. \n\nThe ans2 is declared as integer(8), which is correct. \n\nNow, testing the code for a sample input. \n\nLet me take a sample input for the first program. \n\nSuppose N=123. \n\nFirst program's output is 9 (for 1-digit) + 24 (for 3-digit) = 33. \n\nThen the second program's input is the string \"33\". \n\nProcessing \"33\":\n\nThe second program's code would compute the number of pairs of indices where the substring is divisible by 2019. \n\nThe string is \"33\", length 2. \n\nProcessing each character from the end (i from 0 to 1):\n\ni=0:\n\ndigit = S_str(2 -0) \u2192 S_str(2) is '3'\n\nradix starts at 1. \n\ntmp = 3 *1 mod2019 \u21923. \n\nSince i=0, no previous mod_arr. \n\nmod_arr(0)=3. \n\nmod_cnt(3) becomes 1. \n\nradix becomes 1*10 mod2019 \u219210. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigit = S_str(2-1)=S_str(1) \u2192 '3'\n\ntmp = 3 *10 mod2019 \u219230. \n\nAdd mod_arr(0)=3 \u2192 30+3=33 mod2019 \u219233. \n\nmod_arr(1)=33. \n\nmod_cnt(33) becomes 1. \n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod2019 \u2192100. \n\nAfter loop, mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1 \u2192 mod_cnt(0) is 1 (from initial 0, then adding 1). \n\nWait, no. Initially mod_cnt is all zero. \n\nAfter the loop:\n\nmod_cnt(3) is 1 (from i=0), mod_cnt(33) is 1 (from i=1). \n\nmod_cnt(0) was 0, then after mod_cnt(0) +=1 \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nSo the counts are:\n\nmod 0:1\n\nmod3:1\n\nmod33:1\n\nothers 0. \n\nThe answer is (1 choose 2) for mod0 \u2192 0, plus others. So total ans2 is 0. \n\nWhich is correct because the substrings are \"3\", \"3\", \"33\". None divisible by 2019. \n\nSo the code would output 0. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose the first program's output is 2019. \n\nThen the second program's input is \"2019\". \n\nThe string length is 4. \n\nProcessing each character from the end (i from 0 to 3):\n\ni=0 \u2192 character at position 4 (the last '9'):\n\ndigit =9. \n\nradix is 1. \n\ntmp =9 *1 mod2019 \u21929. \n\nmod_arr(0)=9. \n\nmod_cnt(9) =1. \n\nradix becomes 10. \n\ni=1 \u2192 character at position 3 (the '1'):\n\ndigit=1. \n\ntmp =1 *10 mod2019 \u219210. \n\nAdd mod_arr(0)=9 \u219210+9=19 mod2019 \u219219. \n\nmod_arr(1)=19. \n\nmod_cnt(19) +=1. \n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod2019 \u2192100. \n\ni=2 \u2192 character at position 2 (the '0'):\n\ndigit=0. \n\ntmp =0 *100 mod2019 \u21920. \n\nAdd mod_arr(1)=19 \u21920+19=19 mod2019 \u219219. \n\nmod_arr(2)=19. \n\nmod_cnt(19) becomes 2. \n\nradix becomes 100*10 mod2019 \u21921000 mod2019. \n\ni=3 \u2192 character at position 1 (the '2'):\n\ndigit=2. \n\ntmp =2 *1000 mod2019 \u21922000 mod2019 is 2000-2019= -19 mod2019 \u21922000 mod2019 is 2000. \n\nWait 2000 mod2019 is 2000. \n\nThen add mod_arr(2)=19 \u21922000 +19 =2019 mod2019 \u21920. \n\nmod_arr(3)=0. \n\nmod_cnt(0) becomes 1 (from initial 0, then after loop, mod_cnt(0) was 0, then after this step, mod_cnt(0) is 1 (from mod_arr(3)=0). \n\nThen after the loop, mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1 \u2192 becomes 2. \n\nSo mod_cnt(0) is 2. \n\nmod_cnt(9)=1, mod_cnt(19)=2, mod_cnt(0)=2. \n\nThe answer is (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) for mod19? \n\nWait mod19 has count 2 \u2192 2*1/2 =1. \n\nmod0 has 2 \u2192 2*1/2 =1. \n\nTotal ans2 =1+1=2. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe substrings of \"2019\" that are divisible by 2019:\n\nThe entire string \"2019\" is 2019 \u2192 divisible by 2019 \u2192 count as one pair (i=0 and i=3? Or the indices?)\n\nWait the algorithm counts the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring from j+1 to i has mod 0. \n\nWait the mod array is computed as follows:\n\nmod_arr[i] is the mod of the suffix starting from the end up to position i (in the reversed processing). \n\nWait perhaps it's better to think that the mod array represents the mod of the substring from the end up to the current position. \n\nAlternatively, the algorithm's logic is such that the number of pairs is the number of times a mod value occurs, and each pair contributes to the count. \n\nIn this case, mod0 occurs twice (mod_arr(3)=0 and the initial 0 added). \n\nWait after the loop, mod_cnt(0) was 1 (from mod_arr(3)=0). Then adding 1 gives 2. \n\nSo the pairs are (the initial 0 and mod_arr(3)=0 \u2192 that's one pair. \n\nAlso, any other pairs where mod is 0? \n\nYes, so the total for mod0 is 2 choose 2 \u21921. \n\nThe mod19 has count 2 (from mod_arr(1)=19 and mod_arr(2)=19). \n\nSo 2 choose 2 \u21921. \n\nTotal ans2 is 2. \n\nWhich corresponds to the two substrings: \n\nThe substring \"19\" (positions 3-4?), or perhaps the substring \"2019\" (the entire string) and the substring \"0\" (but 0 mod2019 is 0, but the substring \"0\" is part of the string. \n\nWait perhaps the two pairs are:\n\n- The substring \"2019\" (the entire string) \u2192 mod0.\n\n- The substring \"19\" (the last two digits) \u2192 19 mod2019 is 19, but wait no. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nThe mod array for the example \"2019\" (string length 4):\n\nmod_arr(0) =9 (from the last '9')\n\nmod_arr(1)=19 (from '1' and previous 9)\n\nmod_arr(2)=19 (from '0' and previous 19 \u2192 0*10 +19 mod2019 \u219219)\n\nmod_arr(3)=0 (from '2' and previous 19 \u2192 2*1000 mod2019 is 2000 mod2019 is 2000, plus 19 \u2192 2019 mod2019 \u21920)\n\nSo mod_arr(3) is 0. \n\nThe mod values are:\n\nmod_arr(0)=9 \u2192 count 1\n\nmod_arr(1)=19 \u2192 count 1\n\nmod_arr(2)=19 \u2192 count 2\n\nmod_arr(3)=0 \u2192 count 1 (before adding the initial 0)\n\nAfter adding the initial 0, mod_cnt(0) becomes 2 (the initial 0 and mod_arr(3)=0). \n\nSo the pairs for mod0 are between the initial 0 (counted as an extra) and mod_arr(3)=0 \u2192 that's one pair. \n\nThe other pair is between mod_arr(1)=19 and mod_arr(2)=19 \u2192 that's one pair. \n\nTotal 2, which matches the calculation. \n\nThus the code should be correct. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code should be as written above, with the necessary integer kinds for the first part."
