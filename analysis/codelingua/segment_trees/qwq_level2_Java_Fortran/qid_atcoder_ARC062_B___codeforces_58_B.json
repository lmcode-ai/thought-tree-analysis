    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ARC062_B). The main part reads input using an InputReader, which reads from System.in. The TaskD class's solve method takes a string S, then calculates a score. The logic is: for each character in S, if the index is even, my choice is 'g', else 'p'. Compare with the character in S. If they are different, add 1 if my choice was 'p', subtract 1 if 'g'. Then output the total score.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer n, then prints n followed by a decreasing sequence where each next number is a divisor of the previous. It starts from n, then for each i from n-1 down to 1, if m (current number) is divisible by i, then print i and set m to i. So the output is a space-separated list starting with n, then the next numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe user wants these two programs to be translated into a single Fortran program. The key points are that the first program's output is the input to the second. But since we have to combine them into one Fortran program, the first part's processing must be done first, then the second's, with the output of the first being the input to the second. But since it's a single program, we can't have I/O in between. So the first part's result (the score) must be used as the input to the second part's processing (the second program's input is an integer n, which here would be the score from the first part).\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is the score (an integer), and the second Java program takes an integer n as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second. Therefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) will process the input string S, compute the score, then pass that score to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program) which will generate the sequence and output it. So the Fortran program must read the input S, compute the score, then use that score as n in the second part's code, then output the result of the second part.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string S from stdin.\n2. Compute the score as per the first Java program's logic.\n3. Use that score as the n for the second part's processing.\n4. Compute the sequence as per the second Java program's logic.\n5. Output the final result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (score calculation):\n\nThe first Java program's TaskD's solve method:\n\n- S is the input string.\n- For each character in S (from index 0 to len-1):\n   - my is 'g' if even index, 'p' if odd.\n   - his is the current character.\n   - if my != his, then add 1 if my is 'p', subtract 1 if 'g'.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nif (my != his) {\n    score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even index), and his is different, then subtract 1. When my is 'p' (odd index), and his is different, add 1.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nmy is 'g' when i is even (0-based). So for each position i:\n\nif my (g or p) is not equal to his (the character in S at i), then:\n\nif my is 'p' (so i is odd), then add 1 to the score.\n\nElse (my is 'g', i even), subtract 1.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nscore += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1;\n\nSo when my is 'p', add 1, else subtract 1. So the condition is based on my's value, not his. So the difference between my and his causes the score to change based on my's choice.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the string S, loop over each character, compute the my character, check if it's different from the current character, then adjust the score accordingly.\n\nSecond part (sequence generation):\n\nThe second Java program takes n, then outputs n followed by a space, then for each i from n-1 down to 1, if the current m (starting at n) is divisible by i, then output i and set m to i. The output is a space-separated list.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program is:\n\nint m = n;\nSystem.out.print(n + \" \");\nfor (int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\n    if (m%i ==0) {\n        System.out.print(i + \" \");\n        m =i;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); but that would print n followed by a space and a new line? Wait, no, the code says System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would print n followed by a space and then a new line. But in the loop, the next prints are System.out.println(i + \" \"); which would also add a new line each time. Wait, that's probably a mistake. Looking at the code:\n\nWait, the code for the second program is:\n\npublic class codeforces_58_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first print is a println, so after n, a space and a new line. Then each subsequent print is also a println, so each number is on its own line with a space. But the problem says the output should be a space-separated list. Maybe the code has a typo, perhaps it should be print instead of println. Because otherwise the output would be each number on a new line. Let me check the problem statement for codeforces 58B. Wait, the user provided the code, so I have to follow exactly what the code does. The code as written would output n followed by a space and a newline, then each subsequent number followed by a space and a newline. So the output would be like:\n\nn \ni1 \ni2 \n...\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a single line. However, the user's instruction is to translate the code exactly, so I have to follow the code's behavior.\n\nWait, but the code's first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which outputs n followed by a space and a new line. Then each subsequent System.out.println(i + \" \"); does the same. So the output would be each number on its own line with a trailing space. But maybe the problem expects a single line. However, since the user provided the code, I have to replicate exactly what the code does. So in Fortran, the output should be the same.\n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps the code is intended to print all numbers in one line, but the code uses println. Hmm, but I have to follow the code as given.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's processing would take the score from the first part as n, then generate the sequence as per the code.\n\nNow, putting this into Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must read the input string S from stdin, compute the score, then compute the sequence based on that score, then output the sequence as per the second Java program's code.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nRead the input string S. In Fortran, reading a string can be done with read(*,*) or read(*,'(A)') to get the entire line. Since the first Java program's InputReader reads tokens, but in the first program, the input is a single string (since in.next() is called once, which would read the next token, but perhaps the input is a single line with the string S. Wait, looking at the first Java program's InputReader's next() method: it reads tokens, splitting on whitespace. But in the first program, the code is S = in.next(); so S is the first token. So the input for the first Java program is a single string (the entire input line?), but perhaps the problem expects S to be the entire input line. Wait, the problem for the first Java program (ARC062 B) is probably from a programming contest, where the input is a single string S given as the first (and only) token. So in Fortran, we can read the entire line as a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a string from stdin, perhaps using:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut need to make sure the length is sufficient. Alternatively, use a parameter. Let's assume the maximum length is 1000.\n\nThen, compute the score:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over each character in s (from index 1 to len_trim(s)), since Fortran is 1-based.\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 (since in Java, i starts at 0). So in Fortran, for position i (1-based), the Java index is i-1. So if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even index in Java \u2192 my_char is 'g', else 'p'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i runs from 0 to S.length()-1. So for Fortran's i (1-based), the Java index is i-1. So:\n\nif (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even \u2192 my is 'g'\n\nelse \u2192 odd \u2192 my is 'p'\n\nThen, compare with the current character (s(i:i)).\n\nIf my_char is not equal to s(i:i), then:\n\nif my_char is 'p', add 1 to score.\n\nelse (my is 'g'), subtract 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n    if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n        my = 'g'\n    else\n        my = 'p'\n    end if\n    his = s(i:i)\n    if (my /= his) then\n        if (my == 'p') then\n            score = score +1\n        else\n            score = score -1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nThat's the first part.\n\nThen, the second part takes the score as n, and processes it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second part's logic:\n\nInitialize m = n.\n\nPrint n followed by a space and a new line (using write(*,*) n, ' ' \u2192 but in Fortran, to get a space, perhaps need to format it properly. Wait, the Java code uses System.out.println(n + \" \"); which appends a space and a new line. So in Fortran, to write n followed by a space and a new line, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\nthen a new line. Wait, but in Fortran, the new line is handled by the format. Alternatively, using:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, 1X)') n\n\nWait, but the exact output must match. Let me think: the Java code's first print is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nSo the output is the integer n, followed by a space, then a new line. So in Fortran, to do that, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\nthen a new line. But the default write statement in Fortran adds a new line. So the above would write n followed by a space, then a new line. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n    if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n        write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n        m = i\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the Java code uses System.out.println(i + \" \"); which again appends a space and a new line. So each of these writes would have the same format.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first print, the loop's prints also do println, so each is on a new line with a trailing space. So the Fortran code must do the same.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, each write statement with a format that ends with a comma would not add a new line, but the default is to add a new line. Wait, the format in the first write is (I0, A), which writes the integer and the space, then the record is ended, so a new line is added. So each write statement for the loop would produce a line with the number followed by a space and a new line.\n\nBut the problem is that the second Java program's code may have a mistake. For example, the first line is a println, so the output is:\n\nn followed by a space and a new line.\n\nThen, each subsequent print is also a println, so each number is on its own line with a space and new line. So the output would be:\n\nn [space]\n[new line]\ni1 [space]\n[new line]\ni2 [space]\n[new line]\n...\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a single line. However, since the user provided the code, I must replicate exactly what the code does.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code must produce the same output.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string S.\n\n2. Compute the score as per first Java program.\n\n3. Use the score as n in the second part.\n\n4. Compute the sequence and output as per second Java program.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\ninteger :: score, n, m, i, len_s\n\n! Read input\nread(*, '(A)') s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\n! Compute score\nscore = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s\n    if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n        my_char = 'g'\n    else\n        my_char = 'p'\n    end if\n    his_char = s(i:i)\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n            score = score + 1\n        else\n            score = score -1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\n! Now, second part: process score as n\nn = score\nm = n\n\n! Output first part\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\n! Now loop from n-1 down to 1\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n    if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n        write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n        m = i\n    end if\nend do\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but variables my_char and his_char need to be declared. Let me check:\n\nIn the code above, variables my_char and his_char are used but not declared. Need to add declarations.\n\nSo, variables:\n\ncharacter :: my_char, his_char\n\nAlso, in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so s is a character array. The loop over each character is okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nhis_char = s(i:i)\n\nYes, that's correct in Fortran.\n\nSo adding the declarations:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\ninteger :: score, n, m, i, len_s\ncharacter :: my_char, his_char\n\n! Read input\nread(*, '(A)') s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nscore = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s\n    if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n        my_char = 'g'\n    else\n        my_char = 'p'\n    end if\n    his_char = s(i:i)\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n            score = score + 1\n        else\n            score = score -1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nn = score\nm = n\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n    if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n        write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n        m = i\n    end if\nend do\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop, the loop starts at n-1 and goes down to 1, stepping by -1. The loop control variable i is initialized as n-1, then decremented by 1 each time until it reaches 1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop is written as:\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSuppose S is \"gp\".\n\nIndices (Java 0-based):\n\ni=0 (even): my is 'g', his is 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1 (odd): my is 'p', his is 'p' \u2192 same \u2192 no change. So score is 0.\n\nThen the second part would take n=0. But in the second Java program, n is read as an integer. However, in the first program's code, the score can be negative? Let's see.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the score can be negative. For example, if all characters are different and my is 'g' (even indices), then each such case subtracts 1. So the score can be negative.\n\nBut in the second Java program, the code takes n as input. So if the first program's output is a negative number, then the second program would process it. But in the second Java code, the loop is from n-1 down to 1. If n is 0, then n-1 is -1, so the loop would not execute (since the upper limit is 1, and the step is -1, but starting at -1 which is less than 1). So the output would be 0 followed by a space and a new line, then nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: S is \"gg\".\n\nFirst character (i=0, even): my 'g', his 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\nSecond character (i=1, odd): my 'p', his 'g' \u2192 different. Since my is 'p', add 1. So total score is 1.\n\nThen the second part's n is 1. The loop starts at 0 (since n-1 is 0), but the loop runs from 0 down to 1? Wait, no. The loop is from n-1 (0) down to 1, but since 0 < 1, the loop doesn't execute. So the output is 1 followed by a space and new line, then nothing else. So the output is \"1 \" followed by a new line.\n\nWait, but the second Java code's first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which for n=1 would output \"1 \" followed by a new line. Then the loop starts at 0, which is less than 1, so the loop doesn't run. So the output is as expected.\n\nAnother test case for the second part: n=6.\n\nThe sequence would be 6 followed by 3 (since 6 mod 3 is 0, then m becomes 3. Then check 2: 3 mod 2 is 1, so no. Then 1: 3 mod 1 is 0, so print 1. So the output would be:\n\n6 \n3 \n1 \n\nEach on their own lines with a trailing space.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nn=6, m=6.\n\nFirst print: 6 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from 5 down to 1:\n\ni=5: 6 mod5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: 6 mod3 is 0 \u2192 yes. Print 3 followed by space and new line. m becomes 3.\n\ni=2: 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: 3 mod1 is 0 \u2192 yes. Print 1 followed by space and new line. m becomes 1.\n\nSo the output lines are:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nEach with a trailing space and new line.\n\nIn Fortran, the code should produce the same.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the loop for i from n-1 down to 1:\n\nfor n=6, the loop runs i from 5 down to 1.\n\nAt i=3, mod(6,3)=0 \u2192 yes. So write 3 followed by space and new line. Then m becomes 3.\n\nThen when i=2, m is 3. mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: mod(3,1)=0 \u2192 yes. So write 1 followed by space and new line.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The first part's string reading. If the input has leading or trailing spaces, but according to the first Java program, the input is read as the next token, which is the first word. But in Fortran, the read(*, '(A)') reads the entire line, so the string S would include any leading/trailing spaces. However, in the Java code, the InputReader's next() method splits on whitespace, so S would be the first token. So if the input line is \"abc def\", then the Java code would read \"abc\" as S, but the Fortran code would read \"abc def\" (if the entire line is read). Wait, this is a problem.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The first Java program's InputReader's next() method reads the next token (split by whitespace). So the input S is the first token. But in the Fortran code, if we read the entire line, then S would include all characters until the end of line, but the Java code would split on whitespace. So the Fortran code may be reading more than intended.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code is:\n\nString S = in.next();\n\nThe InputReader's next() method reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So S is the first token in the input. So the input could be, for example, \"abc def\" \u2192 S is \"abc\".\n\nBut in the Fortran code, if we read the entire line into s, then len_trim(s) would be the entire line, including \" def\", which is incorrect.\n\nSo this is a critical error. The Fortran code must read the first token, not the entire line.\n\nHmm, so how to read the first token in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, the default read(*,*) would read until whitespace, but if the input is a string, it might have issues with spaces. Alternatively, perhaps using a list-directed read.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nIn the first Java program, the input is read as a single token (the first word). So in Fortran, to read the first word (until whitespace), we can use:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut s is a character variable. However, in Fortran, when reading a character variable with list-directed input, it will read until the next whitespace. So that's exactly what we need.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nSuppose the input is \"abc def\".\n\nThen read(*,*) s would read \"abc\" into s (assuming s is a character variable of sufficient length). The rest (\" def\") would remain in the input buffer, but since the second part of the Fortran program doesn't read anything else, that's okay. Wait, but the second part doesn't need any input. The second part's input is the score from the first part. So the rest of the input (after the first token) is irrelevant and can be ignored.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to read S is to read the first token (the first word) as a string.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut in Fortran, when using list-directed input, the input is read until a whitespace. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the length of s must be sufficient. So if the input is a very long string (like 1000 characters), then the len=1000 may be insufficient. But given that the original Java code uses a BufferedReader with a buffer of 32768, but in programming contest problems, the input length is usually within reasonable limits. So assuming the input S is up to 1000 characters, the code should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, to read the entire line but then take the first token, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, use a format that reads the first word. But list-directed is easier.\n\nSo changing the read statement to:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading into a character variable with list-directed input, it reads until whitespace. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if the input is \"abc def\", then read(*,*) s will read \"abc\" into s, and the rest remains unread. Since the second part doesn't need any more input, that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the corrected code for reading S is:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut then, the length of s must be sufficient. So the declaration should be:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nSo the first part's read is fixed.\n\nNow, the code becomes:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\ninteger :: score, n, m, i, len_s\ncharacter :: my_char, his_char\n\n! Read input\nread(*,*) s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nscore = 0\ndo i = 1, len_s\n    if (mod(i-1, 2) == 0) then\n        my_char = 'g'\n    else\n        my_char = 'p'\n    end if\n    his_char = s(i:i)\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n            score = score + 1\n        else\n            score = score -1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\nn = score\nm = n\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n    if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n        write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n        m = i\n    end if\nend do\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using list-directed input (read(*,*)), if the input is something like \"abc\", it will read it correctly. But if the input is empty, but that's probably not a case here.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first Java program, the InputReader's next() method may read the entire line if there's no whitespace, but in the case of a single token, it's okay.\n\nNow, testing the first part with S = \"gp\" (as before):\n\nThe code reads \"gp\" into s. len_trim(s) is 2.\n\nLoop i=1:\n\ni-1=0 \u2192 even \u2192 my_char 'g'\n\nhis_char is 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2:\n\ni-1=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 my_char 'p'\n\nhis_char is 'p' \u2192 same \u2192 no change. So score remains 0.\n\nThen n=0.\n\nSecond part:\n\nwrite n (0) followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from -1 down to 1 \u2192 loop doesn't execute. So output is \"0 \" followed by new line.\n\nWhich matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nAnother test case where S is \"gpp\".\n\nLength 3.\n\nIndices (Java 0-based):\n\ni=0 (even): my 'g', his 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=1 (odd): my 'p', his 'p' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2 (even): my 'g', his 'p' \u2192 different. my is 'g', so subtract 1 \u2192 score becomes -1.\n\nSo n = -1.\n\nSecond part:\n\nn is -1. The first print is -1 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen the loop starts at n-1 = -2, and goes down to 1. Since -2 < 1, the loop doesn't execute. So output is \"-1 \" followed by new line.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case for the second part with n=6 as before.\n\nThe code should output 6 followed by 3 and 1, each with a space and new line.\n\nNow, the Fortran code's write statements:\n\nThe first write is write(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' ' \u2192 which writes the integer followed by a space, then a new line (since the format ends with A, which is a character, but the record is ended, so a new line is added).\n\nThe loop's writes are the same.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, possible issues with the Fortran code:\n\n- The variables my_char and his_char are of type character, which is length 1. That's okay.\n\n- The loop for the second part: when n is 0 or negative, the loop doesn't run, which is correct.\n\n- The mod function in Fortran: mod(m, i) when i is negative? Wait, in the second part, when n is negative, like n=-1, then m is -1. The loop starts at -2, which is less than 1, so no iteration. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n is a positive number, but m becomes negative? For example, if n is 6, but somehow m becomes negative? No, because m starts at n, and in the loop, m is set to i which is positive (since i starts from n-1 down to 1, so i is positive). So m remains positive.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as written above."
