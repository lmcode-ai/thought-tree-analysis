    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (AGC012_A) reads an integer n, then an array of 3n integers. It sorts the array, then takes the sum of the last 2n elements, but every other element starting from the end. Wait, no, let me check again. The code initializes head to array.length - 2, which is 3n - 2. Then in a loop for n times, it adds array[head], then subtracts 2 each time. So for each iteration, it takes the element at head, which starts at 3n-2, then 3n-4, etc., for n times. Since the array is sorted, the largest elements are at the end. So the sum is the sum of the n largest elements, but every second one? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the array is sorted in ascending order. The largest elements are at the end. The head starts at the second last element (since array.length is 3n, so 3n-1 is the last element, so 3n-2 is the second last). Then each step subtracts 2, so the indices would be 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., down to (3n-2) - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. So the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4,..., n. So that's n elements. Since the array is sorted, these are the n largest elements, but every other one starting from the second last. Wait, but why? Because the first element taken is the second last, then the one before that, etc. Wait, no, the step is subtracting 2 each time. So for example, if n is 2, then array length is 6. The head starts at 4 (since 6-2=4, indices 0-based). Then next is 2, then 0? Wait no, for n=2, the loop runs 2 times. So first iteration adds array[4], then head becomes 2, second iteration adds array[2]. So total of two elements. The indices are 4 and 2. The array is sorted, so the elements at 5 (last) is the largest, 4 is second largest, 3 third, etc. So the sum would be the second and fourth largest elements? Hmm, maybe the logic is to pick every other element starting from the second last, but I need to make sure I get that right in Fortran.\n\nThe second Java program (ABC158_A) takes a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two programs. The output of the first Java program is the result of the first program (the sum), which is then used as input to the second program? Wait, no. Wait, when you run them in sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but the second program expects a string input. Wait, the first program outputs a number (the sum), which would be the input to the second program. But the second program reads a string (s = in.next()), so the input to the second program is that number as a string. So the entire process is: take the input for the first program, compute the sum, then that sum is the input to the second program, which checks if the string representation of the sum contains both 'A' and 'B'. Wait, but numbers don't have letters. So the second program would output \"No\" unless the sum is something like \"AB\", but that's impossible. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which when read as a string by the second program would be just the digits. So the second program would check if that string has both 'A' and 'B', which it can't, so the output would always be \"No\". But that seems odd. Wait, maybe the problem is that the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence where the output of the first is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number, and the second expects a string. So perhaps the second program is not using the first's output? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program's code: it reads a string s via in.next(), which would be the next token. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, then the second program would read that as the string \"123\", so it would check for 'A' and 'B', which are not present, so output \"No\". So the final output would be \"No\" unless the first program's output is a string containing both letters. But the first program outputs a number. So the second program's output is always \"No\". But maybe the actual problem is different. Wait, perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but in the problem's context, maybe the second program is expecting a different input. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence where the first's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a string, so the input would be that number as a string. So the second program checks if that string has both 'A' and 'B', which it can't, so the final output is \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program (n and 3n integers), process them as per the first program, then take the resulting sum, pass it as input to the second program's logic (i.e., check if the string representation of the sum contains both 'A' and 'B'), and output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and 3n integers from input.\n\n2. Sort the array.\n\n3. Compute the sum as per the first Java program.\n\n4. Convert the sum to a string.\n\n5. Check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B' (which it won't, but code must do that).\n\n6. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to do these steps?\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the input is read from stdin, and output to stdout. The first program's input is n followed by 3n integers. The second program's input is the output of the first, which is the sum as a number. But the second program expects a string, so the sum is written as a string. So in Fortran, the entire process is:\n\nRead n and 3n integers.\n\nProcess them to get the sum (as per first Java program).\n\nThen, take that sum, convert to a string, and check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nBut since the sum is a number, its string representation will only have digits, so the check will always be \"No\".\n\nBut the code must do exactly what the Java sequence does, so even if it's always \"No\", that's the correct behavior.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran steps:\n\nFirst, read n, then 3n integers into an array. Sort the array. Then compute the sum as the sum of every second element starting from the second last element, for n elements.\n\nWait, let me re-express the first Java program's algorithm:\n\nAfter sorting the array in ascending order, the code picks the elements at indices (3n-2), (3n-4), ..., down to (3n-2 - 2*(n-1)) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. So the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., n. Each step subtracts 2, so for n elements. The sum is the sum of those elements.\n\nWait, let's see for n=1: 3n=3 elements. The array is sorted. The head starts at 1 (3*1-2=1). Then add array[1], then head becomes -1? Wait no, n=1, the loop runs once. So the index is 1. The elements are indices 0,1,2. The largest elements are at 2,1,0? Wait no, sorted in ascending order, so the largest is at 2. The second largest is 1, third is 0. So the code picks the second largest (index 1) for n=1. So the sum is array[1].\n\nWait, but why not the largest? Because the head starts at 3n-2, which for n=1 is 1. So the first element is array[1], which is the second largest. Hmm, that's interesting. So the algorithm is taking the second, fourth, etc., elements from the end. So the sum is the sum of the elements at positions (3n-2), (3n-4), ..., (n). So for n=2, 3n=6 elements. The indices would be 4, 2. The elements at 4 and 2 (since sorted in ascending order, the elements at 5 is largest, 4 is second, 3 third, 2 fourth, etc. So the sum is the second and fourth largest elements. So the first Java program's logic is to pick every other element starting from the second last element, for n elements. So the sum is the sum of those elements.\n\nNow, in Fortran, to do this:\n\nFirst, read n, then 3n integers. Sort them in ascending order. Then, starting from index (3n-2) (Fortran arrays are 1-based?), wait, in Java arrays are 0-based. So in Fortran, if we use 1-based arrays, then the equivalent indices would be adjusted. Let me think:\n\nIn Java, the array is 0-based. So for a length of 3n, the last element is at index 3n-1. The head starts at 3n-2 (second last). So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, the last element is at 3n, so the second last is 3n-1. So the head would start at 3n-1 -1? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's array indices: 0 to 3n-1. The head is initialized to 3n-2 (second last element). So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based with size 3n, the second last element is at 3n-1. So the head starts at 3n-1. Then each step subtracts 2. So for n elements, the indices would be 3n-1, 3n-3, ..., down to (3n-1) - 2*(n-1) = 3n-1 -2n +2 = (3n -2n) + ( -1 +2) = n +1. Wait, let's see for n=1: 3n=3 elements. The starting index is 2 (3*1-1=2). Then subtract 2 gives 0, but since n=1, only one iteration. So the index is 2. Which is the last element (since 3 elements, indices 1,2,3? Wait no, in Fortran 1-based, 3 elements are 1,2,3. So the second last is 2. So the head starts at 2 (3n-1 = 3-1=2). So for n=1, the sum is array[2], which is the largest element. Wait, but in the Java code for n=1, the head starts at 1 (since 3*1-2=1), so the element is array[1], which is the second largest. Wait, this discrepancy is because of 0-based vs 1-based arrays. So in Fortran, the indices need to be adjusted.\n\nHmm, this is a critical point. Let me re-express the Java code's algorithm in terms of 1-based arrays:\n\nJava's array is 0-based, length 3n. The head starts at 3n-2 (second last element). The elements are sorted in ascending order. So the elements from 0 to 3n-1 are in order. The second last element is at 3n-2, which is the second largest. The first element taken is that, then subtract 2 each time. So for n elements, the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., down to (3n-2) - 2*(n-1) = 3n-2 -2n +2 = n. So the indices are 3n-2, 3n-4, ..., n. The elements are the second largest, fourth largest, etc., but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is designed to pick the n largest elements, but every other one. Wait, maybe the idea is that when you sort the array, the largest elements are at the end. To get the top 2n elements, but then pick every other one starting from the second last. Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the sum is the sum of the n elements which are the second, fourth, etc., in the top 2n elements. Not sure, but the code is as written.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran, using 1-based arrays, the equivalent indices would be:\n\nJava's 0-based index x corresponds to Fortran's x+1. So the head in Java starts at 3n-2 (0-based), which is 3n-1 in 1-based. So in Fortran, the starting index is 3n-1 (since 3n elements, the last is 3n, so second last is 3n-1). Then each step subtracts 2. So the indices are 3n-1, 3n-3, ..., down to (3n-1) - 2*(n-1) = 3n-1 -2n +2 = (3n-2n) + ( -1 +2) = n +1. Wait, so for n=1, that gives 1+1=2, which is correct (the second element in 1-based is the second last of 3 elements). So the indices in Fortran would be 3n-1, 3n-3, ..., n+1. So the number of elements is n, since each step subtracts 2, and starting from 3n-1, after n steps, the last index is 3n-1 - 2*(n-1) = 3n-1 -2n +2 = n+1. So the indices are correct.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after sorting the array in ascending order (so the largest elements are at the end), the sum is the sum of the elements at positions (3n-1), (3n-3), ..., (n+1). So the code needs to:\n\n- Read n, then 3n integers into an array.\n\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n- Initialize head to 3n-1 (the second last element in 1-based array).\n\n- Sum the elements at head, then head -=2, n times.\n\nThen, take that sum, convert it to a string, and check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to do these steps.\n\nFirst, reading the input:\n\nRead n, then 3n integers. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, i, total_elements\n\nread(*,*) n\n\ntotal_elements = 3 * n\n\nallocate an array of size total_elements.\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: array\n\nallocate(array(total_elements))\n\ndo i = 1, total_elements\n\n   read(*,*) array(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, sort the array in ascending order. Fortran has a sort function, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, use a sorting routine. Since the problem is from programming competition, perhaps the code can use the intrinsic function. In Fortran 90 and later, there is the 'sort' function. Wait, actually, the 'sort' is part of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module, but perhaps the simplest way is to use the 'merge sort' or use the built-in function. Alternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check:\n\nIn Fortran, to sort an array in ascending order, you can use the 'sort' intrinsic. For example:\n\ncall merge_sort(array)\n\nBut I think the standard way is to use the 'sort' function from the ISO module. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Wait, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function as follows:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\nBut I need to confirm. Alternatively, use a loop-based sort. Since the problem may require a straightforward approach, perhaps using the built-in sort is better. Let me assume that the code can use the 'sort' function. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'merge_sort' function. Wait, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check the syntax.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the 'sort' is part of the intrinsic functions. For example, the array can be sorted using:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\nBut I need to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function as follows:\n\narray = sort(array)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'merge_sort' function. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use a simple bubble sort for small n. Since the problem's first program is from a programming contest, the input size may be manageable. But for code correctness, better to use a proper sort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Let me look up: in Fortran 90, there is no built-in sort function. Oh right, that's a problem. So I need to implement a sorting routine.\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Since the first Java program uses Arrays.sort(), which is a quicksort or mergesort, but in Fortran, I need to implement a sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO_C_BINDING or some other module? Probably not. So perhaps the code can use a simple bubble sort for the array. Since the problem may have constraints on n (like n up to 1e5?), but in programming contests, sometimes the code can use a sort. Alternatively, use a selection sort. But for code brevity, perhaps a bubble sort is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'heap sort' or 'quick sort' code. Let me think of a simple way.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic, but I think that's not available. So perhaps the code can use the 'merge sort' algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'ieee_arithmetic' module? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'iso_fortran_env' module? Probably not.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since the first Java program uses Arrays.sort(), which is O(n log n), but in Fortran, without a built-in sort, I need to implement it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'stdlib' library, but assuming that the code must be standard Fortran, I can't rely on that.\n\nTherefore, I need to write a sorting routine. Let's choose a simple one, like bubble sort, but for large n, it might be slow, but perhaps the problem's constraints allow it. Alternatively, use a selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, use a quicksort implementation. Let me think of a quicksort code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'ieee_arithmetic' module? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'iso_fortran_env' module. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the 'ieee_arithmetic' module. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with implementing a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, use a bubble sort for the array. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, code for sorting:\n\ndo i = 1, total_elements -1\n\n   do j = 1, total_elements -i\n\n      if (array(j) > array(j+1)) then\n\n         temp = array(j)\n\n         array(j) = array(j+1)\n\n         array(j+1) = temp\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThis is a bubble sort. It's O(n^2), but for programming contest purposes, maybe acceptable if n is small. Since the first Java program is from an AtCoder problem, perhaps the constraints are manageable. Let's proceed with this for now.\n\nOnce the array is sorted, then compute the sum.\n\nInitialize head to 3n-1 (since in 1-based, the second last element is at 3n-1). Then, for i in 1 to n:\n\nsum += array(head)\n\nhead = head -2\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\nres = 0\n\nhead = 3*n -1\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   res = res + array(head)\n\n   head = head -2\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nThen, after computing res, the second part of the code is to check if the string representation of res contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but res is an integer. So converting it to a string would give digits only, so the check will always be false. But the code must do exactly what the Java sequence does, so proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read, or using an internal write.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nwrite(str, '(I0)') res\n\nThen, check if 'A' and 'B' are present in str.\n\nTo check for presence of characters, perhaps loop through each character in the string and check for existence of 'A' and 'B'.\n\nInitialize flags:\n\nlogical :: hasA = .false., hasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str)\n\n   char = str(i:i)\n\n   if (char == 'A') hasA = .true.\n\n   if (char == 'B') hasB = .true.\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, the string is created with write, but the digits are written as characters. Since res is an integer, the string will only have digits, so hasA and hasB will be false, so output 'No'.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into a single Fortran program.\n\nFirst, read n, then 3n integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the sum.\n\nConvert sum to string.\n\nCheck for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, total_elements\n\n  integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n  integer :: res, head\n\n  character(len=20) :: str\n\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  total_elements = 3 * n\n\n  allocate(array(total_elements))\n\n  do i = 1, total_elements\n\n     read(*,*) array(i)\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Sort the array in ascending order using bubble sort\n\n  do i = 1, total_elements -1\n\n     do j = 1, total_elements -i\n\n        if (array(j) > array(j+1)) then\n\n           array([j, j+1]) = array([j+1, j])  ! This is a swap using array section (Fortran 90+)\n\n        end if\n\n     end do\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Compute the sum\n\n  res = 0\n\n  head = 3*n -1\n\n  do i = 1, n\n\n     res = res + array(head)\n\n     head = head -2\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert res to string\n\n  write(str, '(I0)') res\n\n  ! Check for 'A' and 'B'\n\n  hasA = .false.\n\n  hasB = .false.\n\n  do i = 1, len_trim(str)\n\n     if (str(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n        hasA = .true.\n\n     elseif (str(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n        hasB = .true.\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n     print *, 'Yes'\n\n  else\n\n     print *, 'No'\n\n  end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the swap line, using array([j,j+1]) = array([j+1,j]) is a way to swap in Fortran 90. Alternatively, use a temporary variable:\n\ntemp = array(j)\n\narray(j) = array(j+1)\n\narray(j+1) = temp\n\nBecause maybe the compiler doesn't support array sections for swapping. To be safe, perhaps better to use a temporary variable.\n\nSo modifying the bubble sort part:\n\ninteger :: temp\n\n...\n\ndo i = 1, total_elements -1\n\n   do j = 1, total_elements -i\n\n      if (array(j) > array(j+1)) then\n\n         temp = array(j)\n\n         array(j) = array(j+1)\n\n         array(j+1) = temp\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAnother thing: the 'write(str, '(I0)') res' will write the integer as a string without leading spaces. The len_trim(str) will give the length of the string. The loop over each character is okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: n=1, array [1,2,3]. After sorting: [1,2,3]. head starts at 3*1-1 = 2 (since 3 elements, 1-based indices 1,2,3. The second last is 2. So the sum is array(2) = 2. The string is '2', so no A or B \u2192 output 'No'.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, array [1,3,5,7,9,11]. Sorted: [1,3,5,7,9,11]. head starts at 3*2-1 =5 (since 6 elements, indices 1-6. The second last is 5 (value 9). Then next is 3 (7), so sum is 9+7=16. The string is '16', so output 'No'.\n\nAnother test case where the sum is a string with 'A' and 'B'? Not possible, but code must handle it.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the array is sorted in ascending order. The bubble sort code above sorts in ascending order, so that's correct.\n\nYes, the code should work."
