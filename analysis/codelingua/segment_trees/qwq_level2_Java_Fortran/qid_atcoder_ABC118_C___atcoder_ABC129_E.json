If n is 1, it just outputs that number. Otherwise, it sorts the list and checks if all are zero, then outputs 0. Then there's a loop where it repeatedly applies the 'func' function until the list has one element. The 'func' function processes the list by removing zeros, finding the minimum, and replacing elements with mod by the min, etc. The final answer is the last remaining element.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC129_E) reads a string, processes it with a DP approach, and outputs a result modulo 1e9+7. The DP uses two states, and the transitions depend on the characters in the string.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. But since we need to combine them into a single Fortran program, the first program's output must be the input to the second's processing. Wait, but how are they connected? The first program's output is a number (ans), and the second program's input is a string. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The user says the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. But the first program's output is a number (ans), and the second expects a string (since it reads a line with sc.nextLine()). That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's main: it reads n and then the list a. The output is the 'ans' variable, which is an integer. The second program's main reads a string via nextLine(). So the first program's output (the integer) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. That would mean that the second program is processing the string representation of the first's output. For example, if the first outputs 123, the second would process the string \"123\".\n\nTherefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the integer result, then pass that as a string to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program). But since it's a single program, we can't have I/O in between. So the first part's result is stored in a variable, then the second part uses that variable as the input string.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a string. So in Fortran, the first part's output (the integer) must be converted to a string, which is then used as the input for the second part's processing. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (n and list a).\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the integer ans.\n3. Convert ans to a string s.\n4. Process the second program's logic using s as the input string.\n5. Output the final result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first part (n and the list of integers).\n- Compute the ans as per the first Java program.\n- Convert ans to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n- Process this string through the second Java's logic (the DP part).\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (ABC118_C):\n\nThe first program's main steps:\n\n- Read n. If n is 1, output the next integer and exit.\n- Else, read n integers into an array, sort them.\n- If all elements are zero, output 0 and exit.\n- Then loop applying 'func' until the list has one element. The 'func' function does some processing.\n\nThe 'func' function:\n\n- Takes a list, removes zeros, finds the minimum (initially 0, but then set to first non-zero?), then for each element, if min is non-zero, replace with mod by min. If any mod becomes 1, output 1 and exit. Then sort the list again.\n\nHmm, the 'func' function in Java is a bit tricky. Let me re-express it step by step.\n\nIn 'func':\n\nInitialize min as 0.\n\nLoop over the list elements:\n\n- If element is 0, remove it (so the list is modified in place).\n- Else, if min is not 0, set the element to a.get(i) mod min. If that mod is 1, exit with 1.\n- Else (min is 0), set min to the current element.\n\nWait, but the loop is over the list, and when elements are removed, the index i is decremented. So the loop is a bit tricky because removing elements during iteration can cause issues. The Java code uses a for loop with i starting at 0, and when an element is removed, i is decremented to recheck the next element (since the list has shifted).\n\nThis is a problem in Fortran, since arrays are static in size. So perhaps we need to handle this with a dynamic array or a list-like structure. Alternatively, we can process the list in a way that avoids modifying the array during iteration, perhaps by creating a new array each time.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps we can represent the list as an array with a counter for the current size, and process elements in a way that skips zeros and tracks the minimum.\n\nHmm, this is going to be a bit involved. Let's think of the steps for the first part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\n- n: integer input.\n- a: array of integers of size n (but may be modified).\n- The process involves sorting, removing zeros, and applying mod operations.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran for the first part:\n\nRead n from input. If n is 1, read the next integer and set ans to it, then proceed to the second part.\n\nElse, read the array a of size n. Sort it.\n\nCheck if all elements are zero (since after sorting, the last element is the largest; if it's zero, then all are zero). If so, ans is 0, proceed.\n\nElse, enter a loop where we process the array until its size is 1.\n\nThe processing function (func) steps:\n\nWe need to implement the 'func' function in Fortran. Let's think of the steps:\n\n1. Remove all zeros from the array. So create a new array without zeros.\n\n2. Find the minimum element in the new array (since after removing zeros, the first element is the min if sorted, but since we sort again at the end, maybe not).\n\nWait, in the Java code, after removing zeros, the code then proceeds to find the min. Let me retrace the Java 'func' steps:\n\nThe 'func' function:\n\n- The list 'a' is passed in. The code loops through each element:\n\nInitially, min is 0.\n\nFor each element in the list (starting from index 0):\n\n- If the element is 0, remove it (so the list is modified, and the loop index is adjusted).\n\n- Else:\n\n   if min is not 0, then set the element to a.get(i) mod min. If that mod is 1, output 1 and exit.\n\n   else (min is 0), set min to the current element.\n\nWait, but the loop is over the list, and after removing elements, the indices shift. So the code is effectively processing the list in order, but removing zeros and tracking the first non-zero as the initial min.\n\nWait, perhaps the min is the first non-zero element in the current list (after removing zeros). Because initially min is 0, so when the first non-zero element is found, min is set to that. Then, for subsequent elements, they are modded by min.\n\nWait, but the code loops through the list, and for each element (after removing zeros), the first non-zero (since zeros are removed) would set min to that element. Then, the next elements are modded by min. But since the list is sorted, perhaps the min is the first element?\n\nWait, in the Java code, after removing zeros, the list is then sorted again at the end of the function. Wait, no, the code after processing the elements, then sorts the list again before returning.\n\nWait, the code in 'func' after processing the elements (removing zeros and modding) then sorts the list again. So the order of elements is sorted again each time.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex. Let me try to re-express the 'func' function's logic step by step.\n\nThe 'func' function:\n\nInput: list A (ArrayList of integers).\n\nProcess:\n\n- Create a new list (a) as a copy of A.\n\n- Initialize min to 0.\n\n- Iterate over the list (indices from 0 to size-1):\n\n   For each element at position i:\n\n   if element is 0: remove it from the list, and decrement i (so the next iteration checks the same index again after removal).\n\n   else:\n\n      if min is not 0:\n\n          set the element to (element % min)\n\n          if the new value is 1, then output 1 and exit the entire program.\n\n      else:\n\n          set min to the current element (before modding?)\n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\nif (a.get(i) == 0) { remove and adjust i }\n\nelse {\n\n   if (min !=0) {\n\n      a.set(i, a.get(i) % min)\n\n      if (a.get(i) ==1) ... \n\n   } else {\n\n      min = a.get(i)\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo the min is set to the first non-zero element encountered in the iteration. Because when min is 0, the first non-zero element (since zeros are removed) will set min to that value. Then, subsequent elements (non-zero) are modded by this min.\n\nBut since the list is being processed in order, and after removing zeros, the first element is the first non-zero, so min is set to that. Then, the rest are modded by min.\n\nWait, but after modding, the elements can become smaller than min, but since we sort again at the end, perhaps the next iteration will have a new min.\n\nWait, but after processing all elements, the list is sorted again. So the next time 'func' is called, the list is sorted, so the first element is the new min.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the list is [6,4,2]. After first iteration:\n\nProcessing elements:\n\nFirst element is 6. Since min is 0, set min to 6.\n\nSecond element is 4: mod 6 \u2192 4 mod6 is 4. So remains 4.\n\nThird element is 2 mod6 \u2192 2.\n\nThen, after processing all elements, the list is [6,4,2], then sorted becomes [2,4,6].\n\nNext iteration of the loop (since the list has 3 elements):\n\nNow, the list is [2,4,6].\n\nProcessing again:\n\nmin starts at 0.\n\nFirst element is 2 \u2192 set min to 2.\n\nSecond element 4 mod2 \u2192 0. So becomes 0.\n\nThird element 6 mod2 \u2192 0.\n\nNow, after processing, the list is [2,0,0]. Then, the zeros are removed (since in the next loop, when processing, the zeros are removed first).\n\nWait, but in the next step, the code removes zeros first. So after modding, the elements become 2,0,0. Then, in the next iteration of the 'func' function, the zeros are removed, so the list becomes [2]. Then, the next loop in the main function will break, and ans is 2.\n\nWait, but in the first step, after modding, the elements are 2,4 mod2=0, 6 mod2=0. So the list after modding is [2,0,0]. Then, in the next iteration of the 'func' function, the code removes the zeros, so the list becomes [2], which is size 1, so the loop ends.\n\nHmm, okay. So the process is:\n\nEach time, the function removes zeros, then for the remaining elements, the first element is the min (since sorted?), then mod all elements by that min, then sort again.\n\nWait, but the code in 'func' does not sort until after processing. Wait, the code after processing the elements (modding and removing zeros) then sorts the list again before returning.\n\nWait, the code in 'func' ends with:\n\nCollections.sort(a);\n\nreturn a;\n\nSo after processing, the list is sorted again. So the next iteration of the loop in the main function will have a sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nEach time, the list is sorted, then the function processes it by removing zeros, then for the remaining elements, the first element (the min) is used to mod the others, then the list is sorted again.\n\nWait, but the modding is done in the order of the current list (before sorting). Hmm, perhaps the order of processing is important.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that after each 'func' call, the list is sorted, so the next iteration's processing can use the first element as the current min.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, for the first part (ABC118_C):\n\nWe need to read n and the list of integers. Then process them as per the algorithm.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are fixed size, but we can use dynamic arrays with allocatable arrays. Let's see.\n\nFirst, read n. If n is 1, read the number and set ans, then proceed.\n\nElse, read the array a of size n. Sort it.\n\nCheck if the last element (after sorting) is 0 \u2192 if yes, ans is 0.\n\nElse, loop until the array has size 1:\n\n   Call the function equivalent to 'func' which processes the array, returns the new array.\n\nThe function 'func' in Fortran would need to:\n\n- Remove zeros from the array.\n\n- Find the minimum (the first element after removing zeros, since the array is sorted? Wait, no, because after removing zeros, the array is not yet sorted. Wait, in the Java code, the function first processes the elements (removing zeros and modding), then sorts again. So the steps are:\n\nInside 'func':\n\n1. Remove all zeros from the array. (This is done during the loop in Java, but in Fortran, perhaps we can create a new array without zeros.)\n\n2. Then, find the minimum (the first element after removing zeros, since the array is not yet sorted here? Wait, no, the array is not sorted yet. Wait, in the Java code, the initial array is passed in, which may not be sorted. Wait, but in the main loop, after each 'func' call, the array is sorted again. So the next iteration's array is sorted.\n\nWait, the main loop in the first Java program is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   if (a.size() ==1) break;\n\n   a = func(a);\n\n}\n\nSo after each 'func' call, the array is the return value of 'func', which includes the sort at the end. So the array is always sorted before entering the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, when entering 'func', the array is already sorted. So in the 'func' processing:\n\nThe array is sorted, so the first non-zero element is the minimum (since zeros are removed first).\n\nWait, let's re-express the 'func' steps when the array is sorted:\n\nThe array is sorted, so all zeros are at the beginning (if any). Wait, no, if the array is sorted, zeros would be first, then the rest in increasing order.\n\nWait, the array is sorted in ascending order. So when we process the array in 'func', the first step is to remove zeros. So the remaining elements are all non-zero and in sorted order (since the original array was sorted, and we removed the leading zeros).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the 'func' function's processing loop removes zeros as it goes through the list. So after removing zeros, the remaining elements are in the same order as before, but without zeros. But then, after processing, the list is sorted again.\n\nHmm, perhaps in the Fortran code, the steps can be:\n\nInside 'func':\n\n- Remove zeros from the array (create a new array without zeros).\n\n- The remaining elements are in the same order (but sorted, since the original array was sorted).\n\nWait, but the original array was sorted, so after removing zeros, the remaining elements are still in sorted order.\n\nThen, the first element is the minimum (since sorted).\n\nThen, for each element in the array (excluding zeros, which are already removed):\n\n   mod the element by the minimum (the first element).\n\n   if any mod result is 1, then output 1 and exit.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the mod is done in the loop as we process each element. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code's 'func' function:\n\nAfter removing zeros, the code loops through the elements again (since the list is modified, but the loop is over the original indices? Wait, no, the loop is over the list's elements, but when elements are removed, the indices shift. So the code effectively processes each element once, skipping zeros.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Fortran code, after removing zeros, the array is now a list of non-zero elements in sorted order. The first element is the minimum.\n\nThen, for each element in the array (starting from the second element?), we mod by the first element (min).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first element (the first non-zero) is the min, and the code processes each element in the list (after removing zeros) in order, and for each element (starting from the first?), the first element sets the min, then the rest are modded by min.\n\nWait, in the Java code's loop:\n\nInitially, min is 0.\n\nLoop over each element in the list (after removing zeros? Or not yet?):\n\nWait, the code in 'func' first removes zeros during the loop. So the loop is over the original list, but when a zero is found, it's removed, and the loop index is adjusted. So after processing, the list has no zeros.\n\nThen, the code proceeds to process the elements (non-zero) in the list, but the loop is over the original indices, but after removals, the list is shorter.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Java code, after removing zeros, the remaining elements are in the list, and the loop continues processing them. The min is set to the first non-zero element (since when min is 0, the first non-zero element sets min to that value). Then, the subsequent elements are modded by min.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after removing zeros, the array is in sorted order (since the original array was sorted before entering 'func'), so the first element is the min.\n\nThen, for each element in the array (starting from the first?), the first element is min. Then, for each element after that, mod by min. If any mod result is 1, then output 1 and exit.\n\nWait, but the first element is min, so mod by itself is 0. So the first element becomes 0? Wait, no, because mod(min, min) is 0, but the first element is min, so mod(min, min) is 0. But then, that element would become 0, which would be removed in the next iteration.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code in 'func' is designed so that after modding, any element that becomes 1 causes an immediate exit with 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when an element after mod becomes 1, it outputs 1 and exits. So in the Fortran code, whenever during the processing of elements, if any mod result is 1, we need to immediately return 1 as the answer and exit the entire program.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, during the processing of the array in 'func', we need to check each mod result. If any is 1, we can set a flag and break out, then return that value.\n\nBut since this is part of a loop in the main program, perhaps the entire process can be structured with early exits.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let me try to outline the steps in Fortran for the first part.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n ==1:\n\n   Read the number, set ans = that number.\n\nElse:\n\n   Read the array a of size n.\n\n   Sort the array.\n\n   Check if the last element (max) is 0 \u2192 if yes, ans is 0.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Enter a loop until the array size is 1:\n\n         Call the function 'func' which processes the array and returns the new array.\n\n         The function may also return a flag indicating if 1 was found (to exit early).\n\n      The final element is the ans.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the 'func' function can exit early if any mod result is 1. So in Fortran, the function must check for this and return a flag.\n\nAlternatively, the main loop can check after each step.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function 'func' in Fortran can return a status: 0 for continue, 1 for found 1, and the new array.\n\nSo in the main loop:\n\n   while (array size >1):\n\n      call func(a, new_a, status)\n\n      if status ==1:\n\n          ans =1\n\n          exit loop\n\n      a = new_a\n\n   if status was 1, then ans is 1, else the final element is ans.\n\nThis way, we can handle the early exit.\n\nNow, implementing the 'func' function in Fortran.\n\nFunction func(a, new_a, status):\n\nInput: array a (sorted, with no zeros? Or not?)\n\nWait, the input array is sorted, but may contain zeros (since the previous step may have zeros, but after processing, they are removed).\n\nWait, the input array to 'func' is the sorted array from the previous step.\n\nInside 'func':\n\n1. Remove all zeros from a to form a new array (call it temp).\n\n   So, count the non-zero elements, allocate temp array of that size, copy non-zero elements.\n\n2. If the temp array is empty \u2192 but since the main loop only calls 'func' when the array size is >1, but after removing zeros, if all were zeros, then the previous check (in main) would have set ans to 0. So this case shouldn't happen here.\n\n3. The first element of temp is the min (since sorted).\n\n4. Now, process each element in temp:\n\n   Initialize min_val = temp(1)\n\n   new_temp array is created.\n\n   status =0\n\n   do i=1, size(temp)\n\n      current = temp(i)\n\n      if (i ==1) then\n\n          ! first element is min_val, mod by itself is 0 \u2192 but we can leave it as min_val?\n\n          ! Wait, in the Java code, the first element (the min) is not modded because when processing it, min is 0 initially, so it sets min to current (min_val). Then, the next elements are modded by min_val.\n\n          ! So the first element remains as min_val, but when modded by itself, it would be 0. Wait, no, the first element is the first non-zero, so when processing it, min is 0, so it sets min to current (min_val). Then, the next elements are modded by min_val.\n\n          ! So the first element is not modded, but the rest are.\n\n          ! So in the Fortran code, the first element remains as min_val, and the rest are modded by min_val.\n\n          ! So for the first element (i=1), we leave it as is.\n\n          new_temp(i) = current\n\n      else:\n\n          mod_val = mod(current, min_val)\n\n          new_temp(i) = mod_val\n\n          if (mod_val ==1) then\n\n              status =1\n\n              exit loop\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (status ==1) then\n\n       return new_temp (or whatever, but the main loop will break)\n\n   else:\n\n       ! Now, remove zeros from new_temp (since mod could have produced zeros)\n\n       ! Wait, the mod_val can be zero, which would be removed in the next iteration.\n\n       ! So create a new array without zeros.\n\n       count_nonzero = count(new_temp /=0)\n\n       allocate(new_a(count_nonzero))\n\n       k=1\n\n       do i=1, size(new_temp)\n\n           if (new_temp(i) /=0) then\n\n               new_a(k) = new_temp(i)\n\n               k =k+1\n\n           end if\n\n       end do\n\n       ! Then sort new_a\n\n       call sort(new_a)\n\n   end if\n\n   return new_a and status.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after modding, the elements are stored in the list, then zeros are removed (but in the loop, they were already removed before modding? Or not?)\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the steps precisely.\n\nWait, in the Java code's 'func' function:\n\nThe loop over the list (a) does two things: removes zeros and processes the elements (modding).\n\nWait, the code in 'func' is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.get(i) == 0) {\n\n        a.remove(i);\n\n        i--;\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (min != 0) {\n\n            a.set(i, a.get(i) % min);\n\n            if (a.get(i) == 1) {\n\n                System.out.println(1);\n\n                System.exit(0);\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            min = a.get(i);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the loop first removes zeros (by removing them from the list and adjusting the index). Then, for non-zero elements, processes them.\n\nThe processing for non-zero elements:\n\n- If min is not zero (i.e., not the first non-zero element), then mod the element by min. If the result is 1, exit.\n\n- Else (min is zero), set min to the current element (so the first non-zero element sets min).\n\nSo the first non-zero element in the list (after removing zeros) sets min to its value. The rest are modded by min.\n\nTherefore, the first element (after removing zeros) is the min, and the rest are modded by it.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after removing zeros (step 1), the first element is min_val.\n\nThen, for each element in the temp array (non-zero elements):\n\n- The first element remains as min_val.\n\n- The others are modded by min_val.\n\n- If any mod result is 1, return status 1.\n\n- Then, after modding, we need to remove any zeros (since mod can produce zero).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after modding, the elements are in the list, and then the list is sorted again.\n\nWait, after processing all elements (modding and checking for 1), the code then sorts the list again before returning.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter modding and checking for 1, we need to:\n\n- Remove zeros from the modded array (since mod can produce zero).\n\n- Sort the resulting array.\n\nThus, the steps in 'func' are:\n\n1. Remove zeros from the input array (a) \u2192 temp array.\n\n2. If temp is empty \u2192 but shouldn't happen here.\n\n3. min_val = temp(1).\n\n4. Create new_temp array of same size as temp.\n\n5. new_temp(1) = temp(1).\n\n6. For i from 2 to size(temp):\n\n   mod_val = mod(temp(i), min_val)\n\n   new_temp(i) = mod_val\n\n   if mod_val ==1 \u2192 set status=1 and break.\n\n7.

Sort new_a.\n\ncall sort(new_a)\n\ndeallocate(temp2)\n\nend subroutine func\n\nWait, but the sorting function needs to be implemented. Fortran has a built-in sort? Or need to write a quicksort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function ifort's sort, but for portability, better to write a simple bubble sort or use the 'sort' intrinsic.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge' function with a key.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic if available.\n\nAssuming that we can use the intrinsic sort:\n\nIn the main program, after reading a, call sort(a).\n\nSimilarly, in the subroutine, after creating new_a, call sort(new_a).\n\nIn Fortran, the sort can be done with:\n\ncall merge_sort(new_a) \u2192 but need to define a sorting routine.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in function:\n\ncall sort(new_a)\n\nBut I think in standard Fortran, you have to use the 'sort' from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module or write your own.\n\nHmm, perhaps for simplicity, I'll assume that a sort subroutine is available. Let's write a simple bubble sort for the arrays.\n\nAdding a sort subroutine:\n\nsubroutine sort(arr)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\ninteger :: i, j, temp, n\n\nn = size(arr)\n\ndo i=1, n-1\n\n    do j=i+1, n\n\n        if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n\n            temp = arr(i)\n\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n\n            arr(j) = temp\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nend subroutine sort\n\nThis is a simple bubble sort, which is O(n\u00b2), but for the problem's constraints (n up to maybe 1e5?), but the original Java code uses ArrayList and Collections.sort which is O(n log n). However, for the problem's purposes, perhaps it's acceptable, or maybe the test cases are small.\n\nAlternatively, use a better sort, but for brevity, bubble sort is okay here.\n\nNow, moving to the second part of the problem (ABC129_E):\n\nThe second Java program reads a string, processes it with DP, and outputs the result mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe DP is a 2D array of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of the string.\n\nThe transitions are:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] =1.\n\nThen for each character in the string (index i from 0 to n-1):\n\nDepending on the current character (0 or 1), update the dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1].\n\nThe transitions are a bit complex. Let me re-express the Java code's logic.\n\nThe Java code's main loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\n    }\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + dp[i][1] *2) % M\n\n    } else {\n\n        dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + dp[i][0] *2) % M\n\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] += dp[i][1] *2) % M\n\n    }\n\n    // Also, mod after each addition.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code has two parts in the loop:\n\nFirst part (before the second if):\n\nif s[i] is '0', set dp[i+1][0] and [1] to current's 0 and 1.\n\nElse, set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M.\n\nThen, the second part (the second if):\n\nif s[i] is '0', add 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1].\n\nElse, add 2*dp[i][0] to dp[i+1][0], and 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1].\n\nWait, the code's second part:\n\nThe first block (if s[i] is '0'):\n\nThen, the second if (s[i] == '0'):\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M.\n\nElse (s[i] is '1'):\n\n   dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] *2) mod M.\n\n   dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nThe first part of the loop (before the second if):\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\n}\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + (dp[i][1] *2) ) % M\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + (dp[i][0] *2) ) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i+1][1] + (dp[i][1] *2) ) % M\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the first part, when s[i] is '0', the first block sets dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the current values. Then, in the second part, since s[i] is '0', we add 2*dp[i][1] to dp[i+1][1].\n\nSo the first part's initial assignments are overwritten in the second part?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose s[i] is '0'.\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\ndp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nSecond part (since s[i] is '0'):\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2) mod M \u2192 so the new value is dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1].\n\nWait, but the code uses +=, so it's adding to the existing value.\n\nWait, the code in the second part:\n\nIn the first part, the first block sets dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1].\n\nThen, in the second part, when s[i] is '0', the code adds (dp[i][1] *2) to dp[i+1][1], so the total becomes dp[i][1] + 2*dp[i][1] = 3*dp[i][1].\n\nBut the code uses mod M each time.\n\nHmm, this is the logic.\n\nThe DP transitions are a bit involved. Let me re-express them step by step.\n\nThe DP has two states: 0 and 1.\n\nThe meaning of the states is probably:\n\ndp[i][0]: number of ways to form a valid string up to the i-th character, where the current string is valid and ends with a certain condition (maybe the last character is 0 or something).\n\nAlternatively, the states might represent whether the current string is \"tight\" or not, but the exact meaning isn't crucial for coding.\n\nThe key is to translate the transitions correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, the second part's code will need to:\n\n- Take the string s (which is the string representation of the first part's ans).\n\n- Initialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1)x2, where n is the length of s.\n\n- Process each character in s, updating the dp array.\n\n- Finally, output (dp(n,0) + dp(n,1)) mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, in the combined Fortran program, the first part's ans is an integer, which is converted to a string s. The second part processes this s.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nAfter computing ans in the first part, we need to convert it to a string s.\n\nIn Fortran, this can be done with a write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\nThen, trim the trailing spaces (since the write may pad with spaces).\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nNow, the length of s is len_trim(s).\n\nThen, process the string s through the DP.\n\nThe DP array can be a 2D array of integers, but since the numbers can be up to 1e9+7, we need to use integers of sufficient size. In Fortran, integers are typically 4 bytes (32-bit), but for mod 1e9+7, we need 64-bit integers. So we'll use integer(8) or similar.\n\nThus, the code for the second part:\n\n! After computing ans and converting to s:\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n\ninteger :: m = 1000000007\n\ninteger :: n_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n! ...

Then, in the second part (same c is '0'), we add 2*dp(i,1) to dp(i+1,1).\n\nSo the first part's assignment is to dp(i+1,1) = dp(i,1), then adding 2*dp(i,1) gives 3*dp(i,1).\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe full Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, ans, status, i, n_s, m = 1000000007\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), temp(:), dp(:,:), new_a(:)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\n!

This could be a problem. To avoid this, perhaps we should use a dynamic array or initialize temp1 properly.\n\nAlternatively, in the first loop:\n\nallocate(temp1(size(a)))\n\nthen, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to zero by default? No, variables are not initialized. So we need to initialize temp1 to zero, but better to use a loop that only stores non-zero elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a temporary array of the same size as a, but only fill up to count_nonzero.\n\nThe code as written should work because temp1 is declared with size(a), but the loop only writes to the first count_nonzero elements. The rest are uninitialized, but since we only use up to count_nonzero, it's okay.\n\nHowever, in the code:\n\ntemp1 is declared as size(a), but when count_nonzero is less than size(a), the remaining elements are not set. But since we only use the first count_nonzero elements, it's okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are not automatically initialized, so temp1 might have garbage values beyond count_nonzero. However, since we only use the first count_nonzero elements, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe, we can initialize temp1 to zero:\n\ntemp1 = 0\n\nBut in the code above, it's not done. But since the loop overwrites the first count_nonzero elements, it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the 'func' subroutine, after processing, the new_a is allocated and sorted. The 'sort' subroutine is called on new_a, which is correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, input 5 \u2192 ans is 5 \u2192 s is \"5\", then the second part processes \"5\".\n\nThe second part's DP:\n\nn_s =1.\n\nInitial dp(0,0)=1.\n\ni=0 (first character '5' is '1'):\n\nFirst part (c is '5' \u2192 '1'):\n\ndp(1,1) = mod(1 +0, m) \u2192 1.\n\nSecond part (c is '1'):\n\ndp(1,0) += 2*1 \u2192 2.\n\ndp(1,1) += 2*0 \u2192 1 + 2*0 \u2192 1? Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the second part for '1' case:\n\ndp(i+1,0) = dp(1,0) (which was set to 0 in first part?) Wait, let me re-calculate.\n\nWait, first part for c='1' (since '5' is '5' which is '1' in the string? Wait, the string is \"5\", so the character is '5', which is not '0' or '1'? Wait, the second Java program expects a string of '0's and '1's?\n\nWait, this is a problem. The second Java program's input is a string of '0's and '1's. But the first program's output is an integer, which when converted to a string could have other characters (like '5', '2', etc.), which would cause the second part to process invalid characters.\n\nWait, this is a critical issue. The first program's output is an integer, which when converted to a string may contain digits other than '0' or '1', which the second program's logic expects.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the first program's output is the input to the second program. The second program reads a string via nextLine(), which would read the entire line. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, the second program would read \"123\" as the input string. The second program's code processes each character as '0' or '1', but in this case, '2' would be treated as '1' (since it's not '0').\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe code checks if the character is '0' or not. So any character that is not '0' is treated as '1' in the transitions.\n\nThus, the second program's code works for any string, treating non-'0' characters as '1's.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the string s can have any characters, and the code will process them as '0' or '1' accordingly.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 0 \u2192 s is \"0\", then the second part processes \"0\".\n\nThe second part's DP:\n\nn_s=1.\n\nInitial dp(0,0)=1.\n\ni=0 (c is '0'):\n\nFirst part:\n\ndp(1,0)=1, dp(1,1)=0.\n\nSecond part (c is '0'):\n\ndp(1,1) += 2*0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nThus, dp(1,0)=1, dp(1,1)=0 \u2192 total 1.\n\nSo output is 1 mod 1e9+7 \u2192 1.\n\nWait, but according to the second Java program's code:\n\nThe first character is '0', so first part sets dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] =1, dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] =0.\n\nThen, since c is '0', the second part adds 2*dp[0][1] (which is 0) to dp[1][1], so remains 0.\n\nThus, total is 1+0 =1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 1 \u2192 s is \"1\".\n\nSecond part processes '1':\n\ni=0 (c is '1'):\n\nFirst part sets dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + dp[0][1] =1.\n\nSecond part adds 2*dp[0][0] to dp[1][0] (which was 0 initially?), wait:\n\nWait, first part for '1' sets dp[1][1] =1.\n\nThen, in the second part (since c is '1'):\n\ndp[1][0] += 2*1 \u2192 2.\n\ndp[1][1] += 2*0 \u2192 1.\n\nThus, dp[1][0] =2, dp[1][1] =1 \u2192 total 3 mod 1e9+7 \u21923.\n\nThus, the output is 3.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The 'func' subroutine's temp arrays may have undefined values beyond count_nonzero, but since we only use up to count_nonzero, it's okay.\n\n- The sorting in 'func' must be done correctly.\n\n- The DP in the second part must handle all characters correctly.\n\n- The integer size in the DP must be sufficient. Using integer(8) should handle mod 1e9+7.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program should be as written above."
