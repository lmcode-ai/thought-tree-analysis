But if the total is not enough, then you can add some problems from the days not in the subset. But you can only add up to p[i]-1 problems from those days (since adding all would require including the day in the subset, which it isn't). So the code tries to add as many as possible (up to p[i]-1) from the non-selected days, starting from the highest day (to maximize points per problem, so that you can reach the goal with fewer problems). So in the code, for each non-selected day, you can add up to p[i]-1 problems (since adding all would require including the day in the subset, which it isn't).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a number. The second takes that number as input and produces the final output. So the Fortran program should read the input for the first part, process both steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result from the second part.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does.\n\nThe first Java program (atcoder_ABC104_C) is solving a problem where given D days, each with a number of problems p[i], a bonus c[i], and a goal G, it finds the minimum number of problems needed to reach at least G points. The approach uses bitmasking to try all subsets of days, calculating the score for each subset. If the subset's score is below G, it tries adding the maximum possible problems from the remaining days to reach the goal. The minimum number of problems across all valid subsets is the answer.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_96_B) takes a number N, and finds the smallest number composed only of 4's and 7's (with equal number of each) that is >= N. It starts checking from 2 (binary 10) upwards, converts the binary (without leading 1) to a string, replaces 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, checks if the count of 0 and 1 are equal, and then parses the string to a number. The first such number >= N is the answer.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read the input for the first problem, process it to get the minimum number (min), then use that min as the input to the second problem's logic, and output the result of the second problem.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the Fortran code so that the first part's input is read, then the first problem's logic is computed, then the second problem's logic is applied to the result, and finally the output is printed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read input for the first problem (D, G, then p and c arrays).\n2. Compute the minimum number of problems (min) using the first problem's algorithm.\n3. Use this min as the input number for the second problem's algorithm.\n4. Compute the answer for the second problem using that number.\n5. Output the second problem's result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program):\n\nVariables in Java:\n\n- D is an integer (input)\n- G is a long (input)\n- p and c are arrays of integers of size D (input)\n- The rest are loop variables and temporary storage.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. Need to adjust indices accordingly. For example, in Java, the loop runs from 0 to D-1, but in Fortran, if we use 1-based, we can loop from 1 to D. So when translating, the indices will shift.\n\nThe first part's algorithm:\n\nThe outer loop is over all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^D -1). For each bitmask, check which days are included (bits set). For each included day, add the points (100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]) and count the problems. Then, if the total score is less than G, try adding the remaining problems from the non-included days, starting from the last day. The inner loop for the remaining days.\n\nWait, in the Java code, when the score is less than G, it enters a loop to try adding problems from the non-selected days. The code loops from D-1 down to 0. For each day not in the bitmask, it adds as many problems as possible except the last one (since p[i]-1 times). Wait, the code does:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < p[i] - 1; j++) {\n    score += 100*(i+1);\n    solve_num++;\n    if (score >= G) break;\n}\n\nWait, that's adding p[i]-1 problems from that day. Because the problem says that for each problem in the day, you get 100*(i+1) points. But the first p[i] problems give the bonus. Wait, maybe the problem's details are a bit different, but the code's logic is as written.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must replicate this logic.\n\nNow, in Fortran, loops are a bit different. Also, bitmasking can be done with integers. Since D can be up to, say, 10 (since 2^10 is manageable), but the problem's constraints for the first problem (ABC104 C) probably have D up to 8 or 9? Let me check the problem's constraints. Wait, the original problem (ABC104 C) has D up to 8, since the problem says \"D is an integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive)\". So the bitmask loop will be manageable in Fortran with integers (since 2^8 is 256).\n\nSo in Fortran, the bitmask can be an integer variable. For each bit in the bitmask, check if the bit is set.\n\nNow, translating the first part's code into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read D, G, then p and c arrays. Since in Java, p and c are 0-based, in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays. So in Fortran, declare p(1:D) and c(1:D).\n\nThe outer loop for the bitmask:\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\nBut in Fortran, exponentiation is **. However, for D up to 8, 2**8 is 256, so manageable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be up to 2^31 or so, so for D=8, 2^8 is 256, so no problem.\n\nNow, for each bit, compute the score and solve_num.\n\nInitialize score and solve_num to 0.\n\nThen loop over each day (i from 1 to D):\n\nif the bit has the i-th bit set (since in Java, the bits are 0-based, but in Fortran, if we use 1-based, then the first bit is 1, etc. Wait, need to be careful here.\n\nWait, in Java, the bitmask is for D bits, each bit corresponds to day 0 to D-1. In Fortran, if we use 1-based days (1 to D), then the bitmask's bits correspond to days 1 to D. So for day i (1-based), the bit is (bit and (1 << (i-1))) !=0 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to keep the days 0-based in Fortran. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's use 0-based indices for the days. So declare p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1). Then the loops can be from 0 to D-1, which matches the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:D-1) :: p, c\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with size, so we need to have D as a variable. Hmm, but in Fortran, arrays can be allocated dynamically. So perhaps:\n\nRead D first, then allocate p and c arrays of size D.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So perhaps:\n\nRead D, then allocate p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1).\n\nBut in Fortran 90, you can do that.\n\nSo the steps for the first part:\n\nRead D, G.\n\nThen read D lines, each with p(i) and c(i) for i from 0 to D-1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (i=0; i < D; i++), so in Fortran, the same.\n\nNow, the main loop over all bits:\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\nThen, for each bit, compute the score and solve_num.\n\nInitialize score = 0, solve_num =0.\n\nThen loop over each day (i from 0 to D-1):\n\nif (bit and (1 << i)) then (since in Java, the bitmask is 1 << i for day i).\n\nWait, in Fortran, shifting is done with iShft function. So 1 shifted left by i bits is iShft(1, i). But in Fortran, integers can be manipulated with bitwise operations. Alternatively, use bit_and.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the bitwise AND is done with the IAND function. So:\n\nif (iand(bit, ishft(1, i)) /= 0) then\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each day i (0-based), check if the bit is set. If so, add to the score and solve_num.\n\nThen, after processing all days, check if the total score is >= G. If not, then enter the loop to try adding more problems from the non-selected days.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nif (score < G) {\n\n    loop: for (i from D-1 downto 0) {\n\n        if (bit's i-th bit is not set) {\n\n            for (j from 0 to p[i]-2) {\n\n                add 100*(i+1) to score, increment solve_num.\n\n                if score >= G, break loop.\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the inner loop adds p[i]-1 problems from that day. Because the loop runs p[i]-1 times. Each iteration adds one problem (so total p[i]-1 added). Because the problem's first p[i] problems give the bonus, but perhaps the code is trying to add as many as possible except the last one? Or maybe the problem's rules are such that the first p[i] problems give 100*(i+1) each plus the bonus, but when adding more, you can take some?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's details are such that for each day, you can choose to do all the problems (including the bonus) or not. But in the code, when the subset is chosen (bitmask), you take all the problems in that day (so p[i] problems, giving 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]). But if the total is not enough, then you can add some problems from the days not in the subset. But you can only add up to p[i]-1 problems from those days (since adding all would require including the day in the subset, which it isn't). So the code tries to add as many as possible (up to p[i]-1) from the non-selected days, starting from the highest day (to maximize points per problem, so that you can reach the goal with fewer problems).\n\nSo in the code, for each non-selected day, you can add up to p[i]-1 problems (since adding all would require including the day in the subset, which it isn't). So the loop for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (since p[i]-1 iterations) adds p[i]-1 problems. Each iteration adds one problem (so 100*(i+1) points and +1 to solve_num).\n\nWait, the loop is for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (since j < p[i]-1). So the number of added problems is p[i]-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be similar.\n\nNow, in the Java code, after adding those, if the score reaches G, it breaks out of the loop (using the labeled break).\n\nIn Fortran, loops can be labeled, so we can do something like:\n\nouter: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n    if (bit not set for i) then\n\n        do j = 1 to p(i)-1 (since 0 to p[i]-2 is p[i]-1 times)\n\n            add 100*(i+1) to score, solve_num +=1\n\n            if score >= G then exit outer\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\nend do outer\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variables are a bit different. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nif (score < G) then\n\n    do i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n        if (iand(bit, ishft(1, i)) == 0) then\n\n            do j = 1, p(i)-1\n\n                score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n                solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n                if (score >= G) then\n\n                    exit\n\n                end if\n\n            end do\n\n            if (score >= G) then\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the inner loop is for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (so p[i]-1 times). Each iteration adds one problem. So in Fortran, the loop can be from 1 to p(i)-1 (since p(i) is the number of problems in that day). So the same count.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the inner loop is for (int j = 0; j < p[i] -1; j++), so p[i]-1 iterations. So in Fortran, the loop can be do j=1, p(i)-1, which is the same number of steps.\n\nBut in the Java code, after each addition, it checks if the score is >= G and breaks the loop (the inner loop and the outer loop). The Java code uses a labeled break to exit the outer loop (the for loop over i). So in Fortran, perhaps after adding each problem, if the score is sufficient, we can exit both loops. To do that, we can use a labeled loop for the outer loop (the i loop), and when the condition is met, exit the outer loop.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (score < G) then\n\n    outer: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n        if (iand(bit, ishft(1, i)) == 0) then\n\n            do j = 1, p(i)-1\n\n                score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n                solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n                if (score >= G) then\n\n                    exit outer\n\n                end if\n\n            end do\n\n        end if\n\n    end do outer\n\nend if\n\nWait, but the outer loop is labeled 'outer', so exiting that loop will break out of the i loop. That should replicate the Java's behavior.\n\nOnce that's done, check if the score is >= G, then update the min.\n\nNow, the min is initialized to a large value (INF = 100000). In Fortran, we can set INF as a parameter, say 100000.\n\nSo the code outline for the first part is:\n\nRead D, G.\n\nRead p and c arrays (0-based).\n\nInitialize min to INF.\n\nLoop over all bits from 0 to 2^D -1:\n\n    compute score and solve_num.\n\n    if score < G, then try adding the extra problems as above.\n\n    if score >= G, then check if solve_num is less than current min.\n\n    update min accordingly.\n\nAfter all bits, the min is the answer for the first part.\n\nNow, the second part's code takes the min (from first part) as input, and processes it.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nIt reads a number (the input is the min from first part), then finds the smallest number made of 4 and 7 with equal counts, >= the input.\n\nThe algorithm starts with mask=2 (binary 10), then converts the binary (without leading 1) to a string, counts zeros and ones (excluding leading 1?), then checks if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s. If so, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with 7, parse to long, and check if it's >= the input. The first such value is the answer.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code for the second part:\n\nThe code:\n\nlong number = in.nextLong(); // this is the input (the min from first part)\n\nlong ans = -1, value =0;\n\nint mask =2;\n\nwhile (value < number) {\n\n    String s = Integer.toBinaryString(mask++).substring(1);\n\n    int zeros =0;\n\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) if (c == '0') zeros++;\n\n    if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue; // so zeros must equal the number of 1s?\n\n    // because s.length() - zeros is the number of 1s. So zeros must equal (number of 1s) ?\n\n    So the condition is zeros == (s.length() - zeros) ?\n\n    Wait, the condition is if (zeros != s.length() - zeros) continue; meaning that only proceed if they are equal.\n\n    So the binary string (without leading 1) must have equal number of 0s and 1s.\n\n    Then, replace 0 with 4, 1 with7, parse to value.\n\n    So the mask starts at 2 (binary 10), so the substring(1) is \"0\".\n\n    Then, the first mask is 2 (binary 10 \u2192 substring(1) is \"0\" \u2192 length 1. zeros is 1, so 1 vs 0 (since 1-1=0?), so 1 !=0 \u2192 skip.\n\n    Next mask is 3 (binary 11 \u2192 substring(1) is \"1\" \u2192 zeros=0, length 1 \u2192 0 vs 1 \u2192 no.\n\n    mask=4 \u2192 binary 100 \u2192 substring(1) is \"00\" \u2192 zeros=2, length 2 \u2192 2 == 0 \u2192 no? Wait 2 vs 0? Wait 2 (zeros) vs (2-2)=0? So 2 !=0 \u2192 no.\n\n    mask=5 \u2192 binary 101 \u2192 substring(1) is \"01\" \u2192 zeros=1, length 2 \u2192 1 ==1 \u2192 yes.\n\n    So s becomes \"01\" \u2192 replaced to \"47\" \u2192 value 47. If the input number is, say, 40, then 47 is the answer.\n\n    So the code is generating binary numbers starting from 2 (mask=2), taking their binary string without the leading 1, then checking if the remaining bits have equal 0 and 1. If so, replace 0\u21924, 1\u21927, and check if the number is >= input.\n\n    The first such value is the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nTake the min from first part as the input number.\n\nInitialize mask starting at 2, then increment each time.\n\nFor each mask:\n\n- Convert mask to binary string, then take substring after the first character (since mask starts at 2, which is 10 in binary, so the first character is '1', so substring from index 1 (Fortran is 1-based) would be the rest.\n\nWait, in Java, substring(1) gives from index 1 (second character) onward. So in Fortran, the binary string of mask (without leading '1') is needed.\n\nSo steps for each mask:\n\n1. Convert mask to binary string, without leading '1'.\n\n2. Check if the number of 0s equals the number of 1s in this substring.\n\n3. If yes, replace 0 with '4', 1 with '7', then parse to a number.\n\n4. If this number is >= input number, then it's a candidate. The first such is the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to do this?\n\nFirst, converting an integer to a binary string. In Fortran, we can use the intrinsic function to get the binary representation, but perhaps it's easier to write a helper function or use a loop.\n\nAlternatively, for a given mask, we can compute its binary digits, then process them.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of mask as an integer. Let's process its binary digits after the leading 1.\n\nFirst, find the binary string of mask, then take substring after first character.\n\nBut in Fortran, to get the binary string, perhaps:\n\nWe can write a loop to get each bit of mask, starting from the least significant bit, but need to exclude the leading 1.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nFor a given mask:\n\n- Convert mask to a binary string (without leading zeros).\n\n- Remove the first character (the leading '1').\n\n- The remaining string is s.\n\n- Count the number of '0's and '1's in s.\n\n- If counts are equal, proceed.\n\n- Else, skip.\n\nThen, replace 0 with 4 and 1 with7, then convert to a number.\n\nThe first such number >= input is the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nWe can loop mask from 2 upwards.\n\nFor each mask:\n\nbinary_str = binary representation of mask (as a string without leading zeros).\n\ns = binary_str(2: len_trim(binary_str))\n\ncount_zeros = number of '0's in s.\n\ncount_ones = number of '1's in s.\n\nif count_zeros /= count_ones, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nreplace each '0' with '4', '1' with '7' \u2192 new_str.\n\nconvert new_str to a number (value).\n\nif value >= input_number, then return it as the answer.\n\nSo the first such value is the answer.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, converting an integer to a binary string.\n\nFunction to convert integer to binary string:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n    CHARACTER(LEN=32) :: bin_str\n    INTEGER :: i, pos\n    bin_str = ''\n    DO i = 0, 31\n        IF (BTEST(n, i)) THEN\n            bin_str = '1' // bin_str\n        ELSE\n            bin_str = '0' // bin_str\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    ! Remove leading zeros\n    pos = 1\n    DO WHILE (pos <= LEN(bin_str) .AND. bin_str(pos:pos) == '0')\n        pos = pos +1\n    END DO\n    IF (pos > LEN(bin_str)) THEN\n        bin_str = '0'\n    ELSE\n        bin_str = bin_str(pos:)\n    END IF\nEND FUNCTION int_to_bin\n\nWait, but this might have issues. Alternatively, perhaps use a loop to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use bit operations.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better approach:\n\nTo get the binary string of mask (without leading zeros):\n\nbinary_str = ''\n\ndo while (mask >0)\n\n    remainder = mod(mask,2)\n\n    binary_str = char(ichar('0') + remainder) // binary_str\n\n    mask = mask /2\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this would give the binary digits in reverse order. Wait, no, because each step appends to the left. Let me see:\n\nmask = 2 \u2192 binary is 10.\n\nLoop:\n\nmask =2 \u2192 remainder 0 \u2192 binary_str becomes '0'\n\nmask =1 \u2192 remainder 1 \u2192 binary_str becomes '1'// '0' \u2192 '10'\n\nmask becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo the string is '10', which is correct.\n\nSo this loop would give the correct binary string without leading zeros.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n    CHARACTER(LEN=32) :: bin_str\n    INTEGER :: temp, i\n    bin_str = ''\n    temp = n\n    IF (temp ==0) THEN\n        bin_str = '0'\n        RETURN\n    END IF\n    DO\n        bin_str = CHAR(ICHAR('0') + MOD(temp,2)) // bin_str\n        temp = temp /2\n        IF (temp ==0) EXIT\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION int_to_bin\n\nWait, but in this case, for mask=2, the function returns '10', which is correct.\n\nSo using this function, for each mask:\n\nbinary_str = int_to_bin(mask)\n\ns = binary_str(2: len_trim(binary_str))\n\nWait, because we need to remove the first character (the leading '1').\n\nWait, the binary_str for mask=2 is '10', so s would be '0'.\n\nFor mask=3 (binary '11'), s is '1'.\n\nmask=5 (binary '101') \u2192 s is '01'.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, count the number of 0s and 1s in s.\n\ncount_zeros = 0\n\ncount_ones =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n        count_zeros = count_zeros +1\n\n    else\n\n        count_ones = count_ones +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (count_zeros /= count_ones) cycle\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, create the new string by replacing 0\u21924, 1\u21927.\n\nnew_str = ''\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == '0') then\n\n        new_str = new_str // '4'\n\n    else\n\n        new_str = new_str // '7'\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert new_str to a number (value).\n\nvalue = 0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(new_str)\n\n    value = value *10 + ichar(new_str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting a string to a number can be done with internal read:\n\nread(new_str, '(BN)') value\n\nBut need to ensure that the string is numeric.\n\nAlternatively, the loop is straightforward.\n\nOnce value is computed, check if it is >= input_number (the min from first part). The first such value is the answer.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read input for first problem (D, G, p array, c array).\n\n2. Compute the min (first problem's answer).\n\n3. Use that min as the input for the second problem's algorithm.\n\n4. Compute the second problem's answer.\n\n5. Output that answer.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nThe first part's variables:\n\nD: integer\n\nG: integer*8 (since in Java it's a long, which is 64 bits. In Fortran, use integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18)).\n\np and c arrays: integer arrays of size D (0-based).\n\nThe second part's variables:\n\ninput_number: integer*8 (the min from first part).\n\nmask: integer (starting at 2, incrementing).\n\nbinary_str: character string.\n\ns: substring.\n\ncount_zeros, count_ones: integers.\n\nnew_str: character string.\n\nvalue: integer*8.\n\nans: integer*8 (the answer).\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: D, i, j, bit, INF = 100000\n\n    integer(8) :: G, min_val, input_number, value, ans\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n\n    !

So need to declare them before the loop.\n\nSo need to adjust that.\n\nLet me rework the first part's code:\n\nInside the first part:\n\nallocate p and c arrays.\n\nInitialize min_val = INF.\n\nThen:\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\n    integer :: score, solve_num\n\n    score =0\n\n    solve_num =0\n\n    do i=0, D-1\n\n        if (btest(bit, i)) then\n\n            score = score + 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i)\n\n            solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (score < G) then\n\n        outer: do i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n            if (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n\n                do j=1, p(i)-1\n\n                    score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n                    solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n                    if (score >= G) exit outer\n\n                end do\n\n            end if\n\n        end do outer\n\n    end if\n\n    if (score >= G) then\n\n        if (solve_num < min_val) then\n\n            min_val = solve_num\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables score and solve_num must be declared before the loop. So:\n\ninteger :: score, solve_num\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\n    score =0\n\n    solve_num =0\n\n    ... rest as before.\n\nWait, but the variables need to be declared outside the loop. So:\n\nInside the first part's code:\n\ninteger :: score, solve_num\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\n    score =0\n\n    solve_num =0\n\n    ... loops...\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's loop, the mask is incremented each time, but in the code above, the loop is a do while (ans == -1). So the loop continues until ans is found.\n\nWait, the code in the second part:\n\ndo while (ans == -1)\n\n    process mask.\n\n    if value >= input_number \u2192 set ans to value and exit loop.\n\n    else \u2192 increment mask.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after processing mask, if the value is less than input_number, then mask is incremented. But the loop continues until ans is set.\n\nWait, the code inside the loop:\n\nif (value >= input_number) then\n\n    ans = value \u2192 exit the loop.\n\nelse:\n\n    mask = mask +1 \u2192 and continue the loop.\n\nWait, but the loop is do while (ans == -1). So after setting ans, the loop will exit.\n\nBut in the code as written, after processing mask, if the value is less than input, then mask is incremented, but the loop continues. So the next iteration will process mask+1.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAnother possible issue is the function int_to_bin. Let me check the function again.\n\nThe function:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n    character(len=32) :: bin_str\n\n    integer :: temp, i\n\n    bin_str = ''\n\n    temp = n\n\n    if (temp ==0) then\n\n        bin_str = '0'\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    do\n\n        bin_str = char(ichar('0') + mod(temp,2)) // bin_str\n\n        temp = temp /2\n\n        if (temp ==0) exit\n\n    end do\n\nend function\n\nThis should work. For example, n=2:\n\ntemp starts as 2.\n\nmod(2,2)=0 \u2192 char('0') \u2192 '0' is prepended to bin_str (which is initially empty \u2192 becomes '0').\n\ntemp becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nmod(1,2)=1 \u2192 '1' prepended \u2192 '10'.\n\ntemp becomes 0 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nSo bin_str is '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: n=5 (101):\n\ntemp=5 \u2192 mod 1 \u2192 '1' \u2192 bin_str is '1'\n\ntemp=2 \u2192 mod 0 \u2192 '0' \u2192 '01'\n\ntemp=1 \u2192 mod 1 \u2192 '101'\n\ntemp becomes 0 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo bin_str is '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the code for the second part, after getting s = bin_str(2:len_trim(bin_str)), for mask=5 (binary '101'), s is '01'.\n\nThen count_zeros=1, count_ones=1 \u2192 proceed.\n\nnew_str becomes '47', which is 47.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nInitially, ans is -1.\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nLoop:\n\nprocess mask=2:\n\nbinary_str is '10' \u2192 s is '0' \u2192 length 1.\n\ncount_zeros=1, count_ones=0 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skip.\n\nmask becomes 3.\n\nmask=3 \u2192 binary '11' \u2192 s is '1' \u2192 counts 0 and 1 \u2192 not equal \u2192 skip.\n\nmask=4 \u2192 binary '100' \u2192 s is '00' \u2192 counts 2 zeros, 0 ones \u2192 no.\n\nmask=5 \u2192 s is '01' \u2192 counts 1 and 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nnew_str is '47', which is 47. If input_number is, say, 40 \u2192 47 is the answer.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if the first part's min is 0? Probably not, since the problem's constraints likely have min at least 0, but in the code, INF is 100000, so if no solution is found, but the problem's constraints ensure that there is a solution.\n\nAnother edge case: when the second part's input is very large, but the code will loop until it finds a suitable mask.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the mask is an integer. Since the second problem's input can be up to 1e18 (since the first problem's G is a long), but the mask can be up to a very large number. However, in practice, the mask will eventually find a suitable value because the number of 4/7 digits increases, so the value will eventually exceed the input.\n\nNow, in the code for the second part, the loop is:\n\ndo while (ans == -1)\n\n    process mask.\n\n    if found \u2192 set ans and exit.\n\n    else \u2192 increment mask.\n\nThus, the loop will continue until ans is found.\n\nNow, in the code, after processing mask, if the value is less than input_number, then mask is incremented, and the loop continues.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (value >= input_number) then\n\n    ans = value \u2192 exit loop.\n\nelse:\n\n    mask = mask +1 \u2192 and continue.\n\nWait, but the loop is do while (ans == -1). So after setting ans, the loop will exit.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nmask starts at 2.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nprocess mask.\n\nif the value is sufficient \u2192 set ans and exit.\n\nelse \u2192 increment mask and continue.\n\nThus, the loop will process mask=2,3,4,... until a suitable value is found.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop is written as:\n\ndo while (ans == -1)\n\n    process mask.\n\n    if (value >= input_number) then\n\n        ans = value \u2192 exit loop.\n\n    else\n\n        mask = mask +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, after the else, mask is incremented, but the loop continues. The loop condition is checked at the top.\n\nWait, the code as written in the previous draft:\n\nInside the do while loop:\n\nif (value >= input_number) then\n\n    ans = value \u2192 which sets ans to a positive value, so the loop will exit.\n\nelse:\n\n    mask = mask +1 \u2192 and the loop continues.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nmask is initialized to 2.\n\nThe loop runs as long as ans is -1.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final Fortran code would look like this, with the corrections for variable declarations and loops.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part's code, the loop over bits may have 2^D iterations. For D up to 8, this is manageable (256 iterations).\n\nNow, the final code:\n\nI'll write it step by step, ensuring all variables are properly declared.\n\nHere's the full code:\n\nprogram combined\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: D, i, j, bit, INF = 100000\n\n    integer(8) :: G, min_val, input_number, value, ans\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n\n    !

Otherwise, mask is incremented and the loop continues.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- In the second part's loop, the mask is an integer. For large values, it might overflow. But in Fortran, integers are typically 4 bytes, but if mask can be up to very large numbers (like 1e18), then this would be a problem. However, the second problem's input is the min_val from the first problem, which is at most 100000 (since INF is 100000). So the required value is at most something like 4444444444 (if min_val is 1e5), but even that is manageable as a 64-bit integer. So using integer(8) for mask would be better.\n\nWait, in the code above, mask is declared as an integer (default kind). To handle large values, mask should be integer(8).\n\nSo in the second part's code:\n\ninteger(8) :: mask =2\n\nand in the loop:\n\nmask = mask +1\n\nAlso, the function int_to_bin must handle large integers. But the function is currently taking an integer (default kind) as input. So need to change the function to take integer(8).\n\nThus, the function should be:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: n\n\n    character(len=32) :: bin_str\n\n    integer(8) :: temp\n\n    integer :: i\n\n    bin_str = ''\n\n    temp = n\n\n    if (temp ==0_8) then\n\n        bin_str = '0'\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    do\n\n        bin_str = char(ichar('0') + mod(temp,2_8)) // bin_str\n\n        temp = temp /2_8\n\n        if (temp ==0_8) exit\n\n    end do\n\nend function int_to_bin\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function for integers of kind 8 can be done with mod(temp,2_8). Also, the division is okay.\n\nThus, the mask variable should be integer(8), and the function's parameter is integer(8).\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nIn the second part's variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: mask =2\n\nand in the function:\n\nFUNCTION int_to_bin(n) RESULT(bin_str)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: n\n\n    character(len=32) :: bin_str\n\n    integer(8) :: temp\n\n    integer :: i\n\n    bin_str = ''\n\n    temp = n\n\n    if (temp ==0_8) then\n\n        bin_str = '0'\n\n        return\n\n    end if\n\n    do\n\n        bin_str = char(ichar('0') + mod(temp,2_8)) // bin_str\n\n        temp = temp /2_8\n\n        if (temp ==0_8) exit\n\n    end do\n\nend function int_to_bin\n\nThis way, large masks are handled.\n\nAlso, in the second part's loop:\n\nThe value is read from new_str as an integer(8).\n\nThus, the code should now handle large numbers.\n\nAnother possible issue: the new_str may be longer than 32 characters. The current bin_str is length 32, but for very large masks, the binary string could be longer. However, since the input_number is up to 1e5 (the first problem's min_val), the required value won't be too large. For example, even if the input is 1e5, the minimal number with equal 4 and7 digits would be something like 4444444444 (but depends on the mask). But the binary string length for mask up to say 2^30 is manageable in 32 characters.\n\nAlternatively, increase the length of bin_str to 64.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the code as written, with the corrections for integer(8).\n\nThus, the final code with these changes:\n\nprogram combined\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: D, i, j, bit, INF = 100000\n\n    integer(8) :: G, min_val, input_number, value, ans\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n\n    !
