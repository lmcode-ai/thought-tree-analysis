    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_400_B). It reads n and m, then an array of strings. For each string, it checks if the position of 'G' is after 'S'. If any string has G after S, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it collects the differences between the indices of S and G for each string, then counts the unique values (using a HashSet). The output is either -1 or the size of the set.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_622_A) takes a long integer position. It calculates some sequence and finds where the position falls. The solve function uses a loop to find the correct index, then computes the result based on that. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. The output is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is either -1 or the set size, which is then the input for the second program. But since we can't have I/O in between, I need to pass the first's output as input to the second's processing, all within Fortran.\n\nWait, but the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But in the Fortran program, we can't have intermediate I/O. So the first part's result must be stored in a variable and passed to the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (n, m, then n strings).\n2. Process the first part (check G before S, compute differences, count unique if valid).\n3. Take the result (either -1 or the set size) and use that as the input to the second part's processing (the position variable in the second Java program).\n4. Compute the second part's result and output it.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a single long (position). So the first program's output (either -1 or the set size) is the input to the second program. So in the Fortran program, after processing the first part, the result (call it first_result) is used as the position in the second part's calculation.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is either -1 or the set size. The second Java program takes a position (a long) as input. So the first's output is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, after computing first_result, we need to pass that to the second part's code, which will compute the final output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n- Read all the input for the first part (n, m, then n strings).\n- Process the first part's logic to get first_result (either -1 or the count of unique differences).\n- Then, use first_result as the position in the second part's code.\n- Compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nn and m are integers. The strings array is an array of strings. For each string, find the indices of 'G' and 'S'. Note that in Java, String.indexOf returns -1 if not found, but in the code, they are using tmp.indexOf(\"G\") and tmp.indexOf(\"S\"). Wait, but in the code, the strings are from sc.next(), so each string is a single token. The problem is, in the code, if either G or S is not present, then the index would be -1, which would cause issues. But the code as written may have some assumptions here. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nfor (String tmp : arrs) {\n    int dexG = tmp.indexOf(\"G\");\n    int dexS = tmp.indexOf(\"S\");\n    if (dexG > dexS) {\n        returnDex = -1;\n    }\n    length[index++] = dexS - dexG;\n}\n\nWait, but if either G or S is not present in the string, then dexG or dexS would be -1, leading to possible negative differences. But the code's logic here is that if G comes after S (dexG > dexS), then returnDex is set to -1. But if either is not present, then that condition could be triggered. However, the problem's original code may have constraints that each string contains exactly one G and one S, so that the indices are valid. Otherwise, the code might have bugs. Since the problem is from Codeforces, perhaps the input ensures that each string has exactly one G and one S. So in the Fortran code, I can assume that each string has both characters, so their indices are valid.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each string, I need to find the positions of 'G' and 'S'. Since Fortran strings are arrays of characters, we can loop through each character to find their positions.\n\nThe steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n and m (though m isn't used in the first program, so maybe it's a typo? Wait, looking at the first Java code, the variables n and m are read, but m is not used. So perhaps it's a mistake, but in the problem's context, maybe the first program's input is n and m followed by n strings, but m is not used. So in the Fortran code, we can read n and m, but ignore m.\n\nThen, read n strings. For each string, find the positions of 'G' and 'S'. Then check if G is after S (dexG > dexS). If any such case, set returnDex to -1. Then collect the differences (dexS - dexG) into an array. Then, collect the unique values of these differences (if returnDex is not -1). The count of unique values is the first_result.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses a HashSet to store the lengths. So in Fortran, to find the number of unique elements in the array, we can sort the array and count unique elements, or use a logical array to track presence.\n\nAlternatively, since the differences can be negative (if S comes before G?), but in the code, if G is after S, then returnDex is set to -1, so in that case, the first_result is -1, and the second part's input is -1. But the second Java program expects a position (a long), so passing -1 would be problematic. Wait, but in the first Java code, if returnDex is -1, it prints -1, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a long, so that's okay. But in the second Java code, the solve function may have issues with negative positions. However, according to the problem's original setup, perhaps the first program's output is always non-negative except when it's -1, and the second program's input is that value. So in the second part, when the first result is -1, the second part's code would process it as position = -1, but the code may not handle that. However, the original Java code's first program outputs -1 in that case, so the second program would receive that as input, and proceed. So in the Fortran code, we have to handle that.\n\nNow, for the first part in Fortran:\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, returnDex = 0\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: lengths\ncharacter(len=255) :: strings(1000)  ! assuming max n is 1000, but better to read dynamically?\n\nWait, but in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated. Let's see:\n\nRead n and m first. Then allocate an array of strings with size n. But in Fortran, strings can be of varying lengths, but perhaps we can read each string into a fixed-length character variable. Let's assume each string is up to, say, 100 characters. So:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: arrs(n)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't have allocatable arrays without knowing the size first. So first read n, then allocate.\n\nWait, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nallocate(arrs(n))\n\nThen read n strings into arrs.\n\nThen process each string:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    string = arrs(i)\n    find the position of 'G' and 'S' in the string.\n\nIn Fortran, to find the index of a character in a string, we can use the index function. For example, index(string, 'G') gives the first occurrence. But note that in Fortran, the index is 1-based. So:\n\ndexG = index(string, 'G')\ndexS = index(string, 'S')\n\nBut if the character is not found, index returns 0. Wait, no, in Fortran, the INDEX function returns the position of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns 0. So if either is 0, that means the character is not present. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps each string has exactly one G and one S, so we can assume that.\n\nThen, check if dexG > dexS. If so, set returnDex = -1.\n\nThen, compute the difference (dexS - dexG) and store in lengths array.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the length array is filled with dexS - dexG. But if G is after S, then this difference is negative. But in the code, if any such case exists, returnDex is set to -1, so the final output is -1, and the lengths array is not considered. So in the Fortran code, even if returnDex is -1, we can still compute the lengths array, but it won't be used.\n\nAfter processing all strings, if returnDex is -1, then first_result is -1. Else, we need to count the number of unique elements in the lengths array.\n\nTo count unique elements in Fortran:\n\nWe can sort the array and then count the unique entries.\n\nAlternatively, use a hash-like approach. Since the differences can be negative, but in the case where returnDex is not -1, then all dexG < dexS, so the differences are positive. Wait, no: if G is before S, then dexG < dexS, so the difference is positive. So the lengths array will have positive integers. So the differences are positive.\n\nSo, to count unique elements:\n\nSort the array, then iterate and count when the value changes.\n\nAlternatively, use a logical array to track which values have been seen.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nAfter collecting all the differences into an array (lengths), if returnDex is not -1, then:\n\nSort the lengths array.\n\nInitialize count = 1 (if array is not empty).\n\nThen loop from the second element to the end, and if current element is different from previous, increment count.\n\nThus, the count is the number of unique elements.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (returnDex == -1) then\n    first_result = -1\nelse\n    call sort(lengths)\n    count = 1\n    do i = 2, n\n        if (lengths(i) /= lengths(i-1)) then\n            count = count +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    first_result = count\nend if\n\nNow, moving to the second part.\n\nThe second part's input is the first_result (either -1 or the count). The second part's code is to compute the output based on that.\n\nThe second Java program's solve function:\n\nlong position = sc.nextLong();\n\nThen, find the nearest sequence start index.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nThe code loops to find the largest nrstSeqStartIndx such that getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position. Then, it increments until the next value is beyond position.\n\nWait, let me re-express the algorithm.\n\nThe sequence is such that the value at index k is 1 + (k*(k-1))/2. Wait, let me see:\n\ngetValueAtIndex(index) = 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nWait, the formula is 1 + (index-1)*index / 2. So for index=1, it's 1. index=2: 1 + (1*2)/2 = 2. index=3: 1 + (2*3)/2 = 4. index=4: 1 + (3*4)/2 = 7, etc. So the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, etc. Each term increases by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\nThe problem is to find for a given position, which block it is in. The blocks are defined by the sequence. For example, the first block is 1 (index 1), the second block is 2 (index 2), the third block is 3 elements (indices 3-5?), or perhaps the blocks are between the sequence values. Wait, the code's logic is:\n\nThe first while loop multiplies nrstSeqStartIndx by 2 until the next value (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2)) is less than position. This is to find a starting point that's in the right ballpark.\n\nThen, the second while loop increments nrstSeqStartIndx until the next value (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1)) is larger than position. So the correct nrstSeqStartIndx is the one where the current value is <= position and the next is > position.\n\nOnce found, the startIndex is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the result is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nSo the algorithm is to find the largest index k such that getValueAtIndex(k) <= position, and then compute the position within that block.\n\nIn Fortran, the code for the second part would take the first_result as the position variable. But if first_result is -1, then the second part's code would process that. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first_result is -1, then the second part's code would compute the result for position = -1. But according to the second Java code's logic, the getValueAtIndex function would return 1 + (index-1)*index/2. For index=1, it's 1. So if position is -1, the first while loop would start with nrstSeqStartIndx=1. Then, getValueAtIndex(2) is 2, which is greater than -1, so the loop doesn't run. Then, the second while loop checks if getValueAtIndex(2) <= -1. Since 2 is not <= -1, the loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValueAtIndex(1) =1. The result is (-1 -1)+1 = -1. But the second Java code's output would be that. However, the first program's output is -1, so the second program's input is -1, and the output would be -1. But perhaps the problem expects that when the first program outputs -1, the second program's input is -1, and the second program's code would process it as such. So in the Fortran code, we have to handle that.\n\nSo in the second part's code:\n\nposition = first_result\n\nThen, compute the result as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables for the second part:\n\ninteger :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result\n\nBut since the position can be up to very large (since in Java it's a long), but in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Assuming that the input can be up to 1e18, which would require 8-byte integers (selected_int_kind(18)), so we need to use integer(8) variables.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to handle large numbers, we can use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18). Let me use integer(8) for all variables involved in the second part.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result\n\nThe steps:\n\nposition = first_result\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8\nend do\n\nthen:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1_8\n\nThen, print result.\n\nBut the getValueAtIndex function is:\n\nfunction getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but since we are using integers, (index-1)*index is an integer, divided by 2. So for even and odd indices, it's okay.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program structure:\n\nRead n and m (ignoring m), then read n strings.\n\nProcess first part to get first_result.\n\nThen, set position = first_result.\n\nProcess second part to compute result.\n\nPrint result.\n\nNow, handling the strings in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read n and m:\n\nread*, n, m\n\nThen, allocate an array of strings. Since in Fortran, strings can be of varying lengths, but for simplicity, let's assume each string is up to, say, 100 characters. So:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: arrs(n)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read*, arrs(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the strings are read via sc.next(), which reads the next token. So each string is a single token, so in Fortran, using read*, which reads until whitespace, is okay.\n\nNow, processing each string:\n\nallocate an array for lengths:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: lengths\n\nallocate(lengths(n))\n\nreturnDex = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    string = arrs(i)\n    dexG = index(string, 'G')\n    dexS = index(string, 'S')\n    if (dexG > dexS) then\n        returnDex = -1\n    end if\n    lengths(i) = dexS - dexG\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the index function returns the position of the first occurrence. So if 'G' is not present, index returns 0. So if either dexG or dexS is 0, then the code would have an issue. But according to the problem's constraints, each string has exactly one G and one S, so we can assume that.\n\nThen, after processing all strings, if returnDex is -1, first_result is -1. Else, we need to count unique elements in lengths.\n\nSorting the lengths array:\n\ncall sort(lengths)\n\ncount = 1\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    if (lengths(i) /= lengths(i-1)) then\n        count = count +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nfirst_result = count\n\nWait, but only if returnDex is not -1.\n\nSo:\n\nif (returnDex == -1) then\n    first_result = -1\nelse\n    call sort(lengths)\n    count = 1\n    do i = 2, n\n        if (lengths(i) /= lengths(i-1)) then\n            count = count +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    first_result = count\nend if\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nposition = first_result\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8\nend do\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult = (position - startIndex) +1_8\n\nprint*, result\n\nBut need to define the function getValueAtIndex.\n\nIn Fortran, functions can be defined inside the program, but in older versions, they need to be in a module. Alternatively, use an internal function.\n\nAlternatively, write it inline.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90, you can have internal functions.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    getValueAtIndex = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\nend function\n\nBut need to place this function in the correct scope.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all the code into a single Fortran program.\n\nBut let's think about the variables:\n\nWe need to declare all variables properly.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex, count\n    integer, allocatable :: lengths(:)\n    character(len=100) :: arrs(1000)  ! Wait, but n can be up to what? Maybe better to read n first, then allocate.\n\nWait, better to read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex, count\n    integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result\n    character(len=100), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: lengths(:)\n\n    read*, n, m\n\n    allocate(arrs(n))\n    allocate(lengths(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read*, arrs(i)\n    end do\n\n    returnDex = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        ! Find positions of G and S in arrs(i)\n        integer :: dexG, dexS\n        dexG = index(arrs(i), 'G')\n        dexS = index(arrs(i), 'S')\n        if (dexG > dexS) then\n            returnDex = -1\n        end if\n        lengths(i) = dexS - dexG\n    end do\n\n    if (returnDex == -1) then\n        first_result = -1\n    else\n        call sort(lengths)  ! Need to sort the array\n        count = 1\n        do i = 2, n\n            if (lengths(i) /= lengths(i-1)) then\n                count = count +1\n            end if\n        end do\n        first_result = count\n    end if\n\n    position = first_result\n\n    ! Now process the second part\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2_8\n    end do\n\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1_8\n    end do\n\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    result = (position - startIndex) +1_8\n\n    print*, result\n\ncontains\n    integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n        getValueAtIndex = 1_8 + (index -1_8)*index /2_8\n    end function getValueAtIndex\n\n    ! Need to implement a sort function for the lengths array\n    subroutine sort(arr)\n        integer, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: arr\n        integer :: i, j, temp, n\n        n = size(arr)\n        do i = 1, n-1\n            do j = i+1, n\n                if (arr(i) > arr(j)) then\n                    temp = arr(i)\n                    arr(i) = arr(j)\n                    arr(j) = temp\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end subroutine sort\nend program main\n\nWait, but the sort function here is a simple bubble sort. For small n (since the first problem's n is probably not too big), this is acceptable. Alternatively, use a better sort, but for the purpose of this problem, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the sort subroutine is inside the contains section. The sort is for an integer array. The lengths array is of integers, so that's okay.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The strings are read with read*, which reads until whitespace. Since each string is a token, this is correct.\n\n- The index function in Fortran is case-sensitive? The problem's strings have 'G' and 'S', so assuming the input is uppercase.\n\n- The first part's code sets returnDex to -1 if any string has G after S. The rest of the code proceeds.\n\n- The lengths array is filled with dexS - dexG. Since in the case where returnDex is not -1, all dexG < dexS, so the differences are positive.\n\n- The sort function sorts the array in ascending order, so the unique count is correct.\n\n- The second part's code uses the first_result as position. The function getValueAtIndex is correctly implemented.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The sort function may not be efficient, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\n- The maximum length of the strings (100 characters). If the input strings are longer, this could be a problem. But given that in the first Java code, the strings are read via sc.next(), which reads the entire token, but in Fortran, the read* reads until whitespace. So if the input has strings with spaces, that would be an issue. But the problem likely assumes that each string is a single token without spaces, so the 100 length is sufficient.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when returnDex is not -1, the code sorts the lengths array and counts unique elements. The sort is necessary to group duplicates together.\n\nTesting with sample inputs would help, but given the time constraints, proceed.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, the code uses a hash set in Java. The Fortran code uses a sort and count, which is equivalent for the purpose of counting unique elements.\n\nThus, this should work."
