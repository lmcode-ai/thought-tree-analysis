    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (AGC005_B). It reads an integer N and an array a of N integers. Then it calculates two arrays leftl and rightl using some stack operations. Finally, it computes the sum ans by multiplying each a[i] with (leftl[i]+1)*(rightl[i]+1) and outputs the result. \n\nThe second Java file (ABC120_C) reads a string x, processes it with a stack to count pairs of '0' and '1' that can be removed in pairs, and outputs twice the count. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, but the first program outputs a number, and the second expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Oh, perhaps the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are connected? Like the first program's output is the input to the second? But the first outputs a number, and the second expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I need to check the problem again.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number (the ans), and the second program expects a string (the x). So that would mean that the first program's output is a string that the second program reads as x. But the first program's output is a single integer. So the second program would read that integer as a string? Like, if the first outputs \"123\", then the second's x is \"123\"?\n\nAh, that's probably the case. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the second program, which reads it as a string. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that result as the input to the second program's processing, and output the final result of the second program. \n\nSo the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (N and array a), compute the first's output (the ans), then use that ans as the input to the second program (as a string), compute the second's output, and print that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N and the array a from input (the first part's input).\n2. Compute the first program's ans (the sum).\n3. Then, take that ans as the input to the second program's processing (as a string).\n4. Process that string through the second program's logic (the stack counting).\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst part (Java1):\n\nRead N and a array.\n\nCompute leftl and rightl arrays using stack-like operations.\n\nCompute ans as sum of a[i]*(leftl[i]+1)*(rightl[i]+1).\n\nSecond part (Java2):\n\nTake the ans (as a string) as input x.\n\nProcess x with a stack to count pairs of 0 and 1, then output 2*c.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read N and the array a.\n\n- Compute the first part's ans.\n\n- Convert ans to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n\n- Process that string through the second part's logic.\n\n- Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's algorithm.\n\nThe first Java program uses two arrays leftl and rightl. The code uses a stack (ArrayDeque) to track indices. Let me see how to implement that in Fortran.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nThe first loop for rightl:\n\nInitialize a deque (stack). The loop goes from 0 to N-1 (index starts at 0). For each index, while the stack is not empty and a[stack's top] > a[index], pop the top and set rightl[ind] = index - ind -1. Then push the current index.\n\nWait, the code uses a stack (ArrayDeque) as a stack (since they use push and poll). So in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array to simulate the stack, with a pointer indicating the top.\n\nSame for the leftl part.\n\nHmm, implementing the stack in Fortran.\n\nLet me think about the first part's algorithm step by step.\n\nFirst, for rightl:\n\nInitialize a stack (array with a top index). Start with index=0.\n\nLoop while index < N:\n\n   while stack is not empty and a[stack(top)] > a[index]:\n\n       pop the top (ind), set rightl[ind] = index - ind -1\n\n   push index to stack, then increment index.\n\nAfter processing all elements, any remaining elements in the stack have their rightl set to N - ind -1.\n\nWait, the code after the first loop:\n\nwhile (!que.isEmpty()) {\n\n    int ind = que.poll();\n\n    rightl[ind] = N - ind -1;\n\n}\n\nWait, the first loop processes elements until index reaches N. Then, for any remaining elements in the stack, their rightl is set to N - ind -1.\n\nSimilarly for the leftl part.\n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, we can represent the stack as an array with a top index. Let's see.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read N and the array a.\n\nThen, compute rightl and leftl arrays.\n\nImplementing the stack for rightl:\n\nInitialize stack as an array of integers, say stack(1:N), and a top variable starting at 0.\n\nindex starts at 1 (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the original code uses 0-based indices. Wait, in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays, but adjust indices accordingly. Alternatively, use 0-based by declaring arrays from 0 to N-1. Hmm, better to use 1-based for simplicity unless necessary.\n\nWait, in Java, the array a is 0-based (indices 0 to N-1). So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to use 1-based arrays, but adjust the indices. Alternatively, use 0-based by declaring arrays from 0 to N-1. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: a, leftl, rightl\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based, so need to specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices accordingly. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the first part's variables:\n\nRead N, then read N integers into an array a (size N).\n\nThen, compute rightl and leftl arrays of size N.\n\nImplementing the stack for rightl:\n\nInitialize stack as an array of integers, with a top variable. Let's say stack(1:N), top =0.\n\nindex starts at 1 (since in Java it starts at 0, but in Fortran, perhaps 1-based). Wait, need to be careful with indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first loop for rightl is:\n\nindex starts at 0 (Java's first element is 0), and increments until index < N.\n\nIn Fortran, if we use 1-based arrays, then the indices would be 1 to N. So perhaps we need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based arrays in Fortran by declaring a(0:N-1), etc. Let me choose that approach to avoid confusion.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: N = ... (but N is input, so we need to read it first)\n\nWait, variables in Fortran can be allocated dynamically. So perhaps:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nThen, allocate arrays a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1).\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead a(0), a(1), ..., a(N-1).\n\nInitialize rightl and leftl arrays to 0.\n\nThen, process rightl:\n\nInitialize stack as an array, say stack(0:N-1), and a top variable starting at -1 (since 0-based, stack(0) is first element). Or use a separate array and a top index.\n\nAlternatively, use a stack implemented with an array and a top index.\n\nLet me think of the stack as an array with a top pointer. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: stack(0:N-1), top = -1\n\nInitially, top is -1 (empty).\n\nThen, for the first loop (processing rightl):\n\nindex = 0\n\ndo while (index < N)\n\n   do while (top >=0 .and. a(stack(top)) > a(index))\n\n       ind = stack(top)\n\n       top = top -1\n\n       rightl(ind) = index - ind -1\n\n   end do\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = index\n\n   index = index +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the stack is a deque, and they use push and poll. The code in Java uses a stack (LIFO), so the above approach with a stack array and top pointer is correct.\n\nThen, after processing all elements, we need to process the remaining elements in the stack:\n\ndo while (top >=0)\n\n   ind = stack(top)\n\n   top = top -1\n\n   rightl(ind) = N - ind -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first loop (index reaches N), they process the remaining elements in the queue (which is a deque, but in the code, after the first loop, the queue is processed in order? Wait, the code uses a deque, but in the first loop, they are pushing to the front (using push, which adds to the front in deque). Wait, in the Java code, the que is an ArrayDeque, and they use push() which adds to the front. So the stack is implemented as a LIFO structure. So the code's first loop is processing elements in order, and the stack holds indices in a way that the top is the most recent.\n\nWait, the code in Java for the first loop:\n\nwhile (index < N) {\n\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n\n        int ind = que.poll();\n\n        rightl[ind] = index - ind -1;\n\n    }\n\n    que.push(index++);\n\n}\n\nWait, que.push adds to the front (since it's a stack). So the stack is LIFO. So the code's first loop is similar to the stack approach I outlined in Fortran.\n\nSo the Fortran code for the first part's rightl processing is as above.\n\nThen, the leftl processing is similar but in reverse.\n\nThe code for leftl:\n\nindex starts at N-1 (the last element), and goes down to 0.\n\nThe stack is again used, but this time, the processing is similar but in reverse.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nindex = N-1;\n\nwhile (index >=0) {\n\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n\n        int ind = que.poll();\n\n        leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n    }\n\n    que.push(index--);\n\n}\n\nThen, after that, process remaining elements in the queue:\n\nwhile (!que.isEmpty()) {\n\n    int ind = que.poll();\n\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1; // Wait, here index is the last value after the loop, which is -1?\n\nWait, in the Java code, after the loop, the index is -1, so the code for the remaining elements:\n\nWait, in the code after the first loop for rightl, the que is emptied, but in the leftl processing, the que is reused. Wait, the code in Java for leftl:\n\nAfter the first part (rightl), the code does:\n\nindex = N-1;\n\nwhile (index >=0) {\n\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n\n        int ind = que.poll();\n\n        leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n    }\n\n    que.push(index--);\n\n}\n\nThen, while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n\n    int ind = que.poll();\n\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n}\n\nWait, here, after the loop, index is -1 (since the loop runs while index >=0, so after the loop, index is -1). So in the second part, when que is not empty, the code does:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - index -1 \u2192 ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +0 \u2192 ind?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait, in the code for leftl:\n\nAfter the first loop (processing from N-1 down to 0), the code then processes the remaining elements in the queue:\n\nwhile (!que.isEmpty()) {\n\n    int ind = que.poll();\n\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n}\n\nBut at this point, index is -1 (since the loop ended when index became -1). So the calculation is ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +1 -1 \u2192 ind. So leftl[ind] = ind?\n\nWait, that can't be correct. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the code for leftl:\n\nThe first loop for leftl is:\n\nindex starts at N-1, and goes down to 0.\n\nInside the loop, after popping elements from the stack (que), they set leftl[ind] = ind - index -1.\n\nWait, the code for leftl's first loop:\n\nWhen processing index (starting from N-1 down to 0), the popped elements are those where a[que's top] > a[index]. So for each such ind (the popped index), the leftl[ind] is set to ind - index -1.\n\nWait, but the index here is the current index being processed (the lower indices). So for example, if ind is to the right of index, then the distance between them is ind - index -1?\n\nWait, perhaps the leftl array is the number of elements to the left of ind that are smaller than a[ind], but I'm not sure. The exact calculation is important here.\n\nBut regardless, the code in Java for leftl's remaining elements after the loop is:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - index -1, where index is now -1 (since the loop ended when index was 0, then index-- becomes -1).\n\nWait, so the code for the remaining elements in the queue after the first loop is:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +1 -1 \u2192 ind. So leftl[ind] = ind?\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the code. Alternatively, perhaps the code in Java has a typo. Let me check the original code again.\n\nLooking back at the Java code for leftl:\n\nThe code after the first loop (processing index from N-1 down to 0):\n\nwhile (!que.isEmpty()) {\n\n    int ind = que.poll();\n\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n}\n\nWait, the index here is the index variable from the loop, which after the loop is -1. So the calculation is ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +0 \u2192 ind. So leftl[ind] = ind?\n\nHmm, that seems incorrect. Maybe the code has a bug here. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for leftl's remaining elements should be using the initial index value before the loop? Not sure. But since the code is given, I have to translate it as is.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran, I need to replicate exactly the same steps as the Java code.\n\nSo for the leftl processing:\n\nInitialize stack again (since in Java, the same deque is reused, but in Fortran, perhaps we can reuse the same array and reset top to -1).\n\nWait, in the Java code, after processing rightl, the que is emptied (since in the first loop, after processing all elements, they poll all remaining elements and set their rightl). Then, for leftl, they reuse the same deque, but start fresh? Or is the deque still empty?\n\nWait, in the code for rightl:\n\nAfter the first loop (index < N), they process the remaining elements in the queue (que) by polling them and setting rightl[ind] = N - ind -1. So after that, the queue is empty.\n\nThen, for the leftl processing, they start with an empty queue again? Because in the code for leftl's first loop, they push index into the queue again.\n\nWait, the code for leftl's first loop:\n\nindex = N-1\n\nwhile (index >=0) {\n\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n\n        int ind = que.poll();\n\n        leftl[ind] = ind - index -1;\n\n    }\n\n    que.push(index--);\n\n}\n\nSo the que is initially empty (since after processing rightl, the que was emptied). So the leftl processing starts with an empty queue.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after processing rightl, we can reset the stack array and top to -1 again for the leftl processing.\n\nSo for the leftl processing in Fortran:\n\nInitialize stack and top again (top = -1).\n\nindex = N-1\n\ndo while (index >=0)\n\n    do while (top >=0 .and. a(stack(top)) > a(index))\n\n        ind = stack(top)\n\n        top = top -1\n\n        leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n\n    end do\n\n    top = top +1\n\n    stack(top) = index\n\n    index = index -1\n\nend do\n\nThen, process remaining elements in the stack:\n\ndo while (top >=0)\n\n    ind = stack(top)\n\n    top = top -1\n\n    leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first loop (index >=0), the index becomes -1. So in the second loop (processing remaining elements), the code uses the current index (which is -1) in the calculation.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first loop (the do while (index >=0)), the index will be -1. Then, in the second loop, when we process the remaining elements in the stack, the code for leftl is:\n\nleftl(ind) = ind - index -1 \u2192 ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +0 \u2192 ind.\n\nHmm, that's strange, but that's what the code does. So in Fortran, after the first loop, index is -1, so that's correct.\n\nOnce leftl and rightl are computed, the ans is the sum over i of a[i]*(leftl[i]+1)*(rightl[i]+1).\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem is to take the ans (the first program's output) and process it as the input to the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program reads a string x, which is the output of the first program. The second program counts the number of times two adjacent characters (0 and 1 or 1 and 0) can be removed in pairs, and outputs twice the count.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code:\n\nThe code uses a stack to process each character in x. For each character, push it onto the stack. Then, while the stack has at least two elements, check the top two. If they are '0' and '1' or '1' and '0', pop them, increment the count, and continue. Else, break. At the end, output 2*c.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor each character in x:\n\n    push to stack.\n\n    while stack.size() >1:\n\n        p = pop, q=pop.\n\n        if (p and q are 0 and 1 in either order):\n\n            c +=1\n\n            continue (so loop again to check new top)\n\n        else:\n\n            push back q and p, break.\n\nSo the stack is processed after each push, trying to remove pairs.\n\nThe count c is the number of such pairs removed. The output is 2*c, since each pair contributes two characters.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's processing is:\n\nTake the ans (the first program's output, which is a number), convert it to a string, then process that string through the stack algorithm.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to:\n\n1. Convert ans to a string (e.g., using write and read to a string variable).\n\n2. Process the string through the stack algorithm.\n\n3. Output the result (2*c).\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, converting the ans to a string. In Fortran, we can use an internal write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') ans\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces (if any). Wait, but I0 should write without leading spaces. So s will hold the string representation of ans.\n\nThen, process the string s through the stack algorithm.\n\nImplementing the stack for the second part:\n\nWe can use an array to represent the stack, and a top index.\n\nInitialize stack as a character array, say stack(1: len_trim(s)), but since we don't know the length in advance, perhaps use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, since the maximum possible length is the length of the string, which is known once we have s.\n\nAlternatively, use a stack implemented with an array and a top variable.\n\nInitialize stack as a character array of sufficient size (say, 20 characters, since ans can be up to 1e18, which is 19 digits, so 20 is enough). Or better, use the length of s.\n\nLet me see:\n\ninteger :: c =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') ans\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=len_s) :: x = trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=len_s) :: stack\n\ninteger :: top =0\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n    character :: ch = x(i:i)\n\n    top = top +1\n\n    stack(top:top) = ch\n\n    do while (top >=2)\n\n        character :: p = stack(top:top)\n\n        character :: q = stack(top-1:top-1)\n\n        if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n            c = c +1\n\n            top = top -2\n\n        else\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after pushing the current character, they check while the stack has at least two elements. So in each iteration, after pushing, they check the top two elements. If they form a pair, pop both and increment c, then continue checking the new top elements. So the loop continues until no more pairs can be removed.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then they don't push them back, so the stack's top is now top-2. Then, the loop continues (the while loop) to check again the new top elements.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nwhile (stack.size() >1) {\n\n    p = pop, q = pop.\n\n    if pair:\n\n        c++\n\n        continue (so loop again)\n\n    else:\n\n        push back q and p, break.\n\n}\n\nWait, in the code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then they are not pushed back, so the stack's size is reduced by 2. The loop continues (the while loop) to check again the new top elements. So the loop continues until the top two are not a pair.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, after popping (by decrementing top by 2), the loop continues (the do while (top >=2) loop). So that's correct.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code above, after the if condition is true, we set top = top-2, and the loop continues (since the do while is at the end). Wait, no, the do while is structured as:\n\ndo while (top >=2)\n\n    ... \n\n    if (pair):\n\n        c +=1\n\n        top -=2\n\n    else:\n\n        exit\n\nend do\n\nWait, no, in the code I wrote earlier, the loop is:\n\ndo while (top >=2)\n\n    p = stack(top)\n\n    q = stack(top-1)\n\n    if pair:\n\n        c +=1\n\n        top = top-2\n\n    else:\n\n        exit\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in this code, after the first iteration, if the pair is found, the top is reduced by 2, and the loop continues (since the do while is at the end). Wait, no, the loop is a do-while? Or is it a while loop?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the structure is:\n\ndo while (condition)\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\nSo the condition is checked before each iteration. So in the code above, after the first iteration, if the pair is found, top is reduced by 2, then the loop checks again if top >=2. If yes, loop again.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the code correctly loops until no more pairs can be removed.\n\nTherefore, the code for the second part is as above.\n\nOnce c is computed, the output is 2*c.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and the array a.\n\n2. Compute rightl and leftl arrays using the stack approach.\n\n3. Compute ans as the sum.\n\n4. Convert ans to a string s.\n\n5. Process s through the stack algorithm to compute c.\n\n6. Output 2*c.\n\nNow, handling the arrays in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, leftl, rightl\n\ninteger :: ans, c\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x\n\nBut need to read N first, then allocate arrays.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nallocate(a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1))\n\nRead a(0), a(1), ..., a(N-1).\n\nCompute rightl and leftl as per the stack algorithms.\n\nCompute ans.\n\nConvert ans to string s.\n\nProcess s to get c.\n\nPrint 2*c.\n\nNow, implementing the stack for rightl and leftl.\n\nFirst, for rightl:\n\nWe need a stack array and a top variable. Let's use an integer array for indices (0-based).\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: stack_right\n\ninteger :: top_right = -1\n\nProcessing rightl:\n\nindex =0\n\ndo while (index < N)\n\n    do while (top_right >=0 .and. a(stack_right(top_right)) > a(index))\n\n        ind = stack_right(top_right)\n\n        top_right = top_right -1\n\n        rightl(ind) = index - ind -1\n\n    end do\n\n    top_right = top_right +1\n\n    stack_right(top_right) = index\n\n    index = index +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, process remaining elements in the stack:\n\ndo while (top_right >=0)\n\n    ind = stack_right(top_right)\n\n    top_right = top_right -1\n\n    rightl(ind) = N - ind -1\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for leftl:\n\nWe need another stack array and top variable.\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: stack_left\n\ninteger :: top_left = -1\n\nindex = N-1\n\ndo while (index >=0)\n\n    do while (top_left >=0 .and. a(stack_left(top_left)) > a(index))\n\n        ind = stack_left(top_left)\n\n        top_left = top_left -1\n\n        leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n\n    end do\n\n    top_left = top_left +1\n\n    stack_left(top_left) = index\n\n    index = index -1\n\nend do\n\nThen process remaining elements in stack_left:\n\ndo while (top_left >=0)\n\n    ind = stack_left(top_left)\n\n    top_left = top_left -1\n\n    leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code for leftl's remaining elements, the index after the loop is -1. So in the Fortran code, after the first loop (index >=0), the index becomes -1. So in the second loop (processing remaining elements in stack_left):\n\nleftl(ind) = ind - index -1 \u2192 ind - (-1) -1 \u2192 ind +0 \u2192 ind.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nOnce leftl and rightl are computed, compute ans:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n\n    ans = ans + a(i) * (leftl(i)+1) * (rightl(i)+1)\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert ans to a string.\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') ans\n\ntrim the string (though I0 should not have leading spaces, but to be safe):\n\nx = trim(adjustl(s))\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement with '(I0)' should write the number without leading spaces. So x can be set as s.\n\nThen, process the string x through the stack algorithm for the second part.\n\nNow, the stack for the second part:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: stack2\n\ninteger :: top2 =0\n\nc =0\n\nlen_s = len_trim(x)\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n    ch = x(i:i)\n\n    top2 = top2 +1\n\n    stack2(top2:top2) = ch\n\n    do while (top2 >=2)\n\n        p = stack2(top2:top2)\n\n        q = stack2(top2-1:top2-1)\n\n        if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '1' .and. q == '0') ) then \u2192 Wait, no, the condition is (p and q are 0 and 1 in either order).\n\nWait, the condition is (p == '1' and q == '0') or (p == '0' and q == '1').\n\nSo:\n\nif ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n    c = c +1\n\n    top2 = top2 -2\n\nelse\n\n    exit\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code above, after the if condition is true, we set top2 = top2 -2, and the loop continues (since the do while is at the top). The loop will check again if top2 >=2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the stack2 is a character array. The indices are 1-based? Or 0-based?\n\nWait, in the code above, stack2 is declared as len=20, so indices 1 to 20. The top2 starts at 0, so when we push, top2 becomes 1, etc.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInitially, top2 is 0. When we push the first character, top2 becomes 1, and stack2(1:1) is set to ch.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code for the second part is as above.\n\nFinally, output 2*c.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling the input for the first part.\n\nIn Fortran, reading N and then the array a.\n\nRead *, N\n\nallocate(a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1))\n\nread *, (a(i), i=0,N-1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the read statement for the array can be done as:\n\nread *, (a(i), i=0,N-1)\n\nBut the input may have the numbers separated by spaces, so that should work.\n\nNow, putting all the code together.\n\nBut need to make sure that all variables are properly declared and the code is structured correctly.\n\nNow, the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: N, i, ans, c, ind, index, top_right, top_left, top2, len_s\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, leftl, rightl\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: stack_right, stack_left\n    character(len=20) :: s, x\n    character(len=20) :: stack2\n    character :: ch, p, q\n\n    !

The stack2 is declared as len=20, so indices 1 to 20. The top2 starts at 0, so when pushing, it goes up to 20.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's processing, the stack2 is initialized to spaces, but when we write to stack2(top2:top2), it should overwrite the space. Since we are only using the characters pushed, the initial spaces don't matter as long as we track the top correctly.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose N=3, a = [3,1,2].\n\nFirst part's processing:\n\nLet me see what the first program would output.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with code.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's code, the stack arrays (stack_right and stack_left) are allocated as 0:N-1. But in the loops, when pushing, the top starts at -1, so the first element is at 0, which is within the array's bounds. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the second part's stack processing, the loop over i from 1 to len_s (the length of x). The characters are taken as x(i:i), which is correct.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
