    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_AGC025_A. The main method reads an integer N from input. Then it calculates n as N/2 if even, or (N+1)/2 if odd. Then it initializes ans as the sum of sum(1) and sum(N-1). Then it loops A from 1 to n, checking if the sum of sum(A) and sum(N-A) is smaller than the current ans, updating ans if so. Finally, it prints ans.\n\nThe sum function here takes an integer a and returns the sum of its digits. For example, sum(123) would be 6.\n\nThe second Java file is atcoder_ABC174_C. Its main method reads an integer K, then calls solve(). The solve function first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returning -1 in that case. Then if K is divisible by 7, it divides by 7. Then multiplies K by 9. Then it calculates the minimal ans where 10^ans mod (K) equals 1 mod K. The loop increments ans until the remainder becomes 1. The result is returned, and printed.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is K, which should be the output of the first program. Because the first program outputs ans, which is the minimal digit sum, and that becomes the input K for the second program.\n\nSo the entire sequence is: input N to first program, get output ans1, then input ans1 to second program, get output ans2, which is the final result.\n\nThe task is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The first program's input is read via stdin, the second's output is written to stdout. The intermediate data (the first program's output) is passed between them without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read N from input (only first part reads input)\n2. Compute the first program's result (ans1)\n3. Use ans1 as the input K for the second program's computation\n4. Compute the second program's result (ans2)\n5. Output ans2 (only last part writes output)\n\nNo intermediate I/O. So the Fortran program must do all steps in memory.\n\nFirst, I need to translate both Java functions into Fortran functions.\n\nStarting with the first part (sum function and the first program's logic):\n\nThe sum function in Java is straightforward: sum the digits of a number. In Fortran, I can write a function that takes an integer and returns the sum of its digits.\n\nFunction sum_digits(a) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a\n    integer :: res, temp, digit\n    temp = a\n    res = 0\n    do while (temp > 0)\n        digit = mod(temp, 10)\n        res = res + digit\n        temp = temp / 10\n    end do\nend function sum_digits\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is while a >=10. Wait, the original code in Java's sum function:\n\nint ans =0;\nwhile (a >=10) {\n    ans += a%10;\n    a /=10;\n}\nans +=a;\n\nSo the loop continues as long as a is two digits or more. So for a= 123, the loop runs for 123 (>=10), then 12 (>=10), then 1 (loop stops). Then add the remaining a (1). So the sum is 2+3 +1 =6.\n\nThe Fortran function I wrote above would do the same. Let me see:\n\nFor a=123:\n\ntemp starts as 123. mod(123,10)=3, add to res (res=3). temp becomes 12.\n\nNext iteration: mod(12,10)=2, res=5, temp=1.\n\nNext iteration: temp is 1, so loop stops. Then add 1 to res (total 6). So yes, same as the Java code.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nNow, the first program's main logic:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans as sum(1) + sum(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n, compute sum(A) + sum(N - A), and track the minimum.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for A from 1 to n (inclusive). The initial ans is set to sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then for each A in 1..n, if the current sum is less than ans, update ans.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing N, we need to compute n, then loop A from 1 to n, etc.\n\nNow, the second program's logic:\n\nThe second program takes K as input (which is the first program's output ans). Then:\n\nIf K is even or divisible by 5, return -1.\n\nElse, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply K by 9.\n\nThen find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod (new K) == 1 mod (new K).\n\nWait, let me recheck the Java code's solve function:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1.\n\nThen, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9.\n\nWait, so the K is first divided by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but why? Let me see the problem's logic. The problem might be related to finding the minimal length of a number consisting of all 9's divisible by K. But perhaps the code is solving a problem where K must be adjusted first.\n\nBut regardless, the code's steps are as per the code.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute first part's ans1 (the minimal digit sum).\n\nThen, set K = ans1.\n\nThen compute the second part's result based on K.\n\nNow, the second part's steps:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5: if yes, return -1.\n\nElse, check if K mod7 ==0: if yes, divide by7.\n\nMultiply K by9.\n\nThen find the minimal ans where (10^ans mod (K)) ==1 mod K.\n\nWait, the code's loop:\n\nremainder starts as 10 mod K (since remainder =10%K).\n\nThen, in each step, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nWe need to find the smallest ans where remainder becomes 1.\n\nWait, the initial ans is 1, and remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, ans is 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nThen, while remainder !=1:\n\nans increments, and remainder becomes (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans is the number of steps taken.\n\nWait, the first iteration (ans=1):\n\nremainder is 10 mod K.\n\nIf that is 1, then ans is 1.\n\nElse, ans becomes 2, remainder is (10 mod K)*10 mod K = 10^2 mod K.\n\nWait, so the remainder after ans steps is 10^ans mod K.\n\nWe need to find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod K ==1.\n\nSo the problem is to find the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, but only when K is co-prime with 10 (since if K is even or divisible by 5, it's impossible, hence return -1).\n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by 7 (if divisible by 7), then multiplied by 9, so the K here is the new K.\n\nWait, the code's steps:\n\nOriginal K is the first program's output (ans1).\n\nThen, in solve:\n\nif K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nElse, if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7.\n\nThen K *=9.\n\nWait, so the new K is (K /7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires this transformation. Anyway, the code is as written, so we need to follow it.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the second part would be:\n\nRead K (from first part's ans1).\n\nCheck if mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5)==0 \u2192 if yes, result is -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 then K = K/7\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nthen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1 mod K.\n\nWait, but in code, after K *=9, the remainder is 10 mod (new K), and so on.\n\nWait, let me retrace the code's steps:\n\nAfter K is divided by7 (if applicable), then multiplied by9.\n\nSo the new K is (original K divided by7 if divisible by7) multiplied by9.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nOriginal K is the first program's output.\n\nThen:\n\nif (K mod7 ==0) \u2192 K = K/7.\n\nThen K = K *9.\n\nSo the new K is (K /7)*9 if divisible by7, else K*9.\n\nWait, but in code, the code does:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9;\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, after checking for even or 5, we do:\n\nif (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nThen proceed to compute the minimal ans.\n\nNow, the loop for finding ans:\n\nInitialize ans =1, remainder = mod(10, K)\n\nthen loop while remainder /=1:\n\nans = ans +1\n\nremainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nuntil remainder is 1.\n\nWait, but in code, the remainder is computed as (remainder *10) mod K each time.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\nans =1\n\nremainder = mod(10, K)\n\ndo while (remainder /=1)\n\n   ans = ans +1\n\n   remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nend do\n\nBut what if this loop never terminates? Well, according to the problem's constraints, perhaps K is such that it's co-prime with 10 (since we already checked that K is not divisible by 2 or 5). So the multiplicative order exists, so the loop will terminate.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (ans1).\n\n3. Use ans1 as K for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's answer (ans2).\n\n5. Print ans2.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the functions:\n\nWe need a function to compute the digit sum (sum_digits).\n\nThen, the first part's logic.\n\nThen, the second part's logic.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans1 as sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\nif current_sum < ans1 \u2192 update ans1.\n\nAfter the loop, ans1 is the minimal sum.\n\nThen, proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nSet K = ans1.\n\nCheck if mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0 \u2192 if yes, then the result is -1.\n\nElse:\n\nif mod(K,7) ==0 \u2192 K = K /7\n\nthen K = K *9\n\nthen compute the minimal ans2.\n\nWait, but in code, after K is divided by7 (if applicable), then multiplied by9.\n\nThen compute the loop.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, ans1, K, ans2, remainder, temp_K, A, n\n\n! Read N from input\n\nread(*,*) N\n\n! Compute first part's ans1\n\nn = N/2\n\nif (mod(N,2) /=0) then\n\n   n = (N+1)/2\n\nend if\n\nans1 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\ndo A =1, n\n\n   integer :: current_sum\n\n   current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans1) then\n\n      ans1 = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now compute second part using ans1 as K\n\nK = ans1\n\n! Check if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 if yes, ans2 is -1\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n   ans2 = -1\n\nelse\n\n   ! Check if divisible by7\n\n   if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n      K = K /7\n\n   end if\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   ! Now compute the minimal ans2\n\n   ans2 =1\n\n   remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n   do while (remainder /=1)\n\n      ans2 = ans2 +1\n\n      remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\n! Output ans2\n\nprint *, ans2\n\ncontains\n\ninteger function sum_digits(a)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: temp, digit, res\n\nres =0\n\ntemp = a\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   digit = mod(temp,10)\n\n   res = res + digit\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nsum_digits = res\n\nend function sum_digits\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but let me check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, in the first part's loop, the loop variable A is declared inside the loop? In Fortran, the loop variable is local to the loop, so that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the loop is written as:\n\ndo A =1, n\n\n   current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans1) then\n\n      ans1 = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables declared inside the loop (like current_sum) need to be declared. Wait, in the code I wrote, current_sum is not declared. That's an error.\n\nAh right, I need to declare current_sum before the loop.\n\nSo, in the first part:\n\nAfter initializing ans1, declare current_sum as integer.\n\nWait, let me adjust:\n\nInside the first part:\n\ninteger :: current_sum\n\nans1 = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\ndo A =1, n\n\n   current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans1) then\n\n      ans1 = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, when K is divided by7, but what if K is 0? But since the first part's ans1 is a sum of digits, which is at least 1 (since N is at least 1?), so K can't be zero here.\n\nWait, the first program's input N is read from user. So N can be 0? Well, the problem might assume N is a positive integer, but in code, if N is 0, then the first program's code would have N-1 = -1, but sum_digits would process it as absolute? Wait, no, in the Java code, the sum function takes a as input. If a is negative, then mod and division would be different. Wait, but in the first program, N is read as an integer, but the problem likely expects N to be a positive integer. So perhaps the code is designed for N >=1.\n\nAssuming that, the K will be at least 1.\n\nAnother point: in the second part, after K is divided by7 (if divisible by7), then multiplied by9. So K could become zero? Only if original K was 0, but that's not possible here.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nLet me think of a test case.\n\nSuppose N=2 (even).\n\nFirst program:\n\nn =2/2=1.\n\nans1 starts as sum(1) + sum(1) \u2192 1+1=2.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 1:\n\nA=1: sum(1) + sum(1) \u2192 2, which is same as current ans1. So no change.\n\nThus ans1 is 2.\n\nSecond part: K=2.\n\nCheck if K is even \u2192 yes. So return -1.\n\nThus the final output is -1.\n\nAnother test case: N=3 (odd).\n\nFirst program:\n\nn=(3+1)/2=2.\n\nans1 starts as sum(1)+sum(2) \u21921+2=3.\n\nLoop A from 1 to 2:\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(2) \u21923 \u2192 same as ans1.\n\nA=2: sum(2)+sum(1) \u2192 same as 3. So ans1 remains 3.\n\nThus K=3.\n\nSecond part:\n\nCheck if 3 is even or divisible by5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck if divisible by7 \u2192 no.\n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 K=27.\n\nNow find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod27 ==1.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nans=1 \u219210 mod27=10 \u2192 not 1.\n\nans=2 \u2192100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u219219.\n\nans=3 \u2192190 mod27 \u2192 190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 yes. So ans is 3.\n\nThus the output is 3.\n\nSo the code should output 3 for N=3.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nIn the second part:\n\nK=3 \u2192 not divisible by7 \u2192 K remains 3, then multiplied by9 \u219227.\n\nThen:\n\nans2 starts at 1, remainder=10 mod27=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nremainder !=1 \u2192 ans becomes 2, remainder=10*10 mod27 \u2192100 mod27=19.\n\nAgain, remainder !=1 \u2192 ans=3, remainder=19*10 mod27 \u2192190 mod27 is 190-7*27=1 \u2192 yes. So loop exits. ans2 is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case for second part:\n\nSuppose K=7 (from first part's output).\n\nThen in second part:\n\nCheck even or 5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 yes. So K becomes 1 (7/7=1). Then multiply by9 \u21929.\n\nNow find ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1 mod9.\n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1. So ans is 1.\n\nThus the output is 1.\n\nSo code should return 1 for K=7.\n\nThus, if first part's ans1 is7, then second part's output is1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, the variables are declared properly.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when N is 1.\n\nN=1:\n\nn=(1+1)/2=1.\n\nans1 starts as sum(1) + sum(0). Wait, sum(0) would be 0?\n\nWait, the sum function in Java for a=0:\n\nsum(0) would be 0 (since the loop doesn't run, and then add a (0). So yes.\n\nThus sum(1) + sum(0) \u21921+0=1.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 1:\n\nA=1 \u2192 sum(1) + sum(0) \u2192 same as 1. So ans1 remains 1.\n\nThus K=1.\n\nSecond part:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 no.\n\nMultiply by9 \u21929.\n\nThen find ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1 mod9.\n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1. So ans is1.\n\nThus output is1.\n\nSo code should work.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the function sum_digits is correctly handling a=0?\n\nYes, because temp starts as 0, the loop doesn't run, and res is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible edge case: N=9.\n\nFirst program:\n\nn=4 (since 9 is odd, (9+1)/2=5? Wait wait, 9 is odd, so (9+1)/2 is 5. Wait, 9/2 is 4.5 \u2192 integer division would be 4, but (9+1)/2 is 5.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nFor N=9 (odd):\n\nn = (9+1)/2 =5.\n\nans1 starts as sum(1) + sum(8) \u21921 +8=9.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to5:\n\nCheck each A from 1 to5.\n\nFor example, A=9- A=9-5=4 \u2192 sum(5) + sum(4) \u21925+4=9.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better split.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking for the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A.\n\nFor N=9, possible A's:\n\nA=4 \u2192 sum(4)=4, N-A=5 \u2192 sum(5)=5 \u2192 total 9.\n\nA=5 \u2192 sum(5)+4 \u2192 same.\n\nA=3 \u21923+6 \u21929.\n\nA=2 \u21922+7 \u21929.\n\nA=1 \u21921+8 \u21929.\n\nA=9 \u2192 but n is 5, so A only up to5.\n\nWait, so all A's up to5 give sum 9. So the minimal is 9. So ans1 is9.\n\nThus K=9.\n\nSecond part:\n\nCheck if 9 is even or divisible by5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 no.\n\nMultiply by9 \u219281.\n\nNow find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod81 ==1 mod81.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n10 mod81 =10 \u2192 ans=1 \u2192 remainder 10.\n\nans=2 \u2192100 mod81 \u219219.\n\nans=3 \u2192190 mod81 \u2192 190-2*81=190-162=28.\n\nans=4 \u2192280 mod81 \u2192 280-3*81=280-243=37.\n\nans=5 \u2192370 mod81 \u2192 370-4*81=370-324=46.\n\nans=6 \u2192460 mod81 \u2192460-5*81=460-405=55.\n\nans=7 \u2192550 mod81 \u2192550-6*81=550-486=64.\n\nans=8 \u2192640 mod81 \u2192640-7*81=640-567=73.\n\nans=9 \u2192730 mod81 \u2192730-9*81=730-729=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus ans is9.\n\nSo the output is9.\n\nThus the code should return9 for N=9.\n\nNow, in the code:\n\nK=9 \u2192 not divisible by7 \u2192 K becomes 9*9=81.\n\nThen the loop:\n\nans2 starts at1, remainder=10 mod81=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nans2 increments until remainder becomes1.\n\nAfter 9 steps, it reaches 1. So the code should return9.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should be as written, with the corrections for variable declarations.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, the current_sum was not declared. Let me correct that.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, ans1, K, ans2, remainder, temp_K, A, n\n\ninteger :: current_sum ! declare here?\n\nWait, no, better to declare inside the first part's loop.\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nAfter reading N and computing n, we need to declare current_sum.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So inside the first part:\n\nAfter initializing ans1, declare current_sum as integer.\n\nWait, but in the code structure, variables must be declared at the beginning of the program or in a block.\n\nAlternatively, inside the program, before the loop:\n\ninteger :: current_sum\n\nBut let me structure the code properly.\n\nThe full code would be:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, ans1, K, ans2, remainder, A, n\n\ninteger :: current_sum\n\n! Read N from input\n\nread(*,*) N\n\n!

Now compute second part using ans1 as K\n\nK = ans1\n\n! Check if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 if yes, ans2 is -1\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n   ans2 = -1\n\nelse\n\n   ! Check if divisible by7\n\n   if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n      K = K /7\n\n   end if\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   ! Now compute the minimal ans2\n\n   ans2 =1\n\n   remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n   do while (remainder /=1)\n\n      ans2 = ans2 +1\n\n      remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\n! Output ans2\n\nprint *, ans2\n\ncontains\n\ninteger function sum_digits(a)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: temp, digit, res\n\nres =0\n\ntemp = a\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   digit = mod(temp,10)\n\n   res = res + digit\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nsum_digits = res\n\nend function sum_digits\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the first part, the variable current_sum is declared as an integer in the main program's variables. That's okay.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when N is 1, N-1 is 0, which is handled correctly by sum_digits(0) returning 0.\n\nAnother check: when K is 7 (from first part's ans1=7).\n\nSecond part:\n\nCheck even or 5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 yes \u2192 K becomes 1.\n\nMultiply by9 \u21929.\n\nThen compute ans2:\n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is1. So ans2 is1.\n\nThus code returns1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case where K is 21 (divisible by7).\n\nSuppose first part's ans1 is21.\n\nThen in second part:\n\nCheck even or5 \u2192 no.\n\nDivide by7 \u219221/7=3 \u2192 K=3.\n\nMultiply by9 \u219227.\n\nThen the same as earlier example with K=27, which gives ans2=3.\n\nThus code works.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
