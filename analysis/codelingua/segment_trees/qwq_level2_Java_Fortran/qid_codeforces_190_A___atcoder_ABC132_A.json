Let me break down each step. First program's logic:\n\nThe first program's output is two integers separated by a space. Let's see the conditions:\n\n- If n is 0:\n   - If m is also 0, output \"0 0\".\n   - Else, output \"Impossible\".\n- Else if m <= n:\n   - If m is 0, set m to 1 (since m can't be 0 here?

So the first program's first number must be a four-character string (like \"1122\") for the second program to output \"Yes\". So the first program's first number must be a four-digit number, but that's possible only if n is between 1000 and 9999. But the first program's first number is either n or m, depending on the conditions. Wait, let's see the first program's output:\n\nThe first number in the output is either n (when m <=n) or m (when m>n). So for the first number to be four digits, either n or m must be four digits.",

Another thing to note: in the first part's computation when m is set to 1 (when m is 0 and m <=n), the code in Java does m =1, but in the Fortran code, the original m is modified. Wait, in the Java code, the m variable is modified only in the case when m is 0 and m <=n. Let me check: In the first Java program's code:\n\nif (m <=n) {\n\n   if (m ==0) {\n\n      m =1;\n\n   }\n\n   System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, the code modifies m (the input variable) when m is 0. But in Fortran, variables are passed by value, but in this case, since it's a local variable, changing m is okay. Wait, in the Fortran code, the code is:\n\nif (m ==0) then\n\n   m =1\n\nend if\n\na =n\n\nb = m +n -1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the original m is modified. So in Fortran, the code correctly does that.",

So the output is n and n. So the first token is the string representation of n, which is the same as the second number. So for example, if n is 5, then the first token is \"5\", so the second program's s is \"5\", which has length 1 \u2192 output \"No\". Another test case: n=2, m=0 \u2192 m is set to 1. So output is 2 and (1+2-1)=2. So first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\". Another case where n=2, m=1 \u2192 m <=n. m is not zero, so output is 2 and (1+2-1)=2 \u2192 first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\". Another case where n=2, m=2 \u2192 output is 2 and (2+2-1)=3 \u2192 first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\". Wait, but if n=2 and m=1, then the first part's output is \"2 2\".",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_190_A) takes two integers n and m as input. Depending on their values, it outputs different results. The second program (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice, and outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input for the second. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (n and m), process them through the first logic, then pass the result to the second logic without any I/O in between, and finally output the final result.\n\nLet me break down each step.\n\nFirst program's logic:\n\nThe first program's output is two integers separated by a space. Let's see the conditions:\n\n- If n is 0:\n   - If m is also 0, output \"0 0\".\n   - Else, output \"Impossible\".\n- Else if m <= n:\n   - If m is 0, set m to 1 (since m can't be 0 here? Wait, the code says if m ==0 then set m=1. Wait, but in the condition m <=n, but n is not 0 here. So if m is 0, then m becomes 1. Then output n and (m +n -1). Wait, but m was set to 1, so the second number is 1 +n -1 = n. So output n and n?\n   - So for example, if m is 0, then output n and n.\n   - If m is non-zero and <=n, then output n and (m +n -1). Wait, like if m is 2 and n is 5, then 2+5-1=6, so output 5 6?\n- Else (m >n), then output m and (m +n -1). So for example, m=6 and n=5, output 6 and 11?\n\nWait, let me recheck the code:\n\nIn the first program:\n\nIf n is 0, then check m. If m is not 0, output impossible. Else 0 0.\n\nElse if m <=n:\n\n   if m ==0, set m to 1. Then print n and (m +n -1). Wait, but m can be 0 here? Because m <=n and n is not zero. So m can be 0 here. So in that case, m becomes 1, so the second number is 1 +n -1 = n. So the output is n n.\n\nElse (m >n), then output m and (m +n -1).\n\nSo the first program's output is two integers. The second program takes a string, which in the original setup would be the two numbers from the first program's output, but as a string. Wait, no. Wait, the second Java program reads a string via in.next(), which is the next token. But in the original setup, the first program's output is two integers, so the second program would read that as a string? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is two numbers separated by a space, so when the second program runs, it reads the entire line as a string? Or does it read the first token as the string?\n\nWait, the second Java program's first line is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nSo in.next() reads the next token, which would be the first number from the first program's output. But that's a problem because the first program outputs two numbers, so the second program would read the first number as the string, not the entire line. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user is saying that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is two numbers, which are then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. So perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, which are then passed as a single string to the second program. For example, if the first program outputs \"5 6\", then the second program reads \"5 6\" as the string s. But in the second Java program, in.next() would read \"5\" as the first token, then the next would be \"6\", but since the code only reads in.next() once, the string s would be \"5\", and the rest is ignored. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the first program's output is two numbers, and the second program is supposed to read that entire line as a string. But in Java, in.next() reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So if the first program outputs \"5 6\", then the second program's in.next() would read \"5\" as the first token, and the rest is not read. That would be a problem. Wait, perhaps the second program is expecting a string that is exactly two characters? Because the second program checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. Wait, the second program's code is checking for exactly two different characters each appearing twice, so the string must be of length 4. For example, \"aabb\" would be yes, \"abba\" yes, but \"abc\" would be no. So the first program's output must be a four-character string? But the first program outputs two numbers, which when printed as a space-separated string would be two numbers, possibly with a space. For example, if the first program outputs \"12 34\", that's six characters (including space). Then the second program would read that as a string, but the length is 5 (assuming numbers like 12 and 34, so \"12 34\" is 5 characters). Then the second program would check if each character appears exactly twice. But that's not possible unless the numbers are such that the digits and space form exactly two characters each appearing twice. That seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is two numbers, which are then concatenated into a string without a space? Like if the first program outputs \"5 6\", then the second program would read \"56\" as the string? But that's not how the first program is written. The first program's print statements are like System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1)), so the output includes a space between the two numbers. So the second program would read the first token (the first number) as the string, but that's not a four-character string. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the original setup might have a mistake, but the user says to translate the sequence as given. Maybe the second program is supposed to read the entire line as a string, including the space. But in Java, in.next() would split on whitespace, so the first token is the first number, and the second is the second number. But the code for the second program only reads in.next() once, so s would be the first number. That would not make sense. Wait, perhaps the second program is expecting a four-character string, so the first program's output must be exactly four characters. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234\" (without space), then the second program can process it. But according to the first program's code, when it outputs two numbers, they are separated by a space. So maybe the first program's output is two numbers, but when passed to the second program, they are treated as a single string (including the space). So the second program's input is the entire line from the first program's output. So in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which would read the first token (the first number), but that's not the entire string. Wait, perhaps the second program should read the entire line as a string. To do that in Java, you need to use in.nextLine(). But the code uses in.next(), which is different. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the second program is written incorrectly, but the user provided it as is, so I have to follow it. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is two numbers without a space? Let me check the first program's code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's print statements:\n\nIn the first case, when n=0 and m=0, it outputs \"0 0\".\n\nIn the else if (m <=n) case, it does System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1)); So yes, there's a space between the two numbers.\n\nSo the output is two numbers separated by a space. So the second program's input is that entire line. But in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which would split on whitespace, so the first token is the first number, and the second is the second number. But the code only reads the first token into s. So s would be the first number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5 6\", then s is \"5\", which is length 1. Then the second program would check the characters in \"5\", which is only one character. So the map would have '5' with count 1. Then the check for map.size() ==2 would fail, so output \"No\". But that's probably not the intended behavior. Wait, maybe the second program is supposed to read the entire line as a single string, including the space. To do that in Java, you need to use in.nextLine(). But the code uses in.next(), which is different. So perhaps there's a mistake in the second Java program's code, but the user provided it as is, so I have to follow it. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is two numbers without a space. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first program's print statements:\n\nIn the first case, when n=0 and m=0, it outputs \"0 0\".\n\nIn the else if (m <=n) case, it does System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1)); So yes, there's a space.\n\nSo the output is two numbers separated by a space. So the second program's input is that line. But in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which would read the first number as the string. So the second program's input is the first number as a string, and the second number is ignored. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the second program is supposed to read the entire line as a string, but the code is wrong. But the user provided the code as is, so I have to translate it as per the code given. So the second program's input is the first token from the first program's output. So for example, if the first program outputs \"12 34\", then the second program's s is \"12\", which is two characters. Then the code would check if each character appears exactly twice. So for \"12\", the counts are 1 and 1, so the map would have two entries each with count 1. So the check for all counts being 2 would fail, so output \"No\". But maybe the first program's output is supposed to be a four-character string. Hmm, perhaps the first program's output is two numbers concatenated without a space, but the code includes a space. That's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program is supposed to read them as separate numbers and then form a string from them. But the second program's code is written to read a single string. This is confusing. Maybe I need to proceed as per the code given, even if there's a possible inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to read the entire line as a string, so in the second Java program, the code should be in.nextLine() instead of in.next(). But since the user provided the code as is, I have to follow it. So the second program's input is the first token of the first program's output. So the first program's output is two numbers separated by a space, so the first token is the first number. So the second program's s is that first number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"12 34\", then s is \"12\", which is two characters. Then the second program checks if each character appears exactly twice. So for \"12\", each appears once, so the answer is \"No\". But if the first program outputs \"11 22\", then the first token is \"11\", so s is \"11\", which has two '1's. Then the map would have '1' with count 2. The map size is 1, so the check for size 2 would fail, so output \"No\". Hmm, maybe the first program's output is supposed to be a four-character string. Let me think of possible scenarios where the second program would output \"Yes\".\n\nSuppose the first program outputs \"1122\", then the second program's s is \"1122\", which has two characters each appearing twice. So the output would be \"Yes\". But how would the first program produce that? Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=11, m=2. Then m <=n (2 <=11). Since m is not 0, so the output is 11 and (2+11-1)=12. So the output is \"11 12\", which is five characters (including space). So the second program's s would be \"11\", which is two characters. Then the counts are two '1's, so the map has one entry with count 2. The size is 1, so the output is \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, if the first program outputs \"1212\", then the second program would process that. But how would the first program get there? Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=12, m=1. Then m <=n. Since m is 1, not zero, so output is 12 and (1+12-1)=12. So the output is \"12 12\", which is five characters. The first token is \"12\", so s is \"12\", which has two characters each once. So output \"No\".\n\nHmm, maybe the first program's output is two numbers that when concatenated (without space) form a four-character string with two pairs. For example, if the first program outputs \"1122\" (without space), then the second program would process it. But according to the first program's code, the output includes a space. So that's conflicting. Maybe the first program's output is two numbers without a space. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first program's print statements:\n\nIn the first case (n=0 and m=0), it outputs \"0 0\".\n\nIn the else if (m <=n) case, it does System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1)); So yes, there's a space.\n\nSo the output includes a space. Therefore, the second program's input is the first token (the first number as a string). So the second program's processing is based on that first number's string representation. For example, if the first program outputs \"1234 5678\", then the second program's s is \"1234\", which is four characters. Then the code would check if each character appears exactly twice. For \"1234\", each appears once, so output \"No\". But if the first number is \"1122\", then the s is \"1122\", which has two '1's and two '2's. So the map would have two entries each with count 2, and the size is 2. So the output would be \"Yes\".\n\nSo the first program's first number must be a four-character string (like \"1122\") for the second program to output \"Yes\". So the first program's first number must be a four-digit number, but that's possible only if n is between 1000 and 9999. But the first program's first number is either n or m, depending on the conditions.\n\nWait, let's see the first program's output:\n\nThe first number in the output is either n (when m <=n) or m (when m>n). So for the first number to be four digits, either n or m must be four digits. For example, if n is 1122 and m is 1, then the first number is 1122, so the second program's s is \"1122\", which would pass the check. So the second program would output \"Yes\".\n\nSo the key is that the first program's first number (the first token of its output) must be a four-character string with exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. The second program then outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on that.\n\nNow, the task is to translate both programs into a single Fortran program. The first part (Java's first program) must compute the two numbers, then pass them to the second part (Java's second program's logic) which processes the first number as a string and outputs the result.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (two numbers a and b, where a is either n or m, and b is a + (other value) -1, etc. as per the first program's logic).\n\n3. Then, take the first number (a) from the first program's output, convert it to a string, and process it according to the second program's logic (count characters, check counts).\n\n4. Output the final result (\"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Impossible\" or \"0 0\").\n\nWait, but the second program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", except when the first program outputs \"Impossible\" or \"0 0\". Wait, the first program can output \"Impossible\", \"0 0\", or two numbers. So the second program's input is only when the first program outputs two numbers. Because if the first program outputs \"Impossible\", then the second program's input would be \"Impossible\", but according to the second program's code, it would read the first token as \"Impossible\", which is a string of length 9. Then the check would fail (since the counts would not be 2 for each character, and the size would be more than 2). But according to the problem's setup, the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the case where the first program outputs \"Impossible\", the second program would process that string, but according to its code, it would output \"No\" (since the string has more than two distinct characters, or counts not 2). But the user wants the Fortran program to behave exactly like the original sequence. So in the case where the first program outputs \"Impossible\", the second program would process that string and output \"No\". But according to the original setup, the second program would receive \"Impossible\" as input, so its output would be \"No\". So the Fortran program must handle that.\n\nWait, but the first program's output can be \"Impossible\", \"0 0\", or two numbers. The second program's code will process whatever the first outputs. So in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's output, we need to pass that to the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Compute the first program's output (two numbers or \"Impossible\" or \"0 0\").\n\n- Then, process that output as the input to the second program's logic.\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can't have strings like \"Impossible\" unless we handle them. Let me think of the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: First program outputs \"Impossible\".\n\nThen, the second program's input is \"Impossible\". The second program's code would process this string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is \"Impossible\". The characters are I, m, p, o, s, s, i, b, l, e. So there are multiple characters, each appearing once except 's' (twice?), let's see:\n\nLetters:\n\nI (1), m (1), p (1), o (1), s (2), i (1), b (1), l (1), e (1). So the counts are:\n\n's' appears twice, others once. So the map would have entries with counts 1 except 's' has 2. The map size is 9 (since 9 unique characters). So the check for all counts being 2 and size 2 would fail. So the second program outputs \"No\".\n\nSo the final output would be \"No\".\n\nCase 2: First program outputs \"0 0\".\n\nThen the second program's input is \"0\" (since in.next() takes the first token). The string is \"0\", length 1. So the map has '0' with count 1. The size is 1. So the second program outputs \"No\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is \"0 0\", so the first token is \"0\", so the second program's s is \"0\". Then the check would be: map has one entry (count 1), so output \"No\".\n\nCase 3: First program outputs two numbers, say \"a b\".\n\nThe second program's input is the first token, which is the string representation of a. So the second program processes that string.\n\nSo in the Fortran program, after computing a and b (the two numbers from the first program's output), we need to process the string representation of a (without the space and b) through the second program's logic.\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the two numbers are separated by a space. So the second program's input is the first number as a string. So in Fortran, after computing a (the first number), we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (a and b, or \"Impossible\" or \"0 0\").\n\n   - If n ==0:\n\n      - if m !=0 \u2192 output \"Impossible\".\n\n      - else \u2192 output \"0 0\".\n\n   - else:\n\n      if m <=n:\n\n          if m ==0 \u2192 set m to 1.\n\n          a = n\n\n          b = m +n -1\n\n      else:\n\n          a = m\n\n          b = m +n -1\n\n      output a and b.\n\n3. Now, the second program's input is the first part's output. But in Fortran, we can't have strings like \"Impossible\" unless we handle them. So we need to handle all cases:\n\n   - If the first part's output is \"Impossible\", then the second part's input is \"Impossible\".\n\n   - If it's \"0 0\", then the input is \"0\".\n\n   - Else, the input is the string representation of a (the first number).\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to handle these cases:\n\nFirst, compute the first part's result. Let's represent the first part's output as a string. Let's call it first_output.\n\nThen, process first_output through the second program's logic.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling strings can be a bit tricky. Let's think of variables:\n\nWe can have variables for the first part's output. Let's see:\n\nFirst, compute the first part's result:\n\nWe can have variables a and b, and a flag for whether it's \"Impossible\" or \"0 0\".\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: n, m, a, b\n\nlogical :: is_impossible, is_zero_zero\n\nThen:\n\nif (n ==0) then\n\n   if (m /=0) then\n\n      is_impossible = .true.\n\n   else\n\n      is_zero_zero = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nelse\n\n   if (m <=n) then\n\n      if (m ==0) then\n\n         m =1\n\n      end if\n\n      a = n\n\n      b = m +n -1\n\n   else\n\n      a = m\n\n      b = m +n -1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the case where n is not zero, but m is zero and m <=n, then m is set to 1. So the code for the first part's logic must be correctly translated.\n\nOnce the first part's result is determined, we need to create the first_output string.\n\nSo:\n\nif (is_impossible) then\n\n   first_output = \"Impossible\"\n\nelse if (is_zero_zero) then\n\n   first_output = \"0 0\"\n\nelse\n\n   first_output = trim(adjustl(str(a))) // \" \" // trim(adjustl(str(b)))\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting integers to strings can be done with internal writes or using functions. Since Fortran 2003 has the 'str' function, but maybe better to use write statements.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a character variable to hold the first_output.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to handle the cases:\n\nCase 1: is_impossible \u2192 first_output is \"Impossible\".\n\nCase 2: is_zero_zero \u2192 first_output is \"0 0\".\n\nCase 3: else \u2192 first_output is the two numbers separated by a space.\n\nThen, the second part's input is the first token of first_output. So the second program's input is the first part of the first_output string.\n\nSo to get the first token (the first number as a string), we can split the first_output string into tokens. But in Fortran, splitting strings can be done with scan and substring functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the first part's output is either \"Impossible\", \"0 0\", or \"a b\", we can process the first token as follows:\n\nIf first_output is \"Impossible\", then the input string is \"Impossible\".\n\nIf it's \"0 0\", then the first token is \"0\".\n\nElse, the first token is the string representation of a (the first number).\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can create a variable s which is the first token.\n\nSo:\n\nif (is_impossible) then\n\n   s = \"Impossible\"\n\nelse if (is_zero_zero) then\n\n   s = \"0\"\n\nelse\n\n   s = trim(adjustl(str(a)))  ! assuming a is the first number.\n\nend if\n\nWait, but how to get the string representation of a?\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_a\n\nwrite(s_a, '(i0)') a\n\ns_a = adjustl(s_a)\n\nThen s would be s_a.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, compute a and b, and the flags.\n\nThen, construct s as the first token.\n\nThen, process s through the second program's logic.\n\nNow, the second program's logic is:\n\nCheck if the string s has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\n- Count the frequency of each character in s.\n\n- Check if all counts are 2 and the number of distinct characters is 2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can use an array to count the characters. Since characters can be uppercase or lowercase? The second Java program uses characters, but in the code, it's case-sensitive. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe code uses a HashMap<Character, Integer>, so it's case-sensitive. So in Fortran, we need to treat characters as case-sensitive.\n\nSo in the second part:\n\nInitialize a count array for all possible characters. But since the input is a string, perhaps we can loop through each character and count.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible characters are limited (assuming the input is digits and space?), but in the case of \"Impossible\", it's letters.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can use a character array or a hash map-like structure. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map, perhaps we can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) to count each character's occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, since the input string s can be up to, say, 20 characters (since the first part's output can be up to large numbers, but in practice, the second part's processing is on the first token which is a number or \"Impossible\").\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize an array counts of size 256 (or 128) to zero.\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\n   counts(ichar(c)) = counts(ichar(c)) +1\n\nThen, check:\n\n- The number of non-zero entries in counts is exactly 2.\n\n- Each of those entries has a count of exactly 2.\n\nIf both conditions are met \u2192 output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: counts = 0\n\ninteger :: i, c\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nlogical :: ok\n\nok = .true.\n\n! Initialize counts to zero\n\ncounts = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   c = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n   counts(c) = counts(c) +1\n\nend do\n\n! Now check the counts\n\ninteger :: num_distinct = 0\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n      num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n      if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n         ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_distinct /=2 .or. .not. ok) then\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n   print *, \"Yes\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the check is:\n\nfor each entry in the map, if any count !=2 \u2192 ok becomes false.\n\nThen, after all entries, if ok is true and the map size is 2 \u2192 output yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code above should do that.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nCompute first part's result (a, b, and flags).\n\nConstruct s as the first token of the first_output.\n\nProcess s through the second part's logic.\n\nOutput the result.\n\nNow, handling the first part's flags:\n\nVariables:\n\nlogical :: is_impossible, is_zero_zero\n\ninteger :: a, b\n\nFirst, read n and m:\n\nread*, n, m\n\nThen compute:\n\nif (n ==0) then\n\n   if (m /=0) then\n\n      is_impossible = .true.\n\n      is_zero_zero = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      is_zero_zero = .true.\n\n      is_impossible = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nelse\n\n   is_impossible = .false.\n\n   is_zero_zero = .false.\n\n   if (m <=n) then\n\n      if (m ==0) then\n\n         m =1\n\n      end if\n\n      a = n\n\n      b = m +n -1\n\n   else\n\n      a = m\n\n      b = m +n -1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nThen, construct s:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nif (is_impossible) then\n\n   s = \"Impossible\"\n\nelse if (is_zero_zero) then\n\n   s = \"0\"\n\nelse\n\n   ! Convert a to string\n\n   character(len=20) :: a_str\n\n   write(a_str, '(i0)') a\n\n   s = trim(adjustl(a_str))\n\nend if\n\nThen process s through the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nInitialize counts array:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: counts = 0\n\nlogical :: ok\n\nok = .true.\n\ncounts = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   integer :: c = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n   counts(c) = counts(c) +1\n\nend do\n\ninteger :: num_distinct =0\n\ndo i =0,255\n\n   if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n      num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n      if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n         ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_distinct ==2 .and. ok) then\n\n   print *, \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the check is:\n\nif (ok and map.size() ==2) \u2192 yes else no.\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition is (num_distinct ==2) and ok.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nBut need to make sure that variables are properly declared.\n\nAlso, in the case where the first part's output is \"0 0\", the s is \"0\", so the processing is on \"0\".\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput n=0, m=0 \u2192 first part outputs \"0 0\". So s is \"0\".\n\nProcessing s: length 1. counts for '0' is 1. num_distinct is 1. So output \"No\".\n\nWhich matches the second program's processing.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput n=0, m=5 \u2192 first part outputs \"Impossible\". s is \"Impossible\".\n\nProcessing: the string has 9 characters. The counts for each character are mostly 1 except 's' (if any). The num_distinct is more than 2, so output \"No\".\n\nTest case 3:\n\nFirst program outputs \"1122 3344\" \u2192 s is \"1122\".\n\nProcessing s: characters '1','1','2','2'. counts for '1' is 2, '2' is 2. num_distinct is 2 \u2192 output \"Yes\".\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs \"12 34\" \u2192 s is \"12\".\n\nCharacters '1' and '2' each once \u2192 counts are 1 each. So num_distinct is 2 but counts not 2 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case where first program outputs \"11 22\" \u2192 s is \"11\".\n\nCharacters '1' twice \u2192 counts for '1' is 2. num_distinct is 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case where first program outputs \"1212 34\" \u2192 s is \"1212\".\n\nCharacters '1' and '2' each two times \u2192 counts are 2 each. num_distinct is 2 \u2192 output \"Yes\".\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, writing the Fortran code.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, a, b\n\n   logical :: is_impossible, is_zero_zero\n\n   character(len=20) :: s, a_str\n\n   integer, dimension(0:255) :: counts\n\n   logical :: ok\n\n   integer :: i, c, num_distinct\n\n   ! Read input\n\n   read*, n, m\n\n   ! Compute first part\n\n   is_impossible = .false.\n\n   is_zero_zero = .false.\n\n   if (n ==0) then\n\n      if (m /=0) then\n\n         is_impossible = .true.\n\n      else\n\n         is_zero_zero = .true.\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (m <=n) then\n\n         if (m ==0) then\n\n            m =1\n\n         end if\n\n         a = n\n\n         b = m +n -1\n\n      else\n\n         a = m\n\n         b = m +n -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Construct s\n\n   if (is_impossible) then\n\n      s = \"Impossible\"\n\n   else if (is_zero_zero) then\n\n      s = \"0\"\n\n   else\n\n      write(a_str, '(i0)') a\n\n      s = trim(adjustl(a_str))\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Process second part\n\n   counts = 0\n\n   ok = .true.\n\n   do i =1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n      counts(c) = counts(c) +1\n\n   end do\n\n   num_distinct =0\n\n   do i=0,255\n\n      if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n         num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n         if (counts(i) /=2) then\n\n            ok = .false.\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (num_distinct ==2 .and. ok) then\n\n      print *, \"Yes\"\n\n   else\n\n      print *, \"No\"\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the case where the first part's output is \"0 0\", the s is \"0\", so the processing is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first part's computation when m is set to 1 (when m is 0 and m <=n), the code in Java does m =1, but in the Fortran code, the original m is modified. Wait, in the Java code, the m variable is modified only in the case when m is 0 and m <=n. Let me check:\n\nIn the first Java program's code:\n\nif (m <=n) {\n\n   if (m ==0) {\n\n      m =1;\n\n   }\n\n   System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, the code modifies m (the input variable) when m is 0. But in Fortran, variables are passed by value, but in this case, since it's a local variable, changing m is okay. Wait, in the Fortran code, the code is:\n\nif (m ==0) then\n\n   m =1\n\nend if\n\na =n\n\nb = m +n -1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the original m is modified. So in Fortran, the code correctly does that. Because in the case where m is 0, we set m to 1, then compute b as m +n -1. So that's correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the case where n is not zero, but m is zero and m <=n, then m is set to 1, so the first number is n, and the second is 1 +n -1 =n. So the output is n and n. So the first token is the string representation of n, which is the same as the second number. So for example, if n is 5, then the first token is \"5\", so the second program's s is \"5\", which has length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=0 \u2192 m is set to 1. So output is 2 and (1+2-1)=2. So first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case where n=2, m=1 \u2192 m <=n. m is not zero, so output is 2 and (1+2-1)=2 \u2192 first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case where n=2, m=2 \u2192 output is 2 and (2+2-1)=3 \u2192 first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nWait, but if n=2 and m=1, then the first part's output is \"2 2\". The first token is \"2\", so s is \"2\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but what if the first part's output is \"11 11\" \u2192 then the first token is \"11\", so s is \"11\". The counts are two '1's \u2192 counts for '1' is 2. The number of distinct is 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nTo get \"Yes\", the first token must be a four-character string with two pairs. For example, first token is \"1122\".\n\nSo if the first part's output is \"1122 3344\", then s is \"1122\" \u2192 counts for '1' (2), '2' (2) \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the Fortran code seems correct.\n\nI think this should work."
