So m can be up to 6 digits. So a 6x13 array is manageable.

Because the previous mod was (sum_{k=0}^i d_k *10^k) mod13. Adding a new digit d_{i+1} in the 10^{i+1} place would make the new sum (sum + d_{i+1}*10^{i+1}) mod13.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_37_A). It reads an integer n, then n integers. It counts the frequency of each integer using a HashMap. Then it finds the maximum frequency and the number of unique integers. The output is the concatenation of max and the size of the map. So the output is a number like \"53\" if max is 5 and there are 3 unique numbers.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC135_D) takes a string input, which is a sequence of characters (digits or '?'). It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute some value modulo 1e9+7. The output is the value of dp[cs.length-1][5], which is the result of this DP.\n\nThe key here is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (a string like \"53\") is the input for the second program, which expects a string (the next() method in the second program's Scanner would read that as the input).\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read via Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); and then sc.next(). So the input to the second program is a single line, which is the output of the first program. So the first program's output is a string (the max plus the size), which is the input to the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the n and the list of integers), process them as per the first program, then take the result (the concatenated string of max and map size), and use that as the input to the second program's processing.\n\nBut how to structure this in Fortran? The user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the Fortran program must first read the input (as the first Java program does), process the first part (count frequencies, find max and size), then use that result as the input to the second part (the DP part), and finally output the result of the second part.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the list of integers (as the first Java program does).\n2. Compute the frequency counts, find max frequency and the number of unique elements.\n3. Combine max and size into a string (like \"53\"), which is the input for the second part.\n4. Process this string as the input for the second part (the DP problem).\n5. Output the final result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nFirst part's logic:\n\n- Read n, then n integers.\n- Count the frequency of each integer. Since Java uses a HashMap, in Fortran, we can use an array or a hash table. Since integers can be any, but in practice, the input is limited (since it's from a problem, maybe the numbers are within a certain range). But to handle any integers, perhaps we can use a hash table. However, Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash table. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the input is n integers. The problem is to count the frequency of each. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array to count frequencies, but if the integers can be negative or very large, that's not feasible. Alternatively, since the problem is from Codeforces, maybe the input numbers are within a manageable range. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints allow for using an array. Let me check the problem's constraints. Wait, the original problem (codeforces_37_A) is problem A from Codeforces Round #37. Let me recall: the problem is about counting the number of occurrences of each number in a list, then outputting the maximum count followed by the number of distinct numbers. The constraints for n are probably up to 1e5 or similar, but the numbers can be up to 1e9. So using an array is impossible. So in Fortran, how to handle this?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash table. So perhaps we can use a list of pairs (value, count), and manage it manually. For example, when reading each number, check if it's already in the list. If yes, increment count; else, add to the list. But for large n, this could be slow. However, given that the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps the constraints are manageable. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are within a certain range. Let me think: the problem's actual constraints (if I recall correctly) for codeforces_37_A: n is up to 100, so the numbers can be up to 1e9, but with n small. Wait, the problem's actual constraints: looking it up, the problem says \"n is between 1 and 100\". Oh, that's a relief. So the numbers can be up to 1e9, but since n is small (up to 100), we can handle this with a list.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the first part:\n\nWe can read all the numbers into an array. Then, create an array of structures (or two arrays: one for the values and one for counts). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since n is small, we can loop through each number and check against existing entries.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array, say, vals(1:n).\n\nInitialize a list (maybe two arrays: keys and counts). Start with empty.\n\nLoop over each val in vals:\n\n   search the keys array to see if val is present.\n\n   if found, increment the count at that index.\n\n   else, add a new entry to keys and counts.\n\nOnce all are processed, find the maximum count (max_count) and the number of keys (num_unique).\n\nThen, the output of the first part is the string formed by concatenating max_count and num_unique. So, for example, if max_count is 5 and num_unique is 3, the string is \"53\".\n\nNow, the second part of the Java program takes this string as input. The second Java program reads a single string (using sc.next()), which is the output of the first program. So in the Fortran program, the second part must process this string (the \"53\" string) as the input.\n\nThe second part's logic is a dynamic programming problem. Let me understand the second Java program's code.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string (cs) which is the input. The problem is to compute the number of ways to replace the '?' in the string with digits (0-9) such that the resulting number mod 13 is 5. The result is modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe DP approach uses a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to process the first i characters (from the end) such that the current mod is j. The base is 10^i mod 13, and each step considers the current digit (or all possible digits if it's a '?').\n\nIn Fortran, I need to implement this DP.\n\nFirst, the input for the second part is the string from the first part's output. So in the Fortran program, after processing the first part, we have the string (e.g., \"53\"), which is the input to the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nTake the string (from first part's output) as the input string.\n\nProcess it as the input string (cs) for the DP.\n\nInitialize the DP array. The DP is a 2D array of size (length of cs) x 13. Since in Java it's a long, in Fortran we can use integers modulo 1e9+7, perhaps using integer*8 (64-bit integers) to avoid overflow.\n\nThe base starts at 1, and for each character (processed from the end), we compute the next base as (base * 10) mod 13.\n\nThe DP transitions depend on whether the current character is '?' or a digit.\n\nLet me think of the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string (from first part's output) as a character array.\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp of size (len(cs)) x 13. Since in Fortran arrays are 1-based, but in Java they are 0-based. Need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to cs.length-1. The characters are processed in reverse order (cs.length -1 -i). So in Fortran, perhaps we can process the string from the end, but the indices need to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n   current character is cs[cs.length -1 -i]\n\nSo for i=0, it's the first character (the last character of the original string), then i=1 is the second character from the end, etc.\n\nIn Fortran, let's suppose the string is stored as a character array of length m (m = len_trim(input_str)), then the characters are from 1 to m. So for the first character (the last character of the original string), we can process from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the string first so that we can process it in order.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's process the string in reverse order. Let me think:\n\nLet me denote the input string as s, of length m.\n\nWe need to process each character starting from the last character (position m) down to the first (position 1). So for each position i from 1 to m (in the original string), the first step processes the m-th character (i=0 in Java's code corresponds to the last character).\n\nWait, perhaps the Fortran code can process the string in reverse order. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, for each i from 0 to m-1 (where m is the length of the string), the current character is at position (m-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character (position m-1 in 0-based), which is the first character in the reversed string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps it's easier to reverse the string first, so that we can process each character in order.\n\nAlternatively, process the original string in reverse order.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the input string for the second part is the output of the first part, which is a string like \"53\".\n\nWe need to process each character in this string, treating each as a character (digit or '?'). The DP is built as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] = 1 (since initially, before any digits, the mod is 0).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the DP is initialized as follows:\n\nThe dp array is initialized to 0. For each step i (from 0 to m-1), the current character is the (m-1 -i)th character of the original string. The DP for step i depends on the previous step (i-1).\n\nWait, the Java code's DP is a 2D array where dp[i][pre] represents the number of ways up to the i-th step (processing the first i+1 characters from the end). The base is 10^i mod 13.\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP is built as follows:\n\nThe base starts at 1 (10^0 mod 13 is 1). For each step i (processing the next character from the end), the base is multiplied by 10 mod 13 each time.\n\nThe DP transitions:\n\nFor each position i (from 0 to m-1):\n\n   current character is c = s[m-1 -i]\n\n   if c is '?', then for each possible digit (0-9), we can choose it, and update the DP.\n\n   else, the digit is fixed.\n\n   For each possible previous mod value (pre from 0 to 12):\n\n      the new digit is d (either 0-9 or fixed)\n\n      new_mod = (pre + d * base) mod 13 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is (pre * 10 + d) mod 13? Or maybe the other way around.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code's DP step:\n\nIn the Java code, for each next (digit):\n\n   new_mod = (base * next + pre) % 13\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += ... \n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i > 0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ? 1 :0))\n\nWait, the formula is (base * next + pre) mod 13.\n\nHmm, the base is 10^i mod 13. Because in the code, base starts at 1 (10^0 mod13), and each step multiplies by 10 mod13. So after i steps, base is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, the code's base is updated as base = base *10 %13 at the end of each iteration. So after processing i steps (the loop runs for i from 0 to m-1), the base after the loop is 10^(i+1) mod13.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nInitially, base is 1 (before the loop starts).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to m-1:\n\n   process the character (the (m-1 -i)th character)\n\n   then, after processing, base is multiplied by 10 mod13.\n\nSo after the first iteration (i=0), base becomes 10^1 mod13.\n\nAfter i=1, it's 10^2 mod13, etc.\n\nSo the base for step i is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, the base is used in the calculation for the current step's transitions.\n\nThe formula for the new mod is (base * next + pre) mod13?\n\nWait, the code's line is:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += ... \n\nWait, the next is the digit (0-9). The base is 10^i mod13.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the DP is structured is that each digit is multiplied by 10^i and added to the previous mod. Because the digits are being processed from the least significant digit (since we're going from the end of the string). So the first digit processed (the last digit of the original string) is the units place, then the next is tens, etc. So each digit contributes digit * 10^i, where i is the step (starting from 0 for the first digit).\n\nWait, the total number mod13 is (d0 * 10^0 + d1 *10^1 + ... + dk *10^k) mod13.\n\nSo when processing the digits in reverse order (starting from the last digit), each step i corresponds to the digit at position (original length -1 -i), which is the 10^i place.\n\nTherefore, the DP[i][new_mod] represents the number of ways to process the first (i+1) digits (from the end) such that the total mod13 is new_mod.\n\nThe transition is:\n\nFor each previous mod pre (from 0 to 12):\n\n   for each possible digit d (0-9 or fixed if not '?'):\n\n      new_mod = (pre + d * (10^i mod13)) mod13 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current digit is the (i)th step's digit (the 10^i place). So the contribution of this digit is d * 10^i. So the total mod is (previous_mod *10 + d) mod13 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have processed the first i digits (from the end), and the current mod is pre. Now, we process the next digit (the (i+1)th digit from the end, which is the 10^{i+1} place). Let's say the digit is d. Then the new mod would be (pre *10 + d) mod13.\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because the previous mod was (sum_{k=0}^i d_k *10^k) mod13. Adding a new digit d_{i+1} in the 10^{i+1} place would make the new sum (sum + d_{i+1}*10^{i+1}) mod13. Which can be written as ( (sum)*10 + d_{i+1} ) mod13.\n\nTherefore, the transition is new_mod = (pre *10 + d) mod13.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the formula is (base * next + pre) mod13. Let me see:\n\nbase is 10^i mod13 (since after processing i steps, base is 10^i mod13, because initially base is 1 (10^0), then after each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod13. So after i steps, base is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, in the code, the base is updated after processing the current step. Let me see:\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n\n   ... process the current character (the (cs.length-1 -i)th character)\n\n   then, after processing, base = base *10 %13;\n\n}\n\nSo for the first iteration (i=0), the base is 1 (initial value). After processing, base becomes 10 mod13.\n\nSo during the processing of step i, the base is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, the formula in the code is (base * next + pre) mod13. Hmm, that would be (10^i * next + pre) mod13. That doesn't align with the previous reasoning.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the transition formula.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose we have processed the first i digits (from the end), and the current mod is pre. Now, the next digit (the (i+1)th digit from the end) is d. The contribution of this digit is d * 10^{i+1} mod13. So the new mod is (pre + d * 10^{i+1}) mod13.\n\nAlternatively, the previous mod was (sum_{k=0}^i d_k *10^k) mod13. Adding the new digit d_{i+1} gives sum_{k=0}^{i+1} d_k *10^k mod13 = (pre + d_{i+1}*10^{i+1}) mod13.\n\nBut 10^{i+1} = 10 * 10^i. So 10^{i+1} mod13 = (10 * (10^i mod13)) mod13.\n\nBut in the code's formula, the new_mod is (base * next + pre) mod13. Since base is 10^i mod13, then base * next is next *10^i mod13. Adding pre (which is the previous mod) gives (next *10^i + pre) mod13. But that's not the same as the desired (pre + d *10^{i+1}) mod13.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's logic. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the code's DP is structured such that the current step i corresponds to processing the (i+1)th digit from the end. Wait, maybe the indices are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's DP is structured in a way that the base is 10^i mod13, and the new_mod is (pre + next * base) mod13. Because base is 10^i mod13, so next * base is next *10^i mod13. Adding that to pre (the previous mod) gives the new mod.\n\nWait, but the previous mod was the sum up to the previous digits. Adding next *10^i would be the contribution of the new digit (since it's the next digit in the sequence, which is the 10^i place). So the total mod would be (pre + next *10^i) mod13.\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because the new digit is in the 10^i place (since we're processing from the end). So the contribution of the new digit is next *10^i mod13, added to the previous mod.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct as per the code: new_mod = (pre + next * base) mod13, where base is 10^i mod13.\n\nWait, but in the code's line, it's written as (base * next + pre) mod13. Which is the same as (pre + base * next) mod13. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the DP transitions are:\n\nFor each previous mod pre (0..12):\n\n   for each possible digit next (0-9 or fixed):\n\n      new_mod = (pre + base * next) mod13\n\n      dp[i][new_mod] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\n      (with the initial condition for i=0, when i-1 is -1, so the previous is 1 if pre is 0, else 0)\n\nWait, the code's initial condition is that for i=0 (the first step), when i>0 is false, so the term is (pre ==0 ? 1 :0). So for the first step (i=0), the previous is 0 (since i-1 is -1), so the contribution is 1 if pre was 0 (the initial state before any digits).\n\nWait, the initial state is that before any digits, the mod is 0. So for the first digit, the previous mod is 0, and the contribution is 1 (the count starts at 1 for that path).\n\nTherefore, the DP transitions are correctly handled in the code.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the DP array. Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare them with lower bound 0. However, in Fortran 90, arrays can have any lower bound. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, we can use 1-based arrays and adjust indices accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\n1. The input string is the output of the first part (e.g., \"53\").\n\n2. Read this string into a character array.\n\n3. Determine the length m of the string.\n\n4. Initialize a 2D array dp of size (m+1) x 13 (since in Java it's 0-based up to m-1, so in Fortran, perhaps 1-based up to m). Or maybe m x 13.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is of size [cs.length][13]. So for a string of length m, the dp has m rows. Each row corresponds to processing the first i+1 characters (from the end). So in Fortran, let's have dp(1:m, 0:12) (assuming 0-based columns).\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are easier with 1-based indices. So perhaps we can adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based for rows and 0-based for columns. Hmm, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based for both. So the columns (mod values) can be 1-13, but that would require adjusting the mod calculations.\n\nAlternatively, let's use 0-based for the mod values (0 to 12) and 1-based for the rows (1 to m).\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(m, 0:12) :: dp\n\nInitialize dp(1, :) = 0 except for the first step.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nInitialize the DP array:\n\nInitially, before any digits (i=0 in Java's terms), the mod is 0, so the count is 1 for mod 0.\n\nIn Fortran, for the first step (i=1 in Fortran, corresponding to i=0 in Java):\n\nWe need to process the first character (the last character of the input string).\n\nThe base starts at 1 (since in Java, base is initialized to 1 before the loop).\n\nSo for each step from 1 to m (Fortran's i corresponds to Java's i):\n\n   current character is the (m - i +1)th character of the original string (since we are processing from the end).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reverse the string first so that we can process it in order.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nLet me denote the input string as s, of length m.\n\nReverse the string so that we can process it from left to right (the first character in the reversed string is the last character of the original string).\n\nThen, for each position i from 1 to m (Fortran's 1-based), the current character is s_reversed(i).\n\nThe base starts at 1 (10^0 mod13).\n\nFor each step i (from 1 to m):\n\n   current character is s_reversed(i)\n\n   if it is '?', then loop over digits 0-9.\n\n   else, the digit is fixed.\n\n   For each possible previous mod (pre from 0 to 12):\n\n      the contribution comes from dp_prev(pre) (the previous step's dp value).\n\n      For each possible digit (d):\n\n          new_mod = (pre + base * d) mod13\n\n          dp_current(new_mod) = (dp_current(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre)) mod MOD\n\n   After processing all digits, set dp_prev = dp_current, and multiply base by 10 mod13.\n\nWait, perhaps using a temporary array for the current step.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can have a 2D array where dp(i, mod) is the count at step i for mod.\n\nBut for space, since m can be up to, say, 100 (since the first part's output is a string of length up to 2 digits (if n is 100, the max count could be 100, and the number of unique could be 100, so the output is \"100100\" which is 6 characters, but the second part's input is that string. So m can be up to 6 digits. So a 6x13 array is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the first part's input (n and the list of integers), compute the max count and unique count, form the string s = str(max_count) // str(unique_count).\n\n- Then process this string s through the DP.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nFirst, the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then n integers.\n\nWe need to count frequencies. Since n is up to 100, we can use an array of structures or two arrays: one for the keys and one for counts.\n\nLet me use two arrays: keys and counts. Since the number of unique elements can be up to n (100), we can allocate arrays of size 100.\n\nInitialize keys and counts as empty.\n\nRead each integer val:\n\n   search in keys for val. If found, increment counts at that index.\n\n   else, add to keys and counts.\n\nOnce all are read, find the maximum count and the number of keys.\n\nThen, form the string s as the concatenation of max_count and the number of keys.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nRead the string s (from the first part's output).\n\nReverse it (since we need to process from the end of the original string, which is the start of the reversed string).\n\nInitialize the DP array.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, val, max_count, num_unique, current_count\ninteger, dimension(100) :: keys, counts\nlogical :: found\n\n! Read n\nread*, n\n\n! Read the n integers\nallocate(keys(1:n), counts(1:n))\nnum_unique = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n   read*, val\n   found = .false.\n   do j = 1, num_unique\n      if (keys(j) == val) then\n         counts(j) = counts(j) +1\n         found = .true.\n         exit\n      end if\n   end do\n   if (.not. found) then\n      num_unique = num_unique +1\n      keys(num_unique) = val\n      counts(num_unique) = 1\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Find max_count\nmax_count = 0\ndo j = 1, num_unique\n   if (counts(j) > max_count) then\n      max_count = counts(j)\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Form the string s\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(i0,a,i0)') max_count, '', num_unique\ns = adjustl(s)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\n! Now process the second part with s as input\n\n! ... rest of the code for the second part ...\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement to form the string may need to be handled carefully. Alternatively, use internal writes.\n\nAlternatively, use write(s, '(i0,a,i0)') max_count, num_unique. Wait, but the a is for a string, but here we can just write the two numbers together.\n\nWait, the correct way is to write the two integers as strings and concatenate.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1, s2\nwrite(s1, '(i0)') max_count\nwrite(s2, '(i0)') num_unique\ns = trim(s1) // trim(s2)\n\nThat's better.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nThe string s is the input for the second part.\n\nWe need to process this string through the DP.\n\nFirst, reverse the string.\n\ncharacter(len= len_trim(s)) :: reversed_s\ninteger :: m, i\nm = len_trim(s)\ndo i = 1, m\n   reversed_s(i:i) = s(m -i +1:m -i +1)\nend do\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. So reversed_s can be a character array of length m.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(m) :: reversed_s\ndo i = 1, m\n   reversed_s(i) = s(m -i +1: m -i +1)\nend do\n\nThen, process each character in reversed_s.\n\nInitialize the DP arrays.\n\nThe DP can be represented as two arrays: previous and current.\n\ninteger*8, dimension(0:12) :: dp_prev, dp_current\ninteger :: MOD = 10**9 +7\ninteger :: base = 1\ninteger :: current_char, d, pre, new_mod\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\n\n! Initialize dp_prev: before any digits, only mod 0 has count 1\ndp_prev = 0\ndp_prev(0) = 1\n\ndo i = 1, m\n   c = reversed_s(i)\n   dp_current = 0\n   if (c == '?') then\n      do d = 0,9\n         do pre = 0,12\n            new_mod = mod( pre + base * d, 13 )\n            dp_current(new_mod) = mod( dp_current(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD )\n         end do\n      end do\n   else\n      read(c,*) current_char\n      d = current_char\n      do pre = 0,12\n         new_mod = mod( pre + base * d, 13 )\n         dp_current(new_mod) = mod( dp_current(new_mod) + dp_prev(pre), MOD )\n      end do\n   end if\n   dp_prev = dp_current\n   base = mod( base *10, 13 )\nend do\n\nThe final result is dp_prev(5), since we need the mod 5 after processing all characters.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the final output is dp[cs.length-1][5], which corresponds to the last step (i = m-1 in Java's terms, which is m in Fortran's 1-based). Since after processing all m characters, the dp_prev holds the final counts.\n\nWait, in the loop above, after processing all m characters, the dp_prev is the result after m steps, which corresponds to the entire string. So the answer is dp_prev(5).\n\nThus, the final result is dp_prev(5).\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's write the full Fortran code.\n\nBut first, note that in the first part, the keys and counts arrays may need to be dynamically sized. However, since n is up to 100, we can pre-allocate arrays of size 100.\n\nWait, in the first part code I wrote earlier, I used allocate(keys(1:n), counts(1:n)), but in Fortran, you can't allocate arrays in that way unless they are pointers. Alternatively, since n is known at read time, but in Fortran, variables can't be used in array declarations unless they are parameters. So perhaps better to use a fixed size array, say 100 elements.\n\nSo modifying the first part:\n\ninteger, dimension(100) :: keys, counts\n\nnum_unique =0\n\nThen, when reading each val:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   read*, val\n\n   found = .false.\n\n   do j=1, num_unique\n\n      if (keys(j) == val) then\n\n         counts(j) = counts(j)+1\n\n         found = .true.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. found) then\n\n      num_unique = num_unique +1\n\n      keys(num_unique) = val\n\n      counts(num_unique) =1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis should work as long as n is <=100.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe full code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, val, max_count, num_unique, current_count\ninteger, dimension(100) :: keys, counts\nlogical :: found\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1, s2, s\ninteger :: m, i_char\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: reversed_s\ninteger*8, dimension(0:12) :: dp_prev, dp_current\ninteger :: MOD = 10**9 +7\ninteger :: base =1\ninteger :: current_char, d, pre, new_mod\ninteger :: result\n\n!

However, in Fortran, reading a character like '5' into an integer variable will work, since '5' is a character, but the read statement will convert it to the numeric value. However, if the character is '?', then the read would fail. But in the else clause, we only enter when c is not '?', so that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (c == '?') then\n\n   ... process all digits 0-9\n\nelse\n\n   read(c,*) current_char\n\n   d = current_char\n\n   ... \n\nThis should work because c is a digit (since it's not '?'), so the read will work.\n\nTesting this code with an example:\n\nSuppose the first part's output is \"53\".\n\nThen the string s is \"53\".\n\nReversed_s would be \"35\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFirst character '3' (i=1):\n\nbase is 1 (initial value).\n\nc is '3', so d=3.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = pre + 1*3 mod13.\n\nThe initial dp_prev is [1,0,...0].\n\nSo for each pre=0:\n\nnew_mod = 0+3 =3 mod13 \u21923.\n\ndp_current(3) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus after first step, dp_prev(3) is 1.\n\nThen base becomes 10 mod13 \u219210.\n\nSecond character '5' (i=2):\n\nc is '5', so d=5.\n\nbase is 10.\n\nFor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nnew_mod = pre + 10*5 mod13 \u2192 pre +50 mod13.\n\n50 mod13 is 50 - 3*13=50-39=11 \u219250 mod13 is 11.\n\nSo new_mod = (pre +11) mod13.\n\nThe previous dp_prev was [0,0,0,1,0,...].\n\nSo for pre=3 (the only non-zero entry):\n\nnew_mod = (3 +11) mod13 =14 mod13 =1.\n\nThus, dp_current(1) +=1.\n\nOther pre's contribute 0.\n\nThus after second step, dp_prev(1) is 1.\n\nThe final result is dp_prev(5) \u21920, but that's not correct. Wait, but the example may not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, the input to the second part is \"53\", which is the output of the first part. The second part's code is supposed to compute the number of ways to replace '?' in the input string (but in this case, the input has no '?', so it's fixed digits '5' and '3').\n\nWait, the input string is \"53\", so the actual number is 53. We need to compute the number of ways (which is 1, since no '?') such that 53 mod13 is 5?\n\nWait, 53 divided by 13 is 4*13=52, so 53 mod13 is 1. So the result should be 0, since we need mod5.\n\nHmm, so the code would output 0 in this case, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code above, after processing the two characters, the final dp_prev(5) is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that case.\n\nAnother test case: if the input to the second part is \"5\", then the number is 5 mod13 is 5 \u2192 the result should be 1.\n\nLet's see:\n\ns is \"5\", reversed_s is \"5\".\n\nProcessing first character '5':\n\nbase is 1.\n\nd=5.\n\npre=0:\n\nnew_mod =0 +1*5 =5 mod13 \u21925.\n\nThus dp_prev(5) is 1.\n\nThus the result is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case with '?': input is \"?\", so the string is \"?\". The reversed_s is \"?\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1, c is '?'\n\nbase is 1.\n\nFor each d from 0-9:\n\nfor each pre (only pre=0 initially):\n\nnew_mod =0 +1*d mod13.\n\nThus for each d, the new_mod is d mod13.\n\nEach d contributes 1 to dp_current(d).\n\nAfter processing, dp_prev will have counts for each mod from 0-9 (since d can be 0-9).\n\nThen, the base becomes 10 mod13.\n\nThe result is the count for mod5. The possible d's that give mod5 are d=5 (since 5 mod13 is5). So the count is 1 (from d=5).\n\nThus the result is 1, which is correct.\n\nThus the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all parts are correctly translated.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's keys and counts arrays are initialized to zero. Since they are integers, that's okay. But when reading, we start with num_unique=0, so the first entry is keys(1) = val, counts(1)=1.\n\n- The reversed_s array is allocated with allocate(reversed_s(m)), which is correct.\n\n- The DP arrays are of type integer*8 to handle large numbers (mod 1e9+7).\n\n- The final print statement outputs the result.\n\nYes, this should work."
