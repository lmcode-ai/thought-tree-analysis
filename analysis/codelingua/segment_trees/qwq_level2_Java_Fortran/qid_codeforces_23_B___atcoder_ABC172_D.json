So in Fortran, we can read them as:\n\nread*, t, n\n\nBut wait, in the first Java program, the first input is t, then for each of t times, it reads n. So the input for the first Java program is t followed by t numbers. But in our case, since the second program needs a single n, the first program's output must be a single number, so t must be 1, so the input is 1 followed by a single n. So the Fortran program must read t (which is 1) and then read n. \n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the code is:\n\nScanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nint t = scan.nextInt();\n\nfor (int i=0; i < t; i++) {\n\n    int n = scan.nextInt();\n\n    System.out.println(maxLeft(n));\n\n} So the input is t followed by t numbers.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file, codeforces_23_B, reads an integer t, then for each of t test cases, it reads an integer n and prints the result of maxLeft(n). The maxLeft function returns n-2 if n is greater than 2, else 0. So for each input n, it's just calculating that value and outputting it.\n\nThe second Java file, atcoder_ABC172_D, takes an integer n and computes some formula involving a loop from 1 to n. The formula is ans += i * (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2. Then it prints the total ans.\n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So when we run them in sequence, the first program's output (the maxLeft results) are the inputs for the second program. Wait, but how exactly? Let me think.\n\nWait, the first program's output is multiple lines. The second program expects a single integer n as input. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the first program's output is for each test case, so if the first program's input is t test cases, each with n, then the first program outputs t lines. Then the second program would take each of those lines as its input? But the second program's main expects a single n. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a single number, but that can't be. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the first Java program's main reads t, then for each of t times, reads n, computes maxLeft(n), and prints that. So the output is t numbers. The second program expects a single n as input. So how does that sequence work? The second program's input is the output of the first. But the second program's input is a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is a single number? That can't be unless t is 1. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem setup. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a single integer. So the first program must output a single integer. Wait, but the first program's code is written to process t test cases, each with their own n, and output each result. So perhaps the first program's output is multiple lines, but the second program is expecting a single integer. That would mean that the first program's output is a single number, so maybe the first program is only run with t=1? Or perhaps the second program is supposed to read all the outputs from the first and process them? But the second program's code is written to take a single n. Hmm, maybe the first program's output is a single number, so the first program's input must have t=1, so that it outputs one number, which is then the input to the second program. But the problem says the original chain is executed in sequence, so the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be a single integer, so that the second can read it as its input. Therefore, the first program must have t=1, so that it outputs one number. But the user hasn't specified that. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is multiple numbers, but the second program is supposed to read all of them and process each? But the second program's code is written to take a single n. So maybe the second program is supposed to read each line from the first's output as a separate n? But the second program's code is written to read a single n. So perhaps the first program's output is a single number, so the second program can read that as its n. Therefore, the first program must have t=1, so that it outputs one number. But the problem says the original Java programs are to be translated into a single Fortran program that does the same. So the Fortran program must first process the first program's logic, then pass the result to the second's logic. \n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a single number. Let me re-examine the first Java code. The first program's main reads t test cases, each with an n, and for each, outputs maxLeft(n). So the output is t lines. The second program's input is a single integer n. So the second program would read that n from the first's output. But how? The first program's output is t lines, so the second program would read the first line as its n? Or maybe the first program's output is a single line, so t must be 1. The problem says the original chain is executed in sequence, so the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program must output exactly one integer, so that the second can read it. Therefore, the first program must have t=1. So the first program's input is t=1 followed by n, then it outputs maxLeft(n). Then the second program takes that output (the maxLeft(n)) as its input n, and computes the formula. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (t and then n), compute the first's output (maxLeft(n)), then use that as the input to the second program's computation. The final output is the result of the second program's computation. \n\nWait, but the first program's input is t followed by t numbers. But if t is 1, then the input is 1 followed by a single n. Then the first program outputs maxLeft(n). The second program takes that output (the maxLeft(n)) as its input n, and computes the formula. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (t and the numbers), process the first step (for each of the t test cases, compute maxLeft(n)), but since the second program expects a single n, perhaps the first program's output is a single number, so t must be 1. Therefore, the Fortran program must read t (which is 1), then read n, compute maxLeft(n), then pass that to the second program's logic (compute the formula with that value as n), and output the result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is multiple numbers, and the second program is supposed to process each of them. But the second program's code is written to take a single n. So perhaps the second program is supposed to read each of the first's outputs as separate n's and compute each, then output all? But the problem says the second program's output is the final output. Wait, the user's instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program must read the first's output as its input. \n\nIf the first program outputs multiple lines, then the second program must read all of them. But the second program's code is written to read a single integer. So that suggests that the first program's output is a single integer, so the second can read it. Therefore, the first program must have t=1. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program (t and then t numbers), compute the first's outputs (maxLeft for each n), but since the second program needs a single n, the first program's output must be a single number, so t must be 1. Therefore, the Fortran program will read t (which is 1), then read n, compute maxLeft(n), then use that as the input to the second program's code (compute the formula with that value as n), and output the result. \n\nSo the steps for the Fortran program are:\n\n1. Read t (which is 1) and then read n.\n\n2. Compute maxLeft(n) = n-2 if n>2 else 0. Let's call this value m.\n\n3. Then compute the second program's formula using m as the input n.\n\n4. Output the result of the second program's computation.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all that in sequence, without any intermediate I/O except for the first read and the final output.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part: reading t and n. Since in the original Java code, the first program reads t, then for each of t times, reads n. But in our case, t must be 1, so the input is first an integer t (1), then an integer n. So in Fortran, we can read them as:\n\nread*, t, n\n\nBut wait, in the first Java program, the first input is t, then for each of t times, it reads n. So the input for the first Java program is t followed by t numbers. But in our case, since the second program needs a single n, the first program's output must be a single number, so t must be 1, so the input is 1 followed by a single n. So the Fortran program must read t (which is 1) and then read n. \n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the code is:\n\nScanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\nint t = scan.nextInt();\n\nfor (int i=0; i < t; i++) {\n\n    int n = scan.nextInt();\n\n    System.out.println(maxLeft(n));\n\n}\n\nSo the input is t followed by t numbers. The output is t numbers. So the second program must read all those t numbers as its input. But the second program's code is written to read a single n. So that suggests that the first program's output is a single number, so t must be 1. Therefore, the input to the first program is 1 followed by a single n. The first program outputs one number (maxLeft(n)), which is the input to the second program. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the first input (t and then n), compute the first's output (m = maxLeft(n)), then compute the second's formula with m as the input n, and output the result. \n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead t and n (the first part's input).\n\nCompute m = n - 2 if n>2 else 0.\n\nThen compute the second part's formula with m as the input n.\n\nThen output the result.\n\nNow, the second part's formula is:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to m (since the second program's n is m here).\n\nans += i * (m / i) * ( (m / i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=1; i < n+1; i++), so i goes from 1 to n inclusive. So in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to m.\n\nWait, in the second Java code, the loop is for (int i=1; i < n+1; i++), which is equivalent to i from 1 to n. So in Fortran, the loop would be do i=1, m.\n\nThe formula for each term is i multiplied by (m divided by i) multiplied by ( (m divided by i) +1 ) divided by 2. \n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we have to be careful with types. Since in Java, the variables are long, so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(18) for 64-bit integers) to handle large numbers.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read t and n. Since t must be 1, but the code should still read it properly. \n\nThen compute m = max(0, n-2) if n>2 else 0. Wait, the maxLeft function is n>2 ? n-2 :0. So m = n-2 if n>2, else 0.\n\nThen compute the sum:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i =1, m\n\n    term = i * (m / i) * ( (m/i) +1 ) / 2\n\n    ans = ans + term\n\nend do\n\nThen print ans.\n\nWait, but in Java, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, using / for integers will do that. \n\nBut in Fortran, the order of operations and integer division must be correct. Let me see:\n\nThe term is i multiplied by (m divided by i) multiplied by ( (m divided by i) +1 ) divided by 2. \n\nWait, the formula in Java is (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1)/2. So the division is integer division. \n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to m:\n\ntemp = m / i\n\nterm = i * temp * (temp +1) / 2\n\nans = ans + term\n\nYes.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nWe need to use integers that can handle large numbers. The second Java program uses long, which is 64 bits. So in Fortran, we can use integer(8) variables (assuming 64-bit integers). \n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, n, m, i\n\ninteger(8) :: ans, temp, term\n\nread*, t, n\n\nif (t /=1) then\n\n    ! but according to the problem, the input must be such that the first program outputs a single number, so t must be 1. But perhaps the code should still process it as per the original sequence. Wait, the problem says the original Java programs are to be translated into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So the input to the first program is whatever the user provides, but the second program must take the output of the first as input. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood earlier. Maybe the first program's output is multiple lines, and the second program reads all of them as its input. But the second program's code is written to read a single n. So that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the second program is supposed to read each of the first's outputs as separate n's and compute each, then output all. But the second program's code is written to read a single n and output a single ans. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nThe user says: the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. \n\nThe first program's output is t lines (each being maxLeft(n_i)), where n_i are the inputs for each test case. The second program expects a single integer n as input. So how does that work? Unless the second program is supposed to read all the outputs of the first and process each as a separate n, but the second program's code is written to process a single n. \n\nWait, perhaps the second program is supposed to read all the outputs of the first program (the t numbers) and process each as a separate n, then output t results. But the second program's code is written to read a single n and output a single ans. \n\nTherefore, the second program would need to read each of the first's outputs as its own n, compute the formula for each, and output each result. But the original second Java program is written to read a single n and output a single ans. \n\nTherefore, the sequence of the two Java programs would be:\n\nFirst program outputs t numbers. Second program reads each of those numbers as its input n, computes the formula for each, and outputs t numbers. \n\nAh! That's probably the case. So the second program is run once for each output line of the first program. \n\nWait, but the second Java program's main is written to read a single n. So if the first program outputs t numbers, then the second program would be run t times, each time taking one of those numbers as input. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the Fortran program must read the first program's input (t and the n's), compute the first's outputs (the t maxLeft values), then for each of those, compute the second's formula, and output all the results. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So the first program's output is t numbers, each of which is an input to the second program. So the second program is applied to each of those numbers, and the final output is the t results from the second program. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read t and then t numbers (the inputs for the first Java program).\n\n2. For each of those numbers, compute maxLeft(n_i) to get m_i.\n\n3. For each m_i, compute the second program's formula (the sum over i from 1 to m_i of the term).\n\n4. Output all the results (the t answers from the second program).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead t.\n\nRead n1, n2, ..., nt.\n\nFor each ni in n1 to nt:\n\n    compute m_i = maxLeft(ni)\n\n    compute ans_i = sum_{k=1 to m_i} [k * (m_i /k) * ( (m_i/k)+1 ) /2 ]\n\nThen output each ans_i.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must process all t test cases, each through both steps, and output all the results. \n\nThis changes things. So the initial misunderstanding was that the second program is applied to each of the first's outputs. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (t followed by t numbers), process each number through both steps, and output the final results. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read t, then read an array of n's. \n\nThen loop over each n in the array:\n\nCompute m = n-2 if n>2 else 0.\n\nThen compute the sum for m.\n\nThen collect all the results and output them.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, i, j, n, m\n\ninteger(8) :: ans\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nums, results\n\nread*, t\n\nallocate(nums(t))\n\nread*, nums(1:t)\n\nallocate(results(t))\n\ndo i =1, t\n\n    n = nums(i)\n\n    if (n >2) then\n\n        m = n-2\n\n    else\n\n        m =0\n\n    end if\n\n    ans =0\n\n    do j=1, m\n\n        temp = m /j\n\n        term = j * temp * (temp +1)/2\n\n        ans = ans + term\n\n    end do\n\n    results(i) = ans\n\nend do\n\ndo i=1, t\n\n    print*, results(i)\n\nend do\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the second loop, the variables temp and term need to be declared. Also, in the inner loop, the variables j is the loop variable. \n\nWait, in the code above, the variables temp and term are not declared. Let me correct that. Also, the term and temp can be integers, but since m can be up to the original n (which could be large?), but the second Java program uses long, so in Fortran, we need to use 64-bit integers for ans, temp, term. \n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: ans, temp, term\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nInside the loop over i (each test case):\n\n    n = nums(i)\n\n    compute m.\n\n    ans =0\n\n    do j=1, m\n\n        temp = m /j\n\n        term = j * temp * (temp +1)/2\n\n        ans = ans + term\n\n    end do\n\nSo temp is m/j, which is integer division. \n\nBut in Fortran, the division of integers is integer division. So that's okay. \n\nBut variables temp and term need to be declared. So inside the loop over i, perhaps declare temp and term as integers. \n\nAlternatively, declare them inside the loop. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, variables can be declared anywhere. \n\nSo perhaps:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, i, j, n, m\n\ninteger(8) :: ans, temp, term\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nums, results\n\nread*, t\n\nallocate(nums(t))\n\nread*, nums(1:t)\n\nallocate(results(t))\n\ndo i =1, t\n\n    n = nums(i)\n\n    if (n >2) then\n\n        m = n-2\n\n    else\n\n        m =0\n\n    end if\n\n    ans =0_8\n\n    do j=1, m\n\n        temp = m /j\n\n        term = j * temp * (temp +1)/2\n\n        ans = ans + term\n\n    end do\n\n    results(i) = ans\n\nend do\n\ndo i=1, t\n\n    print*, results(i)\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(nums, results)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the inner loop, j is from 1 to m. But if m is 0, then the loop doesn't execute. That's okay. \n\nWait, when m is 0, the loop from 1 to 0 is not executed, so ans remains 0, which is correct. \n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSuppose t=1, n=3. Then m =3-2=1. \n\nThen the second part's loop is j from 1 to 1:\n\ntemp =1/1 =1\n\nterm =1 *1*(1+1)/2 =1*1*2/2 =1. So ans is 1. \n\nSo the output is 1. \n\nIn the second Java program, if n=1, the loop runs from 1 to 1:\n\nans +=1 * (1/1)*(1+1)/2 \u2192 1*1*2/2 =1 \u2192 total 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's n=5. Then m=5-2=3. \n\nSecond program's n=3:\n\nLoop j from 1 to 3:\n\nj=1:\n\ntemp=3/1=3 \u2192 term=1*3*(4)/2 \u2192 1*3*4/2 =6 \u2192 ans +=6 \u2192 6\n\nj=2:\n\ntemp=3/2=1 \u2192 term=2*1*(2)/2 \u2192 2*1*2/2 =2 \u2192 ans becomes 8\n\nj=3:\n\ntemp=3/3=1 \u2192 term=3*1*(2)/2 \u2192 3*1*2/2 =3 \u2192 total ans 11.\n\nSo the output would be 11. \n\nLet me see what the second Java code would compute for n=3:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni from 1 to 3:\n\ni=1:\n\nterm =1 * (3/1) * (3/1 +1)/2 \u2192 1*3*(4)/2 \u2192 6 \u2192 ans=6\n\ni=2:\n\nterm =2 * (3/2=1) * (1+1)/2 \u2192 2*1*2/2 \u2192 2 \u2192 ans=8\n\ni=3:\n\nterm =3 * (3/3=1) * (1+1)/2 \u2192 3*1*2/2 \u21923 \u2192 ans=11. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables need to be declared properly. \n\nAlso, in the code above, the variables temp and term are declared as integer(8). \n\nWait, in the code, temp is m/j, which is integer division. So temp can be an integer. But since m can be up to the original n (which could be large?), but in the term calculation, multiplying by j and other terms, but since in Java it's using long, so in Fortran, using integer(8) for temp and term is okay. \n\nAlternatively, since term is added to ans (which is integer(8)), perhaps temp can be integer, but to avoid overflow, better to use integer(8). \n\nThe code should be okay. \n\nNow, the variables nums and results are arrays of integers. Since the first program's input n can be up to whatever, but in the first step, m is n-2, but the second step's loop is up to m, which could be large. But in Fortran, the array nums can be integers, but if the input n is very large (like up to 1e9?), then the loop in the second step could be a problem. Wait, but in the second Java program, the loop runs from 1 to n. If n is 1e9, that would be a problem. But in the problem's context, perhaps the input is within reasonable limits. But the user hasn't specified constraints, so we have to assume that the code must handle it as per the original Java code. \n\nWait, but in the second Java code, the loop runs from 1 to n. If n is large (like 1e9), this would take way too long. But the problem says to translate the code, so we have to do it as per the code, even if it's inefficient. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must loop from 1 to m for each test case, which could be slow for large m. But that's the same as the original Java code. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct as per the problem's requirements. \n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are properly declared. Let me write the code step by step.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, the print statement uses * to print the value. \n\nThe code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, i, j, n, m\n\ninteger(8) :: ans, temp, term\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nums, results\n\n! Read the first input: t followed by t numbers\n\nread*, t\n\nallocate(nums(t))\n\nread*, nums(1:t)\n\nallocate(results(t))\n\ndo i =1, t\n\n    n = nums(i)\n\n    if (n > 2) then\n\n        m = n - 2\n\n    else\n\n        m = 0\n\n    end if\n\n    ans = 0_8\n\n    do j = 1, m\n\n        temp = m / j\n\n        term = j * temp * (temp + 1) / 2\n\n        ans = ans + term\n\n    end do\n\n    results(i) = ans\n\nend do\n\n! Output all results\n\ndo i =1, t\n\n    print*, results(i)\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(nums, results)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the inner loop, when m is zero, the loop from 1 to 0 is not executed, so ans remains 0, which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nTesting with the first example where n=3 (so m=1):\n\nThe loop runs once (j=1):\n\ntemp =1/1=1 \u2192 term=1*1*(2)/2 \u21921 \u2192 ans=1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=5 \u2192 m=3. The loop runs 3 times, as before. \n\nAnother edge case: n=2 \u2192 m=0 \u2192 ans remains 0. \n\nAnother edge case: n=1 \u2192 m=0 \u2192 ans 0. \n\nAnother case: n=4 \u2192 m=2. \n\nThen the second part's loop runs for j=1 and 2.\n\nj=1:\n\ntemp=2/1=2 \u2192 term=1*2*(3)/2 \u2192 3 \u2192 ans=3.\n\nj=2:\n\ntemp=2/2=1 \u2192 term=2*1*(2)/2 \u2192 2 \u2192 total ans 5. \n\nThe second Java code for n=2 would compute:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni=1: term 1*(2/1)*(3)/2 \u21921*2*3/2 \u21923 \u2192 ans=3.\n\ni=2: term 2*(1)*(2)/2 \u21922*1*2/2 \u21922 \u2192 total 5. \n\nSo correct. \n\nTherefore, the code should work. \n\nNow, the code must not have any intermediate I/O. The first block reads input, the last outputs, and the middle steps process without I/O. Which this code does. \n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
