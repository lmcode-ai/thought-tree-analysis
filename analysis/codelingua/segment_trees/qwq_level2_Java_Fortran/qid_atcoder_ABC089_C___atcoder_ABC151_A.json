    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (TaskC in atcoder_ABC089_C). It reads an integer n, then n strings. For each string, it checks the first character and increments the corresponding counter in an array of 5 elements (M, A, R, C, H). Then it calculates the sum of all possible products of three different counters. The result is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but how does this fit into the sequence? Because the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, and the second expects a string. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a single string, which it takes the first character of. So the first program's output (a number) is the input to the second program, which would read that number as a string, take its first character, add 1, and output that. Wait, but that might not make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program. The second program reads that number as a string (since it's using BufferedReader.readLine()), so the input to the second program is the string representation of the first program's output. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program reads \"123\" as the input string, takes the first character '1', adds 1 (to get '2'), and outputs that. So the final output would be the next character after the first character of the first program's output.\n\nSo the overall process is: input to the first program (n and the strings) \u2192 first program outputs a number \u2192 that number is the input to the second program, which processes its first character and outputs the next character.\n\nNow, the task is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first Java program's input is read by the Fortran program.\n- The first program's output is passed to the second program's processing without I/O in between.\n- The second program's processing is done in Fortran, and the final output is produced by the second's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read the input (n and the n strings) from stdin.\n2. Process the first part (count the letters and compute the sum of products).\n3. Take the result (the computed number) and process it as per the second Java program: convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, then output that character.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a single line which is the output of the first. So in Fortran, after computing the first result (res), we need to convert that number to a string, then process that string as per the second program's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and the n strings, count the letters as in the first Java program.\n- Compute res as the sum of the products.\n- Convert res to a string (so that the second part can process it).\n- Take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to convert a number to a string? We can use write with an internal file or a character variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's logic is to take the first character of the string representation of the first program's output, then increment it by 1 (as a character). So for example, if the first program outputs 123, the string is \"123\", first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so output '2'.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing res, we need to:\n\n- Convert res to a string. Let's say using write into a character variable.\n- Take the first character of that string.\n- Increment its ASCII value by 1. In Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n- Then print that character.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read n, then n strings. For each string, check the first character. The counters are 5 elements (M, A, R, C, H). So in Fortran, an array of 5 integers (or integers, since n can be up to maybe 1e5, but in Java they used long, so in Fortran, using integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18) to handle large numbers. Wait, the problem's first program's result can be up to (n choose 3) if all are in the same group, but with 5 groups, so maximum would be (n^3) for n up to say 1e5, which is 1e15, so 64-bit integer needed. So in Fortran, using integer(8) (or selected_int_kind(18)).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n strings. For each string, check the first character. Increment the corresponding counter.\n\n3. Compute the sum of all possible triplets of different counters. The formula given in the first Java program is:\n\nres = cnt[0]*cnt[1]*cnt[2] + cnt[0]*cnt[1]*cnt[3] + ... etc. All combinations of three different indices from 0-4, except those with duplicates. Wait, the code in Java has 10 terms, which is the number of combinations of 5 elements taken 3 at a time (since 5C3 is 10). So the code is summing all possible triplets of distinct indices.\n\nSo the formula is the sum over all i < j < k of cnt[i] * cnt[j] * cnt[k].\n\nAlternatively, the code's way is to list all possible triplets. So in Fortran, we can compute this by looping through all possible triplets, but perhaps it's easier to code the same terms as in Java.\n\nAlternatively, the code in Java has 10 terms, so we can just code them directly.\n\nNow, after computing res, we need to process it as per the second program.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing res, we need to convert it to a string. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_res\nwrite(str_res, '(I0)') res\n\nThen, take the first character of str_res. But need to make sure that leading spaces are not an issue. Since I0 format writes the number without leading spaces, so the first character is the first digit.\n\nThen, get the first character:\n\nchar = str_res(1:1)\n\nThen, increment its ASCII value by 1. In Fortran, we can use ichar and char functions:\n\nnew_char = char(ichar(char) + 1)\n\nThen, print new_char.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn Fortran, reading n and then n strings. Each string is read as a character string. But in the first Java program, the code uses in.next(), which reads tokens separated by whitespace. So in Fortran, we can read each string as a separate input, but need to read them one by one.\n\nWait, in Java, Scanner's next() reads the next token, so the input is a sequence of n strings, each separated by whitespace (space or newline). So in Fortran, to read each string, perhaps using a loop with read(*, '(A)') for each string. But need to read exactly n strings.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading with list-directed input, each item is separated by whitespace. So for example, if the input is given as:\n\n5\nM A R C H\n\nThen the first read would get 5, then the next reads would get each of the 5 strings. But if the input is given with each string on a new line, that's also okay.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger(8) :: cnt(0:4) = 0\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\nread(*,*) n\ndo i = 1, n\n   read(*, '(A)') str\n   select case (str(1:1))\n   case ('M')\n      cnt(0) = cnt(0) + 1\n   case ('A')\n      cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n   case ('R')\n      cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n   case ('C')\n      cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n   case ('H')\n      cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n   end select\nend do\n\nThen compute res:\n\ninteger(8) :: res\nres = cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(2) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(4) + &\n      cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(0)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n      cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n      cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4)\n\nThen convert res to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_res\nwrite(str_res, '(I0)') res\n\nThen process the first character:\n\ncharacter :: first_char, output_char\nfirst_char = str_res(1:1)\noutput_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\nThen print output_char:\n\nprint *, output_char\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the output is just the single character, so using print *, would add a space or new line. But in Java, the second program uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) which outputs exactly the character. In Fortran, to print without a trailing space or newline, perhaps using an explicit format.\n\nAlternatively, using write(*, '(A)') trim(adjustl(output_char)) ?\n\nWait, the output_char is a single character, so:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') output_char\n\nThat should work.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nNow, let's check the data types. The cnt array needs to be 64-bit integers because the product could be large. In Fortran, integer(8) is 64 bits. Alternatively, use selected_int_kind(18) to get a kind that can hold up to 1e18, but integer(8) is common.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram combined\n   implicit none\n   integer :: n, i\n   integer(8) :: cnt(0:4) = 0_8\n   character(len=20) :: str\n   integer(8) :: res\n   character(len=20) :: str_res\n   character :: first_char, output_char\n\n   read(*,*) n\n   do i = 1, n\n      read(*, '(A)') str\n      select case (str(1:1))\n      case ('M')\n         cnt(0) = cnt(0) + 1\n      case ('A')\n         cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n      case ('R')\n         cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n      case ('C')\n         cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n      case ('H')\n         cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n      end select\n   end do\n\n   res = cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(2) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(0)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4)\n\n   write(str_res, '(I0)') res\n   first_char = str_res(1:1)\n   output_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n   write(*, '(A)') output_char\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read via BufferedReader.readLine(), which reads the entire line. However, in the first program's output, when we write the res, it's a number, so the output is a single line with that number. So the second program's input is that line. So the Fortran code correctly converts the res to a string, then takes the first character.\n\nBut what if the number is, say, \"0\"? Then the first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1', which is correct. If the number is \"1000\", first character is '1', so output '2'.\n\nEdge cases: What if the number is negative? But in the first program, the res is a sum of products of counts, which are non-negative, so res is non-negative. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: if res is 0, then the string is \"0\", so first character is '0', output '1'.\n\nAnother case: if res is 999, the string is \"999\", first character '9' \u2192 'A' (since ASCII for '9' is 57, adding 1 gives 58 which is ':', but wait, wait, the second Java program's code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nWait, in Java, the code is taking the first character of the input string (which is the first character of the first program's output), then adding 1 to its ASCII value, then printing that as a character.\n\nSo in the example where the first program outputs \"123\", the first character is '1' (ASCII 49), adding 1 gives 50 which is '2', so output is '2'.\n\nIn Fortran, the code does the same: first_char is '1', ichar gives 49, add 1 \u2192 50 \u2192 char(50) is '2'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, check the Fortran code for possible issues.\n\nThe read for the strings: using '(A)' should read the entire line as a string, but in the Java code, the input is read as tokens. Wait, in the first Java program, the code uses in.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So each string is a token, so in Fortran, the input should be read as tokens. However, in Fortran, when using list-directed input (read(*,*) n), then the next reads with read(*, '(A)') would read the entire line for each string. Wait, no. Wait, the first read is read(*,*) n, which reads the first line (assuming input is given as first line n, then n lines each with a string). Or perhaps the input is given as all on one line, separated by spaces. The problem's first Java program uses in.next(), which reads tokens separated by whitespace. So the input could be given as all on one line, or each on separate lines. The Fortran code must read each string as a token, not a line.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n    String str = in.next();\n    ... \n}\n\nSo in.next() reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So in Fortran, to read each string as a token, we can use list-directed input. So instead of reading with '(A)', which reads the entire line, perhaps we should read with read(*,*) str, but that may have issues with strings containing spaces. Wait, but the problem's first Java program's input is strings that are single characters (since they check the first character, but the rest of the string is irrelevant). Wait, actually, the problem's first Java program is for a problem where the input is names, and only the first character is considered. So each string is a name, but the code only looks at the first character. So the actual string can be any length, but in the code, only the first character is used. So in Fortran, when reading the strings, we can read them as a single character, but no, because the rest of the string is irrelevant. So in Fortran, to read each token (the next string in the input), we can read into a character variable with list-directed input. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: str\nread(*,*) str\n\nBut this may have issues if the string contains spaces. However, in the problem's context, perhaps the input strings are single letters (like \"M\", \"A\", etc.), so the code can safely read each as a single token. So using list-directed input for each string is okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using list-directed input with read(*,*) str, the variable str must be a character variable. So perhaps better to read as:\n\nread(*, '(A)') str\n\nBut that would read the entire line. Hmm, this is a problem. Because in the Java code, each string is a token, so if the input is given as all on one line, separated by spaces, then in Fortran, using read(*, '(A)') for each string would read the entire line for the first string, which is wrong.\n\nAh, this is a critical point. The input for the first program is n followed by n strings, each of which is a token (split by whitespace). So in Fortran, to read each string as a token, we need to read them as list-directed input. So for example:\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n5\nM A R C H\n\nThen after reading n=5, the next 5 reads would get \"M\", \"A\", \"R\", \"C\", \"H\".\n\nAlternatively, if the input is:\n\n5\nM\nA\nR\nC\nH\n\nThen each read would get each line as a string (since list-directed reads a line at a time, but for a single string, it's okay).\n\nWait, in Fortran, list-directed input reads from the input stream, and for a read(*,*) str, it reads the next \"item\", which is a string (without spaces) until the next whitespace. So in the first case (all on one line), the first read after n would read \"M\", then \"A\", etc. In the second case (each on separate lines), each read would read the entire line (since the line is just the string followed by a newline). But in that case, the string would include the newline? No, list-directed input ignores leading whitespace and reads until the next whitespace or end of line. Wait, perhaps in the second case, each line is a single string, so the read(*,*) str would read the entire line (since there's no other characters except the newline). So in that case, the string would be \"M\" (without the newline), because list-directed input trims the trailing newline.\n\nTherefore, using list-directed input for the strings is correct.\n\nSo the correct way to read each string is:\n\nread(*,*) str\n\nBut str must be a character variable. So in the code, the variable str is declared as, say, len=1 (since we only need the first character). Wait, but the rest of the string is irrelevant. So perhaps declare str as a character of sufficient length, say 100, and then take the first character.\n\nWait, in the code above, the code uses str(1:1). So even if the string is longer, like \"Mary\", the code would take the first character 'M', which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code can be adjusted as:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: str\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nread(*,*) str\n\nThen check str(1:1).\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram combined\n   implicit none\n   integer :: n, i\n   integer(8) :: cnt(0:4) = 0_8\n   character(len=100) :: str\n   integer(8) :: res\n   character(len=20) :: str_res\n   character :: first_char, output_char\n\n   read(*,*) n\n   do i = 1, n\n      read(*,*) str\n      select case (str(1:1))\n      case ('M')\n         cnt(0) = cnt(0) + 1\n      case ('A')\n         cnt(1) = cnt(1) + 1\n      case ('R')\n         cnt(2) = cnt(2) + 1\n      case ('C')\n         cnt(3) = cnt(3) + 1\n      case ('H')\n         cnt(4) = cnt(4) + 1\n      end select\n   end do\n\n   res = cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(2) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(1)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(0)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(0)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n         cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4)\n\n   write(str_res, '(I0)') res\n   first_char = str_res(1:1)\n   output_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n   write(*, '(A)') output_char\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the read(*,*) str, if the string has leading spaces, but the first non-space character is considered. But according to the problem's first Java code, the input strings are read via in.next(), which skips whitespace and reads the next token. So in Fortran, list-directed input does the same, so this is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the initial array cnt is initialized to zero. In Fortran, the =0_8 initializes all elements to zero. That's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\nM A R\n\nThen the counts are M:1, A:1, R:1. The res is 1*1*1 (M,A,R) plus other terms where three are chosen. Wait, the first term is M*A*R (indices 0,1,2) \u2192 1*1*1 =1. The other terms would be M*A*C (but C is 0), so no. So the total res is 1 (from the first term) plus other terms where three are non-zero. Wait, in this case, only the first term (0,1,2) is non-zero. The other terms would have at least one zero. So res is 1. Then the second program's input is \"1\", so first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so output is '2'.\n\nThe code should output '2'.\n\nAnother test case: input 0. Wait, but n is given as input. If n=0, then all counts are zero, so res is 0. The second program's input is \"0\", so first character '0' \u2192 '1'.\n\nAnother case: n=5, all H. Then all counts except H (index4) are zero. So all terms in res are zero. So res is 0 \u2192 output '1'.\n\nAnother case: n=4 with M, A, R, C. Then counts are 1 each for M, A, R, C. The terms would be combinations of three different indices. For example, M,A,R \u2192 1, M,A,C \u21921, M,R,C \u21921, A,R,C \u21921. The other terms (like M,A,H but H is 0) are zero. So total res is 4. The string is \"4\", first character '4' \u2192 '5'.\n\nSo the code should output '5'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the second Java program's code also has a class RemRing, but in the main method of atcoder_ABC151_A, it's not used. The second program only does the first part (reading the first character and adding 1). So the RemRing class is irrelevant here. So we can ignore it in the Fortran code.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as written above."
