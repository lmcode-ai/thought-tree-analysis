    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC104_C) reads input D and G, then an array p and c of size D. It then iterates over all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^D -1) to find the minimum number of problems needed to reach at least G points. The calculation involves checking each bit to see if a set of problems is included, adding their points, and then if the total is still below G, it tries adding the maximum possible from the remaining problems. The minimum is tracked and printed.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC155_E) takes a string number, processes its digits from right to left, and calculates some bills based on the digits. It seems to handle converting digits into a minimal number of coins or bills, maybe in a specific currency system where each digit's value is processed with certain rules. The output is the total bills.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first Java program reads input, so in Fortran, the first part must handle input.\n2. The second Java program's input is the output of the first, but since we can't have I/O in between, we need to pass the result of the first computation into the second's processing without writing to a file or screen. So the first program's output (the min value) is the input to the second's processing. Wait, but the second program's input is a string number. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe second program's input is a string (number = sc.next()), which is then processed as digits. But the first program's output is an integer (min). So the output of the first program is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So in the combined Fortran program, the first part computes the min, then that min is passed as the input to the second part's processing. But since the second part expects a string (the number as a string), the min from the first part must be converted to a string and then processed by the second part's logic.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first Java program's output is the min value, which is an integer. The second Java program reads a string (the number) from input. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the combined Fortran program, the first part's result (min) is an integer, which must be converted to a string (as the second part expects a string input). Then the second part processes that string.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read input for the first part (D, G, p, c arrays).\n2. Compute the min value as per the first Java program.\n3. Convert that min value to a string (since the second part processes a string number).\n4. Process that string through the second Java's logic to compute the bills.\n5. Output the final bills.\n\nBut in Fortran, how to handle this? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\n- D is an integer, G is a long (so in Fortran, integer*8 or integer(8)), p and c are arrays of integers of size D.\n\nThe first part's code is straightforward, except for the loops over all bits (bitmask). The bitmask loop in Java is from 0 to (1 << D) -1. In Fortran, we can loop over all possible integers from 0 to 2^D -1. However, for D up to, say, 10, that's manageable. But if D is up to, say, 10, then 2^10 is 1024, which is okay. The problem's constraints for the first program (ABC104_C) probably have D up to 10, since otherwise the bitmask approach would be too slow. So assuming D is manageable.\n\nThe second part's variables:\n\nThe input is a string (the min from first part). So in Fortran, after computing min, we need to convert it to a string. Then process each digit as per the second Java's code.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\n- Reads a string, then processes each digit from right to left (since in the loop, it's stored in digits array with digits[0] being the least significant digit). The digits array is of length number.length() +1, so for a number like \"123\", digits has 4 elements (digits[0] =3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, digits[3]=0? Or maybe the loop is for i from 0 to number.length()-1, but in the code, the loop is for i from 0 to number.length(), so perhaps the +1 is to handle carryover.\n\nWait, in the second Java code:\n\ndigits is initialized as new int[number.length() +1]. Then, for each i from 0 to number.length()-1 (since the loop is for i < number.length()), the code does:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0'\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++), so the loop runs for i from 0 to len-1. The digits array is of size len+1, so digits[0] to digits[len].\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n    digits[i] = ... \n}\n\nThen, the next loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nSo the digits array has an extra element at the end (digits[number.length()]) which is initialized to 0 (since it's an int array, initialized to 0). \n\nThe processing in the second part involves handling each digit, possibly carrying over to the next digit. The algorithm seems to be converting the number into a minimal number of coins, perhaps in a system where each digit can be represented in a certain way. The exact logic is a bit unclear, but the code must be translated accurately.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead D, G, then p and c arrays.\n\nCompute min as per the first Java code.\n\nSecond part:\n\nConvert min to a string. Let's see, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write and read. For example:\n\ninteger :: min_val\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\nwrite(str_min, '(i0)') min_val\nstr_min = adjustl(str_min)  ! To remove leading spaces\n\nThen, process this string as the input to the second part's algorithm.\n\nWait, but the second part's code expects the input as a string, so the string is the number as a string. So the min from the first part is an integer, which when converted to a string is the input to the second part.\n\nOnce the string is obtained, the second part's processing can be done.\n\nNow, the second part's processing steps:\n\nThe digits array in Java is of length number.length() +1. So in Fortran, we can have an array of integers, say digits, with size (len +1), where len is the length of the string.\n\nWait, the string is the converted min_val. Let's say the string is stored in a character variable, say input_str. The length is len = len_trim(input_str).\n\nThen, digits array in Fortran would be an array of integers of size (len +1). The digits are stored in reverse order (since in Java, the first digit is the least significant digit). So for each character in input_str, starting from the end (since in Java, they process from the end), but in Fortran, perhaps we can loop through the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array is filled as:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n}\n\nSo for the string \"123\", the digits array would be [3,2,1,0], since the first character (index 0) is the last character of the string (since number.length() -1 -i for i=0 is 2, so the third character (assuming 0-based) is '3', then for i=1, it's 1, so '2', etc. So the digits array is stored in reverse order of the string's characters. So in Fortran, to replicate this, we can loop over the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninput_str is the string of the min_val.\n\nlen = len_trim(input_str)\n\ndigits(0:len) = 0  ! assuming 0-based, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Hmm, need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared with a lower bound. So perhaps better to use 0-based by declaring digits(0:len). Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, to have an array from 0 to len, we can declare it as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len) :: digits\n\nBut first, we need to know the length. So first, get the length of the input_str.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a dynamic approach. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, after converting min_val to input_str, we can get its length as len = len_trim(input_str).\n\nThen, allocate an array digits of size (0:len). Wait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed sizes. So perhaps better to use a fixed size, say up to 20 digits (since the first program's output is an integer, which can be up to, say, 1e5 (since the problem's constraints for ABC104_C's p[i] is up to 100, D up to 10, so the maximum possible min could be 1000, but maybe more). Anyway, 20 digits is enough.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of size 20, but in code, we can handle it.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead D, G, then p and c arrays.\n\nCompute min_val as per the first Java code.\n\nThen, convert min_val to a string.\n\nThen, process the string through the second part's algorithm.\n\nNow, let's tackle the first part's code in Fortran.\n\nFirst part variables:\n\nD is an integer.\n\nG is a long (in Java, but in Fortran, integer(8) or integer*8).\n\np and c are arrays of integers of size D.\n\nThe first part's code:\n\nThe main loop is over all bits from 0 to 2^D -1. In Fortran, we can loop over bit from 0 to 2**D -1.\n\nBut for D up to 10, 2^10 is 1024, which is manageable. For D=20, 2^20 is over a million, but perhaps the problem constraints for ABC104_C have D up to 10. Let's assume that.\n\nThe inner loops:\n\nFor each bit, compute score and solve_num.\n\nThen, if score < G, loop through the bits again to see which ones are not set and add as many as possible.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--):\n\nif (bit's ith bit is 0), then for j from 0 to p[i]-2, add 100*(i+1) to score and increment solve_num. Because adding p[i]-1 problems (since the first p[i] problems are already counted in the initial loop if the bit was set, but here it's not set, so we can add up to p[i]-1? Wait, the code in Java for the second loop:\n\nif (bit & (1<<i) ==0) then:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < p[i]-1; j++) {\n\nso adding p[i]-1 problems. Because each j from 0 to p[i]-2 (so p[i]-1 times). So adding (p[i]-1) problems. So the total points added here would be 100*(i+1)*(p[i]-1). But the code is adding each step, so the loop runs p[i]-1 times, each time adding 100*(i+1). So total is 100*(i+1)*(p[i]-1). But why not just compute that directly? Because the code breaks early if the score reaches G.\n\nAh right, the code breaks the loop once the score reaches G. So it's possible that not all p[i]-1 are added. So in Fortran, we need to replicate that.\n\nHmm, this part might be a bit tricky. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, the loops can be written similarly. The first loop over all bits:\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\nthen, for each bit, compute score and solve_num.\n\nThen, if score < G, then loop over i from D-1 downto 0:\n\nif (bit has the ith bit not set), then:\n\ndo j=1 to p(i)-1 (since in Java it's p[i]-1 times, starting from 0 to p[i]-2, so p[i]-1 steps)\n\nthen add 100*(i+1) to score and increment solve_num each time. But break if score >= G.\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is:\n\nfor (int j=0; j < p[i]-1; j++) {\n\nso j runs from 0 to p[i]-2, which is p[i]-1 times. Each iteration adds 100*(i+1) to score and solve_num.\n\nBut in the code, after each addition, it checks if score >= G and breaks.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1  (assuming D is 1-based? Wait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to D-1. So in Fortran, perhaps the indices are 1-based, so need to adjust.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for the first part is:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < D; i++) {\n\nso in Fortran, if D is the number of days, then the indices would be 1 to D, but in the code, the problem uses 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays, but adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based in Fortran by declaring arrays from 0 to D-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use 0-based for the indices to match the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran, declare p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1), etc.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\ninteger, parameter :: D_max = 10  ! assuming D is up to 10\n\ninteger :: D, p(D_max), c(D_max), min_val, INF = 100000\n\ninteger(8) :: G, score\n\ninteger :: solve_num, bit, i, j\n\nThen, read D, G, then p and c arrays.\n\nThen, min_val is initialized to INF.\n\nThen loop over all bits from 0 to 2**D -1.\n\nFor each bit:\n\nscore =0\n\nsolve_num =0\n\ndo i=0, D-1\n\nif (btest(bit, i)) then\n\nscore = score + 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i)\n\nsolve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nif (score < G) then\n\n! need to add some more\n\ndo i = D-1, 0, -1\n\nif (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n\n! can add up to p(i)-1 problems from this set\n\ndo j=1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*(i+1)\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) exit\n\nend do\n\nif (score >= G) exit\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend if\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nif (solve_num < min_val) then\n\nmin_val = solve_num\n\nend if\n\nend if\n\nend do (over bits)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after adding each j, it breaks the loop if score >= G. So in the inner loop over j, once the score reaches G, it breaks out of the j loop and the i loop (due to the labeled loop 'loop' and break loop). So in Fortran, after adding each j, we check and exit the j loop, then exit the i loop as well.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nloop:\n\nfor (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--) {\n\nif (bit & (1<<i) ==0) {\n\nfor (j from 0 to p[i]-2) {\n\nscore += ... \n\nsolve_num +=...\n\nif (score >= G) break loop;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n}\n\nSo the break loop breaks out of the entire outer loop (the i loop). So in Fortran, after adding each j, if the score reaches G, we need to exit both loops.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, perhaps we can use a flag or a goto.\n\nAlternatively, after adding each j, check if score >= G, and if so, set a flag and break out of the loops.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop label and a goto.\n\nAlternatively, in the inner j loop, after adding, check and if so, exit the j loop and then exit the i loop.\n\nHmm, perhaps:\n\nIn the i loop:\n\ndo i = D-1 downto 0\n\nif (not set) then\n\ndo j=1 to p(i)-1\n\nadd to score and solve_num\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit the j loop\n\nexit the i loop\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exiting the i loop from inside the j loop requires a way to break out of both loops. One way is to use a flag.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop label and a goto.\n\nLet me think of code structure:\n\nIn the Java code, the outer loop is labeled 'loop', and the break loop; exits the entire loop.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n   if (not set) then\n\n      do j=1, p(i)-1\n\n         ... \n\n         if (score >= G) then\n\n             goto 100  ! jump to after the i loop\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n100 continue\n\nBut this requires a label. Alternatively, use a flag variable.\n\nAlternatively, after the j loop, check if the score is sufficient and break.\n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nOnce the score reaches G, we can break out of the i loop.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n   if (not btest(bit, i)) then\n\n      do j=1, p(i)-1\n\n         score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n         solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n         if (score >= G) then\n\n             exit  ! exit the j loop\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (score >= G) exit  ! exit the i loop\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this would only exit the i loop after processing the current i. Hmm, perhaps not exactly the same as Java's break loop.\n\nAlternatively, after the j loop, check if score >= G, and if so, exit the i loop.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the break loop breaks out of the entire i loop. So in Fortran, after adding each j, once the score is sufficient, we can exit both loops.\n\nSo in the j loop, after adding, check and if so, exit the j loop, then exit the i loop.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n   if (not btest(bit, i)) then\n\n      do j=1, p(i)-1\n\n         score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n         solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n         if (score >= G) then\n\n             exit  ! exit j loop\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (score >= G) exit  ! exit i loop\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, once the j loop exits early, the i loop also exits, so the rest of the i's are not processed. This should replicate the Java's behavior.\n\nOkay, that's manageable.\n\nNow, the second part's code.\n\nThe second part's input is the string representation of min_val.\n\nFirst, convert min_val to a string.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\n\nwrite(str_min, '(i0)') min_val\n\nstr_min = adjustl(str_min)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, the length is len_trim(str_min).\n\nThen, process the digits.\n\nThe digits array in Java is of length (number.length() +1). So in Fortran, we can have an array of size (0:len), where len is the length of the string.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(str_min)\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len) :: digits\n\ndigits = 0\n\nThen, fill the digits array:\n\ndo i = 0, len-1\n\n   ! the ith character in the string (starting from first character) corresponds to the (len -1 -i)th position in the string?\n\nWait, in Java, the code loops over i from 0 to number.length()-1, and for each i, the character is at position number.length() -1 -i.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"123\", then number.length() is 3. For i=0, the character is at 2 (since 3-1 -0 =2), which is '3', then i=1 gives 1, which is '2', and i=2 gives 0, which is '1'. So digits[0] =3, digits[1]=2, digits[2]=1, digits[3]=0 (since the array is length 4).\n\nIn Fortran, the string is stored as str_min, which is a character array. The first character is str_min(1), second str_min(2), etc.\n\nSo for the string \"123\", str_min(1) is '1', str_min(2) is '2', str_min(3) is '3'.\n\nWait, no, in Fortran, the string is stored in order. So the first character is the first digit. So to get the digits in reverse order (like in Java), we need to loop from the end of the string to the beginning.\n\nWait, in Java, the code is taking the characters from the end of the string to the beginning, so for \"123\", the digits array is [3,2,1,0].\n\nIn Fortran, to do the same:\n\nfor i from 0 to len-1:\n\ndigits(i) = ichar(str_min(len -i)) - ichar('0')\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nlen is the length of the string. For \"123\", len=3.\n\ni runs from 0 to 2 (since len-1 is 2).\n\nFor i=0: the character is str_min(len -i) \u2192 str_min(3) \u2192 '3'\n\ni=1 \u2192 str_min(2) \u2192 '2'\n\ni=2 \u2192 str_min(1) \u2192 '1'\n\nThus, digits(0)=3, digits(1)=2, digits(2)=1, and digits(3) remains 0 (since the array is 0:len, which is 0:3 for len=3).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i =0, len-1\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(str_min(len -i: len -i)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Fortran, to get the ith character from the end, the position is len -i. Because for i=0, it's the last character (position len), then i=1 is len-1, etc.\n\nWait, for \"123\", len=3:\n\ni=0 \u2192 position 3 \u2192 '3'\n\ni=1 \u2192 position 2 \u2192 '2'\n\ni=2 \u2192 position 1 \u2192 '1'\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the next loop in Java is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nIn Fortran, that would be:\n\ndo i =0, len\n\n   if (digits(i) == 10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array is 0:len. So when i reaches len, then i+1 would be len+1, which is beyond the array's upper bound (since digits is 0:len). So we need to make sure that digits has a size of 0:len, so digits(len+1) would be out of bounds. Wait, in the Java code, the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so for a length of 3, digits has indices 0 to 3 (since 3+1=4 elements). So in Fortran, the array is 0:len, where len is the original length. So when i is len, then i+1 is len+1, which is beyond the array's upper bound (since digits is 0:len). Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in Java, the digits array is declared as new int[number.length() +1], so for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements, indices 0 to L. So when i runs up to L (the length), then i+1 would be L+1, which is beyond the array's size. Wait, no, in the loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nso when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1, which is beyond the array's size (since the array is size number.length()+1, indices 0 to number.length().\n\nWait, in Java, the array is of size L+1 (where L is the string length). So the indices go from 0 to L. So when i is L, then i+1 is L+1, which is beyond the array's upper bound. That would be an error. Wait, but in the code, when i is L, then digits[i] is digits[L], and digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Java code analysis.\n\nWait, looking back at the second Java program's code:\n\ndigits is declared as new int[number.length() +1]. So for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements, indices 0 to L.\n\nThe loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 i runs from 0 to L (since number.length() is L, so i <= L \u2192 up to L).\n\nSo when i is L, then digits[i] is digits[L], and digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. That's a problem. Wait, but in the code, when i is L, the code is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 but digits[L] was initialized to 0 (since the array is initialized to 0). So perhaps the code is okay because when i is L, digits[i] can't be 10, but the code still tries to access digits[i+1], which is beyond the array.\n\nWait, this is a bug in the Java code? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the code again:\n\nThe digits array is initialized to all 0. Then, in the first loop, for i from 0 to L-1 (since the loop is for (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++)), so digits[0..L-1] are set, and digits[L] remains 0.\n\nThen, in the second loop, when i is L (the last index), the code does:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 digits[L] is 0, so no.\n\nThen, the next part:\n\nif (digits[i] <5 \u2192 yes, so add to bills.\n\nThen, the code proceeds. But when i is L, the code may have digits[i+1], which is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. Wait, but in Java, arrays are 0-based, so digits.length is L+1, so the maximum index is L. So when i is L, i+1 is L+1, which is beyond the array's size. So that's an error. Wait, but in the code, when i is L, the code may have:\n\nIn the case of digits[i] ==5, then:\n\nif (digits[i+1] >=5) \u2192 but digits[i+1] is out of bounds. So this is a bug in the Java code?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the second loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nso for a string of length L, the loop runs i from 0 to L (inclusive). The digits array has size L+1, so indices 0 to L. So when i is L, digits[i] is digits[L], and digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So this is an error. But the code must be correct, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that when i is L, the digits[i+1] is not accessed except in certain conditions. Let me look at the code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is incremented.\n\nElse if digits[i] <5 \u2192 add to bills.\n\nElse if digits[i] ==5 \u2192 check digits[i+1] and add 5.\n\nElse \u2192 digits[i+1] is incremented and add 10 - digits[i].\n\nWait, so when i is L (the last index), then digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So this is a bug. But the code must be correct, so perhaps I made a mistake in the array size.\n\nWait, perhaps the digits array is of size L+2, so that digits[L+1] exists. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code says:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() +1];\n\nSo for a string of length L, the array has L+1 elements (indices 0 to L). So when i is L, digits[i+1] is digits[L+1], which is out of bounds. So this is a bug. But the code must be correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that when i is L, the code doesn't access digits[i+1]. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is incremented.\n\nElse if digits[i] ==5 \u2192 then check digits[i+1] >=5 \u2192 but digits[i+1] is out of bounds.\n\nElse \u2192 digits[i+1] is incremented.\n\nSo in all cases except the first condition (digits[i] <5), when i is L, the code tries to access digits[i+1], which is out of bounds. So this is a bug. But the code must be correct, so perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i is L, digits[i] can't be 5 or more? Let's see:\n\nInitially, digits[L] is 0. Then, during the first loop, digits[L] is 0. Then, in the second loop, when i is L:\n\ndigits[i] is 0 (initially). So the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is false. Then, since 0 <5, it adds to bills. So no access to digits[i+1]. So in this case, it's okay.\n\nBut what if during processing, digits[L] is set to 10?\n\nWait, in the first part of the loop (the first if statement):\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is incremented, and digits[i] set to 0.\n\nSo for i = L, digits[i] could be 10, but then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code has a bug. But since the problem is from an AtCoder contest, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that when i reaches L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let's see:\n\nThe first loop in the second part's code:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n   if (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n      digits[i+1]++;\n\n      digits[i] =0;\n\n   }\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nSo for i from 0 to L (the length of the string), the code checks if digits[i] is 10. If so, it increments digits[i+1], but when i is L, digits[i+1] is out of bounds. So this is a bug. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that the digits array is of size L+2, so that digits[L+1] exists. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code says:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() +1];\n\nSo the size is L+1. So digits[L] is the last element. digits[L+1] is out of bounds. So this is a bug. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. But since the code is from a contest, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe the code is correct because when i reaches L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let's see:\n\nInitially, digits[L] is 0. \n\nIn the first loop (the for loop over i from 0 to L):\n\nSuppose during processing, digits[i] is set to 10. For example, in the first iteration (i=0), if digits[0] is 10, then digits[1] is incremented. But when i reaches L, digits[L] could be 10 only if it was set by a previous step. \n\nWait, but how could digits[L] be set to 10?\n\nSuppose in the first loop, when i is L-1, digits[L-1] is 10, then digits[L] is incremented. So digits[L] could be 1, but not 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because digits[i] can't reach 10 when i is L. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i is L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose the input is \"99\".\n\nThen, the digits array after the first loop (processing the string) would be:\n\ndigits[0] =9, digits[1]=9, digits[2]=0 (since the string length is 2, so digits has 3 elements).\n\nThen, in the second loop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9 \u2192 which is >5. So:\n\ndigits[1] is incremented (to 10), and bills += 1 (10-9=1).\n\nThen, digits[0] becomes 0 (since after the else clause, digits[i] is not set to 0, but in the first part of the loop (the first if statement), it's only set to 0 if it was 10.\n\nWait, the first part of the loop is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then set to 0 and increment next digit.\n\nSo in the first iteration (i=0), digits[0] is 9, so that condition is false.\n\nThen, since 9>5, we go to the else clause:\n\ndigits[i+1] (digits[1]) is incremented (from 9 to 10?), and bills += 1 (10-9=1).\n\nWait, no, the code in the else clause (digits[i] >5):\n\ndigits[i+1]++;\n\nbills += 10 - digits[i];\n\nSo in this case, digits[1] becomes 10, and bills +=1.\n\nThen, moving to i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is now 10. So the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is true.\n\nSo digits[2] (digits[1+1] = digits[2]) is incremented (from 0 to 1), and digits[1] is set to 0.\n\nThen, the rest of the code for this i=1:\n\nsince digits[i] is now 0, the next condition (digits[i] <5) is true, so add 0 to bills.\n\nThen, i=2 (since L is 2, the string length is 2):\n\ndigits[2] is now 1.\n\nSo for i=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 1 <5 \u2192 add 1 to bills.\n\nThen, i=2 is the last iteration (since L=2, the loop runs up to i=2).\n\nThus, total bills would be 1 (from i=0) +0 (i=1) +1 (i=2) \u2192 total 2.\n\nWait, but let's see what the code would do for the input \"99\".\n\nThe code's output would be 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. But the point is, in the case where i is L (the last index), the code may access digits[i+1], which is out of bounds. But in the example above, when i=2 (L=2), digits[i+1] is digits[3], which is beyond the array's size (since digits has size 3, indices 0-2). So this is a bug.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is actually of size L+2, but the code declares it as L+1. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the code's translation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let me see:\n\nIn the example above, when i=2 (L=2), digits[2] is 1. So the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is false. So the code doesn't access digits[i+1].\n\nBut in another scenario where digits[L] is 10, then accessing digits[L+1] would be out of bounds.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is actually of size L+2. Let me recheck the code:\n\nThe code says:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() +1];\n\nSo for L=2, it's size 3. So digits[2] is the last element. digits[3] is out of bounds.\n\nThus, the code has a bug. But since this is a contest problem, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let's see:\n\nThe first time digits[i] can be 10 is when it's set by the first part of the loop (digits[i] was 10, so it's set to 0 and the next digit is incremented). But when i is L, the next digit is L+1, which is out of bounds. So this is a bug.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct because the loop is written as i <= number.length(), but the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so the maximum i is number.length(), which is the last index. Thus, digits[i+1] is only accessed when i < number.length(). \n\nWait, in the first part of the loop (if digits[i] ==10):\n\ndigits[i+1] is incremented. So when i is number.length(), then i+1 is number.length()+1, which is beyond the array's size. So this is a bug.\n\nThis suggests that the code has an error, but since it's from a contest, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the problem's constraints ensure that digits[i] can't be 10 when i is the last index. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches the last index, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the input is \"10\".\n\nThen, the digits array after the first loop (processing the string \"10\"):\n\nThe string is \"10\", length 2. digits array is size 3 (indices 0,1,2).\n\nProcessing the first loop (i from 0 to 1):\n\ni=0: the first character from the end is '0' \u2192 digits[0] =0.\n\ni=1: the second character from the end is '1' \u2192 digits[1] =1.\n\ndigits[2] is 0.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 to bills.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 to bills (total 1).\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0.\n\nTotal bills is 1.\n\nBut what if digits[2] is 10?\n\nSuppose in some case, digits[2] is 10. Then, when i=2 (L=2), the first condition is true, and digits[3] is accessed, which is out of bounds.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is actually of size L+2, but the code declares it as L+1. Or perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches L, the digits[i] can't be 10. Let me see:\n\nThe only way digits[i] can be 10 is if it was set by the first part of the loop (when digits[i] was 10, so it's set to 0 and the next digit is incremented). But when i is L, the next digit is L+1, which is out of bounds. So this can't happen. \n\nWait, the first time digits[i] is set to 10 is when it's incremented from a previous digit. For example, if digits[i] was 9, and then digits[i+1] is incremented. But when i is L, digits[i+1] is out of bounds, so that can't happen. Thus, digits[L] can only be set to 10 if it was set by a previous step, but that would require accessing digits[L+1], which is impossible. Thus, digits[L] can never be 10. So the code is safe.\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because the only way digits[i] can become 10 is if it was set by the first part of the loop (when digits[i] was 10, so it's set to 0 and the next digit is incremented). But for i = L, the next digit is L+1, which is out of bounds. Thus, digits[L] can never be set to 10, because that would require incrementing digits[L+1], which is impossible. Thus, the first condition (digits[i] ==10) will never be true when i is L. So the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the digits array must be of size 0 to len (where len is the length of the string), so digits(0:len). Thus, when i is len (the last index), digits(i+1) would be digits(len+1), which is out of bounds. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if I declare digits as 0:len, then the indices are 0 to len. So digits(len+1) is out of bounds. But in the code, when i is len (the last index), the code may try to access digits(i+1), which is digits(len+1), which is out of bounds. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, so to avoid this, perhaps in Fortran, the digits array should be of size 0 to len+1, so that digits(len+1) exists. \n\nWait, the original Java code's digits array is of size L+1 (for L being the string length). So in Fortran, to replicate that, the array should be of size 0 to L (since L is the string length). But when i is L (the last index), the code may try to access digits(L+1), which is out of bounds. So to prevent this, the array should be of size 0 to L+1, so that digits(L+1) exists.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nlen = len_trim(str_min)\n\nallocate(digits(0:len+1))\n\ndigits = 0\n\nThen, when processing the digits array, the loop runs from i=0 to len (since the original Java loop runs up to number.length(), which is L, and the array is L+1 in size, but in Fortran, with the array size 0 to L+1, the loop can go up to L.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nIn Java:\n\ndigits has size L+1 (indices 0 to L).\n\nThe loop runs i from 0 to L (inclusive).\n\nIn Fortran, to have the same behavior, the array should be of size 0 to L+1 (so that digits(L+1) exists). Thus:\n\ndigits(0:L+1)\n\nThen, the loop runs i from 0 to L (since L is the original string length).\n\nThus, when i is L, digits(i+1) is digits(L+1), which is within the array's bounds.\n\nThis way, the code can handle the case where digits[i] is 10 when i is L.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nlen = len_trim(str_min)\n\nallocate(digits(0:len+1))\n\ndigits = 0\n\nThen, fill the digits array as before:\n\ndo i =0, len-1\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(str_min(len -i: len -i)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ndo i =0, len\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, when i is len (the original string length), digits(i+1) is digits(len+1), which is within the array's bounds.\n\nThus, this should handle the case correctly.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n1. Read D, G, then p and c arrays.\n\n2. Compute min_val as per the first part.\n\n3. Convert min_val to a string.\n\n4. Process the string through the second part's algorithm.\n\n5. Output the bills.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: D, INF = 100000, i, j, bit, solve_num, min_val\n\ninteger(8) :: G, score\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: p, c\n\n! Read input for first part\n\nread*, D, G\n\nallocate(p(0:D-1), c(0:D-1))\n\ndo i=0, D-1\n\n   read*, p(i), c(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute min_val\n\nmin_val = INF\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\n   score =0\n\n   solve_num =0\n\n   do i=0, D-1\n\n      if (btest(bit, i)) then\n\n         score = score + 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i)\n\n         solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (score < G) then\n\n      do i = D-1, 0, -1\n\n         if (.not. btest(bit, i)) then\n\n            do j=1, p(i)-1\n\n               score = score + 100*(i+1)\n\n               solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n               if (score >= G) exit\n\n            end do\n\n            if (score >= G) exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   if (score >= G) then\n\n      if (solve_num < min_val) then\n\n         min_val = solve_num\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now process the second part\n\n! Convert min_val to string\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\n\nwrite(str_min, '(i0)') min_val\n\nstr_min = adjustl(str_min)\n\ninteger :: len = len_trim(str_min)\n\ninteger :: bills =0\n\ninteger, dimension(0:len+1) :: digits\n\ndigits =0\n\n! Fill digits array\n\ndo i=0, len-1\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(str_min(len -i: len -i)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\n! Process digits\n\ndo i=0, len\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output the bills\n\nprint*, bills\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's processing, after the first if (digits(i) ==10), we set digits(i) to 0 and increment digits(i+1). But then, in the subsequent conditions (digits(i) <5 etc.), digits(i) is now 0, so it will be added to bills.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs would be good, but since I can't run it now, I'll proceed.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's loop over bits may have an overflow for large D. But assuming D is small (like up to 10), it's okay.\n\n- The conversion of min_val to a string must be correct. Using write and adjustl should work.\n\n- The digits array in the second part must be properly sized and initialized.\n\n- The loop in the second part must correctly handle all cases.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the second part's code, after the first if (digits(i) ==10), the code proceeds to the other conditions. But since digits(i) is now 0, it will be handled in the next condition (digits(i) <5).\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
