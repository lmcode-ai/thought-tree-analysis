In Fortran, 10**i is okay, but for i=0, 10^0 is 1. But in the code, when i is 1, 10^(i-1) is 10^0 =1, so 10^i -10^(i-1) is 10-1=9, which matches the 9 added for i=1. Wait, let's see: For i from 1 to count:\n\nCase when i is not the last (i < count):\n\n   if i ==1: add 9 (since numbers 1-9 have 1 digit, which is odd)\n\n   else if i is odd: add (10^i -10^{i-1}), which is 9*10^{i-1} numbers (since numbers from 10^{i-1} to 10^i -1 have exactly i digits, and since i is odd, they count). When i is the last (i=count):\n\n   if count is odd, then add (N - 10^{count-1} +1). Because numbers from 10^{count-1} up to N (since N has count digits) contribute. But need to ensure that N is at least 10^{count-1}, otherwise, if N is less than 10^{count-1}, then the count would be 0 for that term. But in the code, since count is the number of digits of N, then N is at least 10^{count-1} (since for example, if count=3, N is between 100 and 999). So the term is valid. But in Fortran, when N is negative, count is 0, so the loop doesn't run, so ans remains 0. Now, putting all together. The Fortran program will:\n\n1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_242_B). It reads an integer n, then for each of n lines, it reads two integers a and b. It tracks the minimum of all a's (left) and the maximum of all b's (right). Then it loops through the pairs again to check if any pair has a equal to left and b equal to right. If found, it prints the index (i+1, since Java uses 0-based but the output is i+1?), and exits. If none found, prints -1.\n\nWait, in the loop, the code is for (int i=0; i <n; i++) and checks if a[i] is left and b[i] is right. If so, it prints ++i. Wait, that's a bit tricky. Because if the condition is true, it increments i and then prints it. But since the loop is 0-based, the actual index (1-based) would be i+1. Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the correct index is i (0-based), then the output is ++i? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose i is the current loop variable. The code says:\n\nif (left == a.get(i) && right == b.get(i)) {\n    System.out.println(++i);\n    return;\n}\n\nWait, the ++i is pre-increment. So if the condition is true at i=0, then it increments to 1 and prints 1. But the actual index (since the first element is 0) would be 0, so the output is 1. So the output is 1-based. So the first program's output is the 1-based index of the first element that has a equal to the minimum a and b equal to the maximum b. If none, output -1.\n\nSo the first program's output is an integer, either the 1-based index or -1.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC136_B) takes an integer N and calculates some count. Let me see what it does.\n\nThe second program counts the number of integers from 1 to N that have an odd number of digits. Wait, let me parse the code.\n\nThe code first counts the number of digits in N (count). Then loops over each digit position from 1 to count. For each i (digit count):\n\n- If it's the last digit count (i=count), then if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1) to ans. Because numbers from 10^(i-1) to N have exactly i digits, and if i is odd, they contribute.\n\n- Else, for other i's:\n\n   if i is 1: add 9 (numbers 1-9 have 1 digit, which is odd)\n   else if i is odd: add (10^i - 10^(i-1)), which is the numbers with exactly i digits (since 10^(i-1) to 10^i -1, so total 9*10^{i-1} numbers, which for odd i contribute.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe for loop runs for each digit count from 1 to count (the number of digits in N). For each i (digit count):\n\n- If it's the last digit (i=count):\n\n   if i is odd, then the numbers from 10^{i-1} to N are all i-digit numbers, so the count is N - 10^{i-1} +1 (since inclusive). So add that to ans.\n\n- Else (i is not the last digit):\n\n   if i is 1: add 9 (since 1-digit numbers from 1-9)\n   else if i is odd: add (10^i - 10^{i-1}), which is the total numbers with exactly i digits (since 10^{i-1} to 10^i -1, so 9*10^{i-1} numbers). Since i is odd, they all count.\n\nSo the total ans is the sum of all numbers with an odd number of digits up to N.\n\nSo the second program's output is the count of numbers from 1 to N with an odd number of digits.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two programs. The first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output (either -1 or some index) is the N for the second program.\n\nWait, but the second program expects N as input. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the entire sequence is:\n\nInput to first program \u2192 first's output \u2192 second's input \u2192 second's output is the final result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process it through both steps, and output the second's result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n followed by n pairs of a and b).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the index or -1).\n\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program (so that becomes N in the second program).\n\n4. Compute the second program's result based on that N.\n\n5. Output the second's result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (the first Java program's logic).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, the a and b arrays are 0-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nFirst program steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n pairs of integers a_i and b_i. Store them in arrays (say, a and b, both of size n).\n\nCompute left as the minimum of all a_i, right as the maximum of all b_i.\n\nThen loop through each i from 1 to n (since Fortran is 1-based), check if a(i) == left and b(i) == right. The first such i (1-based) is the output. If none, output -1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is 0-based, but the output is i+1 (since ++i would be i+1, but the code is a bit tricky). Wait, let me re-examine the Java code's loop:\n\nOriginal Java code's loop for checking:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (left == a.get(i) && right == b.get(i)) {\n        System.out.println(++i);\n        return;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the code increments i before printing. Wait, no, the ++i is pre-increment. So when the condition is true, it increments i by 1, then prints it. But the loop is over i from 0 to n-1. So for example, if the first element (i=0) meets the condition, then ++i becomes 1, so the output is 1. Which is correct because the first element is index 0 in Java, but the output is 1-based. So the code is correct in that.\n\nBut in the loop, after incrementing i, the return is called, so the loop doesn't proceed. So the first occurrence where a[i] is left and b[i] is right (0-based) will output i+1 (since i was 0-based, so 0 becomes 1, etc).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, the loop would be from 1 to n. So for each i in 1..n, check if a(i) == left and b(i) == right. The first such i is the output (since it's 1-based). So no need to adjust, just return i. So the first program's output is the first i (1-based) where a(i) is the minimum a and b(i) is the maximum b. If none, output -1.\n\nSo the first part's result is either -1 or the 1-based index.\n\nNow, the second program takes that result as N. But what if the first program outputs -1? Then the second program would take N = -1, but the second program expects N to be a positive integer. Wait, but in the original Java code, the second program's input is read via stdIn.nextInt(), so if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would read that as N = -1, but then the code would process it. Let's see what happens in that case.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe second program's code starts with:\n\nint N = stdIn.nextInt();\n\nThen, temp = N, and counts the number of digits. But if N is negative, then temp becomes negative, and the loop temp /=10 would eventually reach 0, but the count would be 0. Then the for loop runs from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute. So the ans remains 0, and the output is 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose N is -1:\n\ncount is computed as follows:\n\ntemp = N = -1\n\ncount =0\n\nloop while temp>0: since temp is -1, the loop doesn't run. So count remains 0.\n\nThen the for loop is for i=1 to count (0), which doesn't execute. So ans is 0. So the second program would output 0.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, if the first program outputs -1, the second program's N is -1, leading to output 0.\n\nSo the Fortran program must handle that.\n\nNow, translating the first program's logic into Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n pairs of a and b.\n\nCompute left as the minimum of a array, right as the maximum of b array.\n\nLoop through each element (i from 1 to n):\n\n   if a(i) == left and b(i) == right, then set the result to i and exit the loop.\n\nIf none found, result is -1.\n\nThen, pass this result to the second program's logic.\n\nNow, the second program's logic in Fortran:\n\nGiven N (the result from first program), compute the count of numbers from 1 to N with an odd number of digits.\n\nWait, but if N is negative, like -1, then the count is 0 as discussed.\n\nSo steps for second part:\n\nCompute the number of digits in N (count). But need to handle N negative.\n\nWait, in the second Java program, N is read as an integer, which can be negative. But the code counts numbers from 1 to N, but if N is negative, then the count is 0. Because numbers from 1 to N (if N is negative) would be none. So the code's logic would handle that.\n\nSo in Fortran, first, we need to compute the number of digits in N. But if N is negative, then the absolute value is taken? Or the code would treat it as 0 digits?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the second program's code for counting digits:\n\ntemp = N (could be negative)\n\ncount =0\n\nwhile (temp>0):\n\n   temp /=10\n\n   count++\n\nWait, no, the code is:\n\ntemp = N\n\ncount =0\n\nwhile (temp >0) {\n\n   temp /=10\n\n   count++;\n\n}\n\nSo if N is negative, temp is negative, so the loop doesn't run. count remains 0.\n\nThus, the code treats N as a positive number? Or not. So for N negative, the count is 0, and the for loop runs from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute, so ans is 0.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code must handle N as given (could be negative), and compute the digits count as per the Java code.\n\nSo in Fortran, to compute the number of digits:\n\nWe can take the absolute value of N, but only if N is positive. Wait, but in the code, if N is negative, the loop doesn't run, so count is 0. So in Fortran, to replicate that, we can do:\n\ncount = 0\n\ntemp = N\n\nif (temp <=0) then\n\n   count =0\n\nelse\n\n   do while (temp >0)\n\n      temp = temp /10\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Java, the division is integer division. In Fortran, integer division is done with /, but for negative numbers, it's different. Wait, but in the code, temp is N, which could be negative, but the loop only runs if temp>0. So in Fortran, same logic.\n\nSo the code for counting digits:\n\ntemp = N\n\ncount =0\n\nif (temp <=0) then\n\n   count =0\n\nelse\n\n   do while (temp >0)\n\n      temp = temp /10\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nOnce count is known, then compute ans.\n\nThen, the ans is computed as follows:\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, count\n\n   if (i == count) then\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but need to be careful with exponents. In Fortran, 10**i is okay, but for i=0, 10^0 is 1. But in the code, when i is 1, 10^(i-1) is 10^0 =1, so 10^i -10^(i-1) is 10-1=9, which matches the 9 added for i=1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor i from 1 to count:\n\nCase when i is not the last (i < count):\n\n   if i ==1: add 9 (since numbers 1-9 have 1 digit, which is odd)\n\n   else if i is odd: add (10^i -10^{i-1}), which is 9*10^{i-1} numbers (since numbers from 10^{i-1} to 10^i -1 have exactly i digits, and since i is odd, they count).\n\nWhen i is the last (i=count):\n\n   if count is odd, then add (N - 10^{count-1} +1). Because numbers from 10^{count-1} up to N (since N has count digits) contribute.\n\nBut need to ensure that N is at least 10^{count-1}, otherwise, if N is less than 10^{count-1}, then the count would be 0 for that term. But in the code, since count is the number of digits of N, then N is at least 10^{count-1} (since for example, if count=3, N is between 100 and 999). So the term is valid.\n\nBut in Fortran, when N is negative, count is 0, so the loop doesn't run, so ans remains 0.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n, then read n pairs of a and b.\n\n2. Compute left and right.\n\n3. Find the first index (1-based) where a(i) == left and b(i) == right. If found, that's the N for the second part. Else, N is -1.\n\n4. Compute the second part's answer based on N.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. Let's see:\n\nWe can declare a and b as arrays of size n. But in Fortran, we need to know the size at compile time, but since n is read from input, we can use an allocatable array.\n\nAlternatively, since the first program's n can be up to, say, 1e5 or whatever, but in Fortran, we can read n first, then allocate arrays.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate arrays a and b of size n.\n\nRead n pairs of integers into a and b.\n\nCompute left and right.\n\nFind the first i (1-based) where a(i) == left and b(i) == right. If found, set N = i. Else, N = -1.\n\nThen compute the second part's answer using N.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, left, right, N, count, temp, ans, digit_count, current_i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n!

Now loop over i from 1 to count\n\n   ans =0\n\n   do current_i =1, count\n\n      if (current_i == count) then\n\n         if (mod(current_i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (N - 10**(current_i-1) +1)\n\n         end if\n\n      else\n\n         if (current_i ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans +9\n\n         else if (mod(current_i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (10**current_i - 10**(current_i-1))\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\n! Output the ans\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\ndeallocate(a,b)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check some parts.\n\nFirst, in the first part, initializing left and right:\n\nInitially, left is set to a(1), right to b(1). Then loop from 2 to n. That's correct.\n\nThen, the loop to find N: starts at i=1, checks each a(i) and b(i). The first occurrence where a(i) is left and b(i) is right, sets N to i and exits. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nIf N is -1 (from first part's output), then the second part's N is -1, so the code sets ans=0.\n\nElse, proceed to compute the digits.\n\nWait, in the code above, the 'if (N <=0)' is because N can be -1 (so N <=0) or N=0 (but in first part, N is either -1 or 1-based index (so >=1). So N can only be -1 or >=1. So the condition N <=0 is equivalent to N ==-1.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, in the code for the second part:\n\nThe code for counting digits is correct.\n\nThen, the loop over current_i from 1 to count.\n\nWait, in the code, current_i is the digit count. For each digit count (i=current_i):\n\nIf it's the last digit count (current_i == count):\n\n   if current_i is odd, add (N - 10^{current_i-1} +1). Because numbers from 10^{current_i-1} to N (since N has count digits, so it's >=10^{count-1}).\n\nElse (not last):\n\n   if current_i is 1: add 9.\n\n   else if current_i is odd: add 10^current_i -10^{current_i-1}.\n\nWait, but in the code, the exponent is written as 10**current_i. But in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, 10**0 is 1, so for current_i=1, 10^(current_i-1) is 10^0 =1, so 10^current_i is 10^1=10. So 10^current_i -10^{current_i-1} is 10-1=9, which matches the 9 added for i=1.\n\nWait, but in the code, for current_i=1, the code adds 9, which is the same as (10^1 -10^0) =9. So the code could be simplified, but the original code's logic is followed.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nFirst program's input:\n\n3\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\n1 4\n\nThe a array is [1,2,1], so left is 1.\n\nb array is [3,2,4], so right is 4.\n\nLooking for a(i)=1 and b(i)=4. The third element (i=3) has a=1 and b=4. So N is 3.\n\nThen the second program's N is 3. The count of numbers from 1-3 with odd digits (all have 1 digit, which is odd). So ans is 3.\n\nThe code should output 3.\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs -1:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n5 10\n\n6 9\n\nLeft is 5, right is 10. The first element has a=5 and b=10, so it matches. So N is 1. Then the second program's N=1, which has 1 digit (odd). So ans is 1 (since 1-10^0 +1 =1-1+1=1? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait N=1, count is 1 (since 1 has 1 digit).\n\nIn the loop for current_i=1 (which is the last digit count):\n\nsince current_i is 1 (odd), add (1 -10^0 +1) =1-1+1=1. So ans is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where first program outputs -1:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n5 10\n\n5 9\n\nLeft is 5, right is 10. The first element has a=5 and b=10, so N is 1. So second program's N=1, which gives ans 1.\n\nAnother case where first program outputs -1:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n5 9\n\n6 10\n\nLeft is 5, right is 10. Neither has a=5 and b=10. So N is -1. Then second program's N is -1, so ans is 0.\n\nAnother test case for second program when N is 0:\n\nWait, but first program can't output 0. The first program's N is either -1 or 1-based index (so 1 to n). So N=0 is not possible.\n\nAnother test case for second program with N=9:\n\ncount is 1 (since 9 has 1 digit). So the loop runs for current_i=1 (last digit). Since 1 is odd, add (9 -10^0 +1) =9-1+1=9. So ans is 9. Which is correct (all 1-digit numbers from 1-9).\n\nAnother test case N=11:\n\ncount is 2 digits. So loop runs for i=1 and 2.\n\ni=1 (not last):\n\nsince i=1 is odd, add 9 (from first part).\n\ni=2 (last digit count, which is 2 even). So no addition for the last term. So total ans is 9.\n\nWait, but N=11 has 2 digits (even), so numbers with odd digits up to 11 are numbers with 1 digit (1-9) \u2192 9 numbers. So correct.\n\nAnother test case N= 100:\n\ncount is 3 digits (odd). So:\n\ni=1: add 9 (since first digit count is 1, not last).\n\ni=2: not last, even (so no addition).\n\ni=3 (last, which is odd):\n\nadd (100 - 10^(2) +1) \u2192 100-100 +1 =1 \u2192 total ans is 9 +1 =10?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait for N=100:\n\nThe numbers with odd digits are 1-digit (1-9 \u21929), 3-digit numbers (100 has 3 digits, which is odd. So numbers from 100 to 100 (since N=100). So 1 number. So total 9+1=10. Correct.\n\nYes, so the code would compute:\n\ni=1: add 9 (since i=1 is first, not last, and i=1 is odd \u2192 yes, so 9 added.\n\ni=2: not last, even \u2192 no addition.\n\ni=3 (last, which is odd):\n\nadd (100 -10^(2) +1) \u2192 100-100 +1 =1 \u2192 total 9+1=10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the exponentiation operator is **. So 10**i is okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, when N is 0, but in our case, N can't be 0 except when first program outputs -1, but in that case, the code handles it.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code above, after computing N, the code checks if N <=0 (i.e., N is -1). Then sets ans=0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, in the code for the second part, when N is positive, the code computes the digits count.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nThe loop variable is current_i, which is from 1 to count.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif current_i == count:\n\n   if odd, add (N - 10^{current_i-1} +1)\n\nelse:\n\n   if current_i ==1 \u2192 add 9\n\n   else if current_i is odd \u2192 add (10^current_i - 10^{current_i-1})\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the code must use integer arithmetic. The exponents may be large, but in Fortran, integers can be large enough (assuming 32-bit or 64-bit integers). But for N up to 1e9 (since first program's N is up to n, which could be up to 1e5?), but the second program's N is the first's output, which is up to n (the first program's n). But the second program's N can be up to n, which could be large, but the exponents are manageable.\n\nWait, in the first program, the first program's N (the output) is the index (1-based) of the element. So the maximum possible N is n. So if n is up to 1e5, then the second program's N can be up to 1e5, so the maximum exponent is for 5 digits (1e5 has 5 digits). So 10^5 is 100000, which is manageable in 32-bit integers (since 2^31 is about 2e9). So no problem.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code for the second part, when N is positive, the code computes count as the number of digits of N.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ntemp = N\n\ncount =0\n\nif (temp <=0) then \u2192 but N is positive here (since we are in the else clause of N>0).\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (N <=0) then \u2192 which is N ==-1 \u2192 set ans=0.\n\nElse:\n\n   temp = N\n\n   count =0\n\n   if (temp <=0) \u2192 but temp is N which is positive \u2192 so the else clause is taken.\n\n   So the code proceeds to count the digits.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop:\n\nThe code uses current_i as the loop variable. The code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, left, right, N, count, temp, ans, current_i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n! Read first part's input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n))\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   read(*,*) a(i), b(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute left and right\n\nleft = a(1)\n\nright = b(1)\n\ndo i =2, n\n\n   if (a(i) < left) then\n\n      left = a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (b(i) > right) then\n\n      right = b(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Find the first index where a(i) == left and b(i) == right\n\nN = -1\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (a(i) == left .and. b(i) == right) then\n\n      N = i\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Compute the second part's answer using N\n\nans =0\n\nif (N <=0) then\n\n   ans =0\n\nelse\n\n   ! Compute the number of digits in N\n\n   temp = N\n\n   count =0\n\n   if (temp <=0) then\n\n      count =0\n\n   else\n\n      do while (temp >0)\n\n         temp = temp /10\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   ans =0\n\n   do current_i =1, count\n\n      if (current_i == count) then\n\n         if (mod(current_i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (N - 10**(current_i-1) +1)\n\n         end if\n\n      else\n\n         if (current_i ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans +9\n\n         else if (mod(current_i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (10**current_i - 10**(current_i-1))\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\n! Output the ans\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\ndeallocate(a,b)\n\nend program main\n\nThis should be the correct code.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- In the first part, when n=0? But the problem probably assumes n is at least 1. But in the code, if n=0, then the first loop (i=2 to n) won't run. left and right would be a(1) and b(1), but since n=0, the arrays are of size 0. But in Fortran, allocating a(0) may be allowed, but reading into them would be an error. However, the problem's original Java code probably expects n \u22651, so we can assume that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when there are multiple elements meeting the condition, the code picks the first occurrence (smallest i), which is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, when N is 0 (but first program can't output that).\n\nAnother possible issue with exponents: in Fortran, 10**0 is 1, which is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the first example where N=3 (from first part):\n\ncount is 1 (since 3 has 1 digit).\n\nLoop current_i=1 (which is count):\n\nsince current_i is odd, add (3 -10^0 +1) \u21923-1+1=3 \u2192 ans=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where N=10 (second program's N=10):\n\ncount is 2 digits.\n\nLoop current_i=1 (not last):\n\ni=1 is odd \u2192 add 9.\n\ncurrent_i=2 (last, even \u2192 no addition. So total 9. But numbers with odd digits up to 10 are 1-9 (9 numbers). Correct.\n\nAnother test case N=11 (count=2):\n\ncurrent_i=1 (not last, odd \u2192 add 9.\n\ncurrent_i=2 (last, even \u2192 no addition. So total 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case N=99 (count=2):\n\nsame as above \u21929.\n\nN=100 (count=3):\n\ncurrent_i=1: add 9.\n\ncurrent_i=2: not last, even \u2192 no.\n\ncurrent_i=3 (last, odd \u2192 add (100 -100 +1)=1 \u2192 total 10. Correct.\n\nAll seems okay.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work."
