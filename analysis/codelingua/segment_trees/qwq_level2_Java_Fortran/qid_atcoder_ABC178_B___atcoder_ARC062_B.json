    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC178_B. The main method reads four long integers, then calculates the maximum of four possible products: a[0]*a[2], a[1]*a[3], a[0]*a[3], a[1]*a[2]. It prints the maximum of these. So the output of this first program is that maximum value.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ARC062_B, takes a string S as input. It then calculates a score based on each character in S. The rule is: for each position i, if i is even (0-based?), the expected character is 'g', else 'p'. Wait, the code says i%2 ==0 ? 'g' : 'p'. So for even indices (starting at 0), it's 'g', odd indices 'p'. Then, if the actual character (his) doesn't match the expected (my), the score changes. If my was 'p', add 1, else subtract 1. Wait, the code says: if my != his, then score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, when my is 'g' (even index), and his is different, then my is 'g', so my == 'p' is false, so add -1? Or wait, the code is: if my != his, then add 1 if my was 'p', else subtract 1. Wait, the code is:\n\nif (my != his) {\n    score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even index), and the character is different, then the contribution is -1. When my is 'p' (odd index), and different, then +1. So the total score is the sum over all characters where the actual character differs from the expected, with the difference contributing +1 or -1 based on the expected character.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think. The problem might be from a programming contest, perhaps the score is calculated as the number of times the opponent's choice was different from the expected, but with some scoring. Maybe the problem is about a game where each player chooses 'g' or 'p', and the score is determined by their choices. But the exact details might not matter here; the code is the key.\n\nSo the second program takes a string S, processes it as per the above logic, and outputs the score.\n\nNow, the original setup is that the first Java program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (the maximum product), which is then used as the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string S as input. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the first program outputs a number, but the second program expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program's InputReader: in the solve method, it calls S = in.next(); which reads a token. So the input to the second program is a single string, which is the next token. But the first program's output is a number. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string? For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program's input is the string \"123\", and the code would process each character of that string. So the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is a number, so the input to the second program is that number as a string. So the second program's S is the string representation of the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is: take input for first program (four numbers), compute the max product, output that number. Then, that number is the input to the second program, which treats it as a string S, and calculates the score based on each character in that string.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the four numbers, compute the max product, then process that product as a string to compute the score, then output the final score.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read four integers (or longs, but in Java they are long, but in Fortran, maybe integers are sufficient? Well, the first program uses long, but the output is a long, but when passed as a string to the second program, the actual value's digits are what matter. So in Fortran, we can read them as integers, but perhaps as 64-bit integers if needed, but maybe even 32-bit is enough since the problem might not have very big numbers. But for the purpose of the code, perhaps just using integers is okay, but let's see.\n\nWait, the first Java program uses nextLong(), so the input can be up to 2^63-1, but in Fortran, integers might be 32 or 64 bits depending on the compiler. To be safe, perhaps use 64-bit integers. But in Fortran, the kind parameter can be specified. Let's see.\n\nBut the key is that the first step is to compute the maximum of the four products. Let's see:\n\nThe first program's code:\n\nlong[] a = new long[4];\nfor (int i =0; i<4; i++) a[i] = in.nextLong();\nSystem.out.println( Math.max(a[0]*a[2], Math.max(a[1]*a[3], Math.max(a[0]*a[3], a[1]*a[2]))));\n\nSo the output is the maximum of the four possible products of pairs of the four numbers. So in Fortran, we can read four integers (or 64-bit integers), compute the products, find the maximum, then proceed.\n\nThen, the second step is to take that maximum value (as a string) and compute the score as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read four numbers (as input, from the user, since the first Java program reads input).\n\n- Compute the maximum product.\n\n- Convert that maximum into a string (so that each character can be processed).\n\n- Then, process each character in that string as per the second program's logic.\n\n- Finally, output the resulting score.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input: in Fortran, we can read four integers. Let's assume they are 64-bit integers. In Fortran, integers can be declared with selected_int_kind. Let's see:\n\nWe can use integer(8) variables (since 8 bytes is 64 bits) to hold the four numbers. Let's say:\n\ninteger(8) :: a(4)\n\nThen, read them from input. The first program's input is four space-separated longs. So in Fortran, we can read them with read(*,*) a.\n\nThen compute the products:\n\nproduct1 = a(1)*a(3)  (since arrays are 1-based in Fortran)\nproduct2 = a(2)*a(4)\nproduct3 = a(1)*a(4)\nproduct4 = a(2)*a(3)\n\nmax_val = max(product1, product2, product3, product4)\n\nThen, convert max_val to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') max_val\n\nBut we need to make sure that the string is properly trimmed, as the write statement might pad with spaces. Alternatively, we can use adjustl to left-adjust the string.\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nThen, process each character in s.\n\nThe second part's logic is:\n\nInitialize score to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the string S (the converted max_val):\n\nfor i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\n   current_char = s(i:i)\n\n   expected_char: if i is odd (since in Java, the indices start at 0, so in the Java code, for position 0 (first character), it's even, so 'g'; in Fortran, the first character is index 1, so for i=1 (odd), it's even in Java's terms? Wait, need to be careful here.\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the loop is for (int i =0; i < S.length(); i++). So the first character is index 0 (even), so expected 'g'; second character (index 1, odd) expected 'p', etc.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is 1-based. So for the first character (i=1 in Fortran), which corresponds to i=0 in Java, so expected 'g'. So in Fortran, the loop variable i runs from 1 to len_trim(s). For each i:\n\nif (i mod 2 == 1) then  (since 1 is odd, which corresponds to Java's even index (0-based)), so expected 'g'\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i (0-based):\n\nif i is even (0,2,4,...) \u2192 expected 'g'\n\nif i is odd (1,3,5,...) \u2192 expected 'p'\n\nIn Fortran, the position is 1-based. So for Fortran's i (starting at 1):\n\nJava's index = i-1.\n\nSo when Fortran's i is 1 \u2192 Java's 0 \u2192 even \u2192 'g'\n\nFortran's i is 2 \u2192 Java's 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 'p'\n\nSo the condition in Fortran is:\n\nif (mod(i,2) ==1) then \u2192 expected 'g'\n\nelse \u2192 'p'\n\nSo for each character in the string s (from 1 to len_trim(s)):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if i is odd, else 'p'\n\ncurrent_char is s(i:i)\n\nif current_char /= my_char, then:\n\nif my_char is 'g', then the contribution is -1 (because my is 'g', so my == 'p' is false \u2192 so the code adds -1)\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif (my != his) \u2192 then:\n\nscore += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1\n\nSo when my is 'g', then the contribution is -1. When my is 'p', contribution is +1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (current_char /= my_char) then\n\n   if (my_char == 'g') then\n\n      score = score -1\n\n   else\n\n      score = score +1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\n   determine my_char based on i's parity.\n\n   compare to current_char.\n\n   adjust score accordingly.\n\nOnce all characters are processed, output the score.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer(8) :: a(4), product1, product2, product3, product4, max_val\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: i, len_s, score\n\n   !

Compute the products\n\n   product1 = a(1)*a(3)\n\n   product2 = a(2)*a(4)\n\n   product3 = a(1)*a(4)\n\n   product4 = a(2)*a(3)\n\n   max_val = max(product1, product2, product3, product4)\n\n   ! Convert max_val to string s\n\n   write(s, '(I0)') max_val\n\n   s = adjustl(s)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n   score =0\n\n   do i =1, len_s\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         my_char = 'g'\n\n      else\n\n         my_char = 'p'\n\n      end if\n\n      current_char = s(i:i)\n\n      if (current_char /= my_char) then\n\n         if (my_char == 'g') then\n\n            score = score -1\n\n         else\n\n            score = score +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   print*, score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So I need to declare my_char and current_char as characters.\n\nAdding declarations:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: my_char, current_char\n\nAlso, in the code above, the variables my_char and current_char are used inside the loop. So the code should have those declarations.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer(8) :: a(4), product1, product2, product3, product4, max_val\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   integer :: i, len_s, score\n\n   character(len=1) :: my_char, current_char\n\n   !

Compute the products\n\n   product1 = a(1)*a(3)\n\n   product2 = a(2)*a(4)\n\n   product3 = a(1)*a(4)\n\n   product4 = a(2)*a(3)\n\n   max_val = max(product1, product2, product3, product4)\n\n   ! Convert max_val to string s\n\n   write(s, '(I0)') max_val\n\n   s = adjustl(s)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n   score =0\n\n   do i =1, len_s\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         my_char = 'g'\n\n      else\n\n         my_char = 'p'\n\n      end if\n\n      current_char = s(i:i)\n\n      if (current_char /= my_char) then\n\n         if (my_char == 'g') then\n\n            score = score -1\n\n         else\n\n            score = score +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   print*, score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement for the integer to string may have some issues with leading spaces. The adjustl is important here to move the string to the left, so that leading spaces are removed. The len_trim(s) will give the actual length of the string.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs.\n\nLet me test with an example.\n\nSuppose the first program's input is 1 2 3 4.\n\nThe four numbers are a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3, a(4)=4.\n\nThe products:\n\nproduct1 =1*3=3\n\nproduct2=2*4=8\n\nproduct3=1*4=4\n\nproduct4=2*3=6\n\nThe maximum is 8. So the first program outputs 8. The second program's input is the string \"8\".\n\nProcessing this string:\n\nThe string has length 1. i=1 (odd \u2192 my_char is 'g').\n\ncurrent_char is '8'.\n\nCompare '8' vs 'g' \u2192 they are different.\n\nSince my_char is 'g', the contribution is -1. So the total score is -1.\n\nWait, but according to the code, when my_char is 'g' and the character is different, the score is subtracted by 1. So the result is -1.\n\nBut let's see what the second Java program would do with input \"8\".\n\nThe string S is \"8\".\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 0 (since length is 1):\n\ni=0 (even \u2192 my is 'g'). The character is '8'.\n\nSince '8' is not equal to 'g', so the contribution is my == 'p'? No, my is 'g', so the code adds -1. So the total is -1. So the Fortran code's output is correct here.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the first program's output is \"1234\".\n\nThen the string is \"1234\", length 4.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\ni=1 (odd \u2192 'g') \u2192 char '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1)\n\ni=2 (even \u2192 'p') \u2192 char '2' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0)\n\ni=3 (odd \u2192 'g') \u2192 char '3' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1)\n\ni=4 (even \u2192 'p') \u2192 char '4' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0)\n\nTotal score is 0.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach step:\n\ni=1: my 'g', char '1' \u2192 different \u2192 -1 \u2192 total -1\n\ni=2: my 'p', char '2' \u2192 different \u2192 +1 \u2192 total 0\n\ni=3: my 'g', char '3' \u2192 different \u2192 -1 \u2192 total -1\n\ni=4: my 'p', char '4' \u2192 different \u2192 +1 \u2192 total 0.\n\nYes, so the code would output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input to first program is 3 1 4 1 (so a(1)=3, a(2)=1, a(3)=4, a(4)=1).\n\nProducts:\n\nproduct1 =3*4=12\n\nproduct2=1*1=1\n\nproduct3=3*1=3\n\nproduct4=1*4=4 \u2192 max is 12. So output is 12 \u2192 string \"12\".\n\nProcessing \"12\":\n\ni=1 (odd \u2192 'g') \u2192 char '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 -1.\n\ni=2 (even \u2192 'p') \u2192 char '2' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 +1.\n\nTotal: -1 +1 = 0.\n\nSo the code would output 0.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases: when the max_val is 0, which would be written as \"0\". The string length is 1. So i=1 (odd \u2192 'g'), char '0' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 -1.\n\nAnother case: max_val is negative? Wait, in the first Java program, the input is four longs, but the products could be negative. Wait, but the code takes the maximum of the products. For example, if all products are negative, the maximum would be the least negative. But when converting to a string, the '-' sign would be part of the string. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the first program's input is -1, -2, -3, -4.\n\nThen the products:\n\nproduct1: (-1)*(-3)=3\n\nproduct2: (-2)*(-4)=8 \u2192 max is 8.\n\nSo output is 8 \u2192 same as before.\n\nAnother case where the product is negative: say a(1) = -2, a(2)=3, a(3)=4, a(4)=5.\n\nThen products:\n\nproduct1: (-2)*4 = -8\n\nproduct2: 3*5 =15 \u2192 which is the max.\n\nSo output is 15 \u2192 string \"15\".\n\nProcessing \"15\":\n\ni=1 (odd \u2192 'g') \u2192 '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 -1.\n\ni=2 (even \u2192 'p') \u2192 '5' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 +1.\n\nTotal: 0.\n\nAnother case where the max is negative: suppose all products are negative. Let's say a(1)= -1, a(2)= -3, a(3)= -2, a(4)= -4.\n\nThen products:\n\nproduct1: (-1)*(-2) = 2 \u2192 positive.\n\nWait, so maybe it's hard to get a negative max. Let me think of a case where all products are negative.\n\nSuppose a(1) = -2, a(2) = -3, a(3) = -4, a(4) = -5.\n\nThen:\n\nproduct1: (-2)*(-4) = 8 \u2192 positive.\n\nSo the max is positive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a(1) = -1, a(2) = -2, a(3) = -3, a(4) = -4.\n\nproduct1: (-1)*(-3) = 3\n\nproduct2: (-2)*(-4)=8 \u2192 max is 8.\n\nSo again, positive.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's hard to get a negative max. Let me think of a case where all products are negative.\n\nSuppose a(1) = -1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = -3, a(4) =4.\n\nThen:\n\nproduct1: (-1)*(-3) =3 \u2192 positive.\n\nproduct2: 2*4=8 \u2192 positive.\n\nSo again, positive.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not possible to have all products negative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose a(0) = -1, a(1) = -2, a(2) = 3, a(3) =4 (assuming 0-based in Java, but in Fortran it's 1-based. Let me rephrase in Fortran terms:\n\nSuppose a(1) = -1, a(2) = -2, a(3)=3, a(4)=4.\n\nThen:\n\nproduct1 = a(1)*a(3) \u2192 (-1)*3 = -3\n\nproduct2 = a(2)*a(4) \u2192 (-2)*4 = -8\n\nproduct3 = a(1)*a(4) \u2192 (-1)*4 = -4\n\nproduct4 = a(2)*a(3) \u2192 (-2)*3 = -6\n\nThe maximum of these is -3 (since -3 is larger than -4, -6, -8). So the max_val is -3 \u2192 string \"-3\".\n\nProcessing the string \"-3\".\n\nLength is 2.\n\ni=1: character '-', which is the first character. Since i=1 is odd \u2192 my_char is 'g'.\n\nCompare '-' vs 'g' \u2192 different. Since my_char is 'g', subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\ni=2: character '3', even index (i=2 \u2192 even). my_char is 'p'.\n\nCompare '3' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 0.\n\nSo the final score is 0.\n\nSo the code would output 0 for this case.\n\nAnother test case: max_val is 0 \u2192 string \"0\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (odd \u2192 'g') \u2192 '0' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\nSo the output is -1.\n\nNow, in the code, the variables are declared as integer(8) for the a array. But in Fortran, when multiplying integers, if the product exceeds the capacity, it might overflow. However, the problem's original Java code uses long (64-bit), so using integer(8) in Fortran should be okay, assuming that the compiler uses 8 bytes for integer(8).\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first Java program, the products are computed as long, so in Fortran, using integer(8) is correct.\n\nThe code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran as written should work. Let me check for any possible issues.\n\nWait, in the code, when writing the max_val to the string s, using '(I0)' format. The I0 format writes the integer in decimal without leading spaces, but the write statement may have a fixed length. For example, if the max_val is 123, then writing to a 20-character string with '(I0)' would put '123' starting at the first character, and the rest are spaces. Then adjustl(s) moves the string to the left, so that leading spaces are removed, and the actual content is '123' followed by spaces. The len_trim(s) would correctly give 3, so the loop runs from 1 to 3, and s(1:3) are the characters '1','2','3'.\n\nYes, that should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: the variables product1, etc. are declared as integer(8), so their products are okay.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as written above."
