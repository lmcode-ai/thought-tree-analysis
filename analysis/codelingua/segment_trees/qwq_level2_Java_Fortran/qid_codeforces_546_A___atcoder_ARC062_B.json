    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_546_A) reads three long integers: pandu, vundu, and urdu. Then it calculates a sum c by looping from 1 to urdu, adding i*pandu each time. If c is less than vundu, it outputs 0; else, it outputs c - vundu.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ARC062_B) takes a string S, and for each character, checks if it's equal to 'g' or 'p' depending on the position (even or odd index). Then it calculates a score: if the current character (my) is different from the input character (his), add 1 if my was 'p', subtract 1 if 'g'. Finally, it prints the total score.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's output is the input for the second. But in the original setup, the first program's output is printed, and the second reads that as input. Wait, no, actually, the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, the user says the output of each is input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But in the Java code, the first program's output is a number (either 0 or c - vundu). The second program expects a string S. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a string S. So perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program: it reads three numbers, computes c, then outputs either 0 or c - vundu. The second program reads a string S. So the output of the first program (a number) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. Maybe the first program's output is the input to the second program's input. But the second program's input is a string. So maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then converted into a string for the second program. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's input is a string. So maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then used as the input string for the second program. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read \"5\" as the string S. But in the second Java program, the input is read via the InputReader's next() method, which reads tokens. So the second program would read the first token as the string S. So if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read S as \"5\", and process that string. But the second program's logic is based on the characters in S. So in that case, the second program would process each character of the string \"5\", which is just one character. Hmm, but maybe that's how it's supposed to work. The user's problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next, so the first's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program, which reads it as a string. So the second program's S would be that number as a string. So the Fortran program must first compute the first part's result, then pass that as the input to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first part (the three numbers), compute the first part's result (the output of the first Java program), then use that result as the input to the second part's processing (the string S in the second Java program). The final output is the result of the second part.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read pandu, vundu, urdu from input (first part's input).\n2. Compute c as sum_{i=1 to urdu} i*pandu. Then compute the first output: if c < vundu, then 0 else c - vundu. Let's call this value first_output.\n3. The second part takes first_output as its input S. Wait, but S is a string. So first_output must be converted to a string, and that string is the input S for the second part. So the second part's processing is done on the string representation of first_output.\n4. The second part's processing is to compute the score based on the characters of that string.\n5. The final output is the score from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the three numbers (pandu, vundu, urdu) from input.\n- Compute first_output as per first Java program.\n- Convert first_output to a string S.\n- Process S through the second part's logic (the second Java program's algorithm).\n- Output the resulting score.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nVariables:\n\npandu, vundu, urdu are integers (long in Java, but in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes, so using integer*8 or integer(kind=8) would be appropriate).\n\nCompute c as sum_{i=1 to urdu} i*pandu. The sum is pandu * sum_{i=1 to urdu} i. The sum of 1 to urdu is urdu*(urdu+1)/2. So c = pandu * urdu*(urdu+1)/2. That's a better way to compute it without a loop, which is more efficient. But the original code uses a loop. However, in Fortran, either way is okay. Let's see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nlong c = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= urdu; i++) {\n    c += i * pandu;\n}\n\nSo the sum is pandu multiplied by the sum of 1 to urdu. So the formula is correct. So in Fortran, we can compute it as c = pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2. But since in Fortran, integer division may be an issue. Wait, but in Java, since all variables are long, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, if we use integers, we need to ensure that the division is integer. So perhaps better to compute it as:\n\nc = pandu * (urdu * (urdu + 1) ) / 2\n\nBut in Fortran, the order of operations and integer division must be correct. Alternatively, using a loop is straightforward and avoids any possible division issues. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ninteger :: i, urdu_val\nc = 0\ndo i = 1, urdu\n    c = c + i * pandu\nend do\n\nBut since urdu can be up to 1e9 (since it's a long in Java), but in practice, the loop would take too long for large urdu. Wait, but in the original code, the loop is over i from 1 to urdu. If urdu is very large (like 1e18), then the loop would not be feasible. However, the formula approach is better here. So better to use the formula.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the variables are long, so urdu can be up to 2^63-1. But in Fortran, using integers of kind 8 (64-bit) would handle that. So using the formula is better for performance.\n\nSo compute c as pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2. But need to ensure that the multiplication doesn't overflow. However, in Fortran, with 64-bit integers, the product could be up to (1e18)^2, which is 1e36, which is way beyond 64-bit (max 9e18). So perhaps the formula approach may not be feasible for very large urdu. Hmm, but in the original code, the loop would also have the same problem. So perhaps the formula is better, but in Fortran, using 64-bit integers, the product may overflow. Wait, but in the problem's context, maybe the input constraints are such that the values are manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first part can be computed with the formula, and proceed.\n\nSo first part:\n\nRead pandu, vundu, urdu (all as 64-bit integers).\n\nCompute c = pandu * urdu * (urdu + 1) / 2\n\nThen, if c < vundu, first_output is 0 else c - vundu.\n\nThen, the second part takes the first_output as a string S. So we need to convert first_output to a string. In Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write with an internal file or a character variable.\n\nOnce we have the string S, process each character as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second part's algorithm:\n\nInitialize score to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in S (from index 1 to len(S)):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if the position (starting at 0?) is even, else 'p'. Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to S.length()-1. So the first character is index 0 (even), so my is 'g'; next index 1 (odd) is 'p', etc.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {\n    char my = i % 2 == 0 ? 'g' : 'p';\n    char his = S.charAt(i);\n    if (my != his) {\n        score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n    }\n}\n\nSo for each position i (starting at 0), if even (i mod 2 is 0), my is 'g'; else 'p'.\n\nThen, if my != his (the character in S at position i), then:\n\nif my was 'p', add 1 to score.\n\nif my was 'g', subtract 1.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (my != his) {\n\n    score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1;\n\n}\n\nSo when my is 'g' and his is different, then my is 'g', so the term is -1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf my is 'g' (i even), and his is different, then add -1 (because my is 'g', so my == 'p' is false, so the ternary gives -1).\n\nIf my is 'p' (i odd), and his is different, add 1.\n\nSo the score is incremented by 1 when my is 'p' and they differ, or -1 when my is 'g' and they differ.\n\nSo the Fortran code for the second part would be:\n\nInitialize score = 0\n\nLoop over each character in the string S (from 1 to len(S) in Fortran, since Fortran is 1-based):\n\ni starts at 1 (but in the Java code, the index starts at 0). Wait, in Fortran, the first character is index 1. So for the first character (i=1 in Fortran), the original Java's i is 0. So in Fortran, the loop variable j from 1 to len(S):\n\noriginal_i = j-1 (since Fortran's 1 corresponds to Java's 0).\n\nSo for each j in 1 to len(S):\n\noriginal_i = j-1\n\nmy_char = 'g' if (original_i) mod 2 ==0 else 'p'\n\nhis_char = S(j:j)\n\nif my_char /= his_char then:\n\n   if my_char == 'p' then score = score +1\n\n   else score = score -1\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read the three numbers.\n\nThen compute first_output.\n\nConvert first_output to a string S.\n\nProcess S as per the second part's logic.\n\nFinally, print the score.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nWe need to read pandu, vundu, urdu as integers (kind=8).\n\nCompute c = pandu * urdu * (urdu +1) / 2\n\nThen first_output = 0 if c < vundu else c - vundu.\n\nThen, convert first_output to a string. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use an internal write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: first_output\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') first_output\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is properly trimmed. Alternatively, use a character variable of sufficient length.\n\nThen, process each character in s.\n\nBut note that leading zeros may be an issue? Well, the original Java code would read the first token as the string S. So if the first_output is, say, 5, then the string is \"5\", so the second program's S is \"5\".\n\nIn Fortran, when writing with '(I0)', it will write the number without leading zeros, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: pandu, vundu, urdu, c, first_output, score\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\n! Read input\nread*, pandu, vundu, urdu\n\n! Compute first part\nc = pandu * urdu * (urdu +1) / 2\nif (c < vundu) then\n    first_output = 0\nelse\n    first_output = c - vundu\nend if\n\n! Convert first_output to string s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') first_output\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nscore = 0\n\n! Process each character in s\ndo i = 1, len_s\n    integer :: original_i = i -1\n    character :: my_char\n    if (mod(original_i, 2) == 0) then\n        my_char = 'g'\n    else\n        my_char = 'p'\n    end if\n    character :: his_char = s(i:i)\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n            score = score +1\n        else\n            score = score -1\n        end if\n    end if\nend do\n\n! Output the score\nprint*, score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string s is of length 20, but the actual length is len_trim(s). So the loop should go from 1 to len_trim(s). So in the code above, len_s is set to len_trim(s), and the loop is over i=1 to len_s.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The division in the first part: since c is computed as (pandu * urdu * (urdu +1)) / 2. Since all variables are integers, this must be integer division. In Fortran, when using integers, the division is integer division. So the formula is correct as long as the multiplication doesn't overflow. But in Java, the same formula would be used (since the loop is equivalent to the formula). So as long as the variables are 64-bit integers, this should be okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations matters. Let me see:\n\nc = pandu * urdu * (urdu +1) / 2\n\nBut in Fortran, the multiplication is left to right. So first pandu * urdu, then multiply by (urdu+1), then divide by 2. But this could be problematic for very large numbers. For example, if urdu is 1e18, then urdu*(urdu+1) is ~1e36, which is way beyond 64-bit (max 9e18). So this would cause overflow. However, in the original Java code, the loop would also have the same problem. Because the loop would compute i*pandu for i up to urdu, which for urdu=1e18 would be impossible. So perhaps the problem expects that the formula is used, but in reality, the input constraints must be such that the numbers are manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's first part can be handled with the formula, but in Fortran, using 64-bit integers may not be sufficient for very large urdu. However, given that the problem is presented as a code translation, perhaps the formula is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop is better to avoid overflow. Let's see:\n\nIn the original code, the loop is:\n\nc starts at 0.\n\nfor i from 1 to urdu:\n\nc += i*pandu\n\nSo the total is pandu * sum_{i=1 to urdu} i = pandu * (urdu*(urdu+1)/2). So the formula is correct. But in code, the loop may accumulate the sum step by step, which could be better for very large numbers? Wait, no, because even if urdu is 1e18, the sum would be 1e36, which is way beyond 64-bit. So the loop would also overflow. So the problem must have constraints where urdu is small enough. So perhaps the formula is okay.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, using 64-bit integers, the maximum value is 2^63-1 (~9e18). So if urdu is up to 4e9, then urdu*(urdu+1)/2 is about 8e18, which is within 64-bit. So if the problem's constraints are within that, then it's okay. Since the problem is from codeforces and atcoder, perhaps the constraints are manageable.\n\nTherefore, proceed with the formula.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when computing c, if the multiplication overflows, but in Java, the same would happen. So the code is correct as per the problem's original logic.\n\nNow, the string conversion: when writing first_output to s, using '(I0)' will write the number as a string without leading zeros. So for example, if first_output is 5, s is \"5\", length 1. If it's 0, then \"0\".\n\nThen, processing each character in the string.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose first_output is 5. The string is \"5\".\n\nProcessing each character (only one):\n\ni=1 (original_i=0, even). my_char is 'g'.\n\nhis_char is '5'.\n\nCompare 'g' vs '5' (ASCII values: 'g' is 103, '5' is 53). They are different.\n\nSince my_char is 'g', so add -1 to score. So score becomes -1.\n\nWait, but according to the code:\n\nif (my_char /= his_char) then:\n\n   if my_char is 'p', add 1, else subtract 1.\n\nIn this case, my_char is 'g', so subtract 1. So the total score is -1.\n\nWait, but according to the second Java program's logic, when the first character (position 0 in Java) is '5', which is not equal to 'g', so the score is adjusted by -1 (since my was 'g'). So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: first_output is 0. The string is \"0\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (original_i=0). my is 'g', his is '0'.\n\nDifferent, so subtract 1. So score is -1.\n\nWait, but the second Java program would process the string \"0\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the second Java program, for S = \"0\":\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 0 (since length is 1).\n\ni=0: my is 'g', his is '0'.\n\nThey are different. So add my == 'p'? No, so add -1. So total score is -1. Which matches the Fortran code.\n\nAnother test case: first_output is 123. The string is \"123\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\ni=1 (original_i=0): my 'g', his '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\ni=2 (original_i=1): my 'p', his '2' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0).\n\ni=3 (original_i=2): my 'g', his '3' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\nTotal score: -1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava code for S = \"123\":\n\npositions 0,1,2.\n\ni=0: my 'g', his '1' \u2192 different \u2192 add -1 (score -1).\n\ni=1: my 'p', his '2' \u2192 different \u2192 add +1 (score 0).\n\ni=2: my 'g', his '3' \u2192 different \u2192 add -1 (score -1).\n\nYes, same as Fortran.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the variables:\n\n- The first_output is an 8-byte integer.\n\n- The string s is of length 20, which should be sufficient for numbers up to 1e18 (which is 19 digits). So 20 is okay.\n\nThe loop over the characters is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code above, the line:\n\ncharacter :: his_char = s(i:i)\n\nBut in Fortran, character variables can be assigned like that. However, in some compilers, maybe need to use a temporary variable. Alternatively, use s(i:i) directly in the comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to write:\n\nhis_char = s(i:i)\n\nBut in Fortran, when assigning a substring to a character variable of length 1, it's okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variable his_char must be declared as a character of length 1. So in the code above, the declaration is:\n\ncharacter :: his_char = s(i:i)\n\nBut in Fortran, the left-hand side must have a declared length. So perhaps the code should have:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: his_char\n\nSimilarly for my_char.\n\nSo correcting that:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: my_char, his_char\n\nWait, but in the code above, the variables my_char and his_char are declared inside the loop? Or outside?\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, inside the do loop:\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n    integer :: original_i = i -1\n\n    character :: my_char\n\n    if (mod(original_i, 2) == 0) then\n\n        my_char = 'g'\n\n    else\n\n        my_char = 'p'\n\n    end if\n\n    character :: his_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n\n        ...\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So the declarations of my_char and his_char must be outside the loop, or inside with a declaration.\n\nAlternatively, better to declare them before the loop.\n\nLet me restructure that part:\n\nInside the program:\n\n...\n\nscore = 0\n\n! Process each character in s\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n    integer :: original_i = i -1\n\n    character(len=1) :: my_char, his_char\n\n    if (mod(original_i, 2) == 0) then\n\n        my_char = 'g'\n\n    else\n\n        my_char = 'p'\n\n    end if\n\n    his_char = s(i:i)\n\n    if (my_char /= his_char) then\n\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n            score = score +1\n\n        else\n\n            score = score -1\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThis should work.\n\nAlternatively, since my_char can be determined without a variable:\n\nBut better to use variables for clarity.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, the modulo function for negative numbers? But original_i is i-1, and i starts at 1, so original_i is 0,1,2,... which are non-negative. So mod(original_i,2) is okay.\n\nAnother point: the string s may have leading spaces if the write statement pads it, but using '(I0)' should avoid that. The len_trim(s) will get the correct length.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1 for first program:\n\nSuppose pandu=1, vundu=3, urdu=2.\n\nThen c = 1*(2*3)/2 = 3. Since c (3) is equal to vundu (3), so first_output is 0.\n\nThen the second part processes \"0\".\n\nThe string is \"0\", length 1.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (original_i=0 \u2192 'g').\n\nCompare 'g' vs '0' \u2192 different. Since my is 'g', subtract 1 \u2192 score = -1.\n\nSo the final output is -1.\n\nWait, but according to the second Java program's code, when S is \"0\", the score is -1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nFirst program input: pandu=2, vundu=5, urdu=3.\n\nc = 2*(3*4)/2 = 12. vundu is 5. So first_output is 12-5=7.\n\nThe string is \"7\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (original_i=0 \u2192 'g'). his is '7' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\nSo output is -1.\n\nAnother example where first_output is 123 (as before), the output is -1.\n\nAnother test case where first_output is 0:\n\nThen the string is \"0\", leading to score -1.\n\nWait, but what if first_output is 0, but the second program's processing gives a different result?\n\nWait, let me think of another example where the first_output is 10.\n\nThen the string is \"10\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (original_i=0 \u2192 'g') vs '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\ni=2 (original_i=1 \u2192 'p') vs '0' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 (score 0).\n\nTotal score 0-1+1=0?\n\nWait:\n\nFirst character '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 (score -1).\n\nSecond character '0' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 0.\n\nSo the final score is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final Fortran code should be as follows."
