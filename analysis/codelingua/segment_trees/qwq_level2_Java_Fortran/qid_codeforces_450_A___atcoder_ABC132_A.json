So the size1 and size2 are not changed. So in the code above, after dequeuing (front1 and front2 are incremented), the size remains the same. So the calculation for pos1 is mod(front1 -1 + size1, n). Let me see:\n\nSuppose front1 was 1, size1 is 5, n is 10.\n\nfront1 -1 + size1 = 1-1 +5 =5 \u2192 mod 10 \u21925 \u2192 pos1=5. Which is correct, since the current elements are from 1 to 5 (front1=1, size1=5). The next position to enqueue is 5+1=6? Wait, no.",

Thus, the correct formula for pos1 is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1 But in Fortran, the mod function returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So mod(a,b) is a - b*floor(a/b). So for positive numbers, it's okay. Wait, in Fortran, mod(10,10) is 0, mod(11,10)=1, etc. Thus, the code for pos1 should be:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nelse\n\n    pos1 = pos1\n\nend if\n\npos1 = pos1 +1 ?

The process is: while the first queue isn't empty, if the front element is <= m, it removes both queues' front elements. Otherwise, it subtracts m from the front of q1 and moves it to the end, and moves the q2's front to the end. The answer is the last ans value (which is the q2 element when the condition is met). The output is the ans.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC132_A) reads a string, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. Outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, the first part must process the input, compute the answer (the 'ans' from the first Java program), then pass that as the input to the second part, which processes it as the string and outputs the result.\n\nWait, but how does the first Java program's output become the input to the second? The first program's output is the 'ans' (an integer), which is then used as the input for the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code: it reads a string s via in.next(). So the first program's output (the integer ans) must be converted into a string, which is then the input for the second program.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is an integer, but the second expects a string. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program outputs an integer (ans), but the second program expects a string (the input is a string). That would mean that the first program's output must be a string, but in the first Java code, it's printing an integer. So perhaps the first program's output is the integer, which is then passed as the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program's input is that integer's string representation?\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string s. So the first program's output must be a string that the second can process. Wait, but the first program's output is an integer. So maybe the first program's output is written as a string (like \"5\" for example), and that is the input to the second program. So the second program would read that as the string, and check if it has two characters each appearing twice. For example, if the first program outputs 12, then the second program would get \"12\" as input, which has two characters, each appearing once, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program requires exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. So the input string must be four characters long with two pairs. For example, \"aabb\" would be yes, but \"12\" would be no.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first compute the first part's answer (the integer ans), then pass that as a string to the second part's processing. The second part then checks if that string meets the criteria.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first part will compute the ans (integer), then convert it to a string, and then process that string through the second part's logic, outputting the final result.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (codeforces_450_A):\n\nThe first program reads n and m, then n integers. The queues are being used to track the elements and their original indices. The process is similar to a simulation where each element is reduced by m each time until it's <= m, then that element is removed along with its index. The ans is the last index removed.\n\nIn Fortran, queues can be implemented with arrays and pointers. Since the queues can be of size up to n, which is not specified, but in the problem, n is given as input. So perhaps we can read all the elements first into arrays, then process them in a loop.\n\nWait, but in Java, the queues are processed in a loop where elements are dequeued and possibly enqueued again. So for the first part, the steps are:\n\nInitialize two queues (q1 and q2). The first queue holds the values, the second the indices (1 to n). Then, while q1 is not empty, check the front element. If <= m, remove both queues' front elements, and set ans to the q2's element. Else, subtract m from the front of q1, add it back to the end of q1, and move the q2's front to the end.\n\nThe ans is the last element popped from q2 when the condition is met.\n\nHmm. To model this in Fortran, perhaps using arrays and indices to track the front and rear of the queues. Since Fortran arrays are static, but the problem's n is variable, we can read n first, then allocate arrays of size n.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues can be processed in a loop, perhaps using a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are moved to the end, perhaps we can model the queues as arrays with pointers for front and rear. Let me think.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n and m, then read n integers into an array (values). The indices are 1 to n, so another array (indices) can be 1,2,...n.\n\nThen, we need to simulate the queues. Let's use two arrays for the queues, each of size n. The queues start with all elements. The front and rear pointers can track the current positions.\n\nWait, but in Java, the queues are linked lists, so they can grow and shrink. But in Fortran, perhaps using arrays with front and rear indices.\n\nAlternatively, since the elements are processed in a loop, perhaps we can use a circular buffer approach. Let me think of the queues as arrays with front and rear pointers.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a way that elements are moved to the end, perhaps we can model the queues as arrays with a current position. Let me think of the queues as arrays, and track the current front and the size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current index. Let me think of the first queue (q1) as an array of size n, and similarly for q2. The queues start with all elements. The process is:\n\nInitialize front and rear pointers for each queue. Initially, front = 1, rear = n for each queue. But perhaps it's easier to use a list and track the current position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current index, and when elements are dequeued, they are moved to the end if needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be implemented as arrays with a current position, and when elements are dequeued, they are either removed (if condition met) or added back to the end.\n\nHmm, this might get a bit complex. Let me think of the first queue as an array, and track the current elements in a circular manner. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues are processed in a loop, perhaps the elements can be stored in arrays, and we can track the current elements in a way similar to a queue.\n\nWait, here's an idea: since the queues are processed in a loop, perhaps the elements can be stored in arrays, and we can track the current elements using indices. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current front and rear. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nInitialize two arrays, q1 and q2, each of size n. The first array holds the values, the second the indices. The initial elements are filled as per the input. Then, we can track the front and rear indices for each queue. The queues are processed as follows:\n\nWhile the first queue is not empty (front <= rear):\n\nCheck the front element of q1. If it's <= m, then we dequeue both queues (i.e., move front forward by 1), and set ans to the dequeued element of q2. However, since the ans is the last such element, we need to keep track of the last time this happens.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the ans is set each time the condition is met, so the final ans is the last one that was dequeued when the condition was met. So whenever the first element is <= m, we remove it and set ans to the q2's element. The loop continues until the queue is empty, so the last such ans is the one printed.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the ans is updated every time the first element is <= m. So the final ans is the last time that happened. So in the loop, whenever the first element is <= m, we remove it and set ans to the q2's element. The loop continues until the queue is empty, so the last such ans is the one printed.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, we need to track the ans variable, updating it each time the condition is met.\n\nHmm. To model the queues in Fortran, perhaps using arrays and pointers for front and rear. Let me try to structure this.\n\nFirst, read n and m, then read the n integers into an array. The indices are 1 to n.\n\nInitialize two arrays for the queues. Let's say q1_values and q2_indices, each of size n. The initial elements are the input values and their indices.\n\nThen, we can track the front and rear indices for each queue. Initially, front1 = 1, rear1 = n, front2 = 1, rear2 = n.\n\nWait, but the queues are processed in a way that elements are dequeued from the front and possibly enqueued to the end. So perhaps the queues are implemented as arrays with a current front and rear, and when elements are dequeued, they are either removed (if condition met) or added back to the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and a pointer to the front. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current size and a front index. For example, for q1:\n\nInitialize q1 as the array of input values. The size is n. The front is 1. When we dequeue, we take the front element, then increment the front. If we need to enqueue, we can append to the end, but this requires dynamic arrays, which Fortran doesn't support easily. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues can be processed in a circular manner, perhaps using a fixed-size array and a pointer that wraps around. Let me think of the queues as arrays of size n, and track the current front and the current size. For example, for q1:\n\nInitialize the array with the input values. The front starts at 1, and the size is n. When we dequeue, we take the element at front, then increment front modulo n. But when enqueuing, we need to add to the end. Wait, but the size can change. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements. Since in Fortran, arrays are static, but we can pre-allocate arrays of size n, and track the current elements using indices.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Since the queues are processed in a loop where elements are either removed or cycled back, perhaps the total number of operations is limited. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current position. Let me try to model the queues as arrays with a current front and rear, and track the elements in a circular way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements. Let me think of the queues as arrays of size n, and track the current elements using a pointer. Let me try to outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n and m, then read the n values into an array called values. The indices are 1 to n.\n\nInitialize two arrays, q1 and q2, each of size n. The initial elements are values(1:n) and 1:n respectively. The current size of each queue is n. The front index starts at 1 for both queues.\n\nThen, in a loop while the size of q1 is greater than 0:\n\nCheck the front element of q1 (q1(front1)). If it's <= m:\n\n- Dequeue both queues: remove the front elements. So, for q1, the new front is front1 + 1, and the size decreases by 1. Similarly for q2. The ans is set to the dequeued element of q2 (which is q2(front2)).\n\nWait, but how to track the elements? Maybe the queues are stored as arrays, and the front and size are tracked. The elements are stored in the arrays, but the front and size determine which elements are active.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements. Let me think of the queues as arrays with a current list, and when elements are dequeued, they are removed from the front, and when enqueued, added to the end.\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are static, perhaps we can use a circular buffer approach. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me think of the queues as arrays of size n. The front and rear pointers track the current elements. For example, for q1:\n\nfront1 = 1, rear1 = n. The elements are stored in q1(1:n). When we dequeue, we take q1(front1), then increment front1. If we need to enqueue, we set rear1 = rear1 + 1 mod n, but that might not work. Alternatively, perhaps the queues are implemented as arrays with a current size and front index. Let me try:\n\nInitialize q1 as the array of values. The size is n. The front is 1.\n\nSimilarly for q2, which is the array of indices 1 to n, size n, front 1.\n\nThen, in each iteration:\n\nCheck the current front element of q1 (q1(front1)). If it's <= m:\n\n- Dequeue both queues: the element from q1 is discarded, and the element from q2 is the ans. The ans is updated to q2(front2).\n\n- Then, increment front1 and front2 by 1, decreasing the size by 1 for each queue.\n\nElse:\n\n- Take the element from q1(front1), subtract m, and enqueue it back to the end of q1. Similarly, take the element from q2(front2), and enqueue it back to the end of q2.\n\nWait, but how to enqueue back? Since the queues are arrays, perhaps we can track the current size and append to the end. But since the arrays are fixed size, we can't grow them. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the queues can cycle elements, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and front index. The elements are stored in the array, and when dequeued, the front moves forward. When enqueued, the element is placed at the end (rear = front + size -1 mod n?), but this requires a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements, and when elements are enqueued, they are added to the end, but since the array is fixed size, we can overwrite the next position. Wait, but the size can exceed n? No, because each time an element is enqueued, it's part of the original n elements, but modified. Wait, the problem's first Java code's queues start with n elements, and each time an element is dequeued and not removed (i.e., when it's > m), it's enqueued back. So the total number of elements in the queues can stay the same, but the elements are modified.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, when the element is > m, it's subtracted by m and added back to the end. So the size of the queues remains the same. Because each time you dequeue one element and enqueue one (the modified one). So the queues' size remains n. Wait, no: initially, the queues have n elements. Each iteration, you dequeue one element from each queue. If the condition is met (<=m), then the queues' size decreases by 1. If not, you enqueue the modified element back, so the size remains the same. So the queues' size can decrease over time until they are empty.\n\nWait, let me think again. The first queue starts with n elements. Each iteration:\n\nIf the first element is <= m:\n\n- Dequeue both queues (so each queue's size decreases by 1).\n\nElse:\n\n- Dequeue the first element of q1, subtract m, and enqueue it back. Similarly, dequeue the first element of q2 and enqueue it back. So the size remains the same.\n\nThus, the queues' size decreases only when the condition is met. So the queues can have varying sizes, but the maximum size is n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays of size n, and track the current size and front index. The elements are stored in the array, and when dequeued, the front moves forward. When enqueued, the element is placed at the end (front + size -1 mod n?), but since the size can decrease, perhaps the rear is not needed, and the elements are stored in a circular manner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and front index. The elements are stored in the array from front to front + size -1 (mod n if necessary). But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements, and when elements are enqueued, they are added to the end of the array. But since the array is fixed size, perhaps we can use a pointer to track the current position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and front index. Let me try to outline this approach.\n\nInitialize q1 as an array of size n, with elements values(1:n). The size of q1 is n, front1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, q2 is an array of size n with elements 1 to n, size2 = n, front2 = 1.\n\nThen, in each iteration:\n\nIf the size of q1 is 0, break.\n\nCheck q1(front1). If <= m:\n\n- The ans is set to q2(front2).\n\n- Decrement the size of q1 and q2 by 1.\n\n- Increment front1 and front2 by 1.\n\nElse:\n\n- Take the value from q1(front1), subtract m, store it in temp_val.\n\n- Take the index from q2(front2), store in temp_idx.\n\n- Enqueue these back to the end of the queues.\n\nWait, but how to enqueue? Since the queues are arrays, perhaps we can shift the elements. But that's inefficient. Alternatively, since the queues are processed in a circular way, perhaps the front can be incremented modulo the size?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current size and front index. The elements are stored in the array, and when you enqueue, you place the new element at the end (front + size -1 mod n?), but this requires a circular buffer approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the queues can be represented as arrays with a current list of elements, and when elements are enqueued, they are added to the end of the array. But since the array is fixed size, perhaps we can use a pointer to track the current position.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the queues as arrays and track the current elements using front and size variables.\n\nLet me try to code this step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the n integers into an array called values.\n\nInitialize q1 as an array of size n, with values(1:n).\n\nInitialize q2 as an array of size n, with 1,2,...,n.\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nfront2 = 1\n\nsize1 = n\n\nsize2 = n\n\nans = 0\n\nThen, loop while size1 > 0:\n\n    current_val = q1(front1)\n\n    if current_val <= m:\n\n        ans = q2(front2)\n\n        ! Dequeue both queues: increment front and decrease size by 1.\n\n        front1 = front1 + 1\n\n        front2 = front2 + 1\n\n        size1 = size1 - 1\n\n        size2 = size2 - 1\n\n    else:\n\n        ! Dequeue the elements, subtract m, and enqueue back.\n\n        temp_val = current_val - m\n\n        temp_idx = q2(front2)\n\n        ! Dequeue front elements:\n\n        front1 = front1 + 1\n\n        front2 = front2 + 1\n\n        ! Now, need to enqueue temp_val and temp_idx to the end of the queues.\n\n        ! To enqueue, we can place them at the end of the current queue.\n\n        ! The end is front1 + size1 -1 (since front1 is the next position after the current front)\n\n        ! Wait, but the queues are circular. Hmm.\n\n        ! Alternatively, since the queues are of size n, and when we enqueue, the size remains the same.\n\n        ! Wait, in the else case, the size doesn't change. Because we took one element out and put it back.\n\n        ! So size1 and size2 remain the same.\n\n        ! So after dequeuing, front1 and front2 are incremented, but then we need to add the elements to the end.\n\n        ! The end of the queue is (front + size -1) mod n ?\n\n        ! Let me think of the queues as circular arrays. The current elements are from front to front + size -1 (mod n).\n\n        !

This might work.\n\n        ! So in the else case:\n\n        temp_val = q1(front1) - m\n\n        temp_idx = q2(front2)\n\n        ! Dequeue by moving front:\n\n        front1 = front1 +1\n\n        front2 = front2 +1\n\n        ! Now, enqueue the temp_val and temp_idx to the end of the queues.\n\n        ! Compute the position to place them.\n\n        pos1 = (front1 -1 + size1) mod n\n\n        if pos1 ==0 then pos1 =n\n\n        q1(pos1) = temp_val\n\n        pos2 = (front2 -1 + size2) mod n\n\n        if pos2 ==0 then pos2 =n\n\n        q2(pos2) = temp_idx\n\n        ! Since the size remains the same, the size variables are not changed.\n\n    end if\n\nend loop\n\nOnce the loop ends, the ans is the last value set.\n\nOkay, that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem is to take the ans (integer) and convert it to a string, then check if the string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. For example:\n\ninteger :: num = ans\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') num\n\nThen, process the string s.\n\nThe second part's logic is:\n\nCheck if the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Convert the integer ans to a string s.\n\n2. Count the frequency of each character in s.\n\n3. Check if there are exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2.\n\nIn Fortran, to count the frequency, we can use an array for counts. Since characters are ASCII, we can use a 256-element array (for all possible ASCII characters), but since the string is digits, maybe 10 elements (for '0'-'9') would suffice, but to be safe, let's use 256.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a number converted to a string, the characters are digits (assuming the ans is non-negative, which it is in the first program).\n\nWait, the first program's ans is the last element popped from q2, which is an index (1-based). So the ans is between 1 and n. So the string will be digits only.\n\nThus, the characters are '0'-'9', so we can use an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) or 256.\n\nLet me proceed with a 256-element array.\n\nInitialize an array count(0:255) = 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the string s:\n\n   c = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n   count(c) = count(c) +1\n\nThen, check:\n\nnumber_of_distinct = 0\n\nvalid = .true.\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (count(i) >0) then\n\n      number_of_distinct = number_of_distinct +1\n\n      if (count(i) /=2) then\n\n          valid = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (number_of_distinct ==2 .and. valid) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is exactly four characters long? Wait no, the condition is that the string has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So the total length must be 4, but the code above would check that.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"12\", then the counts are 1 and 1, so each count is 1, so valid is false. The number_of_distinct is 2, but counts are not 2. So the code would output 'No'.\n\nAnother example: \"1122\" \u2192 counts for '1' and '2' are 2 each \u2192 valid.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program must read the input for the first part, compute the ans, then process the ans as a string through the second part's logic, and output the result.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read n and m, then the n integers.\n\nThen, process the queues as per the first part's logic.\n\nThen, convert ans to a string.\n\nThen, process the string as per the second part's logic.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, ans\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: values, q1, q2\n\ninteger :: front1, front2, size1, size2\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\ninteger :: count(0:255)\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to allocate the arrays based on n.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nAllocate arrays of size n.\n\nRead the n values into values array.\n\nInitialize q1 and q2 arrays.\n\nfront1 = 1\n\nfront2 = 1\n\nsize1 = n\n\nsize2 = n\n\nans =0\n\nThen loop while size1 >0:\n\nInside the loop, as per earlier logic.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So the code can be written as:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, ans\n\ninteger, allocatable :: values(:), q1(:), q2(:)\n\ninteger :: front1, front2, size1, size2\n\ninteger :: i, pos1, pos2, temp_val, temp_idx\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\ninteger :: count(0:255)\n\n! Read input for first part\n\nread*, n, m\n\nallocate(values(n))\n\nread*, values(1:n)\n\nallocate(q1(n), q2(n))\n\nq1 = values\n\nq2 = [(i, i=1,n)]\n\nfront1 =1\n\nfront2 =1\n\nsize1 =n\n\nsize2 =n\n\nans =0\n\ndo while (size1 >0)\n\n    if (q1(front1) <= m) then\n\n        ans = q2(front2)\n\n        front1 = front1 +1\n\n        front2 = front2 +1\n\n        size1 = size1 -1\n\n        size2 = size2 -1\n\n    else\n\n        temp_val = q1(front1) - m\n\n        temp_idx = q2(front2)\n\n        front1 = front1 +1\n\n        front2 = front2 +1\n\n        ! Enqueue temp_val and temp_idx to the end of the queues.\n\n        !

Now, convert ans to string s.\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\n! Process the string s.\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n    integer :: c = ichar(s(i:i))\n\n    count(c) = count(c) +1\n\nend do\n\ninteger :: num_distinct =0\n\nlogical :: valid = .true.\n\ndo i=0,255\n\n    if (count(i) >0) then\n\n        num_distinct = num_distinct +1\n\n        if (count(i) /=2) then\n\n            valid = .false.\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_distinct ==2 .and. valid) then\n\n    print*, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n    print*, 'No'\n\nend if\n\ndeallocate(values, q1, q2)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the else case, when enqueuing, the size remains the same. So the size1 and size2 are not changed. So in the code above, after dequeuing (front1 and front2 are incremented), the size remains the same. So the calculation for pos1 is mod(front1 -1 + size1, n). Let me see:\n\nSuppose front1 was 1, size1 is 5, n is 10.\n\nfront1 -1 + size1 = 1-1 +5 =5 \u2192 mod 10 \u21925 \u2192 pos1=5.\n\nWhich is correct, since the current elements are from 1 to 5 (front1=1, size1=5). The next position to enqueue is 5+1=6? Wait, no. Wait, the current elements are from front1 to front1 + size1 -1. So front1=1, size1=5 \u2192 elements 1-5. The next position to enqueue would be 6 mod 10 (if n=10). But the calculation is mod(front1-1 + size1, n). So (1-1 +5)=5 mod10 \u21925. Hmm, that would place it at position5, which is already part of the current elements. That's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, the current elements are from front to front + size -1 (mod n). The next position to enqueue is (front + size) mod n.\n\nWait, let me think of the current elements as a block starting at front, of length size. The next position after the block is front + size mod n.\n\nSo the position to enqueue is (front + size -1 +1) mod n \u2192 (front + size) mod n.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\npos = mod(front1 -1 + size1, n) +1\n\nWait, let me think with an example:\n\nfront1 =1, size1=5, n=10.\n\nfront1-1 + size1 = 1-1 +5 =5 \u2192 mod10 \u21925 \u2192 +1 \u21926 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nWait, but mod(5,10) is 5, so adding 1 gives 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-calculate.\n\nThe current elements are from front1 to front1 + size1 -1 (mod n).\n\nThe next position to enqueue is (front1 + size1) mod n.\n\nWait, let me think of front1 as the starting index, and the elements are front1, front1+1, ..., front1 + size1 -1 (mod n).\n\nThe next position after the last element is (front1 + size1) mod n.\n\nSo the position to place the new element is (front1 + size1) mod n.\n\nBut since the array is 1-based, mod(n) could give 0, which should be n.\n\nSo:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1 +1, n)\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1 ?\n\nWait, let me try with front1=1, size1=5, n=10:\n\nfront1 + size1 -1 =1+5-1=5 \u2192 mod10 \u21925 \u2192 +1 \u21926 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: front1=5, size1=3, n=10:\n\nfront1 + size1 -1 =5+3-1=7 \u2192 mod10 \u21927 \u2192 +1 \u21928? Wait, but the current elements are 5,6,7. The next position is 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example where it wraps around:\n\nfront1=9, size1=3, n=10:\n\nfront1 + size1 -1 =9+3-1=11 \u2192 mod10 \u21921 \u2192 +1 \u21922?\n\nWait, the current elements are 9,10,1 (since size is 3). The next position is 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1\n\nWait, but mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) gives the last element's position mod n. Adding 1 gives the next position. But if mod gives 0, then adding 1 would be 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf front1 + size1 -1 =10 \u2192 mod10 \u21920 \u2192 adding 1 gives 1.\n\nWhich is correct, since the next position after 10 (assuming n=10) is 1.\n\nWait, but in the case where front1 + size1 -1 is exactly n, mod(n) is 0, so adding 1 gives 1, which is correct.\n\nThus, the correct formula for pos1 is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1\n\nBut in Fortran, the mod function returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So mod(a,b) is a - b*floor(a/b). So for positive numbers, it's okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, mod(10,10) is 0, mod(11,10)=1, etc.\n\nThus, the code for pos1 should be:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nelse\n\n    pos1 = pos1\n\nend if\n\npos1 = pos1 +1 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) \u2192 gives the last element's position.\n\nThe next position is (last +1) mod n.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nelse\n\n    pos1 = pos1\n\nend if\n\nBecause front1 + size1 is the next position after the last element.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nelse\n\n    pos1 = pos1\n\nend if\n\nSimilarly for pos2.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nend if\n\nq1(pos1) = temp_val\n\nSame for pos2.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nIn the else block:\n\ntemp_val = q1(front1) - m\n\ntemp_idx = q2(front2)\n\nfront1 = front1 +1\n\nfront2 = front2 +1\n\n! Compute positions to enqueue.\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1 -1, n) +1 \u2192 no, better:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nend if\n\nq1(pos1) = temp_val\n\nSimilarly for pos2.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate with the example:\n\nfront1 was 1, size1=5, n=10.\n\nAfter dequeuing, front1 becomes 2.\n\nsize1 remains 5.\n\nSo front1 + size1 =2+5=7 \u2192 mod10 \u21927 \u2192 pos1=7.\n\nWhich is correct, since the new element is placed at position7, which is after the current elements (2 to 6).\n\nWait, the current elements after dequeuing are from front1=2 to 2+5-1=6. The next position is 7.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother example where it wraps around:\n\nfront1=9, size1=3, n=10.\n\nAfter dequeuing, front1 becomes 10.\n\nfront1 + size1 =10 +3 =13 \u2192 mod10 \u21923 \u2192 pos1=3.\n\nThe current elements are from 10,1,2 (since size is 3). The next position is 3.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother example where front1 + size1 exceeds n:\n\nfront1=8, size1=4, n=10.\n\nfront1 + size1 =12 \u2192 mod10 \u21922 \u2192 pos1=2.\n\nThe current elements are 8,9,10,1. The next position is 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThus, the correct formula is pos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n), and if zero, set to n.\n\nSo in code:\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nend if\n\nSimilarly for pos2.\n\nThus, the code in the else block should be:\n\ntemp_val = q1(front1) - m\n\ntemp_idx = q2(front2)\n\nfront1 = front1 +1\n\nfront2 = front2 +1\n\n! Compute positions to enqueue.\n\npos1 = mod(front1 + size1, n)\n\nif (pos1 ==0) then\n\n    pos1 =n\n\nend if\n\nq1(pos1) = temp_val\n\npos2 = mod(front2 + size2, n)\n\nif (pos2 ==0) then\n\n    pos2 =n\n\nend if\n\nq2(pos2) = temp_idx\n\nWait, but in the else case, the size remains the same. So size1 and size2 are not changed.\n\nThus, the code should be correct now.\n\nNow, putting all this into the Fortran code.\n\nWait, also, in the first part's loop, after dequeuing, the front is incremented, but the size remains the same in the else case.\n\nThus, the code for the else case is as above.\n\nNow, let's write the code with these corrections.\n\nThe full code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, ans\n\ninteger, allocatable :: values(:), q1(:), q2(:)\n\ninteger :: front1, front2, size1, size2\n\ninteger :: i, pos1, pos2, temp_val, temp_idx\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: s\n\ninteger :: count(0:255)\n\n!

So when computing pos1, the size1 is still the original size, not decreased.\n\nYes, because in the else case, the size is not changed. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing this code with sample inputs.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 5\n\n3 1 4\n\nThe first program's process:\n\nInitial queues:\n\nq1: [3,1,4], q2: [1,2,3]\n\nFirst iteration: q1(3) <=5 \u2192 yes. ans=1. Dequeue both queues. Now front1=2, front2=2, size1=2, size2=2.\n\nNext iteration: q1(1) <=5 \u2192 yes. ans=2. Dequeue. front1=3, front2=3, size1=1, size2=1.\n\nNext iteration: q1(4) >5? No, 4<=5 \u2192 yes. ans=3. Dequeue. Now size1=0. So ans is 3.\n\nThe output is 3. Then the second part processes \"3\" \u2192 the string is \"3\", which has length 1. So the second part outputs \"No\".\n\nAnother test case for first part:\n\nSample input from codeforces problem 450A:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 5\n\n3 1 4 \u2192 output 3.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5 4\n\n7 3 2 1 5 \u2192 let's see:\n\nInitial queues:\n\nq1:7,3,2,1,5 \u2192 q2:1,2,3,4,5.\n\nFirst iteration: 7>4 \u2192 subtract 3 \u21924. Enqueue back. So q1 becomes [3,2,1,5,4], q2 becomes [2,3,4,5,1].\n\nNext iteration: 3<=4 \u2192 yes. ans=2. Dequeue. Now queues are [2,1,5,4], q2 [3,4,5,1]. size1=4.\n\nNext iteration: 2<=4 \u2192 yes. ans=3. Dequeue. queues now [1,5,4], q2 [4,5,1]. size1=3.\n\nNext iteration:1<=4 \u2192 yes. ans=4. Dequeue. queues [5,4], q2 [5,1]. size1=2.\n\nNext iteration:5>4 \u2192 subtract 1 \u21921. Enqueue back. queues become [4,1], q2 [1,5]. \n\nNext iteration:4<=4 \u2192 yes. ans=1. Dequeue. queues [1], q2 [5]. size1=1.\n\nNext iteration:1<=4 \u2192 yes. ans=5. Dequeue. queues empty. So final ans is5.\n\nThus, the first program outputs 5. The second part processes \"5\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother test case for second part:\n\nInput string \"aabb\" \u2192 yes.\n\nIf the first program's ans is 1234 \u2192 the string is \"1234\" \u2192 four distinct characters, each once \u2192 no.\n\nIf ans is 1122 \u2192 \"1122\" \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
