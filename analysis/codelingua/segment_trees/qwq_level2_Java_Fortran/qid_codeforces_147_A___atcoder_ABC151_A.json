    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_147_A) reads a string from input. It processes it by adding a space before any Latin letter that comes after a non-Latin character. So like, if the input is \"a.b\", it would become \"a .b\"? Wait, no, let me see. The code appends the first character. Then for each next character, if it's a Latin letter, check if the previous character was not a Latin letter. If so, add a space before the current character. Also, punctuation is kept as is. So for example, \"a!b\" would become \"a! b\"? Because after the '!', which is punctuation, the next 'b' is a letter, so a space is added before 'b'.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes the output of the first, which is a string, and it seems to just take the first character of that string and output the next character in the ASCII sequence. Like if the first character is 'a', it outputs 'b'. But wait, the code is s.charAt(0) + 1. So adding 1 to the ASCII value. So for example, if the first character is 'z', it would become '{', but maybe that's okay as per the problem's requirements.\n\nWait, but the second program's main method only does that. The rest of the code in the second file (the RemRing class) is not used here. So I can ignore that part since it's not part of the main processing here. The second program's main is only taking the first character and adding 1 to it, then printing that.\n\nSo the overall sequence is: input string -> first program processes it into a new string with spaces added before letters after non-letters, then the second program takes that string's first character, increments its ASCII value by 1, and outputs that single character.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's input is read once at the start.\n- The second program's output is written at the end.\n- The intermediate processing must be done without any I/O in between.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the input string, process it through the first program's logic, then process the result through the second's logic, and then output the final result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string in Fortran. Since Fortran strings can be read with read(*,*) or read(*,'(A)').\n\n2. Process the string according to the first Java program's logic. Let's think about how to do that in Fortran.\n\nThe first program's processing:\n\n- Start with the first character.\n- For each subsequent character (i from 1 to n-1 in Fortran, since indices start at 1?), check if it's a Latin letter (a-z). If it is, check if the previous character was not a Latin letter. If so, add a space before it. Also, punctuation (.,!? ) are kept as is. So non-Latin letters and non-punctuation are ignored? Wait, the code in the first Java program appends the current character only if it's a Latin letter or punctuation. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the loop over i from 1 to n-1 (Java's 0-based):\n\nchar c = s.charAt(i);\n\nif (isLatinLetter(c)) {\n\n   if previous character was not Latin, add a space.\n\n   append c.\n\n} else if (isPunctuation(c)) {\n\n   append c.\n\n}\n\nSo other characters (like numbers, etc.) are not added. So the processed string only includes Latin letters and punctuation, with spaces added before letters following non-letters.\n\nWait, the first character is added regardless. Wait, the first character is added to the string builder. Then for the rest, the code checks if it's a Latin letter or punctuation. So any other characters (like numbers, etc.) are skipped? Because the code only appends if it's a Latin letter or punctuation. So the first program's processing removes any non-Latin and non-punctuation characters except the first character?\n\nWait, the first character is added to the string builder regardless. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe first character is added via sb.append(s.charAt(0)). Then for the rest (i starting at 1 in Java, which is the second character in the string), the code checks if the current character is a Latin letter or punctuation. If it's a Latin letter, then check the previous character (i-1) to see if it was a Latin letter. If not, add a space before the current character. Then append the current character. If it's punctuation, append it. Otherwise, it's ignored.\n\nSo the first character is always included, even if it's not a Latin letter or punctuation. Wait, no. Wait, the first character is added to the string builder, but in the loop, the code starts from i=1 (the second character). The first character is part of the initial setup. So the first character is included regardless of its type. The rest are only added if they are Latin letters or punctuation. So for example, if the input is \"123a\", then the first character is '1', then the next characters are '2', '3', 'a'. The 'a' is a Latin letter, so check previous character (3, which is not a letter). So add a space before 'a', so the result would be \"123 a\".\n\nWait, but the first character is '1', which is not a letter or punctuation. So the first character is kept, but the next characters (2,3) are not letters or punctuation, so they are not added. Wait, no. Wait, the code for the loop starts at i=1 (the second character in the string). For each i from 1 to n-1 (since in Java, the loop is for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)), so for each character after the first. The code checks if the current character is a Latin letter. If yes, then check previous character (i-1) to see if it was a Latin letter. If not, add a space. Then append the current character. Else, if it's punctuation, append it. Else, do nothing (so the current character is not added to the string).\n\nWait, so the first character is added, but the rest are only added if they are Latin letters or punctuation. So in the example \"123a\", the first character is '1', then the next characters (2,3) are not letters or punctuation, so they are not added. The 'a' is a letter. The previous character (the third character, which is '3') is not a letter, so a space is added before 'a'. So the result would be \"1 a\".\n\nWait, but the first character is '1', then the next characters (indices 1,2,3 in Java, which are the second, third, fourth characters in the string) are 2,3, a. The first loop iteration (i=1, which is the second character in the string, '2') is not a Latin letter, so it's skipped. The next (i=2, '3') also skipped. Then i=3 (the fourth character, 'a') is a letter. The previous character (i-1=2, which is '3') is not a letter, so add a space before 'a'. So the final string is \"1 a\".\n\nHmm, okay. So the first program's processing is to build a new string that includes the first character, then for each subsequent character, only include it if it's a letter or punctuation. And when adding a letter, check if the previous character (in the original string?) was a letter. Wait, the code uses s.charAt(i-1), which is the previous character in the original string. So the check is based on the original string's previous character, not the processed string's previous character. That's important.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The check for whether to add a space is based on the original string's previous character, not the processed string's. Because the code is looking at s.charAt(i-1), which is the original string's character. So even if the previous character in the original string was not added to the processed string (because it was not a letter or punctuation), the check is still done on the original's previous character.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is \"a!b\". The first character is 'a', added. The second character is '!', which is punctuation, so added. The third character is 'b', which is a letter. The previous character in the original string is '!', which is not a Latin letter, so a space is added before 'b'. So the processed string is \"a! b\".\n\nAnother example: original string is \"a1b\". The first character is 'a', added. The second character is '1', which is not a letter or punctuation, so it's skipped. The third character is 'b', which is a letter. The previous character in the original string is '1', which is not a letter, so a space is added before 'b'. So the processed string is \"a b\".\n\nWait, but the '1' is not added, so the processed string's previous character before 'b' is 'a', but the check is based on the original's previous character (the '1'). So the space is added even though the previous character in the processed string is 'a', but the original's previous was non-letter. So the check is based on the original string's previous character, not the processed string's.\n\nThis is important because in Fortran, when processing, I need to track the original string's characters, not the processed ones. So the processing must be done in a way that for each character in the original string (except the first), we check if it's a letter or punctuation. If it is a letter, then check the previous character in the original string (i-1) to see if it was a letter. If not, add a space before adding the current character. If it's punctuation, just add it. Otherwise, skip.\n\nSo the processing steps are:\n\nInitialize the processed string with the first character of the input.\n\nThen, for each character from the second to the end of the input string:\n\n- If the current character is a Latin letter (a-z):\n\n   - Check the previous character (original string's i-1) to see if it was a Latin letter.\n\n   - If not, add a space to the processed string.\n\n   - Add the current character to the processed string.\n\n- Else if the current character is punctuation (.,!?):\n\n   - Add it to the processed string.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - Do nothing (skip it).\n\nSo the processing is based on the original string's characters, not the processed string's.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to read the original string, process it into a new string according to these rules, then take the first character of that new string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, reading the input string. In Fortran, I can read a line with:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut need to handle variable length. Alternatively, use a large enough length. Let's assume the input is not too long. Alternatively, use a parameter.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's use a sufficiently large length, say 1000.\n\nThen, process the input_str into the first processed string.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the processing.\n\nThe first character is always added. So the processed_str starts with input_str(1:1).\n\nThen, loop over each character from 2 to len_trim(input_str).\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are fixed length, but the actual content is up to len_trim. So for each i from 2 to len_trim(input_str):\n\ncurrent_char = input_str(i:i)\n\nCheck if it is a Latin letter (a-z). Let's see, in Fortran, characters can be compared as integers. So for a character c, if ichar(c) >= 97 (a) and <= 122 (z), then it's a lowercase letter.\n\nWait, the Java code's isLatinLetter checks for a-z, so lowercase only. So in Fortran, same.\n\nThen, if it is a letter:\n\nCheck the previous character (input_str(i-1:i-1)) to see if it was a letter.\n\nIf the previous character was not a letter, then add a space before the current character.\n\nThen add the current character.\n\nElse if the current character is punctuation (.,!?):\n\nAdd it.\n\nElse, skip.\n\nSo the steps for each character (starting from i=2):\n\ncurrent_char = input_str(i:i)\n\nif (is_latin_letter(current_char)) then\n\n   prev_char = input_str(i-1:i-1)\n\n   if (is_latin_letter(prev_char) .eqv. .false.) then\n\n      append a space to processed_str\n\n   end if\n\n   append current_char to processed_str\n\nelse if (is_punctuation(current_char)) then\n\n   append current_char to processed_str\n\nelse\n\n   do nothing\n\nend if\n\nSo the functions is_latin_letter and is_punctuation need to be implemented as functions in Fortran.\n\nImplementing is_latin_letter:\n\nlogical function is_latin_letter(c)\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n   integer :: ich\n   ich = ichar(c)\n   is_latin_letter = (ich >= 97 .and. ich <= 122)\nend function\n\nSimilarly, is_punctuation:\n\nlogical function is_punctuation(c)\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n   is_punctuation = (c == '.' .or. c == ',' .or. c == '?' .or. c == '!')\nend function\n\nWait, the Java code's isPunctuation includes those four characters. So yes.\n\nNow, building the processed_str.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed length, so appending can be done by concatenation, but for efficiency, perhaps pre-allocate a buffer. But for simplicity, since the input is not too big, we can build it step by step.\n\nInitialize processed_str as the first character.\n\nprocessed_str = input_str(1:1)\n\nThen loop from i=2 to len_trim(input_str):\n\ncurrent_char = input_str(i:i)\n\nif (is_latin_letter(current_char)) then\n\n   prev_char = input_str(i-1:i-1)\n\n   if (.not. is_latin_letter(prev_char)) then\n\n      processed_str = processed_str // ' '\n\n   end if\n\n   processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n\nelse if (is_punctuation(current_char)) then\n\n   processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the string length is fixed. So when we do this, the processed_str will grow as we append. But in Fortran, when you concatenate, the resulting string is the length of the first string plus the second. So if the initial processed_str is length 1, then after appending a space and a character, it becomes 3, etc. So as long as the initial allocation is sufficient, it should work. Alternatively, we can use a character array with a large enough size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a character array of sufficient length, say 1000, and track the current length.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the string approach, assuming that the input is not too long.\n\nOnce the first processing is done, we have the processed_str.\n\nThen, the second program's processing is to take the first character of this processed_str, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that.\n\nSo, the second step is:\n\nTake the first character of processed_str (if it's empty, but the first program's processing starts with the first character of the input, so unless the input was empty, which is probably not considered here, the processed_str is at least length 1).\n\nSo, first_char = processed_str(1:1)\n\nnew_char = char(ichar(first_char) + 1)\n\nThen, output new_char.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, in Fortran code structure:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nProcess it into processed_str as per first program.\n\nThen process the first character as per second program.\n\nFinally, print the result.\n\nNow, handling the functions.\n\nIn Fortran, functions can be written as internal or external. Since this is a single program, I can write them as internal functions.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=1000) :: input_str, processed_str\n   integer :: i, len_input\n   character :: current_char, prev_char\n\n   ! Read input\n   read(*,'(A)',advance='no') input_str  ! Wait, in Fortran, reading a line with A may include trailing spaces. Hmm, but the Java code uses readLine(), which reads until the newline. So perhaps using a read statement that reads the entire line.\n\n   ! Alternatively, use a read with a format that reads until end of line.\n\n   ! Let me think: in Fortran, to read a line from stdin, you can do:\n\n   read(*,'(A)') input_str\n\n   ! But the input_str will be padded with spaces to the full length. So len_trim(input_str) gives the actual length.\n\n   ! Check if the input is empty? Well, the problem probably assumes input is non-empty.\n\n   ! Process the first step.\n\n   len_input = len_trim(input_str)\n\n   if (len_input == 0) then\n      ! handle empty input? Probably not needed, but maybe output nothing?\n      write(*,*) ''\n      stop\n   end if\n\n   processed_str = input_str(1:1)  ! first character\n\n   do i = 2, len_input\n      current_char = input_str(i:i)\n      if (is_latin_letter(current_char)) then\n         prev_char = input_str(i-1:i-1)\n         if (.not. is_latin_letter(prev_char)) then\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // ' '  ! Wait, but trim is not needed here. Because processed_str is built by appending, so it's not padded. Wait, the initial processed_str is input_str(1:1), which is length 1. Then each append adds to the end. So the processed_str is not padded with spaces. So trim is unnecessary here. So just:\n\n            processed_str = processed_str // ' '\n         end if\n         processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n      else if (is_punctuation(current_char)) then\n         processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Now process the second step.\n\n   ! Get first character of processed_str.\n\n   if (len_trim(processed_str) == 0) then\n      !

For example, if the previous character was not a letter, we add a space before the current character. So the code does:\n\nprocessed_str = processed_str // ' ' (if needed)\n\nthen append current_char.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"a.b\"\n\nFirst program's processing:\n\nFirst character 'a' is added.\n\nSecond character '.' is punctuation, so added. So processed_str is \"a.\".\n\nThird character 'b' is a letter. The previous character in the original string is '.', which is not a letter. So add a space before 'b'. So processed_str becomes \"a. \" then add 'b' \u2192 \"a. b\".\n\nThen the second program takes the first character 'a', adds 1 \u2192 'b', so output 'b'.\n\nSo the final output is 'b'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"z!\" \u2192 first program's output is \"z!\" \u2192 first character 'z' \u2192 'z' +1 \u2192 '{', but the output would be '{'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"A!b\" \u2192 but the first program's isLatinLetter checks for lowercase a-z. So 'A' is uppercase, so not considered a Latin letter here. Wait, the Java code's isLatinLetter is for a-z. So uppercase letters are not considered Latin letters here. So in the input \"A!b\", the first character is 'A', which is not a Latin letter (as per the Java code's definition). Then the second character is '!', punctuation, added. The third character 'b' is a letter. The previous character in the original string is '!', so not a letter. So add a space before 'b'. So processed_str is \"A! b\".\n\nThe first character is 'A', so adding 1 gives 'B', so output 'B'.\n\nWait, but in the first program's processing, the first character is added regardless of being a letter. So even if it's uppercase, it's included. The check for adding a space is based on the previous character in the original string being a letter (a-z). So uppercase letters would not be considered letters here. So in the example \"A!b\", the first character is 'A', which is not a Latin letter (as per the Java code's definition). The second character is '!', added. The third character 'b' is a letter. The previous character in the original string is '!', so the space is added. So the processed string is \"A! b\".\n\nThe second program takes the first character 'A', adds 1 \u2192 'B', so output 'B'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"a!B\" \u2192 the first program's processing:\n\nFirst character 'a' (letter). Second character '!' (punctuation). Third character 'B' (uppercase, not considered a letter here). So the third character is not a letter or punctuation (assuming 'B' is uppercase and not in a-z). Wait, the Java code's isLatinLetter is for a-z, so uppercase letters are not considered. So the third character 'B' is not added. So the processed_str is \"a! \" (wait, no, let's see:\n\nThird character is 'B', which is not a Latin letter (since it's uppercase). So in the loop for i=3 (third character in input_str):\n\ncurrent_char is 'B', which is not a Latin letter (since it's uppercase). So the code skips adding it. So the processed_str after processing the third character is still \"a!\" (from first two characters). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the third character is 'B', which is not a Latin letter (a-z). So the code checks if it's a letter (no), then checks if it's punctuation (no). So it's skipped. So the processed_str remains \"a!\".\n\nWait, the third character is 'B', so the code does nothing. So the processed_str is \"a!\".\n\nThen the second program takes the first character 'a', adds 1 \u2192 'b', so output 'b'.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, in the code, the functions are correctly checking for lowercase letters.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the functions are written correctly.\n\nNow, the code's read statement: in Fortran, when using read(*,'(A)') input_str, it reads the entire line, but the input_str is padded with spaces to the full length. So len_trim(input_str) gives the actual length.\n\nThe loop runs from i=2 to len_input (the length of the input string).\n\nThe processed_str is built by appending.\n\nNow, in the code, when appending a space and the current_char, the order is correct.\n\nNow, the second part: taking the first character of processed_str. Since processed_str is built by appending, it's a string with possible trailing spaces? No, because it's built by appending. The length is exactly the number of characters added. So the first character is at position 1, and the rest follow.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The input_str may have length exceeding 1000. But the problem probably expects that the input is within reasonable limits. Alternatively, use a larger length, like 10000.\n\n- The processed_str may exceed the length of 1000. Since the original input is 1000, the processed_str can be up to 1000*2 (if every character after the first requires a space and a character). So 2000. So perhaps set processed_str to length 2000.\n\nWait, in the code above, the processed_str is declared as len=1000. That could be a problem. Let me see:\n\nThe input_str is 1000 characters. The processed_str starts with 1 character. For each of the remaining 999 characters, in the worst case, each adds a space and a character (so 2 per character). So total length would be 1 + 999*2 = 1999. So 2000 is safe. So changing the declaration to:\n\ncharacter(len=2000) :: processed_str\n\nSimilarly, the input_str can be 1000, but if the input is longer, it would be truncated. So perhaps better to use a larger size, like 10000 for both.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, I can set the input_str to a larger length, say 10000, and processed_str to 20000.\n\nSo modifying the declarations:\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: input_str, processed_str\n\nThat should handle larger inputs.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the loop, when appending, the processed_str may exceed its allocated length. So using a larger length is better.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=10000) :: input_str, processed_str\n   integer :: i, len_input\n   character :: current_char, prev_char\n\n   ! Read input\n   read(*,'(A)',advance='no') input_str  ! Wait, in Fortran, the 'advance' is for the next read. Maybe not needed here.\n\n   ! Alternatively, just read(*,'(A)') input_str\n\n   read(*,'(A)') input_str\n\n   len_input = len_trim(input_str)\n\n   if (len_input == 0) then\n      write(*,*) ''\n      stop\n   end if\n\n   processed_str = input_str(1:1)\n\n   do i = 2, len_input\n      current_char = input_str(i:i)\n      if (is_latin_letter(current_char)) then\n         prev_char = input_str(i-1:i-1)\n         if (.not. is_latin_letter(prev_char)) then\n            processed_str = trim(processed_str) // ' '  ! Wait, but trim is not needed here. Because processed_str is built by appending, so it's not padded. So the current processed_str is exactly the characters added so far. So trim is unnecessary. So just:\n\n            processed_str = processed_str // ' '\n         end if\n         processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n      else if (is_punctuation(current_char)) then\n         processed_str = processed_str // current_char\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   ! Now process the second step.\n\n   if (len_trim(processed_str) == 0) then\n      write(*,*) ''\n   else\n      character :: first_char\n      first_char = processed_str(1:1)\n      integer :: c_val\n      c_val = ichar(first_char) + 1\n      character :: new_char\n      new_char = char(c_val)\n      write(*,'(A)') new_char\n   end if\n\ncontains\n\n   logical function is_latin_letter(c)\n      character, intent(in) :: c\n      integer :: ich\n      ich = ichar(c)\n      is_latin_letter = (ich >= 97 .and. ich <= 122)\n   end function is_latin_letter\n\n   logical function is_punctuation(c)\n      character, intent(in) :: c\n      is_punctuation = (c == '.' .or. c == ',' .or. c == '?' .or. c == '!')\n   end function is_punctuation\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first step, when building processed_str, the initial assignment is input_str(1:1). But if the input_str is longer than 1 character, then the loop starts at i=2. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the input_str has length 1. Then the loop doesn't run, and processed_str is just the first character. Then the second step takes that character, adds 1, and outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input \"a\" \u2192 processed_str is \"a\", so first character 'a' \u2192 'b' is output.\n\nAnother test case: input \"A\" \u2192 first character 'A' (not a letter), so processed_str is \"A\". The second step adds 1 \u2192 'B'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the loop, when appending, the processed_str may exceed the allocated length. So using len=10000 and 20000 would be better. Let me adjust the declarations to be larger.\n\nLet me set input_str to 10000 and processed_str to 20000.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: input_str\ncharacter(len=20000) :: processed_str\n\nThat should be sufficient.\n\nSo the final code would look like this with those changes.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, when you do 'processed_str = processed_str // ' ', the right-hand side must not exceed the left-hand side's length. So with the lengths set as above, it should be okay.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program should be as written, with the necessary variable lengths adjusted."
