So the second program would output NO unless the number's string ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed to have the second program's input be a string that ends with a vowel, but that requires the first program's output to be a number whose string representation ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC119_B) reads N numbers and their units (JPY or other). It converts all values to Yen: if the unit is JPY, it stays the same, else multiplied by 380000. Then sums them all and prints the total.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_49_A) reads a string, checks the last non-space and non-question mark character. If it's a vowel (including y), outputs YES, else NO.\n\nThe key is to chain them: the output of the first is the input of the second. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in the middle. So the first part's output must be passed as input to the second's processing, but all in one program.\n\nWait, but how do the two Java programs pass data? The first's output is a number (sum), which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code: it reads a line from input. So the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program is expecting a string (the line). So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a string. So the entire process is: take N entries, compute sum, then check if that sum (as a string) ends with a vowel, etc. Wait, but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The user says the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (sum), which is then the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"12345.67\", then the second program would process that string. So the final Fortran program must first process the first part (summing), then process the second part (checking the last character of the sum's string representation).\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the N entries), compute the sum, then process that sum as a string through the second program's logic, and output the final result (YES/NO).\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, then for each of N lines, read x and u (the unit). Wait, in the first Java program, each line has a number and a string. Wait, the first Java program's input is N followed by N lines each with x[i] and u[i]. So in Fortran, I need to read N, then loop N times, each time reading a double and a string (the unit). Then compute the sum as per the first program.\n\n2. Once the sum is computed, convert that sum into a string (as the second program would receive it as input). Then process that string as per the second Java program's logic: find the last non-space and non-? character, check if it's a vowel (lowercase), etc.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the first program's output formatted? The first Java program's System.out.println(solve(...)) would print the sum as a double. The exact formatting might matter here. For example, in Java, the default for printing a double is with . and possibly scientific notation? But the second program is expecting a string input. So the Fortran program must replicate the exact string that the first Java program would output, then process that string.\n\nHmm, but in the problem statement, the user says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So the Fortran program must first compute the sum as the first Java program does, then process that sum's string representation as the second Java program would process its input.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read N, then N pairs of x and u (the units). The units are strings, which in Fortran can be read as character arrays or strings.\n\n- Compute the sum as per the first program: for each entry, if the unit is \"JPY\", add x, else multiply by 380000 and add.\n\n- Then, convert the sum to a string exactly as the first Java program would output it. The Java code uses System.out.println(solve(...)), which for a double would print it with a decimal point, but the exact formatting (like number of decimal places) might be important. Wait, in Java, the default for printing a double is to use the platform's locale, but perhaps in the problem's context, it's just printed as is, maybe with one decimal? Or maybe it's printed with all decimal digits. Wait, the problem might not care about the exact formatting as long as the second program's processing is correct. Wait, but the second program is looking at the last character of the input string. So the way the first program's output is formatted (like trailing zeros, decimal points, etc.) will affect the result. For example, if the sum is 12345, the first program might output \"12345.0\" or \"12345\", which would change the last character.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The Java code for the first program uses System.out.println(solve(...)), and solve returns a double. The default printing of a double in Java may vary. For example, if the value is an integer, it might print without a decimal point. Let me check: in Java, when you print a double, if it's an integer value (like 123.0), it will print as \"123.0\", but maybe not? Wait, no. Let me think: the default is to print as many decimal digits as needed. For example, 123.0 would print as \"123.0\", but perhaps in some cases, it might print as \"123\". Wait, actually, the Java documentation says that the default is to use the platform's locale, but in many cases, it would print with a decimal point. For example, in the code, if the sum is an integer, like 100, then the printed value would be \"100.0\" or \"100\"? Hmm, this is a critical point because the second program's processing depends on the exact string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is the sum as a string with one decimal place, but I'm not sure. Since the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single program, perhaps the exact string representation must be the same as the Java code's output. To replicate that, I need to know how Java prints a double. Let me think: in Java, the default is to print with as many decimal digits as needed, but for integers, it would show .0. For example, 123 would be \"123.0\", 123.45 would be \"123.45\", and 123.0 would be \"123.0\". So the string would have a decimal point unless the value is an integer, but even then, it would have .0. Wait, no, actually, in Java, when you print a double, it uses the toString() method of Double, which for integer values like 123.0 would print \"123.0\". So the string would always have a decimal point unless the value is an integer but with .0, but it's still printed with .0. So the string would be something like \"123.0\" or \"123456.789\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, when converting the sum to a string, I need to replicate exactly how Java would print it. That's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is the sum as a string with one decimal place, but I'm not sure. Since the problem says to reproduce the same behavior, I have to make sure that the string passed to the second part is exactly what the first Java program would output.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to format the sum as a string in Fortran in the same way as Java does. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program's processing is not affected by decimal points. Let's see: the second program looks for the last non-space and non-? character. So if the first program's output is \"12345.67\", then the last character is '7', so the check would be on '7', which is not a vowel. But if the output is \"12345\", then the last character is '5', which is not a vowel. If the output is \"12345.0\", then the last character is '0', which is not a vowel. So the exact formatting of the first program's output is critical here.\n\nTherefore, to replicate the Java's output exactly, I need to format the sum as a string in Fortran in the same way as Java does. Let me think about how Java formats a double when printed. The Double.toString() method is used, which for a double value returns a string that is the closest possible representation. For example, for integer values, it appends .0. For numbers with fractional parts, it shows all significant digits. For very large or small numbers, it uses scientific notation. But in the problem's context, perhaps the inputs are such that the sum is a reasonable number (like in the first problem, the units could be in JPY or other, so the sum could be large if converted from other units). But the problem's test cases might not involve scientific notation. However, to be precise, I need to handle all cases.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects that the first program's output is printed as a string with one decimal place, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is only affected by the last character of the string, so maybe the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string (as per Java's default) ends with a certain character, and the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string (as per Java's default) is a string that the second program can process. Since the second program is looking for the last non-space and non-? character, perhaps the first program's output doesn't have any spaces or question marks, so the last character is the last character of the number's string representation.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after computing the sum, I need to convert it to a string exactly as Java would, then process that string.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran?\n\nIn Fortran, to replicate Java's Double.toString(), which is the same as the default string conversion, perhaps using a format that prints the number with enough decimal digits, but without scientific notation unless necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed with a decimal point and possibly trailing zeros, but I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose the sum is 12345.0. Java would print \"12345.0\". The second program would process that string. The last non-space and non-? character is '0', so the check would be on '0', which is not a vowel, so output NO.\n\nAnother example: if the sum is 12345.67, then the string is \"12345.67\", last character '7' \u2192 NO.\n\nIf the sum is 1234567890123456789.0 (a very large number), Java might print it in scientific notation, like \"1.234567890123456789E18\", so the last character is '8', but that's unlikely. But the problem's test cases may not have such cases. However, to be precise, the Fortran code must handle all cases as per Java's output.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem expects that the first program's output is printed as a string with one decimal place, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is only looking at the last character of the numeric value, ignoring the decimal point. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the first program's output is an integer, so the string ends with .0, so the last character is '0', but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program's input is the sum as a string, but the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number's string representation. So in Fortran, after computing the sum, I need to write it to a string variable, then process that string as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe key steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, then read N lines each with a number and a string (the unit).\n\n2. Compute the sum as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert the sum to a string exactly as Java would print it.\n\n4. Process that string as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nNow, the challenge is step 3: converting the sum to a string in Fortran in the same way as Java's Double.toString().\n\nIn Fortran, to get the same string representation, perhaps using the G0 format, which is the default. Let me recall: in Fortran, writing a real number with G0 would use either F or E format, whichever is more compact. But that might not match Java's behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a format that avoids scientific notation unless necessary, and shows all significant digits. For example, using a format like F20.10 would show 10 decimal places, but that might add trailing zeros. But Java's Double.toString() doesn't add trailing zeros beyond necessary. For example, 123.45 would be \"123.45\", not \"123.4500000000\".\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to use the same format as Java's default, which for numbers without fractional parts appends .0, and for others shows the necessary decimals. To do that in Fortran, perhaps using the following approach:\n\n- If the sum is an integer (i.e., the fractional part is zero), then write it as an integer followed by .0.\n\n- Else, write it with as many decimal digits as needed, without trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed with one decimal place, but I'm not sure. Since the problem is about code translation, perhaps the exact string representation is important, but without knowing the exact input, it's hard to replicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is not affected by the decimal point. For example, if the sum is 12345.67, the string is \"12345.67\", so the last non-space and non-? character is '7', so the check is on '7'. If the sum is 12345, the string is \"12345.0\", so the last character is '0', so the check is on '0'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's test cases are designed so that the first program's output is an integer, so the string ends with .0, so the last character is '0', which is not a vowel, so the second program would output NO. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is the sum as a string, but the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number's string representation. So in Fortran, after computing the sum, I can write it to a string variable using a format that matches Java's output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed as a string with one decimal place, so in Fortran, I can format it as, say, F12.1, but that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the first program's output is a number that when converted to a string (as per Java's default) ends with a vowel. For example, if the sum is 12345.0, then the last character is '0', which is not a vowel. But if the sum is 12345.6, then the last character is '6', which is not a vowel. Hmm, maybe the problem is designed so that the second program's input is the sum's string, but the actual test cases may not have such edge cases. Since the problem requires the Fortran program to behave identically, I need to find a way to replicate the exact string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is only looking at the last character of the string, so the key is to get the correct last character. To do that, perhaps in Fortran, after computing the sum, I can write it to a string using a format that matches Java's output, then process that string.\n\nIn Fortran, to get the same string as Java's Double.toString(), perhaps using the following approach:\n\n- Use the G0 format, which is the default, but that might use scientific notation for very large or small numbers.\n\nAlternatively, use the F format with sufficient decimal places, but that may add trailing zeros. For example, using F20.10 would show 10 decimal places, but that's more than necessary. However, Java's Double.toString() would not add trailing zeros beyond the necessary.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to use the same format as Java's Double.toString(). Let me look up how Java formats doubles.\n\nJava's Double.toString(double d) converts the double to a string using the following rules:\n\n- If the double is an integer (i.e., the fractional part is zero), it appends .0.\n\n- Otherwise, it prints the number in the shortest possible decimal form that uniquely identifies the double value.\n\nWait, actually, the exact rules are a bit more complex. The method returns the closest possible string representation that can be parsed back to the same double. For example, 1.0 becomes \"1.0\", 1 becomes \"1.0\", but wait, no. Wait, 1.0 is printed as \"1.0\", but 1 (as an integer) when cast to double would be 1.0, so printed as \"1.0\". Wait, but in the first Java program, the solve function returns a double, so even if the sum is an integer, it would be printed as a double with .0.\n\nWait, let me test with some examples:\n\n- If the sum is 123.0, then Java prints \"123.0\".\n\n- If the sum is 123.45, it prints \"123.45\".\n\n- If the sum is 123.4567890123456789, it might print \"123.45678901234567\" (depending on precision).\n\n- If the sum is 1e20, it would print in scientific notation like \"1.0E20\".\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this, I need to write the sum as a string in the same way. That's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed with one decimal place, so in Fortran, I can format it as F12.1, but that would add a decimal and one digit, which may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't involve numbers that require scientific notation or trailing zeros, so using a format like F20.10 would work, but that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's processing is only looking at the last character of the numeric part, ignoring the decimal point. For example, if the string is \"12345.67\", the last character is '7', so the check is on '7'. If the string is \"12345\", then the last character is '5', but that's only if the string is \"12345\" (without .0). But in Java, it would be \"12345.0\", so the last character is '0'.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the following approach:\n\nIn Fortran, after computing the sum, write it to a string using a format that avoids scientific notation and shows all necessary decimal digits, then process that string.\n\nThe steps in code:\n\nFirst, read N, then read N lines each with x and u. The units are strings, which in Fortran can be read as a character array of sufficient length (like 3 characters for \"JPY\" or \"other\").\n\nThen compute the sum as per the first program.\n\nThen, convert the sum to a string. To do this in Fortran, perhaps using a format that avoids scientific notation and shows the number as a decimal with sufficient precision. For example, using the F20.10 format, but that may add trailing zeros. Alternatively, using the G20.10 format, which switches to E notation if needed, but that might not be desired.\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach to get the string as per Java's Double.toString():\n\n- Use the G0 format, which is the default, but that may use scientific notation for large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such edge cases, so using a format like F20.10 would be sufficient, even if it adds trailing zeros. Because in the second program, the last non-space and non-? character would be the last digit before any trailing zeros. Wait, no. If the string is \"123.4500000000\", then the last non-space and non-? is '0', which is part of the trailing zeros. But in Java's output, it would be \"123.45\", so the last character is '5'. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. To get the exact string, perhaps the best way is to use the same logic as Java's Double.toString(). But how to do that in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed as a string with one decimal place, so in Fortran, I can format it as F12.1, but that would add a decimal and one digit even for integers. For example, 123 would become \"123.0\", which matches Java's output. 123.4 would be \"123.4\", which is correct. 123.45 would be \"123.5\" (rounded?), but that's not correct. Wait, F12.1 would round to one decimal place, which is not desired.\n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the following approach, even if it's not perfect, and see if it can be adjusted later.\n\nIn Fortran, after computing the sum, write it to a string using a format that avoids scientific notation and shows all decimal digits without trailing zeros. For example, using the following code:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: sum_str\nwrite(sum_str, '(G0)') sum_value\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps using the following format:\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(F0.0)') sum_value\n\nWait, F0.0 would format as an integer, but that would drop the decimal part. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the following approach:\n\nFirst, check if the sum is an integer. If so, write it as an integer followed by .0. Else, write it with as many decimal digits as needed.\n\nBut how to do that in Fortran?\n\nAlternatively, use the following code:\n\nsum_str = trim(adjustl(transfer(sum_value, ' '))) \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The transfer function is for converting between types, but not for formatting.\n\nAlternatively, use the following code:\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(G20.10)') sum_value\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is printed as a string with one decimal place, so in Fortran, I can use:\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(F12.1)') sum_value\n\nBut this would round to one decimal place, which may not be correct. For example, if the sum is 123.456, it would become \"123.5\", but Java would print \"123.456\".\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe the problem's test cases don't require high precision, so this approach is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's second program's processing is only looking at the last character of the numeric part, so even if there are trailing zeros, the last non-space and non-? is the last digit before the zeros. But in that case, the trailing zeros would be part of the string, so the last non-space and non-? would be the last zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's second program's input is the sum as an integer, so the string is like \"12345\", but in Java it would be \"12345.0\", so the last character is '0', which is not a vowel. So the second program would output NO.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's second program is designed to process the first program's output, which is a number, so the string is the number's string representation, and the second program checks the last character of that string.\n\nGiven that I can't know the exact input, I have to proceed with the best possible approach.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to use the G0 format in Fortran to write the sum to a string, then process that string.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: processing the string as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program reads a line (the entire input), then scans from the end backwards to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase).\n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n- Take the sum_str string (the output of the first part).\n\n- Iterate from the end of the string backward until a character that is not a space or '?' is found.\n\n- Convert that character to lowercase.\n\n- Check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\n- Output \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, strings are a bit different. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the sum_str is a character string. Let's say it's of length 100 (allocated sufficiently).\n\nWe need to loop from the end of the string backward until we find a character that is not a space or '?'. The first such character is the one to check.\n\nIn Fortran, the length of the string can be found with len_trim(sum_str), but since we allocated it as a fixed length, perhaps we need to find the first non-space from the end.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with a fixed length, trailing spaces are added. So if the string is \"123.0\", stored in a 100-character variable, the rest are spaces. So the actual content is up to the first non-space character from the end? No, no. The write statement would put the string starting at the first character, and the rest are spaces. So the actual content is from the first character to the end of the written string, and the rest are spaces. So to find the length of the actual content, we can use len_trim(sum_str).\n\nWait, len_trim gives the length of the string without trailing spaces. So the actual content is from 1 to len_trim(sum_str).\n\nTherefore, to process the string:\n\n1. Find the length of the string (excluding trailing spaces): l = len_trim(sum_str).\n\n2. Starting from position l down to 1:\n\n   a. For each position i from l downto 1:\n\n      i. If the character at i is not a space and not '?', then that's the character to check.\n\n      ii. Break the loop once found.\n\n3. Convert the character to lowercase.\n\n4. Check if it is a vowel.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: sum_str\ninteger :: l, i\nlogical :: is_vowel\ncharacter :: ch\n\nl = len_trim(sum_str)\nch = ' '  ! Initialize\ndo i = l, 1, -1\n   if (sum_str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. sum_str(i:i) /= '?') then\n      ch = sum_str(i:i)\n      exit\n   end if\nend do\n\nif (ch == ' ') then\n   ! No valid character found? Probably not possible as per problem's input.\n   ! But handle it somehow, maybe output NO.\nelse\n   ! Convert to lowercase\n   if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n      ch = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n   end if\n   ! Check vowels\n   is_vowel = (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y')\n   if (is_vowel) then\n      print *, 'YES'\n   else\n      print *, 'NO'\n   end if\nend if\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read N, then read N lines each with a number and a string (the unit). The units are strings, which in Fortran can be read as a character array. Since the unit can be \"JPY\" or other strings (like \"USD\" or whatever), but in the first Java program, the code checks if u[i].equals(\"JPY\"). So in Fortran, the unit strings need to be read as characters, and compared to \"JPY\".\n\nIn Fortran, reading the input:\n\nRead N first.\n\nThen, read N lines. Each line has a double and a string. The string can be read as a character array of sufficient length, say 4 (since \"JPY\" is 3 characters, but maybe others are longer? The problem's first Java program uses String, so any length. But in Fortran, perhaps we can read the unit as a character array of length, say, 10.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the unit is read with sc.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So each line has two tokens: the number and the unit. So in Fortran, each line can be read as a line, then split into the number and the unit.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a string, then parse it. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as two parts: the number and the unit. In Fortran, using list-directed input, which reads whitespace-separated tokens.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: N, i\ndouble precision :: x, total\ncharacter(len=10) :: unit\ntotal = 0.0d0\n\nread(*,*) N\n\ndo i = 1, N\n   read(*,*) x, unit\n   if (unit == 'JPY') then\n      total = total + x\n   else\n      total = total + x * 380000.0d0\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, comparing strings is case-sensitive. The Java code uses equals(\"JPY\"), so in Fortran, the unit must be exactly \"JPY\" (uppercase). So the input's unit strings must be read as uppercase. But in the Java code, the input is read with sc.next(), which preserves the case. So if the input has \"jpy\", it would not match. So in Fortran, the unit must be read exactly as input, and compared to \"JPY\".\n\nTherefore, the code above is correct as long as the input's unit strings are read correctly.\n\nNow, after computing total, we need to convert it to a string as per Java's output.\n\nThe problem is the string conversion. Let's proceed with using the G0 format, which is the default, and see.\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(G0)') total\n\nBut in Fortran, the G0 format may use scientific notation for large numbers. For example, if the total is 1e20, it would be written as \"1.0000000000000000E+020\", so the last non-space and non-? character would be '0', but the actual Java output would be \"1.0E20\" (or similar), so the last character is '0'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases don't have such large numbers, so this is acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i\ndouble precision :: x, total\ncharacter(len=10) :: unit\ncharacter(len=200) :: sum_str\ninteger :: l, pos\ncharacter :: ch\nlogical :: is_vowel\n\n! Read input and compute total\nread(*,*) N\ntotal = 0.0d0\ndo i = 1, N\n   read(*,*) x, unit\n   if (unit == 'JPY') then\n      total = total + x\n   else\n      total = total + x * 380000.0d0\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Convert total to string as per Java's output\nwrite(sum_str, '(G0)') total\n\n! Process the string as per second Java program\nl = len_trim(sum_str)\npos = 0\nch = ' '  ! default\ndo i = l, 1, -1\n   if (sum_str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. sum_str(i:i) /= '?') then\n      ch = sum_str(i:i)\n      exit\n   end if\nend do\n\nif (ch == ' ') then\n   ! No valid character found, perhaps output NO\n   print *, 'NO'\nelse\n   ! Convert to lowercase\n   if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n      ch = char(ichar(ch) + 32)\n   end if\n   ! Check vowels\n   is_vowel = (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y')\n   if (is_vowel) then\n      print *, 'YES'\n   else\n      print *, 'NO'\n   end if\nend if\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the string conversion, using G0 may include an exponent part. For example, if the total is 1234567890123456789.0, then in Java it would be printed as \"1.234567890123456789E18\", so the string would be \"1.234567890123456789E18\". The last non-space and non-? character is '8', so the check would be on '8', which is not a vowel. In Fortran's G0 format, it would also write in scientific notation, so the processing would be correct.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345.67 \u2192 Java's output is \"12345.67\", so the last character is '7', so the code would output NO.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345 \u2192 Java's output is \"12345.0\", so the last non-space and non-? is '0', so output NO.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345.0 \u2192 same as above.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345.6 \u2192 last character '6' \u2192 NO.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345.0 \u2192 last character '0' \u2192 NO.\n\nAnother example: total is 12345.6789 \u2192 last character '9' \u2192 NO.\n\nHmm, but what if the total is 12345.0y? No, the total is a number, so the string won't have letters. So the only letters in the string would be in the exponent part (like E in scientific notation). For example, \"1.2345E+10\" \u2192 last character '0', so NO.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is the first program's output, which is a number. So the string will only contain digits, decimal points, and possibly 'E' or 'e' in scientific notation. So the only possible letters are 'E' or 'e', which are not vowels. So the second program would output NO unless the last character is a vowel digit, which is impossible. Wait, but digits are not vowels. So the second program would always output NO unless the last character is a vowel letter, but the first program's output is a number, so the string can't have letters except in scientific notation (E or e). So the second program would output NO unless the last character is a vowel letter, but that's impossible. So perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the first program's output ends with a vowel letter, but that's not possible with numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program is not processing the first program's output, but the first program's output is the input to the second program. Wait, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"12345.67\", then the second program reads that as a string and processes it. The second program looks for the last non-space and non-? character. In this case, the last character is '7', so the check is on '7', which is not a vowel \u2192 output NO.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is \"apple\"? No, the first program outputs a number. So the second program's input is a number's string representation, which can't have vowels except in scientific notation's exponent part (like 'E' or 'e'). So the second program would output NO unless the number's string ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed to have the second program's input be a string that ends with a vowel, but that requires the first program's output to be a number whose string representation ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program is not part of the first's output. Wait, the user says the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. The first program's output is a number (sum), so the second program reads that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"12345.67\", then the second program reads that string and processes it. The second program's code is looking for the last non-space and non-? character. In this case, the last character is '7', so the check is on '7', which is not a vowel \u2192 output NO.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is \"12345\"? Then the string is \"12345.0\" (Java's output), so the last character is '0' \u2192 NO.\n\nHmm, so the second program would always output NO unless the first program's output is a number whose string representation ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed with a different scenario. Maybe the first program's output is a string that contains letters, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me recheck the first Java program's code.\n\nThe first Java program's solve function returns the sum of x[i] multiplied by 1 or 380000. So the output is a double. The second program reads a string, which is the first program's output. So the second program's input is the string representation of the sum. The second program's code processes that string.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nIt reads the entire line (s = sc.nextLine()), then loops from the end backwards to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then checks if that character is a vowel (lowercase).\n\nSo, for example, if the first program's output is \"12345.67\", then the second program's input is that string. The last non-space and non-? character is '7', so output NO.\n\nIf the first program's output is \"12345?\", then the last non-? and non-space is '5', so output NO.\n\nIf the first program's output is \"12345a\", then the last character is 'a', which is a vowel \u2192 YES.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so the string can't have letters unless the number is in scientific notation with 'E' or 'e'. For example, if the sum is 1e20, then the string is \"1.0E20\", so the last non-space and non-? is '0', so NO.\n\nHmm, so the only way the second program would output YES is if the first program's output's string ends with a vowel letter (like 'a', 'e', etc.), but that's only possible if the number's string representation has such a character. Since numbers can't have letters except in scientific notation (E or e), which are not vowels, the second program would always output NO. But that can't be the case. Perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a number but a string. No, the first program's code clearly outputs a double via System.out.println(solve(...)), so it's a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program's input is not the first program's output, but the first program's input? No, the user says the output of each is the input to the next.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's second Java program is not the one I thought. Let me recheck the second Java code.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\npublic class codeforces_49_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        String s = sc.nextLine();\n        int length = s.length();\n        char ch = 0;\n        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n                ch = s.charAt(i);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        ch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n        if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u' || ch == 'y') {\n            System.out.println(\"YES\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"NO\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAh! The second program reads the entire line (sc.nextLine()), so the input is a single line. The first program's output is a single line (the sum as a double), so the second program reads that line as its input.\n\nThe second program then processes that line. The key is that the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is a string like \"12345.67\" or \"12345.0\".\n\nThe second program's code looks for the last character that is not a space or '?'. Since the first program's output doesn't have spaces or '?', the last character is the last character of the number's string.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIf the first program outputs \"12345.67\", the last character is '7' \u2192 NO.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"12345.0\", the last character is '0' \u2192 NO.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"12345\", then the string is \"12345.0\" \u2192 last character '0' \u2192 NO.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"12345.6\", last character '6' \u2192 NO.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"12345.0y\", but that's not possible.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a number like 12345.0y? No, the first program's output is a number, so it can't have letters.\n\nSo the second program will always output NO unless the first program's output's string ends with a vowel letter, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is designed with a different scenario, but I must proceed with the code as per the given Java programs.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code I wrote earlier should be correct, even if the second program's output is always NO in this context.\n\nNow, checking the code again:\n\nThe first part reads N, then N lines of x and unit. The units are read as a 10-character string. The comparison is unit == 'JPY', which is case-sensitive. The Java code uses equals(\"JPY\"), so the Fortran code must have the unit exactly as 'JPY' (uppercase). So if the input has lowercase 'jpy', it won't be counted as JPY, which matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nThe sum is computed correctly.\n\nThe string conversion uses G0 format. For example, if the sum is 12345.67, the string is \"12345.67\", so the last character is '7'.\n\nThe processing of the string is correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work as required."
