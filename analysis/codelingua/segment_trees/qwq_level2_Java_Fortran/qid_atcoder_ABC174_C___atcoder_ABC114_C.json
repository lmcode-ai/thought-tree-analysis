    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K from input. It checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returning -1 in those cases. If divisible by 7, it divides K by 7, then multiplies by 9. Then it calculates the minimal number of steps where (10^ans mod K) equals 1, which is the answer. The output of this is the solve() function's return value.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C) takes an integer N, then counts numbers up to N that contain 3,5,7 and also follows some digit transformation. Wait, actually, looking at the code, the second program's main loop starts with i=357 and increments in a specific way. The loop checks if the current number contains all three digits, and counts them. The way it generates the next number is a bit tricky. The code uses a while loop where i starts at 357 and continues as long as it's <= N. The next i is generated by some string manipulation. The process involves building a new number by appending digits in a certain pattern, then parsing it as a long. The count c is incremented whenever the current number has all three digits.\n\nThe key here is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the solve() result) is the K for the second program's N? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is the result of solve(), which is an integer. The second program's input is N, which is read via gi(). So the first program's output is the input to the second program. Therefore, the first program's output is the N for the second program. Wait, no, the second program's first line is int N = gi(); so the input to the second program is N. But in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is the N for the second program. Therefore, the second program's N is the first program's solve() result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the K for the first program), compute the first program's result, then use that result as N for the second program's processing, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the K for the first part).\n2. Compute the first part's solve() function, which gives an integer (could be -1).\n3. Then, if the first part's result is -1, then the second part's N would be -1, but the second program's code would process that? Wait, but in the second Java program, N is read as an integer. If the first program returns -1, then the second program would have N = -1, but the loop condition i <= N would not run (since i starts at 357 which is larger than -1). So the count would be 0. So in the Fortran code, we need to handle that case.\n\nBut first, let's structure the Fortran program.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the initial input (the K for the first part) from stdin.\n- Compute the first part's result (solve function).\n- Then, use that result as N for the second part's processing.\n- Finally, output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran functions.\n\nFirst, the first part's solve function:\n\nThe first Java program's solve function:\n\nReads K, checks if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 returns -1.\n\nIf divisible by 7, divide by 7, then multiply by 9 \u2192 K becomes (K/7)*9? Wait, original code:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7; then K *=9.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, so first, K is read. Then, if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7 \u2192 if yes, divide by 7. Then multiply by 9. Then compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1. The remainder starts at 10 mod K (since 10^1 mod K is 10 mod K). Then each step multiplies remainder by 10 mod K. So the loop continues until remainder is 1 again. The ans is the number of steps.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part's function would take K as input, compute this, and return the result.\n\nNow, the second part's function takes N as input (the result from first part) and returns the count c.\n\nThe second Java program's main function:\n\nint N = gi();\n\nThen, the loop starts with i=357, and increments in a certain way. The loop runs while i <= N. For each i, check if it contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c. Then generate the next i via some string manipulation.\n\nThe next i is generated as follows:\n\nTake the current i as a string s.\n\nThen, process the digits from right to left (since the loop is for j from 0 to s.length-1, but the index is s.length-1 -j, so starting from the last character, moving left).\n\nThe code builds a new string sb. The logic is:\n\n- For each character in reverse order (starting from the end of the string):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the current character is '3', then append '5' and set f to true.\n\n      else if it's '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3'.\n\n   else:\n\n      append the current character as is.\n\n   After processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3'.\n\nThen, reverse the string (since the sb is built in reverse order?), wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuilder sb. The loop is over the characters of s in reverse order (since s.length-1 -j, starting from the end). The first character processed is the last digit of the original number. The code builds the new string by processing each digit from the end towards the start. The 'f' flag is used to determine when to start appending the next digits.\n\nWait, the code's logic for building the next i is a bit complex. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe code:\n\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n\nboolean f = false;\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\n    char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j); // the j-th character from the end (starting at 0, so first is last character)\n\n    if (f) {\n\n        sb.append(a);\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a == '3') {\n\n            sb.append('5');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else if (a == '5') {\n\n            sb.append('7');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            sb.append('3');\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nThen, the sb is reversed again? Because the next step is:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuffer (which is similar to StringBuilder) and reverses it. Let me see:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the digits from the end of the original number. The first character processed is the last digit of the original number. The code builds the new string as follows:\n\n- The first character (from the end) is processed with f initially false.\n\nSo for the first character (the last digit of the original number):\n\nIf it's '3', then we append '5', set f to true. So the next digits (moving left) will be appended as is.\n\nElse if it's '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\nElse, append '3', and f remains false?\n\nWait, in the else clause (when a is not 3 or 5), then we append '3', and f remains false.\n\nWait, the code's else clause is:\n\nelse {\n\n    sb.append('3');\n\n}\n\nSo in that case, f is still false. So the next characters (moving left) will be processed with f still false, so their processing depends on their value.\n\nWait, but after the first character, the next characters (the previous digits in the original number) are processed with f still false unless the first character's processing set f to true.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the current i is 357 (the starting value). The string s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (so first '7', then '5', then '3').\n\nj=0: a is '7' (since s.length() is 3, so s.length-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 index 2 is '7').\n\nSince f is false, check a == '3'? No. '5'? No. So append '3', and f remains false.\n\nj=1: a is '5' (index 1). f is still false.\n\na is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nj=2: a is '3' (index 0). Now f is true, so append '3'.\n\nSo the sb after the loop is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the first step (j=0, a is '7'):\n\nappend '3', so sb is \"3\".\n\nThen j=1 (a is '5'):\n\nsince f is still false (because in first step, after appending '3', f was not set to true?), wait no. Wait in the first step, when a is '7', the code is in the else clause (since a is not 3 or 5?), so it appends '3' and leaves f as false.\n\nWait, the code for a == '3' \u2192 append '5' and set f to true.\n\nElse if a == '5' \u2192 append '7' and set f to true.\n\nElse (a is not 3 or 5) \u2192 append '3', and f remains false.\n\nSo in the first step (a is '7'), the else clause is taken, so append '3', and f remains false.\n\nThen j=1 (a is '5'):\n\nsince f is still false, check a is '5', so append '7' and set f to true.\n\nThen j=2 (a is '3'):\n\nsince f is now true, append '3'.\n\nSo the sb after the loop is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, after the loop, check if f is false? In this case, f is true (from the second step), so no append.\n\nThen, the code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 which is \"373\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nSo the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the original code's next i is parsed from the reversed string. Wait, the code is:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb2 is a StringBuffer initialized with sb. Then, when you call reverse(), it reverses the characters in sb2, then toString() gives the reversed string. So the next i is the reversed string of the sb's content.\n\nWait, in the example above, the sb is \"373\", so reversing it gives \"373\", so the next i is 373. So the next iteration would process 373.\n\nHmm, perhaps the process is to generate the next number by taking the current number's digits, and for the first digit from the end that is 3,5,7, increment it in a certain way, and then append 3 if needed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating the next number in a sequence that starts with 357 and then follows some pattern where each next number is formed by modifying the digits in a specific way.\n\nThe key is to translate this logic into Fortran.\n\nNow, the second part's function takes N and returns the count c of numbers up to N that contain 3,5,7 and also follow the generation path.\n\nThe steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nWe need to:\n\nInitialize i as 357, c as 0.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n   Check if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   Then generate the next i via the transformation described.\n\nThe problem is to implement the transformation of i into the next value.\n\nThe transformation steps:\n\nTake the current i as a string s.\n\nProcess each character from the end (right to left):\n\nBuild a new string as per the rules.\n\nThen reverse it to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits from the end (right to left), and then the final string is reversed again to form the next number.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nThe code builds the new string in the following way:\n\nThe loop processes each character from the end (starting with the last digit, then previous, etc.), and builds the new string in a way that the first modified digit is the first in the new string, but then when reversed, it becomes the next number.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is building the next number by modifying the digits from the right, and then reversing the result to get the next number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is building the next number by modifying the digits in a way that the first change is made to the rightmost possible digit that can be incremented, and then appending 3 if needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating the next number in a sequence where each step appends a digit or modifies existing digits in a specific way.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of the transformation as a function that takes a number and returns the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet me take another example. Let's say current i is 357:\n\nProcessing as before gives next i as 373.\n\nThen, next step:\n\ni is 373. Let's process it.\n\ns = \"373\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (digits are '3', '7', '3').\n\nWait, the digits are '3', '7', '3' (since the string is \"373\").\n\nWait, the first character processed is the last digit (third character, which is '3').\n\nj=0: a is '3' (since s.length() is 3, so s.length-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 index 2 is '3').\n\nf is initially false.\n\nSince a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\nj=1: a is '7' (index 1). Since f is now true, append '7'.\n\nj=2: a is '3' (index 0). f is true, so append '3'.\n\nSo the sb after the loop is \"5\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"573\".\n\nThen, reverse it \u2192 \"375\".\n\nWait, the sb is \"573\", reversed becomes \"375\". So the next i is 375.\n\nWait, but the code's next i would be 375. Let's see:\n\nYes, because the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the next i is 375.\n\nSo the next step would check if 375 contains all three digits (3,5,7). 375 has 3,5 but not 7 \u2192 so it doesn't count. So c remains the same.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo the transformation is a bit involved. To implement this in Fortran, I need to:\n\nFor a given i (as a string), process each character from the end, building a new string according to the rules, then reverse it to get the next i.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Convert the current i to a string.\n\n2. Process each character from the end (right to left):\n\n   Initialize a new string (character array), and a flag f = .false.\n\n   For each character in reverse order (starting from the last character):\n\n      if f is false:\n\n          if current_char is '3', then append '5', set f to true.\n\n          else if current_char is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n          else (current_char is not 3 or 5 \u2192 like '7' or others?), append '3', leave f as false.\n\n      else:\n\n          append current_char as is.\n\n   After processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3'.\n\n3. Reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, but the code's process is that the new string is built in the order of processing from the end, and then reversed. So the final next i is the reversed string of the built string.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn the first example, the built string was \"373\", then reversed gives \"373\".\n\nWait, no, in the first example with 357:\n\nThe built string after processing was \"373\", then reversed gives \"373\".\n\nWait, but in the second example with 373, the built string was \"573\", reversed gives \"375\".\n\nYes, so the next i is the reversed string of the built string.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Take the current number as a string s.\n\n- Process each character from the end (right to left) to build a new string (call it temp_str).\n\n- Reverse temp_str to get the next number's string.\n\n- Convert that to a number.\n\nSo in Fortran, to implement this:\n\nWe can write a function that takes an integer i and returns the next i.\n\nFirst, converting the integer to a string. In Fortran, we can use write(*,*) to a string.\n\nThen, process each character in reverse order.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code.\n\nFunction next_i(i) result(new_i)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: i\n\ninteger :: new_i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, temp_str, reversed_str\n\ninteger :: len, j\n\nlogical :: f\n\ns = trim(adjustl( str(i) ))  ! Need a function to convert integer to string.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, perhaps using an internal write:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, len = len_trim(s)\n\ntemp_str = ''\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, len\n\n   current_char = s(len - j + 1: len - j +1)  ! The j-th character from the end.\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (current_char == '3') then\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '5'\n\n          f = .true.\n\n      else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '7'\n\n          f = .true.\n\n      else\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      temp_str = temp_str // current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\nend if\n\n! Now reverse temp_str to get reversed_str.\n\nreversed_str = ''\n\ndo j = len_trim(temp_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = reversed_str // temp_str(j:j)\n\nend do\n\n! Now parse reversed_str to integer.\n\nread(reversed_str, *) new_i\n\nend function next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string handling is a bit more involved. Also, the length of the string may vary, so need to manage that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using character arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array for temp_str and reversed_str.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with the above approach, assuming that the string functions work as needed.\n\nNow, the main part of the second program is:\n\nInitialize i = 357, c =0.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n   check if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'.\n\n   if yes, increment c.\n\n   compute next_i as the function above.\n\n   set i = next_i.\n\nOnce the loop ends, output c.\n\nSo the second part's function would take N and return c.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial K (the input to the first program).\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (call it N_result).\n\n   - If N_result is -1, then the second part's N is -1, so the loop won't run (since i starts at 357 which is > -1), so c remains 0.\n\n3. Compute the second part's result (c) using N_result as N.\n\n4. Output c.\n\nNow, implementing the first part's solve function in Fortran.\n\nThe first part's solve function:\n\nFunction solve(K) result(ans)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: K\n\ninteger :: ans\n\nif (mod(K,2) == 0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n   ans = -1\n\n   return\n\nend if\n\nif (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nans = 1\n\nremainder = mod(10, K)\n\ndo while (remainder /=1)\n\n   ans = ans +1\n\n   remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nend do\n\nend function solve\n\nWait, but in the original code, after dividing by 7, K is multiplied by 9. So the code is:\n\nK = (original K divided by 7 if divisible) then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nthen K *=9.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: K, N_result, c\n\n!

Convert reversed_str to integer\n\nread(reversed_str, *) new_i\n\nnext_i = new_i\n\nend function next_i\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there are some issues here.\n\nFirst, in the count_numbers function, the code to check for 3,5,7 is missing the loop variable j. Also, the function to convert integer to string is needed. The code uses 'str(i)', but in Fortran, there's no built-in function like that. So the code for converting to string must be done via write.\n\nIn the count_numbers function, the line:\n\ns = trim(adjustl( str(i) )) \n\nshould be replaced with:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nSimilarly, in the next_i function, the same approach is used.\n\nAlso, in the count_numbers function, the loop over j in the has3, etc. check must be properly defined.\n\nLet me correct the count_numbers function:\n\ninteger function count_numbers(N)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: N\n\ninteger :: i, next_i, c\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nlogical :: has3, has5, has7\n\nc =0\n\ni =357\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ! Check if i contains 3,5,7\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') i\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   has3 = .false.\n\n   has5 = .false.\n\n   has7 = .false.\n\n   integer :: j\n\n   do j=1, len_trim(s)\n\n      select case (s(j:j))\n\n      case ('3')\n\n         has3 = .true.\n\n      case ('5')\n\n         has5 = .true.\n\n      case ('7')\n\n         has7 = .true.\n\n      end select\n\n   end do\n\n   if (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Compute next_i\n\n   i = next_i(i)\n\nend do\n\ncount_numbers = c\n\nend function count_numbers\n\nAlso, in the next_i function, the variable current_char is used but not declared. Need to declare it as a character.\n\nIn the next_i function:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: current_char\n\nInside the loop:\n\ncurrent_char = s(len -j +1: len -j +1)\n\nWait, the substring is s(start: end). So for the j-th character from the end, the position is len -j +1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue is handling leading zeros when converting to string, but since we are dealing with numbers, the write statement with '(i0)' should avoid leading zeros.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nIf the first part returns -1, then N_result is -1. The second part's loop starts with i=357, which is greater than N_result (-1), so the loop doesn't run, c remains 0. So the output is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when K is 7 (divisible by 7). Then K becomes 1 (7/7=1), multiplied by 9 \u2192 9. Then solve function computes the minimal ans where 10^ans mod 9 =1.\n\n10 mod 9 is 1. So remainder is 1, so ans is 1. So N_result is 1. Then the second part's N is 1. The loop starts with i=357 which is larger than 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: K=7, so first part returns 1. Second part's N=1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case: K=1 (but 1 is not divisible by 2 or 5, so proceed. K is 1*9=9. Then remainder is 10 mod9=1 \u2192 ans=1. So N=1. Again, output 0.\n\nAnother test case where the first part returns a valid N.\n\nSuppose K=3 (not divisible by 2 or 5, not divisible by 7. So K*9=27. Then compute ans where 10^ans mod27 =1.\n\nLet's see:\n\n10 mod27 is 10.\n\nans=1 \u2192 remainder 10.\n\nans=2 \u2192 10*10 mod27 \u2192 100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 remainder 19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder 1. So ans=3.\n\nSo N_result is 3. The second part's N is 3. The loop starts with i=357 which is larger than 3 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So output 0.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAnother test case where the second part's N is 357. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first part returns 357. Then N=357.\n\nThe loop starts with i=357. Check if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 1.\n\nThen compute next_i(357):\n\nAs before, the next_i is 373.\n\nCheck if 373 <=357? No. So loop ends. So total c is 1.\n\nThus, the output would be 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the next_i function, the code for reversing the temp_str is done by building reversed_str character by character from the end of temp_str.\n\nWait, in the next_i function:\n\nreversed_str is built by taking each character from the end of temp_str to the beginning.\n\nYes, the loop:\n\ndo j = len_trim(temp_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = reversed_str // temp_str(j:j)\n\nend do\n\nThis will reverse the temp_str.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran program should look like this, with the necessary functions and corrections.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, functions can be inside the program using the 'contains' block.\n\nAlso, the next_i function must be inside the contains block, and the count_numbers function must call next_i, so they need to be in the same scope.\n\nThe code structure should be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: K, N_result, c\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nN_result = solve(K)\n\nc = count_numbers(N_result)\n\nprint*, c\n\ncontains\n\n! Define solve function here\n\n! Define count_numbers function here, which calls next_i\n\n! Define next_i function here\n\nend program main\n\nNow, the code for the functions:\n\nThe solve function is straightforward.\n\nThe count_numbers function needs to call next_i, so it must be in the same scope.\n\nThe next_i function is as above, with the necessary variables.\n\nNow, the code for the next_i function:\n\ninteger function next_i(i)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, temp_str, reversed_str\n\ninteger :: len, j\n\nlogical :: f\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: current_char\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nlen = len_trim(s)\n\ntemp_str = ''\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo j =1, len\n\n   current_char = s(len -j +1: len -j +1)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (current_char == '3') then\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '5'\n\n          f = .true.\n\n      else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '7'\n\n          f = .true.\n\n      else\n\n          temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      temp_str = temp_str // current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\nend if\n\nreversed_str = ''\n\ndo j = len_trim(temp_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = reversed_str // temp_str(j:j)\n\nend do\n\nread(reversed_str, *) next_i\n\nend function next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading from a string, sometimes you have to use an internal read. The line:\n\nread(reversed_str, *) new_i\n\nBut in the function, the variable is next_i, so:\n\nread(reversed_str, *) next_i\n\nWait, but in the function, the function's result is next_i, so the code should be:\n\nread(reversed_str, *) next_i\n\nYes.\n\nPutting all together, the final Fortran code should look like this."
