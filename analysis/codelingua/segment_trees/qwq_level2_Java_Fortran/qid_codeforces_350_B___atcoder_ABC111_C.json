Let me check the code. Looking at the code:\n\nThe code has a loop for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) b[i] = scanner.nextInt();\n\nThen in the processing, there's a condition x !=0. So b[i] can be 0. So the num array in Java is size n+1, but the indices for num are from 1 to n, but if b[i] can be 0, then the num array's indices must go up to n, but 0 is also possible. Wait, in Java, the array is declared as int num[] = new int[n+1]; so indices 0 to n. So in the code, when b[i] is 0, then num[0] is incremented. So in Fortran, the num array must be from 0 to n. So in Fortran, perhaps declare num(0:n). So in Fortran:\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n), num(0:n))\n\nThen read the a array:\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n) Then read the b array:\n\nread(*,*) (b(i), i=1,n)\n\nThen initialize num to zero:\n\nnum = 0\n\nThen loop over b to count: do i = 1, n\n\n   num(b(i)) = num(b(i))",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_350_B). It reads two arrays a and b of size n+1 (indices 1-based). Then it counts occurrences of each element in b using the num array. The main logic seems to find the longest path starting from elements where a[i] is 1, following the b array pointers, and building a string of indices in reverse. The output is the maximum length (ans) and the reversed string (ss).\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC111_C) reads an array v of size n, then counts occurrences in even and odd positions, and overall. It then sorts these counts in descending order and calculates some minimum value based on the top counts. The output is this minimum value.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. But since we need to combine them into a single Fortran program, I need to process the first's output as input to the second's logic without actual I/O in between. So the first part's output variables (ans and ss) must be used as inputs to the second part's processing.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is the array v, which is read from stdin. However, the first program's output is two lines: the ans (integer) and the string ss. So the second program's input would be those two lines? Or maybe the first program's output is the input to the second's input? Wait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects an integer n followed by n integers. Hmm, this is a problem because the first program's output is two lines: the first line is ans (integer), the second line is the string ss. But the second program expects n followed by n numbers. So perhaps the first program's output is not directly the input to the second. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user says the programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. But the second program's input is n followed by n numbers. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. But the first program's output is two lines: the first line is the ans (integer), the second line is the string. So that can't be. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second's input? But the second program's input is n followed by n numbers. So maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program is run with the first's output as input? Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program. But the second program's input is n followed by n numbers. So the first program's output must be structured as n followed by n numbers. But looking at the first Java program's output, it prints ans and then the string. So that's two lines. So perhaps the first program's output is not compatible with the second's input. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait the user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects its input to be n followed by n numbers. So the first program's output must be exactly that. But the first program's output is two lines: the first line is the ans (integer), the second line is the string. So that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the way they are structured, their outputs and inputs must align. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is not the same as the first's output. That would be a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are separate, and the user wants to chain them, but the actual input to the second program is the output of the first. But the first's output is two lines, which may not be compatible with the second's input. Hmm, perhaps the second program's input is the first's output. Let me check the second Java program's input requirements.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC111_C) reads n followed by n integers. So the first program's output must be exactly that. The first program's output is two lines: the first line is an integer (ans), the second line is a string (ss). So unless the ans is n and the string is the list of numbers, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence, each taking their own input. But the user says the output of each is used as input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be exactly what the second program expects as input. But that's only possible if the first program's output is n followed by n numbers. But the first program's output is two lines: the first line is ans (the maximum length), the second line is the string of indices. So that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is not the same as the first's output. That would be impossible. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, or perhaps I need to re-examine the code.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is:\n\nSystem.out.println(ans);\n\nSystem.out.println(ss);\n\nSo two lines: first the integer ans, then the string ss.\n\nThe second program's input is:\n\nn = sc.nextInt();\n\nthen n numbers.\n\nSo the second program expects the first line to be n, then n numbers. So the first program's output must be such that the first line is n, and the second line has n numbers. But the first program's output is two lines, first line is ans (the maximum length), second line is the string. So unless the ans is n and the string is the list of numbers, but that's not the case. Therefore, perhaps the two programs are not meant to be chained in that way, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does the same as the sequence. Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. Therefore, the first program's output must be exactly what the second program expects as input. But according to the code, that's not the case. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the code? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does the same as running them in sequence. But the first program's output is not the input to the second. Maybe the two programs are part of a problem where the first's output is not the input to the second, but the user wants to chain them regardless. But the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", so they must be connected.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because the first program's output is two lines, but the second program expects n followed by n numbers. Unless the first program's output is structured such that the first line is n, and the second line has the numbers. But in the first program's code, the first line is ans (the maximum length), which may not be n. For example, if n is 5, the ans could be 3, so the first line would be 3, then the second line is the string. But the second program expects the first line to be n (the original n from the first program's input). So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does the same as the original sequence. But the original sequence's first program's output is not the input to the second. So perhaps the user wants to run the first program, then the second, each with their own input, but the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next. So the first's output must be the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be exactly what the second program expects as input. But according to the code, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program (atcoder_ABC111_C):\n\nIt reads n, then n integers. The code counts the occurrences of each number in even and odd positions, and overall. Then calculates some minimum based on the top counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output must be n followed by n numbers. But the first program's output is two lines: the first line is ans (the maximum length), the second line is the string. So unless the ans is n and the string is the list of numbers, but that's not the case. For example, if the first program's input is n=5, then the first program's output's first line is ans (could be 3), then the second line is the string. So the second program would read 3 as n, then expect 3 numbers, but the second line's string may not be 3 numbers. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the two Java programs cannot be chained as described. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the two Java programs are part of a different setup where their outputs and inputs are compatible. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"You are given a set of Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\nSo the first program's output is the input to the second. Therefore, the first program's output must be exactly what the second program expects as input. The second program expects as input: first an integer n, then n integers. So the first program's output must be two lines: first line is n, then the next line has n integers. But the first program's output is two lines: first line is ans (the maximum length), second line is the string. So unless the ans is n and the string is the list of numbers, but that's not the case. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's code, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java code's main function:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\n    int[] v = new int[100010];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        v[i] = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());\n    }\n    // ... rest of code\n}\n\nSo the second program reads n followed by n numbers. So the first program's output must be exactly that. The first program's output is two lines: first line is ans (integer), second line is the string. So the first line must be n, and the second line must have n numbers. But the first program's ans is not necessarily n. For example, if the first program's input is n=5, then ans could be 3, so the first line would be 3, then the second line is the string. But the second program would then read 3 as n, and expect 3 numbers. But the second line's string may not be 3 numbers. So this is conflicting.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the two programs cannot be chained as described. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the two programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does the same as the original sequence, but without the I/O in between. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both steps. But the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next, so they must be connected.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a mistake in the problem's code, but proceed to translate each program into Fortran and then combine them, even if their outputs and inputs don't align. But that would not satisfy the problem's requirement. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is not the same as the first's output. So perhaps the second program's input is the first's output, but the second program's code is different. Wait, perhaps the second program's code is different from what's provided. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is for atcoder problem ABC111_C. The problem might require that the input is n followed by n numbers, which is what the code reads. So the first program's output must be that. But the first program's output is two lines: the first is ans (the maximum length), the second is the string. So unless the first program's ans is n and the string is the list of numbers, but that's not the case. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's input. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's code. Maybe the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does both steps. But the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next, so they must be connected. Therefore, I must proceed under the assumption that there's a mistake in the problem's code, but I have to proceed as best as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is not the same as the first's output. Maybe the second program's input is the first's output's second line (the string) parsed as numbers. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is two lines: first line is ans (integer), second line is the string. The second program expects n followed by n numbers. So perhaps the second line's string is the list of numbers, and the first line's ans is n. So the first program's ans must be equal to the number of elements in the string's list. For example, if the first program's ans is 3, then the second line's string has 3 numbers. Then the second program would read n=3, then the three numbers. That would work. So perhaps the first program's ans is the n for the second program, and the string is the list of numbers. So the first program's output is structured as:\n\nans (the new n for the second program)\nthe string (which is the list of numbers separated by spaces)\n\nIn that case, the second program would read the first line as n, then read the next line's numbers as the v array. So that would work. So the first program's output is the second's input. So the first program's ans is the new n, and the string is the list of numbers. So the first program's code must produce that.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is:\n\nSystem.out.println(ans);\n\nSystem.out.println(ss);\n\nThe string ss is built by appending indices in reverse. For example, if the path is 1 -> 3 -> 5, then the string would be \"5 3 1\" (since it's reversed). The ans is the length of the path (3 in this case). So the first line is 3, the second line is \"5 3 1\". So the second program would read n=3, then the three numbers 5,3,1. Then the second program would process those numbers. That makes sense. So the first program's output is exactly what the second program expects as input. So the two programs can be chained. Great, that's the key.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is the second's input. The first program's ans is the new n, and the string is the list of numbers. So the second program will read that n and the numbers. So the Fortran program must first process the first part, then the second part using the first's output as input.\n\nNow, the task is to translate both Java programs into a single Fortran program. The first part (Java codeforces_350_B) must read input, process, and store the ans and the string. The second part (Java atcoder_ABC111_C) must take ans as n and the string as the list of numbers, process them, and output the final result. The entire Fortran program must do this without I/O in between.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n, a array, b array).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to compute ans and the string ss.\n\n3. Use ans as the new n for the second program, and the string's numbers as the v array.\n\n4. Process the second program's logic with this new n and v array.\n\n5. Output the final result from the second program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran.\n\nThe first part (Java codeforces_350_B):\n\n- Read n, then n elements for a (1-based), then n elements for b (1-based).\n\n- Initialize num array (size n+1) to count occurrences of b[i].\n\n- Then process to find the longest path starting from a[i] =1, following b pointers, and build the string.\n\n- The ans is the maximum length, and the string is the reversed path.\n\nThe second part (Java atcoder_ABC111_C):\n\n- The new n is ans from first part.\n\n- The v array is the list of numbers in the string from first part.\n\n- Then process counts for even/odd positions and compute the answer.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but sometimes 0-based. Need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part.\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared. Let's start with the first part.\n\nFirst, read n, then a array (size n+1, indices 1 to n), then b array (same). Wait, in Java, the arrays are 1-based, size n+1, but indices 1 to n are used. So in Fortran, perhaps declare a(0:n) and b(0:n), but only use 1 to n. Or maybe 1-based arrays of size n.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nint a[] = new int[n + 1]; // indices 1..n are used, 0 unused.\n\nSame for b and num.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps declare a(1:n), b(1:n), and num(1:n). Since the 0 index is unused.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loops are from 1 to n for a and b. So in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based with size n.\n\nSo first, variables:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, num\n\nBut in Fortran, we can declare them with allocatable arrays.\n\nBut first, read n, then allocate arrays.\n\nBut in the first part, the code reads n, then reads n integers for a, then n integers for b.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n), num(n+1)) ?\n\nWait, in Java, the num array is size n+1, but in the code, it's indexed from 1 to n (since b[i] can be up to n). So in Fortran, perhaps num(1:n) is sufficient. Wait, in the Java code, the loop for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) num[b[i]]++; So b[i] can be from 1 to n? Or maybe 0? Wait, in the Java code, the b array is initialized with scanner.nextInt(), so the input can have 0? The problem statement for codeforces_350_B might allow b[i] to be 0? Let me check the code.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code has a loop for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) b[i] = scanner.nextInt();\n\nThen in the processing, there's a condition x !=0. So b[i] can be 0. So the num array in Java is size n+1, but the indices for num are from 1 to n, but if b[i] can be 0, then the num array's indices must go up to n, but 0 is also possible. Wait, in Java, the array is declared as int num[] = new int[n+1]; so indices 0 to n. So in the code, when b[i] is 0, then num[0] is incremented. So in Fortran, the num array must be from 0 to n. So in Fortran, perhaps declare num(0:n).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n), num(0:n))\n\nThen read the a array:\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\nThen read the b array:\n\nread(*,*) (b(i), i=1,n)\n\nThen initialize num to zero:\n\nnum = 0\n\nThen loop over b to count:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   num(b(i)) = num(b(i)) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen proceed to find the longest path.\n\nThe next part is the loop over a[i] ==1.\n\nIn Java, they have a boolean array st of size n+1. In Fortran, a logical array st(1:n).\n\nInitialize st to .false.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n:\n\nif a(i) ==1 then:\n\n   st(i) = .true.\n\n   build the string.\n\nThe string is built by following the b pointers until certain conditions.\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder, appending the current index, then reversing.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays or using concatenation. Since the string is built by appending indices in reverse, perhaps we can track the path in an array and then reverse it.\n\nAlternatively, since the path is built by following the pointers, we can store the indices in a list, then reverse it.\n\nLet me think of the algorithm:\n\nFor each i where a(i) is 1:\n\n   start at x = b(i)\n\n   collect the indices in a list until the stopping condition.\n\n   the path starts with i, then x, then b(x), etc., until the conditions are met.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe code starts with i, then x = b[i], and appends the reversed string of i, then x, etc.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n\nint x = b[i];\n\nStringBuilder sss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(i);\n\nsb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n\nWait, the first step is to append the reversed i? Wait, the code appends \" \" + sss.reverse(). So sss is \"i\", reversed is still \"i\". So the first part is \" i\".\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(x);\n\nsb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n\nSo each step appends \" x\" (since reversing a single digit does nothing).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to reverse the digits of the number? But that's not the case here. Wait, the code uses sss.append(i), then appends sss.reverse(). So for example, if i is 123, then sss is \"123\", reversed is \"321\". But in the problem's context, the indices are numbers, so perhaps the code is reversing the digits of the index? That would be odd. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the code, but perhaps the code is intended to reverse the order of the indices. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code starts with the current i, then appends the reversed string of i (which is the same as the number), then in the loop, appends the reversed string of x (same as x). So the sb is building a string like \" i x next ...\", but each part is reversed. Wait, but the code then does sb.reverse() at the end. So the final string is the reverse of the accumulated parts.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code:\n\nsss.append(i) \u2192 \"i\"\n\nthen sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()) \u2192 appends \" \" followed by the reversed string of i. Since i is a number, like 5, the reversed is still \"5\". So the first part is \" 5\".\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder();\n\nsss.append(x) \u2192 \"x\"\n\nthen sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()) \u2192 appends \" x\".\n\nSo after the loop, the sb has \" i x next ...\".\n\nThen, when the loop ends, the code does sb.reverse(). So the entire string is reversed, so the order becomes the reverse of the collected indices.\n\nWait, let's see an example:\n\nSuppose the path is i \u2192 x \u2192 y \u2192 z.\n\nThe code appends \" i\", then \" x\", then \" y\", then \" z\".\n\nThe sb is \" i x y z\".\n\nThen, reversing this gives \" z y x i\".\n\nSo the final string is the path in reverse order, but each element is written as a space followed by the number. So the reversed string would be \" z y x i\".\n\nWait, but the initial code starts with \" \" + sss.reverse(). So the first element is \" i\", then \" x\", etc. So the entire string is \" i x y z\", then reversed becomes \" z y x i\".\n\nSo the final string is the path in reverse order, but each element is separated by spaces. So the actual path is i \u2192 x \u2192 y \u2192 z, but the string is \" z y x i\".\n\nWait, but the code then does:\n\nss = sb.reverse().toString();\n\nWait, no, the code appends each part as \" \" + reversed, but the reversed is the same as the number. So the sb is \" i x y z\", then reversed becomes \" z y x i\".\n\nSo the string is the path in reverse order, but each element is the number. So the path is stored in reverse order, but the ans is the length of the path (s).\n\nSo the code is trying to collect the path in the order of traversal, but the string is stored in reverse, so that when reversed again, it becomes the correct order? Wait, perhaps the code is building the string in reverse order, so that when reversed, it becomes the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is building the string in the order of the path, but each element is added in reverse, so the final reverse gives the correct order.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is intended to collect the indices in the order of the path, but the string is built in reverse. Let me think:\n\nThe code starts with the current i (the starting point). Then, the next element is x = b[i], then x = b[x], etc. So the path is i \u2192 x \u2192 next \u2192 ... until stopping.\n\nThe code appends each step's current x (starting with i) as a string, then appends them with spaces. The sb is built as \" i x next ...\", then reversed to get \" ... next x i\".\n\nWait, but the code's first step is to append the reversed of the current index. Since the index is a number, reversing the digits would change it, but perhaps the code is intended to reverse the order of the elements. Wait, perhaps the code is using the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements, but that's not how it's done here. Alternatively, maybe the code is a mistake, but the actual intention is to collect the indices in the path and then reverse them to get the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is building the string in reverse order so that when reversed, it becomes the correct path. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the path is i \u2192 x \u2192 y \u2192 z.\n\nThe code appends \" i\", then \" x\", then \" y\", then \" z\".\n\nThe sb is \" i x y z\".\n\nThen, reversing the entire string gives \" z y x i\".\n\nSo the string is the path in reverse order. But the code then stores this reversed string as ss. So when printed, it would show the path in reverse order. But the problem requires the path to be in the correct order? Or perhaps the problem expects the path in the order of traversal, but the code is building it in reverse.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement for codeforces_350_B (since it's problem B from codeforces 350), perhaps the problem requires the path to be printed in the order of traversal. But according to the code, the string is reversed, so the output is the reversed path. That might be a mistake in the code, but I have to translate it as is.\n\nIn any case, the code's logic is to collect the path in the order of traversal, but the string is stored as the reversed path. So the final string is the path in reverse order. The ans is the length of the path.\n\nSo in Fortran, to replicate this, I need to track the path indices in an array, then reverse them to form the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps track the path in a list, then reverse it.\n\nLet me think of the steps in Fortran:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ninteger :: n, ans =0\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: ss = ''\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: st\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: path\n\nallocate(st(1:n))\n\nallocate(path(n)) ! maximum possible path length is n.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n:\n\n   if a(i) ==1 and not st(i):\n\n      start a new path.\n\n      initialize s =1, current x = b(i)\n\n      path(1) = i\n\n      st(i) = .true.\n\n      then loop:\n\n         while (not st(x) and num(x) ==1 and x /=0 and a(x) /=1):\n\n             s = s +1\n\n             path(s) = x\n\n             st(x) = .true.\n\n             x = b(x)\n\n         end loop\n\n      then, if s > ans:\n\n          ans = s\n\n          build the string as the reversed path.\n\n          the path array has elements path(1), path(2), ..., path(s)\n\n          the string is the elements in reverse order, space-separated.\n\n          so the string is path(s), path(s-1), ..., path(1)\n\n          so we can build the string by concatenating each element in reverse order.\n\n      end if\n\nWait, but the code in Java uses a loop that continues until the conditions are met. Let me re-examine the Java code's loop:\n\nThe loop is:\n\nwhile (!st[x] && num[x] ==1 && x !=0 && a[x] !=1) {\n\n    sss = new StringBuilder();\n\n    sss.append(x);\n\n    sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n\n    st[x] = true;\n\n    x = b[x];\n\n    s++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop continues as long as the conditions are true. So the loop adds x to the path, then moves to b[x], etc.\n\nWait, the initial x is b[i], and the loop starts with x. So the first step is to check if x meets the conditions. If yes, then add it to the path, mark st[x], and proceed.\n\nWait, the code's loop is inside the for loop over i. Let me retrace:\n\nThe code for the path:\n\nfor (int i =1; i<=n; i++) {\n\n   if (a[i] ==1) {\n\n      st[i] = true\n\n      x = b[i]\n\n      then, the loop:\n\n      while ( !st[x] && num[x]==1 && x !=0 && a[x] !=1 ) {\n\n          ... add x to the path, etc.\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop starts with x = b[i], and then enters the loop. The loop's condition is whether to continue adding x to the path.\n\nWait, the loop's condition is:\n\n!st[x] (so x hasn't been visited yet)\n\nnum[x] ==1 (so there's only one occurrence of x in b array?)\n\nWait, the num array counts the number of times each element appears in b. So if num[x] is 1, that means x is only pointed to by one element in b. So the loop continues as long as x hasn't been visited, has only one occurrence, is not 0, and a[x] is not 1.\n\nWait, the a[x] !=1 condition is important. Because if a[x] is 1, then it's a starting point, but we are following the path from the initial i, so we don't want to go into another starting point.\n\nSo the loop adds x to the path as long as those conditions are met.\n\nThus, the path starts at i, then x = b[i], then x = b[x], etc., until the conditions are no longer met.\n\nThe path length is s, which starts at 1 (the initial i), then increments each time the loop adds a new x.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the path can be stored in an array, and the loop can be implemented with a do-while loop or a while loop.\n\nNow, the string is built by reversing the path's elements. So the first element is the last in the path.\n\nThus, in Fortran, after collecting the path array (path(1) to path(s)), the string is the elements in reverse order, separated by spaces.\n\nSo the string would be:\n\nss = ''\n\ndo k = s, 1, -1\n\n   write(temp, '(i0)') path(k)\n\n   ss = trim(ss) // ' ' // trim(temp)\n\nend do\n\nBut leading space? The first element would have a leading space. So perhaps trim the leading space.\n\nAlternatively, start with the first element, then append the rest with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, build an array of strings and then join them.\n\nBut in Fortran, string handling can be tricky. Perhaps using a character array to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and concatenate.\n\nNow, after processing all i's, the ans and ss are determined.\n\nThen, the second part of the program (the second Java code) must take ans as n and the numbers in the string as the v array.\n\nThe second part's logic is:\n\nRead n (which is ans from first part), then n numbers (the elements in the string, split by spaces).\n\nThen, count occurrences in even and odd positions, and compute the answer.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the first part, we have:\n\ninteger :: new_n = ans\n\ninteger, dimension(new_n) :: v\n\nWe need to parse the string ss into the v array.\n\nThe string ss is a space-separated list of integers. So we can split the string into tokens and store them in v.\n\nIn Fortran, splitting a string can be done with a read statement using list-directed input.\n\nFor example:\n\nread(ss, *) v(1:new_n)\n\nBut the string may have leading or trailing spaces. So need to ensure that the string is properly formatted.\n\nIn the first part's code, the string is built with spaces between each number, so the read should work.\n\nThus, after the first part, we can do:\n\nread(ss, *) v(1:new_n)\n\nThen proceed with the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nThe second Java code counts occurrences in even and odd indices (0-based in Java?), but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based.\n\nWait, in the second Java code:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (i%2 ==0) \u2192 even index (0-based), so even positions are 0,2,4 etc.\n\n   else \u2192 odd indices (1,3,5 etc.)\n\nThus, in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, the even indices would be 1,3,5 (i mod 2 ==1?), or need to adjust.\n\nWait, in the Java code, i starts at 0 (0-based), so i%2==0 \u2192 even indices (0,2,4...).\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to n:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then \u2192 even (0-based equivalent)\n\n      \u2192 even position (original Java's even indices)\n\n   else \u2192 odd.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nve and vo arrays (for even and odd counts) can be declared as arrays of size max possible value (like 100010 as in Java), but in Fortran, perhaps using a large enough size.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem's constraints may not be known, but in the Java code, they used 100010, which is a large number. In Fortran, we can use a large array, say up to 1e5.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays are better. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_val = 100010\n\ninteger, dimension(0:max_val) :: ve, vo, vt\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with lower bounds.\n\nAlternatively, use 0:max_val.\n\nInitialize them to zero.\n\nThen loop over the v array:\n\ndo i =1, new_n\n\n   val = v(i)\n\n   vt(val) = vt(val) +1\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then \u2192 even position (Java's even indices)\n\n      ve(val) = ve(val) +1\n\n   else\n\n      vo(val) = vo(val) +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, sort the arrays in descending order. But in Fortran, sorting arrays can be done with the merge sort or using the sort intrinsic.\n\nWait, in the Java code, they sort the arrays vo, ve, vt in reverse order (descending).\n\nBut in the Java code, the vo, ve, vt arrays are of type Integer, so they can be sorted with Collections.reverseOrder().\n\nIn Fortran, to sort the arrays in descending order, we can use the sort function with a custom comparator, but Fortran's intrinsic sort is ascending. So we can sort and then reverse.\n\nAlternatively, for each array, we can find the top two elements.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nAfter counting, they sort the arrays in reverse order (descending), then take the first and second elements.\n\nThe key is to get the top two counts for each array.\n\nThus, perhaps instead of sorting the entire array, we can find the maximum and second maximum values.\n\nThis would be more efficient and avoid the need for sorting large arrays.\n\nIn the Java code, after sorting, vo[0] is the maximum count in vo, vo[1] is the second maximum, etc.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can find the top two elements in each array.\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor the ve array (counts for even positions):\n\nmax_ve = maxloc(ve, 1)\n\nsecond_max_ve = find the second maximum.\n\nSimilarly for vo and vt.\n\nBut this requires some code.\n\nAlternatively, since the arrays are large, but the values in v are up to some maximum (like 1e5?), but in practice, the counts may be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, to find the top two elements:\n\nFor ve:\n\nmax_val = 0\n\nsecond_max_val =0\n\nmax_index =0\n\nsecond_max_index =0\n\ndo i =0, max_val\n\n   if (ve(i) > max_val) then\n\n      second_max_val = max_val\n\n      second_max_index = max_index\n\n      max_val = ve(i)\n\n      max_index =i\n\n   else if (ve(i) > second_max_val) then\n\n      second_max_val = ve(i)\n\n      second_max_index =i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for vo and vt.\n\nThis would be more efficient than sorting.\n\nThus, the code can be optimized this way.\n\nOnce we have the top two counts for each array, we can compute the answer.\n\nThe Java code's logic:\n\nif (vo[0] + ve[0] == vt[0]) \u2192 the sum of the top counts of vo and ve equals the top count of vt.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum between (n - vo[0] - ve[1], n - vo[1] - ve[0])\n\nElse, the answer is n - vo[0] - ve[0]\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nif ( (vo_max + ve_max) == vt_max ) then\n\n   ans2 = min( new_n - vo_max - ve_second, new_n - vo_second - ve_max )\n\nelse\n\n   ans2 = new_n - vo_max - ve_max\n\nend if\n\nThen, output ans2.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program will:\n\n1.

Let me check.\n\nFirst, in the loops for finding the top two elements, variables like ve_max_index are not declared. Since we only need the counts, not the indices, perhaps we can ignore the indices and just track the counts.\n\nWait, in the code above, when finding the top two counts for ve, vo, and vt, we only need the maximum and second maximum counts, not the actual values (indices). Because the problem's condition is based on the counts, not the values.\n\nThus, the code can be simplified by only tracking the counts, not the indices.\n\nSo modifying the loops:\n\nFor ve:\n\nve_max =0\n\nve_second =0\n\ndo val =0, max_val\n\n   if (ve(val) > ve_max) then\n\n      ve_second = ve_max\n\n      ve_max = ve(val)\n\n   else if (ve(val) > ve_second) then\n\n      ve_second = ve(val)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for vo and vt.\n\nThis way, we don't need to track the indices, just the counts.\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted.\n\nAlso, in the first part's string building:\n\nThe code appends each path(k) as a string, then trims the leading space.\n\nThe loop:\n\nss = ''\n\ndo k = s, 1, -1\n\n   write(temp, '(i0)') path(k)\n\n   ss = trim(ss) // ' ' // trim(adjustl(temp))\n\nend do\n\nBut temp is an integer variable, but in Fortran, we need to declare it as a character variable to hold the string.\n\nWait, in the code above, temp is declared as an integer, but that's incorrect. The write statement should write to a character variable.\n\nSo, need to declare temp as a character variable.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nwrite(temp, '(i0)') path(k)\n\nss = trim(ss) // ' ' // trim(adjustl(temp))\n\nBut the first element will have a leading space. So after the loop, we need to remove the leading space.\n\nThus, after the loop:\n\nif (len_trim(ss) >0) then\n\n   ss = ss(2:)\n\nend if\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loops:\n\nFor ve_max and ve_second:\n\nve_max =0\n\nve_second =0\n\ndo val =0, max_val\n\n   if (ve(val) > ve_max) then\n\n      ve_second = ve_max\n\n      ve_max = ve(val)\n\n   else if (ve(val) > ve_second) then\n\n      ve_second = ve(val)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSame for vo and vt.\n\nThus, the code can be written as such.\n\nNow, putting it all together with proper variable declarations.\n\nAlso, the max_val is set to 100000 (as in Java's 100010), but in Fortran, arrays can be declared with that size.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array indices start at 0, so:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:max_val) :: ve, vo, vt\n\nwhere max_val is 100000.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, ans, new_n, i, x, s, current_val, ve_max, ve_second, vo_max, vo_second, vt_max, vt_second, temp_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, num, path, v\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: st\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: ss\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_val = 100000\n\n!
