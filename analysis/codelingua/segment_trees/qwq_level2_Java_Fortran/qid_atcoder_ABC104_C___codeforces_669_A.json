So min is 1. Then the second part: n=1 \u2192 (0)*2 +1 \u21921. So output is 1. Another test case: D=2, p(1)=2, c(1)=0; p(2)=3, c(2)=0. G= 200 + 300 =500? Not sure, but let's see.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC104_C. It reads input values D and G, then arrays p and c. It uses a brute-force approach with bitmasking to find the minimum number of questions needed to reach at least G points. The output is the minimum solve_num.\n\nThe second Java file, codeforces_669_A, takes an integer n and calculates some value based on dividing by 3, then outputs that result. But since the first program's output is the input for the second, I need to make sure that the first program's output is passed as input to the second's logic in the Fortran code.\n\nWait, but the user said the entire sequence should be translated into a single Fortran program. So the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java file) will compute a value, then that value is used as the input to the second part (equivalent to the second Java file's logic), and finally, the result of the second part is printed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (D, G, p, c arrays).\n2. Compute the minimum solve_num as in the first Java program.\n3. Use that solve_num as the 'n' in the second Java program's solve function.\n4. Compute the result from the second part and print it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first process the first part, then pass its result to the second part's calculation without any I/O in between.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran. Let's see:\n\nThe first Java program uses bitmasking over all possible subsets of the D problems. For each subset (bitmask), it calculates the total score and the number of questions solved. If the score is less than G, it tries to add the maximum possible questions from the remaining problems (starting from the last) to reach G. The minimum solve_num is tracked.\n\nIn Fortran, loops and bitwise operations can be done. The main challenge is handling the bitmask loop (from 0 to 2^D -1). Since D can be up to, say, the problem's constraints (probably small, since it's a programming competition problem), this should be manageable.\n\nThe variables in the first part:\n\n- D: integer input\n- G: integer (but in Java it's a long, but in Fortran, maybe integer*8 or just integer if G is within 32-bit)\nWait, in the Java code, G is a long. So in Fortran, perhaps using integer(8) to handle large values.\n\nThe arrays p and c are of size D, each element is an integer.\n\nThe INF is 100000, which is the initial value for min.\n\nThe main loop is over all bits from 0 to 2^D -1. For each bit, compute the score and solve_num.\n\nThen, if the score is less than G, loop through the bits again to see which ones are not selected and add as many as possible from those problems to reach G.\n\nHmm, the inner loop in the Java code for the 'loop' label: for each i from D-1 down to 0, if the bit isn't set, then add up to p[i]-1 questions (since the first p[i] questions are already considered in the bitmask? Wait, no. Wait, in the first part of the code, when the bit is set, all p[i] questions are included. But if the bit is not set, then in the second part, they can add some of them. Wait, the code in the first part's first loop adds all p[i] questions when the bit is set. Then, in the case where the total score is less than G, they loop through the unset bits and try to add as many as possible from those problems (but not all, since the problem might have a different scoring when not fully completed? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, in the first part, when the bit is set, the code adds 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]. That's probably the total for completing all p[i] questions in that set. Then, in the case where the total is insufficient, they loop through the unset bits (i.e., the problems not selected in the bitmask) and try to add some of their questions. The code adds 100*(i+1) for each question added (but not all p[i], since the loop is from 0 to p[i]-2 (since p[i]-1 is the upper limit for j). Wait, the loop is for j from 0 to p[i]-1-1? Because the code says for (int j = 0; j < p[i] - 1; j++). So that's p[i]-1 iterations. So adding (p[i]-1) questions from that problem. Because adding all p[i] would have been covered in the initial bitmask selection. So the code is trying to add up to p[i]-1 questions from the problem not selected in the bitmask, to reach the required G.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the same logic must be implemented.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read D and G, then the p and c arrays.\n\nThen, loop over all possible bits (bitmask) from 0 to 2^D -1. For each bitmask:\n\nInitialize score and solve_num to 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to D-1:\n\nif the bit is set (bit AND (1 << i) is non-zero), then add 100*(i+1)*p(i) + c(i) to score, and add p(i) to solve_num.\n\nThen, if the total score is less than G, we need to try adding some questions from the unset problems.\n\nThe code then loops from i = D-1 down to 0. For each i not set in the bitmask, we can add up to p[i]-1 questions (since adding all would have been part of the initial selection). So for each such i, we can add as many as possible (starting from the last problem, which gives higher points per question, so it's optimal to take the higher ones first to minimize the number of questions needed).\n\nWait, the code in Java does exactly that: starting from the last problem (i from D-1 down to 0), and for each unset problem, it adds as many as possible (up to p[i]-1) until the score reaches G.\n\nWait, the code in the Java's inner loop for the 'loop' label:\n\nfor (int i = D-1; i >=0; i--):\n\nif (bit not set for i):\n\nthen, for j from 0 to p[i]-2 (since j < p[i]-1):\n\neach iteration adds 100*(i+1) to the score, and increments solve_num.\n\nBut this is done until the score reaches G. So the loop breaks once the score is >= G.\n\nWait, the code is adding (p[i]-1) questions? Because the loop runs p[i]-1 times (since j starts at 0 and goes up to p[i]-2). So each time, adding 100*(i+1) per question. So total added for that problem is (p[i]-1)*100*(i+1). But why not all p[i]?\n\nAh, because if you take all p[i], then that problem would have been part of the initial selection (the bitmask). So in the case where the problem is not selected in the bitmask, you can take up to (p[i]-1) questions from it, but not all. Because taking all would require including it in the bitmask. So the code is considering the possibility of taking some but not all of the questions from the problem not in the bitmask.\n\nWait, but the problem's scoring might be different. For example, in some programming contest problems, the first p[i] questions give 100*(i+1) each, and then the bonus c[i] is added if all are solved. But in the code, when the bitmask includes the problem, the total is 100*(i+1)*p[i] + c[i]. So when not included, you can take up to p[i]-1 questions, each worth 100*(i+1), but without the bonus. So the code is handling that correctly.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the same logic must be followed.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the bitmask can be represented as an integer. Since D is up to, say, 10 (since 2^10 is 1024, manageable), but the problem's constraints for D in the first problem (ABC104 C) might be up to 9 or 10. Let me check the problem statement for ABC104 C. Well, since the code uses 1<<D, which in Java can handle up to D=30, but in Fortran, integers can be 32-bit, so D up to 30 is okay. But the problem's constraints probably have D up to 10 or so. Anyway, the code can handle it as long as 2^D is manageable.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the loop over all bits can be done with a do loop from 0 to 2**D -1. But in Fortran, exponentiation is with **, so 2**D.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be of kind 4 or 8. So for D up to 30, 2^30 is about a billion, which is manageable as an integer*4 (since 2^31 is about 2e9, so 2^30 is under that). So for D up to 30, the loop variable can be an integer*4.\n\nNow, the arrays p and c are of size D. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, they are 0-based. So need to adjust indices. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, for i from 0 to D-1, p[i] and c[i] are accessed. So in Fortran, perhaps we can make the arrays 1-based, so p(1) to p(D) correspond to the Java's 0-based indices. So when translating, the loop in Fortran would be from 1 to D, and the problem number is (i) in Fortran corresponds to (i-1) in Java. Wait, no, perhaps better to keep the same indices. Alternatively, adjust the code accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's use 1-based arrays. So for the first problem's code:\n\nIn Java, for each i from 0 to D-1:\n\np[i] is the number of questions in problem (i+1). So in Fortran, perhaps the first element (i=1) corresponds to the first problem (Java's i=0). So when calculating the score, for problem i in Fortran (1-based), the points would be 100 * i * p(i) + c(i). Because in Java, it was (i+1) since i started at 0.\n\nWait, in Java's code, the problem number is (i+1) because the loop is from 0 to D-1. So in Fortran, if we use 1-based, then the problem number is i, so 100 * i * p(i) + c(i).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead D and G.\n\nThen read D lines, each with p(i) and c(i) for i from 1 to D.\n\nThen, initialize min to a large value (INF = 100000).\n\nThen loop over all bits from 0 to 2**D -1.\n\nFor each bit:\n\nscore = 0\n\nsolve_num = 0\n\nloop over i from 1 to D:\n\nif (bit has the (i-1)th bit set?) Wait, because in Java, the bitmask is for 0-based indices. So in Fortran, for the ith problem (1-based), the corresponding bit is the (i-1)th bit in the bitmask.\n\nWait, the Java code uses (bit & (1 << i)) !=0 for the ith problem (0-based). So in Fortran, for the ith problem (1-based), the bit is (bit_value) AND (1 << (i-1)).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each i from 1 to D:\n\nif (btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\nthen add the contribution.\n\nSo the loop over the bits:\n\ndo bit = 0, 2**D -1\n\nthen for each i in 1 to D:\n\nif btest(bit, i-1) then\n\nscore = score + 100 * i * p(i) + c(i)\n\nsolve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\nend if\n\nthen check if score < G:\n\nif (score < G) then\n\nwe need to try adding some questions from the unset problems.\n\nThe code in Java loops from D-1 down to 0 (i.e., from last problem to first). In Fortran, that would be from D down to 1.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1\n\nif (not btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\nthen, for this problem, we can add up to p(i)-1 questions.\n\nWait, the Java code does:\n\nfor (int j =0; j < p[i] -1; j++)\n\nso adding p[i]-1 questions. Each adds 100*(i+1) (Java's i is 0-based, so in Fortran's i, it's 100*i).\n\nWait, in Java, the problem's number is (i+1), so in Fortran's i, the problem number is i, so the points per question are 100*i.\n\nSo for each such question added, the score increases by 100*i, and solve_num increases by 1.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop runs p[i]-1 times (since j < p[i]-1). So the maximum added is (p[i]-1) questions.\n\nBut the code breaks early if the score reaches G.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the inner loop is:\n\nfor (int j =0; j < p[i] -1; j++) {\n\nscore += 100*(i+1);\n\nsolve_num++;\n\nif (score >= G) break loop;\n\n}\n\nSo each iteration adds one question. The loop runs up to p[i]-1 times (since j goes from 0 to p[i]-2, so p[i]-1 iterations). But it can break early.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each such problem (i not set in the bitmask), we can add up to (p(i)-1) questions, but stop when the score reaches G.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1\n\nif (.not. btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\nmax_add = p(i) -1\n\ndo j = 1, max_add\n\nscore = score + 100 * i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit the loops (the inner loop and the i loop?)\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses a labeled loop 'loop', and breaks out of it when the score is sufficient. So in Fortran, perhaps after adding each question, we check if the score is >= G, and if so, break out of the i loop and the j loop.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, to break out of multiple loops, you can use a goto, but that's not ideal. Alternatively, use flags.\n\nAlternatively, in the inner loop over j:\n\ndo j = 1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit the j loop and the i loop.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe:\n\ndo j = 1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit j_loop\n\nend if\n\nend do j_loop\n\nthen after the j loop, check if score >= G, and if so, break the i loop.\n\nAlternatively, after adding each question, check and break.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can use a flag variable.\n\nAlternatively, since the code in Java breaks the outer loop (the i loop) when the score is sufficient, perhaps in Fortran, after adding each question, once the score is sufficient, we can exit both loops.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to use a flag.\n\nInside the i loop:\n\nflag = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nflag = .true.\n\nexit\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nif (flag) then\n\nexit i loop\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exiting the i loop can be done with an exit statement, but the loop is over i. So perhaps:\n\ndo i = D, 1, -1\n\nif (not btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\ndo j = 1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit i_loop\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend if\n\nend do i_loop\n\nWait, but the i loop is the outer loop. So if we have an exit i_loop, then the i loop will exit, and the code proceeds.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can label loops and exit to them. So:\n\ni_loop: do i = D, 1, -1\n\nif (not btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\ndo j = 1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100*i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit i_loop\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend if\n\nend do i_loop\n\nThis way, once the score reaches G, the i loop is exited, and the rest of the i's are skipped.\n\nThis should replicate the Java's behavior of breaking out of the outer loop once the score is sufficient.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nOnce the score is adjusted, then check if the total score is >= G. If so, update the min.\n\nSo after all that, if score >= G, then min = min(min, solve_num).\n\nOnce all bits are processed, the first part's result is min.\n\nThen, the second part's code takes this min as n, and computes (n /3)*2 + (1 if n mod 3 !=0 else 0).\n\nWait, the second Java code's solve function is:\n\npublic static void solve(int n) {\n\n    System.out.println( (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ? 0 :1) );\n\n}\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n divided by 3:\n\nThe quotient is n//3, and remainder is n%3.\n\nThe formula is (n//3)*2 plus 1 if there's a remainder (since 1 or 2 gives a remainder, so adding 1).\n\nWait, let's test with examples:\n\nn=1: 0*2 +1 \u21921\n\nn=2: 0*2 +1 \u21921\n\nn=3: 1*2 +0 \u21922\n\nn=4: 1*2 +1 \u21923\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part is straightforward: compute the value as (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3) /=0).\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so n/3 is integer division.\n\nSo the result is (n/3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0).\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read D and G.\n\n2. Read D pairs of p and c.\n\n3. Compute the min solve_num as per the first Java program.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result using the min as n.\n\n5. Print that result.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to declare variables for D, G, p array, c array, min, and the loop variables.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. Let's assume D can be up to, say, 10 (since the first problem's constraints may be small). But to be safe, perhaps use a parameter, but since in the code, D is read from input, we can use an allocatable array or a fixed size. Since in programming competition, often the maximum D is small, let's use a fixed size, say 10.\n\nWait, but in the first problem (ABC104 C), the problem's constraints for D are up to 10 (I recall that problem's constraints were D \u2264 10). So let's set the array size to 10.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxD = 10\n\ninteger :: D, G, p(maxD), c(maxD), min_val, i, bit, score, solve_num, temp_score, temp_solve, j, n\n\nBut G is a long in Java, so in Fortran, perhaps use integer(8) for G and score.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, G is a long, which can be up to 1e18, but in Fortran, integer(8) can handle that.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: G, score\n\ninteger :: D, p(maxD), c(maxD), min_val, i, bit, solve_num, j, n\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead D and G:\n\nread*, D, G\n\nThen read D lines of p and c:\n\ndo i =1, D\n\nread*, p(i), c(i)\n\nend do\n\nInitialize min_val to a large value (INF = 100000):\n\nmin_val = 100000\n\nThen loop over all bits from 0 to 2**D -1:\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\nscore =0\n\nsolve_num =0\n\ndo i =1, D\n\nif (btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\nscore = score + 100 * i * p(i) + c(i)\n\nsolve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nif (score < G) then\n\n! Need to add some questions from unset problems\n\ni_loop: do i = D, 1, -1\n\nif (.not. btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\ndo j =1, p(i)-1\n\nscore = score + 100 *i\n\nsolve_num = solve_num +1\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nexit i_loop\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nend if\n\nend do i_loop\n\nend if\n\n! After processing, check if score >= G\n\nif (score >= G) then\n\nif (solve_num < min_val) then\n\nmin_val = solve_num\n\nend if\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code above, after the i_loop, the score and solve_num may have been updated. So after that, we check if the score is sufficient and update min_val.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the inner loops, the code checks if score >= G and then updates min.\n\nYes, so the code above does that.\n\nBut in the code above, after the i loop, the code proceeds to check if score >= G.\n\nNow, after all bits are processed, min_val holds the minimum solve_num.\n\nThen, compute the second part's result:\n\nn = min_val\n\nresult = (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3) /=0 )\n\nprint*, result\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the merge function can be used here. Alternatively, compute it directly:\n\nif (mod(n,3) ==0) then\n\n    add =0\n\nelse\n\n    add=1\n\nend if\n\nresult = (n/3)*2 + add\n\nAlternatively, using an expression:\n\nresult = (n/3)*2 + (1 - (mod(n,3) ==0))\n\nWait, but in Fortran, logical expressions in arithmetic context are .true. = -1, .false. =0. So perhaps better to use an if statement.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nadd = 1\n\nif (mod(n,3) ==0) add =0\n\nresult = (n/3)*2 + add\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxD =10\n\ninteger :: D, p(maxD), c(maxD), min_val, bit, i, j, n, solve_num\n\ninteger(8) :: G, score\n\n!

Loop over all bits\n\ndo bit =0, 2**D -1\n\n    score =0\n\n    solve_num =0\n\n    ! Compute initial score and solve_num for the bitmask\n\n    do i =1, D\n\n        if (btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\n            score = score + 100 * i * p(i) + c(i)\n\n            solve_num = solve_num + p(i)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! If score is less than G, try adding questions from unset problems\n\n    if (score < G) then\n\n        i_loop: do i = D,1, -1\n\n            if (.not. btest(bit, i-1)) then\n\n                do j =1, p(i)-1\n\n                    score = score + 100 *i\n\n                    solve_num = solve_num +1\n\n                    if (score >= G) then\n\n                        exit i_loop\n\n                    end if\n\n                end do\n\n            end if\n\n        end do i_loop\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Check if this is a valid solution\n\n    if (score >= G) then\n\n        if (solve_num < min_val) then\n\n            min_val = solve_num\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now compute the second part's result\n\nn = min_val\n\nif (mod(n,3) ==0) then\n\n    add =0\n\nelse\n\n    add =1\n\nend if\n\nprint*, (n/3)*2 + add\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, 'add' is not declared. Need to declare it as an integer.\n\nAdding 'integer :: add' in the variable declarations.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: D, p(maxD), c(maxD), min_val, bit, i, j, n, solve_num, add\n\ninteger(8) :: G, score\n\nNow, that should work.\n\nWait, but in the inner loop over j, when adding questions, the code may add up to p(i)-1 questions. But what if adding all p(i)-1 questions is not enough? Then it proceeds to the next i.\n\nWait, the code in Java's inner loop for the 'loop' label: it tries all unset problems in reverse order, and for each, adds as many as possible (up to p[i]-1) until the score reaches G. So the code in Fortran does the same.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the case where even after adding all possible questions from all unset problems, the score is still less than G, then this bitmask is not considered. So the code correctly skips it.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nSuppose D=1, p(1)=1, c(1)=0, G=100.\n\nThe first part's min would be 1 (since the only problem gives 100*1*1 +0 =100, which meets G=100. So min is 1.\n\nThen the second part: n=1 \u2192 (0)*2 +1 \u21921. So output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: D=2, p(1)=2, c(1)=0; p(2)=3, c(2)=0. G= 200 + 300 =500? Not sure, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think of a simple case.\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program should be as above, with variables properly declared and loops correctly structured.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, the loop over bits is from 0 to 2**D -1. Since D can be up to 10, 2^10 is 1024, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code should be written with proper syntax.\n\nWait, in the inner loop over j, the loop is from 1 to p(i)-1. But if p(i) is 0, that would be an error. But in the problem's input, p[i] is the number of questions, so it must be at least 1. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible issue: when p(i) is 1, then p(i)-1 is 0, so the j loop doesn't run. Which is correct, because if the problem is not selected in the bitmask, you can't add any questions (since p[i]-1=0, so no questions can be added from it).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
