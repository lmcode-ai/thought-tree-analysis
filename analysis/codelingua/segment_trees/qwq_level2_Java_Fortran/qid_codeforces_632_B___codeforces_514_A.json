    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_632_B) reads an integer n, then an array of n integers, and a string s. It calculates some sum based on the 'B's in the string, then does some more calculations with 'A's and 'B's to find the maximum value. The output is the maximum value.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_514_A) takes a long integer, processes each digit, and constructs a new number by possibly replacing each digit with 9 - digit if that's smaller, except for the last digit if it's zero. Then it outputs the new number.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as input to the second's logic, and output the final result.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the first Java program into Fortran. Let's see:\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\n1. Read n, then array a of size n, then string s.\n2. Compute sum as sum of a[i] where s has 'B' at position i.\n3. Then compute sum1 starting from sum, and for each character in s:\n   - if 'A', add a[i] to sum1\n   - else subtract a[i]\n   - track the maximum ans.\n4. Then reset sum1 to sum and do the same but backwards, from the end of s to start.\n5. Finally, output the maximum ans.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first loop for the forward pass starts at i=0, and the backward loop starts at s.length()-1 down to 0. The array a is of size n, but the string s's length must be equal to n? Because in the first loop, the for loop is over i from 0 to s.length()-1, but the array a is of size n. So in the Java code, the input must have the array a of length n, and the string s of length n? Because otherwise, the indices would go out of bounds. So the problem's input must have the string s of length n. So in Fortran, I need to read n, then n integers, then a string of length n.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, reading input is done via read(*,*) for numbers, but for strings, we can read into a character array. Let's see:\n\nThe first part (first Java program):\n\nRead n, then the array a (size n), then the string s (length n).\n\nThen compute sum as sum of a(i) where s(i) is 'B'.\n\nThen compute the forward pass and backward pass to find the maximum ans.\n\nThen, the second program takes this ans as input, processes it, and outputs the result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first compute the first part's result (ans), then pass that to the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second Java program's logic:\n\nIt takes a long x (the ans from first part), then processes each digit. For each digit, if 9 - digit is less than digit, replace it with 9 - digit, except when it's the last digit and 9 - digit is zero (so leave as digit). Then, collect the digits in a list, then reverse them (since we process from least to most significant digit) and form the new number.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first loop is:\n\nx starts as the input, then while x>0, we take r = x mod 10 (the last digit), then decide whether to take r or 9 - r. Then x is divided by 10. So the digits are processed from least to most significant. The list is built in reverse order (since we start with the last digit first). Then when building newNumber, the list is traversed from first to last, which corresponds to the digits from least to most, so the first element is the least significant digit, so when multiplied by 10^0, then next by 10^1, etc. So the list is stored in the order of the digits from least to most, so when building the number, it's correct.\n\nIn Fortran, I can do this by first taking the ans from the first part as the input x. Then process each digit similarly.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n, then the array a (size n), then the string s (length n).\n\n2. Compute the first part's ans as per the first Java code.\n\n3. Then take that ans as the input to the second part's processing.\n\n4. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nFor the first part:\n\n- n: integer.\n\n- a: array of integers, size n.\n\n- s: character array of length n.\n\nsum, sum1, ans: integers (or maybe long in Java, but in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Since the problem may have large numbers, perhaps use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18) for 64-bit integers. But in Fortran, the default might be sufficient, but better to use kind=8 for safety.)\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the sum can be up to n elements each up to, say, 1e9 (if the input allows), so sum could be up to 1e9 * 1e5 (if n is 1e5), which is 1e14, so 64-bit integer needed. So in Fortran, use integer(8).\n\nSimilarly, the second part's x is a long, so same.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, a(n), sum, sum1, ans, temp, ... ?\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with a size known at compile time. Hmm, but n is read from input. So we need to read n first, then allocate the array a. So we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate a(n).\n\nRead the n integers into a.\n\nRead the string s (length n).\n\nThen compute the first part's ans.\n\nThen, take that ans as x for the second part.\n\nNow, the first part's code:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, compute the forward pass:\n\nans = sum\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n      ans = sum1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, wait, in the Java code, the first loop for the forward pass is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i];\n\n    else sum1 -= a[i];\n\n    ans = Math.max(ans, sum1);\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the 'B' case subtracts a[i] from sum1? Wait, no, the code in the first part's first loop (the sum) is adding a[i] when 'B', but in the forward loop, the code is:\n\nsum1 starts as sum (which is the sum of B's). Then, for each character in s (from 0 to length-1):\n\nif the character is 'A', add a[i] to sum1, else subtract a[i].\n\nWait, so for 'B', it subtracts a[i], but the original sum was adding a[i] for B's. So the initial sum is the sum of B's. Then, in the forward pass, for each character:\n\nif it's 'A', add a[i], else subtract a[i]. So for 'B', subtract a[i], which would subtract the a[i] that was added in the initial sum. So the net effect for 'B' is that the initial sum had it, but now subtracting it, so the total would be sum - a[i]. Hmm, perhaps that's correct as per the problem's logic.\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program's first loop (sum) is:\n\nfor each character in s, if it's 'B', add a[i] to sum. So sum is the sum of a[i] where s[i] is 'B'.\n\nThen, in the first forward loop (the first for loop after sum is computed):\n\nsum1 is initialized to sum. Then, for each i from 0 to s.length-1:\n\nif s[i] is 'A', add a[i] to sum1.\n\nelse (so 'B'), subtract a[i].\n\nWait, so for 'B', it subtracts a[i], which was part of the original sum. So the net effect is that the 'B's are subtracted again, so the total would be sum - a[i] for each B. That seems odd, but perhaps that's what the problem requires.\n\nSo in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the loop would be from 1 to n (since s is length n). So in the first loop (sum):\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      sum = sum + a(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the forward pass:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nans = sum\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n      ans = sum1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen the backward pass:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\nans = max(ans, sum1)  (though sum1 is sum initially, so maybe redundant)\n\nthen loop from i = n down to 1:\n\ndo i = n, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) then\n\n      ans = sum1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the backward loop starts at s.length()-1 (since it's 0-based). So in Fortran, starting at n down to 1.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part's code.\n\nThe second part takes the ans (from first part) as x, then processes each digit.\n\nThe steps in Java:\n\nInitialize a list. Then while x>0:\n\nr = x mod 10 (the last digit)\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 (i.e., it's the first digit being processed, which is the original last digit) and 9 - r ==0, then add r (so don't change it). Else, add 9 - r.\n\nElse add r.\n\nThen x = x /10.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then decide to take 9 - r, but with an exception when x/10 is 0 (i.e., it's the last digit of the original number) and 9 - r is 0. In that case, we add r instead of 9 - r (which would be 0, but since it's the last digit, we can't have leading zeros? Or perhaps the problem requires that the minimal number of digit changes, but the code's logic is such that when the last digit is 9, you can't subtract 9 (since 9-9=0, but that would be better? Wait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) then add r, else add 9 - r.\n\nWait, when x/10 is 0, that means that the current digit is the first digit being processed (since x was divided by 10 each time). So the original x's last digit is being processed first. So when x is, say, 9, then x/10 is 0, and r is 9. 9 - r is 0, so the condition is met (9 - r ==0 and x/10 is 0). So in that case, we add r (9) instead of 0. So the digit remains 9, not changing to 0. So the code avoids leading zeros? Because if the original number was 9, then the minimal sum would be 9 (since 9 is better than 0, but 0 is not allowed as a single digit? Or perhaps the problem requires that the number can't have leading zeros, so the first digit (the original last digit) can't be zero. So in that case, when the digit is 9, you can't replace it with 0, so you leave it as 9.\n\nSo in code, for each digit except the first (original last digit), you can choose between r and 9 - r whichever is smaller. But for the first digit (original last digit), if 9 - r is zero, then you can't choose it, so you have to take r.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nTake x = ans (from first part).\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold the digits.\n\ndigits array, say, an array of integers, and count the number of digits.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array of integers, say, digits(1:20) (since the maximum possible x is up to 1e18, so 18 digits).\n\nInitialize a counter, say, cnt =0.\n\nThen loop while x >0:\n\nr = mod(x,10)\n\nx = x /10\n\nthen check if (9 - r < r):\n\n   if yes:\n\n      if (x ==0 .and. (9 - r) ==0) then\n\n          digit = r\n\n      else:\n\n          digit = 9 - r\n\n   else:\n\n      digit = r\n\n   append digit to the digits array, increment cnt.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the digits are added in the order of least to most significant, so when building the number, the first element is the least significant digit.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the list is built by adding the digits in the order of the last digit first (since x is divided by 10 each time). So the first element in the list is the original last digit, then the next is the penultimate, etc. So when building the new number, the first element is the least significant digit (since when you multiply by 10^0, then next by 10^1, etc.), so the list is stored in the order of the digits from least to most. So the digits array in Fortran would be stored similarly.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the list is built as follows:\n\nfor x = original number:\n\n   r = x mod 10 (last digit)\n\n   process r, add to list.\n\n   x = x /10 (so next digit is next to the left)\n\nSo the list is [d0, d1, ..., dk], where d0 is the original last digit, d1 is the next, etc. So when building the new number, the first element (d0) is the least significant digit (10^0), so the list is in the correct order.\n\nIn Fortran, we can collect the digits in an array, say digits(1:cnt), where digits(1) is d0, digits(2) is d1, etc. Then when building the number, newNumber is sum_{i=1 to cnt} digits(i)*10^{i-1}.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInitialize newNumber =0, pow=0 (but in Fortran, perhaps track the power as we go).\n\nBut let's see:\n\ndigits array:\n\ninteger, dimension(20) :: digits\n\ninteger :: cnt =0\n\nx = ans\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n   r = mod(x,10)\n\n   x = x /10\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n      if (x ==0 .and. (9 - r) ==0) then\n\n          digit = r\n\n      else\n\n          digit = 9 - r\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   cnt = cnt +1\n\n   digits(cnt) = digit\n\nend do\n\nThen, compute newNumber:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ndo i =1, cnt\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + digits(i) * 10**(i-1)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but 10^(i-1) can be computed as 10**(i-1). However, in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. But for large exponents, this might be an issue, but since the maximum cnt is 18, 10^17 is manageable as an integer*8.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be 64-bit, so 10^17 is about 1e17, which is less than 2^60, so okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, the digits are stored in the order of least to most, so the first digit (digits(1)) is the least significant (10^0), so the loop is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the digits are stored in the order of processing, which is the same as the Java code. So digits(1) is the first digit processed (the original last digit), so yes, correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the loop is:\n\nwhile x>0:\n\n   r = mod(x,10) \u2192 last digit of current x.\n\n   x = x/10 \u2192 next digit.\n\n   process r \u2192 digit is stored in digits array.\n\nSo the first iteration gives the original last digit, stored as digits(1), then next iteration gives the penultimate digit, stored as digits(2), etc. So when building the number, digits(1) is the least significant digit, so the code is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read n, then the array a (size n), then the string s (length n).\n\n2. Compute the first part's ans.\n\n3. Use ans as x for the second part's processing.\n\n4. Output the newNumber.\n\nNow, handling the string in Fortran:\n\nIn Fortran, to read a string of length n, we can use a character array of length n.\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s\n\nBut since n is read first, we need to read n, then allocate the string. However, in Fortran, character variables can be declared with a length parameter known at compile time. To handle variable length, we can read the string as a character array with sufficient length, but since n is known, perhaps:\n\nRead n, then read the array a, then read the string s (length n).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading a string, it stops at whitespace. So the input for the first program's s is a single token (since in Java it's sc.next(), which reads the next token). So in Fortran, to read the entire string (without spaces), we can read it as a character array of length n.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next n integers into array a (size n).\n\nRead the next string (exactly n characters) into s.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading a string of exactly n characters can be done with read(*, '(a)') s, but need to ensure that the string is exactly n characters. Alternatively, read the entire line and then take the first n characters, but perhaps better to read as a character array of length n.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nAfter reading n, allocate a as an array of size n.\n\nThen read the next line for the array a.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading the array can be done with read(*,*) a, but since it's an array, the input must have the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nThen, read the string s as a character array of length n.\n\nSo code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, cnt, digit, r, pow\n\n   integer(8) :: sum, sum1, ans, x, newNumber\n\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\n   !

No, in the code above, the digits array is declared inside the second part's code. Wait, in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So in the code above, after the first part, we need to declare the digits array.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote, after the first part, the variables for the second part are declared inline.

Reading the string s: The read statement uses '(a)', which reads the entire line as a string. But if the input has leading or trailing spaces, it might read more than n characters. However, the problem's input for the first program's s is a single token (since in Java it's sc.next()), so the input line for s should be exactly n characters. So using adjustl(s) to remove leading spaces, but perhaps the problem ensures that the input is correct. Alternatively, we can take the first n characters of s.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when reading with '(a)', the entire line is read, including any leading/trailing spaces. So if the input line for s has leading spaces, then s would have those, and the first n characters may include spaces. To avoid that, perhaps read the string as a(n) characters, but since the length is variable, perhaps better to read into a sufficiently large character array and then take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\ns = s(1:n)\n\nBut in Fortran, if the string is shorter than n, this would cause an error. But according to the problem's input, the string s has exactly n characters, so this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a(n) characters, but in Fortran, the length must be known at compile time. Since n is read first, perhaps the best way is to read into a character array of length n.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nallocate a character array of length n:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s\n\nBut then, after reading n, we can allocate s. But in Fortran, allocatable character variables can be allocated with a length.\n\nWait, the variable s is declared as allocatable, so:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: s )\n\nThen read the string into s.\n\nBut the read statement would need to read exactly n characters. So perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nBut if the input line for s is exactly n characters, then it's okay. Otherwise, it may have issues. But assuming the input is correct, this should work.\n\nAlternatively, read the string as a(n) characters, but in Fortran, the read statement can be:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\ns = s(1:n)\n\nBut this may truncate or pad with spaces. Hmm, perhaps better to read the string as a(n) characters, but in Fortran, the read statement can be:\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nthen s is allocated to the length of the input, but then we can take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be adjusted to read the string properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input ensures that the string s is exactly n characters, so the code can proceed as written.\n\nAnother possible issue is the digits array. The digits array is of size 20, which is sufficient for numbers up to 1e18 (18 digits). So that's okay.\n\nAnother point: in the second part's loop, when x is divided by 10, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so that's okay.\n\nTesting the code with sample inputs would help, but since I can't run it now, I'll proceed.\n\nAnother thing: in the second part's code, the newNumber is an integer(8), but in the code above, it's declared as integer(8). The digits array is integer, but the digits are 0-9, so that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ndigits is declared as integer, dimension(20). The digits are stored as integers (0-9), so that's okay.\n\nThe newNumber is computed as sum of digits(i)*10^(i-1). Since 10^(i-1) is an integer, and digits(i) is integer, the product is integer, and adding to newNumber (integer(8)) is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's backward loop, the indices go from n down to 1. The code uses:\n\ndo i =n, 1, -1\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n   else\n\n      sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
