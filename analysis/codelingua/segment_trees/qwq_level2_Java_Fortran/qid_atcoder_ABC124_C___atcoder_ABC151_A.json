    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C). It reads a string input, then processes it in two different ways to count the number of changes needed. The first loop goes forward, changing characters if they are the same as the previous. The second loop goes backward, doing a similar check. Then it outputs the minimum of the two counts.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes a string, reads the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but the code here is incomplete? Because the code in the second file's main method just takes the first character and adds 1. But the problem might be different. Wait, the user provided two Java files, but the second one's code seems to be part of a problem where you have to output the first character incremented by 1. But maybe the actual problem requires more steps? Wait, the user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, so the output of the first is the input of the second. So the first program's output is a number (the min of a1 and a2), and that is the input to the second program, which then takes that number as a string, takes the first character (the digit), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, like \"5\", so the second program would take \"5\" as input, take the first character '5' (ASCII 53), add 1 to get 54 which is '6', so output '6'.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC151_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in), 1);\n        String s;\n        String sl[];\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line, takes the first character of that line, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. So if the first program outputs \"3\", then the second program would take \"3\" as input, take the first character '3' (ASCII 51), add 1 to get 52 which is '$', but wait, 51+1 is 52? Wait no, 51 is '3', adding 1 gives 52 which is '$'? Wait, no, 51 is '3', 52 is '4'? Wait, no, ASCII for '0' is 48, so '3' is 51, adding 1 gives 52 which is '4'? Wait yes, because 48 is '0', so 51 is '3', 52 is '4', so the output would be '4'.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. So the entire sequence is: input a string to first program, it outputs a number, then that number is the input to the second program, which outputs the first character of that number plus 1.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (the string for the first program), process both steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result of the second step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input string (from the user) for the first program.\n\n2. Process the first program's logic: compute the minimal count between a1 and a2.\n\n3. Take that number, convert it to a string (since the second program's input is the output of the first), then process the second program's logic: take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, the first part: processing the first Java program's logic.\n\nLet me think about the first Java program's algorithm again.\n\nThe first program takes a string x. Then creates two copies, a and b.\n\nFor a, it goes from left to right (i from 1 to length-1). For each position i, if the current character is same as previous, it flips it (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1), and increments a1.\n\nFor b, it goes from right to left (i from length-1 down to 1). For each position i-1, if the current and previous are same, it flips the previous (so changing the left one), and increments a2.\n\nThen output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nWait, in the second loop for b, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i - 1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i - 1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i - 1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo here, when moving backward, they check if current and previous are same, then flip the previous (i-1) character. So the direction is different.\n\nSo the first part's processing is to compute a1 and a2 as the counts for the two different methods of flipping.\n\nNow, the second program takes the output of the first (the min of a1 and a2) as a string, then takes the first character of that string, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the input string (the initial x for the first program).\n\nProcess the first program's logic to get the minimal count.\n\nConvert that count to a string (so, for example, if the count is 5, the string is \"5\").\n\nTake the first character of that string (the first character is '5'), add 1 to its ASCII value (so 53 becomes 54, which is '6'), then output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are handled as ASCII codes. So the steps would be:\n\nAfter computing the minimal count (let's call it min_count), we need to convert it to a string. Then take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that character.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (the initial x).\n\n2. Compute a1 and a2 as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n3. Compute min_count = min(a1, a2).\n\n4. Convert min_count to a string (e.g., using write statement into a character variable).\n\n5. Take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that as a character.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe input is a string x. Let's read it as a character array.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nSuppose the input string is stored in a character array, say, x(:).\n\nThen, for the first processing (a):\n\nWe need to create a copy of x, then process it from left to right.\n\nSimilarly for the second processing (b), another copy, processed from right to left.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays. Let's see.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nWe can read the input as a character string. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut need to make sure the length is sufficient. Alternatively, use a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with a length parameter. Let's assume the input is up to, say, 1e5 characters? But for the problem, perhaps the input is a string of 0s and 1s. Let's see the first Java problem's problem statement (though not given here, but the code is given). The first program's code is for problem C of ABC124, which is \"Coloring Colorfully\". The problem likely requires processing a string of 0s and 1s, and the code's logic is as described.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the steps for the first part:\n\nInitialize a1 and a2 to 0.\n\nFirst, process the forward pass (a):\n\nMake a copy of the input string. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: a_str = input_str\n\ninteger :: a1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   if (a_str(i:i) == a_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a_str(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a_str(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a_str(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. So the indices start at 1. So for a_str, the first character is a_str(1), etc.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you assign a_str = input_str, then a_str will have the same length as input_str, but with trailing spaces? Or maybe better to use len_trim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character array with a fixed length, but that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, use a character array of sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to read the input as a string, then process each character.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is a single line, so using:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: x\n\nread(*,'(A)') x\n\nThen, the actual length is len_trim(x).\n\nThen, for the a processing:\n\nWe can make copies of the string. Let's see:\n\nFirst, for a:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: a_str = x\n\ninteger :: a1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(x)\n\n   if (a_str(i) == a_str(i-1)) then\n\n       if (a_str(i) == '1') then\n\n           a_str(i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a_str(i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the b processing:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: b_str = x\n\ninteger :: a2 = 0\n\ndo i = len_trim(x)-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (b_str(i) == b_str(i+1)) then\n\n       if (b_str(i) == '1') then\n\n           b_str(i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b_str(i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, in the second loop (for b), the original Java code loops from i = x.length()-1 down to 1 (since i starts at x.length-1 and goes down to 1, but in Java indices start at 0). Wait, in the Java code for the second loop:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i - 1)) {\n\n        ... flip the i-1 character.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is over i from the end down to 1 (since i starts at x.length-1 (the last index) and goes down to 1 (since i>0). So for each i, they check if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, they flip the previous (i-1) character.\n\nWait, in the Java code for the second loop, the code is:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)), then flip the (i-1)th character.\n\nWait, so in the loop, for each i from the end down to 1 (since i starts at x.length-1 and goes down to 1), the code checks if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, it changes the previous (i-1) character.\n\nWait, so in Fortran terms, the loop for the second part (b) would be:\n\nWe need to loop from i = len_trim(x) down to 2 (since in Java, the loop is i from x.length-1 (which is the last index, since Java uses 0-based) down to 1 (so in Fortran, which is 1-based, the equivalent would be from N downto 2, where N is the length).\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nJava's x.length() is the length of the string. The indices in Java are 0-based. So the last character is at index x.length()-1.\n\nThe loop for the second part (b) in Java is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--)\n\nSo i starts at (length-1), then goes down to 1 (since when i becomes 0, the loop stops).\n\nIn each iteration, they check if b's i-th character equals the (i-1)th character. If so, they flip the (i-1)th character.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\nfor i from N downto 2 (since in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the last index is N = len_trim(x). So the loop would be from N downto 2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the length is N. Then in Java, the loop runs i from N-1 (Java's last index) down to 1 (Java's index 1). So in Fortran, the equivalent indices would be from N down to 2 (since Fortran's index 2 corresponds to Java's 1).\n\nSo in the Fortran loop for the second part (b):\n\ndo i = len_trim(x), 2, -1\n\n   if (b_str(i) == b_str(i-1)) then\n\n       if (b_str(i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b_str(i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b_str(i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, that's correct. Because for each i from N down to 2, we check if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, flip the previous (i-1) character and increment a2.\n\nSo that's the correct translation.\n\nOnce a1 and a2 are computed, the minimal is min(a1, a2).\n\nThen, the second part of the sequence is to take that minimal value, convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing min_count = min(a1, a2), we need to convert min_count to a string.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can use an internal write statement:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: min_str\n\nwrite(min_str, '(I0)') min_count\n\nThen, the first character is min_str(1:1). But we have to make sure that the string is properly formatted. For example, if min_count is 0, then the string is \"0\", so first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nWait, but what if the number is, say, 10? Then the string is \"10\", so the first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nTake the first character of min_str, which is the first digit of the number. Then, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that as a character.\n\nIn Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: first_char_ascii\n\nfirst_char_ascii = ichar(min_str(1:1)) + 1\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: result_char\n\nresult_char = char(first_char_ascii)\n\nThen, print that character.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n\n2. Process the first part (compute a1 and a2).\n\n3. Compute min_count.\n\n4. Convert min_count to a string.\n\n5. Take first character, add 1, output.\n\nNow, handling the string length for min_str. Since min_count can be up to, say, the length of the input string (since each step in the first program can flip at most n-1 times, so for a string of length n, the maximum a1 or a2 is n-1). So for n up to, say, 1e5, the number can be up to 1e5, which is 5 digits. So a length of 20 is sufficient.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=1000) :: x, a_str, b_str, min_str\n    integer :: a1, a2, min_count, i, first_char_ascii\n    character(len=1) :: result_char\n\n    !

Process first part (a)\n    a_str = x\n    a1 = 0\n    do i = 2, len_trim(x)\n        if (a_str(i:i) == a_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (a_str(i:i) == '1') then\n                a_str(i:i) = '0'\n            else\n                a_str(i:i) = '1'\n            end if\n            a1 = a1 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Process second part (b)\n    b_str = x\n    a2 = 0\n    do i = len_trim(x), 2, -1\n        if (b_str(i:i) == b_str(i-1:i-1)) then\n            if (b_str(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n                b_str(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n            else\n                b_str(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n            end if\n            a2 = a2 + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute min_count\n    min_count = min(a1, a2)\n\n    ! Convert to string\n    write(min_str, '(I0)') min_count\n\n    ! Process second program's logic\n    first_char_ascii = ichar(min_str(1:1)) + 1\n    result_char = char(first_char_ascii)\n\n    ! Output\n    print *, result_char\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second loop for b_str, the code checks if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, it flips the previous (i-1) character. So in the code above, the loop is correct.\n\nWait, in the code for the second part (b_str):\n\nThe loop is from i = len_trim(x) down to 2.\n\nFor each i, check if b_str(i) == b_str(i-1). If so, flip the (i-1)th character.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose input is \"0001\".\n\nFirst part:\n\nProcessing a_str (forward):\n\nStart with \"0001\".\n\ni=2: compare 0 and 0 \u2192 same. Flip the second 0 to 1 \u2192 a_str becomes \"0101\", a1 +=1 (now 1).\n\ni=3: compare 1 and 0 \u2192 different. No change.\n\ni=4: compare 0 and 1 \u2192 different. So a1 is 1.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nWait, original string is \"0001\".\n\nProcessing a_str:\n\nInitially a_str is \"0001\".\n\ni=2 (second character):\n\na_str(2) is '0', previous is '0' \u2192 same. So flip to '1', so now a_str is \"0101\", a1=1.\n\ni=3: current is '0', previous is '1' \u2192 different. No change.\n\ni=4: current is '1', previous is '0' \u2192 different. So a1 remains 1.\n\nSo a1 is 1.\n\nProcessing b_str (backward):\n\nStart with \"0001\".\n\nLoop from i=4 down to 2.\n\ni=4: check b_str(4) and b_str(3). The original string is \"0001\".\n\nAt i=4, b_str(4) is '1', b_str(3) is '0' \u2192 different. No change.\n\ni=3: check b_str(3) and 2. The third character is '0', second is '0' \u2192 same. So flip the second character (i-1=2) from '0' to '1'. Now the string becomes \"0101\", a2 +=1 (now 1).\n\ni=2: check b_str(2) (now '1') and b_str(1) (0). They are different. So no change.\n\nSo a2 is 1. So min is 1.\n\nThen the second program takes \"1\" as input, first character is '1' (ASCII 49), add 1 \u2192 50 \u2192 '2', so output '2'.\n\nWait, but according to the code above, the output would be '2'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"0\".\n\nThen the first program's a1 and a2 would be 0 (since no changes needed). So min is 0. The second program takes \"0\" \u2192 first character '0' \u2192 add 1 \u2192 '1'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"01\".\n\nFirst program:\n\na processing: no changes (since 0 and 1 are different). a1=0.\n\nb processing: same. So a2=0. min is 0 \u2192 output '1'.\n\nAnother test case: input \"00\".\n\nProcessing a_str:\n\ni=2: same as previous. Flip to '1', a1=1.\n\nProcessing b_str:\n\ni=2: check 0 and 0 \u2192 same. Flip the first character (i-1=1) to '1', so the string becomes \"10\", a2=1.\n\nmin is 1 \u2192 output '2'.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, in the code, the variables a_str and b_str are declared with the same length as x (1000). But in Fortran, when you assign a_str = x, the trailing spaces are also copied. However, since we are using len_trim(x) in the loops, that's okay. Because the loops only process up to the trimmed length.\n\nWait, but in the code, when we do a_str = x, then a_str will have the same length as x, but if x is shorter than 1000, the rest are spaces. But in the loops, we loop up to len_trim(x), so the spaces beyond that are not processed. So that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting min_count to a string, using write(min_str, '(I0)'). The I0 format writes the integer without leading spaces, so that's correct. The first character is the first digit.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Fortran, with all the steps in one program, reading input once, and outputting the final result.\n\nI think that's the correct approach."
