Wait, 5 and 5: sum is 5+5=10. So same. So the minimal is 10. Alternatively, A=10 and 0? But A can't be more than N/2 (since n is 5 for N=10 even). So the loop runs up to 5.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_665_A) reads input from the user. It takes three lines of input: the first line has a and tA, the second has b and tB, and the third is a timing string like \"HH:MM\". It calculates the simulation's departure time in minutes, adds tA to get arrival time. Then it loops through bus departures starting at 300 minutes (5 AM) every b minutes until 1440 (midnight). For each bus, it checks if the bus's departure is before the simulation's arrival and if the simulation's departure is before the bus's arrival. If so, that's a counter increment. Finally, it outputs the counter.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, computes the minimal sum of the digits of A and (N-A) for A up to N/2 or (N+1)/2. It starts with the initial sum of 1 and N-1, then iterates through possible A values to find the minimum.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must read the input for the first part, process it, then use the result as N for the second part, and output the final result of the second part.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input (a, tA; b, tB; timing string).\n2. Process the first part to compute the counter (the first program's output).\n3. Use that counter as N for the second part's calculation.\n4. Output the result of the second part.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part's logic in Fortran.\n\nParsing the input:\n\nThe first line has two integers. The second line also two. The third line is a string like \"HH:MM\".\n\nIn Fortran, I can read lines using read(*,*) but for the third line, since it's a string with a colon, maybe read as a character string, then parse the time.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read the third line, perhaps read it as a string, then split into hours and minutes.\n\nFor example:\n\nRead the first line: a and tA.\n\nRead the second line: b and tB.\n\nRead the third line as a string, say timing_str. Then extract the hours and minutes.\n\nThe timing_str is like \"HH:MM\", so split at the colon. The first two characters are hours, next three (including colon?) Wait, the example in Java uses substring(0,2) for hours and substring(3) for minutes. So for \"12:34\", the first two are 12, then after the colon (position 3) is 34.\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading the string, we can take the first two characters as hours, then from position 4 to end as minutes.\n\nOnce we have hours and minutes, convert to total minutes: sim_departure = hours *60 + minutes.\n\nThen compute sim_arrival = sim_departure + tA.\n\nThen loop over bus departures starting at 300, step b, up to 1440 (since 1440 is 24*60, so the loop is i from 300 to 1440-1 (since step is b, but the condition is i < 1440? Wait the original Java code is for (int i = 300; i < 1440; i += b). So the loop runs while i is less than 1440. So in Fortran, the loop would be do i = 300, 1440 - 1, b. Wait, but in Fortran, the step is added until it's less than or equal to the upper limit. Hmm, need to make sure the loop is correct.\n\nFor each i (busDeparture), compute busArrival = i + tB.\n\nCheck if busDeparture >= simArrival OR simDeparture >= busArrival: if so, skip. Else, increment counter.\n\nWait, the condition in Java is:\n\nif (busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival) continue;\n\nSo if either of those is true, the bus and simulation don't overlap, so we don't count. So the counter is incremented only when the intervals overlap.\n\nSo the condition for counting is when busDeparture < simArrival AND simDeparture < busArrival.\n\nSo in code, if (busDeparture < simArrival .and. simDeparture < busArrival) then counter +=1.\n\nWait, let me think again. The simulation departs at simDeparture, arrives at simArrival. The bus departs at i, arrives at i + tB.\n\nThe two time intervals are [simDeparture, simArrival) and [busDeparture, busArrival). They overlap if:\n\nsimDeparture < busArrival and busDeparture < simArrival.\n\nYes, that's the standard interval overlap condition. So the condition to count is when that is true. So in the code, if not (busDeparture >= simArrival or simDeparture >= busArrival), then count.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ncounter = 0\n\ndo i = 300, 1439, b\n\n    busDeparture = i\n\n    busArrival = i + tB\n\n    if (busDeparture < simArrival .and. simDeparture < busArrival) then\n\n        counter = counter +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is i < 1440, so the last i is 1439 (since 1440 is excluded). So yes, the upper limit in Fortran is 1439.\n\nOnce the counter is computed, that's the N for the second part.\n\nNow the second part: compute the minimal digit sum.\n\nThe second Java program's main function takes N (the counter from first part) and computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A, where A ranges from 1 to n, where n is N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif (N % 2 ==0) n = N/2 else n = (N+1)/2.\n\nSo n is floor(N/2) when even, ceil when odd. So n is the integer division (N//2) when even, (N+1)/2 when odd. So in Fortran, n = N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nThen the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then loop A from 1 to n, compute sum(A) + sum(N-A), and track the minimum.\n\nThe sum function is the sum of digits of a number. So for a given number, sum its digits until it's less than 10.\n\nWait, the sum function in Java:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n    int ans =0;\n    while (a >=10) {\n        ans += a%10;\n        a = a/10;\n    }\n    ans +=a;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, that's not exactly sum of all digits. Let me see:\n\nSuppose a is 123. Then first iteration: a is 123 >=10: ans +=3, a becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: a is 12 >=10: ans +=2, a becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends, then add a (1) to ans. So total 3+2+1 =6. So yes, it's the sum of all digits.\n\nWait, the code adds a%10 each time, then divides a by 10. So for 123:\n\nLoop runs while a >=10:\n\nFirst step: a=123: ans +=3 (123 mod10 is 3), a becomes 12.\n\nSecond step: a=12: ans +=2 (12 mod10 is 2), a becomes 1.\n\nNow a is 1 <10, so loop stops. Then add a (1) to ans. So total 3+2+1=6. Correct.\n\nSo the function is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, I can write a function sum_digits(a) that does this.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n\nFirst line: read a and tA.\n\nSecond line: read b and tB.\n\nThird line: read the timing string, parse into hours and minutes.\n\nThen compute sim_departure and sim_arrival.\n\nCompute the counter as per first part.\n\nThen use that counter as N for the second part.\n\nCompute the minimal sum as per second part.\n\nFinally, print the minimal sum.\n\nNow, handling the input in Fortran.\n\nFirst, for the first two lines, straightforward:\n\nread(*,*) a, tA\n\nread(*,*) b, tB\n\nThird line: read a string. In Fortran, to read a string with a colon, perhaps using a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=8) :: timing_str\n\nread(*, '(A)') timing_str\n\nThen extract hours and minutes.\n\nThe timing_str is like \"HH:MM\".\n\nSo the first two characters are hours, then the next two (after colon) are minutes.\n\nWait, the timing_str is \"HH:MM\", so positions 1-2 are hours, 4-5 are minutes (since position 3 is the colon).\n\nWait, for example, \"12:34\" is 6 characters. So the string length can be 6.\n\nWait, perhaps better to read into a string of length 5 (since \"HH:MM\" is 5 characters: two digits, colon, two digits).\n\nWait, let me see: \"00:00\" is 5 characters. So the third line can be read as a 5-character string.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=5) :: timing_str\n\nread(*, '(A5)') timing_str\n\nThen, extract hours and minutes:\n\nhours_str = timing_str(1:2)\n\nminutes_str = timing_str(4:5)\n\nBut in Fortran, converting strings to integers.\n\nWe can use internal reads or substring and conversion.\n\nAlternatively, read the first two characters as an integer for hours, and the last two as minutes.\n\nSo:\n\nread(timing_str(1:2), '(I2)') hours\n\nread(timing_str(4:5), '(I2)') minutes\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if the string is like \"09:30\", then timing_str(4:5) is \"30\".\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThen sim_departure = hours *60 + minutes\n\nsim_arrival = sim_departure + tA\n\nThen loop over i from 300 to 1439 step b, compute busDeparture and busArrival, check overlap, count.\n\nOnce counter is found, that's N.\n\nThen compute the minimal sum.\n\nNow, the second part's logic.\n\nFirst, compute n:\n\nif mod(N,2) ==0 then n = N/2 else n = (N+1)/2\n\nThen initialize ans as sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\nif current_sum < ans, then ans = current_sum\n\nAt the end, print ans.\n\nNow, the sum_digits function.\n\nIn Fortran, a function can be written as:\n\ninteger function sum_digits(a)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a\n    integer :: ans, temp\n    ans = 0\n    temp = a\n    do while (temp >=10)\n        ans = ans + mod(temp,10)\n        temp = temp /10\n    end do\n    ans = ans + temp\n    sum_digits = ans\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran functions, the function name is the return variable. So perhaps better to write:\n\ninteger function sum_digits(a)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a\n    integer :: temp, digit_sum\n    temp = a\n    digit_sum = 0\n    do while (temp >=10)\n        digit_sum = digit_sum + mod(temp,10)\n        temp = temp /10\n    end do\n    digit_sum = digit_sum + temp\n    sum_digits = digit_sum\nend function\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different variable name.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a subroutine, but functions are okay here.\n\nNow putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\n    implicit none\n\n    ! Variables for first part\n    integer :: a, tA, b, tB\n    character(len=5) :: timing_str\n    integer :: hours, minutes, sim_departure, sim_arrival\n    integer :: i, counter, busDeparture, busArrival\n    integer :: N, n, ans, current_sum, A\n\n    !

So when N is 0, but that's impossible because the first part's counter can't be zero? Well, the code should handle N=0, but perhaps in the problem constraints, N is at least 1. But the code should still work.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the counter could be zero if no buses overlap. Then N=0, but in the second Java code, when N is zero, the code would have N=0, then n would be 0 (since 0/2 is 0). Then the loop A from 1 to 0 would not execute, so the initial ans would be sum(1) + sum(-1). But that's invalid. However, perhaps the problem constraints ensure that N is positive. But in code, perhaps need to handle N=0, but maybe the first program's output can't be zero? Not sure, but the code as written would have issues. However, given that the original Java code works, perhaps the problem's input ensures that N is valid.\n\nAssuming that the first program's output is a valid N for the second part.\n\nNow, checking the loop in the first part:\n\nThe loop is from 300 to 1439, stepping by b. So if b is zero, that would be a problem, but the problem's input probably ensures that b is positive. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing some edge cases.\n\nSuppose the timing is \"05:00\", so sim_departure is 5*60=300. sim_arrival is 300 + tA.\n\nSuppose tA is 0, then sim_arrival is 300. Then the first bus departure is 300. The busDeparture is 300, busArrival is 300 + tB.\n\nThe condition is busDeparture < sim_arrival (300 < 300? No) so not counted. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: if the bus departs at 300, and sim departs at 300, then the bus's arrival is 300 + tB. If tB is 1, then bus arrival is 301. The simulation's departure is 300, arrival is 300 + tA. Suppose tA is 0, then sim arrival is 300. So the bus departs at same time as sim departs. The condition is busDeparture (300) < sim_arrival (300) \u2192 no. So not counted. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: if the bus departs at 299 (but the loop starts at 300, so that's not included). So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the second part's function sum_digits must work for numbers like 0? Well, if N is 1, then N-1 is 0. sum_digits(0) would be 0, since the loop doesn't run (0 <10), so digit_sum is 0 +0 \u2192 0. So that's okay.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsum_digits(0):\n\ntemp =0, which is less than 10. So the loop doesn't run. digit_sum is 0 +0 \u2192 0. So yes.\n\nAnother example: N=2. Then n is 1. The initial ans is sum(1)+sum(1) =1+1=2. Then loop A=1: sum(1)+sum(1) \u2192 same as initial, so ans remains 2. So correct.\n\nAnother example: N=10. The minimal is 1+9 \u2192 sum(1)=1, sum(9)=9 \u2192 total 10. But maybe A=5 and 5: sum(5+5)=5+5=10. Or A=9 and 1: same. But perhaps there's a better split. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for N=10, the minimal sum is 1+9=10, but maybe another split gives lower?\n\nWait, 5 and 5: sum is 5+5=10. So same. So the minimal is 10.\n\nAlternatively, A=10 and 0? But A can't be more than N/2 (since n is 5 for N=10 even). So the loop runs up to 5. So the minimal is indeed 10.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The timing_str reading: if the input line is longer than 5 characters, but the problem's input should be exactly \"HH:MM\".\n\n- The loop in the first part: step b. If b is zero, but the problem's input ensures b is positive.\n\n- The sum_digits function for negative numbers? But since N is a counter (non-negative), and A is between 1 and n (so N-A is at least N-n, which for N even, n=N/2 \u2192 N-A is at least N/2, so non-negative. So all inputs to sum_digits are non-negative.\n\nThus, the code should work."
