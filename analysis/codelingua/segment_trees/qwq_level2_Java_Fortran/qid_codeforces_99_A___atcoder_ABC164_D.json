So:\n\ntmp = modulo( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif (i >0) then\n\n   tmp = modulo( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nradix = modulo( radix *10, 2019 ) After the loop, we need to increment mod_cnt(0) by 1.\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nThen compute the answer:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i =0, 2018\n\n   ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) -1) /2\n\nend do\n\nThen output ans.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_99_A.java) reads a string from input, which is a number with a decimal point. It checks the digit before the decimal. If it's '9', it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" Otherwise, it looks at the first digit after the decimal. If that digit is greater than 4, it increments the integer part (before the decimal) by 1. If not, it just outputs the integer part.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC164_D.java) takes a string S, processes it to count the number of pairs of substrings that form numbers divisible by 2019. The approach uses modular arithmetic and some array manipulations to compute this efficiently.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's input is read via stdin, and its output is passed to the second program's input.\n2. The second program's output is the final output of the combined program.\n3. Intermediate steps must not have I/O; all data must be passed in memory.\n\nSo, the Fortran program must first read the input (the first program's input), process it through both steps without I/O in between, then output the final result.\n\nLet me break down each step.\n\nStarting with the first Java program's logic:\n\n- Read a line from input, split into characters.\n- Find the position of the '.'.\n- Check the digit before the '.' (dotIndex-1). If it's '9', output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n- Else, check the first digit after '.' (dotIndex+1). If that digit >4, increment the integer part (before the decimal) by 1 and output.\n- Else, output the integer part (before the decimal).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the integer part is the part before the decimal. So, for example, if the input is \"123.45\", the integer part is \"123\". If the digit after decimal is 5 (greater than 4), then add 1 to 123 to get 124. If the digit is 3, then just output 123.\n\nBut in the code, when the digit after decimal is >4, they take the string before the decimal, parse it as an integer (using BigInteger to handle large numbers?), add 1, then output. So in Fortran, I need to handle that.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the input could be a very large number, so using BigInteger is necessary. However, in Fortran, handling very large integers might be an issue. But perhaps the input is such that the integer part can be stored as an integer. Alternatively, maybe the problem constraints allow it. Let me check the problem's context.\n\nWait, the first Java code is from Codeforces problem 99A. Looking that up, the problem is about rounding a number. The input is a number with exactly one decimal digit. Wait, actually, looking at the code, the code checks the first digit after the decimal. So the input is a number like \"123.4\" or \"9.9\", etc. So the part after the decimal is a single digit? Because in the code, they are looking at str[dotIndex+1], which is the first character after the decimal. So the input has exactly one decimal digit. So the input is something like \"123.4\", so the part after the decimal is a single digit. Therefore, the code is checking if that digit is greater than 4, then round up the integer part.\n\nTherefore, in the first step, the output is either \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" (if the digit before the decimal is 9), or the integer part plus 1 (if the decimal digit is >4), or the integer part (if decimal digit <=4).\n\nWait, but in the code, when the digit before the decimal is '9', it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" So that's a string output. The other cases output a number. So the first program's output is either a string or a number. Wait, but in the code, when the digit before the decimal is '9', it outputs that string. Otherwise, it outputs either the incremented integer part or the integer part.\n\nWait, but the second Java program expects a string input (since it reads S = sc.next();). So the first program's output must be a string that the second program can read as its input. So the first program's output is either \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" or a number (like \"123\" or \"124\"). The second program then reads that as its input S.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string S. So the first program's output must be a string that the second program can read as its input. So the first program's output is either \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" or a number (like \"123\" or \"124\"). The second program then reads that as S. But the second program's code is expecting a string S, which is the input. So the first program's output is the input to the second program.\n\nTherefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first step's output (the result of the first Java program) must be passed as the input to the second step's processing. So in Fortran, after processing the first step, we need to store the result (either the string \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" or the number string) and then pass that to the second step's processing.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is expecting to read a string S via sc.next(). So the first program's output must be a single string (either \"GOTO...\" or a number string) which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that string.\n\nTherefore, in the combined Fortran program, the first part must compute the first program's output (the string), then the second part processes that string as S, and outputs the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input line (the first program's input).\n2. Process it through the first Java's logic to get the intermediate string (either \"GOTO...\" or the number string).\n3. Then process that intermediate string through the second Java's logic to compute the final answer.\n4. Output the final answer.\n\nNow, translating each step into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (codeforces_99_A):\n\nThe input is a string (like \"123.4\"). We need to process it as follows:\n\n- Find the position of '.'.\n- Check the character before it (the digit before the decimal). If it's '9', output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\".\n- Else, check the first character after the '.' (the decimal digit). If that digit is >4, then take the part before the '.' as a number, add 1, and output as a string.\n- Else, output the part before the '.'.\n\nWait, but in the code, the part before the '.' is stored as a string, then converted to a BigInteger. So in Fortran, perhaps we can handle this as strings.\n\nLet me think of steps in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string into a character variable, say input_str.\n\nFind the position of '.' in input_str. Let's call it dot_pos.\n\nThen:\n\nif (input_str(dot_pos -1:dot_pos -1) == '9') then\n   intermediate_str = \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\nelse\n   decimal_digit = ichar(input_str(dot_pos +1:dot_pos +1)) - ichar('0')\n   if (decimal_digit >4) then\n      integer_part = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n      integer_value = integer_part converted to integer\n      new_value = integer_value +1\n      intermediate_str = string(new_value)\n   else\n      intermediate_str = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n   end if\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling strings and converting to integers can be done with internal reads or using functions like ichar and achar.\n\nBut need to be careful with leading zeros? Probably not, since the problem's context may not require that.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the input could be like \"9.9\", which would trigger the \"GOTO...\" output. So in that case, the code's output is the string \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" which is then the input to the second program. The second program would read that as S, but then process it. Wait, but the second program's code is for a problem where S is a string of digits. Wait, the second Java program is from AtCoder ABC164 D, which requires S to be a string of digits. So if the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second program would process that string, which contains letters and a period, which would cause the mod operations to fail? Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second program. So in the original Java setup, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. Therefore, the first program's output must be a string of digits, except when it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" which would not be a valid input for the second program. Wait, that can't be right. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the first Java code's problem.\n\nLooking at Codeforces problem 99A: the problem says that the input is a real number with exactly one decimal digit. The task is to round it to an integer. The output is either the rounded integer or \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" if the digit before the decimal is 9. Wait, no, the problem says that if the digit before the decimal is 9, then you can't round up, so you have to output that string. Wait, the problem's exact conditions?\n\nProblem 99A: The problem is called \"Unhappy Vegetables\". The problem says that you have a number with exactly one decimal digit. You need to round it to an integer. The rules are:\n\n- If the decimal digit is greater than 4, round up.\n- Else, round down.\n- However, if the digit before the decimal is 9, you cannot round up, so you must output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nWait, so the output is either the rounded integer (as a number) or the string \"GOTO Vasilisa.\".\n\nBut the second Java program (AtCoder ABC164 D) expects a string S which is a sequence of digits. So if the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second program would read that as S, which contains letters and a period, which would not be digits. That would cause the second program to fail. Therefore, this suggests that the first program's output must always be a number, except when the digit before the decimal is 9, in which case the output is the string. But then the second program can't process that. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup here. Wait, maybe the first program's output is only the number when it can be rounded, and the second program is only called when the first program's output is a number. But the problem says that the two Java programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. Therefore, the first program's output must be a string of digits. So the case where the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" would not be part of the input to the second program. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only the number, and the \"GOTO...\" is only printed when the digit before the decimal is 9, but in that case, the second program would not be executed? That can't be, since the problem states that the programs are executed in sequence. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is always a number except when the digit before the decimal is 9, in which case the second program is not run. But the problem says the programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output must be the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. Therefore, the first program's output must be a string of digits. So the case where the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" must not occur in the input scenarios where the second program is run. Or perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that the first program's output is always a number, so the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input to the second program. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number as a string, and the \"GOTO...\" is only printed when the digit before the decimal is 9, but in that case, the second program would read that string and process it. But the second program's code is expecting a string of digits. So if the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second program would process that string, which contains non-digit characters, leading to errors. Therefore, this suggests that the first program's output is only the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" is only printed when the digit before the decimal is 9, but in that case, the second program is not run. But the problem says the programs are run in sequence, so that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to re-examine the first Java code's logic again.\n\nLooking at the first Java code:\n\nThe code checks if the digit before the decimal is '9'. If yes, it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" and exits. Otherwise, it proceeds to check the decimal digit. So in that case, the second program would only be run when the first program's output is a number. So the input to the second program is the number string. Therefore, the first program's output is either a number string or the \"GOTO...\" string, but the second program is only run when the first program's output is a number. Therefore, the combined Fortran program must handle both cases, but when the first program outputs \"GOTO...\", the second program's processing is skipped, and the final output is \"GOTO...\".\n\nWait, but the problem says that the programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. Therefore, if the first program outputs \"GOTO...\", then the second program will read that as its input S, which is invalid. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is always a number string, so that the second program can process it. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is only the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios. Or perhaps the problem's setup is such that the first program's output is the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" is only printed when the digit before the decimal is 9, but in that case, the second program is not run. But the problem says the programs are run in sequence, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9, but that contradicts the code. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the number string in all cases except when the digit before the decimal is 9, in which case the second program is not run, but the problem requires that the two programs are run in sequence regardless. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. Let me look at the code again.\n\nIn the first Java code:\n\nif (str[dotIndex - 1] == '9') {\n    System.out.println(\"GOTO Vasilisa.\");\n} else if (Integer.parseInt(str[dotIndex + 1] + \"\") >4) {\n    ... output the incremented integer part\n} else {\n    ... output the integer part\n}\n\nSo when the digit before the decimal is '9', it outputs the string \"GOTO...\", and exits. So the second program will not receive any input (since the first program's output is that string). But the second program expects to read a string via sc.next(). So if the first program outputs \"GOTO...\", then the second program will read that as S, but then process it. However, the second program's code is designed for S being a string of digits. So this would cause an error. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is a number string, so that the second program can process it. Therefore, the first program's output is only the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios. Therefore, in the combined Fortran program, we can assume that the first program's output is a number string, so the second program can process it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. But that contradicts the code. So perhaps the problem's setup is that the first program's output is the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" is only printed when the digit before the decimal is 9, but in that case, the second program is not run. But the problem requires that the two programs are run in sequence, so that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to proceed under the assumption that the first program's output is a number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios. Or perhaps the second program can handle the \"GOTO...\" string as input, but that would require modifying the second program's code. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So the Fortran program must handle all cases as the original Java sequence does.\n\nTherefore, the combined Fortran program must first process the first step, and if the first step outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second step is not executed, and the final output is that string. Otherwise, the second step is executed and its output is printed.\n\nWait, but the second program is part of the sequence, so it must be run regardless. Therefore, the first program's output must be a valid input for the second program. Therefore, the first program's output must be a string of digits. So the case where the first program outputs \"GOTO...\" must not occur in the input scenarios. Therefore, the first program's output is always a number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input. Therefore, in the Fortran code, we can assume that the first program's output is a number string, so the second program can process it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. Let me see the code again.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, when the digit before the decimal is '9', it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" and exits. So the second program will not receive any input. But the second program must read from stdin. Therefore, in that case, the second program would read an empty string? Or the first program's output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", which is then the input to the second program. But the second program's code would process that string, which contains non-digit characters, leading to errors. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is a number string, so that the second program can process it. Therefore, the first program's output is always a number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios. Therefore, in the Fortran code, we can ignore the \"GOTO...\" case, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. Let me see the code again.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (str[dotIndex -1] == '9') {\n    System.out.println(\"GOTO Vasilisa.\");\n} else if ( ... ) { ... }\n\nSo in that case, when the digit before the decimal is '9', the first program outputs the string and exits. The second program will then read that string as its input. But the second program's code is expecting a string of digits. So this would cause an error. Therefore, the problem's setup must have the first program's output as a number string, so the second program can process it. Therefore, the first program's output is only the number string, and the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios. Therefore, in the Fortran code, we can assume that the first program's output is a number string, so the second program can process it.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, I can proceed under the assumption that the first program's output is a number string, so the second program can process it. Therefore, the first program's code can be translated to handle the cases where the digit before the decimal is not '9', and the second program's code can process the resulting number string.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read the input string. Let's say the input is a character array of length, say, 100 (or some sufficient length). Let's use a character(len=100) variable.\n\nThen, find the position of '.' in the string. Let's loop through each character until we find '.'.\n\nOnce found, check the character before it (index dot_pos -1). If it is '9', then output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" and exit. But in the combined program, we need to pass the intermediate string to the second step. Wait, but in the original setup, if the first program outputs \"GOTO...\", then the second program would read that as input. But in the combined program, we need to handle that case.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The combined Fortran program must handle all cases as the original sequence does. So if the first step outputs \"GOTO...\", then the second step is not executed, and the final output is \"GOTO...\".\n\nWait, but the second program is part of the sequence, so it must be run. Therefore, the first program's output must be the input to the second program. Therefore, if the first program outputs \"GOTO...\", then the second program will process that string. But the second program's code is designed for a string of digits. So this would cause an error. Therefore, the problem's test cases must ensure that the first program's output is a number string, so that the second program can process it. Therefore, in the combined Fortran program, we can assume that the first program's output is a number string, so the second program can process it. Therefore, the \"GOTO...\" case is not part of the input scenarios, so we can ignore it in the Fortran code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, no. The code explicitly checks if the digit before the decimal is '9', and in that case, outputs the string and exits. So the second program will not be run. But the problem says the programs are executed in sequence, so the second program must be run. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is the number string even when the digit before the decimal is 9. But that contradicts the code.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. I think I need to proceed with the code as written, even if it means that the second program may receive invalid input. The problem says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So the Fortran program must handle all cases exactly as the original Java sequence does.\n\nTherefore, in the case where the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", the second program will read that string as its input S. The second program's code will process it, but since S contains non-digit characters, the code will have undefined behavior. But the original Java code would also have the second program process that string, leading to errors. Therefore, the Fortran program must replicate that behavior.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after processing the first step, if the first step's output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second step's processing must be done with that string. But the second program's code is designed for S being a string of digits. So in Fortran, when processing the second step, we need to handle the case where S contains non-digits.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code uses sc.next() to read the input. So if the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then sc.next() would read the entire line as the string \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" (assuming that the first program's output is a single line). Then, the second program's code would process that string. The code for the second program is:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    String S = sc.next();\n    int N = S.length();\n    ... process S ...\n}\n\nSo S is the entire string read from the first program's output. The code then proceeds to process each character of S as digits. For example, in the first step of the second program's code:\n\nint tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\nIf S contains non-digit characters (like 'G', 'O', 'T', etc.), then (int) S.charAt(...) - '0' would give a value that is not a digit (e.g., 'G' is 71, '0' is 48, so 71-48=23, which is treated as a digit 23, which is invalid. But the code would proceed with that value. So the second program's code would process the string as if each character is a digit (even if it's not), leading to possibly incorrect results, but that's what the original Java sequence would do. Therefore, the Fortran code must replicate that behavior.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, even if the first step's output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", the second step must process it as a string of characters, even if they are not digits.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must handle all cases.\n\nNow, proceeding to code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFind the '.' position.\n\nCheck the character before '.'.\n\nIf it is '9', then the intermediate string is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\".\n\nElse, check the first character after '.'.\n\nIf that digit is >4, then take the part before '.' as a string, convert to integer, add 1, then convert back to string.\n\nElse, take the part before '.' as the string.\n\nThen, pass this intermediate string to the second part.\n\nThe second part processes this string as S.\n\nNow, the second part's logic:\n\nThe second Java program's code is for counting the number of pairs of substrings that form numbers divisible by 2019. The approach uses modular arithmetic.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nThe code reads S, then for each position i from 0 to N-1, computes mod_arr[i], which is (S's digit at position N-1 -i multiplied by 10^i mod 2019 plus previous mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019. Then, counts the number of pairs with same mod value.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to implement this.\n\nFirst, the steps:\n\nRead the intermediate string (from first step) as S.\n\nCompute N = len_trim(S).\n\nInitialize mod_arr array of size N.\n\nmod_cnt array of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\nInside, the code computes the character at position N-1 -i. So for i=0, it's the last character of S, then i=1 is the second last, etc.\n\nWait, the loop is over i from 0 to N-1, and for each i, the current character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). So the first iteration (i=0) processes the last character of S, then i=1 processes the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n    if (i != 0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i - 1]) % 2019;\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n    radix = radix * 10 % 2019;\n}\n\nWait, the first iteration (i=0):\n\ntmp is (digit at position N-1 -0 = N-1 (the last character) minus '0') * 1 (radix starts at 1) mod 2019.\n\nThen, since i=0, the 'if (i !=0)' is false, so mod_arr[0] = tmp.\n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented.\n\nradix becomes 10 mod 2019.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\ndigit is S.charAt(N-1 -1) = N-2 (second last character).\n\ntmp = (digit - '0') * 10 (radix now 10) mod 2019.\n\nThen, since i !=0, add mod_arr[0], mod 2019.\n\nmod_arr[1] = that value.\n\nmod_cnt is updated.\n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod 2019 = 100 mod 2019.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe key is that mod_arr[i] represents the value (S's substring from the end up to position i+1) mod 2019, but I'm not sure. The exact logic is a bit complex.\n\nThe goal is to compute for all possible substrings S[j..k], the number of pairs (j,k) where the number formed by the substring is divisible by 2019. The approach uses the fact that for a substring ending at position i (from the end?), the mod can be computed incrementally.\n\nThe code's approach is to compute for each position i (from 0 to N-1), the mod value of the substring ending at position (N-1 -i) (i.e., the substring from the end up to that position). The mod_arr[i] holds this value. The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs. The total number of pairs is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2).\n\nWait, the code's final answer is the sum over all mod values of mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2. But in the code, mod_cnt is initialized to 0, and then for each mod value, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented each time. However, the code also does mod_cnt[0]++ at the end. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as new int[2019], so all zeros.\n\nThen, during the loop, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented.\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 (mod_cnt[0]++). Then the sum is computed.\n\nWait, why?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2019; i++) {\n    ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i] -1)/2;\n}\n\nAh, perhaps the mod_cnt[0] is incremented to account for the empty substring or something else. Wait, perhaps the code is counting the number of substrings whose mod is 0, and then the number of pairs is (count choose 2). But why the mod_cnt[0] is incremented?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe code's approach is to compute for each position i (from 0 to N-1), the mod value of the substring S[ (N-1 -i) ... end ] (since the loop is processing from the end). The mod_arr[i] holds this value. The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs. The total number of pairs is the number of pairs of indices (i,j) where i < j and mod_arr[i] == mod_arr[j]. Because then, the difference between the two mod values would be divisible by 2019.\n\nWait, the explanation for this approach is that the difference between mod_arr[j] and mod_arr[i] (for j > i) would be equal to (the substring from i+1 to j) mod 2019. So if mod_arr[j] == mod_arr[i], then the substring from i+1 to j is divisible by 2019.\n\nTherefore, the number of such pairs is the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. Hence, for each mod value, the count is C(n,2) where n is the count of that mod value.\n\nBut in the code, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. Why?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is considering the empty prefix. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code initializes mod_cnt as all zeros. Then, during the loop, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. After the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented. Then the sum is computed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial value (before any characters) is considered as mod 0. So the total count for mod 0 is increased by 1 to account for that.\n\nYes, that's probably it. The code is using the standard approach for counting the number of pairs where the difference between two mod values is 0. The initial value (before any digits) is considered as 0 mod 2019, so when a substring starts at the beginning and ends at position j, the mod would be mod_arr[j] - 0 mod 2019. Therefore, the initial 0 is added to the mod_cnt array.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the second part's processing:\n\nGiven the intermediate string S (from first step), we need to compute the answer as per the second Java program.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe can represent S as a character array.\n\nCompute N = len_trim(S).\n\nInitialize mod_arr as an array of integers of size N.\n\nmod_cnt as an array of integers of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0.\n\nradix = 1.\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with explicit declarations.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1 (0-based). Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, let's use 1-based indices for the arrays.\n\nWait, but the code's variables:\n\nmod_arr has size N (since i runs from 0 to N-1 in Java, so mod_arr has N elements).\n\nmod_cnt has size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nIn Fortran, we can declare:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\nBut Fortran allows arrays with any lower bound, but perhaps easier to use 0-based.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based and adjust indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with 0-based arrays.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds. So for mod_arr of size N (0 to N-1):\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: mod_arr\n\nSimilarly for mod_cnt(0:2018).\n\nNow, the loop:\n\ndo i = 0, N-1\n\n   current_char = S(N - i)  ! Because in Java, the character is at position N-1 -i (since i starts at 0). Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in Java, the character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). Since in Fortran, the string is 1-based, so S(1) is first character, S(N) is last.\n\nSo for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nJava's N-1 -i is the position in the string (0-based in Java). In Fortran, the position is (N - i) because:\n\nJava's S has length N, so the last character is at index N-1 (0-based). In Fortran, the last character is at position N (1-based). So for i=0, the character is S(N) (last character). For i=1, it's S(N-1), etc.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the current character is S(N - i).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's S.charAt(N-1 -i) \u2192 in Fortran, the position is (N-1 -i +1) = N -i.\n\nYes.\n\nSo current_char = S(N - i)\n\ndigit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\ntmp = digit * radix mod 2019\n\nif (i ==0) then\n\n   mod_arr(i) = tmp mod 2019\n\nelse\n\n   mod_arr(i) = (tmp + mod_arr(i-1)) mod 2019\n\nend if\n\nWait, no. The code in Java:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) % 2019\n\nif (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp\n\nmod_cnt[tmp] +=1\n\nradix = (radix *10) %2019\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ntmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif (i >0) then\n\n   tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function is modulo, but the sign is important. However, since all values are positive, mod should work.\n\nWait, in Fortran, modulo(a,b) gives a result with the same sign as b. mod(a,b) gives a result with the same sign as a. But since all values here are positive, mod and modulo are the same.\n\nAlternatively, use modulo.\n\nBut perhaps better to use modulo to be safe.\n\nSo:\n\ntmp = modulo( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif (i >0) then\n\n   tmp = modulo( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nradix = modulo( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nAfter the loop, we need to increment mod_cnt(0) by 1.\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nThen compute the answer:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i =0, 2018\n\n   ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i) -1) /2\n\nend do\n\nThen output ans.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (from the user).\n\n2. Process it through the first step's logic to get the intermediate string.\n\n3. Process that intermediate string through the second step's logic to get the final answer.\n\n4. Output the final answer (or the intermediate string if the first step outputs \"GOTO...\").\n\nWait, but in the first step's case where the output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second step is not executed, and the final output is that string. But according to the problem's requirement, the first program's output is the second's input, so the second program must be run. Therefore, the second program will process the \"GOTO...\" string, leading to an answer computed based on that string. The Fortran program must replicate that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must always process both steps, even if the first step's output is \"GOTO...\".\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nProcess first step to get intermediate_str.\n\nProcess second step with intermediate_str as S.\n\nOutput the second step's result.\n\nWait, but in the first step's case where the output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then the second step will process that string, which may result in an answer computed from that string. The original Java sequence would do the same.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must proceed as follows:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nProcess first step to get intermediate_str.\n\nThen, process the second step with intermediate_str as S.\n\nOutput the second step's result.\n\nTherefore, even if the first step outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", the second step is run with that string, and the final output is the second step's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first step's processing.\n\nRead the input string:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nThen, find the position of '.' in input_str.\n\ninteger :: dot_pos = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   if (input_str(i:i) == '.') then\n\n      dot_pos = i\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nIf dot_pos is 0, then there is no '.'? But according to the problem's first program's code, the input has a '.'.\n\nAssuming that the input has exactly one '.'.\n\nThen, check the character before the '.'.\n\ncharacter :: before_dot = input_str(dot_pos -1:dot_pos -1)\n\nif (before_dot == '9') then\n\n   intermediate_str = \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\nelse\n\n   decimal_digit_char = input_str(dot_pos +1:dot_pos +1)\n\n   decimal_digit = ichar(decimal_digit_char) - ichar('0')\n\n   if (decimal_digit >4) then\n\n      integer_part_str = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n\n      integer_value = 0\n\n      read(integer_part_str,*) integer_value\n\n      integer_value = integer_value +1\n\n      write(intermediate_str, '(I0)') integer_value\n\n   else\n\n      intermediate_str = input_str(1:dot_pos-1)\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting a string to integer can be done with read.\n\nBut need to ensure that the string is properly formatted.\n\nAlso, the intermediate_str must be a character string.\n\nBut in the case where the first step outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", then intermediate_str is that string.\n\nNow, after getting intermediate_str, we need to process it through the second step.\n\nThe second step's processing requires the string S = intermediate_str.\n\nSo, the second step's variables:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: S = trim(intermediate_str)\n\ninteger :: N = len_trim(S)\n\nThen, proceed with the second step's logic.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe full Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram combined\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=100) :: input_str, intermediate_str, S\n  integer :: dot_pos, i, N, mod_arr(0:99), mod_cnt(0:2018), tmp, radix, ans\n  integer :: integer_value, decimal_digit\n  character :: before_dot, decimal_digit_char\n\n  !

Output the answer\n  print*, ans\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but there are some issues here.\n\nFirst, in the first step's processing, the variable integer_part_str is used but not declared. Need to declare it as a character variable.\n\nAlso, in the first step's case where the output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", the second step will process that string. The code for the second step must handle all characters, even non-digits.\n\nIn the second step's loop:\n\ndigit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\nThis will compute the digit as (ASCII value of current_char) minus 48. For non-digit characters, this will give a value outside 0-9, but the code proceeds with that.\n\nThe rest of the code should handle it.\n\nNow, checking variable declarations:\n\nIn the first step:\n\ninteger_part_str needs to be declared as a character variable.\n\nAdding:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: integer_part_str\n\nAlso, in the first step's else block, when the decimal digit is >4, the code reads integer_part_str into integer_value. But if the integer_part_str has leading zeros, that's okay, as read will ignore leading spaces but not zeros. For example, \"00123\" would be read as 123, but the original code in Java uses BigInteger, which would treat it as 123. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the code should be:\n\nprogram combined\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=100) :: input_str, intermediate_str, S, integer_part_str\n  integer :: dot_pos, i, N, mod_arr(0:99), mod_cnt(0:2018), tmp, radix, ans\n  integer :: integer_value, decimal_digit\n  character :: before_dot, decimal_digit_char\n\n  !

Output the answer\n  print*, ans\n\nend program combined\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The mod_arr array is declared as size 0:99. Since N can be up to 100 (since input_str is 100 characters), but in the first step, the intermediate_str could be up to 100 characters. So mod_arr(0:N-1) would need to be dynamically sized. But in Fortran, arrays must be declared with fixed sizes. Therefore, the current code uses mod_arr(0:99), which is okay if N is up to 100. Since the input_str is 100 characters, the intermediate_str can be up to 100 characters (e.g., if the input is \"99999999999999999999.9\", then the integer part is 19 9's, which is 19 characters, so N would be 19. So the array size is sufficient.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the intermediate_str is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", which has length 16 (including the period). The second step's loop will process all 16 characters. The code should handle that.\n\nAnother point: in the first step's case where the decimal digit is >4, the code reads the integer_part_str into integer_value. If the integer_part_str is empty (unlikely, since there's a '.'), but in the problem's context, it's safe.\n\nAlso, when writing intermediate_str using write(intermediate_str, '(I0)'), the string may have leading spaces if the integer_value is shorter than the previous length. But since we are trimming S, it should be okay.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSample input for first program: \"123.4\" \u2192 first step outputs \"123\", then second program processes \"123\".\n\nSecond program's processing of \"123\" (N=3):\n\nmod_arr:\n\ni=0: current_char is '3' (position 3). digit=3.\n\ntmp = 3 * 1 mod 2019 \u2192 3.\n\nmod_arr(0)=3. mod_cnt(3)=1. radix=10.\n\ni=1: current_char is '2' (position 2). digit=2.\n\ntmp = 2 *10 mod 2019 \u2192 20.\n\ntmp + mod_arr(0) \u2192 20+3=23 mod 2019 \u219223.\n\nmod_arr(1)=23. mod_cnt(23)=1. radix=100.\n\ni=2: current_char is '1' (position 1). digit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *100 mod 2019 \u2192100.\n\ntmp + mod_arr(1)=100+23=123 mod 2019 \u2192123.\n\nmod_arr(2)=123. mod_cnt(123)=1. radix=1000 mod 2019.\n\nAfter loop:\n\nmod_cnt(0) is incremented to 1 (initial 0).\n\nNow, mod_cnt for 3,23,123 are 1 each. mod_cnt(0) is 1.\n\nThe total ans is sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). Since all counts are 1 except mod 0 (count 1), the total is 0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nBut let's see what the second Java program would do with input \"123\".\n\nThe code would compute mod values for each position:\n\nProcessing from the end:\n\ni=0 (char '3'):\n\ntmp =3 *1 mod2019 \u21923. mod_arr[0]=3. mod_cnt[3]=1. radix=10.\n\ni=1 (char '2'):\n\ntmp =2 *10 mod2019 \u219220. add mod_arr[0]=3 \u219223 mod2019 \u219223. mod_cnt[23] becomes 1. radix=100.\n\ni=2 (char '1'):\n\ntmp =1 *100 mod2019 \u2192100. add mod_arr[1]=23 \u2192123 mod2019 \u2192123. mod_cnt[123] becomes 1. radix=1000 mod2019.\n\nmod_cnt[0] is 1 (initial 0).\n\nThus, all counts are 1 except mod 0 (count 1). So the total is 0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\".\n\nInput: \"9.9\".\n\nFirst step: before_dot is '9', so output is \"GOTO Vasilisa.\".\n\nSecond step processes this string (length 16).\n\nThe second program's code will process each character as digits (even though they are letters and '.'), leading to various mod values. The final answer will be computed based on those.\n\nThe Fortran code should replicate that.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
