So I need to declare them outside. Wait, let me adjust the code.

So in the variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n\nWait, but then dist and x are declared as integers.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC133_B) reads N and D, then N vectors of D integers each. It calculates the Euclidean distance squared between every pair of vectors. Then, it checks if the square root of that distance is an integer (by seeing if the decimal part is less than 0.001). The count of such pairs is the answer. Finally, it prints that count.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_579_A) takes an integer n, converts it to binary, counts the number of 1's in the binary representation, and prints that count.\n\nBut since they are run in sequence, the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the answer) is the input n for the second program. The final output is the count of 1's in the binary of that answer.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first program), process both steps without I/O in between, and then output the final result from the second step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read N and D, then the vectors from input.\n2. Compute the answer (count of pairs with integer distance squared).\n3. Take that answer as n for the second part.\n4. Convert n to binary, count the 1's, and output that count.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the input using read(*,*) statements. The vectors can be stored in a 2D array. The loops for calculating the distances and the count need to be translated.\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based indices. So I need to adjust the indices accordingly. For example, in the Java code, vectors are from 0 to N-1 and 0 to D-1. In Fortran, I can declare the array as (N,D) and use indices 1 to N and 1 to D. So when looping, adjust the loops to start from 1.\n\nThe distance calculation: for each pair i < j, compute the sum of squares of differences in each dimension. Then take the square root and check if it's integer.\n\nThe key part is the check for whether the square root is an integer. In Java, they check if the difference between the square root and its floor is less than 0.001. So in Fortran, compute the square root, then see if the fractional part is less than 0.001.\n\nNow, the second part: taking the answer from the first part (let's call it count_pairs) and then converting it to binary, counting the 1's.\n\nThe second Java program reads n, converts to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and taking remainders. Then counts the 1's in the binary string.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can do this without strings. For example, loop while n >0, and count the bits. Each time, check if n mod 2 is 1, add to the count, then divide n by 2.\n\nSo the steps for the second part can be done with a loop:\n\nInitialize ans =0\n\ntemp = count_pairs\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   ans = ans + mod(temp,2)\n\n   temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nThen output ans.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will have:\n\n- Read N and D, then read the vectors.\n\n- Compute the count_pairs as per first Java program.\n\n- Then compute the binary 1's count of count_pairs.\n\n- Output that count.\n\nNow, let's think about the variables. The vectors can be stored in a 2D array. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, declare something like:\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\nBut since the dimensions are read at runtime, we need to read N and D first, then allocate.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can have allocatable arrays. So the steps would be:\n\nRead N and D first.\n\nallocate(vectors(N,D))\n\nThen read the vectors.\n\nThen process the pairs.\n\nNow, the loops for the first part:\n\nThe outer loops are over i from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N.\n\nFor each i,j pair, compute the distance squared.\n\nThen compute sqrt(dist). Check if it's integer.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the sqrt function returns a real. So:\n\ndist is an integer (sum of squares). Then:\n\nsqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist))\n\nThen check if sqrt_dist is integer. How?\n\nWe can check if the fractional part is less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999 (since maybe due to floating point precision, but the original code uses Math.sqrt which is double precision, so perhaps just checking the fractional part < 0.001 is sufficient).\n\nWait the original code does:\n\nif (Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001) then count as integer.\n\nSo in Fortran, compute the fractional part as sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist). Take absolute value, compare to 0.001.\n\nSo code:\n\nreal :: sqrt_dist\n\nsqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist))\n\nif (abs(sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then\n\n   count_pairs = count_pairs +1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the floor function returns a real? Or integer? Let me check: floor(real) returns the same kind as the argument. So if sqrt_dist is real, then floor returns real. So the difference is real.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, the second part: the count of 1's in binary of count_pairs.\n\nInitialize ans =0\n\ntemp = count_pairs\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   ans = ans + mod(temp,2)\n\n   temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) N, D\n\nallocate(vectors(N,D))\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   read(*,*) (vectors(i,d), d=1,D)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute count_pairs\n\ncount_pairs =0\n\ndo i =1, N-1\n\n   do j = i+1, N\n\n      integer :: dist\n\n      dist =0\n\n      do d =1, D\n\n         integer :: x\n\n         x = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)\n\n         dist = dist + x*x\n\n      end do\n\n      real :: sqrt_dist\n\n      sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist))\n\n      if (abs(sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then\n\n         count_pairs = count_pairs +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\n! Now process the second part\n\nans =0\n\ntemp = count_pairs\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   ans = ans + mod(temp,2)\n\n   temp = temp /2\n\nend do\n\n! Output the answer\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\ndeallocate(vectors)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. Let me check the variable declarations.\n\nThe variables N, D, i,j,d, count_pairs, temp, ans are all integers. The vectors array is 2D.\n\nThe variables inside the loops like dist and x need to be declared. Wait in the loops, inside the i,j loops:\n\ndist is declared as integer. But in Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop. So perhaps better to declare them inside the i loop, but in Fortran, declarations can be inside blocks? Or better to declare them at the top.\n\nAlternatively, declare dist and x inside the i loop.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables can be declared anywhere, but it's better to declare them at the top of the scope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to move the declarations to the top.\n\nWait, let me reorganize the code.\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\ninteger :: dist, x ! declare these at the top?\n\nWait, but in the loops, for each i,j pair, we need to compute dist. So perhaps declare dist and x inside the i loop?\n\nAlternatively, declare them outside, but reinitialized each time.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to have dist and x as local variables inside the i,j loops. But in Fortran, variables must be declared before their use. So perhaps declare them at the top of the program.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the code inside the loops uses dist and x. So in the code I wrote earlier, the variables dist and x are declared inside the loop. But in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside a loop unless using a block. So that's an error.\n\nAh, right. So I need to declare them outside.\n\nWait, let me adjust the code.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nInside the i loop:\n\ndo i =1, N-1\n\n   do j = i+1, N\n\n      dist =0\n\n      do d =1, D\n\n         x = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)\n\n         dist = dist + x*x\n\n      end do\n\n      ... \n\nSo variables dist and x must be declared before the loops.\n\nSo in the variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n\nWait, but then dist and x are declared as integers. But in each i,j pair, we need to reinitialize them. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables retain their values between iterations unless reinitialized. So we need to set dist to 0 each time.\n\nYes, so in the code, before the d loop, set dist =0, and x is computed each time.\n\nWait, but x is a temporary variable for each dimension. So in each iteration of d, x is the difference for that dimension. So x can be declared as an integer, and in each d loop, it's re-computed.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the code is:\n\ndo d =1, D\n\n   x = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)\n\n   dist = dist + x*x\n\nend do\n\nSo x is used here. So x must be declared as an integer variable. So in the variable declarations, we need to have x as an integer.\n\nSo the variable declarations would be:\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n\nWait, but then, in each i,j loop, we need to set dist to 0 each time. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables retain their values between iterations. So if we don't set dist to 0 each time, it would carry over from previous loops. So yes, the code sets dist =0 at the start of each i,j pair.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, the code for the first part is okay.\n\nNow, the second part: the loop for counting the bits.\n\ntemp is initialized to count_pairs, then loop while temp>0.\n\nEach iteration, ans += mod(temp,2), then temp = temp/2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nWhat if count_pairs is 0? Then the binary is 0, so ans is 0. That's correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the first program's output is 3 (binary 11), then the second part would output 2.\n\nNow, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so when temp is odd, mod(temp,2) is 1, then temp becomes (temp-1)/2.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor. Since we are dealing with positive numbers, it's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nIn the first part, the vectors are read correctly. The loops for i and j are correct (since in Java it's i from 0 to N-2, j from i+1 to N-1, but in Fortran, starting at 1, so i from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N).\n\nThe distance calculation is correct.\n\nThe sqrt is computed as real(dist), so that's okay.\n\nThe check for the fractional part is correct.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\n- The vectors array is allocated after reading N and D. That's correct.\n\n- The deallocate is at the end, after the second part's processing. That's okay.\n\nNow, the output is only the final ans, which is correct.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write write(*,*) ans, it will print the number followed by a new line, which is what the Java code does with System.out.println.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let me write the code properly with all variables declared at the top.\n\nHere's the final code:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n  integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) N, D\n  allocate(vectors(N,D))\n  do i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) (vectors(i,d), d=1,D)\n  end do\n\n  ! Compute count_pairs\n  count_pairs = 0\n  do i = 1, N-1\n    do j = i+1, N\n      dist = 0\n      do d = 1, D\n        x = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)\n        dist = dist + x * x\n      end do\n      real :: sqrt_dist\n      sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist))\n      if (abs(sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then\n        count_pairs = count_pairs + 1\n      end if\n    end do\n  end do\n\n  ! Process the second part\n  ans = 0\n  temp = count_pairs\n  do while (temp > 0)\n    ans = ans + mod(temp, 2)\n    temp = temp / 2\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result\n  write(*,*) ans\n\n  deallocate(vectors)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, sqrt_dist is declared inside the loop. Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, inside the i,j loops, I have:\n\nreal :: sqrt_dist\n\nBut in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside a loop unless using a block. So that's an error.\n\nAh, right! That's a mistake. The variable sqrt_dist must be declared at the top.\n\nSo I need to move the declaration of sqrt_dist to the variable declarations.\n\nWait, but sqrt_dist is a real variable. So the variable declarations should include it.\n\nSo the variables:\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n\nreal :: sqrt_dist\n\nWait, but then in each iteration of the i,j loops, we need to compute sqrt_dist. So that's okay.\n\nSo the corrected code would have sqrt_dist declared as a real variable at the top.\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, D, i, j, d, count_pairs, temp, ans, dist, x\n  real :: sqrt_dist\n  integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) N, D\n  allocate(vectors(N,D))\n  do i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) (vectors(i,d), d=1,D)\n  end do\n\n  ! Compute count_pairs\n  count_pairs = 0\n  do i = 1, N-1\n    do j = i+1, N\n      dist = 0\n      do d = 1, D\n        x = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)\n        dist = dist + x * x\n      end do\n      sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist))\n      if (abs(sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then\n        count_pairs = count_pairs + 1\n      end if\n    end do\n  end do\n\n  ! Process the second part\n  ans = 0\n  temp = count_pairs\n  do while (temp > 0)\n    ans = ans + mod(temp, 2)\n    temp = temp / 2\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result\n  write(*,*) ans\n\n  deallocate(vectors)\nend program main\n\nYes, that's better. Now sqrt_dist is declared at the top as a real variable. Each time through the i,j loops, it's recomputed.\n\nWait, but in each iteration of the i,j loops, the value of sqrt_dist is overwritten. That's okay.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, the distance is computed as the sum of squares. Since each x is the difference between two integers, x*x is an integer, so dist is an integer. The square root is computed as a real, so that's okay.\n\nThe check for the fractional part is correct.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 3 (so the second program's input is 3, which has two 1's in binary). The code should output 2.\n\nAnother test case: if the first program's answer is 0, then the second outputs 0.\n\nAnother case: if the first program's answer is 5 (binary 101), then the second outputs 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work."
