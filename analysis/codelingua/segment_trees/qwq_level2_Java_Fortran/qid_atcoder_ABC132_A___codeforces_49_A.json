    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (atcoder_ABC132_A): It reads a string, checks if exactly two different characters each appear exactly twice. So the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nSecond Java file (codeforces_49_A): It reads a string, finds the last non-space and non-question mark character, checks if it's a vowel (including y), outputs YES or NO.\n\nThe key is to chain them so the output of the first is input to the second. But in Fortran, I have to do this without I/O in the middle. So the first program's output (Yes/No) becomes the input for the second's processing. Wait, but the second program expects a string input. Wait, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which would be the input to the second program. But the second program's logic is based on the last character of the input string. Wait, but the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so the second program would process that string.\n\nWait, the original setup is that the first Java program's output is the input to the second. So when you run them in sequence, the first's output is piped into the second's input. So the second program's input is the output of the first, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second program's code is expecting a string, which in this case would be \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then the second program processes that string. Let me see:\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program's input is \"Yes\". The second program looks for the last non-space and non-? character. Since \"Yes\" has no spaces or ?, the last character is 's'. Then check if 's' is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y). 's' is not, so output NO. So the final output would be NO.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is looking for the last character that is not a space or question mark. So in \"Yes\", the last character is 's', which is not a vowel, so output NO. So the combined output would be NO.\n\nBut the user wants the Fortran program to do the same as the sequence. So the Fortran program must first process the input string through the first's logic, then pass that result (Yes/No) to the second's processing, and output the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the input (the original input to the first Java program), process it as per the first Java program, then take that result (Yes/No) and process it as per the second Java program, then output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin) for the first program.\n\n2. Process it to determine if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. The result is a string \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n3. Take that result string and process it through the second program's logic: find the last non-space and non-? character, check if it's a vowel (including y), output YES or NO.\n\nSo the Fortran program must do all that in one go, without any intermediate I/O.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first part counts the occurrences of each character in the input string. Then checks if all counts are exactly 2 and there are exactly two different characters.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see:\n\nWe can read the input string. Let's say the input is up to, say, 100 characters (since the problem's first Java program uses next(), which reads a token, but in the second Java program, it uses nextLine(). Wait, the first Java program uses in.next(), which reads the next token (so until whitespace), but the second uses nextLine(). Hmm, but in the original setup, the first program's input is a string (the first token), and the second's input is the output of the first, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a single token. So perhaps in Fortran, the input is read as a single line, but the first part processes the entire string (since in the first Java program, it's using next(), which would read the entire line if there's no whitespace? Wait, no. next() reads until whitespace. But the second Java program uses nextLine(), which reads the entire line. So perhaps the first Java program's input is a single word (no spaces), and the second's input is the output of the first (Yes/No), which is a single word. So in Fortran, the input is read as a single line (the first's input), then process it, then process the result through the second's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the first Java program's input is a single token (since it uses next()), so the input is a single word. The second program's input is the output of the first, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is a single word. So in Fortran, the input is read as a single string (the first's input), then process it, then process the result string through the second's logic.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string (the first's input) from stdin.\n\nProcess it as per first Java program:\n\n- Count the frequency of each character.\n\n- Check if exactly two distinct characters, each with count 2.\n\n- The result is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThen, take that result string and process it as per the second Java program:\n\n- Find the last character that is not a space or '?'. Since the result is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which have no spaces or '?', so the last character is the last character of the string.\n\n- Convert to lowercase (Fortran has functions for that).\n\n- Check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y).\n\n- Output YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe can read the input string as a character array. Let's say the first input is up to, say, 10 characters (since the first Java program's input is a string that must have exactly two characters each appearing twice, so length must be 4, but maybe the code allows longer? Wait, the first Java program's code counts all characters, so if the input is longer than 4, then counts would exceed 2. So the input must be exactly 4 characters with two pairs. But the code doesn't check that. So in Fortran, we can read a string of reasonable length, say 100.\n\nBut in Fortran, reading a string can be done with read(*,'(A)') string. But need to declare the string with sufficient length.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Read the input string (for first part):\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nBut in Fortran, when reading with '(A)', it reads until end of line. So that's okay.\n\n2. Process first part:\n\nWe need to count the frequency of each character in input_str.\n\nWe can use an array to count. Since characters can be uppercase or lowercase? The first Java program's code uses the actual characters as keys in the HashMap. So in the input_str, the case matters. Wait, the first Java code uses the characters as they are. So for example, if the input is \"aA\", then the counts would be a:1, A:1, so total 2 characters each with count 1, so the result would be No.\n\nWait, the first Java code's code counts each occurrence of each character, case-sensitive. So in Fortran, we need to do the same.\n\nSo, in Fortran, we can have an array of counts for each possible ASCII character. Since characters can be uppercase or lowercase, we can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) or 128, but better to use 256.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is a string, we can loop through each character and count.\n\nInitialize an array of integers, say count(256) = 0.\n\nLoop over each character in input_str:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   c = input_str(i:i)\n\n   ichar_val = ichar(c)\n\n   count(ichar_val) = count(ichar_val) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen, check the counts:\n\nWe need to check that exactly two different characters have count 2, and all others have 0.\n\nSo:\n\nnum_chars = 0\n\nok = .true.\n\ndo i = 0, 255\n\n   if (count(i) == 2) then\n\n      num_chars = num_chars + 1\n\n   elseif (count(i) /= 0) then\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (num_chars == 2 .and. ok) then\n\n   first_result = \"Yes\"\n\nelse\n\n   first_result = \"No\"\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the check is:\n\nfor each entry in the map, if any count !=2 \u2192 ok becomes false.\n\nThen, if ok and map.size() ==2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code above should do the same.\n\nWait, the code above counts how many characters have exactly 2, and if any have non-zero and not 2, then ok is false.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the first_result is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, process this first_result string through the second Java program's logic.\n\nSecond part's logic:\n\nTake the first_result string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), and process it as per the second Java code.\n\nThe second Java code reads a string (the input), then loops from the end backwards to find the first character that is not a space or '?'. Then check if that character is a vowel (lowercase).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe input for the second part is the first_result string (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nWe need to process this string.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe second Java code's code:\n\nString s = sc.nextLine();\n\nint length = s.length();\n\nchar ch = 0;\n\nfor (int i = length - 1; i >=0; i--) {\n\n   if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && s.charAt(i) != '?') {\n\n      ch = s.charAt(i);\n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nch = Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n\nif (ch is vowel \u2192 YES else NO.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nTake the first_result string (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nLoop from the end backwards until a character that is not space or '?'. Take that character, lowercase it, check vowels.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nsecond_input = first_result\n\nch = ' '\n\ndo i = len_trim(second_input), 1, -1\n\n   c = second_input(i:i)\n\n   if (c /= ' ' .and. c /= '?') then\n\n      ch = c\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, convert to lowercase: ch = char(ichar(ch) + 32) if uppercase, but need to check.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert to lowercase, we can use the ichar and achar functions.\n\nBut need to check if the character is uppercase. For example:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n   ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\nelse\n\n   ch remains as is.\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function: ch = char(ichar(ch, kind=1) + 32) if uppercase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a function.\n\nOnce ch is lowercase, check if it is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nIf yes \u2192 output YES, else NO.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nWe can have first_result as a character string, say of length 4 (since \"Yes\" and \"No\" are 3 and 2, but to be safe, 4).\n\nWait, \"Yes\" is 3 letters, \"No\" is 2. So first_result can be declared as character(len=4).\n\nNow, putting all steps into code.\n\nNow, the Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram combined\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=100) :: input_str\n\n  character(len=4) :: first_result\n\n  character(len=1) :: ch\n\n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n\n  integer :: i, num_chars, len_input\n\n  logical :: ok\n\n  ! Read input for first part\n\n  read(*,'(A)') input_str\n\n  ! Process first part\n\n  len_input = len_trim(input_str)\n\n  do i = 1, len_input\n\n     count(ichar(input_str(i:i))) = count(ichar(input_str(i:i))) + 1\n\n  end do\n\n  ok = .true.\n\n  num_chars = 0\n\n  do i = 0, 255\n\n     if (count(i) == 2) then\n\n        num_chars = num_chars + 1\n\n     else if (count(i) /= 0) then\n\n        ok = .false.\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  if (num_chars == 2 .and. ok) then\n\n     first_result = \"Yes\"\n\n  else\n\n     first_result = \"No\"\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Process second part using first_result as input\n\n  ! Find last non-space and non-? character\n\n  ch = ' '\n\n  do i = len_trim(first_result), 1, -1\n\n     if (first_result(i:i) /= ' ' .and. first_result(i:i) /= '?') then\n\n        ch = first_result(i:i)\n\n        exit\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert to lowercase\n\n  if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n     ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Check if vowel\n\n  if (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n\n     print *, \"YES\"\n\n  else\n\n     print *, \"NO\"\n\n  end if\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the second part's processing, the input is first_result. The first_result is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn \"Yes\", the last character is 's', which is lowercase already. The check would be 's' not a vowel \u2192 output NO.\n\nIn \"No\", the last character is 'o', which is a vowel \u2192 output YES.\n\nWait, let's test with examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput to first program: \"aabb\" \u2192 counts a:2, b:2 \u2192 first_result is \"Yes\".\n\nThen second part processes \"Yes\" \u2192 last character 's' \u2192 not vowel \u2192 output NO.\n\nSo the final output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: input to first program is \"abab\" \u2192 same counts \u2192 first_result \"Yes\" \u2192 same as above \u2192 output NO.\n\nAnother test case: input to first program is \"abcd\" \u2192 counts each 1 \u2192 first_result \"No\".\n\nThen second part processes \"No\" \u2192 last character 'o' (lowercase?), wait \"No\" is 'N' followed by 'o'.\n\nWait, first_result is \"No\" (capital N, lowercase o). The second part's processing:\n\nThe first_result is \"No\", so the characters are 'N' and 'o'.\n\nLooping from the end (i=2):\n\ni=2: character is 'o', which is not space or '?', so ch is 'o'.\n\nThen converting to lowercase: 'o' is already lowercase. So check vowels \u2192 yes \u2192 output YES.\n\nWait, so in this case, the final output would be YES.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIf the first program's output is \"No\", then the second program's input is \"No\".\n\nThe last non-space and non-? character is 'o', which is a vowel \u2192 so output YES.\n\nSo the final output would be YES.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, if the input is \"abcd\", the first program outputs \"No\", then the second program's input is \"No\", so the second program's output is YES.\n\nHmm, so the combined program would output YES in that case.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is \"aabb\" \u2192 first output \"Yes\" \u2192 second output NO.\n\nAnother case: first program's input is \"aabbcc\" \u2192 counts a:2, b:2, c:2 \u2192 three characters \u2192 first output \"No\" \u2192 second input is \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nWait, but the first program's code requires exactly two characters each with count 2. So in \"aabbcc\", three characters each with count 2 \u2192 the first program would output \"No\" (since map.size() is 3, not 2). So first_result is \"No\", then second part outputs YES.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is \"abba\" \u2192 counts a:2, b:2 \u2192 first_result \"Yes\" \u2192 second output NO.\n\nAnother case: first program's input is \"abAB\" \u2192 counts a:1, b:1, A:1, B:1 \u2192 total four characters, each count 1 \u2192 first output \"No\" \u2192 second input \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is \"No\", so the last character is 'o', which is vowel \u2192 YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, checking the code for possible issues.\n\nIn the first part, the count array is initialized to 0. Then, for each character in input_str, we get its ASCII code via ichar, and increment count(ichar(...)).\n\nYes.\n\nThen, the loop over all 256 possible ASCII codes. For each, if count is 2 \u2192 increment num_chars. If count is non-zero and not 2 \u2192 set ok to false.\n\nWait, but the code as written:\n\nok is initialized to .true.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to 255:\n\nif count(i) ==2 \u2192 add to num_chars.\n\nElse if count(i) !=0 \u2192 then ok becomes false.\n\nWait, but this is a problem. Because, for example, if a character has count 3, then the else if is triggered, so ok becomes false. But if another character has count 2, but another has count 1, then ok is set to false.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut the code's logic is:\n\nfor all entries in the map (i.e., all characters with count>0):\n\nif any has count !=2 \u2192 ok is false.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nThen, after processing all, if ok and num_chars ==2 \u2192 yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nProcessing first_result (either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nThe loop starts from the end of the string (len_trim(first_result)), stepping back.\n\nThe first non-space and non-? character is taken.\n\nIn \"Yes\", the characters are 'Y', 'e', 's'. The last character is 's', so ch is 's'.\n\nThen, converting to lowercase: 's' is lowercase already \u2192 remains 's'.\n\nCheck vowels: 's' is not \u2192 output NO.\n\nIn \"No\", the characters are 'N', 'o'. The last character is 'o', so ch is 'o'. Convert to lowercase (already lowercase) \u2192 'o' is vowel \u2192 output YES.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: first_result is \"Yes \" (with a space at the end). Then the last non-space is 's', so same as before.\n\nBut in the first Java program's output, the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so no trailing spaces. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother case: first_result is \"Y?es\" \u2192 then the last non-? and non-space is 's'.\n\nBut the first program's output can't have '?', since the first program's output is only \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the count array is declared as 0:255. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but here we can use 0:255. Wait, in Fortran, when you declare an array with (0:255), it's allowed as long as the compiler allows it. Some compilers might require the lower bound to be 1, but in modern Fortran, you can specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, use 1:256, but then adjust the indices. Wait, perhaps better to use 0:255.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the default lower bound is 1, but you can set it to 0. So the declaration is okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, the loop over i from 1 to len_input. The len_trim gives the length of the string. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the code should be okay.\n\nWait, in the first part, when we do count(ichar(...)), the ichar returns the ASCII code, which is 0-255 for standard ASCII. So the array is correctly indexed.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nTesting possible edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput to first program: \"aabb\" \u2192 first_result \"Yes\" \u2192 second part's output is NO.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput to first program: \"abab\" \u2192 same as above \u2192 second output NO.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nInput to first program: \"abcd\" \u2192 first_result \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nTest case 4:\n\nInput to first program: \"aabbcc\" \u2192 first_result \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nTest case 5:\n\nInput to first program: \"AaBb\" \u2192 counts A:1, a:1, B:1, b:1 \u2192 total 4 characters, each count 1 \u2192 first_result \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nAnother test case where first program's output is \"Yes\" but the second's input is \"Yes\" \u2192 output NO.\n\nAnother case where first program's output is \"No\" \u2192 second output YES.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, writing the Fortran code as per above.\n\nWait, in the code, the second part's loop:\n\ndo i = len_trim(first_result), 1, -1\n\n   if (first_result(i:i) /= ' ' .and. first_result(i:i) /= '?') then\n\n      ch = first_result(i:i)\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nThen, converting to lowercase.\n\nThe code uses:\n\nif (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n   ch = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n\nend if\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen check if ch is in the vowels.\n\nNow, the code uses:\n\nif (ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y') then\n\n   print *, \"YES\"\n\nelse\n\n   print *, \"NO\"\n\nend if\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
