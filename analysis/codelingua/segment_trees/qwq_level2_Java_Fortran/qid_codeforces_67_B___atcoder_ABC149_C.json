So that's correct. Then, after the while loop, we need to shift the elements in the aa array to make space for inserting a at position j.\n\nIn Java, the code is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1]",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_67_B. It reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers. It processes this array to create another array aa, and then outputs the elements of aa plus 1, separated by spaces. The main logic here is in the main() method. The second Java file, atcoder_ABC149_C, reads an integer x, checks if it's even (but not 2), then increments it to the next odd, and finds the next prime number starting from there. It outputs that prime.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input for the second. So the Fortran program must first read the input for the first part, process it, then use the result as input for the second part, and finally output the second's result.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? The first program's output is the input for the second. So the first program's output is a sequence of numbers (the aa array elements +1). The second program takes that as its input x. Wait, but the second program expects a single integer x. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a single integer x. So the first program's output must be a single integer, which is then the input to the second. Wait, but looking at the first Java program's output:\n\nIn the first program, after processing, it loops over the aa array and prints each element +1, separated by spaces. So the output is a list of numbers. But the second program expects a single integer x. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the first Java program again.\n\nWait, the first program's main loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) print(aa[i] + 1 + \" \");\nprintln();\n\nSo it's printing all elements of the array aa, each plus 1, separated by spaces. So the output is a list of numbers. But the second program expects a single integer x. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is a single number, but that's only possible if n is 1. Otherwise, the second program can't read it. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program reads x as the first integer from input. So perhaps the first program's output is a single integer, but that depends on the input. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a single number, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a single number, but in the code, it's printing all elements of the array. So maybe the problem's setup is that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program only reads the first integer from that output. Or maybe the first program's output is a single integer. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the problem's actual code again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's output is the array aa's elements each plus 1, space-separated. So the output is a list of numbers. The second program expects to read an integer x. So the second program would read the first number from that list. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a single number, but that's only possible if n is 1. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a single number, but the code is written to output multiple numbers. Wait, perhaps the second program is supposed to read all the numbers from the first's output and process them, but the second program's code only reads the first integer. That would be a problem. Wait, the second Java program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC149_C {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner stdIn = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int x = Integer.parseInt(stdIn.next());\n        if (x != 2 && x % 2 == 0) x++;\n        while (true) {\n            int i;\n            double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n            for (i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) {\n                if (x % i == 0) break;\n            }\n            if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n            x += 2;\n        }\n        System.out.println(x);\n    }\n}\n\nSo the second program reads the first integer from the input (the first token). So the first program's output must be a list of numbers, but the second program takes the first one as x. So the first program's output is a list, but the second only uses the first element. That's possible, but perhaps the problem's setup is that the first program's output is a single number, but the code is written to output multiple. Wait, maybe I need to check the first program's code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's main loop is:\n\nfor (int a = n - 1; a >=0; a--) {\n    ... some processing ...\n    then inserting a into aa at position j, and m increments.\n}\n\nThen, after processing all a's, it prints the aa array elements +1. So the output is the array aa's elements, each plus 1, in order. The array aa is built in a certain way. The problem is that the second program expects a single integer x, so the first program's output must be a single integer. Therefore, perhaps the first program's output is a single number, but the code is written to output multiple. That suggests that maybe the first program's output is a single number, but the code is written to output all elements. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the sum of the array elements, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is the first element of the array, but the code is written to output all elements. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's setup is that the first program's output is the input to the second program, but the second program only reads the first integer from that output. So the first program's output is a list of numbers, but the second program takes the first one as x. So in the Fortran program, the first part's output is a list, but the second part only uses the first element. Therefore, in the Fortran code, after processing the first part, we need to pass the first element of the output array to the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a single number. Let me see the code again. The first program's output is the array aa's elements each plus 1, space-separated. So if the array has n elements, the output is n numbers. The second program reads the first of those numbers as x. So the second program's input is the first number from the first program's output. Therefore, in the Fortran code, after processing the first part, we need to take the first element of the output array (the first number in the list) and pass it to the second part.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first part (n, k, and the array bb), process it to get the array aa, then take the first element of aa (plus 1?), then use that as the input x for the second part, process it, and output the result.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the array elements plus 1. So the first element of the output is (aa[0] +1). So the second program's x is that value. So in the Fortran code, after computing the aa array, we take the first element (aa(1) in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based?), add 1, then pass that to the second part.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the array aa is 0-based. The first element is aa[0], so when they print aa[i]+1, the first element is aa[0]+1. So the first number in the output is (aa[0]+1). So the second program's x is that first number.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n, k, and the array bb (size n).\n\n2. Process the array to compute the aa array as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n3. Take the first element of aa (aa(1) in Fortran, since arrays start at 1?), add 1, and use that as x for the second part.\n\n4. Then process x through the second Java program's logic.\n\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the array aa is built in a way that the first element (aa[0]) is the first one processed? Let me see the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's main loop:\n\nfor (int a = n - 1; a >=0; a--) { ... }\n\nSo a starts from n-1 down to 0. The code processes each a in reverse order. The aa array is being built by inserting a at position j, and shifting elements. The m variable is the current length of the array. So the first a processed is the last element (n-1), then n-2, etc. The aa array is being built in a way that the elements are stored in some order. The final array is printed in order from 0 to n-1, so the first element of the output is the first element of aa (aa[0] +1).\n\nTherefore, the first number in the output is (aa[0]+1). So the second program's x is that value.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after computing the aa array, the first element (aa(1) in Fortran, assuming 1-based) plus 1 is the x for the second part.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first part's logic:\n\nRead n, k, then n integers into an array bb (size n).\n\nInitialize an array aa of size n (but in Fortran, perhaps we can use dynamic arrays, but since n is known, we can allocate it).\n\nThe main loop is for a from n-1 downto 0 (Java's a starts at n-1 and goes down to 0). In Fortran, loops are from start to end, so we can do a loop from a = n-1 down to 0, but in Fortran indices start at 1, so perhaps we need to adjust variables.\n\nWait, in Java, the array indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays. So the bb array in Fortran will be of size n, with indices 1 to n. The a variable in the loop would go from n down to 1 (since in Java it's n-1 downto 0, so in Fortran terms, starting at n, decrementing to 1).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's a starts at n-1 (the last element of bb array), then goes down to 0 (the first element). So in Fortran, if the bb array is 1-based, then the equivalent would be a starting at n (since bb(1) is first element, bb(n) is last). So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo a = n, 1, -1\n\nThen, for each a (which is the index in the original Java's bb array), we process it.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint j = 0;\n\nwhile (bb[a] > 0) {\n\n   if (aa[j] >= a +k) then bb[a]--;\n\n   j++;\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, aa is an array of integers. Initially, it's all zeros, but as the loop proceeds, elements are added. The m variable starts at 0, and increments each time. Wait, in the Java code:\n\nint m =0;\n\nfor (a from n-1 downto 0) {\n\n   ... \n\n   for (j_ = m downto j+1) shift elements.\n\n   aa[j] = a;\n\n   m++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the m variable is the current length of the array. So initially, m is 0. After inserting a at position j, m becomes m+1. So the array aa is being built with m elements. The loop for inserting is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1]\n\nWait, in Java, the code is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ -1];\n\nWait, the m is incremented after the assignment. Wait, the code is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) ... \n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Let me parse that line again.\n\nThe line is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\nWait, the m is being incremented here. The initial value of j_ is m before the increment. Then m becomes m+1. So the loop starts at the current m (before increment), then m is increased by 1. The loop runs from j_ = m (original m) down to j+1, shifting elements to the right to make space for inserting a at position j.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is equivalent to:\n\nint temp = m;\n\nm++;\n\nfor (int j_ = temp; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1];\n\nThen, aa[j] = a;\n\nSo the array aa is being built by inserting a at position j, shifting elements from m-1 down to j+1 to the right. The m is the current length of the array. So after inserting, the length becomes m.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the array aa must be of size n, and we can track m as the current length. The initial m is 0. For each a, after finding j, we need to shift elements from m down to j+1 (since in Fortran, indices start at 1?), and then set aa(j) = a, then m increases by 1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so perhaps the indices need to be adjusted. Let me think through the variables.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n, k, then read n integers into bb(1:n).\n\nInitialize aa(1:n) to 0, and m =0.\n\nLoop over a from n down to 1 (since in Java it was n-1 downto 0, so in Fortran, a starts at n (Java's n-1 is the last element, which is bb(n) in Fortran's 1-based array), then down to 1 (Java's 0 is the first element, which is bb(1) in Fortran).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, the loop is for a from n-1 downto 0. So the first a is n-1 (the last element of the array), then n-2, etc. In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the equivalent indices would be from n downto 1. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo a = n, 1, -1\n\nInside this loop:\n\nInitialize j =0 (Java's j starts at 0). But in Fortran, perhaps we can use an integer variable j starting at 0, but arrays are 1-based. Wait, but in the code, the j is used as an index into the aa array. Since aa is 1-based, but in Java, the aa array is 0-based. So in Fortran, the j variable can be 0-based, but when accessing aa, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, the code has:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1];\n\nSo in Java, the aa array is 0-based. So when j is 0, the first element is aa[0].\n\nIn Fortran, the aa array is 1-based, so the equivalent would be:\n\nfor (j_ = m; j_ > j; j_--):\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, the variables can be handled as follows:\n\nInitialize m =0 (current length of aa array).\n\nInside the loop for a:\n\nj starts at 0 (Java's j=0).\n\nThen, while bb(a) >0:\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a +k) then bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n   j = j +1\n\nWait, but in Java, the aa array is 0-based, so in Fortran, the aa array is 1-based, so the indices need to be adjusted. Wait, but in the code, the condition is checking aa[j] (Java's 0-based) against a +k. So in Fortran, the aa array is 1-based, so the equivalent would be aa(j+1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat the variables as 0-based in Fortran as well, but use arrays starting at 0. But Fortran arrays can be declared with a lower bound of 0. So maybe that's better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the variables as 0-based in Fortran as well. So in Fortran, the arrays can be declared with a lower bound of 0. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: bb\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: aa\n\nThen, the loop over a would be from n-1 downto 0.\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based, so to have 0-based arrays, we need to specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust the code to use 1-based arrays, but that requires adjusting all indices.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, in the first part:\n\nRead n, k, then n integers into bb array (0-based in Java, so in Fortran, perhaps 0-based as well).\n\nInitialize aa array of size n (0-based), all zeros.\n\nm is initialized to 0 (the current length of the array).\n\nThen, for each a from n-1 downto 0 (Java's loop):\n\n   j starts at 0.\n\n   while bb(a) >0:\n\n      if (aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n          bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n      end if\n\n      j = j +1\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is:\n\nwhile (bb[a] >0) {\n\n   if (aa[j] >= a +k) then bb[a]--;\n\n   j++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition is checked first, then the body. So in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo while (bb(a) >0)\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n      bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n   end if\n\n   j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nBut in Java, the j is incremented each time, even if the condition is not met. So that's correct.\n\nThen, after the while loop, we need to shift the elements in the aa array to make space for inserting a at position j.\n\nIn Java, the code is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1]\n\nWait, the m is being incremented here. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe for loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) {\n\n   aa[j_] = aa[j_ -1]\n\n}\n\nWait, the initialization part is m++: so the initial value of j_ is m before the increment. Then m is increased by 1. The loop runs while j_ > j. So the loop starts at the current m (before increment), then m becomes m+1. The loop runs from j_ = m (original m) down to j+1, shifting each element to the right.\n\nWait, let's see with an example. Suppose m was 3 before the loop. Then j_ starts at 3, then m becomes 4. The loop runs while j_ > j. So if j is 2, then j_ starts at 3, which is >2, so the first iteration is j_=3, then j_=2 (since decrement by 1 each time). Wait, no, the loop is j_ starts at 3, then in the first iteration, j_=3, then j_ becomes 2, then check again. So the loop runs for j_=3 and j_=2 (if j is 1, for example).\n\nWait, the loop is for j_ from m (original m) down to j+1, because the condition is j_ > j. So the loop runs for j_ = m, m-1, ..., j+1.\n\nTherefore, the code is shifting the elements from m-1 down to j to the right by one position, making space for inserting a at position j.\n\nWait, but in the array aa, the current length is m (before the increment). So the elements from j to m-1 are shifted right by one, so that the new element can be placed at position j, and the length becomes m+1.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code would be:\n\ntemp = m\n\nm = m +1\n\ndo j_ = temp, j+1, -1\n\n   aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\nend do\n\nThen, set aa(j) = a.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if the array is 0-based, then the code would be similar. Alternatively, if using 1-based arrays, the indices would need adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use 0-based arrays in Fortran by declaring them with lower bound 0.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: n = ... (but n is read from input, so we need to read it first)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can be allocated dynamically. So perhaps:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nallocate(bb(0:n-1))\n\nallocate(aa(0:n-1))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum n is not known, but in the problem, the code must read n first, then allocate arrays accordingly.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, x, i, a, j, m, temp\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: bb, aa\n\n! Read first part's input\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(bb(0:n-1))\n\nallocate(aa(0:n-1))\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   read*, bb(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Initialize aa to 0, m=0\n\naa = 0\n\nm =0\n\n! Process the first part\n\ndo a = n-1, 0, -1\n\n   j =0\n\n   do while (bb(a) >0)\n\n      if (j < m .and. aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n         bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n      end if\n\n      j = j +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, shift elements from m down to j to the right\n\n   temp = m\n\n   m = m +1\n\n   do i = temp, j+1, -1\n\n      aa(i) = aa(i-1)\n\n   end do\n\n   aa(j) = a\n\nend do\n\n! Now, get the first element of aa (aa(0) +1) as x for the second part\n\nx = aa(0) +1\n\n! Now process the second part\n\n! Second part's logic:\n\n! Find the next prime after x (if x is even and not 2, start at x+1, else start at x)\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\n! Now, find the next prime starting from x, incrementing by 2 each time\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   ! Check if x is prime\n\n   if (x ==2) then\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\n   if (x <2) then\n\n      x =2\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\n   integer :: sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   logical :: is_prime = .true.\n\n   if (mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n      is_prime = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      do i=3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n         if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n            is_prime = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output the result\n\nprint*, x\n\ndeallocate(bb, aa)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but I need to check the logic for the second part again.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nThe second program reads x, then:\n\nif x is not 2 and even, then x becomes x+1.\n\nThen, in a loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(x), then check divisors from 3 to sqrt(x) step 2.\n\nIf any divisor is found, break and increment x by 2.\n\nElse, break and output x.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    int i;\n\n    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n    for (i =3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n        if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n    }\n\n    if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n    x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo the loop continues until the for loop completes without breaking (i exceeds sqrt(x)), then break and output x.\n\nIn Fortran, the code can be written as:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   i =3\n\n   do while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n      i =i +2\n\n   end do\n\n   if (i > sqrt_x) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the for loop starts at i=3, increments by 2 each time. The loop runs until i exceeds sqrtNum. If during the loop, a divisor is found (x mod i ==0), then break, and i is left at that value. Then, if i > sqrtNum, then the number is prime, so break the while loop. Else, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code can be written as:\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   sqrt_x = nint(sqrt(real(x)))  ! Or use int, but need to check.\n\n   ! Or compute sqrt_x as floor(sqrt(x))?\n\n   ! Let me see: in Java, sqrtNum is Math.sqrt(x), which is a double. The loop runs i up to sqrtNum.\n\n   ! So in Fortran, sqrt_x is the integer part of sqrt(x). Wait, but in code:\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   i =3\n\n   do while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n      i =i +2\n\n   end do\n\n   if (i > sqrt_x) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the for loop is:\n\nfor (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n   if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n}\n\nSo the loop increments i by 2 each time. So in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\ni =3\n\ndo while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n   if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\n   i =i +2\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code for the second part is as above.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut in the first part, after processing, the first element of aa (aa(0) in 0-based) plus 1 is x. So that's correct.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the output is the array aa's elements plus 1, so the first element is aa[0]+1. So in Fortran, since aa is 0-based, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nSuppose n=1, k=0, and bb has [5]. Then the first program's processing:\n\na starts at 0 (since n-1=0).\n\nj starts at 0.\n\nThe while loop runs while bb(0) >0 (5>0).\n\nInside the loop:\n\nCheck if aa[j] (aa[0] is 0 initially) >= a +k (0+0=0). So 0 >=0 \u2192 yes. So bb(0) becomes 4. j increments to 1.\n\nLoop again: bb(0)=4>0.\n\nCheck aa[1], which is 0 (since aa is initialized to 0, but m was 0, so aa(1) is beyond the current m? Wait, in the first iteration, m is 0. So when j is 1, which is beyond the current m (0), so the condition in the if statement (aa[j] >= ...) would be accessing uninitialized elements?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the aa array is initialized to all 0s. So even if j exceeds m, the array has 0s. So in the first iteration, when a=0 (the first a in the loop), m is 0. So when j is 1, the aa[j] is 0 (since the array is initialized to 0). So the condition is 0 >=0 \u2192 yes, so bb(0) decreases again.\n\nWait, but this could be an issue. Let me think through the first example.\n\nLet me take n=1, k=0, bb[0] =5.\n\nProcessing a=0 (since n-1=0):\n\nj starts at 0.\n\nThe while loop runs while bb(0) >0 (5>0).\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck aa[0] (0) >= 0+0 \u2192 yes. So bb(0) becomes 4. j becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration: bb(0)=4>0.\n\nCheck aa[1] (which is 0, since the array is initialized to 0). 0 >=0 \u2192 yes. bb(0) becomes 3. j=2.\n\nThird iteration: bb(0)=3>0.\n\nCheck aa[2] (0) >=0 \u2192 yes. bb(0)=2. j=3.\n\nFourth iteration: bb(0)=2>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck aa[3] (0) >=0 \u2192 yes. bb(0)=1. j=4.\n\nFifth iteration: bb(0)=1>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck aa[4] (0) >=0 \u2192 yes. bb(0)=0. j=5.\n\nNow, the while loop exits.\n\nThen, we need to shift elements from m (0) down to j+1 (5+1=6?), but m is 0, so temp =0, m becomes 1.\n\nWait, the code in the first part:\n\ntemp = m (0)\n\nm = m+1 \u2192 1.\n\nThen, the loop is from temp (0) down to j+1 (5+1=6). But 0 is less than 6, so the loop doesn't run. So the shifting loop does nothing.\n\nThen, set aa(j) =a \u2192 aa(5) =0.\n\nWait, but the array aa is of size n=1 (0-based, so indices 0). So when we try to set aa(5) =0, that's out of bounds. That's a problem.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The Java code's aa array is of size n, but in the first example, when n=1, the code is trying to set aa[5] =0, which is beyond the array's size. That would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java. But the original code must have some logic preventing that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the aa array is initialized as new int[n], so size n. The m variable is the current length of the array. The code for inserting a at position j:\n\nfor (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_-1];\n\nWait, the m is the current length before the increment. So when inserting, the new length is m+1. The code ensures that j is less than m (the original m) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the code ensures that j is always less than m before the insertion. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the code, after the while loop, j is the first index where aa[j] < a +k, or beyond the current array length.\n\nWait, the while loop runs until bb[a] becomes 0. The j increments each time, but the condition is checked each time. The loop continues until bb[a] is 0.\n\nWait, but in the example above, with n=1, k=0, and bb[0]=5, the while loop runs 5 times, each time decrementing bb[a] by 1 (since each time, the condition is met). So after 5 iterations, bb[a] is 0, and j is 5.\n\nThen, the code tries to insert a (0) at position j=5. But the current m is 0 (before the increment). So the code would need to shift from m (0) down to j+1 (6), but since m is 0, the loop doesn't run. Then, the code sets aa[5] =0, but the array is of size 1 (indices 0 to 0). So this is an error.\n\nThis suggests that the original Java code has a bug, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed such that j never exceeds m. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the m is the current length of the array. The code is inserting a at position j, so j must be <= m. Because when inserting, the new length becomes m+1, so the position j must be between 0 and m (inclusive). Otherwise, the shifting would not work.\n\nHmm, perhaps the while loop ensures that j does not exceed m?\n\nWait, the while loop runs until bb[a] becomes 0. The j increments each time, but the condition is checked each time. The loop continues until bb[a] is 0. But how does j relate to m?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed such that j can't exceed m. Because the aa array is initially filled with 0s, and the m is the current length. So when processing a new a, the j is incremented until it reaches m, and then the loop stops?\n\nWait, perhaps the while loop's condition is not just bb[a]>0, but also j < m?\n\nWait, looking back at the Java code:\n\nThe while loop is:\n\nwhile (bb[a] >0) {\n\n   if (aa[j] >= a +k) bb[a]--;\n\n   j++;\n\n}\n\nSo the j increments every time, regardless of whether the condition is met. So j can go beyond m.\n\nBut the aa array is initialized to 0, so when j exceeds m (the current length), the aa[j] is 0, which may or may not satisfy the condition.\n\nThis suggests that the code may have an off-by-one error, but perhaps in the problem's context, it's handled correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the example I thought of is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed such that the while loop will terminate before j exceeds m.\n\nWait, perhaps the aa array is being built in such a way that the elements are non-decreasing or something, so that the condition eventually holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the example I thought of is not possible because the problem's constraints ensure that the input is valid.\n\nBut regardless, in the Fortran code, we need to replicate the same logic, even if it has potential array out of bounds.\n\nIn the example I mentioned, the Fortran code would have an array aa of size 1 (0-based), so indices 0. When trying to set aa(5) =0, that's an error. So the code must be adjusted to prevent this.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the logic of the first part's code.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the aa array is initialized to size n. The m variable is the current length of the array. The code inserts a at position j, and shifts elements from m down to j+1. But the array's size is n, so as long as m +1 <=n, it's okay.\n\nWait, the code's first part's loop processes a from n-1 downto 0. The m starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time. So after processing all a's, m will be n. So the array is filled completely.\n\nIn the example where n=1, the loop runs once (a=0). The m starts at 0. After processing, m becomes 1. So the array has one element.\n\nBut in the example where bb[0] =5 and k=0:\n\nThe while loop runs 5 times, j reaches 5. Then, the code tries to insert at position j=5, but m was 0 before incrementing to 1. So the code would try to shift from m=0 down to j+1=6, which is beyond the array's size (since the array is size 1, indices 0).\n\nThis suggests that the code has a bug, but perhaps the problem's test cases don't hit this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the while loop's condition is not just bb[a]>0, but also j < m?\n\nWait, no, the code doesn't have that. The while loop runs as long as bb[a] is positive. The j increments each time, but the aa array's elements beyond m are 0, so the condition may still be true.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Perhaps the code is intended to have the while loop stop when j reaches m?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed such that when j reaches m, the condition is no longer met, so the loop stops.\n\nWait, let's think of the initial m=0. The first time processing a, m is 0. The j starts at 0. The first iteration of the while loop:\n\nCheck if aa[j] (aa[0] =0) >= a +k. Suppose a is 0, k=0 \u2192 0 >=0 \u2192 yes. So bb[a] decreases by 1. j becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: bb[a] is now 4. j=1.\n\nCheck aa[1], which is 0 (since the array is initialized to 0, but m is 0, so beyond the current length). So 0 >=0 \u2192 yes. bb[a] becomes 3. j=2.\n\nThis continues until j reaches m (0) + something?\n\nWait, this seems to be a problem. The code may have an off-by-one error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the while loop will eventually terminate because the bb[a] will reach zero.\n\nIn the example, after 5 iterations, bb[a] becomes 0, so the loop stops. Then, the code proceeds to insert at j=5, but the array is of size 1, so this is an error.\n\nThis suggests that the code has a bug, but perhaps the problem's test cases don't include such scenarios. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the while loop's condition ensures that j doesn't exceed m.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed such that the while loop will stop when j reaches m.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, m is the current length of the array. The aa array has elements up to m-1 (since it's 0-based). The while loop increments j until it reaches m, then the next iteration would check aa[j] (which is beyond the current array's length, but initialized to 0). But the condition may still be true.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should proceed with the code as per the original Java, even if there are potential issues, and see.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the arrays are allocated with size n, so when trying to access beyond that, it will be an error. So perhaps the code should have a check to ensure that j doesn't exceed m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the while loop will terminate before j exceeds m.\n\nWait, let's think of another example where n=2, k=1, and bb is [3, 2].\n\nProcessing a=1 (since n-1=1):\n\nInitial m=0.\n\nj starts at 0.\n\nbb[a] is 2.\n\nThe while loop runs while bb[a] >0 (2>0).\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck aa[0] (0) >= a +k \u2192 a is 1, k=1 \u2192 1+1=2. 0 >=2 \u2192 no. So bb[a] remains 2. j increments to 1.\n\nSecond iteration: j=1.\n\nCheck aa[1] (0) >=2 \u2192 no. So bb[a] remains 2. j=2.\n\nThird iteration: j=2.\n\nCheck aa[2] (0) >=2 \u2192 no. So bb[a] remains 2. j=3.\n\nThis continues until j reaches m (0) + something?\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should proceed with the code as per the original Java, and assume that the problem's test cases don't hit such edge cases.\n\nNow, back to the Fortran code.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the first part's code, the aa array is 0-based, so in the final output, the first element is aa(0)+1. So in the Fortran code, after processing, x is set to aa(0)+1.\n\nThen, the second part processes x as per the second Java program.\n\nNow, the second part's code in Fortran:\n\nThe code for the second part is as I wrote earlier.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must read n, k, then the array bb, process it to get aa, then take the first element of aa plus 1 as x, then process x through the second part's logic, and output the result.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nAllocate arrays bb and aa of size 0 to n-1.\n\nRead the n elements into bb.\n\nInitialize aa to 0, m=0.\n\nLoop a from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   j =0\n\n   while bb(a) >0:\n\n      if (j < m and aa(j) >= a +k) then \u2192 wait, in the Java code, there's no check for j < m. The code just accesses aa[j], which may be beyond the current m.\n\nBut in Fortran, accessing beyond the current m would be accessing uninitialized elements (but since the array is initialized to 0, it's okay).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the aa array is initialized to all 0s. So even if j exceeds m, the value is 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code can proceed as:\n\ndo while (bb(a) >0)\n\n   if (aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n      bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n   end if\n\n   j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, the shifting:\n\ntemp = m\n\nm = m +1\n\ndo i = temp, j+1, -1\n\n   aa(i) = aa(i-1)\n\nend do\n\naa(j) = a\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array indices are 0-based, so this should be okay.\n\nNow, after processing all a's, the first element of aa is aa(0), so x = aa(0)+1.\n\nThen, the second part's code.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nif x is even and not 2, then x +=1.\n\nThen, loop:\n\ncompute sqrt_x = int(sqrt(x)).\n\nCheck divisors from 3 to sqrt_x step 2.\n\nIf any divisor found, increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nElse, break and output x.\n\nNow, the code for the second part in Fortran:\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x =x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   i =3\n\n   do while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n      i =i +2\n\n   end do\n\n   if (i > sqrt_x) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint*, x\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, x, i, a, j, m, temp\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: bb, aa\n\n! Read first part's input\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(bb(0:n-1))\n\nallocate(aa(0:n-1))\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   read*, bb(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Initialize aa to 0, m=0\n\naa = 0\n\nm =0\n\n! Process the first part\n\ndo a = n-1, 0, -1\n\n   j =0\n\n   do while (bb(a) >0)\n\n      if (aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n         bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n      end if\n\n      j = j +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, shift elements from m down to j+1 to the right\n\n   temp = m\n\n   m = m +1\n\n   do i = temp, j+1, -1\n\n      aa(i) = aa(i-1)\n\n   end do\n\n   aa(j) = a\n\nend do\n\n! Get x from first element of aa plus 1\n\nx = aa(0) +1\n\n! Process second part\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x =x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   integer :: sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   i =3\n\n   do while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n      i =i +2\n\n   end do\n\n   if (i > sqrt_x) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output the result\n\nprint*, x\n\ndeallocate(bb, aa)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop, the variables sqrt_x and i are declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop. So I need to move their declarations outside.\n\nCorrecting that:\n\n! Process second part\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x =x +1\n\nend if\n\ninteger :: sqrt_x, i\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   i =3\n\n   do while (i <= sqrt_x)\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n      i =i +2\n\n   end do\n\n   if (i > sqrt_x) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x =x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the example where n=1, k=0, bb[0]=5.\n\nFirst part:\n\nAfter processing a=0 (n-1=0):\n\nThe while loop runs 5 times, j reaches 5.\n\nThen, temp = m (0), m becomes 1.\n\nThe loop for shifting runs from temp (0) down to j+1 (6), but since 0 <6, the loop doesn't execute.\n\nThen, set aa(5) =0. But the array aa is of size 0:0 (since n=1). So this is an out-of-bounds error.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The code will crash here.\n\nThis indicates that the original Java code has a bug, but perhaps the problem's test cases don't include such scenarios. Or perhaps I misunderstood the logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the while loop will stop before j exceeds m.\n\nWait, in the first iteration of the first part's loop (a=0):\n\nInitially, m=0.\n\nThe while loop runs until bb(a) becomes 0.\n\nEach iteration increments j by 1.\n\nThe condition is whether aa[j] >= a +k.\n\nInitially, aa is all zeros.\n\na is 0, k=0 \u2192 a+k=0.\n\nSo for j=0: aa[0] is 0 \u2192 0 >=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 bb(a) becomes 4.\n\nj becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: j=1. aa[1] is 0 (since the array is initialized to 0, but m is 0, so beyond the current array length). 0 >=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 bb(a) becomes 3.\n\nj=2.\n\nThis continues until bb(a) reaches 0 after 5 iterations.\n\nAt that point, j=5.\n\nThen, the code tries to insert at position j=5, but the array's size is 1 (0-based indices 0). So aa(5) is out of bounds.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the original Java code has a bug, but perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that such cases don't occur.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's shifting loop is supposed to shift from m (before increment) down to j+1, but if j exceeds m, then the shifting loop doesn't run, and the insertion is at position j, which is beyond the current array's length.\n\nBut in the Java code, the array is of size n, so inserting at position j would be allowed as long as j <n.\n\nWait, the array is initialized to size n, so even if j exceeds m, but is less than n, it's okay.\n\nIn the example, n=1, so j=5 exceeds n-1 (0), so the insertion is out of bounds.\n\nThis indicates that the code has a bug.\n\nBut since the problem requires translating the code as is, I'll proceed with the code as written, assuming that the problem's test cases don't hit this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the while loop will stop when j reaches m.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, m=0.\n\nThe while loop runs until bb(a) is 0.\n\nEach iteration increments j by 1.\n\nThe condition is whether aa[j] >= a +k.\n\nIn the first iteration (j=0):\n\naa[0] is 0, a+k=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 bb(a) decreases.\n\nj becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration (j=1):\n\naa[1] is 0 (initialized to 0), a+k=0 \u2192 yes \u2192 bb(a) decreases.\n\nj becomes 2.\n\nThis continues until j reaches m (0) + something?\n\nNo, m is 0 until after the loop.\n\nThe loop will continue until bb(a) reaches 0, which takes 5 steps.\n\nThus, the code has a bug.\n\nBut since the problem requires translating the code as given, I'll proceed with the code as written, and assume that the problem's test cases don't hit this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as above."
