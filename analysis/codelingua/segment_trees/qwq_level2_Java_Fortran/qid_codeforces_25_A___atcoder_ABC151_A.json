Wait, no, 9 is ASCII 57, adding 1 gives 58 which is ':', so output would be ':', but in the original Java code, if the first program outputs 9, then the second program's input is \"9\", so first character is '9', adding 1 gives '1' (since 57+1=58, which is ':'). So the output would be ':'. Wait, but in the second Java program, the code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1); So the char is cast to an int, added 1, then printed as a char.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's functionality.\n\nFirst Java file (codeforces_25_A):\n\nThis program reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It counts how many are even and odd, and keeps track of the last index where each occurred. Then, if there are more odds, it prints the even index, else the odd index. Wait, actually, the code checks if odd count is greater than even, then prints even_ind, which would be the position of the single even number if there's only one even. So the problem is to find the position of the unique even or odd number in the array.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n\nThis one reads a string, then outputs the first character incremented by 1. Wait, no, looking at the code: it reads a line, then prints the first character's next character. For example, if input is \"a\", output is \"b\". But since it's using charAt(0), which is the first character, then adding 1 to its ASCII value. So the output is the next character in the ASCII sequence.\n\nWait, but the second program's main is in a class named atcoder_ABC151_A. The code reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1 to it (as a char?), then prints it. So for input \"a\", output is \"b\", for \"z\" it's \"{\", etc. But maybe the input is a single character? The problem might be expecting that.\n\nNow, the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, where the output of the first is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the index number) is the input to the second program, which then takes that number as a string and increments its first character.\n\nWait, but the first program outputs a number (the index, which is 1-based). The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input to the second program. The second program reads that number as a string, takes the first character (the digit's ASCII code), adds 1, and outputs that.\n\nWait, for example, if the first program outputs 3, then the second program's input is \"3\", so the first character is '3' (ASCII 51), adding 1 gives 52 which is '4', so output is '4'.\n\nSo the overall process is: input to the first program is some data, which processes to an integer index, then that index is converted to a string, and the second program takes that string and outputs the next character of the first digit.\n\nNow, the task is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The first part (Java's first program) must read input, process to get the index, then pass that to the second part (Java's second program's logic) which takes that index (as a string) and outputs the next character of the first digit.\n\nBut in Fortran, we need to do this without any intermediate I/O. So the first part's output (the index) is not written to output, but instead passed as a variable to the second part's processing. The second part then takes that index (as a string?), processes it, and outputs the final result.\n\nWait, but in the original sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the combined Fortran program, the first part's result (the index) must be converted into a string, then the second part processes that string's first character.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read input (n and array) as per first Java program.\n\n2. Process the array to find the index (even_ind or odd_ind) as before.\n\n3. Convert that index to a string.\n\n4. Take the first character of that string, increment by 1, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as a line, so the entire input is the string representation of the index. The first character of that string is taken, so if the index is, say, 5, then the string is \"5\", so first character is '5', adding 1 gives '6'. If the index is 12, then the first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after computing the index (integer), we need to convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, then output that character.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_25_A):\n\nRead n, then n integers. Then count evens and odds, track their indices.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nn is an integer. The array is 1-based in Java, so in Fortran, we can use an array starting at 1. So declare array(1:n), but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default if declared with (/ ... /), but need to handle the input correctly.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array can be declared as an integer array with size n. But since n is read first, we need to read n first, then allocate the array. Alternatively, since in the first Java program, the array is size n+1, but indices 1 to n are used. So in Fortran, perhaps we can have an array of size n, with indices 1 to n.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is declared as new int[n+1], but the loop is from 1 to n, so the first element (index 0) is unused. So in Fortran, we can just have an array of size n, with indices 1 to n.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n integers into an array (let's say arr(1:n)).\n\nInitialize odd and even counts to 0, and their indices (odd_ind and even_ind) to 0.\n\nLoop over each element in arr:\n\nif arr(i) is even (mod(arr(i),2) == 0), increment even count and set even_ind to i.\n\nElse, increment odd count and set odd_ind to i.\n\nThen, determine which count is smaller (since the problem is to find the unique one). Wait, the code in Java does:\n\nif (odd > even) then print even_ind else print odd_ind.\n\nWait, because if there are more odds, then the even is the unique one, so its index is printed. So the condition is correct.\n\nSo after processing, the index to output is even_ind if odd count is higher, else odd_ind.\n\nSecond part (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n\nTake the index (integer) from first part, convert to string, take first character, add 1, output as a character.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: index_val = ... (the result from first part)\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: str_index\n\nwrite(str_index, '(I0)') index_val\n\nThen, the first character is str_index(1:1). But need to check if the string is properly formatted. Since the index could be up to, say, 1e9 (if n is big), but in Fortran, the length should be sufficient. Let's use a length of 20 to be safe.\n\nThen, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output.\n\nWait, in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nSo:\n\nchar_val = ichar(str_index(1:1)) + 1\n\nresult_char = char(char_val)\n\nThen print result_char.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n and the array.\n\n2. Process to find the index (even_ind or odd_ind).\n\n3. Convert that index to a string.\n\n4. Take first character, increment, output.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, arr(1:n) \u2014 but in Fortran, we can't have variable-length arrays in older versions. Wait, but assuming Fortran 90 or later, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90+, we can do:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(1:n))\n\nread(*,*) arr(1:n)\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThen, variables for counts and indices:\n\ninteger :: odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind\n\nInitialize them to 0.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to n:\n\nif mod(arr(i),2) == 0 then\n\n   even = even +1\n\n   even_ind = i\n\nelse\n\n   odd = odd +1\n\n   odd_ind = i\n\nend if\n\nThen, decide which index to take:\n\nif (odd > even) then\n\n   index_val = even_ind\n\nelse\n\n   index_val = odd_ind\n\nend if\n\nThen, convert index_val to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_index\n\nwrite(str_index, '(I0)') index_val\n\nThen, take the first character:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_char\n\nfirst_char = str_index(1:1)\n\nThen, compute the next character:\n\ninteger :: char_code\n\nchar_code = ichar(first_char) + 1\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: result_char\n\nresult_char = char(char_code)\n\nThen, print it:\n\nprint *, result_char\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the output is a single character, so in Fortran, using print *, will output it with a space or new line? Need to check.\n\nAlternatively, use write(*,'(A)') trim(adjustl(result_char)) \u2014 but maybe just print *, result_char is sufficient.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose the index is 0 (but in the first program, indices start at 1, so that can't happen). So the index is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: index is 10. The string is \"10\", first character is '1', so output '2'.\n\nAnother case: index is 9, output '10' \u2192 first character '9' \u2192 becomes '1' (9+1=10? Wait, no, 9 is ASCII 57, adding 1 gives 58 which is ':', so output would be ':', but in the original Java code, if the first program outputs 9, then the second program's input is \"9\", so first character is '9', adding 1 gives '1' (since 57+1=58, which is ':'). So the output would be ':'.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo the char is cast to an int, added 1, then printed as a char. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should do the same.\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nAlso, note that in the first Java program, the array is 1-based, which is okay in Fortran.\n\nNow, code:\n\nprogram combined\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind, index_val\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n  character(len=20) :: str_index\n  character(len=1) :: first_char, result_char\n  integer :: char_code\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(arr(1:n))\n  read(*,*) arr(1:n)\n\n  ! Initialize counters and indices\n  odd = 0\n  even = 0\n  odd_ind = 0\n  even_ind = 0\n\n  ! Process array\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (mod(arr(i),2) == 0) then\n        even = even + 1\n        even_ind = i\n     else\n        odd = odd + 1\n        odd_ind = i\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Determine which index to take\n  if (odd > even) then\n     index_val = even_ind\n  else\n     index_val = odd_ind\n  end if\n\n  ! Convert index to string\n  write(str_index, '(I0)') index_val\n\n  ! Get first character\n  first_char = str_index(1:1)\n\n  ! Compute next character\n  char_code = ichar(first_char) + 1\n  result_char = char(char_code)\n\n  ! Output\n  print '(A)', result_char\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the write statement for str_index, the format '(I0)' writes the integer with no leading spaces, so the string should start with the digits of the number. So the first character is correct.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThe array has two odds (1,3) and one even (2). So even count is 1, odd is 2. Since odd>even, output even_ind which is 2. Then the second program takes \"2\" \u2192 first char '2' \u2192 becomes '3'.\n\nSo the final output is '3'.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n4\n\n2 4 6 8 \u2192 all even. So even count 4, odd 0. Since even>odd, output odd_ind which is 0? Wait, no. Wait in the code, the initial even_ind and odd_ind are 0. Wait in the Java code, the first program's code:\n\nInitially, even and even_ind are 0. For each element, if even, then even_ind is set to i. So for all even elements, even_ind will be the last index where an even number was found. Since all are even, even_ind is 4. The counts are even=4, odd=0. So since odd < even, the code will print odd_ind, which is 0. Wait that can't be right.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the condition is if (odd > even) then print even_ind else print odd_ind. So in this case, odd is 0, even is 4. So since 0 <4, it will print odd_ind, which is 0. But that's an invalid index (since indices start at 1). Wait, but in the problem's context, the array is 1-based, so the code must have exactly one even or one odd. Because the problem is to find the unique even or odd. So in the case where all are even, then the unique is the one that's different? Wait no, if all are even, then there is no unique even or odd. Wait the problem must have exactly one even or one odd. So perhaps the input is such that there is exactly one even or one odd. So the code works under that assumption.\n\nBut in the code, if all are even, then even count is n, odd is 0. So the code will print odd_ind which is 0, which is invalid. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that there is exactly one even or one odd. So the code is correct under that assumption.\n\nIn the sample I made, if all are even, then the code would output 0, which would be a problem. But perhaps the problem's input ensures that there is exactly one differing element.\n\nAssuming that the input is valid, the code works.\n\nIn the Fortran code, in such a case, index_val would be 0, which when converted to a string would be \"0\", so first character '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps the input ensures that the index is at least 1. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n1\n\n5 \u2192 the array has one element, which is odd. So odd count is 1, even 0. Since odd>even, print even_ind (0). Again, same problem. But perhaps the problem's input ensures that there is exactly one even or one odd. So maybe the code is correct.\n\nBut in the problem's code, perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's requirements. So the Fortran code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran should handle all that.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n5\n\n1 3 5 7 8 \u2192 the even is 8 at index 5. So even count is 1, odd 4. Since even < odd, so print even_ind (5). Then the second program takes \"5\" \u2192 output '6'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check the code again for possible issues.\n\nIn Fortran, when writing to str_index, using '(I0)' ensures that leading zeros are not present. For example, if the index is 10, it writes \"10\", so first character is '1'.\n\nAnother point: the variables odd_ind and even_ind are initialized to 0. In the Java code, they start at 0, but in the loop, whenever an even or odd is found, they are set to i. So for all evens, even_ind will be the last index (since each even overwrites it). So in the case where all are even, even_ind is n, and odd_ind remains 0. So the code would output 0, which is invalid. But the problem's input must have exactly one differing element, so that case won't happen.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the same logic applies.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
