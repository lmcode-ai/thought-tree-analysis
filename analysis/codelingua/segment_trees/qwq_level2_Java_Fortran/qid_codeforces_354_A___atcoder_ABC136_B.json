    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a value. The second takes that output as input and processes it further to give the final result. But in Fortran, I have to combine them so that the first part's output is passed directly to the second part without using I/O in between. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does. \n\nThe first Java program (codeforces_354_A) takes N, L, R, QL, QR, followed by N integers. It calculates some minimum value based on those inputs. The steps are:\n\n1. Read N, L, R, QL, QR.\n2. Read N numbers into array W.\n3. Compute a prefix sum array sum.\n4. Iterate over firstR from 0 to N, compute candidate values, track the minimum.\n\nThe second program (atcoder_ABC136_B) takes an integer N, counts how many digits it has, then calculates some sum based on the number of digits. The steps are:\n\n1. Read N (which would be the min from the first program).\n2. Determine the number of digits in N.\n3. Loop over each digit count from 1 to the number of digits, adding certain values based on whether the digit count is odd or even.\n4. Output the total ans.\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to combine these into one program. The first part's output (min) is the input to the second part. But since they can't have intermediate I/O, I have to compute the first part's result, store it in a variable, then pass that variable to the second part's logic.\n\nSo the structure will be:\n\n- Read all the inputs for the first program (N, L, R, QL, QR, then N numbers).\n- Compute the min value as in the first Java program.\n- Then, take that min value and process it through the second Java program's logic (count digits, compute ans).\n- Finally, print the ans from the second part.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based. Need to adjust indices. Let me see:\n\nJava's W is 0-based (size N). The sum array is 0 to N (sum[0] = 0, sum[1] = W[0], etc.)\n\nIn Fortran, I can make W(1:N) and sum(0:N+1) but maybe better to use 1-based. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in Java, sum is initialized as new int[N+1], so sum[0] is 0, sum[1] = W[0], sum[2] = W[0]+W[1], etc. So in Fortran, perhaps sum(0:N) where sum(0) is 0, sum(1) is W(1), sum(2) is W(1)+W(2), etc. But Fortran arrays can't have 0 as a lower bound unless specified. So I'll need to declare sum(0:N) with a lower bound of 0. Alternatively, shift indices.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based arrays but adjust the indices. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, declare sum(0:N) as an array with lower bound 0. To do that, I can use:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N) :: sum\n\nBut the size N is read from input, so I need to read N first. So variables must be allocatable. Hmm, since N is the first input, perhaps:\n\nFirst, read N, L, R, QL, QR. Then read N integers into an array W. Then compute sum.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables can be declared after reading N, but since N is needed for array sizes, we need to read N first, then allocate arrays.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\nRead N, L, R, QL, QR.\n\nRead N integers into W array (size N).\n\nCompute sum array (size N+1, 0-based). So sum(0) =0, sum(1) = W(1), sum(2)=sum(1)+W(2), etc.\n\nThen loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). For each firstR:\n\nlCount = firstR (since in Java, firstR is the number of elements on the left? Wait, in Java code:\n\nfirstR is from 0 to N. lCount is firstR (number of left elements?), then rCount = N - lCount.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nlCount = firstR (so the number of elements on the left is firstR?), then rCount = N - lCount.\n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nfor (int firstR = 0; firstR <= N; firstR++) {\n\n    int lCount = firstR;\n\n    int rCount = N - lCount;\n\nSo lCount is the number of elements on the left, rCount on the right.\n\nThen, the candidate is sum[lCount] * L + (sum[N] - sum[lCount]) * R.\n\nThen, llCount is max(0, lCount - rCount -1), and rrCount is max(0, rCount - lCount -1).\n\nAdding those multiplied by QL and QR.\n\nThe minimum of all these candidates is the result.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). For each iteration:\n\nlCount = firstR\n\nrCount = N - lCount\n\ncand = sum(lCount) * L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount)) * R\n\nllCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nrrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\ncand = cand + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\nCompare to min.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the sum array is 0-based. So sum(0) is 0, sum(1) is W(1), etc. So when lCount is firstR (which can be 0 to N), sum(lCount) is sum(firstR).\n\nWait, in Java, sum is 0-based, so yes.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem: the second Java program takes the min value from the first and processes it.\n\nThe second Java program's logic:\n\nRead N (the min from first part).\n\nCount the number of digits in N (temp = N, count until temp becomes 0).\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to count (number of digits). For each i:\n\nif i is the last digit count (i == count):\n\n   if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1) to ans.\n\nElse:\n\n   if i is 1, add 9.\n\n   else if i is odd, add 10^i - 10^(i-1).\n\nWait, let me recheck the code:\n\nIn the second Java program:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {\n\n    if (i == count) {\n\n        if (i % 2 ==1) {\n\n            ans += (N - Math.pow(10, i-1) +1);\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (i ==1) {\n\n            ans +=9;\n\n        } else if (i%2 ==1) {\n\n            ans += (Math.pow(10,i) - Math.pow(10,i-1));\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, for i from 1 to count:\n\n- For i less than count:\n\n   if i is 1: add 9 (since numbers from 1-9, which are 1-digit and odd count (1 is odd))\n\n   else if i is odd: add 10^i - 10^{i-1} (since numbers from 10^{i-1} to 10^i -1, which is 9*10^{i-1} numbers, but only if the digit count is odd. So for example, 3-digit numbers (i=3) would contribute 900 numbers (from 100 to 999), but only if i is odd.\n\nWait, the code adds for i even? Wait, the code says for i not equal to count, and if i is odd, then add that term. So for even i, it's not added except when i is 1 (but i=1 is odd).\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each digit count i (from 1 to the number of digits in N):\n\n- If it's the last digit count (i=count):\n\n   if the digit count is odd, then add the numbers from 10^{i-1} to N (since N has exactly i digits). So the count is N - 10^{i-1} +1.\n\n- Else (i is not the last):\n\n   if i is 1: add 9 (numbers 1-9)\n\n   else if i is odd: add 10^i - 10^{i-1} (the total numbers with exactly i digits, which is 9*10^{i-1})\n\n   else (even i): do nothing?\n\nWait, the code's else clause (when i is not the last) has:\n\nif (i ==1) add 9.\n\nelse if (i%2 ==1) add 10^i - 10^{i-1}\n\nso for even i (other than 1?), nothing is added except when i is even and not the last?\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i from 1 to count:\n\n   if i is the last digit count (count):\n\n      if i is odd, add (N - 10^{i-1} +1)\n\n   else:\n\n      if i is 1: add 9\n\n      else if i is odd: add 10^i - 10^{i-1}\n\n      else: (even i not last) do nothing?\n\nSo for even i (other than 1) that are not the last, they contribute nothing.\n\nSo the total ans is the sum over all digit counts except the last, for odd digit counts (except 1?), plus the last term if it's odd.\n\nWait, the code's logic is to count the number of numbers with an odd number of digits up to N. Because the problem (from the second Java code's problem) is probably counting numbers with an odd number of digits from 1 to N. So the code is calculating how many numbers from 1 to N have an odd number of digits.\n\nWait, the problem for the second code is likely \"count the number of integers from 1 to N that have an odd number of digits\".\n\nSo the code's approach is:\n\nFor each possible digit count i (from 1 to the number of digits in N):\n\n- For digit counts less than the total digits:\n\n   if i is odd, add all numbers with exactly i digits (since they have an odd count of digits).\n\n   except for i=1, which is 9 numbers (1-9).\n\n   For i=3, it's 900 (100-999), etc.\n\n- For the last digit count (the digit count of N):\n\n   if it's odd, then add the numbers from 10^{i-1} up to N. Because those numbers have exactly i digits (which is odd).\n\nSo the code is correct for that problem.\n\nNow, in Fortran, I need to compute this ans given the min value from the first part.\n\nSo the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nTake the min value (call it input_N).\n\nCompute the number of digits in input_N (count).\n\nInitialize ans=0.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to count:\n\n   if i == count:\n\n      if mod(i,2) ==1 then:\n\n          temp = input_N - 10**(i-1) +1\n\n          ans = ans + temp\n\n   else:\n\n      if i ==1 then:\n\n          ans = ans +9\n\n      else if mod(i,2) ==1 then:\n\n          term = 10**i - 10**(i-1)\n\n          ans = ans + term\n\nSo that's the logic.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nRead all the inputs for the first part (N, L, R, QL, QR, then N numbers).\n\nCompute the min value as per first Java code.\n\nThen compute the ans using the second part's logic.\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read N, L, R, QL, QR first. Then read N integers into an array.\n\nIn Fortran, since N is variable, we can read it first, then allocate arrays.\n\nBut in Fortran 90, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\ninteger, allocatable :: W(:), sum(:)\n\ninteger :: i, firstR, lCount, rCount, temp_count, count_digits\n\ninteger(8) :: min_val, cand, llCount, rrCount, ans\n\n! Read first part's inputs\n\nread*, N, L, R, QL, QR\n\nallocate(W(N))\n\nread*, W(1:N)\n\n! Compute sum array (0-based)\n\nallocate(sum(0:N))\n\nsum(0) = 0\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n    sum(i) = sum(i-1) + W(i)\n\nend do\n\n! Compute min_val\n\nmin_val = huge(min_val)  ! Initialize to max value\n\ndo firstR=0,N\n\n    lCount = firstR\n\n    rCount = N - lCount\n\n    cand = sum(lCount)*L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount))*R\n\n    llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\n    rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n    cand = cand + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\n    if (cand < min_val) then\n\n        min_val = cand\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now process the second part using min_val as input_N\n\ninteger(8) :: input_N = min_val\n\n! Compute number of digits in input_N\n\ncount_digits = 0\n\ntemp_count = input_N\n\ndo while (temp_count >0)\n\n    count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n    temp_count = temp_count /10\n\nend do\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, count_digits\n\n    if (i == count_digits) then\n\n        if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (input_N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        if (i ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans +9\n\n        else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n            ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\ndeallocate(W, sum)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but need to check data types. The first part's min_val can be a large number, so using integer(8) is okay. The second part's input_N is min_val, which is integer(8). The ans is also integer(8).\n\nWait, in the second Java code, the ans is an integer, but with N up to 1e9 (since first part's input could be large?), but in the second code, the ans can be up to (for N=1e9, which has 9 digits, the ans would be sum of all odd digit counts up to 9 digits. Let's see:\n\nFor N=999999999 (9 digits):\n\ncount_digits=9.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 9:\n\ni=1: add 9 (since i=1 is first and not last (count_digits=9, so i=1 is not last)\n\ni=2: even, so nothing.\n\ni=3: odd, add 10^3 -10^2 = 900.\n\ni=4: even, nothing.\n\ni=5: add 10^5 -10^4 = 90000.\n\ni=6: even.\n\ni=7: add 10^7 -1e6 = 9e6.\n\ni=8: even.\n\ni=9 (last, which is odd):\n\nadd (999999999 - 1e8 +1) = 999999999 -100000000 +1 = 900,000,000.\n\nTotal ans would be 9 + 900 + 90000 + 9000000 + 900000000 = which is manageable in integer(8).\n\nSo using integer(8) is okay.\n\nNow, in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. But 10**i for i up to 9 is okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, 10**i is an integer, but if i is large, but since count_digits is up to, say, 18 (if N is up to 1e18?), but in the first part's min_val could be up to (sum of N elements each up to, say, 1e9, so sum could be up to 1e14, so 10^18 is possible? Well, but in the second code's problem, the input N is the min_val from first part, which could be very large. But in the code, when calculating 10^(i-1), for i up to the number of digits of N, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, 10**i is okay as integer(8) as long as 10^i doesn't exceed 2^63-1. For i up to 19, 10^19 is about 1e19 which is over 2^60 (2^60 is ~1e18). So for i=19, 10^19 is 1e19 which is over 2^63 (which is ~9e18). So for N up to 1e19, the code would have an overflow. But perhaps the problem constraints are such that it's okay. Since the original Java code uses int for N in the second program, but in the first program, the min could be a long. Wait, the first Java program's min is a long, so the second program's N is a long, but in the code, the second Java program reads it as an int, which would cause overflow if the min is larger than 2^31-1. But the problem probably ensures that the input to the second program is within int's range. So in Fortran, using integer(8) is safe.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The sum array in Fortran is 0-based. So when firstR is 0, sum(0) is 0, which is correct.\n\n- The loop over firstR from 0 to N inclusive. In Fortran, the loop is do firstR=0,N, which is correct.\n\n- The max function: in Fortran, there is a max function, but for integers. So max(0, ...) is okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nllCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nSimilarly for rrCount.\n\nYes, in Fortran, the max function can take two integers.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSample input for first Java program:\n\nSuppose N=1, L=1, R=2, QL=3, QR=4, and W[0]=5.\n\nThen sum[0]=0, sum[1]=5.\n\nLoop firstR from 0 to 1:\n\nFirstR=0:\n\nlCount=0, rCount=1.\n\ncand = 0*1 + (5-0)*2 = 10.\n\nllCount = max(0, 0-1-1)=max(0,-2)=0.\n\nrrCount = max(0,1-0-1)=0. So total cand is 10+0+0=10.\n\nFirstR=1:\n\nlCount=1, rCount=0.\n\ncand =5*1 + (5-5)*2 =5.\n\nllCount = max(0,1-0-1)=0.\n\nrrCount = max(0,0-1-1)=max(0,-2)=0. So cand is 5.\n\nSo min is 5.\n\nThen the second part takes 5 as input.\n\nSecond part's processing:\n\nN=5 has 1 digit.\n\ncount_digits=1.\n\nLoop i=1 to 1:\n\ni=1 is the last digit count (count_digits=1).\n\nSince i is odd, add (5 -10^0 +1) =5-1+1=5.\n\nSo ans=5.\n\nWhich is correct because numbers from 1-5 all have 1 digit (odd), so total 5.\n\nAnother test case for second part:\n\nN= 100 (3 digits).\n\ncount_digits=3.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 3:\n\ni=1 (not last):\n\ni is 1 (odd), add 9.\n\ni=2 (not last, even, so nothing.\n\ni=3 (last, odd):\n\nadd (100 - 100 (10^2) +1? Wait 10^(3-1)=100. So 100 -100 +1 =1.\n\nWait 100 has exactly 3 digits. So numbers from 100 to 100: 1 number.\n\nTotal ans: 9 (from i=1) + (10^3 -10^2) for i=2? Wait no, i=2 is even, so not added. Wait, for i=2, which is even and not last, so nothing. Then i=3 is last and odd, so add 1. So total ans is 9+1=10.\n\nWait but numbers with odd digits up to 100:\n\nNumbers with 1 digit (1-9: 9 numbers), 3 digits (100: 1 number). Total 10. Correct.\n\nAnother test case for first part:\n\nN=2, L=1, R=1, QL=0, QR=0, W = [3,4].\n\nsum[0]=0, sum[1]=3, sum[2]=7.\n\nLoop firstR from 0 to 2:\n\nfirstR=0:\n\nlCount=0, rCount=2.\n\ncand =0*1 +7*1 =7.\n\nllCount =0-2-1 = -3 \u2192 0.\n\nrrCount =2-0-1=1 \u2192 max(0,1)=1 \u2192 rrCount=1? Wait no:\n\nWait, rCount - lCount -1 \u2192 2-0-1 =1 \u2192 so rrCount is max(0,1)=1.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nllCount = Math.max(0, lCount - rCount -1);\n\nSo for firstR=0, lCount=0, rCount=2:\n\nllCount = 0-2-1 = -3 \u2192 max(0, -3) \u2192 0.\n\nrrCount = 2-0-1 =1 \u2192 max(0,1)=1.\n\nSo cand += 0*QL (0) + 1*QR (0? since QR is 0 here). So total cand is 7 +0 +0 =7.\n\nfirstR=1:\n\nlCount=1, rCount=1.\n\ncand =3*1 + (7-3)*1 =3+4=7.\n\nllCount =1-1-1 =-1 \u2192 0.\n\nrrCount =1-1-1 =-1 \u21920. So total 7.\n\nfirstR=2:\n\nlCount=2, rCount=0.\n\ncand =7*1 +0 \u21927.\n\nllCount =2-0-1 =1 \u2192 max(0,1)=1.\n\nrrCount =0-2-1 =-3 \u21920.\n\nSo cand +=1*0 (QL is 0) +0 \u21927.\n\nSo all candidates are 7, so min is 7.\n\nThen second part with N=7 (1 digit):\n\nans is 7 (since 7-10^0 +1 =7-1+1=7, plus nothing else. So total 7.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, the variables:\n\nWait, in the first part, the variables lCount and rCount are integers, but in Fortran, they can be declared as integers.\n\nThe min_val is initialized to the maximum integer(8) value. In Fortran, the intrinsic function huge() gives the maximum value for the type. So initializing min_val = huge(0_8) (since it's integer(8)).\n\nWait, in the code above, I have:\n\ninteger(8) :: min_val, cand, llCount, rrCount, ans\n\nmin_val = huge(min_val)\n\nBut huge(min_val) would give the maximum value for integer(8). So that's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, when calculating 10^(i-1), in Fortran, 10 is an integer, so 10**(i-1) is okay as integer(8). But for large exponents, but since i is up to the number of digits of N (which is up to, say, 18 digits), 10^17 is manageable in integer(8) (since 1e18 is 10^18, which is 1e18, which is 1000000000000000000, which is less than 2^63 (which is ~9e18). So 10^18 would be over, but if N has 18 digits, then the exponent in the last term would be 10^(17), which is okay.\n\nWait, for N with 18 digits, the last term is 10^(17), which is 1e17, which is okay in integer(8).\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should look like this."
