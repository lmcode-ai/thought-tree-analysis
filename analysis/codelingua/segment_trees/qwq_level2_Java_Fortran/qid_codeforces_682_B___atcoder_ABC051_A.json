    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_682_B) reads an integer n, then n integers into a list, sorts them, and calculates a value c. The logic is that c starts at 1, and for each element in the sorted list, if the element is >= c, then c increments. The final c is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC051_A) reads a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs the result.\n\nWait, but the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output (the c value) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input, which would be the number from the first program. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so when passed to the second program, it would be a string like \"5\" (if c was 5), and then the second program would replace any commas in that string with spaces. But numbers don't have commas, so the output would be the same as the input. Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact flow.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a line, which would be that number as a string. Since there are no commas, the output would be the same number. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But maybe the second program is expecting a string with commas, but in this case, the first program's output is a number without commas, so the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the overall effect is that the final output is the same as the first program's output. But maybe I need to follow the exact steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program is supposed to process the output of the first. Let me think again. The first program's output is an integer, say 5. The second program reads that as a string, which would be \"5\", then replaces commas with spaces. Since there are no commas, the output is \"5\". So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But maybe the second program is part of the chain, so the Fortran program must process the first's output through the second's logic.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the n and list of numbers), then compute c as in the first Java program, then take that c as the input to the second Java program's processing (i.e., treat it as a string, replace commas with spaces), and output that result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (n and the list of integers) from stdin.\n2. Compute c as per the first Java program's logic.\n3. Take the string representation of c, replace any commas with spaces, and output that string.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string (the line read from input). The first program's output is a number, so when passed to the second program, it's the string representation of that number. Since numbers don't have commas, the second program's output is the same as the first's output. So the final output is just the c value from the first program. But maybe the second program is part of the chain, so even if it doesn't change the output, the Fortran program must still process it through that step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (n and list) as the first Java program does.\n- Process the list to compute c.\n- Then, take the string of c, replace commas with spaces (even though there are none), and output that string.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read n and the list of integers.\n2. Sort the list.\n3. Compute c as per the first Java's logic.\n4. Convert c to a string.\n5. Replace any commas in that string with spaces.\n6. Print the resulting string.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling input. The first Java program reads n followed by n integers. In Fortran, we can read them using a read statement. Let's see:\n\nWe can read n first, then an array of size n. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger, allocatable :: list(:)\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(list(n))\nread(*,*) list\n\nThen, sort the list. Fortran has the Mergesort or other sorting functions. The intrinsic function is to use the sort subroutine. So:\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort is in the intrinsic module. Wait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can use the intrinsic function. Wait, the syntax is:\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the list is an array. So that's okay.\n\nThen, compute c. Initialize c to 1. Then loop through each element in the sorted list. For each element, if list(i) >= c, then c increments.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but when we read with allocate(list(n)), the indices are 1-based. So the loop would be:\n\ninteger :: c = 1, i\ndo i = 1, n\n   if (list(i) >= c) then\n      c = c + 1\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is from 0 to n-1 (since it's for (int i=0; i <n; i++)), but the list is 0-based in Java. However, in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the loop from 1 to n is correct.\n\nOnce c is computed, then we need to process it through the second Java program's logic. The second program takes a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it.\n\nSo, the string to process is the string representation of c. So in Fortran, we can convert c to a string, then replace commas with spaces.\n\nHow to do that in Fortran?\n\nFirst, converting an integer to a string. We can use write with an internal file or a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: c_str\nwrite(c_str, '(i0)') c\nc_str = adjustl(c_str)  ! To remove leading spaces\n\nThen, we need to replace any commas in c_str with spaces. But since c is an integer, its string representation won't have commas. However, the second program's code is to replace commas with spaces, so even if there are none, we have to do that step.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to replace commas with spaces in a string?\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string and check if it's a comma, then replace it with a space.\n\nAlternatively, use the Fortran intrinsic function replace.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2003 and later, there is the 'replace' function. But maybe the user expects a solution that uses standard features without relying on newer versions. Alternatively, we can do it manually.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'scan' function to find commas and replace them.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: processed_str\nprocessed_str = c_str\ninteger :: pos = 1\ndo while (pos <= len_trim(processed_str))\n   pos = index(processed_str, ',', back=.false.)\n   if (pos == 0) exit\n   processed_str(pos:pos) = ' '\nend do\n\nWait, but the index function in Fortran returns the position of the first occurrence. So:\n\nWe can loop through the string, find each comma, replace it with a space. But perhaps a better way is to loop through each character:\n\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp_str\ntemp_str = c_str\ndo i = 1, len_trim(temp_str)\n   if (temp_str(i:i) == ',') then\n      temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n   end if\nend do\nprocessed_str = temp_str\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nOnce that's done, we can print the processed_str.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n and list.\n\nSort list.\n\nCompute c.\n\nConvert c to string.\n\nReplace commas with spaces.\n\nPrint the resulting string.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, c, i\n  integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n  character(len=20) :: c_str, processed_str\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(list(n))\n  read(*,*) list\n\n  ! Sort the list\n  call sort(list)\n\n  ! Compute c\n  c = 1\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (list(i) >= c) then\n        c = c + 1\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert c to string\n  write(c_str, '(i0)') c\n  c_str = adjustl(c_str)  ! Remove leading spaces\n\n  ! Replace commas with spaces\n  processed_str = c_str\n  do i = 1, len_trim(processed_str)\n     if (processed_str(i:i) == ',') then\n        processed_str(i:i) = ' '\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the processed string\n  print '(A)', trim(processed_str)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable with a format like '(i0)', the result may have leading spaces. Using adjustl would move the non-blank characters to the left, so that leading spaces are removed. However, the actual commas are in the string, but since c is an integer, the string won't have commas. So the replace step is redundant here, but the problem requires following the second Java program's logic exactly, even if it does nothing here.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is the output of the first, which is a number. So the input to the second program is a string like \"123\", which has no commas, so the output is the same. So the Fortran code's replace step is necessary to replicate the second program's processing, even if it does nothing here.\n\nTherefore, the code above should be correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write an integer to a character variable with '(i0)', it should not include commas. So the processed_str will be the same as c_str. But the code still does the replacement, which is correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose the first program outputs 5. The second program's input is \"5\", so after replacement, it's still \"5\". The Fortran code would output \"5\".\n\nAnother example: if the first program's output was 1000 (assuming the input list caused that), then the string is \"1000\", no commas, so output is same.\n\nWait, but in some locales, numbers might be written with commas as thousand separators, but in Fortran's '(i0)' format, it won't include commas. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should work as required.\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\n- The list is sorted in ascending order. The sort in Fortran's intrinsic sort is ascending, which matches the Java's Collections.sort (which is natural order, ascending).\n\n- The loop for c: in Java, the list is sorted, and for each element in order, if element >= c, then c increases. The Fortran code does the same.\n\n- The replacement of commas with spaces is done correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: the length of the character variables. The c_str is 20, which should be enough for typical integer outputs. If the number is extremely large (like 1e9, which is 10 digits), 20 is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
