So new_str is \"5\" (from first digit) + \"7\" (second digit) + \"3\" (third digit) \u2192 \"573\". Reversing gives \"375\". So next_i is 375. Now, 375 is <= 373? No, so the loop stops. So c is 1.\n\nHmm, but the next_i after 357 is 373, which is larger than 357 but less than 373? No, 373 is the next i. So if N is 373, then the loop runs for i=357 (counted) and i=373 (not counted, since it doesn't have all three digits). So c is 1.\n\nAnother test case where N is 533 (the example earlier):\n\ni=357 \u2192 counted (c=1), next is 373 (not counted), next is 375 (check if contains 3,5,7? 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 2. Then next_i(375):\n\nProcessing 375 \u2192 \"375\".",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC171_E). It reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It computes the XOR of all elements into r. Then, for each element a[i], it prints r XOR a[i], separated by spaces. So the output of this first program is a list of numbers, each being the XOR of r and the original a[i]. The next program (atcoder_ABC114_C) takes that output as input and processes it.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C) seems a bit more complex. Let me parse it step by step. It reads N, then starts with i=357. It counts how many numbers up to N are \"357\" numbers (contain at least one 3, 5, and 7). But wait, the code's loop is a bit different. Wait, the loop is while i <= N. The initial i is 357, and then it generates the next i in some way. The code also has a part where it manipulates the digits of i to form the next number. Let me see:\n\nThe code checks if the current i (as a string) contains '3', '5', and '7'. If so, it increments the count. Then, it builds a new number by processing the digits. The way it builds the next i is a bit tricky. The code uses a StringBuilder to process each digit from the end. The logic is:\n\n- For each digit in reverse order (starting from the last digit), if 'f' is false (meaning we haven't started modifying yet), then:\n   - If the current digit is '3', replace it with '5', set f to true.\n   - If it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n   - Else, leave as '3' (so any other digit becomes 3? Wait, no, the code says \"else append '3'\". Wait, the code says:\n\nIn the loop over the characters of s (the string of i), for each character (starting from the end, since it's reversed?), the code checks if f is false. The first character (from the end) that is not part of the 'f' condition? Hmm, maybe I need to re-express this.\n\nWait, the code is building the next i as follows:\n\nThe string s is the current i as a string. Then, the code processes each character in reverse order (since the loop is from 0 to s.length()-1, but the index is s.length()-1 -j, so j=0 gives the last character, j=1 gives the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the digits from the end to the beginning.\n\nWait, the loop is for j from 0 to s.length()-1, and the character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0, it's the last character, j=1 is the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the digits from the end towards the start.\n\nThe code builds a new string (sb) by processing each digit. The 'f' flag is initially false. For each digit (starting from the end):\n\n- If f is false (meaning we haven't made any changes yet), then:\n   - If the current digit is '3', replace it with '5', set f to true.\n   - If it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n   - Else, replace with '3', and since f was false, now set f to true? Wait, no. Wait, the code says:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') {\n    sb.append('5');\n    f = true;\n} else if (a == '5') {\n    sb.append('7');\n    f = true;\n} else {\n    sb.append('3');\n}\n\nWait, in the else case (when a is not 3 or 5), then it appends '3', but does it set f to true? The code only sets f to true in the first two cases. So in the else case, after appending '3', f remains false. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, but the code is processing digits from the end. Let me think.\n\nWait, the code is trying to generate the next number in some sequence. The way it's building the next i is by incrementing the number in a way similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7. The algorithm is similar to generating all numbers that consist of 3,5,7 digits, in order. So the next number is generated by incrementing the last possible digit, carrying over if needed. For example, 357 would go to 358? Wait, no, maybe the next number is 358? Wait, perhaps the code is generating numbers in the sequence of 357, 358 (but 8 isn't allowed?), maybe I need to see the code's logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating all numbers made up of 3,5,7 digits, in order. The way the code builds the next i is by taking the current number's digits, and incrementing the rightmost digit that can be increased, similar to counting in base 3 but with digits 3,5,7. For example, starting at 357, the next would be 358? But 8 isn't allowed. Wait, perhaps the code is treating the digits as 3,5,7, so each digit can be 3,5, or7, and the next number is generated by incrementing the last digit, and if it overflows, carry over to the next digit. So for example, 357 would become 358? But 8 isn't allowed. Hmm, maybe the code is using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic for generating the next number is as follows:\n\nThe current number is i. To get the next number, process each digit from the end (rightmost) to the left. For each digit:\n\n- If we haven't started modifying yet (f is false), then:\n\n   - If the digit is '3', change it to '5', set f to true (so we stop processing further digits to the left).\n\n   - If it's '5', change to '7', set f to true.\n\n   - If it's '7', then we can't increment it, so we need to carry over. So we change it to '3', and continue to the next digit (since f remains false? Wait, in the else clause (when a is not 3 or 5, which would be 7?), then the code appends '3', but does not set f to true. Wait, in the code's else clause, when a is not 3 or 5 (so a is 7?), then the code appends '3', and f remains false. So in that case, the loop continues to the next digit (the next digit to the left). \n\nWait, let's take an example. Let's say the current number is 357. The string s is \"357\". The loop processes each character from the end (so first '7', then '5', then '3').\n\nProcessing the first character (j=0, which is the last character of s, which is '7'):\n\nSince f is false, we check a = '7'. Since it's not 3 or 5, we append '3' to sb, and f remains false. Then, move to the next character (j=1, which is '5').\n\nNow, since f is still false, process '5'. Since it's 5, we replace it with '7', set f to true. Then, the remaining digits (the first character '3') are processed with f now true, so they are just appended as is. \n\nWait, the code's loop for the digits:\n\nWait, the code is building the new string by processing each character in reverse order (from the end to the start). Let me see:\n\nThe original string is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (so first '7', then '5', then '3').\n\nFor the first character (7):\n\n- f is false. Since a is 7 (not 3 or 5), we append '3', and f remains false.\n\nThen, next character (5):\n\n- f is still false. a is 5, so we append '7', set f to true.\n\nNext character (3):\n\n- f is now true, so we just append the original '3'.\n\nSo the sb after processing is '3' (from first step) + '7' (second step) + '3' (third step) \u2192 \"373\"? Wait, no, the order is reversed. Wait, the code is building the new string by appending in the order of processing the reversed digits. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code is building the new string as follows:\n\nThe loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1. For each j, the character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for the first iteration (j=0), it's the last character of s (the rightmost digit). The code appends to sb in the order of processing these characters. So the first character processed (the last digit of the original number) is the first character in the new string? Or is it building the new string in reverse?\n\nWait, the code is building the new string by processing the digits from the end (rightmost) to the start (leftmost). For each digit, it appends to sb in the order of processing. So the first digit processed (the rightmost) is the first character in the new string. Wait, no, because the code is building the new string by appending each processed character in the order of processing. So for example, if the original number is 357 (digits 3,5,7), the processing order is 7,5,3. The first character (7) is processed first, so the first character in the new string is the modified version of 7 (which was replaced with 3 in the first step). Then the next character (5) is replaced with 7, so the next character in the new string is 7. Then the third character (3) is appended as is (since f is now true). So the new string would be \"3\" (from 7) + \"7\" (from 5) + \"3\" (from 3) \u2192 \"373\". Then, the code reverses this string (because it does sb2.reverse().toString())? Wait, no, the code does:\n\nAfter building the sb, it creates a StringBuffer sb2 (which is a copy of sb), then reverses it and parses as a long. Wait, let me check the code again:\n\nThe code does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nAh, right! So the sb is built in the order of processing the digits from right to left, but then when reversed, it becomes the correct order. Let me see:\n\nTake the example of 357:\n\nOriginal s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (7,5,3):\n\nAfter processing, the sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 replaced with 3 (since it's not 3 or 5, so else clause \u2192 append '3'), so sb now has \"3\".\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 since f is still false (because in the first step, f wasn't set), so we process it. Since it's 5, we append '7' and set f to true. Now sb is \"37\".\n\nThird character (3): since f is now true, we just append the original '3', so sb becomes \"373\".\n\nThen, sb2 is a copy of sb (\"373\"), then reversed \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\". So the new i is 373. Wait, but that's smaller than the original 357. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the original i is 357. The next i would be 373? But 373 is larger than 357, so that's okay. Wait, but in the code's loop, the next i is 373, which is larger than 357, so the loop continues until i exceeds N.\n\nWait, but let's see another example. Suppose the current i is 377. Let's process that:\n\ns is \"377\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (7,7,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false. a is 7 \u2192 else clause \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is still false. a is 7 \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is still false. a is 3 \u2192 replace with 5, set f to true. So the third character becomes 5.\n\nSo the sb after processing is:\n\nFirst character (7 \u2192 3) \u2192 \"3\"\n\nSecond character (7 \u2192 3) \u2192 \"33\"\n\nThird character (3 \u21925 \u2192 append '5') \u2192 \"335\".\n\nThen, when reversed, the sb2 is \"335\" reversed \u2192 \"533\". So the new i is 533.\n\nHmm, okay. So the code is generating numbers in a way similar to counting in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7. Each digit can be 3,5,7, and when incrementing, it's like adding 1 in base 3, but with digits mapped to 3,5,7. So the next number is generated by incrementing the rightmost possible digit, and carrying over if needed.\n\nThe count c is the number of such numbers up to N that contain at least one 3,5, and7. Wait, but the code's condition is if the string contains all three. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. Wait, the first program's output is a list of numbers (each being r XOR a[i]), and the second program reads that as N? Or does the second program read the first program's output as its input?\n\nWait, the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. The second program's input is the output of the first, which is a list of numbers separated by spaces. But the second program's first line is reading N via gi(), which is an integer. So the second program expects to read an integer N from its input, which is the first program's output. Wait, but the first program's output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. So that would be a problem unless the second program is reading the first number as N, and the rest are ignored? Or perhaps the first program's output is a single number? Wait, looking back at the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. For example, if n=3 and the a array is [1,2,3], then r would be 1^2^3 = 0, so the output would be 0^1=1, 0^2=2, 0^3=1 \u2192 \"1 2 1\". So the second program would read this as input. But the second program's first step is to read N via gi(), which is the first integer in the input. So in this example, N would be 1, and the rest (2 and 1) are ignored. But that's probably not the case. Wait, the second program's code starts with:\n\nint N = gi();\n\nSo it reads the first integer from the input. The rest of the input is not used. So the first program's output must be a single integer, but that's only possible if n=1. Otherwise, the first program outputs multiple numbers, but the second program only reads the first one. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. The user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's input is the entire output of the first program. But the second program's code reads N as the first integer, then the rest of the input is not used. So the second program is only using the first number from the first program's output. That seems odd. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a single number? Let me check the first program again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program:\n\nThe first program's output is for each element a[i], it prints r ^ a[i]. So the output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. The number of numbers is n. So unless n is 1, the second program will read the first number as N, and the rest are not used. But the problem says that the sequence of Java programs must be translated into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So the Fortran program must read the input (the original input to the first Java program), process it through the first program's logic, then the second's logic, and output the final result.\n\nAh, right! The user wants the entire sequence to be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's input is the user's input, and its output is the input to the second Java program. The second's output is the final output. So the Fortran program must read the user's input (the first program's input), process it through both steps, and output the second program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (the first program's input: n followed by n integers).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic (compute r as XOR of all a[i], then compute each r^a[i], but not output them yet).\n\n3. Then, take the list of r^a[i] values as the input to the second program's processing.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is a list of numbers. The second program's first step is to read N as the first integer in that list. Then, the rest of the numbers are not used. Wait, but the second program's code is:\n\nint N = gi();\n\nThen, the loop starts with i=357, and counts numbers up to N. So the N here is the first number from the first program's output. The rest of the numbers are not used. So the second program only uses the first number of the first program's output as N, and ignores the rest. That's a bit strange, but that's how the Java code is written.\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the numbers are r^a[0], r^a[1], ..., r^a[n-1]. The first of these is r^a[0], which is (a[1]^a[2]^...^a[n]) ^ a[0], since r is the XOR of all a[i]. So r^a[0] is equal to the XOR of all a[i] except a[0]. Hmm, but that's not important here. The key point is that the second program takes the first number from the first program's output as N, and then proceeds.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (n and the array a).\n\n- Compute the first program's output (the list of r^a[i] for each i).\n\n- Take the first element of that list as N for the second program.\n\n- Then process the second program's logic with that N.\n\nWait, but the second program's code has a loop that starts with i=357 and increments until i exceeds N. The count c is the number of numbers up to N that contain at least one 3,5,7 in their digits. Wait, no, the condition is s.contains(\"3\") && s.contains(\"5\") && s.contains(\"7\"). So the count is the number of numbers up to N that have at least one 3, one 5, and one 7 in their digits. So the second program counts such numbers, and outputs c.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute r as the XOR of all elements in a.\n\n3. Compute the array b where each element is r XOR a[i].\n\n4. Take the first element of b (b[0]) as N for the second part.\n\n5. Then, process the second program's logic with N = b[0].\n\nWait, but the second program's code uses the entire list of numbers from the first program's output as input? Or only the first number? Because in the Java code, the second program reads N via gi(), which is the first integer in its input. The rest of the input is not read. So yes, only the first number is used. So the Fortran program must take the first element of the first program's output as N.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Read n and a array.\n\n- Compute r = XOR of all a[i].\n\n- Compute array b where each element is r ^ a[i].\n\n- Take N = b[0].\n\n- Then, compute the count c as per the second program's logic with this N.\n\n- Output c.\n\nNow, the challenge is to translate both Java programs into a single Fortran program that does this.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute r as the XOR of all elements in a.\n\n3. Compute array b where each element is r XOR a[i].\n\n4. Set N to b(1) (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, arrays are 0-based. Wait, in the first Java program, the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. So the first element of b is r^a[0], which in Fortran would be the first element if the array is 1-based. So in Fortran, if a is stored as 1-based, then b(1) is r^a(1). Wait, need to be careful with indices.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the array a is 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays. So when translating, the first element of a in Java (a[0]) is a(1) in Fortran. So when computing b, the first element (b[0] in Java) is r ^ a[0], which in Fortran would be b(1) = r XOR a(1).\n\nTherefore, the N for the second part is b(1).\n\n5. Then, compute the count c using the second program's logic with N.\n\nNow, the second part's logic is more complex. Let's think about how to implement that in Fortran.\n\nThe second program's logic:\n\nInitialize i = 357.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n   Check if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   Then, generate the next i by processing the digits as per the code's logic.\n\nThe key part is generating the next i. Let's think about how to implement the digit processing in Fortran.\n\nThe algorithm for generating the next i is as follows:\n\nTake the current i as a string.\n\nProcess each digit from the end (right to left):\n\n   Until we find a digit that can be incremented (3\u21925, 5\u21927, 7\u21923 and carry over).\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nLoop over each digit from the end (right to left):\n\n   If we haven't started modifying (f is false):\n\n      if current digit is '3', change to '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if '5', change to '7', set f to true.\n\n      else (must be '7'), change to '3', but leave f as false, so continue to next digit.\n\n   else:\n\n      leave the digit as is.\n\nAfter processing all digits, the new string is reversed (since the processing was done in reverse order, but the code reverses it again?), then parsed as the next i.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code's digit processing:\n\nThe code builds a new string by processing each digit from the end (right to left). For each digit:\n\n- If not yet modified (f is false):\n\n   if digit is 3 \u2192 becomes 5, set f to true.\n\n   if digit is 5 \u2192 becomes7, set f to true.\n\n   else (digit is7 \u2192 becomes3, but f remains false \u2192 so we continue to the next digit (to the left).\n\n- else, append the original digit.\n\nAfter processing all digits, the new string is reversed (because the code does sb2.reverse().toString()).\n\nWait, let's see with an example:\n\nTake i = 357 \u2192 \"357\".\n\nProcessing each digit from the end (7,5,3):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false. Since it's 7, we append '3', and f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (5):\n\nNow, f is still false. So process 5 \u2192 becomes7, set f to true.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append original 3.\n\nSo the new string is \"3\" (from first digit) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's code is:\n\nThe sb is built as the processed digits in the order of processing (right to left). Then, when reversed, it becomes left to right again. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code's processing builds the new string in the order of the digits from right to left. So the first character processed (the rightmost digit) is the first character in the new string. Then, when reversed, it becomes the correct order.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal digits: 3 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units).\n\nProcessing the digits from right to left (7,5,3):\n\nThe new string after processing is built as:\n\nFirst character (7 \u2192 becomes 3) \u2192 '3'\n\nSecond character (5 \u2192 becomes7) \u2192 '7'\n\nThird character (3 \u2192 becomes5) \u2192 '5'\n\nWait, no, in the example above, the third digit (3) is processed when f is now true (because the second digit was processed and set f to true). So the third digit is appended as is (3). So the new string is \"3\" (from first digit) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"373\". Then, when reversed, it becomes \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the sb is \"373\", then reversed becomes \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: i = 377 \u2192 \"377\".\n\nProcessing digits from right to left (7,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is still false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is still false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSo the new string is \"3\" (from first digit) + \"3\" (second) + \"5\" \u2192 \"335\".\n\nReversing gives \"533\", so next i is 533.\n\nHmm, okay. So the algorithm is:\n\nThe next i is generated by incrementing the rightmost possible digit that can be increased, with the rules 3\u21925, 5\u21927, 7\u21923 (and carry over if needed).\n\nSo the process is similar to counting in base 3, where each digit can be 3,5,7, and when you increment, you go 3\u21925, 5\u21927, 7\u21923 (and carry over if it was 7).\n\nTherefore, the next number is generated by treating the digits as base-3 digits (0,1,2) mapped to 3,5,7. So each digit is 0\u21923, 1\u21925, 2\u21927. To increment, you add 1 to the rightmost digit, and carry over as needed. But the code's approach is to process the digits from the end, and when a digit can be increased (3\u21925,5\u21927), it does so and stops. If it's 7 (digit 2), it becomes 3 (digit 0) and continues to the next digit.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, when a digit is 7 (third option), it's replaced with 3, but since f remains false, the loop continues to the next digit (to the left). So this is equivalent to a carry-over.\n\nSo the algorithm is similar to incrementing a number in base 3, where each digit can be 0,1,2 (mapped to 3,5,7). The next number is the next in this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the code's loop is generating all numbers composed of digits 3,5,7 in order, starting from 357, and counting how many of them up to N contain all three digits.\n\nNow, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nThe steps for the second part (counting c):\n\nInitialize c =0.\n\nInitialize i = 357.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n   Check if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   Generate the next i as per the digit processing.\n\nThe problem is implementing the digit processing to get the next i.\n\nImplementing the digit processing in Fortran:\n\nWe need to take the current i, convert it to a string, process the digits as per the algorithm, then convert back to a number.\n\nIn Fortran, handling strings can be done with character arrays or using intrinsic functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps for generating the next i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each character from the end (right to left):\n\n   Initialize a flag f = .false.\n\n   Create a new string (or array of characters) to build the new digits.\n\n   For each character in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n      if not f:\n\n          if current_char == '3':\n\n              append '5' to new string, set f = .true.\n\n          else if current_char == '5':\n\n              append '7', set f = .true.\n\n          else (must be '7'):\n\n              append '3', leave f as .false.\n\n      else:\n\n          append current_char as is.\n\n   After processing all characters, if f is still .false. (meaning all digits were 7?), then append '3' to the new string.\n\n   Then, reverse the new string to get the next number's digits in the correct order.\n\nWait, the code's code also has an else clause after the loop:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nWait, looking back at the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop over the digits, there's:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nAh, right! So after processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were modified, which can only happen if all digits were 7?), then we append a '3' to the new string. Then, when reversed, this would add a new digit to the left.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the Java code's code:\n\nAfter the for loop over the digits, there is:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nSo, after processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning no digit was modified), then append '3' to the sb. Then, when reversed, this would add a new digit to the left.\n\nFor example, if the original number is 777:\n\nProcessing each digit (7,7,7):\n\nFirst digit (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is still false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird digit (7):\n\nf is still false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all digits, since f is false, append '3' \u2192 the sb is now \"333\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"3333\".\n\nThen, reverse it \u2192 \"3333\" reversed is still \"3333\", so next i is 3333.\n\nWait, but the code's code would then process this as the next i. But in this case, the original i was 777, and the next is 3333. Hmm, but that's a big jump. But according to the algorithm, this is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, after processing all the digits, if f is false, we need to append a '3' to the new string.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Convert i to a string s.\n\n- Initialize new_str as an empty string.\n\n- f = .false.\n\n- Process each character in s from the end to the beginning (i.e., from right to left):\n\n   current_char = s(j), where j starts from the end.\n\n   if not f:\n\n      if current_char == '3' \u2192 new_str += '5', f = .true.\n\n      else if current_char == '5' \u2192 new_str += '7', f = .true.\n\n      else (must be '7') \u2192 new_str += '3', f remains .false.\n\n   else:\n\n      new_str += current_char\n\n- After processing all characters, if f is .false. \u2192 append '3' to new_str.\n\n- Then, reverse new_str to get the next number's string.\n\n- Convert this reversed string to a number (i).\n\nWait, no, the code in Java does:\n\nAfter building the sb (the new_str in our terms), then it creates a StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb), then reverses it and parses as a long.\n\nWait, the code's code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the new_str is the processed string (built from right to left processing), then reversed to get the correct order.\n\nWait, let's see with the first example:\n\nOriginal s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (7,5,3):\n\nThe new_str is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 '3' (since it's 7 and f is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 since f is still false, process 5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 since f is now true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo new_str is \"3\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, after the loop, since f is true, we don't append anything else.\n\nThen, reverse the new_str \u2192 \"373\" reversed is \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example with 777:\n\nProcessing each character (7,7,7):\n\nnew_str starts as empty.\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (7) \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird character (7) \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nAfter processing all, since f is false \u2192 append '3' \u2192 new_str is \"333\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"3333\".\n\nThen reverse it \u2192 \"3333\" \u2192 next i is 3333.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- After building new_str (without the final append if needed), then append '3' if f is false.\n\n- Then reverse the entire new_str to get the next i's string.\n\nWait, no. The code's code appends the '3' before reversing. Let me see:\n\nThe code's code:\n\nAfter the for loop, if (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nThen, the sb is reversed to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's code does:\n\nsb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the '3' is appended to the end of the new_str (before reversing). So in the 777 example, after processing the three 7's, the new_str is \"333\", then since f is false, append '3' \u2192 \"3333\". Then reverse it \u2192 \"3333\" \u2192 so the next i is 3333.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Initialize new_str as an empty string.\n\n3. f = .false.\n\n4. Loop over each character in s from the end to the beginning (i.e., from right to left):\n\n   current_char = s(j)\n\n   if not f:\n\n      if current_char == '3' \u2192 append '5', set f = .true.\n\n      else if current_char == '5' \u2192 append '7', set f = .true.\n\n      else (must be '7') \u2192 append '3', leave f as .false.\n\n   else:\n\n      append current_char.\n\n5. After the loop, if f is .false. \u2192 append '3' to new_str.\n\n6. Reverse new_str to get the next number's string.\n\n7. Convert this reversed string to a number (i).\n\nWait, no, the reversing is done on the entire new_str (including the appended '3' if needed). Because in the code, after appending the '3', the entire sb is reversed.\n\nWait, the code's code appends the '3' to the end of the new_str (since it's after the loop), then reverses the entire string.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter step 5 (appending '3' if needed), the new_str is the processed string (with possible appended '3'). Then, reverse it to get the next i's string.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- After building new_str (including the possible '3' append), reverse it to get the next i's digits in the correct order.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, converting the integer i to a string can be done with the intrinsic function. For example, using write and read:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ntrim(s) to remove leading spaces.\n\nBut in Fortran, when writing to a character variable with a format, it pads with spaces on the left. So to get the actual string, we can use adjustl(s) to left-justify.\n\nAlternatively, use the trim(adjustl(...)).\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function string_trim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a loop to process each digit.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, to convert i to a string:\n\ninteger :: i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! removes leading spaces.\n\nThen, process each character from the end to the beginning.\n\nWe can loop over the characters in reverse order.\n\nThe length of s is len_trim(s).\n\nWe can create an array of characters for the new_str.\n\ninteger :: len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: new_str = ''\n\nlogical :: f = .false.\n\ninteger :: j\n\ndo j = len_s, 1, -1\n\n   character :: c = s(j:j)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (c == '3') then\n\n         new_str = new_str // '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (c == '5') then\n\n         new_str = new_str // '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (c == '7') then\n\n         new_str = new_str // '3'\n\n         ! f remains false\n\n      else\n\n         ! invalid digit? According to the problem's logic, the digits should only be 3,5,7.\n\n         ! But since the code is processing numbers generated from previous steps, perhaps this won't happen.\n\n         ! For safety, perhaps treat as 3?\n\n         new_str = new_str // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      new_str = new_str // c\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! After the loop, check if f is false and append '3' if needed.\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   new_str = new_str // '3'\n\nend if\n\n! Now, reverse new_str to get the next i's string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: reversed_str\n\nreversed_str = ''\n\ndo j = len(new_str), 1, -1\n\n   reversed_str = reversed_str // new_str(j:j)\n\nend do\n\n! Now, convert reversed_str to integer.\n\nread(reversed_str, '(i0)') next_i\n\ni = next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the reversed_str may have leading zeros? No, because the original i is a number, so the reversed_str after processing should not have leading zeros. Wait, let's see:\n\nTake the example of 357 \u2192 new_str after processing is \"373\", then reversed_str is \"373\" \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: 777 \u2192 new_str after processing and appending '3' is \"3333\", reversed_str is \"3333\".\n\nAnother example: 377 \u2192 new_str after processing is \"335\", then after appending nothing (since f was set to true?), wait let's see:\n\nWait, in the example of 377:\n\nOriginal s is \"377\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (7,7,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is still false \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is still false \u2192 process '3' \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSo new_str after loop is \"3\" (from first 7) + \"3\" (second 7) + \"5\" (third 3) \u2192 \"335\".\n\nThen, since f is now true (because the third character was processed and set f to true), the if (.not. f) is false, so no append.\n\nThen reversed_str is \"533\".\n\nWait, no, the new_str is \"335\", then reversed_str is \"533\".\n\nWait, the reversed_str is the reverse of new_str. So \"335\" reversed is \"533\", so next_i is 533. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nSo the code above seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program steps:\n\nRead n and the array a.\n\nCompute r as the XOR of all elements in a.\n\nCompute array b where each element is r XOR a(i).\n\nSet N = b(1).\n\nThen, compute c as per the second program's logic.\n\nNow, the code for the second part (computing c):\n\nInitialize c =0.\n\ni = 357.\n\nloop while i <= N:\n\n   check if the string of i contains '3', '5', and '7'.\n\n   if yes, increment c.\n\n   compute next i as per the digit processing.\n\nend loop.\n\nOutput c.\n\nNow, the check for containing all three digits can be done by converting i to a string and checking for presence of each character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nfunction has_all_digits(i) result(res)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: i\n\n   logical :: res\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') i\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   res = contains_char(s, '3') .and. contains_char(s, '5') .and. contains_char(s, '7')\n\nend function\n\ncontains_char is a helper function:\n\nlogical function contains_char(s, c)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   character(len=1), intent(in) :: c\n\n   contains_char = index(s, c) /= 0\n\nend function\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can loop through each character.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function index.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, j, r, c, next_i, N\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n\n   !

So the array b is [0^1=1, 0^2=2, 0^3=1]. So N is 1 (the first element of b).\n\nThe second program's N is 1. The loop starts with i=357, which is larger than 1, so the loop doesn't execute. c remains 0. So the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is N=357 (so the first element of b is 357).\n\nThen the second program's loop starts with i=357. Check if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 1. Then compute next_i(357) \u2192 373.\n\nCheck if 373 <= 357? No, since 373>357, so the loop ends. So c is 1.\n\nAnother test case where N is 373:\n\nThen the loop runs for i=357 (counted, c=1), then next i is 373. Check if 373 contains all three digits? 3,7, but no 5 \u2192 so no. So c remains 1. Then compute next_i(373):\n\nProcessing 373 \u2192 \"373\".\n\nProcessing each digit from end (3,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nnew_str is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\".\n\nNo need to append '3' since f is true.\n\nReverse new_str \u2192 \"375\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, the new_str after processing is \"5\" (from first digit 3 \u21925), then next digit is 7 (second digit from the end is 7 \u2192 since f is now true, append '7', then third digit (the first digit of original number) is 3 \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo new_str is \"5\" (from first digit) + \"7\" (second digit) + \"3\" (third digit) \u2192 \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\".\n\nSo next_i is 375.\n\nNow, 375 is <= 373? No, so the loop stops. So c is 1.\n\nHmm, but the next_i after 357 is 373, which is larger than 357 but less than 373? No, 373 is the next i. So if N is 373, then the loop runs for i=357 (counted) and i=373 (not counted, since it doesn't have all three digits). So c is 1.\n\nAnother test case where N is 533 (the example earlier):\n\ni=357 \u2192 counted (c=1), next is 373 (not counted), next is 375 (check if contains 3,5,7? 3,7,5 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 2. Then next_i(375):\n\nProcessing 375 \u2192 \"375\".\n\nProcessing digits from end (5,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (5):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird digit (3):\n\nappend '3'.\n\nnew_str is \"7\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"773\".\n\nReversed \u2192 \"377\".\n\nSo next_i is 377.\n\nCheck if 377 contains all three digits? 3,7, but no 5 \u2192 no. So c remains 2.\n\nNext i is 377 \u2192 next_i is 533 (as in earlier example).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nProcessing 377 \u2192 \"377\".\n\nProcessing from end (7,7,3):\n\nFirst digit (7) \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond digit (7) \u2192 append '3', f remains false.\n\nThird digit (3) \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nnew_str is \"3\" + \"3\" + \"5\" \u2192 \"335\".\n\nSince f is true, no append.\n\nReverse \u2192 \"533\".\n\nSo next_i is 533.\n\nCheck if 533 contains all three digits? 5,3, but no 7 \u2192 no. So c remains 2.\n\nThen next_i is 533's next:\n\nProcessing 533 \u2192 \"533\".\n\nProcessing from end (3,3,5):\n\nFirst digit (3) \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond digit (3) \u2192 append '5' (since f is now true \u2192 append as is? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the digits are processed from the end (right to left):\n\nOriginal s is \"533\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (3,3,5):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nThird character (5):\n\nappend '5'.\n\nnew_str is \"5\" (from first 3) + \"3\" (second 3) + \"5\" (5) \u2192 \"535\".\n\nReversed \u2192 \"535\".\n\nSo next_i is 535.\n\nCheck if 535 contains all three digits? 5,3, but no 7 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the loop continues until i exceeds N (533). So in this case, with N=533, the count c would be 2 (from 357 and 375).\n\nHmm, but this is getting complex. The code should handle these cases correctly.\n\nNow, potential issues in the Fortran code:\n\n- The next_i function must handle leading zeros when reversing? Probably not, since the original i is a number, so the string has no leading zeros.\n\n- The conversion from the reversed_str to integer may have issues if the string is empty, but since the code appends at least one character (either from processing or the final '3'), it should be okay.\n\n- The has_all_digits function uses index(s, '3') etc. which returns the position, so if it's >0, it's present.\n\nAnother possible issue is the length of the character variables. Using len=20 should be sufficient for numbers up to 1e18 (since 357 is the starting point, and the numbers can grow, but in the problem's context, the input N is the first element of the first program's output, which is r XOR a[0]. The maximum possible value for a[i] is up to 2^31-1 (since Java uses int), so the XOR could be up to that. So 2^31 is about 2e9, which is 10 digits. So len=20 is enough.\n\nAnother thing: in the next_i function, the new_str is built as a character string, but in Fortran, when you do new_str = new_str // '5', the length may be extended. Since we declared new_str as len=20, it should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should work."
