    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file, atcoder_ABC139_B. It reads two integers A and B from input. Then calculates some result. The formula is result = (B-1)/(A-1), then if there's a remainder, add 1. So basically, it's the ceiling of (B-1)/(A-1). Because when you divide (B-1) by (A-1), if there's a remainder, you need to round up. So the result is the smallest integer such that (result)*(A-1) >= B-1. Got it.\n\nThe second Java file is codeforces_622_A. It reads a long integer position. Then it does some calculations involving a sequence. The getValueAtIndex function returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. The solve function finds the starting index of the block where the position is located and then calculates the answer as (position - startIndex) +1. \n\nThe first program's output is the input for the second. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (A and B), compute the first result, then use that result as the 'position' for the second part, then compute the final output.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read A and B from input.\n2. Compute the first result (result1) as ceiling((B-1)/(A-1)).\n3. Use result1 as the position in the second part.\n4. Compute the second part's result (result2) based on that position.\n5. Output result2.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part in Fortran:\n\nVariables A and B are integers. The first part's calculation is straightforward. Let me see:\n\nresult1 = (B-1) / (A-1). But in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero. So if there's a remainder, we need to add 1. So the formula would be:\n\nresult1 = (B-1) / (A-1)\nif (mod(B-1, A-1) .ne. 0) then\n   result1 = result1 +1\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the sign of the divisor. Since A and B are positive (assuming from the problem context), mod(B-1, A-1) would be correct here. So yes, that's how to compute it.\n\nNow the second part. The second Java program takes a long (position) and computes the answer. Let's see how that works.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\nThey have a function getValueAtIndex(index) which returns 1 + (index-1)*index/2. \n\nThe solve function starts with nrstSeqStartIndx =1, then loops while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position. So they double the index until the value at 2*index is beyond the position. Then, they do a second loop incrementing nrstSeqStartIndx until getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) is not <= position. Wait, the code is:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n    nrstSeqStartIndx *=2;\n}\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nWait, the second loop is incrementing nrstSeqStartIndx until the next value (nrstSeqStartIndx+1) would be beyond the position. So after the first loop, we have that the current index's next doubling is over, so the correct block is in the current or next. Then the second loop moves it to the exact starting index of the block containing the position.\n\nOnce that's found, the startIndex is getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the answer is (position - startIndex) +1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the algorithm is finding the largest index such that the value at that index is <= position, but I need to see exactly how it works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop finds a lower bound, and the second loop fine-tunes it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first loop finds the highest power of two such that the value at that index is less than the position, then the second loop steps through until the next step would exceed.\n\nBut regardless, in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nThe key is to translate the loops correctly.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code:\n\nInitialize nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\nLoop while getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position:\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx *=2\n\nThen, loop while getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position:\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx +=1\n\nOnce that's done, startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nresult2 = position - startIndex +1\n\nSo in Fortran, variables need to be of type integer*8 (since Java uses long, which is 64 bits). So in Fortran, using integer(8) variables for position, nrstSeqStartIndx, etc.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read A and B from input.\n\n2. Compute result1 as per first part.\n\n3. Use result1 as the position for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result2.\n\n5. Output result2.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: A, B\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result2\n\nThen, read A and B:\n\nread*, A, B\n\nCompute result1:\n\nresult1 = (B-1)/(A-1)\n\nif (mod(B-1, A-1) .ne. 0) then\n\n   result1 = result1 +1\n\nend if\n\nThen set position = result1\n\nThen proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's loops:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\nthen:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nBut need to define the function getValueAtIndex.\n\nIn Fortran, functions can be defined with functions. Let's write a function:\n\ninteger(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n   getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index-1)*index/2\n\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can be internal or external. Since this is a single program, perhaps we can define it inside the main program.\n\nAlternatively, use a function inside the program.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can have internal functions.\n\nSo inside the program:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: A, B\n\n   integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result2, result1\n\n   read*, A, B\n\n   ! compute first part\n\n   result1 = (B-1)/(A-1)\n\n   if (mod(B-1, A-1) .ne. 0) then\n\n      result1 = result1 +1\n\n   end if\n\n   position = result1\n\n   ! second part\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx =1\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\n   end do\n\n   startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\n   result2 = position - startIndex +1\n\n   print*, result2\n\ncontains\n\n   integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index-1)*index/2\n\n   end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but I need to check the loops again. Let me check the first loop's condition.\n\nIn the Java code, the first loop is while (getValue(2*current) < position). So in Fortran, the loop continues as long as that is true. So the loop body multiplies by 2 each time.\n\nWait, in the code above, the first loop's body is:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThe second loop is while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position), so we increment nrstSeqStartIndx until that condition is no longer true.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the second loop is:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nSo each iteration increases nrstSeqStartIndx by 1, and the loop continues as long as the next value is <= position.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing for possible overflows? Well, in Java, the code uses long, which is 64 bits. In Fortran, using integer(8) (which is 64 bits on most systems) should be okay.\n\nNow, possible edge cases. For example, when A=1. Wait, in the first part, if A is 1, then A-1 is zero, which would cause division by zero. But in the problem's context, perhaps A is given such that A>1? Because otherwise the first program would crash. So the problem's constraints probably require A !=1. So the Fortran code can assume that A is not 1. So no need to handle that here.\n\nAnother edge case: when B=1. Then (B-1) is zero, so result1 would be 0/(A-1) which is zero, but since mod(0, A-1) is zero, so result1 is 0. But then in the second part, position is zero? But in the second Java code, position is read as a long, but perhaps the problem expects position to be at least 1. So perhaps the first program's output is always at least 1? Let me see.\n\nWait, in the first program, when B is 1, then (B-1) is 0. So (0)/(A-1) is 0. Since mod(0, A-1) is zero, so result is 0. But then the second part would have position=0, which may not be valid. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the first program's output is valid for the second part. So assuming that the input is such that the first program's result is a valid position for the second part.\n\nNow, the code seems okay.\n\nWait, in the first loop in the second part, the initial nrstSeqStartIndx is 1. Let's see an example.\n\nSuppose position is 3.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nCheck getValue(2*1) = getValue(2) = 1 + (2-1)*2/2 = 1+1=2. Since 2 <3, so enter loop, set nrstSeqStartIndx to 2.\n\nNow check 2*2=4: getValue(4) is 1 +3*4/2 =1+6=7. 7 <3? No, so exit loop.\n\nThen the second loop:\n\nCheck getValue(2+1)=getValue(3) =1 +2*3/2 =1+3=4. 4 <=3? No. So the loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValue(2)=2. So result2 is 3-2+1=2.\n\nWait, but let's see what the Java code would do for position=3.\n\nIn Java:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop: check getValue(2) =2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nNow check getValue(4)=7 <3? No. So exit first loop.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(3) =4 <=3? No. So loop doesn't run. So startIndex is getValue(2)=2. So 3-2+1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: position=7.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nStart with 1. getValue(2)=2 <7 \u2192 yes. So becomes 2.\n\nCheck 4: getValue(4)=7. 7 <7? No. So exit first loop.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(3)=4 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to 3.\n\nNow check getValue(4)=7 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to 4.\n\nNow check getValue(5)=1 +4*5/2 =1+10=11>7 \u2192 so loop stops.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nAfter first loop, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. Then first loop's condition is 2*2=4 \u2192 getValue(4)=7 which is not less than 7, so first loop stops.\n\nThen second loop:\n\nCheck nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. Check getValue(3) =4 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to 3.\n\nNow check getValue(4)=7 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to4.\n\nNow check getValue(5)=11>7 \u2192 so loop stops.\n\nNow nrstSeqStartIndx is 4.\n\nstartIndex is getValue(4)=7. So result2 is 7-7+1=1.\n\nWhich is correct because position 7 is the first element of the block starting at 7 (since the next block starts at 11).\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: position=6.\n\nAfter first loop:\n\nStart with 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <6 \u2192 yes. So becomes 2.\n\nCheck 4 \u2192 getValue(4)=7 <6? No. So first loop stops.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck 3: getValue(3)=4 <=6 \u2192 yes. So increment to3.\n\nCheck 4: getValue(4)=7>6 \u2192 so loop stops.\n\nSo startIndex is getValue(3)=4. So 6-4+1=3. Which is correct because the sequence is 1,2,4,7, etc. The block starting at 4 includes 4,5,6,7. Wait, no, the blocks are:\n\nThe first block is index 1: value 1. The next is index 2: value 2. Then index 3:4, index4:7, etc. Wait, the sequence is a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=4, a(4)=7, a(5)=11, etc. So for position 6, it's in the block starting at a(3)=4. The elements are 4,5,6,7. So position 6 is the third element (4+2=6 \u2192 6-4+1=3). Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the function getValueAtIndex is correctly implemented.\n\nNow, in the code, I need to make sure that all variables are of the correct type. The position is an integer(8), as is nrstSeqStartIndx, etc.\n\nNow, the code structure in Fortran:\n\nThe program reads A and B, computes result1, then uses that as position, then computes the second part's result2, then prints it.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWait, in the first loop in the second part, I had a typo in the variable name in the loop body. Let me check:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct. The variable is correctly named.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe code should look like this:\n\nprogram main\n   implicit none\n   integer :: A, B\n   integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, result2, result1\n\n   read*, A, B\n\n   ! Compute first part\n   result1 = (B - 1) / (A - 1)\n   if (mod(B - 1, A - 1) /= 0) then\n      result1 = result1 + 1\n   end if\n\n   position = result1\n\n   ! Compute second part\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(2 * nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n   end do\n\n   do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position)\n      nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx + 1\n   end do\n\n   startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n   result2 = position - startIndex + 1\n\n   print*, result2\n\ncontains\n   integer(8) function getValueAtIndex(index)\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n      getValueAtIndex = 1 + (index - 1) * index / 2\n   end function getValueAtIndex\nend program main\n\nWait, in the initialization of nrstSeqStartIndx, I used 1_8 to make it 8-byte integer. Alternatively, since it's declared as integer(8), initializing with 1 is okay, but maybe better to be explicit.\n\nAlternatively, just 1 is okay because the variable is integer(8). The compiler should handle it.\n\nTesting the code for the example where A=2, B=3.\n\nFirst part: (3-1)/(2-1) =2/1=2. mod(2,1)=0 \u2192 result1=2.\n\nSecond part: position=2.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2. 2 <2? No. So first loop doesn't run.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(2) +1 \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 getValue(3)=4. 4 <=2? No. So loop doesn't run.\n\nstartIndex is getValue(1)=1. So result2 is 2-1+1=2.\n\nWait, but let's see what the second Java program would do with position=2.\n\nIn Java:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop: check getValue(2) =2 <2? No. So first loop stops.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(2) \u2192 2+1=2? No, the code checks getValue(1+1)=getValue(2)=2 <=2 \u2192 yes. So increment to 2.\n\nNow check getValue(3)=4 <=2? No. So loop stops.\n\nSo nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. startIndex is getValue(2)=2. So result is 2-2+1=1.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the Fortran code's result. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait in the example where position is 2:\n\nJava code:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop: check getValue(2) (since 2*1=2). getValue(2) is 2. Since 2 <2 is false, so first loop doesn't run.\n\nThen second loop:\n\nCheck getValue(1+1)=getValue(2)=2 <=2 \u2192 yes. So increment to 2.\n\nNow check getValue(2+1)=getValue(3)=4 <=2? No. So loop stops.\n\nThus, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nstartIndex is getValue(2)=2. So result is 2-2+1=1.\n\nBut in the Fortran code above, the code would have:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop: check 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 < position (2)? No \u2192 loop doesn't run.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(1+1)=2 <=2 \u2192 yes. So increment to 2.\n\nThen check getValue(2+1)=4 <=2 \u2192 no. So loop stops.\n\nThus, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. startIndex is 2 \u2192 result2 is 2-2+1=1. So the Fortran code would output 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation of the Fortran code, I thought the startIndex was 1. Wait, no:\n\nWait in the code:\n\nAfter the loops, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. So startIndex = getValueAtIndex(2) \u2192 which is 2. So yes, the result is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nAh, I made a mistake in my earlier analysis of the Fortran code. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=3, B=4.\n\nFirst part: (4-1)/(3-1)=3/2=1. mod(3,2)=1\u22600 \u2192 result1=2.\n\nSecond part: position=2.\n\nFirst loop: check 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <2? No. So first loop stops.\n\nSecond loop: check getValue(2) \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 getValue(3)=4>2 \u2192 so no. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the second loop is while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position).\n\nInitially, nrstSeqStartIndx is 1.\n\nCheck getValue(2) =2 <=2 \u2192 yes. So increment to 2.\n\nNow check getValue(3)=4 <=2 \u2192 no. So loop stops.\n\nThus, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2. startIndex is 2 \u2192 result2 is 2-2+1=1.\n\nWait, but position is 2. So the answer is 1. Correct.\n\nYes, so the code works.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written above."
