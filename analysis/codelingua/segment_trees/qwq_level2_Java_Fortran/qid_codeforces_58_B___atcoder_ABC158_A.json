So in the second loop, the initial value is 1, but the variable is already 11, so the loop won't execute. So this is a problem. Ah, right! So in the code above, the first loop uses i as the loop variable (from n-1 downto 1). Then the second loop also uses i, which would be problematic because after the first loop, i is 0 (since the loop went down to 1, so the last i is 1, then the next step is i =1 -1 =0, which exits the loop, so the value of i after the loop is 0). Then the second loop starts with i=1, but the variable i is already 0, so the loop condition (i=1 to count) would not execute. So that's a bug. So to fix this, the second loop should use a different loop variable, like j.\n\nSo changing the second loop to:\n\ndo j=1, count\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) //",

The code for the solve method is:\n\npublic void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {\n\n    String s = in.next(); if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n\n        out.println(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        out.println(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, so the code is expecting a single string input (the entire input is one token?), but the first program's output is multiple tokens (each line's number followed by space and newline). So the second program would read the first token (the first number) and check if it contains A and B. Which it won't, so output \"No\". But the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. So the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, which is multiple lines. But the code of the second program only reads the first token (the first number), so the rest is ignored. So the code is correct as per the problem's given code.",

But the output_str starts as empty, then after first iteration, it's '6 ' (if n=6). Then next iteration adds '3 ' \u2192 '6 3 ', etc.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (codeforces_58_B):\n\nIt reads an integer n from input. Then it prints n followed by spaces. Wait, actually, looking at the code, the first print is \"n + \" \", so it's n followed by a space. Then it initializes m as n. Then loops from i = n-1 down to 1. For each i, if m is divisible by i, it prints i with a space and updates m to i. So the output is a sequence of numbers starting with n, followed by the largest possible divisors in decreasing order until 1? Or until it can't divide anymore. The output is all the numbers printed with spaces. Wait, the first print is n + \" \", so each number is printed with a space after. But in Fortran, the output might need to be handled carefully to avoid trailing spaces. Hmm, but the problem says to reproduce the same behavior, so I need to make sure the Fortran code does exactly that.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n\nIt reads a string s, and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, outputs \"Yes\", else \"No\". So the input here is the output of the first program. The first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. So the second program will read that string and check if it has both 'A' and 'B'. Wait, but the first program's output is numbers with spaces. Wait, the first program's output is numbers followed by a space each. For example, if n is 6, the first program would output \"6 \", then check 5 (if 6 mod 5 is 1, so no), then 4 (6 mod4 is 2, no), 3 (6 mod3 is 0, so print \"3 \", then m becomes 3. Then 2: 3 mod2 is 1, so no. 1: yes, so print \"1 \". So the output would be \"6 3 1 \" followed by spaces? Wait, each print statement adds a space. So the entire output is numbers separated by spaces, but each number is printed with a space after. So the total output would be like \"6 3 1 \" (with a trailing space). Then the second program reads that entire string as s. But the second program checks for presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Since the first program's output is numbers and spaces, the second program would output \"No\" because there are no A or B. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is numbers, so the second program's input is a string of digits and spaces. So the second program would output \"No\" unless the first program's output includes 'A' and 'B', which it never does. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program is expecting a string that may have 'A' and 'B'? But the first program's output is numbers and spaces. So the second program will always output \"No\" unless the first program's output has those letters. But that's how the original code works. So the Fortran program must replicate that.\n\nNow, the task is to combine both into a single Fortran program. The first Java program's output is the input to the second. So in Fortran, I need to process the input through both steps without I/O in between.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read the initial input (n) from stdin.\n\n2. Process it through the first Java's logic (generate the sequence of numbers, but don't output yet).\n\n3. Then process that sequence through the second Java's logic (check for A and B in the generated string, then output \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nBut in Fortran, how to do this?\n\nFirst, the first part: the first Java program's processing is to take n, generate a list of numbers (starting with n, then the largest possible divisors in decreasing order). The output of the first program is the sequence of numbers separated by spaces, each followed by a space. So the string to be passed to the second program is that sequence with spaces.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read n from input.\n\n- Generate the sequence as a string (the same as the first Java's output would produce).\n\n- Then process that string through the second Java's logic (check for presence of 'A' and 'B').\n\n- Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the sequence as a string (without printing it).\n\nCheck if the string contains both 'A' and 'B' (which it won't, but the code must do that check as per the second Java program).\n\nWait, but the first program's output is numbers and spaces. So the string will have digits and spaces. So the second check will always be \"No\".\n\nBut the code must do exactly what the Java does. So the Fortran code must process the first's output as the input to the second's logic.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n1. Read the integer n from input.\n\n2. Generate the sequence of numbers as a string (same as first Java's output).\n\n3. Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B' (which it won't, but code must do it).\n\n4. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst part: generating the sequence.\n\nThe first Java code's logic:\n\nInitialize m = n.\n\nPrint n followed by a space.\n\nThen loop from i = n-1 down to 1:\n\nif m mod i ==0, then print i followed by a space, set m =i.\n\nSo the sequence is n followed by the numbers i where each is a divisor of the previous m.\n\nThe string is the concatenation of each number followed by a space.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to build a string that starts with n, then each qualifying i, each followed by a space.\n\nSo steps for building the string:\n\nInitialize a character variable (maybe a long enough string) to hold the result.\n\nStart with the first number: write n as a string, then add a space.\n\nThen loop from i = n-1 down to 1:\n\nCheck if current m (starting at n) is divisible by i.\n\nIf yes, append i followed by a space, and set m =i.\n\nSo variables needed:\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: output_str\n\nInitialize m =n\n\noutput_str = trim(adjustl(str(n))) // ' '\n\nWait, but converting integers to strings in Fortran can be done with internal writes.\n\nAlternatively, use write statements into a character variable.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo first, read n.\n\nThen:\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: output_str\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nm = n\n\noutput_str = ''\n\nwrite(output_str, '(i0, 1x)') n\n\nthen loop i from n-1 downto 1:\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n\n       write(output_str, '(a, i0, 1x)') trim(output_str), i\n\n       m = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but appending to the string may be tricky because in Fortran, you can't just append like in Java. So perhaps better to build the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps better to first collect all the numbers in an array, then build the string.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and keep appending.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you write to a character variable, you have to manage the position.\n\nAlternatively, use an internal write to a string.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to first collect all the numbers in an array, then build the string from that array.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the numbers.\n\nFirst element is n.\n\nThen, for each i from n-1 down to 1:\n\nif m mod i ==0, add to the array, set m =i.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: numbers(:)\n\ninteger :: count =1, m, i, n\n\nallocate(numbers(1))\n\nnumbers(1) = n\n\nm =n\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n       count = count +1\n\n       numbers = [numbers, i]\n\n       m =i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, after collecting all numbers, build the output_str as the concatenation of each number followed by a space.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: output_str\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo i =1, count\n\n   write(output_str, '(a, i0, 1x)') trim(output_str), numbers(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this might not work because each write would overwrite the variable. Hmm, perhaps better to use an internal write into a temporary string and then concatenate.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and build it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to first collect all the numbers in an array, then write them all into a string with spaces.\n\nLike:\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: output_str\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo i =1, count\n\n   write(output_str, '(a, i0, 1x)', advance='no') numbers(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the 'advance' might not be necessary. Alternatively, using a format that appends.\n\nAlternatively, using a format that writes all numbers separated by spaces.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nwrite(output_str, '(10000i0, 1x)') (numbers(j), j=1, count)\n\nBut that would write all numbers followed by a space each, which is exactly what the first Java program does.\n\nBut the problem is that the output_str must be exactly the same as the first program's output. So each number is followed by a space, including the last one. So the total string would be like \"6 3 1 \" (with a trailing space). So the format should be to write each number followed by a space, so the total length is (number of numbers)* (digits +1) +1? Not sure, but the format can be handled.\n\nAlternatively, the first number is written with 'i0, 1x', then each subsequent number is also written with ', i0, 1x'.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo i =1, count\n\n   if (i ==1) then\n\n      write(output_str, '(i0, 1x)') numbers(i)\n\n   else\n\n      write(output_str, '(a, i0, 1x)') trim(output_str), numbers(i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut this might not work because each write would overwrite the variable. Wait, in Fortran, when you write to a character variable, the output is placed starting at the first character. So if the variable is initially empty, then the first write would put the first number and space. The second write would take the existing string, append the next number and space? No, because the write statement would replace the entire variable. So this approach won't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use an internal write into a temporary string and then concatenate.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with sufficient length and build it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable and build it step by step using concatenation.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can do:\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(str(numbers(i))) // ' '\n\nBut converting numbers to strings can be done via internal write.\n\nWait, the function str() is not standard, but we can use write with an internal file.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function 'adjustl' and 'trim' but that might not be sufficient for numbers with varying digits.\n\nAlternatively, for each number, write it to a temporary string and then append.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nInitialize output_str as empty.\n\nThen for each number in the numbers array:\n\n   temp_str = ' '\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') number\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\nWait, but this would add a space before and after? No, perhaps:\n\nWait, first number:\n\noutput_str starts as ''\n\ntemp_str is the number as a string, then append ' '.\n\nSo first iteration:\n\noutput_str becomes '6 ' (assuming first number is 6).\n\nSecond number (3):\n\ntemp_str is '3', then append ' ', so output_str becomes '6 3 '.\n\nThird number (1): becomes '6 3 1 '.\n\nYes, that would work. So the code would be:\n\nallocate(numbers(1))\n\nnumbers(1) = n\n\nm =n\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n       count = count +1\n\n       numbers = [numbers, i]\n\n       m =i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, building the string:\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo j =1, count\n\n   temp_str = ''\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the first iteration:\n\ntemp_str is '6', then output_str becomes '' + '6' + ' ' \u2192 '6 '.\n\nSecond iteration (j=2, numbers(2)=3):\n\ntemp_str is '3', so output_str becomes '6 ' + '3 ' \u2192 '6 3 '.\n\nYes, that works. So this way, the output_str will have all numbers separated by spaces, each followed by a space, including the last one. So the string is exactly what the first Java program outputs.\n\nNow, the second part: check if the output_str contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, how to check if a string contains a substring.\n\nFortran 90+ has the function INDEX.\n\nSo:\n\nif (index(output_str, 'A') >0 .and. index(output_str, 'B') >0) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut the output_str is the string generated from numbers and spaces. Since numbers are digits, the string will have no 'A' or 'B', so the result is 'No'.\n\nBut the code must do exactly that check.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the array allocation. Since the numbers array can grow dynamically, but in Fortran, we can use an allocatable array and reallocate as needed. However, in the loop, when adding a new element, we can use the [ ] syntax to concatenate arrays.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you have an array numbers, and you do numbers = [numbers, i], that's allowed in Fortran 2003 and later. But if the compiler is older, it might not support that. But assuming that's okay, or perhaps better to pre-allocate a sufficiently large array.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible numbers in the sequence is n (for n=1, it's 1 element; for n=2, it's 2 elements (2,1), etc. So the maximum possible count is n. So we can pre-allocate an array of size n.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_size = 100000  ! assuming n can be up to 1e5 or something.\n\ninteger :: numbers(max_size)\n\ncount =1\n\nnumbers(1) =n\n\nm =n\n\ndo i =n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n       count = count +1\n\n       numbers(count) =i\n\n       m =i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, no dynamic allocation needed. Just pre-allocate a large enough array. Since the problem's constraints on n aren't given, but in programming competition problems, n is often up to 1e5 or similar. So using 1e5 as max_size is okay.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize numbers array with max_size.\n\nSet count=1, numbers(1)=n, m =n.\n\nLoop i from n-1 downto 1:\n\n   if m mod i ==0 \u2192 add to array, increment count, set m =i.\n\nThen build the output_str as the concatenation of each number followed by a space.\n\nThen check for 'A' and 'B' in output_str.\n\nNow, building the output_str:\n\nInitialize as empty.\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo j=1, count\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So temp_str should be a character variable, say of length 10 (since numbers can be up to, say, 1e5 which is 5 digits).\n\nWait, but the numbers can be up to n, which could be very large. But in the first Java code, n is read as an integer, so in Fortran, it's also an integer. The maximum n that can be handled depends on the system, but assuming 32-bit, up to 2e9, which would be 10 digits. So temp_str can be length 10.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: temp_str\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: output_str\n\nallocate( character(len=1) :: output_str )\n\noutput_str = ''\n\nBut perhaps better to use a fixed-length character variable. Since the maximum possible length of output_str is (count)*(max_digits +1) +1. But since count can be up to n, and max_digits up to say 10, the total length could be up to n*11. For n=1e5, that's 1.1e6 characters. So using a character(len=1000000) would be okay, but in Fortran, it's better to use an allocatable.\n\nAlternatively, use a character(len=1000000) variable.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable that is built step by step.\n\nWait, let me think of code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000000) :: output_str\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo j=1, count\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the 'trim' on temp_str is unnecessary because writing with '(i0)' should not have leading spaces. So temp_str will have exactly the digits of the number. So:\n\ntemp_str is written as the number, so for numbers(j)=5, temp_str is '5', then adding ' ' gives '5 '.\n\nSo the code would be okay.\n\nBut the output_str starts as empty, then after first iteration, it's '6 ' (if n=6).\n\nThen next iteration adds '3 ' \u2192 '6 3 ', etc.\n\nNow, after building the output_str, check for presence of 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, the INDEX function returns the position of the substring, or 0 if not found.\n\nSo:\n\nif (index(output_str, 'A') >0 .and. index(output_str, 'B') >0) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut the output_str is the string generated from numbers and spaces, so it will never have 'A' or 'B', so the output is always 'No'.\n\nBut the code must do exactly that.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, the code structure in Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, i, count, max_size = 100000\n\n   integer, dimension(max_size) :: numbers\n\n   character(len=10) :: temp_str\n\n   character(len=1000000) :: output_str\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   count =1\n\n   numbers(1) =n\n\n   m =n\n\n   do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          numbers(count) =i\n\n          m =i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   output_str = ''\n\n   do i=1, count\n\n      write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(i)\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\n   end do\n\n   if (index(output_str, 'A') >0 .and. index(output_str, 'B') >0) then\n\n      print *, 'Yes'\n\n   else\n\n      print *, 'No'\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for building the output_str, the loop variable is i, but the count is already using i as the loop variable in the first loop. Oh right, in the first loop, the loop variable is i from n-1 downto 1. Then in the second loop, the loop variable can also be i, but since it's a different scope, it's okay. Alternatively, use j to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, in the first loop, the loop variable is i (from n-1 downto 1). Then in the second loop, the loop variable is i again (from 1 to count). That's okay in Fortran because the loops are nested? No, actually, the first loop is a do loop, and the second loop is another do loop. The variables are in the same scope, so using the same variable name i might cause issues. Because after the first loop, i is set to 0 (since the loop ends at 1, stepping by -1). Then in the second loop, the initial value is 1, but the variable i is already set to 0. Wait, no, in Fortran, the loop variable is local to the loop. Wait, no, in Fortran, the loop variable is in the same scope. So if you have:\n\ndo i = 1, 10\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\ndo i = 1,5\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\nThe second loop will reuse the same variable i, which after the first loop is 11 (since the loop ends at 10, then i becomes 11). So in the second loop, the initial value is 1, but the variable is already 11, so the loop won't execute. So this is a problem.\n\nAh, right! So in the code above, the first loop uses i as the loop variable (from n-1 downto 1). Then the second loop also uses i, which would be problematic because after the first loop, i is 0 (since the loop went down to 1, so the last i is 1, then the next step is i =1 -1 =0, which exits the loop, so the value of i after the loop is 0). Then the second loop starts with i=1, but the variable i is already 0, so the loop condition (i=1 to count) would not execute. So that's a bug.\n\nSo to fix this, the second loop should use a different loop variable, like j.\n\nSo changing the second loop to:\n\ndo j=1, count\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\nend do\n\nThat way, the loop variable j is separate from i.\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, i, j, count, max_size = 100000\n\n   integer, dimension(max_size) :: numbers\n\n   character(len=10) :: temp_str\n\n   character(len=1000000) :: output_str\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   count =1\n\n   numbers(1) =n\n\n   m =n\n\n   do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          numbers(count) =i\n\n          m =i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   output_str = ''\n\n   do j=1, count\n\n      write(temp_str, '(i0)') numbers(j)\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // ' '\n\n   end do\n\n   if (index(output_str, 'A') >0 .and. index(output_str, 'B') >0) then\n\n      print *, 'Yes'\n\n   else\n\n      print *, 'No'\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nAnother thing: the output_str is built with each number followed by a space. So the final string has a trailing space. The second Java program reads the entire input as a single string (using in.next()), which in Java reads the next token. Wait, wait a second! Wait, in the second Java program, the code is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nBut in Java, Scanner's next() method reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. So if the first program's output is \"6 3 1 \", then in.next() would read \"6\", not the entire string. Wait, that's a problem!\n\nOh no! I made a mistake here. The second Java program's input is the output of the first program. But the first program's output is a sequence of numbers each followed by a space. So the entire output is like \"6 3 1 \" (with a trailing space). But when the second Java program reads it with in.next(), it will read the first token (the first number), not the entire string. So the second program's s would be \"6\", not the entire string. Therefore, the second program would check if \"6\" contains 'A' and 'B', which it doesn't, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the original problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the entire string (including all numbers and spaces), and the second program reads that entire string as input. But in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which reads the next token. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the second Java program's code.\n\nLooking back at the second Java code:\n\nThe second Java program is atcoder_ABC158_A. Its code is:\n\npublic void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {\n\n    String s = in.next();\n\n    if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n\n        out.println(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        out.println(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, here, in.next() reads the next token, which is the first word. So if the first program's output is \"6 3 1 \", then the first token is \"6\", so s is \"6\", so the check is on \"6\", which has no A or B \u2192 \"No\".\n\nBut the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the entire string (including all numbers and spaces), and the second program reads that entire string as its input. But in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which would read the first token. So that's a problem. Wait, but perhaps the first program's output is printed with a newline? Let me check the first Java code.\n\nFirst Java program's code:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWait, the print statement is System.out.println(n + \" \"); \u2192 which appends a space and then a new line? Or does the + \" \" add a space, and then the println adds a new line?\n\nYes, the code for the first program is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nSo the output is the value of n followed by a space, then a new line. Then the loop does similar:\n\nfor each i, System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait the first print is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nThen in the loop:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n\n    if (m % i ==0) {\n\n        System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\n        m = i;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nEach of those is a println, so each number is printed followed by a space and a new line.\n\nWait, so the first program's output is:\n\nn followed by a space and a new line,\n\nthen each subsequent number (if printed) is on its own line with a space and new line.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the first program's output is multiple lines, each line has a number followed by a space and a new line.\n\nWait, for example, if n is 6:\n\nFirst line: \"6 \" followed by a new line.\n\nThen, for i=5: 6 mod5 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: 6 mod3 is 0 \u2192 print \"3 \" followed by new line.\n\nThen m becomes 3.\n\ni=2: 3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: 3 mod1 is 0 \u2192 print \"1 \" followed by new line.\n\nSo the total output is:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nEach line ends with a space and a new line.\n\nSo the entire output is three lines, each with a number followed by a space and a newline.\n\nSo the second Java program reads this as input. The second program's code uses in.next(), which reads the next token. Since the input has multiple lines, but Scanner's next() reads tokens separated by whitespace (including newlines). So the first token is \"6\", then the next is \"3\", then \"1\", etc. But in the code, it's s = in.next(); so s is the first token, which is \"6\", so the check is on \"6\", which has no A or B \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is written to read the entire string? Or is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is:\n\nString s = in.next();\n\nSo it's reading the first token. So the entire input from the first program is being read as multiple tokens, but the second program only takes the first one. That's a problem. But according to the problem statement, the second program is supposed to process the entire output of the first program. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code?\n\nWait, looking back at the second Java code:\n\nThe second Java program is atcoder_ABC158_A. The code for the solve method is:\n\npublic void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {\n\n    String s = in.next();\n\n    if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n\n        out.println(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        out.println(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh, so the code is expecting a single string input (the entire input is one token?), but the first program's output is multiple tokens (each line's number followed by space and newline). So the second program would read the first token (the first number) and check if it contains A and B. Which it won't, so output \"No\".\n\nBut the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. So the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, which is multiple lines. But the code of the second program only reads the first token (the first number), so the rest is ignored. So the code is correct as per the problem's given code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must replicate this behavior. So the first program's output is the entire string (including all lines and spaces), but the second program only reads the first token (the first number's part). Wait, no, the first program's output is multiple lines, each line has a number followed by a space and a newline. So the entire input to the second program is a multi-line string. The second program's code uses in.next(), which reads the first token (the first number followed by space?), but actually, the first line is \"6 \" followed by a newline. So the first token is \"6 \" (with the space?), or is the space considered part of the token?\n\nWait, in Java's Scanner, the default delimiter is whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). So the token is the first sequence of non-whitespace characters. So the first line is \"6 \" followed by a newline. The first token is \"6\" (the space is a delimiter). So the first token is \"6\", then the next token is \"3\", etc. So the second program's s is \"6\", so the check is on that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must replicate this behavior. So the first program's output is the entire string (with newlines?), but the second program's input is the first token (the first number).\n\nWait, but in the problem's instruction, the second program's input is the first program's output. So the second program's input is the entire output of the first program. But the second program's code only reads the first token. So the Fortran code must process the first program's output as a single string (the entire output), then the second part of the code (the second Java's logic) must read the first token of that string and check for 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the code uses in.next(), which reads the next token from the input. So the entire input is read as a sequence of tokens, and the first token is taken. So the Fortran code must:\n\n- Generate the first program's output as a string (including all lines and spaces and newlines).\n\n- Then, process that string by taking the first token (split on whitespace), and check if that token contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is multiple lines, each line has a number followed by a space and a newline. So the entire output is like:\n\n\"6 \\n3 \\n1 \\n\"\n\nSo the tokens are \"6\", \"3\", \"1\".\n\nThe second program's s is the first token, \"6\".\n\nSo the check is on \"6\", which has no A or B \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must:\n\n1. Generate the first program's output as a string (including newlines and spaces).\n\n2. Split that string into tokens (split on whitespace), take the first token.\n\n3. Check if that first token contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is written to read the first token (in.next()), so the Fortran code must do the same.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must:\n\n- After generating the first program's output (the entire string with newlines and spaces), process it by taking the first token (split on whitespace), then check if that token contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo the previous approach of building the entire string and then checking for 'A' and 'B' in the entire string is incorrect. Because the second Java program only looks at the first token.\n\nAh! This is a critical mistake in my earlier reasoning. I need to correct this.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nThe first program's output is a multi-line string, each line has a number followed by a space and a newline.\n\nThe second program reads the first token (the first number, without the trailing space), because the space is a delimiter.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nThe first program's output for n=6 is:\n\n6  (with a space and a newline)\n\n3  (space and newline)\n\n1  (space and newline)\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\n\"6 \\n3 \\n1 \\n\"\n\nThe tokens (split on whitespace) are \"6\", \"3\", \"1\".\n\nSo the first token is \"6\".\n\nThus, the second program's s is \"6\", so the check is on \"6\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must:\n\n- Generate the first program's output as a string (including newlines and spaces).\n\n- Split that string into tokens (split on whitespace), take the first token.\n\n- Check if that first token contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nSo the Fortran code must do that.\n\nTherefore, the previous approach of checking the entire string for 'A' and 'B' is wrong. Instead, we need to extract the first token and check that.\n\nSo how to do that in Fortran.\n\nFirst, generate the first program's output as a string (the entire output, including newlines and spaces).\n\nWait, in the first Java program, each print statement is a println, so each line ends with a newline. So in Fortran, the output_str must include newlines.\n\nWait, in the first Java code:\n\nThe first print is System.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nSo that appends a space and then a new line.\n\nThen each subsequent print in the loop is also a println, so each line ends with a space and a new line.\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\nn followed by space and newline,\n\nthen each qualifying i followed by space and newline.\n\nSo in Fortran, the output_str must include newlines.\n\nTherefore, when building the output_str in Fortran, each number is followed by a space and a newline.\n\nWait, so the first part of the code (generating the output_str) must include newlines.\n\nAh! That's another mistake I made earlier. I forgot the newlines.\n\nSo the first Java program's output is each number followed by a space and a newline. So the output_str in Fortran must be built with each number followed by ' \\n'.\n\nSo the code for building the output_str must include the newline.\n\nSo the code for building the output_str should be:\n\noutput_str = ''\n\ndo j=1, count\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0, 1x)') numbers(j)\n\n   output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // char(10)\n\nend do\n\nWait, because each line is number followed by a space and a newline.\n\nWait, the first line is n followed by a space and a newline. So for each number, we write the number followed by a space, then a newline.\n\nSo for each number, the line is: number + ' ' + '\\n'.\n\nThus, for each j:\n\ntemp_str is the number as a string followed by a space.\n\nThen append a newline (ASCII 10).\n\nSo:\n\nwrite(temp_str, '(i0, 1x)') numbers(j)\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // char(10)\n\nWait, but the first iteration:\n\ntemp_str is '6 ' (from writing i0 and 1x), then adding char(10) \u2192 '6 \\n'.\n\nSecond iteration: '3 \\n', etc.\n\nThus, the entire output_str is:\n\n\"6 \\n3 \\n1 \\n\" (for n=6).\n\nNow, the second part: extract the first token from this string.\n\nIn Fortran, how to split the string into tokens and get the first one.\n\nThe first token is the first sequence of non-whitespace characters.\n\nIn the string \"6 \\n3 \\n1 \\n\", the first token is \"6\".\n\nSo the first token is everything up to the first whitespace (space or newline).\n\nSo to extract the first token:\n\nWe can loop through the characters until a whitespace is found.\n\nAlternatively, use the index of the first whitespace.\n\nThe first whitespace is the space after '6', at position 2 (assuming 1-based).\n\nSo the first token is the substring from 1 to 1 (since the first character is '6', then the next is space).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe string is \"6 \" followed by a newline. So the first two characters are '6' and ' ' (space). The third is newline (char(10)), etc.\n\nSo the first token is from position 1 to 1 (the '6').\n\nThus, the first token is the substring from 1 to the first occurrence of any whitespace (space or newline).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can find the first occurrence of any whitespace (space, tab, newline, etc.) and take the substring up to that.\n\nAlternatively, find the first occurrence of a space or newline.\n\nThe first whitespace is at position 2 (the space after '6').\n\nSo the first token is characters 1 to 1.\n\nThus, the code can be:\n\ninteger :: first_whitespace_pos\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = 1\n\ndo while (first_whitespace_pos <= len_trim(output_str) .and. output_str(first_whitespace_pos:first_whitespace_pos) /= ' ' .and. output_str(first_whitespace_pos:first_whitespace_pos) /= char(10) .and. output_str(first_whitespace_pos:first_whitespace_pos) /= char(9) )\n\n   first_whitespace_pos = first_whitespace_pos +1\n\nend do\n\nThen the first token is output_str(1:first_whitespace_pos-1).\n\nAlternatively, use the index function to find the first occurrence of any whitespace.\n\nBut Fortran's INDEX function can search for a substring. To find the first occurrence of any whitespace character (space, newline, tab), perhaps the easiest way is to check for the first occurrence of any of them.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to find the first position where the character is a whitespace.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function scan.\n\nThe SCAN function can find the first occurrence of any of the characters in a set.\n\nSo:\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, ' ' // char(10) // char(9))\n\nWait, the second argument to scan is a string of characters to search for. So:\n\ncharacters = ' ' // char(10) // char(9)\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, characters)\n\nIf first_whitespace_pos is 0, then the entire string is the first token.\n\nElse, the first token is output_str(1:first_whitespace_pos-1).\n\nThus, in code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000000) :: first_token\n\ninteger :: first_whitespace_pos\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, ' ' // char(10) // char(9))\n\nif (first_whitespace_pos == 0) then\n\n   first_token = trim(output_str)\n\nelse\n\n   first_token = output_str(1:first_whitespace_pos-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen check if first_token contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but in the example of n=6, first_token is '6', so it doesn't contain A or B \u2192 output 'No'.\n\nThus, the code must do this.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran code now needs to:\n\n1. Generate the first program's output as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n2. Extract the first token from that string.\n\n3. Check if that token contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\nAfter building output_str with newlines and spaces:\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, ' ' // char(10) // char(9))\n\nif (first_whitespace_pos ==0) then\n\n   first_token = trim(output_str)\n\nelse\n\n   first_token = output_str(1:first_whitespace_pos-1)\n\nend if\n\nThen check:\n\nif (index(first_token, 'A') >0 .and. index(first_token, 'B') >0) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nNow, the code for building output_str must include the newlines.\n\nSo revisiting the code for building output_str:\n\noutput_str starts as ''\n\nfor each j from 1 to count:\n\n   write(temp_str, '(i0, 1x)') numbers(j) \u2192 this gives the number followed by a space.\n\n   then append a newline (char(10)).\n\nThus:\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // char(10)\n\nWait, but the first iteration:\n\ntemp_str is '6 ' (from writing i0 and 1x), then adding char(10) \u2192 '6 \\n'.\n\nSecond iteration: '3 \\n', etc.\n\nThus, the output_str will have each line as number followed by space and newline.\n\nNow, the code for the first_whitespace_pos:\n\ncharacters = ' ' // char(10) // char(9)\n\nfirst_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, characters)\n\nSo the first occurrence of any of those characters.\n\nIn the first line's first character is '6', then the second is ' ', so first_whitespace_pos is 2.\n\nThus, first_token is '6'.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe full Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, i, j, count, max_size = 100000\n\n   integer, dimension(max_size) :: numbers\n\n   character(len=10) :: temp_str\n\n   character(len=1000000) :: output_str\n\n   character(len=1000000) :: first_token\n\n   integer :: first_whitespace_pos\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   count =1\n\n   numbers(1) =n\n\n   m =n\n\n   do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n      if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n          count = count +1\n\n          numbers(count) =i\n\n          m =i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   output_str = ''\n\n   do j=1, count\n\n      write(temp_str, '(i0, 1x)') numbers(j)\n\n      output_str = trim(output_str) // temp_str // char(10)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Extract first token\n\n   first_whitespace_pos = scan(output_str, ' ' // char(10) // char(9))\n\n   if (first_whitespace_pos ==0) then\n\n      first_token = trim(output_str)\n\n   else\n\n      first_token = output_str(1:first_whitespace_pos-1)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Check for 'A' and 'B'\n\n   if (index(first_token, 'A') >0 .and. index(first_token, 'B') >0) then\n\n      print *, 'Yes'\n\n   else\n\n      print *, 'No'\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nTest case 1: n=1.\n\nFirst program's output:\n\n1 followed by space and newline.\n\nThen loop from 0 downto 1 (doesn't run).\n\nSo output_str is \"1 \\n\".\n\nFirst_whitespace_pos is 2 (the space after '1').\n\nfirst_token is '1'.\n\nCheck for A and B \u2192 No.\n\nTest case 2: n=2.\n\nFirst program's output:\n\n2 followed by space and newline.\n\nThen i=1:\n\nm=2 mod 1 is 0 \u2192 print 1 followed by space and newline.\n\nSo output_str is \"2 \\n1 \\n\".\n\nFirst token is '2' \u2192 No.\n\nAnother test case where the first token contains 'A' and 'B'? Not possible with the first program's output, but the code must handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: n=0? But the first Java program reads n as an integer, but in the loop i starts from n-1. If n is 0, the loop won't run. But the problem's input constraints may not allow n=0.\n\nAssuming n is a positive integer.\n\nAnother case: n=24.\n\nThe first program's output would be 24, then 12, 6, 3, 1 (assuming the path of divisors).\n\nBut the first token is '24', which doesn't have A/B \u2192 No.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases correctly."
