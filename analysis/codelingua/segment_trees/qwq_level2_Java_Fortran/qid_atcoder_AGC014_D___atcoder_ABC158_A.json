    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_AGC014_D. It reads an input which is a tree structure (since it's n-1 edges for n nodes). The main function constructs an adjacency list for the tree and then calls a maxMatching function. The result is used to determine if the output is \"Second\" or \"First\" based on whether 2*m equals n. The maxMatching function seems to be calculating some kind of matching in the tree, probably a maximum matching, and returns a value that's divided by 2 to get m. The output is based on whether 2m equals n.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC158_A, takes a string input and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B', outputting \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly. Wait, but how do these two programs connect? The output of the first must be the input of the second. But looking at the first program's output, it's either \"Second\" or \"First\". The second program expects a string input, probably from the first's output. So the first program's output is the input for the second. The second program then checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since \"First\" has 'F' and 'i' etc., but no 'A' or 'B', and \"Second\" has 'S' and 'e' etc., so the second program would output \"No\" in both cases. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is either \"First\" or \"Second\". The second program checks if the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since neither \"First\" nor \"Second\" contains both A and B, the second program would output \"No\" in either case. But maybe the actual input to the first program is such that the first's output is a string that the second can process. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string that the second program reads as its input. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the combined Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through both steps, and output the final result of the second step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the tree data), process it through the first's logic to get the first's output (either \"First\" or \"Second\"), then pass that string to the second's logic (checking for A and B), and output the second's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and n-1 edges).\n2. Compute the first's result (the \"First\" or \"Second\" string).\n3. Use that string as input to the second's logic (check if it contains A and B).\n4. Output the second's result (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must combine both steps without I/O in between. The first part's output is an intermediate string, which is then processed by the second part's logic.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first Java program's main steps:\n\n- Read n, then n-1 edges, build adjacency lists.\n- Compute maxMatching starting at node 0 (assuming root is 0?), then m is the result divided by 2.\n- Output \"Second\" if 2*m == n, else \"First\".\n\nThe maxMatching function is a recursive function. Let's see what it does. The function returns a value that's used to compute m. Let me try to understand the function:\n\nThe function maxMatching(v, p) returns an integer. Let's see:\n\nFor each child w of v (excluding parent p), recursively call maxMatching(w, v). The return value r for each child is processed as:\n\na += r / 2\n\no += r % 2\n\nThen the return value is 2*a + min(1, o) + 1.\n\nHmm, this seems like a calculation for maximum matching in a tree. The function might be using some dynamic programming approach. The exact details might be tricky, but for the Fortran translation, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nIn Fortran, recursion can be done, but sometimes it's better to use iterative approaches if stack depth is an issue, but given that n can be up to... Well, the first Java program's input is a tree, so the recursion depth would be the tree's height, which for n nodes is O(n) in the worst case. But Fortran's stack might handle that, but perhaps better to proceed with recursion as per the original code.\n\nFirst, the adjacency list. In Java, it's an array of ArrayLists. In Fortran, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as a list of lists. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays, but for a tree with n nodes, we can preallocate arrays. Alternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of linked lists, but in Fortran, this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges is n-1, the adjacency list can be stored as a list of nodes for each node. Let's think of using an array of linked lists, but in Fortran, perhaps using a dynamic array approach with a maximum size.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are given as pairs, we can read all edges and build an adjacency list. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can read all edges first, then for each node, store its neighbors. Since the nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1 (since in Java, a and b are read and subtracted by 1), in Fortran, perhaps nodes are 1-based? Or 0-based? Let's see the Java code: the nodes are 0-based (since a and b are read and subtracted by 1). So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 0-based indices as well.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so maybe we can adjust. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read n, then read n-1 edges. Each edge is between a and b (0-based in Java). So in Fortran, perhaps we can read a and b as integers, subtract 1 (if needed?), but maybe just keep them as 0-based.\n\nThe adjacency list can be represented as an array of linked lists. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges is n-1, the maximum number of neighbors per node is up to n-1, but in practice, for a tree, each node has degree up to n-1 (but that's only for the root). Hmm, but for a tree, the average degree is 2 (since total edges are n-1). So perhaps using a dynamic array approach with a fixed size array for each node's neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps we can use a list of lists. Since Fortran 90+ allows allocatable arrays, perhaps we can have an array of pointers to lists, but that's complicated. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges is n-1, we can preallocate an array for each node's neighbors. Let's think of using an array of lists, where each list is an array of integers. For example, for each node, we can have an array of integers, and a count of how many neighbors it has.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, for each edge a-b, we can add b to a's list and a to b's list. So in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array of lists. Let's say we have an array of integers for each node's neighbors. Let's first read all edges, then build the adjacency list.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the steps for the first part:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n-1 lines, each with two integers a and b (0-based in Java, so in Fortran, perhaps read as a and b, then store as 0-based).\n\nWe can create an adjacency list as an array of linked lists. Alternatively, since Fortran doesn't have linked lists, perhaps we can use a list of lists with a fixed maximum size. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read all edges, then for each node, count the number of neighbors, then allocate arrays accordingly. But that requires two passes. Alternatively, since the edges are read in sequence, we can first count the number of edges per node, then allocate arrays, then read again. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, use a dynamic approach with a list of lists.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum number of edges per node is n-1 (but that's only for the root in a star-shaped tree), but for n up to, say, 1e5, this might be too big. Wait, but the problem's constraints aren't given. Since the original Java code uses ArrayLists, which are dynamic, but in Fortran, perhaps for the problem's constraints, we can assume n is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum n is small enough that we can use a 2D array with a fixed size. Let's see, but maybe it's better to use a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use a list of lists by using an array of pointers to arrays. But that's more complex. Alternatively, use a 2D array where each row is a node's neighbors, and the first element is the count. For example, for each node v, the array adj(v,1) is the number of neighbors, and adj(v,2: ...) are the neighbors. But this requires knowing the maximum possible size.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, perhaps we can read all edges first, store them in a list, then build the adjacency list. Let's think of the following steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n-1 edges, storing them in an array of pairs.\n\nThen, for each node from 0 to n-1, count how many edges are connected to it, then allocate an array for each node's neighbors.\n\nBut in Fortran, this would require two passes over the edges. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read all edges into an array:\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: edges\n\nallocate(edges(2, n-1))\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n\n   read *, a, b\n\n   edges(1,i) = a-1  ! since Java subtracts 1, so in Fortran, if the input is 1-based, we need to adjust to 0-based.\n\n   edges(2,i) = b-1\n\nend do\n\nThen, for each node, count the number of edges connected to it:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: count\n\ncount = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n\n   a = edges(1,i)\n\n   b = edges(2,i)\n\n   count(a) = count(a) + 1\n\n   count(b) = count(b) + 1\n\nend do\n\nThen, allocate the adjacency lists:\n\ntype adj_list\n\n   integer, dimension(:), pointer :: neighbors\n\nend type\n\ntype(adj_list), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\ndo v = 0, n-1\n\n   allocate(g(v)%neighbors(0:count(v)-1))\n\n   g(v)%neighbors = 0  ! Initialize to zero, but need to fill in.\n\nend do\n\nThen, go through edges again and fill the adjacency lists:\n\ninteger :: ptr(0:n-1) = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n\n   a = edges(1,i)\n\n   b = edges(2,i)\n\n   g(a)%neighbors(ptr(a)) = b\n\n   ptr(a) = ptr(a) + 1\n\n   g(b)%neighbors(ptr(b)) = a\n\n   ptr(b) = ptr(b) + 1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this requires a pointer array to track the current position in each neighbor array. Hmm, this might be a bit involved, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Maybe using a list of lists with a fixed maximum size. Let's see, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, since the maxMatching function is recursive and only needs to traverse the tree, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as a list of linked lists, but in Fortran, perhaps using a 2D array where each row is a node's neighbors, and the first element is the count. For example, for each node v, the array adj(v,1) is the number of neighbors, and adj(v,2: ...) are the neighbors. But this requires that the maximum number of neighbors per node is known in advance. Since the edges are read first, we can precompute the maximum count, then allocate accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of neighbors per node is not too big, so we can use a large enough array. For example, if n is up to 1e4, then a 1e4 x 1e4 array is too big, but maybe the problem's constraints are smaller. Since the original Java code uses ArrayLists, which can grow dynamically, but in Fortran, perhaps the problem's test cases are small enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first Java program's maxMatching function can be translated into a recursive function in Fortran, using the adjacency list as an array of lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency list can be represented as a list of lists using a 1D array with pointers. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency list can be stored as a list of nodes for each node, using a dynamic array approach. Since Fortran 90 allows allocatable arrays, perhaps for each node, we can have an array that is dynamically allocated as needed. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read all edges and build the adjacency list:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate an array of pointers to lists:\n\ntype :: node_list\n\n   integer, dimension(:), pointer :: neighbors => null()\n\nend type\n\ntype(node_list), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\nThen, for each edge a-b, add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamically growing arrays can be done by reallocation. So for each edge:\n\nRead a and b (0-based).\n\nThen, for node a:\n\ncurrent_length = size(g(a)%neighbors)\n\nallocate(temp(current_length + 1))\n\nif (associated(g(a)%neighbors)) then\n\n   temp(1:current_length) = g(a)%neighbors\n\n   deallocate(g(a)%neighbors)\n\nend if\n\ntemp(current_length + 1) = b\n\ng(a)%neighbors => temp\n\nSimilarly for node b.\n\nBut this is a bit tedious, but manageable. However, this approach may be slow for large n, but given that the original Java code uses ArrayLists, which are similar, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pre-allocate a large enough array for each node's neighbors. Let's say the maximum possible neighbors per node is n (though in a tree, it's at most n-1 for a star-shaped tree). So for each node, we can pre-allocate an array of size n, and track the current count.\n\nSo for each node v, have an array of size n, and a count variable. Then, when adding a neighbor, just append to the array and increment the count.\n\nThis might be easier. Let's try this approach.\n\nInitialize for each node v:\n\ng(v)%count = 0\n\ng(v)%neighbors(1:n) = 0\n\nThen, for each edge a-b:\n\ng(a)%neighbors(g(a)%count + 1) = b\n\ng(a)%count = g(a)%count + 1\n\ng(b)%neighbors(g(b)%count + 1) = a\n\ng(b)%count = g(b)%count + 1\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So perhaps we can have a structure for each node:\n\ntype node_type\n\n   integer :: count = 0\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: neighbors\n\nend type\n\ntype(node_type), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\nThen, for each edge a-b:\n\nallocate a temporary array for a's neighbors, append b, then re-allocate.\n\nWait, but this requires dynamic allocation. Let's see:\n\nFor each edge a and b:\n\nFirst, for node a:\n\ncurrent_count = g(a)%count\n\nallocate(temp(current_count + 1))\n\nif (allocated(g(a)%neighbors)) then\n\n   temp(1:current_count) = g(a)%neighbors\n\n   deallocate(g(a)%neighbors)\n\nend if\n\ntemp(current_count + 1) = b\n\ng(a)%neighbors => temp\n\ng(a)%count = current_count + 1\n\nSimilarly for node b.\n\nThis is manageable but requires some code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pre-allocate a large array for each node's neighbors. Let's say the maximum possible is n (since in a tree, a node can have up to n-1 edges). So for each node, we can have an array of size n, and track the count.\n\nSo:\n\ntype node_type\n\n   integer :: count = 0\n\n   integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: neighbors  ! Assuming 0-based indices, but maybe 1-based?\n\nend type\n\ntype(node_type), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\nThen, for each edge a-b:\n\ng(a)%neighbors(g(a)%count + 1) = b\n\ng(a)%count = g(a)%count + 1\n\ng(b)%neighbors(g(b)%count + 1) = a\n\ng(b)%count = g(b)%count + 1\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. So if the array is dimension(0:n-1), then the indices are 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, the first element is 1. Hmm, perhaps better to use 1-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's make the neighbors array 1-based. So for each node v, the neighbors are stored in neighbors(1:count). So:\n\ntype node_type\n\n   integer :: count = 0\n\n   integer, dimension(1:n) :: neighbors  ! Assuming maximum n neighbors (though in a tree, it's n-1)\n\nend type\n\ntype(node_type), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\nThen, for each edge a and b:\n\ng(a)%count = g(a)%count + 1\n\ng(a)%neighbors(g(a)%count) = b\n\ng(b)%count = g(b)%count + 1\n\ng(b)%neighbors(g(b)%count) = a\n\nThis way, each time adding a neighbor, we just increment the count and assign the new neighbor to the next position. Since the maximum possible count is n-1, which is less than n, this should work.\n\nThis approach requires pre-allocating the array with size n for each node's neighbors. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5, this might be memory intensive. But given that the original Java code uses ArrayLists, which are dynamic, perhaps the problem's constraints are small enough. Alternatively, maybe the problem's test cases are small, so this is acceptable.\n\nAssuming this approach is feasible, let's proceed.\n\nNow, the next part is the maxMatching function. The Java function is recursive:\n\nstatic int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n\n    int a = 0;\n\n    int o = 0;\n\n    for (int w : g[v]) {\n\n        if (w == p) continue;\n\n        int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n\n        a += r / 2;\n\n        o += r % 2;\n\n    }\n\n    return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, recursion is possible, but let's see how to translate this.\n\nThe function takes v and p (parent node), and returns an integer.\n\nThe loop over the neighbors of v (excluding p) is needed.\n\nIn Fortran, the function would be something like:\n\nrecursive function max_matching(v, p) result(res)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: v, p\n\n   integer :: res, a, o, w, r\n\n   a = 0\n\n   o = 0\n\n   do i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n      w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n      if (w == p) cycle\n\n      r = max_matching(w, v)\n\n      a = a + r / 2\n\n      o = o + mod(r, 2)\n\n   end do\n\n   res = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the function must be declared before use, so we need to have the function defined properly.\n\nNow, the main part of the first program:\n\nAfter building the adjacency list, call max_matching(0, -1). Wait, but in Java, the parent p is initially -1 (since the root has no parent). In Fortran, the nodes are 0-based, so the parent can be -1, but in Fortran integers are typically 0 or positive. Wait, but in the code, the parent is passed as -1 to indicate no parent. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use -1 as the initial parent.\n\nWait, but in the loop over the neighbors, when checking if w == p, if p is -1, then the first node (0) will have p as -1, so all its neighbors are considered except none (since p is -1, which is not equal to any neighbor's index (0-based)). So that's okay.\n\nSo the call would be m = max_matching(0, -1) / 2\n\nThen, check if 2*m == n, output \"Second\" else \"First\".\n\nSo the first part's output is a string, which is then the input to the second program.\n\nNow, the second Java program takes a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, the second part's logic is straightforward: take the string (either \"First\" or \"Second\"), check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThe string \"First\" has characters 'F', 'i', 'r', 's', 't' (assuming lowercase?), but in Java, the check is case-sensitive. The original Java code uses 'A' and 'B' in uppercase. The first program's output is \"Second\" or \"First\", which have uppercase first letters, but the rest are lowercase. So \"Second\" has 'S', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'n', 'd' \u2014 no 'A' or 'B'. \"First\" has 'F', 'i', etc. So neither contains both 'A' and 'B', so the second program would output \"No\".\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's input is either \"First\" or \"Second\", which do not contain both 'A' and 'B', so the output is \"No\".\n\nBut the user wants the Fortran program to replicate the entire sequence. So the Fortran program must read the first's input, compute the first's output, then process it through the second's logic, and output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and edges).\n\n2. Compute the first's output (the string \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\n3. Use that string as input to the second's logic (check for 'A' and 'B').\n\n4. Output the second's result (\"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\n- Read n and edges.\n\n- Build adjacency list.\n\n- Compute max_matching(0, -1), get m, then determine first_result.\n\n- Then, check if first_result contains both 'A' and 'B' (but since it's \"First\" or \"Second\", it won't, so output \"No\").\n\nWait, but the second program's logic is exactly that. So in Fortran, after getting the first_result string, we can check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are handled with character arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe first_result is either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\nWe can represent this as a character string.\n\nThen, check if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIn Fortran, to check for presence of a character in a string, we can use the INDEX function.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: first_result\n\nif (index(first_result, 'A') > 0 .and. index(first_result, 'B') > 0) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nBut in our case, first_result is either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n\"First\" has no 'A' or 'B', so index would be 0 for both.\n\n\"Second\" has 'S', so also no 'A' or 'B'.\n\nThus, the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is different? Let me recheck the first Java code's output.\n\nThe first Java program's output is:\n\nout.println(2 * m == n ? \"Second\" : \"First\");\n\nSo when 2*m equals n, output \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nSo the first_result is either \"Second\" or \"First\".\n\nNeither contains both 'A' and 'B', so the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's strange. So regardless of the input, the second program's output is \"No\". But perhaps the problem's actual test cases have different inputs where the first program's output contains both letters. But according to the given Java code, the first program's output is either \"First\" or \"Second\", so the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the second Java program again.\n\nThe second Java program's code is:\n\npublic void solve(int testNumber, Scanner in, PrintWriter out) {\n\n    String s = in.next();\n\n    if (s.contains(\"A\") && s.contains(\"B\")) {\n\n        out.println(\"Yes\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        out.println(\"No\");\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the 'contains' method in Java is case-sensitive. The first program's output is \"First\" or \"Second\", which have uppercase first letters but lowercase rest. So \"First\" has 'F', 'i', 'r', 's', 't' \u2014 no 'A' or 'B'. \"Second\" has 'S', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'n', 'd' \u2014 no 'A' or 'B'. So indeed, the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the combined Fortran program will always output \"No\", regardless of the input. But that's only if the first program's output is always \"First\" or \"Second\". But perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output can have other strings? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nThe first program's output is determined by 2*m == n. So m is maxMatching(0, -1)/2. The maxMatching function returns an integer, which when divided by 2 gives m. The condition is whether 2*m equals n. So if the maxMatching returns exactly 2*m = n, then output \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nBut the second program's input is that string, so the output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to read the first's input, compute the first's result, then output \"No\".\n\nWait, but that's a shortcut. But according to the problem's instruction, we must translate the entire sequence, so even if the second program's output is always \"No\", we have to do it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not \"First\" or \"Second\", but maybe the code has a typo. Let me check the first Java code's output line:\n\nout.println(2 * m == n ? \"Second\" : \"First\");\n\nYes, so when 2*m equals n, output \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nSo the first's output is either \"Second\" or \"First\".\n\nThus, the second program's input is one of those two strings, which do not contain both 'A' and 'B', so the second's output is always \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the entire Fortran program can be written to read the first's input, compute the first's result, then output \"No\".\n\nBut the problem requires translating the entire sequence, so even if the second's output is always \"No\", we have to do it properly.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first's input (n and edges).\n\n- Compute the first's result (the string).\n\n- Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n- Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nBut since the first's result is either \"First\" or \"Second\", the check will always be false, so output \"No\".\n\nBut to follow the problem's instructions, we must do it step by step.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, a, b, i, m, res\n\n   character(len=10) :: first_result\n\n   !

Now process through second program's logic\n\n   if (contains_AB(first_result)) then\n\n      print *, \"Yes\"\n\n   else\n\n      print *, \"No\"\n\n   end if\n\ncontains\n\n   ! Define the max_matching function and any other subroutines\n\n   recursive function max_matching(v, p) result(r)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: v, p\n\n      integer :: r, a, o, i, w\n\n      a = 0\n\n      o = 0\n\n      do i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n         w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n         if (w == p) cycle\n\n         r = max_matching(w, v)\n\n         a = a + r / 2\n\n         o = o + mod(r, 2)\n\n      end do\n\n      r = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\n   end function\n\n   ! Define the adjacency list structure and variables\n\n   type node_type\n\n      integer :: count = 0\n\n      integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: neighbors  ! Wait, but n is variable. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, here's a problem. In Fortran, the size of the array in the node_type must be known at compile time, but n is read at runtime. So this approach won't work. Oh right, this is a critical issue.\n\nHmm, so the previous approach of using a fixed size array for neighbors won't work because n is variable. So I need a different way to handle the adjacency list.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a dynamic array for each node's neighbors. Since Fortran allows allocatable arrays, perhaps we can do this.\n\nLet me redefine the node_type as:\n\ntype node_type\n\n   integer :: count = 0\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: neighbors\n\nend type\n\ntype(node_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: g\n\nThen, after reading n, allocate g as 0:n-1 (since nodes are 0-based):\n\nallocate(g(0:n-1))\n\nThen, for each node, when adding a neighbor, we can reallocate the array as needed.\n\nSo for each edge a-b:\n\nFirst, for node a:\n\ncurrent_count = g(a)%count\n\nallocate(temp(current_count + 1))\n\nif (allocated(g(a)%neighbors)) then\n\n   temp(1:current_count) = g(a)%neighbors\n\n   deallocate(g(a)%neighbors)\n\nend if\n\ntemp(current_count + 1) = b\n\ng(a)%neighbors => temp\n\ng(a)%count = current_count + 1\n\nSimilarly for node b.\n\nThis way, each time a neighbor is added, the array is reallocated. This is manageable but requires some code.\n\nAlternatively, pre-allocate a large enough array. For example, assuming n is up to 1e5, but that's memory intensive. Alternatively, use a linked list approach, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, use a list of lists with a fixed maximum size. But since n is variable, this is tricky.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to use the dynamic allocation approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, a, b, i, res, m\n\n   character(len=10) :: first_result\n\n   type node_type\n\n      integer :: count = 0\n\n      integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: neighbors\n\n   end type node_type\n\n   type(node_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: g\n\n   ! Read n\n\n   read *, n\n\n   ! Allocate the array of nodes\n\n   allocate(g(0:n-1))\n\n   ! Read n-1 edges\n\n   do i = 1, n-1\n\n      read *, a, b\n\n      a = a - 1  ! Convert to 0-based\n\n      b = b - 1\n\n      ! Add b to a's neighbors\n\n      call add_neighbor(g(a), b)\n\n      ! Add a to b's neighbors\n\n      call add_neighbor(g(b), a)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Compute max_matching(0, -1)\n\n   res = max_matching(0, -1)\n\n   m = res / 2\n\n   if (2*m == n) then\n\n      first_result = \"Second\"\n\n   else\n\n      first_result = \"First\"\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Process through second program's logic\n\n   if (contains_AB(first_result)) then\n\n      print *, \"Yes\"\n\n   else\n\n      print *, \"No\"\n\n   end if\n\ncontains\n\n   subroutine add_neighbor(node, neighbor)\n\n      type(node_type), intent(inout) :: node\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: neighbor\n\n      integer :: current_count, new_count\n\n      integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: temp\n\n      current_count = node%count\n\n      new_count = current_count + 1\n\n      allocate(temp(new_count))\n\n      if (allocated(node%neighbors)) then\n\n         temp(1:current_count) = node%neighbors\n\n         deallocate(node%neighbors)\n\n      end if\n\n      temp(new_count) = neighbor\n\n      node%neighbors => temp\n\n      node%count = new_count\n\n   end subroutine add_neighbor\n\n   recursive function max_matching(v, p) result(r)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: v, p\n\n      integer :: r, a, o, i, w\n\n      a = 0\n\n      o = 0\n\n      do i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n         w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n         if (w == p) cycle\n\n         r = max_matching(w, v)\n\n         a = a + r / 2\n\n         o = o + mod(r, 2)\n\n      end do\n\n      r = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\n   end function max_matching\n\n   logical function contains_AB(s)\n\n      character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n      contains_AB = (index(s, 'A') > 0) .and. (index(s, 'B') > 0)\n\n   end function contains_AB\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the max_matching function, the 'r' variable is used both as the return value and as the result of the recursive call. That's a problem. Let me see:\n\nInside the function:\n\ndo i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n   w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n   if (w == p) cycle\n\n   r = max_matching(w, v)  ! Here, r is assigned the result of the recursive call.\n\n   a = a + r / 2\n\n   o = o + mod(r, 2)\n\nend do\n\nThen, after the loop:\n\nr = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\nBut the 'r' variable is being used both for the recursive result and the return value. This will cause an issue because the first assignment to r (inside the loop) overwrites the return value. So we need to use a different variable name for the recursive result.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\nInside the function:\n\ndo i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n   w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n   if (w == p) cycle\n\n   integer :: temp_r\n\n   temp_r = max_matching(w, v)\n\n   a = a + temp_r / 2\n\n   o = o + mod(temp_r, 2)\n\nend do\n\nr = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\nSo the corrected function:\n\nrecursive function max_matching(v, p) result(r)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: v, p\n\n   integer :: r, a, o, i, w, temp_r\n\n   a = 0\n\n   o = 0\n\n   do i = 1, g(v)%count\n\n      w = g(v)%neighbors(i)\n\n      if (w == p) cycle\n\n      temp_r = max_matching(w, v)\n\n      a = a + temp_r / 2\n\n      o = o + mod(temp_r, 2)\n\n   end do\n\n   r = 2*a + min(1, o) + 1\n\nend function max_matching\n\nThat should fix the variable conflict.\n\nNow, the contains_AB function uses the INDEX function. In Fortran, the INDEX function is case-sensitive. The first_result strings are \"First\" and \"Second\", which have uppercase first letters and lowercase others. The check for 'A' and 'B' (uppercase) would return false. So the function will return false, leading to \"No\".\n\nThus, the program will always output \"No\".\n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, we must translate the sequence exactly, so even if the second program's output is always \"No\", the code must be written as per the steps.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\n- The add_neighbor subroutine must correctly handle the dynamic allocation.\n\n- The max_matching function must correctly traverse the tree.\n\n- The first_result is assigned correctly based on the condition.\n\n- The contains_AB function checks for uppercase 'A' and 'B'.\n\nYes, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program would look like this."
