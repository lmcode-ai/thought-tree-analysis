Alternatively, in code: rev_s = ''\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n   rev_s = rev_s // s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nSo, in the code, after building temp_str, we can reverse it to get next_str.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C). It reads an integer N from input. Then it starts with a number i = 357 and counts how many numbers up to N meet certain conditions. The loop continues by generating the next number in some way. The conditions are that the number's string representation contains '3', '5', and '7'. Also, there's some logic with a StringBuilder to build the next number. The loop continues until i exceeds N. The count c is printed at the end.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC149_C) takes an input x. If x is not 2 and even, it increments to the next odd. Then it finds the next prime number greater than or equal to x. The output is that prime.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the count c) is the x in the second program. Therefore, the Fortran program must first compute c based on the initial input N, then compute the next prime as per the second program using c as x, and finally output that prime.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read N from input, compute c, then compute the next prime starting from c, and output that prime. The intermediate steps (computing c and then the prime) must be done without I/O except for the initial read and final print.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first part: translating the first Java program into Fortran code that computes c given N. Let's see the steps:\n\nThe first program's main loop starts with i = 357. Then, while i <= N, check if the string of i contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c. Then generate the next i by some process with the string.\n\nThe next i is generated by building a new number from the current i's digits. The process is a bit tricky. Let me parse the Java code for generating the next i:\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder. The loop over the digits (from the end, since it's s.length()-1 -j). The logic is:\n\n- For each character in the reversed string (since the loop is from the end), starting from the last digit (the first character in the reversed string?), the code checks if 'f' is true. Initially, f is false.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nThe string s is the current i as a string. Then, the loop is for j from 0 to s.length()-1. The character a is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0, it's the last character of s (the least significant digit?), then j=1 is the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the digits from the end towards the start.\n\nThe code builds a new string in sb. The variable f starts as false. For each character a (starting from the last digit):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- if a is '3', then append '5' to sb, set f to true.\n\n- else if a is '5', append '7' and set f to true.\n\n- else, append '3'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') then append '5', set f to true.\n\nElse if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\nElse, append '3'.\n\nWait, but the else is for when a is not 3 or 5? So for any other digit (like 7?), it appends '3'? Hmm, that's part of the logic.\n\nWait, but after that, if f is still false after processing all characters, then append a '3' to the end.\n\nWait, the code after the loop says:\n\nif (!f) then append 3.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nAfter the loop over all characters, if f is false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5?), then append a '3' to the sb.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed (since the code uses sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb), then reverse it, and parse as a long to get the next i.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nThe code builds the next number as follows:\n\nTake the current i's string s.\n\nProcess each character from the end (since the loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1, and the character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So the first character processed is the last digit of the original number.\n\nThe processing is:\n\nFor each character in reverse order (starting from the last digit):\n\n- if f is false:\n\n   if the current character is '3', then replace it with '5', set f to true.\n\n   else if it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n   else, replace with '3'.\n\n- else (f is true):\n\n   just append the current character as is.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5?), then append a '3' to the end.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed (since the code uses sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb), then reverse it. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nsb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); // copies the current sb into sb2.\n\nThen, i = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, so the sb is built in a certain way, then reversed again? Let me see:\n\nWait, the code builds the sb as follows:\n\nSuppose the original number is 357 (the starting point). Let's see:\n\ns is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (so the digits are processed in reverse order: 7,5,3.\n\nWait, the first character (j=0) is s.length()-1 -0 = 2, so s.charAt(2) is '7'.\n\nThen j=1: s.charAt(1) is '5'.\n\nj=2: s.charAt(0) is '3'.\n\nProcessing each in order of 7,5,3.\n\nLet's walk through the first iteration (i=357):\n\nInitial i is 357. s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nStart with f = false.\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nSince f is false, check if a is 3? No. 5? No. So append '3' to sb. f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\na is '5', so since f is still false, we check: a is 5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nNow f is true, so append the character as is (3).\n\nSo the sb after processing all characters is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second step) + \"3\" (third step) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nWait, but the order is the processing is from the end, so the first character processed is the last digit (7), then 5, then 3. The sb is built in the order of processing, so the first character added is '3' (from the first step), then '7', then '3', so the sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true (because of the second character), the 'if (!f)' condition is false, so no appending 3.\n\nThen, the sb2 is a copy of sb (\"373\"), then reversed. Wait, no: the code does sb2.reverse().toString(). Wait, the code is:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is \"373\", then sb2 is a copy of that. Then reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\". So the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the original? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think again. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code builds the next number as follows:\n\nThe process is:\n\nTake the current number's digits, process them from the end (right to left), and build a new string. The new string is then reversed again to form the next number?\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nAfter building the sb (the new digits in some order), then the code creates a new StringBuffer (sb2) from sb, reverses it, and parses that as the next i.\n\nWait, so the sb is built in the order of processing the digits from the end (so the first character added to sb is the last digit of the original number, then the second last, etc.), but then when reversed, the digits are in the original order?\n\nWait, let's see with the example:\n\nOriginal number is 357 \u2192 s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 since a is 7 (not 3 or 5?), so append '3' \u2192 sb is \"3\".\n\nf remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\na is 5 \u2192 since f is still false, append '7', set f to true \u2192 sb becomes \"37\".\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append the original character (3) \u2192 sb becomes \"373\".\n\nThen, the sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, the code does sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb) \u2192 which is \"373\".\n\nThen, reverse it \u2192 \"373\" reversed is still \"373\".\n\nSo the next i is 373. So the next number is 373.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the original? Hmm, but the original was 357. So the next number is 373. So the process is generating numbers by modifying the digits in a certain way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the algorithm is generating numbers that have 3,5,7 in their digits, but in a way that builds up the digits. The loop continues until i exceeds N, counting how many numbers up to N have all three digits.\n\nThe key is to translate this logic into Fortran.\n\nNow, the second program takes the count c (from the first program) as x, and finds the next prime after x (if x is even and not 2, it starts at x+1, then checks primes).\n\nSo the Fortran program must first compute c given N, then compute the next prime starting from c, and output that.\n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first program's main loop:\n\nInitialize i = 357, c =0.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\nCheck if the string of i contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c.\n\nThen generate the next i via the string processing.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to handle numbers as strings, process their digits, etc.\n\nFortran has string functions, but handling digits might be a bit involved.\n\nFirst, the count c is initialized to 0.\n\nThe loop starts with i = 357. We need to loop while i <= N.\n\nFor each i:\n\nCheck if the string representation contains '3', '5', and '7'.\n\nTo check this, we can convert the number to a string, then check for presence of each character.\n\nThen, generate the next i.\n\nThe next i is generated by processing the digits of the current i in reverse order (from least significant to most), applying the rules, then reversing again?\n\nWait, the process is:\n\nTake the current i as a string s.\n\nProcess each character from the end (so the last digit first), building a new string according to the rules.\n\nThen, reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nAfter building the sb (the new digits in the order of processing from the end), then the code reverses it again to form the next i.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the digits from the end (so the first character added to sb is the last digit of the original number, then the second last, etc.), then the sb is reversed again (because of the reverse() in the parseLong call).\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong( sb2.reverse().toString() )\n\nwhere sb2 is a copy of sb. So the sb is first built in the order of processing the digits from the end (so the first character in sb is the last digit of the original number), then reversed again, so the digits are in the original order?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 357 \u2192 s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 append '3' (since it's not 3 or 5?), so sb starts with '3'.\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 since f is false, append '7', set f to true \u2192 sb is now '37'.\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 since f is true, append '3' \u2192 sb is '373'.\n\nThen, the sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, when reversed, it becomes \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, so the next i is the same as the sb's value? Because reversing \"373\" gives the same string.\n\nHmm, but in this case, the next i is 373, which is the same as the sb's value. So perhaps the reverse is redundant here, but in other cases, it might matter.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Suppose the current i is 357, and after processing, the sb is \"373\", then reversing gives the same. But if the sb was \"357\", then reversing would give \"753\".\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that the new number is formed by taking the digits in the order of processing (from the end), then reversing them again to form the next number. So the processing is building the next number's digits in reverse order, then reversing to get the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the algorithm is building the next number by appending digits in a certain way, but the exact steps need to be followed.\n\nIn any case, to translate this into Fortran, I need to:\n\nFor each i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each character in s from the end (i.e., from the last character to the first).\n\n3. Build a new string according to the rules.\n\n4. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits in reverse order (from the end of s), then the new string is reversed again to form the next i.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe new string is built in the order of processing the digits from the end (so the first character added to the new string is the last digit of the original number), then the new string is reversed again to form the next number.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe code builds the new string (sb) by processing the digits in reverse order (from the end of s). The sb is built in the order of processing (so the first character added is the last digit of s, then the second last, etc.), then the code reverses the sb to get the next number.\n\nWait, no. The code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong( sb2.reverse().toString() )\n\nwhere sb2 is a copy of sb. So the sb is first built in the order of processing (so the first character in sb is the last digit of s), then reversed again, so the final string is the reverse of the sb's content.\n\nWait, that would mean that the next i is the reverse of the sb's content.\n\nWait, let's take the example again:\n\nOriginal s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as \"3\" (from 7), then \"37\" (from 5), then \"373\" (from 3). So the sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing it gives \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: suppose the current i is 373 (from previous step). s is \"373\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false. a is '3', so append '5', set f to true \u2192 sb starts with '5'.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7' \u2192 sb is \"57\".\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 sb becomes \"573\".\n\nThen, reverse the sb \u2192 \"375\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sb is \"573\", then reversed becomes \"375\".\n\nSo the next i would be 375.\n\nWait, so the next i after 373 is 375?\n\nHmm, so the process is:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits from the end, then reversed again to form the next number.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nTake the current number's digits, process them from the end, building a new string according to the rules, then reverse that new string to get the next number.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran would be:\n\nFor each i:\n\n- Convert to string s.\n\n- Process each character in reverse order (from last to first character of s).\n\n- Build a new string (let's call it temp_str) according to the rules.\n\n- Reverse temp_str to get the next i.\n\nWait, but in the code, the sb is built in the order of processing (so the first character added is the last digit of s), then reversed again. So the next i is the reverse of the temp_str.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe new string is built in the order of processing (so the first character in the new string is the last digit of s, then the second last, etc.), then reversed again to form the next i.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe code's steps are:\n\nAfter building the sb (the temp_str), the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong( sb2.reverse().toString() )\n\nwhere sb2 is a copy of sb. So the reverse() is applied to the sb's content, so the next i is the reverse of the temp_str.\n\nWait, so the next i is the reverse of the temp_str.\n\nWait, in the first example, the temp_str was \"373\", reversed gives \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nIn the second example, temp_str is \"573\", reversed gives \"375\".\n\nSo the next i is 375.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nThe next i is the reverse of the temp_str built by processing the digits in reverse order.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Convert current i to string s.\n\n2. Initialize a new string (temp_str) as empty.\n\n3. Initialize f as false.\n\n4. Iterate over each character in s in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n   For each character a in reversed s:\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if a is '3', append '5' to temp_str, set f to true.\n\n      else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3'.\n\n   else:\n\n      append a to temp_str.\n\n5. After processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3' to temp_str.\n\n6. Reverse temp_str to get the next i's string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code's process is that the temp_str is built in the order of processing the reversed digits, then reversed again. So the next i is the reverse of temp_str.\n\nWait, the code's process is:\n\nThe temp_str (sb) is built by processing the reversed digits (so the first character in temp_str is the last digit of s), then the next i is the reverse of temp_str.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe code's process is:\n\nThe temp_str (sb) is built by processing the digits in reverse order (so the first character added is the last digit of s, then the second last, etc.), then the code reverses the temp_str to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong( sb2.reverse().toString() )\n\nwhere sb2 is a copy of sb. So the reverse() is applied to the sb's content, so the next i is the reverse of the temp_str.\n\nTherefore, the next i is the reverse of the temp_str.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nAfter building the temp_str (sb), the next i is the reverse of that string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to compute the next i:\n\n- Take the current i as a string s.\n\n- Process each character in reverse order (from last to first) to build temp_str.\n\n- Then reverse temp_str to get the next i's string, then convert to integer.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the string processing in Fortran.\n\nFortran has functions like LEN_TRIM, and we can use character arrays.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran for the first part (computing c):\n\nRead N from input.\n\nInitialize i = 357, c =0.\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   Convert i to a string s.\n\n   Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   Generate the next i via the process described.\n\n   If the next i exceeds N, break.\n\nWait, but the loop continues until i exceeds N. So the loop is:\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ... process ...\n\n   compute next_i\n\n   i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nwhile (i <= N) { ... compute next i ... }\n\nSo the next i is computed inside the loop, and the loop continues as long as the new i is <= N.\n\nWait, no. The loop condition is checked before each iteration. So the current i is processed (checking if it contains 3,5,7), then the next i is computed, and the loop continues as long as the new i is <= N.\n\nWait, no. The loop is:\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n   ... process current i (check if it has 3,5,7, etc.)\n\n   compute next i.\n\n}\n\nWait, so the next i is computed inside the loop, and the loop continues as long as the new i is <= N? Or the loop continues as long as the current i is <= N?\n\nWait, the loop condition is checked at the start of each iteration. So the current i is the one being processed. The next i is computed, but the loop will continue only if the new i is <= N?\n\nNo, the loop condition is based on the current i before processing. Wait, the code is:\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n   ... process current i (check if it has 3,5,7, etc.)\n\n   compute next i.\n\n}\n\nSo the loop continues as long as the current i is <= N. The next i is computed, but the next iteration's condition is based on the new i.\n\nWait, for example, if the current i is 357 (<= N), then process it, compute next i (say 373). Then, the loop checks if 373 <= N again. So the loop continues as long as the current i (before processing) is <= N.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ni = 357\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ... process current i (check if it has 3,5,7, etc.)\n\n   compute next_i\n\n   i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the next i is computed inside the loop, so the next iteration's i is the new value. So the loop continues as long as the new i is still <= N? No, the loop condition is checked at the start of each iteration. So the first iteration processes i=357, then computes next_i. The next iteration's condition is whether next_i <= N. So the loop continues as long as the new i is <= N.\n\nWait, no. The loop condition is checked at the start of each iteration. So the first iteration's condition is i (initial 357) <= N. Then, after processing, the next_i is computed, and the loop variable i is set to next_i. The next iteration's condition is whether the new i is <= N. So yes, the loop continues as long as the new i is <= N.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop is structured as:\n\ni = 357\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ... process current i (check if it has 3,5,7, etc.)\n\n   compute next_i\n\n   i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code, the next_i is computed inside the loop, so the loop continues as long as the new i is still <= N.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\nFor each i:\n\nCheck if the string contains 3,5,7.\n\nThen compute next_i via the string processing.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement the string processing in Fortran.\n\nFirst, converting the integer i to a string. In Fortran, we can use write(*,*) to a string variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I20)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process each character in reverse order.\n\nWe can loop over the characters from the end to the beginning.\n\nInitialize temp_str as an empty string.\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo j = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n   a = s(j:j)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (a == '3') then\n\n         temp_str = temp_str // '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (a == '5') then\n\n         temp_str = temp_str // '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else\n\n         temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      temp_str = temp_str // a\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, check if f is still false. If so, append '3' to temp_str.\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   temp_str = temp_str // '3'\n\nend if\n\nThen, reverse temp_str to get the next_i's string.\n\nnext_str = reverse(temp_str)\n\nWait, but how to reverse a string in Fortran?\n\nWe can write a function to reverse a string:\n\nfunction reverse_string(s) result(rev_s)\n\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n   character(len=len_trim(s)) :: rev_s\n\n   integer :: i, len_s\n\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n   do i = 1, len_s\n\n      rev_s(i:i) = s(len_s - i + 1:len_s - i + 1)\n\n   end do\n\nend function\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 2003, there's the reverse function, but maybe better to write it manually.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nrev_s = ''\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n   rev_s = rev_s // s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nSo, in the code, after building temp_str, we can reverse it to get next_str.\n\nThen, convert next_str to integer (or long in Java, but in Fortran, since N can be up to 1e18? Wait, the first Java program uses long for i, so the maximum N could be up to 1e18. But in Fortran, integers can be 64-bit (selected_int_kind(18)), so we can use integer(8).\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the initial i is 357, and the loop continues while i <= N. The N is read as an integer (since the first program uses gi() which is Integer.parseInt). Wait, in the first Java program, the N is read via gi(), which is an int. So N is up to 2^31-1. So in Fortran, using integer(8) would be sufficient.\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\ninteger(8) :: i, next_i, N, c\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, temp_str, next_str\n\n...\n\nThen, after building next_str, we can read it as next_i:\n\nread(next_str, *) next_i\n\nBut need to ensure that next_str is a valid number.\n\nNow, the check for containing '3', '5', and '7' in the current i's string.\n\nTo check if the string s contains all three characters, we can:\n\nlogical :: has3, has5, has7\n\nhas3 = .false.\n\nhas5 = .false.\n\nhas7 = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   select case (s(j:j))\n\n   case ('3')\n\n      has3 = .true.\n\n   case ('5')\n\n      has5 = .true.\n\n   case ('7')\n\n      has7 = .true.\n\n   end select\n\nend do\n\nif (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then\n\n   c = c +1\n\nend if\n\nSo that's the check.\n\nPutting this all together, the first part of the Fortran code (computing c) would be:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nc = 0\n\ni = 357_8\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ! Convert i to string s\n\n   write(s, '(I20)') i\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   ! Check if contains 3,5,7\n\n   has3 = .false.\n\n   has5 = .false.\n\n   has7 = .false.\n\n   do j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n      select case (s(j:j))\n\n      case ('3')\n\n         has3 = .true.\n\n      case ('5')\n\n         has5 = .true.\n\n      case ('7')\n\n         has7 = .true.\n\n      end select\n\n   end do\n\n   if (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   end if\n\n   !

If x is not 2 and even, set x to x+1. Then, find the smallest prime >= x.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\nif (x != 2 && x % 2 ==0) x +=1;\n\nthen loop:\n\nwhile true:\n\n   check if x is prime.\n\n   if yes, break.\n\n   else, x +=2 (since even numbers are skipped).\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe code starts with x as input. If x is even and not 2, then x is set to x+1 (making it odd). Then, in a loop:\n\ncompute sqrt(x), then check divisors from 3 to sqrt(x) step 2.\n\nIf any divisor divides x, then x +=2 and repeat.\n\nElse, break and output x.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nthen:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n   x +=2;\n\n}\n\nSo the loop continues until x is a prime.\n\nThe code first checks if x is even and not 2 \u2192 if so, increment to make it odd.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nfor each x, check if it's divisible by any odd number up to sqrt(x). If any divisor found, then x +=2 and repeat.\n\nElse, break and return x.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the second part would be:\n\nx = c\n\nif (x /= 2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x,8))\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, int(sqrt_num), 2\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         is_prime = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, x\n\nWait, but need to handle x=2 case. Let me see:\n\nIf x is 2, then the code's first condition (x !=2 and even) is false, so x remains 2. Then in the loop:\n\nsqrt_num is sqrt(2) ~1.414. The loop from 3 to 1.414 \u2192 the loop doesn't execute. So i starts at 3, but the upper limit is 1.414 \u2192 so the loop doesn't run. Then, after the loop, i is 3. Since 3 > sqrt_num (1.414), so the condition (i > sqrt_num) is true \u2192 break. So x=2 is considered prime.\n\nSo the code works for x=2.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program must read N, compute c via the first part, then compute the next prime starting from c, then output that prime.\n\nSo the full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer(8) :: N, c, i, next_i, x, next_str_len, j, k\n\n   character(len=20) :: s, temp_str, next_str\n\n   logical :: has3, has5, has7, f\n\n   !

Also, in Fortran, when using // operator, the strings may have trailing spaces, so using trim() is important.\n\nWait, in the code for building temp_str and next_str, I added trim() when concatenating. For example:\n\ntemp_str = trim(temp_str) // '5'\n\nBut in Fortran, when you concatenate with //, the left-hand side's trailing spaces are kept, so using trim() ensures that we don't have leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written without trim(), but better to be safe.\n\nAnother thing: in the loop for the second part, the variables i and sqrt_num are declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop. So need to adjust that.\n\nWait, in the second part's loop:\n\nThe code as written has:\n\ndo while (.true.)\n\n   real :: sqrt_num\n\n   sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x,8))\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   logical :: is_prime\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, int(sqrt_num), 2\n\n      if (mod(x,i) ==0) then\n\n         is_prime = .false.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n      exit\n\n   else\n\n      x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop.

So need to avoid variable name conflicts.\n\nAh, right! The variable i is used in the first part's loops (like the loop over j in 1 to len_trim(s)), and also in the second part's loop (the do i=3 ... loop). So in Fortran, variables must have unique names in the same scope.\n\nTherefore, in the first part, the loop variables (like j and k) are okay, but in the second part, the loop variable i is conflicting with the i used in the first part (which is declared as integer(8)).\n\nSo need to rename variables to avoid conflict.\n\nLet me adjust variable names:\n\nIn the first part's loops:\n\nThe loop over the characters in s (for checking 3,5,7):\n\ndo j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\nThe loop for building temp_str:\n\ndo j = len_trim(s), 1, -1\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\nThe loop for reversing temp_str to get next_str:\n\ndo k = len_trim(temp_str), 1, -1\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\nThese variables j and k are okay.\n\nIn the second part's loop:\n\nThe loop variable i is conflicting with the first part's i (which is integer(8)). So need to rename it.\n\nLet's use loop_i instead.\n\nSo in the second part's code:\n\n   do while (.true.)\n\n      sqrt_num = sqrt(real(x,8))\n\n      is_prime = .true.\n\n      do loop_i = 3, int(sqrt_num), 2\n\n         if (mod(x,loop_i) ==0) then\n\n            is_prime = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (is_prime) then\n\n         exit\n\n      else\n\n         x = x +2\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nThus, the variable loop_i is used instead of i.\n\nAlso, in the declarations:\n\n   integer :: loop_i, sqrt_num_int\n\n   real :: sqrt_num\n\n   logical :: is_prime\n\nNow, the variable i in the first part is integer(8), and loop_i is integer, so no conflict.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, the variable i is of type integer(8), but in the second part, x is also integer(8).

Each time, we append characters. The use of trim() is important because when you concatenate with an empty string, it's okay, but when the string has trailing spaces, it might cause issues. However, since we are using trim(temp_str) before appending, it should be okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ntemp_str = trim(temp_str) // '5'\n\nInitially, temp_str is empty, so trim('') is still empty. So the first append is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue is when converting next_str to next_i. The next_str must be a valid number. Since the algorithm is designed to generate numbers, this should be okay.\n\nAnother point: in the first part, the loop continues while i <= N. The next_i is computed and assigned to i. So even if next_i exceeds N, the loop will terminate in the next iteration.\n\nNow, testing with the first example:\n\nSuppose N is 357.\n\nThe first iteration:\n\ni = 357.\n\nCheck if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes. So c becomes 1.\n\nThen compute next_i:\n\nProcessing the digits 3,5,7 in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false. Since a is not 3 or 5, append '3' \u2192 temp_str is '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\na is 5 \u2192 since f is false, append '7', set f to true \u2192 temp_str is '37'.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 temp_str is '373'.\n\nThen, since f was set to true, no appending '3'.\n\nReverse temp_str (373 \u2192 reversed is 373 \u2192 next_str is '373'.\n\nnext_i is 373.\n\nNow, since 373 > 357 (N is 357), the loop condition (i <= N) is false (373 > 357), so the loop exits.\n\nThus, c is 1.\n\nThen, the second part computes x = 1.\n\nSince x is 1 (odd, not 2), the code proceeds.\n\nCheck if 1 is prime? Well, the code's logic:\n\nx starts at 1.\n\nFirst iteration of the loop:\n\nsqrt_num = sqrt(1) = 1.\n\nThe loop for loop_i from 3 to 1 (step 2) \u2192 doesn't run.\n\nThus, is_prime is true? Because the loop didn't find any divisors.\n\nWait, but 1 is not a prime. The code would incorrectly consider it as prime?\n\nWait, the code's logic for x=1:\n\nThe first part of the second program's code:\n\nx is 1. Since it's not 2 and even (1 is odd), so the first condition (x !=2 and even) is false. So x remains 1.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nsqrt_num = sqrt(1) = 1.\n\nThe loop for loop_i from 3 to 1 \u2192 doesn't execute.\n\nThus, the code thinks that 1 is a prime, so it would output 1, which is wrong.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The second Java program's code would handle x=1 correctly?\n\nLet me check the second Java program's code for x=1:\n\nThe code:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) \u2192 1 is not even, so x remains 1.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nsqrtNum = sqrt(1) = 1.\n\nThe for loop starts at i=3, which is larger than sqrtNum (1), so the loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, the condition (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 i is 3, which is >1 \u2192 so break. Thus, the code would output 1, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, but 1 is not a prime. So the code has a bug here.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is supposed to find the next prime >= x. For x=1, the next prime is 2.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, it would output 1, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the code in the second Java program has a flaw. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java program:\n\nThe code's loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n   x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, the condition to break is if (i > sqrtNum). But when the loop doesn't run (like when sqrtNum <3), then i remains 3 (the initial value of i in the for loop).\n\nSo for x=1:\n\nsqrtNum is 1. The for loop's condition i <= sqrtNum (1) \u2192 i starts at 3, so the loop doesn't run. Thus, i remains 3. Since 3>1 \u2192 break. So the code returns x=1, which is wrong.\n\nAh, so the code is incorrect for x=1. The problem is that the code doesn't check if x is less than 2.\n\nThe code should first handle x=0,1,2 separately.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the second Java program is part of the sequence, so we have to replicate its behavior exactly, even if it's incorrect for some inputs.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, we must replicate the same logic, even if it's incorrect for x=1.\n\nThus, the code will output 1 for x=1, which is what the original Java code does.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is correct in replicating the original code's behavior.\n\nAnother test case: when x=2.\n\nThe code would set x=2 (since it's 2). Then, the loop:\n\nsqrt_num = sqrt(2) ~1.414.\n\nThe loop for loop_i from 3 to 1 \u2192 doesn't run. Thus, i remains 3, which is >1.414 \u2192 so break. Thus, x=2 is considered prime, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=3.\n\nThe code would check if it's prime. sqrt(3) is ~1.732. The loop from 3 to 1.732 \u2192 no iterations. So it's considered prime, which is correct.\n\nx=4:\n\nThe code first checks if x is even and not 2 \u2192 yes. So x becomes 5.\n\nThen check 5: sqrt(5) ~2.236. The loop starts at 3, which is >2.236 \u2192 so it's considered prime. So output 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the Fortran code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when converting next_str to next_i, if next_str is empty, but that shouldn't happen because the algorithm ensures that temp_str is at least length 1.\n\nFor example, when f is false, we append '3' to temp_str, so temp_str is at least length 1.\n\nThus, the read should be safe.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop, the next_i could be larger than N, but the loop will terminate.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
