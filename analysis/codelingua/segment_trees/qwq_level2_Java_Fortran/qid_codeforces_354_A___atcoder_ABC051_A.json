Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_354_A. It reads several integers from input: N, L, R, QL, QR, followed by N integers for the array W. Then it calculates a sum array, and iterates over possible firstR values to compute a minimum cost. The output is the minimum value found.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC051_A, reads a string and replaces commas with spaces, then outputs the result.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output (the min value) is the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string input. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Oh, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program's input? But the second program is expecting a string, so maybe the first program's output is a number, which would be a problem. Wait, maybe the second program is not part of the sequence here? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description?\n\nWait, the user provided two Java files. The first one's output is a number (min), and the second one's input is a string. So how can they be in sequence? That would mean the first program's output is a number, which is then given as input to the second program, which expects a string. That's a conflict. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program outputs a number (min), and the second expects a string (since it reads a line and processes it). That's a problem. Unless the second program is not part of the sequence? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup?\n\nWait, perhaps the second Java program is not part of the sequence? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Alternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to process the first's output as a string? Like, if the first program outputs a number, then the second program reads that as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program would read \"123\" as the input string, replacing commas with spaces. But in the second program's code, it's replacing commas with spaces. So if the first program's output is a number without commas, then the second program would just output the same number. Hmm, maybe that's the case here. So the second program is just a pass-through unless there are commas in the first program's output. But the first program's output is a number, so unless that number is written with commas (like 1,000), but in Java, the first program uses System.out.println(min), which would output the number as a string without commas. So the second program would just output the same number. So the overall effect is that the first program's output is passed through the second program, which does nothing except maybe formatting, but in this case, since there are no commas, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is not part of the sequence? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But according to the problem statement, the user provided two Java programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, so I have to take them as given.\n\nTherefore, the first program's output is a number (min), which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads that number as a string (since it uses BufferedReader.readLine()), which would be the string representation of the number. Then the second program replaces any commas in that string with spaces. Since the first program's output is a number, which in Java is printed without commas, the second program's output would be the same as the first's output. So the overall result is that the final output is the same as the first program's output. But that seems odd. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is not part of the sequence? Or maybe the user intended that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program is supposed to process it in some way. Let me check the second program's code again.\n\nThe second program reads a line, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. So if the first program's output is, say, \"1234\", then the second program would output \"1234\". But if the first program's output had a comma, like \"1,234\", then the second would output \"1 234\". But in the first program, the output is a number printed via System.out.println(min), which in Java would not include commas unless min is a string with commas, but min is a long, so it's printed as a number without commas. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output. Therefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. But then why have the second program? Maybe the user made a mistake in the example, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program is part of the sequence but the first program's output is a string with commas. Wait, but the first program's output is a number. Hmm. Maybe the second program is not part of the sequence? Or perhaps the user intended that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program is supposed to process it in some way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but the second program's input is the first's output. So the first program's output is a number, which is then given as input to the second program. The second program reads that number as a string (since it's using readLine()), and then replaces commas with spaces. Since the first program's output has no commas, the second program's output is the same as the first's. So the final output is the same as the first's. Therefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. So the second program is redundant here, but perhaps in some cases, the first program's output could have commas, but in the problem's context, maybe that's not the case. Anyway, I have to translate both into a single Fortran program.\n\nSo the task is to combine both Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same as the sequence. The first Java program's output is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first process the first program's logic, then the second's, but without I/O in between.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the entire sequence's input is the input to the first program, and the output is the second program's output. So the Fortran program must read the input (for the first program), process both steps, and output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the first part), compute the min value, then take that min value as the input to the second program's processing (replacing commas with spaces in the string representation of the min), then output the result of that.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, becomes a string (without commas). So the second program's input is that string, which has no commas, so the output is the same. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the problem requires that the Fortran program must do the same as the sequence. So in this case, the second program's processing is redundant, but we have to include it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the min value (as the first Java program does), then process that min value as a string (as the second Java program does), replacing commas with spaces, then output the result.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N, L, R, QL, QR, then N numbers).\n\n2. Compute the min value as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert that min value to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program's System.out.println).\n\n4. Replace any commas in that string with spaces (as per the second Java program).\n\n5. Output the resulting string.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you print a long, it doesn't include commas. So the string representation of min is just the digits. So the second program's processing would leave it unchanged. Therefore, the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the problem requires that the Fortran program must do exactly the same as the sequence, so even if the second program does nothing, we have to include that step.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do both steps: compute the min, then process its string representation by replacing commas with spaces, even if there are none.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part: the first Java program's logic.\n\nLet me parse the first Java code.\n\nThe first program reads N, L, R, QL, QR, then N integers into W array. Then computes a prefix sum array sum, where sum[0] =0, sum[1] = W[0], sum[2] = W[0]+W[1], etc.\n\nThen loops over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). For each firstR, lCount is firstR (since firstR is the number of elements on the left?), then rCount = N - lCount.\n\nThen compute candidate value as sum[lCount] * L + (sum[N] - sum[lCount]) * R.\n\nThen compute llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1), and rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1). Add llCount * QL and rrCount * QR to the candidate.\n\nKeep track of the minimum candidate.\n\nThe final min is printed.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, the second part: take the min value, convert to a string, replace commas with spaces, then output.\n\nIn Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done with write statements into a character variable.\n\nThen, replacing commas with spaces: need to loop through each character in the string and replace any commas with spaces.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input: first N, L, R, QL, QR, then N integers.\n\n2. Compute the min as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert min to a string (as it would be printed by Java's System.out.println).\n\n4. Replace any commas in that string with spaces.\n\n5. Print the resulting string.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nThe W array in Java is size N, with indices 0 to N-1. The sum array is N+1 elements, 0-based.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays. So:\n\nsum(1) = 0, sum(2) = W(1), sum(3) = W(1)+W(2), etc. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn Java:\n\nsum[0] =0\n\nsum[n+1] = sum[n] + W[n]\n\nSo for n from 0 to N-1 (since W has N elements). So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nsum(1) =0\n\nsum(i+1) = sum(i) + W(i), for i from 1 to N.\n\nThus, the W array in Fortran would be 1-based, with indices 1 to N.\n\nSo first, read N, L, R, QL, QR.\n\nThen read N integers into W(1) to W(N).\n\nCompute sum array:\n\nsum(1) =0\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   sum(i+1) = sum(i) + W(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). Wait, in Java firstR is from 0 to N. But in Fortran, variables are 1-based, but here firstR is an integer from 0 to N. So in Fortran, firstR can be 0 to N.\n\nWait, in the loop:\n\nfor (int firstR = 0; firstR <= N; firstR++)\n\nSo firstR ranges from 0 to N (inclusive). So in Fortran, we can have firstR from 0 to N.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables can be integers starting at 0. So that's okay.\n\nThen, for each firstR:\n\nlCount = firstR (since in Java firstR is the same as lCount)\n\nrCount = N - lCount\n\nThen compute the candidate:\n\ncand = sum(lCount+1) * L + (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount+1)) * R\n\nWait, because in Java sum is 0-based. sum[lCount] is sum[0..N], so in Fortran, sum(1) is 0, sum(2) is W(1), etc. So sum(lCount) in Java corresponds to sum(lCount+1) in Fortran? Wait, let me think:\n\nIn Java, sum[0] is 0, sum[1] is W[0], sum[2] is W[0]+W[1], etc. So for lCount (which is firstR in Java), which can be 0 to N, the sum up to lCount elements is sum[lCount], which in Fortran would be sum(lCount+1). Because in Fortran, sum(1) is 0 (Java's sum[0]), sum(2) is Java's sum[1], etc. So yes.\n\nSo the candidate in Fortran would be:\n\ncand = sum(lCount) * L + (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount)) * R\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java:\n\nsum[lCount] is the sum of the first lCount elements (since sum[0] is 0, sum[1] is W[0], etc). So in Fortran, sum(lCount) is the same as Java's sum[lCount], because sum(1) is 0 (Java's sum[0]), sum(2) is Java's sum[1], etc. Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, sum(1) is 0 (Java's sum[0]), sum(2) is W(1) (Java's W[0], since W in Fortran is 1-based?), so perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nW is 0-based, so W[0] is first element.\n\nsum[0] =0\n\nsum[1] = W[0]\n\nsum[2] = W[0]+W[1]\n\nsum[N] = sum of first N elements.\n\nIn Fortran, W is 1-based, so W(1) is first element.\n\nsum(1) =0\n\nsum(2) = W(1)\n\nsum(3) = W(1)+W(2)\n\nsum(N+1) = sum of all N elements.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the sum array has N+1 elements, with indices 1 to N+1.\n\nTherefore, when in Java code, sum[lCount] is the sum of the first lCount elements (since lCount is firstR, which can be 0 to N), in Fortran that would be sum(lCount+1). Wait no:\n\nWait, in Java, lCount is firstR, which can be 0 to N. So for lCount=0, sum[0] is 0. In Fortran, sum(1) is 0. So sum(lCount) in Fortran would be sum(0+1)=sum(1)=0, which matches. For lCount=1, sum[1] in Java is W[0], which in Fortran is sum(2). So yes, in Fortran, the sum array's index is lCount +1. Wait, no. Wait, in Java, sum[lCount] is the sum of the first lCount elements. In Fortran, the sum array's index is lCount +1. So to get the same value, in Fortran, we need to use sum(lCount +1). Wait, no:\n\nWait, in Java, sum[0] is 0 (sum of 0 elements). sum[1] is W[0], sum[2] is W[0]+W[1], etc. So for lCount elements, the sum is sum[lCount].\n\nIn Fortran, sum(1) is 0 (sum of 0 elements), sum(2) is W(1) (sum of 1 element), sum(3) is W(1)+W(2) (sum of 2 elements). So for lCount elements, the sum is sum(lCount +1). Because lCount elements would be sum(1 + lCount). So yes, in Fortran, the sum for lCount elements is sum(lCount +1).\n\nTherefore, in the candidate calculation:\n\nJava's sum[lCount] is sum(lCount +1) in Fortran.\n\nJava's (sum[N] - sum[lCount]) is (sum(N) - sum(lCount)) in Java, which in Fortran would be (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount +1)).\n\nWait, in Java, sum[N] is the sum of all N elements. In Fortran, that's sum(N+1).\n\nSo the candidate in Fortran would be:\n\ncand = sum(lCount +1) * L + (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount +1)) * R\n\nThen, the llCount and rrCount:\n\nJava:\n\nllCount = Math.max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nrCount = N - lCount (since rCount = N - lCount)\n\nWait, in Java, lCount is firstR, which is the number of elements on the left? Or is it the firstR variable's meaning?\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the variables are:\n\nlCount = firstR (the number of elements on the left side?)\n\nrCount = N - lCount (number on the right side?)\n\nThen, llCount is the maximum between 0 and (lCount - rCount -1). Similarly for rrCount.\n\nSo in Fortran, lCount is firstR (the loop variable). rCount = N - lCount.\n\nThen:\n\nllCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nBut rCount is N - lCount, so substituting:\n\nlCount - (N - lCount) -1 = 2*lCount - N -1\n\nSo llCount = max(0, 2*lCount - N -1)\n\nSimilarly, rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1) = max(0, (N - lCount) - lCount -1) = max(0, N - 2*lCount -1)\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nrrCount = Math.max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\nrCount is N - lCount, so:\n\nrCount - lCount -1 = (N - lCount) - lCount -1 = N - 2*lCount -1\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code for llCount and rrCount would be:\n\nllCount = max(0, 2*lCount - N -1)\n\nrrCount = max(0, N - 2*lCount -1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the max function can be done with the max function, but need to be careful with integer types.\n\nNow, the candidate is then:\n\ncand = (sum(lCount +1)*L + (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount +1))*R) + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\nWait, in Java, the code is:\n\ncand += llCount * QL;\n\ncand += rrCount * QR;\n\nSo yes, adding those terms.\n\nThe initial cand is the first term, then adding the two terms.\n\nNow, the min is tracked as the minimum between current min and cand.\n\nInitially, min is set to Long.MAX_VALUE. In Fortran, we can set it to a very large number, like 1e18 or something, but need to use integer*8 or similar for large numbers.\n\nWait, in Java, the min is a long, which can be up to 2^63-1. In Fortran, using integer(8) would be appropriate.\n\nSo variables:\n\nWe need to declare variables as integers (for N, L, R, QL, QR, W array, sum array, etc.), but the candidate and min can be 8-byte integers.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead N, L, R, QL, QR.\n\nThen read N integers into W array (1-based).\n\nCompute the sum array.\n\nThen loop over firstR from 0 to N (inclusive).\n\nWait, in Fortran, loops can be from 0 to N.\n\nThen compute lCount = firstR.\n\nrCount = N - lCount.\n\nThen compute the terms.\n\nNow, the second part: converting the min to a string, replacing commas with spaces.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert the min to a string, we can use an internal write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\n\nwrite(str_min, '(I0)') min_val\n\nThen, we need to process each character in str_min, replacing commas with spaces.\n\nBut in Fortran, the default integer output does not include commas, so the string will have no commas. But the code must still perform the replacement as per the second Java program.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Convert min to a string (as it would be printed by Java, which is just the number without commas).\n\n2. Iterate over each character in the string, replacing commas with spaces.\n\n3. Output the resulting string.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') min_val\n\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      s(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, trim(s)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement with '(I0)' will not include commas, so the string s will have no commas. So the loop does nothing, but we have to include it.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\n  integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n\n  integer(8) :: sum(0:100000) !

Now process the second program's part\n\n  write(s, '(I0)') min_val\n\n  integer :: len_s, i\n\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n  do i = 1, len_s\n\n     if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  print *, trim(s)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the sum array, in the code above, I used sum(0) to sum(N). Because in the first Java code, the sum array is 0-based with N+1 elements. So in Fortran, the sum array can be declared as sum(0:N), but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Wait, no, in Fortran you can declare arrays with any lower bound. So perhaps better to declare sum(0:N), but in the code above, I used sum(0:100000), but that's a fixed size. Alternatively, allocate it dynamically.\n\nWait, the problem may have constraints on N. Since the first Java code uses an array of size N, which in Java can be up to the maximum allowed. But in Fortran, perhaps better to use an allocatable array.\n\nWait, in the code above, I have:\n\ninteger(8) :: sum(0:100000)\n\nBut that's a fixed size. To make it dynamic, perhaps:\n\nallocate(sum(0:N))\n\nBut in the code outline above, I used:\n\nsum(0) =0\n\nthen loop from 1 to N.\n\nWait, let me re-express the sum array correctly.\n\nThe sum array in the code above is declared as sum(0:100000), but that's a fixed size. To make it dynamic, perhaps:\n\nallocate(sum(0:N))\n\nBut in the code outline, the code is:\n\nsum(0) =0\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   sum(i) = sum(i-1) + W(i)\n\nend do\n\nYes, so the sum array needs to be from 0 to N. So in Fortran, we can declare it as:\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: sum(:)\n\nallocate(sum(0:N))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\n  integer, allocatable :: W(:)\n\n  integer(8), allocatable :: sum(:)\n\n  integer(8) :: min_val, cand\n\n  integer :: firstR, lCount, rCount\n\n  integer :: llCount, rrCount\n\n  character(len=20) :: s\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read*, N, L, R, QL, QR\n\n  allocate(W(N))\n\n  read*, W(1:N)\n\n  ! Allocate sum array from 0 to N\n\n  allocate(sum(0:N))\n\n  sum(0) = 0\n\n  do i = 1, N\n\n     sum(i) = sum(i-1) + W(i)\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Initialize min_val to a large value\n\n  min_val = huge(min_val)\n\n  do firstR = 0, N\n\n     lCount = firstR\n\n     rCount = N - lCount\n\n     ! Compute candidate\n\n     cand = sum(lCount) * L + (sum(N) - sum(lCount)) * R\n\n     llCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\n     rrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n     cand = cand + llCount * QL + rrCount * QR\n\n     if (cand < min_val) then\n\n        min_val = cand\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Now process the second program's part\n\n  write(s, '(I0)') min_val\n\n  integer :: len_s, i\n\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n  do i = 1, len_s\n\n     if (s(i:i) == ',') then\n\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  print *, trim(s)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for firstR, the variables lCount and rCount are integers. The terms llCount and rrCount are also integers. The cand is an integer(8), since sum can be large (sum of N elements, each up to maybe 1e9, so sum could be up to 1e14, multiplied by L or R which could be up to 1e9, so cand could be up to 1e23, which fits in 8-byte integer (which is 64 bits, so up to 9e18). So 8 bytes is okay.\n\nNow, the initial value of min_val is set to huge(min_val). The huge function in Fortran returns the maximum value of the type. Since min_val is integer(8), huge(min_val) would be 2^63 -1, which is the same as Long.MAX_VALUE in Java. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part: converting min_val to a string and replacing commas.\n\nThe write statement with '(I0)' will write the number without any commas, so the string s will have no commas. The loop over the characters will do nothing, but it's required to replicate the second Java program's behavior.\n\nThus, the final output is the same as the first program's output, but the code correctly follows the sequence.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWait, in the loop for firstR, the variables lCount and rCount are firstR and N - firstR. So that's correct.\n\nThe calculation of llCount and rrCount:\n\nllCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nrCount = N - lCount, so substituting:\n\nlCount - (N - lCount) -1 = 2*lCount - N -1\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for rrCount.\n\nThe candidate is computed correctly.\n\nThe sum array is correctly built.\n\nThe min_val is initialized to the maximum possible, and updated correctly.\n\nThe second part's string processing is done.\n\nThus, this should be correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nTest case where the first program's output has a comma? For example, if min_val is 1000000, which in Java is printed as 1000000 (no commas). So the second program leaves it as is.\n\nAnother case: if min_val is 1234567890123456789 (a very large number), but in Fortran, the write statement with '(I0)' will handle it correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, the default integer for the variables L, R, QL, QR is 4 bytes. But if those can be up to 1e9, then they need to be 4-byte (since 2^31 is about 2e9). Wait, 1e9 is within 32-bit integer. So 4 bytes is okay. So the variables N, L, R, QL, QR can be declared as integer (4 bytes), but in Fortran, the default is 4 bytes. So that's okay.\n\nThe W array is integer, so each element is 4 bytes. The sum array is integer(8), so that's okay.\n\nThus, the code should work."
