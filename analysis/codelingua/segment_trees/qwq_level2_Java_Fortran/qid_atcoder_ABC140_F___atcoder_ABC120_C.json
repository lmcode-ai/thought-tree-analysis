Wait, in the code above, the stack is declared as a character(len=100) variable, but that's a single string of length 100. To use it as an array, perhaps better to use a character array:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: stack(100)\n\nThen, stack(1:top) holds the elements. So modifying the second part's code:\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(100) :: stack\n\n    integer :: top =0\n\n    count =0\n\n    do i=1, len_trim(first_result)\n\n        character(len=1) :: c = first_result(i:i)\n\n        top = top +1\n\n        stack(top) = c\n\n        do while (top >=2)\n\n            character(len=1) :: p = stack(top)\n\n            character(len=1) :: q = stack(top-1)\n\n            if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC140_F). It reads an integer N, then an array S of size 2^N. It does some processing involving sorting S, tracking active elements, and checking conditions over N iterations. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC120_C) reads a string, processes it using a stack to count pairs of '0' and '1', and outputs the count multiplied by 2.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the output of each program is the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the code, the first program's output is either \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program's input is a string. That doesn't align. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. But in the given Java code, the first program's output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", and the second program expects a string input. That suggests that perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second? But \"Yes\" or \"No\" would be the input string for the second program. Hmm, but the second program's input is a string, so maybe that's the case. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the entire sequence is: first program reads from stdin, outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", then the second program takes that as input, processes it, and outputs the result. But the user wants a single Fortran program that does the same. So the Fortran program must first run the first Java program's logic, then pass its output to the second's logic, without I/O in between.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\"), which is then the input to the second program. The second program's input is a string, so that's okay. The second program then processes that string (the \"Yes\" or \"No\") and outputs the result. Wait, but the second program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of 0s and 1s, and counts pairs. So if the first program outputs \"Yes\", then the second program would process \"Yes\" as the input string, which would have characters like 'Y', 'e', 's', etc. But that might not make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are connected in a way that the first's output is the second's input. But given the code, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the two Java files are separate problems, but the user wants to chain them? Hmm, perhaps the user intended that the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the second's input, but in reality, the first program's output is a single line, and the second expects a string. So the Fortran program must first compute the first's result, then use that as input to the second's processing.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the N and the array S), process it to get \"Yes\" or \"No\", then take that string as input to the second program's processing, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and the array S).\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the \"Yes\" or \"No\" result.\n3. Use that result as the input string for the second program's logic.\n4. Process the second program's logic on that string and output the final result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first Java program (ABC140_F):\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\n- Read N, then 2^N integers into array S.\n- Sort S in ascending order.\n- Initialize a boolean array 'spawned' of size 2^N, with only the last element (index size-1) set to true.\n- Then, active list starts with the largest element (S[size-1]).\n- For N iterations:\n   - Sort active in reverse order (descending).\n   - For each slime in active, find the next available S element that is less than the slime and not spawned yet.\n   - If can't find, output \"No\" and exit.\n   - Mark that next element as spawned and add to activated list.\n   - After processing all in active, add activated to active.\n- After all iterations, output \"Yes\".\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program has some parts that might need careful translation. Let me re-express the steps.\n\nWait, the code in the first Java program:\n\nAfter reading S, it sorts S. Then, the active list is initialized with the last element of S (the largest, since sorted). Then, for each of N steps:\n\n- Sort active in reverse order (so largest first).\n- Then, for each element in active (in this sorted order), they look for the next available S element that is less than the current slime and not yet spawned. The loop uses a 'next' pointer starting from the end (size-1) and moving backward until it finds an unspawned element smaller than the current slime. Once found, that element is marked as spawned and added to activated. \n\nWait, the code's loop for next is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    active.sort(Collections.reverseOrder());\n    List<Integer> activated = new ArrayList<>();\n    int next = size - 1;\n    for (int slime : active) {\n        while (next >= 0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) {\n            next--;\n        }\n        if (next < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"No\");\n            return;\n        }\n        spawned[next] = true;\n        activated.add(S[next]);\n    }\n    active.addAll(activated);\n}\n\nWait, the 'next' variable is initialized to size-1 for each iteration of the outer loop (each i from 0 to N-1). So for each iteration of the outer loop (each of the N steps), the 'next' starts at the end again. Wait, but in the code, the 'next' is reset to size-1 each time. Wait, no, the code inside the for loop over i:\n\nWait, the code inside the for loop over i:\n\nactive is sorted in reverse order (descending).\n\nThen, activated is a new list.\n\nnext is set to size-1 (the last index of S array).\n\nThen, for each slime in active (in the sorted order):\n\n   while next >=0 and (S[next] >= slime OR spawned[next] is true), decrement next.\n\n   So, we are looking for the first element before next (starting from the end) that is less than slime and not spawned.\n\n   Once found, that element is added to activated, and spawned is set to true.\n\n   Then, next is not reset here, so the next iteration of the for loop (for the next slime in active) will continue from the current next value.\n\nWait, that's important. The 'next' variable is decremented each time until it finds a suitable element. So for each slime in the active list, we start from the current next (which might have been decremented from previous slimes in this iteration) and look backward until we find an unspawned element smaller than the current slime.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. So the 'next' variable is shared among all the slimes in the current active list for this iteration. So the next element is being tracked across all the slimes in the current active list for this iteration. So the next starts at the end, and for each slime, we move backward until we find an unspawned element smaller than the slime. Once found, that element is taken, and next continues from there for the next slime.\n\nThis is important for the algorithm's correctness. So in Fortran, I need to replicate this logic.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\n- N is an integer input.\n\n- The array S has size 2^N. Let's compute that as 2**N.\n\n- The spawned array is a logical array of size 2**N, initialized to .false., except the last element (index 2**N -1) is .true.\n\nWait, in Java, arrays are 0-based. So in Fortran, which is 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare the arrays with lower bound 0. Alternatively, adjust indices accordingly.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays in Fortran, but adjust the indices. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. Let me see:\n\nIn the first program's code:\n\nsize = (1 << N) \u2192 which is 2^N.\n\nIn Java, the array S is 0-based, so indices 0 to size-1.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays, so the size is 2**N, indices 1 to 2**N.\n\nWait, but in the code, the last element is S[size-1], which in 0-based is the last element. So in Fortran, if we have 1-based, then the last element is S(2**N).\n\nSo, to map:\n\nJava's S[0] \u2192 Fortran S(1)\n\nJava's S[size-1] \u2192 Fortran S(2**N)\n\nSo when translating, need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nFirst, read N, then read 2^N integers into S array.\n\nSort the S array in ascending order (since in Java, Arrays.sort(S) does that).\n\nInitialize spawned array (logical) of size 2**N, all .false. except the last element (S(2**N)) is .true.\n\nThen, the active list is initially [S(2**N)], since in Java it was S[size-1], which is the last element.\n\nWait, in Java, after sorting S, the largest element is at S[size-1], so in Fortran, after sorting, the largest is at S(2**N).\n\nSo the initial active list is a list containing S(2**N).\n\nThen, for each of N iterations:\n\n   Sort the active list in descending order (reverse order).\n\n   Then, create a new list activated.\n\n   Initialize next to 2**N (the last index in Fortran).\n\n   For each slime in the active list (sorted in descending order):\n\n      while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next) is true):\n\n          next = next -1\n\n      if next <1 \u2192 output \"No\" and exit.\n\n      mark spawned(next) as true.\n\n      add S(next) to activated.\n\n   After processing all slimes in active, add activated elements to active.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, lists are not as straightforward as in Java. So we need to represent the active list as an array or a dynamic structure. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays easily, perhaps we can use an array with a size that can grow, but that's tricky. Alternatively, since the maximum possible size of active can be up to 2^N elements (since each step can add up to the current active size), but given that N is up to, say, 20 (since 2^20 is a million, but maybe the problem constraints are smaller?), but in any case, perhaps we can pre-allocate arrays of size 2^N for active and activated.\n\nAlternatively, since in each iteration, the active list is processed, and activated is added to it, perhaps we can manage the active list as an array, and track its current size.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit involved. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, variables:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute size = 2**N.\n\nRead size integers into array S(1:size).\n\nSort S in ascending order.\n\nInitialize spawned(1:size) as .false.\n\nspawned(size) = .true.\n\nInitialize active array. Let's have an array active of size size, and an integer variable active_count to track the number of elements in active.\n\nInitially, active(1) = S(size), active_count =1.\n\nThen, for each iteration from 1 to N:\n\n   Sort the active array in descending order. Wait, but how to sort an array in Fortran in descending order?\n\n   Alternatively, we can create a temporary array sorted_active, which is a copy of active(1:active_count), then sort it in descending order.\n\n   Then, process each element in this sorted_active array.\n\n   Then, the activated list is built by processing each element in sorted_active.\n\n   So steps for each iteration:\n\n   1. Sort the current active array in descending order \u2192 sorted_active array.\n\n   2. Initialize next = size (the last index in S array).\n\n   3. Initialize activated_count =0, and an array activated(1:active_count) (since each element in active can generate one activated element? Or maybe more?)\n\nWait, no. For each element in the active list (sorted in descending order), we process them one by one, and for each, find the next available S element.\n\nWait, the activated list is built by adding the found S elements. The activated elements are then added to the active list for the next iteration.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after processing all slimes in active, the activated list is added to active. So the new active list is the original active plus activated.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nactive.addAll(activated);\n\nSo the next iteration's active is the previous active plus the activated elements.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after processing each iteration, the active array must be extended by the activated elements.\n\nHmm, this requires dynamic arrays, which in Fortran can be handled with allocatable arrays.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nWe can use an allocatable array for active, and reallocate as needed.\n\nAlternatively, pre-allocate an array of size 2^N, since the maximum possible size after N steps is 2^N (since each step can add up to the current size, but actually, the process may not reach that, but for safety, pre-allocating to size 2^N is okay).\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read N, compute size = 2**N.\n\nRead the S array (size elements).\n\nSort S in ascending order.\n\nInitialize spawned array (logical, size elements) to .false., except spawned(size) = .true.\n\nInitialize active array (integer, size elements), active_count =1, active(1) = S(size).\n\nThen, loop over N iterations:\n\n   Sort the active array (first active_count elements) in descending order \u2192 create a temporary array sorted_active.\n\n   Then, process each element in sorted_active:\n\n      Initialize next = size (the last index of S array).\n\n      For each slime in sorted_active:\n\n          while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next)):\n\n              next = next -1\n\n          if next <1 \u2192 print \"No\" and exit.\n\n          spawned(next) = .true.\n\n          add S(next) to activated array.\n\n      Wait, but the processing is for each slime in the sorted_active array.\n\n      So, for each slime in the sorted_active array (in order):\n\n          find the next available S element as per the loop.\n\n          then, add that S(next) to activated.\n\n      So, the activated array will have as many elements as the active array in this iteration.\n\n      Then, after processing all slimes, the activated elements are added to the active array for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the activated list is added to active. So the new active is the original active plus activated. Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nactive is the list before processing.\n\nThen, activated is a new list.\n\nThen, after processing all slimes in active (sorted), the activated list is filled with the found elements.\n\nThen, active.addAll(activated).\n\nSo the new active is the original active plus the activated elements.\n\nWait, but in the next iteration, the active list includes both the original elements and the new ones. So the size of active can grow exponentially? Wait, but in the problem's logic, perhaps each step adds elements, but the total can't exceed 2^N elements, since each element is spawned once.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, the active array can be managed as follows:\n\nWe can have an array active of size 2^N, and track active_count.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n   Create a temporary array sorted_active of size active_count, which is a copy of active(1:active_count), then sort in descending order.\n\n   Then, process each element in sorted_active:\n\n      For each slime in sorted_active (in order):\n\n          while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next)):\n\n              next = next -1\n\n          if next <1 \u2192 output \"No\" and exit.\n\n          spawned(next) = .true.\n\n          add S(next) to activated array (which is a temporary array).\n\n   Then, the activated array has active_count elements (since each element in the active list produces one activated element? Or maybe not? Wait, each slime in the active list (sorted) produces one activated element. So the activated array's size is equal to the number of elements in the active list for this iteration.\n\n   Then, the new active array is the original active plus the activated elements. Wait, no, the original active is the list before processing, but in the next iteration, the active list is the original active plus the activated elements. Wait, no, in the Java code, after processing, the active list is the original active plus the activated elements. So the new active is the original active (before this iteration) plus the activated elements. Wait, no, the original active is the list before the iteration. The activated elements are added to it. So the new active is the original active plus the activated elements. So the size becomes active_count + activated_count (which is active_count in this case, since each element in the active list produces one activated element).\n\nWait, the activated list's size is equal to the number of elements in the active list before processing this iteration. Because for each element in the active list (sorted), we add one to activated. So activated has the same size as the active list before this iteration.\n\nTherefore, the new active array will have active_count + activated_count elements, which is active_count * 2? Not exactly, but in this case, since activated_count is active_count, so new active_count is 2*active_count.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration, active_count is 1. After processing, activated has 1 element, so new active_count is 2. Next iteration, active_count is 2, so activated has 2 elements, new active_count is 4, etc. So after N iterations, the active_count would be 2^N, which matches the size. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the active array can be of size 2^N, and we can track active_count.\n\nSo, in each iteration:\n\n   Sort the current active array (first active_count elements) in descending order \u2192 sorted_active array.\n\n   Then, process each element in sorted_active (in order):\n\n      For each slime in sorted_active:\n\n          while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next)):\n\n              next = next -1\n\n          if next <1 \u2192 print \"No\" and exit.\n\n          spawned(next) = .true.\n\n          add S(next) to activated array (which is a temporary array of size active_count).\n\n   Then, the new active array is the original active array (before this iteration) plus the activated array. Wait, no, the original active array is the one before the iteration. Wait, in the Java code, the active list is the list before the iteration, and after processing, the activated elements are added to it. So the new active list is the original active plus activated.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nactive is the list before processing.\n\nThen, activated is created, and after processing all elements in active, activated is added to active.\n\nSo the new active is the original active plus activated.\n\nWait, but in the code, the activated list is added to active. So the new active is the original active (before this iteration) plus the activated elements. So the size becomes active_count + activated_count (which is active_count, so 2*active_count).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array active of size 2^N, and track active_count.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n   Create a temporary array sorted_active of size active_count, which is a copy of active(1:active_count), then sort in descending order.\n\n   Then, create an array activated of size active_count.\n\n   Initialize next = size (the last index of S array).\n\n   Then, loop over each element in sorted_active (from 1 to active_count):\n\n      slime = sorted_active(i)\n\n      while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next)):\n\n          next = next -1\n\n      if next <1:\n\n          print \"No\"\n\n          exit the program.\n\n      end if\n\n      spawned(next) = .true.\n\n      activated(i) = S(next)\n\n   end do\n\n   Then, the new active array is the original active array (before this iteration) plus the activated array.\n\n   So, the new active array is:\n\n   active(1:active_count + activated_count) = [active(1:active_count), activated(1:activated_count)]\n\n   But since activated_count is active_count, the new active_count becomes 2*active_count.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. So we need to have the active array pre-allocated to size 2^N. So we can do:\n\n   The new active array is:\n\n   active(1:active_count) \u2192 original elements.\n\n   Then, the activated elements are added from position active_count+1 to active_count*2.\n\n   So:\n\n   do i = 1, active_count\n\n       active(active_count + i) = activated(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   active_count = active_count * 2\n\n   So that's manageable.\n\nNow, after N iterations, if we reach the end, print \"Yes\".\n\nOnce the first part is done, the output of the first program is \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThen, this string is the input to the second program.\n\nThe second program (ABC120_C) reads a string, processes it with a stack to count pairs of '0' and '1', and outputs the count multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, the second program's input is the output of the first program, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe second program's processing:\n\nInitialize a stack. For each character in the input string:\n\n   push to stack.\n\n   while the stack has at least two elements:\n\n       pop two elements (p and q).\n\n       if they are '0' and '1' in any order, increment count and don't push back.\n\n       else, push them back in reverse order (since stack is LIFO).\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe stack is implemented as a Stack<Character>.\n\nFor each character in x:\n\n   push to stack.\n\n   then, while stack.size() >1:\n\n       p = stack.pop()\n\n       q = stack.pop()\n\n       if (p == '1' && q == '0') or (p == '0' && q == '1') \u2192 then count +=1, and continue (so don't push back).\n\n       else \u2192 push back q and p, and break the loop.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the loop:\n\n   while (s.size() >1) {\n\n       p = s.pop();\n\n       q = s.pop();\n\n       if ( (p == '1' && q == '0') || (p == '0' && q == '1') ) {\n\n           c++;\n\n           continue; // continue the while loop, so the next iteration will check again.\n\n       } else {\n\n           s.push(q);\n\n           s.push(p);\n\n           break; // exit the while loop.\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\nWait, the 'continue' here continues the while loop, so after popping and finding a pair, they are not pushed back, so the stack size is reduced by 2, and the loop continues to check again.\n\nWait, but in the code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, then c is incremented, and the loop continues (so the next iteration will check again with the new top of the stack). If not, then they are pushed back, and the loop breaks.\n\nSo the processing is: whenever two consecutive elements (in the stack) form a 0-1 or 1-0 pair, they are removed and count increases. This is done greedily as much as possible each time a new character is added.\n\nThe final output is c *2.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is \"Yes\", the characters are 'Y', 'e', 's'.\n\nThe stack processing would be:\n\nPush 'Y' \u2192 stack: [Y]\n\nNo further processing (stack size 1).\n\nPush 'e' \u2192 stack: [Y, e]\n\nCheck stack size >1 \u2192 yes.\n\nPop 'e' and 'Y' \u2192 they are not a pair \u2192 push back. So stack remains [Y, e]. Break loop.\n\nNext character 's' \u2192 push \u2192 stack [Y, e, s].\n\nCheck stack size 3 \u2192 loop:\n\n   pop 's' and 'e' \u2192 not a pair \u2192 push back. Break.\n\nSo total count is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the first program's output, which is \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the second program's output would be 0 in this case, since neither \"Yes\" nor \"No\" contain 0 and 1 characters.\n\nWait, but the second program's problem is probably from a different problem, where the input is a string of 0s and 1s. But according to the user's instruction, the two Java programs are to be chained, so their outputs and inputs are connected. So the first program's output is the second's input, even if it's not a valid input for the second problem. The user wants the Fortran program to do exactly that.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after the first part's processing, the output is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is then used as the input string for the second part's processing.\n\nNow, translating the second Java program into Fortran.\n\nThe second program's steps:\n\nRead a string x (the input is a single line, which is the first program's output).\n\nProcess the string with a stack:\n\nInitialize stack as an array or a list. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in stack, we can use an array with a pointer indicating the top.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nInitialize stack array of sufficient size (say, up to the length of the input string).\n\ntop =0.\n\nLoop over each character in the string:\n\n   push to stack (top +=1, stack(top) = char).\n\n   then, while top >=2:\n\n       p = stack(top)\n\n       q = stack(top-1)\n\n       if (p == '1' and q == '0') or (p == '0' and q == '1'):\n\n           count +=1\n\n           top -=2 \u2192 remove the two elements.\n\n       else:\n\n           break the loop.\n\nSo, the processing is done by checking the top two elements. If they form a pair, remove them and increment count. Else, stop.\n\nWait, the Java code's logic is slightly different because it pops two elements each time, but in the Fortran approach, we can track the top and check the top two elements.\n\nWait, the Java code's loop:\n\nAfter pushing the new character, it enters a loop where it pops two elements, checks if they form a pair. If yes, count increases and the loop continues (so the next iteration will check the new top elements). If not, they are pushed back and the loop breaks.\n\nIn the Fortran approach, using an array and a top index:\n\nAfter pushing the new character (top increases by 1), enter a loop:\n\n   while top >=2:\n\n       p = stack(top)\n\n       q = stack(top-1)\n\n       if (p and q form a pair):\n\n           count +=1\n\n           top -=2 \u2192 remove the two elements.\n\n       else:\n\n           exit the loop.\n\nThis is equivalent to the Java code's logic.\n\nBecause, in the Java code, when a pair is found, the two elements are removed (not pushed back), so the stack size decreases by 2, and the loop continues. In the Fortran approach, by decrementing top by 2, the next iteration of the while loop will check the new top elements again. If they form a pair, it continues. If not, the loop exits.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nRead the string (the output of the first part, which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\").\n\nThen, process it as follows:\n\nInitialize stack array of size, say, 100 (since the input is at most a few characters).\n\ntop =0\n\ncount =0\n\nLoop over each character in the string:\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = current_char\n\n   do while (top >=2):\n\n       p = stack(top)\n\n       q = stack(top-1)\n\n       if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n           count = count +1\n\n           top = top -2\n\n       else\n\n           exit\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nAfter processing all characters, output count *2.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire Fortran program must first process the first part (the ABC140_F logic), then use its output as the input string for the second part (ABC120_C logic), and output the result of the second part.\n\nBut in Fortran, the program must read all input at the beginning, process everything, and output the final result.\n\nWait, the first part requires reading N and the array S. The second part requires reading a string, which is the output of the first part. But in the original setup, the first program's output is the second's input. So in the Fortran program, the first part's output (Yes/No) must be generated, then passed to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and the array S).\n\n2. Process the first program's logic to get the output string (Yes or No).\n\n3. Use that string as the input for the second program's processing.\n\n4. Output the result of the second program.\n\nThus, the Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read N and the array S.\n\n- Compute the first part's result (Yes/No).\n\n- Then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\n- Output the second part's result.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\nWe need to read N, then 2^N integers.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) etc.\n\nBut for reading a variable number of integers, we can read them into an array.\n\nFirst, read N:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nThen compute size = 2**N.\n\nAllocate an array S of size elements.\n\nThen read the S array:\n\nread(*,*) (S(i), i=1, size)\n\nThen sort S in ascending order.\n\nSorting in Fortran can be done with a subroutine, or using the built-in sort function if available (but in standard Fortran, we might need to write a sort routine).\n\nAlternatively, use a bubble sort or another method.\n\nAlternatively, use the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module to get the size, but for sorting, perhaps a simple bubble sort is manageable for small N (since 2^20 is too big, but maybe the problem constraints have small N? The first Java program's code may have N up to 20, but in that case, 2^20 is a million elements, which would be a problem for bubble sort. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects N to be small enough for the code to run in time. Alternatively, use a more efficient sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function Mergesort or another method. Wait, in Fortran 90 and above, there's the 'sort' function in some libraries, but standard Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort. So perhaps we can use a simple sort for small N.\n\nAlternatively, use a selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'heap sort' or 'quick sort' implemented in code.\n\nAlternatively, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code can use a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge sort' algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires the code to be correct, perhaps the best way is to implement a sort.\n\nLet me think of a quick sort for an array.\n\nAlternatively, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code can use a simple bubble sort, but for large N, it might be too slow. However, given that the user is asking for code translation, perhaps the code can proceed with a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO module if available, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge sort' algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'shell sort' method.\n\nAlternatively, here's a simple selection sort for the array S:\n\ndo i =1, size-1\n\n   min_val = S(i)\n\n   min_idx =i\n\n   do j =i+1, size\n\n       if (S(j) < min_val) then\n\n           min_val = S(j)\n\n           min_idx =j\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (min_idx /=i) then\n\n       temp = S(i)\n\n       S(i) = S(min_idx)\n\n       S(min_idx) = temp\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis is O(n^2), which is acceptable for small N (like up to 20, but 2^20 is a million, which would be 1e12 operations, which is way too slow). So this approach is not feasible for large N.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The first Java program's code may have N up to 20, but in that case, the array size is 1e6, which would take way too long with O(n^2) sorting.\n\nTherefore, I need a more efficient sorting algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, use a quicksort implementation.\n\nHere's a quicksort subroutine in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n\n    integer :: i, j, pivot, temp\n\n    i = left\n\n    j = right\n\n    pivot = arr( (left + right) / 2 )\n\n    do\n\n        do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n\n            i = i +1\n\n        end do\n\n        do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n\n            j = j -1\n\n        end do\n\n        if (i <= j) then\n\n            temp = arr(i)\n\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n\n            arr(j) = temp\n\n            i = i +1\n\n            j = j -1\n\n        end if\n\n        if (i > j) exit\n\n    end do\n\n    if (left < j) call quicksort(arr, left, j)\n\n    if (i < right) call quicksort(arr, i, right)\n\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nThis is a standard quicksort implementation. So we can call this to sort the array S.\n\nSo, after reading the array S, call quicksort(S, 1, size).\n\nNow, the spawned array is a logical array of size elements, initialized to .false., except the last element (S(size) is the largest, so spawned(size) = .true.\n\nThen, the active array is an integer array of size elements, with active_count initialized to 1, and active(1) = S(size).\n\nThen, loop over N iterations:\n\n   Sort the active array (first active_count elements) in descending order.\n\n   To sort in descending order, we can call the quicksort with a modified comparison.\n\nAlternatively, create a temporary array and sort in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, in the quicksort, we can pass a flag for ascending or descending.\n\nAlternatively, for the purpose of sorting in descending order, we can sort the array in ascending order and then reverse it.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\n   Create a temporary array sorted_active of size active_count.\n\n   Copy the active array's first active_count elements into sorted_active.\n\n   Call quicksort(sorted_active, 1, active_count).\n\n   Then reverse the sorted_active array to get descending order.\n\nAlternatively, modify the quicksort to sort in descending order.\n\nAlternatively, in the quicksort subroutine, we can have a parameter to choose the order.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, let's proceed as follows:\n\n   To sort in descending order, we can sort in ascending order and then reverse the array.\n\nSo:\n\n   call quicksort(sorted_active, 1, active_count)\n\n   then reverse the array.\n\n   do i =1, active_count/2\n\n       temp = sorted_active(i)\n\n       sorted_active(i) = sorted_active(active_count -i +1)\n\n       sorted_active(active_count -i +1) = temp\n\n   end do\n\nAlternatively, in the quicksort, we can change the comparison to be greater than instead of less than.\n\nAlternatively, here's a modified quicksort for descending order:\n\nsubroutine quicksort_desc(arr, left, right)\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n\n    integer :: i, j, pivot, temp\n\n    i = left\n\n    j = right\n\n    pivot = arr( (left + right) / 2 )\n\n    do\n\n        do while (arr(i) > pivot)\n\n            i = i +1\n\n        end do\n\n        do while (arr(j) < pivot)\n\n            j = j -1\n\n        end do\n\n        if (i <= j) then\n\n            temp = arr(i)\n\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n\n            arr(j) = temp\n\n            i = i +1\n\n            j = j -1\n\n        end if\n\n        if (i > j) exit\n\n    end do\n\n    if (left < j) call quicksort_desc(arr, left, j)\n\n    if (i < right) call quicksort_desc(arr, i, right)\n\nend subroutine quicksort_desc\n\nThis sorts in descending order.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\n   allocate(sorted_active(active_count))\n\n   sorted_active = active(1:active_count)\n\n   call quicksort_desc(sorted_active, 1, active_count)\n\nThen, proceed with processing each element in sorted_active.\n\nNow, the next variable is initialized to size (the last index of S array).\n\nThen, for each slime in sorted_active:\n\n   while next >=1 and (S(next) >= slime or spawned(next)):\n\n       next = next -1\n\n   if next <1 \u2192 output \"No\" and exit.\n\n   spawned(next) = .true.\n\n   add to activated array.\n\nWait, the activated array is an array of size active_count.\n\nSo:\n\n   allocate(activated(active_count))\n\n   do i =1, active_count\n\n       slime = sorted_active(i)\n\n       do while (next >=1 .and. (S(next) >= slime .or. spawned(next)))\n\n           next = next -1\n\n       end do\n\n       if (next <1) then\n\n           print *, 'No'\n\n           call process_second_part('No') \u2192 but no, we need to handle this.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if we detect that next <1, we need to output the second part's result based on \"No\".\n\nWait, but in the first part's processing, if it outputs \"No\", then the second part's input is \"No\".\n\nSo, in the code, when we detect that next <1, we can immediately set the first_result to \"No\", then proceed to the second part.\n\nWait, but in the first part's processing, once we detect that, we can immediately exit the first part's processing, and proceed to the second part with the \"No\" string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n   do i =1, active_count\n\n       slime = sorted_active(i)\n\n       do while (next >=1 .and. (S(next) >= slime .or. spawned(next)))\n\n           next = next -1\n\n       end do\n\n       if (next <1) then\n\n           first_result = 'No'\n\n           goto 100\n\n       end if\n\n       spawned(next) = .true.\n\n       activated(i) = S(next)\n\n       next = next -1 \u2192 Wait, no, the next is decremented in the loop, but after processing this slime, we leave next as it is (since the next slime may need to continue from there).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the next variable is decremented in the while loop, and after processing this slime, the next is left at the position after the found element. So the next slime will continue from that next value.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe next variable is initialized to size-1 (in Java's 0-based) at the start of each iteration.\n\nWait, no, in the Java code, for each iteration of the outer loop (each of the N steps):\n\n   next is initialized to size-1 (the last index).\n\n   Then, for each slime in the active list (sorted in reverse order):\n\n       while (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) \u2192 decrement next.\n\n       if next <0 \u2192 output No.\n\n       mark spawned[next] as true.\n\n       add to activated.\n\n   So, the next variable is decremented until it finds an unspawned element less than the slime.\n\n   The next is then left at that position, and the next slime in the loop will continue from there.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the next variable is decremented in the while loop, and after processing this slime, the next is left at the found position (the next element to check for the next slime is next-1? Or not, because after finding the element, next is not decremented further unless the next slime's loop continues.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter finding the next element (say, at position k), the next is set to k, and then spawned(k) is set to true. The next slime will start from k-1 (since next is now k, and the next iteration of the loop for the next slime will start with next =k, and check if S(next) >= slime or spawned.\n\nWait, no, after processing the current slime, the next is at k (the found position). The next slime will start with next =k, and the while loop will check again.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter finding the next element (the first element less than slime and unspawned), the next is at that position. Then, spawned is set to true, and the next slime will start from that next (now, since spawned is true, the next will have to go further back).\n\nWait, let me see with an example:\n\nSuppose next starts at position 5 (the last element). Suppose the first slime is 10, and S(5) is 10, but spawned is already true (since it was the initial element). So the while loop will decrement next to 4. Suppose S(4) is 9, and not spawned. Then, next is 4, which is less than slime (10), and not spawned. So the loop stops. So the next is 4. Then, spawned(4) is set to true, and activated gets S(4)=9. The next slime will start with next=4, but since spawned(4) is now true, the while loop will check S(4) >= next slime's value or spawned. So it will decrement next to 3, etc.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the next variable is correctly handled by the while loop.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\n   next = size\n\n   do i =1, active_count\n\n       slime = sorted_active(i)\n\n       do while (next >=1 .and. (S(next) >= slime .or. spawned(next)))\n\n           next = next -1\n\n       end do\n\n       if (next <1) then\n\n           first_result = 'No'\n\n           goto 100\n\n       end if\n\n       spawned(next) = .true.\n\n       activated(i) = S(next)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! After processing all slimes in this iteration:\n\n   ! Now, add activated to active.\n\n   do j =1, active_count\n\n       active(active_count +j) = activated(j)\n\n   end do\n\n   active_count = active_count *2\n\n   deallocate(activated)\n\n   deallocate(sorted_active)\n\nend do\n\nAfter all N iterations, set first_result to 'Yes'.\n\nThen, after the first part's processing, we have first_result as 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nThen, we need to process this string through the second part's logic.\n\nThe second part's processing:\n\nThe input string is first_result (either 'Yes' or 'No').\n\nWe need to process this string with the stack logic.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize stack array, say of size 100 (since the input is at most 3 characters).\n\ntop =0\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(first_result)\n\n   char = first_result(i:i)\n\n   top = top +1\n\n   stack(top) = char\n\n   do while (top >=2)\n\n       p = stack(top)\n\n       q = stack(top-1)\n\n       if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or.

But in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Alternatively, using an array of characters.\n\nAlternatively, using a character array stack(100) and track top.\n\nWait, in the code above, the stack is declared as a character(len=100) variable, but that's a single string of length 100. To use it as an array, perhaps better to use a character array:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: stack(100)\n\nThen, stack(1:top) holds the elements.\n\nSo modifying the second part's code:\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(100) :: stack\n\n    integer :: top =0\n\n    count =0\n\n    do i=1, len_trim(first_result)\n\n        character(len=1) :: c = first_result(i:i)\n\n        top = top +1\n\n        stack(top) = c\n\n        do while (top >=2)\n\n            character(len=1) :: p = stack(top)\n\n            character(len=1) :: q = stack(top-1)\n\n            if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or.

Since we allocated it as size=size (which is 2^N), that's okay.\n\n- The quicksort subroutines must be correctly implemented.\n\n- The sorting in the first part must be correct.\n\n- The stack processing in the second part must correctly handle the characters.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSuppose N=1, and the input array S is [1,2].\n\nThen, size=2.\n\nAfter sorting S becomes [1,2].\n\nspawned(2) is true.\n\nInitial active is [2].\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\n   sorted_active is [2], sorted in descending order (already).\n\n   next starts at 2.\n\n   For the first slime (2):\n\n       while next >=1 and (S(2)=2 >=2 or spawned(2)=true \u2192 yes.\n\n       So decrement next to 1.\n\n       Check S(1)=1 <2, and spawned(1)=false \u2192 so next=1.\n\n       So, spawned(1) is set to true.\n\n       activated(1) =1.\n\n   Then, active becomes [2,1], active_count=2.\n\nAfter N=1 iterations, first_result is 'Yes'.\n\nThe second part processes 'Yes' \u2192 the stack processing gives count 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case: if the first program outputs 'No', then the second part's input is 'No', which also has no 0/1 pairs \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs 'Yes', and the second's input is '01', then the count would be 1 \u2192 output 2.\n\nBut in the first program's case, to get '01' as output, the first program must output '01', but that's not possible since the first program's output is only 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nThus, the code should handle the cases correctly.\n\nNow, compiling all this into the final Fortran code."
