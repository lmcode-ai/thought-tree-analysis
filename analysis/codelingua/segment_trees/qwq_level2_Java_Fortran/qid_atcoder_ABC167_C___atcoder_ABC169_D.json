    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC167_C). It reads input values n, m, x, then an array a of size n by m+1. It then iterates over all subsets of the n books (since it's using a bitmask up to 2^n), checks each subset to see if the sum of each subject's ALU meets or exceeds x, and keeps track of the minimum cost (res[0]). The output is the minimum cost or -1 if none.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC169_D) takes a long n, factors it, and calculates some answer based on the exponents of the prime factors. The output is this answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. Therefore, the Fortran program must first process the first problem's input, compute its result, then use that result as the input to the second problem's computation, and output the final result of the second.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first problem), compute the first problem's answer, then pass that answer as input to the second problem's computation, then output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the first problem's input (n, m, x, then the a array).\n2. Compute the first problem's minimum cost (min).\n3. Use that min as the input n for the second problem.\n4. Compute the second problem's answer based on that n.\n5. Output the second's answer.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a single long n. So the first program's output (min) is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing min, we need to pass that value into the second problem's code, which will process it as its input n.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first problem's input (n, m, x, then the a array).\n- Compute the first problem's min.\n- Then, use that min as the input to the second problem's code (so instead of reading from stdin, it uses min as the input n).\n- Then compute the second problem's answer and output it.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program):\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Java, the first program reads n, m, x, then for each of the n rows, m+1 integers (since the a array is n x m+1). The first element of each row (a[i][0]) is the cost, and the next m elements are the ALU for each subject.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare them with lower bounds. Alternatively, adjust indices.\n\nWe need to read n, m, x first. Then read n rows, each with m+1 integers. So in Fortran:\n\nRead(n, m, x) from input.\n\nThen, declare a 2D array a(n, m+1). Then read each row.\n\nThen, the bitmask loop: iterate from 1 to 2^n -1? Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < Math.pow(2, n); i++). So all possible subsets, including the empty set. But in the code, the empty set would have res all zero, so unless x is zero, it won't be considered. But the problem requires that all subjects have at least x, so the empty set is only valid if all res[j] (for j 1..m) are >=x, which is impossible unless x is zero. But the problem probably requires that at least one book is chosen. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe code checks if flag is true (all subjects meet x), then updates min. The initial min is Integer.MAX_VALUE. So if no subset meets the condition, it outputs -1.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, we need to loop over all subsets (including the empty set?), but the code in Java does that. So in Fortran, the loop would be from 0 to 2^n -1, but in Fortran, integers can't be that big for n up to, say, 20? Wait, the problem constraints for ABC167 C probably have n up to 20, since 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable. Let me check the problem constraints for that problem. Well, assuming that n is small enough for the bitmask approach.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop over all subsets can be done with a loop variable i from 0 to 2**n -1. But in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. However, for n up to 20, 2^20 is 1,048,576 which is manageable.\n\nNow, for each subset (i), we need to check which books are selected. The Java code uses status array, but in Fortran, perhaps we can compute on the fly.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each bit in the bitmask i, they check if the j-th bit is set (using (1 & (i >> j)) ==1). Wait, that's a bit odd. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code in Java for status:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n    if ((1 & i >> j) == 1) {\n        status[j] = 1;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, that's equivalent to checking if the j-th bit is set. Because shifting i right by j bits, then AND with 1. So for each j from 0 to n-1, the j-th bit (from the right) is checked. So for example, for j=0, it's the least significant bit.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a given i (integer), to check if the j-th bit is set (for j from 0 to n-1), we can compute (i / 2**j) mod 2.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can loop over each bit.\n\nBut perhaps in Fortran, it's better to loop over each book (j from 1 to n?), and check if the bit is set in the current subset.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare with appropriate bounds. Let me think about variables.\n\nFirst, in the first problem's code:\n\nInitialize min as a large value (like huge(0) for integers). Then for each subset (i from 0 to 2**n -1):\n\nInitialize res array (m+1 elements, starting from 0 to m). res(0) is the total cost, res(1..m) are the subject ALUs.\n\nFor each book j (from 1 to n):\n\nif the j-th bit (since in Java j starts at 0, so in Fortran, perhaps j starts at 1, so the j-th bit is (j-1) in 0-based) is set in i, then add the book's a(j,:) to res.\n\nWait, in Java, the books are 0-based (i from 0 to n-1). So in Fortran, if we have a(n, m+1), then the first book is 1, so for j from 1 to n, the bit position is j-1.\n\nSo for a given i (integer), to check if book j is selected, we can compute (i / 2**(j-1)) mod 2.\n\nAlternatively, using bit operations in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can loop over each bit:\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to loop over each book, and check if the bit is set.\n\nOnce the res array is computed, check if all res(1) to res(m) >=x. If yes, then compare res(0) to min.\n\nSo in Fortran code steps:\n\nRead n, m, x.\n\nRead the a array (n rows, each with m+1 integers).\n\nInitialize min to a large value (like 1e9 or huge(0)).\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 2**n -1:\n\n   total_cost = 0\n\n   subject_ALU(1:m) = 0\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (btest(i, j-1)) then  ! j-1 because bits are 0-based\n\n          total_cost = total_cost + a(j,1)  ! a(j,1) is the cost (since in Java a[i][0] is the cost, stored in first column here?)\n\nWait, wait, in the Java code, the a array is n rows, each with m+1 elements. The first element (j=0) is the cost, then the next m elements are the ALUs for each subject.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is a(n, m+1), then a(1,1) would be the first book's cost, a(1,2) is subject 1's ALU, etc.\n\nWait, in Java, for each row i (0-based), a[i][0] is the cost, a[i][1] to a[i][m] are the ALUs for each subject. So in Fortran, the first column (column 1) is the cost, columns 2 to m+1 are the subjects 1 to m.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for reading the a array is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) a[i][j] = sc.nextInt();\n}\n\nSo for each row i (0-based), the first element (j=0) is the cost, then j=1 to m are the subjects.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the a array is (n rows, m+1 columns). So a(1,1) is the first book's cost, a(1,2) is subject 1's ALU, etc.\n\nTherefore, when processing a book j (1-based in Fortran), the cost is a(j,1), and the ALUs are a(j,2) to a(j, m+1).\n\nSo in the loop over books:\n\nfor each book j (1 to n):\n\n   if the bit is set (btest(i, j-1)), then add a(j,1) to total_cost, and add a(j,2) to a(j, m+1) to the subject_ALU array.\n\nWait, but in the code, the res array in Java is initialized as res[k] += a[j][k]. The res array in Java has m+1 elements, with res[0] being the total cost, and res[1..m] the subject ALUs.\n\nSo in Fortran, the res array can be an array of size m+1, with res(1) being the cost, and res(2) to res(m+1) the subjects.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, res is initialized as new int[m+1], so res[0] is the cost, res[1] to res[m] are the subjects. So in Fortran, the res array would be of size m+1, with res(1) being the cost, and res(2) to res(m+1) the subjects.\n\nWait, but in the code, when adding a[j][k], for k from 0 to m:\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each book j (0-based), when it's selected, they loop over k from 0 to m, adding a[j][k] to res[k].\n\nSo res[0] is the sum of a[j][0] (cost) for selected books, and res[1] is sum of a[j][1], etc.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the res array would be:\n\nres(1) = sum of a(j,1) for selected books (since a(j,1) is the cost, which is a[j][0] in Java).\n\nres(2) = sum of a(j,2) (Java's a[j][1]), etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code for the subset i would be:\n\nInitialize res(1) = 0, res(2:m+1) = 0.\n\nThen for each j from 1 to n:\n\n   if (btest(i, j-1)) then\n\n      res(1) = res(1) + a(j,1)\n\n      do k = 2, m+1\n\n          res(k) = res(k) + a(j,k)\n\n      end do\n\n   end if\n\nThen, check if all res(2) to res(m+1) >=x.\n\nIf yes, then compare res(1) to min.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, after computing min, we need to pass it to the second problem.\n\nThe second problem's Java code takes a long n (the input), factors it, and computes an answer.\n\nThe second problem's code:\n\nThe code reads a single long n, then computes sqrt(n), then for each i from 2 to sqrt(n), it divides n by i as much as possible, counts the exponent (count), then for j from 1 upwards until count -j <0, adds to answer. Then if remaining n>1, adds 1.\n\nWait, let me see the code:\n\nIn the second Java code:\n\nlong n = scanner.nextLong();\n\nint sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);\n\nint answer =0;\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=sqrt; i++) {\n\n    int count=0;\n\n    while (n%i ==0) { n/=i; count++; }\n\n    for (int j=1; count-j >=0; j++) {\n\n        count -=j;\n\n        answer++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (n>1) answer++;\n\nWait, no, the code in the second loop is:\n\nfor (int j=1; count -j >=0; j++) {\n\n    count -=j;\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose count is 5.\n\nj starts at 1:\n\ncount -j >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 5-1=4, answer +=1.\n\nj increments to 2:\n\n4-2=2 >=0 \u2192 yes. count becomes 2, answer +=1.\n\nj=3: 2-3 is negative \u2192 loop stops.\n\nTotal added 2 times (j=1 and 2). So for count=5, the loop runs for j=1 and 2, adding 2 to answer.\n\nWait, but the loop's condition is count-j >=0. So for j=3, 2-3 is -1 <0 \u2192 loop stops. So total steps for count=5 is 2.\n\nWait, but the code's inner loop is:\n\nfor (j from 1 upwards until count-j <0):\n\neach iteration subtracts j from count, and increments answer.\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nfor (j=1; count-j >=0; j++) {\n\n    count -=j;\n\n    answer++;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop condition is checked before each iteration. So for count=5:\n\nFirst iteration j=1:\n\ncount-j =5-1=4 >=0 \u2192 enter loop.\n\ncount becomes 5-1=4, answer becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration j=2:\n\ncount-j is 4-2=2 >=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 4-2=2, answer 2.\n\nNext j=3:\n\ncount-j is 2-3 =-1 <0 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nSo total 2 increments.\n\nWait, but the loop variable j is incremented each time, but the count is being modified. So the loop is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the inner loop is trying to find how many terms in the sequence 1, 2, 3,... can be subtracted from count until it can't anymore, and each step contributes 1 to the answer.\n\nThe total number of steps is the maximum k such that 1+2+...+k \u2264 count.\n\nBecause the sum of 1+2+...+k =k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count.\n\nThe maximum k where this holds is the integer part of (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2.\n\nThe number of terms is k, so the inner loop adds k to the answer.\n\nWait, but in the code, the inner loop is adding 1 for each j step. So for count=5, the loop runs for j=1 and 2, so adds 2 to the answer. Which is exactly the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u22645 \u2192 3 terms (1+2+3=6>5 \u2192 so k=2, sum 3, but 2*3/2=3 \u22645, but 3 terms would be 6. So the maximum k is 2, so the answer increases by 2.\n\nWait, but the code's inner loop for count=5 gives 2, which matches.\n\nSo the inner loop's contribution is the maximum k where k(k+1)/2 \u2264 count.\n\nThus, the inner loop can be replaced with calculating k = floor( (sqrt(8*count +1) -1)/2 ), and adding k to the answer.\n\nBut in code, the original approach is to loop through j until it can't.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps it's easier to compute k via the formula, but for code correctness, perhaps better to replicate the loop.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the inner loop can be written as:\n\ncount = exponent of prime i.\n\nanswer =0\n\nthen:\n\nj=1\n\ndo while (count -j >=0)\n\n    count = count -j\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop variable j is incremented each time. So in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\ninteger :: j=1\n\ndo while (count -j >=0)\n\n    count = count -j\n\n    answer = answer +1\n\n    j = j +1\n\nend do\n\nYes, that would replicate the same steps.\n\nSo the code for the second problem in Fortran would be:\n\nRead the input n (which is the min from the first problem).\n\nInitialize answer=0.\n\nCompute sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n))).\n\nLoop i from 2 to sqrt_n:\n\n    count =0\n\n    do while (mod(n,i) ==0)\n\n        n = n/i\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end do\n\n    if (count >0) then\n\n        j=1\n\n        do while (count -j >=0)\n\n            count = count -j\n\n            answer = answer +1\n\n            j = j +1\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, check if n>1:\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    j=1\n\n    do while (count -j >=0) \u2192 Wait, no, here n is the remaining prime factor (since after the loop, n could be a prime larger than sqrt(original n)), so the exponent is 1 (since it's a prime factor left).\n\nWait, in the code, after the loop over i up to sqrt(n), if n>1, then it's a prime factor with exponent 1. So for that case, the inner loop would be:\n\ncount =1 (since exponent is 1)\n\nthen j starts at 1:\n\ncount -j =0 \u2192 yes.\n\nso count becomes 0, answer +=1.\n\nThen j increments to 2, but count-j is -1 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nThus, adding 1 to the answer.\n\nHence, in the code, after the main loop, if n>1, we need to process it as a prime with exponent 1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (n >1) then\n\n    count =1\n\n    j=1\n\n    do while (count -j >=0)\n\n        count = count -j\n\n        answer = answer +1\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nThus, the total answer is computed.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program must first read the input for the first problem, compute min, then use that min as the input n for the second problem, compute the answer, and output it.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nFirst problem variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, x, min_val, i, j, k\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: a\n\nSecond problem variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: n_second  ! Because the input can be up to 1e18 (since Java uses long), so in Fortran, use integer(8)\n\ninteger :: answer, sqrt_n, count, j_inner\n\nWait, but in the second problem, the input n can be up to 1e18, so in Fortran, we need to use 64-bit integers. So variables like n_second should be integer(8).\n\nBut in the first problem's min_val can be up to, say, 1e5 * 20 (if each book's cost is 1e5 and n is 20), so 2e6, which fits in 32-bit.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nProgram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, x, min_val = huge(0), i, j, k\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)\n\n    integer(8) :: n_second, answer, sqrt_n\n\n    ! Read first problem's input\n\n    read*, n, m, x\n\n    allocate(a(n, m+1))\n\n    do i=1, n\n\n        read*, a(i, 1:m+1)\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute first problem's min_val\n\n    do i=0, 2**n -1\n\n        integer :: res(m+1)\n\n        res = 0\n\n        do j=1, n\n\n            if (btest(i, j-1)) then\n\n                res(1) = res(1) + a(j,1)\n\n                do k=2, m+1\n\n                    res(k) = res(k) + a(j,k)\n\n                end do\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        logical :: flag = .true.\n\n        do k=2, m+1\n\n            if (res(k) < x) then\n\n                flag = .false.\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (flag) then\n\n            if (res(1) < min_val) then\n\n                min_val = res(1)\n\n            end if\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, pass min_val to second problem\n\n    n_second = min_val\n\n    if (n_second == huge(0)) then\n\n        ! which would mean no solution, but the first problem would output -1, but the second problem's input is -1?\n\n        ! Wait, in the first problem, if min_val remains as Integer.MAX_VALUE (huge(0)), then the first program outputs -1. But the second program's input is that -1, but the second program expects a positive integer?\n\n        Wait, the first problem's output is either min_val (if found) or -1. But the second problem's input is that output. So if the first problem outputs -1, then the second problem's input is -1, but the second problem's code would process it as a long, but the code would have issues (since n is negative, sqrt would be problematic).\n\n        However, according to the problem statement, the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the case where the first program outputs -1, the second program must process that as its input. But in the second problem's code, if n is -1, then the code would have undefined behavior. But according to the problem's original setup, perhaps the first problem's output is only valid when min is found, but the problem requires that the Fortran program must handle all cases as per the original Java chain.\n\n        So in the Fortran code, if the first problem's min_val is still huge(0), then the second problem's input is -1. But in the second problem's code, when n is -1, the code would have:\n\n        n = -1 \u2192 sqrt(n) would be an error (since sqrt of negative number is not allowed in Fortran). So this is a problem.\n\n        Wait, but in the original Java code for the second problem, the input is a long. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program's input is -1, which is a valid long. But the code for the second problem would process it as n = -1. Then, in the code:\n\n        sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n); \u2192 but sqrt of negative is NaN, so in Java, Math.sqrt(-1) returns NaN, so (int) NaN is 0. Then the loop for i from 2 to 0 (since sqrt is 0) \u2192 loop doesn't run. Then, since n is -1, which is not >1, so the final if (n>1) is false. So the answer is 0. But the second program would output 0.\n\n        However, in the problem's context, perhaps the first problem's output is only valid when min is found (so the second problem's input is a positive integer). But according to the problem's instruction, the Fortran program must behave exactly as the original chain. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program must read that as input and process it. So in Fortran, we need to handle that case.\n\n        So in the Fortran code, when min_val is huge(0), then n_second = -1 (since in Java, the first program outputs -1 in that case). So in Fortran, we need to set n_second = -1 in that case.\n\n        Wait, in the first problem's code, the min_val is initialized to huge(0). If after processing all subsets, min_val remains huge(0), then the first program outputs -1. So in the Fortran code, after computing min_val, we need to check if it's still huge(0), and set n_second to -1 in that case.\n\n        So adding:\n\n        if (min_val == huge(0)) then\n\n            n_second = -1\n\n        else\n\n            n_second = min_val\n\n        end if\n\n        Because otherwise, when min_val is huge(0), n_second would be a very large integer (since huge(0) is 2^31-1 for 32-bit integers), but in the first problem's code, it outputs -1, so the second program's input is -1.\n\n        So that's an important correction.\n\n    So after computing min_val, we have to set n_second to -1 if min_val is still huge(0).\n\n    Now, proceeding with the second problem's code.\n\n    So:\n\n    ! Handle the case where min_val was not found\n\n    if (min_val == huge(0)) then\n\n        n_second = -1\n\n    else\n\n        n_second = min_val\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now compute the second problem's answer\n\n    answer =0\n\n    if (n_second <1) then\n\n        ! if n_second is -1, then the second problem's code would process it as n =-1, leading to answer 0.\n\n        ! Because in the second problem's code, the loop over i from 2 to sqrt(n) (which would be 0 for n=-1), so no iterations. Then, since n is -1, which is not >1, so answer remains 0.\n\n        ! So in Fortran, if n_second is negative, the answer is 0.\n\n        answer =0\n\n    else\n\n        ! proceed with the code\n\n        sqrt_n = int(sqrt(real(n_second)))\n\n        do i=2, sqrt_n\n\n            count =0\n\n            do while (mod(n_second, i) ==0)\n\n                n_second = n_second / i\n\n                count = count +1\n\n            end do\n\n            if (count >0) then\n\n                j_inner =1\n\n                do while (count - j_inner >=0)\n\n                    count = count - j_inner\n\n                    answer = answer +1\n\n                    j_inner = j_inner +1\n\n                end do\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        !

Because otherwise, modifying n_second would affect the remaining steps.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The first problem's loop over i from 0 to 2**n -1. For n up to 20, 2^20 is manageable, but in Fortran, 2**n can be written as 2**n, but for n=20, that's 1e6 iterations, which is okay.\n\n- The inner loops for the first problem's res array.\n\n- The second problem's code uses integer(8) for temp_n, which is necessary for handling up to 1e18.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: First problem's output is -1 (min_val is huge(0)), so second problem's input is -1 \u2192 output 0.\n\nTest case 2: First problem's output is 0 (if possible?), but probably not, but the code should handle it.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take a simple case for the first problem.\n\nSuppose n=1, m=1, x=1.\n\nThe a array has one row: [1, 1]. So the only subset is selecting the book (i=1 in binary 1). The res[0] is 1, res[1] is 1 >=1 \u2192 min is 1. So second problem's input is 1.\n\nSecond problem's code with n=1:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The loop from i=2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. Then, since temp_n is 1, which is not >1 \u2192 answer remains 0. So output is 0.\n\nWait, but in the second problem's code, when n=1, the code would output 0?\n\nWait, let's see the second problem's code:\n\nIn Java, for n=1:\n\nsqrt is 1. The loop runs from i=2 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. Then, since n (after loop) is 1, which is not >1 \u2192 so answer is 0. So yes, the code would output 0.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case for the second problem:\n\nn=4 (from first problem's output).\n\nSecond problem's code:\n\nn=4.\n\nsqrt(4)=2.\n\nLoop i=2 to 2:\n\ni=2:\n\ncount=0.\n\ntemp_n is 4.\n\nmod(4,2)=0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u2192 temp_n=2, count=1.\n\nAgain mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 temp_n=1, count=2.\n\nLoop exits.\n\ncount is 2.\n\nThen, inner loop:\n\nj_inner starts at 1.\n\ncount -j_inner =2-1=1 \u22650 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 1, answer +=1 (now 1).\n\nj_inner becomes 2.\n\ncount -2 =1-2 =-1 \u2192 no. So loop stops.\n\nThus, added 1.\n\nThen, since temp_n is 1, no further processing.\n\nThus, answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let's see what the code would do:\n\nThe inner loop for count=2:\n\nj starts at 1:\n\ncount -1 =1 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 1, answer +=1 (1).\n\nj increments to 2:\n\ncount (now 1) -2 \u2192 -1 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nThus, total 1 added.\n\nSo the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but what is the correct answer for n=4?\n\nThe problem's second code's logic is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping terms in the sequence 1, 2, 3,... such that their sum is \u2264 exponent.\n\nWait, the exponent here is 2 (for prime 2^2).\n\nThe maximum k where 1+2+...+k \u22642 \u2192 1+2=3>2 \u2192 so k=1 (sum 1 \u22642). So the answer for exponent 2 is 1.\n\nHence, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case for second problem: n=6.\n\nSuppose first problem's output is 6.\n\nSecond problem's code:\n\ntemp_n=6.\n\nsqrt(6) is ~2.449 \u2192 sqrt_n=2.\n\nLoop i from 2 to 2:\n\ni=2:\n\nmod(6,2)=0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u2192 temp_n=3, count=1.\n\nAgain mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 stop. count=1.\n\nThen, inner loop for count=1:\n\nj=1 \u2192 count -1=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount becomes 0, answer +=1 \u2192 answer=1.\n\nj increments to 2 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nThen, after loop, temp_n is 3, which is >1 \u2192 process as prime with exponent 1.\n\ncount=1.\n\nj starts at 1:\n\ncount -1=0 \u2192 yes. count becomes 0, answer +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nThus, total answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct: 6 factors into 2^1 *3^1. For each exponent 1:\n\nFor 2^1: the maximum k where sum 1 \u22641 \u2192 k=1 \u2192 adds 1.\n\nFor 3^1: same \u2192 adds another 1. Total 2.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut in the first problem's code, the loop over i from 0 to 2**n -1 may have an issue with the upper limit. Because in Fortran, 2**n can be a very large integer. For n=20, 2^20 is 1,048,576 which is manageable, but for n=30, it's over a billion, which may be too much. But assuming the problem constraints are such that n is small enough (like up to 20), it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the loop variable i must be an integer. For n up to 31, 2^31 is about 2e9 which is within 32-bit integer. But for n=32, it's over. But given the problem's context, it's probably okay.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI need to write the program with all these steps.\n\nAlso, in the first problem's code, the res array is declared inside the loop over i. In Fortran, variables can be declared inside blocks, but in older versions, they must be at the top. However, in modern Fortran (F90+), you can declare variables inside loops.\n\nWait, in the first problem's loop over i:\n\ndo i=0, 2**n -1\n\n    integer :: res(m+1)\n\n    res = 0\n\n    ...\n\nend do\n\nThis is allowed in Fortran 90 and later.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe final Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, x, min_val, i, j, k\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)\n    integer(8) :: n_second, answer, temp_n, sqrt_n\n    integer :: count, j_inner\n\n    !

Output the final answer\n    print*, answer\n\nend program main\n\nI think this should work. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nIn the first problem's loop over i, the loop variable i is an integer. For n up to 20, 2^20 is 1,048,576 which is within 32-bit integer (max is 2^31-1 ~2e9). So okay.\n\nThe res array is declared inside the loop, which is okay in Fortran 90.\n\nThe flag is set correctly.\n\nThe second problem's code uses temp_n, which is a copy of n_second, so modifications are okay.\n\nEdge case when n_second is 0? Well, the first problem's min_val can't be zero unless the cost is zero and the subjects meet x. But the second problem's code would process n_second=0, leading to sqrt(0)=0, so loop doesn't run. Then temp_n is 0, so the remaining check (temp_n>1) is false. So answer remains 0. But if the first problem's min_val is zero, then the second problem's input is zero, and the code would output 0. That's correct according to the second problem's code.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second problem's code, when temp_n is 0, but that can only happen if the first problem's min_val is zero, which is allowed if the problem's conditions are met. The second problem's code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother check: when the first problem's min_val is 0, then the second problem's input is 0, and the code's answer is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this should be correct."
