    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC028_A). It reads two integers n and m, computes their GCD, then reads two strings s and t. Then it checks for each k from 0 to gcd-1 whether the characters at positions (k*n/gcd) in s and (k*m/gcd) in t are the same. If any of these positions differ, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs (n*m)/gcd. \n\nWait, actually, the code uses IntStream.range(0, gcd) which goes from 0 to gcd-1. The filter checks if the characters at those positions are different. If any such k exists, then the first findAny would return -1. If all are equal, then it returns (n*m/gcd). So the output is either -1 or the LCM of n and m.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC120_C) takes a string x, processes it with a stack. It pushes each character onto the stack. Then, whenever the stack has at least two elements, it pops the top two. If they are '0' and '1' in either order, it increments a counter and doesn't push them back. Otherwise, it pushes them back. The final output is twice the counter.\n\nSo the first program's output is either -1 or the LCM of n and m. The second program takes that output as input and processes it. Wait, but the second program's input is a string x. Wait, the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string x as input. So the first program's output is a number, which is then read as the input string for the second program. \n\nWait, the second Java program's InputReader reads the next token, which would be the output of the first program. So the first program's output is a number (either -1 or LCM), which is then the input to the second program's x variable. But the second program's x is a string, so the input to the second program is that number as a string. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is: \n\nInput to first program: n, m, s, t \u2192 output is a number (either -1 or LCM). \n\nThen, that number is the input to the second program, which processes it as a string. The second program's output is twice the count of pairs of '0' and '1' that can be removed in this stack-based way. \n\nSo the Fortran program must read the initial input (n, m, s, t), compute the first program's result, then pass that result as a string to the second program's processing, then output the final result.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. The key points are:\n\n1. The first part (Java's first program) must compute the LCM or -1, then pass that as a string to the second part (Java's second program's processing). \n\n2. The second part must process that string as the input x, then compute the count and output twice that count.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read n, m, s, t from input.\n\n- Compute GCD of n and m. Then check for each k from 0 to gcd-1 whether s's character at position (k*n/gcd) and t's at (k*m/gcd) are the same. If any differ, output is -1. Else, output LCM(n,m).\n\n- Then, take that output (either -1 or LCM) as the input string for the second part.\n\nWait, but in the original sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, after computing the first result, we need to pass that result as a string to the second part's processing. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n, m, s, t.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (either -1 or LCM).\n\n3. Convert that result to a string (since the second program's input is a string x).\n\n4. Process that string through the second program's logic (the stack-based counting).\n\n5. Output the final result from the second part.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nCompute GCD of n and m. In Fortran, there's a GCD function in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, but maybe better to implement it ourselves. Alternatively, use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nWait, Fortran has the GCD intrinsic function in Fortran 2008. Let me check. Yes, GCD is an intrinsic function in Fortran 2008. So we can use that.\n\nThen, compute the LCM as (n*m)/gcd. But need to ensure that division is integer. Since GCD divides both, so yes.\n\nThen, check for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\nThe positions in s and t are (k*n/gcd) and (k*m/gcd). Wait, but in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, strings are 1-based, so need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, s.charAt(k*n/gcd) would be the (k*n/gcd)th character (0-based). In Fortran, strings are 1-based, so the equivalent would be (k*n/gcd +1). Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in Java, for k=0, the position is 0, which is the first character. In Fortran, the first character is index 1. So the position in Fortran would be (k*n/gcd) +1? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=2, gcd=1. Then for k=0, the position in s is 0 (Java) \u2192 first character (index 1 in Fortran). So yes, the Fortran index is (k*n/gcd) +1? Wait, no. Wait, (k*n/gcd) is 0 \u2192 0+1=1. So yes. So in general, the Fortran index is (k*n/gcd) +1. Wait, but in Java, the index is exactly (k*n/gcd). So in Fortran, the string is 1-based, so the equivalent is (k*n/gcd)+1?\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Let's say n=4, m=6, gcd=2. Then for k=0, the position in s is 0 \u2192 first character (Fortran 1). For k=1, (1*4)/2 = 2 \u2192 third character (Fortran 3). So yes, the Fortran index is (k*n/gcd) +1? Wait, no. Wait, (k*n/gcd) is 0 \u2192 0+1=1, which is correct. For k=1, (1*4)/2 = 2 \u2192 2+1=3? Wait, but 2 is the 0-based index, so in Fortran it's 3. So yes, the Fortran index is (k*n/gcd)+1. Wait, but in Java, the index is exactly (k*n/gcd). So in Fortran, the equivalent is (k*n/gcd)+1. So that's the correct adjustment.\n\nTherefore, for each k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\nCheck s_char = s( (k*n/gcd)+1 )\n\nt_char = t( (k*m/gcd)+1 )\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are arrays, so s is a character array, and s(1) is the first character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read a string, you can use a character variable with a length. So perhaps we need to read s and t as strings, then process their characters.\n\nNow, the first part's code steps:\n\nRead n, m, s, t.\n\nCompute gcd = gcd(n, m)\n\nThen, loop over k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\nCompute pos_s = (k * n) / gcd \u2192 but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to ensure it's integer division. Since n and m are integers, and gcd divides both, so (k*n)/gcd is integer.\n\nThen, the position in s is pos_s +1 (since 0-based to 1-based).\n\nSimilarly for pos_t = (k*m)/gcd \u2192 position in t is pos_t +1.\n\nCheck if s(pos_s+1) == t(pos_t+1). If any of these are not equal, then the result is -1. Else, after all k, the result is (n*m)/gcd.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses IntStream.range(0, gcd) which is 0 to gcd-1. So yes, k from 0 to gcd-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can loop k from 0 to gcd-1 (but in Fortran loops are 1-based, so need to adjust).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop variable can be from 0 to gcd-1. Wait, no, in Fortran, the loop indices are integers, but you can have a loop like do k=0, gcd-1. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead n, m, s, t.\n\nCompute gcd = gcd(n, m)\n\nresult = -1\n\nvalid = .true.\n\ndo k = 0, gcd-1\n\n    pos_s = (k * n) / gcd\n\n    pos_t = (k * m) / gcd\n\n    if (s(pos_s +1) /= t(pos_t +1)) then\n\n        valid = .false.\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif (valid) then\n\n    lcm = (n * m) / gcd\n\n    result = lcm\n\nend if\n\nSo the first part's result is either -1 or the LCM.\n\nThen, the second part takes this result as a string. So we need to convert the result to a string, then process it through the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\nTake the input string x (which is the first program's output as a string). Then, process it with a stack. For each character in x, push to stack. Then, while the stack has at least two elements, check the top two. If they are '0' and '1' in any order, pop them and increment the count. Else, break and continue.\n\nWait, the Java code's loop is:\n\nfor each character in x:\n\n    push to stack\n\n    then, while stack has >=2 elements:\n\n        pop p and q (wait, in Java, they pop p first, then q. Wait, the code does:\n\n        s.pop() \u2192 p is the top, then s.pop() \u2192 q is the next below p.\n\n        So the order is p is the top, q is the one below.\n\n        So the pair is q and p? Because when you pop twice, first p is popped (top), then q is the next top.\n\n        So the two elements are q (the one below) and p (the one above). Wait, no, the order is p is the first popped, then q is the next popped. So the two elements are p (top) and q (second from top). So the pair is q and p? Or p and q?\n\n        The code checks if (p == '1' and q == '0') or (p == '0' and q == '1'). So the pair is p and q. So the two elements are p (top) and q (second top). So the pair is p and q. \n\n        So if they are '0' and '1' in any order, then they form a pair. So if p is '1' and q is '0', then yes. Or p is '0' and q is '1', then yes. So the condition is (p == '1' and q == '0') or (p == '0' and q == '1') \u2192 which is equivalent to (p .ne. q) and (one is '0' and the other '1').\n\n        So when this is true, the count increases by 1, and the two are not pushed back. Else, they are pushed back and the loop breaks.\n\n        So the process is: after pushing the current character, check the top two. If they form a 0-1 pair, remove them and count +=1. Else, stop checking for this step.\n\n        So the stack processing is done after each character is pushed.\n\nSo in Fortran, to implement this:\n\nWe need to process the string (the result from first part as a string) character by character.\n\nWe can use a stack implemented as a dynamic array or a list. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in stack, we can use an array with a pointer to the top.\n\nInitialize stack as an array of characters, with a top index starting at 0.\n\ncount = 0\n\nThen, for each character c in the input string (the first program's result as a string):\n\n    push c to stack (top = top +1, stack(top) = c)\n\n    then, while top >=1 (since we need at least two elements):\n\n        p = stack(top)\n\n        q = stack(top-1)\n\n        if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n            count = count +1\n\n            top = top -2  ! remove the two elements\n\n        else\n\n            exit the loop\n\n        end if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, they are not pushed back. So the stack's top is reduced by 2. But in the code's loop, after popping, they check again. Wait, the Java code's loop is:\n\nwhile (s.size() >1):\n\n    p = pop\n\n    q = pop\n\n    if (they form a pair):\n\n        count +=1\n\n        continue (so loop again)\n\n    else:\n\n        push back q and p, break\n\nWait, the Java code's loop is:\n\nafter pushing the current character, enter a loop that runs while the stack has size >1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\npop p, then pop q.\n\nif the pair is 0 and 1 (in any order):\n\n    count +=1 \u2192 and continue the loop (so the next iteration will check again the new top elements.\n\nelse:\n\n    push back q and p \u2192 so the stack is restored to before the pops, then break the loop.\n\nWait, so in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, they are discarded, and the loop continues (so the next iteration will check the new top elements). If not, they are pushed back and the loop breaks.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\nAfter pushing the current character, enter a loop:\n\ndo while (top >=1) \u2192 since stack has at least two elements (indices 0 and 1, if top is 1, then elements 0 and 1? Wait, maybe better to track the top as the next available index. Let me think of the stack as an array with elements from 1 to top.\n\nWait, perhaps better to represent the stack as an array with indices 1 to current_top. So when you push, current_top increases by 1. The top element is at current_top.\n\nSo when the stack has at least two elements (current_top >=2):\n\n    p = stack(current_top)\n\n    q = stack(current_top-1)\n\n    if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n        current_top = current_top -2\n\n    else\n\n        exit the loop\n\n    end if\n\nWait, but in Java, after popping p and q, if they form a pair, they are not pushed back, so the stack's size decreases by 2. So in Fortran, after checking, if they form a pair, we can just decrease current_top by 2. But if not, we have to push them back? Wait no, in the Java code, when they don't form a pair, they are pushed back in reverse order? Wait, in Java code:\n\np = s.pop() \u2192 top element.\n\nq = s.pop() \u2192 next element.\n\nif not a pair, then s.push(q), s.push(p). So the stack is restored to before the pops. So the order is preserved.\n\nWait, in the Java code, after popping p and q, if they are not a pair, then they are pushed back in the same order: first q, then p. Because s.push(q) adds q to the top, then s.push(p) adds p on top of q. So the stack is back to the state before the pops. So the loop breaks, and the next character is processed.\n\nIn Fortran, to mimic this, after checking p and q, if they are not a pair, we have to push them back. But since we are using an array, perhaps it's easier to track the current_top and not actually pop, but just check and adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fortran code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize stack as an array of sufficient size (maybe 1000 elements, since the input is a number which can be up to, say, 1e18, but as a string, it's manageable).\n\ncurrent_top =0\n\ncount =0\n\nThen, for each character c in the input string (the first program's result as a string):\n\n    current_top = current_top +1\n\n    stack(current_top) = c\n\n    do while (current_top >=2)\n\n        p = stack(current_top)\n\n        q = stack(current_top-1)\n\n        if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n            count = count +1\n\n            current_top = current_top -2\n\n        else\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nWait, this might work. Let's see:\n\nSuppose after pushing the new character, the stack has at least two elements. We check the top two. If they form a pair, we remove them (current_top -=2), and then check again the new top two (since after removing two, the new top may still have two elements). \n\nWait, but in the Java code, after removing the pair, the loop continues (since the 'continue' statement). So in the Java code, after removing the pair, the loop continues to check again. So in the Fortran code, the do while loop will continue as long as current_top >=2. \n\nYes, this seems correct. Because after removing the two elements (current_top -=2), the loop will check again if there are still two elements. \n\nSo this approach should work. \n\nTherefore, the steps for the second part are:\n\nTake the first program's result (either -1 or LCM), convert it to a string (as a character array), then process each character through the stack as above, then output count *2.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, s, t from input.\n\n2. Compute the first part's result (either -1 or LCM).\n\n3. Convert that result to a string (x_str).\n\n4. Process x_str through the stack-based algorithm to get count.\n\n5. Output count *2.\n\nNow, handling the first part's result as a string:\n\nThe first part's result can be -1 or a positive integer. We need to convert that to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: result\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: x_str\n\nwrite(x_str, '(I0)') result\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is properly formatted. Also, negative numbers (like -1) will be written with a minus sign, so the string will be \"-1\".\n\nThen, the second part processes this string.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, gcd, lcm, result, count, current_top, k, pos_s, pos_t\n\n    character(len=200) :: s, t, x_str\n\n    character(len=2000) :: stack  ! assuming stack won't need more than 2000 elements\n\n    logical :: valid\n\n    !

Compute GCD\n\n    gcd = gcd(n, m)\n\n    valid = .true.\n\n    do k = 0, gcd-1\n\n        pos_s = (k * n) / gcd\n\n        pos_t = (k * m) / gcd\n\n        if (s(pos_s+1:pos_s+1) /= t(pos_t+1:pos_t+1)) then\n\n            valid = .false.\n\n            exit\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    if (valid) then\n\n        lcm = (n * m) / gcd\n\n        result = lcm\n\n    else\n\n        result = -1\n\n    end if\n\n    !

Because in Fortran, the GCD intrinsic may not be available in all compilers, so better to implement it ourselves.\n\nWait, the code above defines a GCD function using the Euclidean algorithm. Let me check:\n\nThe function gcd(a,b):\n\nInitialize gcd = a, then if b is not zero, loop:\n\ntemp = mod(gcd, b)\n\nif temp is zero, exit, so the gcd is b.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is a bit off. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard Euclidean algorithm is:\n\nfunction gcd(a, b)\n\n    while b \u2260 0\n\n        t = b\n\n        b = a mod b\n\n        a = t\n\n    gcd = a\n\nend function\n\nSo in the code above, perhaps the function is not correctly implemented. Let me correct it.\n\nLet me rewrite the GCD function properly.\n\nThe function should take a and b as inputs and return their GCD.\n\nHere's a corrected version:\n\ninteger function gcd(a, b)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n\n    integer :: temp, x, y\n\n    x = a\n\n    y = b\n\n    do while (y /=0)\n\n        temp = mod(x, y)\n\n        x = y\n\n        y = temp\n\n    end do\n\n    gcd = x\n\nend function gcd\n\nYes, that's better. So in the code, the GCD function is implemented correctly.\n\nNow, in the main program, the variables:\n\nThe strings s and t are read as character variables. The len=200 is arbitrary, but should be sufficient. Alternatively, use a larger length.\n\nThe stack is declared as a character(len=2000) array. The current_top is an integer that tracks the top of the stack. The stack is stored as a string, with each character being the elements. So stack(1:current_top) holds the stack elements.\n\nWait, in the code above, the stack is declared as a character(len=2000), so each element is a single character. The current_top is the number of elements in the stack. So when pushing, we set stack(current_top+1) = c, but in Fortran, strings are stored as arrays, so perhaps better to use an array of characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an array of characters is better. Let me adjust:\n\nInstead of a character(len=2000) stack, use a character array:\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(0:2000) :: stack\n\nThen current_top starts at 0. When pushing, current_top increments and stack(current_top) = c.\n\nWait, perhaps that's better. Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nLet me rework the stack part:\n\nIn the main program:\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(0:2000) :: stack  ! indexes 0 to 2000, but current_top starts at 0.\n\n    current_top =0\n\n    count =0\n\n    do i =1, len_trim(x_str)\n\n        character(len=1) :: c = x_str(i:i)\n\n        current_top = current_top +1\n\n        stack(current_top) = c\n\n        do while (current_top >=2)\n\n            character(len=1) :: p = stack(current_top)\n\n            character(len=1) :: q = stack(current_top-1)\n\n            if ( (p == '1' .and. q == '0') .or. (p == '0' .and. q == '1') ) then\n\n                count = count +1\n\n                current_top = current_top -2\n\n            else\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n    end do\n\nThis way, the stack is an array with indices from 0 to 2000. The current_top starts at 0. When pushing, current_top increments to 1, then 2, etc. The top element is at current_top.\n\nThis should work better.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nThe stack array needs to be large enough. The maximum possible length of the input string x_str is the length of the first program's output. The first program's output can be up to LCM(n,m). For n and m up to, say, 1e9, LCM could be up to 1e18, which is 18 digits. So the string x_str is up to 20 characters (including the minus sign for -1). So the stack won't need more than 20 elements. So the array size of 2000 is more than enough.\n\nNow, the code for the first part's string comparison:\n\nIn the loop over k from 0 to gcd-1:\n\npos_s = (k *n)/gcd \u2192 since n and gcd are integers, this is integer division.\n\nThen, s's character is s(pos_s +1:pos_s+1). Because in Fortran, the first character is at position 1.\n\nWait, but s is a character variable. So s is a string, and s(1:1) is the first character. So yes, the code is correct.\n\nBut need to ensure that the strings s and t are long enough. For example, when k*n/gcd is up to (gcd-1)*n/gcd + ... but since the GCD divides both n and m, the positions are valid. Because for each k, (k*n)/gcd must be less than n, since k < gcd. Because n = gcd * (n/gcd), so (k*n)/gcd = k*(n/gcd). Since k < gcd, so k*(n/gcd) < gcd*(n/gcd) = n. So the position is within the string s's length. Similarly for t.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: n=2, m=2, s=\"00\", t=\"00\".\n\nGCD is 2. Check k=0 and 1.\n\nFor k=0: pos_s =0 \u2192 s(1) is '0'; pos_t=0 \u2192 t(1) is '0' \u2192 same.\n\nk=1: pos_s = (1*2)/2 =1 \u2192 s(2) is '0'; pos_t= (1*2)/2=1 \u2192 t(2) is '0' \u2192 same. So valid. LCM is (2*2)/2 =2. So first program outputs 2. The second program processes \"2\" \u2192 the string is \"2\". The stack is [ '2' ], so no pairs. count remains 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs -1. For example, n=2, m=2, s=\"00\", t=\"01\".\n\nThen, for k=1, s's position is 2 (s(2) is '0'), t's position is 2 (t(2) is '1'). So they differ \u2192 output is -1. The second program processes \"-1\" \u2192 the string is \"-1\".\n\nProcessing \"-1\":\n\nCharacters are '-', '1'.\n\nPush '-', stack is ['-', top=1.\n\nThen push '1', stack is ['-', '1'], top=2.\n\nCheck the top two: '1' and '-'. They are not 0 and 1 \u2192 so no count. So count remains 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case where the second part's count is non-zero:\n\nSuppose first program outputs \"10\". The string is \"10\".\n\nProcessing \"10\":\n\nFirst character '1' \u2192 stack [1], top=1.\n\nSecond character '0' \u2192 push to stack \u2192 [1,0], top=2.\n\nCheck the top two: '0' and '1' (since p is '0', q is '1'). So they form a pair \u2192 count +=1. current_top becomes 0. So after processing, count is 1 \u2192 output 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: first program outputs \"01\".\n\nProcessing \"01\":\n\nAfter pushing '0', then '1', the stack has [0,1]. The top two are '1' and '0' \u2192 pair \u2192 count becomes 1. So output 2.\n\nAnother example: \"1010\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nCharacters: '1', '0', '1', '0'.\n\nAfter first '1' \u2192 stack [1].\n\nSecond '0' \u2192 stack [1,0]. They form a pair \u2192 count=1, stack becomes empty (top=0).\n\nThird '1' \u2192 stack [1].\n\nFourth '0' \u2192 stack [1,0]. Pair \u2192 count=2, stack empty. So total count 2 \u2192 output 4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The GCD function must correctly compute GCD of n and m. The code now has the correct Euclidean algorithm.\n\n- The string indices in the first part must be correctly adjusted for 1-based.\n\n- The stack processing must correctly handle the order of popping and pushing.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the first program's result is negative (e.g., -1), the string is \"-1\", which has two characters. The stack processing will process '-' and '1', which do not form a pair, so count remains 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code should be as follows."
