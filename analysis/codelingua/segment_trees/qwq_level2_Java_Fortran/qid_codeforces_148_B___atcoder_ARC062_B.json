Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they interact.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_148_B) reads several integers from input: VP, VD, T, F, C. It checks if VD is less than or equal to VP, in which case it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates some value in a loop and outputs the answer. The second Java file (atcoder_ARC062_B) reads a string S and calculates a score based on comparing each character with 'g' or 'p' alternately. The final output is the score.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, the first part must process the initial input, compute the answer from the first Java program, then pass that result as the input to the second part, which computes the score based on that result as the string S. Wait, but how exactly do the outputs and inputs connect here?\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's output: it prints the 'answer' variable, which is an integer. The second Java program expects a string S as input. So the output of the first program (the integer answer) must be converted into a string and passed as the input S to the second program. So in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's answer, we need to convert that integer to a string, then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read the initial input (VP, VD, T, F, C) from the user.\n2. Compute the answer from the first Java's logic.\n3. Convert that answer to a string S.\n4. Use that string S to compute the score as per the second Java's logic.\n5. Output the final score.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (codeforces_148_B):\n\nThe variables are all integers except VP, VD, T, F, C? Wait, in the Java code, they are read as integers but stored as doubles. Wait, in the Java code, the Scanner reads nextInt() for all of them, so they are integers. But stored as doubles. Hmm, but in Fortran, perhaps we can use real variables for VP, VD, etc., but since they are read as integers, maybe using integers is better. Wait, but in the calculations, they are used in divisions, so maybe real variables are better. Let me check the code.\n\nThe first Java code's variables:\n\nVP, VD, T, F, C are all read as integers (nextInt()), but stored as doubles. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read them as integers first, then convert to real variables. Let's see:\n\nIn the first part's code:\n\nThe loop condition is while true, and inside, x is calculated as start * VP/(VD - VP). Since VP and VD are doubles, the division is real.\n\nSo in Fortran, variables VP, VD, T, F, C can be read as integers, then converted to real variables. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, variables can be declared as real. So perhaps:\n\nRead the inputs as integers, then assign to real variables. Or maybe just read them as real. Wait, the input is given as integers, so in Fortran, we can read them as integers first, then convert to real.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the variables are stored as doubles, but the input is integers. So in Fortran, perhaps using real variables for VP, VD, etc. is okay.\n\nNow, the first part's algorithm:\n\nIf VD <= VP, output 0. Else, compute the answer in a loop.\n\nThe loop:\n\nInitialize start = T (which is an integer, but stored as a double in Java). So in Fortran, start is a real variable initialized to T (the integer input).\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nx = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n\nCheck if (start + x)*VP >= C. If yes, break. Else, start += 2*x + F, and increment answer.\n\nWait, but F is an integer (from input). So in Fortran, F is an integer variable, so when adding to start (real), it's okay.\n\nThe loop continues until (start + x)*VP >= C. The answer is the number of times the loop runs (the 'answer' variable starts at 0 and increments each iteration).\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran would be:\n\nRead the inputs (VP, VD, T, F, C) as integers, then convert to real variables (except F and T? Wait, T is part of the initial start. Let me see:\n\nWait, in Java, T is read as an integer and stored as a double. So in Fortran, perhaps all variables except the answer (which is an integer) can be real.\n\nSo variables:\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T_real, F_real, C_real\n\nWait, but F is added as an integer. Wait, in the Java code, F is an integer, so in Fortran, F can be an integer variable. So perhaps:\n\ninteger :: VP_int, VD_int, T_int, F, C_int\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T, C\n\nThen, after reading the inputs as integers, assign to real variables:\n\nVP = real(VP_int)\n\nVD = real(VD_int)\n\nT = real(T_int)\n\nC = real(C_int)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the variables are stored as doubles, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read them directly as real variables. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, when reading from input, if the input is integer, you can read into a real variable. So perhaps:\n\nread(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\nBut then, the input is given as integers, so that's okay. Wait, but in the Java code, the variables are read as integers, so in Fortran, perhaps the variables can be real, and the input is read as real. So that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the variables are stored as doubles, so in Fortran, using real variables is correct.\n\nSo the first part's code steps:\n\nRead the five integers into real variables (except F, which is an integer? Wait, F is added as an integer in the loop. Wait, in the Java code, F is an integer, so in Fortran, F can be an integer variable. So:\n\nvariables:\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T, C\n\ninteger :: F, answer\n\nThen, read the inputs as:\n\nread(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\nWait, but the input is given as integers, so when reading into real variables, that's okay. For example, if the input is 5, then 5.0 is stored in the real variable.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the variables are stored as doubles, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the first part's code:\n\nif (VD <= VP) then\n\n   answer = 0\n\nelse\n\n   start = T\n\n   answer = 0\n\n   do while (true)\n\n      x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n\n      if ( (start + x)*VP >= C ) exit\n\n      start = start + 2*x + F\n\n      answer = answer + 1\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is a while(true) loop, and breaks when the condition is met. So in Fortran, the loop can be a do loop with an exit when the condition is met.\n\nWait, the loop in Java:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   compute x\n\n   if ( (start +x)*VP >= C ) break;\n\n   else: update start and increment answer.\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nstart = T\n\nanswer = 0\n\nloop: do\n\n   x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n\n   if ( (start + x)*VP >= C ) exit loop\n\n   start = start + 2*x + F\n\n   answer = answer +1\n\nend do loop\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part (atcoder_ARC062_B):\n\nThe second Java program reads a string S, then for each character in S, compares it with 'g' or 'p' alternately (starting with 'g' for index 0, then 'p' for 1, etc.). The score is computed as follows: if the current character (my) is different from the character in S, then add 1 if my is 'p', subtract 1 if my is 'g'.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < S.length(); i++) {\n\n   char my = (i%2 ==0) ? 'g' : 'p';\n\n   char his = S.charAt(i);\n\n   if (my != his) {\n\n      score += (my == 'p') ? 1 : -1;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo for each position i:\n\nif i is even (0-based), my is 'g'; else 'p'.\n\nIf my != his, then:\n\nif my is 'p', add 1 to score.\n\nif my is 'g', subtract 1 from score.\n\nWait, because when my is 'g' (i even), and it's different from his, then the contribution is -1. When my is 'p' (i odd), and different, add 1.\n\nSo the total score is the sum over all characters of:\n\nif my != his:\n\n   if my is 'p', +1\n\n   else (my is 'g'), -1\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part needs to take the string S (which is the output of the first part, which is the integer answer from the first program), convert that integer to a string, then process each character.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the integer 'answer', which is the value printed. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\".\n\nWait, but in the Java code for the second program, the input is read via in.next(), which reads the next token. So if the first program's output is \"5\", then the second program reads that as the string \"5\".\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the InputReader's next() method reads the next token, which in this case would be the entire output of the first program (since it's a single integer). So the string S is the string representation of the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the answer (integer) from the first part, we need to convert that integer to a string, then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing the answer (integer variable), we can convert it to a string. Then, process each character in that string.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read, or using internal files. For example:\n\ninteger :: answer\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\nwrite(S, '(I0)') answer\n\nThen, S will contain the string representation of answer. But we need to make sure that the length is sufficient. Alternatively, use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable with enough length, then write the integer into it.\n\nOnce S is the string, then process each character.\n\nNow, the second part's algorithm:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over each character in S (from index 1 to len_trim(S)), since Fortran strings are 1-based.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are 1-based, so for a string S of length N, the characters are S(1), S(2), ..., S(N).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the string is 0-based. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to len_trim(S):\n\nmy_char is 'g' if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 (since in Java, index 0 is first character, so in Fortran's 1-based, i-1 is the 0-based index).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to length-1:\n\nmy is 'g' if i even, else 'p'.\n\nIn Fortran, for the same position (i in 1-based):\n\nthe 0-based index is (i-1). So:\n\nif (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even \u2192 my is 'g'\n\nelse \u2192 my is 'p'\n\nSo for each character in S (from 1 to len_trim(S)):\n\nmy = 'g' if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 i mod 2 ==1 (since (i-1) mod 2 is 0 when i is odd (since i-1 even))\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ni=1 \u2192 (i-1)=0 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 my is 'g'\n\ni=2 \u2192 (i-1)=1 \u2192 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 my is 'p'\n\ni=3 \u2192 (i-1)=2 \u2192 mod 2 0 \u2192 my 'g'\n\nYes, so the condition is:\n\nif mod(i-1,2) ==0 \u2192 my is 'g'\n\nelse \u2192 'p'\n\nSo for each character in S:\n\nhis_char = S(i)\n\nmy_char = 'g' if (i-1) mod 2 ==0 else 'p'\n\nif my_char /= his_char then:\n\n   if my_char == 'p' then score = score +1\n\n   else (my_char is 'g') \u2192 score = score -1\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ninteger :: score =0\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(S)\n\n   my_char = 'g'\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==1) then \u2192 no, wait:\n\nWait, the condition is (i-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 my is 'g'\n\nElse \u2192 'p'\n\nSo:\n\nif (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n   my_char = 'g'\n\nelse\n\n   my_char = 'p'\n\nend if\n\nThen, if my_char /= his_char (S(i)), then:\n\nif (my_char == 'p') then\n\n   score = score +1\n\nelse\n\n   score = score -1\n\nend if\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into Fortran:\n\nThe entire program will:\n\n1. Read the five integers (VP, VD, T, F, C) from input.\n\n2. Compute the answer from the first part's algorithm.\n\n3. Convert the answer to a string S.\n\n4. Compute the score based on S.\n\n5. Output the score.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T, C\n\ninteger :: F, answer\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\ninteger :: score, i\n\nThen, read the inputs:\n\nread(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\nThen compute the first part's answer:\n\nif (VD <= VP) then\n\n   answer =0\n\nelse\n\n   start = T\n\n   answer =0\n\n   loop: do\n\n      x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n\n      if ( (start + x)*VP >= C ) exit loop\n\n      start = start + 2*x + F\n\n      answer = answer +1\n\n   end do loop\n\nend if\n\nThen, convert answer to string S:\n\nwrite(S, '(I0)') answer\n\nThen, process S to compute the score:\n\nscore =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(S)\n\n   if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n      my_char = 'g'\n\n   else\n\n      my_char = 'p'\n\n   end if\n\n   his_char = S(i:i)\n\n   if (my_char /= his_char) then\n\n      if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n         score = score +1\n\n      else\n\n         score = score -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nFinally, output the score:\n\nprint*, score\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing the string S, the write statement may have leading spaces. To avoid that, using '(I0)' should write the integer without leading spaces. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the format '(I0)' writes the integer in the shortest possible format, so no leading spaces. So the S string will be exactly the digits of the answer.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The loop in the first part must terminate. The Java code's loop breaks when (start +x)*VP >= C. The Fortran code's loop does the same.\n\n- The variables in the first part must be real where necessary. For example, start is a real variable initialized to T (which is a real variable). The calculation of x is correct.\n\n- The conversion of answer to a string must be correct. The write statement into S should work.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So the code structure would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  real :: VP, VD, T, C, start, x\n\n  integer :: F, answer, score, i\n\n  character(len=20) :: S\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read(*,*) VP, VD, T, F, C\n\n  ! Compute first part's answer\n\n  if (VD <= VP) then\n\n     answer =0\n\n  else\n\n     start = T\n\n     answer =0\n\n     loop: do\n\n        x = start * VP / (VD - VP)\n\n        if ( (start + x)*VP >= C ) exit loop\n\n        start = start + 2*x + F\n\n        answer = answer +1\n\n     end do loop\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Convert answer to string S\n\n  write(S, '(I0)') answer\n\n  ! Compute the score\n\n  score =0\n\n  do i=1, len_trim(S)\n\n     if (mod(i-1,2) ==0) then\n\n        my_char = 'g'\n\n     else\n\n        my_char = 'p'\n\n     end if\n\n     his_char = S(i:i)\n\n     if (my_char /= his_char) then\n\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n           score = score +1\n\n        else\n\n           score = score -1\n\n        end if\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the score\n\n  print*, score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, 'my_char' and 'his_char' are not declared. Oh right, I need to declare them as character variables.\n\nAdding declarations:\n\ncharacter :: my_char, his_char\n\nSo the variables section:\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T, C, start, x\n\ninteger :: F, answer, score, i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\ncharacter :: my_char, his_char\n\nNow, that's better.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop, variables start and x are real. They need to be declared. So in the variables section, add start and x as real variables.\n\nWait, in the code above, I have:\n\nreal :: VP, VD, T, C, start, x\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: VD <= VP \u2192 answer is 0. Then S is \"0\". The second part processes \"0\".\n\nProcessing \"0\":\n\nLength is 1. i=1:\n\ni-1 is 0 \u2192 mod(0,2)=0 \u2192 my_char is 'g'\n\nhis_char is '0'\n\nCompare 'g' vs '0' \u2192 different.\n\nSince my_char is 'g', subtract 1 \u2192 score becomes -1?\n\nWait, but in the Java code for the second part, when my is 'g' and his is different, the score is subtracted by 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif (my != his) \u2192 then:\n\n   score += (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1)\n\nSo when my is 'g', it's -1 added.\n\nSo in the example where S is \"0\", the first character is '0', which is different from 'g', so the contribution is -1. So the total score is -1.\n\nBut according to the code above, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program outputs 123 \u2192 S is \"123\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\ni=1 (char '1'):\n\nmy is 'g' (since i-1=0 even). his is '1' \u2192 different. So subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\ni=2 (char '2'):\n\nmy is 'p' (i-1=1 is odd). his is '2' \u2192 different. Add 1 \u2192 total 0.\n\ni=3 (char '3'):\n\nmy is 'g' (i-1=2 even). his is '3' \u2192 different. Subtract 1 \u2192 total -1.\n\nSo total score is -1.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should test with a sample input.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 5 \u2192 S is \"5\".\n\nThen, the second part's processing:\n\ni=1: my is 'g', his is '5' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\nSo the final output is -1.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is 0 \u2192 S is \"0\", so the second part's score is -1.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, when VD <= VP, it outputs 0, so the second program's input is \"0\", leading to a score of -1. But according to the second Java program's code, when the input is \"0\", the code would process each character (only one here):\n\ni=0 (Java's 0-based):\n\nmy is 'g', his is '0' \u2192 different \u2192 add -1 (since my is 'g') \u2192 total -1.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is 12 \u2192 S is \"12\".\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1 (char '1') \u2192 my 'g', different \u2192 -1.\n\ni=2 (char '2') \u2192 my 'p', different \u2192 +1 \u2192 total 0.\n\nSo the final score is 0.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part's loop, the variables start and x are real, and the loop may have precision issues, but that's the same as the original Java code.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's loop, the initial start is T (the input T). Since T is read as a real variable, that's okay.\n\nYes, I think this should work."
