    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they interact.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_299_A) reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It sorts the array, checks if all elements are divisible by the minimum (a[0]), and if so, outputs the minimum; else, -1.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but the second file also has a class RemRing, but in the main method, it's not used. Wait, looking at the code for the second file's main: it just reads a line, takes the first character, adds 1, and prints it. The RemRing class is part of the code but not used here. So maybe that's part of another problem but included here by mistake? The user provided two Java files, but the second one's main is the atcoder problem. The RemRing class is probably from another problem but included in the same file. Since the user says the programs are to be executed in sequence, the second program's main is the one that's part of the chain. So the RemRing class is not part of the processing here. So I can ignore that class when translating.\n\nSo the sequence is: first program's output is input to the second. But the first program's output is either -1 or the minimum value. The second program expects a string input (since it reads a line and takes the first character). Wait, that's a problem. Because the first program outputs a number (either -1 or min), but the second program expects a string. Wait, but in the original setup, the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (a number) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that number as a string? For example, if the first outputs \"5\", then the second reads \"5\" as the input string, takes the first character (which is '5'), adds 1 to its ASCII value (so '5' is 53, adding 1 gives 54 which is '6'), so output '6'. If the first outputs \"-1\", then the second would take the first character '-', add 1 to get '.' (ASCII 45 +1=46), so output '.'.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo the input to the second program is whatever the first program outputs. The first program outputs either -1 or the minimum. So the first's output is a number, which when written to the second's input, is a string like \"-1\" or \"5\". The second program takes the first character of that string, adds 1 to its ASCII code, and outputs that character.\n\nSo the overall sequence is:\n\nInput to first program: n followed by n integers.\n\nFirst program's output is either -1 or the minimum element (as a number).\n\nSecond program takes that output as its input (as a string), takes first character, adds 1, outputs that character.\n\nSo the combined Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process it as per first program, then process the result through the second program's logic, and output the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (n and array a) from stdin.\n\n2. Process the first part (sort array, check divisibility by min, get min or -1).\n\n3. Then take that result (either -1 or min value) and process it through the second program's logic: convert the number to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII code, output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and array a.\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Find the minimum (a(1) after sorting).\n\n- Check if all elements are divisible by min_val. If any isn't, set result to -1. Else, result is min_val.\n\n- Then, convert the result (either -1 or min_val) to a string. Take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done via write statements into a character variable.\n\nFor example, to convert the result (integer) to a string:\n\ninteger :: result\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_result\nwrite(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\nThen, take the first character of str_result, which is the first character of the string representation of the result.\n\nThen, get the ASCII code of that character, add 1, then output the resulting character.\n\nBut in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nAfter computing the result (either -1 or min_val):\n\nstr_result = write to string.\n\nfirst_char = str_result(1:1)\n\nascii_val = ichar(first_char)\n\nnew_ascii = ascii_val + 1\n\nnew_char = char(new_ascii)\n\nprint *, new_char\n\nBut need to handle the case where the string is \"-1\", so first character is '-', which is ASCII 45. Adding 1 gives 46, which is '.'.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing -1 as an integer, the string would be \"-1\", so first character is '-'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read n and array a.\n\nThen process the first part:\n\nSort the array. In Fortran, sorting can be done with the Mergesort or using the built-in sort function. Since the array is of integers, we can use the intrinsic function.\n\nWait, Fortran has the 'sort' intrinsic in Fortran 90 and later. So:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nBut need to make sure the array is sorted in ascending order. The default for sort is ascending, so that's okay.\n\nThen find the minimum (a(1) after sorting).\n\nThen check each element in a to see if mod(a(i), min_val) ==0.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, after sorting, the min is a[0], then loop through all elements and check if any is not divisible by min. If any, output -1, else min.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmin_val = a(1)\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n\n      result = -1\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (result == -1) then\n\n   ... else result is min_val.\n\nWait, but need to initialize result. Let's structure it:\n\nresult = min_val\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n\n      result = -1\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo after that, result is either -1 or min_val.\n\nThen, proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, converting the result to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to write an integer to a string, we can use an internal write statement.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_result\n\nwrite(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\nThen, take the first character:\n\nfirst_char = str_result(1:1)\n\nBut need to check if the string is empty? Probably not here, since result is either -1 or a positive integer (since min_val is the minimum of the array, which is at least 1 if all elements are positive? Wait, the problem's first Java code allows the array elements to be any integers? Wait, the problem's first code is from codeforces 299A, which is probably about divisors. Let me check the problem's constraints. Well, the code uses nextInt(), so the input can be any integers, but the code checks if all elements are divisible by the minimum. So the minimum could be negative? Wait, but if the array has negative numbers, then the minimum would be the most negative, and then when checking divisibility, for example, if the array is [ -2, 4, 6], the minimum is -2. 4 mod -2 is 0, 6 mod -2 is 0, so it would output -2. But in that case, the second program would take the string \"-2\", first character '-', add 1 to get '.'.\n\nBut the code in the first Java program would work with negative numbers. So in Fortran, the code must handle that.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, the string conversion is straightforward.\n\nOnce we have first_char, compute its ASCII code, add 1, then output as a character.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, result, min_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_result\n\ncharacter :: first_char\n\ninteger :: ascii_val, new_ascii\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread*, a\n\n! Process first part\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nmin_val = a(1)\n\nresult = min_val\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n\n      result = -1\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now process second part\n\nwrite(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\nfirst_char = str_result(1:1)\n\nascii_val = ichar(first_char)\n\nnew_ascii = ascii_val + 1\n\nprint*, char(new_ascii)\n\ndeallocate(a)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort function is part of the intrinsic. Wait, in Fortran 90 and later, the sort is in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or is it part of the standard?\n\nWait, actually, the sort function is part of the intrinsic functions in Fortran 90 and later. Wait, no, the sort is an intrinsic procedure, but you have to use the intrinsic statement. Wait, no, perhaps I need to use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to sort an array, you can use the 'sort' intrinsic. The syntax is:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\nBut the array must be rank-1. So in this case, a is a 1D array, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but I think the sort is part of the intrinsic procedures. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in Fortran 90 and later, the sort function is available as an intrinsic. So the code above should work.\n\nWait, but in some compilers, you might need to include a module, but I think it's standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use the 'merge_sort' or another method, but assuming the compiler supports the intrinsic sort, the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing: when the array is sorted, the first element is the minimum. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput for first program: 3 2 4 6 \u2192 sorted [2,4,6]. All divisible by 2. So result is 2. Then the second program takes \"2\" \u2192 first char '2' (ASCII 50 \u2192 51 \u2192 '3'). So output '3'.\n\nAnother test case: input 3 -2 4 6 \u2192 sorted [-2,4,6]. Check 4 mod -2 is 0 (since 4 = (-2)*-2 \u2192 mod is 0). 6 mod -2 is 0. So result is -2. The string is \"-2\", first char '-', ASCII 45 \u2192 46 \u2192 '.'.\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs -1: input 3 2 4 5. The min is 2. 5 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 so output -1. The second program takes \"-1\" \u2192 first char '-', ASCII 45 \u2192 46 \u2192 '.'.\n\nWait, but the second program's first character of \"-1\" is '-', so same as previous case. So the output would be '.'.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is a single-digit number, like 5 \u2192 the second program outputs '6'.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code above, after the sort, the array is sorted in ascending order, so the first element is the minimum. That's correct.\n\nThe loop checks all elements. If any is not divisible by min_val, set result to -1 and exit.\n\nThen, the string conversion is done via write(str_result, '(I0)') result. The '(I0)' format writes the integer in default format, which for negative numbers includes the '-'.\n\nThen, first_char is the first character of that string.\n\nThen, the rest is straightforward.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The array allocation: since n is read first, then allocate(a(n)), then read the array. That's correct.\n\n- The sort is called on the allocated array. Yes.\n\n- The loop over all elements. Correct.\n\n- The string conversion. Yes.\n\nEdge case when result is -1: the string is \"-1\", first character is '-', so correct.\n\nAnother edge case: result is 0? Wait, but in the first program, the array's elements must all be divisible by the minimum. If the minimum is 0, then all elements must be 0. But in that case, mod(0,0) is undefined in mathematics, but in Java, what does it do?\n\nWait, in the first Java code, if the array has a 0 as the minimum, then the code would check if each element is divisible by 0. But division by zero would throw an exception. Wait, but in the code, the first element is the minimum. If the array contains 0, then the minimum is 0, but then when checking a[i] % min, which is a[i] mod 0, which is division by zero. So the code would crash. But the problem's original code must have constraints that prevent this. So perhaps the problem's input ensures that the minimum is non-zero. But the code as given would crash in that case. However, the user's code is given, so we have to translate it as is. So in Fortran, mod(a(i), min_val) when min_val is zero would also be an error. But since the original code would have the same problem, the Fortran code will too. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps the input ensures that the minimum is non-zero. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the result is a number with leading spaces? No, because the write uses '(I0)', which writes the number without leading spaces.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the default for the print statement is to add a new line. The second Java program uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) which outputs the character without a newline. Wait, the Java code's second program's print statement is System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which would print the character followed by a new line? Or not? The printf with %c would just print the character, and the format string doesn't have a newline. So the output is just the character. The Fortran code uses print*, which adds a space and a new line. Wait, but in Fortran, print*, char(new_ascii) would print the character followed by a space and a new line? Or just the character?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the * in print* means to use list-directed output. So for a character, it would just print the character, then a new line. But the Java code's second program's output is exactly the character, without any new line? Let me check the Java code:\n\nThe second Java program's code has:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nThe printf with %c will output the character, and since there's no \\n, it won't add a new line. But in Java, System.out.println adds a new line, but printf does not unless specified. So the output is just the single character, no new line. However, in Fortran, the print*, will add a new line. So this might be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, but the problem says the Fortran program should behave identically. So the output must be exactly the same as the original sequence.\n\nThe first Java program outputs either -1 or the min, followed by a new line (since System.out.println is used). Then the second Java program outputs the character without a new line. Wait, no:\n\nWait first program's code ends with System.out.println(min); which adds a new line. The second program's code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) which outputs the character and no new line. So the total output of the two programs would be:\n\nFirst program's output (number followed by new line), then second program's output (character with no new line). But when they are connected via pipes, the second program's input is the first's output (the number plus new line). But the second program reads the entire line (using readLine()), so the new line is part of the input. Wait, in the second Java program's code, the first line is s = r.readLine(); which reads the entire line from input, including the new line? No, readLine() reads up to the newline and returns the string without the newline. So the first program's output is, for example, \"5\\n\", then the second program reads \"5\" as the line. So the second program's output is the character followed by nothing. But in the Fortran code, the first part's output is the number (as part of the internal processing), so the Fortran program's final output is the character followed by a new line (from print*). That would differ from the original sequence's output, which would have the first program's output (number + new line), then the second's output (character with no new line). So the total output would be:\n\nnumber\\ncharacter\n\nBut the Fortran program would output the character followed by a new line, making it:\n\ncharacter\\n\n\nWhich is different.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the Fortran code's output must exactly match the sequence's output.\n\nWait, the original sequence's first program outputs a number followed by a new line. The second program reads that line (the number), processes it, and outputs the character without a new line. So the total output is:\n\nnumber\\ncharacter\n\nBut the Fortran program, when combining both steps, must output the same: the character followed by a new line? Or not?\n\nWait, the Fortran program must not do any I/O except first read and last output. So the first part's output is internal, and the second part's output is the final output. So the Fortran program's final print statement must output exactly the same as the second Java program's output. The second Java program's output is the character with no new line. So in Fortran, to avoid adding a new line, we can use write(*, '(A)') char(new_ascii) instead of print*.\n\nBecause print* adds a new line, but write with format A will just write the character without a new line. Wait, no, the format in write(*, '(A)') would write the character and then a new line? Or not?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the format '(A)' will write the character as a string, and the default is to advance to the next line. To prevent that, you can use advance='no'.\n\nWait, the syntax is:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') char(new_ascii)\n\nThen, to ensure no new line.\n\nAlternatively, the original second Java program's output does not have a new line. So the Fortran code must also not output a new line after the character.\n\nSo the correct way is to use write with advance='no'.\n\nSo modifying the print statement:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') char(new_ascii)\n\nBut then, the program might end without a new line, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, in the original sequence, the first program's output ends with a new line, and the second program's output is the character without a new line, so the total is:\n\nnumber\\ncharacter\n\nThe Fortran program must output exactly that. Since the first part's output is internal, the Fortran program's final output is the character, but without a new line. So the write statement with advance='no' is needed.\n\nTherefore, the code should use:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') char(new_ascii)\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows trailing newlines, but the user requires exact behavior, then this is necessary.\n\nSo adjusting the code:\n\nReplace the print* line with:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') char(new_ascii)\n\nBut also, in the first part, the first program's output is not printed, so the Fortran code doesn't output anything until the end.\n\nThus, the final code would be:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, result, min_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_result\n\ncharacter :: first_char\n\ninteger :: ascii_val, new_ascii\n\n! Read input\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread*, a\n\n! Process first part\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nmin_val = a(1)\n\nresult = min_val\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (mod(a(i), min_val) /= 0) then\n\n      result = -1\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now process second part\n\nwrite(str_result, '(I0)') result\n\nfirst_char = str_result(1:1)\n\nascii_val = ichar(first_char)\n\nnew_ascii = ascii_val + 1\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') char(new_ascii)\n\ndeallocate(a)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you use write with advance='no', the next write will continue on the same line. But since this is the last output, it's okay.\n\nTesting this code with the first example where the result is 2:\n\nThe string is \"2\", first_char is '2', new_ascii is 51 \u2192 '3', written without a new line. So the output is '3' with no new line, which matches the second Java program's output.\n\nAnother test case where the first program outputs -1: the string is \"-1\", first_char '-', new_ascii 46 \u2192 '.', written without new line. So the output is '.'.\n\nThus, this should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the result is a number with leading spaces? For example, if the result is 123, the string is \"123\", so first_char is '1'. But the write statement with '(I0)' should not add leading spaces. The '(I0)' format writes the integer in the shortest possible format, so no leading spaces.\n\nYes, so that's okay.\n\nAnother case: result is 0. Suppose the array has all zeros. Then the first program would have min_val 0, and then mod(a(i),0) would be division by zero. But the original Java code would crash here. The Fortran code would also crash with a division by zero error. Since the problem's original code has that behavior, the Fortran code is correct in replicating it.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
