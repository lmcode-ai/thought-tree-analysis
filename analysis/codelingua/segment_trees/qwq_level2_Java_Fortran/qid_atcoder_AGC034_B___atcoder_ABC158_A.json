    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (AGC034_B) reads a string, replaces all \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the number of \"A\" followed by \"D\" in some way. Wait, let me look at the code again. The solve method in BABC:\n\nIt takes the input string, replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". Then loops through each character. For each character:\n- If it's 'A', increment tmp (which tracks the number of A's so far)\n- If it's 'D', then add the current tmp to cnt. So every D encountered adds the number of A's before it to the total count. \n- Else (any other character), reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the count is the number of \"A\" followed by \"D\" pairs, but considering overlapping? Or more precisely, for each D, the number of A's before it in the string up to that point, but only if the path from A to D doesn't have a non-A/D character in between. Because whenever a non-A or D is found, tmp resets. So the logic is that whenever you see a D, it contributes all the A's since the last reset. So the total is the sum over all D's of the number of A's since the last non-A/D character.\n\nThen the second Java program (ABC158_A) takes the output of the first, which is a number, and checks if the string (the number as a string?) contains both 'A' and 'B'. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is a number, which is written as a string. The second program's input is that number's string representation. But the second program checks if the input string contains both 'A' and 'B'. But if the first program outputs a number like \"123\", then the second program would output \"No\" because there's no A or B. Hmm, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the flow here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is the count (a number), so the second program's input is that number as a string. So the second program checks if that number's string contains both 'A' and 'B', which would only be possible if the number is written with letters, but numbers in Java are printed as digits. So unless the count is, say, 0xAB (but in Java, that would be printed as 171, not with letters). Wait, no. The first program's output is a number printed as a decimal string. So the second program's input is that number's string, like \"42\". Then the second program checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B', which it never would. That seems odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the second Java program's code again. The second program's solve method takes the input as a string (from in.next()), and checks if it contains 'A' and 'B'. So the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number. So the input to the second program is a string that's the number's decimal representation. So unless the first program's output is a string that includes letters, which it isn't. The first program's output is a number, so the second program will always output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB123\", but that's impossible here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's processing.\n\nWait the first program's input is a string S. Let me re-express the first program's steps:\n\nOriginal string S is read. Then, replace all \"BC\" with \"D\". So for example, if the input is \"ABCBC\", then after replacement, it becomes \"ADBC\" (since the first BC is replaced by D, but the next BC is then \"BC\" again? Wait, the replaceAll in Java uses regex, so \"BC\" is a literal here. So \"BC\" is replaced by \"D\". So in \"ABCBC\", the first BC becomes D, so the string becomes \"ADBC\", then the next BC is replaced to D, so the final string is \"ADD\".\n\nThen, the processing loop:\n\nInitialize cnt and tmp to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the modified string:\n\n- If the current char is 'A', increment tmp (so tmp counts the number of A's encountered so far in the current run)\n- If it's 'D', then add the current tmp to cnt. So each D contributes the number of A's before it in the current run.\n- Else (any other character, like 'B', 'C', etc.), reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the total cnt is the sum over all D's of the number of A's before each D in their respective runs.\n\nSo for example, if the modified string is \"AAD\", then the first A increments tmp to 1, second A to 2, then D adds 2 to cnt. So total is 2.\n\nAnother example: \"ABD\" would be after replacement (if original had BC?), but let's see. Suppose the original string is \"ABBC\", then replacing BC gives \"ABD\". Then processing:\n\nCharacters: A, B, D.\n\nFirst character A: tmp becomes 1.\n\nSecond is B (not A or D), so tmp resets to 0.\n\nThird is D: since tmp is 0, adds 0 to cnt. So total is 0.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow the second program takes the output of the first, which is the cnt (a number), and checks if the input string (the number as a string) contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since numbers are printed as digits, the second program will always output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB\", but that's impossible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's output. Let me check again.\n\nWait the first program's output is out.println(cnt); so it's the numerical value of cnt, printed as a decimal number. So the second program's input is that number's string. So for example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which doesn't have A or B, so output is \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a string that includes letters? Like, if the replacement in the first program creates a D, but the output is the modified string? No, no. The first program's output is the cnt variable, which is a long. So the output is a number. So the second program's input is that number's string. So the second program will only output \"Yes\" if the number's string contains both 'A' and 'B', which is impossible because numbers are printed as digits. So the second program will always output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB123\", but that can't happen. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nWait the user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is the cnt value, which is a number. So the second program's input is that number as a string. The second program checks if that string contains both 'A' and 'B', which would only be true if the number's string has those letters, which is impossible. So the second program will always output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB\", but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a string, not a number? Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's solve method: out.println(cnt); so yes, it's printing the count as a number. So the second program's input is that number's string. So the second program's logic is to check if that string (the number's string) contains both 'A' and 'B', which would never be true. So the second program's output is always \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB\", but that can't happen. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the first program's output is the modified string, not the count? Let me check again.\n\nNo, the first program's code is:\n\nsolver.solve(1, in, out); and in the solve method, after processing, it does out.println(cnt); so the output is the count. So the second program's input is that count as a string. So the second program's code is:\n\npublic void solve(...) {\n    String s = in.next();\n    if (s contains 'A' and 'B') then yes else no.\n}\n\nSo the second program is checking if the input string (the count's string) has both 'A' and 'B'. Since the count is a number, the input string is all digits, so the answer is always \"No\".\n\nHmm, that's strange. But perhaps the problem is that the first program's output is the modified string, not the count? Let me check again.\n\nWait no, the first program's code is:\n\ns = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nthen processes the string to compute cnt, then prints cnt. So the output is the count. So the second program's input is that count's string. So the second program's output is \"Yes\" only if the count's string has both 'A' and 'B', which is impossible. So the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is the modified string? Let me check again. The code in the first program's solve method:\n\nout.println(cnt); so no, it's the count. So the second program's input is the count's string. So the second program's output is \"No\" unless the count is, say, 0xAB (but in Java, that would be printed as 171, so \"171\", which doesn't have A or B). So the second program's output is always \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of an example. Suppose the first program's input is \"ABCC\". Then the replacement of \"BC\" with \"D\" would give \"AD C\" (since the first BC is replaced by D, but the next C is just a C. So the modified string is \"ADC\".\n\nProcessing the characters:\n\nA: tmp becomes 1.\n\nD: cnt += 1 (so cnt is 1).\n\nC: reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the output is 1. Then the second program's input is \"1\", which doesn't have A or B, so output is \"No\".\n\nAnother example: first input is \"AABCC\". The replacement would be \"AADC\" (since BC becomes D). Then processing:\n\nA: tmp 1.\n\nA: tmp 2.\n\nD: cnt +=2 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nC: reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo output is 2. Second program's input is \"2\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nHmm, so the second program's output is always \"No\" unless the first's output is a string like \"AB\", but that can't happen. So perhaps the second program is supposed to process the modified string from the first program, but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sequence. The user says the output of each program is the input to the next. So first program's output is the count (number), which is the input to the second program. The second program's input is that number's string. So the second program's code is correct as per the given Java code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the original string), process it through the first program's logic to get the count, then process that count's string through the second program's logic, and output the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n2. Process it as per the first Java program (replace BC with D, compute the count).\n\n3. Take that count, convert it to a string, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n4. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first, which is the count. So the second program's input is the count's string. So the Fortran program must do all steps in one go.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input string (from stdin).\n\n- Process it through the first program's logic (replace BC with D, compute the count).\n\n- Convert the count to a string (the output of first program).\n\n- Then process that string through the second program's logic (check for presence of 'A' and 'B').\n\n- Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all these steps without any intermediate I/O except the first read and the final output.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst step: Read the input string.\n\nIn Fortran, reading a string can be done with read(*,*) s, but need to handle possible leading/trailing spaces? The Java code uses in.next(), which reads the next token, so probably the input is a single token. So in Fortran, perhaps read(*, '(A)') s.\n\nSecond step: Replace all occurrences of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nHmm, in Fortran, string manipulation can be tricky. Need to loop through the string and replace each \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nWait, the replacement is done with replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\"), which in Java is a literal replacement, not regex. So every occurrence of the substring \"BC\" is replaced with \"D\".\n\nSo in Fortran, we can process the string as follows:\n\nInitialize a new string, say s_mod.\n\nLoop over each character in the original string, checking for \"BC\" sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to loop through the original string, and whenever we find a 'B' followed by a 'C', replace them with a 'D', and skip the next character.\n\nAlternatively, we can build the modified string step by step.\n\nLet me think of an algorithm:\n\nInitialize s_mod as an empty string.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\n   current_char = s(i:i)\n\n   if current_char is 'B' and the next character (i+1) is 'C', then:\n\n       append 'D' to s_mod\n\n       increment i by 1 (to skip the next character)\n\n   else:\n\n       append current_char to s_mod\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length, but we can use a character array or a dynamically built string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array for s_mod, and track the current position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a loop with a temporary array.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach:\n\nInitialize s_mod as a character array of the same length as s (or longer, but maybe we can compute the maximum possible length? Since each BC reduces the length by 1, but for simplicity, perhaps we can use a temporary array of the same length as s, and then trim it later.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps:\n\nLet the original string be s (length n). The modified string s_mod can be built as follows:\n\nInitialize an array of characters, say s_mod, with length n (since in the worst case, no replacements, so same length).\n\nInitialize a pointer j = 1 (the current position in s_mod).\n\nLoop over i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\n   current_char = s(i:i)\n\n   if current_char is 'B' and i < len_trim(s) and s(i+1:i+1) == 'C':\n\n       s_mod(j:j) = 'D'\n\n       j = j + 1\n\n       i = i + 1  ! skip the next character\n\n   else:\n\n       s_mod(j:j) = current_char\n\n       j = j + 1\n\nSo after this loop, the modified string is s_mod(1:j-1).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are a bit different. Let me think in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character variable with enough length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array and building it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a loop with a temporary string.\n\nAlternatively, here's code outline:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s, s_mod\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\ns_mod = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (i < len_trim(s) .and. s(i:i) == 'B' .and. s(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n\n       s_mod = trim(s_mod) // 'D'\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else\n\n       s_mod = trim(s_mod) // s(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation with // can be done, but the initial s_mod is an empty string. However, in Fortran, when you do trim(s_mod) // 'D', since s_mod is initially empty, trim('') is just an empty string, so appending 'D' would work.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the length of the string is fixed. So perhaps using a character array with a large enough length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of sufficient length, say 1000, and track the current length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following code:\n\ninteger :: i, j, n\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s, s_mod\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nj = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if (i <= n -1 .and. s(i:i) == 'B' .and. s(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n\n       j = j + 1\n\n       s_mod(j:j) = 'D'\n\n       i = i + 1\n\n   else\n\n       j = j + 1\n\n       s_mod(j:j) = s(i:i)\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ns_mod = s_mod(1:j)\n\nThis way, s_mod is the modified string with BC replaced by D.\n\nOkay, that's the first part.\n\nNext, compute the count as per the first Java program's logic.\n\nInitialize cnt and tmp to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in s_mod:\n\n   if the character is 'A', then tmp +=1\n\n   else if it's 'D', then cnt += tmp\n\n   else, tmp = 0\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: cnt, tmp, i, len_s_mod\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s_mod\n\n... (after building s_mod as above)\n\ncnt = 0\n\ntmp = 0\n\nlen_s_mod = len_trim(s_mod)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s_mod\n\n   char = s_mod(i:i)\n\n   if (char == 'A') then\n\n       tmp = tmp + 1\n\n   else if (char == 'D') then\n\n       cnt = cnt + tmp\n\n   else\n\n       tmp = 0\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that's the count.\n\nThen, the second part: take the count, convert it to a string, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nWait, but the count is a number. So converting it to a string in Fortran can be done with write statement.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: count_str\n\nwrite(count_str, '(I0)') cnt\n\ncount_str = adjustl(count_str)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, check if count_str contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nBut since the count is a number, the string will only have digits, so the check will always be false. But according to the problem's Java code, that's what it does.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(count_str)\n\n   char = count_str(i:i)\n\n   if (char == 'A') then\n\n       hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (char == 'B') then\n\n       hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   print *, 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'No'\n\nend if\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen process the string to replace BC with D.\n\nThen compute the count.\n\nThen convert count to string, check for A and B.\n\nNow, handling the string lengths properly.\n\nPossible code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=1000) :: s, s_mod\n    integer :: i, j, n, cnt, tmp, len_s_mod\n    character(len=20) :: count_str\n    logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n    !

Convert cnt to string\n    write(count_str, '(I0)') cnt\n    count_str = adjustl(count_str)\n\n    ! Check for A and B\n    hasA = .false.\n    hasB = .false.\n    do i = 1, len_trim(count_str)\n        select case (count_str(i:i))\n            case ('A')\n                hasA = .true.\n            case ('B')\n                hasB = .true.\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n        print *, 'Yes'\n    else\n        print *, 'No'\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the case where the count is zero, the string would be \"0\", so no A or B. So output is \"No\".\n\nTesting this code with an example:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"ABCC\"\n\nProcessing first step:\n\nOriginal s is \"ABCC\".\n\nLoop over i from 1 to 4 (n=4):\n\ni=1: s(1:1) is 'A', not B, so add to s_mod. j becomes 1, s_mod(1) = 'A'.\n\ni=2: s(2:2) is 'B', check next character (i+1=3 is 'C'). So replace with D. j becomes 2, s_mod(2) = 'D'. Then i increments to 3.\n\nNow i=3 (after increment, i is now 3). The next character is s(3:3) is 'C', but since we already processed i=2, now i=3:\n\nCheck if i <= 3 (since n=4, 3 <= 3-1? 3 <=3? 3 <=3 is true, but s(3:3) is 'C', so not B. So process as default. So add 'C' to s_mod. j becomes 3, s_mod(3) = 'C'.\n\ni increments to 4.\n\ni=4: s(4:4) is 'C', add to s_mod. j becomes 4, s_mod(4) = 'C'.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nWait after i=2, we set i to 3 (since after processing the BC at i=2, we increment i by 1, so i becomes 3).\n\nNow, the loop continues with i=3.\n\nAt i=3, check if i <= n-1 (3 <= 3, since n=4, n-1 is 3. So yes. Check s(3:3) is 'C', so not B. So the condition is false. So process as else: add s(3:3) to s_mod. So s_mod(3) is 'C', j=3.\n\nThen i increments to 4.\n\ni=4: check if i <=3 (since n-1 is 3). 4 is not <=3, so process as else. Add s(4:4) which is 'C' to s_mod. j becomes 4, s_mod(4) = 'C'.\n\nSo s_mod is \"ADC C\" (but the actual s_mod is \"ADC\" followed by another C? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait the original string is \"ABCC\" (length 4). Let's step through:\n\ni starts at 1:\n\ni=1: character is 'A', so added to s_mod. j=1.\n\ni=2: 'B' followed by 'C' (i+1=3 is 'C'). So replace with D. j becomes 2, s_mod(2) = 'D'. i becomes 3.\n\nNow i=3: check if i <=3 (since n=4, n-1 is 3). So yes. s(3:3) is 'C', so not B. So process as else: add 'C' to s_mod. j=3, s_mod(3) = 'C'. i increments to 4.\n\ni=4: now, i is 4. Check if i <=3? No. So process as else: add s(4:4) which is 'C' to s_mod. j becomes 4, s_mod(4) = 'C'.\n\nThus s_mod is \"ADC C\" (but with spaces?), but since we are using len_trim(s_mod) which is j=4, so the s_mod is \"ADCC\".\n\nWait, but the original string was \"ABCC\". The first BC (positions 2-3) is replaced by D, so the first three characters become A D, then the remaining C (position 4) is added. So the modified string should be \"ADCC\".\n\nThen processing the count:\n\nLoop over each character in s_mod (ADCC):\n\nCharacters are 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C'.\n\nProcessing each:\n\n1. 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1.\n\n2. 'D' \u2192 cnt +=1 (now cnt=1). tmp remains 1.\n\n3. 'C' \u2192 not A or D \u2192 tmp reset to 0.\n\n4. 'C' \u2192 again, tmp remains 0.\n\nSo the total cnt is 1.\n\nThen converting to string: \"1\".\n\nCheck for A and B: neither present \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case: Let's see if there's a case where the second program would output \"Yes\".\n\nSuppose the first program's output is \"AB\", but how?\n\nWait, the first program's output is a count. To get \"AB\" as a string, the count would have to be something like 10 (but \"10\" has no letters). So it's impossible. So the second program will always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the first program's output is a very large number that overflows? But in the problem's context, probably not. So the second program's output is always \"No\".\n\nBut according to the code, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take the first program's input as \"AABBC\".\n\nOriginal string: \"AABBC\".\n\nReplacing BC (positions 4-5):\n\nThe first BC is at positions 4-5 (since the string is \"AABBC\", so the last two characters are BC. So replacing that with D gives \"AABD\".\n\nProcessing the modified string:\n\nCharacters: A, A, B, D.\n\nLoop:\n\n1. 'A' \u2192 tmp=1.\n\n2. 'A' \u2192 tmp=2.\n\n3. 'B' \u2192 not A or D \u2192 reset tmp to 0.\n\n4. 'D' \u2192 cnt +=0 \u2192 cnt remains 0.\n\nSo the count is 0. The second program's input is \"0\" \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's count is 12:\n\nSuppose the modified string is \"AAD\".\n\nThen processing:\n\nA \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nA \u2192 tmp=2.\n\nD \u2192 cnt +=2 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nSo count is 2 \u2192 second program's input is \"2\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nHmm.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the s_mod is built correctly, and the count is computed correctly.\n\nNow, in the code, the s_mod is declared as length 1000. The input string can be up to 1000 characters. The replacement can reduce the length, but the code uses j to track the current length.\n\nThe count_str is length 20, which should be sufficient for a 64-bit integer (max value 9e18, which is 19 digits).\n\nThe check for 'A' and 'B' in the count_str is done correctly.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work as required."
