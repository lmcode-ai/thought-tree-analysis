So that the first digit remains 9, avoiding leading zero. So in the code, the first digit (original leftmost) can't be turned into 0 unless it's not 9. Wait, but if the first digit is 5, then 9-5=4 which is less than 5, so it would be replaced by 4, even if it's the first digit. So the code allows changing the first digit as long as it's not 9.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_222_A). It reads integers n and k, then a sequence of n integers. It tracks consecutive duplicates. The variable 'c' counts the current streak of the same number. If the current number is the same as the last (l), c increments; else, it resets to 1. After processing all numbers, it checks if the current streak plus k exceeds n. If so, output n - c; else -1.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_514_A) takes a long integer x. It processes each digit from right to left. For each digit, if 9 - digit is less than the digit, it uses 9 - digit instead, except when it's the last digit and 9 - r is zero (so leaves it as r). Then it constructs a new number from the collected digits in reverse order (since they were collected in reverse).\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first process the first part, then the second, without I/O in between.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read input for the first part (n, k, then n numbers).\n2. Process the first part's logic to compute the result (either n - c or -1).\n3. Use that result as the input to the second part's processing.\n4. Output the final result of the second part.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first Java program's output is a number, which is the input to the second Java program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, after the first part's computation, that number becomes the input to the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n, k, and the list of a's (n numbers).\n- Compute the first part's result (let's call it first_result).\n- Then, take first_result as the input to the second part's processing (which expects a long integer x).\n- Compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part:\n\nVariables in first Java program:\n\nn, k, l (last number), c (current count). The loop processes each a (the next number in the list). The final check is if c +k >n, then output n -c else -1.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to read n, k, then an array of n integers. Let's say the array is called a_list. Then loop through each element, track l and c.\n\nInitialize l as 0 (since initially, before any elements, the last is 0?), but wait in Java, l is initialized to 0, but the first a is compared to l (0). Wait, in the Java code, the first a is read, then compared to l (which is 0). So if the first a is 0, then c becomes 2? Wait, but that might not be intended. Wait, perhaps the initial l is set to 0, but the first element is a, so if a is 0, then c increments to 1+1=2? Hmm, but in the Java code, the first iteration of the loop is for i from 0 to n-1. The first a is read, then check if a == l (which is 0). So if the first a is 0, then c becomes 1 (since c starts at 1?), wait no, the code initializes c=1. Wait, let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait in the Java code, the variables are declared as:\n\nint n = in.nextInt(), k = in.nextInt(), l = 0, c = 1;\n\nWait, so l is initialized to 0, c to 1. Then the loop starts. The first a is read. Then, if a == l (the initial l is 0), then c +=1. Else, c is set to 1. Then l is set to a.\n\nWait, but before the loop, the first a hasn't been read yet. So the first a is read, then compared to l (0). So if the first a is 0, then c becomes 2. Then l is set to a (0). Then next a is read, etc.\n\nHmm, so the initial c is 1, but that might be because the first element is considered as part of the count? Wait, perhaps the code is counting the current run. Let me think: the first a is read. Since l was 0 (initial), unless a is 0, then c is reset to 1. So the first element's run is 1 (since c starts at 1, but after the first a, if it's not equal to l (0), then c is set to 1 again. Wait, perhaps the code is a bit tricky here.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, l is 0, c is 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\na = first number.\n\nif a == l (0), then c +=1 (so becomes 2). Else, c =1.\n\nThen l is set to a.\n\nWait, but the first a is the first element. So if the first element is 0, then c becomes 2. But that would mean the first element's run is 2? That might be an error. Wait, perhaps the initial c should be 0, but the code is written as c=1. Hmm, perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's requirements. Since I have to translate it as is, I need to replicate exactly.\n\nSo in Fortran, variables:\n\nRead n, k, then an array of n integers. Let's say the array is a_list(1:n).\n\nInitialize l = 0, c =1.\n\nThen loop over each element in a_list:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   a = a_list(i)\n\n   if (a == l) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   end if\n\n   l = a\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i <n; i++), so the loop runs n times, reading each a. The first a is the first element. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the loop from 1 to n is correct.\n\nAfter processing all elements, check if c +k >n. If yes, output n -c, else -1.\n\nSo first_result is either n -c or -1.\n\nNow the second part: the second Java program takes a long x (the first_result from first part), and processes each digit.\n\nThe second part's logic:\n\nTake x, and for each digit (from right to left), compute r = x mod 10. Then decide whether to take r or 9 - r, whichever is smaller. Except when it's the last digit (the original x's first digit when reversed?), and 9 - r is zero, then leave as r.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nIn the second program:\n\nlong x = sc.nextLong();\n\nthen while x>0:\n\nr = x%10\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 (meaning this is the last digit?) and (9 - r ==0) then add r to list else add 9 -r.\n\nelse add r.\n\nThen collect the digits in list, then reverse them (since collected in reverse order) to form the new number.\n\nWait, the list is built by taking digits from right to left (since x is divided by 10 each time). So the first digit added to the list is the last digit of x, then the next is the second last, etc. So the list is in reverse order of the original digits. Then when building newNumber, the code loops through the list from first to last (which is the reversed digits), so the first element is the original last digit, and so on. So the newNumber is constructed as the digits in the list in the order they were added (so the original reversed digits), which effectively builds the number in the original digit order but with each digit possibly modified.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x is 1234.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx starts as 1234.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nr = 1234 mod10 =4. x becomes 123.\n\nCheck if 9-4 (5) <4? 5 is not less than 4, so add 4 to list.\n\nSecond iteration: x=123 mod10 is 3. 9-3=6>3, so add 3.\n\nThird: 2 mod10 is 2. 9-2=7>2, add 2.\n\nFourth: 1 mod10 is 1. 9-1=8>1, add 1.\n\nx becomes 0, loop ends.\n\nList is [4,3,2,1]. Then newNumber is 4*10^0 +3*10^1 +2*10^2 +1*10^3 = 4321. So the new number is same as original here.\n\nAnother example: x= 999.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst digit (from right) is 9. 9-9=0 <9? 0 is less than 9. So check if x/10 is 99 (so not zero). So add 0 (9-9). Then next digit 9: same, add 0. Then next digit 9: same, add 0. So list is [0,0,0]. newNumber is 000, but leading zeros are not printed, so 0. But the code would output 0.\n\nWait, but in the code, when x is 999, the first iteration:\n\nr=9, 9-9=0 <9. Then check if x/10 (99) is zero? No, so add 0. Then next digit 9 again, same. Then the last digit (the first digit of original x) is 9. Wait, when x is 9 (after dividing by 10 twice?), then x/10 is 0. So in that case, when processing the first digit (the original first digit?), let's see:\n\nWait let's take x= 999:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx=999, r=9. 9-9=0 <9. Then check if x/10 (99) is zero? No, so add 0. x becomes 99.\n\nSecond iteration: x=99, r=9. same, add 0. x becomes 9.\n\nThird iteration: x=9, r=9. 9-9=0 <9. Now, x/10 is 0. So the condition (x/10 ==0 and 9 -r ==0) is true (since 9-9 is 0). So add r (9). So list is [0,0,9]. Then when building newNumber, it's 0*10^0 +0*10^1 +9*10^2 = 900. Wait, but the code's list would be [0,0,9], so the newNumber is 0 +0*10 +9*100 = 900. Hmm, so the code would output 900 for input 999.\n\nWait, but according to the code's logic, when the digit is the last (x/10 is 0), and 9 - r is 0, then we add r (9) instead of 0. So in this case, the last digit (original first digit) is kept as 9, so the new number is 900.\n\nSo the code's logic is that for each digit except the first (original leftmost), we can choose the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit. But for the first digit (the leftmost in the original number), if 9 - digit is 0 (i.e., digit is 9), then we can't replace it with 0 because that would lead to a leading zero. So in that case, we leave it as the original digit.\n\nWait, the condition in the code is:\n\nif (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) then add r else add 9 -r.\n\nSo when x/10 is zero (meaning this is the last digit being processed, which is the first digit of the original number), and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9), then we add r (9) instead of 0. So that the first digit remains 9, avoiding leading zero.\n\nSo in the code, the first digit (original leftmost) can't be turned into 0 unless it's not 9. Wait, but if the first digit is 5, then 9-5=4 which is less than 5, so it would be replaced by 4, even if it's the first digit. So the code allows changing the first digit as long as it's not 9. Because the condition only applies when 9 - r is zero (i.e., r is 9). So for other digits, even the first, if 9 - r is less than r, then it's replaced, except when it's 9 and it's the first digit.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nFor each digit (starting from the end of the number):\n\n- if 9 - digit is less than digit, then choose 9 - digit, unless:\n\n   - it's the first digit (original leftmost) and 9 - digit is zero (i.e., digit is 9). In that case, keep the digit as is.\n\nElse, keep the digit.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to process the first_result (the output of first part) as the x for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's processing steps in Fortran:\n\nWe need to take the first_result (which is an integer, possibly negative? Wait, the first part can output -1. But the second Java program expects a long x. Wait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as a long, which can be negative. However, the code in the second Java program has a loop while x>0. So if x is negative, the loop doesn't run, and the newNumber is 0? Or maybe the code is expecting a non-negative input. Let me check the problem's context.\n\nLooking at the second Java program's problem (codeforces_514_A), perhaps the input is a non-negative integer. Because the problem might be about digits, so negative numbers might not be considered. But the code as written would process x as a long, but the loop runs while x>0. So if x is negative, the loop doesn't execute, and the list is empty, so newNumber is 0. But in our case, the first part's output is either n -c (which could be positive) or -1. So if the first part outputs -1, then the second part would process x = -1, leading to newNumber 0. But perhaps the problem expects that the first part's output is non-negative? Let me see the first Java code's condition.\n\nIn the first Java code, the output is n -c if c +k >n. Else -1. So n -c can be negative? Let's see: if c +k >n, then n -c = (n -c) = (n - (c)), but since c can be up to n (if all elements are the same), then n -c could be 0 or positive. Wait, for example, if c is n (all elements same), then c +k >n \u2192 n +k >n \u2192 k>0, which is true if k is given as positive. So n -c would be 0. So the first part's output is either a non-negative number (n -c) or -1.\n\nSo the second part's input can be -1, which would lead to output 0. But perhaps in the problem's context, the first part's output is non-negative, but the code allows for -1. So in Fortran, we have to handle that.\n\nNow, in Fortran, to process the second part:\n\nWe need to take the first_result (integer) as x. Then process each digit.\n\nFirst, we need to collect the digits in a list (like the Java's ArrayList). Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays, perhaps we can use an array of sufficient size (like 20 digits for a long, which can be up to 18 digits). Let's say we have a list array of size 20, and track the count.\n\nInitialize list as an array of integers (digits), and a counter for the number of digits.\n\nBut first, handle x as a long. Wait, in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes, but for a long (Java's long is 64 bits), we need to use a 64-bit integer. In Fortran, that's typically an integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18). So variables need to be of kind 8.\n\nSo steps for second part:\n\n1. Take first_result (integer) as x. But in Fortran, since first_result can be -1, but the code processes x>0, so if x is negative, the list is empty, so newNumber is 0.\n\nWait, but in the second Java code, the loop runs while x>0. So if x is negative, the loop doesn't run, so the list is empty. Then when building newNumber, the loop over list.size() would be zero, so newNumber remains 0. So the output is 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, if first_result is negative, the second part's output is 0.\n\nElse, process the digits.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif (first_result <0) then\n\n   newNumber =0\n\nelse\n\n   process digits...\n\nend if\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nProcessing digits:\n\nInitialize list as an array of integers (digits), and a counter (count_digits).\n\nx = first_result\n\ncount_digits =0\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n   r = mod(x,10)\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n      if ( (x /10 ==0) .and. (9 - r ==0) ) then\n\n         digit = r\n\n      else\n\n         digit = 9 - r\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      digit = r\n\n   end if\n\n   list(count_digits +1) = digit\n\n   count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n   x = x /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, after collecting the digits in list(1:count_digits), which are in reverse order (since we took mod 10 each time, starting from the end), we need to build the newNumber.\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ndo i=1, count_digits\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + list(i) * 10**(i-1)\n\nend do\n\nWait, because the first element in list is the last digit of the original x, so when building the number, the first element is the units place, second tens, etc. So for list elements [4,3,2,1], the newNumber is 4*10^0 +3*10^1 +2*10^2 +1*10^3 = 4321, which is correct.\n\nWait, in the code above, the exponent is i-1. So for i=1, 10^0, etc. That's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the input for the first part, compute first_result, then process that into the second part's result, then output the final result.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: n, k, l, c, a_list(100000) ! assuming n can be up to 1e5, but need to see constraints. But since Java uses int, n can be up to 2^31-1, but in practice, maybe manageable. But for Fortran, using an array of size 1e5 is okay.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the input is n followed by n integers. So in Fortran, we need to read n, then k, then n integers.\n\nWait, the first Java code's first line reads n and k: \"int n = in.nextInt(), k = in.nextInt()\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead *, n, k\n\nThen read n integers into a_list.\n\nBut in Fortran, the array must be declared with a size. Since n can be up to, say, 1e5, but perhaps the problem's constraints are smaller. But to be safe, perhaps use an array of size 1e5 or parameter.\n\nAlternatively, read n first, then allocate the array. But in Fortran 90, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a_list(:)\n\nread *, n, k\n\nallocate(a_list(n))\n\nread *, a_list\n\nThen process the first part.\n\nInitialize l =0, c=1.\n\nloop over a_list:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   a = a_list(i)\n\n   if (a == l) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   end if\n\n   l = a\n\nend do\n\nThen compute first_result:\n\nif (c +k >n) then\n\n   first_result = n -c\n\nelse\n\n   first_result = -1\n\nend if\n\nThen proceed to second part.\n\nNow, second part variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: x, newNumber, r, digit\n\ninteger :: count_digits, list(20) ! assuming max digits 20\n\nx = first_result\n\nif (x <0) then\n\n   newNumber =0\n\nelse\n\n   count_digits =0\n\n   list =0 ! initialize to zero\n\n   do while (x >0)\n\n      r = mod(x,10)\n\n      if (9 - r < r) then\n\n         if ( (x/10 ==0) .and.

Output the result\n\n  print *, newNumber\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, the code is slightly different. Let me check again.\n\nWait in the first part's loop:\n\nIn Java, after reading a, the code checks if a == l (previous value). Then updates c and l.\n\nWait in the code above, the code is:\n\nfor each a in a_list:\n\n   if (a == l) then\n\n      c +=1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   l = a\n\nWait in the Fortran code above, the code is:\n\nif (a_list(i) == l) then\n\n   c = c +1\n\nelse\n\n   c =1\n\nend if\n\nl = a_list(i)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, the code is:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if (a_list(i) == l) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   end if\n\n   l = a_list(i)\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1 for first part:\n\nInput:\n\n3 1\n\n0 0 0\n\nn=3, k=1, a_list is [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a is 0: same as l (0), so c becomes 2. l=0.\n\nSecond a is 0: same as l (0), c becomes 3. l=0.\n\nThird a is 0: same, c becomes 4. l=0.\n\nAfter loop, c=4. Check c +k =4+1=5>3 \u2192 yes. So first_result is 3-4 = -1? Wait wait, n is 3, so 3-4 is -1. But that would be negative. Wait, but the condition is if (c +k >n) \u2192 5>3 \u2192 yes, so output n -c \u2192 3-4 = -1? That can't be right. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the code says:\n\nif (c +k >n) System.out.println(n - c);\n\nWait, in this case, n -c is 3-4 = -1, but the condition is true. So the code would output -1, but that's conflicting with the condition. Wait, that's a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem's first code is from codeforces_222_A. Let me think what the problem is.\n\nThe problem might be: given a sequence of numbers, find the minimal number of elements to remove so that no two equal numbers are adjacent. Or perhaps the problem is different. But according to the code, the code is checking if the current maximum consecutive duplicates plus k exceeds n, then the answer is n -c (the number of elements to remove?), but in this case, when c=4 (n=3), that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, in the example above, n=3, but c=4? That can't happen. Because the maximum possible c is n. So in the example, the code's logic is wrong?\n\nWait, in the example, the a_list is [0,0,0], so the loop:\n\nInitial l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a is 0: same as l \u2192 c becomes 2. l=0.\n\nSecond a is 0: same \u2192 c=3. l=0.\n\nThird a is 0: same \u2192 c=4. l=0.\n\nSo c=4, but n=3. So c can't exceed n. So this is impossible. So the code must have a bug here.\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial c is set to 1. So for n=3 elements, the maximum c can be 3 (if all are same). So in the example, the code's c is 4, which is wrong. So there's a mistake in the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is wrong. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nThe variables are declared as:\n\nint n = in.nextInt(), k = in.nextInt(), l = 0, c = 1;\n\nThen the loop runs for i from 0 to n-1 (n times). The first a is read, then compared to l (0). So in the example with 3 elements all 0:\n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\na =0.\n\na == l (0) \u2192 yes. c +=1 \u2192 c becomes 2.\n\nl =a (0).\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\na=0. same as l \u2192 c becomes 3.\n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\na=0 \u2192 same \u2192 c becomes 4.\n\nSo c is 4, which is larger than n=3. So the code's logic is flawed here.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. But since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if it has a bug. So in the Fortran code, I must replicate that behavior.\n\nSo in the example, the first part's output would be n -c \u2192 3-4 =-1, but the condition is c +k >n \u2192 4+1=5>3 \u2192 yes, so output -1. Which is what the code does.\n\nSo the code is correct as per the problem's requirements, even if the logic seems off. So the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, k=1, a_list [0,0,0]. The first part's output is -1. Then the second part processes x=-1 \u2192 newNumber is 0. So the final output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, k=2, a_list [1,1,2,2,2]. Let's see:\n\nProcessing first part:\n\nInitial l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a=1: not equal to 0 \u2192 c=1. l=1.\n\nSecond a=1: equal to l \u2192 c=2. l=1.\n\nThird a=2: not equal \u2192 c=1. l=2.\n\nFourth a=2: equal \u2192 c=2. l=2.\n\nFifth a=2: equal \u2192 c=3. l=2.\n\nAfter loop, c=3. Check c +k =3+2=5. n=5 \u2192 5 is not greater than 5 \u2192 condition false. So output -1. So first_result is -1 \u2192 second part outputs 0.\n\nAnother test case where first part outputs a positive number:\n\nn=4, k=1, a_list [1,1,1,2]. The consecutive count for the first three 1's is 3. Then 2.\n\nc after processing:\n\nInitial l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a=1: not equal to 0 \u2192 c=1. l=1.\n\nSecond a=1 \u2192 c=2. l=1.\n\nThird a=1 \u2192 c=3. l=1.\n\nFourth a=2 \u2192 not equal \u2192 c=1. l=2.\n\nThe maximum c is 3. So c +k =3+1=4 which equals n=4 \u2192 not greater. So output -1.\n\nAnother case where c +k exceeds n:\n\nn=3, k=2, a_list [1,1,1]. Then c=3. c +k =5>3 \u2192 yes. So first_result is 3-3=0. Then second part processes x=0.\n\nProcessing x=0:\n\nThe loop while x>0 \u2192 x is 0, so loop doesn't run. newNumber is 0.\n\nWait, but x=0 is non-negative, so the code would set newNumber to 0.\n\nWait, but in the second Java code, if x is 0, then the loop doesn't run (since x is 0 initially). So list is empty. Then newNumber is 0.\n\nSo the final output is 0.\n\nAnother test case where first_result is 0 \u2192 second part's output is 0.\n\nAnother test case where first_result is 1234:\n\nThen the second part processes 1234.\n\nDigits are 4,3,2,1.\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\nFirst digit (4):\n\nr=4. 9-4=5>4 \u2192 keep 4.\n\nSecond digit (3): 9-3=6>3 \u2192 keep 3.\n\nThird digit (2): 9-2=7>2 \u2192 keep 2.\n\nFourth digit (1): 9-1=8>1 \u2192 keep 1.\n\nSo list is [4,3,2,1]. newNumber is 4321.\n\nSo the output is 4321.\n\nAnother test case where x=999:\n\nfirst_result is 999 \u2192 second part processes it.\n\nProcessing:\n\nx=999:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nr=9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 check if x/10 (99) is zero? No \u2192 so digit is 0.\n\nlist now has 0. x becomes 99.\n\nSecond iteration: r=9 \u2192 same \u2192 digit 0. list [0,0]. x=9.\n\nThird iteration: r=9. x/10 is 0. So condition (x/10 ==0 and 9-r ==0 \u2192 yes. So digit is 9.\n\nlist is [0,0,9]. count_digits=3.\n\nnewNumber is 0*1 +0*10 +9*100 \u2192 900.\n\nSo output is 900.\n\nAnother test case where x= 5:\n\nProcessing 5:\n\nr=5. 9-5=4 <5 \u2192 so choose 4. But since x/10 is 0 (since x=5 \u2192 after division by 10 is 0), so check if 9-5 is 4, which is not zero. So the condition (x/10 ==0 and 9-r ==0) is false. So digit is 4.\n\nlist has [4]. newNumber is 4.\n\nSo output is 4.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, the variables for the second part must be of integer(8) to handle large numbers. The list is an array of integers (digits 0-9), so integer is okay.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's array a_list must be read correctly. Since in Fortran, the input is read as a list of integers after n and k. So the read *, a_list should work if the input is given as space-separated numbers.\n\n- The exponent in the newNumber calculation: 10**(i-1). In Fortran, 10** is okay, but for large exponents (like 1e18), but since the digits are up to 20, 10^19 is manageable as integer(8).\n\nWait, 10^19 is 1e19, which is larger than 2^63 (which is about 9e18), so for 64-bit integers, 10^19 is 1e19 which is 10000000000000000000, which is larger than 2^63 (9223372036854775807). So for numbers with 20 digits, the maximum would be 99999999999999999999 (20 9's), which is 1e20-1. But 1e20 is 10^20, which is larger than 2^63. So using integer(8) (64-bit) can hold up to 9e18, but 1e20 is 100 times larger. So this would overflow.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The second part's newNumber could be up to 10^19 (for 20 digits), but 64-bit integers can only hold up to 9e18. So for numbers with 19 digits, it's okay, but 20 digits would overflow.\n\nHmm, but in the problem's context, perhaps the input x (first_result) is such that the second part's output doesn't exceed 2^63-1. Or maybe the problem's constraints ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part's output can't be that large. Let's see:\n\nThe first part's first_result is either n -c or -1. The maximum n can be up to 2^31-1 (since Java uses int). So n can be up to ~2e9. So n -c can be up to 2e9, which is within 64-bit integer's capacity. So the second part's x is up to 2e9, which is 9 digits. So the maximum newNumber would be 999,999,999 (if all digits are 9, but modified to 0 except first digit). So the code's 64-bit integer is sufficient.\n\nWait, for example, if x is 2e9 (2000000000), which is 10 digits. The second part's processing would turn each digit into the smaller of digit or 9-digit. Let's see:\n\nTake x=2000000000:\n\nDigits are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2 (from right to left).\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\nFirst digit (0):\n\n9-0=9>0 \u2192 keep 0.\n\nSecond digit (0) \u2192 same \u2192 0.\n\n... all zeros except last digit (2):\n\nThe last digit (the first digit of original x is 2).\n\nProcessing the last digit (2):\n\nr=2. 9-2=7 <2? No, 7>2 \u2192 so keep 2.\n\nSo all digits remain as 0 except the first digit (2). So newNumber is 2000000000 \u2192 which is within 64-bit.\n\nAnother example with 10 digits: x=9999999999 (10 9's). Then processing each digit:\n\nEach digit is 9. For each digit except the first (the leftmost 9):\n\n9-9=0 <9 \u2192 so replace with 0. But for the first digit (the leftmost 9), since x/10 is 999999999 (non-zero), so replace with 0. So all digits become 0 except the first digit? Wait no:\n\nWait, let's process x=9999999999:\n\nFirst iteration (r=9):\n\nx is 9999999999 \u2192 mod10 is 9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if x/10 (999999999) is zero? No \u2192 so digit is 0.\n\nAdd to list: 0.\n\nx becomes 999999999.\n\nSecond iteration: same \u2192 0 added.\n\nThis continues until the last digit (the first digit of original x):\n\nWhen x is 9 (after dividing by 10 nine times):\n\nr=9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck x/10 is 0 \u2192 yes. And 9 -r is 0 \u2192 so add r (9).\n\nSo the list is [0,0,...,0 (9 times),9].\n\nThe newNumber is 0*10^0 + ... +0*10^8 +9*10^9 \u2192 9000000000.\n\nWhich is 9 followed by 9 zeros \u2192 9,000,000,000 \u2192 which is 9e9, which is within 64-bit.\n\nSo the code's variables using integer(8) are sufficient.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, writing the Fortran code as per above steps."
