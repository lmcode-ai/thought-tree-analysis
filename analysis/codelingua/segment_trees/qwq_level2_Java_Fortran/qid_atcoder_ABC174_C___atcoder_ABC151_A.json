    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K from input. It checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returning -1 in that case. Then, if K is divisible by 7, it divides K by 7. Then it multiplies K by 9. Then it calculates the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K equals 1. The result is the answer for this first program.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) takes the output of the first program, which is an integer, and then... Wait, no, actually, the second program's input is a string, and it outputs the first character of that string plus 1. Wait, but how does the output of the first program become the input of the second? Because in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a string input, not an integer. Hmm, maybe I need to check the actual flow here.\n\nWait, the first program's output is an integer (the solve() function returns an integer, which is printed). The second program's input is a string read from stdin. So the output of the first program (the integer) is passed as input to the second program, which then takes that as a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to it, and prints that. \n\nWait, but the second program's code is:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC151_A {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in), 1);\n        String s;\n        String sl[];\n        s = r.readLine();\n        System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n    }\n}\n\nSo it reads a line from input (the output of the first program, which is a number, so the input here is a string like \"123\" or \"-1\"). Then it takes the first character of that string (e.g., '1' in \"123\"), adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints the resulting character. For example, if the first program outputs 7, then the second program would take the string \"7\", take the first character (which is '7'), add 1 to get '8', and print that. If the first program outputs -1, then the input is \"-1\", so the first character is '-', adding 1 gives a character with ASCII 45+1=46 which is '.'.\n\nSo the overall process is: input K to first program, get an integer output, then that integer is converted to a string, and the second program takes that string and outputs the first character plus 1.\n\nNow, the task is to combine these two into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n- The first program's input is read via Fortran's input (probably from stdin).\n- The first program's output is used as the input to the second, but in the combined program, we can't have I/O in between. So the first part's result must be passed directly to the second part's processing without writing to a file or anything.\n\nSo the steps in the Fortran program would be:\n\n1. Read the input (the K value) from stdin.\n2. Compute the first program's result (the solve function's return value).\n3. Then, take that result (integer) and process it as per the second program: convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1, and output that character.\n\nWait, but the second program's processing is taking the first character of the string representation of the first program's output. So in Fortran, after computing the first result (let's call it res1), we need to convert res1 to a string, then process that string.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read K from input.\n- Compute res1 (the solve function's result).\n- Convert res1 to a string (s).\n- Take the first character of s (c).\n- Increment its ASCII value by 1 (c = char(ichar(c) + 1)).\n- Output that character.\n\nNow, let's think about the first part's code (the solve function in Java). Let's translate that into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the solve function in Java:\n\nprivate static int solve() throws IOException {\n    int K = readInt();\n    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;\n    if (K % 7 == 0) K /= 7;\n    K *= 9;\n    int ans = 1;\n    int remainder = 10 % K;\n    while (remainder != 1) {\n        ans++;\n        remainder = remainder * 10 % K;\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the K is read via readInt(), but in the first Java program, the main function calls solve(), which reads K. However, in the combined Fortran program, the first step is to read K from input, so in the Fortran code, K is already read as an integer. So in the Fortran code, the first part's K is the input variable.\n\nWait, in the original Java setup, the first program's main reads K via readInt(), which is part of the solve function. But in the combined Fortran program, the first step is to read K from stdin. So in Fortran, the code would start with reading K from stdin, then proceed with the solve logic.\n\nSo the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead K from input.\n\nThen:\n\nif mod(K,2) == 0 or mod(K,5) ==0 then return -1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables are different. Let's see:\n\nFirst, check if K is even or divisible by 5. If yes, then the result is -1.\n\nElse, check if K is divisible by 7. If yes, divide K by 7.\n\nThen multiply K by 9.\n\nThen compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1.\n\nWait, the loop in Java:\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nThen while remainder !=1:\n\nans increments, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nans = 1\n\nremainder = mod(10, K)\n\ndo while (remainder /= 1)\n\n    ans = ans +1\n\n    remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\nend do\n\nBut need to handle the case where K is 0? Wait, but in the original code, K is read from input, and in the first check, if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. So K can't be 0 here, since 0 would be divisible by 2 and 5, so the code would return -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, after the initial checks, K is not divisible by 2 or 5, so K is at least 1, but after dividing by 7 (if needed), and multiplied by 9, so K is non-zero.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem is to take the result of the first part (res1) and process it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program takes the string representation of res1, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and outputs that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing res1, we need to convert it to a string, then process the first character.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read. For example:\n\ninteger :: res1\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\nBut need to make sure that the string is properly formatted. Alternatively, using an internal write.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, you can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\nBut the length must be sufficient. Alternatively, use an internal write:\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\nBut the variable s must be large enough. Let's say we use a length of 20, which should be enough for any integer.\n\nOnce s is the string, then the first character is s(1:1). Then, we can get its ASCII code with ichar, add 1, then convert back to a character with char.\n\nSo:\n\nc = s(1:1)\n\nnew_c = char(ichar(c) + 1)\n\nThen print new_c.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, read K from input.\n\nThen compute res1:\n\ninteger :: K, res1, ans, remainder, temp_K\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nif (mod(K,2) == 0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n    res1 = -1\n\nelse\n\n    temp_K = K\n\n    if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n        temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n    ans =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n    end do\n\n    res1 = ans\n\nend if\n\nThen, process res1 into the second part's output.\n\nNow, converting res1 to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\nThen, take the first character:\n\ncharacter :: c\n\nc = s(1:1)\n\nnew_c = char(ichar(c) +1)\n\nThen print new_c.\n\nWait, but what if the string is empty? Well, res1 is either -1 or a positive integer. So the string will have at least one character.\n\nWait, for res1 = -1, the string is \"-1\", so first character is '-', so adding 1 gives '.'.\n\nFor res1 = 0, but in the first part, K can't be 0, but if K is 7, then after dividing by 7, K becomes 1, multiplied by 9 gives 9. Then the loop would compute ans. Let's see:\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose K is 7.\n\nThen, in the first part:\n\ntemp_K starts as 7. Since 7 mod 7 is 0, so temp_K becomes 1. Then multiplied by 9 gives 9.\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod 9 = 1. So the loop doesn't run, so ans is 1. So res1 is 1. The string is \"1\", first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nAnother example: K=3 (since 3 is not divisible by 2 or 5, and not divisible by 7). Then temp_K is 3*9=27.\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod 27 =10. Then:\n\nans increments to 2, remainder = 10*10 mod27 = 100 mod27. 27*3=81, 100-81=19 \u2192 19.\n\nans=3 \u2192 remainder 19*10=190 mod27. 27*7=189 \u2192 1 mod27. So remainder is 1. So loop stops. So ans is 3. So the string is \"3\", first character '3' \u2192 '4'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nBut need to make sure that the variables are properly declared.\n\nAlso, in the case where res1 is -1, the string is \"-1\", so first character is '-', so adding 1 gives '.'.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: K, res1, ans, remainder, temp_K\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ncharacter :: c, new_c\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) K\n\n! Compute res1\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n    res1 = -1\n\nelse\n\n    temp_K = K\n\n    if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n        temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n    ans =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n    end do\n\n    res1 = ans\n\nend if\n\n! Convert res1 to string\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\n! Get first character\n\nc = s(1:1)\n\nnew_c = char(ichar(c) +1)\n\n! Output the result\n\nprint *, new_c\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable using a format, you have to make sure that the variable is large enough. The 'I0' format writes the integer in decimal form, so the length of 20 should be sufficient for any integer up to, say, 1e18 (but in the problem, the first part's ans could be up to some value, but even so, 20 is enough).\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, what's the maximum possible ans?\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal ans where 10^ans \u2261 1 mod K. The maximum possible ans would be the order of 10 modulo K, which can be up to K-1. But K is initially up to... Well, the input K is read from the user, but in the first part, K is modified. Let's see:\n\nOriginal K is read, then if divisible by 7, divided by 7, then multiplied by 9. So the maximum possible K after processing could be up to (original K /7)*9. But even so, the ans could be up to K's value. But for K up to say 1e9, the ans could be up to 1e9, which would be a 10-digit number. So 20 is enough.\n\nAnother thing: in the case where res1 is -1, the string is \"-1\", so the first character is '-', so adding 1 gives '.'.\n\nTesting with K=2 (even, so res1 is -1 \u2192 output '.'.\n\nAnother test case: K=7. Then res1 is 1 \u2192 output '2'.\n\nAnother test case: K=3 \u2192 res1=3 \u2192 output '4'.\n\nAnother test case: K=1 (but 1 is not divisible by 2 or 5. Then temp_K is 1*9=9. The remainder is 10 mod9 =1. So ans is 1 \u2192 output '2'.\n\nWait, but K=1 is allowed? Let me see:\n\nOriginal code: K is 1. Since 1 mod 2 is 1, mod5 is 1, so passes the first condition. Then, since 1 mod7 is 1, so temp_K remains 1. Multiply by 9 \u2192 9. Then the loop starts with remainder =10 mod9 =1 \u2192 so ans is 1. So yes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code above, after writing to s, the first character is s(1:1). But in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So that's correct.\n\nThe print statement is print *, new_c. But in the second Java program, the output is a single character, so this should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the output is System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which prints exactly the character. In Fortran, using print *, new_c would print the character followed by a space or newline? Because print * in Fortran adds a space between items, but here there's only one item. Let me check.\n\nIn Fortran, the print *, new_c would output the character followed by a new line. The Java code's output is exactly the character, with no newline? Wait, the Java code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) which outputs exactly the character, but the print statement in Java automatically flushes, but the output is just the character. However, in Fortran, the print statement adds a new line. Wait, but the original Java code's second program's output is a single character followed by a new line? Let me check the Java code:\n\nThe second Java program's main method has:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nThe printf with %c will output the character, but does it add a newline? No, because the format is just %c. So the output is exactly the character, without a newline. However, in Fortran, the print *, statement adds a newline. So this might be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the problem says that the Fortran program must behave identically. So the output must be exactly the same as the original sequence.\n\nIn the original setup, the first program's output is printed with pw.println(solve()), which adds a newline. Then the second program reads that line (the number plus a newline?), but the second program reads the entire line (r.readLine() reads until the newline). So the input to the second program is the number followed by a newline. But when the second program outputs the character, it uses System.out.printf, which does not add a newline. So the total output of the two programs is the character without a newline.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nFirst program's output is, for example, \"7\" followed by a newline (since it uses println). The second program reads that line (so the input is \"7\\n\"), then takes the first character (the '7'), adds 1, and outputs the character '8' without a newline. So the total output is \"8\" (without a newline? Or with? Because in Java, System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...) would just output the character, but the program's output would end there. So the total output is the character followed by whatever the program's standard output ends with. But in the problem's context, perhaps the output is just the character, with no trailing newline.\n\nIn the Fortran code, using print *, new_c would output the character followed by a newline. That would differ from the original setup. So to match exactly, we need to output the character without a newline.\n\nIn Fortran, to write exactly the character without a newline, we can use write(*, '(A)') new_c. Because the * means standard output, and the format A writes the character without any trailing space or newline.\n\nAlternatively, using write(*, '(A)') new_c would be better.\n\nSo changing the print statement to:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') new_c\n\nThat way, it outputs exactly the character, no newline.\n\nSo the final code would have that.\n\nNow, let's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo the final Fortran code:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: K, res1, ans, remainder, temp_K\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ncharacter :: c, new_c\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) K\n\n! Compute res1\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n    res1 = -1\n\nelse\n\n    temp_K = K\n\n    if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n\n        temp_K = temp_K /7\n\n    end if\n\n    temp_K = temp_K *9\n\n    ans =1\n\n    remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n    do while (remainder /=1)\n\n        ans = ans +1\n\n        remainder = mod(remainder *10, temp_K)\n\n    end do\n\n    res1 = ans\n\nend if\n\n! Convert res1 to string\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') res1\n\n! Get first character\n\nc = s(1:1)\n\nnew_c = char(ichar(c) +1)\n\n! Output the result without a newline\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') new_c\n\nend program combined\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nWhat if the string s is longer than 20? For example, if res1 is a very large number. But in the problem's context, the first program's solve function's ans is the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1. The maximum possible ans would be the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K, which for K up to say 1e9, but even then, the ans would be up to K's value. But in practice, the problem constraints may limit K to a reasonable size. However, the character length of 20 should be sufficient for numbers up to 1e19, which is way larger than any practical K here.\n\nAnother possible issue: when K is 0? But in the first check, if K is 0, mod(0,2) is 0, so returns -1. So the string would be \"-1\", first character '-', so output '.'.\n\nAnother test case: K=7. The first program's output is 1 \u2192 string \"1\", first character '1' \u2192 '2'.\n\nAnother case: K=3 \u2192 output is 3 \u2192 '4'.\n\nAnother case: K=1 \u2192 output is 1 \u2192 '2'.\n\nAnother case: K=9 (divisible by 3, but not 2 or 5. Wait, 9 is divisible by 3, but the first condition is only checking for divisibility by 2 or 5. So K=9 is allowed. Then temp_K is 9 (since not divisible by 7). Multiply by 9 \u2192 81. Then remainder is 10 mod81 =10. Then ans increments until 10^ans mod81 is 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLooking for the minimal ans where 10^ans \u22611 mod81.\n\nWe can compute:\n\n10^1 mod81 =10\n\n10^2 mod81 = 100 mod81 =19\n\n10^3 mod81 = 190 mod81 \u2192 190-2*81=190-162=28\n\n10^4 mod81 \u2192 280 mod81 \u2192 280-3*81=280-243=37\n\n10^5 mod81 \u2192 370 mod81 \u2192 370-4*81=370-324=46\n\n10^6 mod81 \u2192 460 mod81 \u2192 460-5*81=460-405=55\n\n10^7 mod81 \u2192 550 mod81 \u2192 550-6*81=550-486=64\n\n10^8 mod81 \u2192 640 mod81 \u2192 640-7*81=640-567=73\n\n10^9 mod81 \u2192 730 mod81 \u2192 730-9*81=730-729=1 \u2192 so ans is 9.\n\nSo the first program's output is 9 \u2192 string \"9\", first character '9' \u2192 '9' +1 is ':', so the output is ':'.\n\nSo the code would output that correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: K=1. The first program's output is 1 \u2192 '2'.\n\nAnother case where K is 7*2=14. Then since K is even, first condition returns -1 \u2192 string \"-1\", first character '-', so output '.'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran is as written above. Let me write it properly formatted."
