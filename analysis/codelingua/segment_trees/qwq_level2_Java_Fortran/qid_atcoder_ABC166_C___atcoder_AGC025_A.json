Wait, the loop continues while a is >=10. So for example, if a is 123, first iteration: a%10 is 3, add to ans (0+3). a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12 >=10: add 2 (ans 5), a becomes 1. Then loop ends, add a (1) to ans (total 6). So the sum is the sum of all digits, not until it's a single digit. Wait, the code is adding all digits of a, but the loop is while a >=10. Wait, no, the loop is while a is >=10, so the first time, you take the last digit, then divide a by 10. So for a=123, first iteration: a is 123, so add 3, a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12, add 2, a becomes 1. Now a is 1, which is less than 10, so loop ends. Then add the remaining a (1) to ans (3+2+1=6). So the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. Because even if a is 99, it would be 9+9=18, but the code would return 18, not 9.",

But given that the problem requires the code to work as the original Java sequence, perhaps the first program's output is always a valid N for the second program. So perhaps the code is okay. Another thing to check: in the second part, when current_N is 1, then temp is (1+1)/2 =1. So the loop runs A from 1 to 1. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0). Wait, sum(0) would be 0? Let's see the sum_digits function for a=0. The code in the function:\n\ntemp =0, which is less than 10. So res =0 +0 =0. So sum_digits(0) is 0. So for N=1, the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0) =1 +0 =1. Then the loop runs A=1. Then sum(1) + sum(0) again, so same as initial. So the answer is 1, which is correct.",

But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the first program's output is a valid N for the second program. So perhaps in the first problem's constraints, N is at least 1, so ans2 can't be zero? Or maybe the second program can handle N=0. Let me see the second Java code's logic when N=0. In the second Java code, if N is 0, then N%2 is 0, so n =0. Then the loop runs A from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC166_C) reads N and M, then an array H of N longs. It initializes a boolean array ans to all true. Then for M times, it reads two integers, temp1 and temp2. Depending on the comparison of H[temp1-1] and H[temp2-1], it sets the corresponding ans entries to false. Finally, it counts how many ans[i] are true and prints that count.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, calculates a value based on splitting N into A and N-A, and finds the minimum sum of the digits of A and N-A. The sum function adds all digits of a number until it's a single digit. The main part computes this minimum and outputs it.\n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first process the first part, then use its result as input to the second part, and output the final result of the second part.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they connected? The first program's output is a number (ans2), which is the input to the second program's N. Because the second program's input is an integer N. So the first program's output is the N for the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first part (N, M, H array), process it to get the count (ans2), then use that count as the N for the second part, compute the second part's result, and output that.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, M, H array from input (as in first Java program).\n2. Process the H array and the M pairs to compute ans2 (the count of true in ans array).\n3. Use ans2 as the N for the second part.\n4. Compute the second part's result using that N.\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nVariables:\n\n- N and M are integers. H is an array of integers (since in Java they are long, but in Fortran, integers can handle that unless very big, but given the problem constraints, probably okay). The ans array is a logical array.\n\nProcessing the M pairs:\n\nFor each of M lines, read two integers (temp1 and temp2). Since Java uses 1-based indices (because it subtracts 1), in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so maybe we can keep that. Wait, in Java, the code uses temp1-1 and temp2-1, so in Fortran, if we have arrays starting at 1, then the indices would be correct. So in Fortran, H is dimensioned as (N), and ans as (N), both starting at 1.\n\nThe loop over M:\n\nRead temp1 and temp2. Then compare H(temp1) and H(temp2). Depending on which is larger, set ans(temp1) or ans(temp2) to false. If equal, both are set to false.\n\nWait, in Java's code:\n\nif H[temp1-1] < H[temp2-1], set ans[temp1-1] to false.\n\nElse if H[temp1-1] > H[temp2-1], set ans[temp2-1] to false.\n\nElse (equal), set both to false.\n\nSo in Fortran terms, for each pair (a, b) (since temp1 and temp2 are the 1-based indices here?), then:\n\nif H(a) < H(b) then ans(a) = .false.\n\nelse if H(a) > H(b) then ans(b) = .false.\n\nelse (equal) set both to false.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, temp1 and temp2 are read as integers, then subtracted by 1 to get 0-based indices. So in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, the temp1 and temp2 can be read directly as indices (since in Java they were 1-based in the input). So in Fortran, the variables would be a and b (temp1 and temp2), and we can use them directly as indices.\n\nSo after processing all M pairs, count the number of .true. in ans array. That's ans2.\n\nSecond part:\n\nThe second part takes N (which is ans2 from first part) and computes the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A.\n\nThe sum function in Java is a helper function that sums the digits until it's a single digit? Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\nWait the sum function in Java:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n    int ans = 0;\n    while (a >= 10) {\n        ans += a % 10;\n        a /= 10;\n    }\n    ans += a;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, no. Wait, the loop continues while a is >=10. So for example, if a is 123, first iteration: a%10 is 3, add to ans (0+3). a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12 >=10: add 2 (ans 5), a becomes 1. Then loop ends, add a (1) to ans (total 6). So the sum is the sum of all digits, not until it's a single digit. Wait, the code is adding all digits of a, but the loop is while a >=10. Wait, no, the loop is while a is >=10, so the first time, you take the last digit, then divide a by 10. So for a=123, first iteration: a is 123, so add 3, a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12, add 2, a becomes 1. Now a is 1, which is less than 10, so loop ends. Then add the remaining a (1) to ans (3+2+1=6). So the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. Because even if a is 99, it would be 9+9=18, but the code would return 18, not 9. Wait, no, the code adds all digits, not until it's a single digit. So the sum function is the sum of the digits of a. So the function is sum_digits(a) = sum of digits of a.\n\nWait, the code's sum function is not the digital root. The digital root would be summing until it's a single digit. But here, the code is adding all digits, even if the result is more than one digit. For example, a=999, sum is 27. So the function is sum of digits, not digital root.\n\nSo the second part's problem is to find the minimal sum of sum(A) + sum(N-A), where A ranges from 1 to N/2 (if N even) or (N+1)/2 (if N odd). Wait, the code in Java:\n\nif N is even, n = N/2, else n = (N+1)/2. So n is the ceiling of N/2. Because for N even, N/2 is the midpoint, and for odd, (N+1)/2 is the upper half. So the loop runs A from 1 to n. The minimal sum is found between A and N-A, where A is up to half of N.\n\nThe initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then for each A from 1 to n, compute sum(A) + sum(N-A), and track the minimum.\n\nSo in Fortran, the second part's code would need to:\n\n- Take the N (from first part's output)\n- Compute the minimal sum as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must first read the input for the first part (N, M, then N H values), process to get ans2, then use ans2 as N for the second part, compute the second part's result, and output that.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N, M.\n\n2. Read N H values (as integers).\n\n3. Initialize ans array (logical, size N) to .true.\n\n4. Read M pairs of integers (a and b each time).\n\n5. For each pair, compare H(a) and H(b):\n\n   if H(a) < H(b): set ans(a) = .false.\n\n   else if H(a) > H(b): set ans(b) = .false.\n\n   else: set both ans(a) and ans(b) to .false.\n\n6. Count the number of .true. in ans array: ans2.\n\n7. Now, compute the second part using ans2 as N.\n\n8. Compute the minimal sum as per the second Java program.\n\n9. Output the minimal sum.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So:\n\ninteger :: N, M\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: H\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: ans\n\nBut since we need to read N first, we can allocate H and ans after reading N.\n\nWait, but in the first step, the code reads N, then M, then N H values. So the steps would be:\n\nRead N, M.\n\nAllocate H(N) and ans(N).\n\nRead H array.\n\nInitialize ans to .true.\n\nThen read M pairs.\n\nProcessing the pairs.\n\nThen count the true in ans.\n\nThen proceed to second part.\n\nNow, the second part's variables:\n\ninteger :: current_N = ans2\n\nThen compute the minimal sum.\n\nThe sum function can be a function in Fortran.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be written as internal or external. Let's write a function sum_digits(a) that returns the sum of digits of a.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't be inside the main program unless using modules, but for simplicity, perhaps write it as an internal function.\n\nAlternatively, code it inline.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFunction sum_digits(a) result(res)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: res, temp, digit\n\nres = 0\n\ntemp = a\n\ndo while (temp >= 10)\n\n   digit = mod(temp,10)\n\n   res = res + digit\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nres = res + temp\n\nend function sum_digits\n\nBut in the main program, perhaps we can define this as an internal function.\n\nAlternatively, code it inline each time, but better to have a function.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, M, i, a, b, ans2, current_N, ans_min, A, temp, temp2\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: H\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: ans\n\n! First part processing\n\nread*, N, M\n\nallocate(H(N), ans(N))\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   read*, H(i)\n\nend do\n\nans = .true.\n\ndo i = 1, M\n\n   read*, a, b\n\n   if (H(a) < H(b)) then\n\n      ans(a) = .false.\n\n   else if (H(a) > H(b)) then\n\n      ans(b) = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      ans(a) = .false.\n\n      ans(b) = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nans2 = count(ans)\n\n! Now second part\n\ncurrent_N = ans2\n\n! Compute the minimal sum\n\nif (current_N ==0) then\n\n   ans_min = 0 ! but probably not possible since N is at least 1?\n\nelse\n\n   if (mod(current_N,2) ==0) then\n\n      temp = current_N /2\n\n   else\n\n      temp = (current_N +1)/2\n\n   end if\n\n   ans_min = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(current_N -1)\n\n   do A =1, temp\n\n      if (A > current_N -A) cycle ! since A can't exceed N-A, but since A is up to temp which is ceil(N/2), so N-A >= A?\n\n      ! Wait, the loop in Java is up to n which is ceil(N/2). So A can be up to that, so N-A >= A.\n\n      ! So no need to check.\n\n      temp2 = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(current_N - A)\n\n      if (temp2 < ans_min) then\n\n         ans_min = temp2\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nprint*, ans_min\n\ncontains\n\ninteger function sum_digits(a)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a\n\ninteger :: temp, digit, res\n\nres =0\n\ntemp = a\n\ndo while (temp >=10)\n\n   digit = mod(temp,10)\n\n   res = res + digit\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nres = res + temp\n\nsum_digits = res\n\nend function sum_digits\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let me check the loop in the second part.\n\nIn the Java code, the loop runs A from 1 to n (n is N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2). So in Fortran, the loop is A from 1 to temp (which is n). For each A in that range, compute sum(A) + sum(N-A). The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then compare each A's value.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial ans is set to sum(1) + sum(N-1). But when A=1, that's exactly the same as the first term. So the loop starts from A=1, but the initial ans is already the first case. So the loop can start from A=1, and the first iteration would check if it's less than the initial ans. But since it's the same, it won't change. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop starts at A=1, so the first iteration would check A=1, which is the same as the initial value. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the loop is from A=1 to temp. The code for the second part:\n\ncurrent_N is ans2.\n\nCompute temp as n = current_N /2 if even, else (current_N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans_min to sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(current_N -1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to temp:\n\ncompute temp2 = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(current_N -A)\n\nif temp2 < ans_min, update ans_min.\n\nFinally, output ans_min.\n\nEdge cases: What if current_N is 0? Well, in the first part, ans2 is the count of true in ans array. Since ans starts as all true, and each comparison can set some to false. The minimal possible ans2 is 0 (if all are set to false). But in that case, the second part would have N=0, but the code would have current_N=0. Then in the second part, the code would have an error because when current_N is 0, the loop would have temp = 0, so the loop doesn't run. The initial ans_min would be sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(-1). But that's invalid. Wait, but in the first part, N is the number of elements, which is at least 1 (since the problem probably requires N >=1). So ans2 can be 0, but then the second part's N is 0, which would be invalid. However, perhaps the problem constraints ensure that N in the first part is at least 1, so ans2 can be 0, but then the second part's N is 0, which would cause an error. Hmm, but the second Java program's input is N, which is the output of the first program. So if the first program outputs 0, then the second program would have N=0, but in the second Java code, when N is 0, the code would have a problem. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the first program's output is a valid N for the second program. So perhaps in the first problem's constraints, N is at least 1, so ans2 can't be zero? Or maybe the second program can handle N=0. Let me see the second Java code's logic when N=0.\n\nIn the second Java code, if N is 0, then N%2 is 0, so n =0. Then the loop runs A from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(-1). But sum(-1) would be problematic. So in the problem's context, perhaps the first program's output is always at least 1. So in the Fortran code, perhaps we can proceed without handling N=0, but in code, when current_N is 0, the code would have an error. But since the problem's input for the first program would have N >=1, and the first program's output is ans2 which can be 0, but the second program's input is that, so perhaps the code should handle it. Alternatively, maybe the problem ensures that the first program's output is a valid N for the second program. So perhaps in the code, we can proceed as written, but in the case of current_N=0, the code would have an error. But given that the problem requires the code to work as the original Java sequence, perhaps the first program's output is always a valid N for the second program. So perhaps the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the second part, when current_N is 1, then temp is (1+1)/2 =1. So the loop runs A from 1 to 1. The initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0). Wait, sum(0) would be 0? Let's see the sum_digits function for a=0. The code in the function:\n\ntemp =0, which is less than 10. So res =0 +0 =0. So sum_digits(0) is 0. So for N=1, the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0) =1 +0 =1. Then the loop runs A=1. Then sum(1) + sum(0) again, so same as initial. So the answer is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see the first Java program's sample input.\n\nSuppose first program's input is N=3, M=2, H values 3, 5, 2.\n\nThen the pairs:\n\nSuppose first pair is 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2 in Java, which are 1 and 2 in Fortran). H(1)=3 vs H(2)=5. Since 3 <5, set ans(1) to false.\n\nSecond pair, say 2 and 3. H(2)=5 vs H(3)=2. 5>2, so set ans(3) to false.\n\nNow ans array is [F, T, F]. So ans2 is 1 (only the second element is true).\n\nThen the second part's N is 1. The minimal sum is 1 (as above).\n\nSo the code would output 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case for second part: N=100.\n\nThe minimal sum would be when A=50 and 50, sum(50) + sum(50). 5+0 +5+0 =10. But maybe there's a better split. Wait, the minimal sum for N=100 is 1? Let me think. Wait, the minimal sum is the minimal sum of digits of A and N-A. For example, A=1 and 99: sum(1)=1, sum(99)=9+9=18 \u2192 total 19. A=50 and 50: sum(50)=5, sum(50)=5 \u2192 total 10. A=99 and 1: same as first. A=10 and 90: sum(1+0)=1, sum(9+0)=9 \u2192 total 10. Wait, 10 is better. Wait, but maybe even better. Let's see A=19 and 81: sum(1+9)=10, sum(8+1)=9 \u2192 total 19. Not better. Hmm, perhaps the minimal is 1 (if possible). Wait, A=10 and 90 gives sum 1+9=10. Wait, 10 is better than 19. Wait, but what about A= 199? No, N is 100. Wait, the minimal is 1 (if possible). Wait, maybe A=10 and 90 gives sum 1 (from 10: 1+0=1) and 9 (from 90:9+0=9) \u2192 total 10. Wait, that's 1+9=10. Alternatively, A= 100 and 0? But A can't be 100 because N is 100, so N-A is 0. But in the code, A can be up to 50 (since N is even, n=50). So the minimal is 10?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is 1 (if possible). Let me think of A=1 and 99: sum(1) is 1, sum(99)=18 \u2192 total 19. Not better. A= 19 and 81: sum(10) and 9 \u2192 19. Hmm. Wait, maybe the minimal is 1 (if possible). Wait, perhaps A= 100, but that's not allowed. Wait, the minimal is 10. So the code would compute that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the function sum_digits is correctly implemented.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the second part, when current_N is 0, but the code would have an error. But assuming that the first program's output is at least 1, then it's okay.\n\nNow, in the first part, the variables a and b are read as integers. Since in Java, the input for the pairs are integers, which in Fortran are read as integers. So that's okay.\n\nThe count of ans is done via count(ans), which is a Fortran intrinsic function. So that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together, the code should be as written above.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop for the second part:\n\ndo A =1, temp\n\n   temp2 = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(current_N - A)\n\n   if (temp2 < ans_min) then\n\n      ans_min = temp2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the initial ans_min is set to sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(current_N -1). So that's correct.\n\nEdge case when current_N is 1: then current_N -1 is 0, sum_digits(0) is 0. So initial ans_min is 1+0=1. Then the loop runs A=1, which gives sum(1) + sum(0) \u2192 same as initial. So the answer is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: current_N=2. Then n=1. The loop runs A=1. The initial ans_min is sum(1)+sum(1)=1+1=2. Then A=1: same as initial. So the answer is 2. But maybe there's a better split? No, since 2 can only be split as 1+1. So correct.\n\nAnother case: current_N=3. Then n=2 (since (3+1)/2=2). The loop runs A=1 and 2.\n\nInitial ans_min is sum(1)+sum(2) \u21921+2=3.\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(2)=3 \u2192 same.\n\nA=2: sum(2)+sum(1)=3 \u2192 same. So the answer is 3.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better split? No.\n\nAnother case: current_N=9. The minimal is when A=9 and 0? But A can't be 9 since n is 5 (since 9 is odd, (9+1)/2=5). So A up to 5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\ncurrent_N=9.\n\nThe minimal sum would be when A=9 and 0, but A can't be 9. The maximum A is 5 (since (9+1)/2=5). So A=5: sum(5) + sum(4) \u21925+4=9. But maybe A=4 and 5: sum(4)+5 \u21929. Alternatively, A=9 is not allowed. Wait, the minimal is 9? Or is there a better split?\n\nWait, perhaps A=9 is not allowed. The minimal is 9. Alternatively, maybe A=9 is allowed? Wait, the loop runs up to n=5. So A can't be 9. So the minimal is 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A= 9 is not considered. So the code would compute 9 as the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal is 9. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
