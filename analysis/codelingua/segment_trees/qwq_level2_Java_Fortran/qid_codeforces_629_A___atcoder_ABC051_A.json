So if the first program's output has any commas, they would be replaced. But in the first program, the output is an integer, so unless the number is written with commas (like 1,000), but in Java, the default is to print numbers without commas.

So in code:\n\nfine =0\ncounter =0\n\ndo i =1, num  ! columns\n    counter =0\n    do k =1, num  ! rows\n        if ( arr(k)(i:i) == 'C' ) then\n            counter = counter +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    fine = fine + (counter*(counter-1))/2\nend do\n\nThen the rows:\n\ndo i =1, num  ! rows\n    counter =0\n    do k =1, num  ! columns\n        if ( arr(i)(k:k) == 'C' ) then\n            counter = counter +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    fine = fine + (counter*(counter-1))/2\nend do\n\nWait, in the second loop, for each row",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_629_A. It reads an integer num, then num strings. Then it calculates a fine based on the number of 'C's in each column and row. The fine is the sum of combinations of 2 for each column and each row where there are at least two Cs. The formula used is (counter * (counter-1))/2 for each column and row.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC051_A, reads a line of input, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs the result. Wait, but the first program's output is the fine, which is a number. Then the second program would take that number as input? Wait, but the second program expects a string input, which would be the output of the first. But the first outputs a number, so when the second program runs, it would read that number as a string, replace commas with spaces. Hmm, but numbers don't have commas unless they are formatted with commas. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, but when printed, it's just the number, so if it's, say, 123, then the second program would read \"123\" and since there are no commas, it would output the same. But maybe in some cases, the first program's output could have commas? Like if the fine is a large number, but in Java, numbers are printed without commas unless using a locale. So probably, the second program's input is just the number from the first, and since there are no commas, the output is the same. But the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's job is to replace commas with spaces. So if the first program's output has any commas, they would be replaced. But in the first program, the output is an integer, so unless the number is written with commas (like 1,000), but in Java, the default is to print numbers without commas. So maybe the second program's output is the same as the first's output. But perhaps the problem expects that the second program is part of the chain, so even if it does nothing, it must be included. So the final Fortran program must combine both steps.\n\nWait, but the user says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's input is read from stdin, then its output is passed to the second Java program's input, and the second's output is the final output. So the Fortran program must read the input, process it through both steps, and output the final result.\n\nSo the first step is to process the first Java program's logic, then the second's.\n\nLet me break down each step.\n\nFirst Java program steps:\n\n1. Read an integer num (number of strings).\n2. Read num strings into an array.\n3. For each column (from 0 to num-1), count the number of 'C's in that column. For each column, compute (count choose 2) and add to fine.\n4. Do the same for each row: for each row, count the 'C's in that row, compute (count choose 2), add to fine.\n5. Output the total fine.\n\nSecond Java program steps:\n\n1. Read a line (the fine from first program as a string).\n2. Replace any commas in the string with spaces.\n3. Output the modified string.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so when printed, it's just the number. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"123\", then the second reads \"123\" and outputs \"123\" (since no commas). But if the first outputs \"1,000\" (unlikely in Java), then the second would output \"1 000\". But in Java, the first program uses System.out.println(fine), which for an integer would print without commas. So the second program's output would be the same as the first's output. But perhaps the problem expects that the second program is part of the chain, so even if it does nothing, it must be included. So the Fortran program must process both steps.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the fine as per the first Java program, then take that fine's string representation (as it would be printed by the first Java program), replace commas with spaces, and output that.\n\nWait, but how does the first Java program's output get into the second's input? The first's output is a number, so when printed, it's written as a string without commas. So the second program's input is that string. So in the Fortran program, after computing the fine, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string by replacing commas with spaces, then output the result.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read the input (num and the strings) as per the first Java program.\n\n2. Compute the fine as per the first Java's logic.\n\n3. Convert the fine to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program, which is just the integer value, so no commas).\n\n4. Replace any commas in that string with spaces.\n\n5. Output the resulting string.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the output is printed with System.out.println(fine), which for an integer would just be the number as a string without commas. So the string to process in the second step is exactly the string representation of the integer. So in Fortran, after computing the integer fine, we can convert it to a string, then process it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (num and the strings).\n\n- Compute the fine as per the first Java's logic.\n\n- Convert the fine to a string (as an integer, so no commas).\n\n- Replace any commas in that string with spaces (though there shouldn't be any, but the code must do it anyway).\n\n- Output the modified string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statements. Let me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program):\n\nRead num, then read num strings. Each string is of length num? Because in the first Java code, the for loops for columns and rows go up to num, implying that each string is of length num. Because in the first loop, for each column i (from 0 to num-1?), and for each row k (from 0 to num-1?), the code checks arr.get(k).charAt(i). So each string must be exactly length num. So in Fortran, we can read each string as a character array of length num.\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses sc.next() which reads tokens separated by whitespace. But in the problem's context, perhaps each line is a single string. Wait, the code uses sc.next() which reads the next token, but if the input is given as each string on a separate line, then sc.next() would read each line as a token. Wait, but in Java, Scanner's next() reads the next token, which by default is separated by whitespace. So if the input is given as each string on a separate line, then each sc.next() would read each line. Alternatively, maybe the input is given as all the strings in one line separated by spaces. The problem isn't clear, but the code uses sc.next() for each of the num strings, so each string is a token separated by whitespace. So in Fortran, we need to read num strings, each as a token (split by whitespace). But in Fortran, reading from stdin can be done with read(*,*) but that might have issues with spaces. Alternatively, perhaps each string is a single word, so using list-directed input would work. Alternatively, perhaps the input is given as each string on its own line, so we can read each with a read statement.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {\n    String s = sc.next();\n    arr.add(s);\n}\n\nSo sc.next() reads the next token, so each string is a token separated by whitespace. So the input for the first program is the number followed by num tokens (each possibly containing letters, but the code is looking for 'C's). So in Fortran, to read the same input, we can read the first integer, then read num strings, each as a character array of length, say, up to some maximum. But in the code, the strings are stored in an ArrayList, so each can be of varying length, but in the code, when accessing arr.get(k).charAt(i), it's assuming that each string is at least length num? Because the loop for columns goes up to num-1. Wait, the first loop is for columns: for each column i from 0 to num-1, and for each row k from 0 to num-1, check the i-th character of the k-th string. So each string must be at least length num. So the input must have each string exactly of length num. Therefore, in the input, each of the num strings is exactly num characters long, with no whitespace. So the input is structured as:\n\nFirst line: the integer num.\n\nThen num lines, each containing exactly num characters (no spaces, so each line is a single string of length num).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to read this, after reading num, we can read num strings, each of length num. So in Fortran code:\n\nRead the first integer, then read num strings, each of length num.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger :: num\ncharacter(len=100) :: temp  ! Or some sufficient length, but better to use num as length.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we can read each string as a character array of length num. Let me think:\n\nWe can declare an array of characters for each string. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: num, i, j, k, fine, counter\ncharacter(len=100) :: strings(100)  ! Assuming num is up to 100, but better to use dynamic arrays? But Fortran 90 allows allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem may have constraints, but for the code, perhaps we can use a fixed size. Alternatively, read the first number, then allocate an array of that size.\n\nWait, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nRead num first.\n\nThen allocate an array of strings of length num, with size num.\n\nBut in Fortran 90:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: num, i, j, k, fine, counter\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    read(*,*) num\n    allocate( arr(num) )\n    do i = 1, num\n        read(*,*) arr(i)\n    end do\n\nBut each arr(i) must be exactly length num. So when reading, the input lines must have exactly num characters each, with no trailing spaces. So the read statement may need to read a string of length num.\n\nAlternatively, using a format to read exactly num characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each string as a character array of length num, trimming any extra spaces. Hmm, but in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nallocate( arr(num), source = repeat(' ', num) )\n\nThen read each line into arr(i)(1:num). But the input lines must be exactly num characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using list-directed input (the default read(*,*) ) would read each string as a single token, but if the input lines have exactly num characters, then that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps the safest way is to read each string as a character array of length num, using a format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code, the strings can be read as character arrays of length num, and the code can process them.\n\nOnce the strings are read, the next step is to compute the fine.\n\nThe first part of the fine calculation is for columns:\n\nLoop over each column (i from 1 to num, since in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default). For each column i, count the number of 'C's in that column across all rows (k from 1 to num). Then compute (counter * (counter-1))/2 and add to fine. Then reset counter.\n\nThen do the same for rows: for each row (i from 1 to num), count the 'C's in that row's characters (k from 1 to num), compute the combination, add to fine.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first loop is over columns:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < num; i++) { // columns\n    for (int k = 0; k < num; k++) { // rows\n        if (arr.get(k).charAt(i) == 'C') counter++;\n    }\n    fine += (counter*(counter-1))/2\n    counter =0\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the rows are arr(1) to arr(num), each of length num. So for column i (1-based in Fortran), the characters are arr(k)(i:i) for k from 1 to num.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfine =0\ncounter =0\n\ndo i =1, num  ! columns\n    counter =0\n    do k =1, num  ! rows\n        if ( arr(k)(i:i) == 'C' ) then\n            counter = counter +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    fine = fine + (counter*(counter-1))/2\nend do\n\nThen the rows:\n\ndo i =1, num  ! rows\n    counter =0\n    do k =1, num  ! columns\n        if ( arr(i)(k:k) == 'C' ) then\n            counter = counter +1\n        end if\n    end do\n    fine = fine + (counter*(counter-1))/2\nend do\n\nWait, in the second loop, for each row i, we loop over each column k (from 1 to num), checking arr(i)(k:k). That's correct.\n\nOnce the fine is computed, the next step is to process it through the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program takes the fine's string representation (as printed by the first Java program), replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it.\n\nIn Java, the first program's output is System.out.println(fine), which for an integer would be the number as a string with no commas. So the string to process is just the integer's string form. So in Fortran, we need to convert the integer fine to a string, then replace any commas with spaces, then output.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: fine_str\nwrite(fine_str, '(I0)') fine\n\nThen, process the string to replace commas with spaces. Since in the first program's output, there are no commas, but the code must do it anyway.\n\nSo loop through each character in fine_str, and replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, using a function to replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(fine_str)\n    if ( fine_str(i:i) == ',' ) then\n        fine_str(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that the string is properly trimmed, as the write statement may have leading spaces.\n\nWait, the write statement with '(I0)' should write the integer without leading spaces, but the character variable may have trailing spaces. So using len_trim to get the actual length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\ninteger :: fine\nwrite(s, '(I0)') fine\ns = adjustl(s)  ! left-justify to remove leading spaces, but actually, I0 should not have leading spaces.\n\nThen, loop over each character in s up to len_trim(s):\n\ninteger :: i, len_s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\ndo i =1, len_s\n    if ( s(i:i) == ',' ) then\n        s(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, output s.\n\nWait, but in the first program's output, the fine is printed as an integer, so the string has no commas. So the replacement does nothing, but the code must do it.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program would be:\n\nRead the input (num and the strings), compute the fine, convert to string, replace commas with spaces, then print the result.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the strings in Fortran. Let's see:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: num, i, j, k, fine, counter\ncharacter(len=100) :: arr(100)  ! Assuming num is up to 100. Alternatively, use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, but for dynamic allocation:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: num, i, j, k, fine, counter\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    character(len=20) :: s\n\n    read(*,*) num\n    allocate( character(len=num) :: arr(num) )\n    do i = 1, num\n        read(*, '(A)') arr(i)  ! Read a line as a string of exactly num characters.\n    end do\n\n    fine =0\n\n    ! Process columns\n    do i =1, num\n        counter =0\n        do k =1, num\n            if ( arr(k)(i:i) == 'C' ) counter = counter +1\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) /2\n    end do\n\n    ! Process rows\n    do i =1, num\n        counter =0\n        do k =1, num\n            if ( arr(i)(k:k) == 'C' ) counter = counter +1\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) /2\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert fine to string\n    write(s, '(I0)') fine\n    s = adjustl(s)  ! Not sure if needed, but to make sure leading spaces are gone.\n\n    ! Replace commas with spaces\n    do i =1, len_trim(s)\n        if ( s(i:i) == ',' ) then\n            s(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, trim(s)\n\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the read statement for the strings, using '(A)' may read the entire line, but since each line is exactly num characters, that's okay. Alternatively, using '(A<num>)' to read exactly num characters. But in Fortran, the format '(A)' reads until the end of the line, so if the input lines are exactly num characters, that's fine.\n\nWait, but if the input lines have exactly num characters, then the read statement with '(A)' will read them correctly. However, if there are any trailing spaces, that could be a problem. But according to the problem's first Java code, the strings are read via sc.next(), which would read tokens separated by whitespace. Wait, but in the first Java code, the code uses sc.next() which reads the next token, so each string is a token, which may have any characters except whitespace. But in the problem's context, perhaps each string is exactly num characters long, and the input is given as each string on its own line, so each line is exactly the string. So the read(*,'(A)') would read each line correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for the strings is given as all on one line, separated by spaces. But the Java code uses sc.next() for each of the num strings, so each is a token. So in Fortran, if the input is given as the first line is num, then the next line has the num strings separated by spaces, then each string is read via read(*,*) arr(i). But in that case, the strings can't contain spaces. But the problem's first Java code is looking for 'C's, so perhaps the strings are composed of letters, but the exact input format is crucial.\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. The first Java program's input is as per its code: first an integer, then num strings (each via sc.next()), so the input would be:\n\nFirst line: the integer num.\n\nThen, the next lines: each line has a string (since sc.next() reads tokens, but if each string is on its own line, then each sc.next() would read each line as a token. Alternatively, if the strings are on the same line separated by spaces, then sc.next() would read each token.\n\nBut the problem's first Java code's logic requires that each string is exactly length num. So the input must be such that each of the num strings is exactly num characters long. So the input format is:\n\nFirst line: num.\n\nThen, num lines each containing exactly num characters (no spaces, so each line is a single token).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code should read num, then read num lines, each as a string of exactly num characters. So the read statement for the strings should be:\n\nread(*, '(A<num>)') arr(i)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, to read exactly num characters from each line, the format should be '(A<num>)'.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nallocate( character(len=num) :: arr(num) )\n\ndo i =1, num\n    read(*, '(A<num>)') arr(i)\nend do\n\nThis way, each line is read as exactly num characters, which matches the problem's requirement.\n\nTherefore, the corrected code would have that read statement.\n\nAlso, in the code, when writing the fine to the string, using '(I0)' is correct. Then, after replacing commas with spaces, we need to print the string. The print *, trim(s) would output the string, trimming any trailing spaces. Since the original Java code would have printed the number without any commas, the replacement does nothing, but the code must do it.\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: num, i, k, fine, counter\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    character(len=20) :: s\n\n    read(*,*) num\n    allocate( character(len=num) :: arr(num) )\n    do i = 1, num\n        read(*, '(A'//trim(str(num))//')') arr(i)\n    end do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the format string can't be constructed dynamically in the read statement like that. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the format '(A<num>)' requires the num to be known at compile time. So if num is variable, we can't have a format like that. So this approach won't work.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How to read exactly num characters per line when num is variable?\n\nAlternative approach: read the entire line as a string, then take the first num characters.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read each line into a temporary string of sufficient length, then copy the first num characters into arr(i).\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: temp  ! A large enough buffer.\n\ndo i =1, num\n    read(*, '(A)') temp\n    arr(i) = temp(1:num)\nend do\n\nThis way, regardless of the line's length, we take the first num characters. This is better because it avoids the dynamic format issue.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: num, i, k, fine, counter\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arr(:)\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    character(len=1000) :: temp  ! Buffer to read each line\n\n    read(*,*) num\n    allocate( character(len=num) :: arr(num) )\n    do i = 1, num\n        read(*, '(A)') temp\n        arr(i) = temp(1:num)\n    end do\n\n    fine =0\n\n    ! Process columns\n    do i =1, num\n        counter =0\n        do k =1, num\n            if ( arr(k)(i:i) == 'C' ) counter = counter +1\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) /2\n    end do\n\n    ! Process rows\n    do i =1, num\n        counter =0\n        do k =1, num\n            if ( arr(i)(k:k) == 'C' ) counter = counter +1\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) /2\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert fine to string\n    write(s, '(I0)') fine\n    s = adjustl(s)  ! Not sure if needed, but to make sure leading spaces are gone.\n\n    ! Replace commas with spaces\n    do i =1, len_trim(s)\n        if ( s(i:i) == ',' ) then\n            s(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, trim(s)\n\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program main\n\nThis should handle the input correctly. The temp variable reads the entire line, then we take the first num characters for each string in arr.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. For example, if num is 3, and the input strings are \"CCC\", \"CCB\", \"BBA\", then the columns:\n\nColumn 1: C, C, B \u2192 2 Cs \u2192 1 combination.\n\nColumn 2: C, C, B \u2192 2 \u2192 1.\n\nColumn 3: C, B, A \u2192 1 \u2192 0.\n\nTotal columns: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: 3 Cs \u2192 3C \u2192 3*2/2 =3.\n\nRow 2: 2 Cs \u2192 1.\n\nRow3: 0 \u21920.\n\nTotal rows: 3+1+0=4.\n\nTotal fine: 2+4=6. Then the second program would output \"6\".\n\nAnother test case: if the fine is 1000, then the string is \"1000\", no commas, so output is \"1000\".\n\nIf the fine were 123456, same.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code uses allocatable arrays, which requires Fortran 90 or later.\n\nAlso, the print statement uses trim(s) to remove any trailing spaces from the character variable s. Since the write statement to s may have trailing spaces (since s is length 20), using trim ensures only the actual characters are printed.\n\nThe replacement loop goes through each character in the trimmed length of s, so it won't process beyond the actual string.\n\nThis should handle everything."
