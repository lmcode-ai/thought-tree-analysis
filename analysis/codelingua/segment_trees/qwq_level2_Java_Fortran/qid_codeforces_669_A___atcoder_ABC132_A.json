    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n from input, then calls solve(n), which calculates (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if there's a remainder, else 0. So the output here is some integer. But since the next program in the sequence uses this output as input, I need to capture that value and pass it into the second program's logic.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC132_A) takes a string input, checks if it has exactly two distinct characters each appearing exactly twice. It outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on that. Wait, but the input here should be the output of the first program. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, but the second expects a string. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user said the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is an integer, which is then used as the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string input. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's solve function: it prints an integer. The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output is an integer, which when passed to the second program, would be read as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 4, then the second program would read \"4\" as the input string. Then the second program checks if that string has exactly two different characters each appearing twice. Wait, but \"4\" is a single character, so the second program would output \"No\". Hmm, but maybe the actual input to the second program is the output of the first, which is a number, so the input string would be the digits of that number. For example, if the first program outputs 12, then the second program's input is \"12\", which has two characters each appearing once, so it would output \"No\". But if the first program outputs 1122, then the second would process \"1122\" and see two characters each appearing twice, so \"Yes\".\n\nSo the key is that the first program's output is an integer, which is then converted to a string and passed as input to the second program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, I need to compute the first result, convert it to a string, then process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nNow, the task is to combine both into a single Fortran program. The first step is to read the input (the original input to the first Java program), process it through the first's logic, then process the result through the second's logic, and finally output the second's result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the integer n from the user).\n2. Compute the first result: (n / 3) * 2 + (if n mod 3 is 0 then 0 else 1). Let me see: For example, n=4: 4/3 is 1, so 1*2=2, plus 1 (since 4 mod3 is 1), total 3. Wait, the formula is (n//3)*2 + (1 if n mod3 !=0 else 0). Wait the original code in Java is (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1). Let me confirm with n=3: 3/3=1, so 2, plus 0 \u2192 2. n=4: 1*2 +1 \u21923. n=5: 1*2 +1 \u21923. n=6: 2*2 \u21924. So that's correct.\n\n3. Convert that result to a string. Because the second program processes a string. So in Fortran, after computing the integer result, we need to write it as a string. For example, if the result is 12, the string is \"12\".\n\n4. Then, process that string through the second program's logic. The second program counts the frequency of each character in the string. It must have exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. So for the string \"12\", the counts are 1 and 1 \u2192 no. For \"1122\", counts are 2 and 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n- Read n from input.\n\n- Compute first result (integer).\n\n- Convert that integer to a string (so that we can process its digits).\n\n- Process the string to check the conditions (two unique characters, each appearing twice).\n\n- Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- Read n as integer.\n\nCompute the first part:\n\nresult = (n / 3) * 2\n\nremainder = mod(n,3)\n\nif remainder ==0 then add 0 else add 1 \u2192 total = result + (1 if remainder /=0 else 0)\n\nWait, the original code is (n/3)*2 + (n%3 ==0 ?0:1). So yes.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, first_result, remainder\n\nremainder = mod(n,3)\n\nfirst_result = (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, remainder /=0)\n\nThen, convert first_result to a string. Let's see, in Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write with an internal file or a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nwrite(str, '(I0)') first_result\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces? Well, using I0 should format it without leading spaces. So the string is the digits of first_result.\n\nThen, process the string:\n\nWe need to count the occurrences of each character in the string. The string is the digits of first_result. Let's see, the string can be of variable length. Let's get the length:\n\ninteger :: len_str = len_trim(str)\n\nThen, create an array or a hash map equivalent. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash, we can track the counts manually.\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string, count how many times each appears.\n\nWe can use an array of size 256 (for ASCII) or just track the unique characters.\n\nAlternatively, since the characters are digits (since first_result is an integer, so the string is digits), so possible characters are '0' to '9', but maybe also a minus sign if negative? Wait, but the first Java program's input is read as an integer, but in the problem, perhaps n is positive? The original code may assume n is positive. Let's assume that first_result is non-negative, so the string is digits only.\n\nWait, the first Java program's solve function: when n is 0, then (0/3)*2 +1 (since mod(0,3)=0 \u2192 0 \u2192 so 0. Wait, no: 0 mod3 is 0, so the second term is 0. So 0. So first_result can be zero. So the string would be \"0\".\n\nSo the characters in the string are digits (0-9).\n\nSo possible characters are 0-9. So we can have an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) to count their occurrences.\n\nInitialize an array counts(0:9) = 0.\n\nThen loop over each character in the string:\n\ndo i = 1, len_str\n\n   c = str(i:i)\n\n   digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')  ! assuming c is a digit.\n\n   counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, check the counts:\n\nWe need exactly two different digits, each with count 2.\n\nSo first, check that the total number of non-zero counts is exactly 2.\n\nThen, for each of those two counts, they must be 2.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncount_nonzero = 0\n\nvalid = .true.\n\ndo i =0,9\n\n   if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n      count_nonzero = count_nonzero +1\n\n   elseif (counts(i) /=0) then\n\n      valid = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (count_nonzero ==2 .and. valid) then \u2192 yes else no.\n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\nWe can collect all the counts that are non-zero, and check that exactly two of them are 2, and the rest are zero.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nInitialize a list of counts. Let's see:\n\nInitialize a flag ok = .true.\n\nFirst, check that the total length is 4? Wait no, the second program's input is the string from the first's output. The second program's logic requires that the input string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. So the total length must be 4? Because 2 characters each appearing twice \u2192 total length 4. Wait, yes! Because if there are two characters each appearing twice, the total length is 4. So first, check that the length of the string is 4. Otherwise, it's automatically invalid.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code:\n\nThe input is a string s. Then, it checks that each character in the map has count 2, and the map's size is 2. So the total length is sum of counts \u2192 2*2 =4. So the string must be exactly 4 characters long. So in the Fortran code, first check if the length of the string is 4. If not, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the input is read as a string, so the user could input any length. But in our case, the input to the second program is the output of the first, which is an integer. So the string length depends on the first's result. For example, if first_result is 12 \u2192 length 2 \u2192 then the second program would output \"No\".\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after converting first_result to a string, we need to process it as per the second program's logic, which requires that the string has exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice. So the steps are:\n\nCheck that the string length is 4. If not \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nThen, check that exactly two different characters, each appearing twice.\n\nAlternatively, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, get the length of the string. If it's not 4 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nElse, proceed to count the characters.\n\nSo in code:\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\n\nif (len_str /=4) then\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n   ... process ...\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the input could be of any length, but the check is done regardless. So in our case, even if the string is length 4 but not meeting the counts, it would output \"No\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter converting first_result to str:\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\n\nif (len_str /=4) then\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n   ... count the digits ...\n\n   then check if exactly two different digits, each with count 2.\n\nend if\n\nWait, but let's see the original code's logic:\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\nIt uses a HashMap to count each character's occurrence. Then loops through the entries. If any entry's count is not 2 \u2192 ok becomes false. Then, after all entries, if ok is true and the map's size is 2 \u2192 output yes else no.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- All counts are exactly 2.\n\n- There are exactly two different characters (so the map's size is 2).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nThe counts array must have exactly two elements with value 2, and the rest 0.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter counting the digits (0-9):\n\ncount_2 = 0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n   if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n      count_2 = count_2 +1\n\n   elseif (counts(i) /=0) then\n\n      ! there's a count not 2 \u2192 invalid\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (count_2 ==2 .and. ok) then \u2192 yes else no.\n\nWait, but perhaps better to track:\n\nInitialize ok = .true.\n\ncount_2 =0\n\ndo i=0,9\n\n   if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n      count_2 = count_2 +1\n\n   else if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (ok .and. count_2 ==2) then \u2192 yes else no.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nThe program will:\n\n1. Read the integer n from input.\n\n2. Compute first_result as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert first_result to a string.\n\n4. Check if the string length is 4. If not \u2192 output \"No\".\n\n5. Else, count the occurrences of each digit (0-9).\n\n6. Check if exactly two digits have count 2, others zero \u2192 output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, first_result, remainder, counts(0:9), i, len_str\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nlogical :: ok\n\nThen:\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nCompute first_result:\n\nremainder = mod(n,3)\n\nfirst_result = (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, remainder /=0)\n\nConvert to string:\n\nwrite(str, '(I0)') first_result\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\n\nif (len_str /=4) then\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n   counts = 0\n\n   do i=1, len_str\n\n      character(1) :: c = str(i:i)\n\n      integer :: digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n      counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ok = .true.\n\n   count_2 =0\n\n   do i=0,9\n\n      if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n         count_2 = count_2 +1\n\n      else if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n         ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (ok .and. count_2 ==2) then\n\n      print *, \"Yes\"\n\n   else\n\n      print *, \"No\"\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the loop over i=1 to len_str, the character is str(i:i). Need to make sure that the characters are indeed digits. Since first_result is an integer, the string should only contain digits, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but what if first_result is negative? The original Java code's first program's input is read as an integer, but perhaps the problem expects n to be positive. Since the problem's first Java code uses n/3, which for negative numbers would be different. But the user hasn't specified constraints. However, in the codeforces problem, perhaps n is a positive integer. Assuming that first_result is non-negative, so the string is digits only.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, let's check some test cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput to first program: n=3 \u2192 first_result is (3/3)*2 +0 \u2192 2 \u2192 string is \"2\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=4 \u2192 first_result is (1)*2 +1 \u21923 \u2192 string \"3\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nTest case 3:\n\nn=6 \u2192 first_result is (2)*2 \u21924 \u2192 string \"4\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nTest case where first_result is 1122 \u2192 but how?\n\nWait, let's see. Let's find n such that first_result is 1122. Wait, first_result is computed as (n/3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3)\u22600 else 0). Let's see:\n\nSuppose first_result is 12 \u2192 which is 12 \u2192 string \"12\" \u2192 length 2 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nWait, to get a 4-digit string, first_result must be between 1000 and 9999.\n\nSuppose first_result is 1122 \u2192 let's see what n would be.\n\nLet me compute first_result = 1122.\n\nWe have first_result = (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3)\u22600 else 0).\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet q = n divided by 3 (integer division), r = mod(n,3).\n\nThen first_result = 2*q + (1 if r\u22600 else 0).\n\nWe need 2*q + (r\u22600 ?1:0) = 1122.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: r=0 \u2192 then 2*q =1122 \u2192 q=561 \u2192 n=3*q = 1683 \u2192 then first_result is 2*561 = 1122 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo n=1683 would produce first_result 1122 \u2192 string \"1122\".\n\nThen the second part would process \"1122\".\n\nThe counts for '1' is 2, '2' is 2 \u2192 so output \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the Fortran code should output \"Yes\" for n=1683.\n\nAnother test case: n=1683 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother test case where first_result is 1212 \u2192 string \"1212\" \u2192 counts 1:2, 2:2 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother case where first_result is 1111 \u2192 counts 1:4 \u2192 so counts(1)=4 \u2192 which is not 2 \u2192 output no.\n\nAnother case where first_result is 1234 \u2192 counts each 1, so counts are 1 each \u2192 no.\n\nAnother case where first_result is 1123 \u2192 counts 1:2, 2:1, 3:1 \u2192 so some counts not 2 \u2192 no.\n\nThus, the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding in Fortran.\n\nWait, in the loop over i from 1 to len_str, the character is str(i:i). In Fortran, strings are characters, so when we take str(i:i), that's a substring of length 1.\n\nThe digit is computed as ichar(c) - ichar('0'). So for '0' it's 0, '1' is 1, etc.\n\nNow, in the code, the counts array is initialized to zero before the loop. So:\n\ncounts = 0\n\nThen, loop over each character.\n\nNow, in the code, variables:\n\ncount_2 is not declared yet. Oh right, in the code I wrote earlier, I have:\n\ncount_2 =0\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared. So need to add:\n\ninteger :: count_2\n\nSo the variable declarations should include that.\n\nPutting all variables at the top:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, first_result, remainder, counts(0:9), i, len_str, count_2\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str\n\nlogical :: ok\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\n! Compute first_result\n\nremainder = mod(n,3)\n\nfirst_result = (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, remainder /=0)\n\n! Convert to string\n\nwrite(str, '(I0)') first_result\n\nlen_str = len_trim(str)\n\nif (len_str /=4) then\n\n   print *, \"No\"\n\nelse\n\n   counts = 0\n\n   do i=1, len_str\n\n      character(1) :: c = str(i:i)\n\n      integer :: digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n      counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\n   end do\n\n   ok = .true.\n\n   count_2 =0\n\n   do i=0,9\n\n      if (counts(i) ==2) then\n\n         count_2 = count_2 +1\n\n      else if (counts(i) >0) then\n\n         ok = .false.\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (ok .and. count_2 ==2) then\n\n      print *, \"Yes\"\n\n   else\n\n      print *, \"No\"\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop over i from 1 to len_str, the variable 'digit' is declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables declared inside a loop are allowed in Fortran 90 and later. But perhaps better to declare it outside. Alternatively, compute it inline.\n\nAlternatively, can compute digit as:\n\ndigit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nThus, the code can be written without declaring 'c' and 'digit' inside the loop.\n\nLet me adjust that to avoid possible issues.\n\nRewriting the loop:\n\ndo i=1, len_str\n\n   integer :: digit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n   counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't declare variables inside a do loop like that unless using Fortran 90's block. Alternatively, declare digit outside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, compute digit inline.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute digit as:\n\ndigit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nBut in Fortran, you can assign to a variable without declaring it first? No, variables must be declared.\n\nThus, need to declare digit as an integer before the loop.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: n, first_result, remainder, counts(0:9), i, len_str, count_2, digit\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\ndo i=1, len_str\n\n   character(1) :: c = str(i:i)\n\n   digit = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\n   counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, without using 'c':\n\ndigit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nBut str(i:i) is a character, so ichar can take that.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ndo i=1, len_str\n\n   digit = ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n   counts(digit) = counts(digit) +1\n\nend do\n\nThus, the variable 'digit' must be declared.\n\nSo the variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: n, first_result, remainder, counts(0:9), i, len_str, count_2, digit\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nTesting for possible errors.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting first_result to a string, leading zeros?\n\nFor example, if first_result is 0 \u2192 string is \"0\", length 1 \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nAnother case: first_result is 100 \u2192 string \"100\" \u2192 length 3 \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother case: first_result is 1010 \u2192 string \"1010\" \u2192 length 4. The counts are 1:2, 0:2 \u2192 so yes.\n\nThus, the code should output \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: first_result is 1111 \u2192 counts(1)=4 \u2192 so no.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code."
