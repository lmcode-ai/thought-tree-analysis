Second Java file (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n\nIt reads a string (using in.next(), so probably the next token, but maybe the entire line?), replaces all \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the number of \"A\" followed by \"D\" in some way.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (codeforces_49_A):\n\nIt reads a string from input, then looks for the last non-space and non-question mark character. Then checks if that character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), case-insensitive. Outputs YES or NO based on that.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n\nIt reads a string (using in.next(), so probably the next token, but maybe the entire line?), replaces all \"BC\" with \"D\", then counts the number of \"A\" followed by \"D\" in some way. The logic is: whenever an 'A' is found, increment a temporary counter. When a 'D' is found, add the temporary to the total count. Other characters reset the temp. The output is the total count.\n\nWait, but in the first program, the input is read via nextLine(), so the entire line. The second program uses in.next(), which would read the next token, but maybe in the context of the problem, the input is a single word? Or perhaps the first program's output is the input for the second. Wait, the original problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is then the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string (probably the input from the first's output?), but the first's output is a single word. Hmm, but the second program's code uses in.next(), which would read that single word. Then the second program processes that string.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". Then the second program takes that as input. Let me see the second program's code again. The second program's solve method takes the input string, replaces \"BC\" with \"D\". But in the input string being \"YES\" or \"NO\", there's no \"BC\" so the replacement does nothing. Then the processing would be on the original string. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first program outputs \"YES\". Then the second program's input is \"YES\". The string after replacement is still \"YES\". Then the code counts A's and D's. Since there are no A's or D's, the count would be 0. So the output would be 0. If the first outputs \"NO\", then the second's input is \"NO\", which also has no A or D, so output 0. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the flow here. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output is a line, which is read by the second program as its input. So the second program's input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but the second program's code uses in.next(), which would read the next token. Since the input is a single word, that's okay. So the second program's processing would be on that string. Let me see:\n\nFor example, if the first program outputs \"YES\", then the second's input is \"YES\". The code replaces \"BC\" with \"D\", but there are none, so s is \"YES\". Then the loop goes through each character:\n\nCharacters are 'Y', 'E', 'S'. None are 'A' or 'D', so tmp remains 0, and cnt remains 0. So the output is 0.\n\nIf the first program outputs \"NO\", then the second's input is \"NO\". The same logic applies, so output is 0. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is not the only input? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. The user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's input is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nHmm, but in the second Java program, the code is written to process a string, replacing BC with D, then counting A followed by D in some way. But in the input from the first program, there's no BC, so the replacement does nothing. So the second program's output would be 0 in either case. But maybe the actual problem requires that the first program's input is the original input, and the second program's input is the first's output, but perhaps the first program's output is a string that the second can process meaningfully. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's logic.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program. The first program reads a string (the entire line), then scans from the end to find the first non-space and non-? character. Then checks if that character is a vowel (including y). So the output is YES or NO based on that.\n\nThe second program takes that output (YES or NO) as input, and processes it. But in the second program's code, the input is read via in.next(), which would get the entire \"YES\" or \"NO\" string. Then the code replaces BC with D. Since there's no BC in \"YES\" or \"NO\", the string remains the same. Then the code counts the number of A's followed by D's? Wait, the code's logic is:\n\nInitialize cnt and tmp to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in s:\n\nIf the character is 'A', increment tmp (so tmp counts the number of A's so far? Or the current run of A's?)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n- if it's 'A', then tmp increases by 1. So every time an 'A' is found, tmp is incremented. Then, when a 'D' is found, the current tmp is added to cnt. So for example, if the string is \"AABCD\", then:\n\nAt first 'A', tmp becomes 1.\n\nSecond 'A', tmp becomes 2.\n\nThen 'B' (but after replacement, if there was BC, but in this example, let's say the original string had BC replaced to D, so the 'B' here is part of the original string? Wait, perhaps I need to think of the example where the input to the second program is a string that has A's and D's.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program's code is designed to count the number of \"A\" followed by \"BC\" sequences, but since BC is replaced by D, each \"A\" before a D contributes to the count. Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose the input to the second program is \"ABBC\". Then replacing BC with D gives \"ABD\". Then processing:\n\nCharacters are 'A', 'B', 'D'.\n\nFirst 'A' \u2192 tmp becomes 1.\n\nThen 'B' \u2192 not A or D \u2192 tmp resets to 0.\n\nThen 'D' \u2192 adds tmp (0) to cnt \u2192 so total is 0. Hmm, maybe another example.\n\nTake input \"ABC\". Replaced becomes \"AD\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst 'A' \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nThen 'D' \u2192 cnt += 1 \u2192 cnt is 1. So the output is 1. So the code counts the number of A's before each D. So each D adds the number of A's encountered before it (but only up to that point? Or in the current run?)\n\nWait, the code's logic is that whenever an 'A' is found, tmp increases. When a 'D' is found, it adds the current tmp to cnt, and leaves tmp as is? Or does tmp reset? Let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nif 'A', tmp +=1.\n\nElse if 'D', cnt += tmp.\n\nElse, tmp =0.\n\nSo, for example, in \"AABCD\" (after replacement, if BC is replaced by D, then the string would be \"AAD\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst 'A' \u2192 tmp=1.\n\nSecond 'A' \u2192 tmp=2.\n\nThird 'D' \u2192 cnt +=2 \u2192 cnt is 2.\n\nSo the total is 2. So each D adds the current number of A's encountered so far in the current run (since other characters reset tmp). So the D's count the number of A's in the current run up to that point.\n\nHmm, okay. So the second program's output is the count of such pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is to translate both programs into a single Fortran program that does the same as the sequence.\n\nThe key is to process the input through both steps without I/O in between.\n\nSo the first step is to read the input (from stdin), process it as per the first Java program, then pass the result to the second step's processing, then output the final result.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the input string (the first program's input).\n\n2. Process it to find the last non-space and non-? character, check if it's a vowel \u2192 determine \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n3. Take that result string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") and process it through the second program's logic (replace BC with D, then count the A-D pairs).\n\n4. Output the final count.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the first's output. So the first's output is a string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"), which is then the input to the second's processing.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead the original input (the first program's input).\n\nProcess it to get the first output (YES/NO).\n\nThen process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nThen output the second's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must do all that in one go.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read the input string. In Fortran, reading a line can be done with a read statement, but need to handle possible spaces. Since the first Java program uses nextLine(), which reads the entire line including spaces except the newline.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using a character array with a length, but maybe using a variable-length string. Alternatively, read the entire line into a character variable.\n\nFortran 2003 has the ability to read a line with the GET command, but perhaps using a read statement with an asterisk.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read a line as a string, you can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut need to make sure that the entire line is read. Alternatively, using a variable length string with allocatable arrays, but maybe for simplicity, use a fixed length.\n\nAssuming the input line is not too long, let's use a sufficiently large array.\n\nSo first step: read the input string into a variable, say s1.\n\nThen process s1 to find the last non-space and non-? character.\n\nLoop from the end of the string backward until a character that is not ' ' or '?' is found.\n\nOnce found, check if it is a vowel (case-insensitive). So convert to lowercase (Fortran has functions for that).\n\nIf yes, then the first output is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nStore this result in a string, say first_result.\n\nThen, process first_result through the second program's logic.\n\nSecond step processing:\n\nTake the first_result string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"), and process it as per the second Java program.\n\nFirst, replace all occurrences of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the code does s = in.next().replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nSo in Java, the replacement is done globally, replacing every occurrence of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nIn Fortran, we need to do the same. So for each occurrence of \"BC\" in the string, replace it with \"D\".\n\nHmm, how to do that in Fortran.\n\nWe can loop through the string and check for \"BC\" sequences, then replace them.\n\nAlternatively, process the string character by character, building a new string where whenever \"BC\" is found, replace with D.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to loop through the characters, and whenever a 'B' is found followed by a 'C', replace them with 'D' and skip the next character.\n\nBut need to be careful with indices.\n\nAlternatively, create a new string, and for each position i in the original string:\n\nIf the current character is 'B' and the next is 'C', then add 'D' to the new string and skip the next character.\n\nElse, add the current character.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nSuppose the input string is s2 = first_result.\n\nWe need to process s2 to create s3 where all \"BC\" are replaced with \"D\".\n\nThen, process s3 to compute the count.\n\nOnce s3 is built, then process each character to compute the count.\n\nThe count is done as follows:\n\nInitialize cnt =0, tmp=0.\n\nLoop over each character in s3:\n\nif char is 'A', then tmp +=1.\n\nelse if char is 'D', then cnt += tmp.\n\nelse, set tmp to 0.\n\nSo after processing all characters, output cnt.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read the input string.\n\nThen process first step.\n\nThen process second step.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe can use character arrays for the strings.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_str\n\nThen, process the first part.\n\nFind the last non-space and non-? character.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ninteger :: i, len\ncharacter :: last_char\n\nlen = len_trim(input_str)\n\nlast_char = ' '\n\ndo i = len, 1, -1\n    if (input_str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. input_str(i:i) /= '?') then\n        last_char = input_str(i:i)\n        exit\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, check if last_char is a vowel (case-insensitive).\n\nConvert to lowercase:\n\nlast_char = achar(ichar(last_char) + 32)  ! assuming uppercase, but need to check.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert to lowercase, we can use the ichar and achar functions. But need to check if the character is uppercase.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'lower' function if available in some versions, but perhaps better to handle it manually.\n\nWait, the original Java code uses Character.toLowerCase(ch). So in Fortran, for a character c:\n\nif (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n    c = char(ichar(c) + 32)\nelse if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n    ! already lowercase\nelse\n    ! not a letter, but according to the problem, the first program's last character is a letter (since it's not space or ?)\nend if\n\nSo:\n\nlast_char = achar(ichar(last_char))\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose last_char is uppercase, like 'A', then adding 32 (since ASCII 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97). So:\n\nif (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n    last_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)\nend if\n\nThen check if it is in ['a','e','i','o','u','y'].\n\nSo:\n\nif (last_char == 'a' .or. last_char == 'e' .or. last_char == 'i' .or. last_char == 'o' .or. last_char == 'u' .or. last_char == 'y') then\n    first_result = 'YES'\nelse\n    first_result = 'NO'\nend if\n\nWait, but first_result needs to be a string. Let's define first_result as a character variable of length 3 or 4 (since \"YES\" is 3, \"NO\" is 2). Let's make it length 4 to be safe.\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: first_result\n\nThen set it to 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nNow, moving to the second part.\n\nWe need to process first_result through the second step.\n\nFirst, replace all \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nLet's create a new string s3 which is the result of replacing \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nThe input for this step is first_result.\n\nBut first_result is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf first_result is \"YES\", then the string is 'Y','E','S'. There are no BC, so s3 is \"YES\".\n\nIf it's \"NO\", then the string is 'N','O', so no BC either. So s3 remains the same.\n\nBut in code, we need to process it properly.\n\nTo replace \"BC\" with \"D\", we can loop through the characters of first_result and build s3.\n\nLet me code this part.\n\nFirst, the input string for the second step is first_result.\n\nWe can process it as follows:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s2, s3\ninteger :: i, len_s2, pos = 1\n\ns2 = first_result\nlen_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n\ns3 = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len_s2\n    if (i < len_s2) then\n        if (s2(i:i) == 'B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n            s3(pos:pos) = 'D'\n            pos = pos +1\n            i = i +1  ! skip the next character\n        else\n            s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n            pos = pos +1\n        end if\n    else\n        s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n        pos = pos +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but this requires s3 to be a character array that can be built incrementally. However, in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps using an array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of sufficient length, and building s3 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a loop to check for \"BC\" and replace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize s3 as an empty string, then loop through each character in s2, and whenever a 'B' is found followed by 'C', append 'D' and skip the next character, else append the current character.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling this requires some care.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s3\ninteger :: i, len_s2, s3_len = 0\n\ns3 = ''\n\nlen_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s2\n    if (i <= len_s2 -1) then\n        if (s2(i:i) == 'B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n            s3(s3_len+1:s3_len+1) = 'D'\n            s3_len = s3_len +1\n            i = i +1\n        else\n            s3(s3_len+1:s3_len+1) = s2(i:i)\n            s3_len = s3_len +1\n        end if\n    else\n        s3(s3_len+1:s3_len+1) = s2(i:i)\n        s3_len = s3_len +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps using an array of characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of sufficient length, and then trimming it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Since in the first step's output, the string is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are short, so the replacement won't do anything. But the code must handle it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\ns3 = s2\n\nThen, loop through the string to find \"BC\" and replace.\n\nBut in Fortran, string manipulation is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s3\ninteger :: i, len_s2\n\ns3 = s2\nlen_s2 = len_trim(s3)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s2 -1\n    if (s3(i:i) == 'B' .and. s3(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n        s3(i:i+1) = 'D' // ' '  ! replace with D and then shift the rest?\n        ! Wait, this might not work because replacing two characters with one would require shifting the rest.\n\nHmm, this approach is getting complicated. Maybe the first approach of building s3 character by character is better.\n\nLet me try to code that.\n\nInitialize s3 as an empty string (or a large enough array), and a position counter.\n\nLet me set s3 as a character array of length 1000, and track the current position.\n\ninteger :: pos = 1\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s3 = ''\n\ns3 = ' '\n\nlen_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s2\n    if (i < len_s2) then\n        if (s2(i:i) == 'B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n            s3(pos:pos) = 'D'\n            pos = pos +1\n            i = i +1\n        else\n            s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n            pos = pos +1\n        end if\n    else\n        s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n        pos = pos +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps using a character array and then trimming it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of length 1000, and then after processing, the actual length is pos-1.\n\nThen, s3 is the substring from 1 to pos-1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you assign s3(pos:pos) = 'D', you have to make sure that the array is large enough. So perhaps initializing s3 as a character array of sufficient length (like 1000), and then after processing, the actual string is s3(1:pos-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the first step's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are 3 and 2 characters, respectively, the replacement won't do anything. So s3 will be the same as first_result. But the code must still process it correctly.\n\nBut regardless, the code must handle the replacement properly.\n\nOnce s3 is built, then process it to compute the count.\n\nInitialize cnt and tmp to 0.\n\nloop over each character in s3:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s3)\n    char = s3(i:i)\n    if (char == 'A') then\n        tmp = tmp +1\n    else if (char == 'D') then\n        cnt = cnt + tmp\n    else\n        tmp = 0\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the 'else' clause (other than A or D) sets tmp to 0.\n\nYes, so in code:\n\nInitialize cnt =0, tmp=0.\n\nLoop over each character in s3:\n\nif char is 'A', then tmp +=1.\n\nelse if char is 'D', then cnt += tmp.\n\nelse, set tmp to 0.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: cnt =0, tmp=0\ncharacter(len=1) :: current_char\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s3)\n    current_char = s3(i:i)\n    if (current_char == 'A') then\n        tmp = tmp +1\n    else if (current_char == 'D') then\n        cnt = cnt + tmp\n    else\n        tmp =0\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen, output cnt.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: input_str, first_result, s2, s3\n    integer :: i, len, last_char_pos, cnt, tmp, pos, len_s2\n    character :: last_char\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,'(A)') input_str\n\n    ! Process first part\n    len = len_trim(input_str)\n    last_char = ' '\n    do i = len, 1, -1\n        if (input_str(i:i) /= ' ' .and. input_str(i:i) /= '?') then\n            last_char = input_str(i:i)\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert to lowercase\n    if (last_char >= 'A' .and. last_char <= 'Z') then\n        last_char = char(ichar(last_char) + 32)\n    end if\n\n    if (last_char == 'a' .or. last_char == 'e' .or. last_char == 'i' .or. &\n        last_char == 'o' .or. last_char == 'u' .or. last_char == 'y') then\n        first_result = 'YES'\n    else\n        first_result = 'NO'\n    end if\n\n    ! Process second part\n    s2 = first_result\n    len_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n    s3 = ' '\n    pos = 1\n\n    do i = 1, len_s2\n        if (i < len_s2) then\n            if (s2(i:i) == 'B' .and. s2(i+1:i+1) == 'C') then\n                s3(pos:pos) = 'D'\n                pos = pos +1\n                i = i +1\n            else\n                s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n                pos = pos +1\n            end if\n        else\n            s3(pos:pos) = s2(i:i)\n            pos = pos +1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now process s3 to compute cnt\n    cnt =0\n    tmp =0\n    do i = 1, pos-1\n        select case (s3(i:i))\n            case ('A')\n                tmp = tmp +1\n            case ('D')\n                cnt = cnt + tmp\n            case default\n                tmp =0\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, cnt\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code above, when building s3, the initial s3 is set to ' ' (a single space?), but perhaps better to initialize it as a large enough array. Also, in Fortran, when you assign s3(pos:pos) = 'D', you have to make sure that s3 is large enough. Since s3 is declared as len=1000, that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, s3 is declared as len=1000, so when we do s3(pos:pos) = 'D', it's okay as long as pos doesn't exceed 1000. Since the first_result is at most 3 characters, the loop will run up to 3 steps, so pos will be at most 3 or 4, so it's safe.\n\nWait, in the second processing step, s2 is first_result, which is either \"YES\" (3 chars) or \"NO\" (2). So len_s2 is 3 or 2.\n\nIn the loop over i from 1 to len_s2:\n\nFor example, if s2 is \"YES\" (3 characters):\n\ni=1:\n\nCheck if i < 3 (yes). Check if s2(1:1) is 'B' and s2(2:2) is 'C'. 'Y' and 'E' \u2192 no. So append 'Y' to s3 at pos 1. pos becomes 2.\n\ni=2:\n\ni <3 \u2192 yes. Check s2(2:2) is 'E', next is 'S'. Not BC \u2192 append 'E' to pos 2. pos becomes 3.\n\ni=3:\n\ni is not less than 3 (since len_s2 is 3). So append 'S' to pos3. pos becomes4.\n\nSo s3 is 'YES' with length 3 (pos-1 is 3).\n\nThen processing s3:\n\nEach character is Y, E, S.\n\nLoop over i=1 to 3:\n\ni=1: char is Y \u2192 default \u2192 tmp=0.\n\ni=2: char E \u2192 default \u2192 tmp=0.\n\ni=3: char S \u2192 default \u2192 tmp=0.\n\nSo cnt remains 0.\n\nSimilarly for \"NO\", the result is 0.\n\nBut what if the first program's output was something else? Well, according to the problem, the first program's output is the input to the second, so the code must handle that.\n\nWait, but in the problem's setup, the first program's output is either YES or NO, so the second program's processing will always result in 0. But perhaps the problem requires that the code is correct for any input, not just the specific case where the first program's output is YES/NO. Wait, no, the problem says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. So the code must handle that.\n\nBut the code above should work for any input.\n\nWait, but in the first program's code, the input is read as a line (nextLine()), so the entire line is read, including spaces and other characters. The first program's processing is correct.\n\nNow, let's check for possible errors in the code.\n\nIn the first part, when finding the last non-space and non-? character, the loop starts from the end and goes backward until it finds a character that is not space or '?'. The code correctly does that.\n\nThe conversion to lowercase is done only if the character is uppercase. That's correct.\n\nThe first_result is set to 'YES' or 'NO' correctly.\n\nIn the second part, the replacement of BC with D is done by checking each pair. The loop over i increments by 1 each time, but when a BC is found, i is increased by 1 to skip the next character. This should handle overlapping cases correctly.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is \"BBC\", then the first B is at i=1, next is B and C? No, the first two characters are B and B, so no. Then i=2, B and C? No. Hmm, but in \"BCCB\", the first BC is at positions 1-2, then after replacing, the next characters would be handled.\n\nWait, the code's logic for the replacement is correct.\n\nThen, processing the s3 string to count the A's and D's.\n\nThe code uses a select case, which is okay.\n\nNow, testing with an example where the first program's output is \"YES\".\n\nThe second program's processing would give 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the first program's output is \"ABBC\".\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the first program's output is either YES or NO. But if we consider a different scenario where the first program's output is different (but according to the problem's setup, it's not necessary), but the code must handle any input.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the Fortran program must behave exactly as the sequence of Java programs. So the first program's output is the input to the second, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the first program's output is \"ABBC\".\n\nThen, the second program's processing would replace \"BC\" with D, so the string becomes \"ABD\".\n\nThen processing:\n\nCharacters are A, B, D.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=1: 'A' \u2192 tmp=1.\n\ni=2: 'B' \u2192 default \u2192 tmp=0.\n\ni=3: 'D' \u2192 cnt +=0 \u2192 cnt remains 0.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nWait, but the correct count would be 0?\n\nWait, the code's logic for the second part:\n\nIn \"ABD\", the 'A' is at position 1, then 'B' (which resets tmp to 0), then 'D' which adds tmp (0) to cnt. So yes, 0.\n\nAnother example: input to second program is \"ABCD\".\n\nAfter replacement, \"ABD\".\n\nSame as above.\n\nAnother example: input is \"AABBC\".\n\nAfter replacement, \"AAD\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nCharacters A, A, D.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=1: A \u2192 tmp=1.\n\ni=2: A \u2192 tmp=2.\n\ni=3: D \u2192 cnt +=2 \u2192 cnt=2.\n\nSo output is 2. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables:\n\ns3 is declared as len=1000, but when building it, the loop uses pos to track the current position. The final length is pos-1.\n\nIn the loop over s3's characters, the loop is from 1 to pos-1, which is correct.\n\nThe code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the final Fortran code with proper declarations and structure.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, strings are null-terminated? No, in Fortran, the length is determined by the declared length, but when using len_trim, it's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, when we read input_str with read(*,'(A)') input_str, that reads the entire line, including spaces, up to the newline. The len_trim gives the actual length without trailing spaces.\n\nThe code should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part, the loop to find the last non-space and non-? character:\n\nThe loop starts from the end (i = len down to 1). For each i, check if the character is not a space or '?'. The first such character is stored as last_char.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
