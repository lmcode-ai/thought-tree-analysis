    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_379_A) takes two integers a and b from input. It calculates a result by repeatedly dividing a by b, adding the quotient to res, and updating a to be the quotient plus the remainder. The loop continues until a is less than b. The final res is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_58_B) takes an integer n, prints it, then checks for each number from n-1 down to 1 if it divides the current m (starting with n). If it does, it prints that number and updates m to be that number. So the output is a sequence of numbers starting with n, then the largest possible divisors in descending order until 1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's input is read from stdin, and its output is the res value. This res becomes the input for the second program. But since we can't have intermediate I/O, I need to compute the first part's result and pass it directly to the second part's processing without writing to a file or screen.\n\n2. The second program's output is the sequence of numbers. So the Fortran program should read the initial input (the two numbers a and b for the first part), compute the res, then use that res as the n for the second part, and then output the sequence as per the second program.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's input is two integers a and b. The second program's input is a single integer n. So the first program's output (res) is the input to the second program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part will read a and b, compute res, then the second part uses res as n, and outputs the required sequence.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read a and b from input.\n- Compute res as per the first Java program's logic.\n- Then, take res as n for the second part's processing.\n- Then, process the second part's logic using that n, and output the result as per the second Java program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part (codeforces_379_A):\n\nVariables: a and b are integers. The loop runs while a >= b. The res starts as a. Then each iteration adds a/b to res, and a becomes (a/b) + (a mod b). Wait, in Java, a is being updated each time. Let me see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nres = a;\nwhile (a >= b) {\n    res += (a / b);\n    a = (a / b) + (a % b);\n}\n\nSo in Fortran, variables can be declared as integers. Let me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize res = a. Then loop while a >= b:\n\nres = res + (a / b)\na = (a / b) + mod(a, b)\n\nWait, in Fortran, integer division is done with /, and mod is mod(a,b). So that's straightforward.\n\nSecond part (codeforces_58_B):\n\nThe second program takes n, then prints n followed by spaces and the sequence. Wait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); but that's a bit odd. Wait, in Java, the code for the second program is:\n\npublic class codeforces_58_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the first print is n followed by a space, but with a newline? Because System.out.println adds a newline. So the output is n followed by a space and a newline. Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, if m mod i is 0, print i followed by a space and a newline, then set m to i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is used as input to the next. So the first program's output is res, which is the number printed by the first Java program. The second program's input is that res. So the second program's first line is reading that res as n. So in the Fortran program, the second part's n is the res from the first part.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the second part's processing will take n (the res from first part), then process it as per the second Java code.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read a and b from input.\n\n2. Compute res as per first part's logic.\n\n3. Then, take res as n for the second part.\n\n4. Then, process the second part's logic, which is:\n\n   a. Print n followed by a space and a newline (but in Fortran, how to do that? The print statement in Fortran can be written as write(*,*) n, ' ' which would output n followed by a space, then a new line. Wait, but in the Java code, the first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which appends a space and then a newline. So the output is \"n \" followed by a newline. So in Fortran, the first write would be write(*, '(I0, A)'), n, ' ' followed by a new line? Or perhaps just write(*,*) n, ' ' which would output n followed by a space, then a new line. The exact formatting might not matter as long as the numbers are printed with spaces and newlines as per the original.\n\n   b. Then loop from i = n-1 down to 1, checking if m mod i ==0. If so, print i followed by a space and a newline, then set m =i.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (i = n-1; i>0; i--), and each time, if m%i ==0, then print i followed by a space and a newline, then set m =i.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize m =n.\n\nThen, do i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if mod(m, i) ==0 then\n\n      write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n\n      m =i\n\n   end if\n\nBut wait, the print statement in Java uses System.out.println, which adds a newline. So each print statement in Java outputs the number followed by a space and a newline. So in Fortran, each such print would need to output the number followed by a space and a new line. The format in Fortran can be handled with write statements.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the default write(*,*) will separate items with spaces and end with a new line. So for example, writing write(*,*) i would print the number followed by a new line. But the Java code's first print is n followed by a space and a new line. So perhaps the first print in Fortran should be write(*, '(I0, A)'), n, ' ' which would print n followed by a space, then a new line. Then the subsequent prints would be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's first print is actually a typo, but looking at the code:\n\nThe first print is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which would output the string \"n \" followed by a newline. So the output is n followed by a space and a newline. The next prints are similar. So in Fortran, each print statement for the second part should output the number followed by a space and a newline. So the format should be such that each number is printed with a space after, then a new line.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, the write statement with * will automatically add spaces between items and a new line. So for example, write(*,*) n, ' ' would print n followed by a space, then a new line. But the space is an extra character. Wait, but the Java code's first print is n followed by a space and then a new line. So the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's first print is a mistake, but according to the code given, that's what it does. So the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nSo the first write in the second part is:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\nThen, for each i that meets the condition, write the same: write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n\nBut in Fortran, the new line is added automatically after each write statement. So each write statement will output the number, a space, and then a new line. That matches the Java code's behavior.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program will have:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute res as per first part.\n\nThen, set n = res.\n\nThen, process the second part's logic with n.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's use integers for all variables.\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, b, res, n, m, i\n\n! Read a and b from input\n\nread*, a, b\n\n! Compute res as per first part\n\nres = a\n\ndo while (a >= b)\n\n    res = res + (a / b)\n\n    a = (a / b) + mod(a, b)\n\nend do\n\n! Now, set n to res for the second part\n\nn = res\n\n! Now process the second part\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\nm = n\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n    if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n\n        write(*, '(I0, A)') i, ' '\n\n        m = i\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop, the loop is from n-1 down to 1, stepping by -1. The do i = n-1, 1, -1 is correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop is written as do i = start, end, step. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, check the first part's loop:\n\nThe loop continues while a >= b. The variables a and b are being modified in the loop. Wait, in the first Java code, the original a is stored in res, but in the loop, the a is being updated each time. Wait, in the Java code, the original a is stored in res, but then the loop modifies a. So in the Fortran code, the variables a and b are the same as in the Java code. So the loop is modifying a each time. So the code is correct as written.\n\nWait, but in the first part's code, after initializing res = a, the loop runs while a >= b. Each iteration:\n\nres += a/b \u2192 res = res + (a/b)\n\na = (a/b) + (a mod b)\n\nYes, that's exactly what the code does. So the Fortran code correctly captures that.\n\nNow, testing edge cases. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the first program's input is a=10, b=2.\n\nFirst part:\n\nres starts at 10.\n\nLoop:\n\na is 10 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres += 5 \u2192 res becomes 15.\n\na becomes 5 + 0 (since 10 mod 2 is 0) \u2192 5.\n\nNow, a is 5 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres += 2 \u2192 17.\n\na becomes 2 +1 \u21923.\n\nNow a is 3 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=1 \u219218.\n\na becomes 1 +1 \u21922.\n\nNow a is 2 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=1 \u219219.\n\na becomes 1 +0 \u21921.\n\nNow a is 1 <2 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nSo res is 19. So the first program's output is 19.\n\nThen the second program takes n=19.\n\nSecond part:\n\nPrint 19 followed by space and newline.\n\nm is 19.\n\nThen loop from 18 down to 1:\n\nCheck if 19 mod 18 is 0? 19 mod 18 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\nNext i=17 \u2192 19 mod17 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\nContinue down to i=1.\n\nWait, but when i=1, m is 19. 19 mod1 is 0. So yes.\n\nSo print 1 followed by space and newline. Then m becomes 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n19 \n\n18 \n\n... (no, since none of the numbers between 18 and 2 divide 19 except 1.\n\nWait, the second program's output would be 19 followed by 1, but let's see:\n\nWait, the loop starts at 18, then 17, etc. until i=1.\n\nAt i=1, m is still 19. 19 mod1 is 0 \u2192 yes. So print 1 followed by space and newline. Then m becomes 1.\n\nSo the output lines are:\n\n19 \n\n1 \n\nWait, but the loop continues until i=1. So the first print is 19 followed by space and newline. Then, when i=1, it prints 1 followed by space and newline. So the total output is two lines: \"19 \" and \"1 \" each followed by a newline.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first print is n followed by a space and a newline. Then, for each i that meets the condition, it prints i followed by a space and a newline. So in this case, the output would be:\n\n19 \n\n1 \n\nEach on their own line with a trailing space. So the Fortran code would produce that.\n\nAnother test case: Let's take the second program's input as n=4.\n\nThen the second part's processing would be:\n\nPrint 4 followed by space and newline.\n\nm=4.\n\nThen check i=3: 4 mod3 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: 4 mod2 is 0 \u2192 yes. Print 2 followed by space and newline. m becomes 2.\n\ni=1: 2 mod1 is 0 \u2192 yes. Print 1 followed by space and newline. m becomes 1.\n\nSo the output lines are:\n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\nSo the Fortran code would do that.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are correctly handled. The first part's a is modified, but since in the first part, after computing res, the second part uses n = res, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the original a is modified. But since the first part's code is written correctly, that's okay. The variables a and b in the first part are the same as in the Java code, so the loop works as intended.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to make sure that in Fortran, the mod function is used correctly. In Fortran, mod(a, b) gives the remainder with the sign of the divisor. But since in the problem, a and b are positive integers (since they are input as integers, but the problem's context probably assumes they are positive?), so mod(a, b) is okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, the a is being updated each time. Let me see:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\na starts as the input a. Then in each iteration, a is set to (a / b) + (a % b). So in Fortran, a = (a / b) + mod(a, b). Since in Java, a / b is integer division, and mod is the remainder. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case for first part: a=5, b=2.\n\nInitial res=5.\n\nFirst iteration: a=5 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=5/2=2 \u2192 res=7.\n\na becomes 2 +1 (5 mod2 is1) \u21923.\n\nSecond iteration: a=3 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=1 \u21928.\n\na becomes 1 +1 \u21922.\n\nThird iteration: a=2 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=1 \u21929.\n\na becomes 1 +0 \u21921.\n\nNow a is 1 <2 \u2192 exit.\n\nTotal res is 9. So the first program outputs 9. Then the second part takes n=9.\n\nSecond part processing:\n\nPrint 9 followed by space and newline.\n\nm=9.\n\nLoop from 8 down to 1:\n\nCheck i=8: 9 mod8 is1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=7 \u2192 9 mod7=2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=6 \u2192 9 mod6=3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=5 \u2192 9 mod5=4 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4 \u2192 9 mod4=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3 \u21929 mod3=0 \u2192 yes. Print 3 followed by space and newline. m becomes3.\n\nThen i=2: 3 mod2=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1 \u21923 mod1=0 \u2192 yes. Print 1 followed by space and newline.\n\nSo the output lines are:\n\n9 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should work as intended."
