Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, let's see: For n=5, the first loop in Java is for i from 0 to 2 (since n/2 is 2). So first half is 0,1 (indices 0-1 in Java, which are first two characters). The second loop in Java is for i from 4 down to (2-1)=1. So i starts at 4 (Java index 4 is the fifth character), then 3, 2, 1. The condition is i>1. So when i=2, it's allowed (since 2>1 is true). So the second half includes indices 2,3,4 (Java indices), which are the third, fourth, fifth characters. So in Fortran, the second half should be indices 3,4,5 (since Fortran is 1-based). The start variable in Fortran is n - n/2 +1 \u2192 5-2+1=4. So the loop for sum2 would start at 4 and go to 5. That gives two characters, but the second half should be 3 characters (since n=5, n/2=2, so second half is 3 characters).",

So the flip is done only when there's a duplicate. Wait, the code in Java:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n   if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n\n   else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n\n   a1++;\n\n} So the flip is between 0 and 1, but only when the current and previous are the same. Thus, in Fortran, the code for a1 is:\n\na = second_input\n\na1 = 0 do i = 2, len_trim(a)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the b processing (a2):\n\nb is initialized to second_input. a2 =0\n\nloop from i = len_trim(b) down to 2:\n\n   if (b(i) == b(i-1)), then flip the previous character (i-1) between 0 and 1, and increment a2. Wait, in Java code for b:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--):\n\n   if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n       if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to '0', else '1'\n\n       a2++;\n\n   } So the code checks if current and previous are same.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_146_A) reads a number n and a string. It checks if all characters are '4' or '7'. If not, it outputs \"NO\". If they are, it calculates the sum of the first half and the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string and processes it in two ways. The first way (a1) changes consecutive duplicates by flipping the current character, counting the changes. The second way (a2) does similar but starts from the end, flipping the previous character when duplicates are found. Then it outputs the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first Java program's output is the input for the second. But since we can't have I/O in between, we need to process the first's output as an internal variable in Fortran and pass it to the second's logic.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the second program expects a string input. Wait, looking back: the second Java program's input is a string (from in.next()), which is the output of the first program? Wait no, the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the second program's input is a string, which would be the output of the first program? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (YES/NO) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (the input is read via in.next(), which is a string). So the first program's output is a string (either \"YES\" or \"NO\"), which becomes the input to the second program. But the second program's processing is on that string?\n\nWait, but looking at the second Java program's code, it's processing a string (x) which is the input. So the first program's output (YES/NO) is the input to the second program. The second program then processes that string (e.g., \"YES\" or \"NO\") and outputs the minimum of a1 and a2. But that seems odd. Wait, but the problem says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, so the first's output is the second's input. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the output of the first, which is either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is expecting a string that's being processed for consecutive characters. For example, if the first program outputs \"YES\", then the second program's input is \"YES\", which is a string of three characters. Then the second program would process that string. But the second program's code is designed for a string of 0s and 1s? Because in the code, it's flipping between '0' and '1'. Wait, looking at the second Java code:\n\nIn the second program, the input is read as a string x. Then in the loops, they check if characters are '1' or '0'? Because in the first part, when a character is same as previous, they flip it to '0' or '1'. So the input string must consist of '0's and '1's? But the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters, not 0/1. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the sequence. Let me re-examine the problem statement again. The user says that the Java programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are strings. The second program's input is a string (since in.next() is called). But the second program's code is designed to process a string of 0s and 1s. That would mean that the first program's output must be a string of 0s and 1s. But the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are not. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests that perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup.\n\nWait, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second. Wait, perhaps the first program's input is the original input, and the second program's input is the output of the first program. But the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is a string. The second program's input is that string, but the second program's code is expecting a string of 0s and 1s. That would not make sense. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second. Wait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's code is expecting a string that is a sequence of 0s and 1s. So the first program's output must be such a string. But the first program's code outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are not. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the first Java program.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program's code again. The first program's code:\n\nThe first program reads a number n and a string. Then checks if all characters are 4 or 7. If not, output \"NO\". Else, compute the sum of first half and second half. If equal, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the first program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program's input is that string. But the second program's code is designed to process a string of 0s and 1s. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is actually a string of 0s and 1s. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code again:\n\nWait, the first program's input is a string (the str variable). The code checks if all characters are '4' or '7'. Then, if that's true, it splits the string into two halves, sums the numeric values of the first half and the second half. The sum is the sum of the digits (since Character.getNumericValue('4') is 4, etc). If the two sums are equal, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are strings. The second program's input is that string. But the second program's code is designed to process a string of 0s and 1s. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided. Wait, the user provided two Java files. The first is codeforces_146_A, the second is atcoder_ABC124_C. The second program's code is for a problem where the input is a string of 0s and 1s. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the same as the first's input? But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. But that would require that the first's output is a string of 0s and 1s, which it isn't. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program's input is a string (the str variable). The code checks if all characters are 4 or 7. Then, if that's true, it splits the string into two halves. The first half is the first n/2 characters, the second half is the last n/2 (assuming n is even). The sum of the first half's digits and the second's. If equal, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program's input is that string. But the second program's code is expecting a string of 0s and 1s. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem's setup is different. Maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the same as the first's input? Or perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's input? That would make sense if the first program's output is just an intermediate step, but the second program needs the original input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. So there's a problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the actual string of digits. Wait, no, the code clearly outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the second program is not the one provided. Wait, looking at the second Java code:\n\nThe second program's code is from atcoder ABC124 C. The problem for that is probably about a string of 0s and 1s. So the input to the second program must be such a string. But the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are not. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the same as the first's input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is actually the string of digits, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me re-examine the first Java code again.\n\nWait, the first program's code:\n\nThe first program reads a number n and a string. Then, it checks if all characters are 4 or 7. If not, output \"NO\". Else, compute the sum of first half and second half. If equal, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the output is \"YES\" or \"NO\". The second program's input is that string. But the second program's code is designed to process a string of 0s and 1s. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem's setup is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the second program's input is the first program's input. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. So this is a problem. Unless the first program's output is actually the string of digits, but that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, maybe I need to proceed under the assumption that the first program's output is the input to the second, even if it's not compatible. But that would mean the second program would process \"YES\" or \"NO\" as the input string, which may not make sense. But perhaps the problem expects us to proceed regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the actual string of digits. Wait, no, the code clearly outputs those strings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is the sum of the two halves? No, the code outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to proceed with the given code and see how to translate them into a single Fortran program, even if there's a discrepancy in the input/output types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is the first program's input, not its output. But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next. So the first's output is the second's input. So the second program's input is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nIn that case, the second program would process that string. Let's see what the second program does. The second program's code:\n\nThe second program takes a string x. Then creates two copies (a and b). For a, it iterates from the second character to the end. If current character is same as previous, it flips it (to 0 if it was 1, or 1 if 0), and counts the changes (a1). For b, it starts from the end and goes backward, checking if the previous character (i-1) is same as current. If so, it flips the previous character and increments a2. Then outputs the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nSo if the input string is \"YES\", which is 'Y','E','S', then processing it would involve checking for consecutive duplicates. Since all characters are different, a1 and a2 would be 0, so the output is 0. But the second program's code is designed for 0/1 strings, but it can process any string. So perhaps the problem is okay.\n\nSo the first program's output is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which is the input to the second program. The second program processes that string and outputs the minimum of a1 and a2. So the final output of the entire sequence is that number.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input (the original input to the first Java program), process it through the first program's logic, then pass the result to the second program's logic, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input (n and the string) from stdin.\n\n2. Process the first Java program's logic: check if all characters are 4 or 7. If not, output \"NO\" (then the second program would process \"NO\" and output the min of a1 and a2). Else compute the two sums and output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n3. Then, take that result string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") and process it through the second program's logic, which will compute the min of a1 and a2, and output that number.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all of this in sequence, without any intermediate I/O.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (first Java program):\n\nRead n and the string. Check each character is '4' or '7'. If any is not, then the first output is \"NO\".\n\nElse, compute the sum of first half and second half. If equal, first output is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThen, take that string (\"YES\" or \"NO\") and process it through the second program's logic.\n\nThe second part (second Java program):\n\nTake the string (from first's output), process it as per the second's code.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nRead n and the string (from stdin).\n\nProcess first part:\n\n- Check all characters are '4' or '7'. If not, set first_result to \"NO\".\n\nElse:\n\n- Compute sum of first half (sum1) and second half (sum2). If sum1 == sum2, first_result is \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nThen, process the first_result string through the second part's logic.\n\nSecond part's processing:\n\nTake the first_result string (e.g., \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nProcess it as the input string for the second program's logic.\n\nCompute a1 and a2 as per the second Java code.\n\nOutput the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran code.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see.\n\nFirst, read n and the string. The string can be read as a character array.\n\nThen, check each character in the string is '4' or '7'.\n\nIf any is not, then first_result is \"NO\".\n\nElse, compute the sum of first half and second half.\n\nWait, the first half is the first n/2 characters, and the second half is the last n/2 (assuming n is even). Wait, the original code in Java does:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) { sum first part }\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i > (n/2)-1; i--) { sum second part }\n\nWait, the second loop starts from the end and goes down to (n/2)th index (since (n/2)-1 is the index before the middle). So for n even, the second half is from n/2 to n-1. For n odd, the middle character is not included in either sum? Because n/2 is integer division. For example, if n is 5, n/2 is 2. So first loop runs 0,1 (sum first 2), second loop starts at 4,3,2 (since (n/2)-1 is 1, so i >1. So i=4,3,2. So the second half is indices 2,3,4? Wait, that would be 3 elements. Hmm, but the original code may have a problem with odd lengths, but the problem may assume n is even. But in any case, the code as written in Java does that.\n\nIn Fortran, we can do similar.\n\nOnce the first_result is determined, then process it through the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe input string is first_result (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nWe need to process this string as per the second Java code.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\nInitialize a and b as copies of the input string.\n\nFor a:\n\nLoop from i=2 to length (since in Java, indices start at 0, so in Fortran, assuming 1-based, the loop would be from 2 to len).\n\nCheck if current character is same as previous. If so, flip it (0 <->1) and increment a1.\n\nWait, but the input string here is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters. So when processing, the code would check for consecutive duplicates. For example, \"YES\" has Y, E, S: all different, so a1 is 0. \"NO\" has N and O, so also 0. So the output would be 0.\n\nBut the second program's code is designed for 0/1 strings, but it can process any string. So the code is okay.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the second part:\n\nTake the first_result string (e.g., \"YES\").\n\nCompute a1 and a2 as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead n and the string. Let's say the string is stored in a character array of length n.\n\nThen process first part.\n\nThen process second part.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst part:\n\nRead n and the string.\n\nCheck all characters are '4' or '7'.\n\nIf not, first_result is \"NO\".\n\nElse:\n\nCompute sum1 and sum2.\n\nsum1 is sum of first n/2 characters (converted to integers).\n\nsum2 is sum of last n/2 characters (converted to integers).\n\nWait, in Java, the first loop is for i from 0 to n/2 -1 (since i < n/2). The second loop is for i from n-1 down to (n/2)th index (since (n/2)-1 is the upper limit for i> that).\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) { add to x }\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > (n / 2) - 1; i--) { add to y }\n\nSo for n even, the first half is 0 to (n/2 -1), and the second half is n/2 to n-1. So the second loop starts at n-1 and goes down to n/2 (since (n/2)-1 is the upper limit for i> that).\n\nThus, the second half is from n/2 to n-1.\n\nThus, in Fortran, for the first part:\n\nsum1 = sum of characters 1 to n/2 (since Fortran is 1-based).\n\nsum2 = sum of characters (n - n/2 +1) to n ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose n is 4. Then n/2 is 2. The first half is indices 1-2, the second half 3-4.\n\nYes. So for the second loop in Java, the indices are 3,2 (since n-1 is 3, and (n/2)-1 is 1, so i>1. So i starts at 3, then 2, then stops when i is 1 (since 2>1 is true, but 1>1 is false).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (i = n-1; i > (n/2)-1; i--). So for n=4, (n/2)-1 is 1. So i starts at 3, then 2, then 1. But the condition is i>1, so when i=2, it's okay, but when i=1, the loop stops. So the loop runs for i=3 and 2. So the second half is indices 2 and 3? Wait, no, the indices in Java are 0-based. So for n=4, the indices are 0,1,2,3. The second loop starts at 3 (n-1), and runs while i> (n/2 -1) which is 1 (since n/2 is 2, minus 1 is 1). So i must be >1. So i=3 and 2 (since 2>1 is true, but 1 is not). So the indices are 3 and 2 (Java indices), which correspond to the last two characters (since n=4, the second half is indices 2 and 3 (Java) which are the third and fourth characters in 1-based).\n\nThus, in Fortran, the second half is from (n/2 +1) to n (since 1-based). Wait, for n=4, n/2 is 2, so the second half starts at 3 (1-based) to 4.\n\nThus, the sum2 is the sum of characters from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the second loop is adding the numeric value of l[i], which for the indices 3 and 2 (Java) would be the last two characters. So in Fortran, the second half is the last n/2 characters.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nsum1 = sum of first n/2 characters (indices 1 to n/2).\n\nsum2 = sum of last n/2 characters (indices (n - n/2 +1) to n).\n\nWait, for n=4, n/2 is 2, so (n - n/2 +1) is 3, so indices 3-4.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nsum1 = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n/2\n\n   sum1 = sum1 + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')  ! since '4' is 52 in ASCII, subtract '0' (48) to get 4.\n\nend do\n\nsum2 = 0\n\ndo i = (n - n/2 +1), n\n\n   sum2 = sum2 + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays. Let me think of variables.\n\nLet me plan variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_str  ! assuming max length is 1000.\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: first_result  ! \"YES\" or \"NO\" (max 4 characters)\n\nThen, after processing first part, first_result is set.\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: second_input = first_result\n\ninteger :: a1, a2, min_val\n\nThen process second_input through the second's logic.\n\nNow, the second part's processing:\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is the string (second_input).\n\nWe need to create two copies (a and b), process them as per the loops.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be manipulated with character arrays.\n\nAlternatively, we can use character variables and loop through each character.\n\nLet me think of the steps for the second part.\n\nProcessing a (a1):\n\nInitialize a as the input string.\n\nLoop from i=2 to len(second_input):\n\n   if a(i) == a(i-1), then flip it (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nWait, but the input string here is \"YES\" or \"NO\", which are letters. So the code would check for consecutive letters. For example, \"YES\" has Y, E, S: no duplicates, so a1 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly, \"NO\" has N and O: no duplicates, so a1 is 0.\n\nThus, the code would process the characters as they are, even if they are not 0/1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, get the length of the input string (len_trim(second_input)).\n\nThen, for a:\n\na is a character array of length len_trim(second_input).\n\na = second_input\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(second_input)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       ! flip the current character between 0 and 1?\n\n       ! Wait, in the Java code, when the current character is same as previous, it flips the current character.\n\n       ! For example, if it was '1', set to '0', else '1'.\n\n       ! But in the input string, the characters may not be 0/1. So the code would flip between 0 and 1 regardless?\n\n       ! Wait, in the Java code:\n\n       if (a.charAt(i) == '1') then set to '0', else set to '1'.\n\n       So regardless of what it was, it's flipped between 0 and 1.\n\n       So in Fortran:\n\n       if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the original code in Java does this only when the current character is same as previous. So the flip is done only when there's a duplicate.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n   if (a.charAt(i) == '1') a.setCharAt(i, '0');\n\n   else a.setCharAt(i, '1');\n\n   a1++;\n\n}\n\nSo the flip is between 0 and 1, but only when the current and previous are the same.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the code for a1 is:\n\na = second_input\n\na1 = 0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(a)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n           a(i:i) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           a(i:i) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for the b processing (a2):\n\nb is initialized to second_input.\n\na2 =0\n\nloop from i = len_trim(b) down to 2:\n\n   if (b(i) == b(i-1)), then flip the previous character (i-1) between 0 and 1, and increment a2.\n\nWait, in Java code for b:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--):\n\n   if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n       if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') set to '0', else '1'\n\n       a2++;\n\n   }\n\nSo the code checks if current and previous are same. If so, it flips the previous character (i-1) and increments a2.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nb = second_input\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(b), 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n       if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n       else\n\n           b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n       end if\n\n       a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the minimum of a1 and a2 is printed.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program steps:\n\n1. Read n and the input string.\n\n   Read *, n, input_str\n\n   But in Fortran, reading a string with a number may require using list-directed input. Alternatively, read the entire line.\n\n   Wait, the first Java program reads n as nextInt(), then the string as next(). So the input is like:\n\n   For example, input line would be \"5 44444\" (n=5, string is \"44444\").\n\n   So in Fortran, to read n and the string, perhaps:\n\n   read(*,*) n, input_str\n\n   But if the string has spaces, but in the problem, the string is a single token (since in Java it's in.next()), so the input_str would be read correctly.\n\n   However, in Fortran, if the string contains spaces, this may not work. But assuming the input is as per the problem's first Java program, which reads a single string (without spaces), this should be okay.\n\n2. Check all characters in input_str are '4' or '7'.\n\n   Initialize a flag (t) as 0.\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n       if (input_str(i:i) /= '4' .and. input_str(i:i) /= '7') then\n\n           t = 1\n\n           exit\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (t ==1) then\n\n       first_result = 'NO'\n\n   else\n\n       compute sum1 and sum2.\n\n       compute sum1 as sum of first n/2 characters.\n\n       compute sum2 as sum of last n/2 characters.\n\n       if (sum1 == sum2) then\n\n           first_result = 'YES'\n\n       else\n\n           first_result = 'NO'\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\n3. Now process first_result through the second part.\n\n   second_input = first_result\n\n   process a and a1.\n\n   process b and a2.\n\n   min_val = min(a1, a2)\n\n   print *, min_val\n\nNow, handling the sum1 and sum2:\n\nsum1 = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n/2\n\n   c = input_str(i:i)\n\n   sum1 = sum1 + ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nsum2 =0\n\nstart = n - n/2 +1\n\ndo i = start, n\n\n   c = input_str(i:i)\n\n   sum2 = sum2 + ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, for n even, start is n/2 +1. For example, n=4: start =4-2+1=3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with /, so n/2 is integer division.\n\nThus, the code for sum1 and sum2 is okay.\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, t, sum1, sum2, a1, a2, min_val\n\n    character(len=1000) :: input_str\n\n    character(len=4) :: first_result\n\n    character(len=4) :: second_input\n\n    !

Output the minimum\n\n    min_val = min(a1, a2)\n\n    print *, min_val\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the code for processing 'a', the loop is from 2 to len_trim(a). The variable a is initialized as second_input, which is first_result (either 'YES' or 'NO'). The length of 'YES' is 3, so the loop runs i=2 and 3.\n\nFor 'YES':\n\ni=2: check a(2) and a(1). 'E' vs 'Y' \u2192 no change.\n\ni=3: 'S' vs 'E' \u2192 no change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nSimilarly for 'NO' (length 2):\n\ni=2: 'O' vs 'N' \u2192 no change. a1 is 0.\n\nThus, the a1 and a2 would both be 0, so min is 0.\n\nBut let's see the code for 'b' processing.\n\nFor 'YES':\n\nProcessing b (initialized to 'YES'):\n\nLoop from i=3 down to 2.\n\ni=3:\n\nCheck b(3) and b(2). 'S' vs 'E' \u2192 no.\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck b(2) and b(1). 'E' vs 'Y' \u2192 no.\n\nThus, a2 is 0.\n\nThus, the output is 0.\n\nSimilarly for 'NO', the a2 is 0.\n\nThus, the code would output 0 in both cases.\n\nWait, but what if the first program outputs 'YES', then the second program's input is 'YES', which has no consecutive duplicates, so the output is 0.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is 'NO', then the second program's input is 'NO', which also has no duplicates, so output is 0.\n\nThus, the final output is 0 in all cases where the first program's output is 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 'YES' (length 3), then the second program's processing would have a1 and a2 as 0, so min is 0.\n\nBut what if the first program's output is 'NO' (length 2), then the same.\n\nThus, the final output is 0 in all cases where the first program's output is 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 'YES', but the second program's processing is different?\n\nWait, the code for the second part is correct as per the Java code.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors.\n\nIn the first part, when calculating the second half's start:\n\nstart = n - n/2 +1\n\nWait, for n=5 (odd):\n\nn/2 is 2 (since integer division). So start =5-2+1=4. The second half is indices 4 and 5 (since n/2 is 2, so first half is 1-2, second half is 3-5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for n=5, the first half is 2 characters (n/2=2), so first half is indices 1-2. The second half is 3 characters (5-2=3). The start is 5-2+1=4? Wait, that would be 4, so indices 4-5 (only 2 characters). Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=5, the first loop in Java is for i from 0 to 2 (since n/2 is 2). So first half is 0,1 (indices 0-1 in Java, which are first two characters). The second loop in Java is for i from 4 down to (2-1)=1. So i starts at 4 (Java index 4 is the fifth character), then 3, 2, 1. The condition is i>1. So when i=2, it's allowed (since 2>1 is true). So the second half includes indices 2,3,4 (Java indices), which are the third, fourth, fifth characters. So in Fortran, the second half should be indices 3,4,5 (since Fortran is 1-based).\n\nThe start variable in Fortran is n - n/2 +1 \u2192 5-2+1=4. So the loop for sum2 would start at 4 and go to 5. That gives two characters, but the second half should be 3 characters (since n=5, n/2=2, so second half is 3 characters). Thus, the code is incorrect for odd n.\n\nAh, here's a mistake. The calculation of start is wrong for odd n.\n\nThe correct start for the second half should be (n/2)+1.\n\nWait, for n=5, n/2 is 2 (integer division). So (n/2)+1 =3. Thus, the second half starts at 3 and goes to 5 (3 characters).\n\nThus, the correct start is (n/2)+1.\n\nWait, in the first part's code:\n\nsum2 is the sum of the last n/2 characters? Or the second half?\n\nWait, the first part's code in Java:\n\nThe first loop sums the first n/2 characters (indices 0 to n/2-1 in Java).\n\nThe second loop sums the last n - (n/2) characters (since n - (n/2) is the length of the second half).\n\nThus, for n=5, the second half has 3 characters (5-2=3). So the start in Fortran should be (n - (n/2)) +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe second half starts at (n/2)+1 and ends at n.\n\nThus, the start variable should be (n/2)+1.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nstart = (n/2) +1\n\nThus, for n=5, start is 3, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code for sum2 should be:\n\nstart = (n/2) +1\n\ndo i = start, n\n\n   sum2 = sum2 + ...\n\nend do\n\nThus, the previous code had an error here. Need to correct that.\n\nSo in the first part's code:\n\nsum1 is sum of first n/2 characters (indices 1 to n/2).\n\nsum2 is sum of characters from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nstart = (n/2) +1\n\ndo i = start, n\n\n   sum2 += ...\n\nend do\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the start variable should be computed as (n/2)+1.\n\nSo correcting that part:\n\nIn the first part's code:\n\nsum1 =0\n\ndo i=1, n/2\n\n   sum1 += ...\n\nend do\n\nsum2 =0\n\nstart = (n/2)+1\n\ndo i=start, n\n\n   sum2 += ...\n\nend do\n\nThus, the code for the first part's sum2 is corrected.\n\nNow, the corrected code for the first part:\n\n    else\n\n        sum1 = 0\n\n        sum2 = 0\n\n        do i = 1, n/2\n\n            sum1 = sum1 + ichar(input_str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n        end do\n\n        start = (n/2) +1\n\n        do i = start, n\n\n            sum2 = sum2 + ichar(input_str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n        end do\n\n        if (sum1 == sum2) then\n\n            first_result = 'YES'\n\n        else\n\n            first_result = 'NO'\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nThis should fix the problem with odd n.\n\nNow, the rest of the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part's processing of 'a' and 'b', the variables a and b are declared as character(len=len_trim(second_input)), but in Fortran, when you assign a = second_input, the length is okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you have a character variable with a fixed length, you can assign a string of shorter length, but trailing spaces may be added. However, since we are using len_trim, it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character array with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, since the first_result is either 'YES' (3) or 'NO' (2), the length is up to 3 or 2. So declaring a and b as length 4 would be sufficient.\n\nThus, changing the declarations:\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: a, b\n\nThen:\n\na = second_input\n\nb = second_input\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\n    ! Process second part\n\n    second_input = first_result\n\n    ! Process a for a1\n\n    character(len=4) :: a, b\n\n    a = second_input\n\n    a1 = 0\n\n    do i = 2, len_trim(a)\n\n        if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n            if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n                a(i:i) = '0'\n\n            else\n\n                a(i:i) = '1'\n\n            end if\n\n            a1 = a1 +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Process b for a2\n\n    b = second_input\n\n    a2 =0\n\n    do i = len_trim(b), 2, -1\n\n        if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n            if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n            else\n\n                b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n            end if\n\n            a2 = a2 +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nThis should handle the lengths properly.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should be as follows."
