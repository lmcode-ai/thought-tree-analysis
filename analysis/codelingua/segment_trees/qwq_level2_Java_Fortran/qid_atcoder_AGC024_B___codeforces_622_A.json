    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they connect.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC024_B). It reads an integer N, then an array P of N integers. The elements of P are adjusted by subtracting 1. Then it creates a map to store the indices of each element in P. Next, it checks for \"ng\" elements where the next element's index in the original array is smaller than the current one. These are stored in a list. If there are no such elements, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of certain values based on the positions of the first and last elements in the ng list, and between consecutive elements. The final answer is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_622_A) takes a long integer position, finds the nearest sequence start index, and calculates the result based on that. The getValueAtIndex function computes a value based on the index. The solve function uses a loop to find the correct index and then outputs the position's rank in that sequence.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these two into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input for the second. But since we can't have I/O in between, the first program's output must be passed as a variable to the second's logic in Fortran.\n\nWait, but in the original setup, the first Java program's output is the input for the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then read by the second as its input. So in the Fortran program, the first part's result (the ans from the first Java program) must be used as the input to the second part's calculation.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (N and P array).\n2. Process the first part (compute ans).\n3. Use that ans as the input to the second part's calculation (the position variable in the second Java program).\n4. Output the result of the second part.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read N and the array P (as integers).\n- Compute the ans as per the first Java program's logic.\n- Then, take that ans as the 'position' variable for the second part.\n- Compute the result of the second part using that position.\n- Finally, print the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program):\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- N is an integer.\n- P is an array of N integers. In Java, they subtract 1 from each input, so in Fortran, when reading, we can do P(i) = input - 1.\n\nThe map in Java is a HashMap that maps the value of P[i] to its index i. Since in Fortran arrays are 1-based, but in Java they are 0-based. Wait, in the Java code, the array P is 0-based (since they subtract 1 from the input, which is probably 1-based in the problem's input). Wait, the problem's input for P is probably given as 1-based, but in Java they store as 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays, but adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, in the first Java code:\n\nThe input is read as scan.nextInt() for each P[i], then subtract 1. So the original input is 1-based, and stored as 0-based in P. So in Fortran, perhaps we can read the numbers as is, then subtract 1 to get the 0-based indices. But Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so maybe we can adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound. Let me think. Let's see:\n\nIn the first Java code, the array P is of size N, and for each i from 0 to N-1, P[i] is the input value minus 1. So the values in P are 0-based. The map is then storing the value (which is 0-based) to the index (0-based). \n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use arrays starting at 1, but adjust the indices. Alternatively, use 0-based arrays. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can have an array P of size N, with indices 1 to N. The values stored in P are the input values minus 1 (so 0-based). The map can be represented as an array where for each value v (0-based), the index in P where it is found. Since the values in P are unique (since it's a permutation?), the map can be an array of size N, where map(v) = i (the position in P where v is stored). \n\nWait, in Java, the map is created by putting P[i] as the key and i as the value. Since P is a permutation of 0..N-1 (since each element is input as the original number minus 1, and assuming the input is a permutation of 1..N), then each key in the map is unique. So in Fortran, we can have an array called map of size N (since the maximum key is N-1, so indices 0 to N-1, but in Fortran arrays start at 1, so maybe 1 to N). Wait, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays here.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of Fortran arrays. Let me restate the variables:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- N is an integer.\n- P is an array of integers, size N. The elements are the input values minus 1 (so 0-based).\n- The map array: since the keys in the Java map are the values of P (0-based), which range from 0 to N-1. So in Fortran, we can have an array map(0:N-1) (but Fortran arrays can't have 0 as a lower bound unless specified). Alternatively, use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices. Hmm, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays and adjust the values accordingly. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can declare the map array as (1:N), and since the values in P are 0-based, but in Fortran, the indices start at 1, so perhaps we need to shift. Wait, maybe it's better to use 0-based arrays here. To do that, in Fortran, we can declare the array with a lower bound of 0. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: map\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based, so we have to specify the lower bound. So when declaring variables, we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work with 1-based arrays and adjust the values. Let me think through the steps again.\n\nThe first part's steps:\n\n1. Read N, then N integers into P array (each P(i) = input -1, so 0-based).\n\n2. Create a map where for each value v in P (0-based), map(v) = the index (1-based?) Wait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, if P is 1-based, then the index i (from 1 to N) corresponds to the Java's i-1. So when building the map, for each i from 1 to N, map(P(i)) = i (since in Java, the key is P[i], which is 0-based, and the value is the index (0-based). Wait, in Java, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) map.put(P[i], i);\n\nSo in Fortran, if P is 1-based (indices 1 to N), then the value P(i) is 0-based (since it's input minus 1). So the key in the map is P(i), which ranges from 0 to N-1. The value stored is the index (i in Fortran is 1-based, but in Java it was 0-based). Wait, in Java, the index is i (0-based), so in Fortran, the index is i (1-based) minus 1. So the value stored in the map for key P(i) is (i-1). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of an example. Suppose N=3, and the input P values (after subtracting 1) are [1,0,2]. Then in Java, the map would have entries:\n\n1 \u2192 0 (since P[0] is 1, index 0)\n\n0 \u2192 1 (P[1] is 0, index 1)\n\n2 \u2192 2 (P[2] is 2, index 2)\n\nIn Fortran, if P is 1-based, then P(1)=1, P(2)=0, P(3)=2. The indices in Fortran are 1,2,3. So the map for key 1 would be 1 (since in Java it was 0, but in Fortran's index is 1, so the stored value would be 1-1=0? Or maybe the stored value is the Fortran index minus 1. So in the map array, for key P(i), the value is (i-1). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the map array (which is 0-based in keys) can be declared as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: map\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nmap(P(i)) = i-1\n\nBecause in Java, the index was 0-based, so the stored value is i-1 (since Fortran's i is 1-based).\n\nThen, the next step is to find the nglist. The nglist is a list of indices i (0-based in Java) where map.get(i) > map.get(i+1). \n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to N-2 (since N-1 is the last index, so i+1 is up to N-1). For each i, check if the index of i in the array (map.get(i)) is greater than the index of i+1 (map.get(i+1)). \n\nIn Fortran terms, since the keys in the map are 0-based, the loop would be over i from 0 to N-2 (since in Java it's N-1 elements). Wait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i). So N-1 iterations, i from 0 to N-2. \n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be a loop from i = 0 to N-2 (but since in Fortran arrays can be 0-based, but need to declare that). \n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, the variables are easier to handle with 1-based arrays, but the keys here are 0-based. Hmm, maybe it's better to use 0-based arrays here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nglist can be stored as a list of integers (the i's in 0-based terms). In Fortran, since we can't have dynamic arrays easily, but since the maximum possible size of nglist is N-1, we can preallocate an array of size N, and track the count. \n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nglist\n\nallocate(nglist(0:N-2))  ! Not sure, but perhaps better to preallocate a large enough array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated. Let me think of the steps again.\n\nFirst, after building the map array, we need to loop over i from 0 to N-2 (Java's i from 0 to N-2), and check if map(i) > map(i+1). If so, add i to the nglist. \n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 0, N-2\n\n   if (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n      ... add to nglist ...\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut since in Fortran arrays start at 1 by default, unless specified, we need to make sure that the map array is 0-based. So when declaring map, we can do:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: map\n\nSimilarly, the nglist can be an array of integers, with a counter for the number of elements. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: ng_count = 0\n\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: nglist  ! Since maximum possible elements is N-1 (if all adjacent pairs are bad)\n\nThen, during the loop:\n\nif (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n   ng_count = ng_count +1\n\n   nglist(ng_count) = i\n\nend if\n\nWait, but arrays in Fortran are 1-based by default. So perhaps better to use 1-based indices for nglist. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let's use 1-based arrays for nglist. So:\n\ninteger :: ng_count =0\n\ninteger, dimension(N) :: nglist  ! Since maximum elements is N-1, so N is enough.\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nif (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n   ng_count = ng_count +1\n\n   nglist(ng_count) = i  ! storing the 0-based i.\n\nend if\n\nThen, after the loop, if ng_count is zero, output 0 and proceed.\n\nElse, compute the ans as per the Java code.\n\nThe ans is the minimum between (N - nglist(1) -1) and (nglist(ng_count) +1). Wait, in Java:\n\nans = Math.min(N - nglist.get(0) -1, nglist.get(nglist.size()-1)+1);\n\nWait, the first term is N - first element (0-based) -1? Let me see:\n\nIn Java, the first element is nglist.get(0), which is the first i (0-based) where the condition holds. The term N - (i) -1? Wait, N is the total elements. The first element is the first bad index. The first term is N - (nglist.get(0)) -1? Wait, the first term is N - (nglist.get(0) +1) ?\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nJava code:\n\nans = Math.min(N - nglist.get(0) - 1, nglist.get(nglist.size() - 1) + 1);\n\nWait, N - nglist.get(0) -1 is the distance from the first bad element to the end? Or perhaps the first term is the number of elements from the first bad element to the end? Not sure, but in Fortran, the same calculation can be done.\n\nThen, for the loop over the nglist elements (from 0 to ng_count-2?), the Java code loops from i=0 to nglist.size()-2, and for each i, compares the current ans with (nglist.get(i)+1 + N - nglist.get(i+1) -1). \n\nWait, in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < nglist.size() - 1; ++i) {\n\n    ans = Math.min(nglist.get(i) + 1 + N - nglist.get(i+1) -1, ans);\n\n}\n\nSo the term is (i+1) + (N - (i+1) -1) ? Wait, the term is (nglist.get(i)+1) + (N - nglist.get(i+1) -1). \n\nWait, the term is (current element's i +1) plus (N - next element's i -1). \n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be over i from 1 to ng_count-1 (since nglist is 1-based here). Wait, if nglist is 1-based, then the first element is nglist(1) = the first i (0-based from Java). \n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nIn the Fortran code, the nglist array is 1-based, and ng_count is the number of elements. So the elements are stored in nglist(1) to nglist(ng_count). \n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, ng_count -1\n\n   current = nglist(i)\n\n   next = nglist(i+1)\n\n   temp = (current +1) + (N - next -1)\n\n   if (temp < ans) then\n\n      ans = temp\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the initial ans is the minimum between the first and last terms. \n\nSo putting it all together, the first part's logic can be translated into Fortran with careful handling of indices.\n\nOnce the ans is computed, that becomes the 'position' variable for the second part.\n\nNow, the second part (codeforces_622_A):\n\nThe second Java program takes a long 'position' and computes the result based on that. The key functions are getValueAtIndex and the solve function.\n\nThe getValueAtIndex function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2. \n\nThe solve function starts with nrstSeqStartIndx =1, and loops while getValue(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position. Then, it increments until the next value exceeds position. Then, the start index is getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx), and the result is (position - start) +1.\n\nIn Fortran, the variables can be integers or integers of larger size. Since the position can be up to 1e18 (assuming from the problem constraints), we need to use 64-bit integers. In Fortran, that's integer(8) or selected_int_kind(18).\n\nSo, in Fortran, the variables for the second part would be:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, ans2\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex can be written as a function:\n\ninteger(8) function getValue(index)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n   getValue = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\nend function\n\nThen, the solve part:\n\nposition = ans  ! from first part's result\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n\ndo while (getValue(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\nend do\n\ndo while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nans2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nThen, print ans2.\n\nPutting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nNow, the steps for the Fortran program:\n\n1. Read N and the array P (as integers).\n\n2. Process the first part to compute ans.\n\n3. Use ans as the position for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's result and print it.\n\nNow, handling the first part's variables:\n\nIn Fortran, the variables:\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: P\n\ninteger, dimension(0:) :: map  ! Need to declare with allocatable?\n\nWait, since N is read first, we can allocate arrays after reading N.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nAllocate P(1:N).\n\nRead N integers into P, then subtract 1 from each (since in Java they do P[i] = scan.nextInt() -1).\n\nThen, allocate map(0:N-1).\n\nLoop over i=1 to N:\n\nmap(P(i)) = i-1  ! since in Java, the index is 0-based (i-1 in Fortran's 1-based)\n\nThen, process the nglist.\n\nAllocate nglist array with enough size. Let's say allocate(nglist(0:N-1)), but since the maximum elements are N-1, perhaps better to use a dynamic array.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, we can have a fixed size array. Let's use:\n\ninteger, dimension(N) :: nglist  ! since maximum elements is N-1, so N is enough.\n\ninteger :: ng_count =0\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to N-2 (since in Java it's N-1 elements):\n\ndo i =0, N-2\n\n   if (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n      ng_count = ng_count +1\n\n      nglist(ng_count) = i  ! storing the 0-based i.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nIf ng_count ==0, then ans is 0, so proceed to second part with position=0?\n\nWait, in the first Java code, if nglist is empty, it prints 0 and returns. So in that case, the second part would take 0 as input. But the second Java program's solve function would process that. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So if the first outputs 0, then the second program reads that 0 as its input. So in the combined program, when the first part's ans is 0, the second part's position is 0, and the second part's code will process that.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, after computing ans, we set position = ans, then proceed.\n\nNow, if ng_count is zero, then ans is 0, so position is 0.\n\nElse, compute ans as per the Java code.\n\nSo:\n\nif (ng_count ==0) then\n\n   ans =0\n\nelse\n\n   ans = min( (N - nglist(1) -1), (nglist(ng_count) +1) )\n\n   do i=1, ng_count-1\n\n      current = nglist(i)\n\n      next = nglist(i+1)\n\n      temp = (current +1) + (N - next -1)\n\n      if (temp < ans) then\n\n         ans = temp\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nWait, the initial ans is the minimum between the first and last terms. Then, loop over the other pairs.\n\nWait, in Java, the initial ans is set to the minimum of the first and last terms, then the loop updates it with the minimum between the current ans and the new term.\n\nIn Fortran, the initial ans is set to the minimum of those two terms, then the loop checks each pair and updates ans if the new term is smaller.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nOnce ans is computed, set position = ans.\n\nThen, proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, the second part's variables:\n\nWe need to compute the result based on position.\n\nImplementing the second part's logic.\n\nFirst, the function getValue:\n\ninteger(8) function getValue(index)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n   getValue = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can be written inside the program, but perhaps better to use a function.\n\nAlternatively, inline the calculation.\n\nBut for clarity, let's define the function.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, ans2\n\nposition = ans  ! ans is an integer, but in the second part, it's treated as a long (64-bit). So in Fortran, we can cast it to integer(8).\n\nWait, in the first part, ans is an integer (since N is up to maybe 1e5?), but in the second part, the position can be up to very large numbers. Wait, but in the first part, the ans is computed as the minimum of certain terms, which are up to N. So if N is up to 1e5, then ans is up to 1e5, which fits in a 32-bit integer. But in the second part, the code expects a long (64-bit). So in Fortran, we can just cast it to integer(8).\n\nSo:\n\nposition = ans\n\nThen, initialize nrstSeqStartIndx =1 (as integer(8)).\n\nThen the loops:\n\ndo while (getValue(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\n\nend do\n\nThen:\n\ndo while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n\nend do\n\nThen compute startIndex = getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nans2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nFinally, print ans2.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling the input and output:\n\nThe first part reads N and the array P. The second part doesn't read anything, as the input is the first part's output.\n\nIn Fortran, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, ans, ng_count\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: P\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: map\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nglist\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, ans2\n\n! First part\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nallocate(P(1:N))\nallocate(map(0:N-1))\nallocate(nglist(0:N))  ! Maybe better to use 1-based here. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, earlier I considered nglist as 1-based. Let me adjust variables.\n\nWait, let me re-define variables properly.\n\nLet me re-define variables with 1-based arrays where possible.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use 1-based for P and map.\n\nWait, let me re-define variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: N, i, ans, ng_count\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: P  ! 1-based, size N\ninteger, dimension(0:N-1) :: map  ! 0-based keys, stored as 0 to N-1. But in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bound 0.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, to have a 0-based array, we need to specify the lower bound.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(map(0:N-1))\n\nSimilarly, nglist can be a 1-based array with ng_count elements.\n\nWait, let me try to restructure:\n\nFirst part steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nAllocate P(1:N).\n\nRead N integers into P, then subtract 1 from each (since in Java they do P[i] = input -1).\n\nThen, allocate map(0:N-1).\n\nLoop over i from 1 to N:\n\nmap(P(i)) = i-1  ! since in Java, the index is 0-based (i-1 in Fortran's 1-based)\n\nThen, initialize ng_count to 0 and allocate nglist with enough space. Let's use a dynamic array for nglist.\n\nallocate(nglist(N))  ! since maximum elements is N-1.\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to N-2 (since in Java, i runs from 0 to N-2):\n\ndo i =0, N-2\n\n   if (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n      ng_count = ng_count +1\n\n      nglist(ng_count) = i  ! storing the 0-based i.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, if ng_count ==0, set ans=0.\n\nElse:\n\nans = min( (N - nglist(1) -1), (nglist(ng_count) +1) )\n\nthen loop over i from 1 to ng_count-1:\n\ndo i=1, ng_count-1\n\n   current = nglist(i)\n\n   next = nglist(i+1)\n\n   temp = (current +1) + (N - next -1)\n\n   if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n\nend do\n\nThen, proceed to second part.\n\nNow, the second part variables:\n\nposition = ans\n\nBut since ans is an integer (32-bit), but position is 64-bit, we can cast it:\n\nposition = int(ans, 8)\n\nThen, the rest as before.\n\nNow, the function getValue:\n\ninteger(8) function getValue(index)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n   getValue = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\nend function\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be inside the program.

So that's okay.\n\n- The map array is 0-based, which is correct.\n\n- The indices in the first part are handled correctly.\n\n- The ans is computed correctly.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose N=3, and the input P is 2 1 3 (so after subtracting 1, P becomes [1,0,2].\n\nThen map would be:\n\nmap(1) =0 (since P(1)=1, which is index 0 in Java (1-1=0 in Fortran's 1-based? Wait, P(1) is 1 (after subtracting 1?), wait:\n\nWait, the input for P is 2,1,3. So after subtracting 1, P becomes 1,0,2.\n\nSo P(1)=1, P(2)=0, P(3)=2.\n\nmap(1) =0 (since P(1)=1 is at index 1 (Fortran's 1-based), so map(1) =1-1=0.\n\nmap(0) =1 (since P(2)=0 is at index 2 (Fortran's 2), so map(0)=2-1=1.\n\nmap(2)=2 (since P(3)=2 is at index 3, so 3-1=2.\n\nThen, checking for nglist:\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 1 (since N-2=1).\n\ni=0:\n\nmap(0)=1, map(1)=0 \u2192 1>0 \u2192 yes.

Then the first program's output is 1, as above.\n\nAnother example where there are multiple ng elements.\n\nSuppose N=4, and P is [2,0,1,3]. After subtracting 1, P becomes [1, -1? Wait no, wait the input is probably 1-based. Wait, the input for P is given as integers, which are probably 1-based in the problem's input. So for example, if the input is 2 1 3 4, then after subtracting 1, P becomes [1,0,2,3].\n\nWait, let me think of a case where there are multiple ng elements.\n\nLet me take N=4, and P as [2,1,3,4]. So after subtracting 1, P is [1,0,2,3].\n\nWait, then the map would be:\n\nmap(1)=0 (since P(1)=1 is at index 1 (Fortran's 1-based \u2192 0 in Java's 0-based).\n\nmap(0)=1 (P(2)=0 is at index 2 \u2192 1 in Java's index).\n\nmap(2)=2 (P(3)=2 \u2192 index 3 \u2192 2 in Java's index).\n\nmap(3)=3 (P(4)=3 \u2192 index 4 \u21923 in Java's index).\n\nNow, checking for ng elements:\n\ni from 0 to 2 (since N-2=2).\n\ni=0: map(0)=1 vs map(1)=0 \u2192 1>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 add 0.\n\ni=1: map(1)=0 vs map(2)=2 \u2192 0 <2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: map(2)=2 vs map(3)=3 \u2192 2 <3 \u2192 no.\n\nSo nglist has [0], so ng_count=1.\n\nThus ans is min(4-0-1=3, 0+1=1 \u2192 1. So the first part's output is 1.\n\nSecond part would process 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nAnother example where there are multiple ng elements.\n\nSuppose N=5, and P is [3,1,2,4,0]. After subtracting 1, P becomes [2,0,1,3,-1? Wait no, the input must be a permutation of 1..N. So perhaps P is [3,1,2,4,5], so after subtracting 1, P is [2,0,1,3,4].\n\nWait, let me think of a case where there are multiple ng elements.\n\nLet me choose P as [2,0,1,4,3]. After subtracting 1, P becomes [1, -1? No, the input must be a permutation of 1..N. So let's say N=5, and the input P is [3,1,2,5,4]. So after subtracting 1, P is [2,0,1,4,3].\n\nThen the map would be:\n\nmap(2)=0 (since P(1)=2 is at index 1 \u2192 0 in Java's index).\n\nmap(0)=1 (P(2)=0 \u2192 index 2 \u21921).\n\nmap(1)=2 (P(3)=1 \u2192 index3 \u21922).\n\nmap(4)=3 (P(4)=4 \u2192 index4 \u21923).\n\nmap(3)=4 (P(5)=3 \u2192 index5 \u21924).\n\nNow, checking for ng elements:\n\ni from 0 to 3:\n\ni=0: map(0)=1 vs map(1)=2 \u2192 1 <2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: map(1)=2 vs map(2)=2 \u2192 equal \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: map(2)=2 vs map(3)=3 \u2192 2 <3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: map(3)=3 vs map(4)=4 \u2192 3 <4 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, so no ng elements? Then the first program outputs 0. So the second part would take 0 as input. But the second program's code for position=0?\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the position is read as a long. If the first program outputs 0, then the second program's input is 0. Let's see what the second program does with position=0.\n\nIn the second part's code:\n\nposition=0.\n\nThe first loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\ngetValue(2*1)=getValue(2)=2. 2 <0? No. So first loop doesn't run.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck getValue(1+1)=2 <=0? No. So nrstSeqStartIndx remains 1.\n\nstartIndex = getValue(1)=1.\n\nans2 = (0-1)+1 =0. But that's impossible, since the sequences start at 1. Wait, perhaps the second program's code expects position to be at least 1?\n\nHmm, maybe the problem constraints for the second program require position to be \u22651. But in the first program's case, if the output is 0, then the second program would have position=0, which may be invalid. But according to the problem's original setup, perhaps the first program's output is always \u22650, but the second program can handle it.\n\nIn any case, the code as written would proceed.\n\nBut in the example I chose, the first program's output is 0, so the second part's position is 0, leading to ans2=0. But perhaps the second program's code would have a different behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, let me pick another example where there are ng elements.\n\nLet me choose N=4, and P as [2,0,3,1]. After subtracting 1, P becomes [1, -1? No, the input must be a permutation of 1..4. So P is [2,0,3,1] after subtracting 1 would be [1, -1? No, the input must be 1-based. So the input for P is 2,1,4,3 \u2192 subtract 1 gives [1,0,3,2].\n\nThen the map is:\n\nmap(1)=0 (P(1)=1 \u2192 index 1 \u21920).\n\nmap(0)=1 (P(2)=0 \u2192 index2 \u21921).\n\nmap(3)=2 (P(3)=3 \u2192 index3 \u21922).\n\nmap(2)=3 (P(4)=2 \u2192 index4 \u21923).\n\nNow, checking for ng elements:\n\ni from 0 to 2:\n\ni=0: map(0)=1 vs map(1)=0 \u2192 1>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 add 0.\n\ni=1: map(1)=0 vs map(2)=2 \u21920 <2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: map(2)=2 vs map(3)=3 \u21922 <3 \u2192 no.\n\nSo nglist has [0], so ans is min(4-0-1=3, 0+1=1 \u21921.\n\nThus, the second part's position is 1, leading to output 1.\n\nAnother example with multiple ng elements:\n\nLet me choose N=5, and P as [3,1,4,2,5]. After subtracting 1, P is [2,0,3,1,4].\n\nThe map would be:\n\nmap(2)=0 (P(1)=2 \u2192 index0).\n\nmap(0)=1 (P(2)=0 \u2192 index1).\n\nmap(3)=2 (P(3)=3 \u2192 index2).\n\nmap(1)=3 (P(4)=1 \u2192 index3).\n\nmap(4)=4 (P(5)=4 \u2192 index4).\n\nNow, checking for ng elements:\n\ni from 0 to 3:\n\ni=0: map(0)=1 vs map(1)=3 \u21921 <3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: map(1)=3 vs map(2)=2 \u21923>2 \u2192 yes \u2192 add 1.\n\ni=2: map(2)=2 vs map(3)=1 \u21922>1 \u2192 yes \u2192 add 2.\n\ni=3: map(3)=1 vs map(4)=4 \u21921 <4 \u2192 no.\n\nSo nglist has [1,2]. ng_count=2.\n\nans is min(5-1-1=3, 2+1=3 \u21923.\n\nThen, loop over i=1 to 1 (since ng_count-1=1):\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent=1, next=2.\n\ntemp = (1+1)+(5-2-1) \u21922 + (2) \u21924. Which is larger than current ans (3). So no change.\n\nThus ans remains 3.\n\nSo the first part's output is 3.\n\nSecond part's position=3.\n\nNow compute the second part:\n\nposition=3.\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop:\n\ngetValue(2) =2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\nNow check getValue(4)=1 +3*4/2 =1+6=7. 7 <3? No. So loop stops.\n\nNow nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nCheck getValue(3)=1+2*3/2=1+3=4. 4 <=3? No. So no increment.\n\nThus, nrstSeqStartIndx remains 2.\n\nstartIndex = getValue(2)=2.\n\nans2 = (3-2)+1=2.\n\nSo the final output is 2.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nLet me see what the second program would do with position=3.\n\nThe sequence starts at 1 (index1:1), then index2:2, then index3:4 (since 1+3=4?), wait:\n\nWait the sequence is built as follows:\n\nThe sequence starts at index 1: value 1.\n\nindex2: 1+2=3?\n\nWait the getValue function is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nSo for index=1: 1+0=1.\n\nindex=2: 1 +1*2/2 =2.\n\nindex=3:1 +2*3/2=4.\n\nindex=4:1+3*4/2=7.\n\nSo for position=3:\n\nThe first loop finds the largest power of 2 where 2*2=4's value is 7 which is larger than 3. Wait, initial nrstSeqStartIndx is 1.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nCheck 2*1=2 \u2192 getValue(2)=2 <3 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2 \u21922.\n\nNow check 2*2=4 \u2192 getValue(4)=7 which is not <3. So loop stops.\n\nNow, nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\nThen, check if next index (3) has value 4 which is larger than 3. So the loop increments until the next value exceeds.\n\nWait, the second loop:\n\ndo while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position):\n\ncurrent nrstSeqStartIndx is 2.\n\ngetValue(3)=4>3 \u2192 no. So loop doesn't run.\n\nThus, nrstSeqStartIndx remains 2.\n\nstartIndex is getValue(2)=2.\n\nans2 =3-2 +1=2. Which matches.\n\nThus the code works.\n\nNow, the Fortran code should handle this correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI think the code I outlined earlier should work. Let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, note that in the first part, the nglist is allocated as 1:N, but in the loop, ng_count can be up to N-1. So that's okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's loop over i from 0 to N-2, the loop in Fortran must be written as:\n\ndo i =0, N-2\n\n   if (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n\n      ng_count = ng_count +1\n\n      nglist(ng_count) = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, ans, ng_count\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: P\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: map\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nglist\ninteger(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex, ans2\n\n!

Find nglist\nng_count =0\ndo i =0, N-2\n   if (map(i) > map(i+1)) then\n      ng_count = ng_count +1\n      nglist(ng_count) = i\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Compute ans\nif (ng_count ==0) then\n   ans =0\nelse\n   ans = min( (N - nglist(1) -1), (nglist(ng_count) +1) )\n   do i=1, ng_count-1\n      integer :: current, next, temp\n      current = nglist(i)\n      next = nglist(i+1)\n      temp = (current +1) + (N - next -1)\n      if (temp < ans) ans = temp\n   end do\nend if\n\n! Second part\nposition = int(ans,8)\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1_8\n\ndo while (getValue(2*nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx *2\nend do\n\ndo while (getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n   nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nend do\n\nstartIndex = getValue(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n\nans2 = (position - startIndex) +1\n\nwrite(*,*) ans2\n\ncontains\n\ninteger(8) function getValue(index)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n   getValue = 1 + (index-1)*index /2\nend function getValue\n\nend program combined\n\nThis should be the correct code.\n\nNow, checking for possible off-by-one errors.\n\nIn the first part's nglist loop, the indices are correct.\n\nIn the second part's loops, the logic is correct.\n\nYes, this should work."
