    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC150_D). It reads input n, m, and an array a of n integers. Then each element of a is divided by 2. Then it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in a. If at any point the LCM exceeds m, it outputs 0 and exits. After that, it checks for each a[i] whether (LCD / a[i]) is odd. If any of them is even, output 0. Otherwise, compute (m / LCD +1)/2.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC136_B) takes an integer N and counts the number of integers from 1 to N with an odd number of digits. Wait, no, looking at the code again. Let me see:\n\nThe second program's logic: It counts numbers with an odd number of digits. For example, numbers from 1-9 (1 digit, odd), 100-999 (3 digits, odd), etc. The code loops over digit counts. For each digit count i (from 1 to the number of digits in N), if i is odd, it adds the count of numbers with exactly i digits up to N. The first loop counts the number of digits in N. Then the for loop goes through each possible digit count. For each i, if it's the last digit count (i=count), then if i is odd, add the remaining numbers from 10^(i-1) to N. Otherwise, for other i's, if i is odd, add the total numbers in that digit range (like 90 for 2 digits, but wait, for i=3, it's 900 numbers (999-99)). Wait, the code uses Math.pow(10, i) - Math.pow(10, i-1), which is 9*10^(i-1). So for i=1, it's 9, for i=3, 900, etc. So the second program's output is the total count of numbers with an odd number of digits up to N.\n\nBut how do these two Java programs interact? The first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input N for the second program. So the entire sequence's input is the input to the first program, and the final output is the second program's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process both steps, and output the result of the second step.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, m, and array a from input (first program's input).\n2. Process the first Java program's logic to compute its output (the number that would be printed by the first Java program).\n3. Take that output as the input N for the second Java program.\n4. Process the second Java program's logic on that N to get the final output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (n, m, a array).\n- Compute the first program's result (the number that would be printed).\n- Use that result as N in the second program's computation.\n- Output the result of the second program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first Java program's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (Java's first program):\n\nRead n, m, then n integers. Then divide each by 2 to get a array.\n\nCompute LCM of all elements in a. If LCM exceeds m, output 0.\n\nThen check for each a[i], whether (LCD / a[i]) is odd. If any is even, output 0. Else, compute (m/LCD +1)/2.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nAfter computing LCM, if any step where LCM exceeds m, output 0.\n\nThen, for each a[i], check if (LCD / a[i]) mod 2 ==0. If any is, output 0.\n\nElse, output (m/LCD +1)/2.\n\nSo in Fortran, need to compute LCM of all a elements. The LCM is computed step by step, using GCD.\n\nThe GCD function is recursive in Java. In Fortran, recursion can be done but perhaps better to use iterative GCD.\n\nWait, the GCD function in Java is:\n\npublic static long getGCD(long a, long b) {\n    if (b ==0) return a;\n    else return getGCD(b, a%b);\n}\n\nSo it's the standard Euclidean algorithm. In Fortran, we can write a function for GCD.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's think about variables.\n\nFirst, for the first part:\n\nRead n, m, then n integers. Let's say in Fortran:\n\nRead *, n, m\n\nThen read an array a of size n. But in Fortran, arrays are declared with fixed size, so perhaps we need to read n first, then allocate the array. But since in the original code, n is given first, we can read n, then allocate the array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can have arrays with allocatable size. So:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:)\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread *, a\n\nBut then each element of a is divided by 2. So a = a / 2 (element-wise).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is truncating. So that's okay.\n\nThen compute LCM of all elements in a.\n\nInitialize LCM as 1.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\nCompute current_gcd = GCD(lcm, a(i))\n\nlcm = lcm * a(i) / current_gcd\n\nIf at any point lcm exceeds m, then the result is 0, so we can set a flag and break.\n\nOnce all elements are processed, check if lcm > m: if yes, output 0.\n\nThen check for each a(i):\n\nif (lcm / a(i)) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 if any, output 0.\n\nElse, compute (m/lcm +1)/2.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful with integer division.\n\nNow, the second part of the Java code (the second program) takes the output of the first as N, and computes the count of numbers with odd digit counts up to N.\n\nSo the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's result (let's call it first_result), we need to pass that to the second part's logic.\n\nNow, the second Java program's logic:\n\nRead N (the first_result), then compute the count.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\nCount the number of digits in N. Let's call it count.\n\nInitialize ans =0.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to count:\n\nif i is the last digit count (i=count):\n\n   if i is odd, add (N - 10^(i-1) +1) to ans.\n\nElse:\n\n   if i is 1 \u2192 add 9 (since 1-digit numbers from 1-9)\n\n   else if i is odd \u2192 add 10^i -10^(i-1) \u2192 which is 9*10^{i-1}\n\nWait, 10^i -10^{i-1} = 9*10^{i-1}\n\nSo for i=2 (even), nothing added. For i=3 (odd), add 900 (since 10^3 -10^2 = 900).\n\nSo the code loops through each digit count from 1 to the number of digits in N, and for each i, if it's odd, adds the numbers in that digit range (except for the last digit count, which may be partial).\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to compute the number of digits in N?\n\nWell, one way is to loop dividing by 10 until it's zero, counting steps.\n\nAlternatively, use logarithm, but that might be tricky with integer N.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\ncount = 0\n\ntemp = N\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, the loop over i from 1 to count.\n\nThen for each i:\n\nif i == count:\n\n   if mod(i,2) ==1 then\n\n      ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n   end if\n\nelse:\n\n   if i ==1 then\n\n      ans = ans +9\n\n   else if mod(i,2) ==1 then\n\n      ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. However, for large exponents, like 10^18, but in the problem's constraints, perhaps it's okay. Wait, but in the first program, m can be up to what? The first program's LCM could be up to m, but the second program's N is the first program's output, which is (m/LCD +1)/2. So if m is up to 1e18, then N could be up to (1e18)/1 +1)/2 = ~5e17, which is manageable in 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, using integers of kind 8 (selected_int_kind(18)), which is 64-bit.\n\nSo variables need to be of integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(18)) to handle large numbers.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read n, m, then n integers (the a array).\n\n2. Process the first part's logic to compute first_result.\n\n3. Use first_result as N in the second part's logic to compute the final answer.\n\n4. Output the final answer.\n\nNow, let's structure the code.\n\nFirst, declare variables with appropriate kinds. Let's use integer*8 for variables that can be large (like m, a elements, LCM, etc.)\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count_digits, temp, i_digit\n  integer(8) :: m, a(100000), lcm, gcd_val, first_result, N, ans, temp_N\n  logical :: flag\n\n  ! Read input for first program\n  read *, n, m\n  read *, a(1:n)  ! Assuming a is allocated, but in Fortran, if we declare a as a large array, but n can be up to say 1e5? The original Java code uses an array of size n, so in Fortran, perhaps we can use a large array, but better to use an allocatable array.\n\nWait, better to use allocatable arrays. Let me adjust:\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nread *, a(1:n)\n\nThen, process the first part:\n\na = a / 2  ! Each element divided by 2.\n\nlcm = 1\n\nflag = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   call compute_gcd(lcm, a(i), gcd_val)\n\n   lcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n\n   if (lcm > m) then\n\n      first_result = 0\n\n      flag = .true.\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (flag) then\n\n   ! proceed to second part with first_result=0\n\nelse\n\n   ! check the second condition\n\n   do i =1, n\n\n      if (mod(lcm / a(i), 2) == 0) then\n\n         first_result =0\n\n         flag = .true.\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then\n\n   else\n\n      first_result = (m / lcm +1)/2\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nThen, after computing first_result, we need to process the second part.\n\nSet N = first_result\n\nThen compute ans as per the second program's logic.\n\nSo:\n\nN = first_result\n\nif (N <0) then ... but probably N is non-negative.\n\nans =0\n\ntemp_N = N\n\ncount_digits =0\n\ndo while (temp_N >0)\n\n   count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n   temp_N = temp_N /10\n\nend do\n\ndo i_digit =1, count_digits\n\n   if (i_digit == count_digits) then\n\n      if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (N - 10**(i_digit-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i_digit ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (10**i_digit - 10**(i_digit-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, ans\n\nWait, but in the second part's code, the first loop counts the number of digits in N. Then the for loop from 1 to count_digits.\n\nNow, in Fortran, exponentiation is straightforward with **.\n\nBut need to be careful with integer exponents. Since 10**i is an integer, but for large i (like 18 digits), 10^18 is 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer (max is ~9e18). So okay.\n\nNow, the function compute_gcd. Since in Fortran, functions can be written as subroutines or functions. Let's write a function to compute GCD.\n\nWe can write a recursive function, but in Fortran, recursion might have stack issues for very large numbers, but since the GCD is computed for numbers up to m (which could be up to 1e18?), but the Euclidean algorithm is efficient. Alternatively, write an iterative GCD.\n\nLet me write an iterative GCD function.\n\nsubroutine compute_gcd(a, b, gcd_val)\n\n  integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n\n  integer(8), intent(out) :: gcd_val\n\n  integer(8) :: x, y, temp\n\n  x = a\n\n  y = b\n\n  do while (y /=0)\n\n     temp = mod(x, y)\n\n     x = y\n\n     y = temp\n\n  end do\n\n  gcd_val = x\n\nend subroutine compute_gcd\n\nAlternatively, since in the first part's loop, we need to compute GCD of current LCM and a(i). So the function can be called with a and b as the two numbers.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait, but in the first part's loop, the variables are:\n\nInitially, LCM is 1. For each a(i), compute GCD of LCM and a(i), then LCM becomes LCM * a(i) / GCD.\n\nSo the code for the first part is as above.\n\nNow, handling the case where first_result is 0. Then, in the second part, N is 0, so the second program's code would process N=0. Let's see what the second program does when N=0.\n\nIn the second Java program, when N is 0, the loop to count digits would set count=0 (since temp starts as 0, so the loop doesn't run). Then the for loop from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute. So ans remains 0. So the output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, in the code, when first_result is 0, then N=0, and the second part's code would compute ans=0, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's check edge cases.\n\nAnother edge case: when the first program outputs 0, then the second program's input is 0, so output 0.\n\nAnother case: when first program's output is 1, then the second program counts numbers up to 1 with odd digits. Since 1 has 1 digit (odd), so ans is 1.\n\nNow, in code, when N=1:\n\ncount_digits is 1.\n\nLoop i_digit=1 (which is equal to count_digits). Since i_digit is odd, add (1 -10^0 +1) \u2192 1-1+1=1. So ans=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=99. The second program's output should be numbers with 1 or 3 digits? Wait, 99 has two digits. So numbers with 1 digit (1-9, 9 numbers) and numbers with 3 digits? No, since N=99, so only 1-digit and 2-digit. So the count is 9 (1-digit) plus 0 (since 2 is even). So total 9. Let's see code:\n\ncount_digits is 2.\n\nLoop i_digit from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1: not last digit (count_digits=2). i=1 is first digit. So add 9.\n\ni=2: which is the last digit. i is even (2 mod2=0), so no addition. So total 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=100. count_digits is 3.\n\ni=1: add 9 (since not last digit, and i=1 is odd).\n\ni=2: not last, even \u2192 nothing.\n\ni=3 (last digit, which is odd). So add (100 - 10^(2) +1) \u2192 100-100+1=1. So total 9+1=10. Which is correct: numbers with 1 or 3 digits up to 100. 1-digit (9), 3-digit numbers from 100 (only 100, which has 3 digits). So total 10.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\nBut need to make sure that all variables are of the correct type (integer(8)), and that the array a is properly handled.\n\nAlso, in the first part, after dividing a by 2, but in Fortran, the array a is of integer(8), so dividing each element by 2 is okay.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count_digits, temp_N, i_digit\n  integer(8) :: m, lcm, gcd_val, first_result, N, ans\n  integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  logical :: flag\n\n  ! Read input for first program\n  read *, n, m\n  allocate(a(n))\n  read *, a(1:n)\n\n  ! Process first part\n  a = a / 2  ! Each element divided by 2\n\n  lcm = 1\n  flag = .false.\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    call compute_gcd(lcm, a(i), gcd_val)\n    lcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n    if (lcm > m) then\n      first_result = 0\n      flag = .true.\n      exit\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  if (.not. flag) then\n    do i = 1, n\n      if (mod(lcm / a(i), 2) == 0) then\n        first_result = 0\n        flag = .true.\n        exit\n      end if\n    end do\n  end if\n\n  if (.not. flag) then\n    first_result = (m / lcm + 1) / 2\n  end if\n\n  ! Now process second part with N = first_result\n  N = first_result\n  ans = 0\n  temp_N = N\n  count_digits = 0\n\n  ! Compute number of digits in N\n  if (temp_N == 0) then\n    count_digits = 1  ! Because 0 has 1 digit?\n    ! Wait, in the second Java program, when N is 0, the loop for counting digits would not run (temp starts as 0, so temp >0 is false). So count_digits remains 0. Then the for loop from 1 to 0 doesn't run, so ans is 0. Which is correct.\n\n    ! So in code, when N is 0, count_digits is 0. So need to handle that.\n\n    ! So in code:\n\n    if (temp_N ==0) then\n      count_digits = 1\n    else\n      do while (temp_N >0)\n        count_digits = count_digits +1\n        temp_N = temp_N /10\n      end do\n    end if\n\n    ! Wait, but in the original Java code, for N=0, the loop for counting digits would not run, so count is 0. So the for loop from 1 to 0 doesn't execute, so ans remains 0. Which is correct.\n\n    ! So in Fortran code, when N is 0, the code should set count_digits to 0.\n\n    ! So perhaps better to handle N=0 as a special case.\n\n    ! Let me adjust the code:\n\n    count_digits =0\n    temp_N = N\n    if (temp_N ==0) then\n      count_digits =0\n    else\n      do while (temp_N >0)\n        count_digits = count_digits +1\n        temp_N = temp_N /10\n      end do\n    end if\n\n    ! So that when N is 0, count_digits is 0.\n\n    ! Then the loop over i_digit from 1 to count_digits (0) won't run, so ans remains 0.\n\n    ! So the code for counting digits:\n\n    count_digits =0\n    temp_N = N\n    if (temp_N ==0) then\n      count_digits =0\n    else\n      do while (temp_N >0)\n        count_digits = count_digits +1\n        temp_N = temp_N /10\n      end do\n    end if\n\n    ! Now proceed with the loop.\n\n    do i_digit =1, count_digits\n      if (i_digit == count_digits) then\n        if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n          ans = ans + (N - 10**(i_digit-1) +1)\n        end if\n      else\n        if (i_digit ==1) then\n          ans = ans +9\n        else if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n          ans = ans + (10**i_digit - 10**(i_digit-1))\n        end if\n      end if\n    end do\n  else\n    !

So if count_digits is 0, the loop doesn't run, so ans remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, let me check the case when N is 0. Then the code sets count_digits to 0, so the loop doesn't run, ans is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: N=1000 (4 digits). count_digits is 4.\n\ni_digit=1: not last (4), so add 9 (since i=1 is odd).\n\ni_digit=2: even, nothing.\n\ni_digit=3: not last (4), so add 10^3 -10^2 = 900 (since 3 is odd).\n\ni_digit=4 (last digit, even). So total 9+900 = 909. But the last digit count is 4 (even), so no addition. So total 909. But numbers with 1,3 digits up to 1000:\n\nNumbers with 1 digit: 9 (1-9)\n\nNumbers with 3 digits: 900 (100-999)\n\nNumbers with 4 digits: 1000 has 4 digits (even), so not counted. So total 9+900=909. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=999 (3 digits). count_digits=3.\n\ni_digit=1: add 9.\n\ni_digit=2: not last, even \u2192 nothing.\n\ni_digit=3 (last, odd): add (999 -100 +1) = 900. So total 9+900=909. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in the Fortran code.\n\nWait, in the code above, after computing first_result, the code for the second part is:\n\nN = first_result\n\nans =0\n\ntemp_N = N\n\ncount_digits =0\n\nif (temp_N ==0) then\n\n   count_digits =0\n\nelse\n\n   do while (temp_N >0)\n\n      count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n      temp_N = temp_N /10\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nThen the loop over i_digit from 1 to count_digits.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, after setting count_digits, the loop is:\n\ndo i_digit =1, count_digits\n\n   if (i_digit == count_digits) then\n\n      if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (N - 10**(i_digit-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i_digit ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i_digit,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (10**i_digit - 10**(i_digit-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the first part's code, after the first loop (computing LCM), if any step causes LCM >m, then first_result is 0 and flag is set. Then, the second loop (checking the divisibility by 2) is skipped. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, the code for the first part:\n\nAfter the first loop (computing LCM):\n\nif (flag) then \u2192 first_result is 0.\n\nElse, check the second condition (loop over a(i) to see if any (lcm/a[i]) is even.\n\nIf any, set first_result to 0 and flag to true.\n\nElse, compute first_result as (m/lcm +1)/2.\n\nSo the code structure is okay.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the array a is declared as integer(8), allocatable. The division a = a /2 is element-wise.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let me write the full code.\n\nWait, in the code above, after the first part's processing, the code for the second part is:\n\nN = first_result\n\nans =0\n\ntemp_N = N\n\ncount_digits =0\n\nif (temp_N ==0) then\n\n   count_digits =0\n\nelse\n\n   do while (temp_N >0)\n\n      count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n      temp_N = temp_N /10\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nThen the loop over i_digit.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, after setting count_digits, the loop is:\n\ndo i_digit =1, count_digits\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for the second part is inside the main program.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe full Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count_digits, temp_N, i_digit\n  integer(8) :: m, lcm, gcd_val, first_result, N, ans\n  integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  logical :: flag\n\n  !
