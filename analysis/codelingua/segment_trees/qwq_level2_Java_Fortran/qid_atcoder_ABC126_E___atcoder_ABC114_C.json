    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC126_E) reads input for a Union-Find Tree problem. It reads n and m, then m lines of x, y, z. The z might not be used here since in the unite function, the parameters are x and y. Wait, looking at the code, the unite function takes x and y, so z is probably unused here. The main part counts the number of roots (each root represents a connected component), so the output is the count of roots where par[i] == i.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads N, then counts numbers up to N that contain 3,5,7. But the way it does it is a bit tricky. It starts with 357 and then generates numbers by appending digits? Wait, the code seems to generate numbers in a specific way. Let me see:\n\nThe loop starts with i = 357. Then, while i <= N, it checks if the number contains all three digits. Then, it builds the next number by modifying the digits. The code uses a string manipulation approach. The next number is generated by processing each digit from the end, replacing 3 with 5, 5 with 7, and appending 3 if needed. Hmm, this is a bit complex. The code is generating numbers that consist of 3,5,7 digits only, and counts how many of them up to N have all three digits present.\n\nSo the first program's output is the count of connected components, which is then used as input for the second program? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program's input is N, which is read via gi(). So the first program's output (the count) is the N for the second program. So the second program's N is the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through the first's logic, then take that result as the input for the second's logic, and output the final result of the second.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (n and m, then m lines of x,y,z).\n2. Process the first program's logic (Union-Find to count roots).\n3. Take that count as the N for the second program.\n4. Process the second program's logic (count numbers up to N with 3,5,7 and containing all three digits).\n5. Output the final count from the second program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Union-Find part. The first Java program uses a class with find and unite. In Fortran, I'll need to represent the Union-Find structure with arrays. Let's see:\n\nThe Union-Find Tree has par and rank arrays. The find function is recursive in Java, but in Fortran, recursion might be tricky, so better to implement iteratively or with a loop.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be recursive, but for efficiency, perhaps better to do iterative find.\n\nSo for the first part:\n\nWe need to read n and m, then m lines of x, y, z (but z is unused). Then, for each x,y, we unite them in the Union-Find structure. Then count the number of roots (par[i] == i).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can have arrays par and rank, initialized to par(i) = i, rank all 0.\n\nThe find function: for a given x, find the root.\n\nThe unite function: find roots of x and y, then merge.\n\nOnce all unions are done, count the roots.\n\nThen, the second part: given the count (let's call it N), compute the number of numbers up to N that contain at least one 3,5,7 each.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is a bit more involved. Let me re-examine it.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe loop starts with i = 357. Then, while i <= N, check if the number contains 3,5,7. Then, generate the next number by some digit manipulation.\n\nWait, the code's approach is to generate numbers that consist of 3,5,7 digits only, and count those that have all three. The way it generates the next number is by appending digits in a specific way. Let me see:\n\nThe code uses a loop where i starts at 357, and each step generates the next number by processing the digits of the current i. The next number is generated by:\n\n- Converting i to a string s.\n\n- Then, building a new string by processing each digit from the end (right to left). The first digit (from the end) that is 3 becomes 5, then 5 becomes 7, and others become 3. If none of the digits are 3 or 5, then append a 3.\n\nWait, the code's logic for building the next number is a bit tricky. Let me parse the code:\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder sb. For each character in s (the string of current i), processed in reverse order (since it's s.length() -1 -j, so starting from the last character, moving backward). The loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1, so the first iteration is the last character of s.\n\nWait, the loop is for j from 0 to s.length() -1, so the first character processed is the last character of s (since s.length() -1 -0 is the last character). The loop is going from the end of the string to the beginning.\n\nThe variable 'f' is a flag. Initially false. For each character a (current digit):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- if a is '3', then append '5' to sb, set f to true.\n\n- else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n- else (a is '7' or something else?), append '3'.\n\nWait, but the original number is made of 3,5,7 digits only? Because the code starts with 357 and the next numbers are generated by appending digits in a way that only uses 3,5,7. So the digits are always 3,5,7.\n\nWait, the code's initial i is 357, which is 3,5,7. Then, the next numbers are generated by this process. So the generated numbers are all made of 3,5,7 digits. So the 'a' can only be 3,5,7.\n\nSo in the loop over the digits (from the end of the current number's string):\n\nFor each digit (starting from the last digit):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- if the digit is 3, change to 5, set f to true (so subsequent digits are appended as is).\n\n- if it's 5, change to 7, set f.\n\n- else (it's 7), then we append 3, and since it's not 3 or 5, so f remains false.\n\nWait, in that case, if the digit is 7, then we append '3', and f remains false. So the next digits (moving left) will also be processed under f being false.\n\nWait, but after processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5), then we append a 3 at the end.\n\nWait, the code's logic after processing all digits:\n\nAfter the loop, if !f, then append 3. So the next number is built by this process.\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. The code is generating numbers in a way that increments the digits in a specific order, similar to counting but only with 3,5,7 digits. The next number is generated by finding the rightmost digit that can be increased (3\u21925, 5\u21927, 7\u21923 and carry over?), but perhaps the code is generating numbers in lex order of 3,5,7 digits, but in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating all numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits, in some order, and counts those that have all three digits present.\n\nThe key point is that the second program's N is the count from the first program, and the second program counts how many numbers up to N (the first's output) are made of 3,5,7 digits and contain all three.\n\nWait, but the code's loop starts at 357 and generates numbers in a certain way, incrementing each time. The count c is incremented whenever the current number (i) has all three digits. So the code is counting all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N, which contain at least one 3,5,7 each. So the problem is to count numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits (only those digits) that have all three digits present, and are \u2264 N.\n\nTherefore, the second program's output is the count of such numbers up to N (the first program's output).\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to implement this logic.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nFirst, the steps:\n\n1. Read input for first program (n and m, then m lines of x,y,z).\n\n2. Process the Union-Find to find the count of roots (cnt).\n\n3. Use this cnt as N for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the count of numbers up to N (cnt) that are made of 3,5,7 digits and contain all three.\n\n5. Output that count.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (Union-Find):\n\nWe need to read n and m. Then read m lines of x, y, z (but z is unused). Then process the unions.\n\nImplementing the Union-Find in Fortran:\n\nWe can have arrays par and rank. Initialize par(i) = i, rank(i) = 0 for i from 1 to n (since Java uses 0-based, but in Fortran arrays can be 1-based or 0-based. Let's see: in Java, the nodes are 0-based (since x and y are read as sc.nextInt()-1). So in Fortran, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based indices, but need to adjust the input.\n\nWait, in the Java code, x and y are read as sc.nextInt() -1, so the nodes are 0-based. So in Fortran, the nodes should be 0-based as well. So arrays par and rank should be of size n, with indices from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with 0:.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: par, rank\n\nallocate(par(0:n-1)), etc.\n\nBut first, read n and m.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate par(0:n-1), rank(0:n-1)\n\ndo i = 0 to n-1: par(i) = i; rank(i) =0\n\nthen read m lines:\n\ndo i =1 to m\n\nread *, x, y, z\n\nx = x -1 (since in Java it's subtracted by 1)\n\ny = y -1\n\ncall unite(x,y)\n\nend do\n\nthen count the roots:\n\ncnt =0\n\ndo i=0 to n-1\n\nif par(i) ==i then cnt +=1\n\nend do\n\nThen, proceed to the second part.\n\nNow, the second part: given N = cnt, compute the count of numbers up to N that are made of 3,5,7 digits and contain all three.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is generating numbers in a specific way. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts with i=357, then loops while i <= N. For each i, it checks if it contains 3,5,7. Then, it generates the next i by some digit manipulation.\n\nThe code's approach is to generate all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits in a certain order, and count those that have all three digits. The loop increments i in a way that only considers numbers with 3,5,7 digits. So the code is effectively iterating through all numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits in increasing order, and counts those \u2264 N that have all three digits.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits (each digit is 3,5, or7) that are \u2264 N and contain at least one of each digit.\n\nSo the second part can be rephrased as: count numbers from 357 up to N (if N >=357) that are composed of 3,5,7 digits and have all three digits present.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps a better way is to generate all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits up to N, and count those with all three digits.\n\nBut how to generate them efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to generate them in order, so perhaps we can replicate that logic.\n\nThe code's way of generating next number:\n\nThe current number is i. To get the next number:\n\n- Convert to string s.\n\n- Process each digit from the end (right to left):\n\n- The first digit that is 3 becomes 5, and the rest are kept as is, but the following digits are copied as is.\n\n- If the first digit is 5, it becomes 7, and the rest are kept.\n\n- If it's 7, then it becomes 3, and we have to carry over to the next digit (but since we process from the end, the next digit would be processed similarly).\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is similar to incrementing a number in base 3, but with digits 3,5,7.\n\nAlternatively, the code's next number is generated by incrementing the current number in a way that only uses 3,5,7 digits, similar to counting but with those digits.\n\nThe code's algorithm for generating the next number is a bit tricky. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nTake the current number as a string s. The code processes each character from the end (right to left). The flag 'f' is initially false. For each character (starting from the last digit):\n\n- If f is false:\n\n   - if the current character is '3', change it to '5', set f to true.\n\n   - else if it's '5', change to '7', set f to true.\n\n   - else (it's '7'), change to '3', and leave f as false. Then, after processing all digits, if f is still false, append a '3' at the end.\n\nWait, but in the code's loop:\n\nThe loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1. The index is s.length() -1 -j, so for j=0, it's the last character, j=1 is the second last, etc.\n\nThe code builds the new string as follows:\n\nFor each character in reverse order (starting from the end):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the current character is '3', then append '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if '5', append '7', set f.\n\n      else (it's '7'), append '3', and f remains false.\n\n   else:\n\n      append the current character as is.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5), then append a '3' to the end.\n\nWait, but the code's code:\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder sb. The loop is over each character in s (from the end to the beginning). The first character (last digit of the number) is processed first.\n\nWait, the code's code:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\n    char a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n\n    if (f) {\n\n        sb.append(a);\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a == '3') {\n\n            sb.append('5');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else if (a == '5') {\n\n            sb.append('7');\n\n            f = true;\n\n        } else {\n\n            sb.append('3');\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the 'a' is the current character being processed. The first character processed is the last digit of the original number.\n\nThe 'f' flag is initially false. So for the first character (last digit):\n\nIf it's '3', change to '5', set f to true. The rest of the digits (moving left) are appended as is.\n\nIf it's '5', change to '7', set f to true.\n\nIf it's '7', append '3', and f remains false. Then, the next digits (moving left) are processed under f being false.\n\nWait, but after processing that '7', the next digit (the previous digit in the original number) is processed again with f still false.\n\nSo, for example, if the current number is 377:\n\nThe digits are '3','7','7'.\n\nProcessing from the end (the last '7'):\n\nFirst character (last digit) is '7', so append '3', f remains false.\n\nNext character (second '7') is processed: since f is still false, it's '7', so append '3', f remains false.\n\nNext character (first '3') is processed: since f is false, it's '3', so append '5', set f to true.\n\nSo the new string is '5' (from first digit) followed by '3' (second) and '3' (third), but wait, the order is reversed?\n\nWait, the code is building the new string by appending in the order of processing the digits from the end. Let me see:\n\nThe original number is 377 \u2192 s is \"377\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (j=0: last character '7', j=1: second last '7', j=2: first '3').\n\nThe loop steps:\n\nj=0:\n\na = s.charAt(2) \u2192 '7'\n\nsince f is false:\n\nappend '3' (since a is '7'), f remains false.\n\nj=1:\n\na = s.charAt(1) \u2192 '7'\n\nsince f is still false:\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nj=2:\n\na = s.charAt(0) \u2192 '3'\n\nsince f is false:\n\nappend '5', set f to true.\n\nSo the sb now has '3', '3', '5' \u2192 but the order is the order of appending. Wait, the first character processed (the last digit) is added first, so the sb is built as:\n\nAfter j=0: sb has '3'\n\nj=1: appends '3' \u2192 '33'\n\nj=2: appends '5' \u2192 '335'\n\nThen, after the loop, since f is now true (because the third step set it), the code does not append anything else. Then, the sb is reversed?\n\nWait, the code then does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nAh! So the sb is built in reverse order. Because the first character processed (the last digit of the original number) is the first character in the sb. Then, when reversed, it becomes the next number.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the example above, the sb after processing is '3', '3', '5' \u2192 the string is \"335\".\n\nThen, sb2 is a StringBuffer of that, and then reversed \u2192 \"533\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nSo the sb is \"335\", then reversed becomes \"533\", so the next i is 533.\n\nWait, but the original number was 377. The next number is 533?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is generating numbers in a way that increments the rightmost possible digit, similar to counting but with digits 3,5,7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating all numbers made of 3,5,7 digits in lex order, but in a way that the next number is the next possible in that sequence.\n\nBut regardless, the code's approach is to generate each number in sequence, and count those that have all three digits.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to replicate this, we can follow the same algorithm.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nStart with i =357.\n\nWhile i <= N (the first program's output):\n\n   check if the number contains 3,5,7 (all three digits).\n\n   if yes, increment count.\n\n   generate the next number as per the code's logic.\n\nRepeat until i exceeds N.\n\nThe key is to implement the next number generation correctly.\n\nSo, in Fortran, for each current i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process the digits from the end (right to left) to build the next number.\n\n3. Generate the next i as per the algorithm.\n\nImplementing this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, converting the number to a string. In Fortran, we can use write and read to convert numbers to strings.\n\nThen, process each character.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\ninteger :: N, count =0, current =357\n\ndo while (current <= N)\n\n   if (contains_all(current)) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! generate next current\n\n   s = string_representation(current)\n\n   ! process s to get next number\n\n   ! code to process the string and build next_num\n\n   current = next_num\n\nend do\n\nprint *, count\n\nThe function contains_all checks if the string has '3', '5', '7'.\n\nNow, the main challenge is implementing the next_num generation.\n\nLet me think of the steps for generating next_num:\n\nGiven the current number as a string s:\n\nInitialize a new string (array of characters) to build the next number.\n\nInitialize a flag f = .false.\n\nLoop over each character in s from the end to the beginning (i.e., from the last character to first):\n\nWait, in the code's approach, the loop is over the characters in reverse order (from last to first), but in the code's code, the loop is over j from 0 to len(s)-1, and the index is s.length() -1 -j, so the first character processed is the last character of s.\n\nSo in Fortran, for a string s of length len, the characters are s(1), s(2), ..., s(len). To process from the end, we can loop from i = len down to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, the string can be stored as a character array, and we can loop from the end.\n\nLet me outline the steps for generating the next number:\n\nGiven s as a character array (each character is '3', '5', or '7'):\n\nnew_s is an array to build the new string.\n\nf = .false.\n\ndo i = len(s), 1, -1\n\n   current_char = s(i)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (current_char == '3') then\n\n         new_s(i) = '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n         new_s(i) = '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else ! it's '7'\n\n         new_s(i) = '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      new_s(i) = current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still .false., then we need to append a '3' at the end.\n\nWait, but in the code's approach, the new_s is built in the same order as the original, but the code's algorithm builds the new string in reverse order?\n\nWait, in the code's code, the new string is built by appending characters in the order of processing (from the end to the beginning of the original string). So the first character processed (the last digit of the original number) is the first character in the new string. Then, after building the new string, it is reversed to form the next number.\n\nWait, let me re-express the code's steps:\n\nOriginal string s is \"377\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (last digit first):\n\nThe first character processed is '7' (position 3 in 1-based), then '7' (position 2), then '3' (position 1).\n\nThe new_s is built as follows:\n\nFor each step:\n\ni=3 (last character):\n\ncurrent_char is '7', f is false \u2192 new_s(3) = '3', f remains false.\n\ni=2 (second last):\n\ncurrent_char is '7', f is false \u2192 new_s(2) = '3', f remains false.\n\ni=1 (first character):\n\ncurrent_char is '3', f is false \u2192 new_s(1) = '5', f becomes true.\n\nSo the new_s array after processing is ['5', '3', '3'].\n\nBut the code's code builds the new string by appending each character in the order of processing (i from 1 to len in the original code's loop). Wait, no, in the code's code, the loop is over j from 0 to len-1, so the first character (last digit) is added first to the sb. So the new_s in the code's code is built as:\n\nAfter processing the first character (last digit '7'), the sb has '3'.\n\nThen the second character (second last '7') is processed, adding '3' \u2192 sb is '33'.\n\nThen the third character (first '3') is processed, adding '5' \u2192 sb is '335'.\n\nThen, the sb is reversed to get '533'.\n\nAh, so the new_s array in Fortran's approach (as I outlined) is the same as the code's sb before reversal. So to get the next number, we need to reverse the new_s array and then parse it as a number.\n\nWait, in the code's code, the new string is built in the order of processing (from last to first digit of original), so the new_s array in Fortran (as I outlined) is the same as the code's sb. Then, reversing it gives the next number.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nAfter processing all characters, the new_s array is the same as the code's sb. To get the next number, we need to reverse the new_s array and then convert to a number.\n\nAdditionally, if the flag f is still false after processing all characters, we need to append a '3' to the new_s array before reversing.\n\nWait, in the code's code, after the loop over all characters, if f is false, then append '3' to the sb. So in Fortran:\n\nAfter the loop over all characters, check if f is false. If so, append '3' to the new_s array (but since we are building the array in the same way as the code's sb, which is in reverse order, perhaps we need to add it to the end of the new_s array, then reverse).\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe code's code:\n\nAfter the loop over all characters, if f is false, then:\n\nsb.append('3');\n\nThen, the sb is reversed to form the next number.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter processing all characters in the loop, if f is false, then we need to add a '3' to the new_s array (the current new_s array is of length len(s)), but adding it would make it len(s)+1. So:\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   new_s(len(s)+1) = '3'\n\n   new_length = len(s)+1\n\nelse\n\n   new_length = len(s)\n\nend if\n\nThen, the next number is the reverse of the new_s array (up to new_length).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling variable-length strings can be a bit tricky. Let's think of using character arrays with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the string as a character array of sufficient length, say 20 characters, and track the actual length.\n\nAlternatively, here's a step-by-step plan for the next_num function:\n\nFunction next_num(current):\n\n   s = string of current (e.g., '357')\n\n   len_s = len_trim(s)\n\n   new_s = array of characters, size len_s +1 (to allow appending)\n\n   f = .false.\n\n   do i = 1, len_s\n\n      pos = len_s - i +1  ! because we process from the end (i=1 is last character, i=2 is second last, etc.)\n\n      current_char = s(pos)\n\n      if (.not. f) then\n\n         if (current_char == '3') then\n\n            new_s(i) = '5'\n\n            f = .true.\n\n         else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n            new_s(i) = '7'\n\n            f = .true.\n\n         else ! '7'\n\n            new_s(i) = '3'\n\n         end if\n\n      else\n\n         new_s(i) = s(pos)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      new_s(len_s+1) = '3'\n\n      new_length = len_s +1\n\n   else\n\n      new_length = len_s\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now, the new_s array up to new_length is the 'sb' in the code's code.\n\n   ! To get the next number, reverse this array and convert to integer.\n\n   ! Create the reversed string:\n\n   reversed_s = ''\n\n   do i = 1, new_length\n\n      reversed_s = trim(reversed_s) // new_s(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Wait, no. Wait, the new_s array is built in the order of processing (from last to first character of original s). So the first element of new_s is the first character processed (last digit of s), so the reversed_s should be the reverse of new_s(1:new_length).\n\n   ! For example, if new_s is ['5','3','3'], then reversed_s is '335' \u2192 no, wait, the code's code appends the characters in the order of processing (so the first character is the last digit of s), so the new_s array is the same as the code's sb. Then, reversing it gives the next number.\n\n   ! So the next number is the reverse of new_s(1:new_length).\n\n   ! So to form the reversed string:\n\n   reversed_s = ''\n\n   do i = new_length, 1, -1\n\n      reversed_s = trim(reversed_s) // new_s(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, parse reversed_s to integer.\n\n   read(reversed_s, *) next_num_val\n\n   return next_num_val\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling strings and characters can be a bit involved. Let me think of using character arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of sufficient length, say 20, and then trimming.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach in code:\n\nIn Fortran, to handle the string processing:\n\nFirst, convert the current number to a string. Let's say current is an integer. We can write it into a character string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') current\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! left-adjust to remove leading spaces\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nThen, process each character as per the algorithm.\n\nWe can create an array new_s of length len_s +1.\n\ninteger :: new_length\n\nlogical :: f = .false.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: new_s\n\nnew_s = ' '\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n\n   pos = len_s - i +1  ! position in original string s (1-based)\n\n   current_char = s(pos:pos)\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      if (current_char == '3') then\n\n         new_s(i:i) = '5'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n         new_s(i:i) = '7'\n\n         f = .true.\n\n      else  ! '7'\n\n         new_s(i:i) = '3'\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      new_s(i:i) = current_char\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   new_s(len_s+1:len_s+1) = '3'\n\n   new_length = len_s +1\n\nelse\n\n   new_length = len_s\n\nend if\n\n! Now, reverse the new_s up to new_length to get the next number's string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: reversed_s\n\nreversed_s = ''\n\ndo i = new_length, 1, -1\n\n   reversed_s = trim(reversed_s) // new_s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\n! Now, convert reversed_s to integer.\n\nread(reversed_s, *) next_num_val\n\nBut need to ensure that reversed_s is properly formatted. Also, need to handle leading zeros? Probably not, since the numbers are generated from 357 upwards, so reversed_s should not have leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, the next number is generated by this process, so the reversed_s should be a valid number.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, putting all parts into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe overall structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, x, y, z, i, cnt, N, current, count, next_num_val\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: par, rank\n\n   ! First part: process the first Java program's logic\n\n   read(*,*) n, m\n\n   allocate(par(0:n-1), rank(0:n-1))\n\n   do i =0, n-1\n\n      par(i) = i\n\n      rank(i) =0\n\n   end do\n\n   do i =1, m\n\n      read(*,*) x, y, z\n\n      x = x -1\n\n      y = y -1\n\n      call unite(x, y, par, rank)\n\n   end do\n\n   cnt =0\n\n   do i =0, n-1\n\n      if (par(i) ==i) cnt = cnt +1\n\n   end do\n\n   N = cnt\n\n   ! Second part: process the second Java program's logic\n\n   count =0\n\n   current =357\n\n   do while (current <= N)\n\n      if (contains_all(current)) then\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end if\n\n      current = next_num(current)\n\n   end do\n\n   print*, count\n\ncontains\n\n   !

Also, the reversed_s may have leading spaces, but since we used adjustl earlier, perhaps not. Also, the reversed_s is built by appending characters, so it should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the contains_all function, the loop variable 'i' is not declared. Need to add 'integer :: i, c' inside the function.\n\nAlso, in the contains_all function, the variable 'c' is used but not declared. So:\n\nlogical function contains_all(num)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: num\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   logical :: has3, has5, has7\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   character :: c\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') num\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   has3 = .false.\n\n   has5 = .false.\n\n   has7 = .false.\n\n   do i =1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = s(i:i)\n\n      if (c == '3') has3 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '5') has5 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '7') has7 = .true.\n\n   end do\n\n   contains_all = has3 .and. has5 .and. has7\n\nend function contains_all\n\nAlso, in the next_num function, the variable 'current_char' is used but not declared. Need to add 'character :: current_char' inside the function.\n\nAlso, in the next_num function, the reversed_s is built by appending, but in Fortran, the initial reversed_s is an empty string, and each iteration appends the next character. However, in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so using concatenation may not work as expected. Alternatively, perhaps using a character array for reversed_s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a character array of length new_length and then write it into a string.\n\nAlternatively, here's a revised version of the next_num function:\n\nInside next_num function:\n\n...\n\nreversed_s = new_s(1:new_length)\n\nreversed_s = reverse_string(reversed_s(1:new_length))\n\nBut need a reverse function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nallocate a character array of length new_length:\n\ncharacter(len=new_length) :: temp\n\ndo i =1, new_length\n\n   temp(i:i) = new_s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nreversed_s = reverse(temp)\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, in the loop building reversed_s:\n\nreversed_s = ''\n\ndo i = new_length, 1, -1\n\n   reversed_s = trim(reversed_s) // new_s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nThis should work because each iteration appends the next character to the right. For example, if new_s is '335' (from the example earlier), then new_length is 3. The loop starts at i=3 (new_s(3) is '5'), then i=2 (new_s(2) is '3'), then i=1 (new_s(1) is '3'). So reversed_s becomes '5' then '53' then '533'.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFirst iteration i=3 (new_length is 3):\n\nreversed_s is initially empty. After first iteration, it's '5'.\n\nSecond iteration i=2: append '3' \u2192 '53'.\n\nThird iteration i=1: append '3' \u2192 '533'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut in Fortran, the string is fixed length. So when you do 'trim(reversed_s) // new_s(i:i)', the reversed_s is initially of length 20 (since declared as len=20). But using trim ensures that leading spaces are not considered. However, when building the string, the reversed_s will have trailing spaces, but the read statement should ignore them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array of sufficient length and then converting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code will work as written, but need to ensure that the reversed_s is properly formatted.\n\nAnother possible issue is the initial allocation of the par and rank arrays. In Fortran, the indices start at 0, so when we allocate par(0:n-1), that's okay.\n\nTesting the code for some cases.\n\nTest case for first part:\n\nSuppose n=3, m=0. Then the count is 3 (each node is its own root). So N=3.\n\nThen the second part: current starts at 357, which is larger than 3, so the loop doesn't run. The count is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: first program's output is 357 (if n and m are such that the count is 357). Then the second program would count numbers up to 357 that have all three digits. The first such number is 357 itself. So the count would be 1.\n\nWait, 357 contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes. So if N=357, then the count is 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case for the second part:\n\nSuppose N=357. The loop starts with current=357. It checks if it contains all three digits (yes), so count becomes 1. Then, compute next_num(357):\n\nProcessing s = '357' (len=3).\n\nProcessing each character from the end (positions 3,2,1):\n\ni=1 (pos=3, character '7'):\n\nf is false \u2192 '7' \u2192 new_s(1) = '3', f remains false.\n\ni=2 (pos=2, character '5'):\n\nf is false \u2192 '5' \u2192 new_s(2) = '7', set f to true.\n\ni=3 (pos=1, character '3'):\n\nf is true \u2192 new_s(3) = '3'.\n\nSo new_s is ['3', '7', '3'].\n\nnew_length is 3 (since f is true).\n\nReversed_s is built by looping from 3 down to 1:\n\ni=3 \u2192 '3', then i=2 \u2192 '7', then i=1 \u2192 '3' \u2192 reversed_s is '373'.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, new_s is:\n\nnew_s(1) = '3' (from first character processed, which was '7' \u2192 becomes '3').\n\nnew_s(2) = '7' (from '5' \u2192 becomes '7').\n\nnew_s(3) = '3' (from '3' \u2192 since f is now true, it's kept as '3').\n\nSo the new_s array up to new_length=3 is ['3','7','3'].\n\nReversed_s is built by taking new_s(3), new_s(2), new_s(1):\n\ni=3 \u2192 '3', then i=2 \u2192 '7', then i=1 \u2192 '3' \u2192 so reversed_s is '3'// '7'// '3' \u2192 '373'.\n\nWait, no, the loop is from new_length (3) down to 1:\n\nFirst iteration i=3: new_s(3) is '3' \u2192 reversed_s becomes '3'.\n\nSecond iteration i=2: new_s(2) is '7' \u2192 reversed_s becomes '37'.\n\nThird iteration i=1: new_s(1) is '3' \u2192 reversed_s becomes '373'.\n\nSo the next_num is 373.\n\nThen, the next iteration of the loop checks if 373 is \u2264 N (357). Since 373>357, the loop exits. So the count remains 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=533 (from earlier example).\n\nThe first number is 357 (counted), then next is 373 (counted?), but 373 has digits 3,7,3 \u2192 missing 5 \u2192 not counted. Then next is 533 (contains 5,3,3 \u2192 missing 7? No, 5,3,3 \u2192 no 7. Wait, 533 has digits 5,3,3 \u2192 missing 7. So not counted. Hmm, perhaps my earlier example was wrong.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe next number after 357 is 373 (as above). Then, processing 373:\n\ns is '373', len=3.\n\nProcessing from the end (characters '3', '7', '3'):\n\ni=1 (pos=3 \u2192 '3'):\n\nf is false \u2192 '3' becomes '5', set f to true.\n\ni=2 (pos=2 \u2192 '7'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\ni=3 (pos=1 \u2192 '3'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nnew_s is ['5', '7', '3'].\n\nnew_length is 3.\n\nReversed_s is '375' \u2192 next_num is 375.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nnew_s after processing:\n\ni=1 (pos=3, '3') \u2192 becomes '5', f=true.\n\ni=2 (pos=2, '7') \u2192 since f is true, new_s(2) = '7'.\n\ni=3 (pos=1, '3') \u2192 new_s(3) = '3'.\n\nSo new_s is ['5', '7', '3'].\n\nReversed_s is built by taking new_s(3) \u2192 '3', new_s(2) \u2192 '7', new_s(1) \u2192 '5' \u2192 so reversed_s is '375'.\n\nSo next_num is 375.\n\n375 has digits 3,7,5 \u2192 all three, so count increases to 2.\n\nThen, next_num(375):\n\ns is '375', len=3.\n\nProcessing from end (characters '5', '7', '3'):\n\ni=1 (pos=3 \u2192 '5'):\n\nf is false \u2192 '5' becomes '7', set f to true.\n\ni=2 (pos=2 \u2192 '7') \u2192 f is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\ni=3 (pos=1 \u2192 '3') \u2192 append '3'.\n\nnew_s is ['7', '7', '3'].\n\nnew_length is 3.\n\nReversed_s is '377'.\n\n377 has digits 3,7,7 \u2192 missing 5 \u2192 not counted.\n\nSo the count would be 2 when N=375.\n\nHmm, but this is getting complex. The code should handle it correctly.\n\nOverall, the Fortran code should replicate the logic of the Java programs. The key parts are the Union-Find implementation and the next_num function.\n\nPotential issues to check:\n\n- The Union-Find's find function is implemented iteratively or recursively. In the code above, it's implemented with path compression via recursion (since the function calls itself). In Fortran, recursive functions are allowed, but need to ensure that the stack depth is sufficient. Since the maximum n is up to whatever the first program's input allows, but for typical programming competition problems, it's manageable.\n\n- The next_num function's string processing must correctly handle all cases, including when f remains false (appending '3').\n\n- The contains_all function must correctly check all digits.\n\nAnother possible issue is the initial allocation of the par and rank arrays. Since in Java, the nodes are 0-based, the Fortran code uses 0-based indices (par(0) to par(n-1)), which should be correct.\n\nNow, putting all the code together with the corrections for variable declarations and possible typos."
