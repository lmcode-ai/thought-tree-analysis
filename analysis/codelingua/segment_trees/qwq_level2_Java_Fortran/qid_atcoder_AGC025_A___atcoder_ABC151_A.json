Wait, no, because the loop runs while a is >=10. Let me see: for a=19, first iteration: a is 19, so ans +=9, a becomes 1. Then since a is 1 <10, add 1. So total 10. Wait, but 1+9 is 10. So the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. So the sum function is the digital sum of a.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java file does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_AGC025_A. The main method reads an integer N from input. Then it calculates n as N/2 if even, or (N+1)/2 if odd. Then it initializes ans as the sum of sum(1) and sum(N-1). Then loops A from 1 to n, checking if the sum of sum(A) and sum(N-A) is smaller than the current ans, updating ans if so. Finally, it prints ans. The sum function adds the digits of a number until it's a single digit? Wait, no, actually, the sum function adds all digits of a until it's less than 10? Wait, no, let me see. The sum function starts with ans=0, then while a >=10, it adds the last digit (a%10) to ans, then divides a by 10. Once a is less than 10, it adds the remaining a to ans. So for example, if a is 123, then 123%10 is 3, add to ans (0+3), then a becomes 12. Then 12%10 is 2, add to ans (5), a becomes 1. Then since a is less than 10, add 1 to get total 6. So sum(123) is 6. So the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. Wait, no, because the loop runs while a is >=10. Let me see: for a=19, first iteration: a is 19, so ans +=9, a becomes 1. Then since a is 1 <10, add 1. So total 10. Wait, but 1+9 is 10. So the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. So the sum function is the digital sum of a. So the first program is finding the minimal digital sum of A and N-A, where A ranges up to n (which is N/2 rounded up). The minimal sum is stored in ans, which is initialized to sum(1)+sum(N-1). Then the loop checks all A from 1 to n, and finds the minimum.\n\nThe second Java program is atcoder_ABC151_A. Its main method reads a string s, then prints the first character of s plus 1. Wait, like if the input is \"a\", then it would print 'b'? Because s.charAt(0) is 'a' (ASCII 97), adding 1 gives 98, which is 'b'. So the second program takes a string input, takes the first character, increments it by 1, and outputs that character. The other class RemRing seems to be some modular arithmetic helper, but since the second program doesn't use it, maybe that's part of another problem? Wait, looking at the code for the second file, the main method is in atcoder_ABC151_A, and the RemRing class is defined there but not used. So perhaps that's a mistake, or maybe part of another problem's code that's included by accident. Since the user provided two Java files, but the second one's main is the one that's part of the sequence, perhaps the RemRing is irrelevant here. Because the second program's main only does the first character plus 1. So the second program's output is the first character of the input string incremented by 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two Java programs into a single Fortran program. The first Java program's output is the answer from the first problem, which is then the input to the second Java program. So the first program's output is a number (the minimal sum), which is then the input to the second program. Wait, but the second program expects a string input. Wait, the second program's main reads a line from input, which is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the first program's output is a number, which is given as input to the second program, which then takes that number as a string, takes the first character, increments it, and outputs that.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number, so when you run them in sequence, the first program's output (the minimal sum) is written to stdout, then the second program reads that as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"10\", then the second program would read \"10\" as the input string, take the first character '1', add 1 to get '2', and output \"2\".\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's behavior is: take N as input, compute the minimal sum as per the first program, then take that number's string representation, take its first character, increment it by 1, and output that.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read N from input, compute the same minimal sum as the first Java program, then process that sum as a string, take the first character, add 1, and output that.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program needs to:\n\n1. Read an integer N from input.\n\n2. Compute the minimal sum as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n3. Convert that minimal sum to a string.\n\n4. Take the first character of that string, increment its ASCII value by 1, and output that character.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program's logic into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the sum function. The sum function in Java is the sum of the digits of a number. So in Fortran, a function to compute the sum of digits:\n\nFUNCTION sum_digits(a) RESULT(res)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n    INTEGER :: res, temp, digit\n    temp = a\n    res = 0\n    DO WHILE (temp > 0)\n        digit = MOD(temp, 10)\n        res = res + digit\n        temp = temp / 10\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION sum_digits\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the sum function is written as:\n\nint ans =0; while (a >=10) { ans += a%10; a /=10; } ans +=a;\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, let me re-examine the Java code's sum function:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n    int ans = 0;\n    while (a >= 10) {\n        ans += a % 10;\n        a /= 10;\n    }\n    ans += a;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, so the loop runs while a is >=10. So for a=123, first iteration: a is 123, so ans +=3, a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12, so ans +=2, a becomes 1. Now a is 1 <10, so loop stops. Then ans +=1. So total is 3+2+1=6. So that's the same as the sum of all digits. Because 123's digits are 1+2+3=6. So the function is indeed the sum of all digits. So the function is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop adds the last digit each time, then divides a by 10. So for a=19, the first iteration adds 9, a becomes 1. Then loop stops (since 1 <10), so ans +=1. So total 10. Which is 1+9=10. So yes, the sum is the sum of all digits. So the function is correct.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the sum_digits function can be written as:\n\nFUNCTION sum_digits(a) RESULT(res)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n    INTEGER :: res, temp\n    res = 0\n    temp = a\n    DO WHILE (temp > 0)\n        res = res + MOD(temp, 10)\n        temp = temp / 10\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION sum_digits\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs while a >=10. Wait, but in the code above, the loop runs while temp>0. So for a=0, it would return 0. But in the Java code, if a is 0, the loop doesn't run (since 0 <10), so ans +=0, so returns 0. So the Fortran code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs while a is >=10. So for a=10, the loop runs once: a%10 is 0, added to ans, then a becomes 1. Then loop stops. Then ans +=1. So total 0+1=1. Which is correct (1+0=1). So the Fortran code's approach of looping while temp>0 is equivalent. Because in the Java code, the loop is adding the last digit each time until a is less than 10, then adds the remaining a. The Fortran code adds all digits regardless of the value of a. So the two are equivalent. So the function is correct.\n\nNow, the main logic of the first Java program:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans as sum(1) + sum(N-1).\n\nLoop A from 1 to n, compute sum(A) + sum(N - A), and track the minimum.\n\nSo in Fortran, variables:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute n: if mod(N,2) ==0 then n = N/2 else n=(N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans as sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\nif current < ans, then ans = current.\n\nAfter the loop, ans is the minimal value.\n\nThen, the second part is to take that ans, convert to a string, take first character, add 1, output.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string. How to do that?\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write with an internal variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans\nwrite(str_ans, '(I0)') ans\n\nThen, the first character is str_ans(1:1). But we have to be careful about leading spaces. Because if ans is, say, 12, then the string would be '12', so first character is '1'. But if ans is 5, then the string is '5', so first character is '5'.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing to a string with '(I0)', it should write the number without leading spaces. Let me confirm. The I0 format writes the integer in the shortest possible field. So for example, 5 would be written as '5', 12 as '12', etc. So the string should be correct.\n\nOnce we have the string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, then output it.\n\nWait, in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nSo:\n\nchar_val = ichar(str_ans(1:1)) + 1\n\nresult_char = char(char_val)\n\nThen print that character.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran program structure:\n\nRead N from input.\n\nCompute the minimal sum (ans) as per first Java program.\n\nConvert ans to a string.\n\nTake first character, add 1, output.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, the function sum_digits.\n\nThen, in the main program:\n\nRead N.\n\nCompute n.\n\nInitialize ans.\n\nLoop over A from 1 to n, compute current sum, track the minimum.\n\nThen process the ans as per second program.\n\nNow, code:\n\nPROGRAM main\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER :: N, ans, A, n, current\n    INTEGER FUNCTION sum_digits(a)\n        INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n        INTEGER :: temp, res\n        res = 0\n        temp = a\n        DO WHILE (temp > 0)\n            res = res + MOD(temp, 10)\n            temp = temp / 10\n        END DO\n        sum_digits = res\n    END FUNCTION sum_digits\n\n    ! Read N\n    READ(*,*) N\n\n    ! Compute n\n    IF (MOD(N,2) == 0) THEN\n        n = N / 2\n    ELSE\n        n = (N + 1)/2\n    END IF\n\n    ! Initialize ans\n    ans = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N - 1)\n\n    ! Loop over A from 1 to n\n    DO A = 1, n\n        current = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n        IF (current < ans) THEN\n            ans = current\n        END IF\n    END DO\n\n    ! Now process the ans as per second program\n    CHARACTER(LEN=20) :: str_ans\n    WRITE(str_ans, '(I0)') ans\n    INTEGER :: first_char_ascii\n    first_char_ascii = ICHAR(str_ans(1:1)) + 1\n    CHARACTER(LEN=1) :: result_char\n    result_char = CHAR(first_char_ascii)\n    WRITE(*, '(A)') result_char\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but need to make sure that the string conversion is correct. Let me test some cases.\n\nSuppose N is 10.\n\nFirst program's calculation:\n\nsum(1) is 1, sum(9) is 9 \u2192 initial ans is 10.\n\nThen n is 5 (since 10 is even, 10/2=5).\n\nLoop A from 1 to 5:\n\nA=1: sum(1)=1, sum(9)=9 \u2192 total 10 \u2192 same as ans, no change.\n\nA=2: sum(2)=2, sum(8)=8 \u2192 total 10 \u2192 same.\n\nA=3: 3+7 \u2192 10.\n\nA=4:4+6 \u219210.\n\nA=5:5+5 \u21925+5=10.\n\nSo ans remains 10.\n\nThen the second program takes \"10\" as input, first character is '1', adding 1 gives '2', so output is '2'.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the ans is 10, converted to string \"10\", first character '1', so correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=3.\n\nFirst program:\n\nn is (3+1)/2 = 2.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1)+sum(2) \u21921+2=3.\n\nLoop A=1 and 2.\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(2)=3 \u2192 same as ans.\n\nA=2: sum(2)+sum(1)=3 \u2192 same. So ans remains 3.\n\nSecond program: \"3\" \u2192 first character '3', adding 1 \u2192 '4'.\n\nAnother case: N=19.\n\nFirst program's ans:\n\nLooking for minimal sum(A) + sum(19 - A).\n\nThe minimal sum would be when A=10, 19-10=9. sum(10)=1, sum(9)=9 \u2192 total 10. Or maybe other combinations?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me compute for N=19.\n\nn is (19+1)/2 =10.\n\nLoop A from 1 to 10.\n\nLooking for the minimal sum.\n\nFor example, A=10: sum(10)=1+0=1, sum(9)=9 \u2192 total 10.\n\nA=9: sum(9)=9, sum(10)=1 \u2192 same.\n\nA=19-10=9, same.\n\nAlternatively, A=11? Wait no, since n is 10, so A up to 10.\n\nWait, the minimal could be 10, but maybe there's a lower sum?\n\nWait, let's see A=19: but N is 19, so N-A would be 0. But A can't be 19 since n is 10.\n\nWait, the minimal is 10. So the ans is 10.\n\nThen the second program would take \"10\" \u2192 first character '1' \u2192 output '2'.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is a single digit, like N=2.\n\nFirst program:\n\nN=2 is even, n=1.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1)+sum(1) \u21921+1=2.\n\nLoop A=1: sum(1)+sum(1)=2 \u2192 same. So ans is 2.\n\nSecond program: input is \"2\" \u2192 first character '2', add 1 \u2192 '3'.\n\nSo the Fortran code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the code, the function sum_digits is inside the main program. In Fortran, functions can be internal if they are inside the program block, but they need to be declared before their first use. Since the function is defined before the code that uses it, that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the function is defined inside the program, so that's allowed in Fortran 90 and later. So that should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: the loop variable A is declared as an integer. The variables are all integers, which is correct.\n\nThe string conversion: using '(I0)' should work. The length of the string is 20, which is more than enough for any reasonable N (since the first program's ans is the sum of digits of numbers up to N, which for N up to, say, 1e9 would have a sum of digits up to 9*9=81, so the string length is sufficient).\n\nNow, the final output is written with '(A)', which should print the character without any formatting.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as a line. So if the first program's output is, say, 100, then the second program reads the entire line \"100\" and takes the first character '1', which is correct. The Fortran code does the same by converting the integer to a string and taking the first character.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should correctly replicate the sequence of the two Java programs."
