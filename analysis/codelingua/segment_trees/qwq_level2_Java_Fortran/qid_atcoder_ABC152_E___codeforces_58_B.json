However, in Fortran, the loop is written as do i = start, end, step. So for descending, step is -1. But in the code above, the loop is written as do i = n_second_part -1, 1, -1. That should work.

So in Fortran, we can compute this as integer division. But in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we have to ensure that (current_lcm * a) is divisible by g. Since g is the GCD, this is true. So the steps are:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\nthen mod mod_value. So in code:\n\ninteger(8) :: current_lcm = 1\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   a = A(i)\n\n   g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n   current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\n   current_lcm = mod(current_lcm, mod_value)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but mod_value is 1e9+7. So mod_value is 1000000007. But in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor. So mod(current_lcm, mod_value) is correct here.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC152_E) reads N and an array A of N integers. It calculates the LCM of all elements in A using BigInteger. Then it computes modLcm as LCM mod 1e9+7. Then it calculates the sum of modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod) for each ai in A, where modDiv is division under mod using modular inverse via Fermat's little theorem. The result is printed mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe second Java program (codeforces_58_B) reads an integer n, then prints n followed by the largest possible sequence of numbers decreasing from n where each divides the previous. For example, if n is 6, it would print 6 3 1, but the code seems to print n followed by the largest possible divisors in decreasing steps. Wait, looking at the code: it starts with m = n, then for i from n-1 down to 1, if m is divisible by i, it prints i and sets m to i. So the output is a sequence of numbers where each divides the previous, starting from n and choosing the largest possible next step each time. The output is space-separated, but in the code, it's printed with \" \" after each number, so maybe the output is like \"6 3 1 \" with a trailing space? Not sure, but the exact output formatting might matter.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two programs. The first program's output is the answer from the first Java program, which is a number. That number is the input to the second program. So the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as input to the second program's logic, and output the second's result.\n\nWait, but the user says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So in Fortran, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the value that the first Java program would output, then pass that value to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program), and finally output the result of the second part.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read input (the N and array A) from stdin.\n2. Compute the first program's result (the 'ans' variable from the first Java program).\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program's logic (the codeforces_58_B's main function).\n4. Output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read N and A as in the first Java program.\n- Compute the LCM, modLcm, then the ans as per first program.\n- Then, take that ans as the input n for the second program's logic.\n- Then, compute the sequence as per the second program and print it.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the LCM part. Since Java uses BigInteger for LCM, which can handle very large numbers. However, in the first Java program, the LCM is modded by 1e9+7, so modLcm is LCM mod mod. Then, the modDiv function is (a mod mod) * inv(b) mod mod, where inv is the modular inverse. The final ans is sum of modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod) for each ai, mod mod.\n\nWait, modDiv is modLcm divided by ai mod mod. So modDiv is (modLcm / ai) mod mod. But division mod mod is done via multiplying by the inverse. So modDiv(a, b, mod) is (a * inv(b)) mod mod, where inv(b) is the inverse of b mod mod.\n\nThe key here is that mod must be a prime, which 1e9+7 is, so Fermat's little theorem applies. So the inverse is b^(mod-2) mod mod.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to compute the LCM of the array A. But LCM of a list can be computed iteratively by LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). Since the numbers can be up to 1e9, but with N up to maybe 1e5? Wait, the first Java program's input is N and array A. The problem constraints for the first program's original problem (ABC152 E) probably have N up to 1e5, but in any case, in Fortran, handling big integers might be an issue. Wait, but in the first Java program, the LCM is modded by mod (1e9+7) at the end. Wait, no: the modLcm is LCM mod mod. Wait, the code does:\n\nlcm = ... (the LCM computed as a big integer), then modLcm is lcm.remainder(BigInteger.valueOf(mod)).longValue();\n\nSo modLcm is LCM mod mod. So the LCM itself can be very large, but modLcm is just its remainder mod 1e9+7. So perhaps in Fortran, we can compute the LCM mod mod? Wait, but that's not the same as LCM mod mod. Wait, no, the LCM is computed first, then mod mod. So to compute LCM mod mod, we can compute the LCM step by step, but modding at each step? Not sure. Alternatively, compute the LCM as a big integer, but in Fortran, we can't handle big integers beyond 8-byte integers (since 64-bit integers can go up to 2^63-1, but LCM of numbers up to say 1e9 for N elements could be way larger). Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the LCM is computed as a big integer, but when modded by mod (1e9+7), the modLcm is stored as a long. So perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed without actually computing the full LCM. Let me think: the LCM mod mod can be computed incrementally, using the formula LCM(a, b) mod mod = (a * b / GCD(a, b)) mod mod. But since mod is a prime, and the GCD(a, b) divides both a and b, so when computing (a*b)/gcd(a,b), mod mod, perhaps we can compute it as (a mod mod) * (b mod mod) / (gcd(a,b) mod mod) mod mod? Not sure. Wait, but division mod mod requires multiplying by the inverse. So perhaps the formula can be rewritten as (a * inv(gcd(a,b)) mod mod) * (b mod mod) mod mod ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed step by step, using the formula:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a_i) / gcd(current_lcm, a_i)\n\nBut mod mod. However, since division is involved, we can represent it as multiplying by the inverse of the GCD. Wait, but the division must be exact, so the GCD divides the product. So perhaps the formula can be written as (current_lcm * a_i) / gcd(current_lcm, a_i) mod mod. But since mod is a prime, and the GCD is a factor, perhaps we can compute this as (current_lcm mod mod) * (a_i mod mod) * inv(gcd(current_lcm, a_i) mod mod) mod mod ?\n\nHmm, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the LCM mod mod by keeping track of the current LCM mod mod, but that might not be correct. Let me think of an example. Suppose mod is 7, and the numbers are 3 and 4. LCM(3,4)=12 mod7 is 5. If we compute step by step:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nAfter first step (3):\n\ncurrent_lcm = 3 mod7 =3.\n\nSecond step (4):\n\ncurrent_lcm = LCM(3,4) mod7 = 12 mod7 =5.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm *4)/gcd(3,4) = (3*4)/1 =12 mod7=5. So that works.\n\nBut if we compute (current_lcm mod mod) * (4 mod mod) / gcd(3,4 mod mod) mod mod?\n\nWait, but the GCD is between the current_lcm and a_i, not their mod mod versions. So perhaps the approach is to compute the LCM step by step, but keeping track of the actual LCM, but mod mod at each step? But that might not work because the division by GCD would require that the GCD divides the product, but mod might interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed as the product of all the prime factors in the exponents, mod mod. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, since the LCM can be very large, but mod is 1e9+7, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer, but the LCM itself could be way larger than that. However, in the first Java program, the LCM is computed as a big integer, then mod mod. So the modLcm is LCM mod mod. So perhaps in Fortran, we can compute the LCM mod mod by using the formula:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a_i) / gcd(current_lcm, a_i) mod mod.\n\nWait, but the division here must be exact. Since the GCD divides the product, so (current_lcm * a_i) is divisible by the GCD. So the division is exact. So the result is an integer. So perhaps we can compute this as (current_lcm * a_i) / gcd(current_lcm, a_i), then mod mod. But since the intermediate product could be very large, perhaps we can compute it modulo mod * gcd(current_lcm, a_i) ?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps in Fortran, we can compute the LCM step by step using integers, but since the LCM can be up to (product of all a_i) which could be way too big, but mod is 1e9+7, so perhaps we can compute the LCM mod mod as follows:\n\nInitialize current_lcm = 1 mod mod.\n\nFor each a in A:\n\n   compute g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n   current_lcm = (current_lcm * (a / g)) mod mod\n\nWait, but a is the original a_i, not mod mod. Wait, but a_i could be up to 1e9, so a/g could be up to 1e9. So when multiplied by current_lcm (up to mod), the product could be up to mod * 1e9, which is about 1e18, which is beyond 64-bit integer. So in Fortran, using 64-bit integers (selected_int_kind(18)), which can handle up to 9e18, so maybe okay. Let me see:\n\nSuppose mod is 1e9+7 (~1e9). The maximum a_i is 1e9. The current_lcm is up to mod. So current_lcm * (a_i/g) could be up to 1e9 * (1e9 / 1) = 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer (max 9e18). So yes, 64-bit integers can handle that.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be 64-bit if the compiler allows. So perhaps using integer(8) variables.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current_lcm as 1.\n\nFor each a in A:\n\n   compute g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n   current_lcm = (current_lcm * (a / g)) mod mod\n\nWait, but the a here is the original a_i, not mod mod. Because the GCD is between current_lcm and a_i. So yes, the a_i must be used as is.\n\nWait, but the current_lcm is mod mod, so when computing GCD with a_i, which is up to 1e9, the GCD of a number mod mod (up to 1e9) and a_i (up to 1e9) may not be the same as the GCD of the actual LCM and a_i. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAh, right. Because the current_lcm is being kept mod mod, but the actual LCM is not modded yet. So this approach would not compute the correct LCM mod mod. Because the GCD of current_lcm (mod mod) and a_i may not be the same as the GCD of the actual LCM and a_i. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so this is a problem. How can we compute the LCM mod mod correctly?\n\nAlternative idea: compute the LCM as a big integer, but in Fortran, perhaps using a different approach. Wait, but Fortran doesn't have built-in big integers. So perhaps we can compute the LCM step by step, but keeping track of the LCM as an integer, but only as long as it doesn't exceed the maximum value we can handle. But if the LCM becomes too big, then mod mod can be applied at each step, but only when necessary?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed as the product of all a_i divided by the product of their GCDs, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed as the product of all a_i divided by the product of their GCDs, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LCM mod mod can be computed as follows:\n\nThe LCM of the array is the product of all primes in the array's prime factors, each raised to the maximum exponent present in any element. Then mod mod. But calculating that would require prime factorization of each a_i, which could be time-consuming for large a_i, but maybe manageable for small N.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem constraints for the first Java program (ABC152 E) have N up to 1e5, but in that case, even with N=1e5, the LCM could be enormous. So this approach might not be feasible.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How did the original Java code handle it? It used BigInteger, which can handle arbitrarily large numbers. So in Fortran, without big integers, perhaps we can compute the LCM mod mod by keeping track of the LCM mod mod, but using the formula:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a_i) / gcd(current_lcm, a_i)\n\nBut mod mod. However, the division here must be exact. But since the GCD divides the product, the division is exact. So the problem is that the GCD is between current_lcm and a_i, but current_lcm is mod mod. So the GCD may not be the same as the GCD of the actual LCM and a_i. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps the mod is a prime, and the LCM mod mod is equivalent to the LCM mod mod. So maybe the approach is correct?\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Let's say mod is 7, and the array is [3,4].\n\nThe actual LCM is 12 mod7 is 5.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3:\n\ng = gcd(1,3) =1\n\ncurrent_lcm = (1 *3)/1 =3 mod7 \u21923.\n\nSecond a_i is4:\n\ng = gcd(3,4)=1\n\ncurrent_lcm = (3 *4)/1 =12 mod7 \u21925. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [6,4], mod=7.\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod7=5.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=6:\n\ng = gcd(1,6)=1 \u2192 current_lcm=6 mod7=6.\n\nSecond a=4:\n\ng = gcd(6,4)=2.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (6 *4)/2 = 12 mod7 \u21925. Correct.\n\nAnother example where mod is a factor of the LCM:\n\nSuppose array [7, 14], mod=7.\n\nActual LCM is 14 mod7=0.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=7:\n\ng = gcd(1,7)=1 \u2192 current_lcm=7 mod7=0.\n\nSecond a=14:\n\ng = gcd(0,14). Wait, GCD(0,14) is 14.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (0 *14)/14 \u21920. Correct.\n\nHmm, so in this case, it works. Another example where mod is 5, array [4,6].\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod5 is 2.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=4 \u2192 current_lcm=4 mod5=4.\n\nSecond a=6:\n\ngcd(4,6)=2.\n\ncurrent_lcm = (4*6)/2 = 12 mod5 \u21922. Correct.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach works. Because even though current_lcm is mod mod, the GCD between current_lcm and a_i is the same as the GCD between the actual LCM and a_i?\n\nWait, let's see another example where mod is 7, array [3, 7].\n\nActual LCM is 21 mod7=0.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=3 \u2192 current_lcm=3 mod7=3.\n\nSecond a=7:\n\ngcd(3,7)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = (3*7)/1 =21 mod7=0.\n\nThen, next step if any, but in this case, correct.\n\nAnother test case where mod is 10, array [4,6].\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod10=2.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=4 \u2192 current_lcm=4 mod10=4.\n\nSecond a=6:\n\ngcd(4,6)=2 \u2192 current_lcm = (4*6)/2 =12 mod10=2. Correct.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach works. The key is that even though current_lcm is mod mod, the GCD between current_lcm and a_i is the same as the GCD between the actual LCM and a_i. Because when you compute the LCM step by step, the GCD of current_lcm and a_i is the same as the GCD of the actual LCM (before mod) and a_i?\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the current_lcm is the actual LCM mod mod. Let's denote L as the actual LCM before mod. Then current_lcm = L mod mod. The next a_i is some number. The GCD between L and a_i is G. The new LCM is LCM(L, a_i) = L * a_i / G. The GCD between current_lcm (L mod mod) and a_i is GCD(L mod mod, a_i). Is this equal to G?\n\nHmm, not necessarily. Let me see an example where it might not be.\n\nSuppose mod is 5, array [3, 8].\n\nActual LCM of 3 and 8 is 24. mod5 is 4.\n\nFirst step: current_lcm is 3 mod5=3.\n\nSecond a_i is8 mod5=3 (since 8 mod5 is 3). Wait, but a_i is 8, not modded. So the GCD between current_lcm (3) and a_i (8) is GCD(3,8)=1. So new LCM is 3*8 /1 =24 mod5=4. Which is correct.\n\nBut the actual LCM is 24 mod5=4. So the approach works here.\n\nAnother example where mod is 7, array [6, 9].\n\nActual LCM of 6 and9 is 18 mod7 is 4.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=6 \u2192 current_lcm=6 mod7=6.\n\nSecond a=9:\n\ngcd(6,9)=3 \u2192 current_lcm = (6*9)/3 = 18 mod7=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example where mod is 6, array [4, 3].\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod6=0.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=4 \u2192 current_lcm=4 mod6=4.\n\nSecond a=3:\n\ngcd(4,3)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = (4*3)/1 =12 mod6=0.\n\nThird step (if any) would be handled similarly.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach works. The key is that even though current_lcm is mod mod, the GCD between current_lcm and a_i is the same as the GCD between the actual LCM and a_i. Because when you compute the LCM step by step, the GCD between the current LCM (before mod) and a_i is the same as the GCD between current_lcm mod mod and a_i?\n\nWait, not sure. Let me think of a case where this might not hold.\n\nSuppose mod is 5, array [3, 8].\n\nWait, earlier example worked. Let me think of another case.\n\nSuppose mod is 9, array [6, 4].\n\nActual LCM of 6 and4 is 12 mod9 is 3.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=6 \u2192 current_lcm=6 mod9=6.\n\nSecond a=4:\n\ngcd(6,4)=2 \u2192 current_lcm = (6*4)/2 =12 mod9=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example where mod is 10, array [15, 20].\n\nActual LCM is 60 mod10=0.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=15 \u2192 current_lcm=15 mod10=5.\n\nSecond a=20:\n\ngcd(5,20)=5 \u2192 current_lcm = (5*20)/5 =20 mod10=0.\n\nThird step (if any) would be okay.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach works. So perhaps the way to compute LCM mod mod is to track current_lcm as (current_lcm * a_i / gcd(current_lcm, a_i)) mod mod, where a_i is the original a_i, not modded. The GCD is between current_lcm (which is mod mod) and a_i. But why does this work?\n\nBecause when you compute the LCM step by step, each step's GCD is between the current LCM (before mod) and a_i. However, when you mod the current_lcm by mod, the GCD between the modded value and a_i may not be the same as the GCD between the original current LCM and a_i. But in the examples above, it worked. Maybe there's a mathematical reason here.\n\nWait, let me think of a case where it might fail.\n\nSuppose mod is 7, array [3, 5].\n\nActual LCM is 15 mod7=1.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=3 \u2192 current_lcm=3 mod7=3.\n\nSecond a=5:\n\ngcd(3,5)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = (3*5)/1 =15 mod7=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example where mod is 6, array [4, 3].\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod6=0.\n\ncurrent_lcm after first step (4 mod6=4), then a=3:\n\ngcd(4,3)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = 12 mod6=0. Correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is correct. Let me think of a case where it might not be.\n\nSuppose mod is 8, array [6, 4].\n\nActual LCM is 12 mod8=4.\n\nUsing the approach:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=6 \u2192 current_lcm=6 mod8=6.\n\nSecond a=4:\n\ngcd(6,4)=2 \u2192 current_lcm = (6*4)/2 =12 mod8=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example where mod is 12, array [8, 9].\n\nActual LCM is 72 mod12=0.\n\ncurrent_lcm after first step (8 mod12=8).\n\nSecond a=9:\n\ngcd(8,9)=1 \u2192 current_lcm = (8*9)/1 =72 mod12=0. Correct.\n\nHmm, so maybe this approach works. So perhaps the formula is correct. Therefore, in Fortran, we can compute the LCM mod mod as follows:\n\nInitialize current_lcm as 1.\n\nFor each a in A:\n\n   compute g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n   current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\n   current_lcm = mod(current_lcm, mod_value)\n\nWait, but division by g must be exact. Since g is the GCD, the division is exact. So in Fortran, we can compute this as integer division.\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but we have to ensure that (current_lcm * a) is divisible by g. Since g is the GCD, this is true.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ncurrent_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\nthen mod mod_value.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger(8) :: current_lcm = 1\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   a = A(i)\n\n   g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n   current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\n   current_lcm = mod(current_lcm, mod_value)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but mod_value is 1e9+7. So mod_value is 1000000007.\n\nBut in Fortran, the mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the divisor. So mod(current_lcm, mod_value) is correct here.\n\nNow, the next part is computing modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod). The modDiv function in Java is (a mod mod) * inv(b) mod mod. So for each ai, we need to compute (modLcm / ai) mod mod. Which is equivalent to modLcm * inv(ai) mod mod.\n\nWait, modDiv(a, b, mod) is (a / b) mod mod, which is a * inv(b) mod mod.\n\nSo for each ai, the term is modLcm * inv(ai) mod mod. Then sum all those terms mod mod.\n\nSo the sum is (sum over ai (modLcm * inv(ai))) mod mod.\n\nWait, but modLcm is LCM mod mod. So modLcm is already mod mod. So each term is (modLcm * inv(ai)) mod mod.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can compute inv(ai) as modPow(ai, mod-2, mod), since mod is prime.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute modLcm as the current_lcm after processing all elements.\n\nThen compute the sum:\n\nans = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   ai = A(i)\n\n   inv_ai = modPow(ai, mod-2, mod_value)\n\n   term = modLcm * inv_ai\n\n   ans = mod(ans + term, mod_value)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but mod is 1e9+7, which is a prime, so Fermat's applies.\n\nNow, the modPow function in Fortran. The modPow function in Java is implemented with exponentiation by squaring. So in Fortran, we can write a function modPow(b, e, mod) that returns (b^e mod mod).\n\nImplementing modPow in Fortran:\n\nfunction modPow(b, e, mod_val) result(res)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: b, e, mod_val\n   integer(8) :: res, x, y\n   res = 1\n   x = mod(b, mod_val)\n   y = e\n   do while (y > 0)\n      if (btest(y, 0)) then  ! if y is odd\n         res = mod(res * x, mod_val)\n      end if\n      x = mod(x * x, mod_val)\n      y = rshift(y, 1)\n   end do\nend function modPow\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the bits are handled with bitwise functions. The btest function checks if the least significant bit is set. Then, shift right.\n\nAlternatively, using loops with bit operations.\n\nNow, the GCD function. The GCD of two integers can be computed with the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nfunction gcd(a, b) result(g)\n   integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n   integer(8) :: g, x, y, r\n   x = a\n   y = b\n   do while (y /= 0)\n      r = mod(x, y)\n      x = y\n      y = r\n   end do\n   g = x\nend function gcd\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem: the second Java program takes an integer n and outputs the sequence of numbers starting from n, then the largest possible divisor less than the previous, etc.\n\nThe second Java program's code:\n\npublic class codeforces_58_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(n + \" \");\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \");\n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the code is using System.out.println for each number, with a space. So the output is like \"6 5 4 3 2 1 \" but with each number followed by a space and a new line? Or is it all on one line? Looking at the code:\n\nThe first line is System.out.println(n + \" \"); which adds a space and a new line. Then, for each i from n-1 down to 1, if m%i ==0, it does System.out.println(i + \" \"); again adding a space and new line. So the output is each number on its own line with a trailing space. But the problem says that the second program's output is the input to the next, but in this case, the second program is the last, so its output is the final output of the entire Fortran program.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the final Fortran program should have only the first block read input, the last block produce output, and intermediate steps process without I/O. So the second part's output is the final output.\n\nThe second Java program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, each on their own line with a trailing space? Or all on one line? Let me check the code again.\n\nThe first line is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nThis would print n followed by a space, then a new line.\n\nThen, for each i, when it prints, it does System.out.println(i + \" \"); which again adds a space and a new line. So the output is:\n\nn followed by a space and new line,\n\nthen each subsequent number followed by space and new line.\n\nSo the output is multiple lines, each with a number and a space. The user probably wants the same output.\n\nIn the Fortran program, the second part must take the 'ans' from the first part (the output of the first Java program) as its input n, then compute the sequence and print it as per the second Java program.\n\nSo in Fortran, after computing the first part's ans, we need to process it as n in the second part.\n\nThe second part's logic is:\n\nInitialize m = n.\n\nPrint n followed by a space (and new line).\n\nThen, for i from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   if m mod i ==0, then print i followed by space (and new line), set m =i.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n = ans  ! ans is the result from first part, but mod 1e9+7, but since it's an integer, we can cast to integer(8) if needed.\n\nWait, but ans is computed mod 1e9+7, which is up to 1e9, so can be stored in a 32-bit integer. But in Fortran, integers can be 4 bytes, but to be safe, perhaps use integer(8).\n\nWait, the second Java program's input is an integer, which can be up to 1e9+7-1, which is about 1e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer (max 2^31 ~2e9). So in Fortran, using integer(4) is okay, but better to use integer(8) to be safe.\n\nSo steps for the second part:\n\nRead n from the first part's ans.\n\nThen:\n\nprint *, n, ' '  \u2192 but in Fortran, to print with a space, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, A)') n, ' '\n\nBut the Java code uses System.out.println, which adds a new line. So in Fortran, after each print, we need to output a new line.\n\nWait, the first print in Java is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWhich outputs n followed by a space, then a new line.\n\nSimilarly for the others. So in Fortran, to replicate that, after each number, we need to print the number followed by a space, then a new line.\n\nAlternatively, each print statement in Java is a line with the number and a space. So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, \" \")') n\n\nBut that would not add a new line. Wait, the Java code uses println, which adds a new line. So in Fortran, the write statement should include a new line.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, \" \")') n\n\nfollowed by a new line. Wait, the format specifier can include a new line.\n\nAlternatively, the format can be '(I0, A)', and the A is a space followed by a new line? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, \" \")') n\n\nThis would write the number, a space, and then the next write would start on the next line. Wait, no, the default in Fortran is that each write starts a new line unless specified otherwise. So to have the space and stay on the same line, we need to use a format that doesn't add a new line.\n\nWait, the Java code's first print is:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWhich outputs the string \"n \" followed by a new line. So in Fortran, to do the same, we can write:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') trim(adjustl(n))//' '\n\nBut that would not add a new line. Wait, no, the write statement with * as the unit will go to stdout, and the format '(A)' will write the string and then a new line. Wait, no, the default for write is to advance to the next line. To prevent that, we can use advance='no'.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)', advance='no') trim(adjustl(n))//' '\n\nThen, to add a new line, we can do:\n\nwrite(*,*)\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to write each number followed by a space and a new line. So for the first number:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, \" \")') n\n\nThis would write the number, a space, and then the next write would start on a new line. Wait, no, the format '(I0, \" \")' will write the number and a space, but the record is ended, so the next write will start on a new line. So the first line would be \"n \" followed by a new line. The second line would be \"i \" followed by a new line, etc. Which matches the Java code's output.\n\nSo the code for the second part would be:\n\ninteger(8) :: n = ans  ! ans is from first part.\n\nwrite(*,'(I0, \" \")') n\n\nm = n\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n   if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n\n      write(*,'(I0, \" \")') i\n\n      m = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop is from n-1 down to 1, stepping by -1. So in Fortran, the loop is do i = n-1, 1, -1.\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = n-1; i>0; i--), which is the same.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe entire Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N and array A.\n\n2. Compute modLcm as per first part.\n\n3. Compute ans as the sum of modLcm * inv(ai) mod mod for each ai.\n\n4. Then, take ans as n, and compute the second part's sequence.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nmod_value is 1000000007.\n\nWe need to read N, then read N integers into an array A.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer(8), parameter :: mod_value = 1000000007_8\n\n   integer :: N\n\n   integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n\n   integer(8) :: current_lcm, ans, modLcm, i, m, n_second_part\n\n   ! Read input\n\n   read*, N\n\n   allocate(A(N))\n\n   read*, A\n\n   ! Compute LCM mod mod_value\n\n   current_lcm = 1_8\n\n   do i = 1, N\n\n      integer(8) :: a = A(i)\n\n      integer(8) :: g = gcd(current_lcm, a)\n\n      current_lcm = (current_lcm * a) / g\n\n      current_lcm = mod(current_lcm, mod_value)\n\n   end do\n\n   modLcm = current_lcm\n\n   ! Compute ans\n\n   ans = 0_8\n\n   do i = 1, N\n\n      integer(8) :: ai = A(i)\n\n      integer(8) :: inv_ai = modPow(ai, mod_value-2, mod_value)\n\n      ans = mod(ans + modLcm * inv_ai, mod_value)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, second part: process ans as n\n\n   n_second_part = ans\n\n   ! Output the second part's result\n\n   write(*,'(I0, \" \")') n_second_part\n\n   m = n_second_part\n\n   do i = n_second_part -1, 1, -1\n\n      if (mod(m, i) == 0) then\n\n         write(*,'(I0, \" \")') i\n\n         m = i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\ncontains\n\n   ! Define the gcd function\n\n   integer(8) function gcd(a, b)\n\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n\n      integer(8) :: x, y, r\n\n      x = a\n\n      y = b\n\n      do while (y /= 0)\n\n         r = mod(x, y)\n\n         x = y\n\n         y = r\n\n      end do\n\n      gcd = x\n\n   end function gcd\n\n   !

However, in Fortran, the loop is written as do i = start, end, step. So for descending, step is -1.\n\nBut in the code above, the loop is written as do i = n_second_part -1, 1, -1. That should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: N=1, A=[5]\n\nFirst part:\n\ncurrent_lcm =5 mod mod_value \u21925.\n\nans = modLcm * inv(5) mod mod_value \u21925 * inv(5) mod mod_value. Since inv(5) is 5^(mod-2) mod mod.\n\n5 * inv(5) mod mod is 1. So ans is 1.\n\nSecond part: n_second_part =1.\n\nOutput first line: 1 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from 0 down to 1? Wait, n_second_part is 1, so n_second_part-1 is 0. The loop is from 0 to 1 with step -1, which doesn't execute. So the output is just \"1 \" followed by a new line. Which matches the Java code's output for n=1.\n\nAnother test case: N=2, A=[6,4].\n\nFirst part:\n\ncurrent_lcm starts at 1.\n\nFirst a=6: gcd(1,6)=1 \u2192 current_lcm =6 mod mod \u21926.\n\nSecond a=4: gcd(6,4)=2 \u2192 current_lcm = (6*4)/2 =12 mod mod \u219212.\n\nmodLcm is 12.\n\nans is sum over each ai of 12 * inv(ai) mod mod.\n\nFor ai=6: inv(6) is 6^(mod-2) mod mod. 12 * inv(6) mod mod is 12/6 mod mod =2.\n\nFor ai=4: 12 * inv(4) mod mod is 12/4 mod mod =3.\n\nTotal ans =2+3=5 mod mod \u21925.\n\nSecond part: n_second_part=5.\n\nOutput first line:5 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from 4 down to 1:\n\nCheck m=5.\n\ni=4: 5 mod4 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3:5 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2:5 mod2 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1:5 mod1 is 0 \u2192 yes. So print 1 followed by space and new line. m becomes 1.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n5 \n\n1 \n\nWhich matches the Java code's output for n=5.\n\nAnother test case: N=2, A=[3,4].\n\nFirst part:\n\ncurrent_lcm after first step (3) \u21923 mod mod is3.\n\nSecond a=4: gcd(3,4)=1 \u2192 current_lcm=12 mod mod \u219212.\n\nmodLcm=12.\n\nans is 12/3 +12/4 mod mod \u21924 +3 =7 mod mod \u21927.\n\nSecond part: n=7.\n\nOutput first line:7 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from 6 down to 1:\n\nCheck m=7.\n\ni=6:7 mod6=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=5:7 mod5=2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4:7 mod4=3 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3:7 mod3=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2:7 mod2=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1:7 mod1=0 \u2192 yes. Print 1.\n\nSo output is:\n\n7 \n\n1 \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the second part's sequence is longer:\n\nSuppose the first part's ans is 6.\n\nSecond part's n=6.\n\nOutput first line:6 followed by space and new line.\n\nThen loop from 5 down to 1:\n\ni=5:6 mod5=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4:6 mod4=2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3:6 mod3=0 \u2192 yes. Print 3, m=3.\n\nThen loop continues from 2 down to 1 (since i is now 2, but the loop is from 5 down to 1, but after i=3, the next is i=2, but the loop is already in the iteration.\n\nWait, the loop is from 5 down to 1, so after 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nAfter i=3 is processed (m becomes 3), then i=2:\n\nCheck m=3 mod2 \u21921 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1:3 mod1=0 \u2192 yes. Print 1.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the mod function returns a value with the same sign as the divisor. Since mod_val is positive, mod(a,b) will be between 0 and b-1.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling zero in the array A. For example, if any ai is zero, then the LCM would be zero, but modDiv would involve division by zero. However, in the original Java code, if any ai is zero, then the LCM would be zero, and modLcm would be zero mod mod. Then, when computing modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod), if ai is zero, then inv(ai) is undefined. But in the problem's constraints, perhaps the input A does not contain zero. The original problem (ABC152 E) probably has constraints that A_i are positive integers. So assuming that the input A has no zeros, the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when computing inv_ai for ai=0, but since the problem's constraints likely prevent that, it's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when modLcm is zero, then each term is zero, so ans is zero. Then the second part's n is zero, but the second Java program's code would have n=0, but the loop starts from n-1 =-1, which is invalid. But in the problem's constraints, the first program's output (ans) is mod mod, which is between 0 and mod-1. If ans is zero, then the second part's code would have n=0, but the loop from -1 down to 1 would not execute. The first print would be 0 followed by space and new line. Then the loop doesn't run. So the output is \"0 \" followed by a new line. Which is what the second Java program would do if given n=0. But if the first program's ans can be zero, then that's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly."
