So the list is the digits of the new number in the correct order. So in Fortran, processing the string from the end (each character) and collecting the processed digits in an array, then reversing the array would be wrong. Wait no, because the list in Java is built in the order of processing (from the end of the original number), so the first element is the first digit of the new number. So in Fortran, if we process the string from the end, the first character (the last digit of the original) is processed first, and stored in the first position of the array.

So if all digits are kept, the new number would be 4321, which is the reverse of the original.

So the first element (0) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), then the next (1) by 10^1 (tens place). So the total is 10.

So to get the correct string representation of the new number, the list must be reversed. So in Fortran, after processing each digit and storing them in an array (in the same order as the Java list), we need to reverse the array to get the digits in the correct order (most significant to least).",

So during iteration, when we reach the first character (index 0), that's the first digit of the original number. So in the loop, for each character, we can track whether it's the first character (i.e., the first digit of the original number). So in Fortran:\n\n      Suppose the input string is stored in a character array s(len), with indices from 1 to len (Fortran uses 1-based). To process from the end, we loop from i = len down to 1. For each i from len downto 1:\n\n          r = ichar(s(i)) - ichar('0') compute 9 - r.\n\n          if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n              if (i == 1) then:  (since i=1 is the first character, which is the first digit of the original number) if (9 - r == 0) then: (i.e., r is 9)\n\n                      add r to the array.\n\n                  else:\n\n                      add (9 - r) to the array.\n\n              else:\n\n                  add (9 - r) to the array.\n\n          else:\n\n              add r to the array. Wait, but the condition in Java is:\n\n      if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n          if (x/10 ==0 (i.e., this is the first digit) and (9 - r ==0)) then add r else add 9 - r. So in the string approach, the first digit is when i ==1 (the first character). So when processing the first digit (i=1), we need to check if 9 - r is zero (i.e., r is 9).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_514_A) reads a long integer from input. It processes each digit of the number. For each digit, if 9 minus the digit is less than the digit itself, it uses 9 - digit instead, except when the remaining part of the number is zero and 9 - r is zero, then it just uses the digit. Then it constructs a new number from these processed digits and prints it.\n\nWait, let me parse that again. The loop is while x > 0, so it's processing each digit from the end. For each digit r (x mod 10), if 9 - r is less than r, then it adds 9 - r to the list, except if x/10 is 0 (meaning it's the first digit) and 9 - r is 0, then it adds r. Otherwise, add r. Then the list is reversed when building the new number because the digits are collected in reverse order (since we process from the end). Wait, no, the list is built by taking the last digit first, so when building the new number, the first element of the list is the first digit of the new number? Let me see:\n\nThe list is built by taking the last digit first. For example, if the input is 123, the first r is 3, then 2, then 1. The list would be [3,2,1]. Then when building newNumber, starting with pow=0, so 3*10^0, then 2*10^1, then 1*10^2, so the new number is 321. Wait, that's the reverse of the original number. Wait, but the original number was 123, so the new number would be 321? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, the code is taking each digit from the end (since x is divided by 10 each time). The list is built in reverse order. Then when building newNumber, the first element (the first digit processed, which is the last digit of the original number) is multiplied by 10^0, so it's the units place. The next element is multiplied by 10^1, so tens place, etc. So the new number is the digits in the same order as they were processed, which is the reverse of the original number's digits. Wait, but the original code's purpose is to find the minimal sum of digits? Or maybe it's trying to find the minimal number by replacing each digit with the smaller between the digit and 9 - digit. Wait, the condition is if (9 - r < r), then use 9 - r. So for each digit, choose the smaller between r and 9 - r. Except when the remaining part is zero (i.e., it's the first digit) and 9 - r is zero, then use r. Wait, that exception is when the remaining part is zero (so x/10 is zero, meaning we're at the first digit) and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9). Then in that case, we add r (9) instead of 0. Because if you have a digit 9, then 9-9 is 0, but if it's the first digit, adding 0 would make it a leading zero, which is not allowed. So the code is ensuring that leading zeros are not added. So the first digit can't be zero unless the number is zero, but since the input is x>0, the first digit can't be zero. So the code is processing each digit, replacing it with the minimal between r and 9-r, except when the digit is 9 and it's the first digit, then it stays as 9.\n\nSo the first program takes a number, processes each digit to choose the minimal between the digit and 9 - digit, but ensuring that leading zeros are not introduced. The result is the minimal possible number with the same number of digits, perhaps? Not sure, but that's what the code does.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC158_A) reads a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, outputs \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, the problem is to translate both into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number, which is then read as a string by the second program. Wait, no, the second program expects a string input. Wait, the first program outputs a number, which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a string (using in.next()), which would be the number as a string. So the first program's output is a number, which when printed, becomes a string input for the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first process the input through the first algorithm, then process the result through the second algorithm, and output the final result (Yes/No).\n\nThe key is to chain the two processes without I/O in between. So in Fortran, the first part will read the input (the original number), process it as per the first Java program, then pass the resulting number to the second processing step (checking if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'). Wait, but the second step's input is the string representation of the first's output. So the first step's output is a number, which when converted to a string (without leading zeros?), then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'? Wait, but numbers don't have letters. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the second Java program is expecting a string input, which is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a number, so when that is printed, it's a string of digits. So the second program's input is that string of digits, which would not contain 'A' or 'B', so the output would always be \"No\". But that can't be the case. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe second program's input is read as a string via in.next(). So the input is a single token, which is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. Since numbers don't have 'A' or 'B', the second program would always output \"No\". But that's only if the first program's output is a number. Wait, but maybe the first program's output is a string? No, the first program's code is processing a number and outputs a number. So the second program's input is a string of digits, so it can't have 'A' or 'B', so the output is always \"No\". But that's strange. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, but when printed, it's written as a string. So the second program's input is that string. So for example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which doesn't contain 'A' or 'B', so output is \"No\". But maybe the first program's output is a string? No, the first program's code is taking a number, processing digits, and outputting a number. So the second program's input is a string of digits, so the answer is always \"No\". Unless the first program's output is a string with letters, but that's not the case here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me recheck the Java code for the second program.\n\nLooking at the second Java code:\n\nThe second program's solve method reads a string s = in.next(); then checks if s contains 'A' and 'B'. So the input to the second program must be a string that can contain letters. But the first program outputs a number, so the input to the second program is that number as a string. Unless the first program's output is a string with letters, but that's not the case here. Wait, the first program's code is processing a number and outputs a number. So the second program's input is a string of digits, so the output is always \"No\". Unless there's a mistake in the problem's setup. Maybe the first program's output is a string with letters? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nThe first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program reads a long x, processes each digit, and outputs newNumber, which is a long. So the output is a number, which when printed is a string of digits. So the second program's input is that string of digits, which can't have 'A' or 'B', so the output is \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe the first program's input is a string? Wait, no, the first program's input is a long. So the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is a string of digits, so the answer is always \"No\". That's odd. But perhaps the problem is correct, and the second program is just a dummy here, but the user wants the Fortran code to do exactly the same steps.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first process the input number through the first algorithm, then take the resulting number, convert it to a string, and check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the string is all digits, the answer will be \"No\" unless the first program's output is a string with letters, which it isn't. But the problem says to translate the entire sequence, so I have to follow the steps as per the code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (the original number from stdin).\n\n2. Process it as per the first Java program to get a new number.\n\n3. Convert that new number to a string (without leading zeros, since the first program's output doesn't have leading zeros).\n\n4. Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B' (which it won't, but the code must do it).\n\n5. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part: processing the number.\n\nThe first Java program's algorithm:\n\nTake the input number x (as a long). Process each digit from the end (right to left). For each digit r (x mod 10):\n\nif (9 - r < r) then use 9 - r, except when x/10 is 0 (meaning it's the first digit) and 9 - r is 0 (so r is 9), then use r (so 9 instead of 0).\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 == 0 (i.e., this is the first digit) and (9 - r == 0 (so r is 9)), then add r (so 9) instead of 0.\n\nElse, add 9 - r.\n\nElse, add r.\n\nWait, the code's condition is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n   else list.add(9 - r);\n\n} else list.add(r);\n\nSo when 9 - r is less than r, then we choose 9 - r, except when it's the first digit (x/10 ==0) and 9 - r is 0 (so r is 9), then we add r (9) instead of 0.\n\nSo for example, if the first digit is 9, then 9 -9 is 0, which is less than 9. But since it's the first digit, we add 9 instead of 0. So the first digit can't be zero.\n\nSo the algorithm is to replace each digit with the smaller of r and 9 - r, except when the digit is the first and 9 - r is zero (so r is 9), then it stays as 9.\n\nThe purpose is to find the minimal possible number with the same number of digits, perhaps? Because replacing each digit with the smaller between r and 9 - r would minimize the digit's value, but ensuring that leading zeros are not allowed.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to process this.\n\nFirst, read the input number. Since Fortran can handle integers, but if the number is very large (since it's a long in Java), but assuming that the input is within Fortran's integer limits (or using a string approach). Wait, but in the first Java program, the input is a long, which can be up to 9e18. Fortran's integer might not handle that, but perhaps the problem expects that the input is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the input is read as a string, then processed digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program can be implemented by processing the number digit by digit, similar to the Java code.\n\nLet me think of steps for the first part in Fortran:\n\nRead the input as a string, then process each character (digit) from the end.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the number is processed by taking mod 10 and dividing by 10 each time. So the digits are processed from the least significant digit first. The list is built in reverse order (since the first digit processed is the last digit of the original number). Then the new number is constructed by reversing the list (since the list is in reverse order of the original digits, but when building newNumber, the first element is the first digit of the new number). Wait, no, the code builds newNumber by starting with the first element (the last digit of the original number) as the units place, then the next as tens, etc. So the new number is the digits in the same order as they were processed (from the end of the original number). So the new number is the reverse of the original digits, but each digit is replaced by the minimal between r and 9 - r, except for the first digit (original's first digit) which can't be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the number as a string. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the input is a number, say 1234.\n\nProcessing each digit from the end (4,3,2,1):\n\nFor 4: 9-4=5, which is less than 4? No, 5>4, so keep 4.\n\nWait, 9-4 is 5, which is greater than 4, so we keep 4.\n\nWait, the condition is if (9 - r < r), then use 9 - r. So for 4, 5 <4? No, so we keep 4.\n\nWait, 9-4 is 5, which is not less than 4, so we add 4.\n\nNext digit 3: 9-3=6>3 \u2192 keep 3.\n\nNext digit 2: 9-2=7>2 \u2192 keep 2.\n\nNext digit 1: 9-1=8>1 \u2192 keep 1.\n\nSo the new number is 1234 \u2192 same as original.\n\nAnother example: input 9.\n\nProcessing: r=9. 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. But since x/10 is 0 (it's the first digit), and 9 - r is 0, so we add r (9). So the new number is 9.\n\nAnother example: input 19.\n\nDigits are 9 (from mod 10 first), then 1.\n\nProcessing 9 (the first digit in the list, but it's the last digit of the original number):\n\nWait, the first step is x=19 \u2192 r=9. Then x becomes 1 (19/10 is 1).\n\nThen for r=9:\n\nCheck if 9 -9 <9 \u2192 yes (0 <9). But since x/10 (1/10 is 0?), wait, x after first step is 19/10 =1 (integer division). So when processing the first digit (the 9 here is the last digit of the original number, so the first step's r is 9. Then x is now 1. So when processing the 9, the x/10 is 1 (since x was 19, then divided by 10 gives 1). Wait, the condition is x/10 ==0? So in this case, when processing the 9 (the last digit of original 19), the x after division is 1, so x/10 (the next step's x) is 1, so the condition x/10 ==0 is false. So the exception doesn't apply. So for the 9, since 9-9 is 0 <9, so we add 0. Then the next digit is 1 (from x=1 mod10 \u21921). 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1, so add 1. So the list is [0,1]. Then building newNumber: 0*10^0 +1*10^1 \u2192 10. So the output is 10.\n\nWait, but the original number was 19, so the new number is 10. That's correct because replacing 9 with 0 (since 0 is smaller than 9) and 1 stays as 1. So the new number is 10, which is smaller.\n\nAnother example: input 999.\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\nFirst digit (last digit of original) is 9. x is 999 \u2192 r=9. x becomes 99.\n\nCheck 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. But x/10 (99/10 is 9, so not zero. So add 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 (from 99 mod10 \u21929). x becomes 9.\n\nAgain, 9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. x/10 is 0 (since 9/10 is 0). So check if x/10 (9/10 is 0) and 9 -r (0) \u2192 yes. So add r (9). So the list is [0,0,9]. Then newNumber is 0*10^0 +0*10^1 +9*10^2 \u2192 900. So the output is 900.\n\nSo the algorithm works as intended.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to do this.\n\nApproach:\n\nRead the input as a string, then process each character from the end (since we need to process digits from the least significant to most, like the Java code does). Alternatively, read the number as an integer, but that may have issues with very large numbers. Alternatively, process the number as a string.\n\nLet me think of processing as a string.\n\nFirst, read the input as a string. Then iterate over each character from the end to the beginning, processing each digit.\n\nWait, but the original code processes the number by taking mod 10 and dividing by 10, which effectively processes the digits from the end. So processing the string from the end would be similar.\n\nSo steps for first part in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input as a string (since it can be very large, but in Fortran, reading as a string is easier).\n\n2. Iterate over each character in reverse order (from the end to the start), processing each digit.\n\n3. For each digit (converted to integer), apply the condition.\n\n4. Collect the processed digits in a list (array), then reverse them to form the new number (since we processed from the end, the first digit processed is the last digit of the original, so the collected digits are in reverse order of the new number's digits? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nIn the Java code, the list is built by adding each digit (processed) in the order of processing (from the end of the original number). Then when building newNumber, the first element is the first digit of the new number. So the list is in the order of the digits of the new number. Because the first element is the first digit (the last digit of the original number), then next is the next digit (second last of original), etc. So the list is the digits of the new number in the correct order. So when building the new number, the digits are added in the order of the list, which is the correct order.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the list is built as follows:\n\nFor x = 123:\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nx = 123 \u2192 r = 3 \u2192 add to list \u2192 list [3]\n\nx = 12 \u2192 r = 2 \u2192 add \u2192 list [3,2]\n\nx = 1 \u2192 r =1 \u2192 add \u2192 list [3,2,1]\n\nThen newNumber is 3*10^0 + 2*10^1 +1*10^2 \u2192 321. So the new number is the reverse of the original. Wait, but that's because the code is processing the digits from the end. So the new number is the reverse of the original digits, but each digit is replaced by the minimal between r and 9 - r (with the exception for leading zeros).\n\nWait, but in the example of 19 \u2192 the new number was 10, which is not the reverse. Let me see:\n\nOriginal number 19 \u2192 digits are 1 and 9. The list is [0 (from 9), 1 (from 1)]. So new number is 0*1 +1*10 \u2192 10. So the digits are [0,1], which is the processed digits in the order of processing (9 first, then 1). So the new number is 10, which is correct.\n\nSo the list is the digits of the new number in the correct order. So in Fortran, processing the string from the end (each character) and collecting the processed digits in an array, then reversing the array would be wrong. Wait no, because the list in Java is built in the order of processing (from the end of the original number), so the first element is the first digit of the new number. So in Fortran, if we process the string from the end, the first character (the last digit of the original) is processed first, and stored in the first position of the array. So the array is already in the correct order for the new number's digits. So no need to reverse.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal number as string \"1234\".\n\nProcessing each character from the end (4,3,2,1):\n\nEach digit is processed and stored in an array in the order [4,3,2,1]. Then the new number is 4321. But according to the algorithm, each digit is replaced by the minimal between r and 9 - r. So if all digits are kept, the new number would be 4321, which is the reverse of the original. But in the first example where the original was 1234, the new number would be 4321 only if all digits are kept. But in the case of 19, the first digit (9) is replaced by 0 (since 9-9=0 <9, but since it's not the first digit of the original number (the first digit is 1), so the exception doesn't apply. So the processed digits are 0 and 1, so the new number is 01 \u2192 but leading zero is not allowed. Wait, but in the Java code, when processing the 1 (the first digit of the original number), the x after processing the 9 is 1 (since 19/10 is 1). So when processing the 1 (the second digit in the list?), let's see:\n\nWait, in the Java code, after processing the 9 (the last digit of 19), the x becomes 1. Then the next step is x=1, so r=1 mod10 \u21921. Then check if 9-1=8 <1 \u2192 no. So add 1. So the list is [0,1]. The new number is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the first digit is 0, but that would be leading zero. Wait, but the new number is 10, which is correct. The first digit (the first element of the list) is 0, but when building the number, it's 0 followed by 1 \u2192 10. So leading zeros are allowed in the list, but when building the number, the leading zeros would be part of the number. Wait, but in the code, the newNumber is built by adding each digit multiplied by 10^pow, starting with pow=0. So the first element (0) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), then the next (1) by 10^1 (tens place). So the total is 10. So leading zeros in the list would result in leading zeros in the number, but the code allows that? Wait, but in the case of the first digit of the original number (the first digit in the list is the last digit of the original), but when the first element of the list is zero, that would be the first digit of the new number, leading to a leading zero. But in the example of 19 \u2192 the new number is 10, which is correct. But what if the original number is 9?\n\nOriginal number 9 \u2192 processing:\n\nr=9, x becomes 0. The list is [9] (since the exception applies: x/10 is 0 (since x was 9, divided by 10 is 0), and 9 - r is 0 \u2192 so add r (9). So the new number is 9 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: original number is 0 \u2192 but the code's loop runs while x>0, so it won't process anything. The list is empty, so newNumber is 0. But the problem says the input is x>0, so maybe 0 is not considered.\n\nSo in Fortran, processing the digits as a string from the end, each character is converted to a digit, processed, and stored in an array. The array is in the correct order (the first element is the first digit of the new number). Then, the new number is formed by concatenating the digits in the array. But leading zeros would be a problem? Wait, in the example of 19 \u2192 the array is [0,1], which forms 01 \u2192 but the code's calculation gives 10. Wait, no, the code's calculation is 0*1 +1*10 \u2192 10. So the array is [0,1], so the digits are 0 followed by 1 \u2192 the number is 10. So the array is correct. So the array is the digits of the new number in order. So when forming the string, we can just concatenate the array elements as characters, but leading zeros would be part of the number. However, the code's algorithm ensures that the first digit (the first element of the array) is not zero unless the number is zero. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 10 \u2192 digits are 1 and 0.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst digit (0): r=0. 9-0=9>0 \u2192 so add 0. x becomes 1.\n\nNext digit (1): 9-1=8 <1? No, 8 is less than 1? No, 8 is greater than 1. Wait, 9-1 is 8, which is greater than 1. So add 1. So the array is [0,1]. The new number is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the first digit is 0, leading to 10. But that's okay because the original number was 10, and the new number is 10. Wait, but the algorithm would process 10 as follows:\n\nWait, original number 10:\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nx =10 \u2192 r=0 \u2192 9-0=9>0 \u2192 add 0. x becomes 1.\n\nThen x=1 \u2192 r=1 \u2192 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 add 1. So array is [0,1]. newNumber is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the new number is same as original. But according to the algorithm, since 0 is the first digit (the last digit of the original number), but the first element of the array is 0, which is the first digit of the new number. So leading zero is allowed here? But the new number is 10, which is correct. So leading zeros in the array are allowed as long as they are not the first digit of the new number's first digit? Wait, no, in this case, the first digit is 0, but the new number is 10, which is correct. Wait, no, the new number is 10, which is correct. The array is [0,1], so the digits are 0 followed by 1 \u2192 01 \u2192 but the code's calculation gives 10. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, the code's calculation is:\n\nnewNumber starts at 0. For each element in the list (0 and 1):\n\nFirst iteration: newNumber = 0 + 0 * 10^0 \u2192 0. pow becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration: newNumber = 0 + 1 * 10^1 \u2192 10. So the result is 10. So the array [0,1] gives 10. So the array is correct. So the array is the digits in the correct order, but when building the number, the first element is the least significant digit? No, no. Wait, the first element is the first digit of the new number. Wait, no, the first element is the first digit in the list, which is the first digit of the new number. Wait, in the code's loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < list.size(); i++) {\n\n   newNumber += list.get(i) * 10^pow;\n\n   pow++;\n\n}\n\nSo the first element (i=0) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), so it's the least significant digit. The second element is multiplied by 10^1 (tens place), so it's the next digit. So the array [0,1] gives 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the digits are stored in the array in the order of least significant to most significant. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the array is the digits in reverse order of the new number. Wait, no, the first element is the least significant digit. So the array [0,1] represents the number 10, where 0 is the units digit and 1 is the tens digit. So the array is stored in the order of the digits from least to most significant. So the new number is formed by the array elements as the digits from right to left. So the array is the digits in the order of the number's digits from right to left. So to form the number as a string, we need to reverse the array.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Let me re-express:\n\nThe list in Java is built by processing the digits from the end of the original number. Each digit is added to the list in the order of processing (so the first digit in the list is the last digit of the original number). The new number is constructed by multiplying each element by 10^pow, where pow starts at 0 and increments. So the first element (the first digit processed) is multiplied by 10^0 (units place), the second by 10^1 (tens), etc. So the list's elements are the digits of the new number from least significant to most significant. So the list [0,1] corresponds to the number 10 (0 in units, 1 in tens). So the digits of the new number are [1,0], but stored in the list as [0,1]. Therefore, to form the string representation of the new number, we need to reverse the list.\n\nAh! So the list in Java is the digits in reverse order of the new number. So the first element is the least significant digit. Therefore, to get the correct number as a string, the digits must be reversed.\n\nWait, in the first example with input 1234:\n\nThe list is [4,3,2,1]. The new number is 4*1 +3*10 +2*100 +1*1000 \u2192 1234? No, 4+30+200+1000 = 1234. Wait, but that's the original number. But according to the algorithm, each digit is kept if 9 - r is not less than r. For 4, 9-4=5>4 \u2192 so kept. So the new number is same as original. So the list [4,3,2,1] gives 4321? No, no. Wait, the calculation is 4*10^0 +3*10^1 +2*10^2 +1*10^3 \u2192 4 + 30 + 200 + 1000 = 1234. So the new number is the same as the original. So the list's elements are the digits in the order of the original's reversed digits, but when multiplied by increasing powers of 10, it reconstructs the original number. Wait, that's confusing. Let me see:\n\nWait, the list is [4,3,2,1], so the first element is 4 (units place), then 3 (tens), 2 (hundreds), 1 (thousands). So the number is 1 (thousands) + 2 (hundreds) + 3 (tens) +4 (units) \u2192 1234. So the list's elements are the digits of the original number in reverse order. So the new number is the same as the original. So the algorithm leaves it as is.\n\nAnother example: input 19 \u2192 list [0,1]. The new number is 0*1 +1*10 \u219210. So the digits are 1 and 0 \u2192 10. So the list's elements are [0,1], which when reversed gives [1,0], forming 10.\n\nSo to get the correct string representation of the new number, the list must be reversed. So in Fortran, after processing each digit and storing them in an array (in the same order as the Java list), we need to reverse the array to get the digits in the correct order (most significant to least).\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran for the first part are:\n\n1. Read the input as a string.\n\n2. Initialize an array to hold the processed digits.\n\n3. Iterate over each character in the input string from the end to the beginning (like the Java code's mod 10 approach).\n\n4. For each character (digit):\n\n   a. Convert to integer r.\n\n   b. Compute 9 - r.\n\n   c. If (9 - r < r):\n\n      i. Check if this is the first digit (i.e., whether there are no more digits left to process after this one). Wait, how to determine if it's the first digit of the original number?\n\n      Hmm, in the Java code, the condition is whether x/10 ==0. Since in the Java code, after processing a digit, x is divided by 10. So when processing the first digit (the most significant digit of the original number), after division by 10, x becomes 0. So in the Java code, the condition is whether the remaining x (after division) is zero.\n\n      But in the string approach, how to know if this is the first digit (the most significant digit of the original number)?\n\n      The first digit in the original number is the first character of the string. So when processing the string from the end, the first digit (most significant) is processed last. So when processing the last character (the first digit of the original number), we can check if it's the first digit.\n\n      Alternatively, during iteration, track whether we are at the first digit (the first character of the string).\n\n      Let me think:\n\n      The input string is, say, \"1234\". The first character is '1', which is the first digit (most significant). When processing from the end (starting at index 3 (digit '4'), then 2 ('3'), then 1 ('2'), then 0 ('1')), the last character processed is '1', which is the first digit of the original number.\n\n      So during iteration, when we reach the first character (index 0), that's the first digit of the original number. So in the loop, for each character, we can track whether it's the first character (i.e., the first digit of the original number).\n\n      So in Fortran:\n\n      Suppose the input string is stored in a character array s(len), with indices from 1 to len (Fortran uses 1-based). To process from the end, we loop from i = len down to 1.\n\n      For each i from len downto 1:\n\n          r = ichar(s(i)) - ichar('0')\n\n          compute 9 - r.\n\n          if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n              if (i == 1) then:  (since i=1 is the first character, which is the first digit of the original number)\n\n                  if (9 - r == 0) then: (i.e., r is 9)\n\n                      add r to the array.\n\n                  else:\n\n                      add (9 - r) to the array.\n\n              else:\n\n                  add (9 - r) to the array.\n\n          else:\n\n              add r to the array.\n\n      Wait, but the condition in Java is:\n\n      if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n          if (x/10 ==0 (i.e., this is the first digit) and (9 - r ==0)) then add r else add 9 - r.\n\n      So in the string approach, the first digit is when i ==1 (the first character). So when processing the first digit (i=1), we need to check if 9 - r is zero (i.e., r is 9). If so, then we add r (9) instead of 0.\n\n      So the code would be:\n\n      if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n          if (i ==1 .and. (9 - r ==0)) then\n\n              add r to the array.\n\n          else\n\n              add (9 - r) to the array.\n\n          end if\n\n      else\n\n          add r to the array.\n\n      end if\n\n      So that's the condition.\n\n      Once all digits are processed, the array has the digits in the order of the Java list (from least to most significant). To form the new number as a string, we need to reverse the array.\n\n      So after processing all digits, we reverse the array to get the digits in the correct order (most to least), then concatenate them into a string.\n\n      Now, handling leading zeros:\n\n      The first digit of the new number (the first element of the reversed array) must not be zero. Because in the Java code, the exception ensures that when it's the first digit (original's first digit), it can't be zero. Let's see:\n\n      Suppose the original number is 10 \u2192 first digit is 1. When processing the first digit (i=1, r=1):\n\n          9-1=8 <1? No (8>1). So add 1. So the array element for this digit is 1. The array after processing all digits would be [0,1], reversed to [1,0], forming \"10\".\n\n      Another example: original number is 9 \u2192 first digit is 9. Processing it:\n\n          9-9=0 <9 \u2192 yes. Since it's the first digit (i=1), and 9 -r is 0 \u2192 so add r (9). So the array has [9], reversed is [9], so \"9\".\n\n      Another example: original number is 100 \u2192 digits are '1','0','0'.\n\n          Processing from the end (third character '0'):\n\n          first iteration (i=3, r=0):\n\n              9-0=9>0 \u2192 so add 0.\n\n          second iteration (i=2, r=0):\n\n              9-0=9>0 \u2192 add 0.\n\n          third iteration (i=1, r=1):\n\n              9-1=8 <1? No \u2192 add 1.\n\n          array is [0,0,1]. Reversed \u2192 [1,0,0] \u2192 \"100\".\n\n      So leading zeros are not a problem because the first digit (original's first digit) is processed last, and if it's non-zero, it will be the first element of the reversed array.\n\n      So the steps are:\n\n      - Read the input as a string.\n\n      - Process each character from the end to the beginning, storing the processed digits in an array (in the order of least to most significant).\n\n      - Reverse the array to get the correct digit order (most to least).\n\n      - Convert the array to a string, which is the new number.\n\n      Now, the second part of the problem is to check if this new string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the new number is a string of digits, it will never contain 'A' or 'B', so the output will always be \"No\". But we have to do it as per the code.\n\n      So the second part in Fortran is:\n\n      Take the new string (from the first part), check if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since it's digits, it won't, so output \"No\".\n\n      But the code must do exactly what the second Java program does.\n\n      So the steps for the second part are:\n\n      - Take the new string (from first part).\n\n      - Check if it contains 'A' and 'B'.\n\n      - Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n      Now, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\n      The Fortran program will:\n\n      1. Read the input string.\n\n      2. Process it as per the first Java program to get the new number as a string.\n\n      3. Check if the new string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n      4. Output \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n      Now, coding this in Fortran.\n\n      Let's outline the code:\n\n      Program main\n\n          implicit none\n\n          character(len=200) :: input_str, new_num_str\n          integer :: len, i, j\n          integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n          logical :: has_A, has_B\n\n          ! Read input\n          read(*,'(A)') input_str\n          len = len_trim(input_str)\n\n          ! Process the digits\n          allocate(digits(len))\n          j = 0\n          do i = len, 1, -1\n              integer :: r\n              r = ichar(input_str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n              integer :: nine_minus_r = 9 - r\n              if (nine_minus_r < r) then\n                  if (i == 1 .and. nine_minus_r == 0) then\n                      ! first digit and 9 - r is 0 (r is 9)\n                      j = j + 1\n                      digits(j) = r\n                  else\n                      j = j + 1\n                      digits(j) = nine_minus_r\n                  end if\n              else\n                  j = j + 1\n                  digits(j) = r\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          ! Now, the digits array has the processed digits in reverse order (LSB first)\n          ! Need to reverse to get the correct order (MSB first)\n          integer :: new_len = j\n          character(len=new_len) :: temp_str\n          do i = 1, new_len\n              temp_str(i:i) = achar(digits(i) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n          new_num_str = temp_str(new_len:1:-1)  ! Wait, no. Wait, the digits array is in the order of the Java list (LSB first). To reverse it, we need to reverse the array.\n\n          Wait, the digits array is filled in the order of processing (from the end of the input string). So the first element is the first digit processed (the last digit of the input), which is the least significant digit of the new number. The array is [d1, d2, ..., dn], where d1 is the least significant digit. To form the new number as a string, we need to reverse the array so that the first element becomes the most significant digit.\n\n          So the correct way is:\n\n          The digits array has elements in the order of the Java list (LSB first). To get the correct string, we need to reverse the array.\n\n          So:\n\n          new_num_str = ''\n\n          do i = new_len, 1, -1\n              new_num_str = trim(new_num_str) // char(digits(i) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n\n          Alternatively, using an array and then reversing:\n\n          character(len=new_len) :: temp_str\n          do i = 1, new_len\n              temp_str(i:i) = char(digits(i) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n          new_num_str = temp_str(new_len:1:-1)\n\n          Wait, no. Let's see:\n\n          Suppose the digits array is [0,1], which corresponds to the new number 10. The array is [0,1], so the first element is 0 (LSB), second is 1 (next). To form the string \"10\", we need to take the elements in reverse order: 1 followed by 0. So the reversed array would be [1,0].\n\n          So the code should reverse the digits array.\n\n          So:\n\n          ! Reverse the digits array to get the correct order\n          character(len=new_len) :: temp_str\n          do i = 1, new_len\n              temp_str(i:i) = char(digits(new_len - i +1) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n          new_num_str = temp_str\n\n          Or perhaps:\n\n          new_num_str = ''\n          do i = new_len, 1, -1\n              new_num_str = trim(new_num_str) // char(digits(i) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n\n          That would work. Starting from the end of the digits array (the most significant digit of the new number), appending each character.\n\n          So for digits array [0,1], new_len=2:\n\n          i=2 \u2192 char(1 +48) \u2192 '1', new_num_str is '1'\n\n          i=1 \u2192 char(0 +48) \u2192 '0', new_num_str becomes '10'.\n\n          So that works.\n\n          So the code for forming new_num_str is:\n\n          new_num_str = ''\n          do i = new_len, 1, -1\n              new_num_str = trim(new_num_str) // char(digits(i) + ichar('0'))\n          end do\n\n          Then, after that, we need to check if new_num_str contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\n          To check for presence of 'A' and 'B':\n\n          has_A = .false.\n          has_B = .false.\n          do i = 1, len_trim(new_num_str)\n              character :: c = new_num_str(i:i)\n              if (c == 'A') then\n                  has_A = .true.\n              else if (c == 'B') then\n                  has_B = .true.\n              end if\n          end do\n\n          if (has_A .and. has_B) then\n              print *, 'Yes'\n          else\n              print *, 'No'\n          end if\n\n          Now, putting all together.\n\n          Also, need to handle the case where the input is zero? But according to the first Java program's loop, it only runs while x>0, so input zero would not be processed, but the problem says the first program's input is a long, so maybe zero is allowed. But the second program would process it as \"0\", which doesn't have A or B.\n\n          Edge cases:\n\n          - Input is \"AB\" \u2192 but the first program would read it as a number, which is invalid. But the problem says the first program reads a long, so the input must be a valid number. So the input to the first program is a number, so the second program's input is a string of digits, so the output is always \"No\".\n\n          So the code should work.\n\n          Now, coding this in Fortran.\n\n          Also, note that in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. The input_str is read with a length sufficient to hold the input. Using len=200 should be enough for most cases.\n\n          Also, the digits array is allocated with size len, but the actual number of digits may be less (if leading zeros are added, but according to the algorithm, leading zeros are not added except when necessary). Wait, no, the algorithm ensures that the first digit (original's first digit) is not zero. So the new_num_str will not have leading zeros except if the new number is zero, but the first program's loop runs while x>0, so input zero is not processed. So the new_num_str will not have leading zeros.\n\n          Now, the code:\n\n          Here's the Fortran code:\n\n          program main\n              implicit none\n              character(len=200) :: input_str, new_num_str\n              integer :: len, i, j\n              integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n              logical :: has_A, has_B\n\n              !

So when forming new_num_str, the loop should go from j downto 1, but the digits array is filled up to j elements. So the loop is correct.\n\n          Also, in the loop for forming new_num_str, the loop is from j downto 1, and each iteration appends the current digit (digits(i)) as a character. So for example, if digits(1)=0 and digits(2)=1 (j=2), then i=2 gives digits(2)=1, then i=1 gives digits(1)=0 \u2192 the string becomes '1' then '10'.\n\n          That's correct.\n\n          Testing with input 19:\n\n          input_str is '19', len=2.\n\n          Processing i=2 (digit '9'):\n\n              r=9, nine_minus_r=0 <9 \u2192 yes.\n\n              i is not 1 (i=2), so add nine_minus_r (0). j becomes 1, digits(1)=0.\n\n          Then i=1 (digit '1'):\n\n              r=1, nine_minus_r=8 <1? 8 <1 \u2192 no (8 is not less than 1). So add r (1). j becomes 2, digits(2)=1.\n\n          So digits array has [0,1], j=2.\n\n          new_num_str is built by looping from 2 downto 1:\n\n              i=2 \u2192 char(1 +48) \u2192 '1', new_num_str is '1'\n\n              i=1 \u2192 char(0 +48) \u2192 '0', new_num_str becomes '10'.\n\n          Then check '10' for A and B \u2192 no \u2192 output 'No'.\n\n          Which is correct.\n\n          Another test case: input 'AB' \u2192 but the first program would read it as a number, which is invalid. But the problem states that the first program reads a long, so the input must be a valid number. So the code is correct for valid inputs.\n\n          Edge case: input '9' \u2192 new_num_str is '9' \u2192 no A/B \u2192 'No'.\n\n          So the code should work."
