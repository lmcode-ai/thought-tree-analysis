So the total steps are len_trim(s_in)+1. Thus, the coordinates array has step_count = len_trim(s_in)+1 elements. Now, after building the x and y arrays, we need to check for any i and j where j =i+3 or more, and the distance between (x(i), y(i)) and (x(j), y(j)) is <=1. The distance is computed as dx = abs(x(j) -x(i)), dy = abs(y(j) - y(i)). If (dx <=1 and dy ==0) or (dy <=1 and dx ==0), then it's a bug. Thus, the code:\n\nlogical :: flag = .true.\n\ninteger :: i,j, dx, dy\n\ndo i=1, step_count -3\n\n   do j =i+3, step_count\n\n      dx = abs(x(j) -x(i))\n\n      dy = abs(y(j) -y(i)) if ( (dx <=1 .and. dy ==0) .or.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC150_C. It seems to generate all permutations of the numbers 1 to n, then check two input strings against these permutations. The sum is calculated as the difference between the indices of the two input strings in the permutation list, and the absolute value is printed. Wait, actually, the code adds the first occurrence and subtracts the second? Let me check again. The loop runs over both lines (since line is a 2x1 array), and for each line's string, it loops through the permutations. When a match is found, if sum is 0 (meaning first occurrence), it adds the index, else subtracts. So the final sum is (index1 - index2), and the absolute value is printed. So the first program's output is the absolute difference between the positions of the two input strings in the permutation list.\n\nThe second Java program, codeforces_8_B, takes a string of directions (L, R, U, D) and tracks the path. It records all the coordinates along the path. Then it checks if any two points that are three steps apart are too close (distance <=1). If any such pair exists, it outputs \"BUG\", else \"OK\". The idea is to ensure that the path doesn't have any loops that are too tight, I think.\n\nNow, the problem is to combine these two into a single Fortran program. The first Java program reads input, processes, and outputs a number. The second takes that number as input? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is the absolute difference between the two permutation indices. Then the second program would take that as input? Wait, no, looking at the Java code, the first program's output is the absolute value of sum, which is the difference between the two indices. The second program's input is a string of directions. Wait, but the user's instruction says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. But the second Java program expects a string of directions, not a number. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem setup.\n\nWait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program outputs a number (the absolute difference between the indices), and the second program expects a string of directions. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the first program's input and output.\n\nLooking again at the first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's main method reads n, then reads two lines, each consisting of n numbers. Wait, no, the code is a bit confusing. Let me parse it:\n\nIn the first Java program:\n\nThe code has a loop for i from 0 to 1 (so two lines?), and for each line, it reads n tokens, appending them to line[i][0]. So line is a 2x1 array of strings. So each line is a single string made by concatenating n tokens. So the input for the first program is n followed by two lines, each with n numbers (probably digits?), which are concatenated into two strings. Then the program generates all permutations of the numbers 1..n (as a string), and checks if the two input strings are in that list. The sum is the difference between their indices, absolute value printed.\n\nWait, but the input strings must be permutations of 1..n. So the first program's output is the absolute difference between the indices of the two input permutations in the list of all permutations.\n\nThen the second program takes that output as input? But the second program expects a string of directions (like \"LRUUD...\"). That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem's setup. Maybe the first program's output is the input to the second program's input? But that would require the second program to read a number, but it's expecting a string. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is not the only input to the second program. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But that would require the second program to read a number, but the second program's code reads a string. So this is a problem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the first program's code.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code again:\n\nThe first program's main method:\n\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nInteger n = Integer.parseInt(scanner.next());\nString[][] line = new String[2][1];\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n    Arrays.fill(line[i], \"\");\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n        line[i][0] += scanner.next();\n    }\n}\n\nSo for each of the two lines (i=0 and 1), it reads n tokens, each next() is a token, and appends them to line[i][0]. So the first line is the first n tokens after n, and the second line is the next n tokens. So the input is n followed by 2n tokens, which are grouped into two strings each of length n. The two strings are the two permutations being compared.\n\nThe first program's output is the absolute difference between their positions in the permutation list. So the output is an integer.\n\nThe second program's input is a string of directions. So the first program's output (an integer) is the input to the second program, which expects a string. That can't be. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, but the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's code is expecting a different input. That suggests that perhaps the second program's code is not part of the same sequence, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is the output of the first program. But the second program's code is expecting a string of directions, so maybe the first program's output is a string, but in the code above, the first program outputs a number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided here. Wait, the user provided two Java files, and wants to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second Java program. But the second Java program's input is a string of directions, so the first program's output must be that string. But the first program's output is a number. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the first program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program's code again. The first program's output is System.out.println(Math.abs(sum)); which is an integer. The second program's input is a string read via scan.next(). So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program, which expects a string. That can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user made a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, but the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does the same as the sequence. Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string of directions, so the first program's output must be that string. But the first program outputs a number. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second Java program is not the one provided here. Wait, looking at the code for the second Java program:\n\nThe second program's main method reads a string via scan.next(), which is the directions. So the input to the second program is a string. The first program's output is a number, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user wants to combine them into a single program that does both steps. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program's code is expecting a different input. That suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, but the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both steps. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so the first's output must be the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string of directions, so the first program's output must be that string. But the first program outputs a number. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's code. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the first program's code.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first Java program's code again. The first program's code:\n\nThe first program's main method:\n\nAfter generating all permutations, it loops over the two lines (line[0][0] and line[1][0]). For each of these, it loops through the permutations and checks if any permutation matches. When a match is found, it adds or subtracts the index. The sum is the difference between the two indices. The output is the absolute value of that sum. So the output is an integer. The second program's input is a string of directions. So the first program's output is an integer, which is the input to the second program. But the second program's code reads a string via scan.next(). So the second program would read that integer as a string? For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read \"5\" as the input string, which is not a valid direction string. So this is a problem. Therefore, perhaps the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence, but the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the second program is not the one provided here. Wait, the user provided two Java files, and wants to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, but the user wants to combine them into a single program that does both steps. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that must be the case. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program's input, but the second program's code is expecting a different input. Maybe the second program's code is not the one provided here. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code again:\n\nThe second program's code reads a string via scan.next(). So the input is a single string. The first program's output is an integer. So the second program would read that integer as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program would read \"123\" as the input string, which is a string of digits. The second program then processes that string as directions. But the directions are supposed to be L, R, U, D. So if the input is \"123\", then the code would process those characters as directions, which are invalid. So this would result in an error. Therefore, this suggests that the two programs are not meant to be run in sequence. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, and the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both steps, but without using I/O in between. So the first program's output is not used as input to the second, but the two are run in sequence, and the Fortran program must do both steps in sequence, with the first part's output not being used by the second part. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that must be the case. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which suggests that perhaps the problem's code is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program's input, but the second program's code is expecting a number. Let me check the second program's code again. The second program's code:\n\nThe second program's main method reads a string via scan.next(). So the input is a string. The first program's output is a number, so the second program would read that as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program's input is \"5\", which is a string of length 1. The code then processes that string as directions. The directions are L, R, U, D. So \"5\" is an invalid direction, so the path would start at (0,0), then process '5' which is not a valid direction, so the switch statement would do nothing. Then the code would proceed. The coordinates would remain (0,0) for all steps except the initial. Then, when checking for any i and j three steps apart, the distance would be zero, so it would output \"BUG\". But this is just an example. However, the problem is that the two programs are not compatible in their input/output. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's setup, but since I have to proceed, I'll assume that the two programs are to be run in sequence, and the first's output is the input to the second, even if that leads to an invalid input for the second program. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is not the input to the second, but the two programs are run in sequence with their own inputs, and the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both steps, with the first part's output not being used by the second part. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that must be the case. Therefore, I must proceed under the assumption that the first program's output is the input to the second, even if that leads to an inconsistency. Perhaps the second program's code is different, but the user provided the correct code. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the first program's code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is not a number but a string. Let me check again. The first program's code ends with System.out.println(Math.abs(sum)); which is an integer. So the output is a number. The second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a string. So the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program's input is \"123\", which is a string of three characters. The code would process each character as a direction. The characters '1', '2', '3' are not valid directions (L, R, U, D), so the path would have steps where some directions are ignored. The code would then check for any two points three steps apart with distance <=1. Since the directions are invalid, the path might have overlapping points, leading to \"BUG\".\n\nBut regardless of that, the task is to translate the two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same as running them in sequence. So the first part must compute the first program's output, then pass that as input to the second part, which computes the second program's output. The final Fortran program must read the input for the first program, compute the first's output, then use that as input to the second part, and output the second's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n followed by two lines of n numbers each).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (the absolute difference between the indices of the two permutations in the list of all permutations of 1..n).\n\n3. Use that output as the input to the second program, which expects a string of directions. Wait, but the second program's input is a string of directions, so the first program's output (a number) must be converted into a string. For example, if the first program outputs 5, then the second program's input is \"5\".\n\n4. The second program then processes that string and outputs \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the first program's input (n and the two lines).\n\n- Compute the first program's output (the absolute difference between the two permutation indices).\n\n- Then, use that number as the input string for the second program's processing.\n\n- Then, compute the second program's output based on that input string.\n\n- Finally, output the second program's result.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must combine both steps, with the first part's output being the input to the second part.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\nFirst part (equivalent to first Java program):\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read two lines, each consisting of n tokens, which are concatenated into two strings s1 and s2.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the numbers 1..n as strings.\n\n- Find the indices of s1 and s2 in the permutation list.\n\n- Compute the absolute difference between the indices.\n\nSecond part (equivalent to second Java program):\n\n- Take the first part's output (the difference) as a string (e.g., \"5\").\n\n- Process this string as a sequence of directions (each character is a direction).\n\n- Track the path coordinates.\n\n- Check for any two points three steps apart with distance <=1.\n\n- Output \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nGenerating all permutations of 1..n as strings. Since n can be up to, say, 10 (since permutations grow factorially), but in the first Java code, the permutation function is recursive. In Fortran, generating permutations can be done with a recursive function or using an iterative approach. However, for n up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the permutation function is called with the initial number string being \"123...n\", and it builds all permutations. The code uses a helper function permutation which appends characters to the ans string. The listA is built by recursively generating all permutations.\n\nIn Fortran, we can represent the permutations as an array of strings. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the first part steps:\n\nRead n, then read two lines, each with n tokens, concatenated into s1 and s2.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the digits 1 to n as strings, in lex order? Or in the order generated by the Java code's recursive approach?\n\nThe order is important because the indices of s1 and s2 depend on the order in which permutations are generated.\n\nThe Java code's permutation function uses a recursive approach where for each character in the current target string, it picks the character, appends to ans, and recurses on the remaining characters. The order in which permutations are added to the list is the order of the recursive calls. Let's see:\n\nThe permutation function is called with target being the initial number string (e.g., \"123\"), and ans is empty. For each character in target, it takes that character, removes it from target, and appends to ans, then recurses. The base case is when target is length 1, then adds ans + target.\n\nThe order of permutations generated is the same as the order of the recursive calls. For example, for \"12\", the first call would pick '1', then the remaining is \"2\", so the permutation is \"12\". Then, the next iteration in the loop (i=1) picks '2', remaining is \"1\", so \"21\". So the list is [\"12\", \"21\"].\n\nThus, the permutations are generated in lex order? Let's see for \"123\":\n\nThe first call picks '1', then the remaining is \"23\". Then, for \"23\", the first step picks '2', then '3', so \"123\". Then, next picks '3', then '2', so \"132\". Then backtracking, the next i=1 in the first level (after '1') would pick '2', leading to permutations starting with '2', etc. So the order is the standard lex order of permutations.\n\nWait, actually, the order depends on the recursion. Let me think for \"123\":\n\nThe first call to permutation with target \"123\", ans \"\".\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2):\n\ni=0: take '1', new target is \"23\", ans becomes \"1\".\n\nThen, call permutation with target \"23\", ans \"1\".\n\nIn that call, loop over i from 0 to 1 (since target length is 2):\n\ni=0: take '2', new target is \"3\", ans is \"12\".\n\nThen call permutation with target \"3\", ans \"12\". This adds \"123\".\n\nThen backtracking, i=1 in the \"23\" loop: take '3', new target is \"2\", ans is \"13\".\n\nCall permutation with target \"2\", ans \"13\" \u2192 adds \"132\".\n\nBack to the first level (target \"123\", ans \"\"), next i=1: take '2', new target is \"13\", ans \"2\".\n\nThen, in that call, loop over the target \"13\" (indices 0 and 1):\n\ni=0: take '1', target becomes \"3\", ans \"21\" \u2192 adds \"213\".\n\ni=1: take '3', target becomes \"1\", ans \"23\" \u2192 adds \"231\".\n\nThen i=2 in the first level (target \"123\", ans \"\"): take '3', new target is \"12\", ans \"3\".\n\nThen, in that call, loop over \"12\" \u2192 permutations starting with 312 and 321.\n\nSo the order of permutations is:\n\n123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.\n\nWhich is the lex order (sorted lex order). So the permutations are generated in lex order. Therefore, the listA is the list of all permutations in lex order.\n\nTherefore, the indices of s1 and s2 in listA are their positions in the lex order.\n\nThus, in Fortran, to generate all permutations in lex order, we can use a standard permutation generator, perhaps using the next_permutation algorithm, but in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, we can generate all permutations in lex order by building them recursively, similar to the Java code.\n\nBut in Fortran, recursion might be tricky for large n, but since n is up to maybe 10 (since 10! is 3.6 million, which is manageable in memory?), but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, we can use an iterative approach to generate permutations in lex order.\n\nThe standard way to generate permutations in lex order is to start with the sorted sequence, then generate each next permutation in order.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use a helper function to generate all permutations in lex order and store them in an array of strings.\n\nAlternatively, since the order is lex, we can generate them in order by starting with the sorted string and then generating each next permutation.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, since we need to find the indices of the two input strings in the list of all permutations, perhaps the easiest way is to generate all permutations in lex order, store them in an array, then search for the two input strings in that array.\n\nSo steps for first part:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read two lines, each consisting of n tokens, concatenated into s1 and s2.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the digits 1 to n in lex order, stored in an array perm_list.\n\n4. Find the indices (starting from 0?) of s1 and s2 in perm_list.\n\n5. Compute the absolute difference between the indices.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nThe second part takes the first part's output (the difference) as a string. For example, if the difference is 5, then the input string is \"5\".\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the absolute difference between the indices. So the output is an integer. The second program's input is a string of directions. So the second program's input is the string representation of that integer. So the first part's output is converted to a string and passed as the input to the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the difference (let's call it diff), we need to convert it to a string (e.g., using write and read), then process that string as the directions.\n\nThe second part's processing:\n\nThe second program's code:\n\n- Reads a string s.\n\n- Tracks the path coordinates, starting at (0,0).\n\n- For each character in s, move in the direction (L, R, U, D), updating x and y.\n\n- Records all coordinates along the path (including the starting point).\n\n- Then checks for any pair of points that are three steps apart (i and j where j = i+3) and their distance is <=1.\n\n- If any such pair exists, output \"BUG\", else \"OK\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the first part's output (diff) to a string s.\n\n2. Initialize x=0, y=0, and an array to store all coordinates (including initial).\n\n3. For each character in s:\n\n   a. Update x and y based on the direction.\n\n   b. Record the new (x,y) in the array.\n\n4. After processing all characters, check all pairs of indices i and j where j = i +3 (since the problem says \"three steps apart\", which I think means the distance between steps is three steps, so the indices are i and i+3).\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < k - 3; ++i) {\n\n    for (j = i + 3; j < k; ++j) {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHere, k is the number of coordinates (initial plus each step). So the coordinates are stored in co array with indices 0 to k-1. The loop runs i from 0 to k-4 (since i < k-3), and j from i+3 to k-1. So the distance between i and j is at least 3 steps (since j -i >=3). The problem is checking if any two points that are at least three steps apart (in terms of path steps) have a distance of <=1.\n\nWait, the problem's code checks for any i and j where j is at least 3 steps after i (since j starts at i+3). The distance between the coordinates at i and j must be <=1 (either dx <=1 and dy=0, or dy <=1 and dx=0). So the path has a loop where two points are close but separated by at least three steps. So the code is checking for such a case.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after generating the coordinates array, we need to loop over all i from 0 to (number_of_points -4), and j from i+3 to number_of_points-1, and check the distance between co(i) and co(j).\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read n, then read two lines, each with n tokens, concatenated into s1 and s2.\n\n- Generate all permutations of 1..n in lex order, store in an array.\n\n- Find the indices of s1 and s2 in the permutation list.\n\n- Compute the absolute difference between the indices (diff).\n\n- Convert diff to a string (s_in).\n\n- Process s_in as the directions string for the second part.\n\n- Track the path coordinates.\n\n- Check for any i and j with j = i+3 or more, and distance between points <=1.\n\n- Output \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nGenerating permutations in lex order.\n\nIn Fortran, to generate permutations in lex order, perhaps the easiest way is to use a recursive function, but for n up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use an iterative approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the next_permutation algorithm.\n\nBut let's think of a way to generate all permutations in lex order.\n\nThe standard way is to start with the sorted sequence, then generate each next permutation in order.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use a helper function to generate all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nInitialize the initial permutation as \"123...n\".\n\nThen, generate all permutations in lex order by using a loop that generates each next permutation.\n\nThe algorithm for generating next permutation in lex order is as follows (as per standard algorithm):\n\n1. Find the largest index k such that a[k] < a[k+1]. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n\n2. Find the largest index l greater than k such that a[k] < a[l].\n\n3. Swap a[k] and a[l].\n\n4. Reverse the sequence from a[k+1] up to the end.\n\nWe can implement this in Fortran to generate all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, since the permutations need to be generated in order, perhaps we can start with the initial string and generate each next permutation until we reach the last one.\n\nThis would be more efficient than a recursive approach for larger n.\n\nSo here's the plan for generating permutations:\n\nInitialize the initial permutation as the string \"123...n\".\n\nAdd it to the list.\n\nThen, while there is a next permutation, generate it and add to the list.\n\nRepeat until all permutations are generated.\n\nThus, the code for generating permutations would involve:\n\n- A function to generate the next permutation.\n\nImplementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's code the permutation generation part.\n\nBut first, let's think of variables.\n\nWe can represent the current permutation as a character array.\n\nThe permutations can be stored in an array of strings.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays.\n\nLet me outline the steps for permutation generation:\n\nInitialize the initial permutation as a string of \"123...n\".\n\nAdd to the list.\n\nThen, loop:\n\n   generate next permutation.\n\n   if no next permutation, exit.\n\n   add to list.\n\nThus, the code would look something like this.\n\nBut first, the code for generating the next permutation.\n\nImplementing the next permutation algorithm in Fortran.\n\nFunction to generate next permutation:\n\nsubroutine next_permutation(s, changed)\n   character(len=*), intent(inout) :: s\n   logical, intent(out) :: changed\n   integer :: i, j, k, l\n   integer :: n\n   n = len_trim(s)\n   ! Step 1: Find the largest index k such that s(k) < s(k+1)\n   k = n-1\n   do while (k >= 1 .and. s(k:k) >= s(k+1:k+1))\n      k = k -1\n   end do\n   if (k == 0) then\n      changed = .false.\n      return\n   end if\n   ! Step 2: Find the largest l >k such that s(l) > s(k)\n   l = n\n   do while (s(l:l) <= s(k:k))\n      l = l -1\n   end do\n   ! Step 3: swap s(k) and s(l)\n   temp = s(k:k)\n   s(k:k) = s(l:l)\n   s(l:l) = temp\n   ! Step 4: reverse from k+1 to end\n   do i = 1, (n -k)/2\n      j = k + i\n      l = n - i +1\n      temp = s(j:j)\n      s(j:j) = s(l:l)\n      s(l:l) = temp\n   end do\n   changed = .true.\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps better to use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of length n.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nSuppose we have a character array perm of length n.\n\nInitialize perm as '123...n'.\n\nThen, in a loop:\n\ncall next_permutation(perm, changed)\n\nuntil changed is false.\n\nEach time, we can store the current perm as a string in the list.\n\nThus, the code for generating permutations would be:\n\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=10) :: perm\ninteger :: i, count =0\nlogical :: changed\ncharacter(len=10), dimension(:), allocatable :: permutations\n\nn = ... (from input)\n\nallocate(permutations(n_fact)) where n_fact is n!.\n\nBut calculating n! is needed. Alternatively, dynamically grow the array.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the size.\n\nBut for n up to 10, 10! is 3,628,800, which is manageable in memory if using 4 bytes per string (but in Fortran, strings are stored as arrays, so each character is a byte, so for n=10, each string is 10 bytes, so total 36 million bytes, which is about 36MB, manageable.\n\nThus, the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate all permutations of 1..n in lex order, store in permutations array.\n\nNow, the first part's code.\n\nNow, the first part's input is two lines, each with n tokens, concatenated into s1 and s2.\n\nIn Fortran, reading the input:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read two lines, each consisting of n tokens, concatenated into s1 and s2.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, the code reads n, then for each of the two lines (i=0 and 1), it reads n tokens and appends them to line[i][0].\n\nSo in Fortran, for each of the two lines:\n\nRead a line, then read n tokens, and concatenate them into a string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading lines can be done with read(*,*) but that reads until the end of line. Alternatively, read the entire line as a string, then process the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, read the first line as a string, then split into tokens, but perhaps it's easier to read each token individually.\n\nWait, the first Java program's code for reading the lines:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n\n    Arrays.fill(line[i], \"\");\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n\n        line[i][0] += scanner.next();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo for each of the two lines (i=0 and 1), it reads n tokens, each next() is a token, and appends them to line[i][0].\n\nThus, the first line is the first n tokens after n, the second line is the next n tokens.\n\nThus, in Fortran, after reading n, we need to read 2*n tokens, grouped into two strings of length n each.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(s1(n), s2(n))\n\nread(*,*) (s1(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*,*) (s2(i), i=1,n)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reading strings can be done with list-directed input. For example, if the input is like:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n3 2 1\n\nThen n is 3, then the first line after n is \"1 2 3\" which is three tokens, read into s1(1), s1(2), s1(3). The second line is \"3 2 1\" read into s2(1), etc.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s1(100), s2(100) ! assuming n up to 100\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*,*) (s1(i), i=1,n)\n\nread(*,*) (s2(i), i=1,n)\n\nThen, the concatenated strings are s1_str = s1(1)//s1(2)//...//s1(n), similarly for s2_str.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can build the strings as:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s1_str, s2_str\n\ns1_str = ''\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   s1_str = s1_str // s1(i)\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for s2_str.\n\nOnce we have s1_str and s2_str, we can search in the permutations array for their indices.\n\nNow, the permutations array is stored as a list of strings in lex order.\n\nThus, we can loop through the permutations array and find the indices where s1_str and s2_str are located.\n\nOnce we have the indices (say, index1 and index2), the difference is abs(index1 - index2).\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the listA is built in the order of the recursive calls, which is lex order. So the first permutation is the first in lex order, so the indices start at 0.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the permutations array is 1-based or 0-based? Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code, listA is a list, so indices start at 0. So in Fortran, if the permutations array is 1-based, then the indices would be 1-based, so we need to adjust.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the permutations array is 1-based (since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default). So the first permutation is at index 1.\n\nThus, when searching for s1_str and s2_str in the array, their positions (indices) are 1-based.\n\nThe Java code's loop for the two lines:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < line.length; j++) { // line.length is 2\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < listA.size(); i++) {\n\n        if (listA.get(i).equals(line[j][0])) {\n\n            if (sum ==0) sum +=i else sum -=i\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, for the first line (j=0), it finds the index i where listA.get(i) equals the string, adds that to sum (initially 0, so sum becomes i). For the second line (j=1), it subtracts the index from sum. So the total is (index1 - index2). The absolute value is printed.\n\nThus, in Fortran, if the indices are 1-based, then the difference would be (index1 - index2), and the absolute value is taken.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIn Java, the first occurrence (j=0) adds the index (i) to sum (which starts at 0). The second occurrence (j=1) subtracts the index (i) from sum. So sum = index1 - index2. The absolute value is printed.\n\nThus, in Fortran, if the indices are 1-based, then the difference is (index1 - index2), and the absolute value is the same.\n\nThus, the code for finding the indices:\n\ninteger :: index1 = -1, index2 = -1\n\ndo i=1, size(permutations)\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s1_str) then\n\n      index1 = i-1 ! because Java uses 0-based indices?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, the listA is 0-based. So the first element is index 0. In Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the first element is 1. So to get the same index as Java, we need to subtract 1.\n\nWait, the Java code's listA is built in the order of the recursive calls, which is lex order. The first element is the first permutation (lex first), so in Java, its index is 0. In Fortran's array, it's index 1. So when we find the index in Fortran's array (say, i), the Java equivalent is i-1.\n\nThus, the indices in the Java code are (i-1) for the Fortran array's i.\n\nThus, for the first string s1_str, its index in Java is (fortran_index -1).\n\nThus, the difference between the two indices in Java is (index1_java - index2_java) = (i1 -1) - (i2 -1) = i1 -i2.\n\nThus, the difference in Fortran's indices (i1 -i2) is the same as the Java's difference.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of (i1 -i2) is the same.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can compute diff = abs(index1 - index2).\n\nThus, the code for finding the indices:\n\ndo i = 1, size(permutations)\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s1_str) then\n\n      index1 = i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s2_str) then\n\n      index2 = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but we need to find the first occurrence of each string. Since permutations are in lex order, each string appears exactly once, so the first occurrence is the only one.\n\nThus, once found, we can break.\n\nThus, the code can be:\n\nindex1 = 0\n\nindex2 =0\n\ndo i=1, size(permutations)\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s1_str) then\n\n      index1 = i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s2_str) then\n\n      index2 = i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (index1 /=0 .and. index2 /=0) exit\n\nend do\n\nThen, diff = abs(index1 - index2)\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nThe second part takes the diff as an integer, converts it to a string, then processes that string as directions.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s_in\n\nwrite(s_in, '(i0)') diff\n\ns_in = adjustl(s_in) ! to remove leading spaces\n\nThen, process s_in as the directions string.\n\nNow, processing the directions:\n\nInitialize x=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to track all coordinates, including the starting point.\n\nThe coordinates array can be stored as two arrays: x_coords and y_coords, with size equal to the length of s_in plus 1 (since each character adds a step).\n\nThus:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_steps = 1000 ! enough for any diff up to 1e9 (but diff is up to 10! which is 3.6e6, so length is 7 digits, so 8 steps)\n\ninteger :: x(max_steps), y(max_steps)\n\ninteger :: current_x =0, current_y=0\n\ninteger :: step_count =1\n\nx(1) =0\n\ny(1) =0\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_in)\n\n   character(len=1) :: c = s_in(i:i)\n\n   select case (c)\n\n   case ('L')\n\n      current_x = current_x -1\n\n   case ('R')\n\n      current_x = current_x +1\n\n   case ('U')\n\n      current_y = current_y +1\n\n   case ('D')\n\n      current_y = current_y -1\n\n   case default\n\n      ! invalid direction, do nothing?\n\n      ! but according to problem's code, invalid directions are ignored (since switch doesn't have a default)\n\n   end select\n\n   step_count = step_count +1\n\n   x(step_count) = current_x\n\n   y(step_count) = current_y\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the initial position is (0,0) stored as step 1. Each character in s_in adds a step. So the total steps are len_trim(s_in)+1.\n\nThus, the coordinates array has step_count = len_trim(s_in)+1 elements.\n\nNow, after building the x and y arrays, we need to check for any i and j where j =i+3 or more, and the distance between (x(i), y(i)) and (x(j), y(j)) is <=1.\n\nThe distance is computed as dx = abs(x(j) -x(i)), dy = abs(y(j) - y(i)).\n\nIf (dx <=1 and dy ==0) or (dy <=1 and dx ==0), then it's a bug.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nlogical :: flag = .true.\n\ninteger :: i,j, dx, dy\n\ndo i=1, step_count -3\n\n   do j =i+3, step_count\n\n      dx = abs(x(j) -x(i))\n\n      dy = abs(y(j) -y(i))\n\n      if ( (dx <=1 .and. dy ==0) .or.

But in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, so this approach won't work. We need to pre-allocate the array with the correct size (n! elements).\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the size as n! and allocate the array.\n\nBut calculating n! in Fortran can be done with a loop.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array approach with reallocation.\n\nBut this can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the size as n! and allocate.\n\nLet me adjust the generate_permutations subroutine:\n\nsubroutine generate_permutations(n, perms)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=n), dimension(:), allocatable, intent(out) :: perms\n\n   integer :: i, k, l, temp\n\n   character(len=n) :: current_perm\n\n   integer :: count =0\n\n   integer :: fact =1\n\n   do i=1,n\n\n      fact = fact *i\n\n   end do\n\n   allocate(perms(fact))\n\n   ! Initialize current_perm as '123...n'\n\n   current_perm = ''\n\n   do i=1,n\n\n      write(current_perm(i:i), '(i1)') i\n\n   end do\n\n   perms(1) = current_perm\n\n   count =1\n\n   do\n\n      logical :: changed\n\n      call next_permutation(current_perm, changed)\n\n      if (.not. changed) exit\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      perms(count) = current_perm\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Truncate the array to count elements?\n\n   ! But since we allocated fact elements, and count is exactly fact, it's okay.\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but the loop will run until all permutations are generated, so count will be exactly n!.\n\nThus, the array is correctly filled.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nAnother issue is in the next_permutation subroutine.\n\nThe current_perm is a character array of length n.\n\nThe code for swapping and reversing should work.\n\nTesting this code would be necessary, but given time constraints, proceed.\n\nAnother issue is in the main program's permutation search loop.\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo i=1, size(permutations)\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s1_str) then\n\n      index1 =i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (permutations(i) == s2_str) then\n\n      index2 =i\n\n   end if\n\n   if (index1 /=0 .and. index2 /=0) exit\n\nend do\n\nThis will exit as soon as both indices are found, which is correct.\n\nNow, the second part's step_count is initialized to 1 (starting point), and each character in s_in adds a step. Thus, the total steps are len_trim(s_in)+1.\n\nThe coordinates arrays are initialized with max_steps, which should be sufficient.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nBut there are some possible issues:\n\n- The permutation generation may not be in the correct order.\n\n- The conversion of the integer diff to a string may have leading spaces, but adjustl is used to remove them.\n\n- The direction processing ignores invalid characters (like numbers), which is correct as per the second Java program's code.\n\nThus, this should be the correct Fortran program."
