So the user's instruction is to chain the two programs, so the first's output is the second's input. So the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as input to the second's processing.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC029_C). It reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. Then it uses a binary search to find the minimum possible value of k where some condition is met. The condition is checked in the isPossible method, which involves a TreeMap. The TreeMap is used to track counts of certain values, and the logic there is a bit complex. The output is the value of ok after the binary search.\n\nThe second Java file (codeforces_59_A) reads a word and converts it to uppercase or lowercase based on which case has more letters. If equal, it converts to lowercase.\n\nThe key here is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (the ok value) is the input to the second program's word. Wait, but the second program expects a word, not a number. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Wait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program outputs a number (ok), and the second expects a word. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's solve method, it prints ok, which is an integer. The second program reads a word from input. So the first program's output is a number, but the second expects a word. That's a contradiction. Unless the first program's output is a string that represents a word? Wait, no. The first program's output is the value of ok, which is an integer. The second program expects a single word as input. So how can the first's output be the second's input? Unless the first's output is a word? Wait, no. The first program's output is the ok value, which is an integer. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the two Java programs are supposed to be run in sequence, but their outputs and inputs are connected. Let me think again. The first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a word. That doesn't align. Unless the first program's output is a string that is a word. Wait, looking at the first program's code again: the output is System.out.println(ok); where ok is an integer. So the first program's output is a number. The second program reads a word. So unless the first program's output is a number that is treated as a word, but that's not possible. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the two programs are not connected in the way I thought. Maybe the user provided two separate programs, but the actual problem requires combining them into a single Fortran program that does both steps in sequence, with the first's output being the input to the second. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a number, and the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would take \"5\" as the word, and process it. But in that case, the second program would count uppercase and lowercase letters in \"5\", which has none, so it would output lowercase \"5\". But that's a bit odd, but possible. So the user's instruction is to chain the two programs, so the first's output is the second's input. So the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that as input to the second's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (n and array a), compute the ok value, then use that ok value as the input to the second Java program's processing (which expects a word). Wait, but the second program's input is a word. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the second program would read that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs \"123\", the second would process \"123\" as the word, which has all lowercase letters (since digits are lowercase?), so it would output \"123\" in lowercase (which is the same). So the final output would be the same as the first's output. But that's possible. So the overall effect is that the first program's output is passed to the second, which may or may not change it. But the user wants the entire sequence translated into a single Fortran program that does the same.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first process the first part (the first Java program's logic), then take its output (the ok value) as the input to the second part (the second Java program's logic). The final output is the result of the second program's processing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (n and array a).\n2. Compute the ok value (the first program's result).\n3. Use that ok value as the input to the second program (i.e., treat it as a string word).\n4. Process that word according to the second program's logic.\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first part's result, then process that result as the input to the second part.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first program reads n, then an array of n integers. Then it does a binary search to find the minimal k where isPossible(k) is true. The isPossible function uses a TreeMap, which in Java is a sorted map. The logic in isPossible is a bit involved. Let's see:\n\nThe TreeMap s is used to track counts of certain values. The code in isPossible:\n\n- s is cleared.\n- current starts at 0.\n- For each ai in a:\n   if ai <= current:\n      if k ==1, return false.\n      while the last key in s is >= ai, remove those entries.\n      p = ai-1\n      loop:\n         if p <0, return false.\n         get the count for p (default 0) +1. If that count reaches k, remove p and decrement p. Else, break.\n   current is set to ai.\n- return true.\n\nHmm, the TreeMap in Java is ordered, so the lastKey is the largest key present. So in Fortran, we need to replicate this logic. Since TreeMap is a sorted map, perhaps in Fortran we can use an array or a list to track the keys and their counts, maintaining them in order. Alternatively, since the keys are integers, perhaps we can use an array where the index is the key, but that might be memory-intensive if the keys are large. Alternatively, since the keys are up to ai-1, which can be up to the maximum a[i], but in the problem's constraints, perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a list of pairs (key, count), and keep it sorted. But in Fortran, dynamic data structures are not straightforward. This might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to represent the TreeMap's operations in a way that can be handled with arrays. Let's think about the operations:\n\nIn isPossible(k):\n\n- s is cleared (so all entries are removed)\n- For each ai in a:\n   if ai <= current:\n      if k ==1, return false\n      while the last entry in s has key >= ai, remove it.\n      p = ai-1\n      then, we need to track the count for p. The loop:\n         sp = s.get(p, 0) +1\n         if sp ==k, then remove p and set p = p-1, and repeat.\n         else, set s(p) = sp and break.\n\nWait, the loop continues until the count doesn't reach k. So for p, we increment its count, and if it reaches k, we remove it and decrement p, then repeat with the new p.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nThe process for p is:\n\nWe start with p = ai-1.\n\nWe check the current count of p (initially 0?), add 1. If that count reaches k, then we remove p (since count is now k, so we remove it and p becomes p-1, and repeat.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nint sp = s.getOrDefault(p, 0) +1;\ns.put(p, sp);\nif (sp ==k) {\n   s.remove(p);\n   p--;\n} else {\n   break;\n}\n\nWait, but this is in a while loop? Wait, the code is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n   if (p <0) return false;\n   int sp = s.getOrDefault(p,0)+1;\n   s.put(p, sp);\n   if (sp ==k) {\n      s.remove(p);\n      p--;\n   } else {\n      break;\n   }\n}\n\nSo the loop continues as long as after incrementing the count, it reaches k. So for example, if p's count was k-1, adding 1 makes it k, so we remove it and decrement p, then repeat the loop with p-1.\n\nThis continues until either p <0 (return false) or the count doesn't reach k.\n\nHmm, so the process is to keep moving left (decrementing p) as long as the count at p reaches k, effectively \"clearing\" those positions and moving to the next lower p.\n\nThis is a bit complex. To implement this in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array to track the counts. Since the keys can be up to the maximum possible ai-1, which could be up to, say, 1e9 (if the input allows), but maybe the problem constraints have a limit. Wait, the original problem (AGC029_C) might have constraints on the input. Let me check the problem's constraints. Since the user hasn't provided them, but given that it's an AtCoder problem, perhaps the n is up to 2e5, and a[i] up to 1e9. But in that case, using an array for counts would be impossible due to memory. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys in the TreeMap are only up to the current ai-1, which is part of the array a. Since the array a is processed in order, perhaps the keys are within the range of the a array's elements. But even so, if a has elements up to 1e9, an array is not feasible.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So in Fortran, how can we handle this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as a list of pairs (key, count), kept in sorted order. Since in Java, TreeMap is ordered, so the keys are in order. So in Fortran, we can have an array of key and count, and keep it sorted. But inserting and removing elements would be O(n) time, which might be manageable if the number of elements is small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in a way that avoids needing a TreeMap. Let me think about the logic again.\n\nThe isPossible function's logic:\n\nThe TreeMap s is used to track the counts of certain positions. The process for each ai:\n\nIf ai <= current (which is the previous ai), then:\n\n- We need to check if k is 1. If so, return false (since we can't have any elements here? Not sure why, but the code says so).\n\nThen, we remove all entries in s where the key is >= ai. Because the TreeMap is sorted, the last entries are the largest keys. So we can remove them until the last key is less than ai.\n\nThen, set p = ai-1. Then, we loop:\n\n- Check if p is <0, return false.\n\n- Get the current count of p (default 0) +1. If that count equals k, then we remove p from the map and decrement p, and repeat.\n\n- Else, set the count to sp and break.\n\nThe goal is to track how many times each p has been \"selected\" in this way, and if any reach k, they are removed and we move to p-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key here is that each time we process ai, we are trying to place a \"block\" of size k starting at p=ai-1, but if that position is already filled to k, we have to move left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the TreeMap is used to track the current counts of positions, and whenever a position reaches k, it's removed and the next position to the left is considered.\n\nThis seems like a greedy approach where we are trying to place \"tokens\" in positions, but each position can hold up to k-1 tokens. Once it reaches k, it's removed, and the next position to the left is considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as a list of intervals or something else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the TreeMap can be represented as an array where the indices are the keys, but given the possible size, this might not be feasible. So perhaps in Fortran, we can use a dynamic array approach with linked lists, but Fortran doesn't have built-in linked lists. Alternatively, use an array of structures, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in a way that allows us to track the necessary information without a TreeMap. Let me think of the problem's logic again.\n\nThe binary search is looking for the minimal k where the condition is met. The condition is that the process can be done with k.\n\nThe process for each ai:\n\nIf ai is less than or equal to the current position (current), then we need to \"reset\" the current position to ai, but also manage the counts in s.\n\nWait, perhaps the TreeMap s is tracking the positions where we have placed some \"markers\" with counts. The idea is that when we encounter an ai that is less than or equal to current, we have to \"reset\" the current to ai, but also process the previous markers.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should try to find an alternative way to represent the TreeMap's operations in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as an array of counts, but with a maximum possible key. However, given that the a array can have elements up to 1e9, this is not feasible. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the keys in the TreeMap are only up to the maximum element in the array a. Let's see:\n\nThe p is set to ai-1, which is at most (max a[i])-1. So if the maximum a[i] is, say, 1e5, then an array of size 1e5 would be manageable. But if the a[i] can be up to 1e9, then this is impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's constraints on the first Java program (AGC029_C) have a limit on the a[i] values. Since it's an AtCoder problem, maybe the constraints are manageable. Let me check the problem's constraints (even though I can't see them, but maybe I can infer).\n\nLooking at the code, the array a is read as integers. The binary search is between 0 and n. The isPossible function's loop runs through all elements of a. The TreeMap operations are O(log n) per insertion, but in the worst case, for each ai, the while loop could take O(log n) steps. So the total time is O(n log n) per isPossible, and the binary search is O(log n) steps, so overall O(n (log n)^2). So for n up to 2e5, this would be acceptable. But in Fortran, if we can't use a TreeMap, perhaps we can find a way to represent the counts with an array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as a list of key-value pairs, kept in sorted order. Each time we need to access the last key, we can just check the last element of the list. When we need to remove entries with key >= ai, we can iterate from the end backwards and remove those entries until the last key is less than ai. Similarly, when adding p, we can insert it into the list in the correct position to maintain sorted order.\n\nThis approach would be O(n) for each such operation, but given that the binary search is O(log n) steps and each isPossible is O(n) steps, this might be manageable for small n, but for large n (like 2e5), this would be O(n^2), which is too slow. However, the original Java code uses a TreeMap which is O(log n) per operation, so perhaps the problem expects an O(n log n) solution, which would be feasible in Fortran with the same approach.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, implementing a sorted list with efficient insertion and deletion is challenging. Maybe we can use an array and keep it sorted, but inserting and deleting elements would require shifting elements, leading to O(n) time per insertion/deletion. That would be too slow for large n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to represent the TreeMap's operations. Let me think again about the logic in isPossible.\n\nThe TreeMap s is used to track counts of certain positions. The key is the position, and the value is the count. The operations are:\n\n1. Clear the TreeMap (set all counts to zero? Or remove all entries).\n\n2. For each ai in a:\n\n   a. If ai <= current:\n\n      i. If k ==1, return false.\n\n      ii. Remove all entries in s where key >= ai. (Because the TreeMap is sorted, this can be done by iterating from the end until the key is less than ai.)\n\n      iii. Set p = ai-1.\n\n      iv. Loop:\n\n         - If p <0, return false.\n\n         - Get the current count of p (default 0) +1.\n\n         - If the new count equals k, then remove p from the map and set p = p-1.\n\n         - Else, set the count to the new value and break.\n\n      v. current = ai.\n\n   b. Else:\n\n      current = ai.\n\nThe key here is that after processing ai, current is set to ai. So the current is the last ai processed.\n\nThe TreeMap s is only modified when ai <= current (i.e., when the current is not increasing). In such cases, we have to process the p = ai-1 and possibly previous positions.\n\nThe main challenge is efficiently managing the TreeMap's entries.\n\nHmm, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as an array where the indices are the keys, but only for the keys that are present. Since the keys are up to the maximum ai-1, which could be large, but maybe in practice, the number of keys is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are only those that are less than the current ai. Since each time we process ai, we remove all keys >= ai, so the keys in s are always less than ai. So when processing the next ai, which could be larger, those keys are still valid.\n\nWait, but the next ai could be smaller than the previous ai, so the keys in s could be larger than the new ai, requiring another removal step.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part (the first Java program) needs to be translated into Fortran. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Perform a binary search between ng=0 and ok=n to find the minimal k where isPossible(k) is true.\n\n3. The isPossible function must be implemented.\n\nImplementing isPossible in Fortran:\n\nThe TreeMap s can be represented as an array of counts, but with dynamic size. Alternatively, since the keys can be up to the maximum a[i], perhaps we can pre-allocate an array of size max_a, but that's only feasible if max_a is small.\n\nAlternatively, since the keys are only those that are less than the current ai, and the process involves removing keys >= ai each time, perhaps the keys are always less than the current ai. Wait, but when processing ai, after removing keys >= ai, the remaining keys are less than ai. Then, when we set p = ai-1, which is less than ai, so adding p to the map is okay. But in the next steps, if the next ai is smaller than the current ai, then the keys in s could be larger than the new ai, so we have to remove those again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the keys in s are always less than the current ai. Because whenever we process an ai, we first remove all keys >= ai. So after that step, the keys in s are all less than ai. Then, when we set p = ai-1, which is less than ai, so adding it to s is okay. So the keys in s are always less than the current ai.\n\nWait, but the next ai could be smaller than the previous ai. For example, suppose the current ai is 5, and the next ai is 3. Then, when processing the next ai (3), we first remove all keys in s >=3. Since the previous keys were all less than 5, but some could be >=3, so those are removed. Then, p becomes 2, and so on.\n\nSo the keys in s are always less than the current ai being processed. So the maximum possible key in s is the previous ai minus 1, but when the next ai is smaller, the keys could be up to the new ai-1.\n\nHmm, but the keys can be as low as 0 (since p can be down to 0). So the keys can range from 0 up to the maximum ai-1.\n\nBut if the a array has elements up to 1e9, then an array of size 1e9 is impossible. So this approach won't work.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way to represent the TreeMap's operations without needing to track every possible key.\n\nLooking at the loop in isPossible's processing of p:\n\nThe loop for p is:\n\np starts at ai-1.\n\nWe check if p <0 \u2192 return false.\n\nThen, get the current count of p (default 0) +1 \u2192 sp.\n\nIf sp ==k \u2192 remove p from the map, set p = p-1, and repeat.\n\nElse \u2192 set the count to sp and break.\n\nThis loop continues until either p <0 or the count doesn't reach k.\n\nThe effect of this loop is that we are trying to place a \"token\" at position p. If that position already has k-1 tokens, adding one more makes it k, so we remove it and try to place the token at p-1. This continues until we find a position that can take the token without reaching k.\n\nThis is similar to a carry-over in arithmetic. For example, if each position can hold up to k-1 tokens, and when it reaches k, it overflows to the next lower position.\n\nThis is reminiscent of a number in base k, where each digit can be 0 to k-1, and when adding 1, it carries over.\n\nAh! This is a key insight. The TreeMap s is essentially tracking the \"digits\" of a number in base k, where each digit represents the count of tokens at that position. When adding a token to position p, if it overflows (reaches k), it is carried over to p-1.\n\nTherefore, the TreeMap s can be represented as a list of positions where the count is non-zero, and each count is less than k. The process of adding a token to p is equivalent to incrementing the digit at p, and if it reaches k, it is set to 0 and the digit at p-1 is incremented, and so on.\n\nThis is exactly how numbers are represented in base k. So the TreeMap s is essentially the digits of a number in base k, where each digit is the count of tokens at that position, and the digits are stored in a way that allows efficient access and modification.\n\nTherefore, the TreeMap can be represented as an array where the indices are the positions (keys), and the values are the counts. However, since the positions can be large, we need a way to store only the non-zero digits.\n\nAlternatively, since the positions are processed in a way that they are always less than the current ai, and the current ai is non-decreasing? Wait no, the current is set to ai each time, so if the next ai is smaller than the previous, current can decrease.\n\nHmm, but the positions in the TreeMap are always less than the current ai. So when processing ai, the current is set to ai, so the next ai can be smaller, but the keys in the TreeMap are all less than the previous ai, but not necessarily the new ai.\n\nWait, but when processing the next ai (smaller than previous), we first remove all keys in s >= ai. So the remaining keys are less than ai. So the keys are always less than the current ai.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible key in s is the current ai minus 1. Since the current ai can be as small as 0 (if the next ai is 0), but in practice, the keys are non-negative.\n\nThis suggests that the keys in s are always less than the current ai, which is the last element processed. So the keys are always in the range [0, current_ai -1].\n\nBut the current_ai can be as small as 0, but in that case, the next ai can't be smaller than that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum key in s is up to the maximum ai in the array. But if the array has elements up to 1e9, this is still a problem.\n\nWait, but the process of adding p = ai-1, and then possibly moving to p-1, etc., means that the keys added are up to ai-1. So the maximum key added is the maximum ai-1. So if the array a has elements up to M, then the maximum key is M-1. So if M is up to 1e9, this is still not feasible for an array.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the problem has constraints that limit the maximum a[i] to a manageable size. For example, maybe in the problem's constraints, a[i] is up to 1e5 or something. But since the user hasn't provided the constraints, I have to proceed with the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the TreeMap's keys in a way that only tracks the necessary positions. Since the process of adding p and carrying over to p-1 can be represented as a linked list or a stack-like structure.\n\nWait, the process of adding a token to p and carrying over is similar to a stack where each carry propagates to the left. So perhaps we can represent the TreeMap as a list of positions and their counts, but only those positions that have a count greater than zero. Since each time we add a token to p, we might have to carry over to p-1, which could be already in the list or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the TreeMap as a list of intervals or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TreeMap can be represented as an array of counts, but with a dynamic size. In Fortran, we can use an array with a large enough size, but that depends on the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the maximum possible key. Let me think of the worst case: the array a is strictly decreasing. For example, a = [n, n-1, ..., 1]. Then, each step would process p = ai-1, which is n-1, n-2, etc. So the keys would be all from 0 to n-1. So the maximum key is n-1. So if n is up to 2e5, then an array of size 2e5 would be manageable.\n\nAh! That's a key point. The maximum possible key in the TreeMap s is the maximum ai-1. Since the array a has n elements, the maximum ai can be up to n (if the first element is n). So the maximum key would be n-1. Therefore, the array can be of size n, which is manageable for n up to 2e5.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the first element of a is n. Then, when processing it, since current starts at 0, ai (n) is greater than current (0), so no processing in the if block. current becomes n.\n\nNext element, say n-1. Then ai (n-1) is less than current (n). So we enter the if block.\n\nWe check if k ==1 \u2192 if so, return false.\n\nThen, we remove all entries in s with key >= ai (n-1). Since s was empty before, nothing is removed.\n\nThen p = ai-1 = n-2.\n\nWe enter the loop:\n\nsp = s(p) +1 (initially 0+1=1). If k is say 2, then sp is 1 <2 \u2192 set s(p)=1 and break.\n\nSo the key n-2 is added.\n\nNext element, say n-2. Then ai is n-2, which is less than current (n). So again, process:\n\nremove keys >= ai (n-2). The current s has key n-2? No, because when we processed the previous ai (n-1), we set p to n-2, so s(n-2) is 1. So when processing ai =n-2, we first remove all keys >= ai (n-2). So the entry at n-2 is removed.\n\nThen p = ai-1 = n-3.\n\nThen, sp = s(n-3) +1 (0+1=1). If k=2, then set to 1, etc.\n\nSo the maximum key added is n-2, then n-3, etc. So the maximum key is n-1 (when the first element is n).\n\nTherefore, the maximum key needed is n-1. So the array can be of size n.\n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. The maximum possible key in the TreeMap s is n-1. Because the first element of a can be up to n (if the input allows), and then the p would be n-1. So the array can be of size n, which is manageable.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can represent the TreeMap s as an array of size n, where s(p) holds the count for position p. Since the maximum p is n-1, the array can be of size n.\n\nThis is a game-changer. So the array can be declared as an integer array of size n, initialized to zero. Then, whenever we need to access or modify s(p), we can use this array.\n\nNow, the steps for implementing isPossible in Fortran:\n\nFunction isPossible(k):\n\n   Initialize an array s(0:n-1) to 0.\n\n   current = 0\n\n   for each ai in a:\n\n      if ai <= current:\n\n         if k ==1 then return .false.\n\n         ! Remove all entries in s with key >= ai.\n\n         ! Since the keys are up to current (which was previous ai), but now ai is smaller.\n\n         ! So we need to set s(p) =0 for all p >= ai.\n\n         ! Wait, but how?\n\n         ! The previous entries in s could have keys up to current (previous ai), but now we need to remove all keys >= ai.\n\n         ! So for all p from ai to current (previous current?), set s(p) =0.\n\n         ! Wait, but current is now being set to ai, but before that, we have to process the removal.\n\n         ! Wait, the current is the previous ai. So before processing this ai, current is the previous ai.\n\n         ! So the keys in s are all less than the previous current (since we removed keys >= previous ai each time).\n\n         ! Now, the new ai is less than or equal to previous current.\n\n         ! So to remove all keys >= ai, we need to set s(p) =0 for all p >= ai.\n\n         ! Because the current s contains keys up to previous current-1, but some of them may be >= ai.\n\n         ! So loop from p = ai to n-1:\n\n         do p = ai, n-1\n\n             s(p) = 0\n\n         end do\n\n         ! Now, set p = ai-1\n\n         p = ai -1\n\n         if (p <0) then\n\n             return .false.\n\n         end if\n\n         ! Now, loop to process p:\n\n         do\n\n             sp = s(p) +1\n\n             if (sp ==k) then\n\n                 s(p) =0\n\n                 p = p-1\n\n                 if (p <0) then\n\n                     return .false.\n\n                 end if\n\n             else\n\n                 s(p) = sp\n\n                 exit\n\n             end if\n\n         end do\n\n      end if\n\n      current = ai\n\n   end do\n\n   return .true.\n\nWait, but this is not exactly correct. Because the previous entries in s may have keys less than ai, but after removing all keys >= ai, we set those to zero. But the loop for p from ai to n-1 sets s(p) to zero. That's correct.\n\nThen, the p starts at ai-1, and we process it.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the TreeMap's entries are only those with non-zero counts. So when we set s(p) to zero, it's equivalent to removing the entry.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nNow, the problem is that in the original code, the TreeMap is cleared at the beginning of isPossible. So in Fortran, we can just set all elements of s to zero before starting.\n\nWait, no. The original code does s.clear() at the beginning of isPossible. So in Fortran, before processing each ai, the array s is initialized to zero. Wait no, the function isPossible is called with s being cleared first. So in the Fortran code, the array s should be initialized to zero at the start of isPossible.\n\nYes. So in the Fortran function isPossible, we first set all elements of s to zero.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the array s is initialized to zero at the start of isPossible. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the loop for removing keys >= ai:\n\nIn the original code, the while loop removes entries from the TreeMap where the key is >= ai. Since the TreeMap is sorted, this can be done by iterating from the end. In the Fortran approach, we can simply set all s(p) for p >= ai to zero. Because those keys are now removed.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the processing of p = ai-1:\n\nWe loop until we can place the token without reaching k.\n\nThe loop in Fortran would be a do-while loop. Let's see:\n\np = ai-1\n\nif (p <0) return .false.\n\ndo\n\n   sp = s(p) +1\n\n   if (sp ==k) then\n\n       s(p) =0\n\n       p = p-1\n\n       if (p <0) then\n\n           return .false.\n\n       end if\n\n   else\n\n       s(p) = sp\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis loop continues until sp !=k. So this should work.\n\nNow, the binary search part:\n\nThe binary search in the solve function is between ng=0 and ok=n. The loop continues while ok - ng >1. The midpoint is (ng+ok)/2. If isPossible(k) is true, set ok=k else ng=k.\n\nThe initial values are ng=0 and ok=n.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial ok is set to n. But in the problem's context, what is the maximum possible k? The binary search is looking for the minimal k where isPossible(k) is true. The maximum possible k is n, perhaps?\n\nYes, because the worst case is when each element requires a separate group, so k could be up to n.\n\nSo the binary search is correct.\n\nNow, the second Java program (codeforces_59_A) reads a word and converts it to uppercase or lowercase based on the majority of uppercase vs lowercase letters. If equal, lowercase.\n\nThe input to this program is the output of the first program, which is an integer ok. So the input to the second program is the string representation of ok. For example, if the first program outputs 123, the second program reads \"123\" as the word.\n\nIn Fortran, the second part can be handled by taking the string representation of the first program's output (ok), then counting uppercase and lowercase letters, then outputting accordingly.\n\nSo the steps for the entire Fortran program are:\n\n1. Read n and the array a.\n\n2. Compute the ok value via the binary search and isPossible function.\n\n3. Convert ok to a string (word).\n\n4. Count uppercase and lowercase letters in the word.\n\n5. Output the word in lowercase or uppercase based on the counts.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nWe need to read n, then read n integers into an array a.\n\nThen perform the binary search.\n\nThe isPossible function is a function that takes k and returns a logical.\n\nThe binary search loop:\n\ninteger :: ng =0, ok =n\n\ndo while (ok - ng >1)\n\n   k = (ng + ok)/2\n\n   if (isPossible(k)) then\n\n       ok =k\n\n   else\n\n       ng =k\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the ok is the result.\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nConvert ok to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: word\n\nwrite(word, '(i0)') ok\n\nThen, count uppercase and lowercase letters in word.\n\nBut the digits in the string are neither uppercase nor lowercase letters. So the counts will be zero for both, so the result will be lowercase.\n\nWait, the word is the string representation of the integer ok. So it contains only digits and possibly a minus sign (but since ok is between 0 and n, it's non-negative). So all characters are lowercase (digits are considered lowercase?), but in Fortran, the functions to check uppercase or lowercase may treat non-letters as neither.\n\nIn the second Java program, the code counts uppercase and lowercase letters. For non-letters (like digits), they are not counted. So in the word (which is a number's string), there are no uppercase or lowercase letters. So uppercase and lowercase counts are both zero. The code then chooses lowercase (since the else clause when counts are equal).\n\nTherefore, the output will be the lowercase version of the string, which is the same as the original (since digits are already lowercase).\n\nSo the final output is the string representation of ok in lowercase, which is the same as the original number's string.\n\nTherefore, the second part's output is simply the string representation of ok.\n\nWait, but the second program's code would process the input as a word, which is the string of digits. Since there are no uppercase letters, the code would output the lowercase version, which is the same as the input. So the final output is the same as the first program's output.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is an integer, and the second program's output is the same string. So the overall effect is that the final output is the same as the first program's output. But that's only if the second program's processing doesn't change it. But in this case, it doesn't.\n\nHmm, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So the first program's output is passed to the second, which may or may not change it. In this case, it doesn't change it, so the final output is the same as the first program's output. But perhaps there's a case where the first program's output is a number like \"5A\" (but no, the first program outputs an integer, so it's a number string). So the second program's processing leaves it as is.\n\nTherefore, the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the user's instruction requires that the entire sequence is translated, so the second program's processing must be done even if it doesn't change the output.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing ok, we must process it through the second program's logic.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nAfter computing ok:\n\n- Convert ok to a string (word).\n\n- Count uppercase and lowercase letters in word.\n\n- If uppercase > lowercase \u2192 uppercase the word.\n\n- Else if lowercase > uppercase \u2192 lowercase (no change).\n\n- Else \u2192 lowercase (no change).\n\nBut since the word has no letters, the counts are zero, so it will choose lowercase, which is the same as the original.\n\nThus, the final output is the string representation of ok.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can just output ok as an integer, but according to the second program's logic, it must be printed as a string in lowercase, which is the same as the integer's string.\n\nSo the final output is the same as the first program's output. But to adhere to the problem's requirement of translating the entire sequence, we must perform the second step.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program will have:\n\n1. Read n and array a.\n\n2. Compute ok via binary search and isPossible.\n\n3. Convert ok to a string.\n\n4. Process the string according to the second program's logic.\n\n5. Output the processed string.\n\nNow, coding the second part:\n\nThe second part's code in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: word\n\ninteger :: uppercase =0, lowercase =0\n\nwrite(word, '(i0)') ok\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(word)\n\n   ch = word(i:i)\n\n   if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n       uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n   else if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('z')) then\n\n       lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   print *, adjustl(uppercase(word))\n\nelse if (lowercase > uppercase) then\n\n   print *, lowercase(word)\n\nelse\n\n   print *, lowercase(word)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting to uppercase or lowercase can be done with intrinsic functions. For example, using the 'ucase' and 'lcase' functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, we can loop through each character and change them.\n\nAlternatively, since the word contains only digits and possibly a minus sign (but ok is non-negative), the counts will be zero for both. So the result will be to output the lowercase version, which is the same as the original.\n\nTherefore, the final output is simply the string representation of ok.\n\nBut to adhere to the problem's requirement, we must perform the second step's logic.\n\nSo the code for the second part is as above.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read n and array a.\n\n- Compute ok via binary search and isPossible function.\n\n- Process the ok string through the second program's logic.\n\n- Output the result.\n\nNow, coding the isPossible function in Fortran.\n\nThe isPossible function is a function that takes an integer k and returns a logical.\n\nThe array s is of size 0 to n-1 (since the maximum key is n-1).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can declare them as 0-based.\n\nSo:\n\nlogical function isPossible(k)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: k\n\n   integer :: current, ai, p, sp\n\n   integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: s\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   s = 0\n\n   current =0\n\n   do i=1, n\n\n      ai = a(i)\n\n      if (ai <= current) then\n\n         if (k ==1) then\n\n             isPossible = .false.\n\n             return\n\n         end if\n\n         ! Remove all keys >= ai\n\n         do p = ai, n-1\n\n             s(p) =0\n\n         end do\n\n         p = ai -1\n\n         if (p <0) then\n\n             isPossible = .false.\n\n             return\n\n         end if\n\n         do\n\n             sp = s(p) +1\n\n             if (sp ==k) then\n\n                 s(p) =0\n\n                 p = p-1\n\n                 if (p <0) then\n\n                     isPossible = .false.\n\n                     return\n\n                 end if\n\n             else\n\n                 s(p) = sp\n\n                 exit\n\n             end if\n\n         end do\n\n      end if\n\n      current = ai\n\n   end do\n\n   isPossible = .true.\n\nend function isPossible\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are declared with a size. The array s is declared inside the function with dimension(0:n-1). But n is a variable, so this may not be allowed unless n is a constant. However, in Fortran 90 and later, we can use allocatable arrays or assumed-shape arrays. Alternatively, since n is known at the time of the function call, perhaps we can pass it as an argument.\n\nWait, the function isPossible is part of the main program, so n is a variable in the main program. Therefore, the function can access it via the main program's variables. But in Fortran, functions can't access variables from the main program unless they are declared in a module or passed as arguments.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The function isPossible needs to know the value of n and the array a. So the function must be a subroutine or function that takes these as arguments.\n\nAlternatively, we can make the function isPossible a module function with access to the main program's variables. But this may complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, pass n and a as arguments to the function.\n\nSo modifying the function signature:\n\nlogical function isPossible(k, n, a)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: k, n, a(n)\n\n   integer :: current, ai, p, sp\n\n   integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: s\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   s = 0\n\n   current =0\n\n   do i=1, n\n\n      ai = a(i)\n\n      if (ai <= current) then\n\n         if (k ==1) then\n\n             isPossible = .false.\n\n             return\n\n         end if\n\n         ! Remove all keys >= ai\n\n         do p = ai, n-1\n\n             s(p) =0\n\n         end do\n\n         p = ai -1\n\n         if (p <0) then\n\n             isPossible = .false.\n\n             return\n\n         end if\n\n         do\n\n             sp = s(p) +1\n\n             if (sp ==k) then\n\n                 s(p) =0\n\n                 p = p-1\n\n                 if (p <0) then\n\n                     isPossible = .false.\n\n                     return\n\n                 end if\n\n             else\n\n                 s(p) = sp\n\n                 exit\n\n             end if\n\n         end do\n\n      end if\n\n      current = ai\n\n   end do\n\n   isPossible = .true.\n\nend function isPossible\n\nNow, the function takes k, n, and a as arguments.\n\nIn the main program:\n\nWe need to declare a as an array of size n, but n is read from input. So we can read n first, then allocate the array.\n\nThe main program outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, ok, ng, k, i\n\n   integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: word\n\n   integer :: uppercase, lowercase\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   allocate(a(n))\n\n   read(*,*) a\n\n   ! Binary search\n\n   ng =0\n\n   ok =n\n\n   do while (ok - ng >1)\n\n      k = (ng + ok)/2\n\n      if (isPossible(k, n, a)) then\n\n          ok =k\n\n      else\n\n          ng =k\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Process second part\n\n   write(word, '(i0)') ok\n\n   uppercase =0\n\n   lowercase =0\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(word)\n\n      character :: ch = word(i:i)\n\n      if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n          uppercase = uppercase +1\n\n      else if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('z')) then\n\n          lowercase = lowercase +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n       print *, adjustl(uppercase(word))\n\n   else\n\n       print *, lowercase(word)\n\n   end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting to uppercase or lowercase requires a function. For example, to uppercase:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: upper_word\n\nupper_word = adjustl(uppercase(word))\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a built-in function for this. We need to loop through each character and change them.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: result\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(word)\n\n      ch = word(i:i)\n\n      if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('z')) then\n\n          result(i:i) = achar(ichar(ch) - 32)\n\n      else\n\n          result(i:i) = ch\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nelse\n\n   do i=1, len_trim(word)\n\n      ch = word(i:i)\n\n      if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z')) then\n\n          result(i:i) = achar(ichar(ch) +32)\n\n      else\n\n          result(i:i) = ch\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nprint *, trim(result)\n\nAlternatively, since the word contains only digits and possibly '-', which are not letters, the uppercase and lowercase counts are zero. So the result will be the lowercase version, which is the same as the original. So the code can be simplified to just output the word as is.\n\nBut to adhere to the problem's requirement, we must perform the second program's logic.\n\nThus, the code for the second part is as above.\n\nPutting it all together, the final Fortran program would look like this:\n\nBut I need to make sure all parts are correctly implemented.\n\nNow, let's write the complete code.\n\nFirst, the function isPossible:\n\nlogical function isPossible(k, n, a)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: k, n, a(n)\n\n   integer :: current, ai, p, sp\n\n   integer :: i\n\n   integer, dimension(0:n-1) :: s\n\n   s = 0\n\n   current =0\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      ai = a(i)\n\n      if (ai <= current) then\n\n         if (k ==1) then\n\n             isPossible = .false.\n\n             return\n\n         end if\n\n         !
