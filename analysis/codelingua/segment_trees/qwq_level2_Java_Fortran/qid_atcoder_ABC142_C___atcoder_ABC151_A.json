    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java file's purpose.\n\nFirst Java file (atcoder_ABC142_C):\n- Reads N, then N numbers A_i. It maps each A (the value) to its index i. Then, for each i from 1 to N, it prints the index stored in idorder for i. So essentially, if the input is like A1, A2,...AN, then the output is the permutation where the position of each number from 1 to N in the A array is listed. For example, if input A's are [3,1,2], then the output would be 2 3 1 because 1 is at index 2, 2 at 3, 3 at 1.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A):\n- Reads a string s, then outputs the first character of s incremented by 1. Wait, but in the code, it's s.charAt(0) + 1. Wait, but in Java, characters are treated as their ASCII values. So if the input is \"a\", it would output \"b\", but if it's \"z\", it would be \"{\", which is probably not intended. But the code is as written. However, the second file's code is part of a sequence, so the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program's output is a list of integers separated by spaces. The second program expects a string input, which would be that list of numbers as a string. Wait, but the second program's code is taking the first character of the input string and adding 1 to it. Hmm, that's a bit odd. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the second Java program's main method reads a line from input, then takes the first character of that line and prints it incremented by 1. So if the first program's output is, say, \"2 3 1 \", then the second program would take the first character '2', add 1 to get '3', and output that. So the final output would be the first character of the first program's output plus 1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. So the input to the second program is that sequence as a string. The second program takes the first character of that string (the first digit of the first number) and increments it by 1. For example, if the first program outputs \"12 34\", then the input to the second is \"12 34\", so the first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nWait, but the second program's code is written as:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo the first character of the input string is taken, converted to its ASCII value, added 1, then printed as a character. So if the input is \"123\", then the first character is '1' (ASCII 49), adding 1 gives 50 which is '2'.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's behavior is:\n\n1. Read N and N numbers A_i. Create a mapping from A's value to their index. Then output the indices in the order of 1..N. So for each i from 1 to N, output the index where A was equal to i.\n\n2. Take that output (a space-separated list of numbers), read it as a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nSo the Fortran program must do both steps in sequence, without I/O in between.\n\nNow, translating this into a single Fortran program.\n\nFirst, the first part (Java's first file):\n\nWe need to read N, then N integers A(1) to A(N). Then create an array or a list that for each value from 1 to N, stores the index where that value was found. Then collect those indices in order 1 to N and store them as an intermediate array.\n\nSecond part (Java's second file):\n\nTake the first character of the intermediate array's output (as a string), increment its ASCII value by 1, and print that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how do we handle this? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nWe need to read N, then N integers. Let's say we have an array A of size N. Then, we need to create an array (or a list) that for each value from 1 to N, gives the index where that value was stored in A. So for each i from 1 to N, we can loop through the A array to find where A(j) = i, then store j in the result array.\n\nWait, but in Java, they used a HashMap. In Fortran, perhaps an array of size N+1 (since values are from 1 to N) where index is the value, and the stored value is the position. So for each j from 1 to N, we can set idorder(A(j)) = j. Then, the result is the array idorder(1), idorder(2), ..., idorder(N).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array idorder of size N, but since the keys are from 1 to N, perhaps an array of size N+1 (since in Java, the keys can be up to N). Wait, in the first Java code, the keys are the A values, which are from 1 to N (since the problem is probably about permutations, but the code allows any A_i, but the problem might require that they form a permutation). Assuming that the input is a permutation, so each A is unique and covers 1..N. So the idorder array can be of size N+1 (indices 1 to N), where for each A_j, idorder(A_j) = j.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: idorder\nallocate(idorder(1:N))\ndo j = 1, N\n   idorder(A(j)) = j\nend do\n\nThen, the result array is the array idorder(1), idorder(2), ..., idorder(N). Let's call this result array res.\n\nThen, the second part of the Java code takes the first character of the string representation of res (space-separated) and increments it by 1.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how do we get the first character of the output string of the first part?\n\nThe problem is that in the original Java setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, we need to compute the first part's output (the res array), then process it as if it were a string input to the second program.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and the N A's.\n\n2. Compute the res array (the indices in order 1..N).\n\n3. Convert the res array into a string (space-separated numbers, as the first program would output).\n\n4. Take the first character of that string, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can't directly get the ASCII value of a character. Wait, but in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is taking the first character of the input string, adding 1 to its ASCII value, then printing as a character. So in Fortran, we can do:\n\nTake the first character of the string (from the first part's output), get its ASCII code with ichar, add 1, then convert back to a character with char, then print it.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nFirst, compute the res array as before.\n\nThen, create a string that is the space-separated list of res elements. Let's call this string s.\n\nThen, take the first character of s (s(1:1)), get its ASCII code, add 1, then output that character.\n\nNow, the challenge is to generate the string s correctly. Since in the first Java program, the output is printed with spaces between each element, but no trailing space. Wait, looking at the first Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n    System.out.print(idorder.get(i));\n    System.out.print(\" \");\n}\n\nSo that would print all elements followed by a space, including the last one. So the output would be like \"2 3 1 \" (with a trailing space). But in Java, when you print with print, it doesn't add a newline. So the entire output is the numbers separated by spaces, with a trailing space. However, when the second program reads the input, it reads the entire line (using readLine()), so the trailing space is part of the input string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the string s must be the same as the first program's output, including the trailing space. So when building s, after each element, we add a space, even after the last one.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to build the string s:\n\nWe can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: s\ninteger :: i\ns = ''\ndo i = 1, N\n   write(s, '(a,i0,a)') trim(s), res(i), ' '\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, building a string dynamically can be tricky. Alternatively, we can precompute the length. Each number can be up to, say, 10 digits, so for N numbers, each with up to 10 digits plus a space, total length is N*(10+1) + 1 (but maybe overkill). Alternatively, use a character array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to write the res array into a character variable, with spaces between elements, including the trailing space.\n\nAlternatively, use a write statement into an internal string.\n\nIn Fortran, to write to a string, we can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\ninteger :: i\ns = ''\ndo i = 1, N\n   write(s, '(a,i0,a)') trim(s), res(i), ' '\nend do\n\nWait, but this might not work because the initial s is empty, then appending. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x), i0 )' ) res(1:N)\n\nWait, but that would have a trailing space? Let me think. The format ( (i0, 1x), i0 ) would print each element followed by a space, except the last one? Or maybe not. Let me see:\n\nThe format for a list of items with a comma separated format. The format (i0, 1x) would be applied to each element, but the 1x adds a space after each. So for N elements, each is printed as i0 followed by a space. So the total would be N elements each followed by a space, so the total length is sum of digits + N spaces. So the trailing space is present. So the resulting string would have a trailing space.\n\nTherefore, using an internal write:\n\nallocate a character array of sufficient length. Let's say the maximum N is 1e5, but maybe the problem constraints are smaller. But for the code, perhaps we can compute the required length.\n\nAlternatively, use a large enough buffer. Let's assume N is up to 1e5, each number up to 1e5 (so 5 digits). So each element is 5 +1 (space) =6, so total length is 6*N. So for N=1e5, that's 6e5 characters. But in Fortran, we can use an allocatable character variable.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, in the code:\n\nRead N, then read N integers into array A.\n\nCompute the res array as before.\n\nThen, create the string s by writing res with spaces between each element, including trailing space.\n\nThen, take the first character of s, add 1 to its ASCII value, and print it.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: N, i, j\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, res\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\nRead N:\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nallocate(A(N), res(N))\n\nread(*,*) (A(i), i=1,N)\n\nThen compute res:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n   res(A(i)) = i\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. So if A contains values from 1 to N, then res(A(i)) = i will set res at position A(i) to i. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are initialized to zero? Or do we need to initialize res?\n\nYes, in Fortran, allocatable arrays are not initialized, so we need to set all elements to zero first, then overwrite the positions.\n\nWait, because if A contains all values from 1 to N, then every position in res will be set. But if the problem allows A to have duplicates (but the first Java code's problem might require that A is a permutation), but the code as written in Java doesn't check. So in the Fortran code, perhaps we should initialize res to zero, then set res(A(i)) = i. Then, after that, check that all res(1:N) are non-zero? But maybe the problem expects that the input is a permutation, so we can proceed.\n\nSo, to be safe, perhaps initialize res to zero first.\n\nallocate(res(N))\n\nres = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n   res(A(i)) = i\nend do\n\nThen, the res array now has the indices for each value from 1 to N.\n\nNow, building the string s.\n\nWe can use an internal write statement into a character variable. Let's first determine the required length.\n\nThe maximum length needed is the sum of the number of digits of each element plus N spaces (since each element is followed by a space, including the last one).\n\nAlternatively, use a large enough buffer. Let's assume each number is up to 10 digits, so 10 +1 per element. So total length is (10+1)*N.\n\nBut in Fortran, we can use an allocatable character variable and let the compiler handle it.\n\nAlternatively, use a format that writes all elements with spaces.\n\nThe code:\n\ncharacter(len= : ), allocatable :: s\ninteger :: i\n\n! Compute the string s as the space-separated list of res, with trailing space.\n\n! First, compute the required length.\n\ninteger :: len_needed = 0\ndo i = 1, N\n   len_needed = len_needed + len_trim( trim(adjustl( res(i) )) ) + 1\nend do\n\nallocate( character(len=len_needed) :: s )\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x), i0 )' ) res(1:N)\n\nWait, no. The format ( (i0, 1x), i0 ) would not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct format to write each element followed by a space, including the last one, is to use a format that for each element, writes the number and a space. So the format would be (i0, 1x) repeated N times. But that would have N spaces, so the total length is sum of digits + N.\n\nAlternatively, the format can be written as ( (i0, 1x), i0 ) but that's not right. Wait, perhaps:\n\nThe format should be ( (i0, 1x), i0 ) but that's not correct. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose res is [2,3,1]. Then the desired output is \"2 3 1 \" (with trailing space). The format for writing this would be:\n\nwrite(s, '(3(i0, 1x))') res(1), res(2), res(3)\n\nBut that would give \"2 3 1 \" (with three elements, each followed by a space, so three spaces, total length 3+3=6? Wait 2 is 1 digit, 3 is 1, 1 is 1. So digits sum to 3, plus 3 spaces: total 6. The string would be \"2 3 1 \" (with the last space). So yes.\n\nBut in Fortran, the format for N elements would be (N*(i0, 1x)), but that's not possible as a variable. So perhaps using a format that writes each element followed by a space, and then the last element also has a space. Alternatively, use a loop to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, use an internal write with a format that appends a space after each element, even the last one.\n\nThe format for that would be something like:\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x) )' ) res(1:N)\n\nWait, the ( (i0, 1x) ) is a loop over the list, applying the format (i0, 1x) to each element. So each element is written as i0 followed by a space. So for N elements, that would produce N elements each followed by a space, so the total length is sum of digits + N spaces. So the trailing space is present. That's exactly what we need.\n\nTherefore, the code can be:\n\nallocate(s, source='')\n! But need to know the length. Alternatively, use a format that allows variable length.\n\nAlternatively, use a temporary character variable with sufficient length.\n\nLet me try:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\ninteger :: iounit, ios\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x) )', iostat=ios) res(1:N)\n\nBut the problem is that if the string is longer than 100000, it will be truncated. To avoid that, perhaps compute the required length first.\n\nAlternatively, use a different approach. Let's compute the length needed first.\n\nCompute the total length as the sum of the number of digits of each element plus N (for the spaces).\n\nThen allocate s with that length.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: len_needed = 0\ndo i = 1, N\n   len_needed = len_needed + len_trim( trim(adjustl( res(i) )) ) + 1\nend do\n\nallocate( character(len=len_needed) :: s )\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x) )' ) res(1:N)\n\nWait, but the len_trim( trim(adjustl( res(i) )) ) is the number of digits of res(i). Because trim(adjustl( ... )) would left-adjust and trim, so for an integer, the length is the number of digits.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you write an integer to a character variable, the default is to write with leading spaces. So using len_trim(adjustl( ... )) would give the number of digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the function len_trim( trim( ... )) but maybe it's better to compute the number of digits via log10.\n\nAlternatively, for each res(i), the number of digits is:\n\ndigits = 0\n\nif (res(i) == 0) then\n\ndigits = 1\n\nelse\n\ndigits = floor( log10( res(i) ) ) + 1\n\nend if\n\nBut since res(i) is between 1 and N (assuming permutation), so it's positive.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: len_needed = 0\ndo i = 1, N\n   if (res(i) == 0) then\n      len_needed = len_needed + 1\n   else\n      len_needed = len_needed + floor( log10( real(res(i)) ) ) + 1\n   end if\n   len_needed = len_needed + 1 ! for the space\nend do\n\nBut this requires using real and log10, which might be a bit involved, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, just use the first method with len_trim(adjustl( ... )).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write an integer to a character variable, the default format is Iw, which pads with spaces on the left. So, for example, writing 123 to a character variable would take 3 characters, but if the variable is longer, it would have leading spaces. So using adjustl would move the number to the left, and then len_trim gives the length of the non-space part.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose res(i) is 123. Then, when we write it as i0, it would be \"123\" (without leading spaces?), no. Wait, the i0 format writes the integer with no leading spaces. Wait, the I0 format in Fortran writes the integer in the smallest possible field, so for 123, it would be \"123\" with no leading spaces. So the length is exactly the number of digits.\n\nWait, the format I0 means that the field width is determined by the number of digits. So the length of the string representation is exactly the number of digits. So len_trim( write(res(i)) ) would be the number of digits.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to compute the length as follows:\n\nlen_needed = 0\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   len_needed = len_needed + len_trim( write(res(i)) ) + 1\n\nend do\n\nBut how to get the length of the string representation of res(i) without actually writing it?\n\nAlternatively, use the function len_trim with a temporary variable.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, just use a large enough buffer. Let's assume that N is up to 1e5, and each number is up to 1e5 (so 5 digits). So each element takes 5 +1 =6 characters. So total length is 6*N. So for N=1e5, that's 6e5 characters. So in Fortran, we can allocate a character variable of size 6*N.\n\nBut in code, we can do:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_len = 1000000\n\ncharacter(len=max_len) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x) )' ) res(1:N)\n\nBut this may be overkill, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use an internal write with a format that can handle variable length.\n\nAlternatively, proceed with the code as follows, assuming that the write will fit into a sufficiently large buffer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nallocate a large enough character variable.\n\ncharacter(len=1000000) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '( (i0, 1x) )' ) res(1:N)\n\nThen, the string s will have the numbers separated by spaces, including a trailing space. The length of s will be exactly the sum of the digits of each res(i) plus N (spaces).\n\nNow, the next step is to take the first character of s, get its ASCII code, add 1, then output as a character.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_char\ninteger :: ascii_code\n\nfirst_char = s(1:1)\n\nascii_code = ichar(first_char) + 1\n\nprint *, char(ascii_code)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the print statement adds a new line. The second Java program's output is just the character, so we need to print it without a newline. Alternatively, use write with an appropriate format.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') char(ascii_code)\n\nBut the second Java program's code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which would print the character without a newline. So in Fortran, to replicate that, we can use:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') char(ascii_code)\n\nBut in some Fortran environments, the default is to have newlines, so using advance='no' would prevent adding a newline.\n\nAlternatively, just print it as a single character with a format that doesn't add a newline.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may not care about the trailing newline, but to be precise, the Java code's second program's output is just the character followed by a newline? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nThe second Java program's code has:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0)+1);\n\nThe printf with %c will print the character, and then the print stream's next output would be on the same line. But in Java, System.out.println adds a newline, but printf here just outputs the character and leaves the cursor there. However, when run as a program, the output would be that single character followed by a newline? Or not?\n\nWait, in Java, the default is that each print statement appends a newline unless using print instead of println. The code uses System.out.printf, which does not add a newline unless the format string includes a \\n. Since the format is \"%c\", it just outputs the character. So the output is exactly one character, with no trailing newline.\n\nIn Fortran, the write statement with '(a)' will output the character followed by a newline. To avoid that, we can use:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') char(ascii_code)\n\nBut if the problem expects no newline, that's needed. Otherwise, it might be okay. Let me check the problem's requirements.\n\nThe user says the final Fortran program must behave identically to the original chain. The original chain's second program outputs the character without a newline. So in Fortran, we need to avoid adding a newline.\n\nThus, the code should use the advance='no' option.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i\n    integer, allocatable :: A(:), res(:)\n    character(len=1000000) :: s\n    character(len=1) :: first_char\n    integer :: ascii_code\n\n    ! Read N and the A array\n    read(*,*) N\n    allocate(A(N), res(N))\n    read(*,*) (A(i), i=1,N)\n\n    ! Initialize res to 0\n    res = 0\n\n    ! Fill res with indices\n    do i = 1, N\n        res(A(i)) = i\n    end do\n\n    ! Build the string s as space-separated res elements with trailing space\n    write(s, '( (i0, 1x) )' ) res(1:N)\n\n    ! Process the first character\n    first_char = s(1:1)\n    ascii_code = ichar(first_char) + 1\n    write(*, '(a)', advance='no') char(ascii_code)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but what if the string s is shorter than the allocated length? The write statement will only write up to the first N*(digits +1) characters, but the rest of the s is filled with spaces? Or does the write statement only write the necessary part?\n\nIn Fortran, when you write to a character variable with an internal write, the rest of the variable is filled with spaces. But when we write to s using the format, the output is placed in s starting at the first character, and the rest of the characters beyond the written data are left as whatever was there before. Wait, no. The write statement will overwrite the first part of s with the formatted data, and the remaining characters are set to spaces? Or not?\n\nActually, in an internal write to a character variable, the variable is filled with the formatted data, and any remaining characters are set to spaces. So the s variable after the write will have the desired string followed by spaces. But when we take s(1:1), it's the first character of the written data, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nWait, but what if the first character is a space? For example, if the first element of res is 0 (but that can't happen if the input is a permutation). But according to the problem's first Java code, the input A's are mapped to their indices, so res should have all elements filled. So if the input is a permutation, then res(1) is the index of the first element in A which is 1, so it's at least 1. So the first character of s is the first digit of the first number in res, which is non-zero.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose N=3, and the input A is [3,1,2].\n\nThen res(1) is the index where A is 1, which is 2.\n\nres(2) is the index where A is 2, which is 3.\n\nres(3) is the index where A is 3, which is 1.\n\nSo res is [2,3,1].\n\nThe string s is \"2 3 1 \" (with a trailing space).\n\nThe first character is '2' (ASCII 50). Adding 1 gives 51, which is '3', so the output is '3'.\n\nAnother test case: input N=1, A is [1]. Then res is [1]. The string is \"1 \" (with a space). The first character is '1', so output is '2'.\n\nAnother case: N=2, A is [2,1]. res is [2,1]. The string is \"2 1 \", first character '2' \u2192 '3'.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, what about if the first character is a space? That can't happen because the first element of res is at least 1, so the first character is a digit.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
