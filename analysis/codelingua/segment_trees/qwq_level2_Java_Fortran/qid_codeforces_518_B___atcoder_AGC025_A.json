So in Fortran, the array approach can't remove entries, but since we are using an array, we can just set the count to 0 when it reaches 0. So the code can be adjusted to:\n\nfor each character in s:\n\n   c = s(i)\n\n   current = tmap(ichar(c)) if current ==0 then cycle\n\n   tmap(ichar(c)) = current -1\n\n   if current ==1 then\n\n      tmap(ichar(c)) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   s(i:i) = '\u042f'\n\n   ura = ura +1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the original count was 1, after decrementing, it becomes 0, so the key is removed. So in the array, setting it to 0 is equivalent to removing it. So that's manageable.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (codeforces_518_B). It reads two strings, s and t. Then it processes them in two steps. The first step counts how many characters from s can be matched with t's characters, removing them from t's map. The second step checks the reversed case (like lowercase to uppercase and vice versa) of the remaining characters in s against what's left in t's map. The outputs are ura and opa, which are the counts from these two steps.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, calculates some sum based on splitting N into two parts and finding the minimum sum of their digit sums. The output here is the minimum sum.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program (the printed ura and opa) is the input for the second program. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (the two strings for the first part), process them to get ura and opa, then use those numbers as N for the second part, compute the required sum, and output that result.\n\nWait, but the second Java program expects an integer N as input. So the first program's output (ura and opa) must be the input to the second. But in the original setup, the first program's output is two numbers, and the second program reads a single integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (the two numbers ura and opa) would be the input to the second Java program. But the second Java program expects a single integer N. So perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only takes the first one? Or maybe the second program is supposed to read both numbers and use them somehow? Wait, looking at the second Java program's code, it reads N via stdIn.nextInt(). So the input to the second program is a single integer. Therefore, the first program's output must be a single integer, but the first program outputs two numbers. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code, it prints \"ura + \" + opa\", so two numbers separated by a space. The second Java program reads an integer N via nextInt(). So how does that work? The second program would read the first number (ura) as N, and ignore the second (opa). But that's probably not the case. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or perhaps the second program is supposed to read the two numbers as a single input? Or maybe the first program's output is actually a single number? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's main method: it ends with System.out.println(ura + \" \" + opa);. So the output is two integers separated by a space. The second Java program's main method starts by reading an integer N with stdIn.nextInt(). So the second program would read the first number (ura) as N, and the second number (opa) would be left unread. But that would mean that the second program's input is only the first number. But the problem says that the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only reads one. That suggests that perhaps the second program is supposed to read both numbers, but in the original setup, maybe the second program is expecting a single number, so perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the second program is part of a different problem and the user made a mistake in the sequence? Wait, the user provided two Java files, and said that they are meant to be executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is two numbers, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a single integer. That's a problem. Unless the second program is supposed to read both numbers and use them somehow. Wait, looking at the second Java program's code, it's taking N as input, so perhaps the first program's output is actually a single number? Wait, no, the first program outputs two numbers. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to read the two numbers as a single input? Like, maybe the first program's output is two numbers, and the second program reads them as N and something else, but in the code provided, the second program only uses N. Wait, perhaps the second program is part of a different problem and the user intended that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program only takes the first number. So in the Fortran program, after computing ura and opa, we need to pass only the first (ura) to the second part. But the problem says the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program, so the second part's input is the output of the first part. So the first part's output is two numbers, but the second part expects one. That's conflicting. Unless the second program is supposed to read both numbers, but in the code provided, it's not. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the second program is supposed to read the two numbers as a single input, but that's not possible. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second program is part of a different problem and the user intended that the first program's output is the input to the second, but the second program is expecting a single integer. So perhaps the first program's output is two numbers, but the second program only takes the first one. So in the Fortran program, after computing ura and opa, we need to pass ura as the N for the second part. The opa is not used. That would make sense. So the second program's N is the first number from the first program's output. So the Fortran program must compute ura and opa, then use ura as N in the second part's calculation, then output the result of the second part.\n\nOkay, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nThe first Java program reads two strings s and t. Then processes them as follows:\n\n- For each character in s, check if it exists in t's map. If so, decrement the count in the map, set the character in s to '\u042f', and increment ura. If the count reaches zero, remove the key.\n\nWait, but in Java, the map is a HashMap. So for each character in s, we check if it's present in the map. If yes, we decrease the count. If the count becomes zero, remove it from the map.\n\nThen, in the second loop, for each character in s (now modified to have some '\u042f's?), but actually, the first loop sets some characters to '\u042f', but the second loop is going through the original s's length? Wait, the code uses the original length (length = s.length() before modifying s). Wait, the first loop is over the original length. Because s is a StringBuilder, so when you setCharAt(i, '\u042f'), it modifies the string. But the loop is from 0 to length-1 (since i < length). So the first loop processes all characters of the original s, replacing some with '\u042f', and the second loop also loops over the original length, but the characters in s may have been replaced.\n\nWait, the second loop is looking at each character in s (after the first loop's modifications), and then takes the reverse case (lower to upper, upper to lower) of that character, and checks if that reversed character is in the remaining tmap. So for each character in s (now possibly '\u042f'), but when reversed, '\u042f' is a Cyrillic character, but the reverse function would treat it as lowercase? Not sure, but in the Java code, the reverse function is defined as:\n\npublic static Character reverse(Character ch) {\n    if (Character.isLowerCase(ch)) {\n        return Character.toUpperCase(ch);\n    } else return Character.toLowerCase(ch);\n}\n\nSo for '\u042f', which is a Cyrillic uppercase letter (since in Unicode, '\u042f' is U+042F, which is uppercase), so reverse would return lowercase '\u044f'.\n\nBut in the second loop, for each character in s (after first loop's changes), which may be '\u042f', the reverse would be '\u044f', and then check if that is in the remaining tmap.\n\nSo the second loop is processing the characters in s (after first loop's changes) and their reversed versions, but only for those that were not replaced in the first loop? Or even the replaced ones?\n\nWait, in the first loop, after processing a character, it's set to '\u042f', so in the second loop, when looking at that character, it's '\u042f', so reverse would be '\u044f', and check if '\u044f' is in the remaining tmap.\n\nSo the second loop is processing all characters in s (the modified s), but the first loop may have replaced some with '\u042f', so their reversed versions are considered.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, strings are handled as character arrays. So we can read the two strings s and t.\n\nThe first step is to count the frequency of each character in t. So we can use a hash map, but in Fortran, perhaps an array or a derived type with a hash. Alternatively, since characters are limited (assuming ASCII or extended), we can use an array indexed by the character's ASCII code.\n\nAlternatively, since the characters can be any, but in Fortran, perhaps using a hash table is tricky. Alternatively, since the problem may involve only lowercase and uppercase letters, but the first program's code uses reverse between lower and upper, so perhaps the characters are letters. But the first program's code also includes '\u042f', which is Cyrillic. Hmm, but in the first program, the '\u042f' is a replacement character, so perhaps the original s and t can have any characters, but in the problem's context, maybe they are letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the characters in t are letters, and the reverse function is only for letters. But in any case, in Fortran, handling a map can be done with an array where the index is the ASCII value of the character. Since characters can be up to 255 (or more, but assuming ASCII), we can have an array of size 256 (or 255) to count the frequencies.\n\nSo first, for the first part:\n\nRead s and t as strings.\n\nInitialize an array tmap of size 256 (or 255) initialized to 0.\n\nLoop over each character in t, increment tmap(ichar(c)) by 1.\n\nThen, process s's characters:\n\nLoop over each character in s (original length):\n\n   c = s(i)\n\n   count = tmap(ichar(c))\n\n   if count ==0, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      decrement tmap(ichar(c)) by 1.\n\n      set s(i) to '\u042f' (but in Fortran, strings are arrays, so s(i:i) = '\u042f')\n\n      increment ura by 1.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after decrementing, if the count becomes 1, then it's not removed from the map. Wait, in the Java code, when the count is 1, it removes the key. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (inum == 1) tmap.remove(ch);\n\nelse tmap.put(ch, inum - 1);\n\nAh, so when the count was 1, after decrementing, it becomes 0, so we remove the key. So in Fortran, the array approach can't remove entries, but since we are using an array, we can just set the count to 0 when it reaches 0. So the code can be adjusted to:\n\nfor each character in s:\n\n   c = s(i)\n\n   current = tmap(ichar(c))\n\n   if current ==0 then cycle\n\n   tmap(ichar(c)) = current -1\n\n   if current ==1 then\n\n      tmap(ichar(c)) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   s(i:i) = '\u042f'\n\n   ura = ura +1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, when the original count was 1, after decrementing, it becomes 0, so the key is removed. So in the array, setting it to 0 is equivalent to removing it.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\nLoop over each character in s (the modified s, but the length is the original length):\n\n   c = s(i)\n\n   reversed_char = reverse(c)\n\n   rch = reversed_char\n\n   current = tmap(ichar(rch))\n\n   if current ==0 then cycle\n\n   tmap(ichar(rch)) = current -1\n\n   if current ==1 then\n\n      tmap(ichar(rch)) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   opa = opa +1\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the reverse function converts lowercase to uppercase and vice versa. So in Fortran, we need a function to do that.\n\nFunction reverse_char(c) result(r)\n\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n\n   character :: r\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      r = achar(ichar(c) - 32)  ! lowercase to uppercase\n\n   else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      r = achar(ichar(c) + 32)  ! uppercase to lowercase\n\n   else\n\n      r = c  ! for other characters, like '\u042f', which is uppercase, so becomes lowercase '\u044f'\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nWait, but '\u042f' is a Cyrillic character. Its ASCII code is 1071 (assuming ISO-8859-5 or similar). So the function would treat it as uppercase, so reverse would be lowercase '\u044f' (code 1103). But in Fortran, the achar function may depend on the encoding. However, the problem may not require handling non-ASCII characters beyond what's in the code. Since the first program's code uses '\u042f' as a replacement, perhaps the problem expects that the second loop's reversed characters are only for letters, but in any case, the function must handle all characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases only involve letters, so the function can be written as above.\n\nNow, after processing both loops, the first part's output is ura and opa. But in the Fortran program, we need to pass these to the second part.\n\nNow, the second part is the second Java program. Let's see what it does.\n\nThe second Java program takes an integer N, and finds the minimal sum of the digit sums of A and (N - A), where A ranges from 1 to N/2 (or (N+1)/2 if N is odd). The minimal sum is computed.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Compute N, which is the input.\n\n- The minimal sum is initially set to sum(1) + sum(N-1).\n\n- Then iterate A from 1 to n (where n is N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2).\n\n- For each A, compute sum(A) + sum(N - A), and track the minimum.\n\nThe sum function is the sum of all digits of the number until it's less than 10. Wait, no, looking at the code:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n\n    int ans =0;\n\n    while (a >=10) {\n\n        ans += a%10;\n\n        a = a/10;\n\n    }\n\n    ans +=a;\n\n    return ans;\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code adds the digits until the number is less than 10? Wait, no, the loop continues while a is >=10. So for example, if a is 123, first iteration: a%10 is 3, add to ans (0+3=3), a becomes 12. Next iteration, a is 12 >=10: add 2 (ans=5), a becomes 1. Then loop ends, add a (1) to ans (total 6). So the sum function is the sum of all digits except the last digit, plus the last digit? Wait, no, the loop adds the last digit each time until a is less than 10, then adds the remaining a. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nWhile a >=10:\n\n   ans += a mod 10\n\n   a = a /10\n\nThen, after the loop, a is less than 10, so add it to ans.\n\nSo for a=123:\n\nLoop steps:\n\na=123: mod10=3 \u2192 ans=3, a=12\n\na=12 \u2192 mod10=2 \u2192 ans=5, a=1\n\nNow a is 1 <10 \u2192 exit loop. Add 1 \u2192 total 6.\n\nYes, so the sum function is the sum of all digits of a. Because 1+2+3 =6. So the function is the sum of the digits of a.\n\nWait, but the code is adding the digits except the last one in each step, but the final a is the last digit. Wait, no, the loop adds the last digit each time. Let me see:\n\nWait, for a=123:\n\nFirst iteration: a mod10 is 3 (the last digit), added to ans. Then a becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: a mod10 is 2 (the last digit of 12), added to ans (3+2=5). a becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends, add 1 \u2192 total 6. So yes, the sum is the sum of all digits.\n\nSo the sum function is the sum of the digits of a.\n\nTherefore, the second program's task is to find the minimal sum of digits of A and (N - A), for A from 1 to N//2 (rounded up), and output the minimal sum.\n\nNow, in the Fortran program, after computing ura and opa from the first part, the second part will take N = ura (since the second program's input is the first number from the first program's output). Then compute the minimal sum as per the second Java program.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the two strings s and t from input.\n\n2. Process them as per the first Java program to compute ura and opa.\n\n3. Use ura as N for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the minimal digit sum as per the second Java program.\n\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nWe need to read two strings. In Fortran, we can read them as character arrays. Let's assume the maximum length is, say, 1000 (or use dynamic allocation, but for simplicity, let's use fixed size).\n\nBut in Fortran, reading strings can be done with read(*,*) s, t, but need to handle possible spaces. Alternatively, read the entire line, but perhaps the input is two words separated by space. So:\n\nRead the first string s and the second string t.\n\nThen, process the first part.\n\nInitialize the tmap array. Let's use an integer array of size 256 (assuming ASCII).\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: tmap = 0\n\nThen, loop over each character in t:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(t)\n\n   c = t(i:i)\n\n   tmap(ichar(c)) = tmap(ichar(c)) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen process s's characters for the first loop:\n\nura =0\n\nopa =0\n\noriginal_length = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i = 1, original_length\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   idx = ichar(c)\n\n   count = tmap(idx)\n\n   if (count ==0) cycle\n\n   tmap(idx) = count -1\n\n   if (count ==1) then\n\n      tmap(idx) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   s(i:i) = '\u042f'\n\n   ura = ura +1\n\nend do\n\nThen the second loop:\n\ndo i =1, original_length\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   rch = reverse_char(c)\n\n   idx = ichar(rch)\n\n   count = tmap(idx)\n\n   if (count ==0) cycle\n\n   tmap(idx) = count -1\n\n   if (count ==1) then\n\n      tmap(idx) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   opa = opa +1\n\nend do\n\nThe reverse_char function needs to be defined as a function.\n\nFunction reverse_char(c) result(r)\n\n   character, intent(in) :: c\n\n   character :: r\n\n   if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n      r = achar(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n   else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n      r = achar(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n   else\n\n      r = c\n\n   end if\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be inside the program or in modules. Since this is a single program, perhaps we can define it as an internal function.\n\nAlternatively, write it as a function inside the main program.\n\nNow, after computing ura and opa, we proceed to the second part.\n\nThe second part takes N = ura.\n\nCompute the minimal sum.\n\nFirst, define the sum function.\n\nFunction digit_sum(n) result(s)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   integer :: s, a, ans\n\n   a = n\n\n   ans =0\n\n   do while (a >=10)\n\n      ans = ans + mod(a,10)\n\n      a = a /10\n\n   end do\n\n   ans = ans + a\n\n   s = ans\n\nend function\n\nThen, compute N = ura.\n\nn_val = N\n\nif (mod(N,2) ==0) then\n\n   n_max = N/2\n\nelse\n\n   n_max = (N+1)/2\n\nend if\n\nmin_sum = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1)\n\ndo A =1, n_max\n\n   current_sum = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < min_sum) then\n\n      min_sum = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) min_sum\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, handling the strings in Fortran:\n\nWe need to read two strings. Let's assume they are read as two separate lines, but in the problem's input, they are given as two space-separated tokens. So using read(*,*) s, t would work if the input is two words. But in Fortran, when reading with list-directed input, it reads until a space or end of line. So if the input is like \"abc def\", then read(*,*) s, t would read s as 'abc' and t as 'def'.\n\nBut if the strings contain spaces, this would be a problem. However, the problem's original Java code uses scan.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So assuming that the input is two tokens separated by whitespace, the Fortran read(*,*) s, t should work.\n\nBut in Fortran, character variables need to be declared with sufficient length. Let's set a maximum length, say 1000.\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=1000) :: s, t\n\n   integer :: ura, opa, N, min_sum, n_max, A\n\n   integer, dimension(0:255) :: tmap\n\n   !

Now, second part\n\n   N = ura\n\n   if (mod(N,2) ==0) then\n\n      n_max = N/2\n\n   else\n\n      n_max = (N+1)/2\n\n   end if\n\n   min_sum = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1)\n\n   do A =1, n_max\n\n      current_sum = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n\n      if (current_sum < min_sum) then\n\n         min_sum = current_sum\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   write(*,*) min_sum\n\ncontains\n\n   function reverse_char(c) result(r)\n\n      character, intent(in) :: c\n\n      character :: r\n\n      if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n\n         r = achar(ichar(c) - 32)\n\n      else if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n\n         r = achar(ichar(c) + 32)\n\n      else\n\n         r = c\n\n      end if\n\n   end function\n\n   function digit_sum(n) result(s)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n      integer :: s, a, ans\n\n      a = n\n\n      ans =0\n\n      do while (a >=10)\n\n         ans = ans + mod(a,10)\n\n         a = a /10\n\n      end do\n\n      ans = ans + a\n\n      s = ans\n\n   end function\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the first part, after modifying s's characters, the second loop uses the modified s. The code in Fortran does that correctly.\n\nWait, in the first loop, s is modified to '\u042f' for the matched characters. Then in the second loop, the characters are taken from the modified s. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing for possible issues:\n\n- The '\u042f' character's ASCII code: in Fortran, when we set s(i:i) = '\u042f', the actual character is stored correctly. But if the original s had a length less than the maximum, the rest of the characters are spaces? Not sure, but since we are using len_trim(s) to get the original length, and processing only up to that, it should be okay.\n\n- The tmap array is of size 0:255, which covers all ASCII characters. So that's okay.\n\n- The reverse_char function: for non-letters, it leaves them as is. For example, '\u042f' is uppercase, so becomes lowercase '\u044f', which is correct.\n\n- The digit_sum function: correctly sums the digits.\n\nNow, the second part uses N = ura, which is the first number from the first program's output. The second number (opa) is not used, which is correct based on the second Java program's input.\n\nThis should work as per the problem's requirements."
