    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file, codeforces_23_B. It reads an integer t, then for each of t test cases, reads an integer n and prints maxLeft(n). The maxLeft function returns n-2 if n>2, else 0. So for each input n, it outputs n-2 or 0.\n\nThe second Java file, codeforces_110_B, takes an integer n, creates a character array of size n, and fills it with characters starting from 'a' (ASCII 97). The way it fills is a bit tricky. Let me see: the loops are for i from 0 to 3, then for j starting at i, stepping by 4 each time. So for i=0, j starts at 0, 4, 8, etc. Then i=1, j starts at 1,5,9..., up to n. Each of these positions gets the current p, which starts at 97 (a) and increments each i loop. So the first four positions (0,1,2,3) get a, b, c, d? Wait, no. Wait, the first loop is i from 0 to 3. For each i, the inner loop starts at j=i and steps by 4. So for i=0, j=0,4,8,... each gets p=97 (a). Then p increments to 98. Next i=1, j=1,5,9... get 98 (b). Then i=2, j=2,6,10... get 99 (c). i=3, j=3,7,11... get 100 (d). Then p would be 101, but since i only goes up to 3, the next p isn't used. The remaining positions (if n is larger than 4) would be filled in the next loops? Wait, no, the outer loop is only up to 3. Wait, the code loops i from 0 to 3 (since for (i=0; i<4; i++)). So after that, the remaining characters (if any) would be left as uninitialized? Wait, in Java, the array is initialized with default values (probably '\\0' or something?), but in the code, they are setting all positions covered by the loops. Let me see: for n=5, for example, the indices 0,1,2,3 are covered by the first four i's. Then for i=0, j=0,4 (since 4 <5). So j=4 would be set to a (since p starts at 97 for i=0). Then i=1, j=1,5 (but 5 is beyond n=5, so only 1. So the fifth element (index 4?) Wait, in Java arrays are 0-based. So for n=5, indices 0-4. So for i=0, j starts at 0, then 4 (since 0+4=4 <5). So j=0 and 4 are set to a. Then i=1, j starts at 1, then 5 which is beyond, so only 1 is set to b. i=2: j=2,6 (over), so 2 is c. i=3: j=3,7 (over), so 3 is d. So the array would be a, b, c, d, a. So the output would be \"abcda\".\n\nWait, but the code in the second Java program is supposed to generate a string where each group of 4 characters starting from a is placed in the array. So the pattern is a, b, c, d, a, b, c, d, etc. So for n=5, the first five elements would be a, b, c, d, a. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two Java programs. The first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. The first program reads t test cases, each with n, and for each, outputs maxLeft(n). So the output of the first program is a series of numbers. Then the second program takes that as input? Wait, but the second program expects a single integer n as input. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the first program's output is multiple numbers (each line is a number from the first program's output). The second program expects to read a single integer n. So how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a single number? Let me check the first Java code again. The first program's main method reads t test cases, then for each, reads n and outputs maxLeft(n). So the output is t lines, each being the result of maxLeft(n). But the second program expects to read a single integer n. So the output of the first program must be a single integer, which is then the input to the second. That suggests that the first program is only processing one test case. Wait, but the first program's input is t followed by t numbers. So perhaps the user is supposed to run the first program, which outputs t numbers, then the second program takes the first of those numbers as input? Or maybe the first program's output is a single number, so t must be 1. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the first program's output is a single number, so the input to the first program must have t=1, so that the output is one number, which is then the input to the second program. Otherwise, if the first program outputs multiple numbers, the second program would read the first one as n, but the rest would be ignored. But the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be a single integer, so that the second can read it as n. Therefore, the first program must have t=1, so that it outputs one number. So the first program's input is t (which is 1), then n, and outputs maxLeft(n). Then the second program takes that output (the number) as its input n, and produces the string.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is: the first program reads t (which is 1), then n, computes maxLeft(n), outputs that number. The second program reads that number as its n, and outputs the string as per its code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the t and the n for the first program), process them through the first's logic, then pass the result to the second's logic, and output the final string.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read t (which is 1) and n from input.\n\n2. Compute the first program's output: m = maxLeft(n) (i.e., m = n-2 if n>2 else 0).\n\n3. Use m as the input to the second program's logic, which generates the string based on m.\n\n4. Output the string from the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (t and n), compute m, then compute the string for m, then output that string.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part: the first Java program's logic.\n\nThe maxLeft function is straightforward: if n >2, return n-2 else 0.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program's logic. Let's see how to implement that in Fortran.\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThey create a char array of size n (m in our case, since m is the input here). Then loops i from 0 to 3 (since for (i=0; i<4; i++)). For each i, loop j starting at i, step 4, up to n-1 (since in Java, array indices are 0-based). For each j, set c[j] to (char)p, where p starts at 97 (a) and increments each i loop.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare them with a lower bound. Alternatively, adjust indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of Fortran arrays. Let's say the array is of size m (the input to the second program). Let's declare it as a character array of length m.\n\nInitialize all elements first? Or just set the required ones. Since in Java, the array is initialized with default values, but in the code, all positions are covered by the loops. Wait, for n (m here) up to 4, the loops cover all positions. For larger n, like 5, the first 4 elements are set in the first four i's, and then the fifth (index 4 in 0-based) is set in i=0's loop (since j starts at 0, then 4, which is within 5). So all positions are covered. So in Fortran, we can loop similarly.\n\nIn Fortran, the indices can be 1-based. Let me see:\n\nSuppose m is the input (the result from first program). We need to create a character array of length m. Let's use 1-based indices.\n\nThe loops in the second Java program:\n\nfor (i from 0 to 3):\n\n   p starts at 97 (a), then increments each i.\n\n   for j from i to n-1 step 4:\n\n       c[j] = (char)p\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo i = 0, 3\n\n   p = 97 + i  ! since p starts at 97, then 98, etc.\n\n   do j = i+1, m, 4  ! Wait, need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, if we use 1-based, then the first element is 1. So for i=0 in Java, the starting j is 0 (Java's index 0 is Fortran's 1?), no. Wait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based in Fortran for easier translation. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of Fortran arrays with 1-based indices.\n\nSuppose m is the input (the value from first program). The array is of length m, indices 1 to m.\n\nThe Java code's first loop is i from 0 to 3 (four iterations). For each i, the inner loop starts at j = i (Java's 0-based) and steps by 4. So in Fortran, the starting index would be (i+1) (since 0 becomes 1?), but maybe it's better to adjust variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's reindex:\n\nLet me think of the Fortran array as 1-based. So for each i in 0 to 3 (Java's i):\n\nJava's j starts at i (0-based), so in Fortran, that's j starts at i+1 (since 0 becomes 1). The step is 4, so in Fortran, the loop would be from (i+1) to m, stepping by 4.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is for (j = i; j < n; j +=4). So in Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo j = i, m-1, 4  (since in 0-based, n is the length, so the last index is n-1. In Fortran, m is the length, so the last index is m. So perhaps:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use 0-based in Fortran. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's use 0-based in Fortran by declaring the array with a lower bound of 0.\n\nIn Fortran, you can declare an array like this:\n\ninteger, parameter :: m = ... \n\ncharacter(len=1) :: c(0:m-1)\n\nThen the indices would be 0 to m-1, matching Java's 0-based.\n\nSo for the second part:\n\nInitialize c as an array of length m, with 0-based indices.\n\np starts at 97 (ASCII for 'a'). For each i from 0 to 3:\n\n   do j = i, m-1, 4\n\n       c(j) = char(p)\n\n   end do\n\n   p = p + 1\n\nWait, but in Java, p starts at 97, then increments after each i loop. So in Fortran:\n\np = 97\n\ndo i = 0, 3\n\n   do j = i, m-1, 4\n\n       c(j) = char(p)\n\n   end do\n\n   p = p + 1\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the first i is 0, so p is 97, then after the loop, p becomes 98, etc. So yes, that's correct.\n\nOnce the array is filled, we need to output the characters in order. In Fortran, we can write them all in a single write statement.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial input: first t (which is 1), then n.\n\n2. Compute m = max(0, n-2) if n>2 else 0.\n\nWait, the maxLeft function is n-2 when n>2, else 0. So m = n -2 if n>2, else 0.\n\n3. Then, compute the string based on m as per the second program's logic.\n\n4. Output the string.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe need to read t and n. Since t is the number of test cases, but in our case, it's 1, but the code must handle it as per the first program.\n\nWait, the first program's code is:\n\nRead t, then for each of t test cases, read n and output maxLeft(n). So the output of the first program is t numbers. But the second program expects a single integer n. So the only way this works is if t is 1, so that the first program's output is one number, which is the input to the second program. So the Fortran program must read t and n, compute m as the first program's output for that n (since t is 1, but the code must process all t test cases? Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is t numbers, each being the maxLeft of each n. But the second program expects a single n. So the first program's output must be exactly one number, so t must be 1, and the first program's output is the maxLeft of the first n. So the Fortran program must read t (which is 1), then read t numbers (so one n), compute m as maxLeft(n), then pass m to the second program's logic.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read t, then read t numbers (n1, n2, ... nt), but since t is 1, it's just one n. Then compute m as maxLeft(n1), then process m through the second program's code.\n\nWait, but the first program's code is written to process all t test cases. So in the Fortran code, we have to process all t test cases, but the second program can only take one input. Therefore, the only way this works is if t is 1, so that the first program's output is a single number, which is then the input to the second program. So the Fortran program must read t, then read t numbers, compute the first program's outputs (but only the first one is used?), but no, the second program needs the output of the first program's entire processing. Wait, no, the second program's input is the output of the first program. So if the first program outputs multiple numbers, the second program would read them as its input. But the second program expects a single integer n. So the first program's output must be exactly one number, so t must be 1, and the first program's output is that one number. Therefore, the Fortran program must read t (which is 1), then read n, compute m = maxLeft(n), then process m through the second program's code.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nRead t and n (since t is 1, but code must read it properly).\n\nCompute m = if n>2 then n-2 else 0.\n\nThen, process m through the second program's logic, which requires m to be the input n for the second program.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read t and n. Let's declare variables:\n\ninteger :: t, n, m\n\nThen read them:\n\nread*, t, n\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the first input is t, then for each of t test cases, read n. So in the first program, the input is t followed by t numbers. So in the Fortran code, we need to read t, then read t numbers. But since the second program can only take one input, the first program's output is t numbers, but the second program will read the first one? Or all of them? Wait, the second program's input is the output of the first program. So the first program's output is t lines, each being the maxLeft of each n. The second program would read the first line as its n, and ignore the rest? Or perhaps the second program is expecting a single n, so the first program must output exactly one number, so t must be 1. Therefore, the Fortran code must process all t test cases, but the second program's input is the first output of the first program? Or the sum? No, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's entire output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a single integer. Therefore, the first program must output exactly one integer, so t must be 1, and the first program's output is that one integer. Therefore, the Fortran code must read t (which is 1), then read t numbers (so one n), compute m as the first program's output (the maxLeft of that n), then process m through the second program's code.\n\nTherefore, the code steps are:\n\nRead t and then read t numbers (n1, n2, ... nt). But since t is 1, it's just one n. Then compute m as maxLeft(n1). Then process m through the second program's code.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the code reads t, then for each of t times, reads n and outputs maxLeft(n). So the output is t numbers. The second program's input is those t numbers. But the second program expects a single integer. So this is only possible if t is 1, so that the first program's output is one number, which is the input to the second program. Therefore, the Fortran code must read t (which is 1), then read t numbers (so one n), compute m as the first program's output (the maxLeft of that n), then process m through the second program's code.\n\nTherefore, the code structure is:\n\nRead t and n (but actually, after reading t, read t numbers, but since t is 1, it's just one n).\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read t followed by t numbers, you can do:\n\nread*, t\n\nread*, (n_i, i=1,t)\n\nBut in our case, since we need only the first n (if t>1, but the second program can't handle it), but according to the problem's setup, the first program's output must be exactly one number, so t must be 1. So the code can proceed as:\n\nRead t, then read n (since t is 1, so only one n).\n\nWait, but in code, to handle it properly, perhaps:\n\nRead t.\n\nThen read t numbers into an array, then take the first one's maxLeft?\n\nWait, but the first program's output is for each n in the input, so the second program's input would be all those outputs. But the second program expects a single integer. So the only way this works is if t is 1, so the code can proceed as:\n\nRead t, then read n (since t is 1, so only one n).\n\nThen compute m = maxLeft(n).\n\nThen process m through the second program's code.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: t, n, m, i, j, p\n\n  character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read*, t, n  ! Wait, no. Wait, the first program's input is first t, then t numbers. So the input is t followed by t numbers. So in Fortran, to read that, we need to read t first, then read t numbers.\n\n  ! So first read t:\n\n  read*, t\n\n  ! Then read t numbers:\n\n  allocate( temp_array(t) )\n\n  read*, temp_array\n\n  ! Then, the first program's output is the maxLeft of each of those numbers, but the second program can only take one input. So assuming t is 1, then m is maxLeft(temp_array(1))\n\n  ! But to make it general, perhaps the code should process all t test cases, but the second program's input is the first output?\n\n  ! However, according to the problem's setup, the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program that behaves the same as the original chain. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is t numbers, each line. The second program reads its input as a single integer n, so the second program would read the first number from the first program's output, and the rest are ignored. But the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So perhaps the first program's output is exactly one number, so t must be 1. Therefore, the code can proceed under the assumption that t is 1.\n\n  ! So proceed under that assumption.\n\n  ! So:\n\n  if (t /= 1) then\n\n     write(*,*) \"Error: t must be 1\"\n\n     stop\n\n  end if\n\n  n = temp_array(1)\n\n  deallocate(temp_array)\n\n  ! Compute m = maxLeft(n)\n\n  if (n > 2) then\n\n     m = n -2\n\n  else\n\n     m = 0\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Now process m through the second program's logic.\n\n  ! Now, the second program's code:\n\n  ! Need to create a character array of size m.\n\n  if (m <0) then\n\n     ! but m is 0 or positive?\n\n     m = max(0, m)\n\n  end if\n\n  allocate(c(0:m-1))  ! 0-based array of length m.\n\n  p = 97  ! ASCII 'a'\n\n  do i = 0, 3\n\n     do j = i, m-1, 4\n\n        c(j) = char(p)\n\n     end do\n\n     p = p +1\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Now output the array.\n\n  write(*,'(A)') trim(transfer(c, ' '))\n\n  ! Wait, how to output the array as a string.\n\n  ! Alternatively, loop through each character and write.\n\n  ! In Fortran, to print the array as a string:\n\n  write(*,'(A)') (c(k), k=0, m-1)\n\n  ! But the indices are 0-based. The format should be A to print characters.\n\n  ! Alternatively, since the array is 0-based, the elements are c(0) to c(m-1).\n\n  ! The write statement can be:\n\n  write(*,'(1000A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\n  ! Or better, use a format that can handle variable length.\n\n  ! Alternatively, use a character string:\n\n  character(len=m) :: output\n\n  output = ''\n\n  do j =0, m-1\n\n     output(j+1:j+1) = c(j)\n\n  end do\n\n  write(*,'(A)') trim(output)\n\n  ! Hmm, perhaps the first approach is better.\n\n  ! Let me think: the array c is of length m, 0-based. To print all elements in order:\n\n  write(*,'(A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\n  ! The A format will print each character as is.\n\n  deallocate(c)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the 'A' format descriptor is for strings. So when you have a list of characters, you can use something like:\n\nwrite(*,'(1000A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to use a character string and build it.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is 0-based, and each element is a single character, the following should work:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') c(0:m-1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have an array of characters, you can output them as a string. For example, if c is a character array of length m, then:\n\nwrite(*,*) c\n\nBut in this case, since it's a 0-based array, perhaps the syntax is different. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\nThis will print each character in sequence.\n\nTesting this logic:\n\nSuppose m=5 (so n was 7, since m =7-2=5).\n\nThen the array c has indices 0-4.\n\nThe loops:\n\ni from 0 to 3:\n\ni=0:\n\np=97 (a)\n\nloop j from 0,4 (since step 4, up to 4 (since m-1=4).\n\nj=0: c(0) = 'a'\n\nj=4: c(4) = 'a'\n\nThen p becomes 98.\n\ni=1:\n\np=98 (b)\n\nloop j from 1,5 (but 5 is beyond 4 (since m-1=4). So j=1.\n\nc(1) = 'b'\n\np becomes 99.\n\ni=2:\n\np=99 (c)\n\nj starts at 2, then 6 (over). So j=2.\n\nc(2) = 'c'\n\np becomes 100.\n\ni=3:\n\np=100 (d)\n\nj starts at 3, then 7 (over). So j=3.\n\nc(3) = 'd'\n\np becomes 101.\n\nSo the array is:\n\nindices 0:a, 1:b, 2:c, 3:d, 4:a.\n\nSo the string is \"abcda\", which matches the earlier example. So the code works.\n\nNow, handling the case when m is 0. For example, if n=2, then m=0. Then the array is of size 0, so nothing is printed. The second program would have n=0, but in Java, the code would have n=0, but the array creation would be new char[0], and the loops would not run. So the output is an empty string. The Fortran code would allocate c(0:-1) which is invalid. Wait, if m is 0, then m-1 is -1, so the array allocation would be allocate(c(0:-1)), which is an array of size 0. In Fortran, that's allowed. Then the loops would not execute, and the write statement would have 0 elements, so nothing is printed. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3. Then m=1 (since 3>2, so 3-2=1). So m=1.\n\nThe array is size 1 (indices 0).\n\ni=0:\n\np=97.\n\nj starts at 0, step 4. So j=0 (since 0 <1 (m=1, m-1=0). So c(0)=a.\n\nThen p increments to 98.\n\ni=1: loop runs, but j starts at 1, which is beyond 0. So no change.\n\ni=2 and 3 similarly. So the array is 'a', so output is 'a'.\n\nAnother case: n=4. m=2. So m=2.\n\nWait, n=4>2, so m=4-2=2. So m=2.\n\nThe array has indices 0 and 1.\n\ni=0:\n\np=97.\n\nj starts at 0, step 4. So j=0 (since 0 <2. Next step would be 4, which is beyond. So c(0)=a.\n\ni=1:\n\np=98.\n\nj starts at 1, step4. j=1 <2. So c(1)=b.\n\ni=2: p=99, j starts at 2 (which is beyond 1, so no change.\n\ni=3: same.\n\nSo the array is 'ab', so output is 'ab'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nWait, in the code above, after reading t and the array, we have to check if t is 1. But according to the problem's setup, the input must be such that the first program's output is a single number, so t must be 1. So the code can proceed under that assumption, but perhaps the problem expects the code to handle any t, but the second program can only take one input. However, the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program that behaves identically. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first program's output, which is t numbers. But the second program expects a single integer. Therefore, the only way this works is if t is 1. So the code can assume that t is 1, and proceed.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as:\n\nRead t, then read t numbers. Take the first one's maxLeft as m.\n\nBut in code:\n\nWe need to read t, then read t numbers. So in Fortran:\n\nread*, t\n\nallocate(numbers(t))\n\nread*, numbers(1:t)\n\nn = numbers(1)\n\ndeallocate(numbers)\n\nThen compute m.\n\nBut in code, the code I wrote earlier uses a temporary array. Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: t, n, m, i, j, p\n\n  integer, allocatable :: temp_array(:)\n\n  character(len=1), allocatable :: c(:)\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read*, t\n\n  allocate(temp_array(t))\n\n  read*, temp_array\n\n  ! Check if t is 1 (since the second program expects a single input)\n\n  if (t /= 1) then\n\n     write(*,*) \"Error: t must be 1\"\n\n     stop\n\n  end if\n\n  n = temp_array(1)\n\n  deallocate(temp_array)\n\n  ! Compute m = maxLeft(n)\n\n  if (n > 2) then\n\n     m = n -2\n\n  else\n\n     m = 0\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Now process m through the second program's logic.\n\n  if (m <0) then\n\n     m = 0\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Allocate character array (0-based)\n\n  allocate(c(0:m-1))\n\n  p = 97\n\n  do i = 0, 3\n\n     do j = i, m-1, 4\n\n        c(j) = char(p)\n\n     end do\n\n     p = p +1\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the array\n\n  if (m >0) then\n\n     write(*,'(A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\n  else\n\n     write(*,*)\n\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(c)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when m is 0, the array is of size 0, so the loop doesn't run, and the write statement would have no characters. The 'if (m>0)' is not necessary, but to avoid writing an empty array. Alternatively, the write statement can handle it.\n\nTesting when m=0:\n\nThe array is allocated as 0:m-1 = 0:-1, which is an array of size 0. The loop doesn't execute. The write statement (c(j), j=0, m-1) would have j from 0 to -1, which is no elements. So the write statement would output nothing, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code can omit the if statement and just write:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\nBut in Fortran, when the list is empty, it just outputs nothing.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') (c(j), j=0, m-1)\n\nSo the final code would be as above.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, so m=0. The output is empty string. Correct.\n\nn=1: m=0, same.\n\nn=5: m=3 (5-2=3). Wait, no, 5-2 is 3, so m=3. Wait, n=5>2, so m=3.\n\nWait, m=5-2=3. So m=3.\n\nThe array has indices 0,1,2.\n\ni=0:\n\np=97.\n\nj starts at 0, step4. So j=0 (0 <3). Then next step is 4, which is beyond. So c(0)=a.\n\ni=1:\n\np=98.\n\nj starts at 1, step4. j=1 <3. So c(1)=b.\n\ni=2:\n\np=99.\n\nj starts at 2, step4. j=2 <3. So c(2)=c.\n\ni=3:\n\np=100.\n\nj starts at 3, which is beyond 2. So no change.\n\nSo the array is 'a','b','c' \u2192 'abc'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=6 \u2192 m=4.\n\nThe array has indices 0-3.\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0,4 (but 4 is beyond 3 (since m-1=3). So j=0.\n\nc(0)=a.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1,5 (over). So c(1)=b.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=2 \u2192 c(2)=c.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=3 \u2192 c(3)=d.\n\nSo the array is 'abcd'.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThus, the code should work."
