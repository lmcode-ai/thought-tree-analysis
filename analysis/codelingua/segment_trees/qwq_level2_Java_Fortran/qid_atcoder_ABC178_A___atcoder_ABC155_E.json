    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC178_A) takes an integer input X. It checks if X is 1. If it is, then the result is 0, else it's 1. Wait, no, looking at the code again: the result is set as !bool ? 1 : 0. Wait, let's see. The bool is true when x is 1. So !bool would be false when x is 1, so the result is 1 when x is 1? Wait, no. Let me parse that again. \n\nThe code says: bool = x ==1 ? true : false. So if x is 1, bool is true. Then result is !bool ? 1 : 0. So if !bool is true (i.e., bool is false), then result is 1. Otherwise (if !bool is false, meaning bool is true), result is 0. Wait, so when x is 1, result is 0. When x is not 1, result is 1. So the first program inverts the value of (x ==1). So if input is 1, output is 0, else 1. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Let's see:\n\nIf x is 1, then bool is true. Then !bool is false. So the condition in the ternary is false, so the result is 0. Correct. So the first program's output is 0 when input is 1, else 1. \n\nSo the first program's output is 1 - (x ==1). Because if x is 1, output is 0, else 1. So the first program's output is 1 minus the boolean (x==1). \n\nNow the second program (atcoder_ABC155_E) takes a string input (number), which is a number, and processes its digits. Let me see what it does. \n\nThe second program's input is a string, which is the number. It reverses the digits (since it's stored in digits array in reverse order, starting from the end). The digits array is of length number.length() +1. \n\nThen, it processes each digit to compute the number of bills. The algorithm seems to be handling some kind of coin change problem, maybe for a currency where each digit's contribution depends on its value and the next digit. \n\nThe code loops through each digit (from 0 to number.length(), which is the length of the original string plus 1?), and does some operations. Let me try to parse the steps:\n\nFirst, for each digit in digits array (from 0 to length of number):\n\nWait, the first loop is for i from 0 to number.length() -1, since the original digits array is initialized with length number.length() +1. Wait, the first loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n    digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() - 1 - i) - '0';\n}\n\nSo the digits array is filled with the reversed digits of the input string. The first element (digits[0]) is the last digit of the input string, etc. The digits array has an extra element (digits[number.length()]) which is initially 0? Because the loop only runs up to i < number.length(), so digits[number.length()] is not initialized here. \n\nThen, the second loop is for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nSo the loop runs from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). \n\nInside the second loop:\n\nFirst, if digits[i] ==10, then we carry over to the next digit. So digits[i+1] is incremented, and digits[i] set to 0. \n\nWait, but how can digits[i] be 10? Because in the first loop, each digit is set to the character minus '0', so digits[i] would be between 0-9. So maybe this is part of the processing in the second loop. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is handling some kind of digit manipulation where digits can temporarily exceed 9, and then carry over. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe first check is if digits[i] ==10, then carry over. So that's a case where the digit is 10, so we add 1 to the next digit and set current to 0. \n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, the bills are calculated. \n\nThe bills variable is being accumulated. \n\nThe logic for each digit:\n\nIf the digit is less than 5, add the digit to bills. \n\nIf it's exactly 5, add 5, but check if the next digit is >=5. If so, carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nIf it's more than 5, then carry over 1 to the next digit, and add (10 - digit) to bills. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nElse if (digits[i] ==5) {\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n        digits[i+1]++;\n    }\n    bills +=5;\n}\n\nElse (digits[i] >5) {\n    digits[i+1]++;\n    bills += 10 - digits[i];\n}\n\nHmm. So for digits greater than 5, the contribution is 10 - digit (so like, if digit is 6, it's 4, which would be the minimal coins needed?), and then carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nWait, perhaps this is calculating the minimal number of coins needed when each digit can be represented in a way that uses coins of 1, 5, etc. \n\nBut the exact logic is a bit unclear, but the code is given, so I need to translate it accurately. \n\nNow, the problem is to chain the two Java programs. The first program takes an integer X as input, outputs 0 or 1. Then the second program takes that output (which is a number, either 0 or 1) as its input, and processes it as a string. \n\nWait, but the second Java program expects a string input (number = sc.next();). So the output of the first program is a number (0 or 1), which is then passed as a string to the second program. \n\nSo the first program's output is a single integer (0 or 1), which is the input to the second program. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the initial input (the X for the first program), process it through the first program's logic, then take that result and process it through the second program's logic, and output the final result of the second program. \n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial integer X (from stdin).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (0 or 1).\n\n3. Use that result as the input to the second program's processing. \n\n4. Output the second program's result. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read X from input.\n\n- Compute first_result = 0 if X ==1 else 1.\n\n- Then, take first_result as the input to the second program's processing. \n\nBut the second program expects a string input (the number as a string). So the first_result (0 or 1) must be converted to a string, then processed as per the second program's logic. \n\nWait, the second program's input is a string, which is the number. So the first program's output is an integer (0 or 1), which is then passed as a string to the second program. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the first_result (0 or 1) is the input to the second part. \n\nSo the second part's processing is done on the string representation of first_result. \n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string, so the first program's output (0 or 1) is written as a string. So in the Fortran code, the input to the second part is the string \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the second part's processing will take the string \"0\" or \"1\" as input. \n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead X from input.\n\nCompute first_result = 0 if X ==1 else 1.\n\nThen, process the string representation of first_result (i.e., \"0\" or \"1\") through the second program's logic, and output the result. \n\nNow, translating the second Java program into Fortran. \n\nLet me first parse the second Java program's logic step by step. \n\nThe second program's steps:\n\n1. Read a string (number) from input.\n\n2. Convert it into an array of digits in reverse order, stored in digits array of length (number.length() +1). \n\nWait, the digits array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1]. \n\nThe first loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo the digits array is filled with the reversed digits of the input string. The first element (digits[0]) is the last digit of the input string, etc. The digits array has an extra element (digits[number.length()]) which is initially 0 (since the loop doesn't set it). \n\nThen, the second loop runs from i=0 to i <= number.length() (since the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++)). \n\nWait, number.length() is the length of the input string. So the loop runs for i from 0 to (number.length()), which is the length of the digits array (since digits has length number.length() +1). \n\nIn the second loop:\n\nFirst, check if digits[i] is 10. If so, carry over to next digit. \n\nWait, but how can digits[i] be 10? Because in the first loop, digits[i] is set to the character's digit (0-9). So perhaps during the processing in the second loop, digits[i] can become 10 due to the carry operations. \n\nWait, the code first checks if digits[i] is 10. If so, then digits[i+1] is incremented, and digits[i] set to 0. \n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, the bills are added. \n\nThe code proceeds as follows for each digit:\n\nCase 1: digits[i] <5 \u2192 add digits[i] to bills.\n\nCase 2: digits[i] ==5 \u2192 add 5 to bills. Also, check if the next digit (digits[i+1]) is >=5. If so, increment digits[i+1] by 1. \n\nCase3: digits[i] >5 \u2192 add (10 - digits[i]) to bills. Also, increment digits[i+1] by 1. \n\nWait, but in the code, the case for digits[i] >5 is the else clause. \n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\nthen:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) \u2192 add to bills.\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) \u2192 add 5, check next digit.\n\nelse \u2192 digits[i] >5 \u2192 add 10 - digit, and carry over.\n\nWait, but the first check (digits[i] ==10) is separate. So the code first handles the case where the digit is 10 (due to previous carry?), then proceeds to process the digit's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the first check is to handle any digit that might have been set to 10 in a previous iteration. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the input is \"10\". \n\nThe first loop would reverse it to digits[0] =0, digits[1] =1, and digits[2] (since length is 2, so digits has length 3) is 0. \n\nThen, the second loop runs from i=0 to 2. \n\nAt i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 <5 \u2192 add 0 to bills. \n\nThen, i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 1 <5 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total bills now 1. \n\ni=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills would be 1. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing the carry steps. Let me see. \n\nWait, in the second loop, the first step is to check if digits[i] is 10. \n\nIn the example above, digits[0] is 0, so no. \n\nThen, process the digit. \n\nWait, but perhaps the code is designed to handle digits that may have been set to 10 in previous steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first check is redundant here, but part of the algorithm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is designed to handle digits that can be 10 due to the carry from the previous digit. \n\nWait, let's think of another example. Suppose the input is \"5\". \n\nThen, the digits array after first loop is [5, 0]. \n\nThen, in the second loop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 5 \u2192 check if it's 10? No. \n\nThen, since it's equal to 5, add 5 to bills. \n\nThen check if digits[1] (next digit) is >=5. digits[1] is 0, so no. So no carry. \n\nThen, i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills is 5. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, that's correct. \n\nAnother example: input \"9\". \n\nDigits array after first loop: [9, 0]. \n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9>5 \u2192 so add 1 (10-9=1). Then, increment digits[1] by 1 \u2192 digits[1] becomes 1. \n\nThen, i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\nTotal bills: 1+1=2. \n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nThe algorithm's logic for 9: \n\nThe digit is 9, so 10-9=1 is added. Then carry over 1 to next digit. \n\nThe next digit (originally 0) becomes 1. \n\nThen, processing that digit (1) adds 1. \n\nTotal 2. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nFirst, the first part: \n\nRead X, compute first_result = 0 if X ==1 else 1. \n\nThen, the second part takes the string representation of first_result (either \"0\" or \"1\") and processes it as per the second Java program. \n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the second part would be:\n\n1. Take the string input (the first_result as a string, e.g., \"0\" or \"1\").\n\n2. Reverse the digits and store in an array. \n\nWait, the second program's first step is to reverse the digits. \n\nWait, the first loop in Java reverses the digits. So for the input \"1\", the digits array would be [1, 0]. \n\nWait, let's see for input \"1\":\n\nnumber is \"1\", length 1. \n\ndigits array has length 2 (1+1). \n\nLoop runs for i from 0 to 0 (since number.length() is 1). \n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(0) - '0' \u2192 1. \n\ndigits[1] is 0 (since the loop doesn't set it). \n\nThen, the second loop processes digits[0], digits[1], and digits[2]? Wait, no, the second loop runs up to i <= number.length(). \n\nWait, number.length() is 1, so the loop runs i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\nWait, the digits array has length 2 (since number.length() +1 is 2). So digits[0], digits[1]. \n\nWait, the second loop's upper limit is i <= number.length() \u2192 which is 1. So i runs 0,1. \n\nWait, but digits has length 2, so digits[1] is the second element. \n\nWait, perhaps the digits array is of length (number.length() +1), so for a number of length N, digits has N+1 elements. \n\nSo in the second loop, when i reaches N (the original length), digits[i] is the N+1th element (digits[N] is the last element of the array). \n\nSo in the example of input \"1\", digits[1] is 0 (initialized as 0?), and then during processing, perhaps it gets modified. \n\nNow, in Fortran, to represent this, I need to:\n\n- Read the first_result as an integer (0 or 1), then convert it to a string. \n\nWait, in Fortran, to get the string representation, perhaps using write and read. \n\nAlternatively, since the first_result is either 0 or 1, the string is straightforward. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nRead X from input. \n\nCompute first_result = 0 if X ==1 else 1. \n\nThen, process the string of first_result (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") through the second program's logic. \n\nNow, the second program's processing steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst, the input is a string (the first_result as a string). \n\nLet me denote the input string as s. \n\nThe length of s is len = len_trim(s). \n\nWe need to create an array digits of size (len +1). \n\nInitialize digits(1) to digits(len) as the reversed digits of s. \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. \n\nWait, in Java, the digits array is 0-based. \n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based arrays. \n\nWait, let's think in terms of Fortran arrays. \n\nFirst, the input string s has length n. \n\nWe need to create an array digits of size (n+1). \n\ndigits(1) to digits(n) will be the reversed digits of s. \n\ndigits(n+1) is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, in the first loop of Java, the digits array is filled from 0 to n-1 (since the loop runs for i < n). \n\nSo in Fortran, for i from 1 to n (since the string is 1-based?), the digits array's first n elements are the reversed digits. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the input string is \"123\". \n\nJava's first loop:\n\nfor i from 0 to 2 (since length is 3):\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(2 -i) - '0'. \n\nSo for i=0 \u2192 char at 2 \u2192 '3', so digits[0] =3. \n\ni=1 \u2192 char at 1 \u2192 '2', digits[1]=2. \n\ni=2 \u2192 char at 0 \u2192 '1', digits[2]=1. \n\nThus, the digits array (0-based) is [3,2,1,0]. \n\nIn Fortran, the string is \"123\", length 3. \n\nWe need to create a digits array of size 4 (3+1). \n\ndigits(1) = 3 (the last character), digits(2)=2, digits(3)=1, digits(4)=0. \n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    c = s(i:i)  ! the ith character (Fortran is 1-based)\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(c) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, but to reverse the string, the first character of the reversed array is the last character of the string. \n\nWait, in Java, the first element of digits is the last character of the input string. \n\nIn Fortran, the input string s has characters s(1), s(2), ..., s(n). \n\nTo reverse, for the first element of digits (digits(1)), we take s(n), then digits(2) is s(n-1), etc. \n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    digits(i) = ichar(s(n - i +1 : n -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, let's see for i from 1 to n:\n\nfor i=1 \u2192 n -1 +1 =n \u2192 s(n)\n\ni=2 \u2192 n-2+1 =n-1 \u2192 s(n-1)\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen, digits(n+1) is initialized to 0. \n\nSo after the first step, the digits array is filled. \n\nThen, the second loop in Java runs from i=0 to i <= number.length() (which is n). \n\nIn Fortran, since the digits array is 1-based, the loop would be from i=1 to i <= n+1? \n\nWait, the Java loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to n (since number.length() is n). \n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be i from 1 to n+1 (since the digits array has n+1 elements). \n\nWait, the digits array in Fortran has indices 1 to n+1. \n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, n+1\n\n    ... \n\nend do\n\nNow, inside the loop:\n\nFirst check if digits(i) ==10. \n\nIf so, set digits(i) =0, digits(i+1) +=1. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so digits(i+1) is okay as long as i+1 <= n+1. \n\nWait, when i is n+1, then i+1 would be n+2, which is beyond the array. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the digits array has length n+1, so the maximum index is n. \n\nWait, no, in Java, the digits array is of size number.length() +1 \u2192 which is n+1 elements (indices 0 to n). \n\nSo in the second loop, when i is n (the last index of the array), then i+1 would be n+1, which is the next element. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the digits array has indices 1 to n+1. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the array size. Let me recheck:\n\nIn Java, the digits array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1]. \n\nnumber.length() is n \u2192 digits has n+1 elements (indices 0 to n). \n\nIn Fortran, the digits array should be of size n+1 (elements 1 to n+1). \n\nWait, perhaps I should use 0-based arrays in Fortran for easier translation. \n\nAlternatively, adjust the indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use 0-based arrays in Fortran by using arrays from 0 to n. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be declared with a lower bound of 0. \n\nSo, for example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: digits\n\nBut in Fortran, the default is 1-based, so need to specify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based arrays and adjust the indices accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step. \n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, read X:\n\ninteger :: x, first_result\n\nread*, x\n\nfirst_result = 0\n\nif (x ==1) then\n\n    first_result =0\n\nelse\n\n    first_result =1\n\nend if\n\nThen, process the first_result through the second program's logic. \n\nThe second program's input is the string representation of first_result. \n\nSo, we need to convert first_result to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write and read. \n\ncharacter(len=128) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') first_result\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! to remove leading spaces\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nNow, create the digits array. \n\nallocate(digits(0:n))  ! since in Java it's 0-based with size n+1. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, perhaps better to use 0-based here. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\ndigits array in Java is 0-based with indices 0 to n (since size is n+1). \n\nSo in Fortran, to mirror that, we can have digits(0:n). \n\nThus:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: digits\n\nWait, but n is variable, so we need to allocate dynamically. \n\nAlternatively, since first_result can only be 0 or 1, the string s will be either \"0\" (length 1) or \"1\" (length 1). \n\nWait, wait! The first_result is either 0 or 1, so the input to the second program is a single character. \n\nWait, that's a key point. \n\nBecause the first program's output is either 0 or 1, so the second program's input is a string of length 1 (either \"0\" or \"1\"). \n\nTherefore, the input to the second part is a single character. \n\nSo the length n is 1. \n\nTherefore, the digits array in the second part will have size 2 (0 to 1). \n\nThis simplifies things. \n\nSo, in the second part, the input is a single character (either '0' or '1'). \n\nThus, the processing can be done with n=1. \n\nSo let's proceed with that. \n\nSo, the steps for the second part:\n\ns is the string \"0\" or \"1\". \n\nn = 1. \n\ndigits array is of size 0:1 (since n+1=2). \n\ndigits(0) is the reversed first character (since the input is length 1, reversed is the same). \n\ndigits(1) is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first loop in Java for the input \"0\" (n=1):\n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(0) - '0' \u2192 0. \n\ndigits[1] is 0 (since the loop runs for i <1 \u2192 i=0 only). \n\nThen, the second loop runs from i=0 to 1 (since n=1). \n\nSo in Fortran, with n=1, digits(0) and digits(1) (since 0-based). \n\nThus, in Fortran code:\n\ninteger :: n, bills =0\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: digits\n\nWait, but n is 1 here. \n\nWait, let's code this step by step. \n\nAfter getting first_result (0 or 1):\n\ns = char(ichar('0') + first_result)  ! since first_result is 0 or 1, this gives '0' or '1'\n\nn = 1\n\nallocate(digits(0:n))  ! size 2 (indices 0 and 1)\n\ndigits(0) = ichar(s) - ichar('0')  ! the first (and only) character's digit. \n\ndigits(1) =0 \n\nThen, process the digits array through the second loop. \n\nThe second loop in Java is for i from 0 to n (inclusive). \n\nIn Fortran, loop over i from 0 to n (since n is 1, so 0,1). \n\ndo i =0, n\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n        digits(i) =0\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now process the digit's contribution to bills\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n        bills = bills +5\n\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        end if\n\n    else  ! digits(i) >5\n\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after handling the case where digits[i] is 10, the code proceeds to process the digit's value. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the first check is if (digits[i] ==10). \n\nIf so, then set digits[i] to 0 and increment digits[i+1]. \n\nThen, after that, the code proceeds to the other conditions. \n\nWait, but in the code, after handling the 10 case, the code continues to process the digit's value. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the first check is for digits[i] ==10. \n\nIf that is true, then the code does the carry, but then proceeds to the next part of the code (the if-else chain). \n\nWait, no, the code is structured as:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\nthen, after that, the code has the other conditions. \n\nWait, the code is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\nthen:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) \u2192 add to bills.\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) \u2192 add 5, etc.\n\nelse \u2192 digits[i] >5 \u2192 add 10 - digit, etc. \n\nWait, but after the first check (digits[i] ==10), the digits[i] is set to 0, so the subsequent conditions will see the new value. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the first check is to handle digits[i] being 10 (due to previous carry?), then the rest of the code processes the current digit's value. \n\nSo in the Fortran code, after handling the 10 case, the code proceeds to process the current digit's value (which may have been modified). \n\nThus, the code in Fortran should first check if digits(i) is 10, and if so, do the carry. \n\nThen, process the digit's value (after any possible carry). \n\nWait, but in the code, the first check is separate. \n\nSo the code in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i =0, n\n\n    ! First handle the case where digit is 10\n\n    if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n        digits(i) =0\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now process the digit's contribution to bills\n\n    if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n    else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n        bills = bills +5\n\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n        end if\n\n    else  ! digits(i) >5\n\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the second loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) { ... }\n\n    else if (digits[i] ==5) { ... }\n\n    else { ... }\n\n}\n\nWait, the code in Java has the first if (digits[i] ==10) block, then the other conditions are separate. \n\nWait, no, the code in Java is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\nthen:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) \u2192 add to bills.\n\nelse if (digits[i] ==5) \u2192 add 5, etc.\n\nelse \u2192 add 10 - digit, etc. \n\nSo the first check is for 10, then the other conditions are evaluated on the current digits[i], which may have been modified by the first check. \n\nThus, the code in Fortran is as above. \n\nNow, let's test this with an example. \n\nExample 1: first_result is 0 \u2192 input to second program is \"0\". \n\nProcessing:\n\ndigits(0) =0, digits(1)=0. \n\nLoop over i=0 and 1. \n\ni=0:\n\nCheck if digits(0) is 10 \u2192 no. \n\nThen, since digits(0) is 0 <5 \u2192 add 0 to bills. \n\nThen, proceed. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills is 0. \n\nSo the output is 0. \n\nWait, but according to the second Java program's logic, let's see:\n\nInput \"0\" \u2192 the code would process:\n\ndigits array after first loop: [0,0]. \n\nSecond loop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills 0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: first_result is 1 \u2192 input \"1\". \n\ndigits(0)=1, digits(1)=0. \n\nLoop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0) is 1 \u2192 add 1. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills 1. \n\nSo the output is 1. \n\nAnother test case: first_result is 0 \u2192 output 0. \n\nAnother case: first_result is 1 \u2192 output 1. \n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's output is 0. \n\nWait, but let's see another case where the first program's output is 0 (so input to second is \"0\"), which gives 0. \n\nAnother case: first program's output is 1 \u2192 second program's output is 1. \n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 0, then the second program's output is 0. \n\nWait, but let's see another scenario where the first program's output is 0, but the second program's processing could have a different result. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the code. \n\nWait, let's see the second program's code again. \n\nWait, in the second program's code, the second loop runs for i from 0 to n (where n is the length of the input string). \n\nWait, in the case of input \"0\", the digits array after first loop is [0,0]. \n\nThen, the second loop runs for i=0 and 1. \n\nAt i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nAt i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills 0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: first_result is 0 \u2192 output 0. \n\nAnother example: first_result is 1 \u2192 output 1. \n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 0, but the second program's code would process it as 0 \u2192 correct. \n\nThus, the code seems to work. \n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran. \n\nThe entire Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: x, first_result, bills, n\n    character(len=1) :: s\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\n\n    !

Convert first_result to string (either '0' or '1')\n    s = char(ichar('0') + first_result)\n    n = 1  ! since the string is length 1\n\n    ! Allocate digits array (0-based, size n+1 =2)\n    allocate(digits(0:n))\n    digits(0) = ichar(s) - ichar('0')\n    digits(1) = 0\n\n    bills = 0\n\n    ! Process digits\n    integer :: i\n    do i = 0, n\n        ! Handle case where digit is 10\n        if (digits(i) == 10) then\n            digits(i) = 0\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n        end if\n\n        ! Compute contribution to bills\n        if (digits(i) < 5) then\n            bills = bills + digits(i)\n        else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n            bills = bills + 5\n            if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            end if\n        else  ! digits(i) >5\n            bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print*, bills\n\n    deallocate(digits)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second loop, when i is n (which is 1 in this case), then i+1 is 2. \n\nBut the digits array is allocated as 0:n (size 2), so indices 0 and 1. \n\nThus, when i=1, i+1 is 2, which is beyond the array's upper bound (since n=1, the upper index is 1). \n\nAh, this is a problem. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array has length n+1 (where n is the input length). \n\nIn the second loop, when i is n (the last index of the array), then i+1 would be n+1, which is the next element. \n\nBut in the Fortran code, the digits array is allocated as 0:n (size n+1). \n\nThus, when i is n (the last index), i+1 is n+1, which is beyond the array's upper bound (since the array is 0 to n). \n\nWait, no, the array is 0 to n (indices 0,1 for n=1). \n\nThus, when i is n (1), i+1 is 2, which is beyond the array's upper limit (1). \n\nThis is an error. \n\nAh, here's a mistake. \n\nIn the Java code, the digits array has indices 0 to n (since it's size n+1). \n\nThe second loop runs up to i <= n (since the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 number.length() is n). \n\nThus, when i is n, digits[i] is the last element of the array (digits[n]). \n\nThen, in the code, when we do digits[i+1], that would be digits[n+1], which is beyond the array's size. \n\nWait, but in Java, the array is of size n+1, so the indices go up to n. \n\nThus, when i is n, digits[i+1] would be digits[n+1], which is out of bounds. \n\nWait, this is a problem in the original Java code. \n\nWait, let me check the Java code again. \n\nThe second loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nThe digits array has length number.length() +1 \u2192 indices 0 to number.length(). \n\nThus, when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()]). \n\nThen, in the code, when we do digits[i+1], that would be digits[number.length() +1], which is out of bounds. \n\nWait, this is a bug in the original Java code. \n\nWait, but in the code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then i+1 would be beyond the array. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect. \n\nWait, let me look at the code again. \n\nThe code in the second Java program:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] ==10) { ... }\n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nWait, the loop runs up to i = number.length(). \n\nThe digits array has length number.length() +1 \u2192 indices 0 to number.length(). \n\nThus, when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element. \n\nThen, in the code, when we do digits[i+1], that would be digits[number.length() +1], which is beyond the array's size. \n\nThis is an error. \n\nWait, but in the code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] would be out of bounds. \n\nThis suggests that the original Java code has a bug. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last index (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is not accessed in all cases. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the code, when i is the last index (number.length()), then in the first check (digits[i] ==10), if that is true, then digits[i+1] is incremented. \n\nBut digits[i+1] is beyond the array. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with the assumption that when i is the last index, the digits[i+1] is not needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last index (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is not accessed in the other conditions. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the code, after the first check (digits[i] ==10), the code proceeds to the other conditions. \n\nIn the other conditions (the if-else chain), the only place where digits[i+1] is accessed is in the case when digits[i] ==5. \n\nWait, in the case of digits[i] ==5:\n\nif (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n    }\n\n    bills +=5;\n\n}\n\nSo, when i is the last index (number.length()), then digits[i+1] is out of bounds. \n\nThis is a bug in the original Java code. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to have the digits array of length number.length() +1, so that digits[number.length()] is the carry-over digit. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last index (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is digits[number.length() +1], which is beyond the array. \n\nThis suggests that the code has an off-by-one error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the loop runs up to i <= number.length(), but the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so the maximum i is number.length(), and digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length() +1], which is beyond the array. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct because when i is the last index (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is not accessed except in the case where digits[i] is 5 and we check digits[i+1]. \n\nBut in that case, it would be an out-of-bounds access. \n\nThis suggests that the original code has a bug. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so the last element is digits[number.length()], and the code is designed to allow digits[number.length() +1] to be handled, but that's impossible. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct because when i reaches the last index (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is not accessed except in the case where digits[i] is 5. \n\nBut in that case, it would be an error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the loop is written as i <= number.length(), but the digits array is of size number.length() +1, so the maximum i is number.length(), and digits[i+1] is digits[number.length() +1], which is beyond the array. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nWait, let's take an example where the input is \"9\". \n\nThe input length is 1. \n\ndigits array has length 2 (indices 0 and 1). \n\nThe second loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\nAt i=1 (the last index):\n\ndigits[1] is 0 (initialized to 0). \n\nThen, in the first check (digits[i] ==10 \u2192 no). \n\nThen, since digits[i] is 0 <5 \u2192 add 0. \n\nNo problem. \n\nAnother example where the input is \"5\". \n\ndigits array after first loop: [5,0]. \n\nSecond loop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 5 \u2192 add 5. \n\nCheck digits[1] (0) >=5? No \u2192 no carry. \n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal bills 5. \n\nNo problem. \n\nAnother example where the input is \"10\". \n\nWait, but in our case, the first program's output is 0 or 1, so the second program's input is a single digit. \n\nThus, the problematic case where i is the last index and digits[i+1] is accessed may not occur in our scenario. \n\nWait, in our case, the input to the second program is a single character (0 or 1), so n=1. \n\nThus, the digits array has size 2 (indices 0 and 1). \n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). \n\nAt i=1 (the last index):\n\ndigits[1] is 0 (initialized). \n\nIn the first check (digits[i] ==10 \u2192 no). \n\nThen, since digits[i] is 0 <5 \u2192 add 0. \n\nNo access to digits[2], which is beyond the array. \n\nThus, in our specific case (input length 1), the code is okay. \n\nBut in the general case (if the input were longer), the code would have an off-by-one error. \n\nHowever, since in our problem, the second program's input is always a single character (0 or 1), the code in Fortran is okay. \n\nThus, in the Fortran code, when n=1, the digits array is 0:1 (indices 0 and 1). \n\nWhen i=1 (the last index), the code accesses digits(2) (i+1=2) in the case where digits(1) is 5. \n\nWait, but in our case, digits(1) is 0, so that won't happen. \n\nWait, but in the code, when i=1 (the last index), and digits[i] is 5, then digits[i+1] (digits[2]) is accessed. \n\nBut in our case, the input is 0 or 1, so digits[1] is 0. \n\nThus, in our specific scenario, the code is okay. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is correct for the given problem. \n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as written above, but with the array indices fixed. \n\nWait, in the Fortran code, when i is n (1), then i+1 is 2, which is beyond the array's upper bound (1). \n\nThus, in the code, when i=1 (the last index), and in the case where digits(1) is 5, then digits(2) is accessed, which is out of bounds. \n\nBut in our case, the input is 0 or 1, so digits(1) is 0. \n\nThus, in our specific case, the code is okay. \n\nHowever, to prevent any possible out-of-bounds access, perhaps we can adjust the loop to run up to i = n-1, but that would not match the original code. \n\nAlternatively, since in our case the input is always length 1, the code is safe. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nNow, let's write the final Fortran code. \n\nWait, in the Fortran code, when we have i=1 (the last index), and in the case where digits(1) is 5, then digits(2) is accessed. \n\nBut in our case, digits(1) is 0, so that won't happen. \n\nThus, the code is okay. \n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as follows."
