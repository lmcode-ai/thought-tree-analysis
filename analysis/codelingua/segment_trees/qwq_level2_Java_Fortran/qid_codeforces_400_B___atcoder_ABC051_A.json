But when j is (n - i), then j+1 is (n -i +1), which may be beyond the array's size (since the array is size n). Wait, the array is size n, indices from 1 to n.\n\nWait, the outer loop is from i=1 to n-1. At each iteration of the outer loop (i), the inner loop runs from j=1 to (n - i). So for j from 1 to (n -i), the j+1 is up to (n -i +1). But when i is 1, the inner loop runs up to n-1, so j+1 is up to n, which is okay. Wait, for example, when i=1, the inner loop runs j from 1 to n-1. So j+1 is up to n, which is valid. When i = n-1, the inner loop runs j from 1 to 1 (since n - (n-1) =1). So j=1, j+1=2, but the array is size n, so that's okay.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_400_B. It reads n and m, then an array of strings. For each string, it finds the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If in any string G comes after S, it sets returnDex to -1. Then it calculates the difference between S's position and G's for each string, stores those in an array. It collects all unique differences into a HashSet. Finally, if returnDex is -1, it outputs -1; else, the size of the set.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC051_A, reads a line and replaces commas with spaces, then outputs it.\n\nWait, but the problem says the output of each is input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is either -1 or the number of unique differences. Wait, but the second program expects a string to process (replacing commas). Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the first program's output is either -1 or the size of the set (which is an integer). The second program takes that integer as input? But the second program's input is a string (since it reads a line and replaces commas). That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a number, but the second program expects a string with commas. That would mean that the first program's output is being used as the input to the second, but the second expects a different kind of input. That might be an error in the problem setup, but perhaps I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, but the second program is supposed to process that number as a string? Like, if the first outputs \"5\", then the second would read \"5\" and replace commas (but there are none), so output \"5\". But maybe the first program's output is a string that the second can process. Wait, the first program's output is either -1 or the count of unique lengths. So the second program would read that number as a string, but since it's a number, there are no commas, so the output would be the same. So the final output would be the same as the first program's output. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that contains commas, but that's not the case here. Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is either -1 or the size of the set. So the output is an integer. The second program reads a line (the output of the first), which is a number, and replaces commas with spaces. Since the number doesn't have commas, the output is the same as the input. So the final output would be the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the second program is redundant here, but perhaps the problem requires that the sequence is followed. So the Fortran program must process the first's logic, then the second's logic, even if it's a no-op.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string that the second processes. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a string with commas? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java code's output: it's either System.out.println(returnDex) (which is -1) or System.out.println(set.size()). So the output is an integer. The second program reads a line (the integer as a string), replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. Since the integer has no commas, the output is the same. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the second program's processing doesn't change anything here. But the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program. So the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then pass it through the second's processing.\n\nWait, but the second program's processing is to replace commas with spaces. So if the first program's output is, say, \"5\", then the second program would output \"5\" (since no commas). But if the first program's output was a string with commas, like \"12,34\", then the second would output \"12 34\". But in the first program's case, the output is an integer, so no commas. Therefore, the second program's processing here is a no-op. But the problem requires that the sequence is followed, so the Fortran program must do both steps.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result (the -1 or the set size), then process that result through the second program's logic (replace commas with spaces in the string representation of the result). The final output is the result of that processing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input for the first program (n, m, then n strings).\n\n2. Compute the first program's output (integer).\n\n3. Convert that integer to a string (since the second program processes a string).\n\n4. Replace any commas in that string with spaces (though in this case, the integer's string has no commas, so it remains the same).\n\n5. Output the resulting string.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (n, m, then n strings).\n\n- Process the first program's logic to get the integer result.\n\n- Convert that integer to a string.\n\n- Replace commas with spaces in that string.\n\n- Output the modified string.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first program's steps:\n\n- Read n and m (though m isn't used in the first program's code. Wait, looking at the first Java code, m is read but not used. So perhaps it's a mistake, but in the code, m is not used. So in the Fortran code, we can just read it but ignore it.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, after reading n and m, the code proceeds to read n strings. The m is not used anywhere. So in the Fortran code, we can read it but not use it.\n\nSo in Fortran, the input would be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n strings (each as a line? Or as a single token? The Java code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token, so each string is a single token, possibly with spaces? Wait, no, in Java, Scanner's next() reads the next token, splitting on whitespace. But the problem says that the input for the first program is given via Scanner, so the strings are read as tokens. So in Fortran, perhaps each string is read as a single line, but maybe not. Wait, the code uses sc.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So each string is a single token, so in Fortran, perhaps read each as a single string, but with possible spaces? Wait, no, because next() would split on whitespace, so each string is a single token without spaces. So in Fortran, perhaps read each as a string with no spaces, but the exact handling may need to be considered.\n\nWait, but in the first Java code, the strings are stored in arrs as sc.next() for each. So each string is a single token, so in Fortran, perhaps read each as a string with no spaces. So in Fortran, perhaps read each as a line, but since the input is given as per the original setup, perhaps the input for the first program is given as n followed by m, then n strings each on their own line, or as space-separated tokens. Hmm, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a line (the integer as a string), so the first program's output must be printed as a line. So the first program's output is an integer printed as a line, so the second program reads that line, which is the integer's string, and processes it.\n\nNow, translating the first part's logic into Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n and m (but m is unused). Then read n strings. For each string, find the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If in any string, G is after S, set returnDex to -1. Then compute the difference (dexS - dexG) for each string, collect all unique differences. Finally, output -1 if returnDex is -1, else the count of unique differences.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nWe can read the strings into an array of character arrays. Let's say each string is up to, say, 1000 characters (or some maximum length). But in Java, the strings can be of any length, but in Fortran, we need to define a maximum. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps assume a reasonable size, like 100.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and m (ignoring m).\n\n2. Read n strings, each as a character array (e.g., of length 100).\n\n3. Initialize variables: returnDex = 0, and an array to hold the differences (length array). Also, a way to track unique differences.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the 'length' array is filled with (dexS - dexG) for each string. Then, a hashset is used to collect unique values. So in Fortran, we can collect all the differences into an array, then count the unique ones.\n\nBut in Fortran, handling unique elements can be done by sorting and checking duplicates, or using a logical array to mark presence.\n\nAlternatively, since the differences can be negative (if G is before S, but wait, in the code, if G is after S (dexG > dexS), then returnDex is set to -1. Wait, but in that case, the difference would be negative. However, the code proceeds to add all the differences to the set, but if returnDex is -1, then the output is -1, so the set's size is irrelevant. So the set is only considered if returnDex is not -1.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nFor each string:\n\n- Find dexG (position of G) and dexS (position of S).\n\n- If dexG > dexS, set returnDex to -1.\n\n- Then, compute the difference (dexS - dexG) and store in the length array.\n\nWait, but if returnDex is already set to -1, it's still storing the difference. But in the end, if returnDex is -1, the output is -1, so the set's size is not used. So the set is only relevant when returnDex is 0 (i.e., no string had G after S).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nLoop over each string:\n\n- Find positions of G and S.\n\n- If any string has G after S, set returnDex to -1.\n\n- Compute the difference (dexS - dexG) for each string, store in an array.\n\nThen, collect all the differences into a set (to find unique ones).\n\nFinally, output -1 if returnDex is -1, else the size of the set.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nInitialize returnDex as 0.\n\nRead n strings.\n\nFor each string:\n\n   Find the indices of 'G' and 'S'.\n\n   If G's index > S's index, set returnDex to -1.\n\n   Compute the difference (S's index - G's index) and store in an array.\n\nAfter processing all strings:\n\nIf returnDex is -1, output is -1.\n\nElse, collect all differences into a set (unique values), count them, and output that count.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to find the positions of 'G' and 'S' in each string.\n\nFortran strings are arrays of characters. To find the first occurrence of a character, we can loop through each character until found, or use intrinsic functions.\n\nThe function INDEX can be used. For example, INDEX(string, 'G') gives the position of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string. But note that in Fortran, strings are 1-based, and the INDEX function returns the first occurrence. If not found, it returns 0? Or some other value? Wait, according to Fortran documentation, INDEX returns the position of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns 0. Wait, no, actually, in Fortran 90 and later, the INDEX function returns the position of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns 0. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nYes, the INDEX function in Fortran returns the position of the first occurrence of the substring in the string. If not found, returns 0. So for a string like \"ABC\", INDEX(\"ABC\", \"D\") is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the code, for each string, we can do:\n\ndexG = INDEX(str, 'G')\n\ndexS = INDEX(str, 'S')\n\nBut need to check if either is 0 (meaning the character is not present). Wait, but in the original Java code, the code would have used indexOf, which returns -1 if not found. So in Java, if either G or S is not present in the string, then the code would have a problem. Wait, but in the Java code, the problem's input probably ensures that each string has both G and S. Otherwise, the code would have an error (since dexG or dexS would be -1, leading to a possible negative difference, but the code proceeds). However, the problem's original code may assume that each string has both G and S. So perhaps in the Fortran code, we can proceed under the same assumption.\n\nAssuming that each string has both G and S, so dexG and dexS are positive integers.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, if either is not found, then the code would have an error (since tmp.indexOf would return -1, leading to dexG or dexS being -1, but in the code, the difference would be computed as (dexS - dexG). For example, if G is not present, dexG is -1, so the difference would be (dexS - (-1)) = dexS +1. But the problem's input may not have such cases, so perhaps we can proceed.\n\nBut in the problem's context, perhaps each string contains exactly one G and one S. Otherwise, the code may have undefined behavior. Since the problem is about translating the code, we can proceed as per the code's logic, even if it's not handling all edge cases.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFor each string:\n\ndexG = INDEX(str, 'G')\n\ndexS = INDEX(str, 'S')\n\nIf dexG > dexS, set returnDex to -1.\n\nCompute the difference (dexS - dexG) and store in an array.\n\nNow, after processing all strings, if returnDex is -1, output is -1.\n\nElse, collect all differences into a set (unique values).\n\nTo collect unique values in Fortran, perhaps we can sort the array and then count unique elements, or use an array to track which values have been seen.\n\nAlternatively, since the differences can be negative, but in the case where returnDex is not -1, that means for all strings, G comes before S, so the difference is positive (since dexS is after dexG). Wait, no: if G is before S, then dexG < dexS, so the difference is positive. So the differences are all positive in that case.\n\nWait, but the difference is dexS - dexG. So if G is before S, it's positive. If G is after S, the difference is negative, but in that case, returnDex is set to -1, so the set is not considered.\n\nTherefore, when returnDex is not -1, all differences are positive, so the set can be handled as such.\n\nTo collect unique differences, perhaps we can:\n\n- Create an array of all differences.\n\n- Sort them.\n\n- Then iterate through the sorted array, counting unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a hash-like approach. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash set, but for small n (since the problem's constraints are not given, but assuming n is manageable), we can do it with an array.\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\nAfter collecting all differences into an array (let's say called diffs, of size n):\n\nIf returnDex is -1, then output is -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   Sort the diffs array.\n\n   Initialize a count variable to 1 (if array is non-empty).\n\n   Then loop from the second element to the end:\n\n      if current element is different from previous, increment count.\n\n   The count is the number of unique elements.\n\nThus, the unique count can be found this way.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem: the second Java program takes the output of the first (which is an integer) and processes it by replacing commas with spaces. Since the first program's output is an integer, which when printed as a string has no commas, the second program's output is the same as the first's output. But the problem requires that the entire sequence is translated into a single Fortran program, so the Fortran program must do both steps.\n\nTherefore, after computing the first program's result (either -1 or the count), the Fortran program must convert that integer to a string, replace any commas with spaces, then output the result.\n\nWait, but the integer's string representation (e.g., \"-1\" or \"5\") has no commas, so the replacement does nothing. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the problem requires that the sequence is followed, so the Fortran program must do this step.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing the first result (result1), convert it to a string (str_result).\n\nThen, replace any commas in str_result with spaces.\n\nThen, print the modified string.\n\nBut since there are no commas, the output is the same as the first result's string.\n\nBut the code must do this step.\n\nSo in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with internal write or using the intrinsic function.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, you can use:\n\nWRITE(temp_str, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen, process the string.\n\nThen, replace commas with spaces.\n\nLoop through each character in the string, and if it's a comma, replace with a space.\n\nAlternatively, using the REPEAT function or other string functions. But Fortran's string functions are limited. So perhaps:\n\nDo i = 1, LEN_TRIM(temp_str)\n\n   if (temp_str(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      temp_str(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut need to make sure the string is properly handled.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the Fortran code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m (ignoring m).\n\nRead n strings, each as a character array (e.g., of length 100).\n\nProcess each string to find G and S positions.\n\nCompute differences, track returnDex.\n\nCollect differences into an array.\n\nIf returnDex is -1, then result1 is -1.\n\nElse, compute the number of unique differences.\n\nThen, convert result1 to a string.\n\nReplace commas with spaces.\n\nPrint the modified string.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, returnDex, i, j, count_unique, diff, current_diff\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: strings(1000)  ! Assuming n up to 1000, each string up to 100 chars.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: diffs(:)\n\nBut need to read n first. So perhaps:\n\nRead *, n, m\n\nallocate(diffs(n))\n\nThen read the n strings:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read *, strings(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the strings are read via sc.next(), which is the next token. In Fortran, using read *, would read each string as a single token (split by whitespace). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading a string with read *, it may read until whitespace. So that's equivalent to sc.next().\n\nNow, processing each string:\n\nreturnDex = 0\n\nallocate(diffs(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   string = strings(i)\n\n   dexG = INDEX(string, 'G')\n\n   dexS = INDEX(string, 'S')\n\n   if (dexG > dexS) then\n\n      returnDex = -1\n\n   end if\n\n   diffs(i) = dexS - dexG\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the INDEX function is case-sensitive? The problem's code uses 'G' and 'S', so assuming the input strings have uppercase letters.\n\nAssuming that the input strings are in uppercase.\n\nNow, after collecting diffs, if returnDex is -1, then result1 is -1.\n\nElse, need to count unique elements in diffs.\n\nTo count unique elements:\n\nif (returnDex == -1) then\n\n   result1 = -1\n\nelse\n\n   ! Sort diffs array\n\n   call sort(diffs)\n\n   count_unique = 1\n\n   do i = 2, n\n\n      if (diffs(i) /= diffs(i-1)) then\n\n         count_unique = count_unique + 1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   result1 = count_unique\n\nend if\n\nBut need to implement a sort function. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in sort for arrays, we can write a simple bubble sort or use the intrinsic function if available.\n\nAlternatively, use the Mergesort or another method. Alternatively, use the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module's sort, but perhaps it's better to write a simple sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function if available in Fortran 90.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can use the MERGE and other functions, but for sorting an array of integers, perhaps the easiest way is to use the built-in sort via the 'SORT' intrinsic. Wait, no, there is no built-in sort function. So we need to write our own.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' subroutine from the ISO_C_BINDING or other modules, but perhaps it's easier to write a simple bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' function from the standard library. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to write a simple bubble sort for the array.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' intrinsic via the 'ieee' module? Not sure. Let me think of a simple approach.\n\nImplement a bubble sort for the diffs array.\n\nSubroutine to sort an integer array:\n\nsubroutine bubble_sort(arr, n)\n\n   integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   integer :: i, j, temp\n\n   do i = 1, n-1\n\n      do j = 1, n-i\n\n         if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n            temp = arr(j)\n\n            arr(j) = arr(j+1)\n\n            arr(j+1) = temp\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine bubble_sort\n\nBut in the code, the array is diffs, which is allocated with size n. So in the main program:\n\ncall bubble_sort(diffs, n)\n\nThen proceed to count unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a different sorting method.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' intrinsic if available. Wait, in Fortran 95, there is a 'SORT' function in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or perhaps the 'SORT' is part of the array functions.\n\nWait, no, the standard way is to use the 'SORT' intrinsic via the 'ieee' module? Not sure. Alternatively, use the 'MERGE' function, but that's for merging sorted arrays.\n\nHmm, perhaps the easiest way is to write a simple bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'STABLE_SORT' from some module, but perhaps it's better to proceed with a simple bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'SORT' function from the standard library. Wait, perhaps the following code can be used:\n\ncall sort(diffs)\n\nBut I think that's not standard. So better to write the bubble sort.\n\nNow, putting this into the code.\n\nOnce the array is sorted, then count the unique elements.\n\nNow, after getting result1, convert it to a string.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_result\n\nwrite(str_result, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen, replace commas with spaces.\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(str_result)\n\n   if (str_result(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      str_result(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, print str_result.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, m, returnDex, i, j, count_unique, result1\n\n   integer, allocatable :: diffs(:)\n\n   character(len=100), dimension(:), allocatable :: strings\n\n   !

Let me check the bubble sort code.\n\nThe standard bubble sort:\n\nfor i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for j from 0 to n-i-2:\n\n      compare elements j and j+1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the inner loop in the code above is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ndo j = 1, n - i\n\n   if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n      swap\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, the upper limit is n - i. So j runs from 1 to (n - i). But when j is (n - i), then j+1 is (n -i +1), which may be beyond the array's size (since the array is size n). Wait, the array is size n, indices from 1 to n.\n\nWait, the outer loop is from i=1 to n-1.\n\nAt each iteration of the outer loop (i), the inner loop runs from j=1 to (n - i).\n\nSo for j from 1 to (n -i), the j+1 is up to (n -i +1). But when i is 1, the inner loop runs up to n-1, so j+1 is up to n, which is okay.\n\nWait, for example, when i=1, the inner loop runs j from 1 to n-1. So j+1 is up to n, which is valid.\n\nWhen i = n-1, the inner loop runs j from 1 to 1 (since n - (n-1) =1). So j=1, j+1=2, but the array is size n, so that's okay.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner loop should be from 1 to n - i -1. Let me think:\n\nThe standard bubble sort for an array of size n:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)\n\n   for (j = 0; j < n - i -1; j++)\n\n      if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) swap.\n\nIn Fortran, with 1-based indices:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n\n   do j = 1, n - i\n\n      if (arr(j) > arr(j+1)) then\n\n         swap\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, the inner loop's upper limit is n -i. So j runs from 1 to (n -i). The j+1 is up to (n -i +1). But when j is (n -i), then j+1 is (n -i +1). But the array is size n, so when i is 1, n -i is n-1, so j+1 is n, which is okay. When i is n-1, the inner loop runs j from 1 to 1, so j+1 is 2, but the array is size n, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration (i=1), the inner loop runs j from 1 to n-1, so j+1 is up to n. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nTesting with a small example:\n\nSuppose n=3, diffs = [5,3,4]\n\nAfter first pass (i=1):\n\nj runs from 1 to 2 (since n-i = 3-1=2).\n\nFirst j=1: compare 5 and 3 \u2192 swap \u2192 [3,5,4]\n\nj=2: compare 5 and 4 \u2192 swap \u2192 [3,4,5]\n\nAfter first pass, the array is [3,4,5].\n\nSecond pass (i=2):\n\nInner loop runs j from 1 to 1 (3-2=1).\n\nj=1: compare 3 and 4 \u2192 no swap.\n\nSo the array remains [3,4,5].\n\nThus, sorted correctly.\n\nAnother test case: [3,1,2].\n\nFirst pass (i=1):\n\nj runs 1 to 2.\n\nj=1: 3 vs 1 \u2192 swap \u2192 [1,3,2]\n\nj=2: 3 vs 2 \u2192 swap \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nSecond pass (i=2):\n\nj runs 1 to 1.\n\nj=1: 1 vs 2 \u2192 no swap.\n\nThus sorted.\n\nSo the bubble sort code works.\n\nNow, the rest of the code.\n\nNow, the strings are read with read *, strings(i). But in Fortran, when reading a string with read *, it reads until whitespace. So if the input strings have spaces, this would split them. But according to the first Java code, the strings are read via sc.next(), which also splits on whitespace. So this is correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle everything.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All strings have G before S, and all differences are unique.\n\nE.g., n=3, m=0, strings: \"G S\", \"GSS\", \"GGSS\".\n\nWait, but the strings are read as tokens, so \"G S\" would be read as two separate strings? No, because sc.next() would read \"G\" and then \"S\" as separate strings. Wait, no, the code in the first Java program reads n strings via sc.next() each. So if the input line after n and m has the strings separated by spaces, each is a separate string. So in the example, if the input is:\n\n3 0\n\nG S GSS GGSS\n\nThen the strings would be \"G\", \"S\", \"GSS\", but n is 3, so that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps the input for the first program is given as:\n\nFirst line: n m\n\nThen n lines each with a string. Or perhaps all on the same line?\n\nThe Java code uses sc.next() for each string, so each string is the next token in the input. So the input could be given as:\n\n3 5\n\nABGCD\n\nXYZS\n\nGSS\n\nIn this case, after reading n and m, the next three lines are the strings.\n\nAlternatively, the input could be all on one line after n and m, separated by spaces.\n\nThe Fortran code reads each string via read *, which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nAnother test case where returnDex is -1:\n\nSuppose one of the strings has G after S, like \"SG\".\n\nThen returnDex is set to -1, so the output is -1. The second program's processing leaves it as \"-1\".\n\nAnother case where differences are not unique.\n\nE.g., two strings with differences 2 and 2 \u2192 unique count is 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the final step is to replace commas in the result's string with spaces. Since the result is an integer, its string has no commas, so the output is the same as the first program's output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the final Fortran code with the bubble sort subroutine inside a contain block.\n\nWait, in the code outline above, the bubble_sort is a contained subroutine.\n\nYes, the 'contains' keyword is used to include the subroutine within the program.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n- The strings array is allocated as size n, which is read first.\n\n- The diffs array is allocated as size n.\n\n- The bubble sort is applied to the diffs array.\n\n- The count_unique is initialized to 1, assuming that n is at least 1. But what if n is 0? But according to the problem's first Java code, n is read from input, but the code may assume n is positive.\n\nAssuming that n is at least 1, so the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: when returnDex is not -1, but the diffs array is empty (n=0). But again, the problem's input likely ensures n is valid.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
