    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. The first Java program reads input, processes it, and outputs a result. The second takes that output as input and processes further, then outputs the final result. The challenge is to combine them into one Fortran program without I/O in the middle steps.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each Java program does.\n\nLooking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC107_D):\n\nIt reads N and an array of N integers. Then it uses a Task class's solve method. The solve method does some complex processing involving sorting the array, calculating a total, and using a binary search with a Fenwick Tree (BIT) to find a median-like value. The output is the sorted[l] value.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC129_E):\n\nIt reads a string, then uses a DP approach to compute some count modulo 1e9+7. The DP has two states, and the final result is the sum of the two states at the end.\n\nThe key is that the output of the first program is the input to the second. So in Fortran, I need to first compute the first program's result, then pass that result as the input to the second's processing.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is an integer (the result of solve), and the second program expects a string input (since it reads a line with nextLine()). Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the first program's output is an integer, but the second program expects a string (the input is a line of characters). So how does the first Java program's output become the input to the second?\n\nWait, the original setup is that the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first outputs an integer, and the second expects a string (the nextLine() reads a line). So the first program's output must be a string (the integer printed as a line), and the second program reads that line as its input. So in the combined Fortran program, the first part's result (the integer) must be converted into a string, then passed to the second part's processing as the input string.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first program (N and array), compute the first result (integer).\n2. Convert that integer to a string (the input for the second program).\n3. Process that string through the second program's logic.\n4. Output the final result of the second program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first handle the first problem's logic, then the second's, with the intermediate data passed in memory.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first Java program's Task.solve method. Let's see:\n\nThe solve method sorts the array, computes total = N*(N+1)/2. Then uses binary search to find the median-like value. The binary search uses a Fenwick Tree (BIT) to track some counts.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree part is a bit complex. Let's see:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree (BIT) is used to track the number of elements up to a certain point. The code initializes the BIT array, then for each element in the array, it updates the BIT and queries it to count something.\n\nWait, the code in the solve method:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is implemented with an array 'bit' of size 2n+2. The initial loop for x from n+1 to bit.length (so starting at n+1 up to 2n+1?), but the code is for (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nWait, that's initializing the BIT? Or maybe it's part of the process. Hmm, perhaps the initial setup is to have some initial value. Wait, maybe the code is setting the initial state of the BIT. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code in the solve method:\n\nInside the while loop (binary search), for each mid, it does:\n\nInitialize 'bit' array. Then, for x starting at n+1, and adding x & -x steps, it increments bit[x]. So that's setting some initial value in the BIT. Maybe this is part of the Fenwick Tree's initial setup?\n\nWait, perhaps the Fenwick Tree is being initialized with some initial counts. Alternatively, maybe the code is part of the process for the current target.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is part of the Fenwick Tree's initial state before processing the array. Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe code for the Fenwick Tree part:\n\nlong[] bit = new long[2 * n + 2]; // size is 2n+2, indices 0 to 2n+1?\n\nThen, for (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nWait, the loop starts at x = n+1, and increments x by x & -x (the bitwise AND with its two's complement, which gives the least significant bit set). So this is a loop that steps through the positions in the Fenwick Tree's structure. The code is setting those positions to 1? Because each iteration adds 1 to bit[x]. Wait, but the initial value is 0, so after the loop, those positions are 1?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is part of the initialization for the Fenwick Tree. Maybe the code is setting some initial value. Alternatively, perhaps this is part of the process for the current target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is part of the initial setup for the Fenwick Tree before processing the array elements. Let me see the rest of the code.\n\nThen, the code loops over each element in the array, computes 'cur' which is the cumulative count of elements <= target minus those > target. Then, for each step, it updates the Fenwick Tree and queries it.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is used to track the number of elements up to a certain point. The 'cur' variable is the current balance, and the code is using the Fenwick Tree to count how many previous 'cur' values are less than or equal to the current 'cur'?\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nThis is an update operation on the Fenwick Tree, adding 1 at position (cur + n + 1). Then, the query is done with:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n; x > 0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x];\n\nWait, the Fenwick Tree is 1-based? The standard Fenwick Tree implementation usually starts at 1. The indices here are from 1 to 2n+1 (since the array is 2n+2 elements, indices 0 to 2n+1). The 'cur' can range from -n to +n, so adding n+1 shifts it to 1 to 2n+1. So the Fenwick Tree is tracking the count of previous 'cur' values, and the query is summing up to (cur + n), which would be the current position minus 1?\n\nHmm, perhaps the Fenwick Tree is being used to track the number of elements up to a certain point, and the code is calculating the number of pairs where the cumulative difference is non-decreasing?\n\nThis part is a bit tricky. To translate this into Fortran, I need to replicate the same logic. The key is to implement the Fenwick Tree operations correctly.\n\nNow, moving to the second Java program. The second program reads a string, then uses a DP table with two states. The transitions depend on the current character. The DP[i][0] and DP[i][1] represent some counts, and the modulo is applied at each step.\n\nThe DP transitions are a bit involved. Let me parse them:\n\nThe initial state is dp[0][0] = 1.\n\nThen, for each character in the string (from 0 to n-1):\n\nIf the current character is '0':\n\n- dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n- dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nThen, if the character is '0', add some terms:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M, then mod again.\n\nWait, the code has two separate blocks for '0' and else. Wait, the code structure is:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n}\n\nThen, after that, there's another block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n} else {\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n}\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. The code has two separate if-else blocks. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nFirst block:\n\nif (s[i] is '0'):\n\n    set dp[i+1][0] to dp[i][0]\n\n    set dp[i+1][1] to dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n    set dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M\n\nThen, the second block:\n\nif (s[i] is '0'):\n\n    add (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][1], then mod again.\n\nelse:\n\n    add (dp[i][0] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][0]\n\n    add (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M to dp[i+1][1]\n\n    then mod both.\n\nHmm, this seems like the code is handling two different cases for each character, and the transitions are a bit complex. The DP is tracking two states, perhaps representing something like whether the current substring is valid in two different ways.\n\nThe final result is (dp[n][0] + dp[n][1]) mod M.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to replicate this DP table.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program will first read the input for the first problem (N and array), compute the first result (the median-like value), then convert that integer to a string (since the second program expects a string input), then process that string through the second problem's DP, and output the final result.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how do I convert an integer to a string? Using write and read with an internal file or using some intrinsic function. For example, using write with an internal file:\n\ninteger :: result1\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\nwrite(input_str, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen, the input_str can be used as the input string for the second part.\n\nNow, the first part's code:\n\nFirst, the first Java program's solve method is the core of the first part. Let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read N and the array.\n\n2. Sort the array.\n\n3. Compute total = N*(N+1)/2.\n\n4. Binary search between l=0 and r=N-1 to find the median value.\n\n   For each mid, compute target = sorted[mid].\n\n   Then, compute the count using the Fenwick Tree approach.\n\n   The Fenwick Tree part is the most complex.\n\nImplementing the Fenwick Tree in Fortran:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree (BIT) is an array. The update and query functions can be implemented as subroutines.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions and subroutines can be used. Let's think of the Fenwick Tree as an array, and have functions to update and query.\n\nAlternatively, since the code is part of a single program, perhaps we can implement the BIT operations inline.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree in the Java code is used as follows:\n\nInitialize the BIT array (size 2*N + 2). The initial loop for x from n+1 to the end, adding 1 to those positions. Wait, perhaps that's part of the initial setup. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java code, inside the binary search loop (for each mid):\n\nlong[] bit = new long[2 * n + 2]; // size is 2n+2, indices 0 to 2n+1?\n\nThen, for (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nWait, the loop starts at x = n+1, and increments by x & -x (the LSB). The loop runs while x < bit.length (which is 2n+2, so up to 2n+1). So for each x starting at n+1, and moving in steps of the LSB, set bit[x] +=1. So this is setting certain positions in the BIT array to 1. But why?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is part of the initial setup for the Fenwick Tree. Maybe the code is initializing the BIT with some initial values. Alternatively, perhaps this is part of the process for the current target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a mistake in the code? Or perhaps it's part of the initial state before processing the array elements.\n\nWait, the code then proceeds to loop over each element in the array, updating the Fenwick Tree and querying it.\n\nThe 'cur' variable is the cumulative count of elements <= target minus those > target. So for each element in the array, if it's <= target, add 1 to cur, else subtract 1. So cur starts at 0 and changes as we go through the array.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is used to track the number of previous 'cur' values that are less than or equal to the current 'cur'.\n\nWait, the code does:\n\nfor each element in arr:\n\n   cur += (arr[i] <= target ? 1 : -1)\n\n   then, update the Fenwick Tree at position (cur + n + 1)\n\n   then, query the Fenwick Tree up to (cur + n) to get the count.\n\nWait, the Fenwick Tree is 1-based? Let me see:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree's indices are from 1 to 2n+1 (since the array is 2n+2 elements, indices 0 to 2n+1). The 'cur' can range from -n to +n. Adding n+1 shifts it to 1 to 2n+1. So the position for the current 'cur' is (cur + n + 1). The query is for all elements up to (cur + n), which is the current position minus 1. So the query is counting the number of previous 'cur' values that are less than or equal to the current 'cur'.\n\nWait, the update is adding 1 at (cur + n +1), and the query is summing up to (cur +n). So the query gives the number of previous entries where the stored value (the previous 'cur' values) are less than or equal to the current 'cur'.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fenwick Tree is storing the count of previous 'cur' values, and the query is the number of previous entries where the stored value is <= current 'cur'.\n\nThe total count is the sum over all i of the number of j < i where cur_j <= cur_i. The code is trying to find the target where this count is at least half of the total possible pairs (total = N*(N+1)/2). The binary search finds the smallest target where this count is sufficient.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but the key is to translate the Fenwick Tree operations into Fortran.\n\nImplementing the Fenwick Tree in Fortran:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree can be represented as an array. The update and query functions can be written as subroutines.\n\nAlternatively, since the code is part of a loop, perhaps we can inline the operations.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree's update function (add 1 at position x):\n\nsubroutine update(bit, x)\n   integer, intent(inout) :: bit(:)\n   integer, intent(in) :: x\n   do while (x < size(bit))\n      bit(x) = bit(x) + 1\n      x = x + iand(x, -x)\n   end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the update is done by adding 1 to the bit array at certain positions. Wait, the code in Java for the update is:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nWhich is equivalent to the Fenwick Tree's update operation. The Fenwick Tree's update function adds a delta (here delta is 1) to the position x, and propagates upwards.\n\nSimilarly, the query function in Java is:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n; x > 0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x];\n\nWhich is the standard Fenwick Tree query to get the prefix sum up to x.\n\nSo in Fortran, the update and query can be implemented with loops.\n\nNow, putting this into the first part's code.\n\nThe binary search loop:\n\nInitialize l = 0, r = n-1.\n\nWhile l < r:\n\n   mid = l + (r - l)/2\n\n   target = sorted[mid]\n\n   compute the count using Fenwick Tree.\n\n   if count >= total/2 +1, set r = mid\n\n   else set l = mid +1\n\nAt the end, return sorted[l]\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute total = N*(N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize l and r.\n\nLoop while l < r:\n\n   mid = (l + r)/2 (integer division?)\n\n   target = sorted(mid)\n\n   Initialize the Fenwick Tree array (size 2*N +2).\n\n   The initial loop in Java: for x from n+1 to bit.length (2n+2) step x & -x, set bit[x] +=1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the initial loop would be:\n\ndo x = n+1, 2*n+1, ... ?\n\nWait, the initial loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int x = n + 1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nThe bit.length is 2n+2, so x runs up to 2n+1.\n\nThe step is x += x & -x, which is the same as the Fenwick Tree's step for the update.\n\nSo in Fortran, the initial loop would be:\n\ninteger :: bit(2*N +2) = 0\n\nx = n +1\n\ndo while (x <= 2*N +1)\n\n   bit(x) = bit(x) +1\n\n   x = x + iand(x, -x)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this is a loop that starts at x = n+1, and steps by x & -x each time. But this may not cover all required positions. Alternatively, perhaps the initial loop is setting the initial state of the Fenwick Tree. Maybe this is part of the initial setup before processing the array elements.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial loop is part of the Fenwick Tree's initialization. But I'm not sure why it's needed. Maybe it's part of the initial state for the Fenwick Tree before processing the array elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I have to follow it as per the given Java code.\n\nOnce the Fenwick Tree is initialized, the code processes each element in the array, updating the Fenwick Tree and querying it.\n\nThe 'cur' variable starts at 0, then for each element in the array:\n\nif arr[i] <= target: cur +=1 else: cur -=1\n\nThen, the update is done at (cur + n +1), and the query is up to (cur +n).\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\nfor (int x = cur + n +1; x < bit.length; x += x & -x) bit[x]++;\n\nThis is the update step, adding 1 to the Fenwick Tree at position (cur +n+1).\n\nThen, the query is:\n\nfor (int x = cur +n; x >0; x -= x & -x) cnt += bit[x]\n\nSo the query is the sum up to (cur +n).\n\nThus, the Fenwick Tree is being used to track the number of previous 'cur' values that are less than or equal to the current 'cur'.\n\nThe total count is accumulated in 'cnt'.\n\nOnce all elements are processed, if cnt >= total/2 +1, then we adjust the binary search.\n\nThis is quite involved, but the key is to translate this into Fortran with arrays and loops.\n\nNow, moving to the second part of the problem.\n\nThe second part's input is the result of the first part, which is an integer. So the input string for the second part is the string representation of that integer.\n\nIn Fortran, after computing the first result (result1), we can write it to a string variable, then process that string through the DP.\n\nThe DP is a 2D array of size (n+1) x 2, where n is the length of the input string. Since the input is the first result's string, the length is the number of digits in result1.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is an integer, which when converted to a string, could be of variable length. So the input string for the second part is the string form of the first result.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing result1, we need to convert it to a string. Let's say the string is input_str.\n\nThen, the length n is len_trim(input_str).\n\nThen, the DP array is (n+1) x 2.\n\nInitialize dp(0,1) = 0, dp(0,0) =1.\n\nThen loop over each character in input_str, and compute the transitions as per the Java code.\n\nThe modulo is 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the DP transitions are a bit tricky. Let me re-express them step by step.\n\nFor each character c in the input string (from 1 to n):\n\n   current_char = input_str(i:i)\n\n   if current_char == '0':\n\n       dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n       dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n   else:\n\n       dp(i,1) = (dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1)) mod M\n\n   Then, regardless of the character:\n\n   if current_char == '0':\n\n       dp(i,1) = (dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1)) mod M\n\n   else:\n\n       dp(i,0) = (dp(i,0) + 2*dp(i-1,0)) mod M\n\n       dp(i,1) = (dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1)) mod M\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after the first if-else block, there's another if-else block that adds terms. So the code is structured as:\n\nFirst, handle the initial assignment based on the current character.\n\nThen, add the additional terms based on the character.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe first block sets dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] to certain values, then the second block adds more terms.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThe first block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M\n\n}\n\nThen, the second block:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M\n\n    dp[i+1][0] %= M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] %= M\n\n}\n\nSo the first block sets the initial values, then the second block adds to them.\n\nThus, in Fortran, for each step i (from 1 to n):\n\ncurrent_char = input_str(i:i)\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n   dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n   dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\nelse:\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nthen:\n\nif current_char == '0' then:\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nelse:\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2*dp(i-1,0), M)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nWait, but in the else case of the second block, the code adds to dp[i+1][0] and [1], but in the first block, for the else case (current_char not '0'), the dp[i+1][0] wasn't set. Wait, in the first block's else clause, the code only sets dp[i+1][1], leaving dp[i+1][0] as whatever it was before? Or is it initialized to 0?\n\nWait, in Java, the DP array is initialized to 0. So in the first block's else clause, the code sets dp[i+1][1], but dp[i+1][0] remains 0 unless set elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the first block's else clause (current_char is not '0'):\n\nThe code sets dp[i+1][1] to (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) mod M, and leaves dp[i+1][0] as 0 (since it wasn't assigned). Then, in the second block's else clause (current_char is not '0'), the code adds to dp[i+1][0] and [1].\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in the first block's else clause, the code only sets dp[i+1][1], but the second block's else clause adds to dp[i+1][0], which was not set. So the initial value of dp[i+1][0] would be 0 (since arrays are initialized to 0 in Java). So the code is correct.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the DP array must be initialized to 0, and the steps must be followed as per the code.\n\nNow, putting all this together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read N and the array.\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the first result via the binary search and Fenwick Tree.\n\n- Convert the result to a string.\n\n- Process the string through the DP.\n\n- Output the final result.\n\nNow, let's start writing the code.\n\nFirst, the first part:\n\nRead N and the array.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger :: N\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nread*, N\n\nallocate(arr(N))\n\nread*, arr\n\nThen, sort the array. In Fortran, we can use the Mergesort or another method. Since the array can be up to 1e5 elements (assuming from the problem's context), but in any case, we can use the built-in sort function.\n\ncall merge_sort(arr)\n\nBut to implement it, perhaps we can use the intrinsic function ifort's sort, but for portability, better to write a subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in sort:\n\ncall sort(arr)\n\nBut in standard Fortran, the sort is available via the intrinsic function.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, there is the 'sort' intrinsic function. So:\n\ncall sort(arr)\n\nBut to be precise, the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nThen, compute the total = N*(N+1)/2.\n\ninteger :: total = N*(N+1)/2\n\nInitialize l and r:\n\ninteger :: l = 1, r = N\n\nWait, in Java, the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the initial l is 1, r is N.\n\nWait, the Java code's sorted array is 0-based, so the first element is sorted[0], last is sorted[N-1]. In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices are 1 to N. So the initial l and r should be 1 and N.\n\nWait, the binary search loop in Java is:\n\nwhile (l < r) {\n\n   mid = l + (r - l)/2\n\n   target = sorted[mid]\n\n   ... compute cnt ...\n\n   if (cnt >= total/2 +1) r = mid;\n\n   else l = mid +1;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so the same logic applies.\n\nNow, the binary search loop:\n\ndo while (l < r)\n\n   mid = (l + r)/2\n\n   target = arr(mid)\n\n   ... compute cnt ...\n\n   if (cnt >= (total/2 +1)) then\n\n      r = mid\n\n   else\n\n      l = mid +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThe result is arr(l).\n\nNow, the Fenwick Tree part inside the loop.\n\nInside the loop over each mid:\n\nWe need to compute the count.\n\nFirst, create the Fenwick Tree array. The size is 2*N +2.\n\ninteger, allocatable :: bit(:)\n\nallocate(bit(2*N +2))\n\nInitialize the bit array to 0.\n\nbit = 0\n\nThen, perform the initial loop:\n\ninteger :: x\n\nx = N +1\n\ndo while (x <= 2*N +1)\n\n   bit(x) = bit(x) +1\n\n   x = x + iand(x, -x)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop is for x starting at N+1, and adding x & -x each time until x < bit.length (which is 2*N+2). So the loop continues as long as x < 2*N+2, i.e., x <= 2*N+1.\n\nThus, the Fortran loop is correct.\n\nThen, initialize cur to 0, and cnt to 0.\n\ninteger :: cur =0\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: cnt =0\n\nThen, loop over each element in the array (1 to N):\n\ndo i =1, N\n\n   if (arr(i) <= target) then\n\n      cur = cur +1\n\n   else\n\n      cur = cur -1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Update the Fenwick Tree at (cur + N +1)\n\n   x = cur + N +1\n\n   do while (x <= 2*N +1)\n\n      bit(x) = bit(x) +1\n\n      x = x + iand(x, -x)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Query the Fenwick Tree up to (cur + N)\n\n   x = cur + N\n\n   temp =0\n\n   do while (x >0)\n\n      temp = temp + bit(x)\n\n      x = x - iand(x, -x)\n\n   end do\n\n   cnt = cnt + temp\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the query is done after the update. Wait, the code in Java does:\n\nfor each element:\n\n   update the Fenwick Tree (add 1 at cur +n+1)\n\n   then query the Fenwick Tree up to cur +n.\n\nThus, the query is after the update. Wait, but in the code, the update is done first, then the query. However, the query is counting the number of previous entries (before this element) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nWait, no. Because the current element's 'cur' is computed before the update. The update is adding the current 'cur' to the Fenwick Tree. The query is counting the number of previous entries (before this element) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nWait, the order is:\n\ncur is computed based on the current element.\n\nThen, the update is adding the current 'cur' to the Fenwick Tree (so that future elements can query it).\n\nWait, but the query is done before the update? Or after?\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nThe code is:\n\ncur is computed.\n\nThen, the update is done (adding the current 'cur' to the Fenwick Tree).\n\nThen, the query is done to get the count of previous entries (before this element) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nWait, no. Because the update is adding the current 'cur' to the Fenwick Tree. So the query after the update would include the current 'cur', which is not desired. Because the current 'cur' is the current element's contribution, and the query is supposed to count the number of previous elements (before this one) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nAh, that's a problem. The code in Java is incorrect? Or perhaps I misunderstood the logic.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe update is done first, then the query. But the query is supposed to count the number of previous entries (before this element) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nWait, the current 'cur' is the cumulative up to and including the current element. So the Fenwick Tree is storing the previous 'cur's. Wait, perhaps the order is wrong.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each element in the array:\n\n   compute cur (based on previous elements plus current element)\n\n   update the Fenwick Tree with the current 'cur'\n\n   then query the Fenwick Tree to get the number of previous entries (before this element) that are <= current 'cur'\n\nWait, but the Fenwick Tree has just been updated with the current 'cur', so the query would include it. That's incorrect.\n\nAh, this is a mistake. The update should be done after the query. Because the current 'cur' is the current value, and the query is to count how many previous 'cur's (before this element) are <= current 'cur'.\n\nThus, the code in Java has a bug here. But since the problem requires translating the given code, I have to follow it as is.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's purpose. Let me think again.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is being used to track the previous 'cur' values. The current 'cur' is the cumulative up to the current element. The query is supposed to count how many previous 'cur's (from before this element) are <= current 'cur'.\n\nThus, the update should be done after the query. Because the current 'cur' is the current value, and the query is about previous entries.\n\nBut in the code, the update is done before the query. So the query includes the current 'cur', which is not part of the previous entries. Thus, the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. But since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if there's a possible error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe Fenwick Tree is initialized with some initial values. Then, for each element:\n\n   compute cur (based on previous elements plus current element)\n\n   update the Fenwick Tree with the current 'cur'\n\n   then query the Fenwick Tree to get the count of entries up to current 'cur'\n\nWait, but the current 'cur' is just added, so the query includes it. So the count includes the current 'cur' itself, which is not desired.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect. But since the user provided this code, I have to proceed with the given code's logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the initial setup of the Fenwick Tree is such that the first element's 'cur' is not counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the logic is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the Fenwick Tree is being used to track the number of previous entries (before the current element) that are <= current 'cur'.\n\nWait, the code's update is adding the current 'cur' to the Fenwick Tree, then the query is counting the number of elements up to current 'cur' in the Fenwick Tree. Since the current 'cur' was just added, the count includes it. So the count is the number of elements (including current) that are <= current 'cur', but the current element's contribution is being counted here. That would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. But since I have to translate the code as given, I'll proceed with the code's structure.\n\nThus, in the Fenwick Tree processing:\n\nThe code's logic is as written, so in Fortran, the code will follow the same steps, even if it's possibly incorrect.\n\nThus, proceeding with the code as per the Java's structure.\n\nNow, after the loop over all elements, the cnt is the total count.\n\nThen, if cnt >= (total/2 +1), set r = mid, else l = mid +1.\n\nOnce the binary search completes, the result is arr(l).\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nOnce the first result is obtained (result1), convert it to a string.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\n\nwrite(input_str, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen, process this string through the DP.\n\nThe length of the string is n = len_trim(input_str).\n\ninteger :: n = len_trim(input_str)\n\nallocate(dp(0:n, 0:1))\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) =1\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   current_char = input_str(i:i)\n\n   if (current_char == '0') then\n\n      dp(i,0) = dp(i-1,0)\n\n      dp(i,1) = dp(i-1,1)\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\n   if (current_char == '0') then\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M)\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0) + 2*dp(i-1,0), M)\n\n      dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1) + 2*dp(i-1,1), M)\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Apply modulo M to both\n\n   dp(i,0) = mod(dp(i,0), M)\n\n   dp(i,1) = mod(dp(i,1), M)\n\nend do\n\nThe modulo M is 1e9+7.\n\ninteger, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n\nFinally, the result is mod(dp(n,0) + dp(n,1), M).\n\nprint*, mod(dp(n,0) + dp(n,1), M)\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read N and array.\n\n- Sort array.\n\n- Binary search with Fenwick Tree to get result1.\n\n- Convert to string.\n\n- Process string with DP.\n\n- Output final result.\n\nNow, handling the Fenwick Tree in the binary search loop.\n\nThe Fenwick Tree code inside the loop must be inside the binary search loop, so for each mid, we have to re-initialize the Fenwick Tree each time.\n\nThus, the code for the first part's solve function is nested inside the binary search loop.\n\nNow, the full Fortran code:\n\nBut I need to write this in a single program.\n\nNow, let's start writing the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program starts with reading N and the array.\n\nThen, sort the array.\n\nThen, the binary search loop.\n\nInside each iteration of the binary search, the Fenwick Tree is initialized and processed.\n\nThen, after finding the result1, convert to string and process the DP.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: N, l, r, mid, target, i, j, n_str, M = 1000000007\n\n   integer(kind=8) :: total, cnt, result1\n\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:), bit(:), dp(:,:)\n\n   character(len=20) :: input_str\n\n   !

The bit.length is 2*N+2, so x runs up to 2*N+1.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is:\n\nx starts at N+1, and increments by x & -x until x exceeds 2*N+1.\n\nThe code in the Fenwick Tree's initial loop is correct.\n\nSecond, in the Fenwick Tree's update and query loops:\n\nThe update loop for the current 'cur' is correct.\n\nThe query loop is also correct.\n\nThird, in the binary search loop, after each iteration, the bit array is deallocated.\n\nFourth, in the DP part:\n\nThe modulo operations must be done with mod function, but in Fortran, mod(a,b) returns a result with the same sign as b. Since all values are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ndp(i,1) = mod(dp(i-1,0) + dp(i-1,1), M)\n\nThis is correct.\n\nAlso, when adding 2*dp(i-1,1), the mod is applied again.\n\nThe final print statement is mod(dp(n_str,0) + dp(n_str,1), M).\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The Fenwick Tree's initial loop may have an off-by-one error. Let me check:\n\nIn Java, the initial loop starts at x = n+1 (where n is the length of the array, which is N in Fortran). The loop runs while x < bit.length (which is 2*N+2). So x can be up to 2*N+1.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is:\n\nx starts at N+1, and continues while x <= 2*N+1. So same as Java.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the binary search's initial l and r.\n\nIn Java, the array is 0-based, so l starts at 0 and r at N-1.\n\nIn Fortran, the array is 1-based, so l starts at 1 and r at N. The binary search loop is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the calculation of mid:\n\nIn Java, mid = l + (r-l)/2. In Fortran, using integer division, (l + r)/2 is the same as Java's calculation.\n\nYes, because (l + r) is even or odd, but integer division in Fortran truncates, so (l + r)/2 is the same as Java's mid.\n\nThus, the binary search is correct.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 5, then the second program's input is \"5\".\n\nThe second program's DP would process the string \"5\".\n\nThe first character is '5', which is not '0'.\n\nThe DP steps:\n\nInitial dp(0,0)=1, dp(0,1)=0.\n\ni=1:\n\nc is '5' (not '0').\n\nFirst block:\n\ndp(1,1) = (dp(0,0) + dp(0,1)) mod M = 1 mod M.\n\nThen, since c is not '0', the second block adds:\n\ndp(1,0) += 2*dp(0,0) \u2192 dp(1,0) = 0 + 2*1 = 2 mod M.\n\ndp(1,1) += 2*dp(0,1) \u2192 1 + 0 =1 mod M.\n\nThus, dp(1,0)=2, dp(1,1)=1.\n\nTotal is 3 mod M \u2192 3.\n\nWhich would be the output.\n\nThus, the code should handle this case.\n\nAnother test case would be needed, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as above."
