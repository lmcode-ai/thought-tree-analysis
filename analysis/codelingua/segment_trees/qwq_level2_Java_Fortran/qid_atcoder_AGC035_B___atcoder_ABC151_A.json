But adj_count(a) can be up to numEdge (since each edge adds two entries, but per node, the maximum is numEdge if all edges are connected to that node). So the second dimension is okay. Another point: in the DFS, the loop over children is:\n\ndo i =0, adj_count(crt)-1\n\n   child = adj_list(crt,i) But adj_list is a 2D array where adj_list(crt, i) is the ith child of node crt.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC035_B). It reads input for a graph with nodes and edges, builds an adjacency list, and then performs a DFS to process the edges. The output is a series of pairs of nodes, which is printed out. The second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string and outputs the first character incremented by 1. Wait, but the second program's code seems to only take the first character of the input string and print the next character. For example, if the input is \"a\", it would print \"b\". But how does this fit into the sequence?\n\nWait, the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second. The first program outputs pairs of integers, each on a new line. The second program expects a string input, which would be the output of the first. But the second program's code is taking the first character of the input string and adding 1 to it. Hmm, that seems odd. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code: it reads a line from input, then takes the first character of that string and prints the next character. Wait, the code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo if the input is, say, \"123\", then the first character is '1', which is ASCII 49. Adding 1 gives 50, which is '2', so it would print '2'. But the first program's output is lines of two numbers, like \"1 2\\n3 4\\n...\" etc. So when the second program runs, it would read the entire first program's output as a single string? Or line by line?\n\nWait, the second Java program uses BufferedReader.readLine(), which reads the entire line. But the first program's output is multiple lines. So the second program would read the first line of the first program's output as its input. Wait, but the second program's code only reads one line. So the first program's output is multiple lines, but the second program only reads the first line? That can't be right. Wait, no, the second program's code is written to read a single line (since readLine() reads until the end of line). Wait, the second program's code is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo it reads the first line of input, takes the first character of that line, increments it, and prints that character. So the entire output of the first program is the input to the second, but the second only uses the first character of the first line of that input. That's a bit strange, but that's what the code does.\n\nTherefore, the overall sequence is:\n\n1. The first Java program reads its input (nodes and edges), processes the graph, and outputs a series of pairs of integers, each on a new line.\n\n2. The second Java program takes the first line of that output, takes the first character (the first digit of the first pair's first number?), increments it by 1, and outputs that character.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is lines like \"1 2\", so the first line's first character is '1', so the second program would output '2'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second program's output is the final output of the entire sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it as per the first program, then process the result as per the second program, and output the final result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first Java program (numNode and numEdge, then the edges).\n\n- Process the graph as in the first Java program, generating the list of pairs (the output of the first Java program).\n\n- Then, take the first line of that generated output (the first pair of numbers), take the first character of that line (the first digit of the first number), add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is the entire output of the first program. The second program reads the first line (using readLine()), so the first line of the first program's output is the first line of the input to the second program. The second program then takes the first character of that line (the first character of the first line) and increments it.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (nodes and edges, etc.)\n\n2. Simulate the first Java program's processing, which builds the adjacency list and performs the DFS to generate the list of pairs (the output lines).\n\n3. Then, take the first line of that generated list (the first pair of numbers), take the first character of that line (the first digit of the first number in the first pair), add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the output is built via a StringBuilder, which appends each pair as strings. The order of the pairs depends on the DFS traversal. The first line of the output is the first pair generated during the DFS processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (nodes, edges, edges list).\n\n- Perform the same DFS as the first Java program, building the list of pairs (the output lines).\n\n- Then, process the first line of that list (the first pair) as per the second Java program's logic.\n\n- Output the result of that processing (the first character of the first line's first number plus 1).\n\nWait, but the first line's first number is, for example, \"1 2\", so the first character is '1', so the output would be '2'.\n\nBut how do I handle the intermediate steps in Fortran without I/O?\n\nThe problem states that the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. The first block (equivalent to the first Java program) must read input, process data, and pass it to the next steps (the second Java program's processing) without I/O in between. The last block (second Java program) must produce the output. So the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read input (from stdin) for the first Java program.\n\n- Process the first Java's logic, storing the output (the list of pairs) in memory (arrays or variables).\n\n- Then process that stored data as per the second Java program's logic (taking the first line's first character, etc.), and output the final result.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n1. Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n2. Read the edges (numEdge pairs of integers, 1-based, converted to 0-based as in Java? Wait, in the first Java program, the edges are read as a and b, then subtracted by 1 to make them 0-based indices. So in Fortran, we need to read the a and b, subtract 1, and store in adjacency lists.\n\n3. Build the adjacency list (arrays of lists? Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays, perhaps using linked lists or fixed-size arrays. Alternatively, since the number of edges is known, perhaps we can pre-allocate arrays. Hmm, this might be tricky. Alternatively, since the first Java program uses an ArrayList for each node's connections, in Fortran, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of linked lists or use a list structure. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges is known (numEdge), but each node's edges can be stored in a list. Alternatively, perhaps using a dynamic array approach with a maximum size.\n\nAlternatively, since in the first Java program, the edges are bidirectional, so for each edge a-b, both a's list and b's list get the other node. So in Fortran, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of linked lists. But Fortran doesn't have built-in linked lists, so maybe using a list of lists with fixed size arrays. Alternatively, since the number of edges is known, perhaps we can pre-allocate an array for each node's edges. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency list can be stored as a list of nodes for each node. Since in Fortran, arrays are fixed size, but we can use a dynamic array approach with pointers. Alternatively, perhaps using a 2D array where each row is a node's edges, but the size may vary. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the first step is to represent the adjacency list as an array of linked lists. Let me think of how to do that in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a list of edges for each node. Let me think of the first Java program's code again. The adjacency list is built as an array of ArrayLists. Each time an edge is read, both nodes add each other to their lists. So in Fortran, perhaps for each node, we can have an array of integers, and a counter for the number of edges. Since the maximum number of edges per node can be up to numEdge (if all edges are connected to one node), but that's unlikely. Alternatively, we can pre-allocate an array for each node's edges with a size equal to the maximum possible (numEdge), but that might be memory-intensive. Alternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, the total number of edges stored is 2*numEdge. So for each node, the number of edges can be stored in a separate array, and the edges themselves can be stored in a 2D array where each row is a node's edges, and the columns are up to the maximum needed. But this requires knowing the maximum edges per node in advance, which we don't. Hmm, perhaps the easiest way is to use a dynamic array approach with a list structure. Alternatively, perhaps using a linked list approach with pointers. But Fortran isn't great for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first Java program's logic can be reworked in Fortran with adjacency lists stored as arrays. Let me think of the steps again.\n\nThe first program's main steps:\n\n- Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n- Read numEdge edges, each a and b (1-based), convert to 0-based, and add to each other's adjacency lists.\n\n- If numEdge is odd, output -1 and exit.\n\n- Else, perform a DFS starting at node 0, tracking visited and odd flags, and building the output string.\n\nWait, the DFS is crucial here. The DFS function is doing some processing to track whether the node has an odd number of edges or something? The 'odd' array is a boolean array, and during the DFS, they toggle the 'odd' flags and append lines to the print string.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to track the parity of the number of times edges are traversed? Not sure, but the main point is that the DFS builds the output string by appending certain pairs of nodes.\n\nThe output is the sequence of pairs generated during the DFS processing. The first program's output is the content of the print string, which is built by appending lines during the DFS.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I need to:\n\n- Read the input, build the adjacency list.\n\n- Check if numEdge is even. If not, output -1 (but then the second program would not run, but since it's a single program, we have to handle that case).\n\nWait, the problem says that the entire sequence must be translated into a single Fortran program. So if the first program outputs -1, then the second program would not run (since the first's output is -1, but the second program would read that as input, but the second program's code would read the first line, which is \"-1\", then take the first character '-' (ASCII 45), add 1 to get 46, which is '.', so output '.'? But according to the first Java program, when the edge count is odd, it outputs -1 and returns, so the second program would not run. Wait, but in the sequence, the second program would read the first program's output. So in the case of an odd edge count, the first program outputs \"-1\", so the second program would read that line, take the first character '-', add 1 to get '.', and output that. But according to the problem's requirement, the Fortran program must behave identically. So in the case of an odd edge count, the Fortran program must output '.' (since the second program would process the \"-1\" output). Wait, but the first Java program's code outputs \"-1\" and returns, so the second program would not run. Wait, no, the second program is part of the sequence, so even if the first program outputs -1, the second program would read that as input and process it. So the overall output would be '.' in that case. But the first Java program's code would print -1 and exit, so the second program would not run. Wait, no, the first program's code returns after printing -1, so the second program would not execute. Wait, the problem says the programs are executed in sequence, so the first program's output is the input to the second. So if the first program outputs \"-1\" and exits, then the second program would read that input and process it. Therefore, the overall output would be '.' in that case. But according to the first Java program's code, when the edge count is odd, it outputs -1 and returns, so the second program would not run. Wait, no, the second program is a separate program in the sequence. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So even if the first program outputs -1, the second program will run and process that input. Therefore, the Fortran program must handle that case.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, when the edge count is odd, the first part's output is \"-1\", so the second part processes that, leading to the first character of the first line (which is '-') being incremented to '.'.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program.\n\n- Process the first program's logic, building the output string (the list of pairs or \"-1\").\n\n- Then, process that output string as per the second program's logic (taking first line's first character, etc.), and output the result.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement all of this in Fortran without intermediate I/O.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first part (the first Java program's logic).\n\nThe first program's main steps:\n\n1. Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n2. Read numEdge edges, each a and b (1-based), convert to 0-based, and add to adjacency lists.\n\n3. If numEdge is odd, output \"-1\" and exit.\n\n4. Else, perform DFS starting at node 0, building the output string.\n\n5. Output the output string.\n\nThe DFS function is recursive, but Fortran doesn't have built-in recursion for large depths. However, given that the problem is from a programming contest, the recursion depth is probably manageable. Alternatively, we can implement the DFS iteratively, but let's see.\n\nFirst, the adjacency list. Let's think of how to represent it in Fortran. Since each node's edges can be stored in an array. Let's use an array of linked lists. Alternatively, since Fortran arrays are static, perhaps we can pre-allocate a large enough array for each node's edges. Let's assume that the maximum number of edges per node is not too big. Let's say we can have an array of size numNode * 2 (since each edge is stored twice). But perhaps a better way is to use a dynamic array approach with a list of lists. Alternatively, use a 2D array where each row is a node's edges, and the columns are up to the maximum needed. But this requires knowing the maximum edges per node in advance, which we don't. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, for each edge a-b, we can store both a in b's list and b in a's list. So for each node, the edges are stored in a list. Let's use an array of linked lists. But in Fortran, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps use a list of edges for each node, stored in a 2D array with a size equal to the maximum possible edges per node. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a dynamic array approach. Let's have an array for each node's edges. Since in Fortran, arrays are fixed, but we can use a list of pointers. Alternatively, perhaps use a 2D array with a maximum size. Let's say the maximum possible edges per node is numEdge (since each edge connects two nodes, but in the worst case, one node could have all edges). So for each node, the edges can be stored in an array of size numEdge. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array of edges for each node. Let's define:\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: adj_list\n\nBut since each node can have a different number of edges, perhaps we need to track the count for each node. Let's have:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: adj_count\n\nThen, for each node i, adj_list(i, 1:adj_count(i)) contains the connected nodes.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed in size. So perhaps we can pre-allocate adj_list with a size of numNode x max_edges, where max_edges is the maximum possible edges per node. Since the total edges are numEdge, the maximum edges per node can be up to numEdge (if all edges are connected to one node). So, let's set max_edges = numEdge. Then, adj_list can be allocated as (numNode, max_edges). But this may be memory-intensive for large numEdge, but given that this is a programming contest problem, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to read all edges, store them in a list, then build the adjacency list.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read numNode and numEdge.\n\nThen, read the edges. For each edge a and b (1-based), convert to 0-based (a-1 and b-1). Then, for each node a and b, add the other to their adjacency lists.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nallocate(adj_count(numNode), source=0)\n\nallocate(adj_list(numNode, numEdge))  ! since each edge contributes two entries, but this may be overkill.\n\nThen, for each edge:\n\nread *, a, b\n\na = a - 1\n\nb = b - 1\n\nadj_list(a, adj_count(a)+1) = b\n\nadj_count(a) = adj_count(a) + 1\n\nadj_list(b, adj_count(b)+1) = a\n\nadj_count(b) = adj_count(b) + 1\n\nWait, but this requires that adj_list is large enough. Since each edge adds two entries, the total entries are 2*numEdge. So the maximum adj_count for any node can be up to 2*numEdge (if all edges are connected to one node). But that's impossible because each edge connects two nodes. The maximum for a single node would be numEdge (if all edges are connected to it). So the maximum adj_count per node is numEdge. So the adj_list can be allocated as (numNode, numEdge). But if numEdge is large, say 1e5, this could be a problem. But perhaps in the problem constraints, the numbers are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a dynamic array approach with linked lists. But that's complicated in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a list of edges for each node, stored as a 1D array with pointers. But this is getting too complex. Let's proceed with the 2D array approach, assuming that the problem's constraints are manageable.\n\nOnce the adjacency list is built, check if numEdge is odd. If yes, then the output is \"-1\", so the second program will process that.\n\nElse, perform the DFS.\n\nNow, the DFS function in Java is recursive. Let's see what it does.\n\nThe DFS function:\n\nstatic void dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    for each child in connect[crt]:\n\n        if child is parent or visited ==1: continue\n\n        else if visited[child] ==2: \n\n            append (crt+1, child+1) to print, toggle odd[crt]\n\n        else:\n\n            dfs(child, crt)\n\n            if odd[child]:\n\n                append (child+1, crt+1) to print, toggle odd[child]\n\n            else:\n\n                append (crt+1, child+1) to print, toggle odd[crt]\n\n    visited[crt] =2\n\n}\n\nThe visited array has values 1 (visited but not finished), 2 (finished). The odd array is a boolean array.\n\nThe print is a stringbuilder that appends lines.\n\nThe logic is a bit complex. The DFS is tracking some parity conditions and appending edges to the print string based on certain conditions.\n\nThe goal is to build the print string as per the first Java program's logic.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to implement this DFS, tracking the visited and odd arrays, and building the output string.\n\nThe output string is a list of lines, each being two numbers separated by space, followed by a newline.\n\nIn Fortran, we can build this as a character array or a string. Since Fortran strings are fixed length, perhaps we can use a character array with a large enough size, or build it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the output is the first line's first character processed by the second program, maybe we can track only the first line's first character? But no, because the second program's input is the entire output of the first program, so we need to generate the entire output string to process it.\n\nTherefore, we need to build the entire output string in memory.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use a character array to store the output. Let's say we have a character(len=1000000) :: output_str, and build it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the output is lines of two integers, each line is something like \"a b\\n\". The first line is the first such pair.\n\nThe DFS is recursive, so in Fortran, we can implement it with a recursive subroutine.\n\nBut first, let's outline the variables needed:\n\n- adj_list: the adjacency list as a 2D array.\n\n- adj_count: the count of edges per node.\n\n- visited: array of integers (1 or 2).\n\n- odd: array of logicals.\n\n- output_str: the accumulated string.\n\nNow, the DFS:\n\nWe need to track the current node (crt), parent node (parent), and the visited and odd arrays.\n\nThe DFS steps:\n\n1. Mark visited(crt) as 1.\n\n2. Iterate over all children in adj_list(crt, 1:adj_count(crt)).\n\n3. For each child:\n\n   a. If child is parent or visited(child) is 1: skip.\n\n   b. Else if visited(child) is 2:\n\n       append (crt+1, child+1) to output_str, toggle odd(crt).\n\n   c. Else:\n\n       call dfs(child, crt)\n\n       if odd(child):\n\n           append (child+1, crt+1) to output_str, toggle odd(child).\n\n       else:\n\n           append (crt+1, child+1) to output_str, toggle odd(crt).\n\n4. Mark visited(crt) as 2.\n\nWait, the 'toggle' is done via odd[crt] = !odd[crt], which in Fortran is .not. odd(crt).\n\nThe appending is done by appending the string to the output_str.\n\nNow, in Fortran, building the output_str can be done by concatenation, but for large outputs, this can be inefficient. However, given that this is a programming contest problem, perhaps the input size is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can pre-allocate a large enough character array and build it step by step.\n\nLet me think of the steps in code.\n\nFirst, after building the adjacency list, check if numEdge is odd. If yes, set output_str to \"-1\\n\" (or just \"-1\" followed by a newline?), then proceed.\n\nElse, initialize visited and odd arrays.\n\nInitialize visited to 0, odd to .false.\n\nThen call dfs(0, -1).\n\nWait, in Java, the initial call is dfs(0, -1). The parent is -1 (since it's the root).\n\nIn Fortran, the nodes are 0-based, so the first node is 0.\n\nThe DFS function in Fortran would be a recursive subroutine.\n\nNow, the output_str needs to be built by appending lines during the DFS.\n\nIn Fortran, since variables are passed by reference, we can have the output_str as a module variable or passed as an argument.\n\nAlternatively, use a module to hold the variables.\n\nAlternatively, since the DFS is part of the first program's processing, perhaps all variables are in the main program.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to have all variables in the main program, and the DFS is a recursive subroutine.\n\nLet me outline the Fortran code structure.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nread *, numNode, numEdge\n\nallocate adj_count(numNode), adj_list(numNode, numEdge)\n\nthen read edges and build adj_list and adj_count.\n\nThen check if mod(numEdge,2) /=0:\n\n   if yes, then output_str = \"-1\" (or \"-1\\n\" ?)\n\n   then proceed to the second part.\n\nElse:\n\n   initialize visited(0:numNode-1) = 0 (assuming 0-based)\n\n   odd array as logical array.\n\n   output_str = ''\n\n   call dfs(0, -1)\n\n   then, after DFS, the output_str contains the lines.\n\nThen, process the output_str as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program's logic is:\n\nRead the first line of the input (the first line of the first program's output).\n\nTake the first character of that line, add 1 to its ASCII value, and print that character.\n\nSo in Fortran, after building the output_str, we need to:\n\n- Split the output_str into lines. The first line is everything up to the first newline.\n\n- Take the first character of that first line.\n\n- Increment its ASCII value by 1.\n\n- Output that character.\n\nBut how to split the output_str into lines?\n\nAlternatively, the first line is the first occurrence of a newline. So in Fortran, we can search for the first newline character (ASCII 10 or 13?), then take the first character of the substring before that.\n\nAssuming that the output_str is built with newlines as '\\n' (ASCII 10).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find the first occurrence of '\\n' in output_str.\n\n2. The first line is the substring from 1 to pos-1 (if pos is the position of the first '\\n').\n\n3. The first character of that substring is the first character of the first line.\n\n4. Increment its ASCII value by 1, then output that character.\n\nAlternatively, if the first line is the first line of the output_str, which is the first pair of numbers followed by a newline.\n\nWait, in the first Java program's code, the print is a StringBuilder, and each append is done with \"\\n\" at the end. So each line is \"a b\\n\".\n\nTherefore, the first line is the first such pair, followed by a newline. So the first line's first character is the first digit of the first number.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the output_str is built with each line as \"a b\\n\".\n\nSo the first line is from position 1 to the first occurrence of '\\n'.\n\nThe first character is output_str(1:1).\n\nIncrement its ASCII value by 1, then print that character.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: numNode, numEdge, a, b, i, pos\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: adj_count, visited\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: adj_list\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: odd\n\ncharacter(len=1000000) :: output_str\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: first_char\n\n!

But adj_count(a) is the number of edges for node a, so the indices for adj_list(a, 0:adj_count(a)-1) would be correct.\n\nBut in the code above, when adding edges:\n\nadj_list(a, adj_count(a)) = b\n\nadj_count(a) = adj_count(a) +1\n\nWait, initially adj_count(a) is 0. So first assignment is to index 0, then adj_count becomes 1. So that's correct.\n\nNext, in the DFS subroutine, the loop over children is:\n\ndo i =0, adj_count(crt)-1\n\n   child = adj_list(crt,i)\n\nBut adj_count(crt) is the number of edges, so indices 0 to adj_count(crt)-1.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, the output_str is being built by appending to it each time. However, in Fortran, when you write to a character variable using write statements, you have to be careful with the length. The initial output_str is empty, then each append appends to it. But using the format '(a,i0,a,i0,a)' may not be the best way, because each time you write to output_str, you have to make sure that the new string is properly concatenated.\n\nWait, the write statement in Fortran is a bit tricky here. The current code uses:\n\nwrite(output_str, '(a,i0,a,i0,a)') trim(output_str), crt+1, ' ', child+1, char(10)\n\nBut this will overwrite the output_str variable. Because the output_str is both an input and the output variable. So this is incorrect.\n\nAh, right! The write statement is writing into output_str, but the first argument is the format, and the variables are the ones after. Wait, no, the syntax is:\n\nwrite(output_str, '(a,i0,a,i0,a)') trim(output_str), crt+1, ' ', child+1, char(10)\n\nThis is incorrect because the left-hand side of the write is the variable to write to, but the format is the second argument. The variables to be written are the third and onwards.\n\nWait, the correct syntax is:\n\nwrite (unit, fmt) variables\n\nSo in this case, the code is trying to write into the variable output_str, using the format '(a,i0,a,i0,a)', and the variables are trim(output_str), crt+1, etc. But this is not possible because the variable being written to cannot be part of the variables. This is a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to build the new string by concatenation.\n\nAlternatively, use a temporary variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=len(output_str)+10) :: temp_str\n\ntemp_str = trim(output_str) // trim(str(crt+1)) // ' ' // trim(str(child+1)) // char(10)\n\noutput_str = temp_str\n\nBut in Fortran, string concatenation can be done with // operator, but we need to handle the lengths properly.\n\nAlternatively, use an internal write to a temporary string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pre-allocate a large enough output_str and build it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array with a large enough size and track the current position.\n\nLet me think of an alternative approach.\n\nLet's pre-allocate output_str to a large size, say 1e6 characters.\n\nInitialize it as an empty string.\n\nThen, for each append, we can do:\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(adjustl(str(crt+1))) // ' ' // trim(adjustl(str(child+1))) // char(10)\n\nBut converting integers to strings in Fortran can be done with write statements into a character variable.\n\nAlternatively, use the edit descriptor to build the string.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to append a formatted string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: line\n\nwrite(line, '(i0,1x,i0)') crt+1, child+1\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(line) // char(10)\n\nThis way, each line is formatted into a temporary line variable, then appended to output_str.\n\nThis is better.\n\nSo modifying the DFS subroutine:\n\nInside the 'then' clause for visited(child) ==2:\n\nwrite(line, '(i0,1x,i0)') crt+1, child+1\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(line) // char(10)\n\nodd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n\nSimilarly for the other cases.\n\nWait, but line needs to be a local variable in the subroutine.\n\nSo in the DFS subroutine:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: line\n\nthen, when appending:\n\nwrite(line, '(i0,1x,i0)') ... \n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(line) // char(10)\n\nBut in Fortran, the output_str is a variable in the main program. Since the DFS is a subroutine in the main program's scope, it can access output_str directly.\n\nWait, in the code outline above, the output_str is in the main program, and the DFS subroutine is contained within the main program (using the 'contains' clause). Therefore, the DFS can access output_str directly.\n\nTherefore, the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInside the DFS subroutine:\n\nWhen appending a line:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: line\n\n...\n\nwrite(line, '(i0,1x,i0)') crt+1, child+1\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(line) // char(10)\n\nSimilarly for the other cases.\n\nWait, but in the case where the line is \"child+1 crt+1\", the code would be:\n\nwrite(line, '(i0,1x,i0)') child+1, crt+1\n\noutput_str = trim(output_str) // trim(line) // char(10)\n\nThis way, each line is properly formatted and appended.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, another issue: the initial allocation of adj_list. The adj_list is allocated as (0:numNode-1, 0:numEdge-1). But adj_count(a) can be up to numEdge (since each edge adds two entries, but per node, the maximum is numEdge if all edges are connected to that node). So the second dimension is okay.\n\nAnother point: in the DFS, the loop over children is:\n\ndo i =0, adj_count(crt)-1\n\n   child = adj_list(crt,i)\n\nBut adj_list is a 2D array where adj_list(crt, i) is the ith child of node crt. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the visited array is initialized to 0. The parent is passed as -1 (since nodes are 0-based). The initial call is dfs(0, -1).\n\nNow, the visited array is 0-based (0 to numNode-1).\n\nNow, the code for the second part: processing the output_str.\n\nThe first line is everything up to the first newline.\n\nThe first character is output_str(1:1).\n\nBut in Fortran, strings are 1-based. So if the first character is at position 1, then yes.\n\nSo the code:\n\npos = index(output_str, achar(10))\n\nif (pos ==0) then\n\n   first_char = output_str(1:1)\n\nelse\n\n   first_char = output_str(1:1)\n\nend if\n\nWait, even if there is a newline, the first character is still the first character of the first line. So the 'if' is redundant. So just:\n\nfirst_char = output_str(1:1)\n\nBut what if the output_str is empty? Well, in the case where numEdge is odd, output_str is \"-1\", so first_char is '-'.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, increment the ASCII value and print.\n\nprint *, achar(ichar(first_char)+1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the print statement will add a space or newline. To print exactly the character, perhaps:\n\nprint '(a)', achar(ichar(first_char)+1)\n\nAlternatively, use write(*, '(a)') achar(...).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together, the code should look like this.\n\nBut there are some possible issues:\n\n1. The adj_list allocation: the second dimension is numEdge, but adj_count(a) can be up to numEdge (since each edge contributes two entries, but per node, the maximum is numEdge if all edges are connected to that node). So the allocation is okay.\n\n2. The DFS recursion depth: if the graph is a long chain, the recursion depth could be large. But in programming contests, Fortran's stack may be sufficient for the problem's constraints.\n\n3. The output_str's size: if the output is very large, the 1e6 length may be insufficient. But given that the first program's output is pairs of numbers for each edge (or similar), the length should be manageable.\n\nAnother possible issue is the way the edges are stored in adj_list. In the code above, when adding an edge a-b:\n\nadj_list(a, adj_count(a)) = b\n\nadj_count(a) = adj_count(a)+1\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nBut initially, adj_count(a) is 0. So first assignment is to index 0, then adj_count becomes 1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing with a small example.\n\nSuppose the first program's input is:\n\n3 2\n\n0 1\n\n0 2\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the input is 1-based. So the edges are given as 1-based, so for example, the first edge is 1 and 2 (converted to 0 and 1), etc.\n\nWait, let's take an example where the first program's output is \"1 2\\n2 3\\n...\" etc.\n\nWait, let's take a simple case where the first program's output is \"1 2\\n\".\n\nThen the second program would take the first character '1', add 1 to get '2', and output that.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: when numEdge is odd, say 3 edges. Then the first program outputs \"-1\", so the second program takes the first character '-', adds 1 to get '.', and outputs '.'.\n\nNow, the code should handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The output_str is built correctly in the DFS.\n\n- The DFS logic is correctly implemented.\n\n- The first character is correctly extracted.\n\nAnother possible issue is the visited array's indices. The visited array is 0-based, which matches the nodes.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nI'll write the full code now, incorporating these considerations."
