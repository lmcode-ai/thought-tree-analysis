    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC164_D. It reads a string S from input, then processes it to compute some count related to mod 2019. The algorithm seems to calculate the number of substrings whose numeric value mod 2019 is 0. The output is the count of such substrings. The key steps are:\n\n- Read the string S.\n- Compute mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays.\n- Calculate the answer using combinations of counts where mod is the same.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC051_A, reads a string and replaces commas with spaces, then outputs it. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, which would be the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (since it's replacing commas). Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. The first program outputs a number, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string where commas are replaced. Wait, but if the first program's output is a number, like \"123\", then the second program would read that as a string, replace commas (but there are none), so output the same. But maybe the first program's output is a string with commas? Wait, no. The first program's output is a number, so the second program would just output the same number with commas replaced by spaces. But if the first program's output has no commas, then the second program's output is the same as the first's. But perhaps the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string, which may not have commas. So the second program's output would be the same as the first's output. But maybe the first program's output is a string with commas? Wait, no. The first program's output is a long integer, so it's printed as a number, which doesn't have commas unless the number is written with commas, but in Java, numbers are printed without commas. So the second program would just output the same number, but with commas replaced by spaces. But if the first program's output is, say, 1234, then the second program's output is the same. Unless the first program's output has commas, but that's not possible here. Wait, maybe the first program's output is a string that includes commas? No, the first program's output is a number, so it's printed as a numeric string without commas. Therefore, the second program's processing would leave it unchanged. But perhaps the problem is that the first program's output is a number, which is then passed to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program's input is the number as a string, and since there are no commas, the output is the same as the input. So the overall effect is that the final output is the same as the first program's output. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me recheck the code.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number, so when the second program reads it, it's a string like \"1234\", which has no commas, so the second program's output is the same. So the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. But the user wants to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So the Fortran program should read the input (the original input to the first Java program), process it through both steps, and output the final result (which is the same as the first program's output, since the second step does nothing here). Wait, but maybe the second program is supposed to process the first's output. Let me see the second Java code again.\n\nThe second Java program reads a line from input, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. So if the first program's output is a number like \"1234\", then the second program's input is \"1234\", which has no commas, so the output is the same. So the overall result is the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the combined Fortran program can just compute the first program's result and output it, since the second step does nothing. But maybe the first program's output could have commas? Let me think again. The first program's code is for problem ABC164 D, which counts the number of substrings divisible by 2019. The output is that count, which is a number. So the second program's input is that number as a string, which has no commas, so the second program's output is the same. Therefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the Fortran program can just compute the first program's result and output it. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nWait, the second Java program is from ABC051_A, which is a problem where you have to replace commas in a string with spaces. The input is a single string, and the output is that string with commas replaced. So if the first program's output is a number like \"1234\", then the second program's input is \"1234\", which has no commas, so the output is the same. Therefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the Fortran program can just compute the first program's result and output it. But why would the user provide two Java files then? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second's output is the final output. But in this case, the first's output is a number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. Since the second program replaces commas with spaces, but the number has no commas, the second program's output is the same as the first's output. Therefore, the final output is the same as the first's output. Therefore, the Fortran program can just compute the first's result and output it. But perhaps the first program's output is a string with commas? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java code's output: it's System.out.println(ans); where ans is a long. So the output is the number as a string without commas. So the second program's processing leaves it unchanged. Therefore, the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. Therefore, the Fortran program can just compute the first program's result and output it. But the user wants the entire sequence translated into a single Fortran program. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input (the original input to the first Java program, which is a string S).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the count of substrings mod 2019).\n\n3. Then, process that result through the second program's logic (replace commas with spaces in the string representation of the count).\n\nWait, but the count is a number. So when converted to a string, it's like \"1234\", which has no commas, so the second step does nothing. Therefore, the final output is the same as the first's output. Therefore, the Fortran program can just compute the first's result and output it. But maybe the problem requires that even if the second step does nothing, it must be included? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. The second's output is the final output. So even if the second program does nothing, the Fortran program must process the first's output through the second's logic. So even if the second program's processing leaves it the same, the Fortran code must do that step. So in this case, the Fortran program must take the first's output (the count as a string), replace commas with spaces, and output that. But since the count has no commas, the output is the same as the first's output. But the code must still perform that step.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran are:\n\n- Read the input string S (the input to the first Java program).\n\n- Compute the count as per the first Java program.\n\n- Convert that count to a string (since the second program's input is the first's output as a string).\n\n- Replace any commas in that string with spaces (though there are none).\n\n- Output the resulting string.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all these steps. So the main steps are:\n\n1. Read the input string S.\n\n2. Compute the count (the first program's result).\n\n3. Convert the count to a string, then replace commas with spaces.\n\n4. Output the modified string.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first Java program's algorithm:\n\nThe first program reads a string S, then processes it to compute the number of substrings divisible by 2019. The algorithm uses a mathematical approach to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe steps in the first Java program:\n\nInitialize mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays. mod_arr[i] is the mod 2019 of the substring from the end up to position i (or something like that). The code loops over each character in reverse, calculating the current mod value, then uses previous mod values to accumulate.\n\nWait, let me retrace the code:\n\nThe code loops from i=0 to N-1 (since N is the length of S). For each i, it takes the character at position N-1 -i (so starting from the end of the string). The character is converted to a digit (digit = (char - '0')), multiplied by radix (which is 10^i mod 2019?), then mod 2019. Then, if i is not 0, add mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019. Then mod_arr[i] is set to that value. The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod value occurs. The answer is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2), plus 1 for mod 0 (since the initial 0 is added? Wait, looking at the code:\n\nmod_cnt is initialized as an array of 2019 elements, all zero. Then, for each i, mod_cnt[tmp] is incremented. Then, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 (mod_cnt[0]++). Wait, why?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe code:\n\nmod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\nmod_cnt[0] is incremented in the loop for each occurrence of tmp being 0. Then, after the loop, mod_cnt[0] is increased by 1 again. Wait, perhaps the initial 0 is considered as an additional case. Let me think.\n\nThe algorithm is counting the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring from j+1 to i has a mod 2019 of 0. The way this is done is by using the prefix mod values. The mod_arr[i] represents the mod of the substring from the end up to position i (or maybe the other way around). The key idea is that if two prefix mods are the same, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019. So the count is the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. The mod_cnt array counts how many times each mod occurs, so the total pairs are sum_{k} (C(cnt_k, 2)). However, the code adds mod_cnt[0]++ after the loop. Wait, let me look again:\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nAfter the loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\nans is initialized to 0.\n\nmod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1 (mod_cnt[0]++). Then, for each i from 0 to 2018, ans += mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2.\n\nWait, why is mod_cnt[0] being incremented here?\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial 0 is considered as an additional element. Let me think of the standard approach for this problem.\n\nThe standard approach for counting substrings divisible by K is to compute the prefix mod array. For each position i, the mod of the number formed by the first i digits (or some direction) mod K. Then, the number of pairs (i,j) where mod[i] = mod[j] gives a substring from j+1 to i that is divisible by K. The count is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). However, in this code, the mod array is computed in a different way, perhaps considering the string in reverse, and using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the string as a number and using a different method. Let me think through the code's variables.\n\nThe code processes the string from the end, using a radix that is 10^i mod 2019. The variable 'radix' starts at 1, and for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 2019. So for each character from the end, the digit is (digit) * (10^i mod 2019). The mod_arr[i] is the sum of all such terms up to that point, mod 2019. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe loop is for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nThe current character is S.charAt(N-1 -i). So for i=0, it's the last character of the string. For i=1, the second last, etc. So the loop is processing the string from the end to the beginning.\n\nThe digit is (char - '0'). Then, the term is digit * radix mod 2019. Then, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] mod 2019. So mod_arr[i] = (digit * radix + mod_arr[i-1]) mod 2019.\n\nWait, but the order here is important. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of the string as S = s_0 s_1 ... s_{N-1}, with s_0 being the first character. The code processes the characters in reverse order, starting from s_{N-1}, then s_{N-2}, etc.\n\nThe variable 'radix' starts at 1. For each step i (starting from 0 to N-1):\n\ndigit = s_{N-1 -i} - '0'\n\nterm = digit * radix mod 2019\n\nthen, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1], mod 2019.\n\nWait, so mod_arr[i] = (term + (mod_arr[i-1] if i>0 else 0)) mod 2019.\n\nThe radix is then updated as (radix *10) mod 2019.\n\nSo the mod_arr[i] represents the value of the substring from the end up to the current position (i+1 characters?), mod 2019. \n\nThe idea is that for each position, the current mod is computed, and the mod_cnt counts how many times each mod has been seen. The total number of pairs is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). But why is mod_cnt[0] being incremented after the loop?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt[0] is incremented by 1. Then, the loop over mod_cnt adds mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2 for each i. \n\nWait, perhaps the initial 0 is considered as an additional element. Let me think of an example. Suppose the mod array has a mod value of 0 at some position. The count for mod 0 is, say, 3. Then, the formula would be 3*2/2 =3. But if we add an extra 1 to mod_cnt[0], making it 4, then it would be 4*3/2 =6. But that would overcount. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering the empty prefix as having mod 0. Let me think of the standard approach again.\n\nIn the standard approach for counting substrings divisible by K, the prefix mod array is of length N+1, where prefix[0] =0, and prefix[i] is the mod of the first i digits. Then, the number of pairs is the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2). \n\nIn this code, perhaps the mod array is of length N, and the initial 0 is not included. So by adding 1 to mod_cnt[0], it's effectively adding the prefix[0] =0 into the count. \n\nSo the code's approach is:\n\n- The mod array is computed for each position (from the end), but the initial 0 is not part of the array. \n\n- The mod_cnt counts the occurrences of each mod in the mod array. \n\n- Then, adding 1 to mod_cnt[0] accounts for the prefix[0] =0, so that when calculating the pairs, it includes the cases where one of the indices is 0 (the empty prefix). \n\nTherefore, the total pairs are indeed the sum over (count choose 2) for all mod values, including the added 0. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part: reading the input string S. In Fortran, we can read a string using read(*,*) or read(*,'(A)').\n\nThen, processing the string to compute the mod array and mod counts.\n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the string S.\n\n2. Compute N = len_trim(S).\n\n3. Initialize arrays mod_arr and mod_cnt. mod_arr is an array of size N. mod_cnt is an array of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\n4. Initialize variables: radix =1, mod_arr and mod_cnt arrays.\n\n5. Loop over i from 0 to N-1 (since in Fortran arrays are 1-based, but maybe we can use 0-based with adjustment).\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based with the 'dimension' statement. Alternatively, adjust indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of Fortran's 1-based arrays.\n\nWait, the original code uses 0-based indices for mod_arr (from 0 to N-1). So in Fortran, perhaps we can use an array of size N, with indices 1 to N, and adjust the loop accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nallocate mod_arr(0:N-1) (but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so maybe mod_arr(1:N))\n\nWait, perhaps better to use 1-based arrays. Let me see:\n\nInitialize mod_arr as an array of size N (since N is the length). mod_cnt is size 2019 (indices 1 to 2019?), but in the code, mod values are 0 to 2018, so mod_cnt(0:2018) would be better. But in Fortran, arrays can have lower bounds. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\nmod_cnt = 0\n\nSimilarly, mod_arr is an array of size N (since N is the length of S). Let's use mod_arr(1:N).\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1 (Java's 0-based). So in Fortran, perhaps we can loop from 1 to N, and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me reindex:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n   char at position N-1 -i.\n\nIn Fortran, the string is stored as a character array, say S(1:N). So the character at position N - i (since when i is 0, it's N-1 -0 = N-1, which is the last character in 0-based, but in Fortran it's S(N). Wait, let's see:\n\nJava's S.charAt(N-1 -i) corresponds to the (N-1 -i)th character in 0-based, which is the (N -i)th character in 1-based (since 0-based index +1 is 1-based). So in Fortran, the character is S(N -i).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i runs from 0 to N-1 (total N iterations). For each i, the character is at position (N-1 -i) in the string. So for i=0, it's the last character (position N-1 in 0-based, which is S(N) in 1-based). For i=1, it's position N-2 (Java's 0-based) which is S(N-1) in 1-based. So in Fortran, the character is S(N -i).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's index: N-1 -i \u2192 0-based.\n\nFortran's index: (N-1 -i) +1 = N -i \u2192 1-based.\n\nYes. So in Fortran, the character is S(N -i).\n\nWait, but in the loop, i in Fortran would be from 1 to N (since in Java it's 0-based up to N-1). Wait, perhaps in Fortran, the loop variable should be from 1 to N, and the equivalent of Java's i is (i_fortran -1). Let me think:\n\nLet me reindex:\n\nJava's i: 0 \u2192 N-1 (total N steps).\n\nIn Fortran, let's have a loop variable i from 1 to N. Then, the equivalent of Java's i is (i_fortran -1). So:\n\nJava's i \u2192 Fortran's i_fortran = i +1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a loop from 1 to N in Fortran, and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   current_char = S(N - (i-1)) \u2192 because Java's i is (i_fortran -1). So N - (i-1) is the position in Fortran's 1-based.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's i is 0 \u2192 N-1.\n\nFortran's i_fortran runs from 1 to N.\n\nJava's i = i_fortran -1.\n\nSo the character in Java is S.charAt(N-1 - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 N-1 -i_fortran +1 = N -i_fortran \u2192 which is the 1-based index N -i_fortran +1? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first character in the string as S(1), last as S(N).\n\nIn Java, the first character is S[0], last is S[N-1].\n\nSo for Java's i, the character is S[N-1 -i], which is the (N-1 -i)th character in 0-based \u2192 which is S(N -i) in 1-based.\n\nYes. So in Fortran, for each i from 1 to N (Fortran's loop variable), the character is S(N - (i-1) + 0? Wait, perhaps better to write:\n\nIn Fortran, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nJava's i is (i_fortran -1).\n\nThe character is S(N - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 which is S(N -i_fortran +1).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nJava's i = 0 \u2192 character is S[N-1 -0] = S[N-1], which is S(N) in Fortran.\n\nFortran's i_fortran =1 \u2192 N - (1-1) = N \u2192 S(N).\n\nJava's i=1 \u2192 character is S[N-1 -1] = S[N-2], which is S(N-1) in Fortran.\n\nFortran's i_fortran=2 \u2192 N - (2-1) = N-1 \u2192 S(N-1).\n\nYes, so the correct index is S(N - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 S(N -i_fortran +1).\n\nAlternatively, S(N - i_fortran +1).\n\nSo in code:\n\ndigit = ichar(S(N - i_fortran +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be accessed as characters. So S is a character array of length N.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N (since N is the length of S). Let's make it 1-based.\n\nmod_cnt is an array of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0.\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to N:\n\ndigit = S(N -i +1) - '0' (since for i=1, it's N -1 +1 = N \u2192 S(N), which is correct).\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, for i_fortran =1:\n\nN -i +1 \u2192 N -1 +1 = N \u2192 correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, compute tmp = digit * radix mod 2019.\n\nThen, if i >1 (since in Java, i starts at 0, so when i_fortran is 1, Java's i is 0 \u2192 the 'if i !=0' condition is false. So in Fortran, the condition is if i_fortran >1 \u2192 then add mod_arr(i-1).\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nif (i !=0) \u2192 then add mod_arr[i-1].\n\nIn Fortran, for i_fortran from 1 to N:\n\nJava's i is (i_fortran -1). So when i_fortran is 1 \u2192 Java's i is 0 \u2192 condition is false.\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition is if (i_fortran >1).\n\nSo:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019\n\nif (i_fortran >1) then\n\n   tmp = (tmp + mod_arr(i_fortran -1)) mod 2019\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i_fortran) = tmp mod 2019 (though mod is already mod 2019?)\n\nWait, the previous calculation already mod 2019, but adding mod_arr[i-1] may exceed, so need to mod again.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) % 2019;\n\nif (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) % 2019;\n\nmod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ntmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\nif (i_fortran >1) then\n\n   tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i_fortran -1), 2019 )\n\nend if\n\nmod_arr(i_fortran) = tmp\n\nThen, mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nThen, update radix:\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nWait, in Java, radix is updated after each step. So in Fortran, after processing each i_fortran, we do:\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nWait, but in Java, the order is:\n\ncompute tmp, then mod_arr[i], then mod_cnt, then update radix.\n\nWait, in Java's code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\n    int tmp = ...;\n\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n\n    radix = radix *10 %2019;\n\n}\n\nWait, the radix is updated after the mod_cnt increment. So in Fortran, after processing the current i_fortran, we need to update the radix.\n\nSo the steps in the loop are:\n\ndigit = ... \n\ncompute tmp.\n\ncompute mod_arr(i_fortran).\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) +=1.\n\nthen, update radix.\n\nWait, in Java, the order is:\n\ntmp is computed, then mod_arr[i] is set, then mod_cnt is incremented, then radix is updated.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing mod_arr(i_fortran) = tmp,\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nthen, radix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo the loop steps are:\n\ndo i_fortran =1, N\n\n   current_char = S(N -i_fortran +1)\n\n   digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n   tmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\n   if (i_fortran >1) then\n\n      tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i_fortran -1), 2019 )\n\n   end if\n\n   mod_arr(i_fortran) = tmp\n\n   mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n   radix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but initially, radix starts at 1. So before the loop, we need to set radix =1.\n\nNow, after the loop, we need to compute the answer.\n\nThe code in Java does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nans =0\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2019; i++) ans += mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=0,2018\n\n   ans = ans + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second program's processing: take the ans (as a string), replace commas with spaces, then output.\n\nWait, but ans is a long integer. So in Fortran, we can write it as an integer*8 (if needed), but in the code, the maximum possible value?\n\nThe maximum possible number of pairs is (1e5 choose 2) if N is 1e5, but 2019 is small, so mod_cnt can have up to N entries. But the maximum ans would be (N)^2 /2, which for N up to 1e5 is about 5e9, which fits in a 32-bit integer. So in Fortran, using integer(8) for ans is safe.\n\nSo after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, replace commas with spaces, then output.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: ans_str\n\nwrite(ans_str, '(I0)') ans\n\nThen, process ans_str to replace commas with spaces.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing a number with write(*, '(I0)'), it doesn't use commas. So the string ans_str will have no commas, so replacing them does nothing. But the code must do it anyway.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert ans to a string.\n\n2. Replace any commas in the string with spaces.\n\n3. Output the resulting string.\n\nIn Fortran, to replace commas with spaces in a string:\n\ndo i =1, len_trim(ans_str)\n\n   if (ans_str(i:i) == ',') then\n\n      ans_str(i:i) = ' '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, using a loop.\n\nAlternatively, using a function.\n\nAlternatively, using a mask:\n\nans_str = adjustl(ans_str)  ! Not sure if needed.\n\nBut since the original number has no commas, the replacement does nothing, but the code must do it.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all the steps into a Fortran program.\n\nThe program outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   character(len=100000) :: S  ! Assuming input string is up to 1e5 characters.\n\n   integer :: N, i, tmp, radix, ans\n\n   integer, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\n   character(len=20) :: ans_str\n\n   !

Process the string\n\n   do i =1, N\n\n      integer :: digit\n\n      character(1) :: current_char\n\n      current_char = S(N -i +1: N -i +1)\n\n      digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n      tmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\n      if (i >1) then\n\n         tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\n      end if\n\n      mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n      mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n      radix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Compute the answer\n\n   mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\n   ans =0\n\n   do i=0,2018\n\n      ans = ans + mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Process the answer through the second program's logic\n\n   write(ans_str, '(I0)') ans\n\n   ! Replace commas with spaces\n\n   integer :: j, len_ans\n\n   len_ans = len_trim(ans_str)\n\n   do j=1, len_ans\n\n      if (ans_str(j:j) == ',') then\n\n         ans_str(j:j) = ' '\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Output the result\n\n   print *, trim(ans_str)\n\n   deallocate(mod_arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement for ans_str may not include commas. Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose ans is 12345. The write statement would produce \"12345\", no commas. So the replacement loop does nothing, and the output is \"12345\".\n\nAnother example: if ans is 1000000, the string would be \"1000000\" (no commas in Fortran's default formatting). So the replacement is unnecessary, but the code must do it.\n\nNow, checking the code for possible errors.\n\nFirst, the allocation of mod_arr: since N can be up to the length of S, which is read as a string. The initial S is declared as len=100000, which should be sufficient for the problem's constraints (assuming the first Java program's problem allows up to 1e5 characters).\n\nThe loop over i from 1 to N:\n\ncurrent_char is S(N -i +1: N -i +1). For example, when i=1, it's S(N: N), which is the last character. Correct.\n\ndigit is computed correctly.\n\nThe tmp calculation is correct.\n\nThe mod_arr is stored correctly.\n\nmod_cnt is incremented.\n\nradix is updated.\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt(0) is increased by 1.\n\nThen ans is computed as the sum over mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2.\n\nThen, converting ans to a string, replacing commas with spaces, and outputting.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The mod function in Fortran: mod(a,b) returns a remainder with the same sign as b. But since all terms are positive, it should be okay. The Java code uses % which can give negative results, but since all terms are mod 2019, the mod in Fortran should be equivalent.\n\nWait, in Java, (a % b) can be negative if a is negative, but in this case, all terms are positive, so mod in Fortran should be same as Java's %.\n\n- The division in the ans calculation: mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1)/2 must be integer division. In Fortran, when both operands are integers, it does integer division. Since mod_cnt(i)*(mod_cnt(i)-1) is even (since it's n*(n-1)), the division is exact.\n\n- The string length for ans_str: 20 characters should be enough for the maximum possible ans. The maximum possible ans is when all mod values are the same. For N=1e5, mod_cnt(0) would be N+1 (after adding 1), so (N+1 choose 2) is about 5e9, which is 10 digits. So 20 is sufficient.\n\n- The replacement loop: even if there are no commas, it's okay.\n\nNow, testing with a sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFor the first Java program, let's take S = \"321\".\n\nThe first program's output is the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nWait, let's compute manually.\n\nThe string \"321\" has substrings:\n\n\"3\" \u2192 3 mod 2019 \u2192 3\n\n\"32\" \u219232 mod 2019 \u219232\n\n\"321\" \u2192321 mod 2019 \u2192321\n\n\"2\" \u21922 mod 2019 \u21922\n\n\"21\" \u219221 mod 2019 \u219221\n\n\"1\" \u21921 mod 2019 \u21921\n\nNone of these are 0 mod 2019. So the answer is 0.\n\nThen the second program would output \"0\" (since the first's output is 0, which has no commas).\n\nSo the Fortran program should output \"0\".\n\nTesting the code with S = \"321\":\n\nThe code would compute mod_arr for each position.\n\nLet me walk through the steps:\n\nN=3.\n\nmod_arr is size 3.\n\nmod_cnt initialized to 0.\n\nradix starts at 1.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 3:\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_char is S(3 -1 +1) = S(3) \u2192 '1'\n\ndigit =1.\n\ntmp = 1 *1 mod2019 \u21921.\n\nsince i=1>1?

So total ans is 0 + ... + (1*0)/2 \u21920.\n\nWait, mod_cnt(0) was initially 0, then becomes 1. So mod_cnt(0) is 1. So (1 choose 2) is 0. So the total ans is 0.\n\nThen, the second step converts 0 to \"0\", no commas, so output is \"0\".\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: S = \"2019\".\n\nThe first program's output should be the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nThe entire string \"2019\" is 2019 mod2019 \u21920. So the substring \"2019\" is one. Also, any substring that is 0 mod2019.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe substrings:\n\n\"2\" \u21922 mod2019 \u21922\n\n\"20\" \u219220 mod2019 \u219220\n\n\"201\" \u2192201 mod2019 \u2192201\n\n\"2019\" \u21922019 mod2019 \u21920 \u2192 count +=1.\n\nOther substrings:\n\n\"0\" \u21920 mod2019 \u21920 \u2192 count +=1 (the substring \"0\" is the second character? Wait, no. Wait, the substrings are all possible contiguous sequences.\n\nWait, the string is \"2019\".\n\nSubstrings:\n\n\"2\" \u21922 mod2019 \u21922\n\n\"20\" \u219220 mod2019 \u219220\n\n\"201\" \u2192201 mod2019 \u2192201\n\n\"2019\" \u21922019 mod2019 \u21920 \u2192 count +=1.\n\n\"0\" \u2192 the second character is '0', so substring \"0\" \u21920 mod2019 \u21920 \u2192 count +=1.\n\n\"01\" \u219201 \u21921 mod2019 \u21921.\n\n\"019\" \u219219 mod2019 \u219219.\n\n\"1\" \u21921 mod2019 \u21921.\n\n\"19\" \u219219 mod2019 \u219219.\n\n\"9\" \u21929 mod2019 \u21929.\n\nSo the substrings with mod 0 are \"0\" and \"2019\". So total of 2 substrings. But the algorithm counts the number of pairs (i,j) where mod[i] = mod[j], which would give the number of such substrings.\n\nWait, the algorithm's answer is the number of pairs (i,j) with i < j and mod[i] = mod[j]. Because each such pair corresponds to a substring from j+1 to i (or something like that). Wait, perhaps the algorithm counts the number of pairs (i,j) where mod[i] = mod[j], which would give the number of substrings divisible by 2019.\n\nWait, in the example above, the mod array would be computed as follows:\n\nLet me compute mod_arr for S = \"2019\".\n\nN=4.\n\nProcessing from the end:\n\ni_fortran from 1 to 4.\n\ni=1 (Java's i=0):\n\ncurrent_char is S(4 -1 +1) = S(4) \u2192 '9'\n\ndigit=9.\n\ntmp =9 *1 mod2019 \u21929.\n\nmod_arr(1)=9.\n\nmod_cnt(9) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10.\n\ni=2 (Java's i=1):\n\ncurrent_char is S(4-2+1)=S(3) \u2192 '1'\n\ndigit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\nAdd mod_arr(1)=9 \u219210+9=19 mod2019 \u219219.\n\nmod_arr(2)=19.\n\nmod_cnt(19) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod2019 \u2192100.\n\ni=3 (Java's i=2):\n\ncurrent_char is S(4-3+1)=S(2) \u2192 '0'\n\ndigit=0.\n\ntmp =0 *100 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nAdd mod_arr(2)=19 \u21920+19=19 mod2019 \u219219.\n\nmod_arr(3)=19.\n\nmod_cnt(19) becomes 2.\n\nradix becomes 100*10 mod2019 \u21921000.\n\ni=4 (Java's i=3):\n\ncurrent_char is S(4-4+1)=S(1) \u2192 '2'\n\ndigit=2.\n\ntmp =2 *1000 mod2019 \u21922000 mod2019 \u21922000-2019= -19 \u2192 mod is 2000 mod2019 is 2000 (since 2019*0 +2000).\n\nWait, 2000 mod2019 is 2000.\n\nThen add mod_arr(3)=19 \u21922000+19=2019 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nmod_arr(4)=0.\n\nmod_cnt(0) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 1000*10 mod2019 \u219210000 mod2019.\n\nWait, but after processing i=4, mod_cnt(0) is 1 (from mod_arr(4)=0).\n\nAfter the loop, mod_cnt(0) is incremented to 2.\n\nNow, the mod_cnt array:\n\nmod_cnt(0) =2 (from initial 1 (from mod_arr(4)=0) plus the increment).\n\nmod_cnt(9)=1.\n\nmod_cnt(19)=2 (from mod_arr(2)=19 and mod_arr(3)=19).\n\nmod_cnt(0) is 2.\n\nOther entries are 0.\n\nThe ans is:\n\nmod_cnt(0) choose 2 \u21922*1/2 =1.\n\nmod_cnt(19) choose 2 \u21922*1/2 =1.\n\nmod_cnt(9) choose 0 \u21920.\n\nTotal ans =1+1 =2.\n\nSo the first program's output is 2. The second program would output \"2\" (no commas), so the final output is \"2\".\n\nTesting the code with S=\"2019\" should give 2.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the final Fortran code."
