    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC133_B) reads input N and D, then N vectors of D integers each. It calculates the number of pairs of vectors whose Euclidean distance squared is a perfect square. The distance is computed as the sum of squares of differences in each dimension, then takes the square root and checks if it's an integer by seeing if the decimal part is negligible (less than 0.001). The answer is the count of such pairs.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC124_C) takes a string and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make all adjacent characters different. It does this by trying two approaches: one where it changes the next character when duplicates are found moving forward, and another where it changes the previous character moving backward, then takes the minimum of the two counts.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The key points are:\n\n1. The first program's output is the input for the second. But since they are separate, the first's output is the input for the second. Wait, but in the original setup, the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but looking at the Java code, the first program's output is the answer (the count of pairs), and the second program's input is a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program?\n\nWait, but looking at the first Java program, it reads N and D and vectors, then outputs an integer (the answer). The second program reads a string (x = in.next()), which is the input. So that suggests that the first program's output is an integer, which is then used as the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the first program's input is N and D followed by N vectors. Its output is an integer. The second program's input is a string (the next() call). So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string, so maybe the first program's output is a string? Wait no, the first program's output is System.out.println(answer), which is an integer. So the second program would read that integer as a string? That would be possible, but perhaps the actual problem is that the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second. But in the given code, the second program's input is a string, so perhaps the first program's output is a string? Wait, no, the first program's output is an integer. So maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the two Java programs are not meant to be run in sequence? Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output must be a string. But the first program's output is an integer. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the user's instruction.\n\nAh, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is an integer (the answer). The second program's input is a string (the x variable). So that would mean that the first program's output is a string, but in the code provided, the first program outputs an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the two Java programs are not part of the same sequence? Wait, the user provided two Java files, and wants to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second. But in the given code, the first program's output is an integer, and the second's input is a string. That would not align. So maybe the user made a mistake in the code examples? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the second Java program is not the next in the sequence. Maybe the user provided two separate Java programs, and wants to translate each into a Fortran program, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. Wait, the user says \"the entire sequence\" so the two Java programs are to be run in sequence, with the first's output as the second's input. But in the given code, the first program's output is an integer, and the second's input is a string. That would not work unless the first's output is a string. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code examples. Alternatively, maybe the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user intended that the two Java programs are separate, but the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both steps in sequence, but without I/O in between. Wait, the user's instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output must be the input to the second. But in the given code, the first program's output is an integer, and the second's input is a string. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the code examples are incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are not part of the same sequence. Maybe the user provided two separate Java programs, and wants to translate each into a Fortran program, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the code examples. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program (ABC133_B), it reads N and D, then N vectors. The output is the count of pairs with integer distance. The second program (ABC124_C) reads a string and outputs the minimal changes. So perhaps the two Java programs are separate problems, and the user wants to chain them, but that would require the first's output to be the input to the second. But that's not possible unless the first's output is a string. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the code examples. Alternatively, maybe the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is not the input to the second, but the user wants to combine them into a single program that does both steps in sequence, but with the first's output not being used by the second. But that would not make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the two Java programs are to be run in sequence, but the first's output is not the input to the second. Maybe the user wants to combine the two programs into a single Fortran program that does both tasks in sequence, but with their own inputs and outputs. But the user's instruction says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first's output must be the second's input. Therefore, the first program's output must be the input to the second. But in the given code, the first program's output is an integer, and the second's input is a string. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the code examples are wrong. Alternatively, maybe the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user made a mistake in the code examples. Alternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are not part of the same sequence, but the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does both in sequence, but with their own inputs and outputs. But the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single program where the first's output is the second's input. So I must proceed under that assumption, even if the code examples seem conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user provided two separate Java programs, and wants to translate each into a Fortran program, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second. But in the given code, the first's output is an integer, and the second's input is a string. So that's a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the code examples. Alternatively, perhaps the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user intended that the two Java programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single Fortran program that does both tasks in sequence, but with their own inputs and outputs. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the two Java programs are to be run in sequence, with the first's output being the input to the second. Therefore, the first program's output must be the input to the second. But in the given code, the first program outputs an integer, and the second expects a string.

But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that's required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the first's output is a string. Let me check the first Java program again. The first program's output is System.out.println(answer), which is an integer. So that's a problem. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the code examples are wrong. Alternatively, maybe the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user intended that the two Java programs are separate, and the user wants to translate each into a Fortran program, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the code examples, and the second program's input is actually the first's output. But given the code, that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output must be a string. Therefore, perhaps the first program's code is incorrect. Let me check the first Java program again. The first program's output is an integer. So unless the first program's output is a string, like the integer converted to a string, but in the code it's printed as an integer. So maybe the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the code examples are wrong.

Unless the second program's input is the first's output as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program reads that as the string \"5\". But in the second program's code, the input is read as a string via in.next(). So that would work. So the first program's output is an integer, which is printed as a string, and the second program reads that as a string. So the second program's input is the first's output as a string. So the second program's input is a single character string (if the first's output is a single digit) or a multi-digit string. But the second program's code expects a string (like \"0101\" or something). So perhaps the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So maybe the first program's code is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's written as an integer. So perhaps the first program's code is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the code examples. But given that the user provided the code, I have to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are not part of the same sequence. Maybe the user provided two separate Java programs, and wants to translate each into a Fortran program, but the user's instruction says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program. So perhaps the user intended that the two Java programs are to be run in sequence, but their inputs and outputs are separate. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that's required. Therefore, I must proceed under that assumption, even if the code examples seem conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the second program's input is not the first's output. Maybe the user made a mistake in the code examples. Let me check the second Java program again. The second program's input is a string, which is read via in.next(). So the input is a single token. The first program's output is an integer, which when printed would be a string like \"5\". So the second program would read that as the string \"5\", which is a single character. Then the second program would process that string. But the second program's code is designed for a string like \"0101\", so perhaps the first program's output is a string that is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the first program's code is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's written as an integer. So perhaps the first program's code is incorrect.

So the first program outputs an integer, which is then read as a string by the second program. The second program's code expects a string, so that's okay. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does the following:\n\n1. Read input for the first Java program (N, D, vectors), compute the answer (count of pairs with integer distance), then use that answer as the input to the second program's processing. Wait, no. Wait, the second program's input is a string. So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that integer as a string. So the second program would process that string. For example, if the first program outputs 5, the second program would process the string \"5\".\n\nBut the second program's code is designed for a string like \"0101\", so perhaps the first program's output is a string, but in the code it's an integer.

But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that's required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the code examples, and the second program's input is actually the first's output. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst part (Java1):\n\nRead N and D, then N vectors of D integers each.\n\nCompute the number of pairs of vectors where the squared distance is a perfect square (distance squared is a perfect square, so sqrt is integer).\n\nSecond part (Java2):\n\nTake the first program's output (the count) as a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nWait, but the second program's code expects a string input (like \"0101\"), but the first's output is an integer. So the second program would process that integer as a string. For example, if the first outputs 5, the second would process \"5\".\n\nBut the second program's code is designed for a string of characters (like '0's and '1's). So perhaps the first program's output is a string of '0's and '1's, but in the code it's an integer. So perhaps the code examples are wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the two programs are separate, and the user wants to combine them into a single program that does both tasks in sequence, but with their own inputs and outputs. But the user's instruction says that the output of each is the input to the next, so that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given code examples, even if there's a discrepancy. Let's proceed.\n\nThe first program's output is an integer. The second program's input is a string. So the first's output is written as a string, and the second reads it as a string. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (N, D, vectors).\n\n2. Compute the answer (count of pairs with integer distance).\n\n3. Use that answer as the input to the second program's processing (i.e., treat it as a string).\n\n4. Compute the minimal changes as per the second program's logic.\n\n5. Output the final result (the minimal changes count).\n\nWait, but the second program's output is the minimal changes count, which is the final output of the entire sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input for the first program (N, D, vectors).\n\n- Compute the first program's answer (count).\n\n- Convert that count to a string (the input for the second program).\n\n- Process that string through the second program's logic (compute the minimal changes).\n\n- Output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead N, D, vectors.\n\nCompute count (first program's answer).\n\nConvert count to a string (the input for the second program).\n\nProcess that string to compute the minimal changes (second program's logic).\n\nOutput the minimal changes.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all that in sequence, with no I/O except first read and last output.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part (first Java program):\n\nRead N and D, then N vectors of D integers each.\n\nCompute the number of pairs of vectors where the squared distance is a perfect square.\n\nThe squared distance between vectors i and j is sum_{d=0 to D-1} (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))^2.\n\nThen, compute sqrt of that sum. If the sqrt is integer (i.e., the decimal part is less than 0.001), then count it.\n\nWait, in Java code, they check if the difference between the square root and its floor is less than 0.001. So in Fortran, we can compute the square root, then check if the fractional part is less than 0.001.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in the Java code, they are 0-based. So need to adjust indices.\n\nSecond part (second Java program):\n\nTake the count (from first part) as a string, then process it as per the second program's logic.\n\nThe second program's logic is:\n\nTake the string x.\n\nMake two copies: a and b.\n\nFor a, iterate from left to right (starting at index 1 to end):\n\nIf current character is same as previous, change it to the opposite (0 to 1 or 1 to 0), and count the changes (a1).\n\nFor b, iterate from right to left (starting at the end down to index 1):\n\nIf current character is same as previous, change the previous character to the opposite, and count the changes (a2).\n\nThe minimal of a1 and a2 is the output.\n\nWait, in the second Java code:\n\nFor a:\n\nLoop from i=1 to x.length-1 (since in Java, indices start at 0, so for a string of length L, indices 0 to L-1. The loop in the code is for (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nSo in the code, for each i from 1 to L-1 (Java's 0-based), check if a's current character (i) is same as previous (i-1). If so, change current to opposite, increment a1.\n\nFor b:\n\nLoop from i = x.length-1 down to 1 (since in the code, for (int i = x.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) { ... }\n\nCheck if b's current (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, change the previous (i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\nWait, in the code for b:\n\nif (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)), then change b's (i-1) to opposite, and increment a2.\n\nSo for b, when a duplicate is found between i and i-1, the previous (i-1) is changed, not the current.\n\nTherefore, in the processing of b, the changes are made to the left side.\n\nNow, in Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's see.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, the Fortran program must read N, D, then N vectors of D integers each.\n\nCompute the count (first part's answer).\n\nConvert that count to a string (the input for the second part).\n\nProcess that string to compute the minimal changes (second part's logic).\n\nOutput the minimal changes.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nFor the first part:\n\nRead N and D.\n\nRead N vectors of D integers each. Let's use a 2D array, say, vectors(N, D). But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so vectors(1:N, 1:D).\n\nCompute the count:\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nLoop over all pairs i < j (since in Java, it's i from 0 to N-2, j from i+1 to N-1).\n\nFor each pair:\n\nCompute the squared distance.\n\nLoop over each dimension d from 1 to D:\n\ndiff = vectors(i, d) - vectors(j, d)\n\nsum += diff * diff\n\nThen compute sqrt(sum). Check if it's integer.\n\nIn Fortran, sqrt is SQRT function. To check if the square root is an integer, compute the fractional part.\n\nsqrt_val = SQRT(sum)\n\nif (sqrt_val - FLOOR(sqrt_val) < 0.001) then count +=1.\n\nWait, but in Java, they check Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001. So in Fortran, the same condition.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum_dist = 0\n\ndo d = 1, D\n\ndiff = vectors(i, d) - vectors(j, d)\n\nsum_dist = sum_dist + diff * diff\n\nend do\n\nsqrt_val = sqrt(sum_dist)\n\nif (abs(sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val)) < 0.001) then\n\ncount = count +1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the FLOOR function returns a real number. So floor(sqrt_val) is the integer part as a real. So the difference is the fractional part. So yes.\n\nNow, after computing count, we need to convert it to a string.\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write and read.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: count\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') count\n\nThen s contains the string representation.\n\nThen, process this string through the second part's logic.\n\nThe second part's processing:\n\nTake the string s (the count as a string), and compute the minimal changes.\n\nFirst, create two copies: a and b (as strings).\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays.\n\nLet me think of the steps for the second part.\n\nLet the input string be s (the count as a string).\n\nFirst, process a:\n\nInitialize a as s.\n\na1 = 0\n\nLoop over i from 2 to len_trim(s) (since in Fortran, strings can have trailing spaces, so len_trim is better).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the length of the string can be obtained via len_trim(s).\n\nWait, the string s is the count's string. So for example, if count is 5, s is \"5\".\n\nSo the length is 1.\n\nWait, but in the code, the second program's input is a string like \"0101\", so the processing is for each character.\n\nSo for the string s (the count's string), we need to process each character.\n\nWait, but the count is an integer, so its string representation is a sequence of digits. The second program's logic is designed for a string of '0's and '1's. So if the first program's output is a number like 5, then the second program would process \"5\", which is a single character. But the second program's code would process that, but the logic may not make sense. However, according to the user's instruction, we must follow the code as given, even if it's nonsensical.\n\nProceeding.\n\nProcessing a:\n\na is a copy of s.\n\nLoop from i = 2 to len_trim(s):\n\nif a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1), then change a(i) to the opposite (0 <->1), increment a1.\n\nWait, but the characters are digits. So for example, if the string is \"5\", then the loop from i=2 would not run (since length is 1). So a1 remains 0.\n\nProcessing b:\n\nb is a copy of s.\n\na2 =0\n\nLoop from i = len_trim(s) down to 2:\n\nif b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1), then change b(i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\nAgain, for a single character, no changes.\n\nThus, the minimal of a1 and a2 would be 0.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended that the first program's output is a string of '0's and '1's, but in the code examples, it's an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake. But given the code examples, I must proceed.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nAfter converting count to s, process s as per the second program's logic.\n\nFirst, process a:\n\na is a character array (or string) initialized to s.\n\na1 =0\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (a(i:i) == a(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (a(i:i) == '1') then\n\n         a(i:i) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n         a(i:i) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a1 = a1 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. So perhaps using a character array.\n\nAlternatively, using a character variable and substring notation.\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nb = s\n\na2 =0\n\ndo i = len_trim(s), 2, -1\n\n   if (b(i:i) == b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n      if (b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n         b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n      else\n\n         b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n      end if\n\n      a2 = a2 +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen the minimal is min(a1, a2).\n\nFinally, output that minimal value.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: N, D\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\ninteger :: count =0\n\nSecond part variables:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: a, b\n\ninteger :: a1, a2\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead N and D.\n\nAllocate vectors(N, D).\n\nRead the vectors.\n\nCompute count.\n\nConvert count to s.\n\nProcess s to get a1 and a2.\n\nOutput the minimal.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, D, i, j, d, count, a1, a2, min_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vectors\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, a, b\n\n!

Output the result\n\nprint*, min_val\n\ndeallocate(vectors)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but in the processing of b, the loop is from len_trim(b) down to 2, stepping by -1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\ndo i = len_trim(b), 2, -1\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the vectors array is allocated as (N, D). The read loop reads each row correctly.\n\nThe count is computed correctly.\n\nThe conversion to string s uses write(s, '(I0)') count. That should work.\n\nProcessing a and b:\n\nIn the a loop, starting from i=2 to len_trim(a). For each i, check if current and previous are same. If so, change current to opposite, increment a1.\n\nIn the b loop, starting from i = len_trim(b) down to 2. For each i, check if current (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, change the previous (i-1) to opposite, increment a2.\n\nWait, in the code for b, the code in Java changes the previous character (i-1) when the current and previous are same. So in Fortran, when processing b, the code checks if b(i) == b(i-1). If so, then change b(i-1) to opposite, not the current. So the code in the loop for b is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 5 (string \"5\"). Then len_trim(s) is 1. So loops for a and b do not run. a1 and a2 are 0. The minimal is 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 11 (string \"11\"). Then len_trim(s) is 2.\n\nProcessing a:\n\ni=2: a(2) is '1', a(1) is '1'. So same. Change a(2) to '0', a1 becomes 1.\n\nProcessing b:\n\ni=2: check b(2) and b(1). They are '1's. So change b(1) to '0', a2 becomes 1.\n\nThus, min(1,1) is 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 101 (string \"101\").\n\nProcessing a:\n\ni=2: '0' vs '1' \u2192 no change.\n\ni=3: '1' vs '0' \u2192 no change. So a1 remains 0.\n\nProcessing b:\n\ni=3: '1' vs '0' \u2192 no change.\n\ni=2: '0' vs '1' \u2192 no change. So a2 remains 0. So min is 0.\n\nThus, output is 0.\n\nAnother case: first program's output is 111 (string \"111\").\n\nProcessing a:\n\ni=2: same as previous (1 and 1). Change to 0 \u2192 a becomes \"101\". a1=1.\n\ni=3: current is 1 (original third character was 1, but after first change, it's still 1? Wait, let's track step by step.\n\nWait, initial a is \"111\".\n\nProcessing i=2:\n\na(2) is '1', same as a(1). So change a(2) to '0', a becomes \"101\". a1=1.\n\nThen i=3:\n\na(3) is '1', a(2) is '0'. Not same. So no change. So a1 is 1.\n\nProcessing b:\n\nInitial b is \"111\".\n\nLoop from i=3 down to 2.\n\ni=3:\n\nCheck b(3) and b(2). Both '1's. So change b(2) to '0'. Now b is \"101\". a2 becomes 1.\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck b(2) (now '0') and b(1) (still '1'). Not same. So no change.\n\nThus, a2 is 1. So min(1,1)=1.\n\nThus, output is 1.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the character variables a and b are initialized to s. The write statement for s may have trailing spaces, but len_trim(s) will get the correct length.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The vectors array must be allocated properly. Since N and D are read first, the allocation is correct.\n\n- The loops for i and j in the first part are correct (i from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N).\n\n- The sqrt is computed as real(sum_dist), which is okay.\n\n- The conversion to string uses '(I0)', which should handle any integer.\n\n- The loops for a and b are correct.\n\nThus, the code should work."
