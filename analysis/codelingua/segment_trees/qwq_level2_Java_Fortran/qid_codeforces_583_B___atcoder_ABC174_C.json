    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_583_B. It reads integers from input until there's no more. For each test case (since it's in a while loop), it reads n followed by n numbers. Then it does some processing with arrays a and b, and variables s, tem, q. The loop runs until q equals n, incrementing s each time. The process alternates between going forward and backward through the array, checking if a[i] is <= q and b[i] is 0. When found, it marks b[i] as 1 and increases q. The output is s.\n\nThe second Java file, atcoder_ABC174_C, reads an integer K. It checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. If divisible by 7, divides by 7. Then multiplies by 9. Then finds the smallest ans where (10^ans mod K) == 1 mod K. The output is this ans, or -1 if conditions not met.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine these into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the s value, which is the input for the second program's K. Wait, no, actually, the first program's output is the s, which is then the input to the second program's K? Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first Java program's output (the printed s) is the input to the second Java program's K. So the second program takes that s as K, processes it, and outputs the answer. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (for the first Java program), process both steps, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's input is from stdin, and its output is s. The second Java program's input is K, which comes from the first's output. So in the original setup, the first program's output is piped into the second's input. So in the Fortran program, the first part must read the input for the first Java program, compute s, then use that s as K for the second part, compute the answer, and output that.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (the first part's input).\n2. Compute s as per the first Java program's logic.\n3. Use that s as K in the second Java program's logic.\n4. Output the result of the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must process both steps in sequence, with the first's output feeding into the second's input, all in memory without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst Java program's steps:\n\nRead n, then n integers into array a.\n\nInitialize array b (size n) to 0.\n\nInitialize s to -1, tem to 1, q to 0.\n\nLoop while q != n:\n\n   s +=1\n\n   if tem is 1 (first direction):\n\n      loop from i=0 to n-1:\n\n         if a[i] <= q and b[i] is 0:\n\n             set b[i] to 1, q +=1\n\n      set tem to 0\n\n   else (tem is 0, so direction is reverse):\n\n      loop from i = n-1 downto 0:\n\n         if a[i] <= q and b[i] is 0:\n\n             set b[i] to 1, q +=1\n\n      set tem to 1\n\nOnce q reaches n, output s.\n\nSo in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but in Java they are 0-based. Need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loops are from 0 to n-1, so in Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based arrays but adjust the indices accordingly. Let me think.\n\nLet me plan variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: n, a(n), b(n), s, tem, q, i, etc.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays need to be declared with fixed size, but here n is variable. So perhaps we need to read n first, then allocate arrays. But in Fortran, allocatable arrays can be used.\n\nSo steps for first part in Fortran:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nAllocate a(n), b(n).\n\nRead the n integers into a.\n\nInitialize b to 0.\n\nInitialize s = -1, tem = 1, q =0.\n\nLoop while q /=n:\n\n   s = s +1\n\n   if tem ==1 then:\n\n      do i=1, n\n\n         if (a(i) <= q .and. b(i) ==0) then\n\n             b(i) =1\n\n             q = q +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      tem =0\n\n   else:\n\n      do i =n,1,-1\n\n         if (a(i) <= q .and. b(i) ==0) then\n\n             b(i)=1\n\n             q = q +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      tem =1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nOnce done, s is the result of first part.\n\nThen, pass s to the second part's K.\n\nNow the second part's logic:\n\nSecond Java program's K is the s from first part.\n\nBut in the second Java program, K is read as input. So in the Fortran code, K is s.\n\nBut the second program's logic:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5: if yes, return -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7: if yes, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply by 9.\n\nThen find the smallest ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1 mod K.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K.\n\nLoop while remainder !=1:\n\n   ans +=1\n\n   remainder = (remainder *10) mod K\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, output -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7 \u2192 if yes, divide by 7.\n\nMultiply by 9 \u2192 new K is (K /7)*9 (if divisible by 7) or K*9 otherwise?\n\nWait, original code:\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7 \u2192 then K *=9 \u2192 so K becomes (K/7)*9.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen, if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K/7.\n\nThen K *=9.\n\nWait, so the K is modified here. So the new K is (original K divided by 7 if divisible by 7) then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but the problem says K is the input. So in the code, the K is modified. So the code's K is the input K, but after division by 7 (if applicable), then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, the code's K is the input variable. So the code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 returns -1.\n\nElse, if divisible by 7 \u2192 divide by 7, then multiply by 9.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nif (K % 2 ==0 || K%5 ==0) return -1;\n\nif (K%7 ==0) K /=7;\n\nK *=9;\n\nSo after that, K is (original K divided by 7 if divisible by 7) then multiplied by 9.\n\nWait, but the problem says K is the input. So the code is modifying K here. So the K used in the rest of the code is this modified value.\n\nWait, but the problem's second program's K is the input. So the code's K is the input, but after possible division by 7 and multiplied by 9. So the code's K is the modified value.\n\nWait, but the problem's second program's K is the input. So the code's K is the input variable, but after division by 7 (if applicable) and multiplied by 9. So the code's K is the modified value. So the rest of the code uses this modified K.\n\nWait, but the code's solve function returns the answer based on this modified K.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nSet K = s (from first part)\n\nif mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0 \u2192 output -1.\n\nElse:\n\n   if mod(K,7) ==0 then K = K/7\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   ans =1\n\n   remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n   while remainder /=1:\n\n      ans = ans +1\n\n      remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n   return ans\n\nWait, but in the code, the remainder is initialized as 10 mod K. Because in Java:\n\nremainder = 10 % K \u2192 which is mod(10, K).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, mod(10, K) is the same as 10 mod K.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function is mod(a,p) which gives a - p*floor(a/p). So same as Java's % when a and p are positive.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program must read the input for the first part (n and the array a), compute s, then compute the second part's answer based on s, then output that answer.\n\nNow, the first part's input is from stdin. The second part's input is s from first part. The final output is the second part's result.\n\nNow, in Fortran code structure:\n\nWe can have a program that reads the first part's input, processes it, then processes the second part, then outputs the result.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nprogram combined\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, s, K, ans, remainder, i, tem, q\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n! Read first part's input\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n))\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\n! Initialize variables for first part\n\nb = 0\n\ns = -1\n\ntem =1\n\nq =0\n\n! Process first part's loop\n\ndo while (q /=n)\n\n   s = s +1\n\n   if (tem ==1) then\n\n      do i=1, n\n\n         if (a(i) <= q .and. b(i) ==0) then\n\n             b(i) =1\n\n             q = q +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      tem =0\n\n   else\n\n      do i =n,1,-1\n\n         if (a(i) <= q .and. b(i) ==0) then\n\n             b(i)=1\n\n             q = q +1\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      tem =1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now compute second part using s as K\n\nK = s\n\n! Check if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 output -1\n\nif (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then\n\n   ans = -1\n\nelse\n\n   ! Check if divisible by 7\n\n   if (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n      K = K /7\n\n   end if\n\n   K = K *9\n\n   ans =1\n\n   remainder = mod(10, K)\n\n   do while (remainder /=1)\n\n      ans = ans +1\n\n      remainder = mod(remainder *10, K)\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\n! Output the ans\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\ndeallocate(a,b)\n\nend program combined\n\nWait, but let me check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, in the first part's loop, the indices in Fortran are 1-based. The original Java code uses 0-based arrays. So in the loops, the first part's code in Fortran is correct because the loops are from 1 to n and n downto 1. The a array is read correctly.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the a array is filled with the input numbers. The code in Fortran reads them as a(1) to a(n), which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's loop, the variables are correctly handled. The tem variable alternates between 1 and 0, controlling the direction.\n\nNow, for the second part:\n\nThe K is set to s (the first part's output). Then check if even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, ans is -1.\n\nElse, check if divisible by 7 \u2192 divide by 7, then multiply by 9.\n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by 7, K is multiplied by 9. So K becomes (original K divided by 7) *9.\n\nWait, in the code, after K is divided by 7 (if applicable), then K is multiplied by 9. So the code's K is modified here.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the remainder starts as mod(10, K). Then, in the loop, multiply by 10 each time mod K.\n\nWait, in the code, the remainder is initialized as 10 mod K. Then each step:\n\nremainder = (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nYes, which is exactly what the code does.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if K is 0? But in the first part, s is the number of steps taken until all elements are processed. Since n is at least 1 (since the loop runs while in.hasNext()), but in the first Java code, n is read from input. So in the first part, n can be 0? Probably not, since the problem's first code is for a programming competition problem, so n is a positive integer.\n\nBut in the second part, K is s. So if s is 0, but in the first part's code, s starts at -1 and increments each loop. The loop runs until q reaches n. So s will be at least 0? Let's see:\n\nInitially s is -1. The first iteration of the loop increments s to 0. Then the loop continues until q reaches n. So s will be at least 0. So K can be 0? Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=1, and a[0] is 0 (Java's 0-based). Then in first iteration (tem=1, first loop):\n\ni=0: a[0] (0) <= q (0) and b[0] is 0 \u2192 set b[0] to 1, q becomes 1. So after first iteration, q is 1 (n=1), so loop ends. s is 0. So K would be 0. Then in the second part, K is 0 \u2192 but in the first check, mod(0,2) is 0 \u2192 so returns -1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: K=7. Then after dividing by 7, K becomes 1, multiplied by 9 \u2192 9. Then find ans where 10^ans mod 9 ==1 mod9. 10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 ans is 1. So the code would return 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nK=7 \u2192 first part's s is 7? Wait, no, in this example, the first part's s would be whatever the first program's output is. Let me think of a test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output s is 7, then K=7. Then in the second part:\n\nCheck if 7 is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 no. Then check if divisible by7 \u2192 yes. So K becomes 1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen remainder starts as 10 mod9 \u2192 1. So remainder is 1 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So ans is 1. So the output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: K=7 \u2192 the code's second part returns 1.\n\nAnother example: K=3 (from first part's s=3). Then K is 3. Not divisible by 2 or5. Not divisible by7. So K remains 3, multiplied by9 \u2192 27.\n\nWait, no, wait: the code says if K is divisible by7, divide by7. So if K is 3, then no division. So K becomes 3*9=27.\n\nThen find the smallest ans where 10^ans mod27 =1 mod27.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n10^1 mod27 =10\n\n10^2 mod27 = 100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 19\n\n10^3 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 190-6*27=190-162=28 \u2192 28 mod27 is 1 \u2192 so ans=3.\n\nSo the code would return 3.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are correctly handled.\n\nNow, possible issues in code:\n\n- The first part's loop: the variables are correctly updated. The q is incremented inside the loops, but in Fortran, the loop over i runs from 1 to n, and for each i, if the condition is met, then b(i) is set to 1 and q is increased. Since q is a variable, this is okay. The loop over i is sequential, so in each iteration of the i loop, the q is updated, but the next i's check will use the updated q. Wait, but in the Java code, the for loops (forward and backward) process all elements in the current direction, and during that pass, the q is being increased. So in the Java code, during the for loop, the q is being modified, so the next elements in the same loop may have a higher q. That's correct, and the Fortran code does the same.\n\nAnother thing: in the first part's code, the b array is initialized to 0. In Fortran, when we allocate and set b=0, that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part's code:\n\nThe K is set to s. Then, if mod(K,2) is 0 or mod(K,5) is 0 \u2192 output -1.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nWait, but in the code, after K is divided by7 (if applicable), then multiplied by9. So the code's K is modified. So in the code, after the division, K is updated, then multiplied by9. So the code's K is the new value.\n\nYes, in the code:\n\nif (mod(K,7) ==0) then\n\n   K = K /7\n\nend if\n\nK = K *9\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the remainder is initialized as mod(10, K). Then in the loop, remainder is updated as (remainder *10) mod K.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the final output is ans, which is written with write(*,*) ans.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first part, when K is 0 (if s is 0). Let's see:\n\nSuppose n=1, a(1)=0. Then in first iteration (s starts at -1, so first loop iteration s becomes 0).\n\ntem is 1 (initially 1). So loop from i=1 to 1:\n\na(1) is 0 <= q (0) and b(1) is 0 \u2192 set b(1)=1, q becomes 1. So q equals n (1), so loop exits. s is 0.\n\nThen K is 0. So in the second part, mod(0,2) is 0 \u2192 so ans is -1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first part's s is 7 (so K=7). Then second part's code:\n\nCheck 7 is not even or divisible by5 \u2192 proceed. Since divisible by7 \u2192 K becomes 1. Multiply by9 \u2192 K=9.\n\nThen remainder is 10 mod9 \u21921 \u2192 so ans is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: first part's s is 3 (so K=3). Then second part:\n\n3 is not even or divisible by5. Not divisible by7. So K becomes 3*9=27. Then find ans where 10^ans mod27 =1 mod27. As before, ans is 3.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the first part's loop, the variables are correctly handled. The code uses do while (q /=n). The loop continues until q equals n.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo while (q /=n)\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code's variables:\n\nThe variables s, tem, q are integers. The arrays a and b are allocated.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the final Fortran program is as written above."
