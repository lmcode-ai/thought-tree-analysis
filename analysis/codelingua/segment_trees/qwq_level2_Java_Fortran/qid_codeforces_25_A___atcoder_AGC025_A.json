So for a=123:\n\nLoop runs when a is 123 (>=10), add 3, a becomes 12. Again, a=12 >=10: add 2, a becomes 1. Loop ends. Then add a (1) to ans. So total 3+2+1 =6.

Then loop stops, add 9. Total 27. So the sum is the sum of all digits. So the function is correct. In Fortran, to compute the sum of digits of a number, we can write a function:\n\nFUNCTION sum_digits(a) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n  INTEGER :: res, temp, digit\n  temp = a\n  res = 0\n  DO\n    digit = MOD(temp,10)\n    res = res + digit\n    temp = temp /10 IF (temp <10) EXIT\n  END DO\n  res = res + temp  ! add the remaining part (since temp is now less than 10)\nEND FUNCTION sum_digits\n\nWait, but let's test with a=123:\n\ntemp starts as 123. First iteration: digit=3, res=3, temp becomes 12. Since 12 >=10, loop continues. Second iteration: digit=2, res=5, temp becomes 1. Now temp is 1 <10, so exit loop. Then add temp (1) to res: total 6.

Alternatively, A=9 and 90 \u2192 sum(9)=9, sum(90)=9 \u2192 total 18. Hmm, but the minimal is 18?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_25_A) reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. It counts the number of even and odd numbers, and then outputs the index of the single even or odd number if one is different. Wait, actually, it's checking which count is smaller. Because if there are more odds, then the even count is smaller, so it prints the even's index, and vice versa. So the output is the position (1-based) of the unique even or odd element.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, computes the minimal sum of the digits of A and N-A for A from 1 to N/2 (or (N+1)/2 if N is odd). The sum function here adds all the digits of a number until it's a single digit? Wait no, the sum function adds all digits of the number, even if it's more than one digit. Wait, let me check the code again. The sum function loops while a is >=10, adding the last digit each time, then adds the remaining a. So for example, if a is 123, sum is 1+2+3 =6. Wait no, the loop adds a%10 (3, then 2, then 1) but when a becomes 1 (since 123/10 is 12, then 12/10 is 1, so the loop stops when a is 1, then adds 1. So total 3+2+1+1? Wait no, let me see:\n\nWait, the code for sum(a):\n\nint ans =0;\n\nwhile a >=10:\n\nans += a%10\n\na = a /10\n\nthen after loop, add a to ans.\n\nSo for a=123:\n\nLoop runs when a is 123 (>=10), add 3, a becomes 12.\n\nAgain, a=12 >=10: add 2, a becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends. Then add a (1) to ans. So total 3+2+1 =6. So yes, the sum is the sum of all digits of a.\n\nThe second program's main function: it reads N, computes n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2. Then initializes ans as sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then loops A from 1 to n, and for each A, computes sum(A) + sum(N-A), and if that's less than current ans, updates ans. Finally, prints ans.\n\nSo the first program's output is an integer (the index of the unique even/odd element), which is then the input to the second program's N.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program, process it, get the index, then use that index as N for the second program, process that, and output the final result.\n\nNow, translating this into a single Fortran program.\n\nFirst, the first part: read n and array, compute the index.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so that's good. Let's see:\n\nFirst, read n from input. Then read n integers into an array (starting at 1, since in Java it's 1-based). Then count evens and odds, track their indices.\n\nInitialize variables: odd_count, even_count, odd_ind, even_ind. Initialize them to 0. Then loop from 1 to n:\n\nif array(i) is even, increment even_count and set even_ind to i. Else, same for odd.\n\nThen, after the loop, decide which is the smaller count. If odd_count > even_count, then the even is the unique one, so output even_ind. Else, output odd_ind. But in Fortran, the first program's output is the input to the second, so in the Fortran code, this index will be stored as N for the second part.\n\nWait, but in the original Java sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output is an integer, which is the N for the second program. So in the Fortran program, after processing the first part, we need to take that result (the index) as N for the second part.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n and array.\n\n2. Compute the index (even_ind or odd_ind) as per first program.\n\n3. Use that index as N for the second part.\n\n4. Compute the second part's answer based on N.\n\n5. Output the final answer.\n\nNow, translating the second part into Fortran.\n\nThe second part's function sum(a) is straightforward: sum all digits of a until it's a single digit? Wait no, the sum function in Java adds all digits of a, regardless of how many digits. Wait, the code for sum(a) is:\n\nint ans =0;\n\nwhile (a >=10) {\n\nans += a%10;\n\na = a /10;\n\n}\n\nans += a;\n\nSo for a= 999, the loop runs when a is 999 (adds 9, a becomes 99), then again (adds 9, a becomes 9). Then loop stops, add 9. Total 27. So the sum is the sum of all digits. So the function is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, to compute the sum of digits of a number, we can write a function:\n\nFUNCTION sum_digits(a) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n  INTEGER :: res, temp, digit\n  temp = a\n  res = 0\n  DO\n    digit = MOD(temp,10)\n    res = res + digit\n    temp = temp /10\n    IF (temp <10) EXIT\n  END DO\n  res = res + temp  ! add the remaining part (since temp is now less than 10)\nEND FUNCTION sum_digits\n\nWait, but let's test with a=123:\n\ntemp starts as 123.\n\nFirst iteration: digit=3, res=3, temp becomes 12. Since 12 >=10, loop continues.\n\nSecond iteration: digit=2, res=5, temp becomes 1. Now temp is 1 <10, so exit loop. Then add temp (1) to res: total 6. Correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, the second part's main code:\n\nRead N (which is the index from first part). Wait no, in the Fortran program, the first part's output is stored as N for the second part. So in the Fortran code, after the first part, the variable (say, index) is the N for the second part.\n\nThen compute n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nif (N %2 ==0) n = N/2 else n=(N+1)/2.\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, but need to be careful. Since in Fortran, 5/2 is 2, so for N odd, (N+1)/2 would be (5+1)/2=3, which is correct.\n\nThen, initialize ans as sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncompute current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A). If this is less than ans, set ans to current_sum.\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nPutting it all together in Fortran:\n\nThe entire program must read the input for the first part, process it, then process the second part using the first's output, and output the second's result.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nFirst part variables:\n\ninteger :: n, array(100000) (assuming n can be up to some limit, but in Java it's n+1 array, but in Fortran, we can use dynamic arrays? Wait, no, in Fortran 90, we can use allocatable arrays. But perhaps the first program's n is read first, then allocate array. Alternatively, since in the first Java code, the array is size n+1, but indices 1 to n are used. So in Fortran, perhaps declare array as dimension(n), but need to read n first.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can read n first, then allocate an array of size n. Let's see:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, index, N, ans, A, temp_n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n! First part:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(array(n))\n\nread(*,*) (array(i), i=1,n)\n\ninteger :: odd_count =0, even_count=0, odd_ind=0, even_ind=0\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   if (mod(array(i),2) ==0) then\n\n      even_count = even_count +1\n\n      even_ind = i\n\n   else\n\n      odd_count = odd_count +1\n\n      odd_ind = i\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (odd_count > even_count) then\n\n   index = even_ind\n\nelse\n\n   index = odd_ind\n\nend if\n\n! Now, second part:\n\nN = index\n\n! Compute n for the second part:\n\nif (mod(N,2) ==0) then\n\n   temp_n = N/2\n\nelse\n\n   temp_n = (N+1)/2\n\nend if\n\nans = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\ndo A=1, temp_n\n\n   integer :: current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans) then\n\n      ans = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\ncontains\n\nFUNCTION sum_digits(a) RESULT(res)\n\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n\n  INTEGER :: res, temp, digit\n\n  temp = a\n\n  res =0\n\n  DO\n\n    digit = MOD(temp,10)\n\n    res = res + digit\n\n    temp = temp /10\n\n    IF (temp <10) EXIT\n\n  END DO\n\n  res = res + temp\n\nEND FUNCTION sum_digits\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for the sum_digits function, the loop is a DO loop without an explicit condition. Let me check:\n\nWait, the loop is:\n\nDO\n\n   digit = MOD(temp,10)\n\n   res += digit\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\n   if temp <10, exit\n\nEND DO\n\nThen add temp to res.\n\nWait, the loop continues until temp is less than 10. So the loop runs as long as temp is >=10. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, in the function:\n\ntemp starts as a.\n\nInside the loop:\n\ndigit = MOD(temp,10) \u2192 adds the last digit.\n\ntemp = temp /10 \u2192 removes the last digit.\n\nCheck if temp <10 \u2192 if yes, exit loop. So the loop stops when temp is a single digit. Then, after the loop, add that remaining temp (the first digit now) to res.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, in the second part's loop over A from 1 to temp_n:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for A from 1 to n (where n is N/2 or (N+1)/2). So in Fortran, the loop is A=1 to temp_n.\n\nThe current_sum is sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A). If that is less than ans, then ans is updated.\n\nThe initial ans is sum(1) + sum(N-1). Which is the same as in Java.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn the first part, after computing index, that's N for the second part.\n\nThe code should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the first part, the array is allocated as size n, but in the Java code, the array was 1-based with size n+1, but the loop runs from 1 to n. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based (since we read (array(i), i=1,n)), so that's correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nSuppose in first part, n=1. Then the array has one element. The counts would be either 1 even or 1 odd. Since odd_count (1) > even_count (0), so index is even_ind (0?), but wait in the code, even_ind is initialized to 0. Wait, in the Java code, for n=1, the loop runs once. Suppose the element is even: then even_count becomes 1, even_ind is 1. So the code would output even_ind (1) since even_count (1) is not less than odd_count (0). Wait, the condition is if (odd > even) \u2192 print even_ind. So if n=1 and the element is even, then even_count is 1, odd_count 0. So since odd_count (0) is less than even_count (1), so the condition is false, so it prints odd_ind (0?), but that's wrong.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the code for the first program:\n\nif (odd > even) \u2192 print even_ind else print odd_ind.\n\nWait, when there are more odds, then the even is the unique one, so even_ind is the correct index. But in the case where n=1 and the element is even, then even_count is 1, odd_count 0. So even_count is larger, so the condition is false, so it prints odd_ind. But odd_ind is 0, which is wrong. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the code for the first program:\n\nfor each element, if even, even_count and even_ind are updated. Else, odd_count and odd_ind.\n\nSo for n=1, and the element is even:\n\neven_count is 1, even_ind is 1.\n\nodd_count is 0, odd_ind is 0.\n\nThe condition is if (odd_count > even_count \u2192 0>1 \u2192 false \u2192 else clause: print odd_ind (0). But that's wrong. The correct output should be 1.\n\nAh, so there's a bug in the original Java code?\n\nWait, the problem statement for the first program is to find the position of the unique even or odd. So when all but one are even or odd. Wait, but in the case of n=1, there is only one element, so it's the unique one. So the code should output its index (1). But according to the code, when n=1 and the element is even, the code would print odd_ind (0), which is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the original Java code has a bug here. Because in the case where all elements are even except one, but when n=1, the code would have even_count=1, odd_count=0. So the condition is odd_count (0) > even_count (1) \u2192 false, so it prints odd_ind (0). Which is wrong. So the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the problem expects that when all elements are even except one, then the unique is the odd, but in n=1, the element is even, so the unique even is itself, so the code should output its index. But the code is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code counts the number of evens and odds. The unique element is the one with the smaller count. Because if there are more evens, then the odd is the unique one. If there are more odds, the even is unique. So when counts are equal, but that's only possible when n is even, but in the problem, perhaps the input ensures that there is exactly one differing element. But in the case of n=1, the counts are 1 and 0. So the smaller count is 0 (even or odd?), so the code's logic is: if odd_count > even_count \u2192 then even is the unique (so print even_ind). Else, print odd_ind.\n\nWait, in the case of n=1 and the element is even:\n\neven_count is 1, odd_count 0. So even_count is larger. So the condition is false \u2192 print odd_ind (0). Which is wrong. So the code is incorrect here.\n\nAh, so the code has a bug. But since the user provided the code, I have to translate it as is, even if it's wrong. So in the Fortran code, I must replicate the same logic, even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, when n=1 and the element is even, the code will output 0, which is wrong, but that's what the original code does. So I have to follow that.\n\nSo the code is correct as per the given Java code.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables even_ind and odd_ind are initialized to 0. So in the case where all elements are even, then even_count is n, and even_ind is the last even element's index. But the code would print the even_ind only if the odd_count is larger, which it isn't. So the code would print the odd_ind (0), which is wrong. But that's the original code's behavior.\n\nSo the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nNow, in the second part, when N is 0 (from first part's error), but that's possible only if the first part's output is 0, which would be when the first program's code returns 0. But in the first program, the index is either even_ind or odd_ind, which can be 0 only if no even or odd elements were found. But in the first program, since all elements are read, at least one must be even or odd. Wait, except if n=0? But n is read from input, so probably the problem ensures n>=1.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, n is read from input, but if n is 0, then the array is size 1 (since new int[n+1], but then the loop runs from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute. Then even and odd counts are 0, so the code would print 0. But that's probably an invalid input. But the code may not handle that. But since the user provided the code, we have to translate it as is.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are properly initialized.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the first part, after reading n, the array is allocated as array(n). Then read the elements from 1 to n. The loop over i=1 to n.\n\nThen, the variables odd_count, even_count, etc. are initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the second part:\n\nAfter computing N = index (the first program's output), then compute temp_n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to temp_n.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int A=1; A <=n; A++). So in Fortran, the loop is A=1 to temp_n inclusive.\n\nThe code in Fortran should be okay.\n\nNow, the sum_digits function is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code, the variables:\n\nIn the first part, after the loop, index is set to even_ind or odd_ind.\n\nThen N is set to index.\n\nThen compute temp_n as N/2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nThen ans is initialized to sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to temp_n:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\nif current_sum < ans \u2192 update ans.\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the code, the variables:\n\nIn the second part, the variables A is declared in the loop, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. Wait, in the loop:\n\ndo A=1, temp_n\n\n   integer :: current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans) then\n\n      ans = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, the line \"integer :: current_sum = ...\" declares current_sum inside the loop. But in Fortran, variable declarations must be at the beginning of a scope. So that's invalid syntax.\n\nAh, right. So I need to declare current_sum before the loop.\n\nSo, in the second part:\n\ninteger :: current_sum\n\nans = sum_digits(1) + sum_digits(N-1)\n\ndo A=1, temp_n\n\n   current_sum = sum_digits(A) + sum_digits(N - A)\n\n   if (current_sum < ans) then\n\n      ans = current_sum\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThat's better.\n\nAlso, in the first part, the variables odd_count, even_count, etc. need to be declared.\n\nIn the first part:\n\ninteger :: odd_count, even_count, odd_ind, even_ind\n\nodd_count =0; even_count=0; odd_ind=0; even_ind=0\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nodd_count = 0\n\neven_count =0\n\nodd_ind =0\n\neven_ind =0\n\nYes.\n\nPutting all together, the code should look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, index, N, ans, A, temp_n, current_sum\n\ninteger, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n!

Wait, in the code above, after the first read, the variables are declared as:\n\ninteger :: odd_count =0, even_count=0, odd_ind=0, even_ind=0\n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. So the code as written has the declarations after the read statements, which is invalid.\n\nAh, right. So the variables must be declared at the top.\n\nSo the program's variables should be declared at the start.\n\nLet me restructure the code properly.\n\nThe program should have all variables declared at the beginning.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, index, N, ans, A, temp_n, current_sum\n\ninteger :: odd_count, even_count, odd_ind, even_ind\n\ninteger, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n!

The loop variable i is declared as integer.\n\nWait, in the first part, the loop variable i is declared as integer :: i. That's okay.\n\nNow, this should be correct.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nFirst, let's test the first part.\n\nSample input for first program:\n\nInput 1:\n\n3\n\n2 4 7\n\nThe array is [2,4,7]. The evens are 2 and 4 (indices 1 and 2), so even_count=2, odd_count=1. So since even_count > odd_count, the code will choose the odd_ind (3). So the output is 3. Then the second program uses N=3.\n\nSecond program with N=3:\n\nCompute temp_n: 3 is odd \u2192 (3+1)/2 =2.\n\nans starts as sum(1) + sum(2). sum(1)=1, sum(2)=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nLoop A from 1 to 2:\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(2) \u2192 3 \u2192 same as ans, no change.\n\nA=2: sum(2)+sum(1) \u2192 same 3.\n\nSo the answer is 3. So the final output is 3.\n\nWait, but let's see what the second program does for N=3.\n\nThe minimal sum is 3, so the output is 3.\n\nAnother test case for first program:\n\nInput 1:\n\n1\n\n5 \u2192 the element is odd. So odd_count=1, even_count=0. Since odd_count>even_count, the code outputs even_ind (0). So N=0. Then the second program would have N=0, which is problematic. But perhaps the problem ensures that the first program's output is a valid N for the second program. But in this case, the second program would have N=0, which would cause issues. But since the user's code may not handle that, but the Fortran code must replicate it.\n\nAnother test case for first program:\n\nInput 2:\n\n2\n\n2 4 \u2192 both even. So even_count=2, odd_count=0. So since even_count is larger, the code outputs the odd_ind (0). So N=0 again.\n\nHmm, but the second program with N=0 would have issues. But the code must proceed as per the original.\n\nAnother test case where first program's output is correct:\n\nInput 1:\n\n4\n\n2 4 6 5 \u2192 evens are 3, odd is 1. So even_count=3, odd_count=1. So since even_count>odd_count, the code outputs the odd_ind (4). So N=4.\n\nSecond program with N=4:\n\ntemp_n is 4/2=2.\n\nans starts as sum(1)+sum(3) \u2192 sum(1)=1, sum(3)=3 \u2192 total 4.\n\nLoop A from 1 to 2:\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(3)=4 \u2192 same as ans.\n\nA=2: sum(2)+sum(2)=2+2=4 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better split. Let's see:\n\nWait, for N=4, the possible A values are 1 and 2.\n\nA=1: 1 and 3 \u2192 sum 1+3=4.\n\nA=2: 2 and 2 \u2192 sum 2+2=4.\n\nSo the minimal is 4. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case for second program:\n\nN=99:\n\nThe minimal sum is achieved at A=50, 49 \u2192 sum(50) is 5+0=5, sum(49)=4+9=13 \u2192 total 18? Or maybe another split.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is when A=11 and 88 \u2192 sum(11)=2, sum(88)=16 \u2192 total 18. Or maybe A=50 and 49 gives 5+4+9= 5+13=18.\n\nAlternatively, A=9 and 90 \u2192 sum(9)=9, sum(90)=9 \u2192 total 18.\n\nHmm, but the minimal is 18?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is 18. So the code would compute that.\n\nBut regardless, the code should work as per the original.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be correct."
