    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC178_A. It reads an integer x from input. Then it sets a boolean bool to true if x is 1, else false. The result is 1 if bool is false, else 0. So basically, the result is 1 when x is not 1, and 0 when x is 1. Wait, let me see: the code says result = !bool ? 1 : 0. So if bool is true (x is 1), then !bool is false, so the result is 0. If x is not 1, then bool is false, so !bool is true, so result is 1. So the output is 1 when x !=1, 0 when x=1. So the first program's output is 1 or 0 based on x.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC172_D, takes an integer n from input. Then it calculates ans as a sum over i from 1 to n of i multiplied by (n divided by i) times (n divided by i +1) divided by 2. Wait, let me parse that formula again. The formula inside the loop is (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1)/2. So for each i, compute (n//i) which is integer division, then that value plus 1, multiply those two terms, multiply by i, then add all those terms for each i from 1 to n. The sum is stored in ans, which is printed at the end.\n\nSo the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the overall process is: take x as input, compute result (0 or 1) from first program, then that result is the n for the second program, which computes the sum and outputs that.\n\nNow, the task is to write a single Fortran program that does the same. The key points are:\n\n- The first Java program reads input, so in Fortran, the first part must read from stdin.\n- The second Java program's input is the output of the first, so in Fortran, we need to compute the intermediate value (the result of first program) and pass it to the second's computation without I/O in between.\n- The final output is the result of the second program's calculation.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read x from input.\n2. Compute the first program's result (0 or 1 based on x).\n3. Use that result as n in the second program's calculation.\n4. Output the final answer from the second program.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part: the first Java program's logic.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nx is an integer. The first program's result is an integer (0 or 1). Let's call that intermediate variable 'result'.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead x from input. Then compute result = 0 if x ==1 else 1. So in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) x\nif (x == 1) then\n   result = 0\nelse\n   result = 1\nend if\n\nAlternatively, can write it as a one-liner: result = merge(0,1, x ==1). Because merge selects first value if condition is true. Wait, merge(a,b,mask) returns a where mask is true, else b. So if x is 1, then condition is true, so 0. Else 1. So yes, that works.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nSecond part: the second Java program's logic. The second program takes n (which here is the 'result' variable from first step) and computes the sum.\n\nThe second program's loop is from i=1 to n (inclusive). For each i, compute term = i * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2. Then sum all terms.\n\nWait, in Java, the variables are long, so in Fortran, we can use integer*8 (or selected_int_kind) to handle large numbers, but maybe in the problem constraints, the input x is small enough that the result (0 or 1) would make n either 0 or 1. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the first program's output is either 0 or 1, so the second program's n is either 0 or 1. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the result variable. So if x is 1, then result is 0. So the second program's n is 0. If x is not 1, then result is 1, so n is 1.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Because the second program's input n can only be 0 or 1. Let me see what the second program does in those cases.\n\nLet me compute for n=0 and n=1.\n\nCase n=0:\n\nThe loop runs from i=1 to 0? Wait, in Java, the for loop is for (int i=1; i < n+1; i++). So when n is 0, the loop runs from 1 to 0+1=1, so i from 1 to 1. So i=1.\n\nThen term for i=1:\n\ni=1, n=0.\n\n(n/i) is 0 divided by 1, which is 0. So term is 1 * 0 * (0+1)/2 \u2192 1 *0 *1/2 \u2192 0. So the sum is 0. So the output would be 0.\n\nWait, but let me compute step by step:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni=1:\n\nterm = 1 * (0//1) * ( (0//1)+1 ) /2 \u2192 1 *0 * (0+1)/2 \u2192 0 * 1 \u2192 0. So ans +=0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nThus, the total is 0.\n\nCase n=1:\n\nLoop runs from i=1 to 1.\n\ni=1:\n\nterm =1 * (1//1) * (1+1)/2 \u2192 1 *1 * 2/2 \u2192 1*1*1 \u21921. So ans is 1.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 1 when n=1, 0 when n=0.\n\nWait, but let me check the code again. The formula in Java is:\n\nans += (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1) / 2;\n\nWait, the division is integer division. So for n=1 and i=1, (n/i) is 1. So (1) * (1+1)/2 \u2192 2/2 =1. So 1*1*1 =1. So yes, ans is 1.\n\nSo the second program's output is 1 when n=1, 0 when n=0.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence's output is:\n\nIf the first program's input x is 1 \u2192 result is 0 \u2192 second program's output is 0.\n\nIf x is not 1 \u2192 result is 1 \u2192 second program's output is 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the entire sequence's output is 0 when x is 1, and 1 otherwise. Wait, but that's exactly the same as the first program's output. Wait, no. Wait first program's output is 0 when x is 1, and 1 otherwise. The second program's output when n is 0 (from first program's 0) is 0, and when n is 1 (from first program's 1) is 1. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. Wait, that's a surprise. So the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. Because the second program's output is exactly the first program's result. So why chain them?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, first program's output is result (0 or 1). The second program takes that as n and computes the sum. Let me see:\n\nSuppose x is 2. Then first program's result is 1. Then second program's n is 1. The second program's output is 1. So the final output is 1, which is same as first program's result.\n\nIf x is 1, first program's result is 0. Second program's output is 0. So same as first program's result.\n\nWait, so the entire sequence's output is exactly the same as the first program's output. That's strange. So why are there two programs here? Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's calculation. Let me re-calculate for n=1 again.\n\nWait, the second program's code:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nLoop i from 1 to n (since n is 1 here).\n\ni=1:\n\nterm = i * (n/i) * ( (n/i)+1 ) /2.\n\nn/i is 1/1 =1.\n\nSo term is 1 *1 * (1+1)/2 \u2192 1 *1 * 2/2 \u2192 1*1*1 \u21921. So ans becomes 1.\n\nThus, the second program's output is 1 when n=1, which is the same as the first program's result (1). So the final output is same as first program's result.\n\nWait, so the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. So why chain two programs? That's odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me check the second Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code:\n\nThe loop is for (int i=1; i < n+1; i++), so i runs from 1 to n inclusive.\n\nThe term is (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (((long)n/(long)i)+1)/2.\n\nWait, the division is integer division. So for n=1 and i=1, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the formula is different. Let me see:\n\nThe term is i multiplied by (n//i) multiplied by ( (n//i)+1 ) divided by 2. So the formula is i * (k) * (k+1)/2, where k = n//i.\n\nWait, but the division by 2 is integer division? Because in Java, when you do integer division, like (a * b)/2, it truncates. But in the code, the variables are cast to long, so it's integer division.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=1, the term is 1 *1 * (2)/2 \u2192 1*1*1 \u21921. So yes, correct.\n\nHmm, so the second program's output is exactly the same as the first program's result. So the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. So why chain them? That's confusing. Maybe the problem is a mistake, but perhaps I need to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me check again.\n\nFirst Java program:\n\nresult = !bool ? 1 : 0;\n\nbool is true when x is 1. So when x is 1, !bool is false \u2192 result is 0. When x is not 1, !bool is true \u2192 result is 1. So the first program's output is 0 when x is 1, else 1.\n\nSecond program's output when n is 0 (from first program's 0) is 0. When n is 1 (from first program's 1) is 1. So the final output is same as first program's output. So the entire sequence is equivalent to the first program. So the second program is redundant here. But the user provided both, so I have to translate them as per the given code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read x, compute the first's result, then compute the second's calculation with that result as n, then output the second's result.\n\nEven though the result is the same, the code must be written as per the given Java programs.\n\nSo now, to write the Fortran code.\n\nThe steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read x from input.\n\n2. Compute result = 0 if x ==1 else 1.\n\n3. Compute the second program's calculation with n=result.\n\n4. Output the final answer.\n\nNow, the second program's calculation requires a loop from i=1 to n (which is either 0 or 1). Wait, but when n is 0, the loop runs from 1 to 0, which in Fortran would not execute. Let me see.\n\nIn Fortran, a loop like do i=1, n would not execute if n <1. So for n=0, the loop doesn't run, so ans remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code steps for the second part:\n\nInitialize ans =0.\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   k = n / i\n\n   term = i * k * (k +1) / 2\n\n   ans = ans + term\n\nend do\n\nThen print ans.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division is done with /, but when using integers, it truncates. So that's correct.\n\nBut variables need to be declared. Let's see:\n\nVariables:\n\nx: integer (input)\n\nresult: integer (0 or 1)\n\nn: same as result (so integer)\n\nans: integer (or maybe long, but since n is 0 or 1, the maximum ans is 1, so integer is sufficient).\n\nWait, let's see for n=1, the term is 1*1*(2)/2 =1. So ans is 1. So integer is okay.\n\nThus, variables can be declared as integers.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: x, result, n, ans, i, k\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) x\n\n  ! Compute first program's result\n  if (x ==1) then\n     result =0\n  else\n     result =1\n  end if\n\n  ! Now compute second program's part\n  n = result\n  ans =0\n\n  do i=1, n\n     k = n / i\n     ans = ans + i * k * (k +1)/2\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the final ans\n  print*, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but let's test with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: x=1.\n\nFirst program's result is 0. So n=0.\n\nLoop from i=1 to 0 \u2192 no iterations. ans remains 0. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: x=2.\n\nFirst program's result is 1. n=1.\n\nLoop i=1:\n\nk =1/1 =1.\n\nterm =1 *1*(2)/2 \u21921*1*1=1. ans becomes 1. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=0.\n\nFirst program's result is 1 (since x is not 1). So n=1. Same as above, output 1.\n\nAnother test case: x=3 \u2192 result is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the code works as expected.\n\nNow, check if the code is correct. The variables are declared properly. The loop is handled correctly. The division is integer division. The term calculation is correct.\n\nYes, this should work. So the final Fortran program is as above."
