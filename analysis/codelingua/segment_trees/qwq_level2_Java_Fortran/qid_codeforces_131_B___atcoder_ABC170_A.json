So for example, if the input numbers are 1, 2, 3, then the cnt array would have cnt[11], cnt[12], cnt[13] each incremented by 1. The rest are zero. So for i from 0 to 9, the terms would be cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i]. For i=0, 20-0=20, so cnt[0] (which is 0) * cnt[20] (which is 0?), so that term is 0. Similarly, for i=1, 20-1=19, which is also 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_131_B. It reads an integer n, then n integers. It counts the occurrences of each number in an array cnt of size 21, but shifted by +10 so that numbers from -10 to 10 are covered. Then it calculates a result by summing products of cnt[i] and cnt[20 - i] for i from 0 to 9, plus the combination of cnt[10] choose 2. The output is this res value.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC170_A, reads a line of space-separated numbers. It counts how many non-zero numbers there are until it hits a zero, then outputs that count. So if the input is like \"1 2 3 0 4\", it would count 3 because after the zero, it stops.\n\nNow, the key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the first program's output (res) is the input for the second. But in the Fortran program, I need to chain them without I/O in the middle.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (the initial n and n numbers), process them through the first algorithm, then take the result (res) and use that as the input for the second algorithm. The second algorithm then counts the number of non-zero elements until a zero is encountered in that res value's digits? Wait, no. Wait, the second Java program's input is a list of numbers separated by spaces. The first program's output is a single number, right? Because the first Java program's output is System.out.println(res). So the output of the first program is a single integer, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a list of numbers. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the second Java program's input is a line of space-separated numbers. So the first program's output is a single number, which would be the input for the second program. But the second program would read that as a single number, then split into an array. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program would read \"123\" as the input line, split into [\"123\"], then count 1 (since it's non-zero, and there's no zero, so the loop adds 1 and since the next element is beyond the array, it stops). Wait, but the second program's code is:\n\nfor each string in the input array, increment result by 1, but if the string is \"0\", break. So if the input is a single number like 123, then the array has one element \"123\", which is not \"0\", so the result is 1. If the first program's output is 0, then the second program would output 1? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first program outputs 0. Then the second program's input is \"0\", so the array is [\"0\"], so the loop runs once: str is \"0\", so add 1, then break. So the result is 1. Wait, but the code says \"if \"0\".equals(str) break\". So the first element is \"0\", so the loop adds 1, then breaks. So the result is 1. Hmm, but if the input is \"0 5\", then the first element is \"0\", so the result is 1 (since it breaks after adding 1). Wait, but the input array would be [\"0\", \"5\"], but the loop would process \"0\" first, add 1, then break, so the total is 1. So the second program counts the number of elements until a zero is found, including the zero? Or not? Wait, the code is: for each string in the array, add 1, then if the string is \"0\", break. So the count includes the zero. So if the input is \"0\", the count is 1. If the input is \"1 0 2\", the count is 2 (1 and 0, then break). \n\nBut the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is that number as a string. So the second program will split that into a single-element array. So the result is 1 unless the number is zero, in which case it's 1 as well. Wait, but if the first program's output is, say, 100, then the second program's input is \"100\", so the array is [\"100\"], so the count is 1. If the first program outputs 0, then the count is 1. Wait, but the second program's code would process the \"0\" and add 1, then break. So the result is 1 in all cases except when the input is empty? Wait, but the first program's output is always a number, so the input to the second program is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1, unless the first program's output is zero, in which case it's also 1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second Java program's input. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the second Java program's input is a line of space-separated numbers. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which is split into [\"123\"], so the count is 1. If the first program outputs 0, then the input is \"0\", so the count is 1. If the first program outputs 10, then the count is 1. So the second program's output is always 1, except when the first program's output is a number that has a zero in its digits? Wait no, because the input is a single number. The second program is expecting a list of numbers, but the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is a single number, so the count is 1 unless that number is zero, in which case it's also 1. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a number, but when passed as input to the second program, it's treated as a sequence of digits? No, that's not how the second program works. The second program reads a line of input, splits it into tokens separated by spaces, and counts how many non-zero elements until a zero is encountered. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which is a single token. So the count is 1. If the first program outputs 0, then the input is \"0\", so the count is 1. If the first program outputs 100, then the count is 1. So the second program's output is always 1, except when the first program's output is a number that is zero, but even then it's 1. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second program's purpose. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nLooking at the second Java code:\n\nThe code reads a line, splits into input_array. Then initializes result to 0. Then for each string in input_array, adds 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", break. So the loop stops when a \"0\" is found. So the count is the number of elements until (and including) the first zero. So for example, if the input is \"5 0 3\", the count is 2 (5 and 0). If the input is \"0\", the count is 1. If the input is \"1 2 3\", the count is 3. If the input is \"0 1 2\", the count is 1. \n\nBut in our case, the first program's output is a single number. So the second program's input is a single number. So the input array has one element. So the count is 1 unless that element is \"0\", in which case it's 1 as well. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if the first program outputs 0, then the input array is [\"0\"], so the loop adds 1, then breaks. So the result is 1. If the first program outputs 123, then the array is [\"123\"], so the loop adds 1, and since it's not zero, it continues, but there are no more elements. So the result is 1. So in all cases, the second program's output is 1. That's strange. That would mean that the second program's output is always 1, which is probably not the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first program's output. Let me check the first program again.\n\nWait, the first program's code is:\n\nres += (cnt[10] * (cnt[10] -1))/2;\n\nSo the res is the total of the products for i from 0 to 9 of cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i], plus the combination of cnt[10] choose 2. So the output is res, which is a number. So the second program's input is that number as a single token. So the second program's output is always 1, unless the first program's output is zero, in which case it's also 1. Wait, so the second program's output is always 1? That can't be right. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the first program's output is a list of numbers? Let me check the first Java code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's code: it reads n, then n integers. Then it counts the occurrences in cnt array. Then computes res as the sum, and prints res. So the output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that single integer. So the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1. That's odd. Unless the first program's output is a list of numbers, but no, the first program's code ends with System.out.println(res), so it's a single number. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the problem description. Wait, the user says that the Java programs are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's input is the first's output. So if the first outputs 123, then the second's input is \"123\", which is a single number. So the second program's output is 1. Unless the first program's output is zero, then it's also 1. So the final output is always 1? That seems odd, but perhaps that's the case. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of an example. Suppose the first program's input is n=3 and the numbers 1, 2, 3. Then the cnt array would have counts for 11, 12, 13 (since the numbers are added 10). Wait, the code in the first Java program is scan.nextInt() +10. So for each input number x, it's stored in cnt[x+10]. So for example, if the input number is 1, then it's stored in cnt[11], etc. \n\nThe res is calculated as the sum over i from 0 to 9 of cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i]. Let's see, for i=0, 20 -i is 20, so cnt[0] * cnt[20]. But the numbers in the input can be from -10 to 10, since when you add 10, the indices go from 0 to 20. So for example, if the input numbers are 1, 2, 3, then the cnt array would have cnt[11], cnt[12], cnt[13] each incremented by 1. The rest are zero. So for i from 0 to 9, the terms would be cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i]. For i=0, 20-0=20, so cnt[0] (which is 0) * cnt[20] (which is 0?), so that term is 0. Similarly, for i=1, 20-1=19, which is also 0. So all terms from i=0 to 9 would be zero. Then the second part is (cnt[10] choose 2). Since cnt[10] is the count of numbers equal to 0 (since 0+10=10). In this example, there are no zeros, so cnt[10] is 0, so that term is 0. So the total res is 0. Then the second program would take 0 as input, so the output is 1. \n\nAnother example: if the first program's output is 5, then the second program's output is 1. \n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output can be a multi-digit number, but the second program treats it as a single number. So the second program's output is always 1. That's strange. Unless the first program's output is a list of numbers separated by spaces. Wait, no, the first program's code ends with System.out.println(res), so it's a single integer. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the second Java program is supposed to read the first program's output as a list of numbers, but that's only possible if the first program outputs multiple numbers. But according to the code, it's a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me recheck. The first Java program's code:\n\nThe first program's code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    cnt[scan.nextInt() + 10]++;\n}\n\nThen, the res is computed as the sum over i from 0 to 9 of cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i], plus (cnt[10]*(cnt[10]-1))/2. \n\nSo the output is res, which is a single integer. \n\nTherefore, the second program's input is that single integer. So the second program's output is always 1, except when the first program's output is zero, in which case it's also 1. \n\nWait, so the final output is always 1? That can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of another example. Suppose the first program's output is 3. Then the second program's input is \"3\", so the array is [\"3\"], so the count is 1. \n\nAnother example: first program outputs 0, then the second program's input is \"0\", so the count is 1. \n\nHmm, so the second program's output is always 1. That's odd. Maybe the problem is that the second program is supposed to read the first program's output as a list of numbers, but that's not possible unless the first program outputs multiple numbers. \n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is a list of numbers, but looking at the code, it's a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem description. Let me re-read the user's problem statement. \n\nThe user says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\" So the first program's output is the input to the second. \n\nThe first program's output is a single integer. So the second program's input is that integer as a single token. \n\nTherefore, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nHmm, that's strange. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the second Java program's code. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe code reads a line, splits into input_array. Then for each string in the array, adds 1 to result, then if the string is \"0\", breaks. \n\nSo the result is the number of elements until (and including) the first zero. \n\nIf the input is a single number, like \"5\", then the array has one element \"5\", so the loop runs once, adds 1, and since it's not zero, continues. But there are no more elements, so the result is 1. \n\nIf the input is \"0\", then the array has one element \"0\", so adds 1, then breaks. So result is 1. \n\nIf the input is \"1 2 0 3\", then the array is [\"1\", \"2\", \"0\", \"3\"], so the loop processes \"1\" (result 1), \"2\" (result 2), \"0\" (result 3, then breaks). So the result is 3. \n\nWait, but in this case, the first program's output would have to be \"1 2 0 3\" for that to happen, but the first program only outputs a single number. \n\nAh! Wait a second. Maybe the first program's output is a list of numbers, but according to the code, it's not. The first program's code ends with System.out.println(res), so it's a single number. \n\nTherefore, the second program's input is a single number. So the second program's output is always 1. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the way the programs are connected. Maybe the first program's output is a list of numbers, but the code shows it's a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is a list of numbers, but the code is written incorrectly. But according to the code given, it's a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the first program's code is written in a way that outputs multiple numbers? Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the first Java code's main method:\n\nThe code reads n, then n numbers. Then it counts them in the cnt array. Then computes res and prints it. So the output is a single number. \n\nTherefore, the second program's input is a single number. \n\nSo the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, that's strange. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed with the given code. \n\nSo, the Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program (n followed by n integers), process them through the first algorithm to get res, then process res through the second algorithm (count the number of elements until a zero is found in the input array, which is just the single number). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the n integers.\n\n2. Compute res as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Take res as the input for the second program, which is a single number. \n\n4. The second program's processing is to count the number of elements until a zero is found. Since the input is a single number, the count is 1 unless the number is zero, in which case it's also 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's code counts the elements until a zero is found, including the zero. So if the input is \"0\", the count is 1. If the input is \"5\", the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, that's odd, but perhaps that's the case. \n\nNow, to translate this into Fortran. \n\nThe Fortran program must read the input for the first program (n and n integers), compute res, then compute the second program's result based on res. \n\nThe second program's result is 1 unless the res is zero? Wait no, even if res is zero, the count is 1. \n\nWait, the second program's result is the number of elements until (and including) the first zero. Since the input is a single number, if that number is zero, then the count is 1. If it's non-zero, the count is 1 (since there's no zero after, but the loop runs once). \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe second program's code:\n\nresult starts at 0. \n\nfor each string in the array:\n\n    result +=1 \n\n    if the string is \"0\", break. \n\nSo for input \"5\", the array has one element \"5\". \n\nLoop runs once: result becomes 1. The string is not \"0\", so no break. The loop ends. So the result is 1. \n\nFor input \"0\", the array has one element \"0\". \n\nLoop runs once: result becomes 1. Then, since the string is \"0\", break. So the result is 1. \n\nFor input \"0 1\", the array has two elements. \n\nFirst element \"0\": result becomes 1, then break. So total is 1. \n\nSo in all cases, the second program's output is 1. \n\nWait, so the final output is always 1? That's strange. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. But given the code provided, that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must compute res from the first program, then output 1. \n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me think of another example. Suppose the first program's output is 0, then the second program's output is 1. If the first program's output is 100, the second program's output is 1. \n\nSo the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, that's unexpected, but perhaps that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and the n integers. Compute res as per the first Java program. Then, the second program's result is 1. So the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but that would mean the second program's output is always 1, regardless of the first's output. \n\nBut according to the code, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the second program's input is the first program's output. So if the first program outputs, say, 10, then the second program's input is \"10\", which is a single element. The second program's code counts the number of elements until a zero is found. Since the element is \"10\", which is not zero, the count is 1. \n\nIf the first program outputs 0, then the count is 1. \n\nSo yes, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the second program's code is supposed to process the input as a list of numbers. But in this case, the input is a single number. \n\nHmm, but according to the code, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and the n integers. \n\nCompute res as per the first Java program. \n\nThen, the second program's result is 1. \n\nSo the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the second program's code would process the input as a single number, so the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, but that's strange. Maybe I made a mistake in the first program's code. Let me recheck the first program's code again. \n\nWait, the first program's code is:\n\nres += (cnt[10] * (cnt[10] -1))/2;\n\nSo if there are two 0s (since 0+10=10), then cnt[10] is 2, so (2*1)/2 = 1. So the res would include that. \n\nBut the second program's output is always 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but I have to proceed with the given code. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input, compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's code is supposed to read the first program's output as a line of space-separated numbers. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", which is a single number. So the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 1. \n\nSo the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and the n integers. \n\nCompute res as per the first Java program. \n\nThen, the second program's result is 1. \n\nSo the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the second program's code would process the input as a single number, so the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, but that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written to compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's code may have a different behavior. Let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose the first program's output is 0. Then the second program's input is \"0\", so the count is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is 100, the count is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is 10, the count is 1. \n\nSo yes, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the second program's code is supposed to count the number of elements until a zero is found. \n\nWait, but the input is a single number. So the count is 1 unless the number is zero, but even then it's 1. \n\nSo the final output is always 1. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, to write the Fortran code. \n\nFirst, the first part: read n and the n integers. \n\nThen compute the cnt array. \n\nThe cnt array in Java is of size 21 (indices 0 to 20). Each element corresponds to the count of numbers x where x+10 is the index. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but we can use 0-based if we declare them with lower bound 0. \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are declared with a lower bound. So to have indices from 0 to 20, we can declare it as integer, dimension(0:20) :: cnt. \n\nInitialize all elements to 0. \n\nThen, for each of the n numbers, read them, add 10, and increment the corresponding cnt. \n\nThen compute res as per the first Java code. \n\nThen, the second part: the second program's result is 1. \n\nSo the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nWait, the second program's code is supposed to process the first program's output. \n\nWait, the second program's code is:\n\nThe input is a line of space-separated numbers. \n\nThe code splits into an array, then counts the number of elements until a zero is found. \n\nSo if the first program's output is a single number, say 5, then the input array is [\"5\"], so the count is 1. \n\nIf the first program's output is 0, then the array is [\"0\"], so the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program can be written to compute res, then output 1. \n\nWait, but that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, then read n integers. \n\nCompute cnt array. \n\nCompute res. \n\nThen output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the second program's code is supposed to process the first's output. \n\nWait, but according to the code, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but given the code provided, that's the case. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and the n integers. \n\nCompute res as per first program. \n\nThen output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second program's code. Let me recheck. \n\nThe second program's code:\n\nThe input is read as a line, split into strings. \n\nThe result is the count of elements until (and including) the first zero. \n\nIf the input is a single number, then the count is 1. \n\nSo the second program's output is always 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 1. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, to write the Fortran code. \n\nFirst, read n and the n integers. \n\nIn Fortran, to read n, then n integers. \n\nThen, compute the cnt array. \n\nInitialize cnt(0:20) to 0. \n\nLoop over each input number, add 10 to it, and increment cnt. \n\nThen compute res. \n\nThe res is computed as follows:\n\nres = 0 \n\ndo i = 0, 9 \n\n    res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20 - i) \n\nend do \n\nres = res + (cnt(10) * (cnt(10) -1)) / 2 \n\nThen, the second program's result is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's result is 1, so the final output is 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's code outputs the result. So the final output is 1. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program should output 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nWait, the second program's code is supposed to process the first's output. \n\nWait, but according to the code, the second program's output is always 1. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program can be written as follows:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, x, res, cnt(0:20)\n    integer :: second_result\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n\n    cnt = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) x\n        cnt(x + 10) = cnt(x + 10) + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute res as per first program\n    res = 0\n    do i = 0, 9\n        res = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20 - i)\n    end do\n    res = res + (cnt(10) * (cnt(10) - 1)) / 2\n\n    ! Second program's processing: the input is the res value as a single number\n    ! The second program's result is 1\n    second_result = 1\n\n    ! Output the second program's result\n    write(*,*) second_result\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but according to the second program's logic, the second_result is always 1. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, this Fortran program should work. \n\nWait, but let me test with an example. \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3 \n\nFirst program's res is 0 (as computed earlier). \n\nSecond program's input is 0, so output is 1. \n\nThe Fortran program outputs 1. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput for first program:\n\n2\n\n0 0 \n\nThen cnt(10) is 2. \n\nres = (2 * 1)/2 = 1. \n\nSecond program's input is 1, so output is 1. \n\nWait, but the second program's input is 1, so the count is 1. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example:\n\nFirst program's output is 0. \n\nSecond program's output is 1. \n\nAnother example:\n\nFirst program's output is 5. \n\nSecond program's output is 1. \n\nSo the Fortran program works. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nWait, but the second program's code may have a different behavior. Let me think of a case where the first program's output is a number with a zero in it, but that's not possible because the second program treats it as a single number. \n\nFor example, if the first program outputs 10, then the second program's input is \"10\", which is a single element, so the count is 1. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nThus, the final Fortran program is as above."
