Wait, let's see: In the code's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n   if (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\n   else:\n\n      if (digits[i] <5 \u2192 no access.\n\n      else if (digits[i] ==5 \u2192 check digits[i+1].\n\n      else \u2192 digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\n} So when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] is out of bounds.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC114_C) reads an integer N from input. Then it starts with a number 357 and iterates, checking if the number contains 3,5,7. It counts how many such numbers are <= N. But there's also some logic where it builds the next number by appending digits in a specific way. The loop continues until the number exceeds N. The count c is printed at the end.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC155_E) takes a string number, processes its digits, and calculates some bills based on the digits. The input here is the output of the first program. Wait, but the first program's output is the count c, which is an integer. So the second program's input is that count as a string? Or maybe the first program's output is the count, which is then used as the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that count, which is a number, but it's read as a string. The second program processes each digit of that number to compute the bills.\n\nSo the overall process is: input N to first program, which outputs a count c. Then the second program takes that c as input (as a string), processes its digits, and outputs the bills. The final Fortran program must read N, compute c, then process c's digits to compute the bills, and output that.\n\nNow, the challenge is to combine both steps into a single Fortran program without any intermediate I/O. So the first part (the first Java program's logic) must be implemented in Fortran, then the second part (the second Java program's logic) must follow, using the result from the first part as input.\n\nLet me break down each part.\n\nFirst part (ABC114_C):\n\nThe first program starts with i = 357, and loops while i <= N. For each i, it checks if the string of i contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment count c. Then, to get the next i, it builds a new number by processing the digits of the current i in reverse. The way the next number is built is a bit tricky. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe code for building the next i:\n\nThe current i is converted to a string s. Then, a StringBuilder is used to build the next number. The loop goes through each character of s in reverse (since the for loop is from 0 to s.length()-1, but the character is taken from the end). The logic is:\n\nInitialize a flag f as false. For each character (starting from the last digit of s, moving backward):\n\nIf f is false, then:\n\n- if the current character is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n- else if it's '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n- else, append '3'.\n\nElse (f is true), just append the current character.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false, append a '3' to the end.\n\nThen reverse the string (since the processing was done in reverse order?), and parse it as the next i.\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuilder, and the loop is over the characters in reverse order. Let me think:\n\nThe original string s is, say, \"357\". The loop for j from 0 to s.length()-1 (so 0,1,2 for length 3). The character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0, it's the last character (position 2, '7'), then j=1 is position 1 ('5'), j=2 is position 0 ('3').\n\nWait, the loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1, so for each j, the character is taken from the end. So the first character processed is the last digit of the original number. The code is building the next number by processing each digit in reverse order, and building the next number's digits in a certain way.\n\nThe logic for building the next number is a bit complex. Let me try to see with an example.\n\nTake i = 357 (string \"357\").\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (digits are '7', '5', '3').\n\nThe first character (j=0) is '7', which is not 3 or 5. So since f is false, we append '3', and f remains false? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nElse if a is '5' \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nElse (a is not 3 or 5) \u2192 append '3', and f remains false.\n\nWait, in the first step (j=0, a is '7'), since it's not 3 or 5, so append '3', and f stays false.\n\nThen next j=1: a is '5'. Since f is still false, so check if a is 5 \u2192 yes. So append '7', set f to true.\n\nThen j=2: a is '3'. Now f is true, so append '3' (since f is true, just append the character).\n\nSo the sb after processing all characters would be '3' (from first step), '7' (second), '3' (third). So the string is \"373\". Then, since f was set to true, we don't append anything else. Then reverse the string (since the code does sb2.reverse().toString()).\n\nWait, the code uses a StringBuffer sb2 which is a copy of sb, then reversed. So the sb was built in the order of processing the reversed digits, so the final string after reversing would be the correct order.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal digits in reverse order (processing order):\n\n7,5,3 \u2192 the sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character (7) \u2192 append '3' (since not 3/5). So sb is \"3\".\n\nSecond character (5) \u2192 since f is false, append '7', set f to true. Now sb is \"37\".\n\nThird character (3) \u2192 since f is true, append '3' \u2192 sb is \"373\".\n\nThen, the sb2 is a copy of sb, then reversed. So the reversed string is \"373\" \u2192 reversed is \"373\"? Wait, no. Wait, the original sb is \"373\", so reversing it would give \"373\" again. So the next i is 373?\n\nWait, but the next i is 373, which is less than N (assuming N is big enough). Then the next iteration would process 373.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the next number is generated is by appending digits in a way that each step adds a digit, but the exact logic is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next number is generated by appending 3,5,7 in some order. The code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe process is building the next number by taking the current number's digits in reverse, and for each digit, starting from the last digit (the least significant digit), it modifies the digits in a way that when reversed again, the next number is formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next number is formed by appending a digit to the current number, but the way it's done is through this process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next number is generated by taking the current number and appending a digit, but the digit depends on the previous digits. The code's logic is a bit hard to parse, but the key is to translate it into Fortran.\n\nThe main steps for the first part are:\n\nInitialize i = 357, count c=0.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n- Check if the string of i contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c.\n\n- Generate the next i by processing the digits as per the code's logic.\n\nThe next i is generated by building a new number from the current digits, following the rules in the code.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran requires handling numbers as strings, processing each digit, and building the next number.\n\nThe second part (ABC155_E):\n\nThe second program takes a string (the count c from the first program), processes its digits in reverse order (since the code loops from 0 to length-1, and the digits array is filled with the reversed digits). Then, it calculates the number of bills based on some rules.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Read the input as a string (number).\n\n- Convert each digit to an array, stored in reverse order (digits[0] is the least significant digit, etc.), with an extra digit at the end (digits has length+1 elements).\n\nWait, the code initializes digits as new int[number.length() +1], so digits has one more element than the number's length. Then, for each i from 0 to number.length()-1:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt(number.length()-1 -i) - '0'\n\nSo the first digit (digits[0]) is the last character of the input string (the least significant digit). The next digits are the previous characters, etc. The last element (digits[number.length()]) is initialized to 0? Or not set? Because the loop only runs up to i < number.length(). So digits[number.length()] is not initialized, but in the code, when processing, they might handle it.\n\nThen, the bills are calculated by iterating over each digit (including the extra one?), and applying some rules.\n\nThe rules for each digit (digits[i]):\n\nIf the digit is 10 (which can happen due to carry?), set digits[i+1] +=1 and set digits[i] to 0.\n\nWait, the code first checks if digits[i] is 10, then does that.\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value:\n\n- if <5 \u2192 add to bills.\n\n- if ==5 \u2192 add 5, and if the next digit (i+1) is >=5, increment it.\n\n- else (digits[i] >5 \u2192 6-9?), add 10 - digits[i], and increment the next digit.\n\nWait, the code's logic for the bills:\n\nfor each i from 0 to number.length():\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 so up to the length (so the digits array has length+1 elements, so the loop goes up to the last element (digits[number.length()] is included).\n\nWait, the code's loop is over i from 0 to digits.length-1? Because digits has length number.length()+1, so the loop runs i from 0 to number.length() (since the loop condition is i <= number.length()).\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is handling carries beyond the original digits. The key is to process each digit, handling carries, and compute the bills.\n\nThe final output is the total bills.\n\nSo the second part's input is the count c from the first part, which is an integer. So in Fortran, after computing c, we need to convert it to a string, process its digits as per the second program's logic, and compute the bills.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N from input (the first program's input).\n\n2. Compute c (the count from the first Java program).\n\n3. Convert c to a string, then process its digits as per the second Java program's logic to compute the bills.\n\n4. Output the bills.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement both parts in Fortran without I/O in between.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the first part (computing c).\n\nImplementing the first part in Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop starting at i=357, and for each i <= N, check if it contains 3,5,7, then generate the next i.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- For each i, check if the string representation contains all three digits 3,5,7.\n\n- Generate the next i by processing the digits as per the Java code's logic.\n\nFirst, the check for containing 3,5,7:\n\nIn Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done with write(*,*) or using internal files. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s,*) i\n\nBut trimming leading spaces, etc. Alternatively, using a format to avoid leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to process the digits directly without converting to a string, but that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, for the check, we can check each digit of the number to see if 3,5,7 are present.\n\nWait, the code in Java checks if the string contains each of the three characters. So in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to convert the number to a string, then check for presence of '3', '5', '7'.\n\nBut in Fortran, string handling is a bit more involved. Let's think:\n\nFunction to check if a number has all three digits:\n\nlogical function has357(n) result(res)\ninteger, intent(in) :: n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\ninteger :: i, len\nwrite(s, '(i0)') n\nlen = len_trim(s)\nres = .false.\nif (index(s, '3') >0 .and. index(s, '5')>0 .and. index(s, '7')>0) then\n   res = .true.\nend if\nend function\n\nThat's a possible approach.\n\nNow, generating the next i:\n\nThe next i is generated by processing the digits of the current i in reverse order, applying the rules, then reversing again.\n\nThe process is:\n\nTake the current i as a string s.\n\nProcess each character in reverse order (from last digit to first).\n\nBuild a new string as per the rules, then reverse it and parse as the next i.\n\nThe rules for building the next string:\n\nInitialize a flag f = .false.\n\nFor each character in s (processed in reverse order):\n\nWait, the Java code loops over the characters in reverse order (since the for loop is over j from 0 to s.length-1, and the character is s.charAt(s.length-1 -j). So the first character processed is the last digit of the original number.\n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n\nchar a = s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - j);\n\nSo for j=0, it's the last character (the least significant digit).\n\nThen, for each a (the current digit in reverse order):\n\nIf f is false:\n\n- if a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n- else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n- else (a is not 3 or 5), append '3', and f remains false.\n\nElse (f is true):\n\nappend the current a.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3'.\n\nThen reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code then does:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb);\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is built in the order of processing the reversed digits. So the sb is built as follows:\n\nSuppose the original digits are 3,5,7 (string \"357\").\n\nProcessing in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nFirst character is '7' (j=0):\n\nf is false. Since a is not 3 or 5, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character (j=1, '5'):\n\nf is still false. a is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (j=2, '3'):\n\nf is now true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, the sb2 is a copy of sb, then reversed. So the reversed string is \"373\" \u2192 same as original, so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's next step is to reverse the sb and parse it. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb2.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is \"373\", then reversed would be \"373\" again. So the next i is 373.\n\nHmm, so the process is that the new number is built by processing the digits in reverse order, applying the rules, then reversing the result again to get the next number.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is that the new number is formed by appending digits in a way that each step adds a digit, but the exact logic is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the next number is generated by appending a digit to the current number, but the digit depends on the previous digits. The code's logic is a bit tricky, but the key is to translate it into Fortran.\n\nLet me think of the steps for generating the next i:\n\nGiven the current i as a string s:\n\n1. Reverse the string s to process digits from least significant to most.\n\nWait, no, the code processes the digits in reverse order (from last to first), so the first character processed is the last digit of s.\n\nThe processing builds a new string (sb) as follows:\n\nInitialize f = false.\n\nFor each character a in s (processed in reverse order):\n\n- if f is false:\n\n   if a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n   else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n   else (a is not 3 or 5), append '3', leave f as false.\n\n- else (f is true):\n\n   append a.\n\nAfter processing all characters, if f is still false, append '3'.\n\nThen, reverse the resulting string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's final step is to reverse the sb and parse it as the next i. So the sb is built in the order of processing the reversed digits, then reversed again to form the next number.\n\nWait, let's see with the example:\n\nOriginal s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe sb is built as follows:\n\nFirst character '7' (a is '7'):\n\nf is false \u2192 since a is not 3 or 5, append '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond character '5' (a is '5'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character '3' (a is '3'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"3\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, reverse this to get \"373\" \u2192 so the next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: current i is 373 (string \"373\").\n\nProcessing in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character '3' (a is '3'):\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nSecond character '7' (a is '7'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird character '3' (a is '3'):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"5\" + \"7\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"573\".\n\nReverse it \u2192 \"375\"? Wait no, wait the sb is \"573\", reversed is \"375\".\n\nWait, no, the sb is \"573\", then reversed would be \"375\". So the next i is 375.\n\nWait, but the code's next step is to reverse the sb and parse it. So the next i would be 375?\n\nWait, the code's next i is the reversed string of the sb. So in this case, the sb is \"573\", reversed is \"375\".\n\nSo the next i is 375.\n\nHmm, so the process is that the new number is formed by taking the current digits, processing them in reverse order, building a new string according to the rules, then reversing that string to get the next number.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran would be:\n\nFor a given i:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Reverse the string s to process each character in reverse order (but actually, the code processes the original string's characters in reverse order, so perhaps we can process the string from the end).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the string as a character array, then loop from the end.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps we can process each digit by extracting them one by one.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan for the next i:\n\nFunction next_i(i) returns the next number.\n\nTo compute next_i:\n\n- Convert i to a string s.\n\n- Process each character in s in reverse order (from last to first character).\n\n- Build a new string according to the rules.\n\n- Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsubroutine next_i(current, next)\ninteger, intent(in) :: current\ninteger, intent(out) :: next\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, new_s, temp\ninteger :: len, i_char, f, pos, a_char\nlogical :: flag\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') current\nlen = len_trim(s)\nflag = .false.\nnew_s = ''\n\ndo i_char = 1, len\n   a_char = ichar(s(len - i_char +1: len - i_char +1)) - ichar('0')  ! Wait, perhaps better to process each character in reverse order.\n\nWait, perhaps better to loop over each character in reverse order:\n\ndo i_char = 1, len\n   current_char = s(len - i_char +1: len - i_char +1)\n   ... process current_char ...\nend do\n\nWait, let's think of the characters in s as s(1), s(2), ..., s(len). The first character is the first digit (most significant), the last is the least.\n\nProcessing in reverse order would be from s(len) down to s(1).\n\nSo for each character in s, starting from the end (i.e., s(len), s(len-1), ..., s(1)):\n\nWe can loop from i=1 to len, and take s(len - i +1).\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, temp_str\ninteger :: i, len, pos, a_char\nlogical :: f\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') current\nlen = len_trim(s)\nf = .false.\ntemp_str = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len\n   current_char = s(len - i +1: len - i +1)\n   if (.not. f) then\n      select case (current_char)\n      case ('3')\n         temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '5'\n         f = .true.\n      case ('5')\n         temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '7'\n         f = .true.\n      case default\n         temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '3'\n      end select\n   else\n      temp_str = trim(temp_str) // current_char\n   end if\nend do\n\nif (.not. f) then\n   temp_str = trim(temp_str) // '3'\nend if\n\n! Now reverse temp_str to get the next number\ncall reverse_string(temp_str, reversed_str)\nread(reversed_str, *) next\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but reversing the temp_str would give the next number. Because the temp_str was built by processing the reversed digits, so reversing it again gives the correct next number.\n\nWait, let's see with the first example:\n\ncurrent is 357 \u2192 s is '357', len=3.\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\ni=1 \u2192 current_char is s(3) \u2192 '7'\n\nf is false \u2192 since it's not 3 or 5, append '3' \u2192 temp_str is '3', f remains false.\n\ni=2 \u2192 current_char is s(2) \u2192 '5'\n\nf is false \u2192 append '7', set f to true \u2192 temp_str is '37'.\n\ni=3 \u2192 current_char is s(1) \u2192 '3'\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 temp_str becomes '373'.\n\nThen, since f is true, no need to append '3'.\n\nReversing '373' gives '373', so next is 373.\n\nAnother example: current is 373 \u2192 s is '373', len=3.\n\nProcessing in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\ni=1 \u2192 current_char is s(3) \u2192 '3'\n\nf is false \u2192 append '5', set f to true \u2192 temp_str is '5'.\n\ni=2 \u2192 current_char is s(2) \u2192 '7'\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7' \u2192 temp_str is '57'.\n\ni=3 \u2192 current_char is s(1) \u2192 '3'\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 temp_str is '573'.\n\nReversing gives '375', so next is 375.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the subroutine next_i would need to handle this.\n\nNow, the main loop for the first part:\n\nInitialize i = 357, c=0.\n\nWhile i <= N:\n\n   if has357(i) \u2192 increment c.\n\n   compute next_i to get new_i.\n\n   set i = new_i.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop continues while i <= N. So after computing new_i, if it's still <= N, the loop continues.\n\nWait, but the next_i could be larger than N, so the loop stops when i exceeds N.\n\nThus, the loop is:\n\ni = 357\n\nc =0\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   if (has357(i)) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   end if\n\n   call next_i(i, new_i)\n\n   i = new_i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the next_i is computed even if the current i is counted. So the loop is:\n\nwhile (i <= N) {\n\n   check and count.\n\n   compute next i.\n\n}\n\nSo the loop condition is checked before processing. So in Fortran, the do while loop is correct.\n\nNow, the second part: processing the count c to compute the bills.\n\nThe second part's input is the count c, which is an integer. We need to process its digits as per the second Java program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Convert c to a string (number_str).\n\n2. Reverse the digits (so that the first digit in the array is the least significant digit).\n\n3. Create an array digits of length (number_length +1), where digits(1) to digits(number_length) are the reversed digits, and digits(number_length+1) is initialized to 0 (or whatever, but the code in Java initializes it as part of the array, but the loop may handle it).\n\nWait, in Java, the digits array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1], so all elements are 0 initially. Then, for each i from 0 to number.length()-1, digits[i] is set to the digit. The digits[number.length()] remains 0 unless modified in the loop.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\ndigits is initialized with length number.length() +1. The loop runs for i from 0 to number.length() -1:\n\ndigits[i] = ... (the digit from the string).\n\nThe digits[number.length()] is not set in this loop, so it's 0.\n\nThen, the loop for bills runs from i=0 to number.length() (inclusive). So the last element (digits[number.length()]) is included.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can do:\n\nnumber_str = string representation of c.\n\nlen = len_trim(number_str)\n\ndigits array has size len +1.\n\ndigits(1) to digits(len) are the reversed digits (each character converted to integer).\n\ndigits(len+1) =0.\n\nThen, process each digit from i=1 to len+1 (since in Java it's 0-based up to number.length(), which is len in Fortran terms).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to len (since number.length() is the length of the string). So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=1 to len+1 (since Fortran arrays start at 1).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's digits array has indices 0 to number.length() (since length is +1). So in Fortran, the array would be 1-based with indices 1 to len+1.\n\nThus, the steps in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_digits = 20 ! or some sufficient size.\n\ninteger :: c, bills =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: number_str\n\nwrite(number_str, '(i0)') c\n\nlen = len_trim(number_str)\n\ndigits(1:len+1) = 0\n\ndo i =1, len\n\n   digits(i) = ichar(number_str(len -i +1: len -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndigits(len+1) =0\n\nThen, process each digit from i=1 to len+1:\n\ndo i =1, len+1\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the code first checks if digits[i] is 10, then does the carry. But in Fortran, digits are initialized to 0, and during processing, digits can be set to 10?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits are initialized to 0 except for the first len elements. The code's first step is to check if digits[i] is 10. But how can digits[i] be 10?\n\nAh, because during processing, when digits[i] is greater than 9, like in the case when digits[i] is 10 (from a carry?), the code handles it by carrying over.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first check is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then carry over.\n\nBut in the initial setup, digits[i] can only be 0-9 (since they are digits of the input number). So the 10 can only come from the processing steps.\n\nWait, in the Java code's processing loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; ... ) {\n\n   if (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then carry.\n\n   else:\n\n      process the digit.\n\n}\n\nWait, the code first checks for 10, then does the carry, then processes the digit's contribution to bills.\n\nWait, the code's order is:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 carry.\n\nthen, process the digit's contribution (bills += ...).\n\nWait, no, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each i:\n\n   if (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 carry.\n\n   then, decide based on digits[i] (now possibly modified by the carry? Or not?)\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) {\n\n   digits[i+1]++;\n\n   digits[i] =0;\n\n}\n\nthen, the code checks digits[i] again for the bills.\n\nWait, so the first step is to handle any digit that is 10 (due to a previous carry?), by carrying over.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration, digits[i] can't be 10 unless it was set by a previous step.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that during processing, when a digit exceeds 9, it is handled by carrying over.\n\nWait, let's see the code's steps:\n\nThe loop is over all digits (including the extra one). For each digit:\n\nFirst, check if it's 10 \u2192 if yes, carry over (digits[i+1] +=1, set to 0).\n\nThen, compute the contribution to bills based on the current digit (after possible carry).\n\nWait, but the code's first step is to check for 10, then process the digit's value.\n\nWait, the code's code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        digits[i] = 0;\n\n    }\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) {\n\n        bills += digits[i];\n\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n\n            digits[i+1]++;\n\n        }\n\n        bills +=5;\n\n    } else {\n\n        digits[i+1]++;\n\n        bills +=10 - digits[i];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, so the first part of the loop (checking for 10) is to handle any digit that is 10 (from previous steps?), then the rest is processing the current digit's value (now possibly 0 if it was 10).\n\nWait, but how can digits[i] be 10 in the first place?\n\nAh, because in the else part (digits[i] >5), when we do digits[i+1]++, which could cause digits[i+1] to become 10 in a later iteration.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that during processing, when a digit is over 5, we add to the next digit, which could cause it to become 10, which is handled in the next iteration.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The code's first step in each iteration is to check if the current digit is 10, and if so, carry over. This is to handle any overflow from previous steps.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code must first check if the current digit is 10, then carry over, then process the digit's contribution.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ndo i =1, len+1\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now process the contribution to bills.\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the else if (digits[i] ==5) case, after adding 5 to bills, there's a check on digits[i+1]. But this could affect the next digit's processing. However, since the loop is proceeding sequentially, this is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, after processing digit i, the next digit (i+1) may have been incremented, but that's handled in the next iteration.\n\nNow, the problem is that in Fortran, the array digits has to be of sufficient size. The maximum possible length of the input c is up to, say, 10^18 (since the first program's N can be up to that?), but in practice, the count c is likely smaller. But for the array, we can set a parameter like max_digits = 20, which should be enough.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n\n2. Compute c via the first part's logic.\n\n3. Compute the bills via the second part's logic on c.\n\n4. Output the bills.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the has357 function:\n\nFUNCTION has357(n) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  CHARACTER(LEN=20) :: s\n  WRITE(s, '(I0)') n\n  s = ADJUSTL(s)  ! Remove leading spaces\n  res = (INDEX(s, '3') > 0) .AND. (INDEX(s, '5') > 0) .AND. (INDEX(s, '7') > 0)\nEND FUNCTION has357\n\nNext, the next_i subroutine:\n\nSUBROUTINE next_i(current, next)\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: current\n  INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: next\n  CHARACTER(LEN=20) :: s, temp_str, reversed_str\n  INTEGER :: len, i, a_char\n  LOGICAL :: f\n\n  WRITE(s, '(I0)') current\n  len = LEN_TRIM(s)\n  f = .FALSE.\n  temp_str = ''\n\n  DO i = 1, len\n     a_char = s(LEN_TRIM(s) - i + 1: LEN_TRIM(s) - i + 1)\n     IF (.NOT. f) THEN\n        SELECT CASE (a_char)\n        CASE ('3')\n           temp_str = TRIM(temp_str) // '5'\n           f = .TRUE.\n        CASE ('5')\n           temp_str = TRIM(temp_str) // '7'\n           f = .TRUE.\n        CASE DEFAULT\n           temp_str = TRIM(temp_str) // '3'\n        END SELECT\n     ELSE\n        temp_str = TRIM(temp_str) // a_char\n     END IF\n  END DO\n\n  IF (.NOT. f) THEN\n     temp_str = TRIM(temp_str) // '3'\n  END IF\n\n  ! Reverse temp_str to get the next number\n  reversed_str = ''\n  DO i = LEN_TRIM(temp_str), 1, -1\n     reversed_str = TRIM(reversed_str) // temp_str(i:i)\n  END DO\n\n  READ(reversed_str, *) next\nEND SUBROUTINE next_i\n\nWait, but reversing the temp_str can be done by reversing the string. Alternatively, using a helper function.\n\nAlternatively, the reversed_str can be built by looping from the end of temp_str.\n\nWait, the temp_str is built by processing the reversed digits, so reversing it again gives the next number.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nPROGRAM main\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: N, c, bills, i, new_i\n  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: max_digits = 20\n  INTEGER :: digits(max_digits +1)\n  CHARACTER(LEN=20) :: number_str\n  LOGICAL :: has357\n  INTEGER :: len\n\n  ! Read N\n  READ(*,*) N\n\n  ! Compute c\n  c = 0\n  i = 357\n  DO\n     IF (i > N) EXIT\n     IF (has357(i)) THEN\n        c = c +1\n     END IF\n     CALL next_i(i, new_i)\n     i = new_i\n  END DO\n\n  ! Compute bills from c\n  WRITE(number_str, '(I0)') c\n  len = LEN_TRIM(number_str)\n  digits = 0\n  DO i = 1, len\n     digits(i) = ICHAR(number_str(len -i +1: len -i +1)) - ICHAR('0')\n  END DO\n  digits(len+1) = 0\n\n  bills = 0\n  DO i = 1, len +1\n     IF (digits(i) == 10) THEN\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        digits(i) = 0\n     END IF\n     IF (digits(i) <5) THEN\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n     ELSE IF (digits(i) ==5) THEN\n        IF (digits(i+1) >=5) THEN\n           digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        END IF\n        bills = bills +5\n     ELSE\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n     END IF\n  END DO\n\n  ! Output bills\n  WRITE(*,*) bills\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but in the loop for processing digits, the loop runs from i=1 to len+1. However, when i reaches len+1, then digits(i+1) would be digits(len+2), which is beyond the array's size (since digits is size max_digits+1, which is 21). So if len is 20, then len+1 is 21, and i+1 would be 22, which is beyond the array's size. This could be a problem.\n\nAh, right! The digits array is declared as max_digits +1 (21 elements). So when len is 20, the loop runs up to i=21 (len+1=21). Then, when i=21, digits(i+1) is digits(22), which is out of bounds.\n\nThis is a bug. To fix this, the digits array should be of size max_digits +2, or adjust the loop.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the digits array has length number.length() +1, so the maximum i is number.length(), which in Fortran is len. So the loop in Java runs up to i <= number.length(), which is len in Fortran. Wait, no:\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) \u2192 which is 0 to len (since number.length() is the length of the string). So in Fortran, the loop should be from i=1 to len+1 (since the array is 1-based). But the digits array must have at least len+2 elements to handle digits(i+1) when i is len+1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, the digits array has length number.length() +1 \u2192 indices 0 to number.length().\n\nWhen i is number.length() (the last index), then digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array's size. So that's a problem in Java as well?\n\nWait, no, in Java, the loop runs up to i <= number.length(), which is the same as the array's length (since the array is length+1). So when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is out of bounds. Wait, that's a bug in the original Java code?\n\nWait, the Java code's digits array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1], so indices 0 to number.length().\n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to number.length() (inclusive). So when i is number.length(), then digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is out of bounds. That's a bug in the original code?\n\nWait, no, because in the code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n   if (digits[i] == 10) {\n\n      digits[i+1]++;\n\n      digits[i] =0;\n\n   }\n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nWait, when i is number.length(), then digits[i+1] is digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array's size (since the array is size number.length()+1 \u2192 indices 0 to number.length()).\n\nThis is an off-by-one error in the original Java code. But perhaps the code is correct because when i is number.length(), digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()]), and digits[i+1] would be out of bounds. So this is a bug.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How does the original code handle this?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that when i reaches the last element (number.length()), the digits[i+1] is beyond the array, but in Java, arrays are 0-based, so the maximum index is number.length(). So when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] is out of bounds. This would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nThis suggests that there's a bug in the original Java code. But perhaps the code is correct because when processing the last digit (i = number.length()), the digits[i+1] is not accessed except in the case where digits[i] is 10 or in the else clause (digits[i] >5).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the code's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n   if (digits[i] ==10) \u2192 then digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\n   else:\n\n      if (digits[i] <5 \u2192 no access.\n\n      else if (digits[i] ==5 \u2192 check digits[i+1].\n\n      else \u2192 digits[i+1] is accessed.\n\n}\n\nSo when i is number.length(), digits[i+1] is out of bounds.\n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps the original code has a bug, but maybe the input is such that this case never occurs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop should run up to i < number.length() +1, but in any case, this is a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code is correct because when i is number.length(), the digits[i] is 0 (since it was initialized to 0), so the first condition (digits[i] ==10) is false. Then, in the else part, if digits[i] is 0 (less than 5), then it adds to bills, and no access to digits[i+1]. So the only time digits[i+1] is accessed is when digits[i] is 10 or >5.\n\nBut when i is number.length(), digits[i] is 0 (assuming it wasn't modified), so the only access to digits[i+1] would be if digits[i] is 10 (which it isn't), or in the else clause (digits[i] >5 \u2192 0 is not).\n\nThus, the code may not actually access digits[i+1] when i is the last index. So the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the digits array must have at least len+2 elements to handle when i is len+1 (the last element in the loop). Wait, in Fortran, the loop is from i=1 to len+1 (since the Java loop is up to number.length(), which is len in Fortran terms). So the maximum i is len+1 (since in Java it's up to number.length(), which is len in Fortran's len_trim(number_str)).\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nnumber_str is the string of c, length len.\n\ndigits array is of size len+1 +1? Or perhaps I need to make the array larger.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code:\n\ndigits is declared as max_digits +1 (21 elements). But when len is 20, then len+1 is 21. The loop runs up to i=21 (len+1). So when i=21, digits(i+1) is digits(22), which is beyond the array's size (21 elements). So this is a problem.\n\nTo fix this, the digits array should be of size max_digits +2. Let's adjust the parameter:\n\nINTEGER, PARAMETER :: max_digits = 20\n\ndigits(max_digits +2) \u2192 22 elements.\n\nThen, when len is 20, the loop runs up to i=21 (len+1=21), and digits(i+1) would be 22, which is within the array.\n\nThus, the digits array should be declared as:\n\nINTEGER :: digits(max_digits +2)\n\nSo in the main program:\n\nPROGRAM main\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: N, c, bills, i, new_i\n  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: max_digits = 20\n  INTEGER :: digits(max_digits +2)  ! Now 22 elements\n  CHARACTER(LEN=20) :: number_str\n  LOGICAL :: has357\n  INTEGER :: len\n\n  ! Read N\n  READ(*,*) N\n\n  ! Compute c\n  c = 0\n  i = 357\n  DO\n     IF (i > N) EXIT\n     IF (has357(i)) THEN\n        c = c +1\n     END IF\n     CALL next_i(i, new_i)\n     i = new_i\n  END DO\n\n  ! Compute bills from c\n  WRITE(number_str, '(I0)') c\n  len = LEN_TRIM(number_str)\n  digits = 0\n  DO i = 1, len\n     digits(i) = ICHAR(number_str(len -i +1: len -i +1)) - ICHAR('0')\n  END DO\n  digits(len+1) = 0\n\n  bills = 0\n  DO i = 1, len +1\n     IF (digits(i) == 10) THEN\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        digits(i) = 0\n     END IF\n     IF (digits(i) <5) THEN\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n     ELSE IF (digits(i) ==5) THEN\n        IF (digits(i+1) >=5) THEN\n           digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        END IF\n        bills = bills +5\n     ELSE\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n     END IF\n  END DO\n\n  ! Output bills\n  WRITE(*,*) bills\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nNow, this should handle the array size correctly.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the next_i subroutine when reversing the temp_str. The code currently builds reversed_str by looping from the end of temp_str to the beginning. Alternatively, using a helper function to reverse a string would be better.\n\nAlternatively, the reversed_str can be built as:\n\nreversed_str = reverse(temp_str)\n\nwhere reverse is a function that reverses a string.\n\nAdding a reverse function:\n\nFUNCTION reverse(s) RESULT(reversed)\n  CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN) :: s\n  CHARACTER(LEN=LEN(s)) :: reversed\n  INTEGER :: i, len\n  len = LEN_TRIM(s)\n  DO i = 1, len\n     reversed(i:i) = s(len -i +1:len -i +1)\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION reverse\n\nThen in next_i:\n\nreversed_str = reverse(temp_str)\n\nBut need to make sure the length is correct.\n\nAlternatively, in the next_i subroutine:\n\nAfter building temp_str, reversed_str is the reverse of temp_str.\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted.\n\nNow, putting all together, the final Fortran program should look like this, with the functions and subroutines properly placed.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the next_i subroutine when the temp_str is empty. But since the initial i is 357, and the loop continues until i exceeds N, the temp_str should always have at least one character.\n\nTesting with the example where N is 357:\n\nThe first iteration:\n\ni=357 \u2192 check if contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes \u2192 c becomes 1.\n\nThen compute next_i(357) \u2192 373.\n\nNext iteration: i=373 \u2192 check if contains 3,5,7 \u2192 3,7, but no 5 \u2192 so not counted.\n\nNext_i(373) \u2192 375 (as before).\n\ni=375 \u2192 contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes \u2192 c becomes 2.\n\nNext_i(375) \u2192 let's see:\n\nProcessing digits of 375 \u2192 '3','7','5' \u2192 reversed order is 5,7,3.\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nFirst character '5' (since reversed order is 5 (last digit), then 7, then 3.\n\nWait, the string is '375', so the characters are '3','7','5'.\n\nProcessing in reverse order (5,7,3):\n\ni=1 \u2192 current_char is '5' (the last digit).\n\nf is false \u2192 since it's '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\ni=2 \u2192 current_char is '7' \u2192 f is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\ni=3 \u2192 current_char is '3' \u2192 f is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo temp_str is '7' (from first step) + '7' (second) + '3' (third) \u2192 '773'.\n\nReversing gives '377' \u2192 next_i is 377.\n\nNow, i=377 \u2192 check if contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes (3 and 7, but no 5 \u2192 no. Wait, 377 has 3 and 7 but no 5 \u2192 so not counted.\n\nThus, the count c would be 2 for N=375.\n\nBut this is just an example.\n\nOverall, the code should now handle the logic correctly.\n\nThus, the final Fortran program combines both steps into one, with proper handling of the intermediate data without I/O."
