It reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers. It processes this array to create another array aa, and then outputs the elements of aa plus 1, separated by spaces. The second Java file (codeforces_276_B) reads a string, counts the frequency of each character, checks how many have odd counts, and decides between \"First\" or \"Second\" based on that.\n\nWait, but the user said the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each used as input to the next. So the first Java program's output is the input for the second. Therefore, the Fortran program must first process the first part (like the first Java file), then pass its result to the second part (the second Java file's logic), without any I/O in between.\n\nHmm, so the first part's output is the input for the second. So in the Fortran program, the first part's output (the array aa) must be the input to the second part. But the second Java program expects a string input. Wait, the first Java program's output is a sequence of numbers (the aa array elements +1). The second Java program reads a string. So the first program's output is a string of numbers, which is then the input to the second program. Therefore, in the Fortran program, the first part's output (the numbers) must be passed as a string to the second part's processing.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first part (n, k, and the array bb), process it to get the aa array, then use the resulting string (the output of the first part) as the input to the second part's processing (counting characters and deciding \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k, and the array bb from input (only first part reads input).\n2. Process the first part's logic to compute the aa array.\n3. Generate the output string of the first part (the aa elements +1 separated by spaces).\n4. Use this string as the input to the second part's processing (count characters, check odd counts).\n5. Output the result of the second part (either \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's logic. Let's see the first Java code's main processing steps:\n\nThe first Java program's main steps:\n\n- Read n, k, and the array bb (size n).\n- Initialize array aa (size n) and m=0.\n- For each a from n-1 downto 0:\n   - Initialize j=0.\n   - While bb[a] >0:\n      - If aa[j] >= a +k, decrement bb[a].\n      - j increments.\n   - Then, shift elements in aa from m down to j, then set aa[j] = a. m increments.\n- Finally, print each aa[i]+1.\n\nWait, the loop for a is from n-1 down to 0. For each a (which is the index?), the code processes the bb array. The logic here is a bit tricky. Let me try to understand what this loop does.\n\nThe code is trying to build the array aa such that each element a is placed in the earliest possible position j where the condition holds. The while loop checks for each j starting from 0, and if aa[j] is >= a +k, then it can decrement bb[a]. But I'm not sure exactly what the purpose is here. Maybe it's part of some algorithm to arrange the elements in aa based on some constraints.\n\nBut regardless, the Fortran code must replicate this logic exactly. So I need to translate that loop into Fortran.\n\nNow, the second part's logic is straightforward: read a string, count character frequencies, check how many have odd counts, then decide based on that.\n\nBut in the Fortran program, the first part's output (the string of numbers) is the input to the second part. So after generating the string (the first part's output), we need to process it as the input string for the second part.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k, and the array bb from stdin.\n2. Compute the aa array as per the first Java code's logic.\n3. Generate the output string (the aa elements +1, space-separated).\n4. Use this string as the input to the second part's processing (count characters, etc.).\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to handle this?\n\nFirst, the first part's variables:\n\n- n and k are integers.\n- bb is an array of integers of size n.\n- aa is an array of integers of size n.\n- m is an integer counter.\n\nThe loop over a from n-1 downto 0 (in Java, indices start at 0, so in Fortran, which is 1-based by default, need to adjust indices. Wait, but in Fortran arrays can be declared with any lower bound, but by default they start at 1. So perhaps better to use 0-based indices here, but need to be careful.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the array bb is 0-based (indices 0 to n-1). So in Fortran, perhaps we can declare the arrays with lower bound 0. Alternatively, adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, let's use 1-based arrays, but adjust the loops accordingly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, perhaps in Fortran, we can use arrays with lower bound 0. To do that, we can declare them as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: bb\n\nBut in Fortran, the size must be known at compile time, but here n is a variable. Hmm, that complicates things. Alternatively, use allocatable arrays.\n\nYes, better to use allocatable arrays. So first, read n, then allocate arrays of size n.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the next n integers into bb array (size n).\n\nThen process the first part's logic to compute aa array.\n\nThen, generate the output string (the aa elements +1, space-separated). But instead of printing it, we need to store this string as the input for the second part.\n\nWait, but in the second part, the input is a string. So the first part's output is a string, which is the input to the second part. So in Fortran, after computing the aa array, we need to create a string that is the concatenation of (aa(i)+1) followed by a space, for each i from 1 to n (assuming 1-based), then a newline. But since in the second part, the input is this string, we can process it as a character string variable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the second part's processing requires reading a string from input. Since the first part's output is the input to the second part, we can't actually write it to stdout and then read it again. So we need to generate the string in memory and then process it as the input for the second part.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nAfter computing the aa array, construct the string s which is the output of the first part (the numbers separated by spaces). Then, process this string s as the input for the second part's logic.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the first part's output is stored in a character variable, then the second part's code uses that string as its input.\n\nNow, let's think about the second part's logic.\n\nThe second part reads a string, counts the frequency of each character, then checks how many have odd counts. If the number of odd counts is 0 or 1, or if it's even (wait, the Java code says: if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) then first else second. Wait, let me check the Java code again.\n\nLooking at the second Java code:\n\nThe code counts the number of characters with odd counts (oddCount). Then:\n\nif (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) {\n    writer.println(\"First\");\n} else {\n    writer.println(\"Second\");\n}\n\nWait, the condition is \"if oddCount is <=1 OR oddCount is odd (since mod 2 !=0)\". Wait, but oddCount can be even or odd. Let me see:\n\nSuppose oddCount is 0: then condition is true (<=1), so first.\n\nIf oddCount is 1: also true, so first.\n\nIf oddCount is 2: then 2 mod2 is 0, so the second part of the OR is false. So the condition is false, so else (Second).\n\nIf oddCount is 3: 3 mod2 is 1, so condition is true, so first.\n\nWait, so the condition is \"if the number of odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number (since mod2 !=0 includes odd numbers greater than 1). Wait, but 3 is odd, so mod2 !=0, so yes. So the condition is true when oddCount is even? Wait no, let me re-express:\n\nThe condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So:\n\n- If oddCount is 0: yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 first.\n\n- 2 \u2192 no (since 2>1 and even \u2192 condition is false \u2192 else (Second).\n\n- 3 \u2192 yes (odd \u2192 first).\n\n- 4 \u2192 even and >1 \u2192 condition false \u2192 second.\n\nSo the condition is true when oddCount is 0,1,3,5, etc. So the first player wins if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number greater than 1. Wait, but 0 is even, but the condition includes it. So the condition is equivalent to (oddCount is even? No, because 2 is even and condition is false. Hmm, perhaps the condition is equivalent to (oddCount is even? No, because 3 is odd and condition is true. Wait, the condition is (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd). So the only time it's false is when oddCount is even and greater than 1.\n\nSo the second part's logic is: if the number of characters with odd counts is 0,1, or any odd number (regardless of size), then first wins. Else (even and >1), second wins.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the second part's code can be written as:\n\n- Read the string (from the first part's output).\n\n- Count the frequency of each character.\n\n- Compute oddCount as the number of characters with odd counts.\n\n- If (oddCount <=1) or (mod(oddCount,2) ==1), then output \"First\", else \"Second\".\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nRead n and k, then the array bb.\n\nThen process the array to compute aa.\n\nThe loop in the first Java code is:\n\nfor (int a = n - 1; a >= 0; a--) {\n\n    int j = 0;\n\n    while (bb[a] > 0) {\n\n        if (aa[j] >= a + k) bb[a]--;\n\n        j++;\n\n    }\n\n    for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\n    aa[j] = a;\n\n}\n\nWait, the variables here are a (the current index from n-1 down to 0), and m is the current length of the array aa? Because initially m is 0, and after each iteration, m increments. So the array aa is being built in a way that each new element is inserted at position j, and the existing elements from j to m-1 are shifted right.\n\nWait, the code is a bit tricky. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nInitially, aa is an array of size n, but initially all elements are 0 (since it's initialized as new int[n]). But in the loop, for each a (starting from the end), we process:\n\nFirst, the while loop: while bb[a] >0, check if aa[j] >= a +k. If so, decrement bb[a], then j increments. So this loop runs until bb[a] becomes 0 or j reaches some point.\n\nWait, the while loop runs as long as bb[a] is positive. For each iteration, check if aa[j] is >= a +k. If yes, then decrement bb[a], then j increases. So this loop is trying to find how many times we can subtract 1 from bb[a] based on the current aa array up to j.\n\nWait, perhaps the purpose is to determine how many times the current a can be \"covered\" by existing elements in aa. The j starts at 0, and for each j, if aa[j] is >= a +k, then we can subtract one from bb[a], and continue until bb[a] is 0 or j exceeds some limit.\n\nWait, but the loop continues until bb[a] becomes 0. So the while loop will run until bb[a] is 0. Each time, if the current aa[j] (which is part of the array built so far) is >= a +k, then we can decrement bb[a], and move to next j. So this is counting how many times a can be \"covered\" by existing elements in aa.\n\nWait, but the j is incremented each time, so the loop is moving through the existing elements in aa. The while loop's condition is bb[a] >0, so it will keep going until bb[a] is 0. Each time, it checks the current j's aa[j] (but since aa is being built, maybe the existing elements are those before the current insertion point? Hmm, perhaps the logic is that for each a, we need to determine how many times it can be \"covered\" by existing elements in aa, and then insert it into the array at position j, shifting elements as needed.\n\nThis is a bit complex. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose n=3, k=1, and bb is [2,1,3].\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to proceed with the code translation, keeping the logic as per the Java code.\n\nIn Fortran, the variables:\n\n- n is an integer.\n\n- k is an integer.\n\n- bb is an array of integers, size n.\n\n- aa is an array of integers, size n.\n\n- m is an integer, starting at 0.\n\nThe loop over a from n-1 down to 0 (in Java). Since in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the original code uses 0-based indices, perhaps it's better to use 0-based arrays here. To do that, we can declare the arrays with a lower bound of 0.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: bb(:), aa(:)\n\nallocate(bb(0:n-1)), etc.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you allocate an array with allocate(bb(0:n-1)), that's possible. So first, read n and k, then allocate the arrays.\n\nNow, the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo a = n-1, 0, -1\n\n    j = 0\n\n    do while (bb(a) > 0)\n\n        if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n\n            bb(a) = bb(a) - 1\n\n        end if\n\n        j = j + 1\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, shift elements from m down to j\n\n    ! The original code does:\n\n    ! for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\n    ! Wait, the m is incremented after the loop?\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the for loop is:\n\n    for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\n    Wait, the m is incremented here. Let me parse this loop.\n\n    The loop variable j_ starts at m, then m is incremented. Wait, no, the syntax is for (int j_ = m++; ...). So the initialization part is m++: so first, j_ is assigned m, then m is incremented. So the initial value of j_ is the original m, and m becomes m+1.\n\n    Then, the loop runs while j_ > j, decrementing j_ each time. So the loop shifts the elements from position j down to m (the new m after increment) ?\n\n    Hmm, perhaps the code is shifting the elements from the current m down to j, so that the new element can be placed at position j.\n\n    Let me think of the Java code's variables:\n\n    The code has m as the current length of the array. Initially, m is 0. So when inserting a new element, the code first shifts elements from m down to j, then inserts at j, and increments m.\n\n    Wait, the code:\n\n    for (int j_ = m++; j_ > j; j_--) aa[j_] = aa[j_ - 1];\n\n    So the loop starts with j_ = m (original m), then m is incremented. Then, the loop runs while j_ > j, so moving from j_ down to j+1, shifting each element to the right by one.\n\n    Then, after the loop, aa[j] is set to a, and m is already incremented (because of m++ in the for loop's initialization).\n\n    So in Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\n    temp_m = m\n\n    m = m + 1\n\n    do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n        aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n    end do\n\n    aa(j) = a\n\n    Wait, but in the Java code, the for loop's j_ starts at m (before increment), then m is incremented. So the loop runs from j_ = m (original) down to j+1, shifting each element to the right. Then, after the loop, the m is now m+1, so the next insertion will start at that m.\n\n    So in Fortran, the code would be:\n\n    temp_m = m\n\n    m = m + 1\n\n    do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n        aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n    end do\n\n    aa(j) = a\n\n    Wait, but in the Java code, the for loop's j_ starts at m (original m), then m is incremented. So the loop runs from j_ = m (original) down to j+1, moving each element to the right. Then, after the loop, the m is now m+1, so the next insertion will start at that m.\n\n    So in Fortran, the code for the shifting part would be:\n\n    ! Save the current m before incrementing\n\n    temp_m = m\n\n    m = m + 1\n\n    ! Now, shift from temp_m down to j+1\n\n    do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n        aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now set the new element at position j\n\n    aa(j) = a\n\n    Wait, but in the Java code, the loop is for (j_ = m++; ...), so the m is incremented first. So the code in Java is:\n\n    m was, say, 3. Then j_ is set to 3, then m becomes 4. The loop runs from j_=3 down to j+1, shifting elements. Then, after the loop, m is 4, and the new element is placed at j.\n\n    So in Fortran, the code above does the same.\n\n    So putting this together, the loop over a in Fortran would be:\n\n    do a = n-1, 0, -1\n\n        j = 0\n\n        do while (bb(a) > 0)\n\n            if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n\n                bb(a) = bb(a) - 1\n\n            end if\n\n            j = j + 1\n\n        end do\n\n        ! Now shift elements\n\n        temp_m = m\n\n        m = m + 1\n\n        do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n            aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n        end do\n\n        aa(j) = a\n\n    end do\n\n    Wait, but in the Java code, the aa array is initially all zeros. So in Fortran, we need to initialize the aa array to zero before starting.\n\n    So before the loop, we should set all elements of aa to zero.\n\n    So:\n\n    allocate(aa(0:n-1))\n\n    aa = 0\n\n    m = 0\n\n    Then proceed with the loop.\n\n    Now, after processing all a's, the aa array is filled. Then, the first part's output is the elements of aa (each +1) separated by spaces.\n\n    So to generate the string s:\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i) + 1\n\n        s = trim(s) // temp_str // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    s = trim(adjustl(s)) // new_line('a')\n\n    Wait, but in Fortran, handling strings can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, we can build the string using a character array or a character variable with sufficient length.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to first collect all the numbers into an array, then build the string.\n\n    Alternatively, since the second part's input is the string generated by the first part, we can process the aa array directly without building the string, but that might not be possible because the second part's logic requires the entire string's characters.\n\n    Hmm, perhaps the best way is to create a character string that represents the output of the first part, then process that string as the input for the second part.\n\n    So in Fortran, after computing the aa array, we can create a character string s which is the concatenation of (aa(i)+1) followed by a space, for each i from 0 to n-1, then a newline.\n\n    To do this, we can use a character variable with enough length. Let's see:\n\n    The maximum possible length would be (number of elements) * (max digits per number +1) + 1 (for the newline). Since each number can be up to, say, 1e9, but in the problem's context, perhaps the numbers are manageable.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a character array of sufficient size. Let's assume that each number is at most 10 digits, so for n elements, each with 10 digits plus a space, plus a newline.\n\n    So:\n\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    s = trim(adjustl(s)) // new_line('a')\n\n    Wait, but the spaces between numbers are important. The first part's output is numbers separated by spaces, so the second part's input is that string. So the spaces are part of the input string.\n\n    Once the string s is built, then the second part's processing can be done on s.\n\n    Now, the second part's processing:\n\n    We need to count the frequency of each character in s (excluding the newline?), or including?\n\n    Wait, in the second Java code, the input is read as a string (the entire line). So the first part's output is a line of numbers separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The second Java code reads the entire line (including the newline?), but in the code, it reads the first line (since it uses readLine()).\n\n    Wait, in the second Java code, the input is read as a single line (since it's using readLine()), so the first part's output is a single line (the numbers plus a space-separated, then a newline). So the second part's input is exactly that line (including the newline?), but in the Java code, the newline is not part of the string because readLine() reads up to the newline but doesn't include it. So the string s in Fortran should not include the newline when processing.\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the first program's output is:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) print(aa[i] + 1 + \" \");\n\n    println();\n\n    So the output is the numbers separated by spaces, then a space at the end, then a newline. So the string s in Fortran should be the numbers separated by spaces, followed by a space and a newline. But when the second Java code reads it, it uses readLine(), which reads until the newline, but the newline is not part of the string. So the actual string is the numbers plus a trailing space, but the second part's code will process that.\n\n    Hmm, but in the second part's code, the string is processed as is. So in Fortran, the s should be exactly what the first part outputs (including the trailing space and newline?), but when readLine() is used, the newline is stripped. So in Fortran, the s should be the numbers separated by spaces, with a trailing space, and then a newline. But when the second part processes it, the newline is not part of the string. So perhaps in Fortran, the s should be the numbers separated by spaces, with a trailing space, and then the newline is part of the string but the second part's processing ignores it.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the second part's code in Java reads the entire line (including the trailing space and newline?), but readLine() returns the line without the newline. So the string s in Fortran should be the numbers separated by spaces, with a trailing space, but without the newline. Because when the second Java code reads it, it's the same as the first's output without the newline.\n\n    Wait, the first Java code's output is:\n\n    print(aa[i]+1 + \" \") for each i, then a println(). So the output is:\n\n    (number) (space) ... (number) (space) followed by a newline.\n\n    So the actual string is the numbers separated by spaces, with a trailing space, then a newline. The readLine() in the second Java code would read everything up to the newline, so the string is the numbers plus the trailing space. So in Fortran, the s should be the numbers plus the trailing space, and then the newline is part of the output but not part of the string.\n\n    Therefore, in Fortran, when building s, we can do:\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    s = trim(adjustl(s)) // ' '  ! Wait, but this adds an extra space?\n\n    Wait, let's see:\n\n    Suppose n=3, and the numbers are 1,2,3. Then the loop would do:\n\n    i=0: s becomes \"1 \" (temp_str is \"1\", then \"1 \").\n\n    i=1: s becomes \"1 2 \".\n\n    i=2: s becomes \"1 2 3 \".\n\n    So after the loop, s is \"1 2 3 \" (with a trailing space). Then, the println() adds a newline. So the actual string read by the second part is \"1 2 3 \" (with the trailing space). So in Fortran, the s should be \"1 2 3 \" (with the trailing space).\n\n    So the code in Fortran can be:\n\n    allocate character(len=...) s.\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Remove the trailing space? Or leave it?\n\n    Wait, the first Java code's output includes the trailing space. So the second part's input has that trailing space. So we need to keep it.\n\n    So the s is built correctly.\n\n    Now, processing the string s in the second part.\n\n    The second part's logic is:\n\n    - Count the frequency of each character in s (excluding the newline?).\n\n    Wait, in the first part's output, the s includes the trailing space and the newline? Or not?\n\n    Wait, in the first Java code, after the loop, it does a println(), which adds a newline. So the entire output is the numbers separated by spaces, then a space, then a newline. So the string s in Fortran should include the newline? Or not?\n\n    Wait, the second Java code reads the input using readLine(), which reads until the newline, but does not include the newline in the string. So the string s in Fortran should be the numbers plus the trailing space, without the newline. Because the newline is the termination of the line, but not part of the string.\n\n    Therefore, in Fortran, when building s, we should not include the newline. So the code should be:\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, s has a trailing space. That's okay.\n\n    So the s is the correct string.\n\n    Now, processing this s:\n\n    We need to count the frequency of each character in s (excluding the newline, since it's not part of the string).\n\n    So in Fortran:\n\n    ! Initialize a frequency array for each character.\n\n    ! Since characters can be any ASCII, but in the first part's output, the characters are digits and spaces.\n\n    ! Let's use a dictionary-like structure. Since Fortran doesn't have a hashmap, we can use an array for each possible ASCII character.\n\n    integer, dimension(256) :: freq = 0\n\n    integer :: i, c\n\n    character(len=1) :: ch\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n        ch = s(i:i)\n\n        c = ichar(ch)\n\n        freq(c) = freq(c) + 1\n\n    end do\n\n    Then, count the number of characters with odd counts.\n\n    integer :: oddCount = 0\n\n    do c = 0, 255\n\n        if (mod(freq(c),2) == 1) then\n\n            oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    Then, decide the output based on oddCount.\n\n    if ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) ==1) ) then\n\n        print *, 'First'\n\n    else\n\n        print *, 'Second'\n\n    end if\n\n    Wait, but in the Java code, the condition is:\n\n    if (oddCount <=1 || oddCount %2 !=0) \u2192 which is the same as (oddCount <=1) OR (oddCount is odd).\n\n    So in Fortran, the condition is:\n\n    if ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) ==1) ) then \u2192 yes.\n\n    So that's correct.\n\n    Now, putting all together in Fortran code.\n\n    Now, handling the arrays:\n\n    The first part requires reading n, then the array bb of size n.\n\n    So steps:\n\n    1. Read n and k from input.\n\n    2. Read n integers into bb array (0-based).\n\n    3. Initialize aa array (0-based) to zero, m=0.\n\n    4. Process the loop over a from n-1 downto 0.\n\n    5. After processing, build the string s.\n\n    6. Process s to count frequencies.\n\n    7. Output the result.\n\n    Now, in Fortran code:\n\n    program main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, k, i, a, j, temp_m, m, j_, c, oddCount\n\n    integer, allocatable :: bb(:), aa(:)\n\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n\n    character(len=1) :: ch\n\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: freq = 0\n\n    ! Read n and k\n\n    read*, n, k\n\n    ! Allocate arrays\n\n    allocate(bb(0:n-1), aa(0:n-1))\n\n    ! Read bb array\n\n    read*, bb(0:n-1)\n\n    ! Initialize aa and m\n\n    aa = 0\n\n    m = 0\n\n    ! Process the first part's loop\n\n    do a = n-1, 0, -1\n\n        j = 0\n\n        do while (bb(a) > 0)\n\n            if (aa(j) >= a + k) then\n\n                bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n            end if\n\n            j = j +1\n\n        end do\n\n        ! Now shift elements\n\n        temp_m = m\n\n        m = m +1\n\n        do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n            aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n        end do\n\n        aa(j) = a\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Build the string s\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(ch, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(ch) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Remove trailing space? Or leave it as per first part's output.\n\n    ! The first part's output has a trailing space, so we leave it.\n\n    ! Now process the string s for the second part.\n\n    ! Initialize frequency array\n\n    freq = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n        ch = s(i:i)\n\n        c = ichar(ch)\n\n        freq(c) = freq(c) +1\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Count odd counts\n\n    oddCount = 0\n\n    do c = 0, 255\n\n        if (mod(freq(c),2) ==1) then\n\n            oddCount = oddCount +1\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Decide output\n\n    if ( (oddCount <=1) .or. (mod(oddCount,2) ==1) ) then\n\n        print*, 'First'\n\n    else\n\n        print*, 'Second'\n\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(bb, aa)\n\n    end program main\n\n    Wait, but in the code above, when building the string s, the loop over i from 0 to n-1 (since aa is 0-based). Each iteration appends the string of (aa(i)+1) followed by a space.\n\n    However, in the code above, the line:\n\n    write(ch, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n    But ch is a character of length 1, which can't hold numbers longer than 1 digit. Oh, that's a problem.\n\n    Oh right! The variable ch here is only length 1, so writing a number like 123 into it would cause an error. So I need to use a temporary string variable of sufficient length.\n\n    So I need to use a temporary character variable with enough length to hold the number.\n\n    Let me adjust that part.\n\n    Let's declare a temporary character variable, say temp_str, of length 20 (to handle large numbers).\n\n    So:\n\n    character(len=20) :: temp_str\n\n    Then, in the loop:\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    That should work.\n\n    Also, in the code above, the initial s is an empty string. The first iteration appends the first number and a space. The second appends the next number and space, etc. So the final s will have a trailing space, which is correct.\n\n    Also, the frequency array is dimensioned from 0 to 255, which covers all ASCII characters (since ASCII is 0-255). So that's okay.\n\n    Now, testing edge cases.\n\n    Let me think of a test case.\n\n    Suppose first part's input is n=3, k=1, and bb = [2,1,3].\n\n    Then, after processing, what is the aa array?\n\n    Let me walk through the first part's code.\n\n    Let me see:\n\n    Initial aa is all zeros, m=0.\n\n    a starts from 2 (since n-1=2), then 1, then 0.\n\n    Let's process a=2 (the last element):\n\n    bb[2] is 3.\n\n    j starts at 0.\n\n    while bb[2] >0 (3>0):\n\n        check if aa[0] (0) >= 2 +1 (3). 0 >=3? No. So no decrement.\n\n        j increments to 1.\n\n    Next iteration of while loop:\n\n    bb[2] is still 3.\n\n    check aa[1] (0) >=3? No. j=2.\n\n    aa[2] is 0 <3 \u2192 j=3.\n\n    Now, since the array aa is size 3 (0-based), but m is 0. So when j reaches 3, which is beyond the current m (0), but the loop continues until bb[a] is 0.\n\n    Wait, the while loop continues until bb[a] becomes 0. But in this case, the condition in the if statement is never true (since aa[j] is 0 for all j up to m (0)), so the bb[a] remains 3. So the loop will run until j exceeds the array's size?\n\n    Wait, the array aa is size n (3 elements, 0-based). So when j reaches 3, which is beyond the array's indices (0,1,2), then accessing aa(3) would be out of bounds. Oh, this is a problem in the Java code.\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the aa array is initialized to size n. The loop for j starts at 0 and increments until the while loop ends. But in the code, the while loop runs as long as bb[a] >0. But if the aa array's elements are not sufficient to cover the required decrements, then the loop will run indefinitely?\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the while loop's condition is bb[a] >0. The loop can only terminate if bb[a] reaches 0. But in the case where the aa array's elements are not sufficient to allow the decrements, then the loop will run forever.\n\n    Wait, but in the code, the while loop's body has:\n\n    if (aa[j] >= a +k) then decrement bb[a], else do nothing. Then j increments.\n\n    So, if the aa[j] is not >= a+k, then the bb[a] is not decremented, so the loop continues until j exceeds the array's length?\n\n    Wait, the array aa is of size n, but in the loop, j can go up to n, which is beyond the array's indices (since it's 0-based, indices 0 to n-1). So in Java, this would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\n    Oh no! That's a problem. So the original Java code has a bug here?\n\n    Wait, looking back at the first Java code:\n\n    The code has:\n\n    for (int a = n - 1; a >= 0; a--) {\n\n        int j = 0;\n\n        while (bb[a] > 0) {\n\n            if (aa[j] >= a + k) bb[a]--;\n\n            j++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    The array aa is initialized as new int[n], so indices 0 to n-1. The j increments until it reaches n, which is beyond the array's bounds. So this is a bug in the Java code. But perhaps the code is written with the assumption that the loop will terminate before j exceeds the array's size?\n\n    Wait, perhaps the logic is that the while loop will eventually terminate because the bb[a] will be decremented enough times. But in cases where it's not, the code will crash.\n\n    Hmm, this is a problem. But since the user provided the code, I have to assume that the code is correct and that the loop terminates. Perhaps there's an implicit assumption that the while loop will terminate before j exceeds the array's size.\n\n    Alternatively, maybe the code is correct because the aa array is being built in a way that allows the loop to terminate.\n\n    Let me think of the example where a=2, n=3, k=1, and bb[a] =3.\n\n    The initial aa array is all zeros. So when j=0,1,2:\n\n    aa[0] =0 <3 \u2192 no decrement.\n\n    j increments to 3.\n\n    Now, the while loop continues because bb[a] is still 3. But j is now 3, which is beyond the array's indices (0-2). So accessing aa[3] would be out of bounds.\n\n    So the Java code has a bug here. But since the user provided this code, perhaps I have to replicate it exactly, including the bug?\n\n    Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's logic.\n\n    Alternatively, maybe the code is correct because the loop will terminate when j reaches m, but m is being incremented in the loop.\n\n    Wait, the code's loop for j starts at 0 and increments until the while loop ends. The while loop's condition is bb[a] >0. The only way the loop can terminate is if bb[a] reaches 0. But in the case where the aa array's elements are not sufficient to allow the decrements, then the loop will run indefinitely.\n\n    This suggests that the code has a bug. But since the user provided it, I have to proceed as per the code.\n\n    Perhaps the code is correct because the aa array is being built in a way that ensures that eventually, the bb[a] will be decremented to zero.\n\n    Alternatively, maybe the code is intended to have j run up to m, but m is being tracked.\n\n    Wait, perhaps the code is designed such that the while loop runs until j reaches m, but I'm not sure.\n\n    This is a problem. Since I have to translate the code as is, I'll proceed with the Fortran code as written, but in the code, the array aa is of size n (0-based to n-1). So in Fortran, when j reaches n, accessing aa(j) would be out of bounds. So I need to ensure that in the while loop, j does not exceed n-1.\n\n    Wait, in the Java code, the array is size n, so indices 0 to n-1. So when j reaches n, it's out of bounds. So the code is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the code has a bug, but I have to replicate it.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the while loop will terminate before j reaches n.\n\n    Let me think of the code's logic again.\n\n    The while loop runs while bb[a] >0. Each iteration, j increments. The only way the loop can terminate is if bb[a] becomes 0. The only way that can happen is if the if condition is true (aa[j] >= a +k), which allows bb[a] to be decremented.\n\n    So, for the loop to terminate, there must be some j where aa[j] >= a +k, allowing the decrement.\n\n    But in the example I thought of earlier (a=2, k=1, so a+k=3), and aa is all zeros, then the condition is never true, so the loop runs forever.\n\n    So the code has a bug. But since the user provided it, perhaps I should proceed with the code as is, and in the Fortran code, the same bug will exist.\n\n    Therefore, in the Fortran code, the while loop will have the same problem. So I have to proceed.\n\n    Now, in the Fortran code, the array aa is 0-based with size n. So when j reaches n, accessing aa(j) is out of bounds. So in the while loop, we need to ensure that j does not exceed n-1.\n\n    Wait, in the code:\n\n    do while (bb(a) >0)\n\n        if (aa(j) >= a +k) then\n\n            bb(a) = bb(a) -1\n\n        end if\n\n        j = j +1\n\n    end do\n\n    So j increments each time, but there's no check on j exceeding the array's size. So in Fortran, this will cause an out-of-bounds error when j reaches n.\n\n    To replicate the Java code's behavior (which also has this bug), the Fortran code must also have this bug. So I can't add a check here.\n\n    Therefore, the code will have the same problem as the Java code. But since the user provided the code, I have to proceed.\n\n    Now, proceeding to write the Fortran code with the corrections for the temp_str variable.\n\n    So the corrected code would be:\n\n    program main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, k, i, a, j, temp_m, m, j_, c, oddCount\n\n    integer, allocatable :: bb(:), aa(:)\n\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n\n    character(len=20) :: temp_str\n\n    character(len=1) :: ch\n\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: freq = 0\n\n    !

Now shift elements\n\n        temp_m = m\n\n        m = m +1\n\n        do j_ = temp_m, j+1, -1\n\n            aa(j_) = aa(j_-1)\n\n        end do\n\n        aa(j) = a\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Build the string s\n\n    s = ''\n\n    do i = 0, n-1\n\n        write(temp_str, '(I0)') aa(i)+1\n\n        s = trim(s) // trim(temp_str) // ' '\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Process the string s for the second part.\n\n    ! Initialize frequency array\n\n    freq = 0\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n        ch = s(i:i)\n\n        c = ichar(ch)\n\n        freq(c) = freq(c) +1\n\n    end do\n\n    !

Decide output\n\n    if ( (oddCount <=1) .or.
