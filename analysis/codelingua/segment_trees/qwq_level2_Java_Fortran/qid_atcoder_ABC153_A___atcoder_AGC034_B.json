But in code, the loop is h starts at h, and subtract a each time until h <=0. So the number of steps is ceiling(h/a). So in Fortran, perhaps we can compute it as (h + a -1)/a, but since in code it's a loop, maybe better to do the loop. But in Fortran, loops can be done with a do loop. So code for first part:\n\nRead h and a.\n\nnum =0\n\ndo while (h >0) h = h -a\n\n   num = num +1\n\nend do But wait, in the Java code, the loop is written as for (i=1; h>0; i++), but the loop body subtracts a and increments num. So the loop runs as long as h>0. So the loop continues until h becomes <=0. So the code in Fortran is correct. Second part: processing the string s (the string representation of num).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (atcoder_ABC153_A):\n\nIt reads two integers h and a from input. Then it calculates how many times you subtract a from h until h becomes <=0. The result is the number of steps, which is printed. So the loop is h = h - a each iteration, incrementing num until h <=0. The output is num.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_AGC034_B):\n\nIt reads a string, replaces all \"BC\" with \"D\". Then it counts the number of \"A\" followed by \"D\" pairs in a certain way. The logic is: whenever there's an 'A', tmp increments. When a 'D' is found, add tmp to cnt. Other characters reset tmp to 0. The final cnt is printed.\n\nNow, the Fortran program must read input once (from the first program's input), process both steps without I/O in between, and output the final result of the second step.\n\nFirst, the input for the first program is two integers h and a. The output of the first is num, which is then the input for the second program? Wait, no. Wait, the original setup is that the first program's output is the input for the second. Wait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the Java code:\n\nWait, the first program reads h and a from input, computes num, and prints it. Then the second program would take that num as input? Wait, no, looking at the second Java program, it reads a string via in.next(). So perhaps the first program's output is a number, but the second expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, where the output of each is the input to the next. So the first program's output (the num) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (since it uses in.next() which reads a token, probably a string). Wait, but that would mean that the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program as a string. So the second program would process that number as a string? That might not make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code: the first program's input is two integers h and a. The output is the number of steps, which is an integer. The second program's input is a string (since it uses in.next() which reads a token, which is a string). So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program as a string. So the second program would process that integer as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 5, then the second program's input is \"5\", so the string would be \"5\", and the processing would be on that string. But in the second Java code, the code is replacing \"BC\" with \"D\", but in the input \"5\", there are no BC's, so the output would be 0. Hmm, but maybe the actual problem requires that the second program's input is the output of the first, but perhaps the actual problem's test cases are such that the first's output is a number, and the second's input is a string. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the first program's output is the input to the second program. So the first program's output is a number (num), which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a string (the input is that number as a string). So for example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", and processes that string. The second program's code is looking for \"BC\" in the string, which would not be present, so the output would be 0. But maybe the actual problem's test cases are different. However, the user's instruction is to translate the sequence as given, so I have to follow the code as written.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is in a class called BABC, which is part of AGC034_B. The code for the second program reads a string via in.next(). So the input to the second program is a single token (a string). The first program's output is a number, so when the first program's output is piped into the second, the second will read that number as a string. So the second program's processing is on that string.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, the first step is to read the two integers h and a, compute num (the first program's output), then process that num as the input string for the second program's logic.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the num from the first step to the second step in Fortran? Since it's all in one program, I can just compute the first part, store the result, then use that result as the input for the second part's processing.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read h and a from input.\n\n2. Compute num as the first program does (loop until h <=0, subtract a each time, count steps).\n\n3. Take that num, convert it to a string (since the second program's input is a string), then process that string through the second program's logic.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string, so the first program's output (num) is the input to the second. So in Fortran, after computing num, we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the second program's algorithm.\n\nSo the second part's processing is on the string representation of num.\n\nTherefore, the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read h and a from input.\n\n- Compute num (the first part's result).\n\n- Convert num to a string s.\n\n- Process s through the second part's algorithm (the BC replacement and counting).\n\n- Output the final count from the second part.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first part is straightforward. Read two integers h and a. Then compute how many times you subtract a from h until h <=0. The loop in Java is:\n\nint num =0;\n\nfor (int i=1; h>0; i++) {\n\n   h -=a;\n\n   num++;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the loop runs as long as h>0. Each iteration subtracts a, then increments num. So the number of steps is ceiling(h/a) ?\n\nWait, let's see: suppose h=5, a=2. Then steps:\n\nStart h=5, a=2.\n\nFirst iteration: h=5-2=3, num=1.\n\nSecond: h=1, num=2.\n\nThird: h=1-2 = -1, num=3. So yes, 3 steps. So it's effectively (h +a -1)/a, integer division.\n\nBut in code, the loop is h starts at h, and subtract a each time until h <=0. So the number of steps is ceiling(h/a). So in Fortran, perhaps we can compute it as (h + a -1)/a, but since in code it's a loop, maybe better to do the loop.\n\nBut in Fortran, loops can be done with a do loop.\n\nSo code for first part:\n\nRead h and a.\n\nnum =0\n\ndo while (h >0)\n\n   h = h -a\n\n   num = num +1\n\nend do\n\nBut wait, in the Java code, the loop is written as for (i=1; h>0; i++), but the loop body subtracts a and increments num. So the loop runs as long as h>0. So the loop continues until h becomes <=0. So the code in Fortran is correct.\n\nSecond part: processing the string s (the string representation of num).\n\nThe second part's algorithm is:\n\nReplace all \"BC\" with \"D\" in the string s.\n\nThen, iterate over each character, tracking 'A's and 'D's (which are BC pairs).\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\nFor each character in the modified string:\n\nif the char is 'A', then tmp +=1.\n\nif it's 'D', then cnt += tmp.\n\nelse (any other character), set tmp to 0.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\ns = s.replaceAll(\"BC\", \"D\");\n\nThen loops through each character:\n\nif (char is 'A') \u2192 tmp++\n\nelse if (char is 'D') \u2192 cnt += tmp\n\nelse \u2192 tmp=0.\n\nWait, the else clause is for any other character (including not A or D). So whenever a non-A and non-D is encountered, tmp is reset to 0.\n\nWait, in the code, the else is for all other cases. So for example, if the character is 'B', then tmp becomes 0.\n\nSo in the modified string (after replacing BC with D), the processing is:\n\nfor each character in s:\n\n   if 'A' \u2192 tmp +=1\n\n   else if 'D' \u2192 cnt += tmp\n\n   else \u2192 tmp =0\n\nSo in Fortran, need to process the string after replacing all \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nFirst, the string s is the string representation of num. So in Fortran, after computing num, we can write s = trim(adjustl( num )). Wait, in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done with write statements into a character variable.\n\nSo first, after computing num, we need to convert it to a string. Let's see:\n\nWe can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') num\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nThen, process s by replacing all occurrences of \"BC\" with \"D\".\n\nHmm, replacing \"BC\" with \"D\" in the string. How to do that in Fortran?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. In Fortran, string manipulation is a bit more involved. Let's think.\n\nThe first step is to find all occurrences of \"BC\" in the string and replace them with \"D\".\n\nOne approach is to loop through the string, check for \"BC\" starting at each position, and replace when found. But need to be careful with overlapping replacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can loop through the string from the start, and whenever we find \"BC\", replace it with \"D\", then adjust the index appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the replacement is only for \"BC\" to \"D\", perhaps we can process the string character by character, keeping track of the previous character.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nInitialize a new string (result) as empty.\n\nLoop over each character in the original string s:\n\n   if the current character is 'C' and the previous character was 'B', then instead of adding 'B' and 'C', we add 'D' and skip the next character?\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to loop through the original string, and whenever we find a 'B' followed by 'C', replace them with 'D', and skip the next character.\n\nLet me think of an algorithm:\n\nInitialize a new string (modified_str) as empty.\n\nInitialize an index i from 1 to len_trim(s).\n\nLoop over i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\n   if (i < len_trim(s) and s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n       append 'D' to modified_str\n\n       i = i +1  ! skip the next character\n\n   else\n\n       append s(i) to modified_str\n\n   end if\n\nThis way, whenever \"BC\" is found, it's replaced by 'D', and the next character is skipped.\n\nThis should handle all occurrences.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, modified_s\n\nmodified_s = ''\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n   if (i <= len_s -1) then\n\n      if (s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n          modified_s = trim(modified_s) // 'D'\n\n          i = i +1\n\n          cycle\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   modified_s = trim(modified_s) // s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation can be done with //, but we have to manage the length properly. Also, the modified_s needs to be a character array of sufficient length. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array for modified_s and building it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character variable with a length sufficient to hold the modified string. Since the original s is up to, say, 20 characters (since num can be up to, say, 1e18, but in the first program, h and a can be up to... Well, in Java, integers are 32-bit, so h can be up to 2e9, a=1, so num would be 2e9, which is 10 digits. So 20 is enough.\n\nSo the code for replacing \"BC\" with \"D\" can be done as above.\n\nOnce the modified_s is built, then process it to compute cnt and tmp.\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\nLoop over each character in modified_s:\n\n   c = modified_s(j:j)\n\n   if (c == 'A') then\n\n       tmp = tmp +1\n\n   else if (c == 'D') then\n\n       cnt = cnt + tmp\n\n   else\n\n       tmp =0\n\n   end if\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the else clause is for any other character, so yes, reset tmp to 0.\n\nSo the loop over each character in modified_s:\n\ndo j=1, len_trim(modified_s)\n\n   c = modified_s(j:j)\n\n   if (c == 'A') then\n\n       tmp = tmp +1\n\n   else if (c == 'D') then\n\n       cnt = cnt + tmp\n\n   else\n\n       tmp =0\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all steps into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read h and a from input.\n\n2. Compute num via the loop.\n\n3. Convert num to a string s.\n\n4. Process s to replace \"BC\" with \"D\" \u2192 modified_s.\n\n5. Process modified_s to compute cnt.\n\n6. Output cnt.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: h, a, num, cnt, tmp\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s, modified_s\n\nThen, read h and a:\n\nread*, h, a\n\nCompute num:\n\nnum =0\n\ndo while (h >0)\n\n   h = h -a\n\n   num = num +1\n\nend do\n\nConvert num to string s:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') num\n\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nNow, process s to create modified_s.\n\nmodified_s = ''\n\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n   if (i <= len_s -1) then\n\n      if (s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n          modified_s = trim(modified_s) // 'D'\n\n          i = i +1\n\n          cycle\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   modified_s = trim(modified_s) // s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you do trim(modified_s) // s(i:i), the trim is necessary because when you append, the previous string may have trailing spaces. However, since modified_s starts as an empty string and we are building it step by step, perhaps the trim is not needed here. Let me think:\n\nInitially, modified_s is an empty string (all spaces?), but when we do trim(modified_s), it becomes an empty string. Then appending 'D' would make it 'D', etc. So perhaps the trim is not needed here. Alternatively, perhaps better to use a character array with a fixed length and track the current length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character array with a length of 20, and building it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Let me think of the code again.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you do:\n\nmodified_s = modified_s // s(i:i)\n\nthe left-hand side is a character variable of length 20. The right-hand side is the concatenation. Since modified_s is initially empty (all spaces?), but when you do trim(modified_s), it removes leading spaces. Hmm, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nmodified_s = ''\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n   if (i <= len_s -1) then\n\n      if (s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n          modified_s = trim(modified_s) // 'D'\n\n          i = i +1\n\n          cycle\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   modified_s = trim(modified_s) // s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the trim is applied to modified_s before appending. However, since modified_s is being built step by step, each time we append, the previous content is already the trimmed version. Wait, perhaps the trim is not needed here. Let me see:\n\nSuppose modified_s is initially empty (all spaces). Then, the first time, when we do modified_s = modified_s // 'D', the left side is the empty string (trimmed to nothing), so the result is 'D' followed by spaces? Or does the assignment take the left-hand side's length into account?\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is error-prone. Maybe a better way is to use a character array and track the current length.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define modified_s as a character array of length 20, and have a variable current_length to track the current length.\n\ninteger :: current_length =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: modified_s = ''\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n   if (i <= len_s -1) then\n\n      if (s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n          current_length = current_length +1\n\n          modified_s(current_length:current_length) = 'D'\n\n          i = i +1\n\n          cycle\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   current_length = current_length +1\n\n   modified_s(current_length:current_length) = s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nmodified_s = modified_s(1:current_length)\n\nThis way, we track the current length and build the string step by step. This might be more reliable.\n\nYes, this approach is better. So:\n\nInitialize modified_s as a 20-length string, all spaces, but we track current_length.\n\ncurrent_length starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nif the current and next characters are BC:\n\n   add 'D' to modified_s at current_length+1, increment current_length by 1.\n\n   skip the next character (i +=1)\n\nelse:\n\n   add current character to modified_s, increment current_length.\n\nThis way, the modified_s is built correctly.\n\nSo code:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: modified_s\n\ninteger :: current_length =0\n\nmodified_s = ' '  ! Initialize to spaces, but current_length is 0.\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n\n   if (i <= len_s -1) then\n\n      if (s(i:i+1) == 'BC') then\n\n          current_length = current_length +1\n\n          modified_s(current_length:current_length) = 'D'\n\n          i = i +1\n\n          cycle\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   current_length = current_length +1\n\n   modified_s(current_length:current_length) = s(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nmodified_s = modified_s(1:current_length)\n\nThis should handle the replacement correctly.\n\nOnce modified_s is built, then process it to compute cnt and tmp.\n\nInitialize cnt=0, tmp=0.\n\ndo j=1, current_length\n\n   c = modified_s(j:j)\n\n   if (c == 'A') then\n\n       tmp = tmp +1\n\n   else if (c == 'D') then\n\n       cnt = cnt + tmp\n\n   else\n\n       tmp =0\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nFinally, output cnt.\n\nprint*, cnt\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nThe full Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: h, a, num, cnt, tmp, i, len_s, current_length\n  character(len=20) :: s, modified_s\n\n  !

Output the result\n  print*, cnt\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for processing modified_s, I used i again. Since i is already used in the previous loop, but in Fortran, variables are block-scoped? No, in Fortran, variables are local to the program unit unless specified otherwise. Since this is all in the main program, variables are in the same scope. So using i again in the loop for processing modified_s would conflict with the i from the previous loop. So need to use a different variable, like j.\n\nAh, right. So in the processing loop, change the loop variable to j.\n\nSo:\n\ndo j=1, current_length\n\n   c = modified_s(j:j)\n\n   if (c == 'A') then\n\n       tmp = tmp +1\n\n   else if (c == 'D') then\n\n       cnt = cnt + tmp\n\n   else\n\n       tmp =0\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: h, a, num, cnt, tmp, i, j, len_s, current_length\n  character(len=20) :: s, modified_s\n\n  !

Output the result\n  print*, cnt\n\nend program main\n\nNow, check for possible issues.\n\nFirst, in the replacement loop, when replacing \"BC\" with \"D\", the code skips the next character (i +=1). That should work.\n\nSecond, when building modified_s, the current_length starts at 0, and each time a character is added, it increments. The modified_s is then trimmed to current_length.\n\nThird, in the processing loop, the characters are checked for 'A', 'D', else reset tmp.\n\nNow, test case examples.\n\nTest case 1 for first program:\n\nInput: 5 2 \u2192 num is 3 (since 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 3 steps).\n\nThen the second program's input is \"3\".\n\nProcessing \"3\" \u2192 no BC, so modified_s is \"3\".\n\nThen processing each character:\n\nThe first character is '3', which is not A or D \u2192 tmp becomes 0. So cnt remains 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose first program's output is 123 \u2192 the string is \"123\".\n\nNo BC \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother test case where the second program's input has BC.\n\nSuppose first program's output is 12 \u2192 string is \"12\".\n\nNo BC \u2192 output 0.\n\nAnother example where the first program's output is 1234 \u2192 \"1234\" \u2192 no BC \u2192 0.\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is 123456, but the string is \"BC\" \u2192 but that would require the first program's output to be 67 (since 'B' is not a digit). Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so the string can only contain digits. So the second program's processing will never find \"BC\" in the input, so the output will always be 0?\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the second program's code is designed to process a string that may have letters like 'A', 'B', 'C', but in this setup, the input to the second program is a number, so the string is all digits. So the second program's output will always be 0. But that's according to the code given. The user's instruction is to translate the sequence as given, so even if the second program's output is always zero, that's what the code does.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the actual problem requires that the first program's output is a string, but the code given is different. But according to the code provided, the first program outputs a number, and the second reads a string (the number as a string), so the code is correct as per the problem's given Java code.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is correct as per the given Java code.\n\nAnother test case for the first program:\n\nh=3, a=3 \u2192 steps: 1 (3-3=0 \u2192 loop runs once). So num=1 \u2192 string is \"1\". The second program's processing gives 0.\n\nAnother test case where the first program's output is \"ABCD\" \u2192 but that's impossible because the first program outputs a number. So the second program's input is always a numeric string, so no BC pairs. So the output is 0.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the user intended that the first program's output is the input to the second program's input, but the second program's input is a string, so the first program's output is a number, which is converted to a string. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as written should work."
