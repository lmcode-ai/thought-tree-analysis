    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_222_A. It reads two integers n and k, then a sequence of n integers. It tracks the current number and counts consecutive duplicates. The variable 'c' keeps the current streak. If the next number is the same as the last (l), it increments c, else resets to 1. After processing all numbers, it checks if c + k exceeds n. If so, output n - c, else -1. So the output here is an integer that's either n - c or -1.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC114_C, reads N, then starts with i=357. It counts how many numbers up to N contain at least one 3, 5, and 7. But there's also a loop generating next numbers by some transformation. Wait, the code is a bit more complex. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe second program's main loop starts with i=357. Then, while i <= N, it checks if the number contains 3,5,7. If yes, increments count. Then, it builds a new number by processing each digit. The transformation seems to be modifying the digits in a way. Let me see the code:\n\nThe code uses a string of the current i. Then, for each character in reverse (since it's processing from the end?), it builds a new string. The logic is: if 'f' is false, then for each digit, if it's 3, replace with 5 and set f to true. If it's 5, replace with 7 and set f. Else, just put 3. If after processing all digits, f is still false, append a 3. Then reverse the string to get the next i. Wait, the code uses a StringBuilder, and the loop is over the digits in reverse order? Let me see:\n\nThe loop for j from 0 to s.length()-1, but the character is taken from s.length()-1 -j, so that's the reverse order. So processing digits from the end to the start. The 'f' flag is whether we've made a change yet. The first time we hit a 3 or 5, we replace it with 5 or 7, set f to true, and subsequent digits are kept as is. If none of the digits were 3 or 5, then after the loop, we append a 3. Then the new number is formed by reversing the string (since the digits were built in reverse order?), so the next i is the parsed value of the reversed string.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The transformation is generating the next number in a sequence by modifying the digits in a certain way. The loop continues until i exceeds N, counting numbers that have all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nThe first program's output is the input for the second? Wait, the problem says the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program's output is either n - c or -1, which is an integer. The second program expects N as input. So the first program's output is the N for the second program?\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is either n - c or -1, which is an integer. The second program's first input is N, which is read via gi(). So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the second program's N is the first's output. So the first program's output is the input to the second.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the input for the first program (the original input to the first Java program), process both steps, and output the second program's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n, k, then n integers).\n\n2. Process the first part (the codeforces problem) to compute the output (either n - c or -1).\n\n3. Use that result as the input N for the second part (the atcoder problem).\n\n4. Process the second part with N as the computed value from step 2, and output the result of the second part.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part.\n\nFirst Java program's logic:\n\nRead n, k, then n integers. Track the last number (l) and current count (c). For each a in the sequence:\n\nif a == l, then c +=1, else c=1. Then l = a.\n\nAt the end, if c +k >n, output n -c, else -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, variables:\n\nWe need to read n and k first. Then read n integers into an array. Then process the array to find the maximum consecutive sequence?\n\nWait, actually, the code is tracking the current streak. The variable c holds the current streak length. The maximum streak isn't needed, but at the end, the last streak's c is used. Because the code only keeps track of the current streak. So after processing all elements, the last c is the length of the last consecutive sequence. Then, the condition is whether adding k to that c would exceed n. So the output is n - c if possible, else -1.\n\nWait, let me recheck the code:\n\nThe code's final condition is:\n\nif (c + k > n) System.out.println(n - c);\n\nelse System.out.println(-1);\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the idea is that if the current streak plus k exceeds n, then the answer is n - c. Otherwise, -1. So the first program's output is either n - c or -1.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part can be done by:\n\nRead n, k, then the array of a's.\n\nInitialize l as the first element, c as 1? Wait, no. Let's see the Java code's initial variables:\n\nint l =0, c=1. Wait, initial l is 0, but the first a is read, then:\n\nif a == l (which is 0 initially), then c +=1. But the first a is the first element. Wait, the loop starts with i=0 to n-1, so for the first iteration, a is the first element. The initial l is 0, so unless the first a is 0, c will be set to 1. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nInitially, l is 0, c is 1. Then, for each a in the loop:\n\nif a == l, then c +=1, else c =1.\n\nWait, but the first a is the first element. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first a is 5. Then since 5 != 0 (l's initial value), c becomes 1, and l is set to 5. So the first element's c is 1. Then next element, if same as previous (5), c becomes 2, etc.\n\nWait, the initial c is 1, but the first a is compared to l (0). So unless the first a is 0, the c will reset to 1. So the initial c is 1, but the first iteration may reset it. Hmm, perhaps the code is correct, but in Fortran, we need to replicate that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is written with l initialized to 0, and c to 1. Then, for the first a, if it's equal to l (0), then c becomes 2. Otherwise, c is set to 1. Then l is set to a. So the first element's c is either 2 (if a is 0) or 1 (otherwise). So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, we can do:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nThen read an array of n integers, say arr(1:n).\n\nInitialize l = 0, c =1.\n\nThen loop over each element in arr:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   a = arr(i)\n\n   if (a == l) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   else\n\n      c =1\n\n   end if\n\n   l = a\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is from i=0 to n-1, so the indices are 0-based. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first a is the first element (i=0), so in Fortran, the first element is arr(1). So the loop is correct.\n\nAfter processing all elements, check if c +k >n. Then output n -c or -1.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow the second part: the second Java program takes N (the output of first part) and counts numbers up to N that contain at least one 3,5,7, and also follow some generation process?\n\nWait, the second program's code is a bit more involved. Let me re-examine it.\n\nThe second program's main function:\n\nReads N via gi().\n\nThen starts with i=357.\n\nThen loops while i <= N:\n\n   convert i to string s.\n\n   check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment count c.\n\n   Then generate the next i via some transformation.\n\nThe transformation is done via the code with the stringbuilder.\n\nThe transformation process:\n\nThe code builds a new string by processing each character in reverse order (since the loop is over s.length()-1 -j, so starting from the last character and moving backward). The 'f' flag is initially false.\n\nFor each character in the reversed order (so processing from the end of the original string to the beginning):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the current character is '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if it's '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3' (wait, no, the code appends the original character? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (f) then append the current character (a) as is.\n\nelse:\n\n   if a is '3', append '5', set f to true.\n\n   else if a is '5', append '7', set f to true.\n\n   else, append '3'.\n\nWait, the code for the else block (when f is false):\n\n   if a is 3 \u2192 append 5, set f.\n\n   else if a is 5 \u2192 append7, set f.\n\n   else \u2192 append 3.\n\nSo for the first character (in the reversed processing order) that is not 3 or 5, it appends 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, the code is building the new string by processing each character in reverse order (from the end of the original number's digits). The first character in the new string (the first processed in the loop) is the last digit of the original number. The loop processes each digit from the end to the start of the original number.\n\nThe 'f' flag is whether we have made a change yet. The first time we hit a 3 or 5, we replace it with 5 or 7 respectively, and set f to true. The rest of the digits are kept as is. If none of the digits were 3 or 5, then after the loop, we append a 3 to the end (since f is still false).\n\nWait, the code after the loop:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nSo after processing all digits, if f is still false (meaning none of the digits were 3 or 5), then append a 3 to the end of the string.\n\nThen, the new string is reversed again? Because the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe sb is built by processing the original digits in reverse order (from the end to the start of the original number). The code then appends 3 if needed, and then the sb is reversed again?\n\nWait, the code does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb.reverse().toString());\n\nWait, the sb is the new string built as per the transformation. Then, the code reverses it again and parses as the next i.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try an example.\n\nSuppose the current i is 357. Let's walk through the code.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ni = 357. s is \"357\".\n\nCheck if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes. So c increments by 1.\n\nNow, building the next i:\n\nProcessing each character in reverse order (since the loop is over j from 0 to s.length()-1 (2 in this case). The characters are s[2], s[1], s[0].\n\nWait, the loop is for j from 0 to s.length()-1 (since s.length() is 3, j goes 0,1,2). The character is s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j). So for j=0: s.length()-1 -0 = 2 \u2192 third character (index 2, which is '7'). Then j=1 \u2192 index 1 (5), then j=2 \u2192 index 0 (3).\n\nSo processing the digits in reverse order: 7,5,3.\n\nThe initial f is false.\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nsince f is false, check if it's 3 or 5. 7 is neither, so append '3' to the sb. Then, since we didn't set f (because it's not 3 or5?), wait:\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif (a == '3') \u2192 append '5', set f to true.\n\nelse if (a == '5') \u2192 append '7', set f to true.\n\nelse \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo for the first character (7), which is not 3 or5, so append '3', and f remains false.\n\nNext character (5):\n\nsince f is still false.\n\na is '5', so append '7', set f to true.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nsince f is now true, append the original '3'.\n\nSo the sb after processing all characters is \"3\" (from first step) + \"7\" (second) + \"3\" (third) \u2192 \"373\".\n\nThen, since f was set to true, we don't append anything else (the !f is false).\n\nThen, the code does sb.reverse().toString() \u2192 reverse of \"373\" is \"373\", so the next i is 373.\n\nWait, but the next i would be 373. But the original i was 357, and the next is 373. So the next iteration would check if 373 is <= N, etc.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The transformation is generating the next number in a sequence by modifying the digits in a certain way, and the loop continues until i exceeds N. The count c is the number of numbers in the sequence up to N that contain all three digits 3,5,7.\n\nThe key is to model this transformation in Fortran.\n\nThe problem is to translate this into Fortran code, which must process the first part's output as N for the second part.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the second part's logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the second part's main variables:\n\n- N is the input (from first part's output).\n\n- The loop starts with i = 357, and continues while i <= N.\n\n- For each i, check if it contains 3,5,7. If yes, increment c.\n\n- Then compute the next i via the transformation.\n\nThe transformation steps:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each digit in reverse order (from the last digit to first).\n\n3. Build a new string as per the rules.\n\n4. If no 3 or5 were found, append a 3.\n\n5. Reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the digits in reverse order (from the end of the original number's digits). The processing is done in a way that modifies the first occurrence of 3 or5, then appends 3 if none were found. Then the new string is reversed again to form the next i.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nThe code builds the new string as follows:\n\n- The loop processes each character in the original string s in reverse order (from last to first character).\n\n- For each character in this reversed order (i.e., the first character processed is the last digit of the original number):\n\n   if f is false:\n\n      if the character is '3', replace with '5', set f to true.\n\n      else if '5', replace with '7', set f to true.\n\n      else, append '3' (regardless of the original character).\n\n   else:\n\n      append the original character.\n\n- After processing all characters, if f is still false (no 3 or5 found), append '3'.\n\n- Then, the new string is reversed again (because the code does sb.reverse().toString()).\n\nWait, the code's final step is to reverse the sb and parse it as the next i.\n\nWait, the sb is built by processing the original digits in reverse order, then after appending the 3 if needed, the sb is reversed again. So the next i is the reversed string of the sb.\n\nWait, let's see with the example of 357:\n\nOriginal s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (digits 7,5,3):\n\nFirst character (7):\n\nf is false. Since it's not 3 or5, append '3' \u2192 sb now has \"3\".\n\nf remains false.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\nf is false. It's 5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true. Now sb is \"37\".\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 sb is \"373\".\n\nAfter processing all, f is true, so no append.\n\nThen, the code does sb.reverse().toString() \u2192 \"373\" reversed is \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: let's take i=357 \u2192 next is 373.\n\nAnother example: let's take i=373.\n\ns is \"373\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (digits 3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false. It's 3 \u2192 replace with 5, set f to true. sb now has \"5\".\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7' \u2192 \"57\".\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 \"573\".\n\nNo need to append 3 since f was set.\n\nReverse the sb: \"573\" reversed is \"375\". So next i is 375.\n\nWait, the next i would be 375. Let's see:\n\nThe next i is 375. Check if it contains 3,5,7 \u2192 yes (3,7,5). So count increases.\n\nThen, processing 375:\n\ns is \"375\".\n\nReverse processing: digits 5,7,3.\n\nFirst character (5):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with 7, set f to true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nSecond character (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7'.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3'.\n\nSo the sb is \"773\".\n\nReverse it \u2192 \"377\". So next i is 377.\n\nWait, but 377's digits are 3,7,7. It contains 3 and7 but no 5. So it won't be counted. But the code's count is only for numbers that have all three digits.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nThe key is to model this transformation in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the steps for the transformation:\n\nGiven a number i, convert to a string s.\n\nProcess each character in reverse order (from last to first digit):\n\nBuild a new string as per the rules.\n\nThen, if no 3 or5 were found in the original digits, append a '3'.\n\nThen reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nThe new string is built by processing the original digits in reverse order (so the first character in the new string is the last digit of the original number). The processing modifies the first occurrence of 3 or5, then appends 3 if none. Then the new string is reversed again to form the next i.\n\nWait, the code's final step is to reverse the sb and parse it as the next i. So the next i is the reversed version of the sb.\n\nWait, let me think of the example again:\n\nOriginal i is 357 \u2192 s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe new string after processing is \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing this gives \"373\" \u2192 so next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: i=373 \u2192 s is \"373\".\n\nProcessing in reverse order (3,7,3):\n\nFirst character (3) \u2192 replaced with 5 \u2192 '5', f becomes true.\n\nThen 7 \u2192 append as is (since f is true).\n\nThen 3 \u2192 append as is (since f is true).\n\nSo the sb is \"573\".\n\nReversing gives \"375\".\n\nSo next i is 375.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each digit in the original number's reversed order (i.e., from the last digit to first):\n\n- For each digit, if we haven't made a change yet (f is false):\n\n   if the digit is 3 \u2192 change to 5, set f to true.\n\n   else if it's 5 \u2192 change to7, set f to true.\n\n   else \u2192 append '3' (regardless of the digit?), and leave f as false?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code, when the digit is not 3 or5, then in the else clause, we append '3', but f remains false?\n\nWait, in the code's else clause (when the digit is not 3 or5):\n\n   append '3', but f is not set to true. So f remains false.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the first example, when the first digit (7) is not 3 or5, we append '3', but f remains false. So in the next digits, if there is a 3 or5, we can still process them?\n\nWait, no. Because once we append '3' in the else clause, f remains false. So in the next digits, if there is a 3 or5, we can process them again?\n\nWait, let's see the code again:\n\nThe code's logic for each character:\n\nif (f) \u2192 append the original character.\n\nelse:\n\n   if a is 3 \u2192 append5, set f to true.\n\n   else if a is5 \u2192 append7, set f to true.\n\n   else \u2192 append3 (and f remains false).\n\nSo, in the first example, the first character (7) is not 3 or5 \u2192 append3, f remains false.\n\nThen the next character (5):\n\nsince f is still false, we check if it's 3 or5. It's 5 \u2192 append7, set f to true.\n\nSo the processing continues.\n\nSo the first occurrence of a 3 or5 is replaced, and subsequent digits are processed normally (if f is true, append as is).\n\nThus, the algorithm is to find the first occurrence (from the end of the original number) of a 3 or5, replace it with 5 or7 respectively, and then leave the rest as is. If there are no 3 or5, then append a 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but the processing is done in reverse order (from the end of the original number). So the first occurrence in the reversed processing (i.e., the last occurrence in the original number) of a 3 or5 is replaced.\n\nWait, the first character processed is the last digit of the original number. So the first occurrence in the reversed processing is the last digit of the original number. So the first 3 or5 encountered when moving from the end towards the start of the original number is replaced.\n\nSo the transformation is: find the rightmost occurrence of 3 or5 in the original number. Replace it with 5 if it was 3, or 7 if it was5. If there are none, append a 3 to the end.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is a bit different. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the original number is 333. Then processing in reverse order (digits 3,3,3):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with5, set f to true. So append5.\n\nSecond character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append3.\n\nThird character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append3.\n\nSo the new string is \"533\".\n\nReversing gives 335 \u2192 next i is 335.\n\nWait, but the original number was 333. The rightmost 3 is replaced with5, so the new number is 335?\n\nHmm, yes. So the transformation is replacing the first (rightmost) occurrence of 3 or5 with the next digit (3\u21925,5\u21927), and if none, append3.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Find the rightmost digit in the original number that is 3 or5.\n\n2. If found, replace it with 5 if it was3, or7 if it was5. The digits to the right of it (in the original number) are kept as is, but since we are processing from the end, the replacement is done, and the rest are appended as is.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is equivalent to this.\n\nThus, the steps for the transformation can be implemented in Fortran as follows:\n\nGiven a number i, convert to a string s.\n\nProcess each character from the end (right to left):\n\n   track whether we have made a change (f).\n\n   for each character in reverse order:\n\n      if not changed yet:\n\n          if it's '3', replace with '5', mark changed.\n\n          else if '5', replace with '7', mark changed.\n\n          else, append '3' (but this is only for the first non-3/5 encountered?)\n\n          Wait, no. The code appends '3' even if it's not 3 or5, but then leaves f as false. So in the next characters, if there is a 3 or5, it can be processed.\n\nWait, this complicates things. Because if the first character (last digit of original) is not 3 or5, we append '3', but f remains false. Then, if the next character (second last digit) is 3 or5, it can be processed.\n\nSo the code's approach is to process each digit from the end, and the first occurrence of 3 or5 is replaced, and the rest are kept as is. If none are found, append a 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but the code's logic is that once a replacement is made (f becomes true), the rest are appended as is. So the first occurrence (from the end) of 3 or5 is replaced, and the rest are kept.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFind the first (rightmost) occurrence of 3 or5 in the original number. Replace it with 5 or7 respectively. The digits to the right (in the original number) are kept as is, but since we are processing from the end, the replacement is done, and the rest are appended as is. The digits to the left of that position are kept as is.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is equivalent to:\n\nTake the original number's digits as a list.\n\nStarting from the end, look for the first occurrence of 3 or5.\n\nReplace that digit with 5 or7.\n\nIf none found, append a 3 to the end.\n\nThen, the new number is formed by this modified digits, but the code's processing is done in a way that builds the new string in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's transformation can be rephrased as:\n\nThe new number is formed by taking the original number's digits, and for the rightmost occurrence of 3 or5, replace it with 5 or7 respectively. If there are none, append a 3.\n\nWait, but the code's processing may have some edge cases. Let's see another example.\n\nTake i=555.\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse (5,5,5):\n\nFirst character (5):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with7, set f to true. So append7.\n\nSecond character (5):\n\nf is true \u2192 append5.\n\nThird character (5):\n\nf is true \u2192 append5.\n\nSo the new string is \"755\".\n\nReversing gives 557 \u2192 next i is 557.\n\nYes, so the rightmost 5 is replaced with7, resulting in 557.\n\nAnother example: i=533.\n\nOriginal digits: 5,3,3.\n\nProcessing in reverse (3,3,5):\n\nFirst character (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with5 \u2192 append5, set f to true.\n\nSecond character (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append3.\n\nThird character (5):\n\nf is true \u2192 append5.\n\nSo the new string is \"535\".\n\nReversing gives 535 \u2192 next i is 535.\n\nWait, but the rightmost occurrence of 3 or5 is the first 3 (the last digit of the original number). So replacing that 3 with5 gives the new number as 535.\n\nHmm, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is indeed replacing the rightmost occurrence of 3 or5 with the next digit (3\u21925,5\u21927), and if none, append3.\n\nThus, in Fortran, to implement this transformation:\n\nWe can process the digits of the current i as a string, find the rightmost occurrence of '3' or '5', replace it, then form the new number. If none, append '3' to the end.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the string as per the code's logic.\n\nNow, in Fortran, handling strings and characters can be done with character arrays.\n\nThe steps for the second part:\n\nInitialize c =0.\n\nSet i =357.\n\nLoop while i <= N (from first part's output):\n\n   convert i to a string s.\n\n   check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\n   compute the next i via the transformation.\n\nThe transformation steps:\n\n   process the digits of s in reverse order (from last to first character).\n\n   build a new string as per the rules.\n\n   if no 3 or5 found, append '3'.\n\n   reverse the new string to get the next i.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, converting i to a string. In Fortran, we can use write and read to convert numbers to strings.\n\nBut handling strings in Fortran can be a bit involved. Let's think of steps.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, for the second part:\n\ninteger :: N, c, i, next_i\n\nc =0\n\ni =357\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   s = string representation of i\n\n   check if s contains '3', '5', '7' \u2192 if yes, c +=1\n\n   compute next_i via transformation.\n\n   i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nprint *, c\n\nNow, the key is to implement the transformation.\n\nImplementing the transformation:\n\nFunction to compute next_i from current i.\n\nFunction next_i(i):\n\n   s = string of i\n\n   len = len_trim(s)\n\n   f = .false.\n\n   new_str = ''\n\n   do j = len, 1, -1 \u2192 process each character from last to first (reverse order)\n\n      current_char = s(j:j)\n\n      if (.not. f) then\n\n          if (current_char == '3') then\n\n              new_str = new_str // '5'\n\n              f = .true.\n\n          else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n              new_str = new_str // '7'\n\n              f = .true.\n\n          else\n\n              new_str = new_str // '3'\n\n          end if\n\n      else\n\n          new_str = new_str // current_char\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      new_str = new_str // '3'\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now reverse new_str to get the next number.\n\n   reversed_str = reverse(new_str)\n\n   next_i = convert reversed_str to integer (or long, but in Fortran, maybe use integer*8?)\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, reversing a string can be done with a loop.\n\nWait, the new_str is built by processing the original digits in reverse order (from last to first), so the new_str is built as follows:\n\nFor example, original s is \"357\" \u2192 processing in reverse order (7,5,3):\n\nThe new_str after processing is \"373\".\n\nThen, reversing new_str gives \"373\" \u2192 next_i is 373.\n\nWait, but the code's next step is to reverse the new_str and parse it as the next i.\n\nWait, the code in Java does:\n\ni = Long.parseLong(sb.reverse().toString());\n\nThe sb is the new_str as built. So the next i is the reversed version of new_str.\n\nWait, in the example above, new_str is \"373\", reversed is \"373\", so next i is 373.\n\nAnother example: when processing 373 \u2192 new_str is \"573\", reversed is \"375\".\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the next_i is the reversed string of new_str.\n\nThus, in Fortran, after building new_str, we need to reverse it to get the next number.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert i to a string s.\n\n2. Process each character in reverse order (from last to first) to build new_str.\n\n3. If no 3 or5 were found (f is false), append '3'.\n\n4. Reverse new_str to get the next string.\n\n5. Convert that reversed string to integer (or long) to get next_i.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, converting i to a string. Let's use a character array.\n\nIn Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') i\n\ns = adjustl(s) \u2192 to remove leading spaces.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing to a character variable with a format, it pads with spaces. So using adjustl to left-justify.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to get the string.\n\nThen, processing each character in reverse order.\n\nLet me outline the code for the transformation function.\n\nFunction next_i(i) result(res)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: i\n\n   character(len=20) :: s, new_str, reversed_str\n\n   logical :: f\n\n   integer :: res, len, j\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') i\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   len = len_trim(s)\n\n   new_str = ''\n\n   f = .false.\n\n   do j = len, 1, -1\n\n      current_char = s(j:j)\n\n      if (.not. f) then\n\n         if (current_char == '3') then\n\n            new_str = trim(new_str) // '5'\n\n            f = .true.\n\n         else if (current_char == '5') then\n\n            new_str = trim(new_str) // '7'\n\n            f = .true.\n\n         else\n\n            new_str = trim(new_str) // '3'\n\n         end if\n\n      else\n\n         new_str = trim(new_str) // current_char\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (.not. f) then\n\n      new_str = trim(new_str) // '3'\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Reverse new_str\n\n   reversed_str = ''\n\n   do j = len_trim(new_str), 1, -1\n\n      reversed_str = trim(reversed_str) // new_str(j:j)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! Convert reversed_str to integer\n\n   read(reversed_str, *) res\n\nend function next_i\n\nWait, but in Fortran, string concatenation can be done with //, but the variables need to be of sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, using arrays.\n\nBut this is a rough outline.\n\nNow, the problem is handling the string lengths. The variables s, new_str, reversed_str need to be large enough. Since the maximum N can be up to the first program's output, which could be up to n (since the first program's output is either n -c or -1, but if it's -1, then the second program's N is -1, but the loop would not execute. But the problem says the first program's output is used as input to the second, so perhaps the first program's output is always a valid N for the second program. But in any case, the code must handle it.\n\nNow, the second part's main loop:\n\ninteger :: N, c, i, next_i\n\nc =0\n\ni =357\n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ! Check if contains 3,5,7\n\n   contains_all = check_357(i)\n\n   if (contains_all) then\n\n      c = c +1\n\n   end if\n\n   ! compute next_i\n\n   next_i = next_i_function(i)\n\n   i = next_i\n\nend do\n\nprint *, c\n\nThe function check_357 checks if the number contains at least one 3,5,7.\n\nImplementing check_357:\n\nlogical function check_357(n)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n   character(len=20) :: s\n\n   logical :: has3, has5, has7\n\n   write(s, '(i0)') n\n\n   s = adjustl(s)\n\n   has3 = .false.\n\n   has5 = .false.\n\n   has7 = .false.\n\n   do j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n      c = s(j:j)\n\n      if (c == '3') has3 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '5') has5 = .true.\n\n      if (c == '7') has7 = .true.\n\n   end do\n\n   check_357 = has3 .and. has5 .and. has7\n\nend function\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, the entire Fortran program must read the input for the first part, process it, then use the result as N for the second part, and output the second's result.\n\nThe first part's input is n, k, followed by n integers.\n\nSo the Fortran program's structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, arr(100000) ! assuming n can be up to 1e5, but need to see constraints.\n\n   integer :: c, l, current_c, first_part_result\n\n   integer :: N, second_part_result\n\n   !

The new_str is built by processing the original digits in reverse order, then appending 3 if needed, then reversed_str is the reverse of new_str, which effectively gives the next number.\n\nWait, let me test with the first example:\n\ni=357 \u2192 s is '357'\n\nProcessing each character from 3,5,7 (wait, no, j goes from len=3 down to 1:\n\nWait, s is '357', len=3.\n\nj=3 \u2192 s(3:3) is '7'\n\nj=2 \u2192 '5'\n\nj=1 \u2192 '3'\n\nProcessing j=3 (7):\n\nf is false \u2192 since it's not 3 or5, append '3' \u2192 new_str is '3'\n\nf remains false.\n\nj=2 (5):\n\nf is false \u2192 it's 5 \u2192 append '7', set f to true \u2192 new_str is '37'\n\nj=1 (3):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '3' \u2192 new_str is '373'\n\nThen, since f is true, no append.\n\nReversed_str is the reverse of '373' \u2192 '373'.\n\nThus, res is 373.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: i=373 \u2192 s is '373'\n\nProcessing j=3 (3):\n\nf is false \u2192 replace with5 \u2192 new_str is '5', f true.\n\nj=2 (7):\n\nf is true \u2192 append '7' \u2192 new_str '57'\n\nj=1 (3):\n\nappend '3' \u2192 new_str '573'\n\nreversed_str is '375' \u2192 next_i is 375.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: i=555 \u2192 s is '555'\n\nProcessing j=3 (5):\n\nf false \u2192 replace with7 \u2192 new_str '7', f true.\n\nj=2 (5) \u2192 append '5' \u2192 '75'\n\nj=1 (5) \u2192 append '5' \u2192 '755'\n\nreversed_str is '557' \u2192 next_i is 557.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, handling the case where N is -1 (from first part's output). Then, the second part's N is -1, so the loop doesn't run (since i starts at 357 which is >-1), so the result is 0.\n\nAlso, if N is less than 357, the loop doesn't run, so c remains 0.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the array arr needs to be dimensioned properly. The first Java program's n can be up to whatever, but in the problem statement, perhaps the constraints are manageable. Assuming n is up to 1e5, but in code, perhaps using a dynamic array is better, but in Fortran, we can use an array with a large size, say 1e5.\n\nAlternatively, read the numbers one by one without storing them all, but since we need to process them in sequence, we can read them one by one and track l and current_c.\n\nWait, that's better. Because storing an array of n elements may be memory-intensive for large n. Let's see:\n\nIn the first part's processing, we don't need to store all the numbers. We can read them one by one, keeping track of the last number (l) and current_c.\n\nSo modifying the first part's code:\n\nInstead of reading all into an array, read each number as it comes.\n\nThus, the code can be:\n\n   integer :: n, k, a, l, current_c\n\n   read*, n, k\n\n   l =0\n\n   current_c =1\n\n   do i =1, n\n\n      read*, a\n\n      if (a == l) then\n\n         current_c = current_c +1\n\n      else\n\n         current_c =1\n\n      end if\n\n      l = a\n\n   end do\n\nThis is better, as it doesn't require an array.\n\nThus, the first part's code can be adjusted to read each a one by one.\n\nSo the final Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k, a, l, current_c, first_part_result\n\n   integer :: N, second_part_result\n\n   !

Since in Java it uses long, but in Fortran, using integer*8 may be better. However, in the problem's context, the first program's output could be up to n (which could be large, but the second program's N is that value. However, the second program's loop may not run for very large N, but the code uses integer which may be 32-bit. To handle large numbers, perhaps use integer(8).\n\nBut in the code above, the variables are declared as integer, which may be 4 bytes.

The reversed_str can be up to len_trim(new_str) characters. The character variables are length 20, which should be sufficient for numbers up to 1e18 (which is 18 digits).\n\nThus, this should work."
