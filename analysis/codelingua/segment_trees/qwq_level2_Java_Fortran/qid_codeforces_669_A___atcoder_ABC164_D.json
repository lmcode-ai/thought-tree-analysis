Wait the original string is \"2019\", so the digits in reverse order are '9','1','0','2'. The mod values are:\n\nAt i=4 (the first digit processed is '9', then '1', '0', '2'):\n\nWait, the mod_arr(4) is 0. So the mod for the full string (all digits processed) is 0 mod2019. So the substring from the beginning to the end (the entire number 2019) is divisible by 2019. So there is one pair (the empty prefix and the full string's mod0 \u2192 count as 1 pair. Also, the mod19 occurs twice (at i=2 and i=3). So the pairs between those two would be 1 pair. So total 1+1=2. Correct.",

But in this case, none of the mod values are 0 except the initial increment. So the total is 1 (the empty prefix) and mod0 count is 1, so 1*0/2=0. So the answer is 0. Correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding each Java program's purpose and how they connect.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (codeforces_669_A) reads an integer n from input, then calls solve(n), which calculates (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2 plus 1 if n mod 3 isn't zero, else 0. So the output of this first program is that calculated value.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC164_D) takes a string S as input, processes it to compute some count based on modulo 2019 of substrings, and outputs the result. Wait, but in the original setup, the output of the first program is the input to the second. Wait, but looking at the Java code, the first program's output is the result of solve(n), which is an integer. The second program expects a string input S. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user said the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string S. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's solve function outputs an integer. The second program expects a string as input. So the first program's output is an integer, which is then passed as the input to the second program. But the second program reads a string. So perhaps the first program's output is converted to a string and then becomes the input for the second. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first's output. For example, if the first program outputs 5, then the second program's input is \"5\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input (the original input to the first Java program, which is an integer n), compute the first result (the solve(n) value), then use that result as the input string for the second part's processing, and finally output the second program's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the initial integer n from input.\n2. Compute the first part's result (the codeforces part) which is (n//3)*2 + 1 if n mod 3 !=0 else (n//3)*2. Wait, let me recheck the first Java code's solve function:\n\nThe code is: System.out.println((n / 3) * 2 + (n % 3 == 0 ? 0 : 1));\n\nSo for example, if n is 4: 4/3 is 1, so 1*2 +1 (since 4 mod3 is 1) \u2192 3. If n is 3: 3/3=1, so 2 +0 \u2192 2. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo first part's output is that value. Let's call that value 'k'.\n\nThen, the second part takes the string representation of k as input S. So the second part's input is the string of that number. For example, if k is 5, then S is \"5\".\n\nThe second part's code processes S to compute the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that the substring from i to j (or some similar condition) forms a number divisible by 2019. The algorithm in the second Java code is a standard approach for counting such pairs efficiently using prefix mod values.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read n from input.\n- Compute k = (n /3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3) /=0 else 0)\n- Convert k to a string S.\n- Then process S as per the second Java code's logic.\n- Output the final answer from the second part.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nRead n from input. Let's say n is an integer. Then compute k as (n /3)*2 + (if mod(n,3) ==0 then 0 else 1). So in Fortran, the mod function is mod(n,3). So:\n\nk = (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3) /=0 )\n\nWait, the merge function takes two expressions, a logical condition, and returns the first if true, else the second. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it as:\n\nif (mod(n,3) ==0) then\n   k = (n/3)*2\nelse\n   k = (n/3)*2 +1\nend if\n\nEither way.\n\nThen, convert k to a string S. In Fortran, to convert an integer to a string, we can use write with an internal file or a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, '(i0)') k\ns = adjustl(s)  ! To remove leading spaces.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when writing to a character variable, the format 'i0' will write the integer without leading spaces. So maybe adjustl is not needed. Let me check.\n\nSuppose k is 123. Then writing to s with '(i0)' would give '123' in the string, padded with spaces on the right? Or left? Wait, the default is to right-justify, so leading spaces if the field is larger. Wait, no, the 'i0' format uses the minimum number of digits. So the string would be exactly the digits. Wait, perhaps the 'i0' format writes the integer as a string without leading spaces. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the 'i0' format in Fortran writes the integer in the shortest possible form, so the resulting string will have exactly the digits of the number, no leading or trailing spaces. So the 'adjustl' may not be necessary, but to be safe, perhaps we can use it. Alternatively, we can trim the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\nwrite(s, *) k\ns = adjustl(trim(s))\n\nBut maybe the first approach is better. Let's proceed with:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') k\n\nThen, the length of s is the length of the number's string. But in Fortran, the character variable must be large enough. Since k can be up to (n/3)*2 +1. The maximum n for the first problem? Well, the original Java code probably allows n up to 1e9 or something, but in Fortran, the integer can be handled as default (4 bytes?), but for the string, the maximum length of k's string would be, say, 10 digits (if n is up to 1e9, then k would be up to (1e9/3)*2 +1 ~ 666,666,667, which is 9 digits). So a length of 20 is sufficient.\n\nOnce we have the string S, we need to process it as per the second Java code.\n\nNow, the second part's algorithm:\n\nThe second Java code processes the string S as follows:\n\nIt initializes an array mod_arr of length N (the length of S), and mod_cnt array of size 2019 (since mod 2019 can be 0-2018).\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to N-1 (but in reverse order?), let's see:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\nInside, the code does:\n\nint tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n\nWait, the S is processed in reverse order. Let me see:\n\nThe S is the input string. The code is processing the digits from the end to the beginning. Because for i starting at 0, the first character is S.charAt(N-1 -0) = S.charAt(N-1), which is the last character of the string. So the loop is processing the digits from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost). Because in the code, the first digit processed is the last character of the string (the rightmost digit), then the next is the previous character, etc. So the loop is going from the end towards the start of the string.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    int tmp = ((int) S.charAt(N - 1 -i) - (int) '0') * radix % 2019;\n    if (i !=0) tmp = (tmp + mod_arr[i-1]) %2019;\n    mod_arr[i] = tmp;\n    mod_cnt[tmp]++;\n    radix = radix *10 %2019;\n}\n\nSo for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nThe current digit is the (N-1 -i)th character of S. So when i=0, it's the last character (the rightmost digit), which is the least significant digit. Then, for each step, the digit is multiplied by 10^i (since radix starts at 1 and is multiplied by 10 each step). Wait, the radix starts at 1, then after first iteration, becomes 10, then 100 mod 2019, etc. So the first digit (the rightmost) is multiplied by 1 (10^0), the next (second from the right) by 10 (10^1), etc. So the calculation is for the number formed by the last i+1 digits, but in a way that builds the prefix mod.\n\nWait, the algorithm is for counting the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that the substring from i to j (or some other way) forms a number divisible by 2019. The approach here is to compute for each position the mod of the number formed by the suffix up to that position, multiplied by the appropriate power of 10, and track the counts of these mods to find pairs.\n\nThe key idea is that for a number to be divisible by 2019, the difference between two mod values must be 0 mod 2019. So the algorithm tracks the mod values of the numbers formed by the suffixes, and counts how many times each mod has occurred. The total pairs are the sum over all mod counts of (count choose 2).\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to implement this.\n\nFirst, the string S is the converted k from the first part. Let's say S is a character array of length N.\n\nWe need to process each character in reverse order (from the end to the start). Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran, the characters can be accessed via a character array. Let's say S is a character(len=N) variable. Then S(1:1) is the first character (leftmost), S(N:N) is the last (rightmost). So to process the characters in reverse order (starting from the last character), for i from 0 to N-1, the current character is S(N - i) ?\n\nWait, in the Java code, for i from 0 to N-1:\n\nThe index in the string is N-1 -i. Since in Java, strings are 0-based. So in Fortran, if S is 1-based, then the equivalent would be S(N - i) ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's S has length N, indices 0 to N-1. The code uses S.charAt(N-1 -i). So for i=0, it's S.charAt(N-1) (the last character). For i=1, it's S.charAt(N-2), etc. So in Fortran, if S is a character array of length N, with indices 1 to N, then the equivalent would be S(N - i) ?\n\nWait, for i=0, N -i is N \u2192 S(N) is the last character. For i=1, N-1 \u2192 S(N-1), etc. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loop would be over i from 0 to N-1, and the current digit is ichar(S(N - i)) - ichar('0').\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters can be converted to their ASCII values with ichar. So yes.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nmod_arr is an array of size N. Since N can be up to the length of the string, which is up to, say, 20 (since k is the output of the first part, which is an integer, so its string length is manageable).\n\nmod_cnt is an array of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nradix starts at 1, and is updated as radix = (radix *10) mod 2019 each step.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial radix is 1. Then, for each iteration, after computing tmp, the radix is updated as radix = radix *10 %2019.\n\nWait, the order is important. Let me see the Java code's loop:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ntmp is computed as (digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nThen, if i !=0, add mod_arr[i-1] to tmp, mod 2019.\n\nThen mod_arr[i] = tmp.\n\nmod_cnt[tmp] is incremented.\n\nThen, radix is updated to (radix *10) mod 2019.\n\nWait, the order is important. The radix is updated after processing the current i. So the next iteration's radix is the current one multiplied by 10 mod 2019.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize mod_arr as an array of size N (integer array).\n\nmod_cnt as an array of size 2019 (integer array, initialized to 0).\n\nradix = 1\n\nThen loop over i from 0 to N-1:\n\ndigit = S(N -i) - '0' (as integer)\n\ntmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019\n\nif i >0 then:\n\n   tmp = (tmp + mod_arr(i-1)) mod 2019\n\nmod_arr(i) = tmp\n\nmod_cnt(tmp +1) = mod_cnt(tmp +1) +1 (since in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so mod 0 would be index 1? Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bounds. Let me think.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless specified. So mod_cnt is declared as integer, dimension(0:2018) to have indices 0 to 2018. Wait, but in Fortran, you can declare arrays with any lower bound. So perhaps better to declare mod_cnt(0:2018). So mod_cnt(0) is for mod 0, etc.\n\nWait, in the Java code, mod_cnt is an array of size 2019, so indices 0 to 2018. So in Fortran, we can declare mod_cnt(0:2018).\n\nSimilarly, mod_arr is an array of size N (indices 0 to N-1?), but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So perhaps mod_arr(1:N) where N is the length of S. So in the loop, for i from 1 to N (since in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to N, but the original Java uses 0-based indices). So need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think through the variables:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nmod_arr is of size N (indices 0 to N-1).\n\nmod_cnt is of size 2019 (indices 0 to 2018).\n\nIn Fortran, let's declare mod_arr as an array of size N, with indices 1 to N. So for each i in 1 to N (corresponding to Java's 0 to N-1).\n\nSimilarly, mod_cnt is 0:2018.\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n\n   current character is S(N - (i-1)) \u2192 because when i=1, it's N -0 \u2192 N, which is the last character (Java's i=0).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i runs from 0 to N-1 (total N elements). In Fortran, we can have i from 1 to N, so the index in the loop corresponds to Java's i = i_fortran -1.\n\nSo for each i_fortran from 1 to N:\n\nJava's i = i_fortran -1.\n\nThus, the current character is S(N - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 S(N - i_fortran +1).\n\nWait, perhaps better to think:\n\nJava's i is 0 \u2192 current character is S.charAt(N-1 -0) \u2192 S(N-1).\n\nIn Fortran, for i_fortran =1, the equivalent is S(N - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 S(N -0) \u2192 S(N).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the first character is S(1), so if the string is \"123\", then S(1) is '1', S(3) is '3'. So the last character is S(N).\n\nSo yes, the current character is S(N - (i_fortran -1)) \u2192 S(N - i_fortran +1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the string first. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_mod = 2018\ninteger :: N, mod_arr(1:N), mod_cnt(0:max_mod)\ninteger :: radix =1, tmp, digit, ans=0\n\nBut N is the length of the string S. So first, after converting k to S, we can get N = len_trim(S).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the length of a character variable can be found with len_trim(s), which gives the length excluding trailing blanks. Since we wrote the integer into S with '(i0)', there should be no trailing blanks, so len_trim(s) is correct.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nCompute k = (n/3)*2 + (1 if mod(n,3)/=0 else 0).\n\nConvert k to a string S.\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nInitialize mod_arr(1:N), mod_cnt(0:2018) =0.\n\nradix =1\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to N:\n\ndigit = ichar(S(N - i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor i=1 (first iteration):\n\nN -i +1 = N -1 +1 = N \u2192 S(N) \u2192 the last character (correct, as in Java's first step).\n\nFor i=2: N -2 +1 = N-1 \u2192 S(N-1), which is the second last character (Java's i=1).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo digit is the current character's value.\n\nThen compute tmp = (digit * radix) mod 2019.\n\nThen, if i >1 (since in Java, if i !=0 \u2192 which is i_fortran -1 !=0 \u2192 i_fortran >1):\n\n   tmp = (tmp + mod_arr(i-1)) mod 2019\n\nWait, mod_arr(i-1) is the previous mod value (since in Java, mod_arr[i-1] is the previous index).\n\nThen mod_arr(i) = tmp.\n\nmod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\nThen, update radix: radix = (radix *10) mod 2019.\n\nWait, but in Java, the radix is updated after the current iteration's processing. So in Fortran, after computing tmp and updating mod_arr and mod_cnt, we do:\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the order is:\n\nAfter computing tmp and mod_arr[i], then mod_cnt is updated, then radix is updated.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, after the mod_cnt increment, we do the radix update.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\n... compute tmp, set mod_arr[i], increment mod_cnt[tmp], then:\n\nradix = radix *10 %2019;\n\nSo in Fortran, after the mod_cnt increment, we do:\n\nradix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\nYes.\n\nAfter processing all characters, the code in Java does:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, why? Looking at the Java code:\n\nAfter the loop, the code has:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nThen, the ans is computed as the sum over all i of mod_cnt[i]*(mod_cnt[i]-1)/2.\n\nWait, why is mod_cnt[0] incremented?\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nThe code in the second Java program's main function:\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nWait, that's after the loop. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code after the loop:\n\nlong ans =0L;\n\nmod_cnt[0]++;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<2019; i++) {\n\n   ans += mod_cnt[i] * (mod_cnt[i]-1)/2;\n\n}\n\nWait, why is mod_cnt[0] being incremented?\n\nAh, perhaps because the empty substring or something? Wait, the algorithm counts the number of pairs (i,j) where the substring from i to j forms a number divisible by 2019. The way the algorithm works is that the mod array holds the mod of the number formed by the suffix up to that position. The count of mod values allows us to find how many pairs have the same mod, which would mean their difference is 0 mod 2019. But perhaps the initial 0 mod is not counted properly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in Java is considering the empty prefix. Let me think.\n\nThe algorithm is based on the idea that for two indices i and j (i < j), the number formed by the substring from j to N (the suffix up to j) minus the number formed by the substring from i to N (the suffix up to i) must be divisible by 2019. The difference would be (number_j - number_i) mod 2019 =0 \u2192 (number_j mod 2019 - number_i mod 2019) mod 2019 =0 \u2192 number_j mod 2019 = number_i mod 2019. So the count of pairs is the number of pairs of indices with the same mod value. However, the initial mod value (before any digits) is 0 (since the empty suffix has value 0). So the mod array in the code includes the current mod values, but the empty prefix is not stored. Hence, the code increments mod_cnt[0] by 1 to account for the empty prefix. Because when considering the empty prefix (i=0), the mod is 0, so any j where mod[j] is 0 would form a pair (0,j). Hence, the code adds 1 to mod_cnt[0], so that when calculating the combinations, it includes those pairs.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after the loop, we need to do mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1.\n\nThen, compute the answer as the sum over all mod values of (count choose 2).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nans =0\n\nmod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\ndo i=0,2018\n\n   ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\nend do\n\nThen, print ans.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's structure the Fortran program.\n\nThe program must read an integer n from input, compute k, convert to string S, process S as per the second part, then output the answer.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\ninteger :: n, k, N\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: S\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: mod_arr\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2018) :: mod_cnt\n\ninteger :: radix, tmp, digit, ans=0\n\nBut since N is the length of S, which is determined after converting k to a string, we can compute N as len_trim(S).\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute k.\n\nConvert k to S.\n\nN = len_trim(S)\n\nAllocate mod_arr(1:N)\n\nInitialize mod_cnt to 0.\n\nThen proceed with the loop.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays must be declared with fixed sizes unless allocatable. So mod_arr can be declared as allocatable, which is better here since N is variable.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, k, N\n\n  character(len=20) :: S\n\n  integer, allocatable :: mod_arr(:)\n\n  integer :: mod_cnt(0:2018), radix, tmp, digit, ans=0, i\n\n  ! Read n\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  ! Compute k\n\n  if (mod(n,3) ==0) then\n\n     k = (n/3)*2\n\n  else\n\n     k = (n/3)*2 +1\n\n  end if\n\n  ! Convert k to string S\n\n  write(S, '(i0)') k\n\n  N = len_trim(S)\n\n  ! Initialize mod arrays\n\n  allocate(mod_arr(1:N))\n\n  mod_cnt = 0\n\n  radix =1\n\n  ! Process each character\n\n  do i =1, N\n\n     ! current character is S(N -i +1)\n\n     digit = ichar(S(N -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\n     tmp = mod( digit * radix, 2019 )\n\n     if (i >1) then\n\n        tmp = mod( tmp + mod_arr(i-1), 2019 )\n\n     end if\n\n     mod_arr(i) = tmp\n\n     mod_cnt(tmp) = mod_cnt(tmp) +1\n\n     ! Update radix\n\n     radix = mod( radix *10, 2019 )\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Increment mod_cnt(0) by 1\n\n  mod_cnt(0) = mod_cnt(0) +1\n\n  ! Compute ans\n\n  ans =0\n\n  do i=0,2018\n\n     ans = ans + mod_cnt(i) * (mod_cnt(i)-1)/2\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Output ans\n\n  print*, ans\n\n  deallocate(mod_arr)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop, when i=1, the 'if (i>1)' is false, so tmp is just mod(digit * radix, 2019). Then mod_arr(1) is set to that.\n\nThen, for i=2, the previous mod_arr(1) is added.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the first iteration (i=0 in Java) does not add mod_arr[i-1], since i=0. So in Fortran's i=1, which corresponds to Java's i=0, the 'if (i>1)' is false, so correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check the radix update. In the Java code, the radix is updated after processing the current i. So in Fortran, after updating mod_cnt and mod_arr, the radix is updated. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: Let's say n=3.\n\nFirst part: solve(3) \u2192 3/3=1 \u2192 1*2 +0 \u2192 2. So k=2 \u2192 S is \"2\".\n\nSecond part: S is \"2\", N=1.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=1:\n\ndigit = S(1) \u2192 '2' \u2192 2.\n\ntmp = 2 *1 mod2019 \u21922.\n\nSince i=1, no addition.\n\nmod_arr(1)=2.\n\nmod_cnt(2) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 1*10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\nThen, after loop:\n\nmod_cnt(0) is incremented to 1 (since initially 0, then +1 \u21921).\n\nans is sum over all mod_cnt(i)*(i-1)/2.\n\nmod_cnt(0) is 1 \u2192 1*0/2 =0.\n\nmod_cnt(2) is 1 \u2192 1*0/2=0.\n\nAll others are 0. So total ans is 0.\n\nBut according to the second Java code, when S is \"2\", the answer should be 0, since there are no pairs. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n= 2019 \u2192 first part: 2019/3=673 \u2192 673*2 =1346. So k=1346 \u2192 S is \"1346\".\n\nThen N=4.\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order (digits are '6','4','3','1').\n\nLet me walk through the steps:\n\nInitialize mod_cnt all 0, radix=1.\n\ni=1 (processing first digit '6'):\n\ndigit =6.\n\ntmp =6 *1 mod2019 \u21926.\n\nmod_arr(1)=6.\n\nmod_cnt(6) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10.\n\ni=2 (digit '4'):\n\ndigit=4.\n\ntmp =4 *10 mod2019 \u219240.\n\nsince i>1, add mod_arr(1)=6 \u219240+6=46 mod2019 \u219246.\n\nmod_arr(2)=46.\n\nmod_cnt(46) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 10*10 mod2019 \u2192100.\n\ni=3 (digit '3'):\n\ndigit=3.\n\ntmp =3 *100 mod2019 \u2192300.\n\nadd mod_arr(2)=46 \u2192300+46=346 mod2019 \u2192346.\n\nmod_arr(3)=346.\n\nmod_cnt(346) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 100*10 mod2019 \u21921000.\n\ni=4 (digit '1'):\n\ndigit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *1000 mod2019 \u21921000.\n\nadd mod_arr(3)=346 \u21921000+346 =1346 mod2019.\n\n1346 mod2019 is 1346.\n\nmod_arr(4)=1346.\n\nmod_cnt(1346) becomes 1.\n\nradix becomes 1000*10 mod2019 \u219210000 mod2019.\n\nBut after processing all, mod_cnt(0) is incremented to 1.\n\nNow, the mod counts are:\n\nmod 6 \u21921\n\nmod46 \u21921\n\nmod346 \u21921\n\nmod1346 \u21921\n\nmod0 \u21921 (after increment).\n\nSo the ans is (1 choose 2)*4 (for each of the 4 mods except 0) plus (1 choose 2 for mod0 \u21920) \u2192 total 0. But wait, mod0's count is 1, so 1*0/2=0. So total ans is 0.\n\nWait, but the actual number 1346 is 1346 mod2019 is 1346, which is not 0. So the answer is 0. But perhaps there is a pair?\n\nWait, the string is \"1346\". The possible substrings (as per the problem's requirement?) The problem in the second Java code is to count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that the substring from i to j (or some other way) forms a number divisible by 2019. The algorithm counts the number of pairs (i,j) where the suffix up to i and j have the same mod, which would mean the substring between them is divisible by 2019. But in this case, none of the mod values are 0 except the incremented mod0 (the empty prefix). So the only possible pair is between the empty prefix (mod0) and any position where mod is 0. But in this case, none of the mod values are 0 except the initial increment. So the total is 1 (the empty prefix) and mod0 count is 1, so 1*0/2=0. So the answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where the answer is non-zero:\n\nSuppose the first part outputs k= 2019 \u2192 S is \"2019\".\n\nThen N=4.\n\nProcessing the digits in reverse order: '9','1','0','2'.\n\nLet me see:\n\ni=1 (digit '9'):\n\ndigit=9.\n\ntmp =9 *1 mod2019 \u21929.\n\nmod_arr(1)=9.\n\nmod_cnt(9)=1.\n\nradix becomes 10.\n\ni=2 (digit '1'):\n\ndigit=1.\n\ntmp =1 *10 mod2019 \u219210.\n\nAdd mod_arr(1)=9 \u219210+9=19 mod2019 \u219219.\n\nmod_arr(2)=19.\n\nmod_cnt(19)=1.\n\nradix becomes 100.\n\ni=3 (digit '0'):\n\ndigit=0.\n\ntmp =0 *100 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nAdd mod_arr(2)=19 \u21920+19=19 mod2019 \u219219.\n\nmod_arr(3)=19.\n\nmod_cnt(19) becomes 2.\n\nradix becomes 1000.\n\ni=4 (digit '2'):\n\ndigit=2.\n\ntmp =2 *1000 mod2019 \u21922000 mod2019 is 2000 (since 2019-2000=19 \u2192 2000 mod2019 is 2000).\n\nAdd mod_arr(3)=19 \u21922000+19 =2019 mod2019 \u21920.\n\nmod_arr(4)=0.\n\nmod_cnt(0) becomes 1 (before increment).\n\nThen after loop:\n\nmod_cnt(0) is 1 (from mod_arr(4)=0) plus the increment \u21922.\n\nmod_cnt(19) is 2 (from i=2 and i=3).\n\nmod_cnt(9)=1, mod19=2, mod0=2.\n\nSo ans is:\n\nmod0: 2*(2-1)/2 =1\n\nmod19: 2*(1)/2 =1\n\nothers: 0.\n\nTotal ans=1+1=2.\n\nSo the answer would be 2.\n\nWhich is correct because the substrings \"19\" (digits 3 and 4 in the original string \"2019\" \u2192 but wait, the actual digits are processed in reverse. Let me think.\n\nWait the original string is \"2019\", so the digits in reverse order are '9','1','0','2'.\n\nThe mod values are:\n\nAt i=4 (the first digit processed is '9', then '1', '0', '2'):\n\nWait, the mod_arr(4) is 0. So the mod for the full string (all digits processed) is 0 mod2019. So the substring from the beginning to the end (the entire number 2019) is divisible by 2019. So there is one pair (the empty prefix and the full string's mod0 \u2192 count as 1 pair. Also, the mod19 occurs twice (at i=2 and i=3). So the pairs between those two would be 1 pair. So total 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle this correctly.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, after the loop, mod_cnt(0) is 1 (from mod_arr(4)=0) plus the increment \u21922. So mod0's count is 2, so 2C2 =1. mod19 has count 2 \u21921. So total 2.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together into the Fortran code.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the mod function can return negative values if the first argument is negative, but since all terms here are positive (digit, radix, etc.), mod should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the mod function is mod(a,b), which gives a result with the same sign as b. Since 2019 is positive, mod will return 0 to 2018.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the final code."
