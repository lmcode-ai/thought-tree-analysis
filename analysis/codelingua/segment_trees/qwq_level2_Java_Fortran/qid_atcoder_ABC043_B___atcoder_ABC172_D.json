    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC043_B) reads a string from input. Then it processes it by building a string where '0' and '1' are added, and 'B' removes the last character if possible. The result is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC172_D) takes an integer n from input, computes some formula involving summing over i from 1 to n, and outputs the result.\n\nBut since they are executed in sequence, the output of the first becomes the input of the second. Wait, but the first program's output is a string (the processed string), and the second expects an integer n. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first program's output is the processed string, which is then the input to the second program. But the second program expects an integer n. So the first program's output must be a number, which the second program reads as n. So the first program's output is a string of 0s and 1s, which is then read as an integer by the second program. So the entire process is: input a string to first program, process it into a string of 0s and 1s, then that string is the input to the second program, which parses it as an integer n, then computes the sum.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read via Scanner, which reads an integer. So the first program's output must be a number (like \"101\" which is 5 in decimal?), but the second program would read that as an integer. So the first program's output is a string of digits (0 and 1), which is then the input to the second program, which reads it as n. So the second program's input is that string, which is parsed as an integer. So the entire process is:\n\nInput to first program: a string (like \"0B1\" becomes \"01\" then \"1\" after processing?), but let me see the first program's code again.\n\nLooking at the first Java program's solve method:\n\nThe input string s is processed by appending '0' or '1' when those characters are encountered, and 'B' deletes the last character if possible. So the output is the final string after processing. So the output is a string of 0s and 1s. Then that string is the input to the second program, which reads it as an integer n. So the second program's input is that string, which must be a valid integer. So the first program's output must be a valid integer (like \"100\" would be 100, but only 0 and 1 digits, so it's a binary number? Or is it treated as a decimal number? The second program reads it as an integer, so it's decimal. So the first program's output is a string of 0s and 1s, which is then read as a decimal integer n by the second program.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input string, process it as per the first Java program, then compute the second program's result based on that processed string as n.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input string (from stdin).\n2. Process it to build the string d as per the first Java program's logic.\n3. Convert that string d into an integer n (as a decimal number).\n4. Compute the sum as per the second Java program's formula.\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (processing the string):\n\nThe first step is to process the input string. Let's see the steps:\n\nInitialize a string (like a character array or a string variable) that starts empty. For each character in the input string:\n\n- If it's '0' or '1', append to the string.\n- If it's 'B', then if the string is not empty, remove the last character.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be handled with character arrays. Let's think of using a character array with a dynamic length. Alternatively, since Fortran strings can be manipulated with functions like trim, but maybe using a character array and a length variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a character variable with a length that can be adjusted. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of the steps in Fortran:\n\nRead the input string. Let's say the input is read as a single line. So in Fortran, we can read it with a read statement, perhaps using a character variable with sufficient length, or using a list-directed read. But since the input could be a long string, maybe using a large enough array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to read a line, you can use:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut need to make sure the length is sufficient. Alternatively, use an allocatable array. Hmm, but for simplicity, perhaps just use a large enough fixed length.\n\nOnce the input string is read, process each character:\n\nInitialize a result string, say, as a character array. Let's use a character array with a length that can grow. Since Fortran arrays are fixed size, perhaps we can use a dynamic approach with a character array and a current length variable.\n\nInitialize a character array, say, d, with a maximum possible size (like 1e5 or something), and a variable len_d starting at 0.\n\nLoop over each character in the input string s:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n    c = s(i:i)\n    select case (c)\n    case ('0')\n        len_d = len_d + 1\n        d(len_d) = '0'\n    case ('1')\n        len_d = len_d + 1\n        d(len_d) = '1'\n    case ('B')\n        if (len_d > 0) then\n            len_d = len_d - 1\n        end if\n    case default\n        ! ignore other characters, since the original Java code only processes 0,1,B\n    end select\nend do\n\nAfter processing, the resulting string is the first len_d characters of d. So the processed string is d(1:len_d).\n\nThen, convert this string to an integer n. But note that the string is made of 0 and 1, so it's a decimal number. For example, \"101\" would be 101.\n\nSo, converting the string to integer n:\n\nn = int(d(1:len_d), kind=8)  ! assuming it can be large, but in Fortran, integers can be 8-byte.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting a string to integer can be done with internal read:\n\nread(d(1:len_d), '(I0)') n\n\nBut need to handle cases where the string is empty. Wait, in the first Java program, if the processed string is empty, then the output is an empty string. But then the second program would read that as 0? Or an error?\n\nWait, in the second Java program, if the input is an empty string, the Scanner would throw an exception. But according to the problem's setup, the input to the second program is the output of the first. So if the first program's output is empty, then the second program would have no input, leading to an error. But perhaps the problem expects that the first program's output is a valid integer. So in the Fortran code, we need to handle that case. But perhaps the problem ensures that the input to the second program is a valid integer. So assuming that the processed string is non-empty and a valid integer.\n\nSo, after getting the processed string, we can read it as n.\n\nOnce n is obtained, compute the sum as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program's code is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {\n    ans += (long) i * ((long) n / (long) i) * (((long) n / (long) i) + 1) / 2;\n}\n\nWait, the loop is from 1 to n inclusive. The formula for each term is i multiplied by (n//i) multiplied by ( (n//i)+1 ) divided by 2. Let me see:\n\nThe term is i * ( (n div i) ) * ( (n div i) + 1 ) / 2.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each i from 1 to n:\n\nterm = i * (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) / 2\n\nBut in Fortran, integer division is done with / when both operands are integers. So n/i is integer division.\n\nWait, but in Java, (long) n / (long) i is equivalent to n divided by i as integers. So in Fortran, using integer division.\n\nThus, the code in Fortran would be:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    q = n / i\n    term = i * q * (q + 1) / 2\n    ans = ans + term\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations and integer division must be correct. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, n divided by i is q. Then term is i * q * (q+1)/2. Since all variables are integers, the division by 2 must be integer division. But in Fortran, if q is even, then (q+1) is odd, so (q*(q+1)) is even, so dividing by 2 is okay. So the term is an integer.\n\nThus, the code for the second part is straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n\n2. Process it to build the string d as per the first Java program.\n\n3. Convert d to integer n.\n\n4. Compute the sum as per the second Java program.\n\n5. Output the result.\n\nNow, handling the string processing in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input string. Let's read it as a character string. Let's use a large enough length, say 1e5.\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nThen, process each character. Let's use an array for d. Since the maximum possible length can't exceed the input length, perhaps we can use an array of the same length as s. Let's allocate an array of length len_trim(s), but in Fortran, arrays are fixed at declaration. Alternatively, use a character array with a large enough size, say 1e5, and track the current length.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: d\ninteger :: len_d = 0\n\nThen loop over each character in s:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n    c = s(i:i)\n    select case (c)\n    case ('0')\n        len_d = len_d + 1\n        d(len_d:len_d) = '0'\n    case ('1')\n        len_d = len_d + 1\n        d(len_d:len_d) = '1'\n    case ('B')\n        if (len_d > 0) then\n            len_d = len_d - 1\n        end if\n    case default\n        ! do nothing\n    end select\nend do\n\nWait, in Fortran, assigning a single character to a substring. So d is a character array, and each time we append a character by setting d(len_d+1) to the new character. Wait, but in the code above, d is a character array of length 100000, and we can set d(len_d+1:len_d+1) = '0' etc.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you have a character variable, you can assign a substring. So for example, d(1: len_d) is the current string. So when appending '0', we set len_d = len_d +1, then d(len_d:len_d) = '0'.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAfter processing, the resulting string is d(1:len_d). But if len_d is zero, then the string is empty, which would be a problem. But assuming the problem ensures that the input to the second program is valid, we can proceed.\n\nNow, converting the string to integer n:\n\nread(d(1:len_d), '(I0)') n\n\nBut in Fortran, if the string is empty, this would cause an error. So perhaps we need to check if len_d is zero. But according to the problem's setup, the first program's output is the input to the second, so if the first program outputs an empty string, the second program would have no input, leading to an error. So perhaps the problem expects that the input to the first program is such that the processed string is non-empty and a valid integer. So we can proceed under that assumption.\n\nThen compute the sum:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans = 0\ninteger :: i, q\ndo i = 1, n\n    q = n / i\n    ans = ans + i * q * (q + 1) / 2\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations is important. Let me make sure that the multiplication and division are done correctly. Since all variables are integers, the division by 2 must be integer division. Since q*(q+1) is even, it's okay.\n\nFinally, print the ans.\n\nprint *, ans\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s, d\n    integer :: len_d = 0, i, n\n    integer(kind=8) :: ans = 0\n    character :: c\n\n    ! Read input string\n    read(*,'(A)') s\n\n    ! Process the string\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        c = s(i:i)\n        select case (c)\n        case ('0')\n            len_d = len_d + 1\n            d(len_d:len_d) = '0'\n        case ('1')\n            len_d = len_d + 1\n            d(len_d:len_d) = '1'\n        case ('B')\n            if (len_d > 0) then\n                len_d = len_d - 1\n            end if\n        case default\n            ! Ignore other characters\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert processed string to integer n\n    read(d(1:len_d), '(I0)') n\n\n    ! Compute the sum\n    ans = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        integer :: q = n / i\n        ans = ans + i * q * (q + 1) / 2\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for the sum, the variable q is declared inside the loop. In Fortran, variables must be declared before the loop. Alternatively, compute q inline.\n\nAlternatively, compute q as n/i directly in the expression.\n\nWait, let me adjust the code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    ans = ans + i * (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) / 2\nend do\n\nThat way, no need for q. So the code becomes:\n\nans = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    ans = ans + i * (n / i) * ( (n / i) + 1 ) / 2\nend do\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The input string may have other characters besides 0,1,B. The original Java code ignores them, so the Fortran code does the same.\n\n- The processed string may be empty. If so, the read statement will fail. But according to the problem's setup, the input to the second program must be valid, so we can assume that the processed string is a valid integer.\n\nAnother thing: in the first Java program, the 'B' command removes the last character. The Fortran code correctly handles that by decrementing len_d when possible.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose input is \"0B1\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst character '0' \u2192 len_d becomes 1, d(1) = '0'.\n\nSecond character 'B' \u2192 len_d becomes 0.\n\nThird character '1' \u2192 len_d becomes 1, d(1) = '1'.\n\nSo the processed string is '1', so n is 1.\n\nThen the second part computes the sum for n=1:\n\ni from 1 to 1:\n\ni=1:\n\nterm = 1 * (1/1) * (1+1)/2 \u2192 1 *1 *2/2 \u2192 1*1*1 =1 \u2192 total ans=1.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: input \"10B\" \u2192 process:\n\n'1' \u2192 len_d=1, '1'\n\n'0' \u2192 len_d=2, '10'\n\n'B' \u2192 len_d=1 \u2192 '1'\n\nSo n=1 \u2192 same as before.\n\nAnother test case: input \"11B0\" \u2192 process:\n\n1 \u2192 '1'\n\n1 \u2192 '11'\n\nB \u2192 '1'\n\n0 \u2192 '10'\n\nso n=10 \u2192 then compute the sum for n=10.\n\nThe second Java program's code for n=10 would compute the sum as follows:\n\nThe formula for each i from 1 to 10:\n\nFor i=1: q=10 \u2192 term =1 *10 *11/2 \u2192 1*10*11/2 = 55 \u2192 55\n\ni=2: q=5 \u2192 2*5*6/2 \u2192 2*5*3 \u2192 30 \u2192 total 85\n\ni=3: q=3 \u2192 3*3*4/2 \u2192 3*3*2 \u2192 18 \u2192 total 103\n\ni=4: q=2 \u2192 4*2*3/2 \u2192 4*3 \u2192 12 \u2192 total 115\n\ni=5: q=2 \u2192 5*2*3/2 \u2192 15 \u2192 total 130\n\ni=6: q=1 \u2192 6*1*2/2 \u21926 \u2192 total 136\n\ni=7: q=1 \u2192 same as 6 \u2192 total 142\n\ni=8: q=1 \u2192 same \u2192 148\n\ni=9: q=1 \u2192 154\n\ni=10: q=1 \u2192 160.\n\nWait, let me compute each term step by step:\n\nWait, let me compute for n=10:\n\ni=1:\n\nq =10//1 =10 \u2192 term =1 *10*(10+1)/2 \u2192 1*10*11/2 \u2192 55 \u2192 ans +=55 \u2192 55\n\ni=2:\n\nq=5 \u2192 2 *5*(5+1)/2 \u2192 2*5*6/2 \u2192 30 \u2192 total 85\n\ni=3:\n\nq=3 \u2192 3*3*4/2 \u2192 3*3*2 \u2192 18 \u2192 total 103\n\ni=4:\n\nq=2 \u21924*2*3/2 \u21924*3 \u219212 \u2192 total 115\n\ni=5:\n\nq=2 \u21925*2*3/2 \u21925*3 \u219215 \u2192 total 130\n\ni=6:\n\nq=1 \u21926*1*2/2 \u21926 \u2192 total 136\n\ni=7:\n\nq=1 \u2192 same as 6 \u2192 total 142\n\ni=8:\n\nq=1 \u2192 same \u2192148\n\ni=9:\n\nq=1 \u2192148+9*1*2/2 \u21929 \u2192 total 157?\n\nWait, wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait for i=9:\n\nq =10//9 \u21921.\n\nterm is 9 *1*(1+1)/2 \u21929 *1*2/2 \u21929*1 \u21929 \u2192 adding to 136+9=145? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in previous steps.\n\nWait let me recalculate all terms for n=10:\n\nLet me list each term:\n\ni | q =10/i | term = i * q*(q+1)/2\n\n1 \u219210 \u21921*10*11/2 \u219255 \u2192 total 55\n\n2 \u21925 \u21922*5*6/2 \u219230 \u2192 total 85\n\n3 \u21923 \u21923*3*4/2 \u219218 \u2192 total 103\n\n4 \u21922 \u21924*2*3/2 \u219212 \u2192 total 115\n\n5 \u21922 \u21925*2*3/2 \u219215 \u2192 total 130\n\n6 \u21921 \u21926*1*2/2 \u21926 \u2192 total 136\n\n7 \u21921 \u21927*1*2/2 \u21927 \u2192 total 143\n\n8 \u21921 \u21928 \u2192 total 151\n\n9 \u21921 \u21929 \u2192 total 160\n\n10 \u21921 \u219210*1*2/2 \u219210 \u2192 total 170.\n\nWait, so the total would be 55+30=85, +18=103, +12=115, +15=130, +6=136, +7=143, +8=151, +9=160, +10=170.\n\nSo the final answer would be 170.\n\nSo in Fortran, when n=10, the code should compute 170.\n\nTesting the code with n=10, the loop would compute that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables:\n\n- The d array is declared as length 100000, which should be sufficient for most cases.\n\n- The read statement for the input string uses '(A)', which reads the entire line.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- If the input string is longer than 1e5, but that's unlikely given the problem constraints. Alternatively, use a larger length, but 1e5 is reasonable.\n\n- The processed string may be empty. But the problem's setup implies that the first program's output is a valid input for the second, so we can assume len_d >=1.\n\nThus, the code should work."
