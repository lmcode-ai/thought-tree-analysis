Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the tower's height is such that for all points, h[i] = max( ch - (distance from (cx,cy)), 0 ). So the ch must be the maximum possible height at the tower's position, which is the h[i] plus the distance from that point.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that behaves the same way when run in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_ABC112_C). It reads input from stdin: an integer n, followed by n lines each with x, y, h. Then it loops over i and j from 0 to MAX (100), and for each pair, it calls check. The check function determines if there's a possible ch such that for all points, h[i] equals max(ch - (distance from (i,j) to (x,y)), 0). If so, it prints i j ch. The first part's output is probably the parameters (i,j,ch) that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC124_A) takes two integers a and b, adds the two largest numbers (taking the larger each time and decrementing it), then outputs the sum. Wait, actually, the loop runs twice, so it picks the two largest numbers, adds them. For example, if a=5 and b=3, first add 5, then 4 and 3? Wait, no. Let me see the code again. The loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (two iterations). Each time, take the larger of a and b, add to sum, then decrement that. So for a=5, b=3: first iteration adds 5 (sum=5), a becomes 4. Second iteration adds 4 (sum=9), a becomes 3. So total is 9. Wait, but the second iteration would compare 4 and 3, so take 4 again. So the code is taking the top two numbers, but in a way that if they are equal, you take both. So the sum is a + b if they are different, but if a == b, then a + b -1? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration: pick the max of a and b, add to sum, then subtract 1 from that chosen one.\n\nSecond iteration: again pick the max of the new a and b (after first step), add to sum, subtract 1 again.\n\nSo for a=5, b=5: first iteration adds 5, a becomes 4. Second iteration adds 4 (since 4 and 5? Wait, no. Wait after first step, a was 5, so after adding, a becomes 4. Then in the second iteration, compare 4 and 5 (since b was 5, then after first step, b is still 5? Wait no, the first step was choosing a (since a was equal to b?), so in first step, a is chosen, so a becomes 4, b remains 5. Then second iteration, compare 4 and 5: choose 5, add to sum (total 5+5=10?), then subtract 1 from b, so b becomes 4. So total sum is 5+5=10. Wait, but original a and b were 5 and 5, so the sum is 5+5=10. So the code is effectively taking the two largest possible numbers, but each time after taking the larger, you decrease it by 1. So the total is (a + b) if a and b are different, but if they are same, then a + b? Wait, in the case a=5 and b=5, the sum is 5+5=10, which is exactly a + b. Hmm, so maybe the code is just adding the two largest numbers, but when they are equal, you can take both. Wait, perhaps the code is equivalent to taking the two largest numbers, but if they are the same, you can take both. Wait, but in the case a=3 and b=3, first iteration takes 3 (sum 3), a becomes 2. Second iteration takes 3 (since b is still 3?), so sum becomes 6. So yes, 3+3=6. So the code is effectively adding a + b. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nsum += max(a,b), then subtract 1 from that max. Then repeat.\n\nSo for a=3 and b=3:\n\nFirst iteration: max is 3 (either a or b, but let's say a). sum +=3, a becomes 2. Then next iteration, compare 2 and 3 (b is still 3). So take 3, add to sum (total 6), then subtract 1 from b, so b becomes 2. So total is 6, which is 3+3. So the code is indeed adding a + b. Wait, but then why the loop? Because in the first case, when a and b are different, like a=5 and b=3, the first iteration takes 5, then 4 (since after first step a is 4, and b is 3). So 5+4=9, which is 5+3 +1? Wait, 5+3 is 8, but the code gives 9. Wait, 5+4 is 9. So the code is actually taking the two largest possible numbers, but after taking the first, you decrease it by 1, so the second time you can take the next highest. So the total is (a + b) if a and b are different, but when they are same, it's a + b. Wait, but in the case a=5 and b=3, the sum is 5+4=9, which is (5+3) +1? Hmm, so the code is actually adding a + b + 1 when a != b? Wait, 5+3 is 8, but the code gives 9. So that's not. Wait, perhaps the code is adding the two largest possible numbers, but when they are different, you can take the larger one and then the next possible. Let me think again:\n\nWait, the first step takes the maximum of a and b, adds it to the sum, then subtracts 1 from that maximum. The second step takes the new maximum (after the first subtraction) and adds that. So for a=5 and b=3:\n\nFirst step: max is 5 (a). sum +=5, a becomes 4. Second step: max between 4 and 3 is 4. sum +=4 \u2192 total 9. So the total is 5 +4 =9. Which is (a + (a-1)) if a is larger than b. So the code is effectively taking the two largest possible numbers, but after taking the first, you can't take the same again unless it's still the maximum. So the code's output is the sum of the two largest numbers, but with the first one being taken and then reduced by 1. So the total is (max(a,b) + (max(a,b) -1) if the other is smaller. Wait, but if a and b are equal, then first step takes a, subtract 1, then next step takes the new a (a-1) or the other (still same as original). Wait, let's see a=4 and b=4. First step: take 4, subtract 1 \u2192 a=3. Then next step, compare 3 and 4 (b is still 4). So take 4, subtract 1 \u2192 b=3. Sum is 4+4=8, which is 4+4. So the code's output is a + b when a and b are equal, and (max + (max-1)) when one is larger. So the code's output is the sum of the two largest possible numbers, but when they are different, it's the max plus (max-1). Wait, but when a=5 and b=3, the sum is 5+4=9, which is 5+ (5-1) =9. So yes, that's the case. So the code's output is the maximum of a and b plus the next maximum (which is either the other number or the max-1). So the code's output is (max(a,b) + max(a,b, b) -1 if a != b? Not sure, but the code's logic is clear.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two Java programs. The first program's output is the parameters (i j ch) that satisfy the condition. Then, the second program takes two numbers as input. Wait, but the first program's output is three numbers. Wait, the second program expects two numbers as input. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first two numbers (i and j) as a and b? Or maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes two of them. Wait, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the three numbers (i j ch), and the second program takes that as input. But the second program expects two numbers. So perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program only reads the first two? Or maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first two as a and b. That must be the case. So the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program reads two numbers from that output. So the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first two as a and b, and ignores the third? Or maybe the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program reads two numbers (the first two) as its input. So the second program's input is the first two numbers from the first program's output.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is a line with three numbers (i j ch). The second program expects two numbers as input. So the second program will read the first two numbers (i and j) from the first program's output, and ignore the third? Or perhaps the first program's output is three numbers, but the second program takes the first two as a and b. So the second program's input is the first two numbers from the first program's output. So the second program's input is the first two numbers of the first's output. So the second program's input is the i and j from the first program's output. So the final Fortran program must read the input for the first Java program, process it through the first's logic, then take the first two numbers of the first's output (i and j) and pass them to the second's logic, then output the result of the second's processing.\n\nWait, but the first Java program may output multiple lines. Wait, looking at the first Java program's code: in the for loops over i and j up to MAX (100), for each (i,j), it calls check, and if ch>0, it prints the line. So the first program could output multiple lines. But the second program expects two numbers as input. So perhaps the first program's output is only the first valid line (the first i,j,ch that satisfies the condition), and the second program takes the first two numbers from that line. Or maybe the first program's output is only one line, but how?\n\nWait, looking at the first Java program's code: the check function returns ch only if all the h[i] match the condition. So the first program loops over all possible (i,j) from 0 to 100, and for each, if check returns a positive ch, it prints the line. So there could be multiple lines printed. But the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So if the first program outputs multiple lines, then the second program would read the first two numbers from the first line, then the next two from the second line, etc. But the second program only reads two numbers. So perhaps the first program's output is only one line. Wait, in the problem's context, perhaps the first program is designed to output exactly one line (the correct i,j,ch). Because in the problem ABC112_C, the problem is to find the coordinates of the tower and its height. So there should be exactly one solution. So the first program would output exactly one line. So the second program takes the first two numbers (i and j) as a and b, and computes their sum as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n followed by n lines of x y h).\n\n2. Process it through the first program's logic to find the i,j,ch (the first valid line, or the correct one).\n\n3. Take the first two numbers (i and j) from that output.\n\n4. Process them through the second program's logic (sum the two largest numbers as per the second Java's code).\n\n5. Output the result of the second program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must combine both steps into one, without I/O in between.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's logic:\n\nThe first Java program reads n, then n lines of x, y, h. Then loops over i and j from 0 to 100 (since MAX is 100). For each (i,j), compute check, and if ch>0, print the line.\n\nThe check function:\n\ndef check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy):\n\n    ch = -1\n\n    for each point where h[i]>0:\n\n        compute ch as |x[i]-cx| + |y[i]-cy| + h[i]\n\n        break (so take the first h[i]>0's value?)\n\n    then check for all points:\n\n        h[i] must equal max( ch - (distance), 0 )\n\n    if all pass, return ch, else -1.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nIn check:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (h[i]>0) {\n\n      ch = ... break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo the first h[i] that is positive is used to compute ch. Then, check all points.\n\nWait, the code loops through all i from 0 to n-1, and when it finds the first h[i] >0, it sets ch to the distance plus h[i], then breaks. So ch is determined by the first non-zero h. But that might not be correct. Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the tower's height is such that for all points, h[i] = max( ch - (distance from (cx,cy)), 0 ). So the ch must be the maximum possible height at the tower's position, which is the h[i] plus the distance from that point. So the first h[i] that is non-zero is used to compute ch, but only if all other points satisfy the condition. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\nRead n, then read n lines of x, y, h arrays.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 100 (cx), j from 0 to 100 (cy). For each (cx,cy):\n\n   call check subroutine to compute ch.\n\n   if ch >0, then store the first such (cx,cy,ch) and break? Or need to find the correct one?\n\nWait, the original code prints all (i,j,ch) that satisfy the condition. But in the problem's context, there should be exactly one solution. So perhaps the first valid (i,j) is the correct one, but the code may have multiple outputs. However, in the problem's context, the code is designed to find the correct tower's coordinates and height, so there is exactly one solution. So the first occurrence where check returns a positive ch is the correct one, and the code would print that. But in the code, it loops through all i and j, so it may print multiple lines if there are multiple solutions. But in the problem's case, there is only one solution, so the first occurrence would be the correct one. However, the code may print all possible solutions. But since the second program takes the first two numbers from the first program's output, which is the first line's i and j, that's what we need to capture.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, after processing the first part, we need to find the first (cx, cy, ch) where check returns a positive value, then take cx and cy as a and b for the second part.\n\nWait, but the first program may have multiple outputs. So in the Fortran code, we need to process all possible (i,j) in order, and once we find the first valid (cx, cy, ch), we can take those values and proceed to the second part. Because the second program would read the first two numbers from the first program's output, which is the first line's i and j.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first program's output is only one line, so the first valid (i,j,ch) is the correct one, and the code can stop after finding it. But the original code loops through all i and j, so it may not stop early. However, in the problem's context, there is only one solution, so the first occurrence is the correct one, and the rest are redundant. So in the Fortran code, once we find the first valid (cx, cy, ch), we can store those values and break out of the loops early to save computation. That would be more efficient.\n\nSo the plan for the Fortran code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines of x, y, h arrays (arrays starting at 1? Or 0? In Java, arrays are 0-based. In Fortran, arrays can be 1-based, but we can use 0-based by declaring with lower bound 0. So perhaps better to use 0-based indices.)\n\nThen loop over cx from 0 to 100:\n\n   loop over cy from 0 to 100:\n\n      call check subroutine to compute ch.\n\n      if ch >0:\n\n          store cx, cy, ch.\n\n          exit the loops (since we found the first valid solution, which is the one the first program would output first, so the second program would take those first two numbers)\n\nOnce found, proceed to the second part.\n\nWait, but the original code may have multiple solutions. However, in the problem's context, there is exactly one solution, so the first occurrence is the correct one. So in the Fortran code, once found, we can break out of the loops.\n\nThen, the second part's logic is to take a = cx, b = cy, and compute the sum as per the second Java program.\n\nWait, the second Java program takes two numbers as input, which are a and b. The first program's output is three numbers: i j ch. So the second program's input is the first two numbers (i and j). So in the Fortran code, after finding cx and cy, those are the a and b for the second part.\n\nSo the second part's logic is:\n\nsum = 0\n\ndo i = 1 to 2:\n\n   if a >= b:\n\n       sum += a\n\n       a = a -1\n\n   else:\n\n       sum += b\n\n       b = b -1\n\nthen print sum.\n\nSo in Fortran, after getting a and b (cx and cy), compute the sum as per that loop.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nWe need to read n, then n lines of x, y, h. Let's declare arrays for x, y, h, with indices from 0 to n-1 (since in Java they are 0-based). In Fortran, arrays can be declared with lower bound 0, but by default they start at 1. So perhaps better to use 1-based, but adjust accordingly. Alternatively, use 0-based by declaring with (/0:n-1/). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can read the input as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with three integers. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: x, y, h\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(x(n), y(n), h(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*,*) x(i), y(i), h(i)\n\nend do\n\nBut in Java, the arrays are 0-based, so in the code, the first element is x[0], but in Fortran, it's x(1). So when translating the check function, need to adjust indices.\n\nWait, in the check function in Java:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (h[i]>0) {\n\n      ch = ... \n\n      break;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to n, and h(i) is h(1) to h(n). So the code must be adjusted for indices.\n\nNow, the check subroutine in Fortran:\n\nsubroutine check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy, ch_result)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: n, x(n), y(n), h(n), cx, cy\n\n   integer, intent(out) :: ch_result\n\n   integer :: i, ch\n\n   ch = -1\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) > 0) then\n\n         ch = abs(x(i) - cx) + abs(y(i) - cy) + h(i)\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (ch == -1) then\n\n      ch_result = -1\n\n      return\n\n   end if\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) /= max(ch - (abs(x(i)-cx) + abs(y(i)-cy)), 0) ) then\n\n         ch_result = -1\n\n         return\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ch_result = ch\n\nend subroutine check\n\nWait, but in the original code, the first loop breaks after the first h[i]>0. So in Fortran, once found, exit the loop. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, j, cx, cy, ch, a, b, sum, temp\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: x, y, h\n\n   !

Find the correct cx, cy, ch\n\n   cx = -1\n\n   cy = -1\n\n   ch = -1\n\n   outer: do i = 0, 100\n\n      do j = 0, 100\n\n         call check(n, x, y, h, i, j, ch_result)\n\n         if (ch_result > 0) then\n\n            cx = i\n\n            cy = j\n\n            ch = ch_result\n\n            exit outer\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do outer\n\n   ! Now, compute the second part's result using a = cx, b = cy\n\n   a = cx\n\n   b = cy\n\n   sum = 0\n\n   do temp = 1, 2\n\n      if (a >= b) then\n\n         sum = sum + a\n\n         a = a -1\n\n      else\n\n         sum = sum + b\n\n         b = b -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   print*, sum\n\ncontains\n\n   subroutine check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy, ch_result)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: n, x(n), y(n), h(n), cx, cy\n\n      integer, intent(out) :: ch_result\n\n      integer :: i, ch\n\n      ch = -1\n\n      do i = 1, n\n\n         if (h(i) > 0) then\n\n            ch = abs(x(i) - cx) + abs(y(i) - cy) + h(i)\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      if (ch == -1) then\n\n         ch_result = -1\n\n         return\n\n      end if\n\n      do i = 1, n\n\n         if (h(i) /= max(ch - (abs(x(i)-cx) + abs(y(i)-cy)), 0) ) then\n\n            ch_result = -1\n\n            return\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n      ch_result = ch\n\n   end subroutine check\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loops for cx and cy, in Fortran, the variables are i and j. The outer loop is over i from 0 to 100 (cx), and inner over j (cy). The first occurrence where check returns a positive ch is stored, and then exit the loops.\n\nWait, in the outer loop, the loop variable is i (cx), but in the code above, the outer loop is labeled as outer, and when found, it exits the outer loop (the i loop). So the first cx and cy that satisfy the condition will be stored, and the loops exit early. That's correct.\n\nNow, the variables cx and cy are 0-based, as per the original Java code (since in Java, the loops are from 0 to MAX). So in the second part, a and b are cx and cy, which are the correct values.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is two integers a and b. The first program's output is three numbers, but the second takes the first two (i and j). So yes, cx and cy are the correct a and b.\n\nNow, the second part's loop runs twice, adding the larger of a and b each time, then decrementing that.\n\nThe code in Fortran for that part is as written.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nSuppose the first program's solution is (5,3, ...). Then a=5, b=3. The second part's sum would be 5 +4 =9, which matches the earlier example.\n\nAnother test case: if the first program's output is (3,3, ...), then a=3, b=3. The sum is 3+3=6.\n\nAnother case: (4,5). Then first iteration takes 5 (b), adds to sum (5), then b becomes 4. Second iteration takes 4 (a is 4, b is 4?), so sum is 5+4=9.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na=4, b=5.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\na=4, b=5 \u2192 b is larger. sum +=5 \u2192 sum=5. b becomes 4.\n\nSecond iteration: a=4, b=4 \u2192 choose either. Let's say a (since a is equal to b). sum +=4 \u2192 total 9. a becomes 3. So total is 5+4=9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The check function in Fortran must correctly handle the indices. Since in Java the arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran they are 1-based. So in the check subroutine, the loop over i from 1 to n is correct.\n\n- The loops for cx and cy in Fortran are from 0 to 100, inclusive. The outer loop is over i (cx) from 0 to 100, inner over j (cy) from 0 to 100. The first valid (i,j) found will be stored and the loops exit.\n\n- The check subroutine returns ch_result. The code in the main program calls check with cx=i and cy=j, and if ch_result>0, then stores and exits.\n\nAnother thing: in the check subroutine, the second loop (checking all points) must ensure that for every point, h(i) equals max( ch - (distance), 0 ). The Fortran code uses the max function. In Fortran, the max function for two arguments is max(a,b). So the expression is max( ch - (distance), 0 ). So that's correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the max function is intrinsic. So the code uses:\n\nif (h(i) /= max(ch - (distance), 0) ) then\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the loops for cx and cy, the order of checking. The original Java code loops i from 0 to MAX, then j from 0 to MAX. So the order is i (cx) first, then j (cy). The first valid (i,j) encountered in this order is the one that would be printed first, so the second program would take that i and j. The Fortran code does the same loops, so the first occurrence is the same as the original.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
