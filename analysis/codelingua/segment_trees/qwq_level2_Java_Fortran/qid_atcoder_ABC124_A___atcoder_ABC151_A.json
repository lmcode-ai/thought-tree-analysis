    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC124_A) reads two integers a and b from input. Then it calculates a sum by taking the larger of the two each time, adding it to the sum, and decrementing that number. It does this twice. The sum is then printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ABC151_A) reads a string, takes the first character, adds 1 to its ASCII value, and prints that character. Wait, but the code here is a bit confusing. The code in the second file's main method is:\n\ns = r.readLine();\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0) + 1);\n\nSo, it reads a line, takes the first character, increments it by 1, and outputs it. But the input for the second program would be the output of the first. Wait, but the first program outputs a sum, which is a number. So the second program is taking that number as input? Wait, no, the first program's output is a number, so the second program's input would be that number as a string. But then the second program is taking the first character of that string, which would be the first digit of the sum, and adding 1 to its ASCII value. Hmm, that's a bit odd. Wait, for example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\", so the first character is '1' (ASCII 49), adding 1 gives 50 which is '2', so it would output '2'.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's code is in a class called atcoder_ABC151_A, and the main method reads a line, then outputs the first character plus 1. So the entire sequence is: first program takes two numbers, computes sum as described, outputs the sum. Then the second program takes that sum as input (as a string), takes the first character of that string, increments its ASCII value by 1, and outputs that character.\n\nSo the Fortran program needs to do both steps in sequence, without I/O in between. So the first part (the first Java program's logic) must read the input (the two integers a and b), compute the sum, then pass that result to the second part (the second Java program's logic), which takes that sum as a string, processes it, and outputs the final character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how do I handle this? The entire process must be in one program. So first, read a and b from input. Then compute the sum as per the first Java program. Then, take that sum, convert it to a string, take the first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read as a line, so the first program's output is written to the second's input. So in the Fortran program, after computing the sum, we don't output it, but instead process it as the input for the second step.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read a and b from input.\n\n2. Compute the sum as per the first Java program's loop.\n\n3. Convert the sum to a string (since in the second step, the input is the string representation of the sum).\n\n4. Take the first character of that string, increment its ASCII value by 1, and output that character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how do I convert an integer to a string? I can use internal write or the intrinsic function. For example, using write(*,*) sum would output it, but here I need to get the string representation. So perhaps using the 'adjustl' function or using an internal write.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, to get the first character of the sum as a string, I can do something like:\n\ncharacter(len=12) :: sum_str\nwrite(sum_str, '(i0)') sum_val\nfirst_char = sum_str(1:1)\nthen, convert that character to its ASCII code, add 1, then output as a character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via ichar and char functions. So:\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst part (Java's first program):\n\nRead a and b.\n\nsum = 0\n\nloop twice:\n\neach time, take the larger of a and b, add to sum, decrement that value.\n\nWait, the loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (since 2 iterations). So two iterations.\n\nSo code in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: a, b, sum_val, temp_a, temp_b\n\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nsum_val = 0\n\ntemp_a = a\n\ntemp_b = b\n\ndo i = 1, 2\n\n   if (temp_a >= temp_b) then\n\n      sum_val = sum_val + temp_a\n\n      temp_a = temp_a - 1\n\n   else\n\n      sum_val = sum_val + temp_b\n\n      temp_b = temp_b - 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, the second part:\n\nTake sum_val, convert to a string, take first character, add 1 to its ASCII value, output.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: sum_str\n\nwrite(sum_str, '(i0)') sum_val\n\nfirst_char = sum_str(1:1)\n\ninteger :: ascii_code = ichar(first_char)\n\nascii_code = ascii_code + 1\n\nresult_char = char(ascii_code)\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') result_char\n\nWait, but what if the sum is a single-digit number? Like 5. Then the string is \"5\", so first character is '5', adding 1 gives '6', which is correct.\n\nIf the sum is 99, then first character is '9', adding 1 gives 'A' (since 57 +1 is 58, which is ':'? Wait, no, 57 is '9', so 57+1 is 58 which is ':' in ASCII. Hmm, but the original Java code would do that. So the Fortran code must do the same.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is the output of the first. So if the first program outputs 99, then the second program's input is \"99\", so the first character is '9', adding 1 gives 58, which is ':'.\n\nSo the Fortran code must do exactly that.\n\nNow, putting it all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nBut need to make sure that the first part reads the input, the second part processes the sum without any I/O in between.\n\nSo the entire Fortran program would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: a, b, sum_val, temp_a, temp_b, i\n  character(len=20) :: sum_str\n  character :: first_char\n  integer :: ascii_code\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) a, b\n\n  temp_a = a\n  temp_b = b\n  sum_val = 0\n\n  do i = 1, 2\n     if (temp_a >= temp_b) then\n        sum_val = sum_val + temp_a\n        temp_a = temp_a - 1\n     else\n        sum_val = sum_val + temp_b\n        temp_b = temp_b - 1\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert sum to string\n  write(sum_str, '(i0)') sum_val\n  first_char = sum_str(1:1)\n\n  ! Process the first character\n  ascii_code = ichar(first_char)\n  ascii_code = ascii_code + 1\n  first_char = char(ascii_code)\n\n  ! Output the result\n  write(*, '(a)') trim(adjustl(first_char))\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but when writing the sum_str, the write statement may have leading spaces if the number is shorter than the allocated length. For example, if sum_val is 5, then sum_str would be \"          5\" (with leading spaces). So taking the first character would be a space, which is not desired. So need to make sure that the string is properly formatted without leading spaces.\n\nAh, right. The format '(i0)' should write the integer without leading spaces, but in Fortran, when using list-directed I/O (like * in format), but here using '(i0)' which is a format that writes the integer in default format. Wait, the 'i0' edit descriptor writes the integer in decimal form with no leading blanks. So the sum_str should be correctly written as the number's string without leading spaces. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the 'i0' format writes the integer in the shortest possible field, so leading spaces shouldn't be an issue. So the first character is the first digit of the number.\n\nWait, but if the sum is negative? Well, according to the first Java program, the sum is adding two integers, but since in each step they take the larger of a and b, which are initially read as integers. But the problem might have constraints that a and b are positive? The original Java code doesn't check, but perhaps in the problem's context, the inputs are such that the sum is non-negative. Since the problem is from AtCoder, perhaps the inputs are such that the sum is a positive number, so the string will start with a digit.\n\nAssuming that, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: if the sum is a single-digit number, like 5, then the string is \"5\", so first character is '5', which is correct. If the sum is 0, then the first character is '0', adding 1 gives '1'.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the sum could be zero? Let's see: if a and b are both 0, then first iteration: a is 0, b is 0, so pick a (since equal), add 0, then a becomes -1. Next iteration, compare -1 and 0: pick 0, add 0, so total sum is 0. So the second program would take '0' as the first character, add 1 to get '1'.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case: let's say a=3, b=5.\n\nFirst iteration: since 5 is larger, add 5 (sum=5), then b becomes 4.\n\nSecond iteration: compare 3 and 4: 4 is larger. Add 4 (sum=9). So total sum is 9. The second program would take '9', add 1 to get ':', so output ':'.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. First iteration: take 5, sum becomes 5, a becomes 4. Second iteration: compare 4 and 5: take 5, add to sum (total 10). So the string is \"10\", first character '1', adding 1 gives '2'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the write statement for sum_str uses '(i0)', which should write the number correctly. The first character is then taken, converted to ASCII, etc.\n\nThe final output is written with write(*, '(a)') trim(adjustl(first_char)). Wait, but first_char is a single character, so trim and adjustl are redundant here. Because first_char is a single character variable, so it's just that character. So perhaps just write(*, '(a)') first_char would suffice. But to be safe, maybe better to use adjustl in case there are leading blanks, but in this case, since first_char is a single character, it's okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you assign first_char = char(ascii_code), the variable is a single character, so writing it with '(a)' should output just that character. So the trim is unnecessary here.\n\nSo the final write statement can be:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') first_char\n\nAlternatively, using an asterisk:\n\nwrite(*,*) first_char\n\nBut that might add a newline, which is okay. The original Java code for the second program uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which would output the character without a newline? Wait, no, the printf with %c would just output the character, but in Java, System.out.println adds a newline, but here it's printf, so it's just the character. So in Fortran, using write(*, '(a)') would output the character followed by a new line. The original Java code's second program's output is the character followed by a new line? Let me check the Java code:\n\nThe second Java program's main method ends with System.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0)+1); which outputs the character and no newline. Wait, because printf doesn't add a newline unless specified. So in Java, the output is just the single character, without a newline. But in Fortran, the default write statement with '(a)' would add a new line. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is System.out.println(sum), which adds a newline. So the second program's input is that sum followed by a newline. Then the second program reads the entire line (including the newline?), but in Java, readLine() reads up to the newline and excludes it. So the input to the second program is the sum as a string, without the newline. Then the second program outputs the character without a newline. Wait, no, the second program's code uses printf with %c, so it just outputs the character, but no newline. So the total output of the two programs is the sum followed by the character, each on their own lines? Or the first outputs the sum with a newline, then the second outputs the character without a newline, so the total output is sum\\n followed by the character, but that would be on the same line as the sum's newline?\n\nWait, let me think again. The first Java program's output is System.out.println(sum), which outputs the sum followed by a newline. The second program reads that entire line (the sum plus the newline?), but readLine() in Java reads until the newline and returns the characters before the newline. So the input to the second program is the sum as a string. Then the second program outputs the character without a newline. So the total output is sum followed by a newline, then the character, with no newline after. But in Fortran, the first program's code would output the character with a newline. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, the second Java program's code is:\n\nSystem.out.printf(\"%c\", s.charAt(0)+1);\n\nSo that outputs the character, but no newline. So the total output of the two programs is the first's output (sum + newline) followed by the second's output (the character, no newline). So the final output is sum\\n followed by the character, but on the next line? Or same line?\n\nWait, the first program's output is sum followed by a newline. The second program's output is the character, so the total would be:\n\nsum\nc\n\nwhere 'c' is the character. So two lines. But in the Fortran code, the first part's output is the character with a newline. So the Fortran code's output would be the same as the second Java program's output, which is just the character without a newline? Or does the Fortran code need to output the character without a newline?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me check the exact outputs.\n\nFirst Java program's output is:\n\nSystem.out.println(sum);\n\nSo that adds a newline. The second program's input is that sum followed by a newline. But readLine() in the second program reads until the newline, so the input is the sum as a string. Then the second program outputs the character with printf, which does not add a newline. So the total output is:\n\nsum\\n followed by the character, with no newline. So the final output is two lines: the first line is the sum, the second line is the character? No, because the second program's output is the character without a newline. Wait, no. The first program's output is sum followed by a newline. The second program's output is the character, but without a newline. So the total output is:\n\nsum\nc\n\nwhere 'c' is the character, but the 'c' is on the same line as the newline from the first program? Or after the newline?\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"sum\\n\", then the second program's output is \"c\", so the combined output is \"sum\\nc\", which would display as the sum on the first line, then the character on the next line? Because the newline is already there. Wait, no. The first program's output is \"sum\\n\", so the second program's output is written after that, so the total is \"sum\\nc\", which would display as the sum followed by a newline, then the character on the next line. Wait, no, the newline is already there. So the first line is the sum, then the second line is the character. So the total output is two lines.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the first part's output is the character with a newline. So the Fortran code's output would be just the character followed by a newline, which is different from the original sequence's output (which has two lines). Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the original sequence's output is the first program's output (sum + newline) and the second program's output (character with no newline). So the total is sum followed by a newline, then the character. So the final output is two lines: first the sum, then the character on the next line? Or the character is on the same line as the sum's newline?\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"sum\\n\", so the second program's output is written after that. So the total is \"sum\\nc\", which would display as:\n\nsum\nc\n\nSo two lines. The first line is the sum, the second line is the character.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the entire process is done in one program. The first part's output is not written; instead, the second part's output is the character followed by a newline (if we use write(*,*)). So the Fortran code's output would be just the character followed by a newline, which is different from the original's two lines.\n\nAh, so this is a problem. The original sequence outputs two lines, but the Fortran code would output only one line (the character with a newline). So that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal sequence:\n\nProgram 1 outputs sum followed by a newline.\n\nProgram 2 reads that sum, processes it, and outputs the character without a newline. So the total output is:\n\nsum\\n followed by the character. So the actual output is the sum on the first line, then the character on the same line as the newline? Or the second program's output is after the newline, so the character is on the next line but without a newline. So the total would be:\n\nsum\n\nc\n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose the first program outputs \"123\\n\", then the second program outputs 'A' (without a newline). The combined output would be \"123\\nA\", which when displayed would show \"123\" on the first line, then \"A\" on the next line but without a newline. So the second line is just \"A\".\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the output is just the character followed by a newline (if we use write(*,*)). So the Fortran code would output \"A\\n\", which would be a single line with \"A\".\n\nThis discrepancy is a problem. So the Fortran code must output exactly the same as the original sequence. So the original sequence's output is two lines: first the sum, then the character on the next line. Wait, no, the second program's output is the character without a newline, so the total is sum followed by a newline, then the character. So the output is:\n\nsum\nc\n\nwhere 'c' is the character, but the 'c' is on the same line as the newline from the first program? Or after the newline?\n\nWait, the first program's output is \"sum\\n\", so the second program's output is written after that. So the total is \"sum\\nc\", which when displayed would be:\n\nsum\nc\n\nSo two lines. The first line is \"sum\", the second line is \"c\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code must output two lines: the first line is the sum, the second line is the character. Wait, but the second program in the original sequence does not output the sum. The first program outputs the sum, then the second program outputs the character. So the total output is the sum followed by a newline, then the character followed by nothing. So the second line is just the character. So the Fortran code must output the sum followed by a newline, then the character followed by a newline? Or just the character?\n\nWait, the second Java program's code does not add a newline. So the total output is the sum followed by a newline, then the character. So the final output is two lines: first line is the sum, second line is the character. Because the first program's output ends with a newline, and the second program's output is the character, so it's on the next line but without a trailing newline. However, in practice, when you run the two Java programs in sequence, the second program's output would be on the next line because the first program's output ended with a newline. So the total output is two lines: first the sum, then the character.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must output the same: first the sum followed by a newline, then the character followed by a newline? Or just the character?\n\nWait, the second Java program's output is the character without a newline. So the total output is sum\\n followed by the character. So the second line is just the character, but without a newline. However, in many systems, the output is line-buffered, so the second program's output may not appear until a newline is printed. But in the problem's context, perhaps the required output is exactly the two lines: the first line is the sum, the second line is the character. Or maybe the second program's output is just the character, so the total is sum followed by a newline and then the character, but the second line is just the character.\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code must produce the same output as the original sequence. So the original sequence's output is the first program's output (sum + newline) followed by the second program's output (character with no newline). So the total is sum\\n followed by the character. So the Fortran code must output the same: first the sum followed by a newline, then the character, without a newline. But in Fortran, how to do that?\n\nWait, but in the Fortran code, the first program's output is not done. The first program's output is the sum, but in the Fortran code, that sum is not printed. Instead, the second part's output is the character. So the Fortran code's output is only the character, but the original sequence outputs the sum and then the character. Wait, that's a problem. Oh wait, no! Wait, the original sequence is two programs run in sequence. The first program outputs the sum, which is then the input to the second program. The second program's output is the character. So the total output of the entire sequence is the sum (from first program) plus the character (from second program). So the Fortran program must output both the sum and the character, but according to the user's instructions:\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior.\n\n- Only the first block should handle reading input.\n\n- Only the last block should handle producing output.\n\n- Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\n- Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\"\n\nAh! So the final Fortran program must produce the same output as the original sequence. The original sequence's output is the first program's output (sum) followed by the second program's output (character). Therefore, the Fortran program must output both the sum and the character. But according to the user's instructions, only the last block (the second part) should handle producing output. Wait, but the first block (the first Java program's part) in the Fortran code must not output anything except through the last block.\n\nWait, the user's instructions say:\n\n\"Only the first block should handle reading input.\n\nOnly the last block should handle producing output.\n\nIntermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\nDo not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\"\n\nSo the entire Fortran program must read input (the two integers) at the beginning, process everything internally, and then output the final result (the character) at the end. But the original sequence outputs the sum (from first program) and then the character (from second program). So the Fortran program must output only the character, not the sum. Because the first program's output is used as input to the second program, but in the final Fortran program, the first program's output is not needed as output, only the second's final output is needed.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point I missed earlier. The user wants the entire sequence's behavior, but the intermediate outputs (the first program's output) are not part of the final output. Because in the original sequence, the first program's output is the input to the second program. The final output is only the second program's output. So the Fortran program must read the input (the two integers), process them through both steps, and output only the final result (the character). The first program's output is not part of the final output; it's just an intermediate step.\n\nOh! That changes everything. I was confused earlier thinking that the first program's output is part of the final output, but according to the problem's instructions, the final Fortran program should only output what the last block (second Java program) outputs. The first block's output is only used as input to the second block, but in the Fortran program, since it's all in one, that intermediate data is just passed internally.\n\nSo the Fortran program must read the two integers, compute the sum (as per first Java program), then process that sum as per the second Java program's logic (convert to string, take first character, add 1, output that character). So the final output is just the character, not the sum. The sum is an intermediate step.\n\nSo my initial code was correct in that aspect. The confusion earlier was because I thought the first program's output was part of the final output, but according to the problem's instructions, the final program should only output what the last block (second Java program) outputs. So the sum is not part of the output, only the character.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code I wrote earlier is correct except for the output formatting.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe first Java program's output is the sum, which is the input to the second program. The second program's output is the character. So the entire sequence's output is the character. Therefore, the Fortran program must output only the character. So the code I wrote earlier is correct except for the output's newline.\n\nThe second Java program's output is the character without a newline. So the Fortran program must output the character without a newline. But in Fortran, the default write statement adds a newline. So to avoid that, perhaps use an edit descriptor that doesn't add a newline.\n\nIn Fortran, to write a character without a trailing newline, you can use:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') first_char\n\nThis will write the character followed by a newline. Wait, no. The format '(a)' in a write statement with unit * will write the character and then advance to the next line. To suppress the newline, you can use the advance='no' option.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') first_char\n\nThis way, it writes the character without a newline.\n\nAh, right. So the final write statement should be:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') first_char\n\nBut in some Fortran versions, the default might be to advance, so to ensure no newline, that's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows a trailing newline, but the original code doesn't have it, then we need to match that.\n\nThe second Java program's code uses System.out.printf(\"%c\", ...), which does not add a newline. So the Fortran code must also not add a newline. So using advance='no' is needed.\n\nTherefore, the final code should have:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') first_char\n\nBut in some cases, the program might need to flush the output, but in Fortran, I think it's handled.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct Fortran code is:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: a, b, sum_val, temp_a, temp_b, i\n  character(len=20) :: sum_str\n  character :: first_char\n  integer :: ascii_code\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) a, b\n\n  temp_a = a\n  temp_b = b\n  sum_val = 0\n\n  do i = 1, 2\n     if (temp_a >= temp_b) then\n        sum_val = sum_val + temp_a\n        temp_a = temp_a - 1\n     else\n        sum_val = sum_val + temp_b\n        temp_b = temp_b - 1\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert sum to string\n  write(sum_str, '(i0)') sum_val\n  first_char = sum_str(1:1)\n\n  ! Process the first character\n  ascii_code = ichar(first_char)\n  ascii_code = ascii_code + 1\n  first_char = char(ascii_code)\n\n  ! Output the result without a newline\n  write(*, '(a)', advance='no') first_char\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but what if the sum is a negative number? For example, if a and b are both negative. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a = -1, b = -2.\n\nFirst iteration: a is -1, b is -2. a is larger. Add a (-1) to sum (sum becomes -1). Then a becomes -2.\n\nSecond iteration: compare -2 and -2. Take a (since equal?), add -2. Sum is -3.\n\nThe string would be \"-3\", so first character is '-', adding 1 gives 45 (ASCII for '-') +1 = 46 which is '.'.\n\nSo the output would be '.'.\n\nThe second Java program would process the input \"-3\", take first character '-', add 1, output '.'.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. The string is \"0\", first character '0' becomes '1'.\n\nAnother case: sum is 100. The first character is '1', becomes '2'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the only thing left is to ensure that the string conversion correctly captures the first character, even with leading minus signs or other characters.\n\nYes, the code should handle that.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as above."
