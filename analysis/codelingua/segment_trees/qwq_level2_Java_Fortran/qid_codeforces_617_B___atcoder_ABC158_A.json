So in Fortran, using a 64-bit integer is necessary. So in the code, we need to declare result1 as an 8-byte integer. So modifying the code: Change the declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: result1\n\nAlso, the variables involved in the product calculation must be of the same type. Wait, in the code, the differences between pos_list elements are integers (since pos_list is integer), so when multiplying, the result1 is of integer(kind=8). So the code should be adjusted:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count\n  integer(kind=8) :: result1\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), pos_list(:)\n  character(len=20) :: s\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  !",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst Java file (codeforces_617_B):\n\nThis program reads an integer n, then reads n integers. It collects the indices where the value is 1. If there are no 1s, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the product of the differences between consecutive indices and outputs that product.\n\nSecond Java file (atcoder_ABC158_A):\n\nThis one reads a string and checks if it contains both 'A' and 'B'. If yes, outputs \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the first's output is a number, which then becomes the input string for the second. Wait, but the second expects a string. Wait, no, the first program's output is a number (either 0 or the product), and that number is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the sequence. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. The first program's output is a number (either 0 or the product). The second program expects a string input. So the first program's output (a number) is the input to the second program, which is expecting a string. That would mean that the second program is reading that number as a string. For example, if the first outputs 123, then the second would read \"123\" as the string and check if it contains A and B. But since the number doesn't have A or B, the second would output \"No\".\n\nWait, but maybe the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program. The second program reads a string, so the input would be that number's string representation. So the second program's input is the string form of the first's output. So the second program's input is a string like \"0\" or \"123\", which would not contain A or B, so it would output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but maybe I need to make sure that the first program's output is correctly passed as the input to the second. So in the Fortran program, the first part (equivalent to the first Java program) must compute the result, then pass that result as the input to the second part (equivalent to the second Java program). But since it's a single Fortran program, I need to chain the processing without I/O in between.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read input from stdin (as per first Java program).\n2. Process first part (compute the product of differences between consecutive indices of 1s).\n3. Then, take that result (the number) and use it as the input for the second part (check if the string representation contains both 'A' and 'B').\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is a string. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program. So the second program's input is that number's string representation. So in the Fortran program, after computing the first result (let's call it result1), we need to convert it to a string, then process that string through the second part's logic.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n- Read the input (n and the array of integers) from stdin.\n- Compute the first result (the product or 0).\n- Convert that result to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n- Then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B' (but since it's a number, it won't, so the second part would output \"No\" unless the first's output is something like \"AB123\", which is impossible here). Wait, but maybe the first program's output could be a string? Wait no, the first Java program outputs a number via System.out.println, which is a string representation of the number. So the second program's input is that string.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is read via in.next(), which reads the next token. So if the first program outputs, say, 123, then the second program's input is the string \"123\", so the check would be for 'A' and 'B' in \"123\", which would be \"No\".\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the first result (the product or 0), we need to convert that number to a string, then check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since numbers don't have letters, the second part will always output \"No\" unless the first's output is a string with those letters, which it can't be. But perhaps the first program's output could be a string like \"AB\" if the product is 65 and 66? No, because the first program outputs a number, so the string would be \"6566\" or something else. Wait, no, the first program's output is a number, so the string is its decimal representation. So the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nBut regardless, the Fortran program must perform exactly the same steps as the original Java sequence. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and the array of integers (from stdin).\n2. Process the first part to get the first result (product or 0).\n3. Convert that result to a string (since that's the input to the second part).\n4. Check if that string contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n5. Output the result of the second part (Yes/No).\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part:\n\nThe first part's logic:\n\n- Read n, then read n integers. Collect indices (0-based?) where the value is 1. Wait, in Java, the code uses for (int i=0; i <n; i++) if (input.nextInt() ==1) arr.add(i). So the indices are 0-based. So in Fortran, which uses 1-based indices, need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, the first element is index 0. So in Fortran, when reading the array, the first element is index 1, but when storing the positions where the value is 1, we need to track the 0-based index. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in Java, for n elements, the loop runs from i=0 to i =n-1. So the first element is i=0, second i=1, etc. So in Fortran, when reading the array as an array starting at 1, the actual index (as per Java) would be (fortran_index -1). So when storing the positions, we need to store (fortran_index -1) for each element where the value is 1.\n\nWait, the code in Java adds the index (i) to the list when the value is 1. So in Fortran, for each element in the array (starting at 1), if the value is 1, then the Java index is (fortran_index -1). So the list arr in Java is the list of 0-based indices where the value is 1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can read the array as an array starting at 1, then loop through each element, and collect the (index-1) for each element equal to 1.\n\nOnce we have the list of positions (as integers), then if the list is empty, output 0. Else compute the product of the differences between consecutive elements.\n\nWait, the product is between consecutive elements. For example, if the list is [a, b, c], then the product is (b -a) * (c -b). So for i from 1 to size-1, multiply (arr(i+1) - arr(i)).\n\nWait, in Java, the code loops from i=1 to arr.size()-1, but in the code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) result *= arr.get(i) - arr.get(i-1);\n\nYes, so in Fortran, if the array is stored as an array of integers (say, pos_list), then the product is the product of pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1) for i from 2 to size.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So if the list has m elements, then the loop would be from 2 to m, and multiply (pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1)).\n\nSo first part's steps in Fortran:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into an array (say, arr(1:n)).\n\nInitialize a list (array) to hold the positions where arr(i) is 1. Let's say pos_list is an array of size n (since in the worst case, all elements are 1, so n elements). But we can track the count as we go.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to n:\n\n   if arr(i) ==1 then:\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      pos_list(count) = i-1 (since Java uses 0-based index)\n\nSo after this, if count is 0, then first result is 0.\n\nElse, compute the product:\n\nresult1 = 1\n\nloop from i=2 to count:\n\n   result1 = result1 * (pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1))\n\nThen, the first part's output is result1.\n\nNow, the second part's input is the string representation of result1.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to convert result1 to a string. Let's say we have a character variable s that holds the string of result1.\n\nThen, check if s contains both 'A' and 'B'. Since the number is an integer, the string will only have digits, so the answer will be \"No\".\n\nWait, but in Fortran, converting an integer to a string can be done via write statement into a character variable.\n\nSo steps for second part:\n\nConvert result1 to a string s.\n\nCheck if s contains both 'A' and 'B'.\n\nIf yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nRead n, then read n integers.\n\nThen process first part as above.\n\nThen process second part.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nWe need to read from stdin, process, then output the final result.\n\nVariables needed:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\ninteger :: count, i, result1\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: pos_list\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nlogical :: hasA, hasB\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, read n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nread(*,*) arr(1:n)\n\nThen, count the number of 1s and collect their positions (0-based):\n\ncount =0\n\nallocate(pos_list(n)) ! maximum possible size\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if (arr(i) ==1) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      pos_list(count) = i-1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (count ==0) then\n\n   result1 =0\n\nelse\n\n   result1 =1\n\n   do i=2, count\n\n      result1 = result1 * (pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1))\n\n   end do\n\nend if\n\nThen, convert result1 to a string s.\n\nWe can use an internal write statement:\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') result1\n\nThen check for 'A' and 'B' in s.\n\nhasA = .false.\n\nhasB = .false.\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (hasA .and. hasB) then\n\n   write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n\nelse\n\n   write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the string s, the characters are digits, so 'A' and 'B' won't be present. So the output will always be 'No' unless the first result is something like 65 (ASCII for 'A') but that's not the case here. But the code must do exactly what the Java does.\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the input is a string. The first program's output is a number, so the second program's input is the string representation of that number. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, handling the pos_list array. Since the maximum count is n, but we can allocate pos_list as size n. However, in Fortran, we can also use a dynamic array. Alternatively, since in the first part, after counting, we can allocate pos_list(count), but that might complicate. Alternatively, since the maximum possible count is n, we can allocate pos_list(n) and then only use the first count elements.\n\nThe code above does that.\n\nNow, the code for the second part:\n\nThe loop over each character in s. Wait, but in Fortran, the string s is of length 20, but the actual length is len_trim(s). So the loop should go from 1 to len_trim(s).\n\nWait, in the code above, the loop is from 1 to len_trim(s). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code I wrote earlier, the loop is written as:\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n\n      hasA = .true.\n\n   else if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n\n      hasB = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting all together in a Fortran program.\n\nBut also, need to make sure that the pos_list is properly allocated. Since in the code above, we first allocate pos_list(n), but then only use up to count elements. That's okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you allocate an array, you can't reallocate it. So the code as written is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after reading n, we can allocate pos_list as size n. Since the maximum possible count is n (if all elements are 1), so that's okay.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count, result1\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), pos_list(:)\n  character(len=20) :: s\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  read(*,*) arr(1:n)\n\n  ! Process first part\n  count = 0\n  allocate(pos_list(n))  ! Allocate maximum possible size\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (arr(i) == 1) then\n        count = count + 1\n        pos_list(count) = i - 1  ! 0-based index\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  if (count == 0) then\n     result1 = 0\n  else\n     result1 = 1\n     do i = 2, count\n        result1 = result1 * (pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1))\n     end do\n  end if\n\n  ! Convert result1 to string\n  write(s, '(I0)') result1\n\n  ! Check for 'A' and 'B' in the string\n  hasA = .false.\n  hasB = .false.\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n     if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n        hasA = .true.\n     else if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n        hasB = .true.\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result of the second part\n  if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n     write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n  else\n     write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(arr, pos_list)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you write to a character variable using a format like '(I0)', the value is written as a string without leading spaces. The 'I0' format writes the integer in the smallest possible field.\n\nBut the code should handle that correctly.\n\nWait, but in the second part, the string s is the string representation of the first result. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, check for possible issues:\n\n- The pos_list is allocated as size n, but if count is less than n, that's okay because we only use up to count elements.\n\n- The loop for checking 'A' and 'B' is correct.\n\n- The output is only done at the end, as required.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nTest case 1: No 1s in the array. Then first result is 0. The string is \"0\". So no A or B \u2192 output \"No\".\n\nTest case 2: One 1. Then the product is 1 (since there's only one element, so the loop doesn't run, result1 remains 1? Wait, no. Wait, in the code, if count is 1, then the else block:\n\nresult1 =1\n\nthen the loop is from 2 to count (which is 1). So the loop doesn't execute. So result1 is 1. So the string is \"1\", so output \"No\".\n\nAnother test case: two 1s at indices 0 and 2 (Java indices). So in Fortran, their positions would be 0 and 2 (since i-1 for i=1 and i=3). The difference is 2, so product is 2. The string is \"2\" \u2192 \"No\".\n\nAnother case where the first program outputs a string with A and B? Not possible, since it's a number. So the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nWait, but what if the first program's output is a negative number? Like if the product is negative? Wait, in the first Java code, the product is of differences between indices. Since the indices are in increasing order (since they are stored in the list in the order they are found, which is left to right), each difference is positive. So the product is always positive. So the first result is non-negative. So the string is a non-negative integer, so no letters.\n\nTherefore, the second part will always output \"No\".\n\nHmm, but the code is correct as per the problem's requirement.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the first program's output is a very large number, but in Fortran, the product could overflow. But the problem's original Java code uses long for the result, so in Fortran, using integer might not be sufficient. Wait, in the Java code, the result is a long, which is 64 bits. In Fortran, the default integer might be 32 bits, which could overflow for large n. So perhaps we need to use a larger integer type.\n\nWait, the problem's first Java code uses a long for the result. So in Fortran, to avoid overflow, we should use an integer*8 (or selected_int_kind(18)), but in standard Fortran, perhaps using integer(8) or kind=8.\n\nSo in the code, variables like result1 should be of a larger integer type.\n\nAh, right! That's an important point. The product could be very large. For example, if there are many 1s spaced far apart, the product could be huge. So in Fortran, using a 64-bit integer is necessary.\n\nSo in the code, we need to declare result1 as an 8-byte integer.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nChange the declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: result1\n\nAlso, the variables involved in the product calculation must be of the same type.\n\nWait, in the code, the differences between pos_list elements are integers (since pos_list is integer), so when multiplying, the result1 is of integer(kind=8).\n\nSo the code should be adjusted:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, count\n  integer(kind=8) :: result1\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), pos_list(:)\n  character(len=20) :: s\n  logical :: hasA, hasB\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  read(*,*) arr(1:n)\n\n  ! Process first part\n  count = 0\n  allocate(pos_list(n))  ! Allocate maximum possible size\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (arr(i) == 1) then\n        count = count + 1\n        pos_list(count) = i - 1  ! 0-based index\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  if (count == 0) then\n     result1 = 0\n  else\n     result1 = 1\n     do i = 2, count\n        result1 = result1 * (pos_list(i) - pos_list(i-1))\n     end do\n  end if\n\n  ! Convert result1 to string\n  write(s, '(I0)') result1\n\n  ! Check for 'A' and 'B' in the string\n  hasA = .false.\n  hasB = .false.\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n     if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n        hasA = .true.\n     else if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n        hasB = .true.\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result of the second part\n  if (hasA .and. hasB) then\n     write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n  else\n     write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(arr, pos_list)\n\nend program main\n\nThis way, result1 is 64-bit, which matches the Java's long.\n\nAnother possible issue: the string conversion. The write statement for s may not handle very large numbers correctly. For example, if the result1 is a very large number, the string length may exceed 20. The current s is length 20, but if the number is longer, the write statement may truncate it. However, in the second Java program, the input is read as a single token, so the entire output of the first program is read as the string. So in Fortran, the string must be long enough to hold the entire number.\n\nSo perhaps we should use a larger character length for s, like 100.\n\nChanging:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\n\nThen the write statement will still work, as the I0 format writes the entire number.\n\nYes, better to use a larger length to avoid truncation.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\n\nNow, the code should handle large numbers.\n\nAnother point: in the first part, the product could be zero if any of the differences is zero. Wait, but the indices are in increasing order, so the differences are positive. So the product can't be zero unless there are duplicate indices, but since the list is built in order, the indices are strictly increasing. So the product can't be zero unless count is zero (handled by the first condition). So the first part's result is either 0 (if no 1s) or a positive integer.\n\nThus, the code should be correct now.\n\nSo the final Fortran program is as above with these changes."
