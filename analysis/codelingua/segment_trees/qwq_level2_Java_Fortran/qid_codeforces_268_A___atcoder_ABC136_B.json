    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_268_A) reads an integer n, then reads n pairs of integers h[i] and g[i]. It then counts how many times a h value equals a g value. The result is printed.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC136_B) takes an integer N, counts the number of digits, and calculates some sum based on the digits. The output is the sum ans.\n\nThe key is to chain them: the output of the first becomes the input of the second. But in Fortran, I need to do this without I/O in between. So the first program's output (the result) is the input to the second. So the Fortran program must first process the first part, then use that result as N for the second part, then output the final answer.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's input is n followed by 2n integers. The second program's input is a single integer N. So the first program's output is the result (the count), which is the N for the second program. So the Fortran program must read the input for the first part, compute the count, then use that count as N in the second part's calculation, then output the final answer.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read n, then read n pairs of h and g arrays.\n2. Compute the count of h[i] == g[j] for all i,j.\n3. Use that count as N in the second part's algorithm.\n4. Compute the ans for the second part using N.\n5. Output the ans.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\nVariables: n, h array, g array. The count is the result.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. Let's see:\n\nRead n from input. Then read 2n integers into h and g. Wait, in Java, the first program reads h and g via nextInt() in a loop. So in Fortran, after reading n, we need to read 2n integers. So perhaps read them into h and g arrays. Let's see:\n\nSuppose n is read first. Then, for each i from 1 to n (Fortran uses 1-based indices?), but in Java it's 0-based. Wait, in Java, the arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based unless specified otherwise. Hmm, but for the problem, the indices don't matter as long as the counts are correct. So in Fortran, perhaps declare h(1:n) and g(1:n). But in Fortran, the array size must be known at compile time unless using allocatable arrays. Since n is read from input, we need to use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, but in Fortran 90+, we can have allocatable arrays. So the steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate h(n) and g(n).\n\nThen read the next 2n integers into h and g. Wait, but in Java, the code loops over each i, reads h[i], then g[i]. So in Fortran, the input is n followed by 2n numbers, each pair being h_i and g_i. So the input is like:\n\nn\n\nh1 g1 h2 g2 ... hn gn\n\nWait, no, the first Java program's input is n, then for each of the n lines, two integers? Or is it all on the same line?\n\nLooking at the first Java code:\n\nThe first line is sc.nextLine() for n, then the loop uses sc.nextInt() for h and g. So after n, the rest is space-separated, with 2n numbers. So the input is n followed by 2n numbers, all on the same line or multiple lines? The code uses nextInt() in a loop, so the input after n is 2n numbers, possibly on the same line or split across lines, but the code reads them all via nextInt().\n\nIn Fortran, to read them, perhaps read all the numbers into a temporary array, then split into h and g. Alternatively, read n, then read 2n numbers into a single array, then assign h and g.\n\nAlternatively, read n, then loop n times, each time reading two integers into h(i) and g(i). That's probably better.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead(n)\n\nThen do i = 1 to n:\n\n   read(*,*) h(i), g(i)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the read statement can read multiple variables. So that's manageable.\n\nThen compute the count: for all i and j, if h(i) == g(j), increment count.\n\nIn Fortran, this would be a double loop:\n\ncount = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) == g(j)) then\n\n         count = count + 1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, the count is the N for the second part.\n\nNow the second part's algorithm.\n\nThe second Java program takes N (the count from first part) and calculates ans based on the number of digits in N.\n\nFirst, count the number of digits in N. The Java code does this by dividing by 10 until it's zero, counting steps.\n\nIn Fortran, same approach: temp = N, count =0, loop while temp>0, divide by 10, increment count.\n\nOnce count is the number of digits, then loop from 1 to count (digits), and accumulate ans.\n\nThe Java code's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {\n\n   if (i == count) {\n\n      if (i%2 ==1) ans += (N - Math.pow(10, i-1)+1);\n\n   } else {\n\n      if (i ==1) ans +=9;\n\n      else if (i%2 ==1) ans += (10^i -10^(i-1));\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, let me parse this.\n\nThe loop is over i from 1 to the number of digits (count). For each i:\n\nIf i is the last digit (i == count):\n\n   if i is odd, then add (N - 10^{i-1} +1) to ans.\n\nElse (i is not the last digit):\n\n   if i is 1: add 9 (since 1-digit numbers with odd digits: 1 digit is odd, so numbers 1-9, but how? Wait, the problem here is the second Java program's logic. Let me think.\n\nWait, the second program's purpose is to count the number of integers from 1 to N that have an odd number of digits. Wait, maybe the problem is different. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit complex. Let me re-express it.\n\nThe code's ans is the sum of numbers with an odd number of digits up to N.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to count how many numbers from 1 to N have an odd number of digits. The code's approach is to compute this by considering each digit length.\n\nThe approach is:\n\nFor each digit length i (from 1 to total digits of N):\n\n   if i is less than the total digits:\n\n      if i is odd, add the count of numbers with exactly i digits. Because all numbers with exactly i digits have an odd digit count (since i is odd).\n\n      if i is even, add 0.\n\n   else (i is the total digits):\n\n      if i is odd, add the count of numbers from 10^{i-1} up to N (since those have exactly i digits, which is odd).\n\n      else, add 0.\n\nWait, the code's logic seems to be:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to count (number of digits in N):\n\n   if i is the last digit (count):\n\n      if i is odd, then add (N - 10^{i-1} +1). Because numbers from 10^{i-1} to N have exactly i digits, and since i is odd, they contribute.\n\n   else:\n\n      if i is 1: add 9 (numbers 1-9, which have 1 digit, odd).\n\n      else if i is odd: add (10^i - 10^{i-1}), which is the count of numbers with exactly i digits (since 10^{i-1} to 10^i -1).\n\n      else: do nothing (since even digits don't contribute).\n\nWait, the code's code:\n\nIn the else part (i not equal to count):\n\n   if (i ==1) ans +=9;\n\n   else if (i%2 ==1) ans += (Math.pow(10,i) - Math.pow(10,i-1));\n\nSo for i < count:\n\n   if i is odd, add the number of numbers with exactly i digits (which is 9*10^{i-1} = 10^i -10^{i-1}).\n\n   if i is even, add nothing.\n\nSo the code is correct for the problem of counting numbers up to N with an odd number of digits.\n\nSo in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nGiven N (the count from first part), compute the number of digits (count_digits).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to count_digits:\n\n   if i == count_digits:\n\n      if i is odd:\n\n          ans += (N - 10^(i-1) +1)\n\n   else:\n\n      if i ==1:\n\n          ans +=9\n\n      else if mod(i,2) ==1:\n\n          ans += (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\nSo translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, compute count_digits:\n\ntemp = N\n\ncount_digits =0\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, ans =0\n\ndo i=1, count_digits\n\n   if (i == count_digits) then\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is done with ** operator. So 10**i is okay.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n, then read n pairs of h and g.\n\n2. Compute count (the result from first Java program).\n\n3. Use count as N in the second part's algorithm.\n\n4. Output the ans.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, count, N, ans, count_digits, temp, i, j\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: h, g\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(h(n), g(n))\n\nThen read the h and g arrays:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   read(*,*) h(i), g(i)\n\nend do\n\nCompute count:\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if (h(i) == g(j)) then\n\n         count = count +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThen, set N = count.\n\nThen compute count_digits:\n\ntemp = N\n\ncount_digits =0\n\ndo while (temp >0)\n\n   count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nend do\n\nThen compute ans:\n\nans =0\n\ndo i=1, count_digits\n\n   if (i == count_digits) then\n\n      if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      if (i ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans +9\n\n      else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n         ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the output is write(*,*) ans.\n\nPutting all together in code.\n\nBut need to make sure that all variables are declared properly.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the exponentiation operator is **, and 10**i is okay. However, for large exponents, but since N is up to n^2 (since count can be n^2), but in the second part, the maximum N is n^2, which for n up to, say, 1e5 would be 1e10, but in the code, the exponents would be up to the number of digits, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can have overflow. For example, if N is very large, but the problem's constraints may not require handling that. Since the original Java code uses int, which is 32-bit, so N can be up to 2^31-1. But in Fortran, if using default integers (4 bytes), same as Java's int. So need to ensure that variables are of sufficient size. But perhaps the problem expects that the code works within the constraints of the original Java code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is such that the count (N) is within 32-bit integer. So using integer variables should be okay.\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, count, N, ans, count_digits, temp, i, j\n\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: h, g\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  allocate(h(n), g(n))\n\n  do i =1, n\n\n     read(*,*) h(i), g(i)\n\n  end do\n\n  count =0\n\n  do i=1, n\n\n     do j=1, n\n\n        if (h(i) == g(j)) then\n\n           count = count +1\n\n        end if\n\n     end do\n\n  end do\n\n  N = count\n\n  temp = N\n\n  count_digits =0\n\n  do while (temp >0)\n\n     count_digits = count_digits +1\n\n     temp = temp /10\n\n  end do\n\n  ans =0\n\n  do i=1, count_digits\n\n     if (i == count_digits) then\n\n        if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n           ans = ans + (N - 10**(i-1) +1)\n\n        end if\n\n     else\n\n        if (i ==1) then\n\n           ans = ans +9\n\n        else if (mod(i,2) ==1) then\n\n           ans = ans + (10**i - 10**(i-1))\n\n        end if\n\n     end if\n\n  end do\n\n  write(*,*) ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's loop, when i is less than count_digits and even, we do nothing. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: Let's say first program's output is N=0. Then in the second part, count_digits would be 1 (since 0 has 1 digit?), but wait, 0 is a special case. Wait, in the second Java code, when N is 0, but the problem probably expects N to be positive. Because in the first Java code, the count can be zero (if no h[i] equals any g[j]). But the second Java code's code would have N=0, then temp =0, so count_digits would be 0? Let's see:\n\nIn the code for count_digits:\n\ntemp = N (0)\n\ncount_digits starts at 0.\n\nThe loop runs while temp>0. Since temp is 0, the loop doesn't run. So count_digits remains 0. Then the loop from 1 to 0 would not execute, so ans remains 0. Which is correct, since numbers from 1 to 0 (none) would have 0 count. But the problem's second code's logic may have different handling for N=0. However, according to the first Java code, the count can be zero, so the second part must handle N=0. But in the second Java code, when N is 0, the code would have count_digits=0, so the loop from 1 to 0 doesn't run, so ans is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say first program's output is N=5 (count=5). Then the second part's code:\n\ncount_digits for 5 is 1.\n\nLoop i=1 to 1:\n\ni=1 == count_digits (1). Since 1 is odd, add (5 -10^0 +1) =5-1+1=5. So ans=5. Which is correct because numbers 1-5 all have 1 digit (odd), so 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: N=100.\n\nDigits: 3.\n\nLoop i from 1 to 3.\n\ni=1 (not last):\n\ni=1 is odd, so add 9 (since i=1).\n\ni=2 (not last):\n\neven, so nothing.\n\ni=3 (last):\n\ni is odd. So add (100 - 100 (10^2) +1? Wait 10^(3-1) is 100. So 100 -100 +1 =1. So total ans is 9 (from i=1) plus (10^2 -10^1) for i=2? Wait no, wait for i=2, which is not the last digit (since count_digits is 3). Wait, i=2 is less than 3, so for i=2, since it's even, nothing added. So for i=1: 9, i=2: nothing, i=3 (last, odd): 100 -100 +1 =1. So total ans is 9 +1 =10.\n\nWait, but numbers from 1 to 100:\n\nNumbers with 1 digit (1-9): 9 numbers (odd digits).\n\nNumbers with 3 digits: 100 (only 100, which has 3 digits, so contributes 1. So total 9+1=10. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N=99.\n\nDigits: 2.\n\ncount_digits=2.\n\nLoop i=1 and 2.\n\ni=1 (not last):\n\ni=1 is odd, add 9.\n\ni=2 (last, even):\n\nsince i is even, no addition. So total ans is 9.\n\nBut numbers up to 99 with odd digits: 1-digit (9) and 2-digit (even digits, so no). So total 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: N= 105.\n\nDigits: 3.\n\ni=1: add 9.\n\ni=2: even, nothing.\n\ni=3 (last, odd):\n\nadd (105 - 100 +1) =6. So total 9+6=15.\n\nNumbers with 1 digit:9, 3 digits: 100-105 (6 numbers). Total 15. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the code should be written as above. Let me check for any possible issues.\n\nWait, in the first part, the loops for i and j are from 1 to n. Since in Java, the arrays are 0-based, but in Fortran, they are 1-based. So the loops are correct.\n\nAlso, in the second part, the code uses N = count, which is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the second part, when calculating 10^(i-1), in Fortran, 10** (i-1) is okay. But for i=1, 10^0 is 1, so 10^(i-1) is 1. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the ** operator has higher precedence than -, so 10**i - 10**(i-1) is okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work."
