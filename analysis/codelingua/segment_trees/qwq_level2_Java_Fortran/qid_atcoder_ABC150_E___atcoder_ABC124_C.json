Testing with an example:\n\nSuppose n=2. Then the array c has two elements, sorted. The loop runs i from 2 to 3 (since n+1=3). For i=2:\n\nn+2 -i = 2+2-2 = 2 \u2192 c(2). i=3: n+2 -3 = 2+2-3 =1 \u2192 c(1). So the terms are c(2) and c(1), which are the two elements in sorted order (since sorted in ascending order, c(1) is smaller than c(2). So the loop is taking the elements in reverse order (c(2), c(1)), multiplied by a*i (a is 2^(n-2) = 2^0 =1 when n=2). So the ans would be a*2 * c(2) + a*3 * c(1). Then multiplied by b=2^2=4. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor n=2:\n\na = 2^(0) =1.\n\nb=4.\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni=2:\n\nval = 1*2 mod mod_val \u2192 2.\n\nval *= c(2) \u2192 2*c(2).\n\nans += that \u2192 2*c(2). i=3:\n\nval =1*3 mod mod_val \u21923. val *= c(1) \u21923*c(1).\n\nans += that \u2192 2c2 +3c1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the original sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they interact.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, atcoder_ABC150_E. It reads input: first an integer n, then an array of n integers. Then it does some calculations involving sorting the array, computing powers of 2 modulo 1e9+7, and calculating an answer based on those values. The output is the final answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThe second Java file, atcoder_ABC124_C, reads a string and processes it to find the minimum number of changes needed to make consecutive characters different, either by changing forward or backward. It outputs the minimum of two counts.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output of each program is the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second? Or maybe the first program's output is the input to the second? Wait, the user says the programs are executed in sequence, so the first's output is the input to the second. But looking at the code, the first program's output is a number, and the second program expects a string. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program's output is a number (the answer), and the second program expects a string (the input is a string). That would mean that the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string. That's possible only if the first program's output is a string, but in the first Java code, the output is a number. Wait, the first program's output is a number, so the second program would read that number as a string? Like, if the first program outputs \"123\", then the second program would read \"123\" as the input string. So the second program's input is the first's output. So the second program's input is a string which is the first's output. So the second program's input is the first's output, which is a number. So the second program's input is a string representation of that number. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is: first program reads input, computes a number, outputs it. Second program reads that number as a string, processes it, and outputs the minimum changes. The final Fortran program must read the original input (for the first Java program), process both steps internally, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nWait, but the user says \"the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior\". So the Fortran program must read the input that the first Java program would have read, then process both steps (the first's computation and the second's computation), and output the final result of the second program. So the first Java program's output is the input to the second, but in the Fortran program, we need to compute both steps without I/O in between.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and array c).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number).\n\n3. Use that number as the input to the second program (i.e., treat it as a string, then process it as per the second program's logic).\n\n4. Output the second program's result.\n\nSo the Fortran program must do all that in one go.\n\nNow, let's look at each Java program's logic in detail.\n\nFirst program (ABC150_E):\n\n- Reads n, then n integers into array c.\n\n- Sorts the array.\n\n- Computes some mathematical formula involving exponents and mod 1e9+7.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- Sorting the array.\n\n- Calculating a = 2^(n-2) mod mod.\n\n- b = 2^n mod mod.\n\n- Then, for i from 2 to n+1, accumulate ans += a * i * c[n+1 -i], mod mod.\n\nWait, let me recheck the code:\n\nThe loop is for i from 2 to n+1 inclusive. For each i, val is a * i mod mod, multiplied by c[n+1 -i], then mod mod. Then ans += val mod mod.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n + 1; i++) {\n\n    long val = a * i % mod;\n\n    val *= c[n + 1 - i];\n\n    val %= mod;\n\n    ans += val;\n\n    ans %= mod;\n\n}\n\nWait, the index n+1 -i. Let's see when i=2, the index is n+1 -2 = n-1. So the first term is c[n-1], which is the last element of the sorted array (since it's sorted in ascending order, but the code uses parallelSort, which is ascending). Wait, but in Java, Arrays.parallelSort sorts in natural order, so ascending. So the array is sorted in increasing order. So the largest element is at the end. So when i runs from 2 to n+1, the indices n+1 -i go from n-1 down to 0. So the loop is effectively taking the elements from the end to the start, multiplying each by a*i, where i starts at 2 and goes up to n+1. Hmm, perhaps the formula is designed to accumulate terms based on the sorted array's elements in reverse order.\n\nThe final ans is multiplied by b (2^n mod mod), then mod mod again.\n\nThe power function is a standard exponentiation by squaring mod 1e9+7.\n\nSecond program (ABC124_C):\n\nThe input is a string x. The program calculates two counts:\n\n- a1: the number of changes needed if we process the string from left to right, changing each character to be different from the previous.\n\n- a2: the number of changes needed if we process from right to left, changing each character to be different from the next.\n\nWait, the code for a1 is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        flip the character (to '0' or '1'), increment a1.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo a1 is the number of changes when processing from left to right, ensuring each character is different from the previous.\n\nSimilarly, a2 is processing from the end backwards, changing the previous character if they are the same. Wait, the code for a2 is:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        flip the previous character (i-1) to the opposite, increment a2.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in the a2 loop, they are modifying the previous character (i-1) if current and previous are same. So when moving backward, they check the pair (i-1, i), and if same, they change the left one (i-1) to be different. So the process is similar but in reverse direction.\n\nThe output is the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nSo the second program's input is a string, and the output is the minimum between the two counts.\n\nNow, the first program's output is a number, which is the input to the second program. So the second program's input is the string representation of the first program's output. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's input is \"123\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (n and array c).\n\n2. Compute the first program's result (the number).\n\n3. Convert that number to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program, which uses System.out.println, so it's in decimal without any leading zeros? Well, the first program's output is ans * b mod mod, which is a number, so when printed, it's the decimal representation of that number.\n\n4. Then process that string through the second program's logic (the string is the input x for the second program).\n\n5. Output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement all of this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read n and the array c.\n\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n\n- Compute a = 2^(n-2) mod 1e9+7.\n\n- Compute b = 2^n mod 1e9+7.\n\n- Compute ans as per the loop.\n\n- Multiply ans by b mod mod, then mod again to get the first program's output.\n\n- Convert this number to a string (as it would be printed by the first Java program, which is just the number as a string).\n\n- Then process this string through the second program's logic.\n\n- Output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, let's think about each part in Fortran.\n\nFirst, handling the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nFortran has arrays, but we need to sort them. The array c is of size n. We can use the Mergesort or another method. Alternatively, use the intrinsic function, but I think in Fortran 90+, we can use the sort function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to sort an array, you can use the 'sort' intrinsic. For example:\n\ncall merge_sort(c)\n\nBut I need to check if that's available. Alternatively, use a loop to sort. Alternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Hmm, perhaps better to implement a simple sort here.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in function. Let me see: in Fortran, the 'sort' function is part of the intrinsic functions. Wait, actually, the standard way is to use the 'sort' subroutine from the ISO_C_BINDING or similar? Wait, perhaps I need to use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Let me recall: in Fortran 90, you can use the 'sort' function via the 'ieee' module? No, perhaps the best way is to use the 'merge_sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Alternatively, use a simple bubble sort for small n. Since the problem's constraints for the first program's n may be up to some limit (but the problem doesn't specify, but in programming contests, n can be up to 1e5 or so, but in the code, the first program uses parallelSort, which is for large arrays. However, in Fortran, for large arrays, we need an efficient sort. Hmm, perhaps better to use the built-in sort function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the 'sort' function is available via the 'ieee' module? Or perhaps the 'sort' is part of the intrinsic functions. Let me check.\n\nActually, in Fortran, the standard way to sort an array is to use the 'sort' intrinsic function. For example:\n\ncall sort(c)\n\nBut I need to confirm. Wait, according to Fortran 2003, there is an intrinsic function called 'sort', but I might be mixing with other languages. Alternatively, perhaps the 'sort' is part of the ISO_C_BINDING? Hmm, perhaps I need to use a module. Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to use the 'merge_sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Alternatively, use a simple sorting algorithm here. Since the problem's first program uses parallelSort, which is for large arrays, but in Fortran, perhaps the code can use a quicksort or mergesort. Alternatively, use the built-in sort function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic procedures. Let me look up: in Fortran, the 'sort' function is available as an intrinsic function. Wait, according to the documentation, the 'sort' function is part of the Fortran 2003 standard. The syntax is:\n\ncall sort(array [, dim, mask, order])\n\nSo for a 1D array, it's straightforward. So for the array c, we can do:\n\ncall sort(c)\n\nThat would sort the array in ascending order. So that's good.\n\nNext, the power function. The first program's power function is a recursive exponentiation by squaring mod 1e9+7. In Fortran, recursion may not be the best approach for large exponents, but given that n can be up to whatever (but in programming contests, n is manageable). Alternatively, implement it iteratively.\n\nWait, the power function in Java is:\n\nstatic long power(long x, long n) {\n\n    if (n ==0 return 1.\n\n    mod is 1e9+7.\n\n    val = power(x, n/2)\n\n    val = val * val mod mod.\n\n    if n is odd, multiply by x mod mod.\n\n    return val.\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, since recursion can be a problem for large n (but in programming contests, n is manageable, but better to use iterative approach to avoid stack issues).\n\nAlternatively, implement it iteratively.\n\nLet me think of the iterative version:\n\nfunction pow_mod(x, n) result(res)\n\ninteger(8) :: res, x, n\n\ninteger(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\ninteger(8) :: result = 1\n\ninteger(8) :: base = mod(x, mod_val)\n\ndo while (n >0)\n\n    if (mod(n,2) ==1) then\n\n        result = mod(result * base, mod_val)\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod(base * base, mod_val)\n\n    n = n /2\n\nend do\n\nres = result\n\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes (64-bit), so using integer(8) is okay. But need to make sure that the variables are of sufficient size.\n\nAlternatively, use the kind parameter for integers. Let me think of using integer*8 (but in Fortran, it's better to use selected_int_kind).\n\nAlternatively, in the code, define mod_val as 1000000007, and use integers of kind 8.\n\nSo, the power function can be written as an iterative function.\n\nNow, the first program's steps:\n\nRead n, then read n integers into array c.\n\nSort c.\n\nCompute a = 2^(n-2) mod mod_val.\n\nCompute b = 2^n mod mod_val.\n\nCompute ans as per the loop.\n\nWait, the loop in the first Java program:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i <= n +1; i++) {\n\n    val = a * i % mod;\n\n    val *= c[n+1 -i];\n\n    val %= mod;\n\n    ans += val;\n\n    ans %= mod;\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop runs from i=2 to i = n+1. Let's see for n=3, the loop runs i=2,3,4.\n\nWait, n+1 is 4, so i goes up to 4. The index n+1 -i would be 3+1 -2 = 2 (when i=2), then 3+1-3=1 (i=3), then 3+1-4=0 (i=4). Wait, but array indices in Fortran start at 1, so if the array is 1-based, then for n=3, the indices would be 1,2,3. So when i=4, n+1 -i = 0, which is invalid. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in Java, arrays are 0-based. So in the first Java code, c is an array of size n, with indices 0 to n-1. So when n=3, the indices are 0,1,2. The loop for i from 2 to n+1 (which is 4 when n=3). So for i=4, n+1 -i = 3+1 -4 = 0, which is valid (the first element). Wait, but in Java, the array is 0-based, so c[n+1 -i] when i=4 would be c[0], which is okay.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, unless declared otherwise. So when translating, the array c in Fortran would be 1-based. So we need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the array c is 0-based. So in Fortran, if we have an array c(1:n), then the equivalent of c[i] in Java is c(i+1) in Fortran? No, no. Wait, in Java, for i from 0 to n-1, the elements are c[0], c[1], ..., c[n-1]. In Fortran, if the array is declared as c(1:n), then the elements are c(1) to c(n). So to map Java's c[i] to Fortran's c(i+1) would be wrong. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say in Java, the array has elements c[0], c[1], ..., c[n-1]. In Fortran, if we have an array c(1:n), then the first element is c(1), which corresponds to Java's c[0]. So to map Java's index i to Fortran's index i+1? No, that would be wrong. Wait, no. To map Java's index i (0-based) to Fortran's index (1-based), it's i+1. So Java's c[i] is Fortran's c(i+1). Therefore, in the loop in the first Java code, the term c[n+1 -i] (Java's 0-based) would be in Fortran's array as c( (n+1 -i) +1 )? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's c has indices 0 to n-1. The term n+1 -i in Java is the index. So in Fortran, the equivalent index would be (n+1 -i) +1? Wait, no. Let me think of an example. Let's say n=3, i=2 (Java's loop starts at i=2). Then n+1 -i = 3+1 -2 = 2. So in Java, that's c[2], which is the third element (since 0-based). In Fortran's array c(1:3), that would be c(3). So the Fortran index is (n+1 -i) +1? Wait, no. Wait, n+1 -i is 2, so in Java's array, that's the third element (since 0-based). In Fortran's array, the third element is c(3). So the index in Fortran is (n+1 -i) +1? Wait, no. Wait, n+1 -i is the Java index. To get the Fortran index, add 1. So (n+1 -i) +1 = n+2 -i. Wait, but in the example, n=3, i=2, that gives 3+2 -2 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the Fortran index is (n+1 -i) +1? Wait, no, the Java index is (n+1 -i), so the Fortran index is (n+1 -i) +1? Wait, no, the Java index is (n+1 -i), so the Fortran index is (Java index) +1. So yes, (n+1 -i) +1 = n+2 -i.\n\nWait, but in the loop, the Java code's loop runs i from 2 to n+1. Let's see when i = n+1, then the Java index is n+1 - (n+1) = 0, which is valid (the first element). In Fortran, that would be 0 +1 =1, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the term c[n+1 -i] in Java is c( (n+1 -i) +1 ) = c(n+2 -i).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the index is (Java index) +1. So yes, the Fortran index is (Java index) +1. So the term in Fortran would be c( (n+1 -i) +1 ) = c(n+2 -i).\n\nTherefore, in the loop, for each i from 2 to n+1 (inclusive), the term is c(n+2 -i).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop variable i can be from 2 to n+1, same as in Java. So the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 2, n+1\n\n    val = a * i mod mod_val\n\n    val = val * c(n+2 -i) mod mod_val\n\n    ans = ans + val\n\n    ans = mod(ans, mod_val)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the val is first a*i mod mod, then multiplied by c[...], then mod again. So in Fortran, the order is important. Let me see:\n\nval = (a * i) mod mod_val\n\nthen val = (val * c(...)) mod mod_val\n\nthen add to ans, mod again.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nval = mod(a * i, mod_val)\n\nval = mod(val * c(n+2 -i), mod_val)\n\nans = mod(ans + val, mod_val)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function can be used as mod(a*b, mod_val). So that's okay.\n\nNow, after computing ans, multiply by b mod mod_val, then mod again.\n\nans = mod(ans * b, mod_val)\n\nWait, but in the Java code, ans is multiplied by b, then mod mod again.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part: taking the computed ans (the first program's output) and converting it to a string, then processing it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second program's input is a string x. The code reads the string, then processes it in two ways:\n\nFirst, a1 is the number of changes when processing from left to right, changing each character to be different from the previous.\n\nSecond, a2 is the number of changes when processing from right to left, changing the previous character to be different from the next.\n\nWait, in the second Java code's a2 loop:\n\nThey start with a copy of the original string (b), then iterate from the end backwards. For each i from the end down to 1 (since i starts at x.length()-1, which is the last index in Java, and goes down to 1 (since i>0). For each i, if the current character (i) and previous (i-1) are the same, they change the previous (i-1) to the opposite, and increment a2.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nfor (int i = x.length() -1; i>0; i--) {\n\n    if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        if (b.charAt(i-1) == '1') b.setCharAt(i-1, '0');\n\n        else b.setCharAt(i-1, '1');\n\n        a2++;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo when moving backward, whenever two adjacent characters are the same, the left one (i-1) is changed. So the process is to ensure that after processing, the characters are different. The count a2 is the number of changes made.\n\nThe output is the minimum between a1 and a2.\n\nSo, in the second part of the Fortran program, we need to take the first program's output (the number) as a string, then process it as per the above.\n\nFirst, converting the first program's result (ans) to a string. In Fortran, we can use write to a string.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\ninteger :: ans\n\nwrite(s, '(I0)') ans\n\ntrim(s) to remove leading spaces, but in Fortran, the write statement with '(I0)' should write the number without leading spaces. So s will hold the string representation of ans.\n\nThen, process this string s as the input x for the second program.\n\nNow, processing the string:\n\nFirst, compute a1:\n\nInitialize a1 to 0.\n\nLoop over each character from the second character (i=2 in Fortran, since strings are 1-based) to the end.\n\nAt each position i, check if current character is same as previous.\n\nIf so, change current character to the opposite (so that they are different), increment a1.\n\nWait, in the first part of the second Java code's a1 loop:\n\nfor (int i =1; i < x.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i-1)) {\n\n        flip the current character (i) to the opposite, then a1++.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, the loop starts at i=1 (since 0-based, so the second character). The code checks if current (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, flip the current character (i) to the opposite. So in Fortran, the loop would be from i=2 to len_trim(s):\n\ndo i = 2, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (s(i:i) == s(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        if (s(i:i) == '1') then\n\n            s(i:i) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            s(i:i) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a1 = a1 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in the second Java code, they make a copy of the original string (a and b are copies of x). So in Fortran, we need to make copies for a and b.\n\nWait, in the second Java code, they have two copies: a and b. The a is processed forward, and b is processed backward.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to create two copies of the string s: s_a and s_b.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nOriginal string is s (the output of first program).\n\nFor a1:\n\nMake a copy s_a = s.\n\nProcess s_a from left to right, changing current character when duplicates.\n\nFor a2:\n\nMake a copy s_b = s.\n\nProcess s_b from right to left, changing previous character when duplicates.\n\nWait, in the a2 processing:\n\nThe code loops from the end backward, and for each i (starting from the end), checks if current (i) and previous (i-1) are same. If so, change the previous (i-1) to the opposite, and increment a2.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize a2 to 0.\n\ns_b = s\n\ndo i = len_trim(s_b), 2, -1\n\n    if (s_b(i:i) == s_b(i-1:i-1)) then\n\n        if (s_b(i-1:i-1) == '1') then\n\n            s_b(i-1:i-1) = '0'\n\n        else\n\n            s_b(i-1:i-1) = '1'\n\n        end if\n\n        a2 = a2 +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, the loop starts at the end (len_trim(s_b)), and goes down to 2 (since i must be >=2 to have i-1 >=1).\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is for i from x.length()-1 down to 1 (since i>0). In Fortran, the length is len_trim(s), so the loop would be from i = len_trim(s) down to 2 (since i starts at the last index (len_trim(s)), and goes down to 2 (so i-1 is 1 when i=2). So the loop in Fortran is correct.\n\nNow, after processing both copies, the a1 and a2 are the counts, and the minimum is output.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read n and the array c.\n\n2. Sort c in ascending order.\n\n3. Compute a = 2^(n-2) mod mod_val.\n\n4. Compute b = 2^n mod mod_val.\n\n5. Compute ans as per the loop.\n\n6. Multiply ans by b mod mod_val.\n\n7. Convert ans to a string s.\n\n8. Process s to compute a1 and a2.\n\n9. Output the minimum of a1 and a2.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nmod_val = 1000000007\n\nWe can define this as a constant.\n\nThe array c is read as integers. Let's use integer(8) for the array elements, since the problem may have large numbers (but in the first Java code, the input is read as integers, but the mod is applied, so 32-bit may be enough, but to be safe, use 64-bit).\n\nWait, in the first Java code, the input is read as integers, but the problem may have numbers up to 1e9, so in Fortran, using integer(8) is better.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\n    integer :: n, i, a1, a2, ans, b, a\n\n    integer(8) :: temp_ans\n\n    integer, allocatable :: c(:)\n\n    character(len=20) :: s, s_a, s_b\n\n    !

But in the first part, when we compute a and b, n can be up to the maximum value where 2^(n) mod mod_val is manageable. Since mod_val is 1e9+7, which is about 1e9, so exponents up to say 1e5 are okay. But in Fortran, integers are typically 4 bytes (32 bits), so n can be up to 2^31-1, which is okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the pow_mod function is declared with x and n as integers. But in the first program's code, n can be up to whatever the input allows. But in the problem's context, the first Java program's n is read from input, so it's possible that n is up to 1e5 or so, which is within 32-bit integer.\n\nAnother issue: in the loop for computing ans, the variables a and b are computed as integers (since pow_mod returns an integer). But when multiplying a (integer) by i (integer), and then by c(n+2 -i) (integer), the product can be up to (1e9) * (n+1) * (1e9) which is way larger than 2^31, so we need to use 64-bit integers here.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The variables a and b are computed as integers (32-bit?), but when multiplied, they can overflow. So in the code above, the variables a and b should be 64-bit integers.\n\nWait, in the code above, the pow_mod function returns an integer, which is 4 bytes (if default is 32-bit). So when n is large, like 1e5, 2^1e5 mod mod_val is okay, but the intermediate steps in the pow_mod function can handle it because mod_val is applied each time.\n\nWait, the pow_mod function returns an integer (mod_val is 1e9+7, so the result is between 0 and mod_val-1, which is less than 2^30, so 32-bit is okay.\n\nBut in the loop for ans:\n\nval is computed as a * i mod mod_val. a is an integer (32-bit), i is integer (up to n+1, which could be up to say 1e5). So a*i can be up to (1e9) * 1e5 = 1e14, which is larger than 2^32 (which is ~4e9). So this would overflow a 32-bit integer. Hence, the variables a and b must be 64-bit integers.\n\nTherefore, the variables a and b should be declared as integer(8), and the pow_mod function should return integer(8).\n\nSo, need to adjust the code:\n\nFirst, in the pow_mod function, the parameters and return type should be integer(8).\n\nWait, let me rework the pow_mod function:\n\ninteger(8) function pow_mod(x, n) result(res)\n\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: x, n\n\n    integer(8) :: res, base, exponent\n\n    res = 1\n\n    base = mod(x, mod_val)\n\n    exponent = n\n\n    do while (exponent > 0)\n\n        if (mod(exponent,2) ==1) then\n\n            res = mod(res * base, mod_val)\n\n        end if\n\n        base = mod(base * base, mod_val)\n\n        exponent = exponent /2\n\n    end do\n\nend function\n\nWait, but mod_val is an integer, so when mod(x, mod_val) is done, but x is integer(8), mod_val is integer, so need to cast mod_val to integer(8). Or better, define mod_val as integer(8).\n\nWait, in the main program, mod_val is declared as integer, but in the pow_mod function, it's used as mod_val. To avoid type mismatches, better to make mod_val an integer(8).\n\nSo in the main program:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007_8\n\nThen, variables a and b are integer(8):\n\ninteger(8) :: a, b\n\nans is also an integer(8):\n\ninteger(8) :: ans\n\nWait, but in the code above, ans is declared as integer. That's a problem. So need to adjust all variables involved in the calculations to be 64-bit.\n\nLet me rework the code variables:\n\nIn the main program:\n\n    integer(8) :: a, b, ans, temp_ans\n\n    integer :: n, i, a1, a2\n\n    integer(8), allocatable :: c(:)\n\nWait, the array c must be integer(8) to hold the input values (since the problem may have numbers up to 1e9, which is within 32 bits, but to be safe, use 64-bit).\n\nWait, the first Java code reads the array as integers, which in Java are 32-bit. So in Fortran, using integer(4) would be sufficient, but to be safe, use integer(8).\n\nSo:\n\n    integer(8), allocatable :: c(:)\n\n    ...\n\n    read*, c  ! assuming the input is read as integers, but stored as 8-byte.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when reading integers, the kind doesn't matter for input, as long as the variable can hold the value.\n\nNow, the loop for ans:\n\nans is initialized to 0 (integer(8)).\n\ndo i = 2, n+1\n\n    integer(8) :: val\n\n    val = mod( a * i, mod_val )\n\n    val = mod( val * c(n+2 -i), mod_val )\n\n    ans = mod( ans + val, mod_val )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function returns a value with the same sign as the modulus. But since all terms are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the variables a and b are computed as pow_mod(2, n-2) and pow_mod(2, n). Since pow_mod returns integer(8), that's okay.\n\nNow, the temp_ans is computed as mod(ans * b, mod_val). Since ans and b are 64-bit integers, their product can be up to (mod_val)^2, which is about 1e18, which fits in 64 bits.\n\nSo temp_ans is integer(8).\n\nThen, converting to string s.\n\nThe rest of the code for processing the string is okay, since the string is just the digits.\n\nNow, the pow_mod function must be adjusted to use integer(8) parameters and mod_val as integer(8).\n\nPutting all together, the corrected code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8), parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007_8\n\n    integer :: n, i, a1, a2\n\n    integer(8) :: a, b, ans, temp_ans\n\n    integer(8), allocatable :: c(:)\n\n    character(len=20) :: s, s_a, s_b\n\n    !

Output the minimum\n\n    print*, min(a1, a2)\n\ncontains\n\n    integer(8) function pow_mod(x, n) result(res)\n\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: x, n\n\n        integer(8) :: res, base, exponent\n\n        res = 1_8\n\n        base = mod(x, mod_val)\n\n        exponent = n\n\n        do while (exponent > 0_8)\n\n            if (mod(exponent, 2_8) == 1_8) then\n\n                res = mod(res * base, mod_val)\n\n            end if\n\n            base = mod(base * base, mod_val)\n\n            exponent = exponent / 2_8\n\n        end do\n\n    end function pow_mod\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the pow_mod function, the parameters x and n are integer(8). The function returns an integer(8).\n\nNow, checking the loop for ans:\n\nThe loop runs from i=2 to n+1. The index n+2 -i for the array c. Since c is 1-based, this should be correct.\n\nTesting with an example:\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\nThen the array c has two elements, sorted.\n\nThe loop runs i from 2 to 3 (since n+1=3).\n\nFor i=2:\n\nn+2 -i = 2+2-2 = 2 \u2192 c(2).\n\ni=3:\n\nn+2 -3 = 2+2-3 =1 \u2192 c(1).\n\nSo the terms are c(2) and c(1), which are the two elements in sorted order (since sorted in ascending order, c(1) is smaller than c(2). So the loop is taking the elements in reverse order (c(2), c(1)), multiplied by a*i (a is 2^(n-2) = 2^0 =1 when n=2).\n\nSo the ans would be a*2 * c(2) + a*3 * c(1). Then multiplied by b=2^2=4.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=2:\n\na = 2^(0) =1.\n\nb=4.\n\nans starts at 0.\n\ni=2:\n\nval = 1*2 mod mod_val \u2192 2.\n\nval *= c(2) \u2192 2*c(2).\n\nans += that \u2192 2*c(2).\n\ni=3:\n\nval =1*3 mod mod_val \u21923.\n\nval *= c(1) \u21923*c(1).\n\nans += that \u2192 2c2 +3c1.\n\nThen ans is (2c2 +3c1) mod mod_val.\n\nMultiply by b (4):\n\nTotal is 4*(2c2 +3c1) mod mod_val.\n\nWhich matches the Java code's logic.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the string processing part:\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 123, then the string is \"123\".\n\nProcessing a1:\n\nStart with \"123\".\n\ni=2 (second character '2'):\n\nCompare with previous '1' \u2192 different. No change.\n\ni=3 (third character '3'):\n\nCompare with '2' \u2192 different. No change. So a1=0.\n\nProcessing a2:\n\nStart with \"123\".\n\nLoop from i=3 down to 2.\n\ni=3:\n\nCheck characters 3 and 2: '2' vs '3' \u2192 different. No change.\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck characters 2 and 1: '1' vs '2' \u2192 different. No change. So a2=0.\n\nThus the minimum is 0.\n\nBut if the output was \"111\", then:\n\na1 processing:\n\ni=2: '1' and '1' \u2192 same. Change to '0', a1=1. Now string is \"101\".\n\ni=3: '0' and '1' \u2192 different. So a1=1.\n\na2 processing:\n\nStart with \"111\".\n\nLoop i=3:\n\nCheck 3 and 2: '1' and '1' \u2192 same. Change previous (position 2) to '0', a2=1. Now string is \"101\".\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck 2 and 1: '0' vs '1' \u2192 different. No change. So a2=1.\n\nThus min is 1.\n\nWhich matches the second Java code's logic.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the final Fortran program should look like this."
