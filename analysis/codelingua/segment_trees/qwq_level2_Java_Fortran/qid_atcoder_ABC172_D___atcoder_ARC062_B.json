    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC172_D) reads an integer n from input, then calculates some formula involving a loop. The formula is ans += i * (n/i) * (n/i +1)/2 for each i from 1 to n. The result is printed.\n\nThe second Java file (atcoder_ARC062_B) takes a string S as input, then calculates a score based on comparing each character in S with 'g' or 'p' alternately. The score is incremented by 1 if the current character (my) is 'p' and different from his, or subtracted by 1 if my is 'g' and different. Wait, actually looking at the code: the my is 'g' when i is even (0-based?), so for each position i, if my (alternating between g and p) is not equal to his character, then the score changes. The code adds 1 if my was 'p' (so when i is odd?), or subtracts 1 if my was 'g' (i even). Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the code, for i starting at 0, i%2==0 means even index (since 0 is even), so my is 'g' for even indices, 'p' for odd. So when my != his, then:\n\nif my is 'g' (even i), then the score increases by -1? Because the code says: if my != his, then add (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe line is: score += my == 'p' ? 1 : -1. So when my is 'g', then the value is -1, so adding -1. When my is 'p', then adding 1. So when my is 'g' and different, subtract 1, when my is 'p' and different, add 1.\n\nSo the total score is the count of mismatches where my was 'p' minus the mismatches where my was 'g'.\n\nNow, the problem is to chain these two Java programs. The first program's output is the input to the second. Wait, but the first program outputs a number, and the second expects a string. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Wait, the user says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the first program outputs a number (the ans variable), and the second program expects a string S. So the first program's output must be a string that the second program can read as S. So the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as the input string to the second program. So the second program's input is that number as a string. For example, if the first program outputs 123, then the second program's S is \"123\".\n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the InputReader's next() method reads tokens. So when the input is the output of the first program, which is a number, the second program's S would be that number as a string. So the second program's S is the string representation of the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input (the original input to the first Java program), compute the first program's result, then use that result as the input to the second program's processing, and output the final result of the second program.\n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input (the original input to the first Java program, which is an integer n).\n\n2. Compute the first part's ans (the same as the first Java program).\n\n3. Then, take that ans as the string S for the second part's processing.\n\n4. Compute the score based on that string S.\n\n5. Output the final score.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must do all steps without any intermediate I/O except for the first input and the final output.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first part (the first Java program):\n\nThe first part's code is straightforward. The formula is ans += i * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2 for each i from 1 to n. Wait, in Java, the division is integer division. So in Fortran, using integer division.\n\nWait, in Java, (long) n / (long) i is integer division. So in Fortran, we can do integer division with / operator if variables are integers.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize ans = 0\n\nLoop i from 1 to n:\n\n   temp = n / i\n\n   ans = ans + i * temp * (temp + 1) / 2\n\nWait, but in Java, the formula is (long) i * ((long) n/(long)i) * ... etc. So in Fortran, since n and i are integers, the division is integer division. So the same.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the order of operations matters. Let me make sure the formula is correctly translated.\n\nThe term is i multiplied by (n divided by i) multiplied by ( (n divided by i) +1 ) divided by 2. So the formula is:\n\ni * (n//i) * ( (n//i)+1 ) / 2\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division by 2 must be integer division? Or is it real? Wait, in Java, since all terms are long (integers), the division by 2 is integer division (since the entire expression is added to a long). So in Fortran, we need to ensure that the division by 2 is integer division. So perhaps using integer division.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if all variables are integers, then the division is integer division. So the expression (temp*(temp+1))/2 would be integer division. So the code would be okay.\n\nNow, the second part: processing the string S which is the output of the first part (the ans value). The second part's S is the string representation of ans. So in Fortran, after computing ans, we need to convert it to a string, then process each character.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, handling strings can be a bit tricky. Let's see.\n\nFirst, after computing ans (the first part's result), we need to convert it to a string. Let's say ans is a 64-bit integer (since in Java it's a long, which is 64 bits). In Fortran, we can use an integer*8 variable (if using 64-bit integers). Then, to convert it to a string, we can use write statement into a character variable.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\ninteger*8 :: ans\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\nBut we have to make sure that the string is properly formatted, without any leading spaces. The 'i0' format writes the integer without leading spaces, so that's good.\n\nOnce we have the string S, we can process each character.\n\nThe second part's algorithm is:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over each character in S (from index 1 to len_trim(s)):\n\n   current position i (starting at 0 in Java, but in Fortran arrays start at 1). Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i=0; i < S.length(); i++), so the first character is index 0, which is even (i mod 2 ==0). So in Fortran, the first character is index 1, so we need to adjust the parity.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the first character is index 1. So for the i-th character (Fortran's index), the original Java's i would be (fortran_i -1). So the parity is (fortran_i -1) mod 2. So for fortran_i from 1 to len_trim(s):\n\n   my_char is 'g' if (fortran_i -1) mod 2 ==0 (i.e., fortran_i is odd: 1,3,5 etc.), else 'p'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nJava's i starts at 0 (even), so for fortran_i=1 (Java's i=0) \u2192 even \u2192 'g'\n\nfortran_i=2 \u2192 Java's i=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 'p'\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each character in the string S (from 1 to len_trim(s)):\n\n   current index in Fortran is j (from 1 to len_trim(s))\n\n   original Java's i is j-1.\n\n   if (j-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 my is 'g'\n\n   else \u2192 'p'\n\n   compare with the character at position j in S.\n\n   if my != his_char (S(j)), then:\n\n      if my is 'p', add 1 to score\n\n      else (my is 'g'), subtract 1 from score.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nInitialize score =0\n\nLoop over each character in the string S:\n\n   j from 1 to len_trim(S):\n\n      my = 'g' if (j-1) mod 2 ==0 else 'p'\n\n      his_char = S(j:j)\n\n      if (my .ne. his_char) then\n\n          if (my == 'p') then\n\n              score = score +1\n\n          else\n\n              score = score -1\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran:\n\nThe program must:\n\n1. Read the input n (integer).\n\n2. Compute ans as per first Java program.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string S.\n\n4. Compute the score based on S.\n\n5. Output the score.\n\nNow, handling the variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's outline the steps.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\ninteger*8 :: n, ans, i, temp, score\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nBut wait, n is read as an integer. Since in Java it's an int (32 bits), but in the first program, n can be up to 2^31-1, but in Fortran, if using default integers (4 bytes), that's okay. However, the ans can be up to n*(n) terms, so for n up to 1e9, ans could be up to 1e18, which requires 64-bit integers. So better to use integer*8 for ans and n.\n\nWait, in the first Java program, n is an int (so up to 2^31-1), but the loop runs up to n, and the ans is a long (64 bits). So in Fortran, n can be integer*8, and ans as integer*8.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer*8 :: n, ans, i, temp, score\n\n  character(len=20) :: s\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  ! Compute first part\n\n  ans = 0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n\n      temp = n / i\n\n      ans = ans + i * temp * (temp +1) / 2\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert ans to string s\n\n  write(s, '(i0)') ans\n\n  ! Compute second part\n\n  score = 0\n\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n      integer :: j = i\n\n      character :: my_char\n\n      if (mod(j-1,2) ==0) then\n\n          my_char = 'g'\n\n      else\n\n          my_char = 'p'\n\n      end if\n\n      if (my_char .ne. s(i:i)) then\n\n          if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n              score = score +1\n\n          else\n\n              score = score -1\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the score\n\n  write(*,*) score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loop for the second part, the variable i is used here, but in Fortran, the loop variable can be the same as the first loop's variable? Because in the first loop, i is from 1 to n, but after that, the second loop's i is from 1 to len_trim(s). Since the first loop's i is a local variable in its loop, but in Fortran, variables are not block-scoped. So the variable i is the same in both loops. That's a problem. Because after the first loop, the second loop will overwrite the value of i, but that's okay as long as we don't need the first loop's i anymore. But in the second loop, the variable i is used to index the string. So the code is okay, but to avoid confusion, perhaps use a different variable name for the second loop.\n\nAlternatively, use a different loop variable, like j.\n\nLet me adjust that:\n\nIn the second loop:\n\ndo j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n   ... \n\nend do\n\nSo changing the code:\n\nscore =0\n\ndo j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n    if (mod(j-1,2) ==0) then\n\n        my_char = 'g'\n\n    else\n\n        my_char = 'p'\n\n    end if\n\n    if (my_char .ne. s(j:j)) then\n\n        if (my_char == 'p') then\n\n            score = score +1\n\n        else\n\n            score = score -1\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThat's better. Also, the variable j is declared inside the loop? No, in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So need to declare j as an integer.\n\nWait, in the current code, variables are declared at the top. So adding:\n\ninteger :: j\n\nWait, but in the program's variable declarations:\n\nWait, the variables declared are:\n\ninteger*8 :: n, ans, i, temp, score\n\nWait, the i here is declared as integer*8, but in the first loop, the loop variable i is of type integer*8. But in the second loop, using j as an integer (default 4 bytes) would be okay, since the length of the string is unlikely to exceed 2^31. Alternatively, to be safe, perhaps use integer*8 for j as well. But probably not necessary. Let me adjust the declarations.\n\nWait, the variables:\n\nn is integer*8 (since it's the input from the first Java program, which uses int, but in Fortran, even if n is up to 2^31-1, integer*8 can hold it).\n\nans is integer*8.\n\ni in the first loop is an index from 1 to n, so it's okay as integer*8.\n\ntemp is the result of n/i, which is integer division, so integer*8.\n\nscore is the result of the second part, which can be up to the length of the string (each character can contribute +1 or -1). The maximum length of the string is, say, 20 digits, so the maximum score is 20. So score can be an integer*8, but even a regular integer (4 bytes) would suffice. But to be safe, perhaps keep it as integer*8.\n\nThe loop variable j in the second loop can be an integer (4 bytes), since the string length is at most 20.\n\nSo, adding to the variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: j\n\nSo the full code would be:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer*8 :: n, ans, i, temp, score\n\n  integer :: j\n\n  character(len=20) :: s\n\n  ! Read input\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  ! Compute first part\n\n  ans = 0_8\n\n  do i = 1_8, n\n\n      temp = n / i\n\n      ans = ans + i * temp * (temp +1_8) / 2_8\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Convert ans to string s\n\n  write(s, '(i0)') ans\n\n  ! Compute second part\n\n  score = 0_8\n\n  do j = 1, len_trim(s)\n\n      if (mod(j-1,2) ==0) then\n\n          if (s(j:j) .ne. 'g') then\n\n              score = score -1_8\n\n          end if\n\n      else\n\n          if (s(j:j) .ne. 'p') then\n\n              score = score +1_8\n\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the score\n\n  write(*,*) score\n\nend program main\n\nWait, perhaps I can optimize the second part's code. Let me see:\n\nThe original code in Java for the second part:\n\nfor each character at position i (0-based):\n\n   my is 'g' if even, 'p' if odd.\n\n   if my != his_char:\n\n       score += (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1)\n\nSo when my is 'g' (even index), and different, subtract 1.\n\nWhen my is 'p' (odd index), and different, add 1.\n\nAlternatively, in the code above, for each j (1-based):\n\nif (j-1) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 even (my is 'g')\n\nthen, if s(j:j) is not 'g', then subtract 1.\n\nElse (my is 'p'), if s(j:j) is not 'p', add 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nmy_char = 'g' when (j-1) even, else 'p'\n\nthen compare to s(j:j). If different, then:\n\nif my_char is 'g', subtract 1, else add 1.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nmy_char = 'g'\n\nif mod(j-1,2) ==1 then\n\n   my_char = 'p'\n\nend if\n\nif (my_char .ne. s(j:j)) then\n\n   if (my_char == 'g') then\n\n       score = score -1\n\n   else\n\n       score = score +1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nBut the code I wrote earlier is equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif (mod(j-1,2) ==0) then\n\n   if (s(j:j) .ne. 'g') then\n\n       score = score -1\n\n   end if\n\nelse\n\n   if (s(j:j) .ne. 'p') then\n\n       score = score +1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nWhich is what I have in the code above. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing for possible issues.\n\nFirst, the conversion of ans to a string. The write statement uses '(i0)', which writes the integer without leading spaces. So for example, if ans is 123, then s will be '123', and len_trim(s) is 3.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the division in the first part must be integer division. Since n and i are integer*8, the division is integer division.\n\nWait, in the first loop:\n\ntemp = n / i \u2192 integer division.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the formula in the first part:\n\nans += i * temp * (temp +1)/2\n\nWait, in Fortran, the order of operations is important. The multiplication and division are left to right unless parentheses change it. So i * temp * (temp+1) is (i * temp) * (temp+1), then divided by 2. But in the Java code, it's (i) * (temp) * (temp+1) / 2, so same.\n\nBut in Fortran, since all are integers, the division by 2 is integer division. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the entire expression is cast to long, but since all variables are long, it's okay. So in Fortran, as long as the variables are 64-bit integers, it's okay.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the first loop, the loop variable i is declared as integer*8. The loop is from 1 to n (which is integer*8). So that's okay.\n\nNow, the write statement for the string:\n\nwrite(s, '(i0)') ans\n\nThis should correctly write the integer ans into the string s, without leading spaces. The len of s is 20, which is sufficient for numbers up to 1e18 (which is 19 digits). So that's okay.\n\nNow, the second loop:\n\nThe loop runs from 1 to len_trim(s). For each character in the string.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose the first program's input is n=1.\n\nFirst program's ans is 1 * (1/1)*(1+1)/2 \u2192 1*1*2/2 =1. So ans=1.\n\nThen the second program's S is \"1\".\n\nProcessing the string \"1\":\n\nLength is 1.\n\nj=1:\n\nj-1=0 \u2192 mod 2 is 0 \u2192 my is 'g'.\n\nCompare with '1' (since the first character is '1').\n\n'g' vs '1' are different \u2192 so subtract 1.\n\nSo score is -1.\n\nSo the output is -1.\n\nWait, but let's see what the Java code would do.\n\nFirst program's output is 1 \u2192 the second program's input is \"1\".\n\nIn the second Java program:\n\nS is \"1\".\n\nLoop over i from 0 to 0 (since length is 1).\n\ni=0 \u2192 even \u2192 my is 'g'.\n\nhis_char is '1'.\n\nmy != his \u2192 so add (my == 'p' ? 1 : -1 \u2192 since my is 'g', so -1.\n\nSo the score is -1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2.\n\nFirst program:\n\nans = for i=1: 1*(2/1)*(2+1)/2 \u2192 1*2*3/2 =3\n\ni=2: 2*(2/2)*(2/2 +1)/2 \u2192 2*1*(2)/2 \u2192 2*1*2/2 \u2192 2.\n\nTotal ans=3+2=5.\n\nSo the second program's S is \"5\".\n\nProcessing \"5\":\n\nLength 1.\n\nj=1 \u2192 my is 'g', compare to '5' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1 \u2192 score -1.\n\nSo output is -1.\n\nAnother test case where the string is longer.\n\nSuppose n=3.\n\nFirst program:\n\ni=1: 1*(3/1)*(3+1)/2 \u2192 1*3*4/2 =6\n\ni=2: 2*(1)*(2)/2 \u2192 2*1*2/2 \u2192 2.\n\ni=3: 3*(1)*(2)/2 \u2192 3*1*2/2 \u2192 3.\n\nTotal ans=6+2+3=11 \u2192 S is \"11\".\n\nProcessing \"11\":\n\nCharacters are '1' and '1'.\n\nj=1 (i=0 in Java):\n\nmy is 'g' \u2192 compare to '1' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\nj=2 (i=1 in Java):\n\nmy is 'p' \u2192 compare to '1' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1.\n\nTotal score: -1 +1 =0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nLet me see what the Java code would do:\n\nSecond program's S is \"11\".\n\nFirst character (i=0) is '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\nSecond character (i=1) is '1' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 add 1.\n\nTotal score: -1 +1 =0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where the string has 'g's and 'p's.\n\nSuppose the first program's output is 123 \u2192 S is \"123\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nj=1 (i=0 \u2192 'g') \u2192 '1' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 -1.\n\nj=2 (i=1 \u2192 'p') \u2192 '2' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 +1.\n\nj=3 (i=2 \u2192 'g') \u2192 '3' vs 'g' \u2192 different \u2192 -1.\n\nTotal score: -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nAlternatively, if the string was \"gpp\", then:\n\nj=1: 'g' vs 'g' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\nj=2: 'p' vs 'p' \u2192 same \u2192 no change.\n\nj=3: 'g' vs 'p' \u2192 different \u2192 subtract 1.\n\nTotal score: -1.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables are declared as integer*8 for n, ans, etc. But in the second part, the score can be a regular integer, but using integer*8 is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the first loop, the loop variable i is of type integer*8, and the loop runs from 1 to n (which is also integer*8). That's okay.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran should be correct.\n\nWait, in the first loop, the initial ans is set to 0. Then, in each iteration, ans += ... So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the formula, the division by 2 is integer division. Since (temp*(temp+1)) is even, because either temp or temp+1 is even. So the division by 2 is exact. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct."
