Next iteration: r=1. 9-1=8 <1? 8 is not less than 1. So add 1. So list is [0,1]. Then newNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 = 10. So the output is 10. So the code works.

At i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 5. So check if it's 10? No. Then check if it's <5? No. Else if ==5 : yes. Then check if digits[i+1] (digits[1]) is >=5? digits[1] is 0, so no. So add 5 to bills. Then proceed. Then i=1: digits[1] is 0. So first condition: not 10. Then since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. So total bills is 5+0=5. But let's see what the code does. Wait, but in the code, when i=1 (the last element), the code checks digits[i] (digits[1] is 0). So the first condition is false. Then since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. So total is 5. So the output is 5.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (codeforces_514_A.java) takes a long integer input. It processes each digit from the right (since it uses x % 10). For each digit, if 9 minus the digit is less than the digit itself, it replaces the digit with 9 - r, except when the remaining x is 0 and the difference is zero (maybe to avoid leading zeros?). Then it builds a new number by reversing the list of processed digits. The output is this new number.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC155_E.java) takes the output from the first as input. It reads a string, converts each character to digits in reverse order (so the digits are stored in reverse). Then it processes the digits to calculate some 'bills' value. The processing involves handling digits in a way that seems like counting the minimal coins or something similar, but with some carry-over logic. The final output is the total bills.\n\nSo the Fortran program must first read the input, process it through the first algorithm, then pass the result to the second algorithm's processing, and finally output the result of the second.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the initial input (the first program's input) as a string, since the second program might need to process it as a string. Wait, but the first program processes a number. Hmm, but in the first Java program, the input is a long, so maybe in Fortran, we can read it as an integer*8 (since Java's long is 64 bits). But the second program expects a string input. Wait, the second Java program's input is a string (number = sc.next()), so the output of the first program is a number, but the second program reads it as a string. So in Fortran, the first step is to read the input as a string, then process it through the first algorithm's logic, then pass the resulting number (from first) as a string to the second algorithm's processing.\n\nWait, but the first Java program's output is a number. The second Java program reads that number as a string. So in Fortran, the first part must process the input number (from the user) into the newNumber, then convert that newNumber to a string to process in the second part.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input as a string (since the first program's input is a number, but in Java it's read via nextLong, so maybe in Fortran, read as a string, then convert to integer? Or perhaps read as an integer? But leading zeros might be an issue. Hmm, but the first Java program processes the number digit by digit, so leading zeros in the input might be ignored. Wait, the first Java program's loop runs while x >0, so leading zeros in the input would not be part of x. So the input is a number, possibly with leading zeros? Wait, no, because when you read a number, leading zeros are part of the value. Wait, but in Java, if you input \"00123\", Scanner.nextLong() would read it as 123. So the first program's input is a number (without leading zeros except possibly a single zero). So in Fortran, perhaps read the input as a string, then convert to an integer. But Fortran might have issues with very large numbers (since Java's long is 64 bits, but Fortran's integer*8 can handle that). Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's process the first part:\n\nFirst Java program's logic:\n\nTake the input number x. Process each digit from the end (rightmost digit first). For each digit r (x mod 10), decide whether to replace it with 9 - r if that's smaller. Then collect the digits in a list, then reverse them to form the new number.\n\nWait, the list is built by adding each digit (processed) in the order of the digits from right to left. Then when building newNumber, they are multiplied by 10^pow, so the first element (the original rightmost digit) becomes the leftmost digit of newNumber. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe list is built by adding each digit (starting from the rightmost digit of x) in the order of processing. Then when building newNumber, the first element (the first digit processed, which is the original rightmost digit) is multiplied by 10^0 (so it's the units place in newNumber). The next element is multiplied by 10^1 (tens place), etc. So the list is stored in the order of the digits from right to left of the original number, but when building newNumber, they are added in the order of the list, so the first element is the least significant digit of newNumber. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nSuppose original x is 123. The first digit processed is 3 (x mod 10), then 2, then 1. The list would be [processed3, processed2, processed1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (processed3) is added as *10^0, then processed2 *10^1, then processed1 *10^2. So the newNumber is processed3 *1 + processed2 *10 + processed1 *100. So the digits of newNumber are in the same order as the original digits, but each digit is possibly replaced. So the newNumber is the same length as the original, but each digit is replaced as per the condition.\n\nWait, but the original x is processed digit by digit, starting from the right. The list is built in the order of the digits from right to left. Then when building newNumber, the list is processed from first to last, which is right to left of the original, so the newNumber's digits are in the same order as the original, but each digit is replaced. So the newNumber is the same length as the original, but each digit is the processed version.\n\nWait, but the code in the first Java program:\n\nThe loop is while x>0, so for x=123, the first iteration x is 123, r=3, then x becomes 12. Next iteration, r=2, x becomes 1. Then r=1, x becomes 0. So the list is [processed3, processed2, processed1]. Then when building newNumber, the first element (processed3) is added as *10^0, then processed2 *10^1, then processed1 *10^2. So the newNumber is (processed3) + (processed2)*10 + (processed1)*100. So the digits of newNumber are in the same order as the original digits (since the first digit of newNumber is processed1 *100, which is the hundreds place). So the newNumber's digits are in the same order as the original, but each digit is replaced.\n\nWait, but the original digits are 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 3 (units). The newNumber's digits would be processed1 (hundreds), processed2 (tens), processed3 (units). Wait no, because the first element in the list is processed3 (the original units digit), so when building newNumber, the first element is added as units, so the newNumber's digits are processed3 (units), processed2 (tens), processed1 (hundreds). So the newNumber is the reverse of the list? Wait no, the list is [processed3, processed2, processed1], and when building newNumber, each element is multiplied by 10^pow, where pow starts at 0 and increments. So the first element (processed3) is 10^0 (units), then processed2 is 10^1 (tens), then processed1 is 10^2 (hundreds). So the newNumber is processed3 + processed2*10 + processed1*100. So the digits of newNumber are in the same order as the original digits, but each digit is replaced. Wait, the original digits were 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 3 (units). The newNumber's digits are processed1 (hundreds?), no. Wait, the hundreds digit in newNumber is processed1, because processed1 is multiplied by 100. So the hundreds digit is processed1, the tens is processed2, the units is processed3. So the digits are in the same order as the original. So the newNumber is the same length as the original, with each digit replaced as per the condition.\n\nSo the first program's processing is to take each digit of the input number, process it (replace with 9 - r if that's smaller), then assemble them back in the same order (since the list is built from right to left, but when building newNumber, the digits are placed in the correct positions). So the newNumber is the number formed by the processed digits in the same order as the original.\n\nWait, but the list is built in the order of the digits from right to left. So when building newNumber, the first element (the rightmost digit of the original) is placed in the units place, the next in the tens, etc. So the newNumber is the same as the original's digit order, but each digit is replaced. So the processing is correct.\n\nNow, the second Java program takes the output of the first (the newNumber) as a string. Let's see what it does.\n\nThe second program reads the number as a string, then reverses the digits (since it loops from 0 to number.length-1, and takes the character at position number.length-1 -i, which is the reverse order). So the digits array is the reversed digits of the input string. For example, if the input is \"123\", digits would be [3,2,1], but stored in an array of length+1 (since the array is size number.length+1). Wait, the array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1], so digits has an extra element at the end (digits[number.length()] is initialized to 0? Or maybe not, but in Java, arrays are initialized with 0 for int. So the digits array is of length n+1, where n is the length of the input string. The first n elements are the reversed digits, and the last is 0 initially.\n\nThen, the loop runs for i from 0 to number.length (so up to n, including the last element). The processing is:\n\nFor each digit in digits (including the last element which might be 0 or carryover):\n\n- If the current digit is 10, then we carry over 1 to the next digit (digits[i+1] +=1, and set digits[i] to 0). Wait, but digits[i] can't be 10 normally, unless there was a carryover from previous steps.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\nThe loop is for (int i = 0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\n    if (digits[i] == 10) {\n        digits[i + 1]++;\n        digits[i] = 0;\n    }\n\n    if (digits[i] <5) {\n        bills += digits[i];\n    } else if (digits[i] ==5) {\n        if (digits[i+1] >=5) {\n            digits[i+1]++;\n        }\n        bills +=5;\n    } else {\n        digits[i+1]++;\n        bills +=10 - digits[i];\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the digits array is of size n+1, so when i is number.length(), then i+1 would be n+1, which is beyond the array. Wait, but in Java, the array is initialized to n+1 elements, so digits has indices 0 to n. So when i is n (the last element), then digits[i+1] would be digits[n+1], which is out of bounds. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the loop is up to i <= number.length(), which is n. So when i is n, then i+1 is n+1, which is beyond the array's size (since the array is size n+1, indices 0..n). So that's an error. Wait, maybe the code is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program:\n\ndigits is initialized as new int[number.length() +1], so the indices go from 0 to number.length(). So when i is number.length(), then digits[i] is the last element (digits[number.length()]). Then, in the first condition, if digits[i] is 10, then digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is beyond the array. That's an error. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the loop is supposed to run up to i < number.length()? Or maybe the code is correct and the array is of size n+2? Hmm, perhaps the code has a bug, but since it's given, I have to replicate it as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loop is intended to process up to the last element, and the digits[i+1] is allowed to go beyond, but in Java, that would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So perhaps the code is incorrect, but since it's part of the problem, I have to assume that it works as written. Maybe the loop is supposed to run for i from 0 to number.length() -1, but the code says i <= number.length(). Hmm, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+1, so when i is n (the last element), digits[i+1] is digits[n+1], which is beyond the array. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the code is written in a way that the digits array is of size n+1, so the maximum index is n. So when i is n, then i+1 is n+1, which is out of bounds. So that's a bug. But since the problem gives this code, perhaps I have to proceed as per the code's logic, even if there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop is supposed to process up to i < number.length(), but the code says i <= number.length(). Maybe the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+1, so when i is n, digits[i] is the carryover digit beyond the original digits. Let me think through an example.\n\nSuppose the input is \"5\". Then number.length() is 1. The digits array is of size 2 (indices 0 and 1). The first element (digits[0]) is 5 (since the input is \"5\", reversed is [5], so digits[0] =5, digits[1] is 0.\n\nThen the loop runs for i from 0 to 1 (since number.length() is 1, so i goes up to 1).\n\nAt i=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 5. So check if it's 10? No. Then check if it's <5? No. Else if ==5: yes. Then check if digits[i+1] (digits[1]) is >=5? digits[1] is 0, so no. So add 5 to bills. Then proceed.\n\nThen i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 0. So first condition: not 10. Then since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. So total bills is 5+0=5. But let's see what the code does.\n\nWait, but in the code, when i=1 (the last element), the code checks digits[i] (digits[1] is 0). So the first condition is false. Then since 0 <5, add 0 to bills. So total is 5. So the output is 5. But what's the correct processing here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the loop is intended to process all elements including the last one. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the second program's processing:\n\nThe digits array is the reversed digits of the input string, plus an extra element (digits[n] is initially 0). The loop processes each digit, including the last one (digits[n]).\n\nThe first step in the loop is to check if the current digit is 10. If so, carry over to the next digit. This is probably to handle cases where a digit was increased beyond 9 (like when adding 1 in the else clause). For example, if a digit was 9, and we add 1, making it 10, then we carry over to the next digit.\n\nThen, depending on the digit's value, the bills are calculated. The algorithm seems to be counting the minimal number of coins (or something similar) where each digit can be represented as either the digit itself or 10 - digit, but with some conditions involving the next digit.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- For each digit, if it's less than 5, add it to bills.\n\n- If it's exactly 5, add 5, but if the next digit is >=5, then carry over 1 to the next digit (so that the next digit's processing can account for that).\n\n- If it's more than 5, add 10 - digit to bills, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nWait, the code for the else clause (digits[i] >5):\n\ndigits[i+1] +=1\n\nbills +=10 - digits[i]\n\nSo, for example, if the digit is 6, then 10-6=4 is added to bills, and the next digit is increased by 1.\n\nThe first part of the loop (checking if digits[i] is 10) is to handle any carryover from previous steps. For example, if a digit was set to 10, then it's carried over to the next digit.\n\nThe algorithm is a bit tricky, but the key is to process each digit, considering possible carryover from previous digits, and decide whether to take the digit as is, or 10 - digit, and adjust the next digit accordingly.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the entire process must be done in a single Fortran program. The steps are:\n\n1. Read the input as a string (since the first program's input is a number, but the second program reads it as a string). Wait, but the first program's input is a number, so in Fortran, perhaps read as a string, then process through the first algorithm's steps, then pass the result to the second algorithm's processing.\n\nWait, the first program's output is a number (newNumber). The second program reads that as a string. So in Fortran, after processing the first part, we need to convert the newNumber into a string to process in the second part.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n- Read the input as a string (so that leading zeros are preserved if needed, but the first program's processing ignores leading zeros because it processes x while x>0. Wait, the first program's input is a long, so leading zeros would be stripped when read as a number. So perhaps in Fortran, read the input as a string, then convert to an integer (or integer*8) for processing the first part.\n\nWait, but in the first Java program, the input is read as a long, so leading zeros would be ignored. For example, input \"00123\" would be read as 123. So in Fortran, perhaps read the input as a string, then convert to an integer (or integer*8) to process the first part. Then, after processing, the newNumber is an integer, which we can convert back to a string for the second part's processing.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input as a string (to handle leading zeros?), but then convert to an integer for the first part's processing. Then, after processing, convert the newNumber to a string (without leading zeros?), then process that string through the second algorithm.\n\nWait, but the first program's processing may produce leading zeros? Let's see. The first program's loop runs while x>0, so when x becomes 0, the loop stops. So the digits are processed until x is 0. So for example, if the input is 0, then the loop doesn't run, and the newNumber is 0. So the output is 0, which is a single zero. The second program would read that as \"0\".\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead the input as a string, then convert to an integer (or integer*8) to process the first part. Then, after processing, convert the newNumber to a string (with leading zeros if necessary?), but the second program's processing requires the string representation of the newNumber. Since the first program's processing may have leading zeros? Wait, no. Because the first program's processing builds the newNumber by adding digits from the list. The list is built from the digits of x (the input number) processed, but the newNumber is constructed by multiplying each digit by 10^pow, so leading zeros would not be present unless the first digit (the original leftmost digit) is zero. But since x is the input number, which is read as a long, leading zeros are not part of x. So the newNumber will not have leading zeros unless the input was zero.\n\nThus, the newNumber can be converted to a string with write(*,*) newNumber, but that might add leading zeros? No, in Fortran, writing an integer as a string would not have leading zeros unless specified. So perhaps we need to format it as a string without leading zeros. Alternatively, the second program's processing requires the string representation of the newNumber, so we can write it to a string variable.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input as a string (to handle leading zeros in the input, but the first program's processing ignores them). Wait, but the first program's input is a number, so leading zeros are stripped. So perhaps read the input as a string, then convert to an integer (or integer*8) to process the first part. Then, after processing, convert the newNumber to a string (without leading zeros) for the second part.\n\nWait, but the second program's input is the output of the first, which is a number. So the second program reads it as a string, so the string must be the exact digits of the newNumber. So in Fortran, after computing newNumber, we can write it to a string variable, say, newNumberStr, using an internal write statement.\n\nNow, let's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, the first part's processing:\n\nRead the input as a string, then convert to an integer (or integer*8). Let's use integer*8 (since Java's long is 64 bits). Let's call the input number x.\n\nProcess each digit of x:\n\nInitialize a list (in Fortran, perhaps an array) to hold the processed digits.\n\nLoop while x >0:\n\n   r = mod(x,10)\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then:\n\n      if (x/10 ==0 .and. 9 - r ==0) then:\n\n          add r to the list (since 9 - r is zero, but if x/10 is zero (i.e., this is the last digit and 9 - r is zero, then we add r instead?)\n\nWait, the condition in the first Java program is:\n\nif (9 - r < r) {\n\n   if (x /10 ==0 && 9 - r ==0) list.add(r);\n\n   else list.add(9 - r);\n\n}\n\nElse list.add(r);\n\nWait, the first condition is whether 9 - r is less than r. If yes, then we choose 9 - r, except when the remaining x (after division by 10) is zero (i.e., this is the last digit) and 9 - r is zero. In that case, we add r instead of 0 (since adding 0 would make the number have a leading zero? Or perhaps to avoid leading zero? Let's see.\n\nSuppose the input is 5. Then x is 5. The first iteration:\n\nr =5 mod10 =5.\n\n9-5=4 <5? 4 <5 is true. So check if x/10 (5/10=0) is zero and 9 -r (4) is zero? 4 is not zero, so add 4 to the list. Then newNumber would be 4, so the output is 4. But according to the code, if the remaining x is zero (so it's the last digit), and 9 -r is zero, then add r. But in this case, 9 -r is 4, so the condition is not met, so add 4. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 9. Then r=9, 9-9=0 <9? yes. Then check if x/10 (9/10=0) is zero and 9 -r (0) is zero. So yes. So add r (9) instead of 0. So the newNumber is 9. So the code avoids leading zero.\n\nAnother example: input is 10. Then x=10. The first iteration: r=0. 9-0=9 which is not less than 0 (since 9>0). So add 0. Then x becomes 1. Next iteration: r=1. 9-1=8 <1? 8 is not less than 1. So add 1. So list is [0,1]. Then newNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 = 10. So the output is 10. So the code works.\n\nSo the condition is to avoid leading zeros when the digit is the last one and 9 - r is zero. So in that case, we add r instead of 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, for each digit r:\n\nif (9 - r < r) then:\n\n   if (x/10 ==0 .and. (9 - r) ==0) then:\n\n      add r to the list\n\n   else:\n\n      add (9 - r) to the list\n\nelse:\n\n   add r to the list\n\nThen, after processing all digits, the list contains the processed digits in the order of the original digits from right to left. Then, to form newNumber, we need to multiply each digit by 10^power, starting from the first element (the original rightmost digit) as 10^0, next as 10^1, etc.\n\nWait, the list is built in the order of the digits from right to left. So the first element is the original rightmost digit, then next is the next to the left, etc. So when building newNumber, the first element is the units digit, the second is the tens, etc. So the newNumber is the sum over i from 0 to n-1 of (digit_list(i+1) * 10^i).\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can process the digits as follows:\n\nInitialize an array to hold the processed digits. Let's say, an array of integers, say, processed_digits, with a size sufficient to hold all digits (maybe 20 elements for 64-bit numbers).\n\nInitialize the array index to 0.\n\nThen, while x >0:\n\n   r = mod(x,10)\n\n   compute the processed digit as per the condition.\n\n   store in processed_digits(index) = processed_digit\n\n   index = index +1\n\n   x = x /10\n\nThen, after collecting all digits, the array has the digits in reverse order (right to left of original). To form newNumber:\n\nnewNumber = 0\n\ndo i = 0, index-1\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + processed_digits(i) * 10**i\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, exponentiation is **, but for large exponents, we need to be careful with integer overflow. Since the maximum possible exponent is up to 18 (for 64-bit numbers, which can have up to 19 digits), 10^18 is manageable as an integer*8 (since 1e18 is about 1e18, which is within 64-bit integer's range (2^63 is ~9e18, so 1e18 is okay).\n\nWait, 10^18 is 1e18, which is less than 2^60 (approx 1e18 is 10^18, 2^60 is ~1.1e18). So 10^18 is within 64-bit integer's range (which can go up to ~9e18). So yes.\n\nSo the first part's processing is manageable.\n\nNow, the second part's processing.\n\nThe second part takes the newNumber as a string. So in Fortran, after computing newNumber, we need to convert it to a string. Let's do that with an internal write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: newNumberStr\n\nwrite(newNumberStr, '(i0)') newNumber\n\ntrim the string to remove leading spaces (since i0 format may have leading spaces for numbers with fewer digits). Alternatively, use a format that doesn't add spaces. Alternatively, use adjustl to left-justify.\n\nnewNumberStr = adjustl(newNumberStr)\n\nThen, process this string as per the second Java program's logic.\n\nThe second program's steps:\n\n1. Read the string (number) as input. In our case, it's newNumberStr.\n\n2. Convert each character to digits in reverse order. So the digits array is the reversed digits of the input string, stored in an array of length n+1 (where n is the length of the input string).\n\nWait, in the second Java program, the digits array is initialized as new int[number.length() +1], so the length is n+1. The first n elements are the reversed digits, and the last is 0 (since arrays are initialized to 0 in Java).\n\nIn Fortran, we can do:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_digits = 20\n\ninteger :: n, i\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s = newNumberStr\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: digits(n+1)\n\ndigits = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   digits(i-1) = ichar(s(n - i +1: n -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe input string s has length n (after trimming). The digits array has size n+1 (indices 0 to n).\n\nThe loop for i from 1 to n:\n\n   the ith character from the end is s(n -i +1: n -i +1). For example, when i=1, it's the last character (position n), when i=2, it's position n-1, etc.\n\nSo digits(0) is the first character of the reversed string (the original last character), digits(1) is the next, etc., up to digits(n-1) being the first character of the original string. digits(n) is 0.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the digits array is filled as:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\n   digits[i] = number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0';\n\n}\n\nSo in Java, for a string of length m, the digits array has indices 0 to m-1 (since the array is size m+1, but the loop runs up to i < m). Wait, no, the loop in Java is for (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++) so for a string of length m, the loop runs m times, and digits[i] (for i from 0 to m-1) are set to the reversed digits. The digits array has size m+1, so digits[m] is 0 initially.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the digits array should be of size n+1 (where n is the length of the input string). The first n elements (indices 0 to n-1) are the reversed digits, and the last element (index n) is 0.\n\nSo the code above is correct.\n\nThen, the processing loop:\n\ndo i =0, n\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop runs from i=0 to n (since in the Java code it's i <= number.length(), which is n). The digits array has indices 0 to n (since it's size n+1). So when i =n, then digits(i+1) is digits(n+1), which is beyond the array's size. That's an error. So this is a problem.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the Java code has a bug here. Because when i is n (the last element of the digits array), then i+1 is n+1, which is beyond the array's bounds. So in Fortran, this would cause an out-of-bounds error.\n\nBut since the problem gives this code, I have to replicate it as is. So perhaps in the Java code, the digits array is of size n+2? Or maybe the loop is supposed to run up to i < n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+1, and when i is n, digits(i+1) is allowed to be out of bounds. But that can't be. So perhaps the code has a mistake, but since it's given, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loop in Java is supposed to run up to i < number.length(), which is n, so the loop runs from 0 to n-1. But the code says i <= number.length(), which is n. So perhaps the code is wrong, but I have to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+2, but the problem's code may have a mistake. Since I have to replicate the code as given, I'll proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, the digits array is of size n+1 (indices 0 to n). So when i =n, digits(i+1) is digits(n+1), which is beyond the array. So this is an error. To avoid this, perhaps the loop should run up to i < n. Or perhaps the code in Java is correct and the digits array is of size n+2. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nThe Java code for the second program:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() +1]; // size is m+1 where m is the length of the input string.\n\nThen the loop is for (int i=0; i <= number.length(); i++) { ... }\n\nnumber.length() is m, so the loop runs from i=0 to m (inclusive). So the maximum i is m, and digits[i] is digits[m], which is valid (since the array is size m+1, indices 0..m). But when i =m, then i+1 is m+1, which is beyond the array's size (since the array is m+1 elements, indices 0..m). So this is an error. So the code has a bug here.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since the code is given, perhaps the loop is supposed to run up to i < number.length(), but the code says i <=. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct and the digits array is of size m+2. But in the code, it's written as new int[number.length() +1], so that's m+1.\n\nThis is a problem. Since I have to replicate the code's behavior, perhaps the code in Java is intended to have the loop run up to i < number.length(), but the code has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size m+2, but the code says m+1. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct and the digits array is of size m+1, and the loop is allowed to go to i =m, but when i =m, the digits[i+1] is digits[m+1], which is beyond the array. So in Java, this would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So perhaps the code is incorrect, but since it's part of the problem, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the loop is supposed to process up to i < number.length(), so the loop should be for (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++) { ... }, but the code has a mistake. Since I can't change the code, I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nIn Fortran, to avoid the out-of-bounds error, perhaps the loop should run up to i =n-1 (since n is the length of the input string). Or perhaps the code is intended to have the digits array of size n+2, so in Fortran, we can set the digits array to be of size n+2, so that digits(n+1) is accessible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is such that when i reaches n (the last element of the digits array), the digits[i+1] is not used except in the case where digits[i] is 10. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the code's first condition:\n\nif (digits[i] ==10) then:\n\n   digits[i+1] +=1\n\n   digits[i] =0\n\nElse, in the other conditions, when digits[i] is 5 or more, then digits[i+1] is incremented.\n\nSo when i is n (the last element of the digits array), then digits[i] is digits[n], and digits[i+1] is digits[n+1], which is beyond the array. So this is an error.\n\nThus, the code has a bug. But since I have to replicate it, perhaps the code is intended to have the digits array of size n+2, so in Fortran, I can set the digits array to be of size n+2, so that digits(n+1) is accessible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the loop is supposed to run up to i < number.length(), so the loop in Fortran should be from 0 to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+1, and the loop is allowed to process i up to n, but when i is n, the digits[i+1] is not used except in the first condition. Let me see:\n\nSuppose i =n (the last element of the digits array). The first condition is if digits[i] ==10. If so, then digits[i+1] (digits[n+1]) is incremented. But since the array is only size n+1, this is out of bounds. So this is a bug.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since I have to proceed, perhaps the code's loop is supposed to run up to i < number.length(), so in Fortran, the loop should be from 0 to n-1. Let me proceed with that assumption, perhaps the original code had a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the digits array is of size n+2. Let me adjust the Fortran code accordingly.\n\nLet me proceed with the following approach:\n\nIn Fortran, for the second part:\n\nAfter getting the newNumberStr (length n), set the digits array to have size n+2 (indices 0 to n+1). Then, the loop runs from i=0 to n (since number.length() is n, so i <=n).\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_digits = 20\n\ninteger :: n, i, bills =0\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s = newNumberStr\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\ninteger :: digits(n+2) ! indices 0 to n+1\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   digits(i-1) = ichar(s(n -i +1: n -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\n! Now process the digits array from 0 to n (since the loop is up to n)\n\ndo i =0, n\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThis way, when i =n, digits(i+1) is digits(n+1), which is within the array's size (since it's n+2 elements). So this avoids the out-of-bounds error.\n\nThus, this adjustment is necessary to make the code work in Fortran.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read the input as a string.\n\n2. Convert it to an integer (or integer*8) for processing the first part.\n\n3. Process the first part to get newNumber.\n\n4. Convert newNumber to a string.\n\n5. Process the second part on that string to get bills.\n\n6. Output bills.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the first part's processing:\n\nRead the input as a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\n\nread(*,'(a)') input_str\n\nThen, convert to integer*8 (since Java's long is 64 bits):\n\ninteger*8 :: x, newNumber\n\nread(input_str,*) x\n\nThen process the digits of x:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_digits = 20\n\ninteger :: processed_digits(max_digits)\n\ninteger :: index =0\n\ndo while (x >0)\n\n   integer :: r = mod(x,10)\n\n   integer :: processed_r\n\n   if (9 - r < r) then\n\n      if (x/10 ==0 .and. (9 - r) ==0) then\n\n         processed_r = r\n\n      else\n\n         processed_r =9 - r\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      processed_r =r\n\n   end if\n\n   processed_digits(index) = processed_r\n\n   index = index +1\n\n   x = x /10\n\nend do\n\nThen, compute newNumber:\n\nnewNumber =0\n\ninteger :: i\n\ndo i=0, index-1\n\n   newNumber = newNumber + processed_digits(i) * 10**i\n\nend do\n\nNow, convert newNumber to a string:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: newNumberStr\n\nwrite(newNumberStr, '(i0)') newNumber\n\nnewNumberStr = adjustl(newNumberStr)\n\nThen process the second part:\n\nn = len_trim(newNumberStr)\n\ninteger :: bills =0\n\ninteger :: digits(n+2) ! indices 0 to n+1\n\ndigits =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   digits(i-1) = ichar(newNumberStr(n -i +1: n -i +1)) - ichar('0')\n\nend do\n\ndo i=0, n\n\n   if (digits(i) ==10) then\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      digits(i) =0\n\n   end if\n\n   if (digits(i) <5) then\n\n      bills = bills + digits(i)\n\n   else if (digits(i) ==5) then\n\n      if (digits(i+1) >=5) then\n\n         digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      end if\n\n      bills = bills +5\n\n   else\n\n      digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n      bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nFinally, output bills:\n\nprint*, bills\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran program would look like this.\n\nNow, let's check for possible issues:\n\n- Handling very large numbers (up to 1e18). The integer*8 in Fortran can handle that.\n\n- The first part's loop: when x is 0, the loop doesn't run, so index remains 0. Then newNumber is 0.\n\n- The second part's processing of \"0\" (n=1):\n\ndigits array size is 1+2=3 (indices 0,1,2). The digits(0) is 0, others 0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 1 (since n=1):\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=0 <5 \u2192 bills +=0.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=0 \u2192 bills +=0.\n\ni=2? No, the loop is up to n=1. Wait, no, n is 1, so the loop runs from i=0 to 1 (since n=1, the loop is i=0 to 1).\n\nWait, in the code above, the loop is do i=0, n \u2192 since n is 1, the loop runs i=0,1.\n\nWait, for n=1 (input \"0\"), the digits array is of size 3 (indices 0,1,2). The digits(0) is 0, digits(1) and 2 are 0.\n\nProcessing i=0:\n\ndigits(0)=0 \u2192 add 0 to bills (now bills=0).\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills remains 0.\n\nThus, the total is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 5 \u2192 newNumber is 4 (since 9-5=4 <5, and it's the last digit, so 4 is added. So newNumber is 4. The second program's input is \"4\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=1.\n\ndigits array size 3 (indices 0,1,2).\n\ndigits(0)=4 (since the reversed digit is 4).\n\ndigits(1)=0, digits(2)=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=4 <5 \u2192 add 4 \u2192 bills=4.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills=4.\n\ni=2? No, the loop is up to n=1, so i=0 and 1.\n\nWait, n is 1, so the loop runs i from 0 to 1.\n\nWait, the second part's loop is do i=0, n \u2192 n is 1, so i=0 and 1.\n\nAt i=1:\n\ndigits(1) is 0 \u2192 add 0. So total is 4. So the output is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 9 \u2192 newNumber is 9 (since 9-9=0, but since it's the last digit and 9-9=0, so we add 9 instead of 0. So newNumber is 9. The second program's input is \"9\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=1.\n\ndigits(0)=9 (reversed digit).\n\ndigits(1)=0, digits(2)=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=9 >5 \u2192 else clause.\n\ndigits(1) +=1 \u2192 digits(1) becomes 1.\n\nbills +=1 (10-9=1). bills is now 1.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=1 <5 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=2.\n\nThus, total is 2. Let's see what the second Java program would do.\n\nIn Java:\n\nInput is \"9\".\n\ndigits array is of size 2 (since length is 1 \u2192 1+1=2).\n\ndigits[0] =9, digits[1]=0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 1 (since number.length() is 1).\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 9.\n\nElse clause (digits[i] >5):\n\ndigits[1] +=1 \u2192 becomes 1.\n\nbills +=1 (10-9=1 \u2192 bills=1.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 1.\n\ndigits[1] <5 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total 2. So yes, correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 10 \u2192 newNumber is 10 (since first digit 0 is processed as 0 (since 9-0=9 which is not less than 0 \u2192 so add 0. Then next digit 1: 9-1=8 <1? No, 8>1 \u2192 so add 1. So list is [0,1], newNumber is 0*10^0 +1*10^1 =10.\n\nSecond program's input is \"10\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=2.\n\ndigits array size 4 (indices 0-3).\n\ndigits(0) =0 (reversed first character '0'), digits(1)=1 (reversed second character '1'), digits(2)=0, digits(3)=0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 2 (since n=2).\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits(0)=0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills=0.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits(1)=1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits(2)=0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills=1.\n\nThus, total is 1.\n\nWait, let's see what the second Java program would do.\n\nInput is \"10\".\n\ndigits array is of size 3 (since length is 2 \u2192 2+1=3).\n\ndigits[0] =0 (reversed first character '0'), digits[1]=1 (reversed second character '1'), digits[2]=0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 bills=0.\n\ni=1:\n\ndigits[1] is 1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 bills=1.\n\ni=2:\n\ndigits[2] is 0 \u2192 add 0 \u2192 total 1. So correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer*8 :: x, newNumber\n    character(len=20) :: input_str, newNumberStr\n    integer, parameter :: max_digits = 20\n    integer :: processed_digits(max_digits)\n    integer :: index, i, n, bills\n    integer :: digits(22) ! n can be up to 20, so n+2 is 22\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,'(a)',advance='no') input_str\n    read(input_str,*) x\n\n    ! Process first part\n    index = 0\n    do while (x > 0)\n        integer :: r = mod(x, 10)\n        integer :: processed_r\n        if (9 - r < r) then\n            if (x/10 == 0 .and. (9 - r) == 0) then\n                processed_r = r\n            else\n                processed_r = 9 - r\n            end if\n        else\n            processed_r = r\n        end if\n        processed_digits(index) = processed_r\n        index = index + 1\n        x = x / 10\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute newNumber\n    newNumber = 0\n    do i = 0, index-1\n        newNumber = newNumber + processed_digits(i) * 10**i\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert newNumber to string\n    write(newNumberStr, '(i0)') newNumber\n    newNumberStr = adjustl(newNumberStr)\n    n = len_trim(newNumberStr)\n\n    ! Process second part\n    digits = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        digits(i-1) = ichar(newNumberStr(n - i + 1:n - i + 1)) - ichar('0')\n    end do\n\n    bills = 0\n    do i = 0, n\n        if (digits(i) == 10) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            digits(i) = 0\n        end if\n        if (digits(i) < 5) then\n            bills = bills + digits(i)\n        else if (digits(i) == 5) then\n            if (digits(i+1) >= 5) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            end if\n            bills = bills + 5\n        else\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print*, bills\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the second part's digits array, I set it to 22 elements (since max_digits is 20, so n can be up to 20, so n+2 is 22). That should be sufficient.\n\nTesting the code with the examples above should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The first part's loop may have index exceeding max_digits. But since max_digits is 20, which is more than enough for 64-bit numbers (max 19 digits), it's okay.\n\n- The second part's digits array size is 22, which is sufficient for n up to 20.\n\n- The read statement for input_str uses advance='no' to prevent the next read from skipping a line? Or maybe not necessary. The 'a' format reads until the end of the line, so perhaps it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, using read(*,*) input_str may not read properly if the input has leading or trailing spaces. Using read(*,'(a)') is better.\n\nThe code should work as intended."
