Then, after filling the dp array, the ans is computed by looking at the last row (i = t-2) and for each j, if |j - v2| <= d, then ans is the max between ans and dp[i][j] + v2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that works the same way. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file, codeforces_534_B. It reads four integers: v1, v2, t, d. Then it initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (t-1) x 1150, filled with very negative values. The initial value at dp[0][v1] is set to v1. Then there's a loop that iterates over i from 1 to t-2 (since the loop is up to t-1 but starts at 1?), and for each j and x, it updates dp[i][j] by considering moving x steps forward and backward within the limit d. Finally, it checks the last row (i = t-2) to find the maximum value where j is within d of v2, adding v2 to it. The answer is printed.\n\nThe second Java program, atcoder_ABC051_A, reads a string, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. Wait, but the first program is doing some dynamic programming, and the second is a simple string replacement. But the user says the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second?\n\nWait, but the first program's output is the 'ans' value, which is a number. The second program expects a string input (since it reads a line and processes it). That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user says the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output (the number ans) is the input to the second program. But the second program expects a string (like a line with commas). That would mean that the first program's output is a number, which is then passed as input to the second program, which expects a string. That might not make sense unless the first program's output is a string with commas, but looking at the first program's code, it's printing a number. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the problem again. The user provided two Java programs. The first one is codeforces_534_B, which outputs a number. The second is atcoder_ABC051_A, which reads a line and replaces commas with spaces. So the output of the first program (a number) is the input to the second, which would read that number as a string? But numbers don't have commas. Unless the first program's output is a string with commas. Wait, looking at the first program's code, the output is System.out.println(ans); where ans is a long. So it's a number. So the second program would read that number as a line, which would be just digits, so replacing commas with spaces would do nothing. The output would be the same number as a string. But that seems odd. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the two programs are not supposed to be connected in that way? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second, but in reality, the second program's input is a string with commas. But given the code, maybe the first program's output is a number, and the second program is supposed to process that number as a string? That would be possible if, for example, the first program's output is a string with commas, but in the code provided, it's a number. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup. Alternatively, maybe the two programs are separate and the user wants to chain them, but the actual input and output don't align. But the user says to translate the entire sequence into a single Fortran program that reproduces the same behavior. So I have to take the two Java programs as given, and chain them, even if their inputs/outputs don't align. So the first program's output is a number, which is then the input to the second program, which expects a string. So the second program would read that number as a line, which would be a string like \"1234\", and then replace commas (which aren't there) with spaces, so the output is the same number as a string. So the final output would be the same as the first program's output, but as a string with spaces instead of commas. But since there are no commas, it's the same. So the overall effect is that the first program's output is printed as a string with spaces instead of commas, but since there are no commas, it's just the number as a string. So the final output is the same as the first program's output, but as a string. Wait, but the first program's output is a number, so when you read it as a string, it's just the digits, so replacing commas with spaces does nothing. So the second program's output is the same as the first's output, but as a string. So the final output is the same as the first program's output, but written as a string. But in Fortran, when you print a number, it's written as a string, so maybe the final output is the same as the first program's output. Hmm, but perhaps the second program is supposed to process some other input. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's setup, but I have to proceed as per the given code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Java programs are not meant to be connected, but the user wants to chain them. Wait, the user says \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the first program's output is the input to the second. So the first program's output is a number (the ans), which is then the input to the second program. The second program reads a line (the number as a string), replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. Since the number has no commas, the output is the same as the input. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But then why chain them? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's code examples. Alternatively, perhaps the second program is supposed to process a different input, but the user provided two separate programs. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's setup, but I have to proceed with the given code.\n\nSo, the task is to translate both Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same as the sequence. The first program's output is the input to the second. So in Fortran, the entire process must be done in one program. The first part (the first Java program) must compute the ans, then the second part (the second Java program) must process that ans as a string, replacing commas with spaces, and output the result.\n\nWait, but the first program's output is a number. So when the second program reads it, it's a string like \"1234\", which has no commas, so the output is the same. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the second program's code is doing a replace of commas with spaces, so if the first program's output had commas, then it would change. But in the first program's code, the output is a number, so no commas. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. So the entire sequence's output is the same as the first program's output. But then why chain them? Maybe the user intended that the two programs are separate, but the problem requires to chain them regardless. So I have to proceed.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the ans as per the first Java program, then take that ans as a string, replace commas with spaces, and output that. Wait, but the first program's output is a number. So in Fortran, the first part will compute the ans (the maximum value), then convert it to a string, replace commas with spaces (which does nothing), then output it. So the final output is the same as the first program's output. But the second program's code is doing that. So the Fortran program must do both steps.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program into Fortran. Let's look at the first Java code.\n\nThe first program reads four integers: v1, v2, t, d. Then initializes a 2D array dp of size (t-1) rows and 1150 columns, filled with -1e17. Then dp[0][v1] is set to v1. Then loops over i from 1 to t-2 (since the loop is for i from 1 to t-1-1?), and for each j and x, updates dp[i][j] by considering moving x steps forward and backward. Finally, the maximum ans is computed by checking the last row (i = t-2) and j's within d of v2, adding v2 to dp[i][j].\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be declared with any lower bound. However, in the Java code, the indices start at 0. So in Fortran, perhaps we can use 0-based indices by declaring the arrays with lower bound 0. But Fortran arrays are typically 1-based, so need to be careful.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- v1, v2, t, d are integers.\n\nThe dp array is a 2D array of longs. In Fortran, integers can be 64-bit (selected_int_kind(18)), but need to check. Alternatively, use integer(8) for 64-bit integers.\n\nThe first step is to read the four integers from input. Since in the sequence, the first program reads from stdin, and the second program's input comes from the first's output, but in the Fortran program, all input is read at the beginning, and all output is done at the end. So the Fortran program must read the four integers (v1, v2, t, d) from the input, compute the ans as per the first Java program, then process that ans as a string (as per the second Java program), and output the result.\n\nWait, but the second Java program's input is the output of the first. So in the Fortran program, after computing ans (the first program's output), we need to convert it to a string, replace commas with spaces, then output that string.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read v1, v2, t, d from input.\n\n2. Compute ans as per the first Java program's logic.\n\n3. Convert ans to a string.\n\n4. Replace any commas in the string with spaces.\n\n5. Output the resulting string.\n\nNow, translating the first Java program's logic into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the dp array is a 2D array of size (t-1) rows and 1150 columns. Since in Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions, we can declare it as:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:t-2, 0:1149) :: dp\n\nWait, because in Java, the rows are from 0 to t-2 (since the array is t-1 rows, indices 0 to t-2). Similarly, columns are 0 to 1149 (since 1150 elements). So in Fortran, the array can be declared with lower bounds 0.\n\nBut in Fortran, by default arrays start at 1, so we need to specify the lower bounds. So:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:t-2, 0:1149) :: dp\n\nBut the size of t is variable, so we need to allocate it dynamically. Wait, but in Fortran, you can use allocatable arrays. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_t = some value? Wait, but t can be up to what? The problem's first Java code uses t-1 as the first dimension. Since in the code, the loops go up to t-1, but in the first loop, the rows are from 0 to t-2. So the maximum possible t is not specified, but in the code, the dp array is created with t-1 rows. So in Fortran, we can declare it as an allocatable array.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead v1, v2, t, d.\n\nAllocate dp(0:t-2, 0:1149)\n\nInitialize all elements to -1e17. But in Fortran, how to do that? We can loop through all elements and set them, but that might be slow. Alternatively, use a loop:\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n   do j = 0, 1149\n      dp(i,j) = -1000000000000000000  ! which is -1e18? Wait, the Java code uses -(long)1e17, which is -1e17. Wait, the code says:\n\nIn Java: Arrays.fill(dp[i], -(long)(1e17));\n\nSo each element is set to -1e17. So in Fortran, that's -10000000000000000 (since 1e17 is 10^17). Wait, 1e17 is 10^17, so negative is -10^17. So in Fortran, we can write -10000000000000000 (but as an integer(8)).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can hold that. So:\n\ndp = -10000000000000000  ! but this is a scalar, so to set all elements, need to loop.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop:\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n   do j = 0, 1149\n      dp(i,j) = -10000000000000000\n   end do\nend do\n\nThen set dp(0, v1) = v1.\n\nWait, in Java, dp[0][v1] = v1. So in Fortran, dp(0, v1) = v1.\n\nThen the loops:\n\nThe first loop is for i from 1 to t-2 (since in Java, for (int i=1; i < t-1; i++), which would go up to t-2).\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = 1; i < t-1; i++), so the upper limit is t-2. So in Fortran, the loop would be do i = 1, t-2.\n\nThen for each j from 0 to 1149 (since in Java, for (int j=0; j < 1150; j++)).\n\nThen for each x from 0 to d (inclusive), and then from d down to 0.\n\nWait, the Java code has two loops for x:\n\nFirst loop: for (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) { ... }\n\nInside that, if (j + x < 1150) then dp[i][j] = max(...). Wait, no, the code is:\n\nfor (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) {\n    if (j + x < 1150) dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j + x] + j);\n}\n\nWait, no, the code inside the first loop is:\n\nfor (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) {\n    if (j + x < 1150) dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j + x] + j);\n}\n\nWait, but the code is inside the j loop. So for each j, and x from 0 to d, check if j + x is within the array's column indices (since columns are 0 to 1149). So if j + x < 1150 (since 1150 is the upper limit, so j+x must be less than 1150). So in Fortran, the condition is j + x <= 1149.\n\nWait, in Java, the columns are 0-based up to 1149 (since 1150 elements). So j + x must be less than 1150, so yes.\n\nThen, the code takes the max between the current dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j+x] + j.\n\nWait, the code is:\n\ndp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j + x] + j);\n\nWait, but in the first loop, the x is added to j, so the previous j was j + x? Or is it moving forward?\n\nWait, the first loop is for moving forward? The first loop is for x from 0 to d, and adding x to j. The second loop is for x from d down to 0, subtracting x from j. So perhaps the code is considering moving x steps forward or backward, but in a way that covers all possibilities?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to consider all possible x (from 0 to d) in both directions. Not sure, but the code is as written.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loops would be:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2\n   do j = 0, 1149\n      do x = 0, d\n         if (j + x <= 1149) then\n             if (dp(i,j) < dp(i-1,j+x) + j) then\n                 dp(i,j) = dp(i-1,j+x) + j\n             end if\n         end if\n      end do\n      do x = d, 0, -1\n         if (j - x >= 0) then\n             if (dp(i,j) < dp(i-1,j - x) + j) then\n                 dp(i,j) = dp(i-1,j -x) + j\n             end if\n         end if\n      end do\n   end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in the first loop, the code is taking the max between the current dp[i][j] and the value from the previous row's j+x. So in Fortran, the initial dp[i][j] is set to -1e17, so each iteration may update it to a higher value.\n\nThen, after filling the dp array, the ans is computed by looking at the last row (i = t-2) and for each j, if |j - v2| <= d, then ans is the max between ans and dp[i][j] + v2.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nans = -huge(0_8)  ! Initialize to the smallest possible value.\n\ndo i = t-2, t-2  ! since the loop is for i from t-2 to t-2 (since the original loop was for (int i = t-2; i < t-1; i++), which is just i = t-2)\n    do j = 0, 1149\n        if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n            if (ans < dp(i,j) + v2) then\n                ans = dp(i,j) + v2\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for (int i = t-2; i < t-1; i++), which is just i = t-2. So the loop runs once.\n\nSo after computing ans, we need to process it as per the second Java program.\n\nThe second Java program reads a line, replaces commas with spaces, and outputs it. So in Fortran, we need to take the ans (a number), convert it to a string, replace any commas with spaces, then print it.\n\nIn Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done with write statements. For example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans\nwrite(str_ans, '(I0)') ans\n\nThen, we can loop through each character in the string and replace commas with spaces.\n\nAlternatively, use a function to replace commas. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in replace function, we have to do it manually.\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_ans\ninteger :: i, len_ans\nwrite(str_ans, '(I0)') ans\nlen_ans = len_trim(str_ans)\ndo i = 1, len_ans\n    if (str_ans(i:i) == ',') then\n        str_ans(i:i) = ' '\n    end if\nend do\nprint *, trim(str_ans)\n\nWait, but the original Java code uses a StringBuilder and appends the replaced string. Since the input is a single line, the Fortran code can process the string as above.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will:\n\n1. Read v1, v2, t, d from input.\n\n2. Allocate the dp array.\n\n3. Initialize dp.\n\n4. Fill dp according to the loops.\n\n5. Compute ans.\n\n6. Convert ans to a string, replace commas with spaces.\n\n7. Output the string.\n\nNow, handling the dynamic allocation of the dp array. Since t can be up to some value, but in Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: v1, v2, t, d\n    integer(8) :: ans\n    integer(8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n    character(len=20) :: str_ans\n    integer :: i, j, x, len_ans\n\n    ! Read input\n    read*, v1, v2, t, d\n\n    ! Allocate dp array\n    allocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:1149))\n\n    ! Initialize dp to -1e17\n    dp = -10000000000000000  ! -1e17\n\n    ! Set initial condition\n    dp(0, v1) = v1\n\n    ! Fill dp\n    do i = 1, t-2\n        do j = 0, 1149\n            ! First loop for x from 0 to d\n            do x = 0, d\n                if (j + x <= 1149) then\n                    if (dp(i,j) < dp(i-1,j+x) + j) then\n                        dp(i,j) = dp(i-1,j+x) + j\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n            ! Second loop for x from d down to 0\n            do x = d, 0, -1\n                if (j - x >= 0) then\n                    if (dp(i,j) < dp(i-1,j -x) + j) then\n                        dp(i,j) = dp(i-1,j -x) + j\n                    end if\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute ans\n    ans = -10000000000000000  ! Initialize to -infinity\n    do j = 0, 1149\n        if (abs(j - v2) <= d) then\n            if (ans < dp(t-2,j) + v2) then\n                ans = dp(t-2,j) + v2\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Convert ans to string and replace commas\n    write(str_ans, '(I0)') ans\n    len_ans = len_trim(str_ans)\n    do i = 1, len_ans\n        if (str_ans(i:i) == ',') then\n            str_ans(i:i) = ' '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    print '(A)', trim(str_ans)\n\n    ! Deallocate dp\n    deallocate(dp)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in the loops for filling dp, the order of loops may be important. Let me check the Java code again.\n\nIn the Java code, for each j and x in the first loop (forward direction), and then the second loop (backward). The loops are nested as:\n\nfor each i from 1 to t-2:\n\n    for each j from 0 to 1149:\n\n        for x from 0 to d:\n\n            if (j +x < 1150) then update dp[i][j]\n\n        for x from d downto 0:\n\n            if (j -x >=0) then update dp[i][j]\n\nSo in Fortran, the loops are structured the same way.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the initialization of dp, the code in Java uses Arrays.fill(dp[i], ...), which sets all elements of each row to -1e17. In Fortran, the line dp = -10000000000000000 should set all elements of the array to that value. But in Fortran, when you assign a scalar to an array, it does that. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after allocation, the code does dp = -1e17. That should work.\n\nNow, the ans initialization: in Java, ans is initialized to Long.MIN_VALUE, which is -2^63. But in Fortran, using -1e17 is sufficient as the initial value, since the dp starts with -1e17 and the maximum possible value would be higher. But perhaps better to use the minimum possible value for 64-bit integers. However, in the code, the initial value of dp is -1e17, so the ans can be initialized to that.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the initial ans is Long.MIN_VALUE, which is about -9e18, which is smaller than -1e17. So in Fortran, to replicate that, we can set ans to -1000000000000000000 (which is -1e18). But in the code above, I used -1e17. That might be a problem. Let me check.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nlong ans = Long.MIN_VALUE;\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE is -9223372036854775808 (for 64-bit). So in Fortran, to set ans to that, we can use:\n\nans = -9223372036854775808_8\n\nBut perhaps the code can just use a sufficiently small value, like -1e18. Since the initial dp is set to -1e17, which is larger than Long.MIN_VALUE, but the ans is initialized to the minimum possible, so that the first comparison will take the dp value.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the ans is initialized to Long.MIN_VALUE, which is smaller than the initial dp values (which are -1e17). So in Fortran, to replicate that, the ans should be initialized to a value smaller than -1e17. So perhaps set ans to -1000000000000000000 (i.e., -1e18). So in the code above, the line:\n\nans = -10000000000000000  ! -1e17\n\nshould be changed to:\n\nans = -1000000000000000000_8  ! -1e18\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial dp is set to -1e17, so the first comparison would be between ans (which is -1e18) and dp(t-2,j) + v2. Since dp(t-2,j) could be as low as -1e17, so adding v2 (which is an integer, possibly up to 1149?), so the total could be higher than -1e18. So initializing ans to -1e18 is okay.\n\nSo in the code, the ans initialization line should be:\n\nans = -1000000000000000000_8\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the literal 1000000000000000000 is an integer(8). So:\n\nans = -1000000000000000000_8\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter.\n\nAnother thing: in the loops for filling dp, the code in Java has:\n\nfor (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) { ... }\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is do x = 0, d, which is correct.\n\nNow, the string processing part. The code converts ans to a string, then replaces commas with spaces. Since ans is an integer, when written with '(I0)', it will not have commas. So the replacement does nothing, and the output is the same as the first program's output. But according to the second Java program's code, that's what it does. So the Fortran code is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases: if the ans has a comma in its string representation (unlikely for an integer), but in Fortran, integers don't have commas unless written with a format that includes commas. The '(I0)' format writes the number without commas, so the replacement is a no-op. So the final output is the same as the first program's output.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should work as required."
