    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does and how they are connected.\n\nFirst, looking at the first Java file (atcoder_AGC004_B). It reads input N, x, and a list of N long integers. Then it computes some cost arrays and calculates a result based on those. The output is the minimum value of the result list. The second Java file (atcoder_ABC135_D) reads a string, processes it with a dynamic programming approach, and outputs a number modulo 1e9+7. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the Java programs are executed in sequence, with the output of each being the input to the next. Wait, but looking at the code, the first program's output is the minimum value from its result. The second program's input is a string. So how does the first program's output become the input to the second? That might be a problem. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The user says the output of each is used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But the second program expects a string input. Hmm, that might not align. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the first Java program's output is a single number (the minimum of the result list). The second program's input is a string (since it uses sc.next().toCharArray()). So the first program's output is a number, but the second expects a string. That can't be right. Unless the first program's output is a string, but in the code, it's printing a long, which would be a number. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description? Or maybe the two Java programs are not actually connected? Because the way they are written, the first's output is a number, and the second's input is a string. Unless the second program is supposed to take the first's output as a string input. But that would require the first's output to be a string, but it's a number. Hmm, maybe the user intended that the two programs are separate, but the problem says they are to be executed in sequence with outputs as inputs. That might be a problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the code examples? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are part of a sequence where the first's output is the input to the second. But the second's input is a string, so perhaps the first's output is a string. Wait, looking at the first Java program's output: it's printing the minimum of the result list, which is a long. So the output is a number. The second program's input is a string. So unless the first's output is converted into a string, but that's not part of the code. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup? Or maybe the two programs are not actually connected, and the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does both steps? But the problem says the output of each is used as input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second. But that would require the first's output to be a string, but it's a number. So maybe the second program is not the next in the sequence? Or perhaps the user provided the wrong code examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two Java programs are separate, and the user wants to translate each into Fortran and combine them into a single program that does both steps in sequence, with the first's output being the input to the second. But in that case, the first program's output is a number, which the second program would need to read as a string. But the second program's code expects a string input. So perhaps the second program's input is actually the first's output as a string. For example, if the first program outputs \"5\", then the second program would read \"5\" as the input string. But the second program's code is processing a string of digits, perhaps. Let me look at the second Java program's code again.\n\nThe second program reads a string (char array) and processes it with DP. The DP is for some problem where each character is either a digit or '?', and the problem is to count the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5. The output is the count mod 1e9+7. So the input is a string like \"??5\" or something. \n\nSo if the first program's output is a number, say 123, then the second program would take \"123\" as input. But the first program's output is a single number, so the second program's input is that number as a string. So the first program's output is written to stdout, then the second program reads that as its input. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first compute the first program's result, then use that result as the input to the second program's processing. But in a single Fortran program, so the first part's output is not written to the console but passed directly to the second part's input. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first read the input for the first Java program (N, x, list of N numbers), compute the first part's result (the minimum value), then use that result as the input string for the second part. Wait, but the second part expects a string input. So the first part's output is a number, which must be converted to a string and then passed to the second part's processing. \n\nWait, but the second part's input is a string, so the first part's output (a number) must be converted to a string and then used as the input for the second part. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read the input for the first Java program (N, x, list of N numbers).\n2. Compute the first part's result (the minimum value).\n3. Convert that result to a string (since the second part expects a string input).\n4. Use that string as the input for the second part's processing.\n5. Output the result of the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part's input is a string, so the first part's output (a number) must be converted to a string. For example, if the first part outputs 123, then the second part's input is \"123\".\n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must first process the first part's input, compute the first part's result, then pass that result as a string to the second part's processing. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nFirst, the first part's code:\n\nThe first Java program:\n\nReads N, x, then a list of N longs (srimeList). Then computes costList, which is a 2D array where for each i, costList[i][0] = srimeList[i], and for castNum from 1 to N-1, costList[i][castNum] is the minimum between costList[i][castNum-1] and srimeList[(i - castNum + N) % N]. \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to N-1, compute the sum over all costList[j][i] (since for each row j, the j-th element in the costList's j-th array's i-th position?), wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, in the first Java program's result calculation:\n\nresult.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\nWait, the code says:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    final int j = i;\n    result.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n}\n\nWait, costList is a list of Long arrays. Each costArray is an array of length N. So for each i (the outer loop variable), j is set to i. Then, for each costArray in costList (which is each row of the costList), we take costArray[j], which is the j-th element of that row. So for each row (each element in costList), we take the j-th element (where j is the current i). Then sum all those elements, multiply by x and add i*x? Wait, no, the term is i*x plus the sum. \n\nWait, the sum is over all rows (each row's j-th element, where j is the current i). So for each row (each element in costList), the j-th element (since j is i) is the element at position i in that row. So the sum is the sum of the i-th element of each row. Then, the total is i*x plus that sum. \n\nThe result is a list of these values for each i from 0 to N-1, and the minimum of that list is printed.\n\nSo the first part's output is the minimum of those values.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran:\n\nWe need to read N, x, then the list of N numbers. Then compute the cost array. \n\nThe cost array is a 2D array of size N x N. \n\nInitialize cost(1:N, 1:N). \n\nFirst, for each i from 1 to N (assuming Fortran uses 1-based indices), cost(i,1) = srimeList(i). \n\nThen for castNum from 2 to N:\n\nWait, in Java, the loops are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to adjust indices. Let me think in terms of Fortran arrays (1-based):\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    costList.get(i)[0] = srimeList.get(i);\n    for (int castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++) {\n        costList.get(i)[castNum] = Math.min(\n            costList.get(i)[castNum - 1], \n            srimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N )\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the castNum starts at 1, and goes up to N-1 (since castNum < N). So for each i (row), and for each castNum from 1 to N-1, the value at castNum is the min between the previous castNum-1 and the element at (i - castNum + N) mod N in the srimeList. \n\nWait, the srimeList is 0-based in Java. So in Fortran, if we have an array srime(1:N), then the equivalent would be:\n\nsrimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N ) \n\nIn Java, the index is (i - castNum + N) mod N. Since in Java, the list is 0-based, so the equivalent in Fortran (1-based) would be (i - castNum + N) mod N, but since the array is 1-based, we need to add 1? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in Java, the srimeList is 0-based. So for an index k, the element is srimeList.get(k). In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the same element would be at srime(k+1). Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nSuppose in Java, the list has elements from 0 to N-1. In Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the elements are 1 to N. So to get the same element as srimeList.get(k) in Java, in Fortran it would be srime(k+1). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if in Java, the list is 0-based, then the first element is index 0, which in Fortran would be index 1. So to convert Java's index k to Fortran's index, it's k+1. \n\nTherefore, the expression (i - castNum + N) mod N in Java (0-based) would correspond to (i - castNum + N) mod N, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the equivalent index would be ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) + 1. Wait, but perhaps I should adjust the indices properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use 0-based arrays in Fortran, but Fortran is 1-based by default. Hmm, this could get tricky. Maybe it's better to use 1-based indices in Fortran and adjust the calculations accordingly.\n\nLet me reindex everything to 1-based:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nsrime is an array of size N (indices 1 to N).\n\ncost is a 2D array of size N x N (indices 1 to N, 1 to N).\n\nFor each i from 1 to N:\n\n    cost(i, 1) = srime(i)\n\n    for castNum from 2 to N:\n\n        previous = cost(i, castNum-1)\n\n        other_index = (i - castNum + N) mod N \n\n        Wait, in Java, the original index was (i - castNum + N) % N. Since in Java, the list is 0-based, so in Fortran's 1-based, the equivalent would be (i - castNum + N -1) mod N +1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the original Java code's indices. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, for a given i (0-based), and castNum (starting at 1), the other index is (i - castNum + N) % N. Since the list is 0-based, that gives the correct index. \n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\nother_index = ( (i - castNum) + N ) mod N \n\nWait, but since in Fortran, the array is 1-based, the actual index would be (other_index) +1? No, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nSuppose in Java, the srimeList has elements 0 to N-1. The expression (i - castNum + N) mod N gives a value between 0 and N-1. So in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the equivalent index would be ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me take an example. Suppose N=5, i=0 (Java), castNum=1. Then (0 -1 +5) mod5 =4 \u2192 index 4 in Java (0-based), which is the fifth element in Fortran (1-based). So in Fortran, the index would be 4+1=5. So yes, the formula would be ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 ?\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the original i is 1-based. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the variables to 1-based.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop for i is from 0 to N-1 (0-based). In Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to N. So the Java's i is equivalent to Fortran's i-1. \n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nJava's i \u2192 Fortran's i (Java's i = Fortran's i -1)\n\nJava's castNum starts at 1, same as Fortran.\n\nSo the other index in Java is (i - castNum + N) mod N \u2192 in terms of Fortran's i (Java's i is Fortran's i-1):\n\nJava's i \u2192 Fortran's i-1\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n( (Fortran_i -1 - castNum + N) ) mod N \n\n= (Fortran_i -1 - castNum + N) mod N \n\n= (Fortran_i + (N -1 - castNum) ) mod N \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to just use 1-based indices and adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as (i - castNum + N) mod N, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the index would be ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 ?\n\nWait, let me see with an example:\n\nSuppose N=5, i=1 (Fortran's i=1 corresponds to Java's 0). castNum=1.\n\nThen (1 -1 +5) mod5 =5 mod5=0 \u2192 Java's index 0 \u2192 Fortran's 1. So the formula (i - castNum + N) mod N gives 0, so adding 1 gives 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: i=1 (Java's 0), castNum=2:\n\n(1-2 +5) mod5 =4 mod5=4 \u2192 Java's index 4 \u2192 Fortran's 5. So (4 mod5) \u2192 4 \u2192 +1 \u21925. Correct.\n\nAnother example: i=3 (Java's 2), castNum=2:\n\n(3-2 +5) mod5 =6 mod5=1 \u2192 Java's index 1 \u2192 Fortran's 2. So (1 mod5)+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula in Fortran would be:\n\nother_index = ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 \n\nWait, but mod in Fortran is modulo with a positive result. So (i - castNum + N) mod N would be the same as (i - castNum) mod N, but adding N first to ensure it's positive?\n\nWait, in Fortran, the modulo function can be done with mod(a,b). The mod function in Fortran returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for negative numbers, mod(-1,5) is 4. So perhaps (i - castNum + N) mod N would be the same as (i - castNum) mod N, but adding N first to make sure it's positive?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as (i - castNum + N -1) mod N +1 ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo in Fortran code for the first part:\n\nRead N, x, then the list of N numbers (srime array).\n\nInitialize cost as a 2D array of size N x N.\n\nThen loop over each row i from 1 to N:\n\n    cost(i,1) = srime(i)\n\n    do castNum = 2, N\n\n        previous = cost(i, castNum-1)\n\n        other_index = (i - castNum + N) mod N \n\n        Wait, but in Fortran, mod(a,b) gives a result with the same sign as a. Wait, perhaps better to use modulo function. Alternatively, compute (i - castNum + N) mod N, but since N is positive, adding N first to ensure it's positive.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (i - castNum + N) mod N. Let me see:\n\nSuppose i=1, castNum=2, N=5:\n\n(1-2 +5) mod5 \u21924 mod5=4 \u2192 which is correct (Java's index 4 \u2192 Fortran's 5? Wait, no, in the first example, when i=1 (Java's 0), castNum=1, the other index was 0 \u2192 Fortran's 1. So in this case, (1-1 +5) mod5 =5 mod5=0 \u2192 which is correct. So the formula (i - castNum + N) mod N gives the correct 0-based index in Java, but in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the actual index would be (result +1). Wait, no, because the formula gives the 0-based index in Java, so to get the 1-based index in Fortran, we add 1. \n\nWait, the other index in Java is (i - castNum + N) mod N \u2192 which is a 0-based index. So in Fortran, the equivalent array index is that value +1. \n\nTherefore, the value to take from srime is srime( ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 )\n\nWait, but in the code, the costList's element is set to the minimum between the previous value and the srimeList's element at that index. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncost(i, castNum) = min( cost(i, castNum-1), srime( ( (i - castNum + N) mod N ) +1 ) )\n\nWait, but mod in Fortran may return a negative value if (i - castNum + N) is negative? Let me see:\n\nSuppose i=1, castNum=3, N=5:\n\ni - castNum + N =1-3+5=3 \u2192 mod5 is 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: i=1, castNum=5, N=5:\n\n1-5 +5 =1 \u2192 mod5 is 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: i=2, castNum=3, N=5:\n\n2-3 +5 =4 \u2192 mod5 is4 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but if castNum exceeds i, like i=1, castNum=2, N=2:\n\ni=1, castNum=2 \u2192 1-2 +2 =1 \u2192 mod2 is1 \u2192 which is correct (Java's index 1, which is the second element in 0-based, so in Fortran it's 2. So (1 mod2)+1 \u2192 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the formula (i - castNum + N) mod N gives the correct 0-based index in Java, so adding 1 gives the 1-based index in Fortran. \n\nTherefore, the code for the first part's cost array would be:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    cost(i,1) = srime(i)\n    do castNum = 2, N\n        prev = cost(i, castNum-1)\n        temp = (i - castNum + N) mod N\n        other = temp +1\n        current = srime(other)\n        cost(i, castNum) = min(prev, current)\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. Since N is positive, mod(a,N) will be between 0 and N-1. So the formula (i - castNum + N) mod N is equivalent to (i - castNum) mod N, but adding N first to ensure it's positive? Wait, no, because (i - castNum) could be negative, so adding N before mod N would make it positive. \n\nWait, (i - castNum + N) mod N is the same as (i - castNum) mod N, but since mod in Fortran can handle negative numbers. Let me see:\n\nSuppose i=1, castNum=3, N=2:\n\ni - castNum = -2 \u2192 mod2 would be 0. But (i - castNum + N) mod N \u2192 (-2 +2) mod2 \u21920 mod2=0. So same result. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as mod(i - castNum, N). Let me see:\n\nmod(1-3,2) \u2192 mod(-2,2)=0. Which is correct. \n\nmod(1-2,5)= mod(-1,5)=4 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nSo perhaps the formula can be simplified to mod(i - castNum, N). \n\nWait, but in Fortran, mod(a,b) gives a result with the same sign as b. So mod(-1,5)=4, which is correct. \n\nTherefore, the other index in 0-based Java is mod(i - castNum, N). So in Fortran, the 1-based index is mod(i - castNum, N) +1. \n\nWait, but mod(i - castNum, N) can be negative? Let me see:\n\nmod(1-3,5) \u2192 mod(-2,5)=3 (since -2 = (-1)*5 +3 \u2192 remainder 3). \n\nWait, no, mod(-2,5) in Fortran is 3. So mod(i - castNum, N) gives the correct 0-based index. \n\nTherefore, the formula can be written as:\n\nother = mod(i - castNum, N) +1 \n\nWait, let's test with i=1, castNum=2, N=5:\n\nmod(1-2,5)= mod(-1,5)=4 \u2192 4+1=5 \u2192 which is correct (Java's index 4 \u2192 Fortran's 5).\n\nAnother test: i=3, castNum=2, N=5:\n\nmod(3-2,5)=1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 Java's index 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so this formula works. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n    cost(i,1) = srime(i)\n    do castNum = 2, N\n        prev = cost(i, castNum-1)\n        temp = mod(i - castNum, N)\n        other = temp +1\n        current = srime(other)\n        cost(i, castNum) = min(prev, current)\n    end do\nend do\n\nOkay, that's the cost array setup.\n\nNext, compute the result for each i (from 1 to N):\n\nresult_i = (i-1)*x + sum over all rows j (cost(j, i))\n\nWait, in Java, the loop is for i from 0 to N-1 (0-based). The variable j is set to i (so in Java, j is the same as the loop variable). Then, for each costArray (each row in costList), take costArray[j], which is the j-th element of that row. \n\nIn Fortran, the rows are 1-based. So for each i (Fortran's i is 1-based, corresponding to Java's i+1?), wait no. Let me think:\n\nIn Java, the loop is for (int i =0; i < N; i++) { ... }\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to N. So for each Fortran's i (1-based), the Java's i is (Fortran_i -1). \n\nThe result is computed as:\n\nresult.add(i * x + sum over all rows j (costList[j][i]));\n\nWait, in Java, the costList is a list of arrays. Each row j (0-based) has an array of length N. So for each row j, the element at position i (Java's i) is costList.get(j)[i]. \n\nIn Fortran, the cost array is 1-based, so for row j (1-based), the element at column i (Fortran's i) is cost(j, i). \n\nTherefore, the sum for each i (Fortran's i) is the sum over j from 1 to N of cost(j, i). \n\nThen, the term is (i-1)*x (since Java's i is Fortran's i-1) plus the sum. \n\nWait, in Java, the term is i*x (Java's i is 0-based). So in Fortran, the term is (i-1)*x + sum. \n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nJava's i ranges from 0 to N-1. The term is i*x. \n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable is i from 1 to N. So Java's i is (Fortran_i -1). \n\nThus, the term is (Fortran_i -1)*x + sum. \n\nTherefore, the code for the result array would be:\n\nallocate(result(N))\ndo i =1, N\n    sum_val = 0\n    do j=1, N\n        sum_val = sum_val + cost(j, i)\n    end do\n    result(i) = (i-1)*x + sum_val\nend do\n\nThen, find the minimum value in the result array. \n\nThe minimum can be found by initializing min_val to a large number and looping through the result array. \n\nOnce the minimum is found, that's the first part's output. \n\nNow, the second part's input is this minimum value as a string. \n\nThe second Java program reads a string (char array) and processes it with DP. \n\nThe second part's input is the first part's output (the minimum value) as a string. \n\nTherefore, in the Fortran program, after computing the first part's minimum, we need to convert it to a string, then process it as the input for the second part. \n\nNow, translating the second Java program into Fortran:\n\nThe second program's code:\n\nIt reads a string (char array), then uses DP to compute the number of ways to replace '?' with digits such that the number mod 13 is 5. \n\nThe DP array is a 2D array of size [length][13], where dp[i][pre] represents the number of ways up to the i-th character (from the end) with a remainder of pre. \n\nThe base is 10^i mod13, but computed incrementally. \n\nThe code uses a bottom-up approach. \n\nIn Fortran, the steps would be:\n\nRead the input string (the first part's output as a string). \n\nWait, but in the Fortran program, the first part's output is a number (the minimum value). So we need to convert that number to a string. \n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert a number to a string, we can use write and read. \n\nFor example:\n\ninteger :: min_val\ncharacter(len=20) :: input_str\nwrite(input_str, '(I0)') min_val\ninput_str = trim(adjustl(input_str)) \n\nBut we need to make sure that the string is properly formatted. \n\nOnce we have the input_str, we can process it as the second part's input. \n\nThe second part's processing steps:\n\nThe string is processed in reverse order (since the code uses cs.length -1 -i). \n\nThe DP array is a 2D array of size [length][13], but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. \n\nThe code initializes dp as a 2D array of size [length][13], with all elements 0. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nFor each i from 1 to length (since in Java it's for (int i=0; i < cs.length; ++i)), but in Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to len. \n\nWait, let me re-express the Java code's loops:\n\nJava's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < cs.length; ++i) {\n    ... \n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would be from 1 to len(cs). \n\nThe current character is at position (cs.length -1 -i) in Java. \n\nIn Fortran, the string is stored as a character array, say s(1:len). \n\nSo the current character in the Java code's loop is s(len - i) (since in Java, the index is (cs.length-1 -i)), but in Fortran, the indices are 1-based. \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nJava's code:\n\ncs is a char array of length L. \n\nIn the loop, for i from 0 to L-1:\n\ncurrent_char = cs[ cs.length -1 -i ]\n\nSo for i=0, it's the last character (index L-1 in Java \u2192 first character in reverse). \n\nIn Fortran, the string is s(1:L). \n\nSo for i from 1 to L (Fortran's loop variable), the current character is s(L - (i-1)) \u2192 s(L -i +1). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nJava's i ranges from 0 to L-1. \n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable is i from 1 to L. \n\nJava's i \u2192 Fortran's i-1. \n\nSo the current character in Java is at position (L-1 - (i-1)) \u2192 L -i. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the string in reverse order. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can reverse the string first. \n\nAlternatively, process the characters in reverse order. \n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nThe second part's input is the string s (the first part's output as a string). \n\nWe need to process each character in reverse order. \n\nSo first, reverse the string. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop processes the characters from the end to the start. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can loop from 1 to L, and for each step, take the character at position (L - i +1). \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the string is \"abc\", length 3. \n\nJava's loop for i=0: character at 2 (third character 'c'), i=1: 1 ('b'), i=2:0 ('a'). \n\nIn Fortran, the string is s(1)='a', s(2)='b', s(3)='c'. \n\nTo get the same order, for i from 1 to 3 (Fortran's loop variable), the character is s(3 - (i-1)) \u2192 s(4 -i). \n\nWait, for i=1 \u2192 s(3), i=2 \u2192 s(2), i=3 \u2192 s(1). \n\nYes, so the current character is s(L - i +1). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\ndo i =1, L\n    current_char = s(L -i +1)\n    ...\nend do\n\nNow, the DP array:\n\nIn Java, it's a 2D array of longs, size [cs.length][13]. \n\nIn Fortran, we can use a 2D array of integers (or integers with modulo operations). Since the numbers can be large, but modulo 1e9+7 is applied, we can use integers (but in Fortran, integers can be 32 or 64 bits. Since 1e9+7 is about 1e9, which is within 32-bit integer (max ~2e9). So using integer*8 (8-byte integers) would be better. \n\nThe DP array can be declared as:\n\ninteger*8, dimension(0:L, 0:12) :: dp \n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. To make it 0-based, we can declare with lower bounds. \n\nAlternatively, use 1-based indices. \n\nWait, in Java, the DP array is [i][pre], where i ranges from 0 to L-1 (0-based), and pre from 0 to 12. \n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can use 1-based for the first dimension (i from 1 to L), and 0-based for the second (pre from 0 to 12). \n\nAlternatively, adjust indices. \n\nLet me think:\n\nIn Fortran, the DP array can be declared as:\n\ninteger*8, dimension(L, 13) :: dp \n\nwhere dp(i, pre) corresponds to Java's dp[i-1][pre]. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nThe code's steps:\n\nInitialize dp(1 to L, 1 to 13) to 0. \n\nWait, in Java, the DP is initialized to 0 each time. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to L (Fortran's loop variable):\n\ncurrent_char is s(L -i +1). \n\nIf current_char is '?', then for each pre in 0..12:\n\n    for next_digit in 0..9:\n\n        new_pre = (base * next_digit + pre) mod13 \n\n        dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n        mod by MOD. \n\nWait, but in Java, the code uses:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n\n        dp[i][ (base*next + pre) %13 ] += (i>1 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1:0) )\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the Java code's code for the '?' case is:\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n\n        int new_pre = (base * next + pre) %13 \n\n        dp[i][new_pre] += dp[i-1][pre]\n\n        mod MOD \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, the code is:\n\nfor (int pre =0; pre <13; pre++) {\n\n    for (int next=0; next <10; next++) {\n\n        dp[i][new_pre] += ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the current dp[i][new_pre] is being added to. \n\nWait, the code in Java for the '?' case is:\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n\n    for (int next = 0; next < 10; ++next) {\n\n        int new_pre = (base * next + pre) % 13;\n\n        dp[i][new_pre] += (i > 0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0));\n\n        dp[i][new_pre] %= MOD;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code in the Java program for the '?' case is:\n\nfor (int pre = 0; pre < 13; ++pre) {\n\n    for (int next = 0; next < 10; ++next) {\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] += (i > 0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre ==0 ?1 :0));\n\n        dp[i][(base * next + pre) % 13] %= MOD;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, the current dp[i][...] is being updated by adding the previous value. \n\nWait, but in Java, the code is overwriting the dp[i] array each time. So for each i, the dp[i] array is initialized to 0, and then for each pre and next, the contribution is added. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the dp array is initialized each time? Or is it being built incrementally? \n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nThe dp array is initialized as new long[cs.length][13]. \n\nThen, for each i, the code loops over pre and next, and adds to dp[i][new_pre]. \n\nTherefore, for each i, the dp[i] array is being built based on dp[i-1]. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the DP array can be represented as a 2D array where for each step i, we compute the current row based on the previous row. \n\nTo optimize memory, perhaps we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current. \n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with a 2D array. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe DP array is dimensioned as (L+1, 13), since in Java it's 0-based up to L-1. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use 1-based indices for i from 1 to L. \n\nInitialize dp(1, :) to 0 except for dp(1,0) which is 1 when the first character is processed. \n\nWait, let me think step by step:\n\nInitialize dp(1, :) = 0 \n\nWait, no. Let me see the Java code's initial conditions. \n\nIn Java, for i=0 (the first character in reverse order), the code is:\n\nif the character is '?', then for each pre and next digit, etc. \n\nWait, the initial condition is when i=0 (Java's first iteration), which corresponds to the first character in the reversed string. \n\nWait, the base starts at 1. \n\nThe code's base is initialized to 1. \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to L-1 (Java's loop):\n\n    if the current character is '?', then:\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            for next in 0..9:\n\n                new_pre = (base * next + pre) mod13 \n\n                dp[i][new_pre] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n    else:\n\n        next is fixed (the character's digit)\n\n        for each pre in 0..12:\n\n            new_pre = (base * next + pre) mod13 \n\n            dp[i][new_pre] += (i>0 ? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ?1 :0))\n\n    then mod by MOD \n\n    base = base *10 mod13 \n\nWait, the base is updated after each step. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nThe base is multiplied by 10 mod13 each step. \n\nThe base is used in the calculation of new_pre. \n\nThe DP transitions depend on the previous row (i-1). \n\nIn Fortran, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize the DP array. \n\nSet dp(1, :) = 0 \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to L:\n\n    current_char = s(L -i +1)\n\n    if current_char == '?' then:\n\n        do pre =0, 12\n\n            do next_digit =0,9\n\n                new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n            end do\n\n        end do\n\n    else:\n\n        next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the initial condition for dp(1, pre) when i=1 (Java's i=0):\n\nWhen i=1 (Fortran's first iteration), the previous is i-1=0. \n\nIn Java, for i=0 (the first step), the previous is i-1 = -1, but the code uses (i>0 ? ... : ...). \n\nWait, in the Java code, for the first iteration (i=0), the term is (pre ==0 ?1 :0). \n\nSo in Fortran, when i=1 (Java's i=0), the previous is i-1=0, which is not part of the array. \n\nTherefore, the initial condition for dp(0, pre) is needed. \n\nPerhaps we can have a previous array and current array. \n\nAlternatively, use a 2D array with an extra row for i=0. \n\nLet me adjust the indices:\n\nLet's make the DP array have dimensions (0:L, 0:12). \n\nInitialize dp(0,0) =1, and dp(0,1:12)=0. \n\nThen, for each i from 1 to L:\n\n    current_char = s(L -i +1)\n\n    if current_char == '?' then:\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            do next_digit=0,9\n\n                new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n            end do\n\n        end do\n\n    else:\n\n        next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        do pre=0,12\n\n            new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in this setup, the initial dp(0,0)=1, others 0. \n\nThen, for i=1 (first step), the previous is dp(0, pre). \n\nThis way, the code can handle the initial condition. \n\nTherefore, the DP array is declared as:\n\ninteger*8, dimension(0:L, 0:12) :: dp \n\nInitialize dp(0,:) =0 \n\ndp(0,0) =1 \n\nThen, the loop starts from i=1 to L. \n\nThe base starts at 1. \n\nWait, the base is initialized to 1 before the loop. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead the string s (the first part's output as a string). \n\nL = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate(dp(0:L, 0:12))\n\ndp = 0 \n\ndp(0,0) =1 \n\nbase =1 \n\ndo i=1, L\n\n    current_char = s(L -i +1)\n\n    if (current_char == '?') then\n\n        do pre=0,12\n\n            do next_digit=0,9\n\n                new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n                dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n            end do\n\n        end do\n\n    else\n\n        next_digit = ichar(current_char) - ichar('0')\n\n        do pre=0,12\n\n            new_pre = mod( base * next_digit + pre, 13 )\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = dp(i, new_pre) + dp(i-1, pre)\n\n            dp(i, new_pre) = mod( dp(i, new_pre), MOD )\n\n        end do\n\n    end if\n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do\n\nThe result is dp(L,5). \n\nWait, in Java, the final result is dp[cs.length-1][5], but in Fortran's indices, since the loop goes up to L, the final i is L, so dp(L,5). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is dp(L,5). \n\nPutting it all together, the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N, x, and the list of N numbers (srime array).\n\n2. Compute the first part's minimum value.\n\n3. Convert that minimum to a string.\n\n4. Process that string with the second part's DP algorithm.\n\n5. Output the result of the second part. \n\nNow, handling the string conversion in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing the minimum value (min_val), we need to convert it to a string. \n\nIn Fortran, this can be done with an internal write statement:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\nwrite(str_min, '(I0)') min_val\nstr_min = adjustl(str_min) \n\nThen, the length is len_trim(str_min). \n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe Fortran program will have:\n\n- Read N, x, and the list of N numbers.\n\n- Compute the first part's minimum.\n\n- Convert to string.\n\n- Process the string with the second part's DP.\n\n- Output the result. \n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\ninteger :: N, x, i, j, castNum, other, temp, min_val, L\ninteger*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\ninteger, allocatable :: srime(:)\ninteger*8, allocatable :: cost(:,:), result(:)\ncharacter(len=20) :: str_min\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\ninteger*8, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\ninteger :: base, next_digit, new_pre, pre\n\nBut need to structure properly. \n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, x, i, j, castNum, other, temp, min_val, L\n    integer*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\n    integer, allocatable :: srime(:)\n    integer*8, allocatable :: cost(:,:), result(:)\n    character(len=20) :: str_min\n    character(len=20) :: s\n    integer*8, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n    integer :: base, next_digit, new_pre, pre\n\n    !

The srime list in Java is a list of Longs, so in Fortran, the srime array should be integer*8. \n\nSo I need to adjust the variables:\n\ninteger*8, allocatable :: srime(:)\ninteger*8, allocatable :: cost(:,:), result(:)\n\nAlso, in the first part's loops:\n\ncost(i,1) = srime(i)\n\nBut in the code above, the srime array is integer*8, so that's okay. \n\nAlso, in the first part's cost array, the min function is for integers. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the min function for integers is okay. \n\nAnother thing: in the first part's cost array, the loop for castNum from 2 to N:\n\nThe code uses:\n\ncost(i, castNum) = min( cost(i, castNum-1), srime(other) )\n\nBut in Fortran, the min function for two integers is okay. \n\nNow, testing for possible errors:\n\nIn the first part's cost array initialization:\n\nallocate(cost(N,N))\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are initialized to 0, but in the code, we set cost(i,1) first. \n\nYes, so that's okay. \n\nThe result array is initialized by (i-1)*x plus the sum. \n\nThe sum is computed correctly. \n\nThe minimum is found correctly. \n\nThe string conversion should work. \n\nIn the second part's DP:\n\nThe DP array is initialized to 0 except dp(0,0)=1. \n\nThe loops for pre and next_digit are correct. \n\nThe base is updated correctly. \n\nThe final result is dp(L,5). \n\nTherefore, this should work. \n\nNow, let me check for possible off-by-one errors. \n\nIn the first part's cost array:\n\nThe other index calculation:\n\nother = mod(i - castNum, N) +1 \n\nYes, as discussed earlier. \n\nIn the first part's result computation:\n\nresult(i) = (i-1)*x + sum over j=1 to N of cost(j,i). \n\nYes. \n\nThe minimum is found correctly. \n\nThe string conversion:\n\nwrite(str_min, '(I0)') min_val \u2192 this should write the number as a string without leading spaces. \n\nadjustl(str_min) trims leading spaces. \n\nThen s is assigned to str_min, and L is len_trim(s). \n\nIn the second part's loop over i from 1 to L:\n\ncurrent_char is s(L -i +1). \n\nYes, which gives the characters in reverse order. \n\nThe DP transitions are correct. \n\nTherefore, this should be the correct Fortran code."
