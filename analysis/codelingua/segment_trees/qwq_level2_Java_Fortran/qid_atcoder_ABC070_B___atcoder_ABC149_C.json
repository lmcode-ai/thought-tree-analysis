    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC070_B) reads four integers a, b, c, d. Then it checks some conditions and prints a number based on those. The second Java file (atcoder_ABC149_C) reads an integer x, then finds the next prime number greater than or equal to x, but with some conditions. Wait, actually, looking at the code for the second one: it starts by checking if x is not 2 and even, then increments x to the next odd. Then it loops, checking if x is prime. If not, adds 2 and repeats. So the second program finds the next prime number >= x, but if x is 2, it stays as 2. \n\nThe key is that the output of the first Java program is the input to the second. So the first program's output is an integer, which is then the input x for the second program. The final Fortran program must read the initial input (the four integers a, b, c, d), process them through the first logic, then take that result and process it through the second logic, then output the final result.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to:\n\n1. Read a, b, c, d from input.\n2. Compute the first result (let's call it first_result) using the first program's logic.\n3. Then use first_result as the input x for the second program's logic, compute the second result (second_result).\n4. Output second_result.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nStarting with the first part (the first Java program's logic):\n\nThe first program's logic is:\n\nif c > b \u2192 output 0\nelse if a > d \u2192 0\nelse if a < c \u2192 min(b,d) - c\nelse:\n   sort the four numbers and take the third minus second (since sorted list l has four elements, l.get(2) - l.get(1) in Java is l(3) - l(2) in Fortran since arrays are 1-based)\n\nWait, in Java, the list is [a, b, c, d], then sorted. So after sorting, the elements are in order. The third element (index 2 in Java) minus the second (index 1). Wait, no, the code adds all four into the list, sorts, then gets the second and first elements? Wait, no, the code says l.get(2) - l.get(1). Wait, in Java, the list after sorting would be in order from smallest to largest. The four elements are sorted, so l.get(0) is the smallest, l.get(1) next, l.get(2) next, l.get(3) largest. So the code in the else clause is taking the third element (index 2) minus the second (index 1). Wait, no, the code says l.get(2) - l.get(1). Wait, that would be the third minus the second element. Wait, but in the else clause, the condition is when a is not less than c. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first condition is if (c > b) \u2192 0. Else if (a > d) \u2192 0. Else if (a < c) \u2192 min(b,d) - c. Else, the else clause. So in the else clause, when a is >= c, and a <= d (since a > d would have been caught in the second condition). Hmm, perhaps the else clause is when a is between c and d? Not sure, but the code in the else clause is to sort the four numbers and take the third minus the second. So in Fortran, the list would be sorted, and the third element minus the second (since in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so l(3) - l(2)).\n\nSo the first part's logic can be translated into Fortran variables. Let me code that.\n\nNow the second part: the second Java program's logic. Let's see:\n\nThe second program takes x as input. Then:\n\nif x is not 2 and even \u2192 x becomes x+1 (so it's odd). Then, loop:\n\nCheck if x is prime. To check, compute sqrt(x), then check divisors from 3 to sqrt(x) step 2. If any divides x, then break and increment x by 2, else, if no divisors found, break and return x.\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nThe loop is while true. Inside, compute sqrtNum = sqrt(x). Then for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2. For each i, check if x mod i is 0. If yes, break. After the loop over i, if i > sqrtNum \u2192 meaning that the loop didn't break, so x is prime. Then break the while loop. Else, x +=2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nStart with x. If x is even and not 2, set x to x+1 (so it's odd). Then, in the loop:\n\nCheck if x is prime. To check, for i from 3 to sqrt(x), step 2. If any i divides x, then break, and x +=2. Else, if after all i up to sqrt(x) didn't divide x, then x is prime, so break the loop and output x.\n\nWait, the code's for loop starts at i=3, increments by 2 each time (so checking only odd divisors). The loop runs until i exceeds sqrt(x). If during the loop, any i divides x, then the break exits the for loop, and then the code checks if i > sqrt(x). Since the loop was broken early, i would be at the next step. Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose in the for loop, for i from 3 to sqrtNum (which is sqrt(x)), step 2. So the loop runs i=3,5,... up to sqrtNum. If during any iteration, x mod i ==0 \u2192 break. Then, after the for loop, the code checks if i > sqrtNum. If yes, then the loop completed without finding a divisor, so x is prime. Else, it means that the loop broke early (because a divisor was found), so x is not prime, so we need to increment x by 2 and repeat.\n\nWait, the code's logic after the for loop is:\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 break the while loop (so done), else, x +=2 and loop again.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nInside the while loop:\n\n- compute sqrtNum = sqrt(x)\n- for i from 3 to sqrtNum step 2:\n   if x mod i ==0 \u2192 break\n- after the for loop, check if i > sqrtNum \u2192 if yes, break the while loop (so x is prime)\n- else, x +=2 and loop again.\n\nWait, but how does the for loop's i get to be greater than sqrtNum? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the for loop runs until i reaches sqrtNum. The loop's condition is i <= sqrtNum. So when i exceeds sqrtNum, the loop stops. So after the loop, i would be sqrtNum +2 (since it increments by 2 each step). Wait, no. Let's think of an example. Suppose sqrtNum is 5. The loop runs i=3,5. Then after the loop, i becomes 7 (since after the last iteration, i is 5, then i +=2 \u2192 7, but the loop condition is i <=5, so the loop stops. So the next value of i is 7, but the loop has ended. So after the loop, i is 7, which is greater than sqrtNum (5). So in that case, the condition i>sqrtNum is true, so x is prime.\n\nAlternatively, if during the loop, a divisor is found (x mod i ==0), then the for loop breaks. So the i at that point is the first divisor found. So after breaking, the i is still that value. For example, if x is 9, sqrt is 3. So i starts at 3. 9 mod 3 is 0 \u2192 break. Then, after the for loop, i is 3. sqrtNum is 3. So i is not greater than sqrtNum (3 is not >3). So the code proceeds to x +=2 (so x becomes 11), and loops again.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct for checking primes.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the first part's logic in Fortran:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCompute first_result based on conditions.\n\nThen, take first_result as x, and compute the second_result using the second program's logic.\n\nNow, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Let's see:\n\nFirst part variables: a, b, c, d are integers. The first_result is also an integer.\n\nSecond part variables: x (the first_result), then the code to find the next prime.\n\nNow, the second part's algorithm in Fortran:\n\nFunction to check if a number is prime? Or implement the same loop as in Java.\n\nAlternatively, code the same logic as in Java.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the second part in Fortran:\n\nInitialize x as first_result.\n\nIf x is not 2 and even \u2192 x = x +1.\n\nThen loop:\n\n   compute sqrt_x = sqrt(x)\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) == 0) then\n\n          is_prime = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n       exit the loop \u2192 done, x is the answer.\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n       repeat the loop.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop is a while(true) loop. So in Fortran, perhaps a do-while loop? Or a loop that continues until a condition is met.\n\nAlternatively, code it as:\n\ndo\n\n   compute sqrt_x = sqrt(x)\n\n   flag = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n          flag = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the initial check for evenness:\n\nFirst, if x is 2 \u2192 leave as is.\n\nElse if x is even (and not 2) \u2192 set x to x+1 (so it's odd).\n\nWait, the code in Java:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\nThen, proceed with the loop.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCompute first_result based on the first Java's logic.\n\nThen compute second_result using the second Java's logic on first_result.\n\nThen print second_result.\n\nNow, let's code the first part's logic.\n\nFirst, variables a, b, c, d are integers. Let's declare them.\n\nThen compute first_result:\n\nif (c > b) then\n\n   first_result = 0\n\nelse if (a > d) then\n\n   first_result =0\n\nelse if (a < c) then\n\n   first_result = min(b, d) - c\n\nelse\n\n   create a list of the four numbers, sort them, then take the third minus second.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to sort four numbers, perhaps we can do it manually.\n\nThe four numbers are a, b, c, d. Let's make an array:\n\ninteger :: list(4)\n\nlist = [a, b, c, d]\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nthen first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort function may not be straightforward. We can write a simple sort for four elements.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function. Wait, Fortran has the 'sort' intrinsic in Fortran 90 and later. So:\n\nlist = [a, b, c, d]\n\ncall merge_sort(list) \u2192 but I think the standard is to use the intrinsic function. Wait, in Fortran, you can use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or perhaps use the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check.\n\nActually, in Fortran, the sort function is part of the standard. For an array, you can use the 'sort' intrinsic. For example:\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nBut I need to confirm. Alternatively, use the 'merge_sort' function. Wait, perhaps the best way is to sort the array manually for four elements.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function. Let me see:\n\nIn Fortran 90, the sort function is available via the generic procedure. So:\n\nlist = [a, b, c, d]\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the array is properly sorted. Let me proceed with that.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort is in ascending order. So after sorting, list(1) is the smallest, list(4) the largest. So the third element (list(3)) minus the second (list(2)) is the required value.\n\nSo the else clause gives first_result = list(3) - list(2).\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst part code:\n\nread(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\nif (c > b) then\n\n   first_result = 0\n\nelse if (a > d) then\n\n   first_result =0\n\nelse if (a < c) then\n\n   first_result = min(b, d) - c\n\nelse\n\n   list = [a, b, c, d]\n\n   call sort(list)\n\n   first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the array assignment and sort may need explicit declarations. Let me structure this properly.\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, first_result, x, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: list\n\nThen:\n\nread(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\nif (c > b) then\n\n   first_result = 0\n\nelse if (a > d) then\n\n   first_result =0\n\nelse if (a < c) then\n\n   first_result = min(b, d) - c\n\nelse\n\n   list = [a, b, c, d]\n\n   call sort(list)\n\n   first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nend if\n\nNow, moving to the second part.\n\nSet x = first_result.\n\nThen process x through the second logic.\n\nFirst, check if x is even and not 2 \u2192 increment by 1.\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\nThen loop:\n\ndo\n\n   sqrt_x = sqrt(real(x))  ! Need to cast to real to compute sqrt.\n\n   sqrt_x = floor(sqrt_x + 1e-8)  ! To handle possible floating point inaccuracies.\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n          is_prime = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop structure is a bit different. Let me structure this properly.\n\nWait, the loop is a do-while kind of loop, but in Fortran, you can use a do loop with an exit condition.\n\nAlternatively, use a do loop that continues until the condition is met.\n\nWait, the code in Java is a while(true) loop, so in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo\n\n   compute sqrt_x.\n\n   check for divisors.\n\n   if prime \u2192 exit loop.\n\n   else \u2192 x +=2.\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut how to compute sqrt_x as an integer?\n\nWait, in the Java code, sqrtNum is a double, but the loop runs up to i <= sqrtNum. So in Fortran, sqrt_x can be computed as the integer part of the square root.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x))) \n\nBut to get the ceiling? Or floor?\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses Math.sqrt(x), which returns a double. The loop runs i from 3 to sqrtNum (the double), but since i is an integer, the loop will run up to floor(sqrtNum). Because in Java, the for loop's upper limit is an integer (since i is an int). So in Fortran, we can compute sqrt_x as the integer part of sqrt(x).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x is 25 \u2192 sqrt is 5 \u2192 loop up to 5.\n\nx=26 \u2192 sqrt is ~5.099 \u2192 floor is 5 \u2192 loop up to 5.\n\nSo in Fortran, sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x))) \n\nBut to ensure that we cover all possible divisors up to sqrt(x), perhaps adding 1? Or maybe not necessary. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt_x as the integer part, then the loop runs up to sqrt_x.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2). Since sqrtNum is a double, but i is an integer, so the loop runs while i is <= sqrtNum. So the maximum i is floor(sqrtNum). So in Fortran, using int(sqrt(real(x))) is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\nThen, the loop from 3 to sqrt_x, step 2.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\nis_prime = .true.\n\ndo i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n   if (mod(x, i) == 0) then\n\n       is_prime = .false.\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (is_prime) then\n\n   exit\n\nelse\n\n   x = x +2\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the loop is the outer do loop. So the code structure is:\n\ndo\n\n   compute sqrt_x.\n\n   check divisors.\n\n   if prime \u2192 exit.\n\n   else \u2192 x +=2.\n\nend do\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, putting all together into a single Fortran program.\n\nThe variables:\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, first_result, x, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: list\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\ninteger :: sqrt_x, i\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCompute first_result.\n\nSet x = first_result.\n\nThen process x through the second logic.\n\nWait, but the second logic's result is the final output. So after processing, x will be the second_result, so we can just print x.\n\nWait, yes. Because after the loop, x is the next prime, so the second_result is x. So the final output is x.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, first_result, x, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: list\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\ninteger :: sqrt_x, i\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\n! Compute first_result\n\nif (c > b) then\n\n   first_result = 0\n\nelse if (a > d) then\n\n   first_result =0\n\nelse if (a < c) then\n\n   first_result = min(b, d) - c\n\nelse\n\n   list = [a, b, c, d]\n\n   call sort(list)\n\n   first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nend if\n\n! Now process first_result through second logic\n\nx = first_result\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n          is_prime = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output the result\n\nwrite(*,*) x\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but there's a problem here. The sort function in Fortran may not be available unless we use a specific method. Because the standard sort function in Fortran is part of the intrinsic, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the sort function is part of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or is it an intrinsic procedure?\n\nActually, in Fortran 90 and later, the sort function is an intrinsic. Wait, no, the sort is part of the generic procedures. Wait, perhaps I need to use the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check.\n\nWait, the correct way to sort an array in Fortran is to use the 'sort' intrinsic function. For example:\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the array is properly declared. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the 'merge_sort' function, but that's not standard. Alternatively, write a simple sort for four elements.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic function. Let me try to code it as:\n\nlist = [a, b, c, d]\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nBut in Fortran, the sort function is part of the intrinsic procedures. Wait, perhaps the correct syntax is:\n\ncall sort(list)\n\nYes, according to Fortran standards, the sort function is an intrinsic. So that should work.\n\nWait, but in some compilers, you might need to include a module, but in standard Fortran 90/95, it's available.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe, perhaps use a bubble sort for four elements. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me code the sort manually for four elements. Since it's only four elements, it's manageable.\n\nThe list has four elements. To sort them in ascending order.\n\nWe can do this with a simple selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to sort four elements:\n\nlist = [a, b, c, d]\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n\n   do j = i+1,4\n\n      if (list(i) > list(j)) then\n\n          temp = list(i)\n\n          list(i) = list(j)\n\n          list(j) = temp\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThis is a simple bubble sort for four elements. That way, we don't have to rely on the sort intrinsic.\n\nSo replacing the sort call with this code.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nelse\n\n   list = [a, b, c, d]\n\n   ! Sort the list in ascending order\n\n   do i = 1, 3\n\n      do j = i+1,4\n\n         if (list(i) > list(j)) then\n\n             temp = list(i)\n\n             list(i) = list(j)\n\n             list(j) = temp\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nend if\n\nWe need to declare temp as an integer.\n\nAdding integer :: temp to the variable declarations.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, first_result, x, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: list\n\ninteger :: temp\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\ninteger :: sqrt_x, i\n\nNow, that should work.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the first part's else clause, when a is not less than c, but a could be equal to c. The condition a < c is checked in the else if, so the else clause is when a >= c.\n\nNow, the code for the second part's loop.\n\nWait, in the code for the second part, after the initial check for evenness, the loop starts. Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose first_result is 7 (so x starts as 7). Since 7 is odd and not 2, the initial check does nothing. Then, in the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = sqrt(7) ~2.645 \u2192 int(2.645) is 2. So the loop from 3 to 2 \u2192 which doesn't run. So the do loop for i=3 to 2 is not executed. So is_prime remains true. So the loop exits, and x remains 7, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: x=9. After initial check (9 is odd, so no change). sqrt_x is 3. The loop runs i=3. 9 mod 3 is 0 \u2192 is_prime becomes false. So x becomes 11. Then loop again.\n\nsqrt(11) is ~3.316 \u2192 int is 3. So i=3. 11 mod3 is 2 \u2192 no division. So the loop runs i=3, which doesn't divide 11. So after the loop, is_prime is true \u2192 exit. So x=11 is correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=2. The initial check: x is 2 \u2192 no change. Then loop:\n\nsqrt_x is 1.414 \u2192 int(1). So the loop from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. So is_prime is true \u2192 exit. So x remains 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: x=4. The initial check: x is even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 5. Then loop:\n\nsqrt(5) is ~2.236 \u2192 int(2). So loop from 3 to 2 \u2192 no iterations. So is_prime is true \u2192 x=5 is correct.\n\nAnother case: x=6 \u2192 initial check: even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 7. Then as before, 7 is prime.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, putting all together into the Fortran program.\n\nWait, also, in the first part's else clause, the code is list(3) - list(2). Since the list is sorted, list(1) is the smallest, list(4) the largest. The third element minus the second is the difference between the second and third elements in the sorted list. Wait, no, list(3) - list(2) is the third minus the second. For example, if the sorted list is [1,2,3,4], then list(3) is 3, list(2) is 2 \u2192 difference 1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the final code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, first_result, x, second_result\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: list\n\ninteger :: temp\n\nlogical :: is_prime\n\ninteger :: sqrt_x, i\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\n! Compute first_result\n\nif (c > b) then\n\n   first_result = 0\n\nelse if (a > d) then\n\n   first_result =0\n\nelse if (a < c) then\n\n   first_result = min(b, d) - c\n\nelse\n\n   list = [a, b, c, d]\n\n   ! Sort the list in ascending order using bubble sort\n\n   do i = 1, 3\n\n      do j = i+1,4\n\n         if (list(i) > list(j)) then\n\n             temp = list(i)\n\n             list(i) = list(j)\n\n             list(j) = temp\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   first_result = list(3) - list(2)\n\nend if\n\n! Now process first_result through second logic\n\nx = first_result\n\nif (x /=2 .and. mod(x,2) ==0) then\n\n   x = x +1\n\nend if\n\ndo\n\n   sqrt_x = int(sqrt(real(x)))\n\n   is_prime = .true.\n\n   do i = 3, sqrt_x, 2\n\n      if (mod(x, i) ==0) then\n\n          is_prime = .false.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (is_prime) then\n\n       exit\n\n   else\n\n       x = x +2\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output the result\n\nwrite(*,*) x\n\nend program main\n\nHmm, but in the first part's else clause, when a is equal to c, then the code proceeds to sort. That's okay.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when a = c and d is between a and b. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a=5, b=10, c=5, d=8. Then the else clause is entered. The list is [5,10,5,8]. After sorting, it becomes [5,5,8,10]. So list(3) is 8, list(2) is 5 \u2192 8-5=3. So first_result is 3. Then the second part processes 3. Since 3 is odd and not 2, check if it's prime. sqrt(3) is ~1.732 \u2192 int(1). So the loop from 3 to 1 doesn't run. So is_prime is true \u2192 x remains 3. So output is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case for first part:\n\nCase where a=2, b=5, c=3, d=4.\n\nConditions:\n\nc (3) is not > b (5). a (2) is not > d (4). a (2) is < c (3). So enter the else if clause.\n\nmin(b,d) is min(5,4)=4. So first_result = 4 -3 =1.\n\nThen the second part processes x=1. Let's see:\n\nx=1. The initial check: x is not 2 and even? 1 is odd, so no change. Then enter the loop.\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. So the loop from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. So is_prime is true. But wait, 1 is not a prime. Oh, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the code in the second Java program would have a problem here. Because when x is 1, the code would proceed as follows:\n\nx=1. The initial check: x is not 2 and even? 1 is odd \u2192 no change. Then the loop:\n\nsqrt(1) is 1. The for loop starts at i=3, but 3>1 \u2192 loop doesn't run. So is_prime is true \u2192 so the code would output 1, but 1 is not a prime. So the code in Java is incorrect?\n\nWait, looking back at the second Java program's code:\n\nThe code for the second program:\n\nif (x !=2 && x%2 ==0) x++;\n\nThen the loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   int i;\n\n   double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\n   for (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n      if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n   }\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break;\n\n   x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, when x is 1:\n\nsqrtNum is 1.0. The for loop starts at i=3, which is greater than sqrtNum (1.0). So the loop doesn't run. So i remains 3? Or is i initialized to 3 before the loop?\n\nWait, in Java, the variable i is declared inside the loop. Let me recheck the code:\n\nThe code inside the while loop:\n\nint i;\n\ndouble sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(x);\n\nfor (i=3; i <= sqrtNum; i +=2) {\n\n   if (x%i ==0) break;\n\n}\n\nSo when x is 1, sqrtNum is 1.0. The for loop's condition is i <=1.0. The initial i is 3. So the loop doesn't execute. So after the for loop, i is 3. Then the code checks if i>sqrtNum (3>1 \u2192 yes). So the condition is true \u2192 break the while loop. So x=1 is considered prime, but 1 is not a prime. So the code is incorrect for x=1.\n\nHmm, so the second Java program has a bug when x is 1. Because 1 is not a prime, but the code would output 1 as a prime.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, perhaps the input x is such that the code works correctly. But in any case, the Fortran code must replicate the Java code's behavior, even if it's incorrect.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, when x is 1, the code would proceed as follows:\n\nx=1.\n\nInitial check: x is not 2 and even? 1 is odd \u2192 no change.\n\nThen enter the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = int(sqrt(1.0)) \u2192 1.\n\nis_prime = .true.\n\nloop from i=3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. So is_prime remains true \u2192 exit loop. So x=1 is output, which is incorrect, but that's what the Java code does. So the Fortran code must replicate that.\n\nSo the code is correct in replicating the Java's behavior, even if it's wrong for x=1.\n\nAnother test case: x=2.\n\nThe code would set x=2 (since it's 2). Then in the loop:\n\nsqrt_x = 1.414 \u2192 int(1). The loop from 3 to 1 \u2192 no iterations. So is_prime is true \u2192 x=2 is output, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: x=9 \u2192 as before, becomes 11.\n\nSo the code is correct in replicating the Java's logic.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as written above."
