    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as the sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java file (atcoder_ABC171_B) reads two integers n and k, then an array of n integers. It sorts the array, sums the first k elements, and outputs the sum. The second Java file (atcoder_AGC025_A) takes an integer N, calculates some value based on splitting N into two parts and their digit sums, then outputs the minimum sum.\n\nThe key is to chain them so that the output of the first becomes the input of the second. But in Fortran, I have to combine them into one program. The first part should read input, process it (summing the first k elements after sorting), then pass that result to the second part which computes the digit sum as per the second Java program.\n\nWait, but how exactly are the two Java programs connected? The first program's output is the sum of the first k elements. That sum is then the input N for the second program. So the Fortran program must read the initial input (n, k, array), compute the sum, then use that sum as N in the second part's logic, and output the final result.\n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read n, k, and the array from input.\n2. Sort the array in ascending order.\n3. Sum the first k elements to get the intermediate result (sum_val).\n4. Use sum_val as N in the second part's logic.\n5. Compute the minimum digit sum as per the second Java program.\n6. Output the final answer.\n\nNow, translating each part into Fortran.\n\nFirst part:\n\n- Read n and k. Then read n integers into an array. Sort the array. Sum first k elements.\n\nSorting in Fortran can be done with the Mergesort or using the built-in sort function. Since Java uses parallelSort, but in Fortran, we can just use a simple sort. Let's sort the array in ascending order.\n\nSecond part:\n\nThe second Java program's logic is to compute the minimal sum of digit sums for splitting N into A and (N - A), where A ranges up to N/2. The minimal sum is found by checking all possible A up to that point.\n\nWait, in the second Java code, the loop runs A from 1 to n, where n is N/2 if even, or (N+1)/2 if odd. The code then for each A computes sum(A) + sum(N - A), and keeps the minimum.\n\nThe function sum(a) adds all digits of a until it's a single digit? Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nWait the sum function in the second Java code:\n\npublic static int sum(int a) {\n    int ans = 0;\n    while (a >= 10) {\n        ans += a % 10;\n        a /= 10;\n    }\n    ans += a;\n    return ans;\n}\n\nWait, no. Wait, the loop continues as long as a is >=10. So for a= 99, first iteration: a%10 is 9, a becomes 9. Then since a is 9 <10, loop ends. So ans is 9 (from first mod) plus 9 (the a after division). So total 18. Wait, but the code adds a%10 each time, but when a is less than 10, it adds the remaining a. So for a= 99, sum is 9+9 =18. For a= 199, 9+9 (from 199 mod 10 is 9, then 19 mod 10 is 9, then a becomes 1. So ans is 9+9 +1? Wait let's see:\n\nWait let's step through a=199:\n\nInitial a=199, ans=0.\n\nFirst iteration: a >=10 \u2192 yes.\n\nans += 199%10 \u2192 9 \u2192 ans=9. a becomes 19.\n\nSecond iteration: a=19 >=10 \u2192 yes.\n\nans += 19%10 \u21929 \u2192 ans=18. a becomes 1.\n\nLoop ends. Then ans += a (1) \u2192 total 19. So sum(199) is 19.\n\nWait, so the function sum(a) is the sum of all digits of a. Because even if a is a single digit, it's added. So for example, sum(5) is 5, sum(10) is 1+0=1, sum(99) is 18, etc.\n\nSo the function is the sum of the digits of a. So in Fortran, I need a function that takes an integer and returns the sum of its digits.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nRead n, k, array.\n\nSort array in ascending order.\n\nsum_val = sum of first k elements.\n\nThen compute the minimal digit sum as per the second Java code, using sum_val as N.\n\nThen output the minimal sum.\n\nNow, let's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, we can read n and k from input, then the array.\n\nSorting the array: use the Mergesort or the built-in sort. Let's use the intrinsic function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array can be sorted with the 'sort' intrinsic. For example:\n\ncall merge_sort(a)\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the array is sorted in ascending order. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module? Or perhaps use the built-in function.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can use the 'sort' intrinsic. Wait, actually, the standard way is to use the 'sort' function from the intrinsic modules. Let me recall.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to use the 'merge_sort' function, but I might need to write a sorting routine. Alternatively, use the 'sort' function from the standard library.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array can be sorted with the 'sort' function. For example:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nBut I need to confirm the direction. Let me see.\n\nWait, according to Fortran documentation, the sort function sorts in ascending order by default. So that's what we need.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n, k, then the array of n integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nsum_val = sum( a(1:k) )\n\nThen proceed to compute the minimal digit sum.\n\nNow, the second part's logic.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\nGiven N (sum_val), compute the minimal sum of digit sums for A from 1 to n (where n is N//2 if even, else (N+1)/2).\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif N is even, n = N/2, else (N+1)/2. So n is the ceiling of N/2? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait in the code:\n\nif (N % 2 ==0) n = N/2 else n = (N+1)/2.\n\nWait for N even, n is exactly N/2. For N odd, (N+1)/2 is (N+1)/2, which is the ceiling of N/2. So the loop runs A from 1 to n, which is up to the midpoint.\n\nThe code then initializes ans as sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then loops A from 1 to n, and checks if sum(A) + sum(N-A) is less than current ans, updating ans if so.\n\nWait, the initial ans is set to sum(1) + sum(N-1). Then the loop starts at A=1, so the first iteration would check A=1 again. But perhaps the code is written that way to have a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial ans is set to that value, and then the loop starts from A=1, but the first check would compare with itself. So the code is okay.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran, I can replicate this.\n\nFirst, compute N = sum_val.\n\nThen compute the minimal sum.\n\nFunction to compute digit sum:\n\nFUNCTION digit_sum(a) RESULT(res)\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a\n    INTEGER :: res, temp, digit\n    temp = a\n    res = 0\n    DO WHILE (temp > 0)\n        digit = MOD(temp, 10)\n        res = res + digit\n        temp = temp / 10\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION digit_sum\n\nWait, but wait, the original Java function adds all digits until a is less than 10? Wait no, the Java function adds all digits, even if the number is a single digit. Wait in the Java code, the loop runs while a >=10. So for a=5, the loop doesn't run, and then ans += a (5). So the function returns the sum of all digits. So the Fortran function above is correct.\n\nWait, the Java code's sum function:\n\nThe loop runs while a >=10. So for a= 99, the loop runs once (a is 99, then 9 after division). Then adds the remaining a (9) to ans. So the total is 9 (from mod) +9 (from a after division). So the sum is 18, which is the sum of all digits. So the Fortran function that loops through each digit and adds them is correct.\n\nSo the digit_sum function in Fortran is correct.\n\nNow, the main logic for the second part:\n\nRead N (sum_val).\n\nCompute n as N//2 if even, else (N+1)/2.\n\nInitialize ans as digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1).\n\nThen loop A from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_sum = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n\nif current_sum < ans \u2192 update ans.\n\nAt the end, output ans.\n\nNow, putting all together in Fortran.\n\nThe Fortran program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, sum_val, N, A, ans, temp_n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\n! Read input\nread*, n, k\nallocate(a(n))\nread*, a\n\n! Sort the array\ncall sort(a)\n\nsum_val = sum(a(1:k))\n\n! Now compute the second part\nN = sum_val\n\nif (mod(N,2) == 0) then\n    temp_n = N/2\nelse\n    temp_n = (N+1)/2\nend if\n\nans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1)\n\ndo A = 1, temp_n\n    if (digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A) < ans) then\n        ans = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n    end if\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\ncontains\n\ninteger function digit_sum(a)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a\n    integer :: temp, digit\n    temp = a\n    digit_sum = 0\n    do while (temp > 0)\n        digit = mod(temp,10)\n        digit_sum = digit_sum + digit\n        temp = temp /10\n    end do\nend function digit_sum\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but wait, in the initial ans assignment, the code in Java does:\n\nans = sum(1) + sum(N-1);\n\nWhich in Fortran would be digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1). That's correct.\n\nBut in the loop, the code starts at A=1, so the first iteration would check A=1 again. But since the initial ans is set to that value, the first check would not change it. So that's okay.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases. For example, if N is 1, then temp_n would be (1+1)/2 =1. The loop runs A=1. Then N -A is 0. Wait, but digit_sum(0) would be 0, so sum(1) + sum(0) is 1 +0 =1. But the initial ans is sum(1) + sum(0) (since N-1 is 0). So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the code, when N is 1, the loop runs A from 1 to 1. So the first iteration is A=1, which is exactly the initial ans. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: N=2. Then temp_n is 1. The loop runs A=1. The sum is sum(1)+sum(1) =1+1=2. The initial ans is sum(1)+sum(1) (since N-1 is 1). So again, same.\n\nAnother case: N=3. temp_n is 2. The loop runs A=1 and 2.\n\nWait, for N=3, the loop runs up to 2. For A=2, N-A is 1. So sum(2) + sum(1) =2+1=3. The initial ans is sum(1)+sum(2) which is same. So the minimal is 3. But maybe there's a better split? Like A=2 gives same as initial.\n\nHmm, but the code is correct as per the Java's logic.\n\nNow, check the Fortran code for possible issues.\n\nThe array is read correctly. The sort is in ascending order, so the first k elements are the smallest, which is correct for the first part's sum.\n\nThe digit_sum function is correct.\n\nThe loop in the second part is correct.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The array in Fortran is 1-based. So when we read the array, the first element is a(1), which is correct.\n\n- The sort function in Fortran sorts in ascending order, which is what the Java code does with parallelSort (which is ascending).\n\n- The sum of the first k elements is correct.\n\n- The calculation of temp_n is correct.\n\n- The loop runs from 1 to temp_n, inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing with sample inputs.\n\nSuppose first Java program's input is:\n\n3 2\n\n1 5 3 \u2192 sorted [1,3,5]. Sum first 2 \u2192 4. So N=4.\n\nThen the second part's code would process N=4.\n\nIn the second part:\n\ntemp_n =4/2=2.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1) + sum(3) \u2192 1 + 3 \u21924.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 2.\n\nA=1: sum(1)+sum(3) \u2192 same as initial \u2192 no change.\n\nA=2: sum(2) + sum(2) \u21922+2=4 \u2192 same as ans.\n\nSo the minimal is 4. So the output is 4.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal could be 4.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 2 2, array [9, 9]. Sum is 18. Then N=18.\n\nThe second part's code would compute the minimal sum of A and 18-A.\n\nLooking for the minimal sum of digits of A and (18-A).\n\nPossible A's up to 9 (since 18/2=9).\n\nThe minimal would be when A=9 \u2192 9 and 9 \u2192 sum 9+9=18.\n\nWait but maybe another A gives a lower sum?\n\nWait A=10? No, since temp_n is 9.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nWait for A=9: sum(9) is 9, sum(9) \u2192 total 18.\n\nA= 18 \u2192 but temp_n is 9, so not considered.\n\nWait what about A= 9, but maybe another A gives lower?\n\nWait A= 10 is beyond the loop.\n\nWait let's see A= 9: sum is 9+9=18.\n\nA= 8: sum(8) + sum(10) \u21928 + (1+0)=9 \u2192 total 9+8=17? Wait sum(10) is 1+0=1. So 8+1=9? Wait 8+1 is 9? Wait 8's sum is 8, 10's sum is 1 \u2192 total 9. So that's better.\n\nWait so A=8 gives 8+1=9, which is better than 18.\n\nWait so why?\n\nWait the loop runs up to 9 (since N=18 even, temp_n=9).\n\nSo A=8 is within the loop.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor A=8, N-A is 10. sum(8)=8, sum(10)=1 \u2192 total 9. That's better than the initial ans of sum(1)+sum(17).\n\nsum(1) is 1, sum(17) is 1+7=8 \u2192 total 9. So the initial ans is 9. Then when A=8, the sum is also 9. So the minimal is 9.\n\nWait but the code's initial ans is sum(1) + sum(17) \u2192 1 + (1+7)=8 \u2192 total 9. So the initial ans is 9, and when A=8, the sum is also 9. So the minimal remains 9.\n\nWait but there might be a better A. Let's see A=9: sum(9) + sum(9) \u21929+9=18. Worse.\n\nA= 10 is not considered.\n\nWait A= 9 is the maximum in the loop. So the minimal is 9.\n\nHmm, so the code would output 9, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: first program's input is 1 1, array [5]. Sum is 5. Then N=5.\n\nThe second part's code:\n\ntemp_n is (5+1)/2 =3.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1) + sum(4) \u21921 +4 \u21925.\n\nThen loop A from 1 to 3.\n\nA=1: sum(1)+4 \u21925 \u2192 same as initial.\n\nA=2: sum(2) + sum(3) \u21922+3=5 \u2192 same.\n\nA=3: sum(3) + sum(2) \u21923+2=5 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the minimal is 5.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better split?\n\nA=5 is not considered since temp_n is 3. So the minimal is 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, the array is read correctly, sorted, summed, then the second part's logic is applied.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nWait, in the code, the function digit_sum is inside a contain block, which is okay.\n\nThe program should be written as:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, k, sum_val, N, A, ans, temp_n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) n, k\n    allocate(a(n))\n    read(*,*) a\n\n    ! Sort the array\n    call sort(a)\n\n    sum_val = sum(a(1:k))\n\n    ! Compute second part\n    N = sum_val\n    if (mod(N, 2) == 0) then\n        temp_n = N / 2\n    else\n        temp_n = (N + 1) / 2\n    end if\n\n    ans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N - 1)\n\n    do A = 1, temp_n\n        if (digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A) < ans) then\n            ans = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print*, ans\n\ncontains\n\n    integer function digit_sum(a)\n        integer, intent(in) :: a\n        integer :: temp, digit\n        temp = a\n        digit_sum = 0\n        do while (temp > 0)\n            digit = mod(temp, 10)\n            digit_sum = digit_sum + digit\n            temp = temp / 10\n        end do\n    end function digit_sum\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the sort function may not be available unless we use a specific module. Wait, the 'sort' intrinsic is part of Fortran 95, but I think it's available in most compilers. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the 'merge_sort' or another method.\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran, the sort function is part of the intrinsic procedures. The syntax is:\n\ncall sort(array)\n\nBut I need to confirm the direction. The default is ascending, which is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, if the compiler doesn't have sort, but I think in standard Fortran 90/95, it's available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the 'merge_sort' function, but I think the code as written is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: the array is read as a list. The read statement for the array:\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nThis will read all elements of the array, which is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the first example:\n\nSample input for first program:\n\n3 2\n\n1 5 3 \u2192 sorted [1,3,5]. Sum is 4 \u2192 N=4.\n\nThe second part's code would compute the minimal sum as 4 (from A=2, sum(2)+sum(2)=2+2=4, but wait, let me see:\n\nWait N=4, temp_n is 2.\n\nInitial ans is sum(1) + sum(3) \u21921+3=4.\n\nLoop A=1: sum(1)+3 \u21924 \u2192 same.\n\nA=2: sum(2) + sum(2) \u21922+2=4 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the minimal is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the minimal is found in the middle.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran program is as written above."
