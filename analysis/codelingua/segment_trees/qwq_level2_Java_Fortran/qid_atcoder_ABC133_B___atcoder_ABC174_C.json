    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate these two Java programs into a single Fortran program that does the same thing as running them in sequence. Let me start by understanding what each Java program does.\n\nFirst, the first Java program (atcoder_ABC133_B) reads input N and D, then N vectors of D elements each. It calculates the number of pairs of vectors whose Euclidean distance is an integer. The distance squared is computed, then the square root is checked for being an integer by seeing if the decimal part is less than 0.001. The answer is printed.\n\nThe second Java program (atcoder_ABC174_C) reads an integer K, and computes the minimal number of times you have to multiply 10 by itself (mod K) until you get 1 mod K. But there are some conditions: if K is even or divisible by 5, return -1. Also, if K is divisible by 7, divide by 7 first. Then multiply K by 9? Wait, let me check the code again. Oh, the code says K = K /7 if divisible by 7, then K *=9. Hmm, maybe that's part of the problem's logic. The solve function then does some modular arithmetic to find the minimal ans where 10^ans \u2261 1 mod K. \n\nWait, the second program's logic is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. The problem is probably to find the minimal positive integer n such that 7^n \u2261 1 mod K, but maybe not. Let me see the code again. The code's solve function:\n\n- If K is even or divisible by 5, return -1. So K must be coprime with 2 and 5. \n\n- Then, if K is divisible by 7, divide K by 7. Then multiply K by 9? Wait, no. Wait, the code says K *=9 after dividing by 7. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7; \n\nThen K *=9. Wait, that's K = (original K divided by 7) multiplied by 9? That seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem requires some transformation. Let me think again. The code's solve function:\n\nWait, the problem might be from ABC174 C, which I might recall. Let me think: the problem was to find the minimal n such that 7^n mod K equals 1. But the code here is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimal n where 7 divides (10^n -1)/9 mod K? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code is solving for the minimal n where 10^n \u2261 1 mod (K * something). Hmm, perhaps I should just focus on translating the code as is.\n\nThe second program's solve function:\n\nThe code first checks if K is even or divisible by 5, returns -1. Then, if K is divisible by 7, it divides K by 7. Then K is multiplied by 9. Then, the code computes the minimal ans where (10^ans) mod K == 1 mod K? Wait, the code's remainder is initialized as 10 mod K. Then, in a loop, remainder = (remainder *10) mod K. The loop continues until remainder is 1. The ans starts at 1, and increments each time. So the loop is looking for the smallest ans where 10^ans mod K ==1. \n\nWait, the initial remainder is 10 mod K. Then, after multiplying by 10 each time, so after ans steps, it's 10^ans mod K. So the loop is looking for the minimal ans where 10^ans \u22611 mod K. \n\nBut why the K is modified? Let me see the steps again:\n\nOriginal K is read. \n\nIf K is even or divisible by 5, return -1. \n\nThen, if K mod7 ==0, then K is divided by 7. \n\nThen K is multiplied by 9. \n\nWait, so K becomes (original K divided by 7 if divisible) multiplied by 9. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that K must not be divisible by 2 or 5, and after dividing by 7, then multiplied by 9? Not sure, but the code is as written, so I have to translate that.\n\nNow, the problem is to combine these two Java programs into a single Fortran program. The first program's output is the answer from the first, which is then the input to the second. Wait, no. Wait, the first program's output is the answer (printed), and the second program reads its own input (K) from the user. Wait, but the user is providing input to the first program, then the second program's input is separate? Wait, the problem says that the output of each program is used as the input to the next. So the first program's output is the input to the second program. \n\nWait, the user runs the first Java program, which reads N and D and vectors, computes the answer (count of pairs with integer distance), then prints that answer. Then, the second program takes that printed answer as its input K. So the second program's K is the first program's output. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence is: \n\nInput to first program \u2192 first program's output is the input to the second program \u2192 second program's output is the final result. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran program must read the first program's input (N, D, vectors), compute the first program's answer, then use that answer as K for the second program's computation, then output the second program's result. \n\nSo the Fortran program must:\n\n1. Read N and D, then the N vectors of D elements each. \n\n2. Compute the first part's answer (count of pairs with integer distance). \n\n3. Then, take that count as K, and compute the second part's answer (the solve function's result). \n\n4. Finally, print the second part's answer. \n\nNo intermediate I/O except first read and last print. \n\nNow, translating the first part into Fortran. \n\nFirst part's steps:\n\nRead N and D. \n\nRead N vectors of D elements each. \n\nCompute for all i < j pairs the squared distance, take sqrt, check if it's integer. \n\nCount how many such pairs. \n\nSecond part's steps:\n\nTake the count (answer from first part) as K. \n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by 5 \u2192 if yes, output -1. \n\nElse, check if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 if yes, divide K by7. \n\nThen multiply K by9. \n\nThen find the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1. \n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by7, K is multiplied by9. \n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nOriginal K is the first program's answer. \n\nThen, if K mod2 ==0 or mod5 ==0 \u2192 return -1. \n\nElse, if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K /7. \n\nThen K = K *9. \n\nThen compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1. \n\nWait, but why multiply by 9? Let me see the code again. \n\nThe code says:\n\nif (K % 7 ==0) K /=7; \n\nK *=9; \n\nWait, so regardless of whether K was divisible by7, after that division (if applicable), multiply by9. \n\nWait, so even if K wasn't divisible by7, it's multiplied by9. \n\nHmm, that's part of the problem's logic. So the code's K is transformed as follows: \n\nOriginal K \u2192 if divisible by7, divide by7 \u2192 then multiply by9. \n\nWait, so the new K is (original K divided by7 if divisible) multiplied by9. \n\nThen, the problem is to find the minimal ans where 10^ans \u22611 mod (new K). \n\nWait, but why? Maybe the problem requires that. \n\nAnyway, the code is as written, so I have to follow that. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. \n\nFirst, the first part's variables. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions. Since D can be up to... Well, the problem's constraints for the first part (ABC133 B) probably have D up to 10^5 or something, but in Fortran, we can read the vectors as a 2D array. \n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic arrays are possible with allocatable arrays. \n\nSo steps for Fortran:\n\nRead N and D. \n\nAllocate a 2D array of size N x D. \n\nRead each row. \n\nCompute the count. \n\nThen proceed to the second part. \n\nNow, for the first part's calculation:\n\nThe distance squared between vectors i and j is sum over d of (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))\u00b2. \n\nThen compute sqrt(dist). If the sqrt is integer (i.e., the decimal part is less than 0.001), then count it. \n\nWait, the code uses Math.sqrt(dist), then checks if the fractional part is less than 0.001. \n\nIn Fortran, we can compute the square root, then check if the difference between the sqrt and its integer part is less than 0.001. \n\nAlternatively, compute the square root as a real number, then see if the difference between the square and the original distance is negligible. Wait, perhaps better to compute the square of the integer part and see if it equals the distance. \n\nWait, the code's logic is: \n\ndouble sq = Math.sqrt(dist); \n\nif (Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001) \u2192 then it's integer. \n\nSo, the distance must be a perfect square, and the square root is an integer. \n\nAlternatively, the code is checking whether the square root is an integer by seeing if the decimal part is less than 0.001. \n\nBut due to floating point precision, this might not be reliable. However, the problem's constraints probably ensure that the distance is an integer, so the square root is either integer or not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct in the problem's context. \n\nIn Fortran, to compute the square root, we can use sqrt function. \n\nSo, for each pair i,j:\n\nCompute dist as sum over d of (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2. \n\nThen compute sqrt_dist = sqrt(dist). \n\nThen check if (sqrt_dist - nint(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001. \n\nWait, but nint rounds to nearest integer. Alternatively, check if the fractional part is less than 0.001. \n\nAlternatively, compute the integer part as int(sqrt_dist + 0.5), then see if (sqrt_dist - int_part) < 0.001. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute the square of the integer part and see if it equals dist. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nSuppose dist is an integer. \n\nIf sqrt(dist) is an integer, then sqrt(dist) must be integer. \n\nSo, the distance must be a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the code's condition is equivalent to checking whether the distance is a perfect square. \n\nWait, but the code uses the square root's fractional part. \n\nWait, for example, if dist is 2, then sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so fractional part is 0.414, which is more than 0.001 \u2192 not counted. \n\nIf dist is 4 \u2192 sqrt is 2.0 \u2192 fractional part 0 \u2192 counted. \n\nIf dist is 5 \u2192 sqrt is ~2.236 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the code is correct in counting only when the distance is a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps a better way is to compute the square root, then see if the square of the integer part equals the distance. \n\nWait, but in code:\n\nsqrt_dist = sqrt(dist)\n\nif (abs(sqrt_dist - nint(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then \u2192 count +=1 \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nsqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) \n\nThen, check if the fractional part is small. \n\nBut in any case, the code's logic must be followed. \n\nNow, for the first part's code in Fortran:\n\nRead N and D. \n\nRead N vectors of D elements each. \n\nInitialize count =0 \n\nLoop over i from 1 to N-1 \n\n   Loop over j from i+1 to N \n\n      dist = 0 \n\n      Loop over d from 1 to D \n\n         dist = dist + (vector(i,d) - vector(j,d))**2 \n\n      end do \n\n      compute sqrt_dist = sqrt(dist) \n\n      if (abs(sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)) < 0.001) then \n\n          count = count +1 \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\nend do \n\nThen, proceed to the second part. \n\nNow, the second part's code. \n\nThe K is the count from the first part. \n\nThen, check if K mod 2 ==0 or mod5 ==0 \u2192 if yes, then the answer is -1. \n\nElse, check if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 if yes, divide K by7. \n\nThen multiply K by9. \n\nThen compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1 mod K. \n\nWait, the code's remainder is initialized as 10 mod K. \n\nWait, the code's loop is: \n\nans starts at 1 \n\nremainder = 10 mod K \n\nloop while remainder !=1 \n\n   ans +=1 \n\n   remainder = (remainder *10) mod K \n\nend loop \n\nSo the loop continues until remainder becomes 1. \n\nThe initial remainder is 10 mod K. \n\nWait, but when K is 1, then 10 mod 1 is 0, but then the loop would check if remainder is 1? So for K=1, the initial remainder is 0, so the loop runs. \n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nSuppose K is 1. \n\nThen after dividing by7 (if applicable), then multiplied by9. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose K is 7 (from first part's count). \n\nThen, since K mod7 ==0, K becomes 1. Then multiplied by9 \u2192 K becomes 9. \n\nWait, but in the code, after dividing by7, K is multiplied by9. \n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\nOriginal K is the first part's count. \n\nCheck if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 if yes, return -1. \n\nElse, if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K = K /7 \n\nThen, K = K *9 \n\nThen, compute the minimal ans where 10^ans mod K ==1. \n\nWait, so the K used in the modular part is (original K divided by7 if divisible) multiplied by9. \n\nWait, so the code's K after processing is (K_initial /7^m) *9, where m is the number of times 7 divides K_initial. \n\nWait, but the code only divides once if divisible by7. Wait, the code says:\n\nif (K %7 ==0) K /=7 \n\nSo it only divides once, even if K was divisible by 7 multiple times. \n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, if K was 49 (7^2), then after division by7, K becomes 7, then multiplied by9 \u2192 63. \n\nBut the code's logic is only dividing once. \n\nHmm, but that's what the code does. So I have to follow that. \n\nSo in Fortran, the steps for the second part are:\n\nK = count (from first part) \n\nif mod(K,2) ==0 or mod(K,5) ==0 \u2192 output -1 \n\nelse \n\n   if mod(K,7) ==0 then \n\n      K = K /7 \n\n   end if \n\n   K = K *9 \n\n   then compute the minimal ans where (10^ans mod K) ==1 \n\nend if \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the minimal ans. \n\nThe loop in the code starts with ans=1, remainder=10 mod K. \n\nThen, while remainder \u22601: \n\n   ans +=1 \n\n   remainder = (remainder *10) mod K \n\nSo the loop continues until remainder is 1. \n\nThe minimal ans is the number of steps needed. \n\nNow, in Fortran, how to implement this. \n\nInitialize ans =1 \n\nremainder = mod(10, K) \n\nif remainder ==1 \u2192 ans is 1 \n\nelse \n\n   loop: \n\n      ans = ans +1 \n\n      remainder = mod(remainder *10, K) \n\n      if remainder ==1 \u2192 exit \n\n      if ans exceeds some limit (to prevent infinite loop?), but the problem probably ensures that K is such that this loop terminates. \n\nBut in code, we can loop until remainder becomes 1. \n\nNow, putting all together. \n\nNow, the Fortran program structure: \n\nprogram main \n\n   implicit none \n\n   integer :: N, D, count, K, ans, remainder \n\n   integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:) \n\n   ! Read N and D \n\n   read*, N, D \n\n   allocate(vectors(N,D)) \n\n   ! Read vectors \n\n   integer :: i,j,d \n\n   do i=1,N \n\n      read*, vectors(i,1:D) \n\n   end do \n\n   ! Compute count \n\n   count =0 \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         integer :: dist \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            integer :: diff = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) \n\n            dist = dist + diff*diff \n\n         end do \n\n         real(kind=8) :: sqrt_dist \n\n         sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) \n\n         real(kind=8) :: fractional = sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist) \n\n         if (fractional < 0.001 .or. (1.0 - fractional) <0.001) then \n\n            ! Because sometimes due to floating point, it might be 2.0000000001 or 1.9999999999 \n\n            count = count +1 \n\n         end if \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\n   ! Now process second part \n\n   K = count \n\n   if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then \n\n      print*, -1 \n\n   else \n\n      if (mod(K,7) ==0) then \n\n         K = K /7 \n\n      end if \n\n      K = K *9 \n\n      ! Now compute ans \n\n      ans =1 \n\n      remainder = mod(10, K) \n\n      if (remainder ==1) then \n\n         print*, ans \n\n      else \n\n         do while (remainder /=1) \n\n            ans = ans +1 \n\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, K) \n\n         end do \n\n         print*, ans \n\n      end if \n\n   end if \n\nend program main \n\nWait, but in the first part's condition, the code checks if the fractional part is less than 0.001. However, in the Java code, it's Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001. \n\nWait, in Java, Math.floor returns the largest double less than or equal to the argument. So the fractional part is (sq - Math.floor(sq)). \n\nSo in Fortran, fractional = sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist). \n\nThe condition is if fractional < 0.001. \n\nWait, but in the code, the condition is (Math.abs(sq - Math.floor(sq)) < 0.001). \n\nWhich is exactly fractional < 0.001. \n\nSo in Fortran, the condition is if (fractional < 0.001). \n\nWait, but in the code above, I have written:\n\nif (fractional < 0.001 .or. (1.0 - fractional) <0.001) then \n\nWait, why? Because maybe due to floating point inaccuracies, the sqrt could be slightly over an integer. For example, sqrt(4) might be 2.0000000001, so fractional is 0.0000000001, which is okay. But if the distance is 5, sqrt is ~2.236, fractional is 0.236. \n\nWait, but the original code's condition is only checking if the fractional part is less than 0.001. So the OR part is unnecessary. \n\nWait, perhaps I added that because I thought that sometimes the sqrt might be slightly less than an integer, but no. The fractional part is always between 0 and 1. \n\nWait, the fractional part is (sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist)), which is between 0 and 1. \n\nSo the condition is simply if fractional < 0.001. \n\nTherefore, the condition in Fortran should be:\n\nif (fractional < 0.001) then \n\ncount +=1 \n\nend if \n\nSo I need to correct that part. \n\nAlso, in the code, the variables for the first part's loops: \n\nThe loops for i and j are from 1 to N-1 and i+1 to N, which is correct. \n\nNow, the second part's K is set to count. \n\nWait, but in the second Java program, the K is read from input. So in the original sequence, the first program's output is the K for the second program. \n\nYes, so in the Fortran code, K is set to count (the first program's answer). \n\nNow, the code for the second part: \n\nAfter checking if K is even or divisible by5 \u2192 output -1. \n\nElse, process K as per the code. \n\nNow, in the case where K is 0? Well, the first program's count can't be zero? Well, if N is 1, then count is 0. But in that case, the second program would take K=0. \n\nBut in the second program's code, if K is 0, then mod(K,2) is 0 \u2192 returns -1. \n\nSo that's handled. \n\nNow, testing edge cases. \n\nSuppose the first program's count is 7. \n\nThen K becomes 7. \n\nCheck mod(7,2)=1, mod(5)=2 \u2192 okay. \n\nThen, since mod(7,7)=0 \u2192 K becomes 1. \n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 K=9. \n\nNow, compute ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1. \n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1. So ans is 1. \n\nSo the output is 1. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose first program's count is 3. \n\nThen K=3. \n\nCheck mod2 and mod5 \u2192 okay. \n\n3 mod7 is not 0 \u2192 so K remains 3, then multiplied by9 \u2192 27. \n\nNow, find ans where 10^ans mod27 ==1. \n\nLet's see:\n\n10 mod27 =10 \u2192 ans=1 \u2192 remainder 10 \n\nans=2 \u2192 10*10 mod27 \u2192 100 mod27 \u2192 100-3*27=100-81=19 \u2192 remainder 19 \n\nans=3 \u2192 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder 1. \n\nSo ans=3. \n\nThus, the code would output 3. \n\nNow, in the code, the loop starts with ans=1, remainder=10 mod27=10. \n\nLoop runs: \n\nans=1 \u2192 remainder is 10 \u2192 not 1 \u2192 loop continues. \n\nans becomes 2, remainder 10*10 mod27=100 mod27=19 \n\nans=2 \u2192 remainder 19 \u2192 loop again. \n\nans=3 \u2192 remainder 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27 \u2192 190-7*27=190-189=1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 exit. \n\nThus, ans is 3. \n\nSo the code would output 3. \n\nNow, in the code, the loop is: \n\nans starts at 1, remainder is 10 mod K. \n\nIf remainder is 1 \u2192 output 1. \n\nElse, loop until remainder becomes 1. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, in the Fortran code, the variables for the second part must be handled correctly. \n\nNow, in the code, after K is set to count, we have to check mod(K,2) and mod(K,5). \n\nNow, in Fortran, mod(K,2) is the remainder when divided by 2. \n\nNow, the code for the second part is as written. \n\nNow, possible issues: \n\n- The first part's distance calculation must be correct. \n\n- The loops for i and j are correct. \n\n- The sqrt is computed correctly. \n\n- The K processing in the second part is correct. \n\nNow, in Fortran, the vectors are stored as integers. \n\nThe distance is the sum of squares of differences. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for the first part's count: \n\nThe loop over i from 1 to N-1, j from i+1 to N. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for the sqrt: \n\nsqrt_dist is computed as sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)), so using double precision. \n\nThe fractional part is sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist). \n\nIf that is less than 0.001, then count +=1. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, in Fortran, the floor function for real numbers is floor(sqrt_dist). \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code for the second part: \n\nAfter K is processed, the code computes the remainder and ans. \n\nNow, the code for the remainder is mod(10,K). \n\nBut in Fortran, mod(10,K) is the remainder of 10 divided by K. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the loop continues until remainder is 1. \n\nNow, the code in Fortran should be correct. \n\nNow, putting all together, the Fortran code would look like this. \n\nWait, but in the first part's count loop, the variables i,j,d are declared inside the loop? \n\nIn Fortran, variables can be declared inside blocks, but in older versions, they have to be at the top. \n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, inside the loops, variables like diff and dist are declared. \n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, inside the i and j loops, I have:\n\ndo i=1,N-1 \n\n   do j=i+1,N \n\n      integer :: dist \n\n      dist =0 \n\n      do d=1,D \n\n         integer :: diff = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) \n\n         dist = dist + diff*diff \n\n      end do \n\n      ... \n\n   end do \n\nend do \n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared before their use. \n\nSo the declarations of dist and diff inside the loop may not be allowed. \n\nAh, right. In Fortran, variable declarations must be at the top of the scope. \n\nSo I need to adjust that. \n\nSo, in the loops, variables like dist and diff must be declared outside. \n\nAlternatively, move the declarations. \n\nLet me restructure the first part's loops. \n\nInside the i loop: \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         integer :: dist \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            integer :: diff \n\n            diff = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) \n\n            dist = dist + diff*diff \n\n         end do \n\n         ... \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nBut in Fortran, the variables dist and diff must be declared before the loops. \n\nAlternatively, declare them before the loops. \n\nAlternatively, move the declarations outside. \n\nLet me adjust the code. \n\nInside the first part's code: \n\n   count =0 \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         integer :: dist \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            integer :: diff \n\n            diff = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) \n\n            dist = dist + diff*diff \n\n         end do \n\n         ... \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nThis is invalid because variables can't be declared inside the loop. \n\nSo, need to declare dist and diff outside. \n\nAlternatively, declare them before the loops. \n\nSo, perhaps: \n\n   integer :: dist, diff \n\n   count =0 \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            diff = vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) \n\n            dist = dist + diff*diff \n\n         end do \n\n         ... \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nBut then, diff is used inside the d loop. \n\nWait, but diff is needed only inside the d loop. \n\nHmm, perhaps better to declare diff inside the d loop. \n\nAlternatively, compute diff inline. \n\nAlternatively, compute the square directly. \n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ndist = dist + (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2 \n\nSo, no need for diff variable. \n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo, changing the code to eliminate diff: \n\n   count =0 \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         integer :: dist \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            dist = dist + (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2 \n\n         end do \n\n         real(kind=8) :: sqrt_dist \n\n         sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) \n\n         real(kind=8) :: fractional = sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist) \n\n         if (fractional < 0.001) then \n\n            count = count +1 \n\n         end if \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nThis way, no need for diff variable. \n\nNow, variables dist is declared inside the j loop. \n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared at the top of the scope. \n\nThe j loop is inside the i loop. \n\nSo, the variable dist must be declared before the j loop. \n\nWait, the code as written declares dist inside the j loop. \n\nWhich is not allowed. \n\nSo, need to declare dist before the j loop. \n\nAlternatively, declare dist before the i loop. \n\nAlternatively, move the declaration outside. \n\nLet me adjust:\n\n   count =0 \n\n   integer :: dist \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            dist = dist + (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2 \n\n         end do \n\n         real(kind=8) :: sqrt_dist \n\n         sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) \n\n         real(kind=8) :: fractional = sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist) \n\n         if (fractional < 0.001) then \n\n            count = count +1 \n\n         end if \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nBut then, dist is declared outside the loops. \n\nWait, but in this case, dist is declared in the same scope as count. \n\nYes, that's okay. \n\nWait, but in the code above, dist is declared as integer, and initialized to 0 for each j. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to declare dist inside the j loop. \n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be declared at the top of the block. \n\nThe block here is the main program. \n\nSo, variables must be declared before any executable statements. \n\nWait, the code structure is: \n\nprogram main \n\n   implicit none \n\n   integer :: N, D, count, K, ans, remainder \n\n   integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:) \n\n   ! Read N and D \n\n   read*, N, D \n\n   allocate(vectors(N,D)) \n\n   ! Read vectors \n\n   integer :: i,j,d \n\n   do i=1,N \n\n      read*, vectors(i,1:D) \n\n   end do \n\n   ! Compute count \n\n   count =0 \n\n   integer :: dist \n\n   do i=1,N-1 \n\n      do j=i+1,N \n\n         dist =0 \n\n         do d=1,D \n\n            dist = dist + (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d))**2 \n\n         end do \n\n         real(kind=8) :: sqrt_dist \n\n         sqrt_dist = sqrt(real(dist, kind=8)) \n\n         real(kind=8) :: fractional = sqrt_dist - floor(sqrt_dist) \n\n         if (fractional < 0.001) then \n\n            count = count +1 \n\n         end if \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\n   ! ... \n\nend program \n\nWait, but the variable dist is declared after count =0. \n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements. \n\nSo the code as written is invalid. \n\nAh, right. So all variables must be declared at the top. \n\nSo, the code must be adjusted to declare all variables first. \n\nSo, the corrected code would have all variables declared at the top. \n\nLet me restructure the code properly. \n\nHere's the corrected Fortran code:\n\nprogram main \n\n   implicit none \n\n   integer :: N, D, count, K, ans, remainder \n\n   integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:) \n\n   integer :: i,j,d, dist \n\n   real(kind=8) :: sqrt_dist, fractional \n\n   !

Process second part \n\n   K = count \n\n   if (mod(K,2) ==0 .or. mod(K,5) ==0) then \n\n      print*, -1 \n\n   else \n\n      if (mod(K,7) ==0) then \n\n         K = K /7 \n\n      end if \n\n      K = K *9 \n\n      ! Compute ans \n\n      ans =1 \n\n      remainder = mod(10, K) \n\n      if (remainder ==1) then \n\n         print*, ans \n\n      else \n\n         do while (remainder /=1) \n\n            ans = ans +1 \n\n            remainder = mod(remainder *10, K) \n\n         end do \n\n         print*, ans \n\n      end if \n\n   end if \n\nend program main \n\nNow, all variables are declared at the top. \n\nThe variables dist, sqrt_dist, fractional are declared at the top. \n\nWait, but sqrt_dist and fractional are used inside the loops. \n\nYes, but they are declared as real(kind=8) at the top. \n\nWait, but in the code above, sqrt_dist and fractional are declared outside the loops, so their values will be overwritten each time. \n\nYes, that's okay. \n\nNow, in the first part's loop, for each pair i,j, we compute dist, then compute sqrt_dist and fractional. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, the code should work. \n\nTesting the code for the first part's example where N=2, D=1, vectors [0,3]. \n\nThen the distance squared is (0-3)^2 =9 \u2192 sqrt is 3.0 \u2192 fractional is 0 \u2192 count is 1. \n\nThen K=1. \n\nSecond part: \n\nCheck mod(1,2)=1, mod(5)=1 \u2192 okay. \n\nCheck mod(1,7)=1 \u2192 no division. \n\nMultiply by9 \u2192 K=9. \n\nNow compute ans where 10^ans mod9 ==1. \n\n10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 ans=1. \n\nSo output is 1. \n\nWhich matches the earlier example. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nFirst program's count is 7. \n\nSecond part: \n\nK=7 \u2192 mod2 and mod5 are okay. \n\nSince mod7 is 0 \u2192 K becomes 1 \u2192 multiply by9 \u2192 K=9. \n\nSame as before \u2192 output 1. \n\nAnother test case where K=3 (count=3). \n\nThen K becomes 3*9=27. \n\nAs before, the ans is 3. \n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nNow, the final Fortran program is as written above."
