So floor(sum) is 1000.0, ceil(sum) is 1000.0, so sum is equal to both, then print with %.1f, which would show 1000.0. But for sum=1000.5, it would print as 1000.5. So, in code:\n\nif (sum == (double)((long long)sum)) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n} But how to handle large numbers that exceed the range of long long. Alternatively, use modf function. double integral;\ndouble fractional = modf(sum, &integral);\nif (fractional == 0.0) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nBut modf splits the sum into integral and fractional parts. If fractional is 0, then sum is an integer. Yes. So code:\n\n#include <math.h>\n...\n\ndouble integral;\ndouble fractional = modf(sum, &integral); if (fractional == 0.0) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nThis would print 1000.0 for integral sums, and the shortest representation otherwise. But in the second sample input, sum is 190100.0, which would be printed as 190100.0. For sum=1000.5, printed as 1000.5. Yes, this would match the Python output. So, modifying the code to use this approach. Thus, the final code would include this logic. Putting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    while (getchar() ! = '\\n'); // consume the newline after N.\n\n    double sum = 0.0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        char line[100];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n        // Trim newline\n        size_t len = strlen(line); if (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n            line[len-1] = '\\0';\n            len--;\n        }\n\n        if (len < 3) {\n            continue; // invalid input, but according to problem statement, this won't happen.\n        }\n\n        char currency[4];\n        strncpy(currency, line + len -3, 3); currency[3] = '\\0';\n\n        char num_str[100];\n        strncpy(num_str, line, len -3);\n        num_str[len -3] = '\\0';\n\n        double value = atof(num_str);\n\n        if (strcmp(currency, \"JPY\") == 0) {\n            sum += value;\n        } else if (strcmp(currency, \"BTC\") == 0) {\n            sum += value * 380000.0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    double integral;\n    double fractional = modf(sum, &integral);\n\n    if (fractional == 0.0) {\n        printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis way, if the sum is an integer (fractional part is zero), it prints with .1f format, which adds .0. Otherwise, uses %g to print without trailing zeros. Thus, this should match the Python output. Testing this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: Input:\n1\n100JPY\n\nsum is 100.0. modf splits into integral 100.0 and fractional 0.0. So print with %.1f \u2192 100.0. Sample 2: Input:\n2\n100JPY\n0.5BTC\n\nsum is 100 + 0.5 * 380000 = 100 + 190000 = 190100.0. modf splits into integral 190100.0 and fractional 0.0. So printed as 190100.0. Another test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n0.5BTC\n\nsum is 0.5 * 380000 = 190000.0. So printed as 190000.0. Another test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n123.45BTC\n\nsum is 123.45 * 380000 = 46911000.0. Printed as 46911000.0. Another test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n3.1415926535BTC\n\nsum is 3.1415926535 * 380000.0 = let's see, 3.1415926535 * 380000 = 3.1415926535 * 3.8e5 = 1,193,805.20833.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's see what the Python code does.\n\nThe Python code reads an integer N, then reads N lines of input. Each line is either a value in JPY or BTC. It replaces 'JPY' with '*1.0' and 'BTC' with '*380000.0', evaluates that string as a Python expression, and then sums all the values.\n\nSo, for example, if the input line is \"1000JPY\", it becomes \"1000 * 1.0\", which evaluates to 1000.0. If it's \"0.5BTC\", it becomes \"0.5 * 380000.0\", which is 190000.0.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, in C, I need to read N from standard input. Then, for each of N lines, read a string, check if it contains \"JPY\" or \"BTC\", parse the numerical part, multiply by 1.0 or 380000.0 accordingly, sum all those values, and finally print the sum.\n\nSo, the main challenges here are:\n\n1. Reading each line correctly in C, handling possible whitespace or newlines.\n2. Parsing the numerical value from the string, which could be an integer or a floating-point number (like 0.5 in the example).\n3. Differentiating between JPY and BTC to apply the correct multiplier.\n4. Accumulating the sum accurately, using a floating-point type to handle possible fractional values.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, read N. In C, we can use scanf to read an integer. But need to be careful about any trailing newlines or other characters.\n\nThen, for each line, read the input. Each line is a string that ends with either JPY or BTC. So perhaps read each line as a string, then process it.\n\nFor each line:\n\n- Find where the currency starts. The currency is either JPY or BTC, so we can check the last three characters. Wait, JPY is three letters, BTC is three letters. Wait, no: \"BTC\" is three letters, but \"JPY\" is three letters. Wait, yes. So the line will be something like \"100JPY\" or \"0.5BTC\".\n\nSo the line is a number followed by either JPY or BTC. So the numerical part is all characters before the currency, and the currency is the last three characters.\n\nSo, for example, in \"123.45JPY\", the number is 123.45, multiplied by 1.0. In \"0.5BTC\", it's 0.5 * 380000.0.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each line, split into the numerical part and the currency part.\n\nIn C, how to do that? One approach is to read the entire line into a buffer, then find the position where the currency starts. Since the currency is three characters long, the numerical part is the string up to length-3.\n\nWait, but if the line is, say, \"5JPY\", then the numerical part is \"5\", and the last three characters are \"JPY\". Similarly, \"0.123BTC\" would have the numerical part \"0.12\" and \"3BTC\" \u2014 no, wait, no. Wait, the line is \"0.123BTC\" \u2014 the length of the string is 7 characters (including the newline?), but let's assume that the input lines are properly formatted. So, for each line, the currency is the last three characters, and the numerical part is the rest.\n\nSo, for a line like \"100JPY\", the currency starts at position 3 (0-based index, assuming the string is 6 characters long including the JPY). Wait, \"100JPY\" is 6 characters. So the numerical part is first three characters (\"100\"), and the currency is the next three (\"JPY\"). But wait, what if the numerical part is longer, like \"1234.56BTC\"? Then the numerical part is up to the last three characters.\n\nSo, the approach would be to take the entire string, and split it into two parts: the number part (all characters except the last three) and the currency (last three characters).\n\nOnce the number is extracted, we need to convert it to a double, then multiply by 1.0 or 380000.0 depending on the currency.\n\nSo, steps for each line:\n\n1. Read the line into a buffer. Use fgets or another function.\n2. Remove any trailing newline characters.\n3. Extract the last three characters to determine the currency.\n4. Take the substring before the last three characters as the numerical string.\n5. Convert that numerical string to a double.\n6. Multiply by 1.0 (JPY) or 380000.0 (BTC).\n7. Add to the sum.\n\nSo, in C code:\n\nRead N with scanf.\n\nThen, for N times, read each line.\n\nBut when reading lines with scanf, mixing scanf and fgets can be tricky because scanf leaves the newline in the buffer. So perhaps use fgets to read each line after reading N.\n\nWait, first, read N using scanf, then read N lines using fgets. But need to consume the newline after N. Alternatively, read all input with fgets and parse accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, to read N, then loop N times, reading each line.\n\nBut in C, reading lines can be done with fgets. So:\n\nint N;\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n// Now, consume the newline left by scanf\nint c;\nwhile ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n\nThen, for each line:\n\nchar line[100]; // assuming lines are not longer than 100 characters\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n    // process line\n}\n\nBut perhaps the lines could be longer, but the problem's input constraints probably allow this.\n\nOnce we have the line, process it.\n\nSo, first, remove the newline at the end. For example:\n\nsize_t len = strlen(line);\nif (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n    line[len-1] = '\\0';\n}\n\nThen, check the last three characters. So:\n\nchar currency[4] = {0};\nstrncpy(currency, line + strlen(line) - 3, 3);\ncurrency[3] = '\\0'; // ensure null-terminated\n\nThen, the numerical part is the string up to the last three characters. For example, line is \"123.45BTC\", then currency is \"BTC\", and the numerical part is \"123.45\".\n\nBut how to get the numerical part. Let's compute the length of the line (after trimming the newline), subtract 3, then take the first part.\n\nBut need to make sure that the line is at least 3 characters long. Otherwise, it's invalid input, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo:\n\nchar *num_str = line;\nnum_str[strlen(num_str) - 3] = '\\0'; // truncate the line to exclude the currency\n\nWait, but modifying the original line buffer. Alternatively, we can create a new buffer for the numerical part. For example:\n\nsize_t line_len = strlen(line);\nif (line_len < 3) {\n    // invalid input, but according to problem statement, it's correct.\n    // handle error?\n}\n\nchar *currency_part = line + (line_len - 3);\ncurrency_part[3] = '\\0'; // no need, since line is already null-terminated.\n\nThen, the numerical part is the string from the start to line_len -3. For example:\n\nchar num_str[100];\nstrncpy(num_str, line, line_len -3);\nnum_str[line_len -3] = '\\0';\n\nThen, convert num_str to a double.\n\ndouble value = atof(num_str);\n\nWait, but atof has no error checking. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nOnce we have the value, multiply by 1.0 if JPY, else multiply by 380000.0.\n\nSo:\n\nif (strcmp(currency_part, \"JPY\") == 0) {\n    sum += value;\n} else if (strcmp(currency_part, \"BTC\") == 0) {\n    sum += value * 380000.0;\n} else {\n    // invalid currency, but according to problem statement, this won't happen.\n}\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nNow, the sum should be a double, initialized to 0.0.\n\nFinally, print the sum. Since the problem's sample code uses sum(x), which in Python would be a float, but when printed, for example, 1000.0 would be printed as 1000.0, but perhaps in C, we can print it as a floating point number. However, in the sample input, if all values are integer (like 1000JPY and 0.5BTC), the sum could be 1000 + 190000 = 191000.0. So, in C, printing with, say, %.12g format to avoid trailing zeros if possible.\n\nBut the problem's sample code in Python uses print(sum(x)), which for the sum of integers would print as an integer, but in Python, if there's a fractional part, it would print with decimals. But in C, using printf(\"%f\\n\", sum) would print trailing zeros. Wait, but in the Python code, sum(x) could be a float. For example, if all inputs are JPY, then sum is integer if all JPY values are integers, but could be a float if any input has a decimal. So, in C, the sum is a double, and we can print it with a format that shows all significant digits without unnecessary decimal points.\n\nBut perhaps using printf(\"%.12f\\n\", sum) is not the best. Alternatively, using %g to automatically remove trailing zeros.\n\nSo, printf(\"%.12g\\n\", sum); ?\n\nAlternatively, just print the sum as a floating point number. Let's see:\n\nIn the Python example, if x is [1000.0, 190000.0], sum is 191000.0, which would print as 191000.0. But in Python, print(191000.0) outputs 191000.0. But in C, printf(\"%f\", sum) would output 191000.000000. So, perhaps using %f is not desired. So, to avoid trailing zeros, perhaps use %.12g, which will output the number in the shortest possible way, using scientific notation if necessary, but here, since the numbers are likely to be integers, but perhaps with decimal points.\n\nAlternatively, in the sample code, since all the values are converted to floats (with .0?), but in practice, the sum could be a whole number or a fractional. So, the output should match the Python code's output.\n\nBut Python's sum of floats will print as an integer if it's a whole number (e.g., 1000.0 becomes 1000.0 when printed, but perhaps in Python it would print as 1000.0). Wait, no. Let me check. For example, in Python:\n\nx = [1000.0, 2000.0]\nprint(sum(x))  # outputs 3000.0\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Python, if all elements are integers stored as floats, sum would be a float. So sum([1000.0, 2000.0]) is 3000.0, and print would output 3000.0. But the problem's sample code may have inputs that could result in a sum with decimal parts, so in C, the code should output the sum as a floating-point number, possibly with decimal point and fractional part.\n\nThus, in C, to print the sum accurately, including decimal points if necessary, using printf(\"%f\", sum) would output six decimal places, which may include trailing zeros. However, the problem's Python code uses sum(x) and prints it, which would output the sum with as many decimal digits as needed. For example, if the sum is 1000.0, it would print as 1000.0. If it's 1000.5, it would print as 1000.5.\n\nBut in C, using printf(\"%g\", sum) would automatically remove trailing zeros. For example, 1000.0 would be printed as 1000, and 1000.5 as 1000.5. However, the problem's sample code outputs 1000.0 as a float, which in Python would have the .0. So, perhaps the expected output is to have the sum printed with all decimal digits, even if they are zero. Wait, no. Let's see: the Python code's output for sum(x) when x is a list of floats.\n\nWait, in Python, the print statement converts the sum to a string. For example, sum([1.0, 2.0]) is 3.0, and printing it outputs 3.0. But if the sum is an integer (but stored as float), like 3.0, print outputs 3.0. However, if the sum is an integer with no decimal part, but stored as float, it would print as 3.0. So, in C, we need to output the sum with a decimal point, even if the value is an integer. For example, 1000.0 should be printed as 1000.0, not 1000.\n\nBut in C, when you use printf(\"%f\", 1000.0), it outputs 1000.000000. If you use printf(\"%g\", 1000.0), it outputs 1000. So, how to match Python's output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows any output that correctly represents the sum as a floating-point number, regardless of trailing zeros. But to match the Python code's output, perhaps we need to format it to have one decimal place if it's a whole number. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the sum is 1000.5, then Python would print 1000.5. So, perhaps using a format that prints as many digits as needed, but with at least one decimal digit.\n\nBut in C, the %g format specifier removes trailing zeros and the decimal point if not needed. So for 1000.0, it would print as 1000, but for 1000.5, as 1000.5.\n\nBut the Python code's output for 1000.0 would be 1000.0. So, there's a discrepancy here. How to handle this?\n\nHmm. This could be a problem. How to make sure that the output in C matches the Python code's output.\n\nIn Python, the sum is a float, so even if it's an integer value, it's printed as a float. For example, 1000.0 is printed as 1000.0. But in C, using %g would print 1000.0 as 1000, which is different.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me test in C.\n\nIf sum is 1000.0, then printf(\"%g\", sum) outputs \"1000\", but in Python, print(1000.0) outputs \"1000.0\". So, how to make C output the same as Python.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use printf(\"%.1f\", sum), but that would round to one decimal place. Not correct.\n\nAlternatively, use printf(\"%f\", sum), which outputs six decimal places, which would add trailing zeros. For example, 1000.0 becomes 1000.000000, which is not the same as Python's 1000.0.\n\nSo this is a problem.\n\nAnother approach: in Python, the print statement for a float will print the minimal number of digits needed to represent the number exactly, but it's complicated. For example:\n\n- 1000.0 is printed as 1000.0\n- 1000 is printed as 1000 (if it's an integer)\nBut when the sum is a float, like 1000.0, the print statement in Python outputs 1000.0.\n\nSo, to replicate this in C, perhaps the code should output the sum as a floating-point number, ensuring that even if it's an integer value, it has a decimal point and at least one digit after it.\n\nBut how to do this in C. The %f format specifier would add trailing zeros. The %g specifier would not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps check if the sum is an integer. If it is, print it with a .0 suffix, else print normally.\n\nBut how to check if the sum is an integer.\n\nIn C code:\n\nif (sum == floor(sum) && !isinf(sum)) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nBut this may not work for all cases. For example, sum of 1000.0 would be printed as 1000.0, which matches Python. For sum of 1000.5, it would print 1000.5.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, use a format string that always includes a decimal point.\n\nIn C, the %.0f format specifier would print the integer part, but without decimal point. Wait, no. For example:\n\nprintf(\"%.0f\", 1000.0) outputs \"1000\", with no decimal point.\n\nBut how to print 1000.0 as 1000.0?\n\nOne way is to use the \"%f\" format, which always includes a decimal point. For example:\n\nprintf(\"%f\", sum) would output 1000.000000. But in Python, it's 1000.0.\n\nAlternatively, use \"%g\", but that removes trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n\nAlternatively, use the format string \"%.12g\", which allows up to 12 significant digits. For 1000.0, it would output 1000, but for 1000.5, 1000.5. But this is different from Python's output.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects that the sum is printed as a floating-point number, but the exact output format isn't critical as long as the numerical value is correct. For example, in the sample input where N=1 and the input is 100JPY, the sum is 100.0, and the output in Python is 100.0. In C, using %f would output 100.000000, but the problem's test case may accept either as correct, as long as the numerical value is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to output the sum as an integer when possible and float otherwise. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the sum is a whole number, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, since the Python code uses eval, which can handle expressions, but in practice, the code reads lines and replaces the JPY and BTC parts. So perhaps all the lines are properly formatted, and the sum is a floating-point number. So in C, the code can just print the sum using %f, leading to trailing zeros, but the problem's test cases would accept that.\n\nAlternatively, to output the sum with as many digits as needed, but with at least one decimal digit.\n\nIn C, the format specifier that does this is \"%g\", but %g removes trailing zeros. So, for 1000.0, it would output 1000, but for 1000.5, 1000.5.\n\nBut in Python, the output for sum(x) would be 1000.0 in the first case and 1000.5 in the second. So the C code's output would differ.\n\nThis could be a problem. But perhaps the problem's test cases allow for this discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a different approach. For example, the Python code evaluates the expressions, so for example, \"100JPY\" becomes 100 *1.0 \u2192 100.0. \"0.5BTC\" becomes 0.5 *380000.0 \u2192 190000.0. So the sum is a float, which may have a fractional part.\n\nIn C, to represent this sum accurately, perhaps using a double and then printing it with sufficient precision.\n\nBut the problem is that Python's print statement for a float may show more decimal places than C's %g.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows any output as long as the numerical value is correct. So, for example, if the sum is 1000.0, then 1000.0 and 1000 are both correct, but according to the problem's sample, the Python code would output 1000.0. So in C, perhaps the code should output 1000.0.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAh, perhaps using the %g format specifier, but forcing it to show one decimal place. Wait, but %g automatically removes trailing zeros and unnecessary decimal points.\n\nAlternatively, use a different approach. For example, convert the sum to a string and check if it contains a decimal point. If not, append .0. But this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, in C, use the format %.1f, but that would round to one decimal place, which is not correct. For example, sum of 1000.4 would become 1000.4, but sum of 1000.45 would become 1000.5.\n\nSo that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use printf(\"%f\", sum), which would print six decimal places. But that would output 1000.000000 for 1000.0. But the problem's sample code would output 1000.0.\n\nBut maybe the problem's test cases are lenient enough to accept 1000.000000 as correct.\n\nBut in the sample code's example, the sum would be printed as sum(x). For example:\n\nSample input:\n\n1\n100JPY\n\nPython code would output 100.0.\n\nIn C, using %f would output 100.000000.\n\nBut the problem's test cases may require that the output matches exactly. So this would be a problem.\n\nHmm. So how to match the Python output exactly.\n\nAnother approach: format the sum as a string, remove trailing zeros after the decimal point, but ensure at least one decimal digit.\n\nFor example, 100.0 \u2192 \"100.0\", 100.5 \u2192 \"100.5\", 100.25 \u2192 \"100.25\".\n\nBut in C, this requires custom formatting. Which is a bit complex.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows trailing zeros, and the judge would accept them. Because in programming contests, sometimes trailing zeros are acceptable as long as the value is correct.\n\nIn the original Python code, the output could have varying decimal digits, but the problem's test cases may not require an exact match in the format, as long as the numerical value is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps in C, using printf(\"%f\\n\", sum) is acceptable, even though it adds trailing zeros.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead N.\n\nInitialize sum to 0.0.\n\nFor each line:\n\n- Read the line.\n\n- Trim the newline.\n\n- Extract currency.\n\n- Extract numerical string.\n\n- Convert to double.\n\n- Multiply by 1.0 or 380000.0.\n\n- Add to sum.\n\nPrint sum with %f.\n\nBut in C, the code would look like this:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    while (getchar() != '\\n'); // consume the newline after N.\n\n    double sum = 0.0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        char line[100];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n        // Trim newline\n        size_t len = strlen(line);\n        if (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n            line[len-1] = '\\0';\n            len--;\n        }\n\n        // Extract currency: last 3 characters\n        if (len < 3) {\n            // invalid input, but problem says input is correct.\n            // handle error? Probably not needed.\n            continue;\n        }\n        char currency[4];\n        strncpy(currency, line + len -3, 3);\n        currency[3] = '\\0';\n\n        // Extract numerical part: first len-3 characters\n        char num_str[100];\n        strncpy(num_str, line, len -3);\n        num_str[len -3] = '\\0';\n\n        double value = atof(num_str);\n\n        if (strcmp(currency, \"JPY\") == 0) {\n            sum += value;\n        } else if (strcmp(currency, \"BTC\") == 0) {\n            sum += value * 380000.0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%f\\n\", sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, what if the line is, for example, \"5BTC\" \u2014 len is 4 (including the '\\0'?), no, when we read with fgets, the line includes the newline, which we trim. So after trimming, \"5BTC\" is 4 characters ( '5', 'B', 'T', 'C') ?\n\nWait, after trimming the newline, the line is \"5BTC\", len is 4.\n\nSo len-3 = 1. So num_str is the first 1 character: '5', then the currency is 'BTC'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about a line like \"0.5BTC\"? After trimming, the line is \"0.5BTC\" (6 characters). len-3 is 3. So num_str is first 3 characters: '0.5' (wait, no. \"0.5BTC\" is 6 characters. len is 6. len-3 is 3. So num_str is the first 3 characters: '0.5' (assuming line is '0.5BTC', the first three are '0.5' \u2014 but then the currency is 'BTC'. So the num_str would be '0.5' \u2014 but then atof(num_str) would be 0.5. Then multiply by 380000, giving 190000.0.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut wait, the original line is \"0.5BTC\". After trimming, the line is '0.5BTC' (6 characters). len is 6. len-3 is 3. So num_str is the first 3 characters: '0.5' (but the actual numerical part is '0.5' \u2014 but the line is \"0.5BTC\", so the numerical part is \"0.5\" and the currency is \"BTC\". Wait, but len is 6, len-3 is 3. So the first 3 characters are '0.5', and the currency is the last three 'BTC'? But the numerical part should be \"0.5\", which is 3 characters.\n\nWait, the line is \"0.5BTC\" \u2014 the numerical part is \"0.5\", which is three characters. So when len is 6, len-3 is 3. So strncpy(num_str, line, 3) \u2014 copies the first three characters: '0.5' \u2014 but the actual numerical part is \"0.5\" which is correct. Yes.\n\nSo, that would work.\n\nAnother example: line is \"123.45BTC\" \u2014 after trimming, len is 8 (since \"123.45BTC\" is 8 characters). len-3 is 5. So num_str is first 5 characters: '123.4', and the currency is 'BTC'? Wait, no. The line is \"123.45BTC\", which is 8 characters. len is 8. len-3=5. So the numerical part is first 5 characters: '123.4' \u2014 but that's incorrect. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, this is a mistake. Because the line \"123.45BTC\" has the numerical part \"123.45\" (6 characters), followed by \"BTC\" (3), total 9 characters. But len is 9 after trimming. len-3 is 6. So num_str is first 6 characters: '123.45', which is correct.\n\nWait, in the line \"123.45BTC\", after trimming newline, the length is 8 characters? Let me count:\n\n\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\".\",\"4\",\"5\",\"B\",\"T\",\"C\" \u2014 no, \"123.45BTC\" is 8 characters? Let's see:\n\nEach character: 1 2 3 . 4 5 B T C \u2192 that's 9 characters. So after trimming newline, len is 9. So len-3 is 6. So num_str is first 6 characters: '123.45', which is correct.\n\nAh, right. So the code would work correctly here.\n\nBut if the line is \"123.4BTC\", then after trimming, len is 7. len-3 is 4. So num_str is first 4 characters: '123.4' \u2014 correct, and currency is 'BTC'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when the numerical part has more decimal digits, like \"123.456BTC\"? Then len is 9, len-3=6. num_str is first 6 characters: '123.45' \u2014 but the actual numerical part is 123.456, so this would be incorrect.\n\nWait, no. If the line is \"123.456BTC\", the len after trimming is 9. So len-3 is 6. The first 6 characters are '123.45', and the currency is '6BT' \u2014 which is wrong. Because the currency should be the last three characters.\n\nWait, no. Because the line is \"123.456BTC\" \u2014 the currency is 'BTC', which is the last three characters.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe line is \"123.456BTC\" \u2192 total characters:\n\n1 2 3 . 4 5 6 B T C \u2192 10 characters. So after trimming newline, len is 10. Then len-3=7. So the currency is the last three characters (B T C), and the numerical part is first 7 characters: '123.456'.\n\nYes. So the code would correctly split into '123.456' and 'BTC' in this case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: leading or trailing spaces in the line. But according to the problem statement, the input is in the format of a number followed by JPY or BTC. So the lines do not have any spaces. So the code can assume that the numerical part is directly followed by the currency.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n1\n100JPY\n\nThe code reads N=1. Then reads the line \"100JPY\". Trim newline. len is 6. len-3=3. num_str is '100'. currency is 'JPY'. value is 100.0. sum becomes 100.0. Printed with %f \u2192 100.000000. But the Python code outputs 100.0. So the judge may not accept this. But perhaps the problem allows it.\n\nAlternatively, change the printf format to use %g, which would output 100.\n\nBut in Python, it would output 100.0.\n\nSo this is a problem.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n2\n100JPY\n0.5BTC\n\nExpected sum: 100 + 0.5*380000 = 100 + 190000 = 190100 \u2192 190100.0.\n\nPython code outputs 190100.0.\n\nC code with printf(\"%f\") outputs 190100.000000.\n\nBut if the judge expects exactly the same formatting, this would be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases use floating-point numbers with up to 12 decimal digits and thus accept both.\n\nAlternatively, to use \"%g\" in the printf statement. Then, in the first sample, the output would be 100, and in the second sample, 190100.\n\nBut Python outputs 100.0 and 190100.0.\n\nSo, this is a problem.\n\nHmm. How to solve this?\n\nPerhaps the key is to use a format that forces the output to have at least one decimal place, but no trailing zeros.\n\nIn Python, the float 100.0 is printed as 100.0, but in C, using %g would print 100.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem's judge is not case-sensitive to the format, as long as the numerical value is correct.\n\nBut if the problem requires the exact same output, including the .0 for integer values, then the code needs to produce that.\n\nBut how to achieve this in C.\n\nAn alternative approach: convert the sum to an integer if it's a whole number, else print as float.\n\nBut how to do that in C.\n\nCheck if sum is equal to (int)sum.\n\nBut sum is a double.\n\nSo:\n\nif (sum == floor(sum) && sum == ceil(sum)) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nWait, but this isn't accurate. Because sum could be 1000.0, which is an integer. So floor(sum) is 1000.0, ceil(sum) is 1000.0, so sum is equal to both, then print with %.1f, which would show 1000.0. But for sum=1000.5, it would print as 1000.5.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (sum == (double)((long long)sum)) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nBut how to handle large numbers that exceed the range of long long.\n\nAlternatively, use modf function.\n\ndouble integral;\ndouble fractional = modf(sum, &integral);\nif (fractional == 0.0) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nBut modf splits the sum into integral and fractional parts. If fractional is 0, then sum is an integer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\n#include <math.h>\n...\n\ndouble integral;\ndouble fractional = modf(sum, &integral);\nif (fractional == 0.0) {\n    printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n} else {\n    printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n}\n\nThis would print 1000.0 for integral sums, and the shortest representation otherwise.\n\nBut in the second sample input, sum is 190100.0, which would be printed as 190100.0. For sum=1000.5, printed as 1000.5.\n\nYes, this would match the Python output.\n\nSo, modifying the code to use this approach.\n\nThus, the final code would include this logic.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    while (getchar() != '\\n'); // consume the newline after N.\n\n    double sum = 0.0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        char line[100];\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n        // Trim newline\n        size_t len = strlen(line);\n        if (len > 0 && line[len-1] == '\\n') {\n            line[len-1] = '\\0';\n            len--;\n        }\n\n        if (len < 3) {\n            continue; // invalid input, but according to problem statement, this won't happen.\n        }\n\n        char currency[4];\n        strncpy(currency, line + len -3, 3);\n        currency[3] = '\\0';\n\n        char num_str[100];\n        strncpy(num_str, line, len -3);\n        num_str[len -3] = '\\0';\n\n        double value = atof(num_str);\n\n        if (strcmp(currency, \"JPY\") == 0) {\n            sum += value;\n        } else if (strcmp(currency, \"BTC\") == 0) {\n            sum += value * 380000.0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    double integral;\n    double fractional = modf(sum, &integral);\n\n    if (fractional == 0.0) {\n        printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"%g\\n\", sum);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis way, if the sum is an integer (fractional part is zero), it prints with .1f format, which adds .0. Otherwise, uses %g to print without trailing zeros.\n\nThus, this should match the Python output.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n1\n100JPY\n\nsum is 100.0. modf splits into integral 100.0 and fractional 0.0. So print with %.1f \u2192 100.0.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2\n100JPY\n0.5BTC\n\nsum is 100 + 0.5 * 380000 = 100 + 190000 = 190100.0. modf splits into integral 190100.0 and fractional 0.0. So printed as 190100.0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n0.5BTC\n\nsum is 0.5 * 380000 = 190000.0. So printed as 190000.0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n123.45BTC\n\nsum is 123.45 * 380000 = 46911000.0. Printed as 46911000.0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n1\n3.1415926535BTC\n\nsum is 3.1415926535 * 380000.0 = let's see, 3.1415926535 * 380000 = 3.1415926535 * 3.8e5 = 1,193,805.20833. This has a fractional part, so printed with %g \u2192 1193805.21 (depending on precision). But the modf would find the fractional part non-zero, so it uses %g.\n\nBut in Python, sum would be 1193805.20833, so printed as 1193805.20833.\n\nBut with %g in C, it would print as 1193805.21 if there are six significant digits. But wait, the %g format uses up to six significant digits by default. So in that case, the output would be rounded.\n\nBut the problem requires the exact sum. So using %g may not be sufficient.\n\nWait, no. The %g format in C uses the shortest representation that can be parsed back to the same value. So for 1193805.20833, if it's stored as a double (which has limited precision), the printf with %g will print enough digits to uniquely identify the double value. But doubles have about 15-17 significant digits. So using %.12g would print enough digits to represent the exact value.\n\nSo, modifying the code to use %.12g in the else case.\n\nSo, changing the code's else part to printf(\"%.12g\\n\", sum);.\n\nThis would print up to 12 significant digits, which should cover the precision of doubles.\n\nThus, the final code's printf section becomes:\n\n    if (fractional == 0.0) {\n        printf(\"%.1f\\n\", sum);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"%.12g\\n\", sum);\n    }\n\nThis ensures that for integer sums, the .0 is added, and for others, up to 12 digits are printed, avoiding scientific notation if possible.\n\nBut the problem's Python code may output more decimal digits. For example, if the sum is 0.1, which can't be represented exactly in binary, the output in Python and C may differ. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the inputs are such that the sum can be represented exactly as a float.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's test cases may not require exact decimal digits, only that the numerical value is correct.\n\nIn any case, the code should handle most cases correctly.\n\nThus, the final C code should read N, read each line, parse the numerical part and currency, accumulate the sum, and print it with the correct formatting."
