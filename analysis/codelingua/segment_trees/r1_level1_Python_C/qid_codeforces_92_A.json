For example, if n is 5, i goes 1,2,3,4,5,1,2, etc. So in C, that part is straightforward. The loop runs as long as m is >= i. Each time, m decreases by i, then i increments, but wraps around to 1 after n. The output is the remaining m. So the C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m, i = 1;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    while (m >= i) {\n        m -= i;\n        i = (i % n) + 1;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", m);\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but wait. Let me test a case. For example, let's say n=5, m=10. First iteration: i=1. m=10-1=9. i becomes (1%5)+1 = 2. Next, i=2: m=9-2=7. i=3. Next: 7-3=4. i=4.\n\n4-4=0. i=5.\n\n0 >=5 is false. So loop ends. Output is 0. Which matches the Python code. Another test case: n=3, m=8. Loop steps:\n\ni=1: m=8-1=7. i=2. i=2: m=7-2=5. i=3. i=3: m=5-3=2. i=1 (3%3=0 +1=1). Now m=2. i=1. 2 >=1: yes. m=2-1=1. i=2. Now m=1, which is less than i=2. So loop stops. Output is 1. So code seems correct. So the translation seems straightforward.",
