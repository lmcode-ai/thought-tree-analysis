If the integer is zero, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0. Then, it loops once (since tcs is 1) and runs the solve function once. First, in C, I need to include the necessary headers. Since we're doing input/output, I'll need stdio.h. The Python code uses stdin.readline() to get input. In C, I can use scanf or fgets. But for a simple integer, scanf is easier. So, I'll use scanf(\"%d\", &a) to read the integer.",

Since the loop runs once, maybe it's easier to not create a function and just put the code in main. Wait, looking at the Python code: tcs is 1, and the loop runs from tc=1 to tcs. So the loop runs once. So in C, the main function can handle that. So steps:\n\n1. Read an integer a from stdin. 2. If a is 0, print 1. Else, print 0. But wait, in Python, the code is 1 if a==0 else 0. So it's the inverse. Like, when input is 0, output is 1, else 0. So in C, the code would be:\n\nint a;\nscanf(\"%d\", &a);\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", a == 0 ? 1 : 0);\n\nBut need to handle possible errors in input. But the original Python code assumes the input is properly formatted. So same in C.\n\nNow, the structure of the original code has a loop over tcs, which is 1.
