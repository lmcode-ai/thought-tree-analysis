So the loop in the C code checks j starting from X, incrementing until it finds a prime. But if X is 100009, then j starts there. If j is 100009 and prime[j] is true, then it's printed. But if j exceeds 100009 (like j=100010), then the array is of size 100010, so j=100010 is out of bounds. So in C, accessing prime[j] where j is >=100010 is undefined behavior. So the code has a potential buffer overflow. So to replicate the original code's behavior, the C code's loop should only check up to 100008 (exclusive), i.e., j up to 100007. But the original code's sieve may have primes beyond that. So perhaps the code in C should loop up to 100008 (exclusive). So the code should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        break;\n    }\n} But if no such j is found, then the code exits without printing. But according to the problem's statement, there is always a prime in the sieve's range. So perhaps the original code has a mistake, but the problem's constraints ensure that X is such that a prime exists in that range. But in the C code, to avoid accessing out of bounds, the loop should check up to 100008 (exclusive). However, in the original code, the loop may check j=100008 if X is 100008. Because in Python, range(X, 100008) would be from X to 100007 if X is less than 100008. For example, X=100007: the loop checks 100007. X=100008: the loop checks nothing. So the code would not print anything. But the sieve array has primes up to 100009. So perhaps the original code's loop should have been up to 100010. But that's not the case. But as a translator, the code should be as close as possible. So the original code's loop is up to 100008 (exclusive), so in C, the loop should be from X to 100008-1 (100007). So in C:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) { if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n//",

But the original Python code's loop is up to 100008 (exclusive). So the C code's loop is different. This is a mistake in the translation. The original Python code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(X, 100008): if prime[i]:\n        print(i)\n        break\n\nThis loop will exit after checking up to 100007. So in C, the loop should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// If no prime found in this range, the code would proceed. But according to the problem's statement, there must be one. So the code may not handle this case. But the original Python code uses a for loop with a fixed upper limit. So in C, the code must replicate that. Otherwise, for cases where X is 100009, the C code would loop j=100009, which is beyond the sieve's processed range (since the sieve marks up to 100008). So the code would access prime[j], which is beyond the sieve's processed j (100008). For example, j=100009 may be a prime, but the sieve didn't process it. So in the sieve's initialization steps:\n\n- j=100009 is even? No, 100009 is odd. So in the sieve, even numbers >=4 are marked as non-prime, but 100009 is odd, so it was initialized to true. Then, during the sieve steps, i runs up to sqrt(100008) which is 316. For j=100009, if it's a multiple of any prime i <=316, then it would be marked as non-prime. Otherwise, it remains true. But in the original code, the sieve's loop for j runs up to 100008. So for example, 100009 is a prime number, but the sieve code doesn't mark it. So prime[100009] would be true if it's a prime. So in the C code, the loop for j from X to infinity would check j=100009, which is outside the sieve's processing. But the sieve's array is size 100010, so j=100009 is within the array. So the code would check it. But the original code's loop only checks up to 100007. So this is a discrepancy between the C code and the Python code. Thus, the correct translation would be to have the loop in C check j from X to 100007, inclusive. So in C:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n//",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me read through the Python code first to understand what it does. \n\nThe code starts by reading an integer X. Then it creates a list called prime of size 100010, initializing all elements to True. The first two elements, 0 and 1, are set to False because they're not primes. Then it marks all even numbers starting from 4 as non-prime. After that, it uses a sieve approach for odd numbers starting from 3: for each i, if it's prime, it marks all multiples of i as non-prime. Finally, it looks for the first prime number starting from X and prints it.\n\nSo the main steps are: sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes up to 100008, then find the first prime >= X.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's think about the steps:\n\n1. In C, we can't have a list of booleans directly, so we'll use an array of integers, where 1 represents true and 0 false. Or maybe use bool from stdbool.h. Let's check: including stdbool.h allows using bool, true, false. But for older C standards, maybe not. But assuming it's allowed, that's better.\n\n2. The sieve initialization: the Python code creates a list of 100010 elements. So in C, we need an array of size 100010. But wait, in the Python code, the loop for i in range(X, 100008) checks up to 100008. Wait, the sieve is up to 100008, which is less than 100010. So maybe the array can be of size 100010. So in C, we'll declare prime as a static array of size 100010.\n\n3. The steps:\n\n- Initialize all elements to true (1), then set 0 and 1 to false (0).\n- Mark even numbers >=4 as false. So in C, loop from 4 to 100009, step 2. So for (int i=4; i < 100010; i +=2) prime[i] = 0;\n- Then for i starting at 3, check while i*i <= 100008 (since the sieve goes up to 100008, maybe 100008 is the upper limit for primes to check). Then for each i, if prime[i] is true, mark multiples of i starting from i+i (so i*2?), stepping by i. But in Python, the loop is for j in range(i+i, 100008, i): prime[j] = False. So in C, the loop would be for (j = i*2; j < 100008; j +=i). Wait, the upper limit in Python is 100008, but the array is 100010. So perhaps in C, we need to loop up to 100008, but the array is size 100010. So that's okay.\n\n4. Then, after building the sieve, the code loops from X to 100008, and finds the first i where prime[i] is true, then prints it.\n\nNow, in C, we need to handle input. So read an integer X. Then perform the sieve, then loop from X upwards until we find a prime.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In C, array sizes can't be dynamically set unless using dynamic allocation. But in Python, it's size 100010. So in C, we can declare a static array. Let's see: 100010 is manageable on the stack? Well, 100010 elements of bool (which is 1 byte each), that's about 100KB. Stack size is usually around 1MB, so it's okay. Alternatively, use static or global array to avoid stack overflow. But in the Python code, the sieve is built inside the main code, so perhaps in C, the array is declared in main. Let's see.\n\nSo code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h> // for bool type\n\nint main() {\n    int X;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &X);\n    bool prime[100010];\n    // Initialize prime array\n    for (int i=0; i<100010; i++) prime[i] = true;\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = false;\n    for (int i=4; i<100010; i +=2) prime[i] = false;\n    for (int i=3; i*i <=100008; i +=2) {\n        if (prime[i]) {\n            for (int j = i*2; j <=100008; j +=i) {\n                prime[j] = false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // Now find the first prime >= X\n    for (int i = X; ;i++) {\n        if (i >=100010) break; // wait, original Python code goes up to 100008. So maybe in C, the loop should check up to 100008?\n        if (prime[i]) {\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, in Python, the sieve's maximum index is 100009 (since size 100010), but when marking even numbers, they go up to 100009. Then, the sieve for i in 3 to sqrt(100008) (since i*i <=100008). Then for j in i+i to 100008, step i. So the maximum j in the sieve loops is 100008. So in the C code, the array is 100010 elements, but the sieve marks up to 100008. Then, when checking for primes, in the loop for i from X to 100008. So in C, after building the sieve, the code should loop i from X to 100008, inclusive, and find the first prime. If none is found, then perhaps the code may not find anything, but according to the problem statement, there must be one.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the loop is for i in range(X, 100008). Wait, no: the upper limit in range is exclusive. So range(X, 100008) checks X, X+1,..., 100007. So in C, the loop should be for (i = X; i < 100008; i++). But in the Python code, after that loop, if not found, perhaps the code breaks? Wait, the original Python code's loop is for i in range(X, 100008). So if in that range there's a prime, it prints and breaks. Otherwise, the loop ends. But then, the code may not find a prime. However, the code seems to generate primes up to 100008, and the loop goes up to 100008, but the upper limit is exclusive. Wait, in the Python code, the sieve is for numbers up to 100009 (since the array is size 100010, indexes 0 to 100009). But the sieve marks all primes up to 100008. Wait, the sieve marks primes up to 100009? Because in the even loop, they go up to 100009 (since i runs up to 100010-1=100009). Then, the sieve for i starts at 3, and for each i, marks multiples up to 100008 (as per the loop j in range(i+i, 100008, i), which is up to j <100008). So the sieve may not mark 100009 as a non-prime. Hmm, perhaps the sieve in the Python code has a mistake. Because 100009 is an odd number, but if it's a prime, it would not be marked. But perhaps the code as written in Python may have an error here. But maybe the original code is correct. Let's think: for the sieve, when i starts at 3 and runs up to sqrt(100008). Since 317 squared is 100489, which is larger than 100008. So the sieve's i runs up to 316. Then, during the sieve process, for each i, the multiples are marked up to j = i+i, then j +=i until j reaches 100008. So 100009 is not touched here. So 100009 is considered as a possible prime. So when the loop for i in range(X, 100008) is done, if X is 100008, then the loop checks 100008 (but since 100008 is even and >=4, it's marked as not prime). So in that case, the loop would check 100008, which is not prime, and then the loop would end. Then, the code would not find any prime. But the sieve array includes 100009, which may be a prime. However, in the Python code, the loop for checking primes starts at X and goes up to 100008 (exclusive), so if X is 100009, then the loop would check 100009 (since the loop is range(X, 100008), but if X is 100009, then the start is 100009 and the end is 100008, so the loop doesn't execute. So this would be a problem.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the sieve array is of size 100010, so indexes 0 to 100009. The code marks primes up to 100009. However, when generating primes, the code starts at X and increments until it finds a prime. But in the loop, the upper limit is 100008. Wait, in the Python code, the loop is for i in range(X, 100008). So the upper limit is 100008, which is not included. So the loop checks X, X+1, ..., 100007. If none of those are primes, then the loop ends and the code doesn't print anything. But the sieve array includes primes up to 100009. So perhaps there's a mistake here. For example, if X is 100007, then the loop checks 100007, but 100007 could be a prime. If that's not the case, then the code would check 100008 (but that's even and marked as non-prime). Then the loop ends, and the code would not find a prime. But according to the sieve, the next prime after X might be 100009. But the code doesn't check that. So perhaps the original Python code has a bug here, and the loop should be up to 100010. But that's probably not. Or maybe the sieve is designed such that there's always a prime between X and 100008. But that's not necessarily true. So the code may fail for X larger than 100008. But perhaps the problem statement ensures that X is small enough so that there's a prime in the sieve's range. But regardless, in the C code, perhaps we need to loop up to 100008 (inclusive) or adjust the upper limit.\n\nBut according to the original code, the sieve is for primes up to 100008. So in the Python code, the sieve is set up for primes up to 100008, and the loop checks up to 100007. Then, if X is 100009, the loop would start at 100009 and check up to 100007, which is invalid, so it doesn't run. So the code may have a bug here. But perhaps the original code was intended to have the loop check up to 100008 inclusive, but the range in Python is exclusive. So the original code's loop may not check 100008. Hmm. So perhaps the original code's sieve is up to 100009, but the loop checks up to 100008 (exclusive), which would check up to 100007. So maybe the code is incorrect. But perhaps the code is correct in the original problem's context, and we just need to replicate it.\n\nBut for the purpose of translating to C, perhaps the code should mirror the original logic. So in the C code, the loop for checking primes should start at X and go up to 100007, but that may miss primes. So perhaps the original code has a mistake. But perhaps the code is correct. Let's proceed.\n\nIn the original Python code, the sieve is built for numbers up to 100009 (since the array is size 100010). Then, in the sieve steps, even numbers up to 100009 are marked as non-prime. Then for odd i up to sqrt(100008), their multiples up to 100008 are marked. So 100009 is not marked in the sieve. So if 100009 is a prime, then it's considered prime. But the loop in the code for checking starts at X and goes up to 100008 (exclusive). So if X is 100009, the loop doesn't execute. So the code will crash? Or not output anything. But perhaps the problem's constraints are such that X is <= 100008. So in the code, the upper limit is 100008. So when translating to C, the loop for checking should loop from X to 100008 inclusive. Wait, no: in Python, range(X, 100008) includes X, X+1, ..., 100007. So the loop checks up to 100007. So in C, the loop should run from X to 100007, inclusive. But then, if X is 100008, the loop runs from 100008 to 100007, which is not possible. So the code would not check anything, leading to no output. But perhaps the original code is intended to check up to 100008. So maybe there's a mistake in the upper limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's sieve is up to 100008, but the array is 100010. Hmm, maybe the sieve code in Python has an error, but the code is working for the intended problem. So when translating, perhaps the loop in the C code should go up to 100008 inclusive, and check up to that. So in the loop for checking primes, in C, the code would loop i from X to 100008 inclusive. So in C, the code would have:\n\nfor (int i = X; i <= 100008; i++) { ... }\n\nBut in Python, the loop is range(X, 100008), which is up to 100007. So this is a discrepancy. So perhaps the original code has a mistake here. For example, in the sieve, the array is 100010, but the sieve is built up to 100008, and the loop for checking is up to 100008-1. But in C, if the code loops up to 100008 inclusive, then it's possible to check a number beyond the sieve's processed range.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. In the sieve processing:\n\nEven numbers are marked up to 100009. Then, for the sieve steps:\n\ni starts at 3, and loops while i*i <= 100008. So the maximum i considered is sqrt(100008) \u2248 316. Then, for each i, j starts at i*2 and steps by i up to 100008 (exclusive). So j in range(i+i, 100008, i) in Python is j from 2i to 100007, step i. So all multiples of i up to 100007 are marked. So primes up to 100008 are not necessarily all marked. For example, 100008 is even, so marked as non-prime. But 100009 is not processed by the sieve steps. So if 100009 is a prime, it's not marked as non-prime. So in the sieve array, prime[100009] is True (if it's a prime). But in the original Python code, when X is 100009, the loop for i in range(X, 100008) doesn't run, so the code doesn't print anything. But perhaps the original code's sieve is supposed to handle primes up to 100009, but the loop for checking is wrong.\n\nThis is a possible error in the original code. But as a translator, I need to replicate the code's logic, even if it's possibly incorrect.\n\nTherefore, in the C code:\n\n- The sieve array is of size 100010.\n\n- Initialize all to true, then mark 0 and 1 as false.\n\n- Mark even numbers >=4 as false.\n\n- For i from 3, while i*i <= 100008:\n\n   - if prime[i], mark all multiples of i starting from i*2, up to 100008, step i.\n\nSo in C:\n\nfor (i = 3; i * i <= 100008; i += 2) {\n   if (prime[i]) {\n       for (j = i * 2; j <= 100008; j += i) {\n           prime[j] = false;\n       }\n   }\n}\n\nThen, when checking for primes, the code loops from X to 100008, inclusive? Or up to 100008 exclusive?\n\nIn Python, the loop is for i in range(X, 100008), which is X <= i < 100008. So in C, the loop is:\n\nfor (i = X; i < 100008; i++) {\n\n   if (prime[i]) { ... }\n\n}\n\nBut if this loop doesn't find any primes, the code would not print anything. But in the problem's context, perhaps X is such that there's a prime in that range. But to replicate the original code's behavior, even if it's incorrect, we have to proceed.\n\nNow, in the C code, we have to handle the sieve correctly.\n\nAnother point: in the original code, after building the sieve, the code starts at X and checks each number upwards until it finds a prime. So in C, the code should loop from X upwards until it finds a prime in the sieve array.\n\nBut the original Python code's loop is up to 100008 (exclusive). So if X is 100008, the loop runs once (i=100008), but since the sieve's array has 100010 elements, but the sieve for j is up to 100008. So 100008 is even, so marked as non-prime. So the code will check i up to 100007. But what if X is 100007, and 100007 is not a prime, then the code would check up to 100007, but if 100008 is not prime, then the loop ends and nothing is printed.\n\nBut according to the original code's sieve, primes up to 100008 are marked. So perhaps the code should loop up to 100009. But that's not the case. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. But as a translator, I need to mirror the original code's logic, even if it's possibly flawed.\n\nSo, in C:\n\nThe sieve array is of size 100010, indexes 0 to 100009.\n\nMark 0 and 1 as non-prime.\n\nMark even numbers >=4 as non-prime up to 100009.\n\nFor i from 3, up to sqrt(100008), step 2:\n\n   if prime[i], mark multiples of i from 2i up to 100008 as non-prime.\n\nThen, the code checks from X to 100008 (exclusive) for the first prime.\n\nSo, in C, the loop for checking primes is:\n\nfor (i = X; i < 100008; i++) {\n\n   if (prime[i]) { ... break; }\n\n}\n\nBut if this loop doesn't find a prime, the code will not print anything, but according to the original code, there is a prime in that range. But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that X is such that there is a prime in that range.\n\nIn any case, translating the code as per the original logic.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, including necessary headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nWait, the code uses sqrt(100008) in the loop condition. Wait, the original code uses i*i <= 100008. So in C, the loop condition is i*i <= 100008. But in C, integers can be used directly. So the code will have:\n\nint i =3;\nwhile (i*i <= 100008) {\n\nBut perhaps it's better to calculate 100008's square root once, but the original code uses a dynamic check. So the code can proceed as in Python.\n\nBut in C, 100008 is an integer, so i*i will be compared.\n\nSo the code:\n\nfor (i =3; i*i <= 100008; ) {\n\nBut wait, the original code increments i by 2 each time. So in C, the loop is:\n\ni =3;\nwhile (i*i <= 100008) {\n    if (prime[i]) {\n        for (j = i*2; j <= 100008; j +=i) {\n            prime[j] = false;\n        }\n    }\n    i +=2;\n}\n\nYes, because in Python, the i starts at 3, and increments by 2 each iteration (since even numbers are handled already). So in C, the loop is a while loop, not a for loop, since the step is not uniform (but it's adding 2 each time).\n\nSo in C:\n\ni =3;\nwhile (i*i <= 100008) {\n    if (prime[i]) {\n        for (int j = i*2; j <= 100008; j +=i) {\n            prime[j] = false;\n        }\n    }\n    i +=2;\n}\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int X;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &X);\n\n    bool prime[100010];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100010; i++) {\n        prime[i] = true;\n    }\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = false;\n    for (int i = 4; i < 100010; i +=2) {\n        prime[i] = false;\n    }\n\n    int i =3;\n    while (i*i <= 100008) {\n        if (prime[i]) {\n            for (int j = i*2; j <= 100008; j +=i) {\n                prime[j] = false;\n            }\n        }\n        i +=2;\n    }\n\n    for (int j = X; ; j++) {\n        if (prime[j]) {\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the original code, the loop for checking starts at X and goes up to 100008 (exclusive). So in the Python code, if X is 100009, the loop doesn't run, but the sieve array has prime[100009] as true if it is a prime. But the loop doesn't check it. So the code may crash or not find the prime. But according to the original code's logic, the code would loop from X to 100008 (exclusive). However, in the C code above, the loop is written as for (int j = X; ; j++) { ... }, which is an infinite loop until a prime is found. But that's different from the original code. Oh wait, looking back at the original code:\n\nOriginal Python code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(X, 100008):\n    if prime[i]:\n        print(i)\n        break\n\nSo the loop runs from X to 100007 (inclusive). If no prime is found in that range, the loop ends, and the code proceeds to the next line. But there is no code after that. So the code may not output anything. But according to the problem's statement, perhaps X is such that there's a prime in that range. However, in the C code, the code loops from X upwards indefinitely until a prime is found, which may not be in the sieve array, leading to accessing out of bounds (if j exceeds 100009). So the code may crash.\n\nWait, no. Because in the sieve array, the primes are marked up to 100009. So the loop in the C code checks j starting from X, incrementing until it finds a prime. But if X is 100009, then j starts there. If j is 100009 and prime[j] is true, then it's printed. But if j exceeds 100009 (like j=100010), then the array is of size 100010, so j=100010 is out of bounds. So in C, accessing prime[j] where j is >=100010 is undefined behavior. So the code has a potential buffer overflow.\n\nSo to replicate the original code's behavior, the C code's loop should only check up to 100008 (exclusive), i.e., j up to 100007. But the original code's sieve may have primes beyond that. So perhaps the code in C should loop up to 100008 (exclusive). So the code should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nBut if no such j is found, then the code exits without printing. But according to the problem's statement, there is always a prime in the sieve's range. So perhaps the original code has a mistake, but the problem's constraints ensure that X is such that a prime exists in that range. But in the C code, to avoid accessing out of bounds, the loop should check up to 100008 (exclusive). However, in the original code, the loop may check j=100008 if X is 100008. Because in Python, range(X, 100008) would be from X to 100007 if X is less than 100008. For example, X=100007: the loop checks 100007. X=100008: the loop checks nothing. So the code would not print anything. But the sieve array has primes up to 100009. So perhaps the original code's loop should have been up to 100010. But that's not the case.\n\nBut as a translator, the code should be as close as possible. So the original code's loop is up to 100008 (exclusive), so in C, the loop should be from X to 100008-1 (100007). So in C:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// If no prime found, then according to the problem, there is none. But that's impossible.\n\nBut in the original code, the sieve is built up to 100009, but the code may not check it. So perhaps the original code has a bug, but the C code should mirror it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's sieve is up to 100008, and the array is of size 100010 to avoid index errors. But regardless, the C code's loop should replicate the Python code's logic.\n\nSo in C, the loop should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n\nBut if X is 100008, the loop doesn't run. So the code may have no output, leading to undefined behavior. But according to the problem's statement, this case may not happen.\n\nBut the original code is written as such. Therefore, the C code should replicate that.\n\nBut looking back at the original code, after building the sieve, the loop is:\n\nfor i in range(X, 100008):\n    if prime[i]:\n        print(i)\n        break\n\nBut if X is 100008, the loop is range(100008, 100008) which is empty. So the code would not print anything. But the sieve array has prime[100008] as False (since it's even). So if X is 100008, the code would not print anything, but that's impossible because the problem expects to find the next prime. So there's a mistake in the original code's loop upper limit.\n\nSo perhaps the loop should be up to 100010. But the original code's loop is up to 100008. So this is a mistake. But as a translator, I must replicate it.\n\nTherefore, the correct translation would have the loop in C as j from X to 100007, and if not found, perhaps the code would have undefined behavior. But according to the problem's statement, there is a prime in the sieve's range. So perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the original code, the sieve is up to 100008, but the array is 100010 in size. Then, the loop for j in range(X, 100008) would check up to 100007. So the code may miss primes between 100008 and 100010, but according to the sieve's setup, those are not marked.\n\nThis is a possible error, but as a translator, the code should be mirrored.\n\nThus, the final C code should:\n\n- Declare the sieve array of size 100010.\n\n- Initialize primes as in the Python code.\n\n- Then, check from X up to 100007.\n\nBut in the original code, the loop for i in range(X, 100008) would include X up to 100007. So the C code's loop should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n\n   if (prime[j]) { ... }\n\n}\n\nBut if X is 100008, the loop doesn't run, leading to no output. But according to the problem's constraints, X is such that there's a prime in the range. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the original code's sieve, the sieve array is built up to 100009. So the code in C could have j up to 100009, but the original code's loop doesn't check that. So this is a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the original code. For example, the sieve's upper limit should be 100008, but the code marks up to 100009. Or perhaps the loop should check up to 100010. But without knowing the problem's context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn any case, the correct translation is to mirror the original code's logic.\n\nSo the correct C code is as follows:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int X;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &X);\n\n    bool prime[100010];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100010; i++) {\n        prime[i] = true;\n    }\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = false;\n    for (int i = 4; i < 100010; i += 2) {\n        prime[i] = false;\n    }\n\n    int i = 3;\n    while (i * i <= 100008) {\n        if (prime[i]) {\n            for (int j = i * 2; j <= 100008; j += i) {\n                prime[j] = false;\n            }\n        }\n        i += 2;\n    }\n\n    for (int j = X; ; j++) {\n        if (prime[j]) {\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, no! Because in the C code, the loop for checking j is an infinite loop, starting at X and incrementing until a prime is found. But the original Python code's loop is up to 100008 (exclusive). So the C code's loop is different. This is a mistake in the translation.\n\nThe original Python code's loop:\n\nfor i in range(X, 100008):\n    if prime[i]:\n        print(i)\n        break\n\nThis loop will exit after checking up to 100007. So in C, the loop should be:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// If no prime found in this range, the code would proceed. But according to the problem's statement, there must be one. So the code may not handle this case.\n\nBut the original Python code uses a for loop with a fixed upper limit. So in C, the code must replicate that. Otherwise, for cases where X is 100009, the C code would loop j=100009, which is beyond the sieve's processed range (since the sieve marks up to 100008). So the code would access prime[j], which is beyond the sieve's processed j (100008). For example, j=100009 may be a prime, but the sieve didn't process it. So in the sieve's initialization steps:\n\n- j=100009 is even? No, 100009 is odd. So in the sieve, even numbers >=4 are marked as non-prime, but 100009 is odd, so it was initialized to true. Then, during the sieve steps, i runs up to sqrt(100008) which is 316. For j=100009, if it's a multiple of any prime i <=316, then it would be marked as non-prime. Otherwise, it remains true.\n\nBut in the original code, the sieve's loop for j runs up to 100008. So for example, 100009 is a prime number, but the sieve code doesn't mark it. So prime[100009] would be true if it's a prime. So in the C code, the loop for j from X to infinity would check j=100009, which is outside the sieve's processing. But the sieve's array is size 100010, so j=100009 is within the array. So the code would check it.\n\nBut the original code's loop only checks up to 100007. So this is a discrepancy between the C code and the Python code.\n\nThus, the correct translation would be to have the loop in C check j from X to 100007, inclusive. So in C:\n\nfor (int j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n    if (prime[j]) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// If no prime found, but according to the problem, there is one.\n\nBut then, in cases where X is 100009, the loop doesn't run. But the sieve array may have prime[100009] as true. So the code would not print anything, but the correct result would be 100009.\n\nSo the original code has a bug here, but as a translator, I must replicate it. Therefore, the C code should have the loop up to 100008 (exclusive).\n\nBut looking back at the Python code, the sieve's array is 100010 elements, indexes 0-100009. The sieve marks even numbers up to 100009. Then, for odd i up to sqrt(100008), their multiples up to 100008 are marked. So for j=100009, it's not marked by the sieve steps. So if it's a prime, it's not marked. So in the sieve array, prime[100009] is true. But the loop in the original code doesn't check it.\n\nSo the code will fail for X >= 100008. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps X is <= 100008. So the code is correct.\n\nIn any case, the correct translation should mirror the original code's logic, even if it's incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct C code is:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int X;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &X);\n\n    bool prime[100010];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100010; ++i) {\n        prime[i] = true;\n    }\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = false;\n    for (int i = 4; i < 100010; i += 2) {\n        prime[i] = false;\n    }\n\n    int i = 3;\n    while (i * i <= 100008) {\n        if (prime[i]) {\n            for (int j = i * 2; j <= 100008; j += i) {\n                prime[j] = false;\n            }\n        }\n        i += 2;\n    }\n\n    for (int j = X; j < 100008; ++j) {\n        if (prime[j]) {\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", j);\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If no prime found in the loop, which shouldn't happen\n    // Check if 100008 or higher is a prime, but according to the code's logic, it's not necessary.\n    // However, the original Python code may have missed this, so in C, to mirror the code, we proceed.\n    // But since the problem ensures a prime exists, perhaps this part is unreachable.\n    // To handle all cases, maybe the code should check up to 100009.\n    // But according to the original code, it doesn't.\n    // So the code as per translation would fail here.\n    // But the problem may ensure that X is such that a prime exists in the loop's range.\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, the original Python code's loop is for i in range(X, 100008):, which in Python is up to 100007. So in C, the loop should be j from X to 100007. So the C loop is:\n\nfor (j = X; j < 100008; j++) {\n\n}\n\nYes, because 100008 is the upper exclusive limit.\n\nSo the code should loop j from X to 100007. If no prime is found, then the code would not print anything, but according to the problem's constraints, this case does not occur.\n\nThus, the correct translation is as written."
