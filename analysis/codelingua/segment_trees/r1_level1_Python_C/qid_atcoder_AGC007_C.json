So in C, when we use N in the calculations, we have to make sure that during the first iteration, N is the original value. Because in Python, the loop is while N: which checks if N is non-zero. Then, in the loop body, N is decremented by 1. So for example, if N starts at 3, the loop runs 3 times with N=3, 2, 1. In the C code, the loop condition is while (N > 0). So for N=3, it's true. Then inside the loop, the code uses N in the calculations, then N is decremented. So that's correct. But in the loop's body, the first thing is adding to ret using the current N. Then, the next lines compute d and x using N (current value), and then N is decremented. So that's correct. So the C code should have:\n\nwhile (N > 0) {\n    // use current N\n    ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n    // compute new d and x based on current N\n    d = d + (d / N) + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n    x = x + (2 * x) / N;\n    // decrement N\n    N--;\n} Yes.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's look at the Python code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Python code reads input using sys.stdin.buffer.read. It reads N, d, x from the input. Then there's a function main that performs some calculations in a loop based on N, and finally prints the result.\n\nIn C, I need to handle input differently. Instead of reading from sys.stdin.buffer, I'll use scanf to read the three integers N, d, x. Wait, but in Python, the variables d and x are being treated as floats because the calculations involve divisions. Oh right, in the Python code, when they split the input, they get integers, but during the loop, d and x become floats. So in C, I should declare them as double variables to handle the floating-point operations.\n\nSo the variables N is an integer, but d and x are doubles. So when reading with scanf, I need to read them as doubles. Wait, the input comes as integers? Or maybe they are given as floating points? The original code uses map(int, ...), which implies that the input values are integers. Wait, looking back: the Python code uses map(int, read().split()), so N, d, x are integers. But in the main function, during the calculations, they are used in floating-point operations, so in C, I need to cast them to doubles.\n\nSo in C, the initial values of d and x are integers but stored as doubles. So during input, I'll read them as integers and then assign to double variables. Alternatively, maybe read them as doubles directly. Wait, but if the input is integers, like 1 2 3, then reading them as %d for N and %lf for d and x might not work. Wait, no. If the user inputs integers, but in the code, d and x are doubles, then in C, if I read them as integers, they would lose the decimal part. But the Python code treats them as integers initially. Wait, in the original code, N, d, x are integers. Then in the loop, they are involved in floating-point operations. So in C, N should be an int, and d and x should be doubles. So I need to read d and x as integers and then convert them to doubles. Or maybe read them as doubles using %lf. But if the input is given as integers, like 5 2 3, then reading with %lf would still work. So perhaps in C, I can read them as doubles directly. Let's think: the input is three integers separated by spaces. So when using scanf with %d for N and %lf for d and x, but if the user inputs integers, like 5 2 3, then d and x would be 2.0 and 3.0, which is correct. Wait, no: the format specifier for integers is %d, and for doubles is %lf. So in the input, if the original code reads them as integers, then in C, the variables d and x should be read as integers and then converted to doubles. For example, in Python, they start as integers, but during the loop, they are promoted to floats. So in C, the code should read N as int, and d and x as int, then cast to double for the calculations. Or perhaps read them as doubles. Let's see: suppose the input is three integers. So for example, input line is \"3 4 5\". In Python, the code would read N=3 (int), d=4 (int), x=5 (int). Then, during the main function, these are used in calculations where they become floats. So in C, if we read d and x as integers (int variables), then when we assign them to a double, they would be converted. But perhaps it's easier to read them as doubles. But the input is integers, so using %lf would read them as doubles. For example, if the input is 3 4 5, then scanf(\"%d %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x) would read N as 3, d as 4.0, x as 5.0. That's correct. So in C, the variables N is int, d and x are doubles.\n\nSo the C code would start with:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    double d, x;\n    scanf(\"%d %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n    // then the main logic\n\n}\n\nThen, the main function in Python is a loop that starts with N, and decrements it each time. The loop runs while N is non-zero. So in C, perhaps a while loop: while (N > 0) { ...; N--; }\n\nInside the loop:\n\nret is a double that starts at 0.0. So we need to declare it as double ret = 0.0;\n\nEach iteration adds to ret: ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n\nThen, d is updated: d = d + (d / N) + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n\nThen x is updated: x += 2 * x / N;\n\nThen N decreases by 1.\n\nWait, in Python, N is an integer, but during the calculation, when used in (N - 0.5), it becomes a float. But in C, N is an integer, so when we compute (N - 0.5), it would be promoted to a double. So in C, the code will be:\n\nret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndouble ret = 0.0;\nwhile (N) { // or N > 0\n    ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n    d = d + (d / N) + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n    x = x + (2 * x) / N;\n    N--;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, N is being modified in the loop. So in C, when we use N in the calculations, we have to make sure that during the first iteration, N is the original value. Because in Python, the loop is while N: which checks if N is non-zero. Then, in the loop body, N is decremented by 1. So for example, if N starts at 3, the loop runs 3 times with N=3, 2, 1.\n\nIn the C code, the loop condition is while (N > 0). So for N=3, it's true. Then inside the loop, the code uses N in the calculations, then N is decremented. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the loop's body, the first thing is adding to ret using the current N. Then, the next lines compute d and x using N (current value), and then N is decremented. So that's correct.\n\nSo the C code should have:\n\nwhile (N > 0) {\n    // use current N\n    ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n    // compute new d and x based on current N\n    d = d + (d / N) + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n    x = x + (2 * x) / N;\n    // decrement N\n    N--;\n}\n\nYes.\n\nOnce the loop is done, print ret with sufficient precision. Since in Python the print statement outputs the floating-point number, perhaps using printf with %f or %g format specifier. But to match Python's default print behavior, which for a float would print as many digits as needed. For example, if the result is an integer, it would print as .0, otherwise with decimal digits.\n\nIn C, using printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ret); would print with 10 decimal digits, but perhaps we should use a higher precision. Alternatively, using %g which automatically chooses between %e and %f. However, to ensure that all significant digits are printed, perhaps using %.15f or something like that. Alternatively, using printf(\"%f\\n\", ret); but in C, the default for %f is 6 decimal places, which might not be enough. The Python code's print statement for a float would print all significant digits, perhaps using scientific notation if needed.\n\nSo in C, to get the same output as Python, perhaps we can use printf(\"%.15g\", ret); which uses up to 15 significant digits. Let's check: for example, in Python, print(123.45678901234567890) would print 123.45678901234568. So using %.15g in C would output 15 significant digits, which is similar.\n\nSo the final C code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    double d, x;\n    scanf(\"%d %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n    double ret = 0.0;\n\n    while (N > 0) {\n        ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n        d += d / N + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n        x += (2 * x) / N;\n        N--;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ret);\n    // Or using %g to avoid trailing zeros, but need to ensure enough precision.\n    // Alternatively, use %.15f\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the variables d and x are being updated in each iteration. The order is:\n\nret += ... using current d and x.\n\nThen d and x are updated.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs would be good. For example, let's see the sample input.\n\nBut since the user didn't provide sample inputs, maybe we can consider possible values.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in C, integer division is different from floating-point. But in the code, all divisions are done using variables that are doubles. For example, when N is an integer, but in the code, N is cast to a double when used in division. So when N is 3, 5*x/(2*N) becomes (5*x)/(2*3), etc. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct. The final step is to print ret with enough decimal digits. Using printf(\"%.10f\\n\", ret); would give 10 decimal digits, which might be sufficient. Alternatively, using printf(\"%.15g\\n\", ret); which uses up to 15 significant digits and omits trailing zeros. Since in Python, printing a float would show as many digits as needed, using %g in C might be more accurate. Let's choose %f with enough decimal places. Let's see: in Python, for example, if the result is 10.5, it would print as 10.5. Using %.10f would print 10.5000000000, but Python's print would show 10.5. Hmm. So perhaps using %g would be better to avoid trailing zeros. But the problem is that %g in C may switch to scientific notation for very small or large numbers. But the original Python code uses print(ret), which would not use scientific notation for numbers in a certain range. So perhaps using a format that matches Python's default.\n\nAlternatively, in C, to match Python's print of a float, which for a number like 123.456 would print as 123.456, but if it's something like 123.4567890123456789, it would print as 123.45678901234568 (with limited precision). So in C, perhaps using %.15f would print 15 decimal digits, which may capture all the precision of the double, but doubles have about 15-17 significant digits. So using %.15g would print up to 15 significant digits, using fixed or exponential notation. For example, numbers between 0.0001 and 100000 would be printed in fixed notation. That's probably better.\n\nSo the printf line would be:\n\nprintf(\"%.15g\\n\", ret);\n\nBut let's see. For example, if ret is 123.456, then %.15g would output 123.456. If it's 123.4567890123456, then it would print that with 15 digits. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final code would use printf with %.15g.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    double d, x;\n    scanf(\"%d %lf %lf\", &N, &d, &x);\n\n    double ret = 0.0;\n\n    while (N > 0) {\n        ret += d + (N - 0.5) * x;\n        d += (d / N) + (5 * x) / (2 * N);\n        x += (2 * x) / N;\n        N--;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%.15g\\n\", ret);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThat should be the correct translation."
