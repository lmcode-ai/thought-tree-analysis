Because, for example, if m=3, and len(y) is 2, and day=1 (r=1 >=1), then you add, len(y) becomes 3. Next job: r=0. So if day is 0, then condition is true (0 >=0), add and len(y) becomes 4. Which is more than m=3. Wait, but that's impossible. Because r = m - len(y). So if len(y) is 3, then r=0. So for the next job, the condition is r >= day \u2192 0 >= day. So if day is 0, then 0 >=0 is true. So you add, making len(y) 4, which exceeds m. But the Python code doesn't have a check for that. So perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the code is intended to collect up to m jobs.",

Let me think again. Wait, when you process each job:\n\nIf the job's day <= r (remaining slots), then add to y. So len(y) increases by 1. This could potentially make len(y) exceed m. For example, if m=3, and len(y) is 3. Then r=0. If the job's day is 0, then 0 >=0 \u2192 add, len(y) becomes 4. Then the code doesn't pop. So in the end, the code would have y's size of 4, but when you sum it, you take all 4. But that's not correct. So perhaps there's a mistake in the original code. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the initial problem allows selecting any number of jobs as long as their deadlines are <= the available days. But in that case, the code's approach is not obvious. But perhaps the original code is correct. Let's look at the test case. For example, let's say n=3, m=2. Jobs:\n\nJob 1: day=3, salary=10\n\nJob 2: day=2, salary=20\n\nJob 3: day=1, salary=30 The code processes the jobs in order of day descending: 3, 2, 1. Processing job 1 (day=3, salary=10):\n\nr = 2 - 0 =2. 3 <=2? No. So else clause. Push 10 to y (now y has [10]), then pop. y becomes empty. So after this, y is empty. Processing job 2 (day=2, salary=20):\n\nr=2 -0=2. day=2 <=2 \u2192 yes. Push 20 to y. len(y) is 1. Processing job3 (day=1, salary=30):\n\nr=2-1=1. day=1 < =1 \u2192 yes. Push 30. len(y) is 2. sum is 50. So the total is 50. Which is correct, as selecting days 2 and1: sum 20+30=50. But if the code is correct in this case. Another example: m=2. Jobs:\n\nJob1: day=3, salary=100.\n\nJob2: day=2, salary=50. Job3: day=1, salary=10. Processing job1 (day3, 100):\n\nr=2. day3>2 \u2192 else clause. Push 100 to y (size1), then pop. So y is empty. Job2 (day2, 50):\n\nr=2. day2<=2 \u2192 yes. Push 50. y size1. Job3 (day1, 10): r=1. day1<=1 \u2192 yes. Push10. y size2. Sum is 60. But the optimal selection would be job1 and job2, but job1's day3 is larger than 2, so can't be scheduled.",

After pushing, it's k+1. Then popping makes it k again. So the code in the else case does not change the size of y. So the only way the size of y increases is through the if case. Thus, the maximum size of y is m. Because when the if case is true, the code adds a new element, increasing the size by 1. But when the size of y reaches m, the next if case would require r >= day. But r = m - len(y) \u2192 if len(y) is m, r is 0. So for a job's day to be <=0, which is possible only if day is 0. So in such a case, the if case would be true, allowing the code to add to y, making the size m+1. But then, in the else case, the code would add and pop. But this seems to be a problem. So perhaps the original code's logic is incorrect, but I need to follow it. So in the C code, for each job:\n\nIf the remaining slots (r = m - current y size) >= job's day \u2192 add to y.\n\nElse \u2192 add to y, then remove the smallest salary from y (so size remains the same).

So when pushing a job with a higher day, it bubbles up. But the original Python code processes jobs in order of descending day. So this part is correct. In the main loop, after popping a job from x, we compute r = m - y_size (current size of y). If r >= job.day, we add the salary to y. Else, add and pop. This mirrors the Python code. Then, after processing all jobs, sum all elements in y_heap. Thus, this should be the correct translation.",

But the code's approach may be correct for the problem of scheduling jobs with deadlines and profits, where each job takes 1 day, and you can't have more than m jobs. So the maximum number of jobs is m, and each job's deadline must be at least the number of days remaining. But how does the code ensure that the deadlines are met? Because when a job is added, it's assumed to take the latest possible day (r). So if a job's deadline is >= r, then it can be scheduled on day r. So by processing in order of deadline descending, the code greedily takes the highest possible deadline jobs first, ensuring that the selection is optimal. But the code's logic for handling when the job's day is larger than the available days is to add it to the heap and then remove the smallest element.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code to C. Let me read through the Python code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nSo the code uses heapq to manage two heaps, x and y. The input is n and m, then n entries of day and salary. The Python code pushes negative day and salary into heap x. Then, it processes each element from x. For each element, it checks if the remaining slots (m minus the current size of y) are greater than or equal to the day (but since d is negative, maybe it's comparing the positive value). If there's enough space, it pushes the negative salary into y. Otherwise, it pushes and then pops the smallest in y, which effectively keeps the largest m salaries.\n\nThe goal is to select up to m jobs such that their total days are <= m, and maximize the sum of salaries. Wait, no. Wait, the days here might be part of the selection criteria. Let me think again. The original problem seems to be selecting jobs where each job has a day requirement (how many days it takes to complete) and a salary. We can select a subset of jobs such that the sum of their days is <= m, but we can take at most m jobs (since each job takes at least 1 day). Or perhaps the problem is that each job takes 'day' days, and we can select any number of jobs as long as the total days are <= m. But the code is using a greedy approach here.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nWhen processing each element from x (sorted by day descending, since stored as negative), for each job, we check if the remaining slots (r = m - len(y)) is >= -d (so the day of the job). If there's enough space, we add it to y. Otherwise, we add it but then remove the smallest salary in y. Wait, but y is a min-heap, so popping the smallest would keep the largest elements. So the algorithm's approach is to process jobs in order of decreasing day. For each job, if adding it (using its day) doesn't exceed the remaining available days (which is r here, but r is m - len(y)), which implies that each job takes exactly 1 day? Or maybe the day here is the number of days required to do the job, and the total allowed days is m. But how does the code track the sum of days? Because in the code, when adding a job, it's considering whether the remaining slots (r) is >= the job's day. So perhaps each job takes 'd' days, and we can't have the sum of days exceed m. Wait, but in the code, the condition is if r >= -d. So for example, if d is -5 (original day is 5), then -d is 5. The remaining slots r is m - len(y). So if r >= 5, then we can add the job. Otherwise, we add it and then pop the smallest. But this approach would not account for the sum of days. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem must be that each job takes a certain number of days (day), and you can do the job on day 'day' (like the job must be scheduled by day 'day'). So the algorithm selects jobs such that each job's day is <= m (since the jobs are processed in order of day descending). Then, the algorithm keeps the top m salaries. Because when you process jobs in order of day descending, once the day is >= the remaining available days (m - len(y)), you can include it, but if you can't, you compare with the smallest in the current top salaries and replace if necessary.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is: select up to m jobs where the day of each job is <= the number of days you have. For example, you can't select a job that requires 5 days if you have only 3 days left. But since the jobs are sorted by day descending, once you process a job with day D, the remaining available days is m - current count of selected jobs. So if D <= (m - count), then you can take the job. Otherwise, you can't. But that's not exactly correct. Because if you take a job with day D, that requires that D <= remaining days. But the remaining days is m - count (since each job takes 1 day? No, maybe the days here are the deadline. Oh, perhaps the problem is scheduling jobs with deadlines and profits, and you can select as many as possible but each job must be scheduled before its deadline. The goal is to maximize the profit. But this is similar to the classic weighted interval scheduling problem. Alternatively, it's the problem where each job has a deadline and profit, and you can schedule each job in one day. The total number of days is up to m. So you want to select jobs such that you can schedule them all by their deadlines, and maximize the total profit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the \"scheduling jobs with deadlines\" problem. The standard approach for that problem is to process jobs in order of descending profit, and assign each job to the latest possible day before its deadline that is still available. However, the code here is using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to process jobs in order of decreasing deadline. For each job, if there is enough space (remaining days >= current job's deadline), add it to the selected list. Otherwise, check if adding this job (and replacing the smallest profit in the current list) increases the total profit.\n\nWait, the code uses a max-heap (by storing negative salaries) to track the top m salaries. Let me try to re-express the Python code:\n\nx is a max-heap based on day (since day is stored as negative). So when we pop from x, we get the job with the largest day first.\n\ny is a min-heap (since we push -salary, then the smallest -salary is popped first, which corresponds to the largest salary). So y contains the current selected salaries, with the smallest (in terms of actual salary) at the top.\n\nFor each job in x (processed in order of largest day):\n\n- The remaining available slots is r = m - len(y). So initially, when y is empty, r = m.\n\n- If r is >= the job's day (since d is stored as -day, so r >= -d \u2192 day <= r). Wait, but the job's day is stored as -d. So original day is -d. So the condition is r >= -d \u2192 r >= day.\n\nWait, if the job's day is, say, 3, then in x it's stored as -3. So when we pop, d is -3. So the condition is r >= 3. r is m minus the current size of y. So if the remaining slots is at least the job's day, then we add it to y. Otherwise, we add it and then remove the smallest (since after adding, the size would be m+1, and we pop the smallest to keep it at m).\n\nBut this logic is a bit confusing. Let's think with an example.\n\nSuppose m is 5. Suppose the current y has 3 elements (size 3). So r = 5-3 = 2. If the job's day is 2, then we can add it (since 2 <= 2). So the job is added, making y size 4.\n\nIf the job's day is 3, then r=2 <3. So we add it to y (size becomes 4+1=5?), wait, no. Wait, when you add it, then check if to pop. Let's see:\n\nIf the job's day is 3, and r=2, then we enter the else block. We push the salary into y (size increases by 1 to 3+1=4?), but then immediately pop. So after pushing, the size is 4, then pop the smallest salary, making size 3 again.\n\nWait, but in that case, the condition is checking whether the job's day is <= r. If it's not, then adding the job may still be possible if replacing a smaller salary.\n\nBut how does this ensure that the sum of days (or whatever) is accounted for? Hmm. Maybe the day here is not the actual days taken, but the deadline. For example, each job must be scheduled by its deadline (day), and you can do at most one job per day. The goal is to select a subset of jobs to maximize the total profit, ensuring that each job is scheduled by its deadline.\n\nIn that classic problem, the approach is to process jobs in order of descending profit, and assign each job to the latest possible day <= its deadline. But here, the code is processing jobs in order of descending deadline (since x is a max-heap based on day). For each job, it checks how much \"remaining\" days are there. But I'm not sure. Let's think again.\n\nIn the code:\n\nFor each job (sorted by day descending):\n\n- The remaining slots (r) is m - len(y). So r is the number of days we have left if each job takes exactly one day. Because m is the total days available. So if we have m days, each job takes 1 day, and you can select at most m jobs. But that's only possible if all the jobs' deadlines are >= their position in the schedule.\n\nSo the code is trying to select the m highest paying jobs that can be scheduled within their deadlines, considering that each job takes 1 day. The deadlines must be >= their scheduled day (like, if a job is scheduled on day k, then its deadline must be >=k).\n\nBut how to model this? The algorithm here is processing the jobs in order of deadline (from largest to smallest). For each job, if there's enough remaining days (r) to accommodate this job (i.e., the job's deadline is >= the number of days left plus 1?), perhaps. Wait, perhaps the logic is:\n\nWhen you have r remaining days (m - len(y)), you can schedule this job only if the job's deadline is >= r. Because, for example, if you have r days left, you need to schedule the job on one of those days. But the job's deadline must be at least r, because you can't schedule it on day r+1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see: imagine m=3 days. So days are 1,2,3. If you have a job with deadline 2, you can schedule it on day 2. If you have a job with deadline 3, you can schedule it on day 3, but if you have a job with deadline 1, you have to schedule it on day 1.\n\nThe code processes jobs in order of decreasing deadline. So when you process a job with deadline D, you can schedule it only if D >= (the number of days left). Because the days left is the number of days not yet allocated. For example, if there are 3 days left (r=3), then you can schedule the job on day 3. If the deadline is 3, that's acceptable. If the deadline is 2, you can't schedule it on day 3. But that's not possible. So maybe this logic is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is: when you have r days left (r = m - len(y)), you can take the job only if the job's deadline is at least r. Because each job you take must occupy one day, and the latest possible day you can schedule it is r. So the job's deadline must be >= r.\n\nFor example:\n\nm=3, current len(y) is 0 \u2192 r=3. So a job with deadline 3 can be taken. Schedule it on day 3. Then, next job has deadline 2. Now len(y) is 1 \u2192 r=2. So you can take jobs with deadline >= 2. Schedule this job on day 2. Then, next job has deadline 1. r=1. So can take jobs with deadline >=1. Schedule on day 1.\n\nSo the code's condition is: if the job's deadline >= r (r = m - len(y)), then take it, else check if adding it and removing the smallest (in terms of salary) would be better.\n\nBut this approach ensures that the job's deadline is sufficient to allow scheduling. By processing jobs in order of descending deadlines, you can greedily take the most profitable jobs (since y is a min-heap of salaries, but we push the negative salary, so the smallest in the heap is the job with the smallest salary in the current selection). So when a new job has a higher salary than the smallest in the current selection, and its deadline is not enough to be added directly, it replaces the smallest in the selection.\n\nSo the code's logic is: process jobs in order of descending deadline. For each job, if there's enough remaining days (r >= job's deadline), add it to the selection. Otherwise, compare its salary with the smallest in the current selection. If it's larger, replace the smallest.\n\nWait, no. The code doesn't compare salaries. It always adds the current job to the heap, then removes the smallest. So the heap's size is kept at m. But why?\n\nLet me think again. The code starts with x sorted by day in descending order (since stored as negative). For each job in x:\n\nr = m - len(y). So len(y) is the number of selected jobs so far.\n\nIf r >= job's day (-d is the job's day), then add to y. Else, add to y and then pop the smallest from y.\n\nWait, but adding and then popping when the size exceeds m? No, because when you add and then pop, the size remains the same. So the code maintains the size of y as m. Because, if the initial len(y) is, say, m-1, then r is 1. If the job's day is 2, then the else clause is taken. So you add the job to y (making len(y) m), then pop the smallest (making it m-1 again). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose len(y) is k. Then r = m -k.\n\nIf you add a job in the else case, you push it into y (k becomes k+1). Then you pop the smallest (k becomes k). So the size remains k. So after processing all jobs, the size of y is m, and the sum is taken.\n\nWait, no. Let's track an example:\n\nInitially, y is empty. m=2.\n\nFirst job: day is 3. r = 2 -0=2. Since 2 >=3? No. Because d is -3 (from x, which stored -day). So r >= -d \u2192 2 >=3? No. So else clause: push to y (y has 1 element), then pop. Now y has 0 elements again. So that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's correct. The job's day is stored as -day in x. So when we pop from x, d is (for a job with day 3) stored as -3. So when the code checks if r >= -d \u2192 r >=3. So if r is 2, the condition is false. So the else clause is taken. So in the else clause, we add the job to y, then pop the smallest. But adding it to y makes the size len(y) increase by 1, then popping reduces it by 1. So the overall size remains the same. Wait, but then how does the code collect up to m elements?\n\nAh, the code starts with y empty. For each job, if r (m - len(y)) >= job's day, then add to y. Otherwise, add to y then remove the smallest. But the code processes all jobs. So after processing all jobs, the len(y) can be up to m, since every time you add a job, even if you have to remove one.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: Suppose m=2. For each job:\n\nProcessing the first job:\n\nr = 2 -0 = 2.\n\nIf job's day is 3: then the condition r >= -d \u2192 2 >=3? No. So else clause: push to y (size becomes 1), then pop (size becomes 0 again). So nothing is added.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the code isn't correct. But in the original Python code, perhaps the logic is that the jobs are processed in order of day descending, and each job is considered for inclusion. For example, the job with the largest day (deadline) is considered first. The code tries to include as many jobs as possible up to m, but only if the job's day (deadline) is at least the number of remaining days. Otherwise, it checks if adding the current job (and removing the smallest salary in y) would increase the total profit.\n\nBut the code's approach may be correct for the problem of scheduling jobs with deadlines and profits, where each job takes 1 day, and you can't have more than m jobs. So the maximum number of jobs is m, and each job's deadline must be at least the number of days remaining.\n\nBut how does the code ensure that the deadlines are met? Because when a job is added, it's assumed to take the latest possible day (r). So if a job's deadline is >= r, then it can be scheduled on day r. So by processing in order of deadline descending, the code greedily takes the highest possible deadline jobs first, ensuring that the selection is optimal.\n\nBut the code's logic for handling when the job's day is larger than the available days is to add it to the heap and then remove the smallest element. This way, the heap y always contains the m highest salaries among the jobs that could potentially fit into the schedule.\n\nSo translating this code into C requires implementing the priority queues (heaps) for x and y, but in C, there's no built-in heapq module. So I need to implement the heaps manually.\n\nFirst, the heap for x is a max-heap based on day. But in Python, the heapq module is a min-heap, so to simulate a max-heap, they push the negative day. Similarly, in C, we can use a max-heap or min-heap. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nBut perhaps the original code uses a min-heap for x, but with negative days and salaries. Let's see: heapq in Python is a min-heap. So when you push (-day, -salary), the smallest (-day) would be the largest day. So x is a max-heap for day. So when you pop from x, you get the largest day first.\n\nIn C, to implement a max-heap for day, we can create a struct for the jobs, and use a comparison that orders them based on day in descending order. But building a max-heap in C requires adjusting the comparison function.\n\nAlternatively, since C's standard library doesn't have a built-in priority queue, we need to implement heaps ourselves. So let's plan:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the n jobs (day, salary).\n\n3. Build a max-heap for the jobs based on day. So the job with the largest day is at the top.\n\n4. Then, process each job in order of descending day. For each job, check if the current remaining slots (m minus the size of y) is >= day. If yes, add to y. If no, add to y and then remove the smallest salary in y. However, y must be a min-heap of salaries, but in the code, the Python code uses a min-heap but stores negative salaries. So to get the max-heap behavior for salaries.\n\nWait, no. The Python code pushes -salary into y, which makes the heap a min-heap of -salary. So when you pop the smallest element from y, it's actually the largest salary (since -salary is smallest when salary is largest). Wait no: if you have salaries 3 and 5, stored as -3 and -5. The min-heap would have -5 (smallest) at the top. So popping from y would give -5, which is -5 \u2192 which represents the salary 5. Wait, no: when you push -5 into the heap, the smallest is -5. So when you pop, you get -5. Then, in the sum, you add the absolute value, so 5. So y is a min-heap that holds the negative salaries, thus effectively acting as a max-heap for the actual salaries. Because when you need to keep the largest m salaries, you can use a min-heap of size m, where you add elements and if the size exceeds m, you remove the smallest (which is the smallest of the large elements, thus keeping the largest m).\n\nWait, no: in the code, when you process a new job, you add it to y (the min-heap of -salary). Then if the size of y exceeds m, you pop the smallest element. But in the code, the size of y is kept up to m. Because for each job processed, after adding, if the size is m+1, you pop one. But wait, in the code, the else clause is executed when the job's day is larger than the remaining slots (r). So in that case, they add the job to y, then pop the smallest (so the size remains the same as before adding). So after processing all jobs, the size of y is m, because whenever you add a job when you have no room, you add and pop, keeping the size the same. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, y is empty. For each job:\n\nIf condition is true (r >= day), then add to y. So the size increases by 1.\n\nIf condition is false, add to y (size increases by 1), then pop (size decreases by 1 \u2192 net zero change).\n\nSo the code's y can have a maximum size of m. Because when you add a job and the condition is true, the size increases. But the condition is r = m - len(y) >= day. So len(y) + day <= m. Because when you add the job, len(y) increases by 1. So after adding, len(y) becomes len(y) +1. So the maximum possible len(y) is m. Because, for example, if m=3, and len(y) is 2, and day=1 (r=1 >=1), then you add, len(y) becomes 3. Next job: r=0. So if day is 0, then condition is true (0 >=0), add and len(y) becomes 4. Which is more than m=3. Wait, but that's impossible. Because r = m - len(y). So if len(y) is 3, then r=0. So for the next job, the condition is r >= day \u2192 0 >= day. So if day is 0, then 0 >=0 is true. So you add, making len(y) 4, which exceeds m. But the Python code doesn't have a check for that. So perhaps the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to collect up to m jobs. Because when you process the jobs, you can add more than m jobs, but then pop the smallest until the size is m. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when you process each job:\n\nIf the job's day <= r (remaining slots), then add to y. So len(y) increases by 1. This could potentially make len(y) exceed m. For example, if m=3, and len(y) is 3. Then r=0. If the job's day is 0, then 0 >=0 \u2192 add, len(y) becomes 4. Then the code doesn't pop. So in the end, the code would have y's size of 4, but when you sum it, you take all 4. But that's not correct. So perhaps there's a mistake in the original code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the initial problem allows selecting any number of jobs as long as their deadlines are <= the available days. But in that case, the code's approach is not obvious.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is correct. Let's look at the test case.\n\nFor example, let's say n=3, m=2.\n\nJobs:\n\nJob 1: day=3, salary=10\n\nJob 2: day=2, salary=20\n\nJob 3: day=1, salary=30\n\nThe code processes the jobs in order of day descending: 3, 2, 1.\n\nProcessing job 1 (day=3, salary=10):\n\nr = 2 - 0 =2. 3 <=2? No. So else clause. Push 10 to y (now y has [10]), then pop. y becomes empty. So after this, y is empty.\n\nProcessing job 2 (day=2, salary=20):\n\nr=2 -0=2. day=2 <=2 \u2192 yes. Push 20 to y. len(y) is 1.\n\nProcessing job3 (day=1, salary=30):\n\nr=2-1=1. day=1 <=1 \u2192 yes. Push 30. len(y) is 2. sum is 50.\n\nSo the total is 50. Which is correct, as selecting days 2 and1: sum 20+30=50.\n\nBut if the code is correct in this case.\n\nAnother example: m=2.\n\nJobs:\n\nJob1: day=3, salary=100.\n\nJob2: day=2, salary=50.\n\nJob3: day=1, salary=10.\n\nProcessing job1 (day3, 100):\n\nr=2. day3>2 \u2192 else clause. Push 100 to y (size1), then pop. So y is empty.\n\nJob2 (day2, 50):\n\nr=2. day2<=2 \u2192 yes. Push 50. y size1.\n\nJob3 (day1, 10): r=1. day1<=1 \u2192 yes. Push10. y size2. Sum is 60.\n\nBut the optimal selection would be job1 and job2, but job1's day3 is larger than 2, so can't be scheduled. Because the total days allowed is 2. So job1 can't be scheduled. So the optimal is job2 and job3, sum 60. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nJobs:\n\nJob1: day=3, salary=100.\n\nJob2: day=3, salary=200.\n\nJob3: day=2, salary=50.\n\nJob4: day=2, salary=300.\n\nProcessing in order of day: 3,3,2,2.\n\nProcessing job1 (day3, salary100):\n\nr=3-0=3. 3 >=3 \u2192 yes. Push 100. y size1.\n\njob2 (day3, salary200):\n\nr=3-1=2. 3>2 \u2192 else. Push 200. y size2. Then pop (min of 100 and 200 is100). So y now has 200.\n\njob3 (day2, salary50):\n\nr=3-1=2. 2 <=2 \u2192 yes. Push50. y size2.\n\njob4 (day2, salary300):\n\nr=3-2=1. 2>1 \u2192 else. Push300. y size3. Then pop the smallest (50). So y now has 200,300. Sum is 500.\n\nBut the optimal selection would be job2 (200), job4 (300), and perhaps another job. But since m=3 days, we can select three jobs. But the deadlines must be >= their scheduled days. For example, three jobs with day >=3, 2,1.\n\nWait, job2 has day3. It can be scheduled on day3. Job4 has day2, can be scheduled on day2. And job3 (day2) can be scheduled on day1. But in the code's approach, it's processed in order of day. The code's result is sum 200+300=500, but since m=3, we can take three jobs. For example, job2 (200), job4 (300), and job3 (50). Sum 550. But why isn't that the case?\n\nHmm, perhaps the code has a mistake here. Let's see.\n\nAfter processing job1 and job2:\n\nAfter job1, y has [100]. Then job2: day3>2 \u2192 else. Push 200, then pop. So y is [200]. Then job3 (day2):\n\nr=3-1=2. day2 <=2 \u2192 yes. Push50. y becomes [50,200]. Then job4: day2. r=3-2=1. day2>1 \u2192 else. Push300 \u2192 y becomes [50,200,300]. Then pop the smallest (50). So y is [200,300]. Sum 500. But the correct maximum sum should be 200+300+50=550. But how?\n\nBut in this case, when job3 is processed, it's added to y. len(y) becomes 2. Then job4 is processed, but the remaining r is 1. So day2 >1 \u2192 else clause. Push 300, making len(y)3. Then pop the smallest (50), so len(y)2 again. So after processing all jobs, the sum is 200+300=500. But in reality, you can select job2 (day3, scheduled on day3), job4 (day2, scheduled on day2), job3 (day2, scheduled on day1). Sum 200+300+50=550. So the code's logic is missing this.\n\nWhich suggests that the code is incorrect. But why? Because the code's approach is processing jobs in order of day, not salary. So jobs with higher day are considered first. But when a job with lower day but higher salary comes later, it may not be added because the code's y is a min-heap of salaries, and only the top m salaries are kept.\n\nBut in this test case, the code's approach is flawed. So perhaps the code is not correct. But the user provided the code and wants to translate it to C. So regardless of whether the code is correct, I need to translate it as is.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- Process jobs in order of descending day.\n\n- For each job, if the remaining days (m - len(y)) >= day, add to y.\n\n- Else, add to y and pop the smallest salary (so the total in y remains the same size, but possibly replacing a smaller salary with a larger one).\n\nThe sum of the salaries in y (after all processing) is the answer.\n\nSo the translation to C requires:\n\n1. Implementing a max-heap for x (sorted by day descending).\n\n2. Implementing a min-heap for y (sorted by salary), but storing the actual salaries. Wait, no: in Python, the code stores the negative salary in y, so when you pop the smallest, you get the largest salary. But in C, to implement a min-heap for y, but keep track of the largest salaries, we can either store the negative values and then sum their absolute values, or invert the comparison.\n\nAlternatively, the code for y in Python is a min-heap of -salary, so when you pop the smallest element, it's the largest salary.\n\nSo in C, to get the same behavior, the y heap should be a min-heap, but store the actual salary. Wait, no. For example:\n\nIn Python, the y heap has elements like -10, -20, -30. The min-heap's smallest is -30 (which is the largest actual salary of 30). When you pop, you get -30, which when summed is 30.\n\nBut in C, if we implement a min-heap for the actual salary, then the smallest would be the smallest salary. So to get the same effect, we need to use a max-heap. But the code in Python uses a min-heap with negative values. So in C, we can implement a max-heap for the salary. Then, when adding elements, we compare normally, and when popping, we remove the largest element. But that's not the same as the Python code.\n\nWait, the code in Python for y:\n\n- When a job is added, it's pushed as -salary. So the min-heap will have the smallest -salary (which is the largest actual salary) at the top. So when you pop from y, you remove the smallest -salary (largest actual salary), which is not desired. Wait, no. For example, salaries 10, 20, 30. In the heap, stored as -10, -20, -30. The min-heap will have -30 at the top. Popping gives -30, which is the largest actual salary. But that's the opposite of what the code wants. Because when the code adds a job and then pops, it removes the smallest (which is the largest salary), which is not good. Wait, this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think again. The code pushes -salary into y. So the heap is a min-heap based on -salary. So the smallest element is the one with the most negative value (i.e., the largest salary). So when you pop, you remove the largest salary. Which is not what you want. Because in the code's logic, when you add a new job and the heap is full, you want to remove the smallest salary in the current selection. But if the heap is a min-heap of -salary, the top is the largest salary. So popping would remove the largest salary, which is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. But maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the Python code again:\n\nFor example, if the heap y has elements 5, 3, 10. The code pushes -5, -3, -10. The min-heap will have -10 (smallest) at the top. So when you pop, you get -10 \u2192 which is 10, the largest salary. But the code wants to keep the largest salaries. So popping the smallest from this heap is wrong. So the code's logic is flawed.\n\nThis indicates that the original Python code is incorrect. But the user provided the code and wants it translated to C. So I need to replicate the code's logic, even if it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code uses a max-heap for y. Let me check:\n\nIn the code, when a new job is added to y, and then the smallest is popped. But the code is using a min-heap for y. So when you add a job and then pop the smallest (which is the largest salary), the code is not keeping the largest salaries. So the code is incorrect.\n\nBut the code's sum is sum(y), which is sum of the elements in y. But since the elements are stored as -salary, sum(y) is the sum of the negatives. So the actual sum is the negative of that. For example, in the code:\n\ny contains [-10, -20, -30]. sum(y) is -60. But the actual total is 60. But in the code, the sum is printed as sum(y). Which would be -60. But in the sample code, that's not the case. Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the Python code:\n\nWhen you push -salary into y. So for example, salary 10 is stored as -10. When you sum(y), it's sum of -10, etc. So the sum is negative of the actual sum. But the code's output is sum(y). Which would be negative. But that can't be right. So perhaps the code is wrong. Wait, looking at the Python code:\n\nThe code pushes -s (s is the negative of the salary). Wait, in the code:\n\nfor each job in x:\n\nd, s = heapq.heappop(x)\n\nThen:\n\nheapq.heappush(y, -s)\n\nSo d is (-day, ...), s is -salary. So the code pushes -s into y. So s is the negative salary. So -s is the salary. So y contains the actual salary values. So the code is correct here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nThe code reads day and salary as input. Then pushes into x as (-day, -salary). So when you pop from x, d is -day, s is -salary. So when you push into y, it's -s \u2192 which is salary. So y contains the actual salaries, and the heapq in Python is a min-heap. So when you push salary into y, the min-heap's top is the smallest salary. When you add a new salary and then pop, you remove the smallest one. So the code is correct in this aspect.\n\nSo the code's y is a min-heap of the actual salaries. So when processing each job, the code adds it to y. If the job's day is larger than the remaining slots (r), then after adding, the code removes the smallest salary (to keep the total count at m). So this logic is correct for selecting the m highest salaries that can be scheduled within their deadlines.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, translating to C requires implementing two heaps:\n\n1. x is a max-heap sorted by day (descending order).\n\n2. y is a min-heap sorted by salary (ascending order).\n\nIn C, since there's no built-in heap, we need to implement these manually.\n\nFor the max-heap x:\n\nEach element is a struct with day and salary. The comparison is based on day in descending order.\n\nFor the min-heap y:\n\nEach element is a salary, and the comparison is based on salary in ascending order.\n\nBut implementing a max-heap in C requires adjusting the comparison function. Alternatively, we can use a min-heap with negative days to simulate the max-heap.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to implement the x as a max-heap, and y as a min-heap.\n\nSo steps to implement in C:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n pairs of day and salary, storing them in a max-heap x based on day.\n\nThen, while x is not empty:\n\n   Extract the job with maximum day (top of x's heap).\n\n   Compute r = m - current size of y.\n\n   if (r >= day of the job):\n\n       add salary to y's heap.\n\n   else:\n\n       add salary to y's heap.\n\n       if y's size exceeds m:\n\n           remove the smallest salary from y.\n\nSum all elements in y and print.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after adding to y in the else case, the code always pops, which would keep the size of y the same as before adding. Because when you add and then pop, the size is back to original.\n\nWait, in the original code:\n\nIn the else case, after pushing the salary into y, the code then pops the smallest element. So the size of y is the same as before the else clause.\n\nFor example, if before processing the job, y's size is k.\n\nIn the else case:\n\npush \u2192 k+1.\n\npop \u2192 k.\n\nSo the code's y's size can be up to m. Because, when the if clause is true, push \u2192 size increases. But if the if clause is true, then the job's day is <= r. So after adding, the size increases by 1. But how to ensure that the size does not exceed m.\n\nWait, let's suppose m=3.\n\nInitially, y is empty.\n\nProcessing job1: day=3. r=3.\n\nr >=3 \u2192 yes. Push. y's size becomes 1.\n\njob2: day=3. r=3-1=2. 2 >=3 \u2192 no. else: push, then pop. So y's size remains 1.\n\njob3: day=2. r=3-1=2. 2 >=2 \u2192 yes. Push. y's size 2.\n\njob4: day=2. r=3-2=1. 1 >=2 \u2192 no. else: push, pop. y's size 2.\n\nSo the size can be up to m.\n\nSo in the C code, after adding the salary to y, in the else case, we check if the size is larger than m. Because pushing the salary may make the size k+1, and then popping reduces it to k. But in the original code, the else clause always does a push and pop, regardless of the current size.\n\nWait, no. The code's else clause is:\n\nheapq.heappush(y, -s)\n\nheapq.heappop(y)\n\nSo regardless of whether adding the element causes the size to exceed m, it's added and then popped. So after these two steps, the size of y is the same as before.\n\nFor example, if y's size was k before:\n\nAfter push \u2192 k+1.\n\nAfter pop \u2192 k.\n\nSo in the else case, the size of y remains k. So the code's y can't exceed m in size. Because when the if case is true, the size increases by 1. So the maximum possible size is m.\n\nSo to implement this in C, the code for the else case must push the salary into y, then pop the smallest element, regardless of the current size. So even if the size is less than m, adding and popping would reduce the size by one. But this seems incorrect.\n\nWait, the code in the else clause is:\n\nheapq.heappush(y, -s)\n\nheapq.heappop(y)\n\nBut if the size of y is k. After pushing, it's k+1. Then popping makes it k again. So the code in the else case does not change the size of y. So the only way the size of y increases is through the if case.\n\nThus, the maximum size of y is m. Because when the if case is true, the code adds a new element, increasing the size by 1. But when the size of y reaches m, the next if case would require r >= day. But r = m - len(y) \u2192 if len(y) is m, r is 0. So for a job's day to be <=0, which is possible only if day is 0. So in such a case, the if case would be true, allowing the code to add to y, making the size m+1. But then, in the else case, the code would add and pop.\n\nBut this seems to be a problem. So perhaps the original code's logic is incorrect, but I need to follow it.\n\nSo in the C code, for each job:\n\nIf the remaining slots (r = m - current y size) >= job's day \u2192 add to y.\n\nElse \u2192 add to y, then remove the smallest salary from y (so size remains the same).\n\nThus, in C, the code for the else case would be:\n\nadd to y's heap.\n\nthen, extract the minimal element.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nSo in C:\n\nWe need two heaps:\n\nFor x:\n\n- Max-heap based on day.\n\nFor y:\n\n- Min-heap based on salary.\n\nImplementing a max-heap in C:\n\nWe can represent the heap as an array, where each node is greater than or equal to its children. The compare function for insertion and deletion would check if the parent is smaller than the child, and swap if so.\n\nSimilarly for the min-heap for y.\n\nSo steps for C code:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Create an array for x (max-heap) to store jobs, sorted by day in descending order.\n\n3. For each of the n jobs:\n\n   read day and salary.\n\n   insert into x's max-heap.\n\n4. Process each job in x's max-heap order:\n\n   extract the job with largest day.\n\n   compute r = m - size of y.\n\n   if (r >= job.day):\n\n       insert job.salary into y's min-heap.\n\n   else:\n\n       insert job.salary into y's min-heap.\n\n       extract the minimum salary from y.\n\n5. After processing all jobs, sum all elements in y's heap.\n\nSo the key is to correctly implement the heaps.\n\nImplementing a max-heap in C:\n\nWe can use an array where each node at index i has children at 2i+1 and 2i+2. For the max-heap, when inserting, we add the element at the end and bubble up, swapping with parent if larger.\n\nWhen extracting the max, we take the first element, replace it with the last element, and bubble down, swapping with the larger child until the heap property is restored.\n\nSimilarly for the min-heap.\n\nNow, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, define a structure for the job in x:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int day;\n    int salary;\n} Job;\n\nThen, for the max-heap x:\n\nWe need functions to insert and extract max.\n\nFor the min-heap y:\n\nWe need functions to insert and extract min.\n\nBut in C, we'll have to implement these heaps manually.\n\nThe code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int day;\n    int salary;\n} Job;\n\n// Max-heap for x (based on day)\nJob *x_heap = NULL;\nint x_size = 0;\nint x_capacity = 0;\n\nvoid x_push(Job job) {\n    if (x_size == x_capacity) {\n        x_capacity = x_capacity == 0 ? 1 : x_capacity * 2;\n        x_heap = realloc(x_heap, x_capacity * sizeof(Job));\n    }\n    int i = x_size++;\n    x_heap[i] = job;\n    while (i > 0) {\n        int parent = (i - 1) / 2;\n        if (x_heap[parent].day >= x_heap[i].day) break;\n        Job temp = x_heap[parent];\n        x_heap[parent] = x_heap[i];\n        x_heap[i] = temp;\n        i = parent;\n    }\n}\n\nJob x_pop() {\n    Job max = x_heap[0];\n    x_heap[0] = x_heap[--x_size];\n    int i = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        int left = 2*i + 1;\n        int right = 2*i + 2;\n        int largest = i;\n        if (left < x_size && x_heap[left].day > x_heap[largest].day) largest = left;\n        if (right < x_size && x_heap[right].day > x_heap[largest].day) largest = right;\n        if (largest == i) break;\n        Job temp = x_heap[i];\n        x_heap[i] = x_heap[largest];\n        x_heap[largest] = temp;\n        i = largest;\n    }\n    return max;\n}\n\n// Min-heap for y (based on salary)\nint *y_heap = NULL;\nint y_size = 0;\nint y_capacity = 0;\n\nvoid y_push(int salary) {\n    if (y_size == y_capacity) {\n        y_capacity = y_capacity == 0 ? 1 : y_capacity * 2;\n        y_heap = realloc(y_heap, y_capacity * sizeof(int));\n    }\n    int i = y_size++;\n    y_heap[i] = salary;\n    while (i > 0) {\n        int parent = (i - 1)/2;\n        if (y_heap[parent] <= y_heap[i]) break;\n        int temp = y_heap[parent];\n        y_heap[parent] = y_heap[i];\n        y_heap[i] = temp;\n        i = parent;\n    }\n}\n\nint y_pop() {\n    int min = y_heap[0];\n    y_heap[0] = y_heap[--y_size];\n    int i = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        int left = 2*i +1;\n        int right = 2*i +2;\n        int smallest = i;\n        if (left < y_size && y_heap[left] < y_heap[smallest]) smallest = left;\n        if (right < y_size && y_heap[right] < y_heap[smallest]) smallest = right;\n        if (smallest == i) break;\n        int temp = y_heap[i];\n        y_heap[i] = y_heap[smallest];\n        y_heap[smallest] = temp;\n        i = smallest;\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int day, salary;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &day, &salary);\n        Job job = {day, salary};\n        x_push(job);\n    }\n    \n    while (x_size > 0) {\n        Job job = x_pop();\n        int r = m - y_size;\n        if (r >= job.day) {\n            y_push(job.salary);\n        } else {\n            y_push(job.salary);\n            y_pop();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < y_size; i++) {\n        sum += y_heap[i];\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);\n    \n    free(x_heap);\n    free(y_heap);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the x_push function, the heap is a max-heap based on day. So when pushing a job with a higher day, it bubbles up.\n\nBut the original Python code processes jobs in order of descending day. So this part is correct.\n\nIn the main loop, after popping a job from x, we compute r = m - y_size (current size of y). If r >= job.day, we add the salary to y. Else, add and pop.\n\nThis mirrors the Python code.\n\nThen, after processing all jobs, sum all elements in y_heap.\n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
