So when processing node 1, which has par[1] =0, then grandparent is par[0], which is 0. child_num[0] is 0. Decrementing gives -1. Since it's not zero, no addition to the seq. But in the example where N=3, when processing node 1, the code adds grandparent (par[par[c]] is par[0], which is 0. So child_num[0] is 0. Decrementing to -1, no addition.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me first understand what the Python code does.\n\nThe code starts by reading input to build a tree structure. Then it performs some kind of traversal to determine if the first player wins or the second. The problem is probably a game where players take turns removing nodes from a tree, and the winner is determined based on certain conditions.\n\nLet me break down the Python code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code reads N, the number of nodes. Then it builds an adjacency list for the tree. Each edge is read and added to both nodes' adjacency lists.\n\nNext, a BFS is performed starting from node 1. The parent of each node is recorded, and the number of children each node has (child_num array) is tracked. So, after BFS, child_num[i] represents how many children node i has in this tree structure.\n\nThen, the code initializes a queue 'seq' with all leaves (nodes where child_num is 0). Wait, but in the BFS, the child_num is the number of children in the tree. So leaves would have child_num 0. So 'seq' starts with all leaves.\n\nThen there's a loop processing the 'seq' queue. Each node 'c' is popped, marked as seen[c] = 0. Then if the parent of 'c' (par[c]) is already marked as 0 in seen, it prints 'First' and exits. Otherwise, it marks the parent as 0, decrements the grandparent's child_num, and if the grandparent's child_num becomes 0, adds it to the seq.\n\nThe logic here seems like a greedy game simulation. When a leaf is processed, it's paired with its parent. If the parent can't be processed (already taken), then the first player wins. Otherwise, the grandparent's child count is reduced, and if it becomes a leaf, it's added to the queue.\n\nThe end result is that if all possible pairs are processed without a conflict, the second player wins.\n\nNow, translating this into C. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in C, we need to handle dynamic data structures. The adjacency list in Python is a list of lists. In C, we can create an array of linked lists. Each node's adjacency list can be represented as a linked list of integers.\n\nBut building adjacency lists in C is a bit involved. Let's see. For each node (from 1 to N), we have a linked list of adjacent nodes. Since the tree has N-1 edges, and each edge is bidirectional, each edge will be added twice.\n\nThen, the BFS uses a queue. In Python, deque is used. In C, we can implement a queue using a dynamic array or a linked list. Alternatively, since the nodes are up to 1e5 or similar (depending on N's size), we need to make sure the queue can handle that. But in practice, using a circular buffer or a dynamic array with a head and tail pointer would work.\n\nThe variables needed:\n\n- adj: array of linked lists (each element is a list of integers)\n- seen array: integer array initialized to 0, size N+1\n- par array: integer array to store parent of each node, size N+1\n- child_num array: integer array, size N+1\n\nSo, in C, the steps are:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N-1 edges and build the adjacency list.\n\n3. Initialize the queue for BFS (starting with node 1), mark seen[1] = 1, set parent to 0.\n\n4. Process BFS to compute parent and child_num for each node.\n\n5. Initialize another queue (seq) with all nodes where child_num[i] == 0.\n\n6. Process this seq queue as per the Python logic.\n\nChallenges:\n\n- Implementing the adjacency list in C. Since each node's adjacency list can vary in length, using a linked list for each entry is possible. Alternatively, since it's a tree, each adjacency list can be stored in a dynamic array, but managing that in C is a bit tedious.\n\nBut for code simplicity and given that N can be up to, say, 1e5, using a linked list per node may not be efficient. Alternatively, since each edge is added twice (since the tree is bidirectional), we can pre-allocate memory for all edges. Let's see: for each node, the adjacency list can be a pointer to a block of memory (like using a struct with a dynamic array), but perhaps a better way is to use a single array with all adjacency entries, and for each node, track the start and end index in that array.\n\nAlternatively, since the code processes the tree as a directed tree (after BFS, parent is known), but the initial adjacency list is bidirectional.\n\nBut in any case, the Python code's adjacency list is built with all adjacent nodes, including parent and children. But during BFS, when a node is processed, its adjacent nodes are checked, and the ones not seen (i.e., children) are added to the queue. So the BFS correctly builds the parent-child structure.\n\nSo, in C, the steps for the adjacency list:\n\nEach node's adjacency list is a linked list of integers. For each edge (a, b), add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nIn C, we can represent each adjacency list as a linked list. Each node in the linked list contains an integer (the adjacent node) and a next pointer.\n\nBut building this in C requires dynamic allocation. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, define a structure for the adjacency list nodes:\n\nstruct AdjNode {\n    int vertex;\n    struct AdjNode* next;\n};\n\nThen, create an array of pointers to AdjNode, one for each node up to N.\n\nstruct AdjNode** adj = (struct AdjNode**) calloc(N+1, sizeof(struct AdjNode*));\n\nThen, for each edge (a, b), add b to a's adjacency list and a to b's.\n\nBut in C, inserting into a linked list can be done at the beginning for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, when building the adjacency list, the order may not matter for BFS, since we process all adjacent nodes. So for each a and b, we can add them to each other's lists.\n\nBut when processing in BFS, we loop through all adjacent nodes. The BFS in Python uses deque, which is a queue (FIFO). So in C, the BFS will also process nodes in FIFO order.\n\nNow, for the BFS queue. Let's implement it with a dynamic array and head and tail pointers.\n\nint* queue = malloc((N+1) * sizeof(int));\nint head = 0, tail = 0;\n\nAdding to the queue: queue[tail++] = value.\n\nPopping from the queue: value = queue[head++].\n\nBut when N is up to 1e5, the queue size is manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nInitialize adj as an array of linked lists.\n\nRead N-1 edges, each a and b, and add to adj[a] and adj[b].\n\nThen, perform BFS starting from 1.\n\nInitialize the BFS queue with 1. Mark seen[1] = 1. par[1] = 0 (since root has no parent).\n\nFor each node in the queue, iterate over its adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node u:\n\nif not seen, mark as seen, set parent[u] = current node, increment child_num[v], and add to the queue.\n\nOnce BFS is done, the child_num array is filled.\n\nThen, create the seq queue (which in Python is a deque). The seq is filled with nodes i where child_num[i] == 0. These are the leaves.\n\nIn C, again, we can use a dynamic array for this queue, but in the Python code, it's a deque, and during processing, elements are popped from the end (like a stack). Wait, in the code:\n\nseq = deque()\nfor i in 1..N:\n    if child_num[i] == 0:\n        seq.append(i)\nthen, while seq:\n    c = seq.pop()  # pop from the end (like a stack)\n    ...\n\nSo the seq is processed as a stack. So in C, the seq can be implemented as a stack, with elements added and removed from the end.\n\nSo the 'seq' in Python is a LIFO structure. So in C, we can use a dynamic array (like a stack) where we push elements to the top and pop from the top.\n\nSo for the seq:\n\nint* seq = malloc((N+1) * sizeof(int));\nint seq_top = 0;\n\nAdding to the stack: seq[seq_top++] = value.\n\nPopping: value = seq[--seq_top].\n\nSo first, iterate through all nodes from 1 to N, and if child_num[i] == 0, push to seq.\n\nThen, process the seq stack.\n\nDuring processing:\n\nc = popped from the stack.\n\nSet seen[c] = 0.\n\nCheck if seen[par[c]] is 0. If yes, print 'First' and exit.\n\nElse, set seen[par[c]] = 0. Then, decrement child_num[par[par[c]]], and if it becomes 0, push par[par[c]] to the seq.\n\nAfter processing all elements, if no early exit, print 'Second'.\n\nNow, handling memory allocation in C:\n\nThe adjacency list nodes need to be dynamically allocated. Each edge is added twice (a to b and b to a). So for each edge, two nodes are created.\n\nBut in C, each AdjNode is malloc'd. However, since the code is processing a tree, and N can be up to 1e5, this approach might be acceptable, but for very large N, it could be slow. However, given that the original Python code uses lists, which are dynamic arrays, maybe a linked list isn't the most efficient. But in C, perhaps using a linked list is manageable.\n\nBut another approach is to pre-allocate all adjacency nodes. Since each edge is added twice, and there are N-1 edges, the total number of nodes is 2*(N-1). So we can pre-allocate an array of 2*(N-1) nodes and track their usage. But this complicates the code.\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation for each AdjNode.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps using dynamic allocation is easier, even though it's a bit slower.\n\nNow, the code steps in C:\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nThen, read N-1 edges.\n\nBut in C, reading input is more involved. The input is read via buffer, but the Python code uses input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline, then splits. So in C, perhaps read a line at a time, but for efficiency, use fgets and parse.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, read two integers. But how?\n\nIn the Python code, input is read as a buffer, and split into integers. So for each line (edge), a and b are read.\n\nIn C, perhaps read the entire input at once, but that's complex. Alternatively, read each line using fgets, then parse a and b. But in practice, the edges may be given in any order, possibly with multiple edges per line. Wait, no, the input for the edges is N-1 lines each with two integers a and b.\n\nSo in C, for each of the N-1 edges, read two integers a and b. So for each iteration of N-1 times, read a line, parse a and b.\n\nBut in C, using scanf can be problematic because of possible whitespace. But using scanf with \"%d %d\" should work.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps the input is read as a buffer and processed. However, for the purpose of this code, assuming that the input is correctly formatted, using scanf for each pair.\n\nBut note that the original code uses input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline, which implies that each edge is read from a line. So each edge is on a separate line, and a and b are read via split(). So in C, perhaps use fgets to read each line, then parse a and b.\n\nBut for the sake of code simplicity, perhaps use scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b) for each edge, which should work if the input is given as each edge on a separate line with possible leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nstruct AdjNode {\n    int vertex;\n    struct AdjNode* next;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    \n    struct AdjNode** adj = (struct AdjNode**) calloc(N + 1, sizeof(struct AdjNode*));\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        \n        // Add b to a's adjacency list\n        struct AdjNode* new_node = (struct AdjNode*) malloc(sizeof(struct AdjNode));\n        new_node->vertex = b;\n        new_node->next = adj[a];\n        adj[a] = new_node;\n        \n        // Add a to b's adjacency list\n        new_node = (struct AdjNode*) malloc(sizeof(struct AdjNode));\n        new_node->vertex = a;\n        new_node->next = adj[b];\n        adj[b] = new_node;\n    }\n    \n    // BFS initialization\n    int* queue = (int*) malloc((N + 1) * sizeof(int));\n    int head = 0, tail = 0;\n    \n    int* seen = (int*) calloc(N + 1, sizeof(int));\n    int* par = (int*) calloc(N + 1, sizeof(int));\n    int* child_num = (int*) calloc(N + 1, sizeof(int));\n    \n    queue[tail++] = 1;\n    seen[1] = 1;\n    par[1] = 0;\n    \n    while (head < tail) {\n        int v = queue[head++];\n        struct AdjNode* current = adj[v];\n        while (current != NULL) {\n            int u = current->vertex;\n            if (!seen[u]) {\n                seen[u] = 1;\n                par[u] = v;\n                child_num[v]++;\n                queue[tail++] = u;\n            }\n            current = current->next;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Initialize seq stack\n    int* seq = (int*) malloc((N + 1) * sizeof(int));\n    int seq_top = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n        if (child_num[i] == 0) {\n            seq[seq_top++] = i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Reset seen array (reuse it)\n    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n        seen[i] = 0;\n    }\n    \n    // Wait, no, in the Python code, during the BFS, seen is set to 1 for all nodes. Then, during processing, seen is set to 0 for nodes processed.\n    // Wait, no: the original code initializes seen to 0, then during BFS, sets seen to 1. Then, during the seq processing, seen is set to 0 again.\n\n    // Wait, in the Python code, after BFS, the seen array is all 1s except for 0. Then, during seq processing, each c is processed, and seen[c] is set to 0. Then, check if seen[par[c]] is 0. Then set seen[par[c]] to 0, etc.\n\n    // So after BFS, all seen entries are 1. So in C, after BFS, the seen array is all 1s. Then, during seq processing, we set seen[c] to 0.\n\n    // So in the C code, after BFS, the seen array has 1s for all nodes. So when processing the seq, we can reuse the same seen array, setting entries to 0 as we process.\n\n    // So the code can reuse the same seen array. No need to reset it.\n\n    // So during seq processing:\n\n    while (seq_top > 0) {\n        int c = seq[--seq_top];\n        seen[c] = 0;\n        int parent_c = par[c];\n        if (seen[parent_c] == 0) {\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n            exit(0);\n        }\n        seen[parent_c] = 0;\n        int grandparent = par[parent_c];\n        child_num[grandparent]--;\n        if (child_num[grandparent] == 0) {\n            seq[seq_top++] = grandparent;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"Second\\n\");\n    \n    // Free allocated memory\n    // (code for freeing adj, queue, seen, par, child_num, seq, etc.)\n    // ... (omitted for brevity)\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code:\n\nAfter processing the child c, the code checks if the parent of c (par[c]) has already been marked as 0. If yes, then first player wins. Otherwise, mark par[c] as 0. Then, decrement the child count of par[par[c]] (the grandparent). If the grandparent's child_num becomes 0, add it to the seq.\n\nSo in the C code, after popping c from the stack, set seen[c] to 0. Then, check if seen[par[c]] is 0. If yes, output First. Otherwise, set par[c] to 0, then decrement the grandparent's child_num, and if zero, add grandparent to the seq.\n\nBut in the code above, after setting seen[c] to 0, check parent_c = par[c]. If seen[parent_c] is 0, output First. Else, set seen[parent_c] to 0, then grandparent is par[parent_c], decrement child_num[grandparent], and if zero, add to seq.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the original code:\n\nseen[c] = 0\n\nif seen[par[c]] == 0:\n\n    print 'First' and exit.\n\nelse:\n\n    seen[par[c]] = 0\n\n    child_num[par[par[c]]] -= 1\n\n    if child_num[par[par[c]]] == 0:\n\n        seq.append(par[par[c]])\n\nSo the code above correctly represents this.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In the BFS, the child_num is computed as the number of children each node has. So in the tree structure built via BFS, the child_num[v] is the number of children of v.\n\nBut when we process the leaves (child_num[i] == 0), which are the leaves of the tree (since their child_num is zero).\n\nNow, in the C code, after BFS, the child_num array is correctly filled.\n\nAnother thing: in the Python code, after building the seq queue (with leaves), the code processes each c in the queue. For each c, it's a leaf. Then, the code marks c as seen 0. Then checks if its parent is already 0. If so, first player wins. Otherwise, marks the parent as 0, then reduces the grandparent's child_num. If the grandparent's child_num becomes zero (i.e., after this reduction, it has no children left in the tree), then the grandparent is added to the seq queue.\n\nThis is a way to pair up nodes and their parents. The logic seems to determine if the first player can take a certain node such that the second player can't respond, leading to a win for first.\n\nNow, possible bugs in the C code:\n\n- Memory allocation: when N is large, but in the problem constraints, N could be up to 1e5. So using a linked list for adjacency could be slow. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable. However, the Python code uses lists, which are dynamic arrays, which are more cache-friendly. But in C, a linked list may be slower. However, the problem here is to translate the code, not to optimize it. So the code structure should mimic the Python code's logic, even if it's not the most efficient.\n\nAnother thing: when creating the adjacency list in C, each edge is added twice. For example, edge a-b is added to a's list and b's list. So the BFS correctly processes all adjacent nodes (both parent and children). However, in the BFS, when a node is processed, any adjacent node that's not yet seen (i.e., parent is not yet processed) is considered a child. So the BFS correctly builds the parent array and child_num array.\n\nAnother possible issue: the BFS starts at node 1, which is the root. So the parent array is built correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nThe tree is 1-2-3.\n\nBFS starts at 1. Child_num[1] is 1 (child is 2). Child_num[2] is 1 (child is 3). Child_num[3] is 0.\n\nThe seq starts with 3.\n\nProcessing c=3:\n\nseen[3] = 0.\n\nCheck parent[3] is 2. seen[2] was 1 (after BFS, all nodes are seen=1). So set seen[2] to 0. Then, grandparent is 1. child_num[1] was 1, now decremented to 0. So add 1 to seq.\n\nNext, seq has 1.\n\nProcessing c=1 (popped from stack). seen[1] = 0. Check parent[1] is 0. So par[1] is 0. So par[c] is 0. But in the code, accessing par[0], which is out of bounds. Wait, par[1] is 0, as set in the BFS.\n\nWait, in the BFS, par[1] is set to 0. So when processing c=1, par[c] is 0. Then, in the code, 'seen[par[c]]' would be seen[0], which is not initialized. But in the Python code, par is initialized to 0 for all nodes. So in the C code, par is initialized to 0. So par[1] is 0, and par[0] is undefined. But during processing of c=1:\n\nAfter setting seen[1] to 0, parent_c = par[c] = 0. Then check if seen[0] is 0. But seen is allocated for N+1 elements (indices 0..N). Initially, seen[0] is 0 (from calloc). So during the check, seen[0] is 0. So the condition is triggered, and 'First' is printed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this may not be correct.\n\nWait, the sample input here: tree is 1-2-3. The leaves are 3. Processing 3: mark 3 as 0. Parent is 2 (seen 1). So mark 2 as 0. Then, grandparent is 1. child_num[1] is 1 (from BFS, child 2 has one child). child_num[1] is decremented to 0, so 1 is added to seq.\n\nNow, processing 1:\n\nSet seen[1] to 0. Then, parent_c is 0 (par[1] is 0). So check if seen[0] is 0. Which it is. So output 'First'.\n\nBut according to the problem's rules, perhaps the first player would win here. But I'm not sure. However, the code's logic is to print 'First' in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a bug here.\n\nWait, in the original Python code, during seq processing:\n\nc is 3. parent is 2. seen[2] is 1. So set seen[2] to 0. Then, the grandparent is 1. child_num[1] was 1 (from the BFS, node 1 has one child, 2). So after decrementing, child_num[1] becomes 0. So add 1 to seq.\n\nThen, seq processes 1. seen[1] is set to 0. parent[1] is 0. So check if seen[0] is 0. Which it is (since in C, seen is initialized to 0 via calloc). So the code prints 'First' and exits.\n\nBut in the original problem, this scenario may be when the first player can win. But according to the code's logic, this is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code in the C version has a problem with the root node's parent being 0. So when the root node is processed, and its parent is 0 (which is not part of the tree), the code treats that as a seen[0], which is always 0. So any time a root node is processed, it would trigger 'First'.\n\nBut in the tree of 1-2-3, after processing 3 and 2, the root node 1 is added to the seq. Then, processing 1: seen[1] is set to 0. Then, parent is 0. Since seen[0] is 0, the code outputs 'First'.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer for this input is 'First', but I'm not sure. The code's logic may be correct.\n\nAnother sample input: N=2. Edges 1-2.\n\nBFS: node 1 has child 2. child_num[1] =1, child_num[2] =0.\n\nseq starts with 2.\n\nProcessing 2: seen[2] =0. Check parent (1). seen[1] is 1. So mark 1 as 0. Then, grandparent is 0. child_num[0] is decremented (but in C, par[1] is 0, so grandparent is par[1] =0. So child_num[0] is undefined (index 0). But in the code, child_num is allocated for N+1 elements, so child_num[0] is 0. So after decrementing, it becomes -1. Then, since it's not zero, nothing is added to seq. So the loop ends. Then, code prints 'Second'.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, the output is 'Second'. But in reality, the game between two nodes: the first player can take node 2, then the second player takes node 1. Or the first player takes node 1, then the second player takes node 2. The problem's winning condition may depend on the pairing. According to the code, it would print 'Second'.\n\nBut I'm not certain about the problem's logic, but the code's translation should follow the original code's logic.\n\nTherefore, the C code should correctly reflect the Python code's steps.\n\nAnother potential error in the C code: when the grandparent is 0 (as in the root's parent), accessing child_num[0] which is out of the array (if N is 1). Wait, no. The code's arrays (child_num, par, seen) are allocated with N+1 elements (indices 0 to N). So for any node, including 0 (even though node 0 is not part of the tree), accessing child_num[0] is valid.\n\nBut node 0 is not part of the tree, so its child_num is 0. So when processing node 1, which has par[1] =0, then grandparent is par[0], which is 0. child_num[0] is 0. Decrementing gives -1. Since it's not zero, no addition to the seq.\n\nBut in the example where N=3, when processing node 1, the code adds grandparent (par[par[c]] is par[0], which is 0. So child_num[0] is 0. Decrementing to -1, no addition.\n\nWait, in the example where N=3:\n\nAfter processing node 3:\n\nc=3.\n\nparent_c =2. seen[2] is 1. So mark 2 as 0. Then, grandparent is par[2] =1. child_num[1] is 1. Decrement to 0. So add 1 to seq.\n\nThen processing 1:\n\nc=1. parent_c=0. seen[0] is 0. So print 'First' and exit.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, this is correct.\n\nThus, the C code seems to correctly translate the Python code.\n\nBut there's a potential problem with the initialization of the seen array. After BFS, the seen array is all 1's (since during BFS, all nodes are marked as seen). But during the seq processing, the code sets seen[c] =0 and then seen[par[c]] =0. So the seen array is reused.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in the C code, after BFS, the seen array is all 1's. Then, during seq processing, the code is setting seen[c] to 0, which is correct.\n\nNow, handling the par[0] case. For node 1, par[1] is 0. So when processing node 1, parent_c is 0. seen[0] is 0 (since it was initialized to 0 via calloc). So the code would print 'First'.\n\nBut in the original Python code, seen is initialized as [0]*(N+1). So for N=3, seen[0] is 0. So during the check in Python, seen[par[c]] (which is 0) is 0. So the code prints 'First' in that case.\n\nSo the C code correctly models this.\n\nThus, the C code should be correct."
