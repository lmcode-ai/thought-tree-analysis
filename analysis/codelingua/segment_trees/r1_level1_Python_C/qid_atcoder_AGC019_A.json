    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code to C. Let's see what the Python code is doing first. So the problem is about buying a certain amount of soda with different bottle sizes, finding the minimum cost. The input gives prices for 0.25L, 0.5L, 1L, and 2L bottles. Then n is the total liters needed, which I guess is up to 1e9 or something. The code calculates the best price per liter by considering different combinations.\n\nFirst, in the Python code, they compute best1L as the minimum cost for 1 liter by comparing buying four 0.25L, two 0.5L, or one 1L. Then best2L is the minimum between buying a 2L bottle or two best1L. Then, depending on whether n is even or odd, they calculate the total cost.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's break down the steps.\n\nThe key part is the input: read q, h, s, d, then n. Then compute best1L and best2L. Then calculate the total based on n being even or odd.\n\nIn C, I need to handle the input with scanf. The variables q, h, s, d, n are integers. So first, read those four values, then read n.\n\nThen compute best1L as the minimum of q*4, h*2, s. Then compute best2L as the minimum between d and best1L*2.\n\nThen, if n is even, the total is (n/2)*best2L. If n is odd, it's (n//2)*best2L + best1L. Wait, but in C, integer division truncates towards zero. So for even n, n divided by 2 is straightforward. For odd, same as (n-1)/2 * best2L + best1L.\n\nBut wait, in Python, n is an integer, so for example, if n is 3, then n//2 is 1, so 1 * best2L + best1L. So in C, when n is odd, (n / 2) would be integer division, same as Python's floor division. So for n=3, 3/2 is 1 in C.\n\nSo the code logic is the same.\n\nSo in C:\n\nRead q, h, s, d with scanf.\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute best1L as the min of q*4, h*2, s.\n\nCompute best2L as the min of d and best1L * 2.\n\nThen if n is even, multiply (n / 2) by best2L.\n\nElse, (n/2)*best2L + best1L.\n\nSo the C code would look something like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint min(int a, int b) {\n    return a < b ? a : b;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int q, h, s, d;\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &q, &h, &s, &d);\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    \n    int best1L = min(min(q*4, h*2), s);\n    int best2L = min(d, best1L * 2);\n    \n    long long total;\n    if (n % 2 == 0) {\n        total = (long long)(n / 2) * best2L;\n    } else {\n        total = (long long)(n / 2) * best2L + best1L;\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", total);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, the order of operations matters. Let's check:\n\nFor example, q*4 is 4 times the cost of 0.25L, since 0.25 *4 is 1L. Similarly, h*2 is 0.5L *2. So the code correctly calculates the per-liter cost.\n\nWhat about the data types? Since n can be up to 1e9, and best2L can be up to 1e9 per 2L, then (1e9 /2) * 1e9 would be 5e17, which is larger than 32-bit integer (max ~2e9). So using long long is necessary for the total.\n\nYes, so in C, variables should be declared as int, but the total needs to be a long long to avoid overflow.\n\nSo the code should use %lld for the printf.\n\nWhat about the min function? Well, since we have to find the minimum of three values for best1L: first compare q*4 and h*2, then the result compared with s. So the nested min calls work.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nFor example, if the input is q=2, h=3, s=7, d=11, n=3. Then best1L is min(8, 6, 7) =6. best2L is min(11, 12) =11. Then since n=3 is odd, total is (3//2)*11 +6 \u2192 1*11 +6=17. So output 17.\n\nIn C, this would correctly compute.\n\nAnother test case: n is even, like n=4. Then 4/2=2 * best2L.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nEdge case when n=0? But according to the problem statement, probably n is at least 1. But even if n=0, code would output 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct."
