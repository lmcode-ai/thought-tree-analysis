So for each line, we need to store an array of integers. So create a 2D array, where li[i] is a pointer to an array of integers (the elements for the i-th line, after the first), and li_lengths[i] is the number of elements in that array. But for the purpose of building the masks, the actual elements are needed. So for each li entry, loop through each element, find its index in q_elements, and set the mask. Now, code steps in C:\n\nImplement reading input: Read n and m.\n\nThen read m lines for li. Each line is read as a list of integers. First integer is ignored. The rest are stored as the li entry.

So q_elements will contain all unique elements from all li lists. Another possible issue is the use of __builtin_popcount. This is a GCC-specific function. To make the code more portable, we can compute the parity manually. For example:\n\nint parity = 0;\nunsigned int x = and_mask;\nwhile (x) {\n    parity ^= 1;\n    x &= x - 1; // clear the least significant set bit\n}\n\nThis loop counts the number of set bits modulo 2. So for each bit set, parity flips. So if the count is even, parity is 0; if odd, parity is 1. So replacing __builtin_popcount(and_mask) % 2 with this loop would make the code more portable. So modifying the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    unsigned int and_mask = s_mask & masks[i];\n    int parity = 0;\n    unsigned int x = and_mask;\n    while (x) {\n        parity ^= 1; x &= x - 1;\n    }\n    if (parity ! = p[i]) {\n        valid = 0;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nThis would be better for portability. Another possible issue is the initial allocation for nums in the li reading loop. Initially, nums is NULL, and count starts at 0.",

But the code computes v_size as n - q_size, which is incorrect if any elements in q are larger than n. So the original Python code is incorrect if the input has elements larger than n in the li lists. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps the input ensures that all elements in the li lists are between 1 and n. So the code assumes that all elements in li are in 1..n. But in the code translation to C, the in_q array is of size n+1. So elements larger than n would write to in_q beyond its allocated size, causing buffer overflow.

Oh right, the code uses itertools.combinations for generating subsets of the set q. That's a key part. So I need to replicate the combinations functionality in C.\n\nLet's look at the variables.

Wait, the Python code does list(map(int, input().split()))[1:], so for each of the m lines, it's reading all the integers except the first one. So each element in li is a list of integers excluding the first element of each line. Then p is read as a tuple of m integers.\n\nThen q is the set of all elements in li (summed into a single list), and r is the set from 1 to n. v is the difference between r and q, which are elements from 1 to n not present in any of the li lists. \n\nThe main logic is iterating over all possible subsets of q. For each subset, check if for each (u, w) in zip(li, p), the size of the intersection between the subset and u is even or odd based on w. If all conditions are met, add 2^len(v) to the answer. Because v is the set of elements not in any switches, they can be either on or off, hence multiplying by 2^v.\n\nNow, translating this to C. Let's think about the data structures.\n\nIn C, handling dynamic arrays is a bit more involved. The li variable in Python is a list of lists. So in C, maybe an array of pointers to arrays, each representing the switches for each condition. Also, each of these lists is the elements after the first in each input line. So for each of the m lines, read k elements, then store the rest (k elements minus the first) into li's entry.\n\nThen p is an array of integers, size m.\n\nThe set q is all the elements in li's lists. So need to collect all unique integers from those lists. Similarly, v is the elements from 1 to n not in q.\n\nIn C, handling sets can be done using arrays or bitmasks. But since the elements can be up to n, which could be large, using a boolean array to track presence might be better. So create an array (let's say 'in_q') of size n+1, initialized to 0. Then for each element in the li lists, mark in_q[element] = 1. Then v is the count of elements from 1 to n not in q. Wait, but in the Python code, v is a set. But in the answer calculation, when a subset s of q is chosen, the answer is multiplied by 2^len(v), because each element in v can be either included or not. So the actual elements in v don't matter, just the count. So perhaps we can compute the size of v as (n - size of q), since q contains all the elements present in any of the li lists, and r is 1..n. So v's size is n - |q|. But wait, in the code, q is a set made by summing all the lists in li and then converting to a set. So elements can be repeated in the lists but in q they are unique. So the size of q is the number of unique elements across all li lists. Then the size of v is n - |q|.\n\nSo maybe in C, we can track the unique elements in q. So create a boolean array 'in_q' of size n+1, and for each element in the li lists, set in_q[element] = true. Then the size of q is the count of elements where in_q is true. Then the size of v is n - q_size.\n\nBut for the subsets of q, we need to generate all possible subsets. Each subset is a combination of elements in q. Since q is a set, but the order might not be important. But in Python's combinations, the order is based on the order in the input. So perhaps in C, we can create a list (array) of the elements in q, sorted or in the order they were encountered. Then generating all subsets is equivalent to generating all possible subsets of this array. The code loops over i from 0 to len(q) inclusive, and for each i, generates all combinations of size i. So for each possible subset size, generate all possible subsets of that size.\n\nIn C, generating combinations can be done using recursive functions or iterative methods. However, for performance, especially with q_size being up to, say, 20, a recursive approach could work. But since m can be up to whatever, but in the worst case, the code could have q_size up to n. But if n is large, say 1e5, this approach would be impossible. Wait, but in the original Python code, the code loops through all subsets of q, which is O(2^k) where k is the size of q. If q is large, this would be impossible. So perhaps in the problem constraints, q is small. But without knowing the problem's constraints, we have to assume that the code is correct and feasible. So when translating to C, we need to handle subsets of q.\n\nSo for the code to be efficient, the size of q should be manageable. Let's proceed under the assumption that q is small enough (like up to 20 elements), otherwise the code would be too slow.\n\nSo, steps for the C code:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. For each of m lines, read the list elements (after the first element), and store them in a 2D array. Also, collect all elements in these lists to build the set q.\n\n3. Read p as an array of m integers.\n\n4. Compute q's elements (unique), and compute v's size as n - q_size.\n\n5. Generate all possible subsets s of q, and for each subset, check if for all m conditions, the size of the intersection of s and u_i is congruent to p_i mod 2. If all conditions are satisfied, add 2^v_size to the answer.\n\nSo the key challenges are:\n\n- Efficiently handling the subsets of q.\n\n- Checking the intersection with each u_i.\n\nLet's tackle each part.\n\nFirst, building the set q. So in C, perhaps create an array q_elements that contains all unique elements from the li lists. Then, for each element in the li lists, add them to q_elements if not already present. But since the order might not matter, perhaps we can use a hash or a boolean array to track which elements are already added.\n\nSo first, create a boolean array in_q of size n+1, initialized to false. Then, for each li list, loop through each element in the list, and if in_q[element] is false, set it to true and add the element to q_elements array. Wait, but this would add elements in the order they appear, but for combinations, the order doesn't matter. So the q_elements array is just a list of all unique elements present in any of the li lists. The order might affect the way combinations are generated, but since combinations are all possible subsets, the order doesn't affect correctness.\n\nOnce q_elements is built, the size is q_size = number of elements in the array. Then v_size = n - q_size.\n\nNext, generating all subsets of q_elements. For each subset, regardless of size, we can represent it as a bitmask. For example, for q_size elements, each subset can be represented by a bitmask of q_size bits, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding element in q_elements is included. So for each possible bitmask from 0 to 2^q_size - 1, we can check if the subset represented by the bitmask meets the conditions.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the loop is for i in 0 to len(q), and for each i, generate all combinations of size i. But generating all subsets is equivalent to iterating through all possible bitmasks, regardless of the number of set bits. So perhaps in C, instead of looping over subset sizes, we can loop through all possible bitmasks from 0 to (1 << q_size) - 1. For each bitmask, check the conditions. Then, if the subset satisfies all conditions, add 2^v_size to the answer. But in the Python code, it's for each possible subset size i, and for each combination of size i, check the conditions. So the code in Python loops through all possible subsets (of any size) of q. Because itertools.combinations(q, i) for i from 0 to len(q) gives all possible subsets. So the total number of subsets is 2^q_size, which is the same as iterating all bitmasks from 0 to 2^q_size -1.\n\nSo in C, the approach can be to generate all possible subsets via bitmask iteration, which is O(2^q_size) iterations. For each subset, represented by the bitmask, check each of the m conditions.\n\nBut how to check the intersection between the subset and u_i?\n\nSo for each condition i (from 0 to m-1), u_i is the list of elements in li[i], and p[i] is the required parity. The condition is that the number of elements in the subset s that are present in u_i must be congruent to p[i] modulo 2.\n\nSo for each subset s (represented by the bitmask), and for each u_i, compute the count of elements in s that are also in u_i, then check if that count mod 2 equals p[i].\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nWait, the subset s is a subset of q_elements. So each element in s is present in q_elements, which is the same as the elements in q. But u_i is a list of elements (from the input, after the first element). So u_i may contain elements that are not in q. However, since s is a subset of q, any element in u_i that is not in q will not be present in s. So for u_i, we can precompute which elements are in q, and for each u_i, create a bitmask indicating which elements of q_elements are present in u_i. Then, for a subset s represented by a bitmask, the intersection count is the number of bits set in (s & u_i_mask), and we need this to be mod 2 equal to p[i].\n\nYes. So for each u_i, create a mask that has a 1 in the position corresponding to the index in q_elements if that element is present in u_i. Then, the intersection size mod 2 is (number of set bits in (s_mask & u_i_mask)) % 2. Which is the same as the parity (even or odd) of the bits set in the AND result.\n\nBut calculating the parity can be done by XORing the bits. Wait, the parity is 1 if the count is odd, 0 otherwise. So how to compute that efficiently.\n\nAn efficient way is to compute the bitwise AND of s_mask and u_i_mask, then compute the parity of the resulting bits. For example, in C, for a given mask x, the parity can be computed with a built-in function (like __builtin_parity), which counts the number of set bits modulo 2.\n\nBut since the code needs to be portable, perhaps not relying on compiler-specific functions. Alternatively, precompute a parity lookup table for all possible masks. But the maximum mask size is q_size, which could be up to 20, leading to 2^20 masks, which is manageable (1MB for a byte per mask).\n\nAlternatively, for each u_i, precompute a mask, and for each s_mask, compute the AND with u_i's mask, then count the bits modulo 2.\n\nSo, the steps for each u_i:\n\n- Create a mask where each bit j is set if q_elements[j] is present in u_i.\n\nSo, for each element in u_i, check if it's in q_elements (since in the Python code, q is the set of all elements in li lists, so u_i's elements are all in q). Wait, no. Because u_i is part of the li lists, which are all collected into q. So any element in u_i must be in q. Therefore, all elements in u_i are present in q_elements. So for each element in u_i, we can find its index in the q_elements array (since they are unique), and set that bit in the mask.\n\nSo for each u_i, create a mask by iterating through its elements. For each element in u_i, find its index in q_elements (since all elements in u_i are in q), then set that bit in the mask.\n\nSo for example, if q_elements is [2,5,7], and u_i is [5,2], then the mask would be 110 (binary), which is 6 (bit 0 for 2, bit 1 for 5, bit 2 for 7; u_i has 2 and 5, so bits 0 and 1 are set).\n\nOnce we have these masks for all u_i, then for each subset s_mask, and for each u_i's mask, compute the parity of s_mask & u_i_mask. If all parities equal p[i], then the subset is valid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, m.\n\n2. Read m lines, each line starts with k_i followed by k_i elements. For each line, store the elements (after the first) in a 2D array li. Also, collect all elements into q_elements (as a set).\n\n3. Read the next line as p array (m elements).\n\n4. Create q_elements array, which is the list of unique elements in all li lists. Also, create in_q array to track which elements are in q.\n\n5. Compute the size of q (q_size) and v_size = n - q_size.\n\n6. Precompute for each u_i in li a mask, which is a bitmask representing which elements of q_elements are present in u_i.\n\n7. Iterate over all possible s_masks (from 0 to 2^q_size - 1). For each s_mask:\n\n   a. For each u_i's mask in the precomputed list:\n\n      i. Compute and_mask = s_mask & u_i_mask.\n\n      ii. Compute the parity (count of set bits in and_mask mod 2).\n\n      iii. Compare this parity with p[i]. If any u_i's parity does not match p[i], break and reject this subset.\n\n   b. If all u_i's parities match, add 2^v_size to the answer.\n\n8. After all subsets are processed, print the answer.\n\nNow, handling the masks. How to represent the masks? Since q_size can be up to, say, 20, a 32-bit integer would suffice. So for each u_i, store a mask as an unsigned integer (like unsigned int or uint32_t).\n\nSo, first, build q_elements:\n\n- Read all elements from the li lists, collect unique ones.\n\nBut how to read the li lists? For each of m lines, read the line, split into integers, skip the first, then collect the rest. In C, this can be done by reading each line as a string, tokenizing, converting to integers. Then, for each element in the list (after the first), add to a temporary array and mark in in_q.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nInitialize in_q as a boolean array (size n+1) initialized to false. Then, create a dynamic array (like a linked list or a dynamically allocated array) to store q_elements.\n\nFor each line in li:\n\n   Read k followed by k elements. For each of the k elements (excluding the first), check if in_q[element] is false. If so, set in_q[element] to true and add the element to q_elements array. But wait, since the first element is k, which is the count of the elements (including itself?), no. Wait, in the Python code, for each line in li, it's list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]. So for example, if a line is \"3 1 4 5\", the code takes [1,4,5] as the list. So in C, for each of the m lines, read all the integers, skip the first, and process the rest.\n\nSo for each line, read all integers, the first is the count (but not used), and then the rest are the elements. So, for example:\n\nLine input: \"3 1 4 5\" \u2192 elements are [1,4,5], which are added to the li entry. Then, 1,4,5 are added to the set q (so in_q is updated for each of them).\n\nBut in the code, when building q, elements can be added multiple times, but the set ensures uniqueness. So in C, for each element in the li lists (after the first of each line), check if in_q[element] is false. If so, set to true and add to q_elements. Otherwise, ignore.\n\nOnce all elements are processed, q_elements is an array of all unique elements from all li lists.\n\nOnce q_elements is built, q_size is the length of this array.\n\nThen, for each u_i in li (each is a list of elements after the first), we need to create a mask for it. For each element in u_i, find its index in q_elements (since all elements in u_i are in q_elements), and set the corresponding bit in the mask.\n\nFor example, if q_elements is [1,4,5], then for a u_i containing [1,5], the mask would be 101 in binary (bits 0 and 2 are set), which is 5 in decimal.\n\nSo for each u_i, we loop through its elements, and for each element, find its index in q_elements. To find the index efficiently, we can create a hash map (like a lookup table) from element value to its index in q_elements. Since the elements are from 1 to n and in_q is tracked, we can create an array index_of of size n+1, where index_of[element] is the index in q_elements. For elements not in q, it's undefined (but in our case, all elements in u_i are in q, so index_of is valid).\n\nSo:\n\nCreate index_of array (size n+1), initialized to -1 or some invalid value. Then, for each i in 0 to q_size-1:\n\n   index_of[ q_elements[i] ] = i;\n\nThus, for any element in q_elements, index_of[element] gives its position in the array.\n\nNow, for each u_i in li, loop through each element in u_i's list, get the index via index_of[element], and set that bit in the mask.\n\nOnce all masks are precomputed, the rest is straightforward.\n\nNow, generating all subsets via bitmask:\n\nLoop from s_mask = 0 to s_mask < (1 << q_size). For each s_mask, check each u_i's mask.\n\nFor each u_i, compute and_mask = s_mask & u_i_mask. Then compute the parity (count of bits set in and_mask) mod 2. If this equals p[i], continue. Else, break and proceed to next subset.\n\nIf all u_i checks pass, then ans += (1 << v_size). Because 2^v_size is the number of ways to choose the elements not in q (v_size elements, each can be on or off).\n\nWait, in the Python code, ans += 2 ** len(v). Because len(v) is the number of elements not in q. Each can be included or not in the final answer, regardless of the conditions, because those elements are not present in any u_i. So their inclusion does not affect any of the conditions. So for each valid subset s of q, there are 2^v_size possible subsets when including elements from v.\n\nIn C, this translates to adding (1 << v_size) to the answer for each valid subset s.\n\nSo now, the steps are clear.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, if q is empty (no elements in any li lists). Then q_size is 0. Then the loop over s_mask runs once (s_mask=0). For each u_i, u_i's mask is 0 (since there are no elements in q), so the and_mask is 0. The parity is 0. So compare with p[i]. If all p[i] are 0, then ans += 2^v_size. Else, not.\n\nAnother case: when v_size is zero (all elements are in q), then 2^0 =1, so each valid subset adds 1 to ans.\n\nNow, code implementation steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read m lines for li. For each line:\n\n   a. Read all integers in the line.\n\n   b. The first integer is k, which is the count of integers in the line (including itself). So the actual elements are the next k-1 integers.\n\n   c. But in the Python code, the code is [1:], which skips the first element regardless of its value. So even if the first element is not the count, it's skipped. So in the input, each line for li is a list where the first element is any integer (but in practice, it's the count followed by the elements). But according to the code, it's irrelevant. So for each line, split into integers, skip the first, and the rest are part of the li entry.\n\n   So for example, even if the line is \"2 5 7\", the li entry would be [5,7].\n\n3. Read the next line for p array.\n\n4. Build q_elements and index_of array.\n\n5. Precompute masks for each u_i.\n\n6. Iterate over all subsets, check conditions, accumulate ans.\n\nNow, in C:\n\nImplementing dynamic arrays for li entries. Each li entry is a list of integers (after the first in the line). So for each line, we need to store an array of integers. So create a 2D array, where li[i] is a pointer to an array of integers (the elements for the i-th line, after the first), and li_lengths[i] is the number of elements in that array.\n\nBut for the purpose of building the masks, the actual elements are needed. So for each li entry, loop through each element, find its index in q_elements, and set the mask.\n\nNow, code steps in C:\n\nImplement reading input:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read m lines for li.\n\nEach line is read as a list of integers. First integer is ignored. The rest are stored as the li entry.\n\nBut how to read a line of integers in C? Use fgets to read the line, then split into tokens using strtok.\n\nBut in code submission, sometimes input is read via stdin, and using functions like scanf. However, for lines with unknown numbers of integers, it's better to read the entire line and process it.\n\nBut for the purposes of this code, perhaps the input can be read using scanf, but need to handle lines properly. Alternatively, use a loop to read all integers in the line.\n\nBut in practice, this can be tricky. So perhaps the code can read all integers at once, using a buffer.\n\nAlternatively, read each line as a string, split into tokens, then process each token as an integer.\n\nBut this is more code.\n\nLet's outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, include headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\nDefine dynamic arrays for li entries.\n\nThen:\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n    getchar(); // consume newline\n\n    // Read m lines for li\n    int **li = (int **)malloc(m * sizeof(int *));\n    int *li_sizes = (int *)malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n    bool *in_q = (bool *)calloc(n + 1, sizeof(bool)); // track elements in q\n    int q_capacity = 10;\n    int q_size = 0;\n    int *q_elements = (int *)malloc(q_capacity * sizeof(int));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        char line[1000000]; // assuming line is not longer than this\n        fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n        char *token = strtok(line, \" \\n\");\n        int k = 0;\n        int *nums = NULL;\n        int count = 0;\n        // first token is the count (but we ignore it)\n        if (token != NULL) {\n            token = strtok(NULL, \" \\n\"); // skip first token\n        }\n        while (token != NULL) {\n            int num = atoi(token);\n            if (count == 0) {\n                nums = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));\n            } else {\n                nums = (int *)realloc(nums, (count + 1) * sizeof(int));\n            }\n            nums[count++] = num;\n\n            // Check if num is already in q_elements\n            if (!in_q[num]) {\n                in_q[num] = true;\n                if (q_size >= q_capacity) {\n                    q_capacity *= 2;\n                    q_elements = (int *)realloc(q_elements, q_capacity * sizeof(int));\n                }\n                q_elements[q_size++] = num;\n            }\n\n            token = strtok(NULL, \" \\n\");\n        }\n        li[i] = nums;\n        li_sizes[i] = count;\n    }\n\n    // Read p array\n    int *p = (int *)malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Create index_of array\n    int *index_of = (int *)malloc((n + 1) * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n        index_of[i] = -1;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < q_size; i++) {\n        index_of[q_elements[i]] = i;\n    }\n\n    // Precompute masks for each u_i\n    unsigned int *masks = (unsigned int *)malloc(m * sizeof(unsigned int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        unsigned int mask = 0;\n        for (int j = 0; j < li_sizes[i]; j++) {\n            int element = li[i][j];\n            int idx = index_of[element];\n            mask |= (1U << idx);\n        }\n        masks[i] = mask;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate v_size\n    int v_size = n - q_size;\n\n    // Iterate through all subsets\n    long long ans = 0;\n    int total_subsets = (1 << q_size);\n    for (int s_mask = 0; s_mask < total_subsets; s_mask++) {\n        int valid = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n            unsigned int and_mask = s_mask & masks[i];\n            int parity = __builtin_popcount(and_mask) % 2;\n            if (parity != p[i]) {\n                valid = 0;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (valid) {\n            ans += (1LL << v_size);\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n\n    // Free all allocated memory\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        free(li[i]);\n    }\n    free(li);\n    free(li_sizes);\n    free(in_q);\n    free(q_elements);\n    free(p);\n    free(index_of);\n    free(masks);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but there's a problem here. The code reads the p array after reading the li lines. But after the li lines, the code uses fgets to read the li lines, but after that, when reading p, the code uses scanf. But after fgets, the input buffer may have remaining characters. For example, after the m lines of li, the next line is the p array, which is m integers. So the code for reading p uses a loop with scanf(\"%d\"), which will read the next m integers. But if the li lines were read with fgets, the newline after the li lines is already consumed. So the p array is read correctly.\n\nBut suppose after reading the m lines for li, the code calls fgets to read the p line. But in the code above, after the for loop for reading li lines, the code reads p using scanf(\"%d\") in a loop. That's correct because each call to scanf will skip whitespace and read the next integer. So even if the p array is on a single line with m integers separated by spaces, this code will read them correctly.\n\nAnother issue is when building the q_elements array. The code adds each element from the li lists to q_elements only if it's not already present (since in_q[num] is checked). So q_elements will contain all unique elements from all li lists.\n\nAnother possible issue is the use of __builtin_popcount. This is a GCC-specific function. To make the code more portable, we can compute the parity manually. For example:\n\nint parity = 0;\nunsigned int x = and_mask;\nwhile (x) {\n    parity ^= 1;\n    x &= x - 1; // clear the least significant set bit\n}\n\nThis loop counts the number of set bits modulo 2. So for each bit set, parity flips. So if the count is even, parity is 0; if odd, parity is 1.\n\nSo replacing __builtin_popcount(and_mask) % 2 with this loop would make the code more portable.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    unsigned int and_mask = s_mask & masks[i];\n    int parity = 0;\n    unsigned int x = and_mask;\n    while (x) {\n        parity ^= 1;\n        x &= x - 1;\n    }\n    if (parity != p[i]) {\n        valid = 0;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nThis would be better for portability.\n\nAnother possible issue is the initial allocation for nums in the li reading loop. Initially, nums is NULL, and count starts at 0. For each token, we realloc nums to count+1. But when count is 0, after the first token, we allocate space for 1 integer. This is correct.\n\nBut what if a line for li is empty (after skipping the first token)? For example, a line like \"0\" (after skipping first token, no elements). But according to the Python code, li is a list of lists, where each list is the elements after the first. So if the line has only one element (the first), the list is empty. In that case, li_sizes[i] would be 0, and masks[i] would be 0. Then, for any subset s_mask, and_mask is 0. So the parity is 0. If p[i] is 1, then the condition fails. So in code, if a li entry has no elements, then the mask is 0. So for that entry, the parity must be equal to p[i]. If p[i] is 1, then the parity is 0, which doesn't match. So the subset is invalid.\n\nBut in the code, when reading li entries, if the line after the first token has no elements, then li_sizes[i] is 0, and masks[i] is 0.\n\nAnother point is that the code uses 1U << idx. For idx up to q_size (which could be up to 30), using unsigned int is okay. But if q_size is larger than 31, this would cause issues. However, as earlier noted, the original code's approach would be O(2^q_size), which is only feasible for q_size up to around 20. So assuming that the problem's constraints keep q_size manageable, this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nFor example, let's say n=3, m=2.\n\nli lines:\n\n2 1 2 \u2192 elements [1,2]\n\n1 3 \u2192 elements [3]\n\nThen p = [0, 1].\n\nThen q_elements would be [1,2,3], q_size=3, v_size=0.\n\nv_size is 3-3=0. So each valid subset contributes 2^0 =1.\n\nNow, for each subset of {1,2,3}:\n\nCheck if:\n\nFor the first u_i (elements [1,2]):\n\nmask is 1 << 0 | 1 <<1 \u2192 0b11 \u2192 3.\n\nFor the second u_i (elements [3]):\n\nmask is 1<<2 \u2192 4.\n\np is [0, 1].\n\nSo for a subset s_mask:\n\nThe and_mask for u_0 is s_mask & 3.\n\nThe parity must be 0.\n\nThe and_mask for u_1 is s_mask &4. The parity must be 1.\n\nSo which subsets satisfy both conditions?\n\nLet's consider all 8 subsets.\n\ns_mask=0 (no elements):\n\nand_mask for u0 is 0 \u2192 parity 0 \u2192 ok.\n\nand_mask for u1 is 0 \u2192 parity 0 \u2192 which is not equal to 1. So invalid.\n\ns_mask=1 (element 1):\n\nu0: 1 &3 =1 \u2192 parity 1 \u2192 not 0. invalid.\n\ns_mask=2 (element 2):\n\nu0: 2 &3= 2 \u2192 parity 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns_mask=3 (elements 1 and 2):\n\nu0: 3 &3=3 \u2192 parity 1+1=0 mod 2 \u2192 parity 0. Ok.\n\nu1: 3 &4=0 \u2192 parity 0 \u2192 not equal to 1. invalid.\n\ns_mask=4 (element3):\n\nu0: 0 \u2192 parity 0. Ok.\n\nu1:4 &4=4 \u2192 parity 1 \u2192 ok. So valid. So ans +=1.\n\ns_mask=5 (1 and3):\n\nu0: 5 &3=1 \u2192 parity 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns_mask=6 (2 and3):\n\nu0:6&3=2 \u2192 parity 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns_mask=7 (1,2,3):\n\nu0:7&3=3 \u2192 parity 0. Ok.\n\nu1:7&4=4 \u2192 parity 1. Ok. So valid. ans +=1.\n\nSo total ans is 2 (from subsets 4 and7). But v_size is 0, so each contributes 1.\n\nSo the code would output 2.\n\nBut according to the code, the answer is ans += 2^v_size. v_size is 0, 2^0=1. So each valid subset adds 1. So yes, the answer is 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this case correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when q is empty.\n\nn=2, m=1.\n\nli line: 1 5 \u2192 no, because the line would have first element 1 (k=1), then the rest is 5, but the code reads the line as split into tokens. Wait, no. Wait, if the line is \"1 5\", then after skipping the first token (1), the remaining token is \"5\", which is added to the li entry. But since n=2, but 5 is larger than n. Wait, but in the code, in_q is of size n+1. So if n=2, in_q is size 3. So in_q[5] would be out of bounds. Oh no! That's a bug.\n\nWait, no. The code initializes in_q as (n+1) elements. But if the elements in the input can be larger than n, then in_q[element] would be accessing memory out of the array, leading to undefined behavior.\n\nSo the code assumes that all elements in the li lists are between 1 and n. Which is probably correct according to the problem's constraints, but if not, then this code has a buffer overflow.\n\nBut the original Python code's problem statement may assume that all elements are within 1..n. For example, the code computes r as set(range(1, n+1)), and v = r - q. So if any elements in the li lists are outside of 1..n, then q would include those elements, and r - q would still be 1..n minus those elements. But in the code, the v_size is n - q_size, which is wrong in that case. For example, if n=3, and q contains 4, then r is {1,2,3}, q is {4}, v is {1,2,3}, v_size is 3 -1=2 (but q_size is 1). But in reality, v is {1,2,3} (size 3), so v_size should be 3. But according to the code's calculation, v_size is 3-1=2, which is wrong.\n\nSo the code has a bug here. Because q is the set of all elements in the li lists, which may include elements larger than n. Then r (1..n) minus q is the set of elements from 1 to n not in q. So the size of v is (n) - (number of elements in q that are <=n). But the code computes v_size as n - q_size, which is incorrect if any elements in q are larger than n. \n\nSo the original Python code is incorrect if the input has elements larger than n in the li lists. But according to the problem's constraints, perhaps the input ensures that all elements in the li lists are between 1 and n. So the code assumes that all elements in li are in 1..n.\n\nBut in the code translation to C, the in_q array is of size n+1. So elements larger than n would write to in_q beyond its allocated size, causing buffer overflow.\n\nSo this code is correct only if the input elements are in 1..n. So we need to assume that the problem's input is correct.\n\nBut in the original Python code, the code may have the same issue. For example, if the input has elements larger than n, then v would be r (1..n) minus q (elements in li lists), which may include elements larger than n. So the code may compute v_size as n - len(q), which is wrong. But the original code's problem statement may have constraints that all elements in the li lists are between 1 and n.\n\nSo assuming that all elements in the li lists are valid (1..n), the code is correct.\n\nIn the C code, the code should handle this. So when reading elements, it's assumed that they are between 1 and n. If not, then in_q[num] would be out of bounds. So the code has undefined behavior in such cases. But the problem's constraints probably ensure that all elements are in 1..n.\n\nNow, back to the test case where the code has q_size=0 (but m=1 and the li line has an element larger than n).\n\nBut assuming correct input, the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible error in the code is the calculation of v_size. The code calculates v_size as n - q_size. But q_size is the number of unique elements in the li lists. But some of these elements may be outside of 1..n, so the actual number of elements in q that are in 1..n could be less than q_size. Then the size of v would be n - (number of elements in q that are in 1..n). But the code's v_size is n - q_size, which is incorrect in this case. However, the problem's input likely ensures that all elements are in 1..n.\n\nThus, the code is correct under the problem's constraints.\n\nNow, the code handles the q_elements correctly, and all the mask calculations.\n\nNow, the code should be correct."
