In C, we can compute these angles as doubles. Let's see:\n\ndouble minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\ndouble hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n\nThen the difference is the absolute value of (minute_angle - hour_angle). But in Python, the code computes C as the absolute difference. Wait, the Python code has: C = abs(360 / 60 * m - 360 / 12 * h - 360 / 12 / 60 * m) Wait, 360/60 is 6 per minute. 360/12 is 30 per hour. The third term is 30/60 = 0.5 per minute. So the hour angle is 30*h + 0.5*m. So the code subtracts (30h +0.5m) from (6m). So the difference is (6m - (30h +0.5m)) = 5.5m -30h. Then take absolute value. So in C, the code would be:\n\ndouble angle_diff = fabs( (6.0 * m) - (30.0 * h + 0.5 * m) );\n\nAlternatively, simplifying: 6m - 30h -0.5m = 5.5m -30h. So maybe compute that. But perhaps it's better to compute as in the original code for clarity. Then, if the difference is more than 180 degrees, subtract from 360. So:\n\nif (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n    angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n}\n\nThen compute the cosine of the angle in radians. In Python, math.radians converts degrees to radians, then math.cos. In C, we can use the cos function from math.h, but need to convert degrees to radians manually. Because C's math library uses radians. So:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (M_PI / 180.0);\ndouble cosC = cos(radians);\n\nThen apply the law of cosines: sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cosC).",

Alternatively, compute the radians as angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0). Because acos(-1.0) is \u03c0. So perhaps compute:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0);\n\nThat way, it's portable and doesn't rely on M_PI being defined. So in code:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0); That's better because it's more portable. So replacing M_PI with acos(-1.0) / 180.0. So the code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, h, m;\n    scanf(\"%d % d % d % d\", &a, &b, &h, &m);\n\n    double minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\n    double hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n    double angle_diff = fabs(minute_angle - hour_angle); if (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n        angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n    }\n\n    double radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0);\n    double cosC = cos(radians);\n\n    double a_d = a;\n    double b_d = b;\n    double distance = sqrt(a_d*a_d + b_d*b_d - 2.0 * a_d * b_d * cosC);\n\n    printf(\"%.15f\\n\", distance);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work. Testing with sample inputs. Sample Input 1:\n\n3 4 9 0\n\nIn this case, h=9, m=0. Minute angle: 0 degrees. Hour angle: 30*9 +0.5*0=270 degrees. Difference is 270-0=270. Since over 180, subtract from 360: 90 degrees. cos(90 degrees) is 0. Distance is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2 - 2*3*4*0) = 5. So the output is 5.0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me read through the Python code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe problem involves calculating the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock, then using the law of cosines to find the distance between the ends of the two hands. The inputs are a, b (lengths of the hands), h (hour), and m (minutes). \n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Calculate the angles of each hand.\n2. Find the absolute difference between them, adjust if over 180 degrees.\n3. Compute the cosine of that angle.\n4. Apply the law of cosines formula to get the distance.\n\nNow, translating each part to C.\n\nFirst, input handling. In Python, they use input().split() and map to integers. In C, I'll use scanf to read four integers from stdin. So variables a, b, h, m. Declare them as int.\n\nNext, calculate the angles. The Python code computes the minute angle as 360/60 * m. That's 6 degrees per minute. For the hour angle, it's 360/12 * h plus 360/(12*60)*m. Because each hour is 30 degrees (360/12), and each minute adds 0.5 degrees (30/60) to the hour hand. So the total hour angle is 30*h + 0.5*m.\n\nIn C, we can compute these angles as doubles. Let's see:\n\ndouble minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\ndouble hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n\nThen the difference is the absolute value of (minute_angle - hour_angle). But in Python, the code computes C as the absolute difference. Wait, the Python code has:\n\nC = abs(360 / 60 * m - 360 / 12 * h - 360 / 12 / 60 * m)\n\nWait, 360/60 is 6 per minute. 360/12 is 30 per hour. The third term is 30/60 = 0.5 per minute. So the hour angle is 30*h + 0.5*m. So the code subtracts (30h +0.5m) from (6m). So the difference is (6m - (30h +0.5m)) = 5.5m -30h. Then take absolute value.\n\nSo in C, the code would be:\n\ndouble angle_diff = fabs( (6.0 * m) - (30.0 * h + 0.5 * m) );\n\nAlternatively, simplifying: 6m - 30h -0.5m = 5.5m -30h. So maybe compute that.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute as in the original code for clarity.\n\nThen, if the difference is more than 180 degrees, subtract from 360. So:\n\nif (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n    angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n}\n\nThen compute the cosine of the angle in radians. In Python, math.radians converts degrees to radians, then math.cos. In C, we can use the cos function from math.h, but need to convert degrees to radians manually. Because C's math library uses radians. So:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (M_PI / 180.0);\ndouble cosC = cos(radians);\n\nThen apply the law of cosines: sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cosC).\n\nIn C, the variables a and b are integers, so we need to cast them to double when squaring to avoid integer overflow, but since a and b are inputs, the user could input large values, but in practice, the code in C would use pow(a,2) or a*a. But since a and b are integers, when we square them, better to cast to double first. So:\n\nsqrt( (double)(a*a) + (double)(b*b) - 2 * a * b * cosC )\n\nWait, but in C, a and b are integers. So a * a could overflow if a is large. For example, if a is 1e9, then a*a is 1e18, which is larger than the maximum 32-bit integer (around 2e9), so 64-bit integers can hold up to 9e18. But in Python, integers can be arbitrary precision. So in C, if the inputs are such that a*a could overflow, then using (double)a * (double)a is better. Because doubles can hold up to around 1e308, but with loss of precision. However, given that in the original Python code, a and b are read as integers, but when squared, they become integers and then converted to floats. So in C, converting a and b to doubles before squaring is necessary to avoid integer overflow.\n\nSo in C, better to cast a and b to doubles first. So:\n\ndouble a_d = (double)a;\ndouble b_d = (double)b;\n\nThen compute a_d * a_d + b_d * b_d - 2 * a_d * b_d * cosC.\n\nSo the sqrt of that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nInclude necessary headers. For math functions, need #include <math.h>. Also, for input, use #include <stdio.h>.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, h, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a, &b, &h, &m);\n\n    double minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\n    double hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n    double angle_diff = fabs(minute_angle - hour_angle);\n    if (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n        angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n    }\n\n    double radians = angle_diff * (M_PI / 180.0);\n    double cosC = cos(radians);\n\n    double a_sq = (double)a * (double)a;\n    double b_sq = (double)b * (double)b;\n    double result = sqrt(a_sq + b_sq - 2 * a * b * cosC);\n\n    printf(\"%.15f\\n\", result); // or just %f, but match Python's precision\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, a and b are integers. When doing 2*a*b*cosC, in Python, a and b are integers but multiplied by a float. In C, if a and b are integers, then 2*a*b would be integer multiplication. But if cosC is a double, then 2*a*b*cosC would convert the integer to double. However, since a and b could be large, multiplying them as integers could cause integer overflow. So better to cast them to doubles before multiplying.\n\nSo perhaps, better to compute 2.0 * a_d * b_d * cosC.\n\nSo in the code:\n\ndouble a_d = (double)a;\ndouble b_d = (double)b;\n\ndouble result = sqrt(a_d*a_d + b_d*b_d - 2.0 * a_d * b_d * cosC);\n\nYes, that's safer.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nThen, the code should cast a and b to doubles once, and use those variables in the calculation.\n\nSo:\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, h, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a, &b, &h, &m);\n\n    // compute angles\n    double minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\n    double hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n    double angle_diff = fabs(minute_angle - hour_angle);\n    if (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n        angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n    }\n\n    // compute cosine of the angle\n    double radians = angle_diff * M_PI / 180.0;\n    double cosC = cos(radians);\n\n    // compute the distance\n    double a_d = (double)a;\n    double b_d = (double)b;\n    double distance = sqrt(a_d*a_d + b_d*b_d - 2.0 * a_d * b_d * cosC);\n\n    printf(\"%.15f\\n\", distance);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, the print statement uses math.sqrt, which returns a float. The C code's printf uses %f. The precision in Python's print is whatever the default is, but in C, using %.15f would give 15 decimal digits. However, the original code's precision may vary. To match the output exactly, perhaps use a high precision. But in practice, since the problem probably expects a certain number of decimal places, perhaps using the default in C (6 decimal digits) is sufficient. However, looking at the Python code: when you print a float in Python, it may show more digits. For example, if the result is sqrt(...), which could be a floating-point number with more digits. The Python code prints the full precision of the float (which is double-precision). So in C, to get the same number of digits, we can use %.15f, which gives 15 digits after the decimal point, which is more than enough for the double's precision.\n\nAlternatively, in C, using printf(\"%.10f\\n\", distance); might be sufficient, but the safest way is to use the maximum precision. However, the problem likely accepts any correct output as the judge would have some tolerance for floating point errors. But to match exactly, perhaps use %.15f.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in C, the value of M_PI is not defined in math.h unless you define _USE_MATH_DEFINES before including it. Wait, in some compilers like GCC, you need to define _USE_MATH_DEFINES before including math.h to get M_PI. Alternatively, on Unix systems, it's usually available. But to be safe, perhaps define it. So, if compiling on Windows, for example, you need to define that.\n\nBut since the user is writing code that should compile, perhaps add:\n\n#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES\n#include <math.h>\n\nBut that's platform-dependent. Alternatively, compute M_PI as 3.14159265358979323846.\n\nBut to avoid that complication, perhaps the code should define M_PI if it's not already defined.\n\nBut maybe in the coding competition environment, M_PI is available. Alternatively, compute the radians as angle_diff multiplied by (3.14159265358979323846 / 180.0).\n\nBut since the original code uses math.radians, which uses a precise value, the C code should use the same.\n\nSo perhaps in the code, replace M_PI with a direct value. Alternatively, check if M_PI is defined.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, include the defines before math.h.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES\n#include <math.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nBut the order matters. So #define _USE_MATH_DEFINES must come before #include <math.h>.\n\nBut in some environments, this may not be necessary. To make it portable, perhaps hardcode the value of pi.\n\nBut given that the original code uses math.radians, which uses a precise value, better to use the same as the Python math module.\n\nAlternatively, compute the radians as angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0). Because acos(-1.0) is \u03c0.\n\nSo perhaps compute:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0);\n\nThat way, it's portable and doesn't rely on M_PI being defined.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndouble radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0);\n\nThat's better because it's more portable.\n\nSo replacing M_PI with acos(-1.0) / 180.0.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, h, m;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d %d\", &a, &b, &h, &m);\n\n    double minute_angle = 6.0 * m;\n    double hour_angle = 30.0 * h + 0.5 * m;\n    double angle_diff = fabs(minute_angle - hour_angle);\n    if (angle_diff > 180.0) {\n        angle_diff = 360.0 - angle_diff;\n    }\n\n    double radians = angle_diff * (acos(-1.0) / 180.0);\n    double cosC = cos(radians);\n\n    double a_d = a;\n    double b_d = b;\n    double distance = sqrt(a_d*a_d + b_d*b_d - 2.0 * a_d * b_d * cosC);\n\n    printf(\"%.15f\\n\", distance);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 4 9 0\n\nIn this case, h=9, m=0.\n\nMinute angle: 0 degrees.\n\nHour angle: 30*9 +0.5*0=270 degrees.\n\nDifference is 270-0=270. Since over 180, subtract from 360: 90 degrees.\n\ncos(90 degrees) is 0.\n\nDistance is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2 - 2*3*4*0) = 5. So the output is 5.0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 4 10 40\n\nBut perhaps another test case.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nAnother example: when h=12, m=0.\n\nMinute angle: 0.\n\nHour angle: 0.\n\nDifference 0. cos(0) =1.\n\nDistance sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 - 2ab*1) = |a -b|.\n\nSo if a=5 and b=3, the distance is 2.\n\nSo the code should output 2.0.\n\nAnother test case where the angle is 180 degrees. Then cos(180) is -1, so the distance is sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 + 2ab) = a +b.\n\nBut the code would check if the angle difference is over 180. For example, if the difference is 180, it's not adjusted. So angle_diff is 180.0, which is not greater than 180.0, so it's kept. So code would compute sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -2ab*(-1)) = sqrt( (a +b)^2 ) = a +b.\n\nSo the code should handle that correctly.\n\nNow, in C, the code uses doubles, which should handle the precision as in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Integer overflow when calculating a*a or b*b. So casting to double first is essential. For example, if a is 1e5, a*a as int would be 1e10, which is okay for 32-bit int (max is 2e9), but 1e10 is bigger. So 32-bit integers would overflow. But in C, the variables a and b are read as int. So if the inputs are larger than what can fit in an int, the code will have issues. However, the problem probably assumes that the inputs fit into the data types. So assuming that a and b are within the range of int, which is implementation-defined. But in practice, in programming contests, the inputs are within the 32-bit integer range.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the translated C code should be as written."
