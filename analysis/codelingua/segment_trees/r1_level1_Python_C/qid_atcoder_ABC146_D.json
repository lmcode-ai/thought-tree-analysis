So for example, if the input edges are (1,2), (2,3), etc., after converting to 0-based, they would be stored as (0,1), (1,2) etc., and E's insertion order is the same as input order. But during BFS, the edges are colored, and when E's values are printed, the order is the same as insertion (input) order. Therefore, in the C code, the edges array should be built in the same order as the input edges. Then, after BFS, the colors are stored in the edges array in the order of input.",

That's correct. Now, implementing this in C.\n\nFirst, the data structures:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int u;\n    int v;\n    int color;\n};\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *neighbors; // array of neighbor nodes\n    int *edge_indices; // array of edge indices\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nAdjList *graph; Then, for each node, the graph is an array of AdjList structs. But in C, we can't have a dynamic array inside a struct unless we use pointers. So:\n\nAdjList *graph;\n\nThen, during initialization, for N nodes:\n\ngraph = malloc(N * sizeof(AdjList));\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    graph[i].neighbors = NULL;\n    graph[i].edge_indices = NULL;\n    graph[i].size = 0;\n    graph[i].capacity = 0;\n}\n\nBut when adding a neighbor, for a node i, we need to append to its neighbors and edge_indices arrays. For example, when adding a neighbor 'neighbor' and edge index 'ei' to node 'i':\n\nif (graph[i].size >= graph[i].capacity) {\n    int new_cap = (graph[i].capacity == 0) ? 4 : graph[i].capacity * 2;\n    graph[i].neighbors = realloc(graph[i].neighbors, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n    graph[i].edge_indices = realloc(graph[i].edge_indices, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n    graph[i].capacity = new_cap;\n}\ngraph[i].neighbors[graph[i].size] = neighbor;\ngraph[i].edge_indices[graph[i].size] = ei;\ngraph[i].size++;\n\nThis way, each adjacency list can dynamically expand. Now, the BFS:\n\nWe need a queue, which can be implemented with a dynamic array. For BFS, the maximum possible size is N nodes. int *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\nint front = 0, rear = 0;\n\nvisited array: int visited[N] = {0};\n\nnode2color array: int node2color[N];\n\nInitialize node2color to -1. queue[rear++] = 0;\nvisited[0] = 1;\nint K = -1;\n\nThen, while front < rear:\n\nint q = queue[front++];\nint color = 0;\n\nFor each neighbor in graph[q].neighbors:\n\nLoop through graph[q].size times:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < graph[q].size; i++) {\n    int nex = graph[q].neighbors[i];\n    if (visited[nex]) continue;\n    visited[nex] = 1;\n    color++; if (color == node2color[q]) color++;\n    node2color[nex] = color;\n    // set the edge's color\n    int ei = graph[q].edge_indices[i];\n    edges[ei].color = color;\n    queue[rear++] = nex;\n}\n// After processing all neighbors, check if color is larger than K\nif (color > K) K = color; Wait, but in the Python code, the color is reset for each neighbor.",

So this approach is correct. Now, testing this code. Possible test case:\n\nSample Input:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input for N=3 would have N-1=2 edges. Wait, no. Wait, in the code, N is the number of nodes, and edges are N-1. So for N=3, two edges. But the code expects N-1 edges. Let's consider the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\nThis would create a tree. The BFS starts at 0 (assuming input is 1-based converted to 0-based). Wait, in the code, the input edges are read as a and b, which are then decremented by 1. So input of 1 2 becomes a=0, b=1. Then, u=0, v=1. The edge is stored as (0,1). Then, when adding to adjacency lists:\n\na=0's neighbors include 1, edge index 0. b=1's neighbors include 0, edge index 0. Second edge: 2 3 becomes a=1, b=2. u=1, v=2. Stored in edges[1] as (1,2). Adj lists: a=1's neighbors include 2 (edge index 1). b=2's neighbors include 1 (edge index 1). So BFS starts at 0. Processing node 0. Its neighbors are 1.\n\n1 is unvisited. color starts at 0. color becomes 1. node2color[0] is -1. So color 1 is assigned. node2color[1] = 1. edge index 0's color is 1. Add 1 to queue. After processing all neighbors of 0, K is 1. Next, process node 1. Its neighbors are 0 (visited) and 2 (unvisited). Also, edge index 0 (0's neighbor) and 1 (2's neighbor). For neighbor 0: visited, skip. For neighbor 2: unvisited. color starts at 0 (for node 1's neighbors).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does. \n\nThe main function reads N, then constructs a graph using adjacency lists (G) and a dictionary E to store edge colors. Then it performs a BFS starting from node 0 to color the edges such that adjacent edges from the same node have different colors. The goal is to find the minimum number of colors needed (K) and output each edge's color.\n\nHmm, translating this to C. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the data structures. In Python, they use deque for G and a dictionary E with tuples as keys. In C, I'll need to represent the adjacency list. Maybe as an array of dynamic arrays. Since the nodes are numbered up to N-1, I can use an array of pointers, each pointing to a dynamic array (like using a struct with a pointer and size). But handling dynamic arrays in C is a bit tedious. Alternatively, precompute the maximum possible edges each node can have, but that might not be efficient. Wait, in the code, during BFS, each neighbor is processed once. So maybe for each node, store its adjacent nodes as a linked list or using a dynamic array.\n\nWait, in Python, G is a list of deques. Each deque contains the adjacent nodes. So for each node, we have a list of connected nodes. So in C, I'll need to create an array of pointers to arrays (or structs) that hold the adjacent nodes. But how to handle that?\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is a tree (since N-1 edges are read), each node's adjacency list can be stored as an array. So for each node, we can have a list of connected nodes. Let's think: each edge is stored in both directions (since when a and b are read, both G[a] and G[b] are appended). So in C, for each node, the adjacency list is a dynamic array. So, perhaps using a struct like:\n\nstruct Node {\n    int* edges;\n    int count;\n    int capacity;\n};\n\nBut that's a bit complex. Alternatively, for each node, pre-allocate an array of size N-1 (since in a tree, each node can have up to N-1 edges). But that's memory inefficient. Alternatively, since it's a tree, the number of edges per node is O(1) average, but for worst case (like a star-shaped tree), one node has N-1 edges.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the adjacency list as a list of pointers. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nAnother thing: the BFS uses a deque (queue) for BFS. In C, we can implement a queue using a dynamic array with front and rear pointers. Or use a linked list-based queue.\n\nThe E dictionary in Python is a map where the key is a tuple (a, b) sorted as min and max, and the value is the color. In C, since the edges are stored as pairs (a, b) where a < b, perhaps we can represent the edges in a way that allows us to look up the color. But for a tree with N nodes, there are N-1 edges. So maybe we can precompute all edges, store their a and b (with a < b), and have an array of colors. The problem is how to map each edge (a, b) to its index in the array.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the edges are added in the loop where a and b are read. For each i from 0 to N-2, the edges are stored in E with (a, b) where a and b are processed to be ordered as min and max. So the edges are stored in the dictionary as sorted pairs. The BFS then assigns colors to these edges.\n\nIn C, perhaps we can represent the edges as a struct array. Each edge has a pair of nodes (a, b) with a < b, and a color. But during BFS, when processing an edge from q to nex, we need to find the edge (min(q, nex), max(q, nex)) and set its color.\n\nBut how to efficiently look up the edge in C? Since in Python, the dictionary uses tuples as keys, but in C, we need a way to hash or index these pairs.\n\nAlternative approach: for each edge, when building the adjacency lists, store the index of the edge in the E array. Then, during BFS, when processing an edge from q to nex, we can find the index of the edge (q, nex) or (nex, q) and set the color accordingly.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think. When building the edges, for each pair a and b (after a and b are converted to 0-based indices), we can create a struct for each edge. Let's create an array of edges, each with a, b, and color. Then, for each node's adjacency list, when adding a neighbor, we can also note which edge index it corresponds to. Wait, but each edge is bidirectional. For example, when a is connected to b, the adjacency list of a includes b, and vice versa. So, perhaps when building the adjacency list for each node, each entry can store the neighbor and the edge index.\n\nYes! So during the input phase, for each edge (a, b), we can create a new edge in the edges array (with a < b), and then for both a and b, when adding each other to their adjacency lists, we also store the index of the edge. Then, during BFS, when moving from node q to nex, the edge between q and nex is known (since the adjacency list entry for nex in q's list has the edge index). Then, we can directly set the color in that edge's entry.\n\nWait, this might work. Let's see:\n\n1. When reading each edge, first, for each pair a and b (after converting to 0-based), we sort them into (u, v) where u < v. Then, add this edge to the edges array. So edges are stored in the array as u, v, and color. Each edge has a unique index in the array (from 0 to N-2).\n\n2. Then, for each node in a and b's adjacency lists, when adding the neighbor, we also store the index of the edge. For example, when a is connected to b via edge index k, then in a's adjacency list, each entry has the neighbor (b) and the edge index k. Similarly for b's adjacency list, the entry for a has edge index k.\n\nThis way, during BFS, when we process a node q and iterate through its neighbors, for each neighbor nex, the edge between q and nex is edge index k (from the adjacency list). Then, we can set the color for that edge index k.\n\nThis approach would allow us to avoid the dictionary and directly access the edge via the index stored in the adjacency list.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read N-1 edges. For each, store them in an array (edges) as u, v (sorted). Also, for each edge, create adjacency entries for both u and v, each pointing to the edge's index.\n\nSo the adjacency list for each node is an array of structs containing the neighbor and the edge index.\n\nThen, during BFS, when moving from q to nex, the edge index is known, so we can set the color of that edge.\n\nThis way, we don't need a dictionary to look up the edge. The edge index is directly stored in the adjacency list.\n\nSo in C, the data structures would be:\n\n- A struct Edge { int u; int v; int color; };\n\nEdge *edges; // array of N-1 edges.\n\nFor the adjacency list:\n\nEach node has a list of neighbors, each with the edge index.\n\nSo, for each node, we can have a dynamic array of structs:\n\nstruct AdjEntry {\n    int neighbor;\n    int edge_index;\n};\n\nThen, for each node, AdjEntry *adj; along with a count and capacity.\n\nBut managing dynamic arrays in C is a bit tedious. Alternatively, since the number of edges per node can be up to N-1, but in practice, it's a tree, perhaps for each node, pre-allocate an array of size equal to the number of edges connected to it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, when building the adjacency list, for each node, count the number of edges connected to it first. But that would require two passes. Alternatively, use a linked list for each node's adjacency entries.\n\nBut linked lists can be slow. Alternatively, use an array that grows as needed with realloc.\n\nYes. So, for each node, have:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *neighbors;\n    int *edge_indices;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nAdjList *graph;\n\nInitialize each AdjList's neighbors and edge_indices as dynamic arrays. When adding a new neighbor, append to the array, expanding capacity if necessary.\n\nSo for each edge (a, b), after sorting into (u, v), we add the edge to the edges array. Then, for u, we add an entry to its AdjList with neighbor v and the edge index. For v, add an entry with neighbor u and the same edge index.\n\nThis way, during BFS, when processing a node q, for each neighbor in its AdjList, we can get the edge index and set the color.\n\nNow, the BFS part. The BFS uses a queue. In C, implement a queue using a dynamic array or a linked list. Let's use a dynamic array with front and rear indices. For example:\n\nint *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\nint front = 0, rear = 0;\n\nThen, enqueue by queue[rear++] = element. Dequeue by front++. Check empty by front == rear.\n\nBut for the BFS, the visited array is needed. So, a visited array of size N.\n\nThe node2color array in the Python code keeps track of the color assigned to each node. Wait, no, wait the node2color array is for the next nodes. Let me look again.\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nnode2color is an array where for each node, it stores the color that was used for the edge from its parent. Then, when coloring the children edges, if the parent's color is the same as the current color, increment color.\n\nWait, no. Let's look at the BFS function:\n\ndef bfs(v, N, G, E):\n    visited = [0] * N\n    queue = deque()\n    K = -1\n    node2color = [-1 for _ in range(N)]\n    queue.append(v)\n    visited[v] = 1\n    while queue:\n        q = queue.popleft()\n        color = 0\n        for nex in G[q]:\n            if visited[nex]:\n                continue\n            visited[nex] = 1\n            color += 1\n            if color == node2color[q]:\n                color += 1\n            node2color[nex] = color\n            E[(min(q, nex), max(q, nex)] = color\n            queue.append(nex)\n        K = max(K, color)\n    return K\n\nSo, node2color[nex] is the color used for the edge from q to nex. Then, when processing the next neighbor of q, color starts at 0, and increments for each unvisited neighbor. If the color is the same as node2color[q] (the color of the edge from q's parent to q), then skip it. So this way, the edges from q to its children use colors starting from 1, but not using the color of the edge leading to q (node2color[q]).\n\nBut in the C code, since the edges are stored in an array, and each adjacency entry has the edge index, during BFS, when moving from q to nex, we can get the edge index, set its color to the current color (after checking and incrementing if needed), and then set node2color[nex] to that color.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the color is assigned to the edge (q, nex), and stored in E. Then, when processing the children of nex, the color of that edge is in node2color[nex], and the children of nex will skip that color.\n\nSo in C, the node2color array is needed. Each time a node is added to the queue, its edge's color is stored in node2color[nex].\n\nSo, to implement this in C:\n\nWe'll have a node2color array (int array of size N), initialized to -1.\n\nThen, during BFS:\n\nStart with node v (0 in main). Mark as visited. Enqueue. Then, while queue is not empty:\n\nDequeue q.\n\nInitialize color to 0.\n\nIterate through each neighbor in G[q] (adjacency list of q). For each neighbor nex:\n\nIf visited, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nMark as visited.\n\nIncrement color.\n\nIf color equals node2color[q], increment color again.\n\nSet node2color[nex] to color.\n\nSet the edge's color (using the edge index stored in the adjacency entry) to color.\n\nEnqueue nex.\n\nUpdate K to be the maximum between K and color.\n\nBut wait, in the Python code, K is updated as max(K, color) after processing all neighbors of q. Because color is the maximum color assigned to the current node's edges. So after processing all neighbors, the maximum color used for this node is color, and K is updated if it's larger.\n\nSo in C, after processing all neighbors of q, compare K with color and set K to the maximum.\n\nNow, the main steps:\n\nImplement the data structures as discussed.\n\nIn the main function:\n\nRead N.\n\nInitialize the edges array with N-1 elements.\n\nInitialize the adjacency lists for each node.\n\nRead each edge, process a and b to 0-based, sort into u and v (u < v). Then, add this edge to the edges array (edges[i].u = u, edges[i].v = v, edges[i].color = 0). Then, for both u and v, add an adjacency entry to each other with the edge index i.\n\nOnce all edges are processed, perform BFS starting at 0.\n\nAfter BFS, K is the maximum color used. Then, print K, followed by the colors of all edges in the order they were input.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the edges are stored in E in the order they are processed during BFS. However, when outputting the colors, the code prints the E.values() in the order they were added to E. Wait, no: in the Python code, when building E, the edges are added in the order they are read (since the for loop for i in N-1 steps adds them to E). But during BFS, the edges' colors are updated. Then, when printing, the code loops through E.values() and prints them in the order of insertion. So the order of the edges in the output is the same as the input order. Because when the edges are read, they are added to E in the input order, but during BFS, the colors are updated. However, the output is the values of E in the order the edges were added (i.e., the order of input).\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nfor i in range(N-1):\n    a, b = ... \n    G[a].append(b)\n    G[b].append(a)\n    E[(a, b)] = 0  # but after a and b are processed to be 0-based, but when stored in E, the key is (min(a, b), max(a, b)), which is sorted.\n\nWait, no. Let's look:\n\nAfter reading a and b, they are converted to 0-based using map(lambda x: int(x)-1, ...). Then, the code adds the pair (a, b) to E as (min(a, b), max(a, b)), and sets it to 0. So the E dictionary's keys are the edges in sorted order. But when iterating through E.values() in the end, the order is insertion order. Wait, in Python 3.7+, dictionaries preserve insertion order. So the order in which the edges were added to E is the same as the order of input. So the output of the colors is in the input order.\n\nBut in the code, during input processing, when the edges are read, for each a and b, after converting to 0-based, they are stored in E as (min(a, b), max(a, b)), but the order in which they are added to E is based on the order of input. So for example, if the input edges are (1,2), (2,3), etc., after converting to 0-based, they would be stored as (0,1), (1,2) etc., and E's insertion order is the same as input order. But during BFS, the edges are colored, and when E's values are printed, the order is the same as insertion (input) order.\n\nTherefore, in the C code, the edges array should be built in the same order as the input edges. Then, after BFS, the colors are stored in the edges array in the order of input. Then, when printing, we can just iterate through the edges array and print each color.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because the edges array is built in the order of input. Each edge is added to the array in the order they are read, and their colors are set during BFS. Then, when outputting the colors, we can simply loop through the edges array and print each edge's color.\n\nYes. So in C:\n\nedges is an array of struct Edge { int u; int v; int color; }.\n\nIn the input phase, for each of N-1 edges:\n\nRead a and b (convert to 0-based by subtracting 1).\n\nCompute u and v as min and max of a and b.\n\nStore in edges[i] as u, v, color 0.\n\nThen, for both a and b, add to their adjacency lists an entry with neighbor (b for a, a for b) and the edge index i.\n\nSo during BFS, when processing an edge from q to nex, the edge index is known, and the color can be set.\n\nTherefore, after BFS, the edges array has the correct colors in the order of input.\n\nThus, when outputting the colors, just loop through the edges array and print each color.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in C.\n\nFirst, the data structures:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int u;\n    int v;\n    int color;\n};\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *neighbors; // array of neighbor nodes\n    int *edge_indices; // array of edge indices\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nAdjList *graph;\n\nThen, for each node, the graph is an array of AdjList structs.\n\nBut in C, we can't have a dynamic array inside a struct unless we use pointers. So:\n\nAdjList *graph;\n\nThen, during initialization, for N nodes:\n\ngraph = malloc(N * sizeof(AdjList));\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    graph[i].neighbors = NULL;\n    graph[i].edge_indices = NULL;\n    graph[i].size = 0;\n    graph[i].capacity = 0;\n}\n\nBut when adding a neighbor, for a node i, we need to append to its neighbors and edge_indices arrays.\n\nFor example, when adding a neighbor 'neighbor' and edge index 'ei' to node 'i':\n\nif (graph[i].size >= graph[i].capacity) {\n    int new_cap = (graph[i].capacity == 0) ? 4 : graph[i].capacity * 2;\n    graph[i].neighbors = realloc(graph[i].neighbors, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n    graph[i].edge_indices = realloc(graph[i].edge_indices, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n    graph[i].capacity = new_cap;\n}\ngraph[i].neighbors[graph[i].size] = neighbor;\ngraph[i].edge_indices[graph[i].size] = ei;\ngraph[i].size++;\n\nThis way, each adjacency list can dynamically expand.\n\nNow, the BFS:\n\nWe need a queue, which can be implemented with a dynamic array. For BFS, the maximum possible size is N nodes.\n\nint *queue = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\nint front = 0, rear = 0;\n\nvisited array: int visited[N] = {0};\n\nnode2color array: int node2color[N];\n\nInitialize node2color to -1.\n\nqueue[rear++] = 0;\nvisited[0] = 1;\nint K = -1;\n\nThen, while front < rear:\n\nint q = queue[front++];\nint color = 0;\n\nFor each neighbor in graph[q].neighbors:\n\nLoop through graph[q].size times:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < graph[q].size; i++) {\n    int nex = graph[q].neighbors[i];\n    if (visited[nex]) continue;\n    visited[nex] = 1;\n    color++;\n    if (color == node2color[q]) color++;\n    node2color[nex] = color;\n    // set the edge's color\n    int ei = graph[q].edge_indices[i];\n    edges[ei].color = color;\n    queue[rear++] = nex;\n}\n// After processing all neighbors, check if color is larger than K\nif (color > K) K = color;\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the color is reset for each neighbor. For each neighbor, color starts at 0, then increments for each unvisited neighbor. But in the Python code, the for loop is over G[q], which is the adjacency list. For each nex in G[q], if not visited, color increments, etc.\n\nSo in C, the code should be:\n\ncolor starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each neighbor in graph[q].neighbors:\n\nBut we need to process only unvisited neighbors. So, for each neighbor in the adjacency list of q:\n\nCheck if visited. If not, process.\n\nBut in the adjacency list, the entries are for all neighbors. However, since the graph is a tree, each node except the root has one parent (the node from which it was discovered), and other entries are children. But during BFS, once a node is visited, all entries in the adjacency list may include the parent (already visited) and children (unvisited).\n\nSo the code in C would have to loop through all entries in the adjacency list of q, and for each nex, check if visited. If not, process.\n\nSo:\n\nint color = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < graph[q].size; i++) {\n    int nex = graph[q].neighbors[i];\n    if (visited[nex]) continue;\n    // Process this neighbor\n    visited[nex] = 1;\n    color += 1;\n    if (color == node2color[q]) {\n        color += 1;\n    }\n    node2color[nex] = color;\n    int ei = graph[q].edge_indices[i];\n    edges[ei].color = color;\n    queue[rear++] = nex;\n}\nif (color > K) {\n    K = color;\n}\n\nYes. Because for each unvisited neighbor of q, we assign a color, incrementing color each time. So the first unvisited neighbor gets color 1, next 2, etc. But if color matches the parent's color (node2color[q]), we increment again.\n\nSo this logic is correct.\n\nOnce BFS completes, K is the maximum color used.\n\nThen, in main:\n\nPrint K.\n\nThen, print each edge's color in the order they were input. Since the edges array is built in the input order, just loop through edges[0..N-2] and print their color.\n\nNow, implementing this in C.\n\nBut there are some issues to handle:\n\n- Memory allocation and deallocation. Need to free all allocated memory.\n\n- Handling the adjacency list's dynamic arrays.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps we can ignore freeing memory as the program ends, but in practice, it's good to free.\n\nBut for the code submission, perhaps it's not required.\n\nAnother thing: the order in which the neighbors are processed in BFS. In Python's deque, popping from the left (popleft) is O(1). In C's queue implementation using a dynamic array and front pointer, this is also O(1). So the order of processing nodes is the same as in Python.\n\nBut in the adjacency lists, the order of neighbors may affect the color assignment, but the problem requires that the colors are valid, but the actual color numbers may vary as long as they're correct. However, the code must produce the same K as the Python code, but the edge colors may vary in order. However, the problem's output for edge colors is in the order of input, not in the order of processing. So as long as the edges array is built in the input order, the output colors will be correct.\n\nNow, let's draft the code.\n\nFirst, the includes:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nThen, struct Edge:\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int u;\n    int v;\n    int color;\n};\n\nAdjList struct:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    int *neighbors;\n    int *edge_indices;\n    int size;\n    int capacity;\n} AdjList;\n\nThe BFS function:\n\nint bfs(int start, int N, AdjList *graph, struct Edge *edges) {\n    int *visited = (int *)calloc(N, sizeof(int));\n    int *node2color = (int *)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        node2color[i] = -1;\n    }\n    int *queue = (int *)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n    int front = 0, rear = 0;\n    int K = -1;\n\n    queue[rear++] = start;\n    visited[start] = 1;\n\n    while (front < rear) {\n        int q = queue[front++];\n        int color = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < graph[q].size; i++) {\n            int nex = graph[q].neighbors[i];\n            if (visited[nex]) {\n                continue;\n            }\n            visited[nex] = 1;\n            color++;\n            if (color == node2color[q]) {\n                color++;\n            }\n            node2color[nex] = color;\n            int ei = graph[q].edge_indices[i];\n            edges[ei].color = color;\n            queue[rear++] = nex;\n        }\n\n        if (color > K) {\n            K = color;\n        }\n    }\n\n    free(visited);\n    free(node2color);\n    free(queue);\n    return K;\n}\n\nMain function:\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    struct Edge *edges = (struct Edge *)malloc((N-1) * sizeof(struct Edge));\n    AdjList *graph = (AdjList *)malloc(N * sizeof(AdjList));\n\n    // Initialize adjacency lists\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        graph[i].neighbors = NULL;\n        graph[i].edge_indices = NULL;\n        graph[i].size = 0;\n        graph[i].capacity = 0;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n        a--; // convert to 0-based\n        b--;\n\n        // Ensure u < v\n        int u = a < b ? a : b;\n        int v = a < b ? b : a;\n\n        edges[i].u = u;\n        edges[i].v = v;\n        edges[i].color = 0;\n\n        // Add to adjacency lists of a and b\n        // For a:\n        if (graph[a].size >= graph[a].capacity) {\n            int new_cap = graph[a].capacity == 0 ? 4 : graph[a].capacity * 2;\n            graph[a].neighbors = realloc(graph[a].neighbors, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n            graph[a].edge_indices = realloc(graph[a].edge_indices, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n            graph[a].capacity = new_cap;\n        }\n        graph[a].neighbors[graph[a].size] = b;\n        graph[a].edge_indices[graph[a].size] = i;\n        graph[a].size++;\n\n        // For b:\n        if (graph[b].size >= graph[b].capacity) {\n            int new_cap = graph[b].capacity == 0 ? 4 : graph[b].capacity * 2;\n            graph[b].neighbors = realloc(graph[b].neighbors, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n            graph[b].edge_indices = realloc(graph[b].edge_indices, new_cap * sizeof(int));\n            graph[b].capacity = new_cap;\n        }\n        graph[b].neighbors[graph[b].size] = a;\n        graph[b].edge_indices[graph[b].size] = i;\n        graph[b].size++;\n    }\n\n    int K = bfs(0, N, graph, edges);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", K);\n    for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", edges[i].color);\n    }\n\n    // Free memory\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        free(graph[i].neighbors);\n        free(graph[i].edge_indices);\n    }\n    free(graph);\n    free(edges);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the code for adding to the adjacency lists, a and b are the original nodes (before sorting), which may not be u and v. But when adding to the adjacency list of a, the neighbor is b (if a is u or not?), and the edge index is i.\n\nNo, the code is correct. Because when processing an edge (a, b) from input, after converting to 0-based, we sort them into u and v for the edge's u and v. But for the adjacency lists of a and b, we need to add each other as neighbors. For example, a is connected to b, and vice versa. So, for a's adjacency list, add b as a neighbor, and the edge index i. Similarly for b's adjacency list, add a as a neighbor, and edge index i. This way, during BFS, when processing a's neighbor b, the edge index is i, which is the correct index in the edges array.\n\nYes. Because the edge between a and b is stored in edges[i], regardless of whether a is u or v. Because the adjacency entries for a and b both reference the same edge index i. So when processing the edge from a to b, the color is set in edges[i].color.\n\nYes, because the edge between a and b is stored once in edges[i], and both a and b's adjacency lists point to the same edge index. So during BFS, when moving from a to b, the edge index is i, and the color is set for edges[i].color. Similarly, when moving from b to a (but in BFS, since visited is marked, this would not happen).\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nNow, testing this code.\n\nPossible test case:\n\nSample Input:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input for N=3 would have N-1=2 edges. Wait, no. Wait, in the code, N is the number of nodes, and edges are N-1. So for N=3, two edges.\n\nBut the code expects N-1 edges.\n\nLet's consider the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\nThis would create a tree. The BFS starts at 0 (assuming input is 1-based converted to 0-based).\n\nWait, in the code, the input edges are read as a and b, which are then decremented by 1. So input of 1 2 becomes a=0, b=1. Then, u=0, v=1. The edge is stored as (0,1). Then, when adding to adjacency lists:\n\na=0's neighbors include 1, edge index 0.\n\nb=1's neighbors include 0, edge index 0.\n\nSecond edge: 2 3 becomes a=1, b=2. u=1, v=2. Stored in edges[1] as (1,2).\n\nAdj lists: a=1's neighbors include 2 (edge index 1). b=2's neighbors include 1 (edge index 1).\n\nSo BFS starts at 0.\n\nProcessing node 0. Its neighbors are 1.\n\n1 is unvisited. color starts at 0.\n\ncolor becomes 1. node2color[0] is -1. So color 1 is assigned. node2color[1] = 1. edge index 0's color is 1.\n\nAdd 1 to queue.\n\nAfter processing all neighbors of 0, K is 1.\n\nNext, process node 1.\n\nIts neighbors are 0 (visited) and 2 (unvisited). Also, edge index 0 (0's neighbor) and 1 (2's neighbor).\n\nFor neighbor 0: visited, skip.\n\nFor neighbor 2: unvisited. color starts at 0 (for node 1's neighbors).\n\ncolor increments to 1. node2color[1] is 1. So since color (1) equals node2color[1] (1), color increments to 2. node2color[2] = 2. edge index 1's color is 2. Add 2 to queue.\n\nAfter processing, color is 2. K becomes max(1, 2) = 2.\n\nNext, process node 2. Its neighbors are 1 (visited) and no others. So no color assigned. K remains 2.\n\nFinal K is 2. Output:\n\n2\n1\n2\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling possible memory allocation errors. For example, in the realloc calls, but the code assumes that realloc succeeds, which may not be the case in practice. However, for competition programming, such checks are usually omitted.\n\nAnother potential issue: in the BFS function, when color is 0 and node2color[q] is -1 (for the root node), the condition (color == node2color[q]) would be (0 == -1), which is false. So no problem.\n\nThus, the C code should work as expected."
