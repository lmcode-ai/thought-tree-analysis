But wait, when takahashi is 0, that means leftOver is <=0. So leftOver is a - c <=0. So leftOver can be negative, so abs(leftOver) is c -a. Then, cookies[1] (b) minus that value. So, the second value is b if takahashi is positive, else max(0, b - (c -a)) because leftOver is a-c <=0, so abs is c -a. But let's think: when takahashi is 0, then leftOver = a - c <=0. So the else case for the second part is max(0, b - (c -a)). So that's b + a - c. Wait, because abs(leftOver) is c -a, so the expression is b - (c -a) = a + b - c. So the max between 0 and (a + b - c). So in code, when takahashi is 0, then the second value is max(0, a + b - c). But in the original code, when takahashi is 0, it's max(0, cookies[1] - abs(leftOver)). So cookies[1] is b, abs(leftOver) is c - a (since leftOver is a -c <=0). So it's b - (c -a) = a + b -c. Then max(0, that). So in C, the second number is (if takahashi >0) then b, else the max of 0 and (a + b -c). So how to compute that.

Else, it's ( (a + b - c) >0 ? (a + b -c) : 0 ) But wait, when takahashi is zero, it's because leftOver <=0. So in that case, a -c <=0 \u2192 a <=c. So a +b -c could be positive or negative. For example, if a=3, c=5, then a -c = -2, leftOver is -2 \u2192 takahashi 0. Then, a +b -c is 3 + b -5 = (b -2). So if b is 3, that's 1. If b is 1, then 3+1-5= -1, which becomes 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Python code does. \n\nThe code first reads a list of integers from the input, split by spaces. Then it calculates 'leftOver' as the first element minus the third element of the list. Takahashi is the maximum between 0 and leftOver. Then, there's a print statement that outputs two values separated by a space. The first is takahashi, and the second depends on whether takahashi is greater than 0. If it is, it's cookies[1], else it's the max between 0 and cookies[1] minus the absolute value of leftOver.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do in C is read three integers from the input. In Python, the input is split into a list, so in C, I'll probably use scanf to read three integers into variables a, b, c, since the original code uses cookies[0], cookies[1], cookies[2]. Let's name them a, b, c for clarity.\n\nThen compute leftOver as a - c. Then takahashi is max(0, leftOver). In C, the max function can be implemented using a ternary operator or using the <math.h> library's functions, but since math's max might not be safe for all types, better to use a ternary here.\n\nThen, the second part of the output is either b (if takahashi > 0) else max(0, b - abs(leftOver)). Wait, let me check the original code again. The original code says: str(max(0, cookies[1] - abs(leftOver)) when takahashi is not greater than 0. But wait, when takahashi is 0, that means leftOver is <=0. So leftOver is a - c <=0. So leftOver can be negative, so abs(leftOver) is c -a. Then, cookies[1] (b) minus that value. So, the second value is b if takahashi is positive, else max(0, b - (c -a)) because leftOver is a-c <=0, so abs is c -a.\n\nBut let's think: when takahashi is 0, then leftOver = a - c <=0. So the else case for the second part is max(0, b - (c -a)). So that's b + a - c. Wait, because abs(leftOver) is c -a, so the expression is b - (c -a) = a + b - c. So the max between 0 and (a + b - c). So in code, when takahashi is 0, then the second value is max(0, a + b - c). But in the original code, when takahashi is 0, it's max(0, cookies[1] - abs(leftOver)). So cookies[1] is b, abs(leftOver) is c - a (since leftOver is a -c <=0). So it's b - (c -a) = a + b -c. Then max(0, that).\n\nSo in C, the second number is (if takahashi >0) then b, else the max of 0 and (a + b -c). So how to compute that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a, b, c.\n\nCompute leftOver = a - c.\n\ntakahashi = (leftOver > 0) ? leftOver : 0;\n\nThen, compute the second variable: if takahashi >0, then second is b. Else, it's ( (a + b - c) >0 ? (a + b -c) : 0 )\n\nBut wait, when takahashi is zero, it's because leftOver <=0. So in that case, a -c <=0 \u2192 a <=c. So a +b -c could be positive or negative. For example, if a=3, c=5, then a -c = -2, leftOver is -2 \u2192 takahashi 0. Then, a +b -c is 3 + b -5 = (b -2). So if b is 3, that's 1. If b is 1, then 3+1-5= -1, which becomes 0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint a, b, c;\nscanf(\"%d %d %d\", &a, &b, &c);\n\nint leftOver = a - c;\nint takahashi = leftOver > 0 ? leftOver : 0;\n\nint second;\nif (takahashi > 0) {\n    second = b;\n} else {\n    int temp = a + b - c;\n    second = temp > 0 ? temp : 0;\n}\n\nThen print takahashi and second.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the second part is (str(cookies[1]) if takahashi >0 else ...). So when takahashi is 0, the else is taken. But takahashi is the max(0, leftOver), so when leftOver is negative, takahashi is 0, so the else is entered.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, putting it all into C code. Also, in C, we need to include the necessary headers. So for printf and scanf, we need #include <stdio.h>. Also, the variables are all integers.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b, c;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &a, &b, &c);\n\n    int leftOver = a - c;\n    int takahashi = leftOver > 0 ? leftOver : 0;\n\n    int second;\n    if (takahashi > 0) {\n        second = b;\n    } else {\n        int temp = a + b - c;\n        second = temp > 0 ? temp : 0;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", takahashi, second);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, the else part is max(0, cookies[1] - abs(leftOver)). So let's check that:\n\nabs(leftOver) when leftOver is a -c and negative is c -a. So cookies[1] (b) minus abs(leftOver) is b - (c -a) \u2192 a + b -c. Which is the same as the temp variable. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo this code should work. Let me test it with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: input 10 20 5 \u2192 a=10, c=5 \u2192 leftOver=5, takahashi=5>0 \u2192 second is 20. Output 5 20.\n\nOriginal Python code: cookies = [10,20,5], leftOver=10-5=5, takahashi=5. Then the print is '5 20', which matches.\n\nTest case 2: input 5 10 10 \u2192 a=5, c=10 \u2192 leftOver= -5 \u2192 takahashi=0. Then second part is max(0, 5 +10 -10) =5. So output 0 5.\n\nPython code: takahashi is 0, so else part: max(0, 10 - abs(-5)) \u2192 10-5=5. So output 0 5.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=2, c=5. leftOver is -2 \u2192 takahashi 0. second is 3+2-5=0 \u2192 max 0. So output 0 0.\n\nOriginal code would compute max(0, 2 - 2) \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=6, b=3, c=5. leftOver=1 \u2192 takahashi=1. second is 3. Output 1 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct."
