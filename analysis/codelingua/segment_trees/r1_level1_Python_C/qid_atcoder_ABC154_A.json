It reads S, T, A, B, and U. Then it calls solve, which checks if U is equal to S or T. If U is S, decrement A; if U is T, decrement B. Then print A and B.\n\nIn C, I'll have to handle input differently. Python uses sys.stdin and splits the input into tokens, but in C, I can use scanf to read the inputs. The strings S, T, U can be read as character arrays. Need to make sure they don't overflow, but the problem probably assumes the inputs are within safe limits.\n\nThe solve function in Python takes the parameters and modifies A and B. In C, since function parameters are passed by value, I can modify copies of A and B inside the function. Alternatively, since we just need to print them after checking, maybe just pass the parameters and compute the new values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read S, T, A, B, U from input. Since in Python they are read as space-separated tokens, in C I can use scanf with %s for the strings and %d for the integers.\n\n2. Compare U with S and T.

But since the function is simple, maybe just handle it in main.\n\nSo in main:\n\n- Read S, T as strings (char arrays)\n- Read A and B as integers\n- Read U as string\n- Compare U with S using strcmp. If equal, subtract 1 from A.\n- Compare U with T, if equal, subtract 1 from B.\n- Print A and B.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\nRead the input strings and integers. How to handle the input? Let's think about the input format. The original code uses split on any whitespace, so the input is a line with all tokens separated by spaces. For example, the input could be \"S T A B U\" all on one line, or split into multiple lines. But in C, scanf with %s will read until whitespace, so even if the input is split into lines, it should read correctly.\n\nSo in C:\n\nchar S[100], T[100], U[100];\nint A, B;\n\nscanf(\"%s %s %d %d %s\", S, T, &A, &B, U);\n\nWait, but the order is S, T, A, B, U.
