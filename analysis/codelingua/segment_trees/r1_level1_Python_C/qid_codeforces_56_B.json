So code:\n\n// copy A to B\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) B[i] = A[i];\n\n// reverse from mn to mx\n\nint start = mn;\n\nint end = mx;\n\nwhile (start < end) {\n\n    int temp = B[start];\n\n    B[start] = B[end];\n\n    B[end] = temp;\n\n    start++;\n\n    end--;\n\n}\n\n// check if sorted\n\nint is_sorted = 1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < N-1; i++) {\n\n    if (B[i] > B[i+1]) {\n\n        is_sorted = 0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (is_sorted) {\n\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1);\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n}\n\nSo putting it all together. Now, handling the input. How to read the array? Using scanf in a loop. Potential code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    int A[100000], B[100000];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int mn = N;  // initial mn is higher than possible indices (0-based)\n\n    int mx = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (A[i] ! = (i+1)) {  // because in the problem, 1-based positions are compared to elements\n\n            if (i < mn) {\n\n                mn = i;\n\n            }\n\n            if (i > mx) {\n\n                mx = i;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (mx == -1) {\n\n        printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        // create B as a copy of A\n\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n            B[i] = A[i];\n\n        }\n\n        // reverse B from mn to mx\n\n        int start = mn;\n\n        int end = mx;\n\n        while (start < end) {\n\n            int temp = B[start];\n\n            B[start] = B[end];\n\n            B[end] = temp;\n\n            start++;\n\n            end--;\n\n        }\n\n        // check if B is sorted\n\n        int is_sorted = 1;\n\n        for (int i=0; i < N-1; i++) {\n\n            if (B[i] > B[i+1]) {\n\n                is_sorted = 0;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (is_sorted) {\n\n            printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1);\n\n        } else {\n\n            printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but in the original code, the check is whether the reversed array is sorted. So yes, this code should replicate that.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's start by understanding what the Python code does. \n\nThe problem seems to be about finding a subarray to reverse such that the entire array becomes sorted. If reversing a certain subarray makes the array sorted, we output the 1-based indices of the start and end of that subarray. Otherwise, we output 0 0.\n\nFirst, let's look at the Python code step by step. \n\nThe code reads N and then a list A. It initializes mn and mx. mn is set to N+1 (a value higher than any possible index) and mx to -1. Then, it loops through each element. For each index i, if the element at that position (A[i]) is not equal to i+1 (since Python uses 0-based indices but the problem seems to expect 1-based positions), it updates mn and mx to track the first and last positions where this condition occurs. \n\nIf after the loop, mx is still -1 (meaning no such elements were found), it prints 0 0. Otherwise, it reverses the subarray from mn to mx (inclusive) and checks if the resulting array is sorted. If yes, print mn+1 and mx+1 (converting to 1-based), else print 0 0.\n\nNow, translating this to C. \n\nThe main steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the array A.\n2. Find mn and mx where A[i] != i+1.\n3. If none found, output 0 0.\n4. Else, reverse the subarray from mn to mx.\n5. Check if the entire array is now sorted. If yes, output mn+1 and mx+1, else 0 0.\n\nChallenges in C:\n\n- Dynamic array handling. In Python, list slicing and reversing is easy, but in C, we have to manually reverse the array portion.\n- Checking if the array is sorted. In Python, comparing to sorted(A) is straightforward, but in C, we need to loop and check each element.\n- Handling 1-based vs 0-based indices. The problem uses 1-based for the output, but the code uses 0-based indices for processing.\n\nLet's outline the steps in C:\n\nFirst, read N. Then read the array. Since N can be up to... Well, the problem doesn't specify, but in C we need to use a fixed size array or dynamically allocate. Assuming N is manageable, maybe use a static array of size, say, 100000. Let's declare A[100000], and read N, then read N elements into A.\n\nThen, find mn and mx. Initialize mn to N (since it's the maximum possible index +1, but in C indices are 0-based), mx to -1. Then loop from i=0 to N-1. For each i, check if A[i] != i+1. If so, compare mn to i and take the minimum, and mx to i and take maximum.\n\nIf after the loop, mx is still -1, output 0 0. Otherwise, reverse the subarray from mn to mx.\n\nReversing in C: swap elements from mn and mx, moving towards the center. For example, for indices from mn to mx, swap A[mn] and A[mx], then mn+1 and mx-1, etc., until the pointers meet.\n\nThen, check if the array is sorted. To check if sorted, loop from 0 to N-2, check if each element is <= the next. If any element is greater, then it's not sorted.\n\nIf the array is sorted after reversal, output mn+1 and mx+1 (since in the problem the output is 1-based). Else, output 0 0.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, after reversing, it checks if sorted(A) == A. So the check is for the entire array being in non-decreasing order. So in C, after reversing, we need to check that the array is in ascending order.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead the array.\n\nFind mn and mx.\n\nIf mx is -1, output 0 0.\n\nElse:\n\nReverse the subarray from mn to mx.\n\nCheck if the entire array is sorted.\n\nIf yes, output mn+1 and mx+1.\n\nElse, output 0 0.\n\nBut after reversing, the code in Python creates a new array. However, in C, reversing the subarray in place would modify the original array. So after reversing, we need to check whether the array is sorted.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, after reversing, it's stored in A. So the original array is modified. Wait, in Python code:\n\nA = A[: mn] + A[mn: (mx + 1)][:: - 1] + A[(mx + 1):]\n\nThis creates a new list A which is the original up to mn, then the reversed subarray from mn to mx, then the rest. So the original array is not modified. Then, they check if sorted(A) == A. So in C, we have to reverse the subarray in a copy of the original array, check if that copy is sorted, and then decide. Otherwise, reversing the original array would modify it, and if the check fails, we can't revert it. But in the Python code, the original array isn't modified because the reversed part is in a new list.\n\nWait, no. In the Python code, the variable A is reassigned to the new list. The original input array is modified. Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal A is a list. Then, after the reversal, A is replaced by the concatenated parts. So in the Python code, the original list is not modified; instead, a new list is created and assigned to A. So in C, we need to create a copy of the array, reverse the subarray in that copy, then check if the copy is sorted. Because if we modify the original array, and then the check fails, the original array is altered. But in Python, the code creates a new array and checks that.\n\nSo in C, the approach would be:\n\n- Create a copy of the original array.\n\n- Reverse the subarray in the copy.\n\n- Check if the copy is sorted.\n\nBut how to create a copy in C? We can make a new array, say B, and copy the elements from A, then reverse the subarray in B.\n\nBut in C, for dynamic arrays, this could be done with memcpy. But if the array is large, we need to manage memory. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read the array into A.\n\n3. Find mn and mx.\n\n4. If mx is -1, output 0 0.\n\n5. Else:\n\n   a. Create a copy of A into B.\n\n   b. Reverse the subarray in B from mn to mx.\n\n   c. Check if B is sorted.\n\n   d. If sorted, output mn+1 and mx+1.\n\n   e. Else, output 0 0.\n\nBut in the Python code, after reversing, it checks whether the reversed array is sorted. So in C, we have to create a copy of the original array, reverse the part in the copy, then check if the copy is sorted.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint A[100000], B[100000];\n\nThen, copy A to B, then reverse B's subarray.\n\nBut how to reverse? Let's think.\n\nReversing from mn to mx in B:\n\nstart = mn;\n\nend = mx;\n\nwhile start < end:\n\n   swap B[start] and B[end]\n\n   start++\n\n   end--\n\nYes.\n\nThen, check if the entire B is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSo code:\n\n// copy A to B\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) B[i] = A[i];\n\n// reverse from mn to mx\n\nint start = mn;\n\nint end = mx;\n\nwhile (start < end) {\n\n    int temp = B[start];\n\n    B[start] = B[end];\n\n    B[end] = temp;\n\n    start++;\n\n    end--;\n\n}\n\n// check if sorted\n\nint is_sorted = 1;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < N-1; i++) {\n\n    if (B[i] > B[i+1]) {\n\n        is_sorted = 0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (is_sorted) {\n\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1);\n\n} else {\n\n    printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n}\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the input. How to read the array? Using scanf in a loop.\n\nPotential code outline:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    int A[100000], B[100000];\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    int mn = N;  // initial mn is higher than possible indices (0-based)\n\n    int mx = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (A[i] != (i+1)) {  // because in the problem, 1-based positions are compared to elements\n\n            if (i < mn) {\n\n                mn = i;\n\n            }\n\n            if (i > mx) {\n\n                mx = i;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (mx == -1) {\n\n        printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        // create B as a copy of A\n\n        for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n            B[i] = A[i];\n\n        }\n\n        // reverse B from mn to mx\n\n        int start = mn;\n\n        int end = mx;\n\n        while (start < end) {\n\n            int temp = B[start];\n\n            B[start] = B[end];\n\n            B[end] = temp;\n\n            start++;\n\n            end--;\n\n        }\n\n        // check if B is sorted\n\n        int is_sorted = 1;\n\n        for (int i=0; i < N-1; i++) {\n\n            if (B[i] > B[i+1]) {\n\n                is_sorted = 0;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (is_sorted) {\n\n            printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1);\n\n        } else {\n\n            printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the check is whether the reversed array is sorted. So yes, this code should replicate that.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- The entire array is already sorted. Then mx is -1, and 0 0 is printed.\n\n- Reversing a subarray that makes the array sorted. For example, if the array is 3 2 1, reversing the entire array would give 1 2 3, which is sorted.\n\nAnother edge case: the array is such that reversing a subarray that includes all the out-of-order elements, but the reversed subarray may still leave other parts unsorted. For example, 1 3 2 4: reversing 3 and 2 gives 1 2 3 4, which is sorted.\n\nBut if the array is 3 2 1 4: reversing first three elements gives 1 2 3 4. So code would find mn=0, mx=2, reverse, check sorted, output 1 and 3.\n\nAnother case: array is 1 4 3 2 5. The code would find elements 4 (index 1) and 2 (index 3). Reverse from 1 to 3: 4,3,2 becomes 2,3,4. The array becomes 1 2 3 4 5. Sorted, so output 2 4 (since mn+1 is 2, mx+1 is 4).\n\nBut in code:\n\nmn is the minimum index where A[i] != i+1. mx is the maximum such index. So in the example above, the out-of-order indices are 1, 2, 3. So mn=1, mx=3. Reverse that part. Then check if the entire array is sorted.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if the array is something like 2 1 3. Then mn is 0, mx is 1. Reversing gives 1 2 3. Which is sorted. So code would output 1 2.\n\nBut in the original code, during the reversal, the subarray from mn to mx is reversed. So the code correctly captures that.\n\nTesting the code with some examples:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n3 2 1\n\nProcessing:\n\nCheck each element:\n\nAt i=0 (0-based), A[0]=3. Expected 1. So mn=0, mx=0.\n\ni=1: A[1] is 2. Expected 2. So not included. Wait no, in the problem code, the condition is (i+1 != A[i]). So for i=0, A[i] is 3. i+1 is 1. So 3 !=1, so yes. So mn and mx are 0 and 0. Then when i=1, A[i] is 2, i+1 is 2. So equals, no action. i=2: A[i] is 1, i+1 is 3. 1 !=3, so mn becomes min(0, 2) =0, mx becomes max(0,2)=2.\n\nSo mn=0, mx=2. Then reverse that subarray in B. The original array is [3,2,1]. Reversed from 0 to2: [1,2,3]. Check if sorted. Yes. So output 1 and 3.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4\n\n1 3 2 4\n\nProcessing:\n\nCheck i=0: 1 ==1. No.\n\ni=1:3 !=2. So mn=1, mx=1.\n\ni=2:2 !=3. So mn=1, mx=2.\n\ni=3:4==4. No.\n\nSo mn=1, mx=2. Reverse subarray from 1 to 2: [1,2,3,4]. Sorted. Output 2 3.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nProcessing:\n\nAll elements are correct. mx remains -1. Output 0 0.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n5\n\n1 6 5 4 3 2 7 (Wait, N=6 here. Let's think of another example.)\n\nWait, perhaps an example where reversing a subarray doesn't make the array sorted.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n5\n\n3 2 1 4 5\n\nOriginal array: 3,2,1,4,5. The out-of-order elements are indices 0,1,2. mn=0, mx=2. Reverse them to get 1,2,3,4,5. Sorted. So output 1 and3 (1-based). Correct.\n\nAnother example where after reversing, it's not sorted.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n5\n\n3 1 2 4 5\n\nProcessing:\n\nCheck each element:\n\ni=0: 3 !=1. mn=0, mx=0.\n\ni=1:1 !=2. mn=0, mx=1.\n\ni=2:2 !=3. mn=0, mx=2.\n\ni=3:4==4. No.\n\ni=4:5==5. No.\n\nReverse indices 0-2: [2,1,3,4,5]. Then check if sorted. The array is 2,1,3,4,5. The first two elements are 2>1, so not sorted. So output 0 0.\n\nThus, code would detect that.\n\nSo the C code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues in code:\n\n- What if N is 0? Probably, N is at least 1 as per the problem constraints.\n\n- Array size: Using 100000 as static array size. But in some programming competition problems, N can be up to 1e5. So declaring A and B as 1e5 elements each should be okay.\n\nSo, the code should work."
