So:\n\nint equal = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] != t[i]) {\n\n        equal = 0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n} if (equal) {\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", n);\n\n} else {\n\n    // compute cnt\n\n}\n\nSo that's the first part.

But the code doesn't break the loop once a cnt is found. So even after finding the maximum possible cnt, the code continues to check other i's and possibly overwrites cnt with a smaller value. For example, if s is 'ab' and t is 'aa', then for i=0, the code checks if 'ab' matches 'aa' \u2192 no. Then i=1: check if 'b' matches 'a' \u2192 no. Then i=2 (but n=2, so i ranges up to 1). So no match. cnt remains 0. So output is 4-0=4. Which is correct. Another example: suppose s is 'aab', t is 'aba'. n=3. Check i=0: compare 'aab' vs 'aba' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: compare 'ab' vs 'ab' (the first two characters of t). So j runs from 0 to 1. s[1+0] = 'a', t[0] = 'a'; s[2] = 'b', t[1] = 'b'. j reaches 1 (n-i-1=3-1-1=1). So cnt is set to 3-1=2. Then i=2: check substring s[2] (length 1) vs t[0]. s[2] is 'b', t[0] is 'a' \u2192 no. So cnt remains 2. So the code would output 2*3 -2=4, which is correct. But suppose there's another i where a longer overlap exists. Wait, but the code would have found it in the first i. For example, if i=0 has a match, but in the code, the code would set cnt to n -0 =n. Then, for i=1, even if there is a longer match (but it's not possible), the code would overwrite cnt.

Wait, but in the original code, when a match is found for i=0, which is the entire string s, and t is the same, then the code would have already checked if s == t and printed n. So the else clause only runs when s and t are different. So in that case, the code's loop may still have a bug. But the user wants to translate the code as is. So we need to replicate the Python code's logic, even if it's incorrect. But let's see: in the original code, after checking if s and t are equal, which would cover the case of maximum overlap (n), the else clause checks for the maximum possible overlap by starting at i=0 and checking each possible i.",

So the code's else clause is only entered when s and t are not equal. So the code's first check is s == t. So in the else clause, s and t are different. So the maximum possible overlap is less than n. So for example, in the case where s is 'abcx' and t is 'abcY', then the code would check for overlapping of 3, but if the first three characters are 'abc' in both, then the code would set cnt=3. But since in the else clause, s and t are not equal, the entire s and t are different, so the code's i=0 check (which is comparing s to t) would have failed. So in the else clause, the code's i starts at 0, but the substring is of length n, which is not possible since s and t are different. So in the else clause, the code's loop for i=0 will have j run from 0 to n-0-1 =n-1. But since s and t are different, there exists at least one j where s[j] ! = t[j]. So i=0's loop will break, and cnt remains 0. So the code proceeds to check i=1, etc. But in this scenario, the code's logic is to find the maximum possible overlap, but the code does not break the loop once a match is found. So if there are multiple possible overlaps, the code will set cnt to the last one (smallest possible), which is wrong. But according to the code's current logic, the code is wrong. So translating it into C as is would result in the same error. But perhaps the user expects that the code works correctly. So perhaps the code is correct, but there's a misunderstanding. Wait, let's re-examine the original Python code. The code is:\n\nif s == t:\n    print(n)\nelse:\n    cnt = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n - i): if s[i + j] ! = t[j]:\n                break\n            if j == n - i - 1:\n                cnt = n - i\n    print(2 * n - cnt) So in the else clause, the code iterates over i from 0 to n-1.",

In C, the loop is for (j=0; j < (n-i); j++). So j runs from 0 to (n-i-1). After the loop, j is equal to (n-i). But only if all iterations were completed (no break). So in C, if j == (n-i), then the loop completed all iterations, and all characters matched. Thus, the code in C should check if j == (n-i) to determine if all characters matched. Then set cnt = n -i. But in the original code, the check is if j == n-i-1. Because j is in range(n-i), which ends at j = n-i-1. But in Python, the loop runs j from 0 to n-i-1. The condition is j == n-i-1 (the last iteration). So in Python, when j reaches n-i-1 and the characters are equal, then cnt is set. In the C code, after the loop, j is n-i if all iterations are completed. So the condition is j == (n-i), which is equivalent to Python's j == n-i-1. So the C code's condition is correct. But the original Python code does not break the loop after setting cnt. So in C, the code should also not break.",

But perhaps the original code is correct. Let's take some examples. Example 1:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'abc'\n\nt = 'abc'\n\nThen s and t are equal. Output is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'abx'\n\nt = 'xab'\n\nThe code enters else. Check i=0:\n\nn-i =3. j ranges from 0 to 2. Check s[0] == t[0] \u2192 'a' vs 'x' \u2192 no. break. i=1:\n\nn-i=2. j from 0 to 1.\n\ns[1] = 'b' vs t[0] = 'x' \u2192 no. break. i=2:\n\nn-i=1. j=0: s[2] = 'x' vs t[0] = 'x' \u2192 yes. j reaches 0 (n-i-1=0). So cnt=3-2=1. So output is 2*3-1=5. But the maximum possible overlap is 1 (the 'x' at the end of s and start of t). So the code gives correct output. Another example where multiple overlaps are possible. n=5.\n\ns = 'aabba'\n\nt = 'bbaaa'\n\nAssume:\n\ni=0: check s[0..4] 'aabba' vs t[0..4] 'bbaaa' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: s[1..4] 'abba' vs t[0..3] 'bbaa' \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: s[2..4] 'bba' vs t[0..2] 'bba' \u2192 match. cnt=5-2=3. i=3: s[3..4] 'ba' vs t[0..1] 'bb' \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: s[4] 'a' vs t[0] 'b' \u2192 no. So the code sets cnt=3. output is 2*5-3=7. But suppose there's another i=2 and i=3 where the code could find overlaps. But according to the code, only the first match (i=2) is considered, and the code continues checking higher i's. So in the code, the cnt would be set to 3, but then i=3 and i=4 are checked. But in this example, i=2 is the only match. So code works. But if there's a case where i=0 has no match, i=1 has a match (cnt=4), and then i=2 also has a match (cnt=3). Then the code will set cnt=3, which is smaller than 4. But according to the code's logic, the code would overwrite cnt to 3, which is incorrect. So the code's logic is flawed.",

So any newlines in the input are ignored, and only the next n non-newline characters are taken for s and t. So this should work. Testing the code: For input:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\nabd\n\ns is ['a','b','c'], t is ['a','b','d']. The code will check i from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0: j loops from 0 to 2 (n-i=3). Check s[0] == t[0] (a==a), yes. s[1] == t[1] (b==b), yes. s[2] == t[2] (c vs d) \u2192 no. break. i=1: n-i=2. j loops 0 and 1. s[1+0] =b vs t[0] =a \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: n-i=1. j=0: s[2] =c vs t[0] =a \u2192 no. So cnt remains 0. Output is 2*3 -0=6. But what's the correct answer? The maximum overlap is 0. So merged length is 6. Another example:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'aba'\n\nt = 'aba' But since s == t, the code outputs 3. Another example:\n\nn=4\n\ns = 'abba'\n\nt = 'bbac'. i=0: compare 'abba' vs 'bbac' \u2192 j=0: a vs b \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: compare 'bba' vs 'bbac's first 3 chars (bba \u2192 j=0: b vs b, j=1: b vs a \u2192 no. So break. i=1: j=1: s[1+1] =b vs t[1] =b. j=0: s[1] =b vs t[0] =b. j=1: s[2] =b vs t[1] =a \u2192 no. break. i=2: compare 'ba' vs 'bb's first 2. j=0: s[2] =b vs t[0] =b. j=1: s[3] =a vs t[1] =a. So j=1 ==n-i-1=4-2-1=1. So cnt=4-2=2. i=3: compare 'a' vs 'b' \u2192 no. So cnt=2. Output is 8-2=6. The maximum overlap is 2. So the merged string is abba + ac \u2192 length 4 + 4 -2=6. Which is correct. So the code's logic works in this case.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me understand what the Python code does first.\n\nSo the problem is, given two strings s and t of length n, we need to find the minimum possible length after merging them. The way they merge is by overlapping the maximum possible suffix of s and prefix of t. For example, if s ends with \"ab\" and t starts with \"ab\", they can overlap those parts. The result is the total length, which is 2n - overlap. \n\nThe Python code checks if s and t are already the same. If so, the answer is n. Otherwise, it checks for the maximum possible overlap. It starts from the largest possible overlap (n-1 characters) and decreases until it finds a valid one. Once found, the minimum length is 2n - cnt, where cnt is the overlap length.\n\nSo how to translate this into C? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, in C, I need to read n, then read the two strings s and t. But wait, in Python, the input is read as a list, which allows easy access to each character. In C, we'll use character arrays. So I need to declare s and t as arrays of size n+1 (since strings in C are null-terminated). Wait, but the input strings are exactly length n each. So when reading, we can use %s format but need to make sure they read exactly n characters. Hmm, maybe using fgets or something. But the original code uses list(input()), which for input like \"abc\" becomes ['a','b','c'], and then compares the lists. So in C, comparing the two arrays up to n characters. But the code also checks s == t, which in Python compares all elements. So in C, if the two character arrays are the same, then we output n.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read integer n. So scanf(\"%d\", &n), but we need to make sure to read the newline afterwards. Or maybe not, since the next inputs are strings. But if the user inputs n and then the two strings on separate lines, then after reading n, we need to consume the newline. Otherwise, the first string might read an empty line. Hmm, possible. So maybe read n, then read the two strings, each of length n. But how to read them correctly.\n\nIn C, using scanf(\"%d\", &n) to read the integer. Then, for the strings, perhaps read them with scanf(\"%s\", s) but ensure that the input doesn't have any whitespace. Or maybe use a loop to read each character. Wait, but the original code uses list(input()), which would split each character into a list. So in the Python code, s and t are lists of individual characters. So perhaps in C, the input strings are read as sequences of n characters, possibly including newlines? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is two strings, each of length n. So in C, the code should read these two strings. So the user inputs n, then a string (say, s), then another string (t). So in C, after reading n, read s and t. But how to read exactly n characters each? Because in C, using scanf with %s would read until whitespace, but if the input strings are on separate lines, then maybe they are read with newlines in between. Alternatively, perhaps using getchar() to read each character for s and t.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the input for s and t are each exactly n characters, possibly followed by a newline. So in C, after reading n, we need to read the next two lines, each containing exactly n characters, and then process them.\n\nSo for example, the input might be:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\nabd\n\nThen s is ['a','b','c'], t is ['a','b','d'].\n\nSo in C, the code should read the two lines, each of exactly n characters. So perhaps using fgets. But fgets includes the newline character if there's space. So for example, if we declare s as a char array of size n+2, then fgets(s, n+2, stdin) would read up to n+1 characters. Wait, the fgets function reads at most one less than the size specified, to leave room for the null terminator. So for example, if we have s of size 100, fgets(s, 100, stdin) reads up to 99 characters, plus the null. So to read exactly n characters, perhaps we can do:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < n; i++) s[i] = getchar();\n\nBut then we need to skip any remaining characters (like newlines) after that. Alternatively, perhaps read the entire line and take the first n characters. But this might complicate things if the user inputs more than n characters for s or t.\n\nAssuming that the inputs are correctly given as exactly n characters each, then perhaps the code can read them using a loop. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nSo first, read n. Then, read s and t as arrays of n characters each, ignoring any newlines or other characters.\n\nAlternatively, read a line for s and a line for t. But in C, if the user enters a string followed by a newline, then the newline will be in the input buffer, so for example, if they type \"abc\\n\" for s when n=3, then the newline is after the 'c'. So when reading via getchar(), after 'c' comes '\\n' which is part of the input buffer. So perhaps the code should read exactly n characters for each s and t, skipping any leading whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWait, but in the original code, s and t are read via input(). So in Python, input() reads a line, including up to the newline, but the newline is stripped. So for example, if the user enters \"abc\", then input() returns \"abc\", and list(input()) becomes ['a','b','c'].\n\nSo in C, after reading the integer n, the next two lines are read as s and t. Each line is exactly n characters. So to read s, the code can read n characters, then read until the newline. Similarly for t.\n\nBut how to handle that. For example, perhaps:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Read s: read a line, then take the first n characters. Or read n characters, then skip any remaining characters until the newline.\n\nBut handling input in C can be tricky. Let's think of using fgets for each string.\n\nBut in this case, the user inputs a string of n characters followed by a newline. So fgets will read that line, including the newline. So for example, if n=3, and the user enters \"abc\\n\", then fgets(s, 5, stdin) will read 'a','b','c','\\n', '\\0'. But we need to take only the first 3 characters. So perhaps, after reading via fgets, we can process the array to take the first n characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each character using getchar(), but skip any leading whitespace (like newlines from previous inputs). Let's see.\n\nAfter reading the integer n, the next input is the string s, which is a line of exactly n characters. Then comes t, another line of exactly n characters. So the code can read s and t as follows:\n\nRead the integer n. Then, read the next two lines, each containing exactly n characters.\n\nBut in C, when you read an integer with scanf, the newline after the integer is left in the input buffer. So when you read the next line, it may first read that newline. To avoid that, we need to consume any remaining characters after the integer. For example:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\nThen, read and discard all characters until a newline is encountered. Or use a loop to consume the newline.\n\nAlternatively, use a format string that skips whitespace. For example:\n\nscanf(\"%d\\n\", &n);\n\nBut that's not reliable. Alternatively, after reading n, read a single character until it's a newline. But this can be error-prone if there are multiple newlines.\n\nAn alternative approach is to read the entire line for n, then parse it. But for simplicity, perhaps the code can read the integer n, then read the next two lines, each of which is exactly n characters, and ignore any leading whitespace.\n\nBut how to read exactly n characters for s and t. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nIn C code:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n// Now, read s and t. They are each exactly n characters. So perhaps:\n\nchar s[n+1];\nchar t[n+1];\n\n// To read s:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n    char c = getchar();\n    if (c == '\\n' || c == ' ' || c == '\\t') continue; // skip whitespace\n    s[i++] = c;\n}\ns[n] = '\\0'; // Null-terminate, though in the code we might not need it as we know the length is n.\n\nSame for t.\n\nWait, but the original code doesn't check for any whitespace between characters. For example, if the input for s is \"a b c\" (with spaces), then in Python, input().split() would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'], but in the code, the input is read as list(input()), so each character is taken as is, including spaces. So in C, we need to read exactly n characters, including any possible whitespace except newlines? Or read the entire line, including all characters (including spaces and tabs), but take exactly n characters.\n\nThe original Python code reads the entire line (via input()) and converts it into a list of characters. So for example, if the user enters \"ab c\" (with a space) as a string, then s becomes ['a','b',' ','c'] (if n is 4). So in C, the code must read exactly n characters, including spaces, but not including the newline.\n\nTherefore, in C, the code should read exactly n characters for each s and t, from the input, ignoring any newlines or other whitespace that may be in between. Wait, no. The input for s is a line of exactly n characters. So if the line has more than n characters, the code will take the first n. But the problem statement says that s and t are each of length n. So perhaps the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nBut regardless, the code must read exactly n characters for each string, possibly after skipping any leading whitespace (like leading newlines from previous inputs).\n\nSo after reading n, there's a newline. Then comes s's line, then another newline, then t's line.\n\nSo the code must first read the newline after n, then read the next n characters for s, then the newline, then the next n characters for t.\n\nBut in practice, the newlines after n and after s may be consumed as part of the input for s and t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can read each character, ignoring any newlines until it has read n characters for s and t.\n\nHmm. Let's see. For example, after reading n=3, the input is:\n\nabc\n\ndef\n\nSo the input buffer after n is the newline. Then, when reading s, the code needs to read the next three characters, which are '\\n', 'a', 'b'? No, that would be wrong. So perhaps, after reading n, the code should read and discard all characters until a newline is encountered, then read the next n characters for s, then read and discard until another newline, then read n characters for t.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead and discard all characters until '\\n' (to skip the rest of the line after n).\n\nThen read exactly n characters for s, then read and discard until '\\n'.\n\nThen read exactly n characters for t.\n\nThis way, even if the user entered n followed by a space and a newline, the code would skip all that until the newline.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n// Skip to end of line after n.\n\nint c;\n\nwhile ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) { }\n\n// Now read s.\n\nchar s[n+1];\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n\n    c = getchar();\n\n    if (c == EOF) break; // handle error?\n\n    if (c == '\\n') continue; // skip newlines when reading s.\n\n    s[i++] = c;\n\n}\n\ns[n] = '\\0';\n\n// Skip to end of line after s.\n\nwhile ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) { }\n\n// Read t.\n\nchar t[n+1];\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n\n    c = getchar();\n\n    if (c == EOF) break;\n\n    if (c == '\\n') continue;\n\n    t[i++] = c;\n\n}\n\nt[n] = '\\0';\n\nThis way, s and t are exactly n characters each, read from the input lines, ignoring any newlines within the reading loops.\n\nNow, after reading s and t, the code checks if they are equal. In Python, this is a list comparison. In C, we can loop through each character and check if all are equal.\n\nSo:\n\nint equal = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] != t[i]) {\n\n        equal = 0;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (equal) {\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", n);\n\n} else {\n\n    // compute cnt\n\n}\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nNow, the else part. The code needs to find the maximum possible overlap between the suffix of s and prefix of t. The code in Python loops i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, checks if s[i..n-1] equals t[0..n-i-1]. So for each possible starting index i in s, check if the substring starting at i of length (n - i) matches the prefix of t of the same length.\n\nIf any such i exists, the maximum possible cnt is (n - i). The code then outputs 2n - cnt.\n\nIn the code, the loops are:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n - i):\n\n        if s[i+j] != t[j]:\n\n            break\n\n        if j == n - i -1:\n\n            cnt = n -i\n\nSo the code starts checking from i=0 (the entire s) and decreases i. The first time it finds a match for the entire substring, it takes the maximum possible cnt and breaks (since i is increasing, but we start from 0, which is the largest possible cnt). Wait, no. Wait, i is the starting index in s. For i=0, the substring is s[0..n-1], which is the entire s. We compare it to the entire t (since n-i is n). But if s and t are not equal, this check will fail. Then for i=1, the substring is s[1..n-1], which is length n-1. We compare it to t[0..n-2]. If they match, then cnt is n -i = n-1. And so on. So the code is looking for the maximum possible cnt. So for each possible i (starting index in s), it checks if the substring of length (n-i) starting at i matches the prefix of t of the same length.\n\nThe code finds the maximum possible cnt. The maximum possible cnt is the maximum (n-i) where the suffix of s starting at i matches the prefix of t of length (n-i). Once found, the minimum length is 2n - cnt.\n\nSo in C, we can do the same:\n\nint cnt = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    int possible = 1;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {\n\n        if (s[i + j] != t[j]) {\n\n            possible = 0;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (possible) {\n\n        cnt = n - i;\n\n        break; // since we start from i=0 (largest possible cnt), once found, we can break.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, no. Wait, the code in Python breaks when j reaches n - i -1, which means that the entire substring has been matched. So the code in Python loops for i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, checks for j from 0 to (n-i-1). So if all characters match, then cnt is set to n -i. But in the Python code, after checking all j, if j reaches n-i-1, then set cnt = n-i and exit. However, the code doesn't break the outer loop. So in Python, the code continues to check for other i's, but since i starts from 0, which gives the largest possible cnt (n -0 =n), once a match is found, further i's will have smaller cnt. However, since the code checks from i=0 upwards, the first match (i=0) would have the largest cnt, and once found, the code would have set cnt and not check other i's. Wait, no. The code in Python does not break the outer loop. So in the code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in ...:\n\n        if ...:\n\n            break\n\n        if j == ...:\n\n            cnt = n -i\n\nSo even if a match is found for i=0, the code continues to check for i=1, 2, etc. But the cnt variable is overwritten each time a match is found. However, since the code starts with i=0 (which gives the largest possible cnt), any later i's that find a match would have smaller cnt. So the last such cnt would be the smallest possible, but we need the maximum. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the code in Python may not find the maximum possible cnt.\n\nWait, the Python code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n - i):\n\n        if s[i + j] != t[j]:\n\n            break\n\n        if j == n - i -1:\n\n            cnt = n -i\n\nSo for each i starting from 0 (i=0,1,2,...,n-1), the code checks whether the substring s[i..i + (n-i-1)] (which is s[i..n-1], length n-i) matches the first (n-i) characters of t. If so, set cnt = n-i. But since i increases from 0 to n-1, the first i where this is possible would give the largest cnt (since n-i decreases as i increases). However, the code doesn't break the outer loop. So if there are multiple i's where this is true, the code will set cnt to the last (smallest) possible value, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, this seems like a bug in the Python code. Because for example, suppose n=4. Suppose that when i=0, the substring s[0..3] (full s) does not match t[0..3]. Then i=1 is checked. Suppose that s[1..3] matches t[0..2]. Then cnt is 3. Then i=2 is checked. Suppose s[2..3] matches t[0..1]. Then cnt is 2. Then i=3: s[3] matches t[0], cnt is 1. So the code would set cnt to the last possible i that matches, which is the smallest possible cnt. But the maximum possible cnt is 3 in this case. But according to the code, it's possible that multiple i's would have matching substrings, but the code sets cnt to the last one (since the loop continues). This would result in the code choosing the smallest possible cnt, which is wrong. Because the maximum possible overlap is the largest possible cnt.\n\nSo the Python code is incorrect. Because the code checks i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, if a match is found, sets cnt to n-i. But since i starts from 0, the first possible match (i=0) gives the largest possible cnt. If that's found, then any subsequent i's would have smaller cnt. But the code doesn't break the loop once a cnt is found. So even after finding the maximum possible cnt, the code continues to check other i's and possibly overwrites cnt with a smaller value. For example, if s is 'ab' and t is 'aa', then for i=0, the code checks if 'ab' matches 'aa' \u2192 no. Then i=1: check if 'b' matches 'a' \u2192 no. Then i=2 (but n=2, so i ranges up to 1). So no match. cnt remains 0. So output is 4-0=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose s is 'aab', t is 'aba'. n=3.\n\nCheck i=0: compare 'aab' vs 'aba' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: compare 'ab' vs 'ab' (the first two characters of t). So j runs from 0 to 1. s[1+0] = 'a', t[0] = 'a'; s[2] = 'b', t[1] = 'b'. j reaches 1 (n-i-1=3-1-1=1). So cnt is set to 3-1=2.\n\nThen i=2: check substring s[2] (length 1) vs t[0]. s[2] is 'b', t[0] is 'a' \u2192 no. So cnt remains 2.\n\nSo the code would output 2*3 -2=4, which is correct. But suppose there's another i where a longer overlap exists. Wait, but the code would have found it in the first i. For example, if i=0 has a match, but in the code, the code would set cnt to n -0 =n. Then, for i=1, even if there is a longer match (but it's not possible), the code would overwrite cnt. But in reality, the code's logic is wrong.\n\nWait, the code in Python seems to be written to find the maximum possible cnt. But the way the loops are structured, it may not. For example, if s is 'abcde', t is 'cdexy', n=5. Then the maximum possible overlap is 3 (s's suffix 'cde' matches t's prefix 'cde'). So i would be 2 (s starts at index 2, length 3). But according to the code, when i=0, check s[0..4] vs t[0..4], which is abcde vs cdexy \u2192 no. Then i=1, check s[1..4] (bcde) vs t[0..3] (cdex \u2192 length 4?), no. i=2, check s[2..4] (cde) vs t[0..2] (cde) \u2192 yes. So j runs up to 2 (since n-i=5-2=3, j ranges from 0 to 2). So j reaches 2, so cnt is 5-2=3. Then i=3, check s[3..4] (de) vs t[0..1] (cd \u2192 no). i=4, check s[4] (e) vs t[0] (c \u2192 no). So cnt is 3. So the code would correctly output 2*5 -3=7. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there are multiple i's that have matches? For example, s is 'ababa', t is 'ababa', then the code would print n=5. Which is correct. But if s is 'abxaba' and t is 'abayab', maybe overlapping in multiple ways. But the code in Python would check i=0, then i=1, etc., and if a larger overlap exists earlier in the loop, then the code would set cnt to that value. However, since the code doesn't break after finding a match, if later i's also have matches, they would overwrite cnt with smaller values. For example:\n\ns = 'aaa', t = 'aaa'. Then the code would set cnt to 3 (i=0). But then i=1: check s[1..2] (aa) vs t[0..1] (aa \u2192 yes). So cnt becomes 3-1=2. Then i=2: check s[2] (a) vs t[0] (a \u2192 yes). cnt becomes 3-2=1. Then i=3 (but n=3, i ranges up to 2). So cnt is 1, but the correct answer would be 3. But since s and t are equal, the code would print n=3. So in this case, the code is correct. But if s and t are not equal, but have multiple possible overlaps, the code may choose the smallest possible.\n\nWait, this suggests that the Python code has a flaw. The code's logic is to find the earliest possible i (starting from 0) that has a match. Once a match is found, cnt is set to the maximum possible (n-i). But the code continues to check higher i's, which would give smaller n-i. So the final cnt will be the last possible i that has a match, which is the smallest possible cnt, which is not the maximum. This is a bug.\n\nSo the original Python code is incorrect. For example:\n\nSuppose n=4.\n\ns = 'aabc'\n\nt = 'abcd'\n\nThen:\n\ni=0: check s[0..3] ('aabc') vs t[0..3] ('abcd') \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: check s[1..3] ('abc') vs t[0..2] ('abc') \u2192 yes. cnt=4-1=3.\n\ni=2: check s[2..3] ('bc') vs t[0..1] ('ab') \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: check s[3] ('c') vs t[0] ('a') \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code will output 2*4 -3 =5, which is correct. The maximum overlap is 3.\n\nBut suppose another case where there are multiple overlaps.\n\ns = 'ababa', t = 'ababa', but modified.\n\nWait, let's take a case where s is 'abab' and t is 'baba', n=4.\n\nThen s is ['a','b','a','b']\n\nt is ['b','a','b','a']\n\nCheck possible overlaps:\n\ni=0: s[0..3] is 'abab', t[0..3] is 'baba' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: s[1..3] is 'bab', compare to t[0..2] 'bab' \u2192 yes. cnt=4-1=3.\n\ni=2: s[2..3] is 'ab', compare to t[0..1] 'ba' \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: s[3] is 'b' vs t[0] 'b' \u2192 yes. cnt=4-3=1.\n\nSo the code would set cnt=3 first, then overwrite it to 1. So final cnt is 1. The answer would be 2*4-1=7. But the maximum overlap is 3. So the code in Python would output 7, which is correct. Because after i=1, cnt is 3, then i=3, it's set to 1. But in this case, the code would output 2*4 -1=7, which is wrong. Because the maximum overlap is 3.\n\nSo the code in Python is incorrect. It should break the outer loop once a match is found. Because the code is trying to find the maximum possible cnt, which corresponds to the earliest i (smallest i), since i starts at 0. So once a match is found at i=0, which gives cnt=n-0 =n, which is the maximum possible. But the code continues to check other i's and may overwrite cnt with smaller values.\n\nSo the code has a bug. The correct approach is to find the largest possible cnt, which is the largest (n-i) where i is the starting index in s such that s[i..i + (n-i-1)] equals t[0..n-i-1]. So once a match is found, since we are checking i in increasing order, the first match we find (smallest i) will have the largest cnt. So the code should break and exit once a match is found.\n\nBut the original Python code does not do this. So the code is incorrect.\n\nSo, for the translation into C, this code must be adjusted to correctly find the maximum possible cnt.\n\nBut since the user has provided the Python code and wants it translated to C, perhaps the C code should replicate the same logic, including any bugs. Or perhaps the user expects that the code works correctly. But in this case, the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when a match is found for i=0, which is the entire string s, and t is the same, then the code would have already checked if s == t and printed n. So the else clause only runs when s and t are different. So in that case, the code's loop may still have a bug.\n\nBut the user wants to translate the code as is. So we need to replicate the Python code's logic, even if it's incorrect.\n\nBut let's see: in the original code, after checking if s and t are equal, which would cover the case of maximum overlap (n), the else clause checks for the maximum possible overlap by starting at i=0 and checking each possible i. However, the code does not break the loop once a match is found. So it will overwrite cnt with any later matches. For example, if i=0 is a match (but in the else clause, s and t are not equal, so i=0's check is a substring of length n, which can't be a match. Because s and t are not equal. So the code's else clause is only entered when s and t are not equal. So the code's first check is s == t. So in the else clause, s and t are different. So the maximum possible overlap is less than n. So for example, in the case where s is 'abcx' and t is 'abcY', then the code would check for overlapping of 3, but if the first three characters are 'abc' in both, then the code would set cnt=3. But since in the else clause, s and t are not equal, the entire s and t are different, so the code's i=0 check (which is comparing s to t) would have failed. So in the else clause, the code's i starts at 0, but the substring is of length n, which is not possible since s and t are different. So in the else clause, the code's loop for i=0 will have j run from 0 to n-0-1 =n-1. But since s and t are different, there exists at least one j where s[j] != t[j]. So i=0's loop will break, and cnt remains 0. So the code proceeds to check i=1, etc.\n\nBut in this scenario, the code's logic is to find the maximum possible overlap, but the code does not break the loop once a match is found. So if there are multiple possible overlaps, the code will set cnt to the last one (smallest possible), which is wrong.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, the code is wrong. So translating it into C as is would result in the same error.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects that the code works correctly. So perhaps the code is correct, but there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the original Python code.\n\nThe code is:\n\nif s == t:\n    print(n)\nelse:\n    cnt = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n - i):\n            if s[i + j] != t[j]:\n                break\n            if j == n - i - 1:\n                cnt = n - i\n    print(2 * n - cnt)\n\nSo in the else clause, the code iterates over i from 0 to n-1. For each i, it checks the substring s[i : i + (n-i)] (since j ranges up to n-i-1). So the length of the substring is (n-i). The code checks if this substring matches the first (n-i) characters of t.\n\nIf they do, then cnt is set to (n -i). But since the code doesn't break after finding a match, it will continue to check other i's, and cnt will be set to the last such i (smallest i) which gives the largest (n-i) possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose i=1 gives a match, so cnt= n-1. Then i=2 may give a match, but (n-2) is smaller, so cnt is set to (n-2). Then the final cnt is (n-2), which is not the maximum possible.\n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. It should break out of the loops once a match is found, starting from i=0 (to find the maximum possible cnt). But the code does not do this. So the code is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the maximum possible cnt by checking i from 0 upwards, and once a match is found, set cnt and break all loops.\n\nBut the original code does not do this. Therefore, the code's translation to C should replicate this logic, even if it's incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is correct. Let's take some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'abc'\n\nt = 'abc'\n\nThen s and t are equal. Output is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'abx'\n\nt = 'xab'\n\nThe code enters else.\n\nCheck i=0:\n\nn-i =3.\n\nj ranges from 0 to 2.\n\nCheck s[0] == t[0] \u2192 'a' vs 'x' \u2192 no. break.\n\ni=1:\n\nn-i=2.\n\nj from 0 to 1.\n\ns[1] = 'b' vs t[0] = 'x' \u2192 no. break.\n\ni=2:\n\nn-i=1.\n\nj=0: s[2] = 'x' vs t[0] = 'x' \u2192 yes. j reaches 0 (n-i-1=0). So cnt=3-2=1.\n\nSo output is 2*3-1=5.\n\nBut the maximum possible overlap is 1 (the 'x' at the end of s and start of t).\n\nSo the code gives correct output.\n\nAnother example where multiple overlaps are possible.\n\nn=5.\n\ns = 'aabba'\n\nt = 'bbaaa'\n\nAssume:\n\ni=0: check s[0..4] 'aabba' vs t[0..4] 'bbaaa' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: s[1..4] 'abba' vs t[0..3] 'bbaa' \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: s[2..4] 'bba' vs t[0..2] 'bba' \u2192 match. cnt=5-2=3.\n\ni=3: s[3..4] 'ba' vs t[0..1] 'bb' \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: s[4] 'a' vs t[0] 'b' \u2192 no.\n\nSo the code sets cnt=3. output is 2*5-3=7.\n\nBut suppose there's another i=2 and i=3 where the code could find overlaps.\n\nBut according to the code, only the first match (i=2) is considered, and the code continues checking higher i's. So in the code, the cnt would be set to 3, but then i=3 and i=4 are checked. But in this example, i=2 is the only match. So code works.\n\nBut if there's a case where i=0 has no match, i=1 has a match (cnt=4), and then i=2 also has a match (cnt=3). Then the code will set cnt=3, which is smaller than 4. But according to the code's logic, the code would overwrite cnt to 3, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the maximum possible cnt by checking i from 0 upwards and breaking once a match is found. But the original code does not do this.\n\nTherefore, the code in Python is incorrect, but the user wants it translated to C. So the C code should replicate the same logic.\n\nSo now, back to translating the code.\n\nThe code in C will follow the same steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead s and t.\n\nCheck if s equals t. If yes, print n.\n\nElse:\n\nInitialize cnt=0.\n\nLoop i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   loop j from 0 to (n-i-1):\n\n      if s[i+j] != t[j], break.\n\n      if j == (n-i-1), set cnt = n-i.\n\nPrint 2*n - cnt.\n\nBut in C, the code will have to use two nested loops.\n\nSo the code in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    // Read s and t.\n    // Skipping whitespace after n.\n    int c;\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n    \n    char s[n+1], t[n+1];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n        c = getchar();\n        if (c == '\\n') continue;\n        s[i++] = c;\n    }\n    s[n] = '\\0';\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\n        c = getchar();\n        if (c == '\\n') continue;\n        t[i++] = c;\n    }\n    t[n] = '\\0';\n    \n    // Check if s and t are equal.\n    int equal = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (s[i] != t[i]) {\n            equal = 0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (equal) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", n);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    \n    int cnt = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int j;\n        for (j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {\n            if (s[i + j] != t[j]) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (j == n - i) { // because the loop runs from j=0 to j <n-i. So j increments after breaking.\n            // wait, no. Let's think: for j in range(n -i) \u2192 j goes from 0 to n-i-1.\n\n            // In the Python code, the inner loop is for j in range(n -i). So j runs from 0 to (n-i-1).\n\n            // In C, the inner loop is j starts at 0, j < (n -i). So j increments up to (n-i-1).\n\n            // So after the loop, j can be either (n-i) (if the loop completed) or less.\n\n            // So if the loop completed all iterations, then j will be equal to (n-i), but the condition is j < (n-i). So when the loop exits normally, j is (n-i). Because after j = (n-i-1), j increments to (n-i) and the loop condition fails.\n\n            // So to check if all j from 0 to (n-i-1) matched, we check if j == (n-i).\n\n            // For example, if n-i is 3, j runs 0,1,2. Then j increments to 3, loop ends. So j is 3.\n\n            // So in C, if after the loop j == (n-i), then all characters matched.\n\n            if (j == n - i) {\n                cnt = n - i;\n                // But we should break here to avoid overwriting with smaller cnt.\n                // However, original code does not break, so we don't break here.\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n\", 2 * n - cnt);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in Python's code, the inner loop is for j in range(n -i), which is j from 0 to (n-i-1). In C, the loop is for (j=0; j < (n-i); j++). So j runs from 0 to (n-i-1).\n\nAfter the loop, j is equal to (n-i). But only if all iterations were completed (no break). So in C, if j == (n-i), then the loop completed all iterations, and all characters matched.\n\nThus, the code in C should check if j == (n-i) to determine if all characters matched. Then set cnt = n -i.\n\nBut in the original code, the check is if j == n-i-1. Because j is in range(n-i), which ends at j = n-i-1. But in Python, the loop runs j from 0 to n-i-1. The condition is j == n-i-1 (the last iteration). So in Python, when j reaches n-i-1 and the characters are equal, then cnt is set.\n\nIn the C code, after the loop, j is n-i if all iterations are completed. So the condition is j == (n-i), which is equivalent to Python's j == n-i-1.\n\nSo the C code's condition is correct.\n\nBut the original Python code does not break the loop after setting cnt. So in C, the code should also not break. Thus, for each i, if the inner loop completes, cnt is set to n-i. But later i's may overwrite this with smaller values.\n\nBut according to the original code's logic, this is correct. So the code in C must replicate this.\n\nBut this is wrong. The code should find the maximum possible cnt, which is the first i (smallest i) where the inner loop completes. So to replicate the code's logic, even though it's incorrect, the C code must proceed.\n\nThus, the code in C is as above.\n\nBut there's a mistake in the C code's reading of the strings. For example, if after reading n, the next character is a newline, which is skipped. Then, when reading s, the code reads n characters, skipping newlines. But what if the input is entered without newlines? Like, after n, the s is entered without a newline.\n\nFor example, input:\n\n3abcde\n\nThen n=3, s is 'abc', t is 'def'.\n\nBut the code after reading n=3, skips to the newline. If the input has no newline, the code will read characters until it has n for s and t. So the code may read from the same line.\n\nBut the problem states that s and t are each of length n. So the code must read exactly n characters for each, regardless of newlines.\n\nThe code uses getchar() and skips newlines when reading s and t. So any newlines in the input are ignored, and only the next n non-newline characters are taken for s and t.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nFor input:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\nabd\n\ns is ['a','b','c'], t is ['a','b','d'].\n\nThe code will check i from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0: j loops from 0 to 2 (n-i=3). Check s[0] == t[0] (a==a), yes. s[1] == t[1] (b==b), yes. s[2] == t[2] (c vs d) \u2192 no. break.\n\ni=1: n-i=2. j loops 0 and 1. s[1+0] =b vs t[0] =a \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: n-i=1. j=0: s[2] =c vs t[0] =a \u2192 no. So cnt remains 0.\n\nOutput is 2*3 -0=6.\n\nBut what's the correct answer? The maximum overlap is 0. So merged length is 6.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\ns = 'aba'\n\nt = 'aba'\n\nBut since s == t, the code outputs 3.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=4\n\ns = 'abba'\n\nt = 'bbac'.\n\ni=0: compare 'abba' vs 'bbac' \u2192 j=0: a vs b \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: compare 'bba' vs 'bbac's first 3 chars (bba \u2192 j=0: b vs b, j=1: b vs a \u2192 no. So break.\n\ni=1: j=1: s[1+1] =b vs t[1] =b. j=0: s[1] =b vs t[0] =b. j=1: s[2] =b vs t[1] =a \u2192 no. break.\n\ni=2: compare 'ba' vs 'bb's first 2. j=0: s[2] =b vs t[0] =b. j=1: s[3] =a vs t[1] =a. So j=1 ==n-i-1=4-2-1=1. So cnt=4-2=2.\n\ni=3: compare 'a' vs 'b' \u2192 no. So cnt=2.\n\nOutput is 8-2=6.\n\nThe maximum overlap is 2. So the merged string is abba + ac \u2192 length 4 + 4 -2=6. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's logic works in this case.\n\nThus, despite the potential bug in the original code, the translation to C should proceed as per the given Python code.\n\nSo the final C code should read n, read s and t, compare them, and compute the maximum overlap as per the Python code's logic.\n\nNow, the code in C should handle the reading correctly, and replicate the nested loops.\n\nSo the final code is as follows."
