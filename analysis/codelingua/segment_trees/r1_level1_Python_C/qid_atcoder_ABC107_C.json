But the code here would need to read up to N elements, so perhaps using dynamic allocation is better. But for simplicity, perhaps using static arrays with a maximum size. Let's proceed. But for the C code, first, read N and K. Then read the list. Then split into positive and negative arrays, and count the zeros. In C, we can do:\n\nint N, K;\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n\nint lst[N];\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &lst[i]);\n}\n\nThen, create two arrays, pos and neg.

But the original code's check function is for each j, compute p and m, where p is the j-th element (assuming j elements in the positive list, and the j-th element is the last one in the first j elements). Then m is the (k-j)th element from the end of the negative list. But in reality, taking (k-j) elements from the negative list would require going to the farthest of them (the most negative). So in that case, the code should take the first (k-j) elements (if the list is sorted in ascending order) or the last (k-j) elements (if sorted in descending order). But since the code isn't sorting, it's possible that the code is not working correctly. But regardless, the translation must proceed. So, in C, when j elements are taken from pos, the code uses pos[j-1] (if j>0). For (k-j) elements from neg, the code uses neg[m_size - (k-j)] (if k-j>0). So the C code for the check function would look like:\n\nint check(int k) {\n    int ans = 1e9; // but in C, 1e9 is 1000000000\n    for (int j=0; j<=k; j++) {\n        if (j > p_size || (k-j) > m_size) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        int p, m;\n        if (j ==0) {\n            p =0;\n        } else {\n            p = pos[j-1];\n        } if (k-j ==0) {\n            m =0;\n        } else {\n            m = neg[m_size - (k-j)];\n        }\n        int option1 = 2*p + abs(m);\n        int option2 = p + 2*abs(m);\n        int current_min = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n        if (current_min < ans) {\n            ans = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nBut in C, since arrays are zero-based, and the code in Python uses pos[j-1] for j>0, which is the j-th element (since j is the count of elements taken). So if j=1, then j-1=0, which is the first element in the pos array. So that's correct. But for the negative array, in Python, the code accesses lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]. For example, if lst_m has 5 elements (indices 0-4), and (k-j)=3, then the index is 4-3=1. So in C, the code would be neg[m_size -1 - (k-j) +1? Wait, no. The code for Python is:\n\nlasty = len(lst_m) -1 m = lst_m[lasty - (k-j)] So in C, for m_size elements, the code is:\n\nindex = (m_size -1) - (k-j) So in C, m = neg[ (m_size-1) - (k-j) ]\n\nBut in C, if (k-j) is greater than m_size, then (m_size - (k-j)) could be negative, leading to invalid array access. But in the check function's loop, we have an if condition:\n\nif (j > lastx || (k-j) > lasty) In the Python code, lastx is len(lst_p) (p_size in C), so j must be <= lastx. Similarly, (k-j) must be <= lasty (m_size). So in C, the code's for loop j runs from 0 to k. Then, for each j, it checks if j > p_size (lastx is len(lst_p), which is p_size). So in C:\n\nif (j > p_size || (k-j) > m_size) { continue; } So (k-j) can't be larger than m_size. So in C, when (k-j) is <= m_size, then (m_size-1) - (k-j) +1 ? Wait, wait. Let's take an example. Suppose m_size is 5, and (k-j) is 3. Then (m_size-1) is 4. 4 -3 +1 = 2. So index 2. But how does that make sense? Wait, no. For m_size=5, (k-j)=3. So (m_size -1) - (k-j) =4-3=1. So the index is 1. So the code accesses neg[1]. But why?",

So in the original code, K can be negative, but the check function is called with that value. So in the code, when K is negative, the check function's loop runs from 0 to K, which is not possible. So the code returns 1e9, but if K was reduced to negative, that means we have enough zeros to cover the required K, and the answer should be zero. So the code has a mistake here.",

For example, sample input where the pos and neg arrays are not sorted. Another issue is that in C, the neg array is stored as the input order. When (k-j) is 2 and m_size is 3, the code takes the element at index (3-1) -2 = 0. So the first element of the neg array. So, for example, if the input for negatives is -3, -1, -5 (so m_size=3, neg[0]=-3, neg[1]=-1, neg[2]=-5), and (k-j) is 2. Then (3-1) -2 =0. So m=neg[0] =-3. But the two farthest elements are -3 and -5. But the code uses m=-3. So the code is incorrect. But since the original code is like this, the C code must replicate this behavior.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does. \n\nThe problem seems to be about finding the minimum time required to collect K items, which are either positive, negative, or zero. The positive ones are in one list, negatives in another. The approach is to check different combinations of taking j positive numbers and (k-j) negative numbers, calculating the minimal distance for each combination.\n\nFirst, in C, I need to handle input. The original code reads N and K, then a list of numbers. The Python code splits the list into positive, negative, and counts zeros (which reduce K). So in C, I'll need to read the inputs similarly. \n\nIn Python, the lists lst_p and lst_m are built by appending elements. In C, I'll have to use arrays and track their sizes. So I'll need variables like p_size and m_size to keep track of how many elements are in each array. \n\nThe check function is a bit tricky. It iterates j from 0 to k, checking if j and (k-j) are within the bounds of the positive and negative arrays. For each valid j, it calculates two possible distances: 2*p + |m| or p + 2*|m|, taking the minimum. Then, the overall minimum is tracked.\n\nTranslating the check function: In C, I'll need to sort the positive array in ascending order and the negative array in ascending order (since in the Python code, for the negative array, they access elements from the end using [lasty - (k-j)], which implies the array is sorted in ascending order, so the most negative is first, and when taking (k-j) elements, we take the first (k-j) elements from the sorted list). Wait, in Python, lst_m is built by appending negative numbers. Then, when they take m as lst_m[lasty - (k-j)], which is equivalent to accessing elements starting from the end. For example, if the negative list is [-5, -3, -2], then lasty is 2 (indexes 0-2). For k-j=1, it would be index 2-1+0? Wait, maybe not. Wait, let's see: in Python, when you have lst_m, which contains negative numbers. Then, when accessing m, in the code:\n\nm = lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]\n\nWait, lasty is len(lst_m) - 1. So for example, if len(lst_m) is 3, lasty is 2. So if k-j is 1, then lasty - (k-j) is 2-1=1. So the index is 1. So the code is taking elements from the end of lst_m. But in Python, the list_m is built by appending negative numbers, so if the input was, say, -3, -5, -2, then lst_m would be [-3, -5, -2], and accessing index 1 gives -5. But that's not the largest in magnitude. Wait, maybe the original code intended to sort the negative array in ascending order (i.e., most negative first) and then take the elements from the end (which would be closer to zero). Or perhaps the original code is incorrect, but perhaps I should replicate it as is.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the negative numbers are stored in lst_m as they are read. Then, when accessing m, it's taking the (k-j)th element from the end. For example, if there are 3 elements in lst_m, and (k-j) is 2, then the index is len(lst_m) - 1 - (k-j - 1) ? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: if len(lst_m) is 3 (indices 0,1,2), and (k-j) is 2, then lasty - (k-j) is 2 -2=0. So index 0. That would take the first two elements (indices 0 and 1?), but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no. For (k-j) elements, the code takes lst_m[lasty - (k-j) +1 ... lasty] ?\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example: lst_m has elements [ -5, -3, -2 ]. So len(lst_m) is 3. lasty is 2. Suppose k-j is 2. Then the code uses index 2 - (2) =0. So m is lst_m[0], which is -5. But then the distance would be 2*p + abs(m) (so 2* p +5). But that's taking the furthest negative point. But maybe the Python code is supposed to take the closest negatives first. Wait, perhaps the Python code has a mistake here. Wait, the original code's logic for the negative numbers might be wrong. Because if you take the first (k-j) elements in the negative list, sorted in ascending order (i.e., from most negative to least), then taking the first (k-j) elements would be the furthest away. But maybe in the code, the negative list is sorted in ascending order, and then when you take elements from the end (i.e., the closest to zero), that's better. But in the code, for m, it's accessing lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]. Hmm. Let's see: suppose lst_m is sorted in ascending order, which is not the case in the original Python code. Wait, the original code does not sort the list. So perhaps the Python code is incorrect. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the positions are given in arbitrary order, and the code is supposed to choose the optimal ones. So the Python code is perhaps missing a sort step for the positive and negative lists.\n\nWait, looking back at the Python code:\n\nThe code splits the list into positive and negative. Then, in the check function, when j positive elements are taken, it uses the first j elements (lst_p[j-1], assuming j elements). Similarly, for the negative elements, when (k-j) elements are taken, it takes from the end of the lst_m. So for example, if there are 5 negative elements, and (k-j) is 3, then the code takes the elements at indices lasty -3 +1? No, wait, the code uses m = lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]. Wait, if lasty is len(lst_m) -1, then for (k-j) elements, the code is taking the element at index (lasty - (k-j)), which would be the element at position (len(lst_m) -1 - (k-j)). But that's just one element. Wait, this doesn't make sense. Oh wait, the code is trying to take the farthest elements. For example, suppose we need to take (k-j) negative elements. The code takes the one that is farthest (the one with the largest absolute value). Because in the original code, the negative elements are stored as they are (so, for example, if the input is -1, -3, then the list is [-1, -3], and when k-j is 1, the code takes index lasty -1 = 1-1=0, which is -1. But that's not correct. Because the farthest would be -3. So perhaps the Python code has a mistake here, and the lists should be sorted.\n\nAh, this suggests that the original code might not be correct. But since we need to translate it as is, perhaps the code is intended to have the positive list sorted in ascending order and the negative list sorted in descending order (so the largest in magnitude comes first). But in the original code, the lists are not sorted. That would lead to incorrect results. Wait, but in the problem statement, perhaps the code is correct, and the input lists are already sorted. But the code doesn't sort them, which would be a mistake. \n\nWait, but the problem is likely from a programming contest. In such problems, the order of the elements is arbitrary, and the code needs to process them. So perhaps the original code has a mistake here. For example, in the Python code, the code for m is taking a single element, but (k-j) elements are supposed to be taken. Wait, this is confusing. The code for the check function loops j from 0 to k. For each j, if j is <= the number of positive elements and (k-j) is <= the number of negative elements, then compute p and m. But p and m are individual elements. Wait, this can't be right. So, perhaps the original code is incorrect, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each element in the lists is a point on a number line, and you need to collect K items. The time taken is calculated as follows: for each selected group, you can choose to go to the farthest point and collect all the required items on the way. So, for example, if you have j positive points, you go to the farthest one (which is the largest p) and collect all j in the way, then return. So the time is 2*p. Similarly for negative points. But if you collect both positive and negative, you can choose to go to the positive first then the negatives, or vice versa, taking the minimum of 2*p + m (if you go to p, then to m, which is negative, but the time is p (go to p) + (p - m) (from p to m) \u2192 total p + (p -m) = 2p -m. But since m is negative, absolute value is added. Wait, maybe the code is correct in that for j positive points and (k-j) negative points, the time is the minimal of either going to the farthest positive, then to the farthest negative (but how?), but perhaps the code is considering that when you take j positive points, you take the j-th one (the farthest), and when taking (k-j) negative points, you take the farthest one (the most negative). Then the total distance could be 2*p (go to p and back) plus the absolute value of m (if you go to m after p). But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the code is considering that you can collect j positive points by going to the farthest, which takes p time (since you collect them on the way), and then collect (k-j) negatives by going to m, which is the farthest (most negative), which takes |m| time, but since you start at zero, the total time could be p + |m|. But you have to return to zero? Or not. The problem might require that you end at the origin, but perhaps not. \n\nWait, the problem's actual logic might be that each item is a point on a line, and the person starts at 0. To collect items, you move to a point, and collect all items along the way. For example, moving to the right (positive direction) to collect the farthest positive item, collecting all j items on the way. Then, the time taken to go there and come back is 2*p (since you have to return to zero). Or if you then go to the left, you might not need to come back. So the code is considering two scenarios for each combination of j and (k-j): either collect the positive ones first, then the negatives (time 2*p + abs(m)), or collect the negatives first, then the positives (time abs(m)*2 + p). The minimal of these two options is taken for each j.\n\nBut in this case, the code needs to have the positive list sorted in ascending order (so the j-th element is the farthest), and the negative list sorted in descending order (so the (k-j)th element is the farthest). Because, for example, if you have positive points [1,3,5], then j=3 would mean you take all three, and the farthest is 5, so p is 5. Similarly, for negative points [-5,-3,-1], (k-j)=2 would mean you take the two farthest (i.e., -5 and -3), so m is -5. Wait, but in the code, when j is 3, then j-1 is 2 (since the list is 0-based), and the positive list is in the order they were read. So if the code doesn't sort the positive and negative lists, then the code would be incorrect. Because the farthest elements might not be in the correct position.\n\nAh, so this is a problem. The original Python code does not sort the lists. So if the input is not sorted, the code would give incorrect results. For example, if the positive list is [5,3,1], then j=3 would take 1 (the third element), which is not the farthest. So the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code must have a mistake here. But since the user is asking to translate the code as is, perhaps the intended solution is to have the lists sorted. Therefore, the Python code is missing the sorting step. But according to the code provided, the lists are not sorted. So the translation to C should replicate this, but in that case, the code is incorrect. But perhaps the original code is correct, but the way the lists are processed is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because the problem's input lists are already sorted. But that's unlikely. So the original code is incorrect. But since the user wants a translation, we need to replicate the code's behavior, including any errors. Therefore, in the C code, we do not sort the positive or negative lists. \n\nSo, in the C code, the positive and negative arrays are built in the order of input. Then, in the check function, when j elements are taken from the positives, the code uses the j-th element (lst_p[j-1], assuming that the list is in the order of the input. Similarly, for the negatives, it takes the element at index lasty - (k-j). Which, if the list is not sorted, would be arbitrary. \n\nThis suggests that the original code may not work correctly. But as a translator, I need to replicate the code's logic. So the C code will mirror this structure, even if it's incorrect. \n\nSo now, moving to the C code:\n\nFirst, read N and K from stdin. Then read N integers. Then, split them into positive and negative arrays. Also, count zeros and subtract from K.\n\nIn C, dynamic arrays can be handled with malloc, but since the maximum possible N is not given, perhaps we can use fixed-size arrays. But in practice, for programming contests, fixed-size arrays are common, assuming the maximum N is up to 1e5 or similar. But the code here would need to read up to N elements, so perhaps using dynamic allocation is better. But for simplicity, perhaps using static arrays with a maximum size. Let's proceed.\n\nBut for the C code, first, read N and K. Then read the list. Then split into positive and negative arrays, and count the zeros.\n\nIn C, we can do:\n\nint N, K;\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n\nint lst[N];\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &lst[i]);\n}\n\nThen, create two arrays, pos and neg. Also track their sizes.\n\nint pos[N], neg[N];\nint p_size = 0, m_size = 0;\nint zero_count = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n    if (lst[i] == 0) {\n        zero_count++;\n        K--; // since K is reduced by 1 for each zero\n    } else if (lst[i] > 0) {\n        pos[p_size++] = lst[i];\n    } else {\n        neg[m_size++] = lst[i];\n    }\n}\n\nBut after that, K could be negative. So in the original code, K can be negative, but the check function will loop from 0 to K. So if K is negative, the check function would not loop. Then, the code would return 1e9, but in the end, the code prints check(K), which may be 1e9 if K is negative and there are not enough elements. But in the original code, if K is zero, then check(0) would return 0. \n\nBut perhaps the original code is designed to have K >=0, but the problem may have K reduced to negative. So in the C code, after processing zeros, we need to adjust K. But how? The code may have K being less than zero, but the check function will process it. So in the C code, the check function needs to handle K even when K is negative, but that would loop j from 0 to K (which is negative), so the loop does not execute, and the ans remains 1e9, which is printed. But that's probably not correct. So in the code, when K is reduced to <=0, then the answer is 0. Wait, because if you have enough zeros to cover K, then you don't need to collect any other elements. So the code may have a mistake here. Because when K is reduced to zero, the code returns the minimal ans (which, when K=0, j can be zero, and (k-j) is zero. So p=0, m=0. So ans is min(0, 0). So the code returns 0, which is correct. If K is negative, then K is 0 after max(K,0). But in the original code, K can be negative. For example, if K is 3, and there are 5 zeros. Then K becomes 3-5= -2. So the check function is called with K=-2, which loops j from 0 to -2, which doesn't execute. So ans remains 1e9, but the actual answer should be 0. So the original code has a mistake here. But again, as per the translation, we need to replicate this.\n\nNow, the check function. The Python code's check function loops j from 0 to k. For each j, if j exceeds the length of pos or (k-j) exceeds the length of neg, then skip. Otherwise, compute p and m. \n\nIn the code, p is the j-th element in the positive list (lst_p[j-1], but why j-1? Because j is the number of positive elements taken. For j=0, p is 0. For j=1, take the first element (index 0). So in the Python code, the positive list is stored in the order of input, and when j elements are taken, the code uses the j-th element (assuming j elements are the first j elements). But that would only make sense if the list is sorted in ascending order. So for example, if the positive list is [3,1,5], and j=3, then j-1 is 2, so the third element (5). But that's the farthest. But if the list is not sorted, this isn't the case. So the code's logic is to take the first j elements (the order as input) and take the j-th element as the farthest. Which is incorrect unless the list is sorted. \n\nBut again, the code is as given, so we need to mirror this. \n\nIn C, the check function would need to:\n\nLoop j from 0 to current K (but need to ensure K is not negative). For each j, check if j <= p_size and (k-j) <= m_size. If so, compute p and m. For j=0, p is 0. Else, p is pos[j-1]. For (k-j)=0, m is 0. Else, m is neg[m_size - (k-j)].\n\nWait, the original Python code has lasty as len(lst_m) -1. So for m, it uses lst_m[lasty - (k-j)] when (k-j) >0. So in C, for the neg array, which has m_size elements (indexes 0 to m_size-1), the code would use neg[m_size -1 - (k-j -1)] ? Or wait, let's see: in Python, len(lst_m) is the length. lasty is len(lst_m)-1. So for (k-j) elements, the code accesses lst_m[lasty - (k-j) + i] for i from 0 to (k-j-1)? No, the code just takes a single element. Oh, no. Wait, the code takes j positive elements and (k-j) negative elements. But in the code, for each combination, p is the j-th element (i.e., the j elements are the first j in the pos list), and m is the (k-j)th element from the end of the neg list. So, in Python, for example, if the neg list has 5 elements, and (k-j) is 3, then the code takes the element at index 5-1 -3 = 1. But that's only one element. So the code seems to consider that taking (k-j) elements from the end of the neg list, but just take the first element of them. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the original code has a mistake here, but I have to replicate it.\n\nSo, in C, for the neg array, when (k-j) elements are taken, the code uses the element at index (m_size -1) - (k-j) +1? Or wait, the code uses m = neg[m_size - (k-j)].\n\nWait, the original code for m is:\n\nm = lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]\n\nlasty is len(lst_m) -1. So for example, if len(lst_m) is 5, and (k-j) is 3, then lasty - (k-j) =4-3=1. So m is the element at index 1.\n\nSo in C, the neg array is stored as it is. So for (k-j) elements taken, the code uses the element at index (m_size-1) - (k-j) +1 ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if m_size is 5 (elements 0-4), and (k-j) is 3, then the code would take the element at index (5-1) - (3) = 4-3=1. So m is neg[1]. But that's just one element. So the code is considering that taking (k-j) elements would require taking the element at index (m_size-1) - (k-j) +1. But that's unclear. \n\nBut the code seems to take the (k-j)th element from the end of the list. For example, if the list has elements [a, b, c, d, e], then (k-j) is 3. So the code would take the element at index 5-1 -3 =1. So the element is b. But that's only one element. So the code is considering that taking (k-j) elements from the end, but it's only using one element. This suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nBut the original code's check function is for each j, compute p and m, where p is the j-th element (assuming j elements in the positive list, and the j-th element is the last one in the first j elements). Then m is the (k-j)th element from the end of the negative list. But in reality, taking (k-j) elements from the negative list would require going to the farthest of them (the most negative). So in that case, the code should take the first (k-j) elements (if the list is sorted in ascending order) or the last (k-j) elements (if sorted in descending order). But since the code isn't sorting, it's possible that the code is not working correctly. \n\nBut regardless, the translation must proceed. So, in C, when j elements are taken from pos, the code uses pos[j-1] (if j>0). For (k-j) elements from neg, the code uses neg[m_size - (k-j)] (if k-j>0). \n\nSo the C code for the check function would look like:\n\nint check(int k) {\n    int ans = 1e9; // but in C, 1e9 is 1000000000\n    for (int j=0; j<=k; j++) {\n        if (j > p_size || (k-j) > m_size) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        int p, m;\n        if (j ==0) {\n            p =0;\n        } else {\n            p = pos[j-1];\n        }\n        if (k-j ==0) {\n            m =0;\n        } else {\n            m = neg[m_size - (k-j)];\n        }\n        int option1 = 2*p + abs(m);\n        int option2 = p + 2*abs(m);\n        int current_min = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n        if (current_min < ans) {\n            ans = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nBut in C, since arrays are zero-based, and the code in Python uses pos[j-1] for j>0, which is the j-th element (since j is the count of elements taken). So if j=1, then j-1=0, which is the first element in the pos array. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the negative array, in Python, the code accesses lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]. For example, if lst_m has 5 elements (indices 0-4), and (k-j)=3, then the index is 4-3=1. So in C, the code would be neg[m_size -1 - (k-j) +1? Wait, no. The code for Python is:\n\nlasty = len(lst_m) -1\n\nm = lst_m[lasty - (k-j)]\n\nSo in C, for m_size elements, the code is:\n\nindex = (m_size -1) - (k-j)\n\nSo in C, m = neg[ (m_size-1) - (k-j) ]\n\nBut in C, if (k-j) is greater than m_size, then (m_size - (k-j)) could be negative, leading to invalid array access.\n\nBut in the check function's loop, we have an if condition:\n\nif (j > lastx || (k-j) > lasty)\n\nIn the Python code, lastx is len(lst_p) (p_size in C), so j must be <= lastx. Similarly, (k-j) must be <= lasty (m_size). So in C, the code's for loop j runs from 0 to k. Then, for each j, it checks if j > p_size (lastx is len(lst_p), which is p_size). So in C:\n\nif (j > p_size || (k-j) > m_size) { continue; }\n\nSo (k-j) can't be larger than m_size. So in C, when (k-j) is <= m_size, then (m_size-1) - (k-j) +1 ?\n\nWait, wait. Let's take an example. Suppose m_size is 5, and (k-j) is 3. Then (m_size-1) is 4. 4 -3 +1 = 2. So index 2. But how does that make sense? \n\nWait, no. For m_size=5, (k-j)=3. So (m_size -1) - (k-j) =4-3=1. So the index is 1. So the code accesses neg[1]. But why? \n\nThis suggests that the code for the negative array is accessing elements from the beginning of the array. For example, if the negative array is [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1], and (k-j) is 3, then the code would take the element at index 1, which is -4. But the three farthest elements would be -5, -4, -3. But why take just the third one? This doesn't make sense. \n\nBut perhaps the code is not correct. However, the translation must proceed as per the original code. \n\nSo the C code's check function must replicate this logic. \n\nAnother issue in C is that the variables p_size and m_size are global, or they need to be passed into the check function. Since the original Python code uses variables in the global scope, in C, we need to either use global variables or pass them as parameters. So, for example, in C, the check function would need to have access to the pos array, p_size, neg array, m_size. \n\nSo, in the C code, these variables would be declared outside of main (global variables) or passed to the check function. But since C functions cannot return arrays, and the check function is called once, perhaps it's easier to use global variables. \n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\nint pos[100000];\nint neg[100000];\nint p_size = 0;\nint m_size = 0;\n\nint check(int k) {\n    int ans = 1e9; // 1000000000\n    for (int j=0; j<=k; j++) {\n        if (j > p_size || (k - j) > m_size) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        int p = 0;\n        if (j != 0) {\n            p = pos[j-1];\n        }\n        int m = 0;\n        if (k - j != 0) {\n            // Python: lst_m[lasty - (k-j)] where lasty = len(lst_m)-1\n            // in C: m_size-1 - (k-j) +0\n            m = neg[ m_size -1 - (k-j) +1 ]; // wait, no. Let's compute:\n            // in Python, the index is lasty - (k-j) = (m_size-1) - (k-j)\n            m = neg[ (m_size -1) - (k-j) ];\n        }\n        int option1 = 2 * p + abs(m);\n        int option2 = p + 2 * abs(m);\n        int current_min = option1 < option2 ? option1 : option2;\n        if (current_min < ans) {\n            ans = current_min;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int N, K;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &K);\n    int zero_count =0;\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n        int num;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &num);\n        if (num ==0) {\n            zero_count++;\n            K--;\n        } else if (num >0) {\n            pos[p_size++] = num;\n        } else {\n            neg[m_size++] = num;\n        }\n    }\n    K = K > 0 ? K : 0;\n    int result = check(K);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but after processing zeros, K may be negative. So in the original code, K can be negative, but the check function is called with that value. So in the code, when K is negative, the check function's loop runs from 0 to K, which is not possible. So the code returns 1e9, but if K was reduced to negative, that means we have enough zeros to cover the required K, and the answer should be zero. So the code has a mistake here. \n\nIn the original Python code, after processing zeros, K can become negative, and then check(K) is called. For example, K is initially 3, and there are 5 zeros. Then K becomes 3-5= -2. The check function is called with K=-2. Then, the loop j runs from 0 to K (which is -2), so the loop doesn't execute, and ans remains 1e9. But the correct answer should be zero, since you can collect 3 zeros. \n\nSo the original code is incorrect. But since we are to translate it as is, the C code will have the same mistake. \n\nBut in the Python code, the check function returns ans, which is initialized to 1e9. But when K is reduced to zero or negative, the code may not handle it. So the correct approach is to handle K being negative before calling check. For example, if K <=0, output zero. \n\nBut according to the original code, it's not done. So the code is incorrect. \n\nBut the translation must be faithful. So the C code will replicate this.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after subtracting the zero_count from K, but in the case where K becomes negative, the code still calls check(K). For example, if K was 3 and there are 5 zeros, then K becomes -2. The check function will process K=-2, which is j from 0 to -2, which is not possible. So the ans remains 1e9, which is wrong. \n\nSo the original code is incorrect. But the translation must replicate it. \n\nTherefore, the C code should also have this error. \n\nAnother thing to note: in the Python code, the positive and negative lists are not sorted. So in C, the pos and neg arrays are in the order of input. So the code's logic is to take the first j elements from pos and the last (k-j) elements from neg. \n\nBut for the code to work correctly, the pos and neg arrays should be sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. But since the original code does not sort them, the translation also must not sort them. \n\nSo, the final C code will:\n\n- Read N and K.\n\n- Read the list of numbers.\n\n- Split into pos and neg arrays, counting zeros.\n\n- Adjust K by subtracting zeros.\n\n- Call check(K) and print the result.\n\nThe check function loops j from 0 to K, checking if j and (k-j) are within the pos and neg array sizes. For each valid j, compute p and m, then the minimal option.\n\nThus, the translated code should look like the one above. \n\nTesting the code with sample input would help. For example, sample input where the pos and neg arrays are not sorted. \n\nAnother issue is that in C, the neg array is stored as the input order. When (k-j) is 2 and m_size is 3, the code takes the element at index (3-1) -2 = 0. So the first element of the neg array. \n\nSo, for example, if the input for negatives is -3, -1, -5 (so m_size=3, neg[0]=-3, neg[1]=-1, neg[2]=-5), and (k-j) is 2. Then (3-1) -2 =0. So m=neg[0] =-3. But the two farthest elements are -3 and -5. But the code uses m=-3. So the code is incorrect. \n\nBut since the original code is like this, the C code must replicate this behavior. \n\nTherefore, the translation is correct in mirroring the original Python code, including any logical errors."
