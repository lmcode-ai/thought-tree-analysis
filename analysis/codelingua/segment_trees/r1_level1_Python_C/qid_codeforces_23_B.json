But in C, if I structure it as two separate ifs, it would work the same. However, in this case, since the conditions are mutually exclusive (a can't be both <2 and >=2 at the same time), the code could be optimized by using an else clause. Which is better practice. But since the original code uses two separate ifs, maybe the user wants to replicate that exactly. Let's check: for a >=2, the second if is executed. So for a=2, the code would print 0. Which is correct. So in C, whether we use else if or just two ifs, it's the same here. But perhaps using else is more efficient. But since the original code has two separate ifs, but the conditions are mutually exclusive, in C it's better to use an else. Let me check: in the original code, after a is read, if a <2, print 0. Then, regardless of whether that was true or not, check if a >=2. So for a=3, first condition is false, second is true. So code prints 1. For a=1, first condition is true, so prints 0. Then the second condition is false, so nothing. So yes, the code works. So in C, using an else would be better.
