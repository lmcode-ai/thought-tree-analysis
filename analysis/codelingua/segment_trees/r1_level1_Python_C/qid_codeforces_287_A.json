So for each 2x2 block, four cells are checked. For example, in the first block (i=0,j=0), the code checks the four cells. The counts are 4. Then, if the condition is not met, reset to 0. Then j increments to 1, for the next block (i=0,j=1), which starts with black=0, white=0 again. So that's correct. But if the code breaks in j=0 (i=0), then for the next i=1 loop, the j starts again at 0. But black and white are still whatever they were after breaking. So for example, if in i=0, j=0, the condition is met, then black and white are not reset. Then, in i=1, j=0, the code starts adding to those existing values, which is wrong.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let's see what the code does first. The Python code reads a 4x4 grid of characters. Then, for each 2x2 block in the grid, it checks if all four characters are the same (either all '#' or all '.') or if three are the same. If any such block exists, it sets correct to 1 and breaks out, eventually printing \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nFirst, in C, I'll need to handle input differently. Since the Python code uses input() and splits into a list of characters for each row, in C I can read each line as a string using fgets or scanf. But I have to be careful with newline characters. Let's think: each of the 4 lines in the input is a row of 4 characters. So for each of the 4 iterations, read a string of length 4 (plus null terminator, so maybe 5 chars). So maybe declare a 2D array of chars, like char t[4][5]; Then read each row using scanf(\"%s\", t[i]) or similar. But need to make sure that each row is exactly 4 characters. Oh, but in the Python code, each line is read as a list of characters, which would be 4 elements. So in C, each row is a string of length 4, so t[i][j] would be each character.\n\nThen, the main logic. The loops in Python are for i in 0..3 (since range(4)), but then in the 2x2 blocks, the code loops i from 0 to 2 (since range(3)), and j from 0 to 2. Because a 4x4 grid has 3x3 2x2 blocks. So in C, the loops would be for i from 0 to 2, and j from 0 to 2.\n\nFor each 2x2 block (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), check each of these four positions. Count the number of '#' (black) and '.' (white). Wait, no: in the Python code, white is incremented when the character is not '#', which includes '.' and any other character. So perhaps in the original problem, the input is guaranteed to consist of only '#' and '.'? Because otherwise, the code counts any non-# as white. So when translating to C, we can do the same: for each cell, if it's '#', increment black, else increment white.\n\nThen, after counting the four cells, check if black is 0 (all white), 3 (three black, one white), or 4 (all black). Similarly for white being 0, 3, or 4. Wait, looking at the condition in Python: if (black ==0 or black ==3 or white ==0 or white ==3 or white ==4 or black ==4). Wait, that's redundant. Because if white is 0, then black is 4. Similarly, if white is 4, then black is 0. So the condition can be simplified, but the original code checks all those possibilities. So in C, we need to check if any of those conditions are met. If so, set correct to 1 and break out.\n\nThe original code has a break after checking, but since it's inside two loops, maybe need to break out of both. But in the Python code, once correct is set to 1, the code breaks out of the inner j loop and then proceeds. But since correct is already 1, the outer loops will proceed. Wait, in Python, after checking the 4 cells, if any condition is met, correct is set to 1 and break. Then, reset black and white to 0. Wait, no: the code breaks after setting correct=1, so it breaks out of the inner j loop. Then, after that, the loop continues for other i and j? Wait, no, because in the inner loop, after checking j, if correct is 1, it breaks, but then the outer loop (i) will continue unless there's a check. Wait, no: in the Python code, once correct is set to 1, the code breaks out of the inner j loop (the inner for j loop). Then, the code will go to the next i. But since correct is already 1, maybe there's no way to exit early. Hmm, perhaps the original code is not optimized. For example, even after finding a correct 2x2 block, it continues checking all other blocks. But since the code sets correct=1 and then breaks out of the inner j loop, but the i loop continues. But since correct is already 1, the final check is correct ==1, so the output is YES. So the code could have a problem where even if a correct block is found early, it still checks others, but the result is correct.\n\nSo in C, the same logic applies. So the code will check all possible 2x2 blocks, but as soon as any of them meets the condition, correct is set to 1. Once any block is found, the answer is YES.\n\nBut in the original code, after checking the four cells in the 2x2 block, if any condition is met, correct is set to 1, and the inner j loop is broken. Then, black and white are reset to 0. Wait, no: in the Python code, after setting correct=1 and breaking, the code breaks out of the inner loop (for j) and proceeds to the next i. But the code does not break out of the i loop. So even if a correct block is found, the code continues checking all other blocks. However, once correct is 1, any subsequent checks don't change that. So the code is correct, but not optimized. The translation to C should follow the same logic.\n\nSo, in C, the code would read the 4x4 grid, then loop i from 0 to 2 (inclusive), j from 0 to 2 (inclusive). For each (i,j), check the four cells (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). For each of these, count black and white. Then check if any of the conditions are met. If so, set correct=1 and break out of the j loop (using a break statement). Then reset black and white to 0 for the next iteration.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the Python code, after checking the four cells and the conditions, if the condition is not met, it resets black and white to 0. But in the code, after each 2x2 block processing, the code resets black and white. But in the code:\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        if t[i][j] == '#':\n            black +=1\n        else:\n            white +=1\n        ... check other three cells ...\n        then check if any of the conditions. if so, set correct=1 and break\n        then reset black and white to 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nThe code for each i, j:\n\n- initializes black and white to 0 (no, wait no). Wait, the code in the loop:\n\nInside the loop for i and j, the code starts by checking t[i][j], adding to black or white. Then checks the next three cells (j+1, i; i+1, j; i+1, j+1). So for each 2x2 block, all four cells are checked. Then, after checking all four cells, the code checks the condition. If the condition is met, correct is set to 1 and the inner loop breaks. Then, regardless of whether the condition is met, black and white are reset to 0. Wait no: after the condition check, if it's met, break is executed. Then, the code after the break (black=0, white=0) is skipped. Wait, no. Because the code is structured as:\n\nfor i in ...:\n    for j in ...:\n        check four cells and count black and white\n        if condition:\n            correct=1\n            break\n        reset black and white to 0\n\nSo, when the condition is met, the break is executed, which exits the inner j loop. Then, the code after the break (black and white reset) is not executed. But in the next iteration of j, the variables are not reset. Wait, but the variables black and white are declared outside the loops. Wait, no. In the Python code, black and white are initialized to 0 before the loops. Then, inside the loop for each i, j, they are accumulated (added to) when checking each cell. Then, after checking all four cells, if the condition is not met, they are reset to 0. Wait, this can't be right. Let me check.\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nblack = 0\n\nwhite = 0\n\ncorrect = 0\n\nfor i in 0..2:\n\n    for j in 0..2:\n\n        check t[i][j], add to black or white.\n\n        check t[i][j+1], add.\n\n        check t[i+1][j], add.\n\n        check t[i+1][j+1], add.\n\n        if (conditions met):\n\n            correct =1\n\n            break (the j loop)\n\n        black = 0\n\n        white =0\n\nSo for each j iteration, after processing the four cells, if the condition is not met, reset black and white to 0. But if the condition is met, after setting correct=1 and breaking out of the j loop, the code does not reset black and white. But in the next i iteration, black and white would have the previous values. Wait, but that's a problem. Because the code initializes black and white outside the loops. So when i increments, black and white are not reset. This is a bug in the original Python code. For example, suppose in the first i=0, j=0 iteration, the code processes a 2x2 block and adds to black and white. Suppose the condition is not met. Then, black and white are reset. Then j increments. But if in the next i=0, j=1 iteration, the code checks the four cells and accumulates into black and white again. But since black and white are not reset at the start of each j iteration, this would accumulate on top of the previous values.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the code:\n\nblack and white are initialized to 0 before the loops.\n\nThen, for each i and j:\n\nthey check the four cells, adding to black and white (so each cell in the 2x2 block is counted, but black and white are starting from 0 each time? Wait, no. Because black and white are declared before the loops. So, for the first iteration (i=0, j=0):\n\nblack starts as 0.\n\nThen, for each cell, they add 1 to black or white. After processing all four cells, they check the condition. If not met, reset to 0.\n\nSo for the next j=1 in the same i=0 loop:\n\nblack and white would start at 0 again? No. Because after processing j=0, if the condition is not met, they reset to 0. So j=1 would start with black and white at 0. But if in j=0, the condition was met, then black and white would not be reset, and j=1 would start with those values. But that's a problem.\n\nWait, this is a bug in the original Python code. Let's see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nblack = 0\n\nwhite = 0\n\ncorrect = 0\n\nfor i in range(3):\n\n    for j in range(3):\n\n        # check four cells, adding to black and white each time.\n\n        # after checking all four cells:\n\n        if (condition):\n\n            correct =1\n\n            break\n\n        # reset black and white\n\n        black =0\n\n        white =0\n\nWait, no. The code is structured as:\n\nfor i in range(3):\n\n    for j in range(3):\n\n        if t[i][j] == '#': black +=1 else white +=1\n\n        if t[i][j+1] ... same.\n\n        etc. for all four cells.\n\n        then check if condition met.\n\n        if yes: correct=1, break.\n\n        black =0\n\n        white=0\n\nSo for each j iteration, after processing all four cells, the code checks the condition. If not met, then black and white are reset to 0. But if the condition is met, then break the j loop, and the reset is not done.\n\nBut black and white are declared outside the i and j loops. So, for example, if in j=0, the condition is met, then black and white are not reset, and then when moving to j=1 (if the break didn't occur), they would retain their previous values. But wait, if the code breaks the j loop, then after the inner loop, the code proceeds to the next i.\n\nBut in Python, the break in the j loop would exit the j loop, but the i loop continues. So the code would proceed to the next i.\n\nBut black and white would not be reset between i iterations. For example, in the first i=0, j=0 iteration:\n\nsuppose the condition is not met. Then black and white are reset to 0. Then j increments to 1. For j=1, processing the next 2x2 block, but since black and white were reset, the counts start from 0 again.\n\nBut if in j=0, the condition is met, then black and white are not reset. Then, the code breaks out of the j loop, and i increments to 1. Then, in the next i=1 loop, j starts at 0 again, but black and white are still whatever they were from the last j=0 of i=0. So this is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the original Python code has a bug. Because the variables black and white are not reset for each new 2x2 block. So the counts would accumulate across different blocks.\n\nFor example, suppose the first block (i=0,j=0) has 2 blacks and 2 whites. Then black and white would be 2 each. The condition is not met (since none of the conditions are 0,3,4). Then black and white are reset to 0. Then j increments to 1. Next block (i=0,j=1). Processing that block's four cells, starting with black=0 and white=0.\n\nBut if in any iteration, the code breaks due to the condition, then black and white are not reset, and the next i loop will have those values. Which would affect the processing of the next block.\n\nThis is a bug in the original code. So when translating to C, we need to make sure that for each 2x2 block, the counts are reset to 0 before processing the block.\n\nThe correct approach is to reset black and white to 0 at the start of each j iteration.\n\nBut in the original Python code, this is not done. So the code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps that's the case. Let's see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nblack and white are initialized once, outside the loops.\n\nThen, for each i and j:\n\nblack and white are incremented as per the four cells.\n\nIf the condition is met, break, else reset to 0.\n\nBut the code should have black and white reset to 0 for each new j. So for each j, before processing the block, reset to 0. But in the original code, this is not done.\n\nFor example, the first j=0: process four cells, adding to black and white. Then check condition. If not met, reset to 0. Then j increments to 1. For j=1, when processing the next block's cells, black and white start at 0. So that's correct. But if during j=0, the code breaks (correct is set to 1), then for j=1, since the j loop is broken, we proceed to i=1. But black and white are still set to their previous values. Then, in i=1's j=0 loop, the code starts adding to the existing black and white. Which is incorrect.\n\nThus, the original code has a logical error. Because the variables black and white are not reset at the start of each new 2x2 block.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, perhaps the code is intended to count for each 2x2 block the number of black and white cells. So the counts should be per block, not cumulative.\n\nThus, the original code is incorrect. So when translating to C, this error should be fixed. Or perhaps the original code is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the logic.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code starts with black=0, white=0. Then, for each i and j:\n\nfor each of the four cells in the block (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1):\n\nthey check each cell and increment black or white. So for each 2x2 block, four cells are checked. For example, in the first block (i=0,j=0), the code checks the four cells. The counts are 4. Then, if the condition is not met, reset to 0. Then j increments to 1, for the next block (i=0,j=1), which starts with black=0, white=0 again. So that's correct.\n\nBut if the code breaks in j=0 (i=0), then for the next i=1 loop, the j starts again at 0. But black and white are still whatever they were after breaking. So for example, if in i=0, j=0, the condition is met, then black and white are not reset. Then, in i=1, j=0, the code starts adding to those existing values, which is wrong. Because each 2x2 block should be counted independently.\n\nThus, the original code has a bug. The variables black and white should be reset to 0 at the start of each i and j iteration.\n\nSo the correct approach is, for each i and j:\n\nreset black and white to 0.\n\ncheck the four cells.\n\nThen check the condition.\n\nIf met, set correct=1 and break.\n\nThus, in the Python code, the variables are initialized once, and not reset per block. So the code is wrong.\n\nTherefore, when translating to C, this error should be fixed. The correct code would reset black and white to 0 at the start of each j iteration.\n\nSo in C, inside the i and j loops, before processing the four cells, black and white should be set to 0.\n\nSo the correct steps for each block:\n\n- reset black and white to 0.\n\n- check each of the four cells, incrementing black or white.\n\n- check the condition.\n\nSo the code should look like:\n\nfor i from 0 to 2:\n\n    for j from 0 to 2:\n\n        black = 0;\n\n        white = 0;\n\n        check t[i][j] and increment.\n\n        check t[i][j+1]\n\n        check t[i+1][j]\n\n        check t[i+1][j+1]\n\n        if condition met:\n\n            correct = 1;\n\n            break;\n\nSo this would fix the bug.\n\nSo in the original Python code, the variables black and white are not reset at the start of each j loop. Thus, the code is incorrect, and the C translation should correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to move the reset of black and white to the start of each j loop.\n\nSo in the Python code, the line 'black=0' and 'white=0' are at the end of the j loop. But if the code breaks due to the condition being met, those variables are not reset. So when the next j loop starts (for the next i), the variables are not reset, leading to incorrect counts.\n\nThus, to fix this, in the C code, we should set black and white to 0 at the start of each j loop iteration.\n\nSo, the C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    char t[4][5];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", t[i]);\n    }\n\n    int correct = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n            int black = 0, white = 0;\n\n            if (t[i][j] == '#') black++;\n            else white++;\n\n            if (t[i][j+1] == '#') black++;\n            else white++;\n\n            if (t[i+1][j] == '#') black++;\n            else white++;\n\n            if (t[i+1][j+1] == '#') black++;\n            else white++;\n\n            if (black == 0 || black == 3 || black ==4 || white ==0 || white ==3 || white ==4) {\n                correct = 1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (correct) break;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", correct ? \"YES\" : \"NO\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, after processing each j, if not breaking, it resets black and white. But in reality, for each j, the code should process a new block, so the reset is unnecessary if they are initialized at the start of the j loop.\n\nThus, the C code initializes black and white to 0 at the start of each j iteration, which is correct.\n\nAdditionally, in the original Python code, after breaking out of the j loop (when correct is 1), the code continues to the next i. So to optimize, in C, once correct is set to 1, we can break out of the i loop as well. Thus, adding a check after the inner loop to break the outer loop if correct is 1.\n\nThis is done in the C code above with 'if (correct) break;' after the inner j loop.\n\nSo this makes the code more efficient, but also correct. Because once a correct block is found, there's no need to check further.\n\nThus, the translated C code should correctly replicate the intended logic, with the necessary corrections for the reset of black and white.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how input is read. In Python, input().split() would read a line and split into characters. In C, using scanf(\"%s\", t[i]) reads a string (without whitespace). So as long as each input line is exactly 4 characters (without any leading or trailing spaces), this will work.\n\nThus, the code reads four lines of four characters each, then checks each 2x2 block. If any block has all four same, three same and one different, then output YES.\n\nThis should correctly replicate the Python code's intended functionality, but with the necessary fixes to the variable initialization."
