So:\n\nchar s[100];\nscanf(\"%s\", s);\nif (strlen(s) ! = 4) {\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThen proceed with the counts. Now, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s[5]; // 4 characters + null\n    scanf(\"%4s\", s); // read exactly 4 characters?\n\n    // Check length\n    if (strlen(s) ! = 4) {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int counts[256] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        counts[(int)s[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int total_chars = 0;\n    int num_two = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (counts[i] ! = 0) {\n            total_chars++; if (counts[i] == 2) {\n                num_two++;\n            } else {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (total_chars == 2) {\n        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n} Wait, but even if there are exactly two characters, each with count 2, but maybe other characters also have counts. Wait no, because in the loop, any non-zero count that's not 2 would have caused the code to exit with \"No\". So for example, if the string is 'aabb', the counts for 'a' and 'b' are 2 each.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code to C. Let me look at what the Python code does step by step.\n\nFirst, the code reads a string S. Then it uses Counter from collections to count the occurrences of each character. Then it converts the string into a set to get unique characters. If the size of this set isn't 2, it prints \"No\" and exits. Then it checks if each character in the set appears exactly two times. If both have counts of 2, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nSo in C, I can't use Counter, so I'll have to implement the counting manually. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nThe input string in C can be read using fgets or scanf. But since the input is a single string, maybe using scanf with %s would work, assuming no spaces. Let's use a char array, say s[100] or something, and read it.\n\nThen, check the length of the string. Wait, but the Python code's logic is that the string must have exactly 4 characters? Wait no, because if the set has two characters, each appearing exactly twice, then the total length is 4. Because 2*2=4. So the original code checks if the string is made up of exactly two different characters, each occurring exactly two times. So the input must be of length 4.\n\nWait, the Python code first checks if the set has size 2. Then for each of those two elements, checks if count is 2. So the total length is 2*2=4. So the input must be a 4-character string with exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.\n\nSo in C, first, I can check if the length is not 4. If it's not, immediately output \"No\". Then, check if there are exactly two different characters, and each appears exactly twice.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the string. Ensure it's length 4. (But in Python, input() might include a newline? Or perhaps the original code expects that the input is a single line with exactly 4 characters. Hmm, but in the code, S is taken via input().strip() maybe? Wait, the original code uses input(), which includes the trailing newline? No, input() reads until the newline, then strips the newline. Wait, no. input() reads a line from input, excluding the trailing newline. So S will be the user's input as a string, without the newline.\n\nSo in C, when we read the string using, say, scanf(\"%s\", s), it will read until whitespace. So if the input is a 4-character string, like 'aabb', then s will be stored as 'aabb' with a null terminator. But we need to make sure that the input is exactly 4 characters long, and that there are exactly two unique characters, each appearing twice.\n\nSo steps in C:\n\n- Read the input string. Check that its length is 4. If not, print \"No\".\n\n- Then, check the unique characters. Since the length is 4, there can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 unique characters. But for the answer to be \"Yes\", there must be exactly two unique characters, each appearing twice.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nWe can create a frequency array. Let's have an array that counts the occurrences of each possible character. Since the characters could be any ASCII, but for simplicity, perhaps just using an array of size 256 (assuming ASCII characters), initialized to zero.\n\nThen, iterate through the 4 characters of the string, increment the count for each character.\n\nThen, collect the counts. We need exactly two different characters, each with count 2.\n\nSo after counting, we can iterate through all possible characters (from 0 to 255) and check how many have counts of 2. If there are exactly two such characters, and all other counts are zero, then output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, since the string is length 4, and we've already checked that, we can collect the counts and check:\n\nThe counts should have exactly two entries equal to 2, and the rest zero.\n\nWait, but in the case of three different characters, like 'aabc', then the counts would be a:2, b:1, c:1. So sum would be 4, but the counts for a is 2, but others are 1, so that's invalid.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the string. Check length is 4.\n\nIf not, output No.\n\nElse, create a frequency array.\n\nLoop through each character in the string, increment counts.\n\nThen, check that there are exactly two characters with count 2, and the sum of all counts is 4.\n\nWait, but in the case of two characters, each count 2, sum is 4. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, after counting, collect all the non-zero counts. If there are exactly two, and both are 2, then yes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input into a char array. Then:\n\nif (strlen(s) != 4) {\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThen, create an int array count[256] = {0};\n\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n    count[(int)s[i]]++;\n}\n\nThen, check how many entries in count are 2. Exactly two entries should be 2, and the rest zero.\n\nAlternatively, collect all non-zero counts. Then, check if there are exactly two entries, both 2.\n\nSo code:\n\nint counts[256] = {0};\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n    counts[(int)s[i]]++;\n}\n\nint num_two = 0;\nint total_chars = 0;\nfor (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n    if (counts[i] != 0) {\n        total_chars++;\n        if (counts[i] == 2) {\n            num_two++;\n        } else {\n            // if any count is not 2, then invalid\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nif (total_chars == 2 && num_two == 2) {\n    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n}\n\nWait, but the loop in the code above would check each non-zero count. If any of them is not 2, then we immediately print No. So if all non-zero counts are 2, and there are exactly two of them, then yes.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nBut wait, in the code:\n\nfor each character in 0-255:\n\nif counts[i] is non-zero:\n\n   total_chars increases by 1.\n\n   if counts[i] is 2, num_two increases.\n\n   else, print No and exit.\n\nSo in the case where any of the counts is not 2, then we print No immediately.\n\nOtherwise, after processing all, check if total_chars is 2.\n\nSo that's the correct logic.\n\nSo putting this into code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nFirst, include necessary headers: stdio.h, string.h.\n\nRead the input. Use scanf(\"%s\", s). But need to check that the input is exactly 4 characters. Because in C, if the input is longer, the rest will be stored, but we need to make sure that the length is exactly 4.\n\nBut in the Python code, input().strip() could have length 4, but in C, using scanf with %s reads until whitespace. So if the input is, say, aabb, then the length will be 4.\n\nSo:\n\nchar s[5]; // to hold 4 chars + null terminator.\n\nscanf(\"%4s\", s); // read up to 4 characters. But this might leave characters in the input buffer. Alternatively, check after reading.\n\nBut perhaps better to read the input and then check the length.\n\nSo:\n\nchar s[100];\nscanf(\"%s\", s);\nif (strlen(s) != 4) {\n    printf(\"No\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThen proceed with the counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s[5]; // 4 characters + null\n    scanf(\"%4s\", s); // read exactly 4 characters?\n\n    // Check length\n    if (strlen(s) != 4) {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int counts[256] = {0};\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        counts[(int)s[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int total_chars = 0;\n    int num_two = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        if (counts[i] != 0) {\n            total_chars++;\n            if (counts[i] == 2) {\n                num_two++;\n            } else {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (total_chars == 2) {\n        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but even if there are exactly two characters, each with count 2, but maybe other characters also have counts. Wait no, because in the loop, any non-zero count that's not 2 would have caused the code to exit with \"No\".\n\nSo for example, if the string is 'aabb', the counts for 'a' and 'b' are 2 each. The loop through 256 would process these two, check if their counts are 2. So total_chars is 2, num_two is 2, so code prints Yes.\n\nIf the string is 'aaab', then counts for 'a' is 3, 'b' is 1. So in the loop, when processing 'a' (count 3), else clause triggers, print No and exit.\n\nIf the string is 'aabc' (length 4), then counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. So in the loop, when processing 'b' (count 1), else clause triggers, print No.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nCase 1: \"aabb\" \u2192 Yes.\n\nCase 2: \"abab\" \u2192 Yes.\n\nCase 3: \"aaaa\" \u2192 counts for 'a' is 4 \u2192 else clause triggers, print No.\n\nCase 4: \"abbb\" \u2192 'a' count 1, 'b' count 3. So when 'a' is processed (count 1 \u2192 else clause), print No.\n\nCase 5: \"abcd\" \u2192 each count 1 \u2192 else clause for all. So first non-zero count (1) triggers else \u2192 print No.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what if the input has exactly two characters, but one occurs 3 times and the other once? Like 'aaab'? Then the code checks counts for 'a' is 3 \u2192 else clause triggers, prints No.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should correctly handle all scenarios."
