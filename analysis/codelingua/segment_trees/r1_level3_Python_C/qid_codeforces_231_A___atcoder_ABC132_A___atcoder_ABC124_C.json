But the original chain:\n\n          First program: n=0 -> no lines -> c1=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n          Second program: gets \"0\" -> distinct_count=1 -> output \"No\"\n\n          Third program: gets \"No\" -> output 2. So our program outputs 2. Another example: n=1, and the line: \"2 0\" -> sum=2 -> c1=1 -> then same as above. Another: n=2, and both lines have sum>1 -> c1=2 -> s1=\"2\"\n\n          distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", then result=2. But what if the first program outputs 11? s1=\"11\": distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", result=2. How do we get \"Yes\"? We need the string s1 to have exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice. Example: s1 = \"1122\" -> but that would be c1=1122? But the first program: the count is the number of lines with sum>1. If we have 1122 lines? That's a lot, but possible. Then: distinct_count=2 (characters '1' and '2') and each appears twice? Actually, in \"1122\", '1' appears twice and '2' appears twice -> valid -> s2=\"Yes\"\n\n          Then the third program: \n                s2 = \"Yes\" -> length=3\n                even indices: index0: 'Y', index2: 's'\n                odd index: index1: 'e'\n\n                even_0: 0, even_1:0, odd_0:0, odd_1:0 -> both options: 3-0=3 -> result=3. So output 3. Therefore, we write the code accordingly. Note: the third part: we are only counting the characters '0' and '1'. Any other character doesn't count as a match. This matches the Python code. Code:\n\n        We'll write the C program as described. Important: we must not output anything else. Let's code accordingly. Edge: if the integer is 0, then s1=\"0\", then distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", then the third part: s2=\"No\" (length=2) -> result=2. We output 2. We assume the input is as expected.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into a single C program without any I/O in the intermediate steps.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads an integer `n`, then for `n` lines, reads a list of integers per line and counts the number of lines where the sum of the list is > 1.\n\n 2. The second program reads a string `S` and checks if it has exactly two distinct characters and each character appears exactly twice. If not, prints \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\n 3. The third program reads a string `s`, then splits it into even and odd indices. It then computes two possibilities for making the string alternate (starting with '0' or '1') and prints the minimum number of changes required.\n\n However, note the sequence: the output of the first program is an integer (c) which is printed and then becomes the input for the second program? But the second program expects a string.\n\n Actually, the original chain is three separate programs. The input to the entire chain is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But wait: the second program expects a string. The first program outputs an integer (c). So the input to the second program is the string representation of that integer.\n\n Similarly, the third program takes a string, which is the output of the second program (either \"Yes\", \"No\", or the program exits without printing the next one?).\n\n However, the second program may exit early (with \"No\") and then the third program would not run? But note: the chain is executed in sequence. So the second program's output (whatever it is) is the input to the third program.\n\n But the second program can output:\n   - \"Yes\"\n   - \"No\"\n\n And the third program then takes that string and processes it.\n\n However, the problem says: the entire sequence. So we have to simulate:\n\n Step 1: Run the first program on the initial input. Its output (an integer) is then fed as a string to the second program.\n\n Step 2: The second program takes that string (which is the integer from the first, converted to string) and then processes it. It will output either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (or in the case of the second program, it might output \"No\" and exit early, but that's still an output).\n\n Step 3: The third program takes the output string from the second program and processes it.\n\n However, the original second program does not output the integer from the first program. It outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". Then the third program takes that string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and processes it.\n\n But the third program is designed to process a binary string? Actually, the third program in the example is:\n\n    s = list(input())\n    ... and then counts the even and odd indices.\n\n So if we feed it the string \"Yes\" or \"No\", it will process that.\n\n However, the example input for the entire chain:\n\n   The first program: \n        n = 3\n        then 3 lines of numbers\n\n   Then the second program gets the string \"2\" (if the first program counted 2 lines with sum>1) and then the second program checks \"2\": \n        set of '2' -> only one character -> so it would output \"No\"\n\n   Then the third program gets \"No\" as input and then processes that.\n\n But the original chain is intended to run as three separate programs. We are to combine them without intermediate I/O.\n\n How to do:\n\n   We must capture the output of the first part (the integer c) and pass it as a string to the second part.\n\n   Then capture the output of the second part (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and pass that string to the third part.\n\n   Then the third part produces the final output.\n\n However, note that the second program might exit early (via exit()) but that would terminate the entire program. So in the chain, the second program exits and then the third program doesn't run? Actually, no: the chain runs sequentially. The second program exits, so the third program doesn't run? But the problem says: the entire sequence. So we have to mimic the same behavior.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We'll break the C program into three parts:\n\n   Part 1: \n        Read integer n.\n        Then for n lines, read a line and split into integers (we don't know how many per line, but the condition is sum>1). We can assume that each line has at least one integer? And we can split by space.\n\n        We'll count the number of lines that have a sum of numbers > 1.\n\n        Then we have an integer `c1` (the count).\n\n   Part 2:\n        We need to convert `c1` to a string. Then we have to check that string for the second program's condition.\n\n        Condition of second program:\n            - The string must have exactly two distinct characters? But note: the integer `c1` might be multi-digit? For example, if `c1` is 10, then the string is \"10\" -> two distinct characters? Then we check that each character appears exactly twice? But \"10\" has two distinct characters: '1' and '0', and each appears once, not twice. So it would fail.\n\n        Actually, the second program:\n\n            S = input()   -> the string we got from the first program's output (which is the string representation of `c1`)\n            c = Counter(S) -> counts frequency of each char\n            Sa = set(S)   -> distinct characters\n\n            if len(Sa) != 2: \n                print(\"No\")\n                exit()\n            for i in Sa:\n                if c[i] != 2:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    exit()\n            print(\"Yes\")\n\n        So the second program expects the string to have exactly two distinct characters and each character must appear exactly two times.\n\n        Example: \"aabb\" -> set is {'a','b'}, and frequency of 'a' is 2, 'b' is 2 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the first program outputs an integer, which is then converted to a string. The string will only contain digits. So we are dealing with a string of digits.\n\n        Therefore, the second program will only output \"Yes\" if the integer from the first program, when converted to a string, has exactly two distinct digits and each digit appears exactly twice.\n\n        Otherwise, it outputs \"No\".\n\n        Then the program exits? Actually, if it prints \"No\", it exits immediately? But note: in the chain, the program exits and the next program runs? No, the next program doesn't run because the entire process would terminate? Actually, no: each program is run sequentially. The second program terminates (after printing \"No\") and then the third program is run with the output of the second program as input? \n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. The second program produces output and then the third program uses that output as its input. So we have to capture the output of the second program and then pass it to the third.\n\n        But in the second program, if we get a condition that fails, we print \"No\" and then exit. That terminates the second program. Then the third program is run with the string \"No\" as input.\n\n        Similarly, if the condition passes, we print \"Yes\", and then the third program runs with \"Yes\".\n\n   Part 3:\n        The third program takes a string (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") and then:\n\n            s = list(input())   -> so we have the string, say \"Yes\" -> ['Y','e','s'] or \"No\" -> ['N','o']\n\n            Then it splits into even and odd indices:\n\n                even indices: s[0], s[2] (if any) -> for \"Yes\": indices0: 'Y', index2: 's'\n                odd indices: s[1] -> 'e'\n\n            Then it computes:\n                even_counter: counts the characters at even indices.\n                odd_counter: counts the characters at odd indices.\n\n            Then it computes two possibilities:\n\n                Option1: even indices are '0' and odd indices are '1'\n                Option2: even indices are '1' and odd indices are '0'\n\n                But note: the string might not be binary. The original third program was designed for a binary string? Actually, the example in the third program uses the characters '0' and '1'. However, the input we are giving it is \"Yes\" or \"No\", which are arbitrary characters.\n\n            The program:\n\n                print(min(len(s) - (even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"]), len(s) - (even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"])))\n\n            This counts the number of positions that are already matching one of the two patterns? But note: the third program doesn't assume the input is binary. It just counts the occurrences of the character '0' and '1' in the even and odd positions? But if the input string doesn't contain '0' or '1', then even[\"0\"] and even[\"1\"] would be 0.\n\n            For example, for the string \"Yes\":\n\n                even_counter: at index0: 'Y', index2: 's' -> so counts: 'Y':1, 's':1 -> no '0' or '1'\n                odd_counter: at index1: 'e' -> counts: 'e':1 -> no '0' or '1'\n\n                Then:\n\n                  Option1: even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"] = 0 + 0 = 0 -> changes needed: len(s) - 0 = 3\n                  Option2: even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"] = 0 + 0 = 0 -> changes needed: 3\n\n                So the output would be 3.\n\n            Similarly, for \"No\": \n                even: ['N'] -> no '0' or '1'\n                odd: ['o'] -> no '0' or '1'\n                then both options: 2 (len(s)) - 0 = 2\n\n            So the third program outputs an integer.\n\n        But the original chain: \n          Input to the first program: \n             3\n             0 1\n             1 1 1\n             0\n\n          Then the first program: \n             n=3\n             Line1: [0,1] -> sum=1 -> skip\n             Line2: [1,1,1] -> sum=3 -> count=1\n             Line3: [0] -> sum=0 -> skip\n             So c=1 -> output \"1\"\n\n          Then the second program gets \"1\":\n             set of \"1\" -> {'1'} -> size=1 -> not 2 -> output \"No\"\n\n          Then the third program gets \"No\": \n             s = ['N','o'] -> length=2\n             even: [0]: 'N' -> even_counter: 'N':1 -> no '0' or '1'\n             odd: [1]: 'o' -> odd_counter: 'o':1 -> no '0' or '1'\n             Then:\n                 Option1: 0 + 0 = 0 -> changes = 2\n                 Option2: 0 + 0 = 0 -> changes = 2\n                 min = 2\n\n          So the final output is 2.\n\n        However, the original third program was designed for a binary string? But the problem says to run the chain as is.\n\n        Therefore, we have to implement the third program as given, without assuming the input is binary.\n\n Implementation in C:\n\n   We'll do:\n\n     Step 1: Read the first integer n, then n lines. We'll read each line and split by spaces and convert tokens to integers? Actually, we don't need the exact integers, we only need the sum and then check if the sum>1.\n\n        We can read the entire line and then parse the numbers.\n\n        But note: the input for the first part might be:\n\n          3\n          0 1\n          1 1 1\n          0\n\n        We have to read the integer n, then skip the newline, then read n lines.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n          int n;\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          // consume the newline after the integer\n          getchar();\n\n          Then for i=0 to n-1:\n             read a line: we can use fgets.\n\n        However, the numbers in the line are separated by spaces. We can read the line and then parse.\n\n        We'll read the line and then traverse to get the numbers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          char line[1000];\n          fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n          Then split the string by spaces and convert each token to integer? But note: the tokens are integers.\n\n        But note: the first part doesn't care about the individual numbers, only the sum. So we can:\n\n          int sum = 0;\n          int num;\n          char *token = strtok(line, \" \\n\");\n          while (token != NULL) {\n              sscanf(token, \"%d\", &num);\n              sum += num;\n              token = strtok(NULL, \" \\n\");\n          }\n\n        Then if sum>1, then count++.\n\n        Then we have the count `c1`.\n\n     Step 2: Convert `c1` to a string. We'll use sprintf.\n\n          char s1[20]; // enough for an integer\n          sprintf(s1, \"%d\", c1);\n\n        Now, we have the string `s1` for the second program.\n\n        Conditions for the second program:\n\n          - Count the frequency of each char in `s1`.\n          - Check the distinct characters: must be exactly two distinct.\n          - And each distinct character must appear exactly twice.\n\n          We'll create an array to count frequency for each character (we can assume ASCII, so 0-255).\n\n          Steps:\n\n            int freq[256] = {0};\n            for each char in s1:\n                freq[ (unsigned char) c ]++;\n\n            Then, we traverse the string to get the distinct characters? But we can traverse the frequency array? But we don't know which are present.\n\n            Alternatively, we can:\n\n              int distinct_count = 0;\n              for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                 if (freq[i] > 0) distinct_count++;\n              }\n\n            If distinct_count != 2, then we set the output string for the second program to \"No\".\n\n            Else, we check: for each distinct character, the frequency must be 2.\n\n            But note: the entire string might be longer? For example, if the integer was 1122, then the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters and each appears twice? Actually, the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters: '1' and '2', and '1' appears twice and '2' appears twice.\n\n            However, what if the integer is 1111? Then distinct_count=1 -> fails.\n\n            But note: the condition: for each distinct character, the frequency must be 2.\n\n            So we can:\n\n               int valid = 1;\n               for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                  if (freq[i] > 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                      valid = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n               }\n\n            Then if distinct_count==2 and valid, then output string is \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n            However, note: the second program does:\n\n               if distinct_count != 2: print \"No\" and exit.\n               else: check each distinct character: if any frequency !=2, print \"No\" and exit.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n               if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                   // output for second program is \"No\"\n               } else {\n                   for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                       if (freq[i] && freq[i]!=2) {\n                           // output \"No\"\n                           valid = 0;\n                           break;\n                       }\n                   }\n                   if (valid) {\n                       // output \"Yes\"\n                   } else {\n                       // output \"No\"\n                   }\n               }\n\n            Then we set the next string (for third program) to be either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n        But note: the second program does not output the string we are building, it outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\". And then the third program uses that output as input.\n\n        So we'll create a string `s2` that is either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n     Step 3: Now we have the string `s2` (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\") for the third program.\n\n        The third program:\n\n          s = list(input())   -> we have the string `s2`\n\n          Then split the string into even and odd indices.\n\n          We'll create two frequency counters (for even indices and for odd indices). But note: the third program in the example counts the frequency of each character? But then it only uses the counts for the characters '0' and '1'. However, the example code:\n\n            even = collections.Counter(s[0::2])\n            odd = collections.Counter(s[1::2])\n\n            print(min(len(s) - (even[\"0\"] + odd[\"1\"]), len(s) - (even[\"1\"] + odd[\"0\"])))\n\n          This means: \n\n            Option1: the pattern is even indices are '0' and odd indices are '1'. Then the number of matches without changing is: \n                     (number of even indices that are '0') + (number of odd indices that are '1')\n            Then the changes needed = total length - matches.\n\n            Similarly, Option2: even indices are '1' and odd indices are '0', then matches = (even indices that are '1') + (odd indices that are '0').\n\n          However, note: the third program does not assume the string is binary? It just counts the occurrences of the character '0' and '1'? If the string has other characters, then they are not counted as matches.\n\n          So we do:\n\n            int len_s = strlen(s2);\n            // We'll count:\n            int even_0 = 0, even_1 = 0;\n            int odd_0 = 0, odd_1 = 0;\n\n            for (int i=0; i<len_s; i++) {\n                if (i % 2 == 0) { // even index\n                    if (s2[i] == '0') even_0++;\n                    else if (s2[i] == '1') even_1++;\n                } else {\n                    if (s2[i] == '0') odd_0++;\n                    else if (s2[i] == '1') odd_1++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            Then:\n                int option1 = len_s - (even_0 + odd_1);\n                int option2 = len_s - (even_1 + odd_0);\n                int result = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n\n            Then we output the result.\n\n     Finally, the entire C program:\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Part1: Read n and n lines -> compute c1 (the count of lines with sum>1)\n\n          Part2: Convert c1 to a string s1, then check s1 to produce s2 (which is either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n\n          Part3: Process s2 to compute the result (an integer) and print that integer.\n\n     However, note: the original chain outputs:\n\n          First program: c1 (an integer)\n          Second program: either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (so that's a string output)\n          Third program: an integer.\n\n        But the problem says: only the last block should produce output. So we only output the final integer.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n        The original chain produces three outputs? Actually, no: the chain is connected by pipes. The first program's output is the second program's input, and the second program's output is the third program's input. The final output is the output of the third program.\n\n        Therefore, the C program should only output the result of the third program.\n\n        But wait: the second program outputs \"No\" and then the third program runs and outputs an integer? Then the entire output would be:\n\n            No\\n\n            <integer>\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. And the chain would have:\n\n            $ python file1.py | python file2.py | python file3.py\n\n        The output of the chain is the output of the last program.\n\n        So the C program should only output the integer from the third program.\n\n        But the original chain: the second program outputs \"No\" to stdout, which is then piped to the third program. The third program then uses that as input and outputs an integer. So the final output is the integer.\n\n        Therefore, we do not output the intermediate \"No\" or \"Yes\". We only output the integer from the third program.\n\n        Therefore, we skip printing the intermediate results.\n\n        So:\n\n          We simulate:\n\n            Step1: compute c1 (without printing it, but we convert to string for step2)\n\n            Step2: using the string representation of c1, we compute the string for the second program (either \"Yes\" or \"No\") without printing it, but we store it for step3.\n\n            Step3: using that string, compute the integer result and print it.\n\n     Example:\n\n        Input: \n          3\n          0 1\n          1 1 1\n          0\n\n        Then:\n\n          Step1: c1 = 1 -> string \"1\"\n\n          Step2: \n                distinct_count of \"1\": 1 -> so we set s2 = \"No\"   (but we don't print it)\n\n          Step3: \n                s2 = \"No\" (which is two characters: 'N','o')\n                even indices: index0: 'N' -> not '0' or '1', so even_0=0, even_1=0.\n                odd indices: index1: 'o' -> not '0' or '1', so odd_0=0, odd_1=0.\n                option1 = 2 - (0+0) = 2\n                option2 = 2 - (0+0) = 2\n                result = 2\n\n          Then we output: 2\n\n     But the original chain would output 2? \n\n        The original chain:\n\n          First program: outputs the integer 1 (so the string \"1\\n\" ?) -> but note: the print(c) in the first program adds a newline? \n\n          Then the second program reads \"1\" (without the newline? or with? Actually, the second program uses input(), which by default reads a line and strips the trailing newline? Actually, in Python, input() reads a line and returns it without the trailing newline.\n\n          So the first program: print(c) -> outputs the string representation of c and then a newline.\n\n          The second program: input() reads the entire line and strips the newline? Actually, no: input() does include the newline? Actually, no: the Python input() function reads a line from stdin and returns it without the trailing newline.\n\n          So the second program gets the string \"1\" (without newline).\n\n          Then the second program checks and outputs \"No\" (without newline? or with? The print(\"No\") adds a newline.\n\n          Then the third program: input() reads the entire line? But the second program printed \"No\\n\", so the third program gets \"No\" (without the newline because input() strips it).\n\n          Then the third program outputs an integer? The print in the third program: print(...) -> outputs the integer and a newline.\n\n          So the entire output: \n                \"No\\n\" from the second program and then the integer from the third.\n\n          But the third program's output is the only one that is the final output? Actually, the chain:\n\n                $ python file1.py | python file2.py | python file3.py\n\n          The output of the entire command is the output of the last program (file3.py). So we only see the integer.\n\n          Therefore, the C program should only output the integer (with a newline) at the end.\n\n     So we do:\n\n        In C, we only print the integer result from the third part at the end.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n        We must read the first integer n, then n lines.\n\n        We'll read the first integer with scanf, then we have to read the rest of the line (the newline) and then each of the n lines.\n\n        We assume that each line is no longer than 1000 characters.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          #include <stdio.h>\n          #include <stdlib.h>\n          #include <string.h>\n          #include <ctype.h>\n\n          int main() {\n              int n;\n              scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n              // consume the newline\n              while (getchar() != '\\n');   // to consume the rest of the line including the newline\n\n              int c1 = 0;\n              for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                  char line[1000];\n                  fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\n\n                  // Now, split the line by spaces and convert to integers to compute the sum.\n                  int sum = 0;\n                  char *token = strtok(line, \" \\n\");\n                  while (token != NULL) {\n                      int num = atoi(token);\n                      sum += num;\n                      token = strtok(NULL, \" \\n\");\n                  }\n                  if (sum > 1) {\n                      c1++;\n                  }\n              }\n\n              // Now, convert c1 to a string s1\n              char s1[20];\n              sprintf(s1, \"%d\", c1);\n\n              // Now, for the second part: process s1 to get s2 (either \"Yes\" or \"No\")\n              // We'll compute the frequency of each character in s1.\n              int freq[256] = {0};\n              int len_s1 = strlen(s1);\n              for (int i=0; i<len_s1; i++) {\n                  unsigned char c = s1[i];\n                  freq[c]++;\n              }\n\n              int distinct_count = 0;\n              for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                  if (freq[i] > 0) {\n                      distinct_count++;\n                  }\n              }\n\n              int valid = 1;\n              if (distinct_count != 2) {\n                  valid = 0;\n              } else {\n                  for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                      if (freq[i] > 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                          valid = 0;\n                          break;\n                      }\n                  }\n              }\n\n              char s2[4]; // either \"Yes\" or \"No\", so we need 3 characters (including null terminator) but \"No\" is 2, \"Yes\" is 3 -> so we allocate 4.\n              if (valid) {\n                  strcpy(s2, \"Yes\");\n              } else {\n                  strcpy(s2, \"No\");\n              }\n\n              // Now, third part: process s2 to compute the result.\n              int len_s2 = strlen(s2);\n              int even_0 = 0, even_1 = 0;\n              int odd_0 = 0, odd_1 = 0;\n\n              for (int i=0; i<len_s2; i++) {\n                  if (i % 2 == 0) {\n                      if (s2[i] == '0') even_0++;\n                      else if (s2[i] == '1') even_1++;\n                  } else {\n                      if (s2[i] == '0') odd_0++;\n                      else if (s2[i] == '1') odd_1++;\n                  }\n              }\n\n              int option1 = len_s2 - (even_0 + odd_1);\n              int option2 = len_s2 - (even_1 + odd_0);\n              int result = (option1 < option2) ? option1 : option2;\n\n              printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n              return 0;\n          }\n\n     However, note: the second program in the original chain uses the string that was read from input (which is the output of the first program). The output of the first program is the integer without any extra spaces? Yes, it's just the integer. And we converted with sprintf without any extra.\n\n     But note: the second program in the original chain uses the entire line? Yes, and we have stored the integer as a string without any extra. So it's the same.\n\n     But what if the integer is negative? The problem does not specify, but the first program: \n          n = int(input()) -> nonnegative? The input for the first program: n is the number of lines, so nonnegative.\n\n          Then the count c1 is at least 0.\n\n     So we are safe.\n\n     However, the third program: the example in the original third program uses the entire string (including the newline?) No, because the second program outputs without newline? Actually, the second program uses print(\"No\") which appends a newline. But in the chain, the third program reads with input() which removes the trailing newline.\n\n        But in our C program for the second part, we are storing \"No\" without a newline? Then the third part: we are using the string \"No\" (without newline) and that matches because the original third program would get \"No\" without the newline.\n\n        However, in the original chain, the second program outputs \"No\\n\", but the third program's input() returns the string without the newline. So we are storing \"No\" (without newline) for s2, which is correct.\n\n     Therefore, we don't add a newline in s2.\n\n     But note: when we stored s2, we did:\n\n          strcpy(s2, \"Yes\");   -> which is \"Yes\" without newline.\n\n          strcpy(s2, \"No\");   -> which is \"No\" without newline.\n\n     So we are good.\n\n     One more example: if the first program outputs 22 (so c1=22), then:\n\n          s1 = \"22\"\n\n          distinct_count: set of '2' -> 1? No, the string is \"22\": two characters, both '2'. So distinct_count=1 -> invalid -> s2 = \"No\"\n\n          Then the third part: \"No\" -> result=2.\n\n     But what if the first program outputs 1122? Actually, that would be a 4-digit number? But note: the first program: the count c1 is an integer. How big can it be? It can't be more than n, and n is the first integer. We don't know the bounds, but we allocated 20 characters, which should be enough for integers.\n\n     However, the problem does not specify bounds, but we assume reasonable.\n\n     So we write the code accordingly.\n\n     Let's test with a small example: n=0 -> then c1=0 -> s1=\"0\"\n\n          distinct_count: 1 -> invalid -> s2=\"No\", then result = 2.\n\n     But the original chain:\n\n          First program: n=0 -> no lines -> c1=0 -> output \"0\"\n\n          Second program: gets \"0\" -> distinct_count=1 -> output \"No\"\n\n          Third program: gets \"No\" -> output 2.\n\n     So our program outputs 2.\n\n     Another example: n=1, and the line: \"2 0\" -> sum=2 -> c1=1 -> then same as above.\n\n     Another: n=2, and both lines have sum>1 -> c1=2 -> s1=\"2\"\n\n          distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", then result=2.\n\n     But what if the first program outputs 11? \n\n          s1=\"11\": distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", result=2.\n\n     How do we get \"Yes\"?\n\n          We need the string s1 to have exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n          Example: s1 = \"1122\" -> but that would be c1=1122? But the first program: the count is the number of lines with sum>1. If we have 1122 lines? That's a lot, but possible.\n\n          Then: distinct_count=2 (characters '1' and '2') and each appears twice? Actually, in \"1122\", '1' appears twice and '2' appears twice -> valid -> s2=\"Yes\"\n\n          Then the third program: \n                s2 = \"Yes\" -> length=3\n                even indices: index0: 'Y', index2: 's'\n                odd index: index1: 'e'\n\n                even_0: 0, even_1:0, odd_0:0, odd_1:0 -> both options: 3-0=3 -> result=3.\n\n          So output 3.\n\n     Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n     Note: the third part: we are only counting the characters '0' and '1'. Any other character doesn't count as a match.\n\n     This matches the Python code.\n\n     Code:\n\n        We'll write the C program as described.\n\n     Important: we must not output anything else.\n\n     Let's code accordingly.\n\n     Edge: if the integer is 0, then s1=\"0\", then distinct_count=1 -> s2=\"No\", then the third part: s2=\"No\" (length=2) -> result=2.\n\n     We output 2.\n\n     We assume the input is as expected.\n\n     We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n     Note: We use strtok which is destructive (modifies the input string). But we are using a temporary buffer for each line.\n\n     We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n     One more note: the first program reads n, then the next n lines. We must read the entire line including any spaces. We are using fgets, which reads the entire line (if within the buffer size). We assume no line exceeds 999 characters.\n\n     We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n     Let me write the code."
