Then the second program gets the string \"30\". n = len(\"30\") = 2.\n  We build dp[2][13]. i=0: if not '?' -> digit '3' -> dp[0][3] = 1.\n  i=1:\n        digit '0' -> for k in 13: \n            new remainder = (k*10+0) % 13.

                                                                            "text": "However, let's write it for clarity. But the third program expects three integers. We are giving it one. So we form an array of one integer: B.\n\n  count = 0;\n  if (B == 5) count = 1;\n  if (count == 2) ... // false -> else branch. So we output \"NO\". But note: the third program in the example does not read three integers necessarily; it reads one line and splits. The number of integers is the number of tokens in that line. We are giving it one token, so one integer. So we do:\n\n  int ABC[1] = {B};\n  int count = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) { if (ABC[i] == 5) count++;\n  }\n  if (count == 2) {\n      int total = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) total += ABC[i];\n      if (total == 17) {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n  } else {\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n  } But since count will be either 0 or 1, we can just print \"NO\". So the C program will have:\n\n  // Step 1: Read n and the array\n  // Step 2: Compute A\n  // Step 3: Convert A to a string S\n  // Step 4: Using S, compute B (with the DP for modulo 13)\n  // Step 5: Prepare an array for the third program of one integer: B\n  // Step 6: Check the array: has exactly two 5's? -> no, so print \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the second program uses modulo arithmetic with mod = 10**9+7. We must do the same. Let's write the C program accordingly. We will assume the input for the first program is provided in two lines. Example: \n  First line: 1\n  Second line: 15\n\nWe'll read with scanf. Steps:\n\n  int n;\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  int arr[n];\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\n  Then compute A:\n\n  if (arr[0] > 15) {\n      A = 15;\n  } else {\n      int found = 0;\n      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n          if (arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 15) {\n              A = arr[i-1] + 15;\n              found = 1;\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n      if (!found) {\n          if (arr[n-1] == 90 || arr[n-1] + 15 >= 90) {\n              A = 90;\n          } else {\n              A = arr[n-1] + 15;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\n  Then convert A to a string. We'll use sprintf. char S[100]; // we assume A is at most 90, so 2 or 3 digits. But to be safe, 20 is enough.\n  sprintf(S, \"%d\", A);\n  int len = strlen(S);\n\n  Then run the second program's DP:\n\n  We'll have dp[len][13] (but we can do a 1D dp to save space). mod = 1000000007\n\n  Initialize dp[0..12] for the first character. Then for each character in S (from index 0 to len-1):\n      if the char is not '?' then d = char - '0'\n          for each remainder k in 0..12:\n              new_rem = (k * 10 + d) % 13\n              then new_dp[new_rem] = (new_dp[new_rem] + dp_old[k]) % mod\n      else\n          for each digit d from 0 to 9:\n              for each remainder k in 0..12:\n                  new_rem = (k * 10 + d) % 13\n                  new_dp[new_rem] = (new_dp[new_rem] + dp_old[k]) % mod\n\n  Then B = dp[5] (at the last character). Then we form an array of one integer: B.\n\n  Then we check: \n      count = 0\n      if (B == 5) count++;\n      if (count == 2) { // false\n          ... \n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\nBut note: the third program expects three integers, but we are giving it one. So we are simulating it on one integer.",

However, note: the original program does modulo at every step. We must do modulo. Then at the end, B = dp[5] (for the last character) modulo mod. Now, we are ready to code. But note: the first program might output 0? Then the string S is \"0\". Then we do:\n\n  len = 1. dp[0] = 1? because the first digit is 0 -> so we set dp[0] = 1. Then B = dp[5] at the last step = 0. But the original program for the second program: \n  if n==1: \n      if S=='5' or '?' then print(1) if it is 5, else if it is '0' then print(0). So for \"0\": \n      if n==1 -> true, then if S=='5'? no, so print(0). So we are consistent. Let's code accordingly. Steps:\n\n  Read n and array -> compute A.\n  Convert A to string -> S.\n  len = strlen(S) if (len == 0) -> then B=0? but the second program would do nothing? but A is at least 15? not necessarily: if the array has one element 0, then A = 0+15 = 15, so string \"15\", so len>=1. We'll do:\n\n      long long dp[13] = {0};\n      // for the first character\n      int d0 = S[0] - '0';\n      dp[d0] = 1;\n\n      for (int i=1; i<len; i++) {\n          long long next_dp[13] = {0};\n          int d = S[i] - '0';\n          for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n              if (dp[k]) {\n                  int new_rem = (k*10 + d) % 13;\n                  next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % mod;\n              }\n          }\n          // copy next_dp to dp\n          for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n              dp[k] = next_dp[k];\n          }\n      }\n\n      B = dp[5] % mod;\n\n  Then for the third program:\n\n      int ABC[1] = {B}; // but B might be modulo mod, but it's an integer, and we only care if it is 5? and then count it. int count = 0;\n      for (int i=0; i<1; i++) { if (ABC[i] == 5) count++;\n      }\n      if (count == 2) {\n          int total = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<1; i++) total += ABC[i];\n          if (total == 17) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\nBut note: the third program does not require the array to be of size 3. It reads one line and splits, so the array can be of any size. We are giving one integer, so the array is of size 1. However, the problem says: the third program is as given. So we must simulate with one integer. But note: the third program in the example code is:\n\n  ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split())) if ABC.count(5) == 2:\n      print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')\n  else:\n      print('NO') So for an array of one element, we do:\n\n      count = ABC.count(5)  -> 1 if the element is 5, else 0.\n\n      which is not 2 -> so we print 'NO'. Therefore, we can skip the condition and just print \"NO\". But to be safe, we do the condition. However, we can optimize: if B is not 5, then count=0 -> print \"NO\". if B is 5, then count=1 -> print \"NO\". So always \"NO\". So we can just do:\n\n      printf(\"NO\\n\"); But to be faithful, we do the condition. But note: the third program might be run on more than one integer in the original standalone? but in the chain, it is run on one integer. We are simulating the chain. Let's code accordingly. We must be cautious: the second program uses mod = 10**9+7. We do modulo 1000000007. But note: the third program uses the integer B without modulo?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to chain three programs. The first program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers of size `n`.\nThe second program reads a string (but note that in the chain, the output of the first program becomes the input to the second? Actually, let's analyze the flow).\n\nHowever, note the problem: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nBut the first program outputs an integer (either 15, arr[i-1]+15, 90, or arr[-1]+15) and the second program expects a string? \nThis seems inconsistent. Similarly, the third program expects a tuple of three integers.\n\nBut the example chain:\n\nFile1: reads an integer n and then n integers. It outputs one integer.\nFile2: reads a string. So the output of File1 (an integer) would be the input to File2? That doesn't match because File2 expects a string.\n\nThis indicates that the chain is not directly feeding the output of the first as the input of the second. Instead, the problem says that the programs are executed in sequence, and the output of each is used as the input to the next.\n\nBut the example programs are independent: they each read from stdin.\n\nSo the intended chain is:\n\n1. First program reads from stdin (the initial input) and produces an output (an integer).\n2. That integer is then the input to the second program? But the second program expects a string (which is a single character? or a string representation of the integer?).\n\nLooking at the second program: \n  S = str(input())\n  It reads a string. So if the first program outputs, say, 15, then the second program would read the string \"15\".\n\nBut the second program then processes the string and does a DP on the digits. The example: if the string is of length 1 and is '5' or '?', then it outputs 1.\n\nHowever, the output of the first program is an integer. We have to convert that integer to a string to feed to the second program.\n\nSimilarly, the second program outputs an integer (the value of dp[n-1][5] modulo mod). Then the third program expects a tuple of three integers.\n\nBut the third program does:\n  ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\nSo it expects one line with three integers.\n\nSo the output of the second program (an integer) must be converted to a string and then the third program reads that? But then the third program would read one integer and then try to split it? That would fail because there's only one integer.\n\nAlternatively, the chain might be:\n\nThe entire initial input is provided at once? Then each program reads from the same stdin? But the problem says: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\nThis suggests that we need to capture the output of the first program and feed it as input to the second, and the output of the second to the third.\n\nBut the third program expects three integers. How do we reconcile?\n\nAfter re-examining the problem: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So:\n\n- The first program reads from the initial input (which is provided by the user) and produces an output (let's call it A).\n- The second program should take A as its input. Since the second program reads a string, we must format A as a string and then feed that to the second program.\n- The second program produces an output (B), which is an integer (the result of the DP). Then the third program must take B as input. But the third program expects three integers. How can we feed one integer as three? \n\nAlternatively, note that the third program does not use the output of the second? The chain might be broken.\n\nBut the problem states: \"a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nSo we have:\n\nProgram1: reads from stdin (initial input) -> outputs a single integer.\nProgram2: reads the output of Program1 (as a string) -> outputs a single integer (the result of the DP).\nProgram3: reads the output of Program2? But Program3 expects three integers. \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the third program: it reads a tuple of three integers. But the output of the second program is one integer.\n\nTherefore, the chain must be:\n\nThe initial input for the entire system is provided to the first program. The first program reads two lines: \n  first line: n\n  second line: n integers\n\nThen the first program outputs one integer.\n\nThen the second program reads a string (which is the output of the first program). But note: the second program in the original code has its own input reading. However, in the chain, the input to the second program is the output of the first.\n\nSimilarly, the third program must read the output of the second program? But the third program expects three integers. \n\nBut the output of the second program is one integer. So we cannot form three integers.\n\nThis suggests that the chain is not as straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the initial input is provided in full, and each program reads from the same input stream? But the problem says the output of one is the input to the next.\n\nWe must reinterpret: the entire initial input is given to the first program. The first program reads the first part of the input (two lines) and leaves the rest? Then the second program reads the next part? But that is not how the chain is described.\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to the second program is the output of the first, and the input to the third is the output of the second.\n\nTherefore, we have to adjust:\n\nThe first program produces one integer. We must format that integer as a string (with a newline? or without?) and feed it to the second program. The second program then reads that string (which is one line). Then the second program produces one integer. Then we must feed that integer to the third program? But the third program expects three integers. \n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the third program might be reading from the original input? But the problem states that only the first block handles reading input? \n\nThe problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" meaning that the entire C program should read input only at the beginning? But then how do the subsequent programs get input?\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd: \n- Only the first block should handle reading input.\n- Only the last block should handle producing output.\n- Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\nSo the entire C program should read the input for all the programs at the beginning? Then how do we chain?\n\nActually, the chain is:\n\nThe input to the entire system is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first program is passed in memory (without I/O) to the second program. The output of the second program is passed to the third. Then the third program produces the final output.\n\nBut the first program in the chain reads two lines: \n  n\n  a list of n integers\n\nThe second program reads one string (which is the output of the first). The third program reads three integers (but the output of the second is one integer) -> so we have a problem.\n\nAlternatively, note that the third program in the example is independent: it reads a tuple of three integers. But in the chain, it should read the output of the second? \n\nThis chain is broken. \n\nLooking at the actual programs:\n\nProgram1: Solves a problem about a game with a maximum of 90 minutes and breaks of 15 minutes.\nProgram2: Counts the number of ways to form a string of digits and '?' such that the number modulo 13 is 5.\nProgram3: Checks if the given three numbers are two 5's and one 7 (since 5+5+7=17).\n\nThese seem unrelated. Therefore, I suspect that the chain is not feeding the output of one to the next as the entire input, but rather the initial input is split among the programs.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAfter re-examining the example: the problem states that the programs are meant to be executed in sequence, with the output of one being the input to the next.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, we have to assume that:\n\n- The first program reads the entire input? and then the next programs read the output of the previous.\n\nBut the third program requires three integers, but the second outputs one.\n\nAlternatively, the chain is:\n\nFirst program: reads two lines (n and the list) -> outputs an integer A.\nSecond program: reads a string (which is the entire initial input for the second program? But no, the problem says the output of the first is the input to the second). So the input to the second program is the string representation of A.\n\nThen the second program outputs an integer B.\n\nThen the third program: the input to the third program is the string representation of B? But the third program expects three integers. \n\nThis fails.\n\nTherefore, I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". The example provided has three separate programs. Each program reads from stdin and writes to stdout. The chain is: \n  $ python3 file1.py < input.txt > output1.txt\n  $ python3 file2.py < output1.txt > output2.txt\n  $ python3 file3.py < output2.txt\n\nBut then the input to file2 is the output of file1 (a single integer). The input to file3 is the output of file2 (a single integer). But file3 expects three integers. \n\nThis is not possible.\n\nUnless the initial input is provided to all programs? But the problem says the output of one is the input to the next.\n\nAlternatively, the entire initial input is provided to the first program, and then the first program's output is fed to the second, and the second's output to the third, and the third's output is the final output.\n\nBut then the second and third programs must be able to run with the output of the previous as their sole input.\n\nGiven that, we have to adjust the programs to fit the chain:\n\nFor the second program, if it is to read the output of the first, then that output is an integer. We can convert that integer to a string and that will be the string S for the second program.\n\nSimilarly, the third program must read the output of the second. The second program outputs one integer. The third program expects three integers. How can we make that work? \n\nThe third program could be adjusted to read one integer? But the code is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, the third program in the example is not taking the output of the second? \n\nThis is a puzzle.\n\nLooking at the third program: \n  ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\nIt reads one line and splits it. If we give it a string with one integer, then split will give one string. Then we try to map to int and get one integer. Then the tuple has one element. Then it checks ABC.count(5) -> but there is only one element. So it will print 'NO'. \n\nSo it would run, but the behavior is not useful.\n\nThis suggests that the chain as described is not functional. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\nWe must consider the entire system's input and output.\n\nThe entire system input is the input to the first program: \n  first line: n\n  second line: n integers\n\nThe entire system output is the output of the last program.\n\nThe chain is:\n\n  output1 = program1(input_system)\n  output2 = program2(str(output1))\n  output3 = program3(output2)   # but program3 expects three integers, but we have one\n\nThis fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output of the first program is not the only input to the second program? But the problem says the output of each is the input to the next.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think we must assume that the initial input is entirely consumed by the first program. The second program does not read from the initial input but only from the output of the first. The third program only from the output of the second.\n\nBut then the third program will fail.\n\nUnless the third program is not meant to be chained? The problem says \"entire sequence\".\n\nAnother possibility: the programs are chained, but the third program is independent of the first two? But then why chain?\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\nAnd the behavior is: when run on the same input, the final output should be the same as if we ran the three programs in sequence, piping the output.\n\nBut the third program will fail because it won't have three integers.\n\nUnless the initial input is provided in full to the entire system, and each program reads its own part? \n\nThe problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" So in the C program, we read the entire input at the beginning. Then we run the first program on its part, then pass the result to the second, then to the third.\n\nBut the first program requires two lines: the first integer n, then a list of n integers.\n\nThe second program requires one string (which will be the string representation of the output of the first program).\n\nThe third program requires three integers. But the output of the second program is one integer. \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nUnless the initial input has more data? \n\nBut the problem says: when run on the same input.\n\nThe same input for the entire system is what the first program reads. There is no additional input for the second and third. They only get the output of the previous.\n\nTherefore, we must represent the output of the first program as a string to feed to the second, and the output of the second as a string to feed to the third.\n\nBut the third program in the example reads one line and splits it into tokens. If we give it the string representation of the second program's output (which is an integer) then it will be one token. Then the third program will try to process one token and then do:\n\n  if ABC.count(5) == 2:   # ABC is a tuple of one element, so count(5) will be either 0 or 1 -> always NO.\n\nSo the third program will always output 'NO'.\n\nThis is not the intended behavior of the third program in isolation, but in the chain, it's what would happen.\n\nTherefore, we have to simulate:\n\n  Step1: Read n and the list of n integers.\n  Step2: Run the first program's logic and get an integer result A.\n  Step3: Convert A to a string (without any spaces, just the integer as a string) and use that as the input string for the second program.\n  Step4: Run the second program's logic on that string and get an integer result B.\n  Step5: We now have only one integer B, but the third program expects three integers. However, in the chain, the third program would read one integer (the string representation of B) and then split yields one integer. Then it will always print 'NO' because it will have only one integer and thus cannot have two 5's.\n\nSo the final output will always be 'NO'.\n\nBut this is not the same as running the third program in isolation on its own input.\n\nThe problem says: \"when run on the same input\". The same input for the entire system is the input to the first program. There is no additional input.\n\nTherefore, the third program will always get one integer and output 'NO'.\n\nSo the entire chain will be:\n\n  input: \n      n\n      a0 a1 ... a_{n-1}\n  output of first program: A (integer)\n  input to second program: the string of A\n  output of second program: B (integer)\n  input to third program: the string of B (which is one integer)\n  output of third program: 'NO'\n\nSo the final output is 'NO' regardless.\n\nBut that seems absurd.\n\nAlternatively, the initial input might include more than two lines? The first program reads two lines, but the initial input might have more lines that are then read by the second and third? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" So we read all input at the beginning.\n\nAnd: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\" for the entire chain.\n\nThis implies that the second and third programs do not read from the initial input but from the output of the previous program.\n\nTherefore, we must design the C program as follows:\n\n1. Read the entire input (from stdin) at the beginning. This input is what the first program would read (two lines: the first with n, the second with n integers).\n2. Run the first program's logic on that input and produce an integer A.\n3. Format A as a string (without spaces, just the number) and use that as the input for the second program.\n4. Run the second program's logic on that string and produce an integer B.\n5. Now, for the third program, we would normally use the string representation of B as its input. But the third program expects three integers. However, we only have one integer. So we will simulate the third program on a string that is the string of B (which is one integer). This will yield 'NO' as output.\n\nBut the problem says the final output is the output of the last program, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. In this chain, it will always be 'NO'.\n\nHowever, this is what would happen if we chained the three programs with pipes.\n\nBut let's test with an example:\n\nExample for first program:\n  Input: \n      1\n      15\n  Then: \n      arr[0] = 15 -> which is not >15, so we go to the for loop. The list has length 1, so the for loop doesn't run. Then we go to the else: \n          arr[-1] = 15 -> 15+15 = 30, which is <90 -> output 30.\n\nThen the second program gets the string \"30\".\n  n = len(\"30\") = 2.\n  We build dp[2][13].\n  i=0: \n        if not '?' -> digit '3' -> dp[0][3] = 1.\n  i=1:\n        digit '0' -> for k in 13: \n            new remainder = (k*10+0) % 13.\n            So for k=3: new = (30) % 13 = 4.\n            dp[1][4] = 1.\n        Then we output dp[1][5] = 0.\n\nSo B = 0.\n\nThen the third program gets the string \"0\". \n  It splits and gets [0] -> one integer 0.\n  ABC = (0,)\n  count of 5 is 0 -> prints 'NO'.\n\nSo the final output is \"NO\".\n\nNow, if we ran the programs independently with piping, we would get the same.\n\nBut is there a scenario where the third program might output 'YES'? \n  Only if the output of the second program is a string that when split yields three integers that are two 5's and one 7.\n\nBut the output of the second program is one integer. So it's impossible to get three integers.\n\nTherefore, the third program will always output 'NO'.\n\nSo the C program will always output \"NO\", but wait: what if the second program outputs an integer that is at least 100? Then the string representation would have at least three digits? But the third program splits by space. There are no spaces in the string representation of an integer. So the third program will always see one token.\n\nSo it will always be one integer.\n\nTherefore, the third program will always output \"NO\".\n\nBut then why include it?\n\nAlternatively, the chain might be:\n\n  The first program's output is not the only input to the second program? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\nWe are forced to conclude that the entire chain will always output \"NO\".\n\nHowever, this seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, we will write a C program that:\n\n1. Reads the integer n.\n2. Reads an array of n integers.\n3. Applies the first program's logic to compute an integer A.\n4. Converts A to a string (without any spaces or newlines) and uses that string as input to the second program's logic.\n5. Applies the second program's logic to compute an integer B.\n6. Then, for the third program, we would use the string of B, but note: the third program in the chain would read that string and split by space and get one integer. Then it checks: if the tuple of integers (which has one element) has exactly two 5's? -> false. And sum? The sum is B, which is not 17 (unless B==17, but even then, count of 5 would be 0 or 1). So it will always output \"NO\".\n\nSo we can skip the third program's logic and just output \"NO\"?\n\nBut the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must simulate the third program exactly as it is, but on the input string that is the string of B.\n\nHowever, we can optimize: since the third program will always output \"NO\", we can just output \"NO\". But let's be faithful.\n\nBut note: the third program does:\n\n  ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  if ABC.count(5) == 2:\n      print('YES' if sum(ABC)==17 else 'NO')\n  else:\n      print('NO')\n\nWe are giving it one integer. So:\n\n  tokens = one token (the entire string of B)\n  ABC has one element: B.\n\n  ABC.count(5) is 1 if B==5, else 0. So it will be 2 only if there are two fives, but there's only one number. So it will never be 2.\n\n  Therefore, we can always print \"NO\".\n\nBut to be safe, we can simulate the third program on an array of one integer: [B]. Then we do:\n\n  count = 0;\n  if (B == 5) count++;\n  if (count == 2) ... // which is false\n\n  so we output \"NO\".\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\nBut note: the problem says to not insert any additional I/O. We are only allowed to read at the beginning and write at the end.\n\nSo we can avoid doing any processing for the third program and just print \"NO\".\n\nHowever, to be faithful to the chain, we should simulate the third program exactly. It is very lightweight.\n\nSteps for the entire C program:\n\n  Step 1: Read the first integer n.\n  Step 2: Read an array of n integers.\n  Step 3: Compute A (as in the first program).\n  Step 4: Convert A to a string S (without any newline, just the digits).\n  Step 5: Using the string S, run the second program's DP to compute B.\n  Step 6: Now, for the third program, we have one integer B. We form an array of one integer: [B].\n  Step 7: Check: if the array has exactly two 5's? -> no. Then output \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the third program in the example also does:\n  if ABC.count(5)==2 and then checks the sum.\n\n  But we know the array has only one element, so we can skip and just output \"NO\".\n\nHowever, let's write it for clarity.\n\nBut the third program expects three integers. We are giving it one. So we form an array of one integer: B.\n\n  count = 0;\n  if (B == 5) count = 1;\n  if (count == 2) ... // false -> else branch.\n\nSo we output \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the third program in the example does not read three integers necessarily; it reads one line and splits. The number of integers is the number of tokens in that line. We are giving it one token, so one integer.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  int ABC[1] = {B};\n  int count = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {\n      if (ABC[i] == 5) count++;\n  }\n  if (count == 2) {\n      int total = 0;\n      for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) total += ABC[i];\n      if (total == 17) {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n  } else {\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n  }\n\nBut since count will be either 0 or 1, we can just print \"NO\".\n\nSo the C program will have:\n\n  // Step 1: Read n and the array\n  // Step 2: Compute A\n  // Step 3: Convert A to a string S\n  // Step 4: Using S, compute B (with the DP for modulo 13)\n  // Step 5: Prepare an array for the third program of one integer: B\n  // Step 6: Check the array: has exactly two 5's? -> no, so print \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the second program uses modulo arithmetic with mod = 10**9+7. We must do the same.\n\nLet's write the C program accordingly.\n\nWe will assume the input for the first program is provided in two lines.\n\nExample: \n  First line: 1\n  Second line: 15\n\nWe'll read with scanf.\n\nSteps:\n\n  int n;\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  int arr[n];\n  for (int i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\n  Then compute A:\n\n  if (arr[0] > 15) {\n      A = 15;\n  } else {\n      int found = 0;\n      for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n          if (arr[i] - arr[i-1] > 15) {\n              A = arr[i-1] + 15;\n              found = 1;\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n      if (!found) {\n          if (arr[n-1] == 90 || arr[n-1] + 15 >= 90) {\n              A = 90;\n          } else {\n              A = arr[n-1] + 15;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\n  Then convert A to a string. We'll use sprintf.\n\n  char S[100]; // we assume A is at most 90, so 2 or 3 digits. But to be safe, 20 is enough.\n  sprintf(S, \"%d\", A);\n  int len = strlen(S);\n\n  Then run the second program's DP:\n\n  We'll have dp[len][13] (but we can do a 1D dp to save space).\n\n  mod = 1000000007\n\n  Initialize dp[0..12] for the first character.\n\n  Then for each character in S (from index 0 to len-1):\n      if the char is not '?' then d = char - '0'\n          for each remainder k in 0..12:\n              new_rem = (k * 10 + d) % 13\n              then new_dp[new_rem] = (new_dp[new_rem] + dp_old[k]) % mod\n      else\n          for each digit d from 0 to 9:\n              for each remainder k in 0..12:\n                  new_rem = (k * 10 + d) % 13\n                  new_dp[new_rem] = (new_dp[new_rem] + dp_old[k]) % mod\n\n  Then B = dp[5] (at the last character).\n\n  Then we form an array of one integer: B.\n\n  Then we check: \n      count = 0\n      if (B == 5) count++;\n      if (count == 2) { // false\n          ... \n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\nBut note: the third program expects three integers, but we are giving it one. So we are simulating it on one integer.\n\nHowever, the third program in the example is written for three integers, but if we give it one, it will work as above.\n\nBut we know the answer is always \"NO\", so we can just do:\n\n  printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\nBut to be safe and follow the logic, we'll simulate.\n\nHowever, note: the third program might have a different behavior if we gave it three integers, but we are not. We are giving it one.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  int count = 0;\n  if (B == 5) count++;\n  if (count == 2) { \n      // This is impossible, but still we check\n      int total = B; // only one number\n      if (total == 17) {\n          printf(\"YES\\n\");\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n  } else {\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n  }\n\nBut since count is at most 1, we can skip the if (count==2) and just print \"NO\".\n\nBut to be exact, we do as above.\n\nNow, we must be cautious: the second program's string S is the string representation of A. There are no '?' in it. So we don't have to handle '?' in the second program? \n\nBut the second program's code handles '?'. However, in our case, the string is composed of digits. So we only use the branch for digits.\n\nBut the code in the second program for digits is:\n\n  if S[i] != '?':\n      d = int(S[i])\n      for each k: update dp for new_rem = (k*10+d) % 13\n\nSo we can skip the '?' branch.\n\nSo the second program's part in C:\n\n  long long dp[13] = {0}; // for current row, 13 remainders\n  // for the first character\n  if (len == 1) {\n      if (S[0]=='5' || S[0]=='?') {\n          // but our string is digits, so if it's '5' then we set dp[5]=1, else if it's not 5 then dp[?] doesn't apply -> so we do the digit branch\n      }\n  }\n\n  Actually, we don't need the special case for len==1 because we are going to do a loop for i in [0, len-1]. And at i=0, we do the same.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      dp_new[13] for the next row? But we can do a temporary array.\n\n  However, we can do:\n\n      long long next_dp[13] = {0};\n\n      for each k in 0..12:\n          if dp[k] is not zero (or we can iterate regardless) then:\n              if the current char is a digit (which it is) then d = S[i]-'0'\n                  rem = (k*10 + d) % 13;\n                  next_dp[rem] = (next_dp[rem] + dp[k]) % mod;\n\n      then set dp = next_dp.\n\n  But we start with the first char. How to initialize?\n\n      For i=0:\n          We start with k=0? But the state is: we have an empty number? Actually, the state for the DP is the remainder so far.\n\n      However, the original program initializes:\n          if i==0:\n              if not '?' then set dp[int(S[0])] = 1\n              else for each j in 0..9: dp[j] = 1\n\n      But note: the state is the remainder modulo 13. For the first digit d, the remainder is d.\n\n      So we can initialize:\n          for the first character:\n              if it's a digit, then we set dp[d] = 1.\n\n      But our string is digits, so we do:\n          d0 = S[0]-'0';\n          dp[d0] = 1;\n\n      Then for i from 1 to len-1:\n          next_dp = {0}\n          for k in 0..12:\n             for each digit d? but we don't have '?' -> so only one digit: d = S[i]-'0'\n                 new_rem = (k*10 + d) % 13;\n                 next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % mod;\n\n          then dp = next_dp.\n\n  But note: the original program for the second program does not break the string into digits and then do the DP? It does:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          if i==0:\n             ...\n          else:\n             for k in range(13):\n                 dp[i][ (k*10 + d) % 13 ] += dp[i-1][k]\n\n  So we are doing the same.\n\n  However, note: the original program does modulo at every step.\n\n  We must do modulo.\n\n  Then at the end, B = dp[5] (for the last character) modulo mod.\n\nNow, we are ready to code.\n\nBut note: the first program might output 0? Then the string S is \"0\". Then we do:\n\n  len = 1.\n  dp[0] = 1? because the first digit is 0 -> so we set dp[0] = 1.\n\n  Then B = dp[5] at the last step = 0.\n\nBut the original program for the second program: \n  if n==1: \n      if S=='5' or '?' then print(1) if it is 5, else if it is '0' then print(0).\n\n  So for \"0\": \n      if n==1 -> true, then if S=='5'? no, so print(0).\n\n  So we are consistent.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Read n and array -> compute A.\n  Convert A to string -> S.\n  len = strlen(S)\n  if (len == 0) -> then B=0? but the second program would do nothing? but A is at least 15? not necessarily: if the array has one element 0, then A = 0+15 = 15, so string \"15\", so len>=1.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      long long dp[13] = {0};\n      // for the first character\n      int d0 = S[0] - '0';\n      dp[d0] = 1;\n\n      for (int i=1; i<len; i++) {\n          long long next_dp[13] = {0};\n          int d = S[i] - '0';\n          for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n              if (dp[k]) {\n                  int new_rem = (k*10 + d) % 13;\n                  next_dp[new_rem] = (next_dp[new_rem] + dp[k]) % mod;\n              }\n          }\n          // copy next_dp to dp\n          for (int k=0; k<13; k++) {\n              dp[k] = next_dp[k];\n          }\n      }\n\n      B = dp[5] % mod;\n\n  Then for the third program:\n\n      int ABC[1] = {B}; // but B might be modulo mod, but it's an integer, and we only care if it is 5? and then count it.\n\n      int count = 0;\n      for (int i=0; i<1; i++) {\n          if (ABC[i] == 5) count++;\n      }\n      if (count == 2) {\n          int total = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<1; i++) total += ABC[i];\n          if (total == 17) {\n              printf(\"YES\\n\");\n          } else {\n              printf(\"NO\\n\");\n          }\n      } else {\n          printf(\"NO\\n\");\n      }\n\nBut note: the third program does not require the array to be of size 3. It reads one line and splits, so the array can be of any size. We are giving one integer, so the array is of size 1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the third program is as given. So we must simulate with one integer.\n\nBut note: the third program in the example code is:\n\n  ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  if ABC.count(5) == 2:\n      print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')\n  else:\n      print('NO')\n\n  So for an array of one element, we do:\n\n      count = ABC.count(5)  -> 1 if the element is 5, else 0.\n\n      which is not 2 -> so we print 'NO'.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip the condition and just print \"NO\".\n\n  But to be safe, we do the condition.\n\nHowever, we can optimize: if B is not 5, then count=0 -> print \"NO\".\n  if B is 5, then count=1 -> print \"NO\".\n\n  So always \"NO\".\n\n  So we can just do:\n\n      printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n  But to be faithful, we do the condition.\n\nBut note: the third program might be run on more than one integer in the original standalone? but in the chain, it is run on one integer.\n\nWe are simulating the chain.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nWe must be cautious: the second program uses mod = 10**9+7. We do modulo 1000000007.\n\nBut note: the third program uses the integer B without modulo? Yes, because we stored B as an integer (mod mod) but mod is 10**9+7, and B is in the range [0, 10**9+6]. The third program only checks if B is 5 and then the sum (which is just B) is 17? But 5 != 17, so even if B is 5, then the condition for the third program is:\n\n  count==1 (so not 2) -> so we output \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, we can skip the condition for the third program and just output \"NO\".\n\nBut for clarity, we'll do the condition.\n\nHowever, to save time, we can skip the condition and output \"NO\".\n\nBut let's write the entire C program accordingly.\n\nWe'll use dynamic allocation for the array in the first program if n is large.\n\nBut the problem does not specify constraints for the first program. We'll assume n can be up to 100000? The first program does a loop of n-1, so we must be efficient.\n\nBut the second program: the length of the string S is at most 20 (because A is at most 90+15=105, so 3 or 4 digits). So the DP is 13*20 -> 260 states, which is fine.\n\nLet's code accordingly.\n\nNote: the first program might break early in the for loop. So we break as in the Python.\n\nWe'll write the C program.\n\nEdge: if n==0? The Python program would crash. But the problem says the first program reads n and then n integers. So n>=1.\n\nBut to be safe, we assume n>=1.\n\nWe'll now write the C code."
