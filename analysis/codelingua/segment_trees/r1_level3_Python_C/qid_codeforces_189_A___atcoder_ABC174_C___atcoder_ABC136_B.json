But the original first program: if no candidate is found, it prints 0. Then the second program reads 0 and outputs -1. Then the third program reads -1 and outputs 0. So the entire chain: input -> first program:0 -> second program:-1 -> third program:0 -> output 0. We output 0. Let's test with a known example:\n\n      First program: Input: \"5 1 2 3\" \n          n=5, x=1,y=2,z=3. Then 5%1==0 -> so res1 = 5/1=5. Then second program: k=5 -> \n          i=1: t = (0*10+7)%5 = 7%5=2\n          i=2: t = (2*10+7)%5 = 27%5=2\n          i=3: t = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2 -> ... until i=5: t = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2 -> then res2=-1. Then third program: N=-1 -> outputs 0. But wait: the first program: 5%1==0 -> it prints 5. Then the second program: k=5 -> the loop runs 5 times and doesn't find 0? Then prints -1. Then the third program prints 0. However, the second program: Actually, 77777 mod 5? 77777 is divisible by 5? We are doing: \n              t0 = 0\n              i1: t1 = (0*10+7)%5 = 2\n              i2: t2 = (2*10+7)%5 = 27%5=2\n              i3: t3 = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2\n              i4: t4=2\n              i5: t5=2 So it never becomes 0? But note: 7 mod5=2, 77 mod5= (7*10+7) mod5 = (70 mod5=0, +7 mod5=2) -> 2? Actually, we can do:\n\n          t = (t*10+7) mod5 = (t*10 mod5 + 7 mod5) mod5 = (0+2) mod5=2? So indeed, it never becomes 0? But wait: the problem says: \"t = (t % k) * 10 + 7\", then check t % k? But note: in the second program, we do:\n\n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7 Then we check t % k? Actually, we can reduce mod k at every step? But the original: \n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7   -> then we do t % k again? Actually, we don't need to do an extra mod because we are storing t mod k? However, the value t might be huge? So we do:\n\n              t = (t * 10 + 7) % k;\n\n          which is equivalent? And indeed, that's what we did. So for k=5, we never get 0? But 77777 is divisible by 5? Actually, 77777 ends with 7, not 0 or 5 -> so not divisible by 5? So the second program outputs -1.\n\n          Then the entire chain outputs 0. But what if k=1? Then the first step: i=1: t = (0*10+7)%1 = 0 -> then we break and output 1. Then the third program: N=1 -> \n            low=1, then high=10 -> 10>1 -> break the loop. Then we add: if 1>=1 -> 1-1+1=1 -> so res3=1. Then we output 1. So the code is as above.",

Then third program: outputs 0. So the final output is 0. We'll output 0. Another test: \n        First program: \"4 1 2 3\"\n          n=4, x=1 -> 4%1==0 -> res1=4.

Program 2: Input: an integer k (which is res1 from the first program). Steps:\n          t = 0\n          for i in range 1 to k (inclusive):\n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7\n              if t % k == 0: \n                  print(i) and break\n          else: (if loop completes without break) print(-1) We need to compute res2 = either i (the first i that satisfies) or -1. But note: the modulus operations might cause large numbers? However, we are doing mod k at each step? Actually: t = (t % k) * 10 + 7 -> then we do t % k again? We can note that t might be reduced modulo k at every step? Since we are only interested in t mod k. So we can do:\n          t = 0;\n          for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n              t = (t * 10 + 7) % k;\n              if (t == 0) {\n                  res2 = i;\n                  break;\n              }\n          } if (i > k) then res2 = -1;\n\n        However, note the original: t starts at 0, then for i=1: t = (0 % k)*10+7 = 7 -> then mod k? Then check if 7 mod k==0? Only if k divides 7. Then for i=2: t = (7 mod k) * 10 + 7 -> then mod k again. This is equivalent to the above. Program 3:\n\n        Input: an integer N (which is res2 from the second program).

Actually: 10^i - 10^(i-1) = 9 * 10^(i-1) i += 2\n          Then: ans += max(0, N - 10^(i-1) + 1)\n\n        But note: i starts at 1, then becomes 3, 5, ... (odd indices). Actually, the program counts numbers with an odd number of digits? It counts:\n            from 1 to 9: numbers with 1 digit -> 9 numbers? (but 10^1-10^0 = 10-1=9)\n            from 100 to 999: numbers with 3 digits -> 900 numbers? (10^3-10^2=900)\n            then if N is for example 1050: \n                i=1: 10^1=10 <=1050 -> add 9\n                i=3: 1000<=1050? yes -> add 900\n                i=5: 100000>1050 -> break. Then add: N - 10^(i-1) + 1 = 1050 - 10000? -> negative -> so max(0,...)=0? That doesn't seem right. Actually, the program does:\n\n          i=1: 10^1=10 <= N -> ans += (10^1 - 10^0) = 9\n          i=3: 10^3=1000 <= 1050 -> ans += 900\n          i=5: 10^5=100000 >1050 -> break, then add max(0, 1050 - 10^(5-1)+1) = max(0, 1050-10000+1) = 0. But wait, the numbers with 5 digits are from 10000 to 99999, but 1050 is only 4 digits? Actually, the program is designed to count numbers with odd digit lengths.

They are independent programs that read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n The problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Therefore, we must design:\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (for the first program) and run the first program's logic, which produces an integer output.\n   Step 2: Use that integer as the input for the second program, which produces another integer output (or -1).\n   Step 3: Use that integer as the input for the third program, which produces the final output.\n\n However, looking at the programs:\n\n   File 1: Reads a line of three integers (and one more integer at the beginning) - actually, it reads four integers? \n        The input is: \"arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\"\n        Then: length = arr[0], and then it sorts arr[1:4] (which are the next three) and uses them.\n\n        Example input: \"10 2 3 4\" -> length=10, and then arr[1:4] = [2,3,4] -> sorted to [2,3,4] (reverse=False so ascending).\n\n        It then prints an integer.\n\n   File 2: Reads an integer k (from stdin). Then does a loop.\n\n   File 3: Reads an integer N (from stdin).

So we must replicate the chain.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll write a C program that:\n      - Reads the initial four integers (n, a, b, c) for the first program.\n      - Computes the result of the first program (let's call it res1).\n      - Then uses res1 as input for the second program (which we simulate without reading again, so we set k = res1).\n      - Computes the result of the second program (res2).\n      - Then uses res2 as input for the third program (N = res2) and computes the final result (res3).\n      - Prints res3.\n\n   We must be cautious: the second program might break early (if it finds an answer) and then we break the loop.\n\n   Steps for each program:\n\n   Program 1 (cutRibbon):\n\n        Input: four integers: n, a, b, c.\n\n        Steps:\n          Sort [a, b, c] in ascending order -> let them be x, y, z (x<=y<=z).\n\n          If n % x == 0, then answer = n / x (and return).\n\n          Else, if the two smallest are equal (x==y), then:\n              We iterate i from 0 to n/z (inclusive) and check: \n                 check = n - i*z\n                 if check>=0 and check % x == 0, then k = check / x, and candidate = k + i -> then we take the max candidate.\n\n          Else (x, y, z are distinct? Actually, we sorted and then if the first two are equal, but note: what if y==z? The condition only checks the first two? \n          Actually, the condition is: if (arr[0] == arr[1]) -> so if the two smallest are equal, regardless of the third.\n\n          Otherwise (if the two smallest are not equal), we do a double loop: i from 0 to n/z, j from 0 to n/y, and check: \n                 check = n - i*z - j*y\n                 if check>=0 and check % x ==0, then k = check/x, candidate = i+j+k -> take the max candidate.\n\n        Then print the candidate.\n\n   However, note: the first program prints the candidate (ans) and returns.\n\n   In C, we'll compute res1.\n\n   Program 2:\n\n        Input: an integer k (which is res1 from the first program).\n\n        Steps:\n          t = 0\n          for i in range 1 to k (inclusive):\n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7\n              if t % k == 0: \n                  print(i) and break\n          else: (if loop completes without break) print(-1)\n\n        We need to compute res2 = either i (the first i that satisfies) or -1.\n\n        But note: the modulus operations might cause large numbers? However, we are doing mod k at each step? \n          Actually: t = (t % k) * 10 + 7 -> then we do t % k again? \n\n        We can note that t might be reduced modulo k at every step? Since we are only interested in t mod k.\n\n        So we can do:\n          t = 0;\n          for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n              t = (t * 10 + 7) % k;\n              if (t == 0) {\n                  res2 = i;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          if (i > k) then res2 = -1;\n\n        However, note the original: t starts at 0, then for i=1: t = (0 % k)*10+7 = 7 -> then mod k? Then check if 7 mod k==0? Only if k divides 7.\n\n        Then for i=2: t = (7 mod k) * 10 + 7 -> then mod k again.\n\n        This is equivalent to the above.\n\n   Program 3:\n\n        Input: an integer N (which is res2 from the second program).\n\n        Steps:\n          ans = 0\n          i = 1\n          while (10^i <= N):   # meaning while 10^i <= N\n              ans += (10^i - 10^(i-1))   # which is 9 * 10^(i-1) for i>=1? Actually: 10^i - 10^(i-1) = 9 * 10^(i-1)\n              i += 2\n          Then: ans += max(0, N - 10^(i-1) + 1)\n\n        But note: i starts at 1, then becomes 3, 5, ... (odd indices).\n\n        Actually, the program counts numbers with an odd number of digits? \n          It counts:\n            from 1 to 9: numbers with 1 digit -> 9 numbers? (but 10^1-10^0 = 10-1=9)\n            from 100 to 999: numbers with 3 digits -> 900 numbers? (10^3-10^2=900)\n            then if N is for example 1050: \n                i=1: 10^1=10 <=1050 -> add 9\n                i=3: 1000<=1050? yes -> add 900\n                i=5: 100000>1050 -> break.\n                Then add: N - 10^(i-1) + 1 = 1050 - 10000? -> negative -> so max(0,...)=0? \n                That doesn't seem right.\n\n        Actually, the program does:\n\n          i=1: 10^1=10 <= N -> ans += (10^1 - 10^0) = 9\n          i=3: 10^3=1000 <= 1050 -> ans += 900\n          i=5: 10^5=100000 >1050 -> break, then add max(0, 1050 - 10^(5-1)+1) = max(0, 1050-10000+1) = 0.\n\n        But wait, the numbers with 5 digits are from 10000 to 99999, but 1050 is only 4 digits? \n\n        Actually, the program is designed to count numbers with odd digit lengths. The last step is for the current odd digit group that is not complete.\n\n        However, note: when i becomes 5, the previous odd index was 3 (so the last complete odd group was 3-digit). Then we are at the next odd group (5-digit) but we break because 10^5>1050. \n        Then the variable i is 5 at the end, and we do: \n            ans += max(0, N - 10**(i-1) + 1)   # 10**(i-1) is 10^4 = 10000.\n\n        But 1050 is less than 10000, so we add 0.\n\n        However, what about the 4-digit numbers? They are even and are not counted? \n\n        The program only counts numbers in odd-digit groups: \n          1-digit: 1 to 9 -> 9\n          3-digit: 100 to 999 -> 900\n          and then if we have a number N that is in 4-digit (like 1050) then we don't count any 4-digit number? \n\n        That matches: the program counts only numbers with an odd number of digits.\n\n        But note: the program starts with i=1 (which is odd) and then i becomes 3, then 5, etc.\n\n        However, the condition: \n            while 10 ** i <= N\n\n        For i=1: 10<=1050 -> add 9 (for 1-digit)\n        For i=3: 1000<=1050 -> add 900 (for 3-digit)\n        Then i becomes 5 -> 10^5=100000>1050 -> break.\n\n        Then we do: \n            ans += max(0, 1050 - 10^4 + 1) = max(0, 1050-10000+1) = 0.\n\n        So total = 909.\n\n        But what if N is 1500? \n            Then the same: 9 + 900 = 909, then add max(0, 1500-10000+1)=0 -> 909.\n\n        What if N is 9999?\n            i=1: 10<=9999 -> add 9\n            i=3: 1000<=9999 -> add 900\n            i=5: 100000<=9999? -> false -> break.\n            then add: max(0, 9999-10000+1) = max(0,0)=0 -> 909.\n\n        What if N is 10000?\n            i=1: 10<=10000 -> add 9\n            i=3: 1000<=10000 -> add 900\n            i=5: 100000<=10000? false -> break.\n            then add: max(0,10000-10000+1)=1 -> total=909+1=910.\n\n        But wait: 10000 has 5 digits? Actually 10000 has 5 digits -> odd? So we should count it? \n        However, the program does: \n            The last group we were going to consider was 5-digit numbers? But we broke at i=5 because 10^5=100000>10000? \n            Then we add the numbers from 10000 (the start of 5-digit) to 10000? which is 1 number.\n\n        So 1-digit: 9, 3-digit:900, 5-digit:1 -> total=910.\n\n        But 5-digit numbers start at 10000 and go to 99999. We broke at i=5 because 10^5=100000>10000? \n        Actually the condition is: 10^i (which is 10^5=100000) <= N? 100000<=10000? false.\n\n        Then we add: N - 10^(i-1) + 1 = 10000 - 10^4 + 1 = 10000-10000+1=1.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        However, note: the third program does not consider negative numbers? \n          The program uses: \n             while (10 ** i <= N) \n          and then: max(0, ...) \n\n          If N is negative, the while condition fails (because 10**i is positive and positive is not <= negative) and then we add 0.\n\n        So for negative N, the third program returns 0.\n\n        But the second program might output -1, which becomes the input for the third program.\n\n        Therefore, if the second program outputs -1, then the third program outputs 0.\n\n        Now, we code accordingly.\n\n   Important: The first program might output 0? Then the second program: k=0? \n        In the second program: \n          k = 0 -> then the loop: for i in range(1, k+1) -> if k=0, then the loop runs from 1 to 0 -> so it doesn't run. Then it prints -1.\n\n        Then the third program: N=-1 -> outputs 0.\n\n        But what if the first program outputs a negative? The first program: \n          The input n is the first integer. The input for the first program is four integers. The first integer (n) is the ribbon length, which is nonnegative? \n          The problem doesn't specify, but typically the ribbon length is positive. However, we must consider the specification.\n\n        The original Python program: \n          It reads four integers. Then uses the first as length, and the next three as the cuts.\n\n        The problem says: \"length\" and then three positive integers? The problem says: \"arr = sorted(arr[1:4])\" and then uses them as divisors? \n\n        But the problem does not specify nonnegative. However, the code does:\n          if (check >=0 and check % arr[0]==0) -> so it requires nonnegative.\n\n        And the input: \"length\" is the first integer. If it is negative, then the condition (length % arr[0]==0) might not hold? \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\" and the same input.\n\n        We assume the input for the first program is as expected: nonnegative.\n\n        However, to be safe, we note that the first program does not handle negative length? It does:\n\n          if (length % arr[0] == 0): ... but if length is negative, modulus in Python is defined such that the result has the same sign as the divisor? \n          But in C, modulus for negative numbers is implementation-defined? Actually, we can avoid negative by the problem context.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. So we assume the input for the first program is nonnegative.\n\n        Similarly, the second program: k is the output of the first program. The first program outputs a nonnegative integer? \n          The first program: \n            If we have a solution, we output a nonnegative integer (the number of pieces). \n            The max(ans, ...) is initialized to 0. So even if no solution is found? \n            Actually, the first program does not have an else for the case when no solution is found? \n\n          The loops: \n            In the case of distinct cuts: we iterate and set ans = max(ans, candidate). \n            But if we never find a candidate? Then ans remains 0? \n\n          However, if we never find a candidate, then the problem? The problem says: we are to maximize the number of pieces? \n          But the problem does not specify that a solution must exist. \n\n          The original Python program: if no candidate is found, it prints 0? \n\n          But wait: the problem says: \"if (length % arr[0] == 0)\" then we print ... and return. Otherwise, we set ans=0 and then run the loops.\n\n          In the loops, if we never find a candidate, then ans remains 0? Then we print 0.\n\n          So the first program outputs a nonnegative integer (could be 0).\n\n        The second program: k is nonnegative? But k could be 0? \n          Then the second program: k=0 -> then the loop runs from i=1 to k (which is 0) -> so no iterations -> then output -1.\n\n        Then the third program: N=-1 -> output 0.\n\n   We code accordingly.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n      Step 1: Read the initial four integers: n, a, b, c.\n\n      Step 2: Compute res1 (first program):\n\n          Sort a, b, c -> let x = min, then ... but we need the three sorted: we sort the three in ascending order.\n\n          Then if (n % x == 0) -> res1 = n / x.\n\n          Else if (x == y) [where y is the next] then:\n             res1 = 0;\n             for (int i = 0; i <= n/z; i++) {\n                 int rem = n - i * z;\n                 if (rem >= 0 && rem % x == 0) {\n                     int pieces = i + (rem / x);\n                     if (pieces > res1) res1 = pieces;\n                 }\n             }\n\n          Else:\n             res1 = 0;\n             for (int i = 0; i <= n/z; i++) {\n                 for (int j = 0; j <= n/y; j++) {\n                     int rem = n - i*z - j*y;\n                     if (rem >=0 && rem % x ==0) {\n                         int pieces = i + j + (rem / x);\n                         if (pieces > res1) res1 = pieces;\n                     }\n                 }\n             }\n\n          But note: the original program sets ans=0 initially. If no solution is found, then 0 is the answer.\n\n      Step 3: k = res1 (for the second program)\n\n          Then for the second program:\n\n          long long t = 0;   // because k might be large? and we do mod, but k is the output of the first program which is at most n (which is the first integer read) and n is at most 4000? The problem doesn't specify, but let's use int for k? \n          Actually, the first program: n is the ribbon length. The constraints? Not specified. We assume k can be up to the maximum integer? \n\n          However, the second program runs a loop from 1 to k. If k is very big, this might be slow. But the problem doesn't specify constraints.\n\n          We must do:\n\n          int res2 = -1;\n          if (k == 0) {\n              // then we break and output -1? Actually, the second program outputs -1 for k=0.\n              res2 = -1;\n          } else {\n              int t = 0;\n              for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n                  t = (t * 10 + 7) % k;\n                  if (t == 0) {\n                      res2 = i;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n              // if we didn't break, then res2 remains -1? but we set it to -1 initially? Actually, we break and set res2, otherwise we leave it as -1?\n              // We don't need to set again because if we break we set res2, and if we don't break we want res2=-1.\n          }\n\n      Step 4: N = res2 (for the third program)\n\n          Then compute the third program:\n\n          long long res3 = 0;   // because numbers can be large? \n          if (N < 0) {\n              res3 = 0;\n          } else {\n              long long power = 1; // 10^0\n              int i = 1; // we'll use i as the exponent, starting at 1, then 3, 5, ...\n              // We need to compute 10^i and 10^(i-1) without floating point?

Then k=0 -> res2=-1 -> then the third program outputs 0.\n\n   But what if the first program outputs 0? \n        That happens if no candidate is found? Then the second program outputs -1, then the third outputs 0.\n\n   But the original first program: if no candidate is found, it prints 0. Then the second program reads 0 and outputs -1. Then the third program reads -1 and outputs 0.\n\n   So the entire chain: input -> first program:0 -> second program:-1 -> third program:0 -> output 0.\n\n   We output 0.\n\n   Let's test with a known example:\n\n      First program: \n          Input: \"5 1 2 3\" \n          n=5, x=1,y=2,z=3.\n          Then 5%1==0 -> so res1 = 5/1=5.\n\n      Then second program: k=5 -> \n          i=1: t = (0*10+7)%5 = 7%5=2\n          i=2: t = (2*10+7)%5 = 27%5=2\n          i=3: t = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2 -> ... until i=5: t = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2 -> then res2=-1.\n\n      Then third program: N=-1 -> outputs 0.\n\n      But wait: the first program: 5%1==0 -> it prints 5. Then the second program: k=5 -> the loop runs 5 times and doesn't find 0? Then prints -1. Then the third program prints 0.\n\n      However, the second program: \n          Actually, 77777 mod 5? 77777 is divisible by 5? \n          We are doing: \n              t0 = 0\n              i1: t1 = (0*10+7)%5 = 2\n              i2: t2 = (2*10+7)%5 = 27%5=2\n              i3: t3 = (2*10+7)%5=27%5=2\n              i4: t4=2\n              i5: t5=2\n\n          So it never becomes 0? \n\n          But note: 7 mod5=2, 77 mod5= (7*10+7) mod5 = (70 mod5=0, +7 mod5=2) -> 2? \n          Actually, we can do:\n\n          t = (t*10+7) mod5 = (t*10 mod5 + 7 mod5) mod5 = (0+2) mod5=2? \n\n          So indeed, it never becomes 0? \n\n          But wait: the problem says: \"t = (t % k) * 10 + 7\", then check t % k? \n          But note: in the second program, we do:\n\n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7\n\n          Then we check t % k? \n\n          Actually, we can reduce mod k at every step? \n\n          But the original: \n              t = (t % k) * 10 + 7   -> then we do t % k again? \n\n          Actually, we don't need to do an extra mod because we are storing t mod k? \n\n          However, the value t might be huge? So we do:\n\n              t = (t * 10 + 7) % k;\n\n          which is equivalent? \n\n          And indeed, that's what we did.\n\n          So for k=5, we never get 0? \n\n          But 77777 is divisible by 5? Actually, 77777 ends with 7, not 0 or 5 -> so not divisible by 5? \n\n          So the second program outputs -1.\n\n          Then the entire chain outputs 0.\n\n   But what if k=1? \n        Then the first step: i=1: t = (0*10+7)%1 = 0 -> then we break and output 1.\n\n        Then the third program: N=1 -> \n            low=1, then high=10 -> 10>1 -> break the loop.\n            Then we add: if 1>=1 -> 1-1+1=1 -> so res3=1.\n\n        Then we output 1.\n\n   So the code is as above.\n\n   However, note: the second program in Python uses an integer t that can become very big? But we are using modulus so it's safe.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Let me test the first program with \"5 1 2 3\": \n        n=5, x=1 -> 5%1==0 -> res1=5.\n\n   Then second program: k=5 -> outputs -1? \n\n   Then third program: outputs 0.\n\n   So the final output is 0.\n\n   We'll output 0.\n\n   Another test: \n        First program: \"4 1 2 3\"\n          n=4, x=1 -> 4%1==0 -> res1=4.\n\n        Then second program: k=4 -> \n            i=1: t = (0*10+7)%4=7%4=3\n            i=2: t=(3*10+7)%4=37%4=1\n            i=3: t=(1*10+7)%4=17%4=1\n            i=4: t= (1*10+7)%4=17%4=1 -> then res2=-1.\n\n        Then third program: outputs 0.\n\n   But what if k=7? \n        i=1: t= (0*10+7)%7=0 -> break, res2=1.\n        Then third program: N=1 -> \n            low=1, high=10 -> break -> then add: 1-1+1=1 -> output 1.\n\n   So the chain: input \"7 1 2 3\" -> first program: 7%1==0 -> res1=7 -> second program: k=7 -> outputs 1 -> third program: outputs 1.\n\n   But wait: the first program: the input \"7 1 2 3\" -> n=7, and the cuts are 1,2,3. Then it uses the smallest (1) and 7%1==0 -> so 7/1=7.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the first program might not use the modulus of the smallest? It uses the smallest to check? But the problem: we can use any combination? \n\n   The first program: \n        It checks if the entire length can be divided by the smallest? Then it returns that.\n\n        But what if we can get more pieces by using a combination? \n          Example: n=5, cuts=[1,2,3]: \n             5%1==0 -> so it returns 5? \n             But we can also do: 1 piece of 3 and 1 piece of 2 -> total 2 pieces? which is better? \n\n          However, 5/1=5 pieces? 5 pieces of 1. That is 5 pieces -> which is more than 2? \n\n          But the problem: we want to maximize the number of pieces? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"maximize the number of pieces\" -> so we want as many as possible? \n\n          So 5 pieces is better than 2? \n\n          But wait: the problem statement is not provided. We are only given the code.\n\n          The code: \n            if (length % arr[0] == 0):\n                print(int(length / arr[0]))\n                return\n\n          Then it sets ans=0 and then does the loops and then prints ans.\n\n          So in the case of 5, it would return 5? \n\n          But the example above: 5=1+1+1+1+1 -> 5 pieces -> but we can also do 5=2+3 -> 2 pieces -> and 5 pieces is more than 2? \n\n          However, the problem might ask for the maximum number of pieces? Then 5 is the maximum.\n\n          So the code is correct.\n\n   But note: what if the ribbon is 5 and cuts=[2,3,4]? \n        Then the smallest is 2 -> 5%2 !=0 -> then we do the double loop.\n\n        Then we try:\n            i (number of 4): from 0 to 1 -> \n                i=0: j (number of 3) from 0 to 1 -> \n                    j=0: rem=5 -> 5%2 !=0 -> skip.\n                    j=1: rem=5-3=2 -> 2%2==0 -> pieces=0+1+ (2/2)=0+1+1=2.\n                i=1: rem=5-4=1 -> 1%2 !=0 -> skip.\n\n            so ans = max(0,2)=2.\n\n        Then the first program outputs 2.\n\n        Then second program: k=2 -> \n            i=1: t=7%2=1\n            i=2: t=(1*10+7)%2=17%2=1 -> then res2=-1.\n\n        Then third program: outputs 0.\n\n   But the expected chain: first program outputs 2, second program outputs -1, third program outputs 0.\n\n   So we output 0.\n\n   However, the example: 5=3+2 -> 2 pieces -> that is the maximum? \n\n   But note: we can also do: 2+3 -> same. And we cannot do more than 2? \n\n   So 2 is the maximum.\n\n   Therefore, the chain is implemented as above.\n\n   We write the C code accordingly.\n\n   One more note: the first program might have a bug? \n\n        The condition: \n            if (arr[0] == arr[1]): \n                ... \n            else: \n                ... \n\n        But what if the two largest are equal? The condition only checks the first two? \n\n        Actually, we sorted the array: \n            [x,y,z] in ascending order.\n\n            Then the condition checks if the two smallest are equal? \n\n            What if the two largest are equal? Then we go to the else branch? \n\n        Example: [1,2,2] -> sorted -> [1,2,2] -> then x=1, y=2, z=2 -> then x != y -> so we do the double loop.\n\n        But we can optimize: if the two largest are equal, we don't need to do a double loop? \n\n        However, the original program does not optimize for that.\n\n        So we do the double loop in that case.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   Final code:\n\n      We include the sort function for three numbers.\n\n      We assume the input integers are nonnegative.\n\n      We use long long for the third program because the numbers might be large? The second program: k can be up to 10^9? \n          Actually, the first program: n is the input, which might be up to 4000? Then k is at most 4000? \n\n          Then the second program: k<=4000 -> so the loop runs at most 4000 times -> acceptable.\n\n      The third program: the input N is the output of the second program, which is at most k (if positive) or -1. Since k<=4000, then N<=4000. \n          So we don't need long long for the entire range? But we use long long to be safe for the powers? \n          The powers: 10^1, 10^2, ... until 10^something > N (which is at most 4000) -> so the maximum power we compute is 10^4=10000, which is within long.\n\n      But we use long long to match the type for the third program.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the third program: if N is 0? \n        Then we break the while loop immediately, and then check: if 0>=low (which is 1) -> false -> so output 0.\n\n   But the third program in Python: \n        N=0 -> \n          while 10**i <=0: ... -> false -> then add max(0,0-10^(i-1)+1) -> i starts at 1 -> 10^(0)=1 -> 0-1+1=0 -> max(0,0)=0.\n\n        So 0.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   Code:"
