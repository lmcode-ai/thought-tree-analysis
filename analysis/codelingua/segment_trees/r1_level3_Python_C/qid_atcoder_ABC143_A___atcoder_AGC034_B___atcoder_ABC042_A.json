So total = 0. So the second step always outputs 0? Step 3: Then we have y=0. Then we check: We have one integer: 0. How many times does 5 appear? 0 times -> then condition fails -> output \"NO\".",

But note: the third program might be designed to read multiple integers? But we know the input is one token. So we can do:\n\n            int n = 1;   // because we have one token\n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n\n            Then:\n                int count5 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    if (ABC[i] == 5) count5++;\n                }\n                if (count5 == 2) {\n                    int s = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) s += ABC[i];\n                    if (s == 17) {\n                        printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                } But note: the original program does not know n? It splits and then gets a list of tokens. The number of tokens is the number of integers. How do we get n? In the chain, the output of the second program is one integer, so we know n=1. So we can hardcode n=1. However, what if the second program output had been a string with spaces? But we know it doesn't. Therefore, we can do:\n\n        // Step1: read A, B -> compute x = max(0, A-2*B)\n        // Step2: convert x to string s, then transform to t (which is all 'X') and then compute total=0.\n        // Step3: we have one integer: 0 -> then condition fails. But note: what if the second program did not always output 0? Actually, we saw that the transformation of a digit string produces only 'X', so total=0. But what if the first program outputs a string that by chance contains 'B' and then 'C'? For example, if the first program outputs 66? Then the string is \"66\". Then the transformation: \n            first char '6' -> not A or B -> becomes 'X'\n            second char '6' -> becomes 'X'\n\n        So total=0. Therefore, total is always 0. So we can skip the transformation and counting? However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. But we are not doing I/O? We are going to write a C program that:\n\n        reads two integers A and B.\n\n        computes x = max(0, A-2*B)\n\n        then sets total = 0   (because we know the transformation of the string of x will yield all 'X's, so total=0)\n\n        then checks: \n            if (in a list of one integer [0] we have exactly two 5's? -> no) -> then output \"NO\"\n\n    So the program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            int x = A - 2 * B; if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: we know total will be 0\n            int total = 0;\n\n            // Step3: \n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n            int count5 = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {\n                if (ABC[i] == 5) count5++;\n            } if (count5 == 2) {\n                int s = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) s += ABC[i];\n                if (s == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n            } else {\n                printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But note: the third program condition is always false? So we can just print \"NO\".",

But we can optimize: since we know the array has one element and that element is 0, we know count5 is 0, so we can skip the loop? But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We are not doing I/O. \n\n    We'll write the condition as in the original. Alternatively, we can note: the entire chain always outputs \"NO\", so we can write:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But is that the same? For example: if A=5, B=2 -> then x=5-4=1 -> then step2: string \"1\" becomes \"X\", then total=0 -> then step3: [0] -> condition fails -> \"NO\". If A=0, B=0 -> x=0 -> step2: total=0 -> step3: \"NO\". So yes. But what if the first program outputs a negative? Then x=0 -> same. Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\". However, wait: what if the second program did something different? What if the string representation of x contains the substring \"BC\"? Example: if x = 1166? Then the string is \"1166\". The transformation: \n            i=0: '1' -> not A or B -> output 'X', i=1\n            i=1: '1' -> same -> output 'X', i=2\n            i=2: '6' -> same -> output 'X', i=3\n            i=3: '6' -> same -> output 'X'\n\n        So no.\n\n        But note: the string representation of x is digits only? Therefore, the transformation always produces a string of 'X's. So the total is always 0. Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\". We can write the C program as:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But is that correct? The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". The original chain:\n\n            File1: reads A, B -> outputs x = max(0, A-2*B) as a string. File2: reads that string and outputs 0 as a string. File3: reads the string \"0\", splits to get one integer 0, then checks: \n                    if [0].count(5)==2 -> false -> outputs \"NO\". So the final output is \"NO\". Our C program: reads A, B -> outputs \"NO\". So the output is the same.",

We can test with a few values. Example: A=5, B=2 -> x = 5-4=1. s = \"1\"\n        t = \"X\" -> total = 0. Then ABC = [0] -> count5=0 -> output \"NO\". Example: A=10, B=3 -> x=10-6=4 -> s=\"4\" -> t=\"X\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\". Example: A=0, B=0 -> x=0 -> s=\"0\" -> t=\"X\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\". Example: A=100, B=50 -> x=0 -> same. Example: A=1000000, B=1 -> x=1000000-2=999998 -> s=\"999998\" -> t=\"XXXXXX\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\". So it always outputs \"NO\". But what if we try to force a non-zero total? We would need the string s to contain an 'A' and then a 'BC'? But s is a string of digits. How about if x is the ASCII representation of 'A'? But x is an integer. For example, if x = 65 (which is 'A' in ASCII), then the string is \"65\". Then the transformation:\n            first char '6': not 'A' or 'B' -> becomes 'X'\n            second char '5': becomes 'X'\n\n        So total=0. Therefore, we are safe. We'll submit this code. Note: we assume the input integers A and B are within the range of int. We assume the string representation of x does not exceed 20 characters. We'll use buffers of size 21 for s and t.\n\n    We'll compile and run. However, the problem does not require us to run, but to translate. We have translated. Final code:",

Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n            // Step1: \n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: convert x to string\n            char s[21]; // 20 digits and null terminator\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n            int len_s = strlen(s);\n\n            // Build t: \n            char t[21]; // worst-case: same length as s? or shorter? we allocate same length plus one for safety. int t_index = 0;\n            int i = 0;\n            while (i < len_s) {\n                if (s[i] == 'A') {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'A';\n                    i++;\n                } else if (s[i] == 'B') {\n                    if (i+1 < len_s && s[i+1] == 'C') {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'D';\n                        i += 2;\n                    } else {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                        i++;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n            t[t_index] = '\\0'; // null terminate\n\n            // Now count total from t\n            int total = 0;\n            int numA = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < t_index; j++) { if (t[j] == 'X') {\n                    numA = 0;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'A') {\n                    numA++;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'D') {\n                    total += numA;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step3: \n            // The third program: we are going to create an array of integers from the string that would be input? \n            // But we know the input to the third program is the string representation of total? \n            // However, the third program does: \n            //   tokens = input().split()\n            //   ABC = [int(token) for token in tokens]\n            // But we are not going to convert total to string and then back to int?

The second program reads a string (from the first program's output) and processes it:\n    - It transforms the string: \n        'A' -> 'A'\n        'BC' -> 'D' (and skip next char)\n        otherwise (including 'B' without following 'C', and any other char) -> 'X'\n    - Then it counts the number of 'A's that are immediately followed by a 'D' (with consecutive 'A's allowed, then a 'D').\n      Actually, the counting part: \n        total = 0\n        numA = 0\n        for each char in the transformed string:\n          if char is 'X': reset numA to 0.\n          if char is 'A': increment numA.\n          if char is 'D': then add numA to total (and do not reset numA, because the same A's can be used for subsequent D's? \n          But note: after a D, we don't reset numA. However, the example: \n          \"AAD\" -> \n            first two are 'A': numA becomes 2.\n            then 'D': total += 2, and then numA remains 2? \n          But the problem is: the transformed string doesn't have consecutive A's and then a D? \n          However, note that the transformation does not produce consecutive A's and then a D? Actually, it can: \n          Example: \"AABCA\" -> \n            \"A\" -> A -> then \"BC\" becomes D -> then \"A\" becomes A -> so the transformed string is \"ADA\".\n          Then in the transformed string:\n            first char 'A': numA=1\n            then 'D': total += 1 -> total=1, and numA remains 1?\n            then 'A': numA=2\n          Then the total is 1.\n\n          But the problem says: we are counting the pairs? Actually, the problem is: every time we see a D, we add the current count of consecutive A's (which might be accumulated from before) and then we don't reset the A's? \n          However, note that after a D, we can have more A's and then a D? \n\n          Example: \"ABCABC\" -> becomes \"DD\". Then the transformed string is \"DD\".\n          How do we count?\n            Start: numA=0\n            First char: 'D' -> then we add numA (which is 0) -> total=0, then we don't reset numA? \n          Then next: 'D' -> then we add numA (still 0) -> total=0.\n\n          But if we have \"AABC\": becomes \"AD\", then:\n            A: numA=1\n            then BC becomes D: then we add 1 -> total=1.\n\n          However, if we have \"AAABC\": becomes \"AAD\" -> \n            first A: numA=1\n            second A: numA=2\n            then BC becomes D: then we add 2 -> total=2.\n\n          Also note: after a D, the consecutive A's are still there? Actually, no: because the D is in the middle. \n          But the example \"ABCABC\" is two separate BC's? Then the transformed string is \"DD\". \n          However, we don't have any A's in the transformed string? So the count is 0.\n\n          Now, what if we have \"AABCBC\": \n            Original: \"AABCBC\" -> \n                first two: \"A\" -> then \"BC\" becomes D -> then \"BC\" becomes D -> so \"ADD\".\n            Then:\n                A: numA=1\n                D: total +=1 -> total=1, then numA remains 1? \n                Then next D: total +=1 -> total=2.\n\n          But wait: the transformation does not reset the A's after a D? Actually, the transformation doesn't care about that. The counting algorithm:\n            We traverse the transformed string and:\n              - On 'X': reset numA to 0 (because we break the sequence of A's that can lead to a D?).\n              - On 'A': we just increment numA.\n              - On 'D': we add the current numA to total (and importantly, we do not reset numA?).\n\n          However, note that after a D, we might have more A's? But the transformed string does not have any B or C? \n          Actually, the transformed string only contains 'A', 'D', and 'X'. \n\n          Important: the problem does not reset the consecutive A's after a D? So the A's that come before a D are still counted for the next D? \n          Example: \"AABCABC\" -> transformed: \"ADD\"\n            Step: \n              'A': numA=1\n              'D': total=1, numA remains 1? \n              Then next 'D': total=1+1=2? \n\n          However, the example in the problem: \n            The sample input \"ABCAC\" in the original problem? Actually, we don't have sample. But note the problem.\n\n          But the problem says: \n            \"for i in range(len(t)):\n                if t[i] == \"X\":\n                    numA = 0\n                else:\n                    if t[i] == \"A\":\n                        numA += 1\n                    else:   # which is D\n                        total += numA\"\n\n          So indeed, after a D, we don't reset numA. So the A's that were accumulated remain for the next D? \n\n          However, what if there is an X? Then we reset.\n\n          So the second program prints the total.\n\n 3. The third program reads three integers (which are the output of the second program? Actually, wait: the second program prints an integer (the total). \n    But the third program expects a tuple of three integers? \n\n    However, note the chain: \n        First program: prints one integer (say, x)\n        Second program: reads that integer as a string? \n\n        But wait: the second program does `s = input()`. The input to the second program is the output of the first program, which is an integer printed as a string (without any extra spaces?).\n\n        Then the second program processes that string and prints an integer (the total). \n\n        Then the third program: `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` \n            This expects a string that can be split into three integers? \n\n        But the output of the second program is a single integer (printed as a string). \n\n        This is a problem: the third program expects three integers. \n\n    However, let's look at the entire chain:\n\n        Input to the first program: two integers (e.g., \"5 10\")\n        First program: outputs an integer (e.g., 5 - 2*10 = -15 -> then 0, so prints \"0\")\n        Second program: reads the string \"0\", then transforms:\n            s = \"0\" -> which is not containing 'A' or 'B', so every char becomes 'X'. Then total = 0 -> prints \"0\"\n        Third program: reads the string \"0\", then split -> gives one integer? But it expects three.\n\n    This indicates that the chain might not be designed correctly? But note the problem statement: \n        \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n    The first program: input \"5 10\", output \"0\"\n    The second program: input \"0\", output \"0\"\n    The third program: input \"0\" -> then tries to split and get three integers? -> fails.\n\n    Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the entire chain is run on the original input? \n    But note: the first program reads two integers, the second reads a string (which is the output of the first, which is an integer), and the third reads three integers (which is the output of the second, which is an integer).\n\n    This does not match.\n\n    Let me reexamine the problem: \n        \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\"\n\n    The example chain:\n\n        Input to the entire chain: the input to the first program.\n\n        Step1: reads two integers -> produces one integer as output.\n\n        Step2: reads the one integer (as a string) and processes it -> produces one integer as output.\n\n        Step3: reads the one integer (as a string) and expects to split it into three integers? \n\n    This is inconsistent.\n\n    However, note the third program: \n        `ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`\n\n        If the input to the third program is a string that is a single integer, then split() returns a list of one string? \n        Then map(int, ...) would try to convert that one string to an integer? But then the tuple would have one element.\n\n        Then the condition: \n            if ABC.count(5) == 2:   # how can one element have two 5's? \n\n        So the third program expects three integers. \n\n    How can the second program output three integers? It doesn't. It outputs one integer.\n\n    This suggests that the chain might be broken. \n\n    But wait: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". \n\n    We must note that the second program is not just the `solve` function? It also has the `if __name__ == '__main__':` which calls `solve` and then returns 0. But the output of the second program is the print(total) in solve.\n\n    So the output of the second program is one integer. \n\n    The third program expects three integers. \n\n    This is a problem. \n\n    However, looking at the provided Python programs, the third program is:\n\n        ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n        if ABC.count(5) == 2:\n            print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')\n        else:\n            print('NO')\n\n    This program is designed to read three integers. \n\n    How do we reconcile?\n\n    Let me check the original problem statement: \n        \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n    And the chain:\n\n        Input to the first program: two integers.\n\n        First program: output one integer.\n\n        Second program: that one integer becomes a string (say, \"123\") and then the second program does a transformation on the string and then counts something? \n\n        But note: the second program was designed to process a string of letters? But we are giving it a string of digits.\n\n    This is a critical issue.\n\n    How did the second program work on digits?\n\n        Example: \n            Input to second program: the string \"123\" (if the first program output 123).\n\n        Then the transformation:\n            We traverse \"123\":\n                '1' -> not 'A' and not 'B' -> becomes 'X'\n                '2' -> same -> becomes 'X'\n                '3' -> becomes 'X'\n\n            Then the transformed string is \"XXX\", so total = 0.\n\n        So the second program would output 0.\n\n        Then the third program: input \"0\", which is split into one integer? -> tuple of one element.\n\n        Then condition: ABC.count(5)==2 -> false, so prints \"NO\".\n\n    But the third program expects three integers? \n\n    This is a mismatch in the chain.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must follow the chain as given.\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain in C:\n\n        Step 1: read two integers (A and B), compute ans = A - 2*B, if negative then 0.\n        Step 2: take that integer (ans) and convert it to a string? Then process that string as described in the second program? \n                and then compute the total (which is an integer).\n        Step 3: take that integer (total) and then use it as input to the third program? But the third program expects three integers.\n\n    How to handle? \n\n        The third program in the chain is going to read the output of the second program, which is one integer. \n\n        The third program does: \n            input_string = ... (which is the string representation of that one integer)\n            split -> gives one token? \n\n        Then we have a tuple of one integer? \n\n        Then ABC.count(5) -> if the integer is 5, then count=1, not 2 -> so it prints \"NO\".\n\n        But if the integer is 5, then count(5) is 1, so condition fails.\n\n        Only if the input string for the third program had exactly two 5's and one other number that sums to 17? But we have only one number.\n\n        So the third program will always print \"NO\", because one integer cannot have two 5's? \n\n        Unless the integer is 55? Then we have two 5's? But note: the tuple has one element: [55]. Then ABC.count(5) counts how many times 5 appears in the tuple? \n            The tuple is (55,). Then 55 != 5, so count(5) is 0.\n\n        So the third program will always print \"NO\".\n\n    Therefore, we can hardcode the third program to always output \"NO\"? \n\n    But wait: what if the output of the second program is a string that has three numbers? \n\n    The problem: the output of the second program is one integer. We are printing that integer as a string without any spaces. \n\n    The third program splits the input string by whitespace. So if we output \"5 5 7\" (for example) then the third program would get three integers.\n\n    But the second program only outputs one integer (without any spaces). \n\n    So the third program will always see one token.\n\n    Therefore, the condition `ABC.count(5)==2` will always be false? Because the tuple has one element, and that element is an integer (say, 123) and we are counting the number of times 5 appears in the tuple? \n        That would be 0, unless the integer is 5? then count=1? \n\n    So the condition is never true.\n\n    Therefore, the third program always prints \"NO\".\n\n    So in the C program, we can skip the condition and always output \"NO\"?\n\n    But wait: what if the output of the second program is a string that, when split, yields three integers? \n\n    How? The second program prints one integer. So the output is a string of digits (possibly with a minus sign?).\n\n    Example: \n        If the second program outputs \"5 5 7\", that would be three tokens? But the second program never outputs a space.\n\n    Therefore, the third program will always get one token? \n\n    So the condition is always false.\n\n    Therefore, we can always output \"NO\" for the third step.\n\n    However, to be faithful, we must write the logic of the third program: \n        Read a line, split into tokens, convert to integers -> we know there will be one token? \n        Then check: if the number of integers that are 5 is exactly 2? -> false.\n        Then output \"NO\".\n\n    But note: the third program does not require three integers? It just splits the input. If the input has three integers, then it will have three. But we know the output of the second program is one integer without spaces.\n\n    However, the problem says: the entire chain. The input to the third program is the output of the second program. And the second program outputs a string of one integer.\n\n    So we can simulate:\n\n        Step 1: read two integers: A, B.\n        Step 2: compute x = (A - 2*B) < 0 ? 0 : (A-2*B). Then we have to process the string representation of x as in the second program? \n        Step 3: then we have a new integer y (the total from step2). Then we must check: \n            if we had three integers (but we only have one: y) then condition fails -> output \"NO\".\n\n    But note: the third program does input().split(), so it will split the string by spaces. The second program outputs a string without spaces? \n\n    Therefore, the third program will read one integer: y.\n\n    Then condition: \n        if the tuple (of one element) has exactly two 5's? -> no, so output \"NO\".\n\n    So we can write:\n\n        int y = ...; // from step2\n        // Now step3: we have one integer y.\n        // We create an array of integers of size 1: [y]\n        // Then: \n        //   count = 0;\n        //   for (int i=0; i<1; i++) {\n        //        if (arr[i] == 5) count++;\n        //   }\n        //   if (count == 2) ... -> this will be false.\n\n    But note: the condition is `ABC.count(5)==2` -> which is false because we have only one element and it's not 5? or if it is 5, then count=1.\n\n    So we can simply output \"NO\".\n\n    However, to be safe, we'll write the logic as in the third program.\n\n    Plan for the C program:\n\n        Step 1: Read two integers: A, B.\n        Step 2: \n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            Then convert x to a string (we'll use sprintf to a buffer) -> let's call this string s.\n\n            Then we transform s to t (as in the second program) but note: the second program was designed for a string of letters? \n            But the input to the second program is a string of digits? \n\n            How does the transformation work on digits?\n                We traverse the string s:\n                    if the current char is 'A'? -> but in a digit string, we won't see 'A'. Similarly, we might see 'B'? \n                Actually, the string is digits and possibly a minus sign? \n\n                Example: if x is 10, then s is \"10\"\n                Then:\n                    i=0: '1' -> not 'A' and not 'B' -> so we output 'X'\n                    i=1: '0' -> same -> 'X'\n\n                Then t = \"XX\"\n\n            Then we count total as:\n                numA = 0;\n                total = 0;\n                for each char in t:\n                    if char == 'X') numA = 0;\n                    else if (char == 'A') numA++;\n                    else if (char == 'D') total += numA;\n\n            But note: in our transformed string, we only have 'X'. So total = 0.\n\n            So the second step always outputs 0? \n\n        Step 3: Then we have y=0. Then we check: \n            We have one integer: 0.\n            How many times does 5 appear? 0 times -> then condition fails -> output \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain for any input (A, B) will output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait: what if the first program outputs a number that, when converted to string, contains the letter 'A'? \n            Actually, the first program outputs an integer. The integer is nonnegative (because if negative we set to 0). \n            The string representation of an integer does not contain letters.\n\n        So the transformation in the second program will always produce a string of 'X's? \n\n        Therefore, the total is always 0.\n\n        Then the third program: input 0 -> then output \"NO\".\n\n        So the entire chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n    However, this seems too simplistic. \n\n    But note: the second program was originally designed for a string of letters? But in the chain, it is being fed a string of digits.\n\n    Therefore, the transformation will never produce an 'A' or a 'D'. \n\n    So the total is always 0.\n\n    Then the third program: input 0 -> then condition fails -> \"NO\".\n\n    So the entire chain: \n        Input: two integers\n        Output: \"NO\"\n\n    But wait: what if the first program outputs a negative? Then we set to 0. So the second program always gets 0? \n\n    However, what if the first program outputs a positive? Then the second program gets a string of digits? which is transformed to all 'X's? -> total=0.\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n    Therefore, we can write:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            // Step1: \n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: \n            // Convert x to a string\n            char s[20]; // enough for an integer\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n            // Now process s to get t? But note: the second program builds a string t, but we don't need to build it explicitly? \n            // Because we know that the transformed string will be all 'X's? \n            // So total = 0? \n\n            // But to be safe, we simulate the transformation and counting? \n            // However, we can note: the string s consists of digits and possibly a minus (if x is negative, but we set to 0 so nonnegative). \n            // Actually, x is nonnegative. So the string is digits only.\n\n            // How does the transformation work? \n            //   For each char in s:\n            //      if char is 'A' -> but it's a digit -> skip.\n            //      if char is 'B': then check if next is 'C'. But in digits, we don't have 'B' or 'C'. \n            //   So every char becomes 'X'\n\n            // Then the counting: \n            //   total = 0;\n            //   numA = 0;\n            //   for each char in the transformed string (which is all 'X'):\n            //        we set numA=0 for every char -> so total remains 0.\n\n            // So we can skip the transformation and set total=0.\n\n            // Step3: \n            //   We have the integer total = 0.\n            //   Now we are to check: \n            //        We have one integer: 0.\n            //        Count how many 5's: none -> condition fails -> output \"NO\".\n\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But the problem says: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain\"\n\n    However, the original chain does:\n\n        Step1: output x (an integer, nonnegative) as a string.\n        Step2: reads that string and does the transformation and counting -> always 0? \n        Step3: reads the string \"0\", then splits to get one integer 0, then checks: \n            ABC.count(5) -> 0, so condition fails -> output \"NO\".\n\n    So the above C program does the same.\n\n    But note: what if the first program outputs a number that in string form contains the letter 'B'? \n        For example, if the integer is 11? Then the string is \"11\", which does not contain 'B'. \n\n    Therefore, we can safely do the above.\n\n    However, to be absolutely faithful, we can simulate the transformation and counting? \n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step1: read A, B -> compute x.\n\n        Step2: \n            Convert x to a string -> s.\n            Build a new string t (we can use a buffer) by scanning s:\n\n            We note: the transformation in the second program:\n\n                i=0;\n                while (i < len(s)) {\n                    if (s[i]=='A') {\n                        t += 'A';\n                        i++;\n                    } else if (s[i]=='B') {\n                        if (i < len(s)-1 && s[i+1]=='C') {\n                            t += 'D';\n                            i += 2;\n                        } else {\n                            t += 'X';\n                            i++;\n                        }\n                    } else {\n                        t += 'X';\n                        i++;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then count total: \n                numA = 0;\n                total = 0;\n                for (each char in t) {\n                    if (c == 'X') numA=0;\n                    else if (c=='A') numA++;\n                    else if (c=='D') total += numA;\n                }\n\n        Step3: \n            We have the integer total (which we know will be 0, but let's compute).\n            Then we pass this integer to the third step? But the third step expects three integers? \n            Actually, the third step reads a line and splits. We are going to output the integer total as a string? \n\n            But note: the entire chain in C is one program. We don't need to output intermediate results as strings and then parse them? \n            We can avoid the string conversion for the third step? \n\n            However, the third step in the original program does: \n                input().split() -> tokens, then convert to integers.\n\n            But we are in C, and we have the integer total. How does the third step use it? \n\n            The third step: \n                tokens = [str(total)]   (if we were to output as string and then split, we get one token: the string of total)\n\n                Then convert to integer: we get total.\n\n                Then the tuple is (total,). \n\n                Then condition: if (tuple has exactly two 5's) ... \n\n            We can do:\n\n                int arr[1] = {total};\n                int count5 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<1; i++) {\n                    if (arr[i] == 5) count5++;\n                }\n                if (count5 == 2) { \n                    int s = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<1; i++) s += arr[i];\n                    if (s == 17) {\n                        printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n\n            But note: the condition `count5==2` will never be true because we have only one element.\n\n            So we can skip the condition and just print \"NO\".\n\n    However, to be safe and generic, we'll simulate the third program exactly:\n\n        We are going to form a string of the output of step2 (the integer total) and then parse it as the third program would.\n\n        But the third program does: \n            tokens = input().split()\n\n        Since the string we output for step2 is the integer without any spaces, then tokens will have one element.\n\n        Then we convert that token to an integer? But the third program converts each token to an integer and then stores in a tuple.\n\n        However, the third program then uses the tuple to check the count of 5 and the sum.\n\n        We can avoid the string conversion? Because we have the integer total already.\n\n        But note: the third program might be designed to read multiple integers? But we know the input is one token.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            int n = 1;   // because we have one token\n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n\n            Then:\n                int count5 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    if (ABC[i] == 5) count5++;\n                }\n                if (count5 == 2) {\n                    int s = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) s += ABC[i];\n                    if (s == 17) {\n                        printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                    } else {\n                        printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n\n        But note: the original program does not know n? It splits and then gets a list of tokens. The number of tokens is the number of integers.\n\n        How do we get n? \n\n        In the chain, the output of the second program is one integer, so we know n=1.\n\n        So we can hardcode n=1.\n\n    However, what if the second program output had been a string with spaces? But we know it doesn't.\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        // Step1: read A, B -> compute x = max(0, A-2*B)\n        // Step2: convert x to string s, then transform to t (which is all 'X') and then compute total=0.\n        // Step3: we have one integer: 0 -> then condition fails.\n\n    But note: what if the second program did not always output 0? \n\n    Actually, we saw that the transformation of a digit string produces only 'X', so total=0.\n\n    But what if the first program outputs a string that by chance contains 'B' and then 'C'? \n\n        For example, if the first program outputs 66? Then the string is \"66\". \n        Then the transformation: \n            first char '6' -> not A or B -> becomes 'X'\n            second char '6' -> becomes 'X'\n\n        So total=0.\n\n    Therefore, total is always 0.\n\n    So we can skip the transformation and counting? \n\n    However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. But we are not doing I/O? \n\n    We are going to write a C program that:\n\n        reads two integers A and B.\n\n        computes x = max(0, A-2*B)\n\n        then sets total = 0   (because we know the transformation of the string of x will yield all 'X's, so total=0)\n\n        then checks: \n            if (in a list of one integer [0] we have exactly two 5's? -> no) -> then output \"NO\"\n\n    So the program:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: we know total will be 0\n            int total = 0;\n\n            // Step3: \n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n            int count5 = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {\n                if (ABC[i] == 5) count5++;\n            }\n            if (count5 == 2) {\n                int s = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) s += ABC[i];\n                if (s == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n            } else {\n                printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But note: the third program condition is always false? So we can just print \"NO\". \n\n    However, to be faithful, we write the condition.\n\n    But we can optimize: since we know the array has one element and that element is 0, we know count5 is 0, so we can skip the loop? \n\n    But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. We are not doing I/O. \n\n    We'll write the condition as in the original.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note: the entire chain always outputs \"NO\", so we can write:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But is that the same? \n\n        For example: if A=5, B=2 -> then x=5-4=1 -> then step2: string \"1\" becomes \"X\", then total=0 -> then step3: [0] -> condition fails -> \"NO\".\n\n        If A=0, B=0 -> x=0 -> step2: total=0 -> step3: \"NO\".\n\n        So yes.\n\n    But what if the first program outputs a negative? Then x=0 -> same.\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n    However, wait: what if the second program did something different? \n\n        What if the string representation of x contains the substring \"BC\"? \n\n        Example: if x = 1166? Then the string is \"1166\". \n        The transformation: \n            i=0: '1' -> not A or B -> output 'X', i=1\n            i=1: '1' -> same -> output 'X', i=2\n            i=2: '6' -> same -> output 'X', i=3\n            i=3: '6' -> same -> output 'X'\n\n        So no.\n\n        But note: the string representation of x is digits only? \n\n        Therefore, the transformation always produces a string of 'X's.\n\n    So the total is always 0.\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"NO\".\n\n    We can write the C program as:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But is that correct? \n\n        The problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n        The original chain:\n\n            File1: reads A, B -> outputs x = max(0, A-2*B) as a string.\n\n            File2: reads that string and outputs 0 as a string.\n\n            File3: reads the string \"0\", splits to get one integer 0, then checks: \n                    if [0].count(5)==2 -> false -> outputs \"NO\".\n\n        So the final output is \"NO\".\n\n        Our C program: reads A, B -> outputs \"NO\".\n\n        So the output is the same.\n\n    However, what if the first program had side effects? \n\n        But we are only doing computation.\n\n    But note: the problem does not specify the range of A and B. \n\n    However, we are not using A and B beyond the initial computation? \n\n    And we are not doing any transformation that might depend on the digits? \n\n    Therefore, we can skip the computation.\n\n    But the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence\". \n\n    We are allowed to optimize? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"without I/O in the middle\", meaning we avoid printing and reading in the middle. \n\n    But if we skip the computation, we are not doing the transformation? \n\n    The problem does not require us to do the transformation if we can prove it is unnecessary? \n\n    But to be safe, we can do the transformation? \n\n    However, we know the transformation will always yield 0. \n\n    So we can write:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n            // Step1: \n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: \n            // Convert x to string\n            char s[20];\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n            // Build t: \n            char t[100]; // we'll build t; the length of t will be at most the length of s (each char becomes one char, except BC becomes one D, so t might be shorter? but we allocate enough)\n            int t_index = 0;\n            int i = 0;\n            int len_s = strlen(s);\n            while (i < len_s) {\n                if (s[i] == 'A') {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'A';\n                    i++;\n                } else if (s[i] == 'B') {\n                    if (i < len_s - 1 && s[i+1] == 'C') {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'D';\n                        i += 2;\n                    } else {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                        i++;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n            t[t_index] = '\\0'; // null terminate\n\n            // Now count total from t\n            int total = 0;\n            int numA = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < t_index; j++) {\n                if (t[j] == 'X') {\n                    numA = 0;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'A') {\n                    numA++;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'D') {\n                    total += numA;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step3: \n            // Now we have total. We are going to form an array of integers: only one integer, which is total.\n            int n = 1;\n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n            int count5 = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                if (ABC[i] == 5) count5++;\n            }\n            if (count5 == 2) {\n                int s = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) s += ABC[i];\n                if (s == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n            } else {\n                printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    But we know that t will be a string of 'X's? So total will be 0.\n\n    This program will always output \"NO\".\n\n    And it does the same steps as the original.\n\n    However, we can avoid the transformation if we want? But the problem says \"translate\", so we should include the transformation.\n\n    But note: the transformation might be expensive? But the numbers are small? \n\n    We'll do the transformation for clarity.\n\n    But note: the string s is the string representation of an integer. The integer is nonnegative and we don't know the range? But the problem doesn't specify. \n\n    We allocated 20 for s -> which is safe for 64-bit integers? \n\n    And t: we allocated 100 -> which is safe.\n\n    We'll write the full transformation.\n\n    However, we can note: the transformation for a digit string will never see 'A', 'B', or 'C'. So we can skip the condition and just fill with 'X'? \n\n    But for clarity and faithfulness, we do the condition.\n\n    Therefore, the final C program:\n\n        Steps:\n          Read A and B.\n          Compute x = max(0, A-2*B)\n          Convert x to a string s.\n          Transform s to t: \n            for each char in s:\n                if char is 'A': append 'A'\n                else if char is 'B': \n                    if next char is 'C', then append 'D' and skip next\n                    else append 'X'\n                else: append 'X'\n          Then compute total from t: \n            numA = 0\n            total = 0\n            for each char in t:\n                if char is 'X': numA=0\n                if char is 'A': numA++\n                if char is 'D': total += numA\n          Then form an array ABC with one element: total.\n          Check: if the number of 5's in ABC is 2? -> then check if the sum is 17? -> output accordingly, else output \"NO\".\n\n        But we know the array has one element, so the condition fails.\n\n    We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n    Note: We must be cautious of the string buffers.\n\n    We'll assume the integer x has at most 20 digits.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int A, B;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n\n            // Step1: \n            int x = A - 2 * B;\n            if (x < 0) x = 0;\n\n            // Step2: convert x to string\n            char s[21]; // 20 digits and null terminator\n            sprintf(s, \"%d\", x);\n            int len_s = strlen(s);\n\n            // Build t: \n            char t[21]; // worst-case: same length as s? or shorter? we allocate same length plus one for safety.\n            int t_index = 0;\n            int i = 0;\n            while (i < len_s) {\n                if (s[i] == 'A') {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'A';\n                    i++;\n                } else if (s[i] == 'B') {\n                    if (i+1 < len_s && s[i+1] == 'C') {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'D';\n                        i += 2;\n                    } else {\n                        t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                        i++;\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    t[t_index++] = 'X';\n                    i++;\n                }\n            }\n            t[t_index] = '\\0'; // null terminate\n\n            // Now count total from t\n            int total = 0;\n            int numA = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < t_index; j++) {\n                if (t[j] == 'X') {\n                    numA = 0;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'A') {\n                    numA++;\n                } else if (t[j] == 'D') {\n                    total += numA;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Step3: \n            // The third program: we are going to create an array of integers from the string that would be input? \n            // But we know the input to the third program is the string representation of total? \n            // However, the third program does: \n            //   tokens = input().split()\n            //   ABC = [int(token) for token in tokens]\n            // But we are not going to convert total to string and then back to int? We have total as an integer.\n            // And the tokens are one token: the string of total? \n            // But the third program then uses the list of integers.\n\n            // We are going to simulate the third program: \n            //   We have one integer: total.\n            //   So the array ABC has one element: total.\n            int count5 = 0;\n            int ABC[1] = {total};\n            for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {\n                if (ABC[i] == 5) {\n                    count5++;\n                }\n            }\n            if (count5 == 2) {\n                int s = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) {\n                    s += ABC[i];\n                }\n                if (s == 17) {\n                    printf(\"YES\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"NO\\n\");\n                }\n            } else {\n                printf(\"NO\\n\");\n            }\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n    This program does the entire chain.\n\n    We can test with a few values.\n\n    Example: A=5, B=2 -> x = 5-4=1.\n        s = \"1\"\n        t = \"X\" -> total = 0.\n        Then ABC = [0] -> count5=0 -> output \"NO\".\n\n    Example: A=10, B=3 -> x=10-6=4 -> s=\"4\" -> t=\"X\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\".\n\n    Example: A=0, B=0 -> x=0 -> s=\"0\" -> t=\"X\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\".\n\n    Example: A=100, B=50 -> x=0 -> same.\n\n    Example: A=1000000, B=1 -> x=1000000-2=999998 -> s=\"999998\" -> t=\"XXXXXX\" -> total=0 -> \"NO\".\n\n    So it always outputs \"NO\".\n\n    But what if we try to force a non-zero total? \n\n        We would need the string s to contain an 'A' and then a 'BC'? But s is a string of digits. \n\n        How about if x is the ASCII representation of 'A'? But x is an integer. \n\n        For example, if x = 65 (which is 'A' in ASCII), then the string is \"65\". \n\n        Then the transformation:\n            first char '6': not 'A' or 'B' -> becomes 'X'\n            second char '5': becomes 'X'\n\n        So total=0.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n    We'll submit this code.\n\n    Note: we assume the input integers A and B are within the range of int.\n\n    We assume the string representation of x does not exceed 20 characters.\n\n    We'll use buffers of size 21 for s and t.\n\n    We'll compile and run.\n\n    However, the problem does not require us to run, but to translate.\n\n    We have translated.\n\n    Final code:"
