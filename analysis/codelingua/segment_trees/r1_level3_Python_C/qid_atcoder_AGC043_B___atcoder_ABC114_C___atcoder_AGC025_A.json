The initial call is \"0\", then \"07\", \"05\", etc. In the function aaa, we do atoi(n) -> which for \"0\" is 0, for \"07\" is 7, for \"05\" is 5, etc. -> that's correct. However, the string might be \"00\"? We are building by appending, so we start with \"0\", then \"07\", then \"077\", etc. -> we never have \"00\" unless we append '0'? but we only append '7','5','3'. So it's safe. But note: the recursion might be heavy? The depth: the first level: \"0\" -> then three calls: \"07\",\"05\",\"03\". The second level: for \"07\": then \"077\",\"075\",\"073\" -> and these numbers are 77,75,73 -> which are >2 (since x<=2) -> so they return 0. So the entire tree has 1 + 3 = 4 nodes. Therefore, it's efficient. Let me test with x=2: \n              aaa(\"0\",2): \n                  current = 0<=2 -> then check: set of digits in \"0\" -> not 753 -> 0.\n                  then call aaa(\"07\",2): 7>2 -> 0.\n                  similarly for \"05\",\"03\": 5>2, 3>2 -> 0.\n                  returns 0. So it's 0. Therefore, the entire chain outputs 0. We'll run the program with the example: n_str = \"1\", and digits = \"0\" (which we did by hand and got 2 for File1, then 0 for File2, then 0 for File3). But in our code, for n_str=\"1\": \n              total = (0*10+1)% (1<<20) = 1.\n              then total = (1-1+MOD)%MOD = 0.\n              nums = [ (0-1) ] = [-1]\n              check for 1: -1 ! = 1 -> so no_one=1. then do division: nums[0] = ( -1 <0 ) -> (-1-1)/2 = -2/2 = -1.\n              then for i=0: \n                  i=0: the while loop: temp_i=0 -> skip -> is_odd_bin=1.\n                  nums[0] = -1 -> which is odd? (-1 & 1) = 1 -> so flip is_odd to 1.\n              then x = 1<<1 = 2. Then File2: aaa(\"0\",2) returns 0. Then File3: \"0\" -> not in the list, sum=0. Output: 0. So it matches. But note: the condition in the binomial coefficient for i=0: \n                C(n-1,0) = 1, which is odd? so the condition is_odd_bin=1 is correct. Therefore, we output 0. However, the problem says: the entire chain must be combined.",

But the higher bits of i are all zeros? so by Lucas' theorem, we only care about the bits in the positions that i has ones? and those are in the low 20 bits. Therefore, this is sufficient. Steps for File1 for the binomial condition for a given i:\n\n                low20 = (n-1) % (1<<20);   // we only care about the low 20 bits. int is_odd_bin = 1;\n                int temp_i = i;\n                int bit_pos = 0;\n                while (temp_i) {\n                    if (temp_i & 1) {\n                        // check if the bit_pos-th bit in low20 is set? if ( !(low20 & (1 << bit_pos)) ) {\n                            is_odd_bin = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    temp_i /= 2;\n                    bit_pos++;\n                }\n\n          But note: the bit positions: the least significant bit is bit0. How to compute (n-1) from the string n_str? We can compute n_minus_one_string by subtracting 1 from the string? Then compute low20 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<len(n_minus_one_string); i++) {\n                    low20 = (low20 * 10 + (n_minus_one_string[i] - '0')) % (1<<20);\n                } However, note: we want (n-1) mod (1<<20), but we can do:\n\n                low20 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<len(n_str); i++) {\n                    low20 = (low20 * 10 + (n_str[i] - '0')) % (1<<20);\n                }\n                // then subtract 1? \n                low20 = (low20 - 1 + (1<<20)) % (1<<20);   // to handle negative? But if n_str is \"1\", then n-1=0 -> low20 = (0-1) = -1 mod 2^20? but we want the two's complement representation? In bitwise: we want the low 20 bits of n-1. We can do: \n                total = 0;\n                for (each char in n_str) { total = (total * 10 + (c-'0')) % (1<<20); }\n                total = (total - 1) % (1<<20); if (total < 0) total += (1<<20);\n\n          Then use this total as an integer with low 20 bits. Then for the binomial condition, we use the bit representation of 'total'. This is efficient: O(len(n_str)) and len(n_str) might be 100000, which is acceptable. Therefore, we change File1:\n\n                Read n_str and the next line (digits). Step1: Compute total = (convert n_str to integer mod (1<<20)) then n_minus_one = (total - 1) mod (1<<20), and if negative, adjust.\n\n                Step2: Build nums array from the string 'digits': \n                        for i in range(len(digits)):\n                            nums[i] = (digits[i] - '0') - 1;\n\n                Step3: Check if 1 is in nums? int no_one = 1;\n                        for (each element in nums) {\n                            if (element == 1) {\n                                no_one = 0;\n                                break;\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                        if (no_one) {\n                            for (each element in nums) { if (element < 0) \n                                    element = (element-1)/2;\n                                else \n                                    element = element/2;\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                Step4: is_odd = 0;\n                        for (int i=0; i<len(nums); i++) {\n                            int is_odd_bin = 1;\n                            int temp_i = i;\n                            int bit_pos = 0;\n                            while (temp_i) {\n                                if (temp_i & 1) {\n                                    if (!(n_minus_one & (1 << bit_pos))) {\n                                        is_odd_bin = 0;\n                                        break;\n                                    }\n                                }\n                                temp_i = temp_i >> 1;\n                                bit_pos++;\n                            } if (is_odd_bin && (nums[i] & 1)) {\n                                is_odd = !is_odd;\n                            }\n                        }\n\n                Step5: x = is_odd ?

However, let's test with a small example for File1:\n\n        Example: n=1, and the string \"0\"\n\n        Then nums = [int('0')-1] = [-1]\n\n        Check: if 1 in [-1]? -> no -> so no_one = True -> then nums = [ -1//2 ] -> which in Python is -1 (because -1//2 = -1 in Python). Then we iterate: i=0, num = -1 (which is odd: because -1 % 2 = 1 in Python? actually, -1 & 1 = 1 -> odd). Now compute: parity_of_nCr(0,0): \n            f(0) = 0 - bin(0).count('1') = 0 - 0 = 0.\n            f(0-0)=f(0)=0, f(0)=0 -> so 0-0-0=0 -> condition 0>0 is false -> returns False. So `not parity_of_nCr(0,0)` is True -> and num is odd -> so flip is_odd to True. Then output: 1 << no_one -> no_one is True -> 1<<1 = 2. So File1 outputs 2. Then File2: called with N=2 -> \n            aaa('0'): \n                int('0')=0<=2 -> then set('0') -> not equal to {'7','5','3'} -> 0. then for each in '753': \n                    aaa('07'): int('07')=7 -> 7>2 -> return 0.\n                    similarly for '05' and '03': 5>2 and 3>2? 3>2 -> true -> so returns 0. so returns 0. Then File3: gets the string \"0\" -> outputs 0. So the chain outputs 0. But what if we had a File2 that would return a non-zero value? Actually, for N>=3, we might get non-zero? However, the output of File1 is at most 2? So we never get N>=3?",

The first program (File1) reads an integer `n` and then a string (a list of digits, each converted to int and then subtracted by 1).\n    Then it does some processing and outputs either 0, 1, or 2 (because `1 << no_one` is either 1 or 2).\n\n 2.

Then it checks if the string is in a predefined list of strings (a = [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"]). \n    If it is, it prints 10; otherwise, it prints the sum of the digits of the string.\n\n How to chain without I/O:\n\n We note:\n - The output of File1 is an integer (0, 1, or 2). But the next program (File2) expects an integer input (N). So the output of File1 becomes the input N for File2.\n\n - The output of File2 is an integer (the count of \"753 numbers\"). Then the next program (File3) reads a string. So we have to convert the integer output of File2 to a string and feed it to File3.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n Therefore, the entire chain would be:\n\n   Input for File1: \n        First integer: n\n        Then a string of digits (without spaces? but note: the input is read as `input().strip()` and then mapped to integers by `int(x)-1`)\n\n   Output of File1: an integer (either 0, 1, or 2) -> becomes the input for File2 as the integer N.\n\n   Output of File2: an integer (the count) -> becomes the input for File3 as a string.\n\n   Output of File3: an integer (either 10 or the digit sum).\n\n But note: the original File1 expects two lines of input. However, the entire chain must read the initial input (for File1) and then produce the final output (of File3).\n\n So the overall input for the entire C program is the same as the input for File1: \n        first line: integer n\n        second line: a string of digits (without spaces)\n\n And the output is the output of File3.\n\n However, there is a problem: the output of File1 is 0, 1, or 2. Then File2 uses that as N. Then File3 uses the output of File2 (an integer) as a string.\n\n How the programs are connected:\n\n   Step1: Run File1 on the initial input (n and the string) -> produces an integer, say x.\n   Step2: Run File2 with input N = x -> produces an integer, say y.\n   Step3: Run File3 with input string = the string representation of y -> produces an integer z.\n\n So the entire program must do:\n   Read the initial n and the string for File1.\n   Process File1 to get x.\n   Then use x as the input for File2 (which is the recursive function aaa) to get y.\n   Then convert y to a string and use that as the input for File3 to get z, which is printed.\n\n However, note that the original File2 program in Python uses recursion and builds numbers as strings. We have to be cautious because the input for File2 (x) is very small (0,1,2). So the recursion depth will be very low.\n\n But let's see:\n\n   If x=0: \n        aaa('0'): \n            int('0') = 0 <= 0 -> so we check set(str(0)) -> set('0') -> not {'3','5','7'} -> 0.\n            then for each in '753': \n                call aaa('0'+i) -> i.e., aaa('07'), aaa('05'), aaa('03')\n            For each of these: \n                '07' -> 7 -> but 7>0 -> return 0? Actually, the condition is: if int(n) > N then return 0. So 7>0 -> return 0.\n            So aaa('0') returns 0.\n\n   Similarly, for x=1: \n        aaa('0'): \n            set('0') != {'3','5','7'} -> 0.\n            then for each i in '753': \n                call aaa('07'): 7>1 -> 0.\n            so returns 0.\n\n   For x=2: \n        same as above: all numbers built will be at least 3,5,7 which are >2 -> 0.\n\n So the output of File2 is always 0? Then File3 would get the string \"0\".\n\n Then File3: \n        n = \"0\"\n        Check if \"0\" is in the list [\"10\",\"100\",...] -> no.\n        Then compute the sum of digits: [0] -> 0 -> output 0.\n\n But wait, the original File1 might output 1 or 2 only in some cases? Let me reexamine File1.\n\n Actually, let me understand File1:\n\n   It reads n and a string of digits (each digit converted to int and then subtracted by 1). Then it checks if 1 is not in the resulting list? \n   But note: the input string is a sequence of digits? For example, the input might be: \n        n: some integer\n        next line: e.g., \"123\"\n\n   Then nums = list(map(lambda x: int(x)-1, \"123\")) -> [0,1,2]\n\n   Then: if 1 not in [0,1,2]? -> 1 is in there -> so no_one = False.\n\n   Then it iterates: \n        for i, num in enumerate([0,1,2]):\n            Check: if not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i) and (num & 1) -> then flip is_odd.\n\n   What is parity_of_nCr? \n        It returns (f(n) - f(n-i) - f(i)) > 0, where f(k) = twos_in_factorial(k) = k - bin(k).count('1')\n\n   Actually, note: the condition `parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` is equivalent to the parity of C(n-1, i) mod 2? \n   But the function returns True when the exponent of 2 in C(n-1, i) is 0? Actually, it returns True when the binomial coefficient is odd? \n   Because by Lucas/Kummer? we know that the exponent of 2 in C(n-1, i) is (f(n-1) - f(n-1-i) - f(i)) and if that exponent is 0 then the binomial coefficient is odd.\n\n   So the condition is: if the binomial coefficient C(n-1, i) is odd (so `not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` means it's even) and the current num is odd, then flip the bit.\n\n   Then at the end, if is_odd is False, output 0; else output 1 << no_one -> which is 1 if no_one is False, and 2 if no_one is True.\n\n   But note: no_one is set to True only if the original list of numbers (after subtracting 1) does not contain 1. How can that happen? \n        The original list is from the input string. Each digit is converted to an integer and then subtracted by 1. So the numbers in the list are in { -1, 0, 1, 2, ... }? \n        Actually, the input digits are from '0' to '9'? Then subtracting 1 gives -1 to 8.\n\n        But note: the condition is `if 1 not in nums`. So if the original string had no digit '2' (because then int('2')-1 = 1) then we set no_one = True and then we divide every number by 2 (integer division?).\n\n        Actually, the code: `nums = [num // 2 for num in nums]` -> note that if the number is negative, integer division by 2 in Python is floor division? But in C we have to be cautious.\n\n        However, the input digits are at least '0', so the smallest number is -1? Then -1//2 in Python is -1? But note: we are only setting no_one to True if 1 is not in the list. \n\n        Example: if the input string is \"00\", then nums = [-1, -1]. Then 1 is not present -> no_one = True -> then nums becomes [ (-1)//2, (-1)//2 ] = [-1, -1]. \n\n        Then we iterate: \n            for i, num in enumerate([-1,-1]): \n                Check: if the binomial coefficient C(n-1, i) is even and num is odd? \n                Note: -1 is odd (because in binary, the least significant bit is 1). \n\n        So we need to compute the binomial coefficient modulo 2 for (n-1, i). \n\n        But note: the binomial coefficient C(n-1, i) mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of i is a subset of the binary representation of n-1 (by Lucas' theorem). \n\n        However, we are using the condition: `not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` -> meaning that we are checking when the binomial coefficient is even? \n\n        The function `parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` returns True when the exponent of 2 is positive (i.e., at least 1) meaning the binomial coefficient is even? \n        So `not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` means the binomial coefficient is odd? \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: if the binomial coefficient is odd and the current num is odd, then flip the bit.\n\n        But wait: the condition is `if not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i) and (num & 1):` -> so if the binomial coefficient is odd (so `not parity_of_nCr` is true when the binomial is odd? because if the exponent is 0 then the condition `f(n-1) - f(n-1-i) - f(i) > 0` is false -> so `not parity_of_nCr` is true when the exponent is 0 -> meaning the binomial is odd) and the number is odd.\n\n        Actually, the function `parity_of_nCr` returns True when the exponent is >0 (i.e., the binomial is even). So `not parity_of_nCr` returns True when the binomial is odd.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: if the binomial coefficient C(n-1, i) is odd and the current number is odd, then flip the bit.\n\n        Then at the end, if the total flip (is_odd) is 0, output 0; else output 1 if no_one is False, or 2 if no_one is True.\n\n   However, note that the input for File2 is the output of File1, which is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n   And as we saw, for 0,1,2 the recursive function aaa returns 0. So the output of File2 is always 0? Then the input to File3 is \"0\", and the output of File3 is 0.\n\n   This does not seem to match the original intention? \n\n   But wait: the original File1 might output 0,1,2 only in very specific cases? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\". So we have to code exactly as given.\n\n   However, we note that the entire chain is:\n\n        File1: (input: n and a string of digits) -> output: 0,1, or 2.\n        File2: (input: the output of File1) -> output: 0 (as we saw for 0,1,2) -> so always 0.\n        File3: (input: \"0\") -> output: 0 (because the string \"0\" is not in the list [\"10\",\"100\",...] and the sum of digits is 0).\n\n   So the entire program always outputs 0? \n\n   But that cannot be: the original File1 might output 1 or 2 in some cases? But then File2 uses that 1 or 2 as N and returns 0? and then File3 returns 0.\n\n   So the final output is always 0? \n\n   However, let's test with a small example for File1:\n\n        Example: n=1, and the string \"0\"\n\n        Then nums = [int('0')-1] = [-1]\n\n        Check: if 1 in [-1]? -> no -> so no_one = True -> then nums = [ -1//2 ] -> which in Python is -1 (because -1//2 = -1 in Python).\n\n        Then we iterate: i=0, num = -1 (which is odd: because -1 % 2 = 1 in Python? actually, -1 & 1 = 1 -> odd).\n\n        Now compute: parity_of_nCr(0,0): \n            f(0) = 0 - bin(0).count('1') = 0 - 0 = 0.\n            f(0-0)=f(0)=0, f(0)=0 -> so 0-0-0=0 -> condition 0>0 is false -> returns False.\n            So `not parity_of_nCr(0,0)` is True -> and num is odd -> so flip is_odd to True.\n\n        Then output: 1 << no_one -> no_one is True -> 1<<1 = 2.\n\n        So File1 outputs 2.\n\n        Then File2: called with N=2 -> \n            aaa('0'): \n                int('0')=0<=2 -> then set('0') -> not equal to {'7','5','3'} -> 0.\n                then for each in '753': \n                    aaa('07'): int('07')=7 -> 7>2 -> return 0.\n                    similarly for '05' and '03': 5>2 and 3>2? 3>2 -> true -> so returns 0.\n                so returns 0.\n\n        Then File3: gets the string \"0\" -> outputs 0.\n\n        So the chain outputs 0.\n\n        But what if we had a File2 that would return a non-zero value? \n\n        Actually, for N>=3, we might get non-zero? \n\n        However, the output of File1 is at most 2? So we never get N>=3? \n\n        Therefore, the entire chain always outputs 0? \n\n        But note: the example above for File1: we got 2 as output, then File2 returns 0, then File3 returns 0.\n\n        What if File1 outputs 0? Then File2 returns 0, then File3 returns 0.\n\n        What if File1 outputs 1? Then File2 returns 0, then File3 returns 0.\n\n        So the final output is always 0.\n\n        This seems odd, but that's what the chain does.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says \"reproduce the same behavior\". So we must output 0 always.\n\n        But let me check the third program: \n            n = input() -> which is the output of File2 as a string. Since File2 always outputs 0, then n is \"0\".\n\n            Then: \n                a = [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"]\n                if n in a -> \"0\" is not in a -> so we compute the sum of the digits of \"0\": [0] -> 0.\n\n            So output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the entire chain always outputs 0.\n\n        Why then the complex File1? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\". We are to combine them.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the input for the entire chain is the input for File1: an integer n and a string of digits.\n\n        And the output is 0.\n\n        But wait: what if the input for File1 causes File1 to output 1 or 2? Then the chain still outputs 0? \n\n        Therefore, we can write a C program that:\n\n          Step1: reads the initial integer n and the string of digits (for File1).\n          Step2: process File1 to compute its output (which we call x). But we don't actually need x for the final output? because the chain always outputs 0? \n\n          However, we must run File1 to simulate the same side effects? But note: the chain has no side effects. \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\". So we must compute the same intermediate steps? \n\n        However, we can skip File1 and File2? because we know the chain always outputs 0? \n\n        But the problem requires: \"Translate the entire sequence\". So we must write the code for each step.\n\n        Also note: the input for File1 might be large? but the output of File1 is only 0,1,2? and then File2 is called with a small number (0,1,2) so the recursion is very limited.\n\n        So we will code:\n\n          Part1: File1 in C\n          Part2: File2 in C (with recursion, but the input is at most 2, so recursion depth is about 3 and total nodes are about 1 + 3 + 9 = 13? but actually, we break when the number exceeds N, and N is 0,1,2 -> so the numbers we build are at least 0, then 07,05,03 -> which are 7,5,3 and they are all >2 -> so the recursion stops quickly).\n\n          Part3: File3 in C: which is to take the integer output from File2 (which is 0) and then output 0.\n\n        But note: the output of File2 is 0, then we convert it to a string and feed to File3.\n\n        However, the entire program must output 0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n (for File1) and then a string (the next line).\n\n          Process File1: \n             - Convert the string: each character to int, subtract one, then form an array of integers.\n             - Check if 1 is in that array? \n                 If not, then set no_one = 1 (true) and then for each element, do element = element / 2 (using integer division). \n                 But note: in C, for negative numbers, integer division truncates toward zero? but in Python, for negative it floors? \n                 However, the example: -1//2 in Python is -1, but in C: -1/2 is 0? because integer division truncates? \n\n                 Actually: \n                   Python: -1 // 2 = -1\n                   C: -1 / 2 = 0? but wait: in C, for integers, -1/2 is 0? Actually, no: in C, integer division truncates toward zero. \n                   But -1 divided by 2 is -0.5 -> truncated toward zero is 0? \n\n                 However, we want to mimic the Python behavior? \n\n                 But note: the condition for flipping the bit uses the parity (num & 1). \n\n                 In Python: \n                    -1 & 1 -> 1 (because -1 is represented as ...11111111, so the least significant bit is 1 -> odd).\n                 In C: \n                    -1 & 1 -> 1 (because the bit representation of -1 in two's complement has the least significant bit set).\n\n                 However, the division: \n                    In Python: -1//2 = -1 -> which is odd? because -1 & 1 = 1.\n                    In C: if we do -1/2 -> 0? which is even? \n\n                 This would break the logic.\n\n          Therefore, we must ensure the division is done as in Python: floor division.\n\n          How to do floor division in C? \n\n            For positive numbers, it's the same as truncation. \n            For negative, we can do: \n                if (num >= 0) \n                    num / 2\n                else \n                    (num - 1) / 2   ??? \n\n          Actually, we can use: \n                (num - (num < 0 ? 1 : 0)) / 2   -> but that doesn't work for even? \n\n          Alternatively, we note that the original program in File1 uses the condition on the original list: if 1 is not present, then we do integer division (and in Python it's floor). \n\n          But the input numbers are in the range: \n                original digit: '0' to '9' -> then subtract 1: -1 to 8.\n\n          So we only have to handle -1,0,1,...,8.\n\n          For the negative: only -1.\n\n          In Python: -1//2 = -1.\n\n          How to compute that in C? \n                We can do: \n                    if (num < 0) \n                        divided = (num - 1) / 2;\n                else \n                        divided = num / 2;\n\n          But check: \n                num = -1: \n                    (-1 - 1) / 2 = -2/2 = -1 -> which is correct.\n\n          But note: for even negative numbers? we don't have any even negative in the list? because we have only -1 (which is odd) and then 0,1,...,8.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n                if (num < 0)\n                    num = (num - 1) / 2;\n                else\n                    num = num / 2;\n\n          However, note: the division in C for integers is truncation. But we are doing (num-1) for negative, which is even? \n\n          Actually, for negative numbers: \n                We want: floor division by 2.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                num = (num - (num % 2)) / 2;   -> no, because we want floor.\n\n          Actually, the standard way to get floor division for negative numbers in C is:\n\n                num = (num < 0) ? (num - 1) / 2 : num / 2;\n\n          But note: when num is even? \n\n          Example: \n                num = -2: \n                    floor(-2/2) = -1.\n                    (-2-1)/2 = -3/2 = -1 (in integer division truncates to -1? because -3/2 in C truncates to -1? actually, no: -3/2 in C is -1.5 -> truncated to -1? but we want -1 -> so it works.\n\n          However, we don't have -2? the only negative is -1.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n                if (no_one) {\n                    for each element in the array:\n                         if (element < 0) \n                             element = (element - 1) / 2;\n                         else\n                             element = element / 2;\n                }\n\n          But note: the array elements are integers. And the array is built from the input string.\n\n          Alternatively, we note that the input digits are from '0' to '9', so the numbers after subtracting 1 are from -1 to 8.\n\n          We can handle -1 separately: \n                if (element == -1) \n                    element = -1;\n                else\n                    element = element / 2;   // because for nonnegative, truncation is the same as floor? for even? but what about odd nonnegative?\n\n          Actually, for nonnegative: \n                even: 0/2=0, 2/2=1, ... -> same as floor.\n                odd: 1/2=0 (in C truncates) but in Python: 1//2=0 -> same.\n\n          So for nonnegative, we can do integer division (truncation) and it matches.\n\n          Only for -1: we want -1 -> so we can do:\n\n                if (element == -1)\n                    element = -1;\n                else\n                    element = element / 2;\n\n          But note: what if the digit is '0'? then element = -1 -> we set to -1.\n          If the digit is '1'? then element=0 -> 0/2=0.\n          If the digit is '2'? then element=1 -> 1/2=0.\n\n          However, the condition for setting no_one is that the array does not contain 1 (i.e., no element that was originally from the digit '2'). \n\n          So if the array contains a 1 (from digit '2'), then we do not do the division. \n\n          Therefore, when we do the division, the array elements are either -1 or nonnegative that are not 1? Actually, no: the condition is that the array does not contain 1. \n\n          But note: the array might contain 1? only if the original digit was '2'. Then if there is any '2', we skip the division. \n\n          So when we do the division, the array elements are only -1 and nonnegative numbers that are not 1? \n\n          But nonnegative numbers that are not 1: they can be 0,2,3,...,8.\n\n          How to divide 0,2,3,...,8 by 2 in integer? \n                0 -> 0\n                2 -> 1\n                3 -> 1 (because 3/2=1.5 -> truncates to 1) -> same as Python: 3//2=1.\n                4->2, 5->2, 6->3, 7->3, 8->4.\n\n          So truncation in C for nonnegative is the same as floor.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for (each element in the array) {\n                    if (element < 0) \n                        element = -1;   // because the only negative is -1, and we want to set it to -1? \n                        // but wait: in our method above: (element-1)/2 for negative: (-1-1)/2 = -2/2 = -1 -> which is what we want.\n                    else\n                        element = element / 2;\n                }\n\n          But note: we can also do without the condition? because the only negative is -1? \n\n          However, we have to be generic? but the input digits are from '0' to '9'. \n\n          Alternatively, we do:\n\n                element = (element < 0) ? (element-1)/2 : element/2;\n\n          This works for -1 and for nonnegative.\n\n          Let me test with -1: (-1-1)/2 = -2/2 = -1 -> correct.\n          Test with 1: (1)/2 = 0 -> correct? but note: 1 should not appear in the array when we are doing the division? because the condition for division is that the array does not contain 1. \n\n          But wait: the condition is set at the beginning: we check the original array (before division) for the presence of 1. \n\n          So if the array originally contained 1 (from a digit '2'), then we skip the division. \n\n          Therefore, when we do the division, the array does not contain 1? but it might contain other numbers? including 0,2,3,...,8 and -1.\n\n          And we want to do the same as Python: \n                for each element: element // 2 (floor division).\n\n          So we can use:\n\n                if (no_one) {\n                    for each i:\n                         nums[i] = (nums[i] < 0) ? (nums[i]-1)/2 : nums[i]/2;\n                }\n\n          However, note: in C, if we do (nums[i]-1) for negative, and then divide by 2, we must be cautious: \n                The expression (nums[i]-1)/2: \n                    For -1: (-1-1) = -2, then -2/2 = -1 -> correct.\n\n          But what about -2? we don't have -2? so it's safe.\n\n          Now, the condition for the flip: \n                We have to compute the binomial coefficient C(n-1, i) mod 2? \n\n          We can compute the function twos_in_factorial(k) = k - __builtin_popcount(k) \n          But note: k can be up to n? and n is the input integer (which might be large?).\n\n          However, the input n for File1 is the first integer read. How big? \n\n          The problem does not specify. But we note that the function `bin(n).count('1')` in Python is the number of ones. In C, we can use __builtin_popcount for unsigned integers? but note: n might be negative? \n\n          But the input n is an integer, and the program uses n = int(input()) -> nonnegative? \n\n          The program also does: n-1 -> so we assume n>=1? \n\n          The function twos_in_factorial is defined for nonnegative? \n\n          Actually, for k>=0.\n\n          How to compute the number of ones in the binary representation of a nonnegative integer in C? \n\n            We can use: \n                int popcount(unsigned int x) {\n                    return __builtin_popcount(x);\n                }\n\n          But note: the input n might be large? and the standard says: __builtin_popcount for unsigned int? but if n is larger than 2^32? \n\n          We don't know the constraints. We'll assume that n is within the range of unsigned long long? but the problem does not specify.\n\n          However, the original Python program can handle arbitrarily large integers? \n\n          But in C, we have to handle big integers? \n\n          Alternatively, note that the condition in the loop:\n\n                for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n                    if not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i) and num & 1:\n                        is_odd ^= 1\n\n          The variable i goes from 0 to len(nums)-1. The length of nums is the length of the input string? which might be large? but the input string is one line.\n\n          However, the input string length might be up to 100000? but the binomial coefficient condition: we have to compute for i in [0, len-1] and n-1 might be huge? \n\n          How to compute f(k) = k - popcount(k) for huge k? \n\n          But note: the condition: \n                parity_of_nCr(n-1, i) returns (f(n-1) - f(n-1-i) - f(i)) > 0\n\n          We can avoid computing huge numbers? \n\n          Actually, the expression: \n                f(n-1) - f(n-1-i) - f(i) = (n-1) - popcount(n-1) - [(n-1-i) - popcount(n-1-i)] - [i - popcount(i)]\n                = (n-1) - popcount(n-1) - (n-1-i) + popcount(n-1-i) - i + popcount(i)\n                = - popcount(n-1) + popcount(n-1-i) + popcount(i)\n\n          So the condition becomes: \n                popcount(n-1) < popcount(n-1-i) + popcount(i)\n\n          But note: the exponent of 2 in C(n-1, i) is the number of carries when adding i and (n-1-i) in base 2? \n\n          Actually, by Kummer: the exponent of 2 in C(n-1, i) is the number of carries when adding i and (n-1-i) in base 2. \n\n          However, we don't need that. We can compute the popcounts? but n-1 might be huge? \n\n          But the problem: the input n might be huge? then n-1 is a big integer? and we have to compute the popcount? \n\n          However, the condition only requires the sign: is popcount(n-1) < popcount(n-1-i) + popcount(i)? \n\n          But note: the popcount of a number is at most the number of bits? and the number of bits of n-1 is about log2(n). \n\n          However, we cannot compute the popcount for a huge n? because we don't have big integers in C? \n\n          The original Python program uses bin(n).count('1') for arbitrarily large integers. \n\n          But in C, we don't have that? \n\n          How to handle? \n\n          The problem says: \"reproduce the same behavior\". So we must handle arbitrarily large integers? \n\n          But the problem also says: \"You are an AI programming assistant\" and we are to write a C program. \n\n          We have two options:\n\n            1. Use a big integer library? but the problem does not allow that? and the original programs are in Python.\n\n            2. Note that the input n for File1 might be given as a string? because the next input is a string? but the first input is an integer? \n\n          Actually, the first input is an integer: n = int(input()). In Python, input() reads a string, then int() converts it to an integer. \n\n          So n can be arbitrarily large? \n\n          Then the function bin(n).count('1') can be computed by reading the string representation of n in base 10 and converting to base 2? \n\n          But that is expensive? and the problem does not specify constraints.\n\n          Alternatively, note that the condition: \n                parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)  is equivalent to: \n                    C(n-1, i) mod 2 == 0? \n\n          And by Lucas' theorem: \n                    C(n-1, i) mod 2 = 1   if and only if \n                    the binary representation of i is a subset of the binary representation of n-1? \n\n          So the condition `not parity_of_nCr(n-1, i)` is True when the binomial coefficient is odd? which is when the binary representation of i is a subset of the binary representation of n-1.\n\n          How to check that without converting huge numbers to binary? \n\n          We can use: \n                while (i) {\n                    if ( (i & 1) && !( (n-1) & 1 ) ) then it's not a subset? \n                    i >>= 1;\n                    (n-1) >>= 1;\n                }\n\n          But note: Lucas' theorem: \n                Write i and n-1 in base 2: \n                    i = i0 + i1*2 + ... \n                    n-1 = n0 + n1*2 + ... \n                then C(n-1, i) mod 2 = 1 if and only if for every bit position, i_bit <= n_bit? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n                int check = 1;\n                long long ii = i;   // i is at most the length of the string (which is not huge) -> but the problem: i is the index in the array, so i < len(nums). \n                unsigned long long base = n_minus_one; // but n_minus_one might be huge? \n\n          However, we cannot store n-1 in an unsigned long long if it has more than 64 bits? \n\n          Alternative: we can use an array to store the binary representation of n-1? \n\n          But the input n is given as a string? \n\n          We can: \n                Read n as a string? then convert to a binary representation stored in an array of bits? \n\n          But the length of the string for n might be up to 100000? then the binary representation has about O(log10(n))? but no: the string length is the number of digits, and the number of bits is about log2(10^len) = len * log2(10) ~ len * 3.32 -> so 100000*4 = 400000 bits? \n\n          We can store an array of 400000 bits? \n\n          Steps for File1:\n\n                Step1: read the integer n as a string? because it might be huge. Let's call the string n_str.\n                Step2: convert n_str to a number? but if it's huge, we cannot store in an integer type. \n\n          But note: the next input is a string of digits? and the length of that string might be huge too? \n\n          And then we have to iterate over that string? so the length might be 400000? and we have to do a loop of 400000 iterations? which is acceptable in C? \n\n          However, the binomial condition: for each index i in [0, len-1] (which is up to 400000) we have to check if the binary representation of i is a subset of the binary representation of n-1? \n\n          How to do that without converting n-1 to binary? \n\n          We can precompute the binary representation of n-1? \n\n          But how to compute n-1 when n is given as a string of digits? and might be huge? \n\n          We can subtract 1 from the decimal string? \n\n          Then convert the decimal string to a binary string? \n\n          Then for each i (which is up to 400000, so about 19 bits), we can check: \n                for each bit in i (from 0 to 18), if the bit is set in i, then check if the corresponding bit in n-1 is set? \n\n          Steps:\n\n                Precomputation:\n                  Step1: read n_str and convert to a big integer? but we don't want to use big integer libraries.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use an array to store the decimal number, then subtract 1? \n\n                  Subtract 1: \n                      start from the last digit: \n                          if the last digit is not '0', then subtract 1 and break.\n                          else, set to '9' and carry to the next.\n\n                  Then remove leading zeros? \n\n                Then convert the decimal string (n-1) to a binary string? \n\n                The length of the binary string is about 3.32 * len(n_str) -> which is acceptable if len(n_str) is 100000? 400000 characters? \n\n                Then for each i in the range [0, len(nums)-1] (which is the length of the next input string, which is the same as the length of the array? and we read that string as well), we do:\n\n                  Check: for each bit position j (0 to about 20, because i is at most 400000, which is less than 2^19) \n                         if the j-th bit of i is set, then check if the j-th bit of the binary representation of n-1 is set.\n\n                  If we find one bit j where the bit in i is set and in n-1 is not set, then the binomial coefficient is even? so we skip.\n\n                  Only if for every bit j set in i, the bit in n-1 is also set, then the binomial coefficient is odd? and then we check if the current num is odd? if yes, flip the bit.\n\n          This is O(20 * len(nums)) -> 20 * 400000 = 8e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          Summary for File1 in C:\n\n                Read n as a string (n_str).\n                Read the next line as a string (digits).\n\n                Step1: subtract 1 from n_str to get n_minus_one_str? \n                        But note: the program uses n-1 in the binomial coefficient? \n\n                Step2: convert n_minus_one_str to a binary string? (big-endian or little-endian? we can store the binary string as a dynamic array of characters? or as an array of integers (0/1) in little-endian: index0 is the least significant bit.\n\n                Step3: build the array nums: \n                         for each char c in the string 'digits': \n                             nums[i] = (c - '0') - 1;\n\n                Step4: check if the array contains 1? \n                         for each element in nums: if (element == 1) then found.\n\n                         If not found, then set no_one = 1 and then for each element: \n                             nums[i] = (nums[i] < 0) ?

File2 reads an integer N = x.\n\n                The function aaa does: \n                    if (atoi(n) > N) return 0;\n                    // But note: the number might have leading zeros? \n                    // In the original: int(n) -> which ignores leading zeros.\n\n                We can do: \n                    long long current = atoll(n);   // but the number might be represented by a string that is too long? \n                    However, the depth is at most the number of digits we add? and we add at most 3 or 4 digits? because N is at most 2? and the numbers we build start with 0 and then we append one digit: so the numbers are 0, 07,05,03, 077,075,... but note: 07 is 7, which is already >2? so we break.\n\n                Therefore, we can use atoi? because the number of digits is small.\n\n                However, we have to avoid numbers with leading zeros? but the function aaa is called with '0', then '07','05','03'. Then at the next level: '077','075',... -> but these are 77,75,... which are large.\n\n                We can implement the recursion in C:\n\n                  int aaa(char *n, int N) {\n                      int current = atoi(n);   // because n is a string of digits, and the number of digits is small (at most 10? but N<=2, so we break at the first level?).\n                      if (current > N) {\n                          return 0;\n                      }\n                      // Check if the set of digits in n is exactly {'3','5','7'}? \n                      // But note: n might have a leading zero? -> then the string is \"0\", set(str(0)) is {'0'} -> not 753.\n\n                      // How to check: \n                      //   We have to ignore leading zeros? but atoi already converted to a number, then we convert that number to a string? \n                      //   But the original: set(str(int(n))) \n                      //   Example: n=\"0\" -> int(n)=0 -> str(0)=\"0\" -> set is {'0'}.\n\n                      // We can do: \n                      char buf[20];\n                      sprintf(buf, \"%d\", current);\n                      int len = strlen(buf);\n                      int has3=0, has5=0, has7=0, other=0;\n                      for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                          if (buf[i]=='3') has3=1;\n                          else if (buf[i]=='5') has5=1;\n                          else if (buf[i]=='7') has7=1;\n                          else other=1;\n                      }\n                      int ans = 0;\n                      if (has3 && has5 && has7 && !other) \n                          ans = 1;\n                      else \n                          ans = 0;\n\n                      // Then for each digit in \"753\", recursively call aaa with the new string: n + digit.\n                      char new_str[100]; // big enough\n                      for (char *p = \"753\"; *p; p++) {\n                          sprintf(new_str, \"%s%c\", n, *p);\n                          ans += aaa(new_str, N);\n                      }\n                      return ans;\n                  }\n\n                But note: the initial call is aaa(\"0\", x).\n\n                However, the original starts at \"0\", and then builds \"07\", \"05\", etc.\n\n          Then File3: \n                We have the output of File2: y = aaa(\"0\", x) -> which is 0 for x=0,1,2.\n\n                Then we convert y to a string? \n                Then we check if the string is in the list [\"10\",\"100\",\"1000\",\"10000\",\"100000\"]? \n                If yes, output 10; else, output the sum of the digits of the string.\n\n                But the string is \"0\", so the sum is 0.\n\n          However, note: what if y is not 0? but in our case it is.\n\n          But to be generic, we do:\n\n                char y_str[20];\n                sprintf(y_str, \"%d\", y);\n\n                // Check if y_str is one of the strings in the list.\n                char *a[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n                int found = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n                    if (strcmp(y_str, a[i])==0) {\n                        found = 1;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (found) {\n                    printf(\"10\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    int sum = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; y_str[i]; i++) {\n                        sum += y_str[i] - '0';\n                    }\n                    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);\n                }\n\n          But note: the output of the entire program is the output of File3.\n\n          However, the entire chain always outputs 0? as we reasoned.\n\n          But we must implement the steps.\n\n        Given the complexity of File1 with huge n, and the fact that the output of File1 is only 0,1,2, and then File2 and File3 are trivial, we can optimize: \n\n          We don't actually need the huge n for File1 beyond the first step: because we only care about the value of n-1 modulo the length of the array? no, we need the full binary representation to check the binomial coefficient condition.\n\n          But the length of the array is the length of the next input string? which might be huge (up to 400000). \n\n          And we have to iterate over the array and for each i (which is from 0 to 400000) we have to check the binomial condition by Lucas' theorem? and that requires the binary representation of n-1? which might be huge? \n\n          How expensive is the conversion of n-1 from decimal string to binary? \n\n          We have a string of digits (n_str) of length L. \n\n          The conversion: we can use a method by repeatedly dividing by 2? \n\n          We'll store the binary representation in an array of integers (each element is a bit). The number of bits is about 3.32 * L.\n\n          The conversion: O(L * number_of_bits) = O(L^2) -> which for L=100000, 100000^2 = 10e9 -> too slow.\n\n          Alternative: use a more efficient conversion? \n\n          But the problem does not specify the constraints on the size of n. \n\n          We might assume that n is not huge? or we might use an alternative method for the binomial coefficient condition.\n\n          By Lucas' theorem: \n                C(n-1, i) mod 2 = 1   if and only if i is a subset of n-1 in binary.\n\n          We can avoid converting the entire n-1 to binary if we can process the bits of i and n-1 on the fly? \n\n          However, i is at most the length of the array (say up to 400000) and has at most 19 bits. \n\n          But n-1 is huge? and we need to know the bits of n-1 at the positions that i has? \n\n          Specifically, for the condition: we need to know the bits of n-1 at the bit positions that are present in i? and only up to the highest bit in i? which is 19.\n\n          So we only need the low 20 bits of n-1? \n\n          Why? \n\n          Because i has at most 19 bits? so we only need to know n-1 modulo 2^20? \n\n          But wait: the binomial coefficient condition by Lucas' theorem requires that every bit in i is a subset of the corresponding bit in n-1? and the bits of i are only in the low 20 bits? \n\n          However, if n-1 has a 0 in a low bit that i has a 1, then it fails. But if n-1 has a 0 in a high bit (beyond the bits of i) it doesn affect the low bits? \n\n          Therefore, we only need the low 20 bits of n-1? \n\n          How to compute the low 20 bits of n-1? \n\n          We can compute (n-1) mod (2^20) -> but then we don't get the entire bit representation for the high bits? \n\n          Actually, we only need the bits in the positions where i has a 1? and these are in the low 20 bits. \n\n          So we can compute: \n                low20 = (n-1) & ((1<<20)-1)\n\n          But n-1 is huge? and we are given n as a decimal string. \n\n          How to compute (n-1) mod (2^20) from a decimal string? \n\n          We can do:\n\n                low20 = 0;\n                for each char c in the decimal string (from left to right? \n                    low20 = (low20 * 10 + (c - '0')) % (1<<20);\n\n          But then we want the entire bit pattern of the low 20 bits? \n\n          Then for a given i, we can:\n\n                for bit_pos=0 to 19:\n                    if (i has a 1 at bit_pos) and (low20 has a 0 at bit_pos), then the binomial coefficient is even? \n\n          This works? \n\n          Example: \n                i = 5 (binary 101) \n                then we need to check bit0 and bit2 of n-1? \n                if bit0 of n-1 is 0 or bit2 is 0, then fail.\n\n          But what if n-1 has more than 20 bits? then the higher bits are not checked? \n\n          But the higher bits of i are all zeros? so by Lucas' theorem, we only care about the bits in the positions that i has ones? and those are in the low 20 bits. \n\n          Therefore, this is sufficient.\n\n          Steps for File1 for the binomial condition for a given i:\n\n                low20 = (n-1) % (1<<20);   // we only care about the low 20 bits.\n\n                int is_odd_bin = 1;\n                int temp_i = i;\n                int bit_pos = 0;\n                while (temp_i) {\n                    if (temp_i & 1) {\n                        // check if the bit_pos-th bit in low20 is set?\n                        if ( !(low20 & (1 << bit_pos)) ) {\n                            is_odd_bin = 0;\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    temp_i /= 2;\n                    bit_pos++;\n                }\n\n          But note: the bit positions: the least significant bit is bit0.\n\n          How to compute (n-1) from the string n_str? \n\n                We can compute n_minus_one_string by subtracting 1 from the string? \n\n                Then compute low20 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<len(n_minus_one_string); i++) {\n                    low20 = (low20 * 10 + (n_minus_one_string[i] - '0')) % (1<<20);\n                }\n\n          However, note: we want (n-1) mod (1<<20), but we can do:\n\n                low20 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<len(n_str); i++) {\n                    low20 = (low20 * 10 + (n_str[i] - '0')) % (1<<20);\n                }\n                // then subtract 1?
