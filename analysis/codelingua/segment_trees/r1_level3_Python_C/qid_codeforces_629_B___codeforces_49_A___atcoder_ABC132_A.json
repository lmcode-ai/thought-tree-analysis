Now the third program: \n        S = \"NO\"\n        set(S) -> {'N','O'} -> size 2 -> good. then it checks: count of 'N' is 1, which is not 2 -> so it prints \"No\".

So the third program reads \"NO\\n\" or just \"NO\"? Actually, `input()` in Python strips the trailing newline? In the third program: `S = input()` would read the entire line without the newline.

But that cannot be: what if the first program outputs a number that when converted to string ends with a vowel? But as we said, digits are not vowels.

Example input for the first program:\n        1\n        M 1 2\n\n    Then the first program:\n        n = 1\n        m[1] += 2, m[3] -= 2 (because b = 2+1 = 3) Then do prefix sums: \n            m[0]=0, m[1]=2, m[2]=2, m[3]=0, ... f remains zeros. Then for each i from 0 to 367:\n            a = m[i] (after prefix) -> at i=1: a=2, b=0 -> min=0; at i=2: a=2, b=0 -> min=0; ... \n            so c remains 0? Then it prints 0. Then the second program: \n        reads \"0\" -> last character is '0' -> not vowel -> prints \"NO\"\n\n    Then the third program: \n        reads \"NO\" -> set has two distinct characters, but counts: 'N':1, 'O':1 -> not 2 -> prints \"No\"\n\n    So the final output is \"No\". Another example: \n        Input: \n            2\n            M 1 2\n            F 1 2\n\n        Then:\n            m[1] +=2, m[3] -=2\n            f[1] +=2, f[3] -=2\n\n            Then prefix: \n                m: [0,2,2,0,...]\n                f: [0,2,2,0,...]\n            Then at each day:\n                day1: min(2,2)=2 -> c becomes 2 (if we check in order, but note the loop: at day1, a=2, b=2 -> min=2, which is >0 -> c=2; then day2: min(2,2)=2, which is not greater than 2 -> so c remains 2. Then prints 2.\n\n        Second program: reads \"2\" -> last char '2' -> not vowel -> \"NO\"\n\n        Third program: \"NO\" -> \"No\"\n\n    So the final output is always \"No\". But wait: what if the second program had a vowel?",

But the events: we start at 0 and then add the differences. The differences are +2 and -2. The prefix sums might become negative? Example: \n                event: M 10 20 -> then m[10] +=2, m[21] -=2. then at i<10: 0.\n                i=10: 2. i=11: 2 (until i=20)\n                i=21: 0? but we subtract 2 at m[21] -> then at i=21: a_sum = 0? But what if we have two events: \n                event1: M 10 20 -> m[10]=2, m[21]=-2. event2: M 0 5 -> m[0]=2, m[6]=-2. Then at i=0: a_sum=2 -> positive. at i=5: a_sum=2. at i=6: a_sum=0.\n            at i=10: a_sum=2. How about an event that starts at 100 and ends at 50? That doesn't make sense. The input a and b_val: we assume a<=b_val? The problem does not specify. The original program does not sort. Example: \n                event: M 50 10 -> then a=50, b=10+1=11. Then we update m[50] +=2, m[11] -=2. Then the prefix sums:\n                from 0 to 10: 0.\n                at 11: -2.\n                ... until 49: -2.\n                at 50: 0? (because -2+2=0). Then the min_val at each step: \n                at i=11 to 49: the value is -2 -> which is negative. Then the maximum min_val? It starts at 0, then we see negative values -> so the maximum remains 0. Therefore, the min_val can be negative. But then the output c_val might be negative? Then the string representation of a negative number: for example, if c_val=-5, then the string is \"-5\". The second program: \n                It traverses from the end: \n                    last character: '5' -> not vowel -> output \"NO\". So even if negative, the last character is a digit -> not vowel. Therefore, the second program still outputs \"NO\". Therefore, we are safe. Conclusion: the C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #define N 368\n\n            int main() {\n                int n;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n                int m[N], f[N];\n                // Initialize to zero\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    m[i] = 0;\n                    f[i] = 0;\n                }\n\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    char c;\n                    int a, b_val;\n                    // Read the event: note the input might have spaces? \n                    // Format: one char, then two integers.

If not, we skip to avoid crash? \n                        // But to be identical, we must crash. // We'll do: m[b] -=2; without check -> if b>=N, then undefined behavior -> crash.\n                    } else {\n                        f[a] += 2;\n                        f[b] -= 2;   // same as above\n                    }\n                }\n\n                int a_sum = 0, b_sum = 0;\n                int max_overlap = 0;   // c in the first program\n\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    a_sum += m[i];\n                    b_sum += f[i];\n                    int min_val = a_sum < b_sum ? a_sum : b_sum;\n                    if (min_val > max_overlap) {\n                        max_overlap = min_val;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // The rest of the chain: we know the second program outputs \"NO\", the third outputs \"No\"\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, to be absolutely safe and avoid the crash for b>=N, we can note that the original program would crash. So we want to crash? But in C, if we write to m[b] with b>=N, it is undefined behavior. It might crash, or it might not. We can do bounds checking to mimic the Python: if (a >= N || a < 0 || b >= N || b < 0) {\n                // We can force a crash: \n                int *p = NULL;\n                *p = 0;   // segmentation fault\n            } But the problem does not require that. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (a < 0 || a >= N) {\n                // crash\n                int x = 10 / 0;   // division by zero -> crash? \n            } But division by zero is undefined and might not crash. We'll assume the input is valid and within bounds. Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem says \"on the same input\", we assume the input has a and b_val such that a in [0,367] and b_val in [0,366] so that b = b_val+1 is in [0,367].",

The last character of \"NO\" is 'O'. And 'O' is in the vowel list? vo = ['a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y']\n\n        'O' is in the list. So the second program: \n        It breaks at the last non-space and non-? character. In the string \"NO\", the last character is 'O'.

So the final output is still \"No\". But wait: the second program outputs \"YES\" (without any space or question mark) so the entire string is \"YES\". It iterates from the last index (len-1) to 0:\n            i=2: character 'S' -> not space or '?' -> check: 'S' not in vo -> so it would print \"NO\" and break? But wait: the code:\n\n            for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n                if (a[i]==' ' or a[i]=='?'):\n                    continue\n                else: if (a[i] in vo):\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n\n        So at the last character of \"YES\": \n            a[2] = 'S' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\" and break. Then the third program reads \"NO\", and then outputs \"No\". Therefore, the second program outputs \"NO\" for both cases? Why? Because the last character of \"YES\" is 'S' (which is not a vowel). But note: the string \"YES\" has three letters: \n            index0: 'Y' -> vowel? yes, but we are going backwards: \n            index2: 'S' -> not vowel -> so it prints \"NO\". Then why would it ever print \"YES\"?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into one C program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads an integer n, then n lines of data. Each line has a character (either 'M' or 'F') and two integers.\n    It builds two arrays `m` and `f` (size 368) by doing a range update (using difference arrays). Then it does a prefix sum to get the actual values and finds the maximum overlap (minimum of the two arrays at each point) over the range.\n\n 2. The second program reads a string (which is the output of the first program, but note: the first program prints an integer `c`). However, note that the second program expects a string. \n    Actually, the first program prints an integer and then the second program reads that integer as a string? But wait, the second program is reading a whole line? \n\n    However, the chain is: \n        Program1: reads some input, computes and prints one integer (the maximum overlap `c`).\n        Program2: reads the output of program1 as a string? But note: the second program expects a string that might have spaces and a question mark? \n\n    But the output of the first program is just an integer and a newline. The second program then processes that string: it goes from the end backwards until it finds a non-space and non-question mark. Then it checks if that character is a vowel.\n\n    However, the input to the second program is the string representation of the integer. For example, if the first program outputs \"10\", then the second program will look at the string \"10\". It will skip the last character if it's a space or '?'? But note: the output of the first program is just digits and a newline? The second program reads with `input()` which by default in the given code would read a line. So the string `a` is the entire line (without the newline if we use `sys.stdin.readline` and strip? But in the second program, they do `a = input()` which in Python would read a line and strip the trailing newline?).\n\n    But note: the second program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and then we break.\n\n 3. The third program reads a string (which is the output of the second program: either \"YES\" or \"NO\", including the newline? Actually, the second program prints without any extra spaces: \"YES\" or \"NO\" and then a newline?).\n\n    However, the third program expects a string and then checks:\n        - If the string has exactly two distinct characters, and each appears exactly two times? \n        But the string from the second program is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n        - \"YES\": distinct characters: 'Y','E','S' -> 3 distinct -> so it would print \"No\".\n        - \"NO\": distinct characters: 'N','O' -> 2 distinct, but counts: each one time -> so it would print \"No\".\n\n    This seems problematic.\n\n But wait: the chain of execution is:\n\n    Input for the entire system is first the input for program1, then the output of program1 becomes the input for program2, then the output of program2 becomes the input for program3.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n But the second program's output is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", and the third program uses that as input.\n\n The third program then checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice? That would never be true for \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n However, looking at the original Python code:\n\n    Program1: reads data, computes and prints `c` (an integer).\n\n    Then program2: reads the integer as a string? For example, if `c` is 10, then the string is \"10\". Then it goes backwards until it finds the last non-space, non-question mark. Since the string is \"10\", it would skip the last character? No: the string is \"10\" (without any space or question mark). So it checks the last character: '0' -> not a vowel -> prints \"NO\". Then the third program gets the string \"NO\". \n\n    Now the third program: \n        S = \"NO\"\n        set(S) -> {'N','O'} -> size 2 -> good.\n        then it checks: count of 'N' is 1, which is not 2 -> so it prints \"No\".\n\n    But the original chain would then output \"No\".\n\n However, note that the second program does not output \"NO\" with a trailing newline? Actually, the `print` in Python adds a newline. So the third program reads \"NO\\n\" or just \"NO\"? Actually, `input()` in Python strips the trailing newline? \n\n    In the third program: `S = input()` would read the entire line without the newline. So if the second program printed \"NO\\n\", then the third program's `input()` returns \"NO\".\n\n    So the third program gets \"NO\": \n        set(S) = {'N','O'} -> size 2 -> good.\n        count: \n            c['N'] = 1 -> not 2 -> prints \"No\".\n\n    The final output is \"No\".\n\n But what if the first program outputs 5? Then the second program gets the string \"5\". \n    It iterates from the last character backwards: \n        i = 0: character is '5' -> not space or '?' -> then check: is '5' in `vo`? -> no -> print \"NO\".\n\n    Then the third program gets \"NO\", and outputs \"No\".\n\n What if the first program outputs 0? Then the string is \"0\": same as above -> \"NO\" -> \"No\".\n\n But what if the first program outputs a number that ends with a vowel? For example, 1? \n    The last non-space, non-? character is '1' -> not vowel -> \"NO\" -> \"No\".\n\n How about 2? same.\n\n How about 10? last non-space is '0' -> not vowel -> \"NO\" -> \"No\".\n\n But what if the number ends with, say, 1? It's the same.\n\n Actually, the digits are not vowels. So the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\n Therefore, the third program will always output \"No\".\n\n However, wait: what if the first program outputs a string that has a vowel at the end? The first program outputs an integer. The integer as a string will only contain digits. And the digits are not vowels. So the second program will always break at the last digit and that digit is not a vowel -> always \"NO\".\n\n But note: the second program might read the newline? Actually, the first program prints `c` and then a newline. So the second program's input string is the digits and the newline? \n\n    The second program: \n        a = input()   # This reads a line and removes the trailing newline? \n        Actually, in the second program, they use `a = input()`. In Python, `input()` reads until newline and returns the string without the trailing newline.\n\n    So the string `a` is just the digits. Then the program iterates from `len(a)-1` down to 0. \n\n    Example: if the first program outputs \"10\", then `a = \"10\"` (without the newline). Then:\n        i = 1: character is '0' -> not space and not '?' -> then check if '0' is in `vo`? -> no -> print \"NO\".\n\n    So always \"NO\".\n\n Therefore, the entire chain: \n    First program: reads some input, computes `c` (an integer) and prints it.\n    Second program: reads the string of `c` and always outputs \"NO\".\n    Third program: reads \"NO\" and outputs \"No\".\n\n But wait: what if the integer `c` has a vowel in its string representation? \n    The vowels are 'a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y'. \n    The digits: '0','1',...'9' are not in that list.\n\n    Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the second program might break on a digit that is not the last? No, because it breaks at the first non-space and non-question mark from the end. Since there are no spaces or question marks in the string (it's just digits), it breaks at the last character.\n\n    So it always checks the last character? \n\n    But what if the integer is negative? The first program: `c` is the maximum overlap, which is the minimum of two nonnegative arrays? So `c` is nonnegative. Therefore, the string representation of `c` has no minus sign.\n\n    Therefore, we can simplify: the entire chain is:\n\n        Step1: Read the input for the first program, compute `c`.\n        Step2: Output of the chain will be \"No\", because the second program outputs \"NO\", then the third program outputs \"No\".\n\n    But wait: the first program might not even run? We must run the first program because the second program's input is the output of the first.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"the entire sequence\" must be translated.\n\n    But note: the third program's output is the final output.\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"No\".\n\n    But that cannot be: what if the first program outputs a number that when converted to string ends with a vowel? But as we said, digits are not vowels.\n\n    So the chain is deterministic: the final output is always \"No\".\n\n However, let me check the original Python code independently.\n\n    Example input for the first program:\n        1\n        M 1 2\n\n    Then the first program:\n        n = 1\n        m[1] += 2, m[3] -= 2 (because b = 2+1 = 3)\n        Then do prefix sums: \n            m[0]=0, m[1]=2, m[2]=2, m[3]=0, ... \n            f remains zeros.\n        Then for each i from 0 to 367:\n            a = m[i] (after prefix) -> at i=1: a=2, b=0 -> min=0; at i=2: a=2, b=0 -> min=0; ... \n            so c remains 0? \n        Then it prints 0.\n\n    Then the second program: \n        reads \"0\" -> last character is '0' -> not vowel -> prints \"NO\"\n\n    Then the third program: \n        reads \"NO\" -> set has two distinct characters, but counts: 'N':1, 'O':1 -> not 2 -> prints \"No\"\n\n    So the final output is \"No\".\n\n    Another example: \n        Input: \n            2\n            M 1 2\n            F 1 2\n\n        Then:\n            m[1] +=2, m[3] -=2\n            f[1] +=2, f[3] -=2\n\n            Then prefix: \n                m: [0,2,2,0,...]\n                f: [0,2,2,0,...]\n            Then at each day:\n                day1: min(2,2)=2 -> c becomes 2 (if we check in order, but note the loop: at day1, a=2, b=2 -> min=2, which is >0 -> c=2; then day2: min(2,2)=2, which is not greater than 2 -> so c remains 2.\n            Then prints 2.\n\n        Second program: reads \"2\" -> last char '2' -> not vowel -> \"NO\"\n\n        Third program: \"NO\" -> \"No\"\n\n    So the final output is always \"No\".\n\n But wait: what if the second program had a vowel? Actually, the second program's output is always \"NO\" (which does not have a vowel in the last character? Actually, the last character of \"NO\" is 'O', which is a vowel? \n\n    Correction: the second program outputs either \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n\n    In our example, it outputs \"NO\". The last character of \"NO\" is 'O'. And 'O' is in the vowel list? \n\n        vo = ['a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y']\n\n        'O' is in the list.\n\n    So the second program: \n        It breaks at the last non-space and non-? character. In the string \"NO\", the last character is 'O'. \n        Then it checks: if 'O' is in vo -> yes -> then it prints \"YES\".\n\n    Then the third program: \n        reads \"YES\" -> distinct characters: set('YES') = {'Y','E','S'} -> 3 distinct -> prints \"No\".\n\n    So the final output is still \"No\".\n\n    But wait: the second program outputs \"YES\" (without any space or question mark) so the entire string is \"YES\". \n        It iterates from the last index (len-1) to 0:\n            i=2: character 'S' -> not space or '?' -> check: 'S' not in vo -> so it would print \"NO\" and break? \n\n        But wait: the code:\n\n            for i in range(len(a)-1, -1, -1):\n                if (a[i]==' ' or a[i]=='?'):\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    if (a[i] in vo):\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n\n        So at the last character of \"YES\": \n            a[2] = 'S' -> not vowel -> print \"NO\" and break.\n\n        Then the third program reads \"NO\", and then outputs \"No\".\n\n    Therefore, the second program outputs \"NO\" for both cases? \n\n        Why? Because the last character of \"YES\" is 'S' (which is not a vowel). \n\n        But note: the string \"YES\" has three letters: \n            index0: 'Y' -> vowel? yes, but we are going backwards: \n            index2: 'S' -> not vowel -> so it prints \"NO\".\n\n        Then why would it ever print \"YES\"? \n\n        Actually, the second program is designed to check the last non-space and non-question mark character. \n\n        For example, if the string ends with a vowel? \n\n        The string we are passing to the second program is the output of the first program: an integer. The integer is represented as a string of digits. The last character is a digit -> not vowel -> so it prints \"NO\".\n\n        But what if the output of the first program had a trailing space? It doesn't.\n\n        What if the output of the first program was a number that ends with the digit '1'? Then the last character is '1' -> not vowel -> \"NO\".\n\n        What if the output was the string \"1a\"? But the first program outputs an integer, so no letters.\n\n    Therefore, the second program will always output \"NO\". \n\n    Then the third program: \n        Input: \"NO\" -> distinct characters: {'N','O'} -> size=2 -> then check counts: \n            'N':1, 'O':1 -> which is not 2 -> so it outputs \"No\".\n\n    Therefore, the entire chain always outputs \"No\".\n\n    But wait: what if the second program outputs \"NO\" (which is two letters) and the third program expects exactly two distinct characters and each appearing twice? \n\n        The string \"NO\" has two distinct characters, but each appears once. So it fails.\n\n    Therefore, the chain always outputs \"No\".\n\n    So we can write a C program that:\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (an integer n, then n lines of data) and simulate the first program to compute the integer `c`.\n        Step 2: We don't actually need to output `c` as a string and then process it through the second and third programs because we know the second program always outputs \"NO\" and the third program always outputs \"No\". \n\n        However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we must simulate the entire chain exactly? \n\n        But note: the second program's input is the output of the first program. We must generate the string representation of `c` and then process it as the second program does? And then take that output and process as the third program? \n\n        However, we can skip the intermediate I/O because we are writing a single C program. \n\n        Steps:\n\n          Part1: \n            Read n.\n            For each of the n lines: \n                read a character and two integers.\n                update the difference arrays for 'm' or 'f'\n\n            Then do prefix sums and compute the maximum c (which is the maximum over the range of min(m[i], f[i])? Actually, the first program does:\n                a = 0, b = 0, c = 0\n                for i in range(N):\n                    a += m[i]   -> a becomes the prefix sum of m\n                    b += f[i]   -> b becomes the prefix sum of f\n                    if min(a, b) > c: c = min(a, b)\n\n          Part2: \n            We have the integer `c`. We now want to simulate the second program: \n                We have a string `a` = the string representation of `c` (without any extra spaces, and without any trailing newline? because the first program printed it and then the second program read it without the newline).\n\n                Then we traverse the string backwards until we find a non-space and non-question mark. Since the string is the digits of `c`, there are no spaces or question marks. So we take the last character.\n\n                Then check: is that last character a vowel? \n                    Vowels: 'a','e','i','o','u','y','A','E','I','O','U','Y'\n\n                Since the last character is a digit, it is not a vowel -> so the second program would output \"NO\".\n\n          Part3:\n            Now we have the string \"NO\" (without the quotes) as the input for the third program.\n\n            The third program:\n                It reads the string and then:\n                    - Converts to a set: the distinct characters are 'N' and 'O' -> size=2 -> good.\n                    - Then it checks the frequency: \n                         frequency of 'N' is 1, frequency of 'O' is 1 -> not 2 -> so it outputs \"No\".\n\n            Therefore, the final output is \"No\".\n\n        However, note: the second program in the original chain outputs \"NO\" (which is two characters: 'N','O') and then a newline? \n\n        The third program reads that entire line? So the string for the third program is \"NO\" (without the newline). \n\n        How do we simulate without I/O? \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Step1: Compute `c` as in the first program.\n\n          Step2: \n            We don't actually need to build the string of `c` and then check its last digit because we know it's a digit and not a vowel. So we know the second program would output \"NO\".\n\n          Step3: \n            Now we have the string \"NO\" (without newline) for the third program.\n\n            The third program: \n                Check if the set of characters in \"NO\" has size exactly 2 -> yes.\n                Then check if each character appears exactly twice -> no (each appears once) -> output \"No\".\n\n        Therefore, we can simply output \"No\" at the end.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\". And we are only allowed to do I/O at the beginning (for the first program's input) and at the end (for the final output).\n\n        However, we must simulate the entire chain. The chain always outputs \"No\". \n\n        But what if the first program had an error? For example, if the first program had an input that causes the prefix arrays to have a negative value? Actually, the difference arrays are updated with positive and negative, but the prefix sums are nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, the first program: \n            It updates: for an 'M' event: m[a] +=2, m[b] -=2 -> and then the prefix sum might be negative? \n            But note: we start at 0 and then we add the differences. The events are given arbitrarily. \n\n        However, the problem says: the first program reads n events. The events have a, b such that a and b are integers? and then we update the array at index a and at index b (with b being one more than the given integer). \n\n        But the indices: the array is of size 368. The input integers? They are given as strings, but then converted to integers. \n\n        The constraints: the first program uses indices from 0 to 367. The input integers a and b? The problem does not specify the range, but the array is of size 368. So we assume the integers a and b are in the range [0, 367]? \n\n        Actually, the program initializes m and f of length N=368. Then it updates at `a` and `b`. If `a` or `b` are beyond 367? Then it would crash? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". We must assume the input is valid? \n\n        We'll assume the input integers a and b are in [0, 367].\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            Read n.\n            Initialize two arrays (or one array for m and one for f) of integers of size 368 (index 0 to 367) to zeros.\n\n            For each event:\n                read a char and two integers.\n                if char is 'M': update m[a] += 2; m[b] -= 2;   (if a and b are in [0,367])\n                else: update f[a] +=2; f[b] -=2;\n\n            Then do prefix sums for m and f (from 0 to 367) and compute max_overlap = max_{i} min(prefix_m[i], prefix_f[i])\n\n            Then we know the second program would output \"NO\" and the third would output \"No\".\n\n            So we just output \"No\".\n\n        But wait: what if the first program fails? For example, if the input has an index out of bounds? We must be safe.\n\n        The problem says: the entire sequence. We must mimic the behavior. The original Python program would crash if a or b is >=368? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            We'll use arrays of size 368, and if a or b is >=368, then we skip? But the Python program does:\n\n                m[a] += 2 -> if a>=368, it would be out of bounds.\n\n            So we must assume that the input a and b are in [0, 367]? \n\n        The problem does not specify. However, the original program sets N=368. We'll do the same.\n\n        But note: the program uses b = int(b)+1. So if the input b is 367, then b becomes 368 -> which is out of bounds? \n\n        Therefore, we need to be careful: the array is of size 368 -> indices 0 to 367. \n\n        So if b becomes 368, then we try to update m[368] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n        How to fix? We can make the arrays of size 369 to be safe? \n\n        The original Python program: \n            m = [0] * N   -> size 368, indices 0..367.\n            Then if we get an event: \n                a = int(a) -> a in [0, 367] is safe? \n                b = int(b)+1 -> then b might be 368? \n\n            Then m[368] is accessed -> which is out of bounds? \n\n        Actually, in Python, if we do `m[368] = ...` on a list of size 368, we get an index error.\n\n        Therefore, we must extend the arrays to size 369? \n\n        The problem says: the original programs. So we must fix the C program to have the same behavior? \n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the input causes an index error in the Python, then the C program should also crash? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the input constraints. \n\n        We'll assume the input is valid? \n\n        But the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input is valid, then we must work. \n\n        We'll make the arrays of size 369 to avoid the crash? \n\n        The original Python program: \n            It uses indices from 0 to 367. The update at b: b = int(b)+1 -> so the maximum index we update is 367+1 = 368. \n\n        Therefore, we need an array of size at least 369? (0..368)\n\n        Actually, the prefix sum loop runs for i in range(N) -> which is 0 to 367. So we don't use m[368] in the prefix sum? \n\n        But the update: we do m[368] -=2. Then in the prefix sum: we only go to i=367. So the -2 at index 368 is never added? \n\n        That is a bug in the first program? \n\n        The first program uses a difference array technique:\n\n            We want to update [a, b-1] by adding 2? \n\n            The update: \n                m[a] += 2\n                m[b] -= 2   -> but b is set to int(b)+1 -> so the update at b is at the index = (original b)+1.\n\n            Then the prefix sum: \n                For i from 0 to 367: \n                    a += m[i]   -> so at i=b (which is the original b+1) we subtract 2? But we only run to 367. So if b is 368, then we skip m[368]? \n\n            Therefore, the update for the range [a, b-1] becomes [a, 367]? \n\n            This is not intended? \n\n        How should the difference array work? \n\n            We want to update the interval [a, b] (inclusive) -> then we do:\n                m[a] += 2\n                m[b+1] -= 2   -> but then we require the array to have index up to b+1.\n\n            And then when doing the prefix sum, we do for i from 0 to max_index (which should be at least b+1). \n\n            But the prefix sum loop only runs to 367. So if b+1 is 368, we update m[368] but then we don't include it in the prefix? \n\n            The effect: the update at m[368] is never added. So the prefix sums from a to 367 will be increased by 2, and beyond 367 we don't care? \n\n            Actually, we don't care beyond 367 because the problem only considers days 0..367.\n\n            Therefore, we can set the arrays to size 369 and then do the prefix sums from 0 to 367. The element at index 368 is not used in the prefix? \n\n            But we do:\n\n                for (i=0; i<368; i++) { ... }\n\n            So if we have an array of size 369, we only use indices 0..367.\n\n            Therefore, we can ignore the update at index 368? \n\n            But the update at index 368 is necessary to cancel the effect beyond 367? \n\n            Actually, the problem only requires the values for i in [0,367]. The update at index 368 is outside the range we are considering. So we don't need to do it? \n\n            But then the update for an event that ends at 367: \n                We do: m[367+1] = m[368] -=2 -> but we don't use m[368] in the prefix. So the prefix sum for m[367] will be the total for [0,367] without subtracting 2? \n\n            How should it be? \n\n            The difference array update for [a, b] (inclusive) is:\n\n                m[a] += 2\n                m[b+1] -= 2\n\n            Then the prefix sum at i is the sum of m[0] to m[i]. \n\n            For i < a: 0\n            For i in [a, b]: 2\n            For i > b: 0\n\n            But if b+1 is beyond 367, then we don't subtract 2 at the end? So for i>=a, we get 2? \n\n            That means the entire interval from a to 367 gets 2? \n\n            But the event is for [a, b] (so if b is 367, then we want the last day to be updated? \n\n            Then the update at m[b+1] is not done? \n\n            Actually, if b is 367, then b+1=368 -> we update m[368] but then we don't do the prefix for 368. So the prefix for i=367 is: \n                ... and we never subtract the 2? \n\n            Therefore, the event that ends at 367 would have the entire interval from a to 367 updated by 2, and then no cancellation? \n\n            That is correct? Because the event ends at 367, so day 367 is included. \n\n            But then what about the next day? We don't care.\n\n            However, the update at m[368] is necessary to cancel the effect for indices beyond 367? But we don't go beyond 367. So we don't need to do anything at 368? \n\n            Therefore, we can skip updating if the index is beyond 367? \n\n            But the original program does update m[b] even if b is 368? and then the array is only of size 368 -> so it crashes.\n\n        To avoid crash, we can:\n\n            Make the arrays of size 369 (so indices 0..368) and then in the prefix loop, we only go from 0 to 367.\n\n        Steps for C:\n\n            #define N 369   // 0..368, but we only use 0..367 in the prefix loop.\n\n            int m[N] = {0};\n            int f[N] = {0};\n\n            Then for each event:\n                read a char and two integers a_val, b_val.\n                int a = a_val;\n                int b = b_val + 1;   // because the Python does: b = int(b)+1\n\n                Then if a < N, update m[a] or f[a] by 2.\n                Then if b < N, update m[b] or f[b] by -2? \n\n            But if b>=N, then we skip? \n\n            Then do the prefix sum for i from 0 to 367 (so we don't go beyond 367).\n\n        However, the original Python program crashes if b>=368? \n\n        We are not required to handle out-of-bound inputs? \n\n        We'll assume the input b_val is at most 367? Then b = b_val+1 becomes 368 -> which is < 369? \n\n            So we update index 368.\n\n        Then in the prefix loop, we only do i from 0 to 367 -> so the update at 368 is not used? \n\n        That is acceptable because we don't care about index 368 in the prefix.\n\n        But note: the update at 368 is for the difference array: it is needed to cancel the effect beyond 367. Since we don't compute beyond 367, we don't need to update 368? \n\n        Actually, we do need to update 368 if we were to compute the prefix for 368? But we don't. So we can skip updating 368? \n\n        However, the original program updates m[368] even though it is beyond the array size? and crashes. \n\n        Therefore, to be identical, we must crash on an event that has b_val>=368? \n\n        But the problem says: \"when run on the same input\". If the input has b_val>=368, then the Python program crashes. So we should crash too? \n\n        How? In C, if we do:\n\n            int m[369];\n            then update m[368] is valid (index 368 is the last element, because 0..368 -> 369 elements).\n\n            But the Python program uses an array of size 368 -> indices 0..367 -> so updating m[368] causes an index error.\n\n        Therefore, to be identical, we must not extend the array? \n\n        We must use arrays of size 368? Then if we try to update index 368, we get undefined behavior? \n\n        How can we mimic the crash? \n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the Python program crashes, we should crash? \n\n        But the problem does not specify the input constraints. \n\n        We'll assume the input is valid and that b_val is at most 366? Then b_val+1 is at most 367? \n\n        But the problem does not say. \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            We'll use arrays of size 368 -> indices 0 to 367.\n\n            Then when updating:\n                if a < 0 || a >= 368 -> crash? \n                if b < 0 || b >= 368 -> crash?\n\n            How to crash? We can do:\n\n                m[a] += 2;   // if a is 368, then out of bounds -> undefined behavior? \n\n            But the problem says: the original program. The original program crashes. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check and abort? \n\n        However, the problem does not require us to handle errors. \n\n        We'll do as the original: use arrays of size 368 and update without bounds checking. \n\n        Then if an index is out of bounds, it will crash. \n\n        But in C, writing beyond the array is undefined behavior. \n\n        We'll hope the input is valid? \n\n        Since the problem says \"when run on the same input\", we assume the input is such that the Python program runs without crash? \n\n        We'll assume the input integers a and b_val are in the range [0, 366] so that a is in [0,367] and b = b_val+1 is in [0,367]? \n\n        Actually, a can be 0 to 367? and b_val can be 0 to 366? \n\n        How about a=367? then we update m[367] -> that's valid.\n\n        How about b_val=367? then b=367+1=368 -> which is out of bounds? \n\n        Therefore, the input must have b_val <= 366? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        We'll make the arrays of size 369 to avoid the crash? and then we do the prefix only for 0..367. \n\n        Why? Because the original program intended to have an array of size 368, but then they update at index b_val+1 which might be 368. \n\n        But the original program has a bug? \n\n        We are allowed to fix the bug? \n\n        The problem says: \"behaves identically\". So if the input has b_val=367, the original crashes. We must crash? \n\n        But the problem says: the entire sequence. And if the first program crashes, then the second and third are not run? \n\n        We are writing a single C program. We can do:\n\n            We'll use arrays of size 368 -> then if we update at 368, we get a segmentation fault? \n\n        That would be identical? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the input. \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            #define N 368   // as in the original\n\n            int m[N], f[N] = {0};\n\n            Then for each event:\n                we read a, b_val.\n                b = b_val + 1;\n                then we update:\n                    m[a] += 2;\n                    m[b] -= 2;   // if b>=N, then undefined behavior -> crash.\n\n        This matches the Python program.\n\n        Therefore, if the input has b_val>=368, the program crashes. \n\n        Now, the plan for the entire C program:\n\n            Step1: Read integer n.\n            Step2: For i=0 to n-1:\n                    read a char c and two integers a, b.\n                    let b2 = b+1;\n                    if c is 'M', then:\n                         m[a] += 2;\n                         m[b2] -= 2;   // if a or b2 is not in [0,367] then crash.\n                    else (then 'F'):\n                         f[a] += 2;\n                         f[b2] -= 2;\n\n            Step3: \n                    int a_sum = 0, b_sum = 0, c = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                         a_sum += m[i];\n                         b_sum += f[i];\n                         int min_val = (a_sum < b_sum) ? a_sum : b_sum;\n                         if (min_val > c) c = min_val;\n                    }\n\n            Step4: \n                    Now we have the integer c. We know the second program would output \"NO\", and the third program would output \"No\".\n\n            Step5: Print \"No\".\n\n        However, wait: what if the first program doesn't crash? then we compute c. Then we know the rest.\n\n        But note: what if the first program has an event that updates an index beyond 367? then we crash. So we don't get to step5.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n            #include <ctype.h>\n\n            #define N 368\n\n            int main() {\n                int n;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n                int m[N] = {0};\n                int f[N] = {0};\n\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    char c;\n                    int a, b_val;\n                    scanf(\" %c %d %d\", &c, &a, &b_val);   // note: the space in \" %c\" skips whitespace\n                    int b = b_val + 1;\n\n                    if (c == 'M') {\n                        m[a] += 2;\n                        m[b] -= 2;   // if a or b is out of [0,367] then undefined behavior (may crash)\n                    } else {\n                        f[a] += 2;\n                        f[b] -= 2;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                int a_sum = 0, b_sum = 0, c_val = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    a_sum += m[i];\n                    b_sum += f[i];\n                    int min_val = a_sum < b_sum ? a_sum : b_sum;\n                    if (min_val > c_val) {\n                        c_val = min_val;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Now, we know the second program would read the string of c_val and then output \"NO\", \n                // and the third program would read \"NO\" and output \"No\".\n\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        But note: the third program outputs \"No\" (without the exclamation mark). \n\n        However, the original third program outputs \"No\" (with a capital N and lowercase o). \n\n        Therefore, we output \"No\".\n\n        But wait: the original third program outputs \"No\", but the second program outputs \"NO\" (all caps) and the third program gets \"NO\" and then outputs \"No\" (which is different from \"NO\")? \n\n        The third program: \n            if the string is \"NO\", then it outputs \"No\" (because the condition fails: the counts are 1 and 1, not 2) -> so it prints \"No\".\n\n        So we output \"No\".\n\n        However, the problem says: the entire sequence. The final output is \"No\".\n\n        Therefore, the above C program is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the second program did output \"YES\"? Then the third program would output \"No\" as well? \n\n        But we know the second program always outputs \"NO\", so the third program always outputs \"No\".\n\n        Therefore, we can skip the simulation of the second and third programs and just output \"No\".\n\n        However, what if the first program outputs a number that ends with a vowel? \n\n        We proved that the string representation of the integer c_val ends with a digit, which is not a vowel. So the second program always outputs \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, the above program is correct.\n\n        But note: the first program might output a negative number? \n\n            The prefix sums: m and f arrays are updated with positive and negative, but the values at each index are integers? \n\n            However, the computed min_val: we are taking min of two integers that might be negative? \n\n            But the events: we start at 0 and then add the differences. The differences are +2 and -2. \n\n            The prefix sums might become negative? \n\n            Example: \n                event: M 10 20 -> then m[10] +=2, m[21] -=2.\n                then at i<10: 0.\n                i=10: 2.\n                i=11: 2 (until i=20)\n                i=21: 0? but we subtract 2 at m[21] -> then at i=21: a_sum = 0? \n\n            But what if we have two events: \n                event1: M 10 20 -> m[10]=2, m[21]=-2.\n                event2: M 0 5 -> m[0]=2, m[6]=-2.\n\n            Then at i=0: a_sum=2 -> positive.\n            at i=5: a_sum=2.\n            at i=6: a_sum=0.\n            at i=10: a_sum=2.\n\n            How about an event that starts at 100 and ends at 50? That doesn't make sense. The input a and b_val: we assume a<=b_val? \n\n            The problem does not specify. The original program does not sort. \n\n            Example: \n                event: M 50 10 -> then a=50, b=10+1=11.\n                Then we update m[50] +=2, m[11] -=2.\n\n            Then the prefix sums:\n                from 0 to 10: 0.\n                at 11: -2.\n                ... until 49: -2.\n                at 50: 0? (because -2+2=0).\n\n            Then the min_val at each step: \n                at i=11 to 49: the value is -2 -> which is negative.\n\n            Then the maximum min_val? It starts at 0, then we see negative values -> so the maximum remains 0.\n\n            Therefore, the min_val can be negative.\n\n            But then the output c_val might be negative? \n\n            Then the string representation of a negative number: for example, if c_val=-5, then the string is \"-5\". \n\n            The second program: \n                It traverses from the end: \n                    last character: '5' -> not vowel -> output \"NO\".\n\n            So even if negative, the last character is a digit -> not vowel.\n\n            Therefore, the second program still outputs \"NO\".\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        Conclusion: the C program:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #define N 368\n\n            int main() {\n                int n;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n                int m[N], f[N];\n                // Initialize to zero\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    m[i] = 0;\n                    f[i] = 0;\n                }\n\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    char c;\n                    int a, b_val;\n                    // Read the event: note the input might have spaces? \n                    // Format: one char, then two integers. The Python splits by space.\n                    // The input line: \"M 1 2\" or \"F 1 2\"\n                    scanf(\" %c %d %d\", &c, &a, &b_val);\n                    int b = b_val + 1;\n\n                    if (c == 'M') {\n                        m[a] += 2;\n                        if (b < N) {\n                            m[b] -= 2;\n                        }\n                        // If b>=N, we skip? but the original program would crash? \n                        // Actually, the original program uses a list of size 368 -> index b must be <368.\n                        // So we assume b < N. If not, we skip to avoid crash? \n                        // But to be identical, we must crash. \n                        // We'll do: m[b] -=2; without check -> if b>=N, then undefined behavior -> crash.\n                    } else {\n                        f[a] += 2;\n                        f[b] -= 2;   // same as above\n                    }\n                }\n\n                int a_sum = 0, b_sum = 0;\n                int max_overlap = 0;   // c in the first program\n\n                for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n                    a_sum += m[i];\n                    b_sum += f[i];\n                    int min_val = a_sum < b_sum ? a_sum : b_sum;\n                    if (min_val > max_overlap) {\n                        max_overlap = min_val;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // The rest of the chain: we know the second program outputs \"NO\", the third outputs \"No\"\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, to be absolutely safe and avoid the crash for b>=N, we can note that the original program would crash. So we want to crash? \n\n        But in C, if we write to m[b] with b>=N, it is undefined behavior. It might crash, or it might not. \n\n        We can do bounds checking to mimic the Python:\n\n            if (a >= N || a < 0 || b >= N || b < 0) {\n                // We can force a crash: \n                int *p = NULL;\n                *p = 0;   // segmentation fault\n            }\n\n        But the problem does not require that. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if (a < 0 || a >= N) {\n                // crash\n                int x = 10 / 0;   // division by zero -> crash? \n            }\n\n        But division by zero is undefined and might not crash.\n\n        We'll assume the input is valid and within bounds.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem says \"on the same input\", we assume the input has a and b_val such that a in [0,367] and b_val in [0,366] so that b = b_val+1 is in [0,367].\n\n        Therefore, we do the updates without bounds checks.\n\n        But note: the input a and b_val might be negative? \n\n            The first program: it uses the negative index? then it would crash. \n\n            In C, negative index is undefined.\n\n        We'll assume nonnegative.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #define N 368\n\n            int main() {\n                int n;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                int m[N] = {0}; // initializes to zero\n                int f[N] = {0};\n\n                char type;\n                int a_val, b_val;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    scanf(\" %c %d %d\", &type, &a_val, &b_val);\n                    int b = b_val + 1;\n\n                    if (type == 'M') {\n                        m[a_val] += 2;\n                        m[b] -= 2;\n                    } else { // 'F'\n                        f[a_val] += 2;\n                        f[b] -= 2;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                int m_sum = 0, f_sum = 0;\n                int max_overlap = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                    m_sum += m[i];\n                    f_sum += f[i];\n                    int current_min = m_sum < f_sum ? m_sum : f_sum;\n                    if (current_min > max_overlap) {\n                        max_overlap = current_min;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // The rest of the chain: second program and third program always lead to \"No\"\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n        However, note: the first program reads the entire line with `input()[: - 1].split()`. This removes the last character (which is the newline) and then splits. \n\n        But we are using `scanf(\" %c %d %d\")` which will work for the format: \n            \"M 1 2\\n\"\n\n        The space in front of %c skips any leading whitespace (including the newline from the previous line). \n\n        But the first read is the integer n, then we read n lines. \n\n        After reading n, the next character is the newline? Then the first `scanf(\" %c ...\")` will skip that newline.\n\n        Therefore, it is safe.\n\n        Let me test with an example input:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                M 1 2\n                F 3 4\n\n            After reading n=2, the next character is the newline. Then the first event: \n                \" %c\" will skip the newline and then read 'M'. Then read 1 and 2.\n\n            Then the next event: \n                the next character after the first event is the newline? then \" %c\" will skip it and read 'F'. \n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above C program.\n\n        Note: the third program outputs \"No\", which is the final answer.\n\n        But the original chain: the first program prints an integer, the second program prints \"NO\", the third program prints \"No\". \n\n        Our program does not output the integer and the \"NO\", but the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\".\n\n        And we are only allowed to do I/O at the beginning and the end.\n\n        Therefore, we skip the intermediate outputs.\n\n        We are simulating the entire chain and producing the same final output.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Final code:"
