Therefore, if the second program outputs 7, then we form (5,5,7) and then the condition becomes: count of 5 is 2 and sum is 17 -> then we print 'YES'. Otherwise, we print 'NO'. So the third program becomes: \n        if (y == 7) then print \"YES\"\n        else print \"NO\"\n\n   But wait, what if the three integers are not (5,5,7) but (5,5,7) is hard-coded based on y=7? However, the third program is given as:\n\n        ABC = tuple(...) if ABC.count(5)==2:\n            print('YES' if sum(ABC)==17 else 'NO')\n        else:\n            print('NO') If we let ABC = (5, 5, y), then:\n        count of 5 is 2. then we print 'YES' if 10+y==17, i.e., y==7, else 'NO'.

And only the first block reads input. And there are no intermediate I/O. And the final output is only at the end. We hope this is what the problem intended. Let's do it. Steps in C:\n\n   Step1: read n and k.\n   Step2: read n integers into an array. Step3: sort the array (only the first k elements matter) and sum the first k.\n   Step4: compute y = 0;\n          for i from 1 to x (which is the sum from step3) {\n              term = i * (x / i) * (x / i + 1) / 2;\n              y += term;\n          }\n   Step5: if (y == 7) then printf(\"YES\\n\"); else printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain uses the output of the first program as N.

The original second program in Python would also be slow for x=10^9. However, note the original second program in the provided Python code reads:\n\n        N = ri()\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(1, N+1):\n            ans += i * (N // i) * (N // i + 1) // 2\n\n   This is O(N) and for N up to 10^9, it is too slow.

But note: the problem does not specify constraints on n and k, but the integers in the list can be large? However, the first program: we are only summing k smallest, so x might be large. We will use the optimized version for the second program. Let's write the C program accordingly. Steps:\n\n       1. Read n and k.\n       2. Read n integers into an array. 3. Sort the array and sum the first k -> x.\n       4. Compute y using the optimized divisor-sum method for the second program, using x.\n       5. If y == 7, then print \"YES\", else print \"NO\". We hope this is what the problem intended. Note: This is based on the manufactured input (5,5,y) for the third program. If the problem intended something else, then this solution may be wrong. Given the ambiguity, we do our best. Let's code accordingly.",

Actually, the problem says the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n But looking at the programs:\n   Program 1: reads two integers (n, k) and then a list of n integers. It prints the sum of the k smallest numbers.\n   Program 2: reads an integer N and then computes an answer (without any further input). But note: the output of program1 is a single integer (the sum). So program2 will read that integer as N.\n   Program 3: reads three integers (a tuple of three) and then checks conditions.\n\n However, the chain of execution is:\n   Input for the entire chain: \n        First, the input for program1: two integers (n, k) and then n integers.\n        Then, the output of program1 (a single integer) is fed as input to program2.\n        Then, the output of program2 (a single integer) is fed as input to program3? But program3 expects three integers.\n\n This is inconsistent because the output of program2 is one integer, but program3 expects three integers.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: \n   \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the chain is:\n   Input to the entire system: the input for the first program.\n   Then the output of the first program becomes the input for the second program.\n   Then the output of the second program becomes the input for the third program.\n\n Therefore, the input to the second program is the output of the first (a single integer), and the input to the third program is the output of the second (a single integer). But the third program expects three integers.\n\n This discrepancy suggests that the chain might not be correctly designed? However, the problem states that we have a set of programs executed in sequence.\n\n How can we resolve?\n   Looking at the third program: it expects three integers. But the second program outputs one integer.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the chain is not linear? The problem says \"a single C program\" that reproduces the same behavior.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Translate the *entire sequence*\".\n\n After reevaluating the problem, it says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So:\n\n   Program1: reads input (from stdin) and writes output (to stdout) -> let that output be S1.\n   Program2: reads S1 (from stdin) and writes output (to stdout) -> let that output be S2.\n   Program3: reads S2 (from stdin) and writes output (to stdout). But wait, S2 is one integer, but program3 expects three.\n\n This is a problem.\n\n However, let me look at the original Python code:\n\n   File 1: \n        n, k = map(int, input().split())\n        # then reads the next line: a list of n integers\n        print(sum(sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))[: k]))\n\n        Example input for the first program:\n            \"3 2\"\n            \"1 4 2\"\n        Output: 1+2 = 3 -> prints \"3\"\n\n   File 2: \n        It reads an integer N. So if the output of the first program is \"3\", then N=3.\n        Then it computes: \n            for i from 1 to N: ans += i * (N//i) * (N//i+1) // 2\n        For N=3: \n            i=1: 1 * (3//1=3) * (4) //2 = 1*3*4//2 = 6\n            i=2: 2 * (3//2=1) * (2) //2 = 2*1*2//2 = 2\n            i=3: 3 * (3//3=1) * (2) //2 = 3*1*2//2 = 3\n            total = 6+2+3 = 11 -> prints \"11\"\n\n   File 3:\n        It reads three integers? But the output of the second program is \"11\", which is one integer.\n\n        The code: \n            ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n            # This expects at least three integers? But we have only one.\n\n        This will cause an error.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the chain is not as I thought? The problem states: \"the entire sequence\". \n\n But the problem also says: \"when run on the same input\".\n\n How were the original programs run? \n   They are run in sequence, with the output of the first being the input to the second, and the output of the second being the input to the third.\n\n So the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program. The second program gets the output of the first as its entire stdin. The third program gets the output of the second as its entire stdin.\n\n Therefore, the third program would get the string \"11\" (or \"11\\n\") as its input. Then:\n\n   ABC = tuple(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   This would split the string \"11\" (or \"11\\n\") -> we get one token: ['11'] -> but we need three for the tuple.\n\n This will crash.\n\n So there is a logical error in the problem? \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the third program is not meant to take the output of the second? But the problem says the entire sequence.\n\n After re-reading the problem: \"Translate the *entire sequence* into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And: \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n But note: the original chain (if run as described) would break at the third program.\n\n However, let me see the third program in isolation: it expects three integers. \n\n How can we fix? \n\n I see two possibilities:\n\n 1. The problem has a mistake in the chain. \n 2. The third program is actually independent? But the problem says \"sequence\".\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the input to the entire chain is the same as the input to the first program, and then the entire chain runs without any intermediate I/O (so we are to combine the three programs as if they were functions, and the output of the first function is passed as input to the second, and the output of the second is passed as input to the third, and the third produces the final output). But the third program requires three integers, and the second produces one.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" and \"Only the last block should handle producing output.\".\n\n Therefore, we must read all the input at the beginning (for the first program) and then pass the intermediate values without I/O, and then the last program produces the output.\n\n How about we reinterpret the chain:\n\n   The entire input for the chain is the input that the first program originally reads, plus the input that the third program originally reads? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n This implies that the input to the chain is only the input for the first program. The second program gets the output of the first, and the third gets the output of the second.\n\n So the third program cannot have its own independent input.\n\n Therefore, the third program must be able to run with the single integer from the second program? But it expects three.\n\n After reading the third program: \n   It checks if there are two 5's and the sum is 17. \n\n How can one integer be two 5's and a third number? \n\n This does not make sense.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:\n\n   The input to the entire chain is the input for the first program (which is two integers and then a list of integers) AND the input for the third program (which is three integers) at the same time? \n\n But that is not how the sequence is described.\n\n Given the confusion, I will look at the provided Python code and the intended behavior.\n\n The problem says: \"the entire sequence\". We have three files. The first file reads two integers and then a list of n integers. The second file reads an integer. The third file reads three integers.\n\n How can we combine?\n\n   We must read at the beginning:\n        n, k\n        then n integers (for the first program)\n        then three integers for the third program? \n\n But note: the second program uses the output of the first, and the third program uses the output of the second.\n\n However, the third program also requires input? But the problem says only the first block reads input.\n\n This suggests that the entire input must be read at the beginning. Then:\n\n   Step1: use the first part of the input (n, k and the list) to compute the first output (let it be x).\n   Step2: use x to compute the second output (let it be y) without reading any more input.\n   Step3: then we have the three integers for the third program? But we haven't read them.\n\n So we must read the three integers at the beginning as well.\n\n Therefore, the entire input is:\n        first line: n, k\n        second line: n integers\n        third line: three integers (for the third program)\n\n But note: the third program in the original chain would not run until after the second program, and the second program only outputs one integer. However, in the chain, the third program would not have the original three integers available because the input stream for the third program is the output of the second.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n After rethinking the problem: \n   The problem states: \"the entire sequence\" and \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". \n\n   This means that the input for the entire chain is the input for the first program. The second program takes the output of the first program as its input. The third program takes the output of the second program as its input.\n\n   Therefore, the third program does not have access to the original input of the first program.\n\n   But in the provided third program, it reads three integers. How can we get three integers from the output of the second program (which is one integer)? \n\n   We cannot.\n\n Given the above, I suspect there is a misunderstanding in the problem. However, let me look at the third program again:\n\n   It checks: if there are two 5's and the sum is 17, then it prints 'YES' if the sum is 17 (which is redundant) else 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.\n\n   But note: the output of the second program is one integer. How can we form a tuple of three integers from one integer?\n\n   We can't. \n\n Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the chain is not as described? Or the third program is not intended to be run with the output of the second.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the third program is run with the same initial input? But that contradicts the \"sequence\" with I/O redirection.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I will stick to the specification: \n   Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   We read all input at the beginning.\n\n   But what input do we read? We must read everything that the first program and the third program would have read, because the second program doesn't read any external input beyond the output of the first.\n\n   The first program reads:\n        n, k\n        then a list of n integers.\n\n   The third program, if run standalone, would read one line of three integers.\n\n   So the input for the entire chain is:\n        Line1: n, k\n        Line2: the list of n integers for the first program\n        Line3: three integers for the third program\n\n   However, the second program reads the output of the first program (which is an integer) and then produces an integer. The third program then uses that integer? But the third program is written to read three integers.\n\n   This does not match.\n\n Another possibility: the third program is not meant to be in the chain? But the problem says entire sequence of three files.\n\n After careful thought, I notice that the second program does not use any input beyond the integer N (which comes from the first program's output). The third program, however, is independent of the first two? But the problem says sequence.\n\n Given the time, I will interpret the problem as follows:\n\n   The entire input consists of:\n        First: two integers n and k.\n        Second: a list of n integers.\n        Third: three integers (for the third program).\n\n   But then how is the chain formed?\n        Step1: run the first program on the first two lines -> output x (an integer).\n        Step2: run the second program on x -> output y (an integer).\n        Step3: run the third program on the three integers (from the third line) and then produce the output.\n\n   However, that breaks the chain because the output of the second program is not used as input to the third.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that the third program should use the output of the second program as its input? But then we don't have the three integers.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   We read:\n        n, k\n        the list of n integers\n        and then we also read three integers (for the third program) but then ignore them and use the output of the second program as the input to the third? \n\n   But then the third program would have only one integer, not three.\n\n   Or: the third program should be modified to take one integer? But the problem says to reproduce the same behavior.\n\n Given the lack of clarity, I will assume that the problem has a typo and the third program is not part of the chain? Or that the chain is only the first two programs? \n\n But the problem says three files.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the third program is meant to be run with the output of the second program and the two integers from the first program? But that is not what the code does.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem: \"the entire sequence\"\n\n I think the intended chain might be:\n\n   Input for the first program: n, k and then the list of n integers -> output: an integer (sum of k smallest)\n   Input for the second program: that integer (as N) -> output: another integer (the computed ans)\n   Input for the third program: that second integer? But then the third program expects three integers.\n\n This is impossible.\n\n Therefore, I must conclude that the third program is not connected in the chain and is independent. But the problem states a sequence.\n\n Given the instructions, I will design the C program as follows:\n\n   We will read the input for the first program and the input for the third program at the beginning.\n\n   Then we will compute the first program's output (call it x) without printing it.\n   Then we will compute the second program's output using x (call it y) without printing it.\n   Then we will compute the third program's output using the three integers we read for it (not using y) and then print that.\n\n   But that breaks the chain because the third program should use y.\n\n   Or: the third program should use y as its input? Then how to get three integers from one?\n\n   The third program code:\n\n        if ABC.count(5) == 2:\n            print('YES' if sum(ABC) == 17 else 'NO')\n        else:\n            print('NO')\n\n   If we are to use the output of the second program (y) as the input to the third, then we would have to form a tuple of three integers from y? \n\n   But the third program expects to read three integers from stdin. We could reinterpret the one integer y as three integers by splitting its digits? Not specified.\n\n   This is not defined.\n\n Given the above, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement or the provided programs.\n\n However, I notice that the second program uses a module that reads from stdin. But in the chain, its stdin is the output of the first. Similarly, the third program reads from stdin, which would be the output of the second.\n\n So in the chain, the third program would get one integer (from the output of the second) and then try to split that into three tokens. That would fail.\n\n Therefore, the only way to make sense is to assume that the third program is not meant to be in the chain? But the problem includes it.\n\n Given the time, I will do the following:\n\n   We combine the first two programs as described, and then for the third program, we note that it requires three integers. But the output of the second program is one integer. \n\n   How about we use the one integer to create three integers by replicating it? \n\n   But the third program checks for two 5's and a total sum of 17.\n\n   Example: if the second program outputs 5, then we could form (5,5,5) -> sum=15 -> then we would get: count of 5 is 3 -> prints 'NO'. \n   Or (5,5,x) such that 5+5+x=17 -> x=7. But how would we get 7? \n\n   We don't have any other input.\n\n   Therefore, unless the second program outputs 7 and we form (5,5,7) arbitrarily, we cannot get a sum of 17. And why 5 and 5? \n\n   This is not the intended behavior.\n\n I think the problem might have a mistake. Given the instructions, I will assume that the third program is independent and should be run with its own input, which we read at the beginning along with the first program's input.\n\n And then the chain is not as described for the third program? \n\n But the problem says: \"the entire sequence\".\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that the output of the second program is not the only input to the third, but the third also gets additional input? But that contradicts \"only the first block reads input\".\n\n Given the confusion, I will seek clarification in the problem: \"Only the first block should handle reading input.\" -> so we read everything at the beginning.\n\n   We read:\n        n, k\n        list of n integers\n        three integers (for the third program)\n\n   Then we do:\n        x = first_program(n, k, list)\n        y = second_program(x)\n        then we run the third program on the three integers we read (and ignore y) -> but then the chain is broken.\n\n   Or we do:\n        x = first_program(n, k, list)\n        y = second_program(x)\n        then we run the third program on (y, ?, ?) -> but we don't have additional values.\n\n   We only have the three integers read at the beginning for the third program. How about we use those three integers along with y? \n\n   But the third program is designed to read exactly three integers.\n\n   The only way to use y in the third program is to replace one of the three integers with y? Not specified.\n\n Given the above, I decide to follow the specification literally:\n\n   The entire input is read by the first block.\n\n   The first block reads:\n        - two integers: n and k.\n        - then a list of n integers.\n        - then three integers for the third program.\n\n   But note: the third program in the chain should receive the output of the second program as its input. However, we have read three integers for it. This is additional input that would not be available in the chain if the second program's output is being piped.\n\n   Therefore, I think the problem might have a mistake in the provided third program: it should not be reading three integers but one, and then do something else.\n\n   Since we cannot change the logic of the third program, and given the instructions to only have the first block read input, we must read the three integers at the beginning. \n\n   Then how to pass the output of the second program to the third? \n\n   We could overwrite the three integers with the output of the second program? But then we lose the read data.\n\n   Or: the third program should use the output of the second program in place of its stdin? But it expects three integers.\n\n   I see no solution.\n\n Given the time constraints, I will assume that the third program is not part of the chain in the way of the second program's output, but rather uses the three integers read at the beginning. \n\n And the chain is defined as:\n\n   Input -> first program (n, k and list) -> output x\n   then second program (using x) -> output y\n   then third program (using the three integers read at the beginning) -> output z\n\n   Then the final output is z.\n\n   But then the output of the second program (y) is not used by the third program.\n\n   This breaks the chain of \"output of each program is input to the next\".\n\n   However, it's the only way to use the three integers for the third program.\n\n Therefore, the problem must have intended that the three integers for the third program are read at the beginning, and the third program does not use the output of the second.\n\n But then why is it in the chain?\n\n I think there might be a mistake in the problem.\n\n Given the above, I will output a C program that does the following:\n\n   Step1: read n and k.\n   Step2: read n integers.\n   Step3: read three integers (call them a, b, c).\n\n   Step4: compute the first program's output (sum of the k smallest) -> x.\n   Step5: compute the second program's output using x as N -> y.\n   Step6: run the third program on (a, b, c) (ignore y) and print the result.\n\n   But then the chain is not as described: the second program's output is not used as input to the third.\n\n   Alternatively, if the problem intended that the three integers for the third program are to be read after the first program's output and before the second program's output, then the second program would not see the first program's output but the three integers.\n\n   This is messy.\n\n Given the provided sample of Python programs and the lack of clarity, I will instead assume that the chain is only the first two programs, and the third program is a separate unit that is not in the chain? But the problem says three files.\n\n I think the problem might have intended to have only two programs, but there are three files.\n\n After reexamine the instruction: \"You are given a set of Python programs that are meant to be executed in sequence\"\n\n The provided set has three programs.\n\n How about we treat the third program as using the output of the second program as one of its inputs? \n\n   The third program requires three integers. We have one integer from the second program and three integers read from the beginning. \n\n   But we read three integers for the third program, so we have four integers? \n\n   This is not matching.\n\n Given the above, I will do the following:\n\n   We read:\n        n, k\n        list of n integers\n        then we do not read anything else.\n\n   Then:\n        x = first program (n, k, list)\n        y = second program (x)\n        then we have to run the third program on three integers. But we only have y.\n\n   So we form a tuple of three integers as (y, y, y) or (y, 5, 5) or something else? \n\n   The third program: \n        if there are two 5's and the sum is 17 -> then print 'YES' if the sum==17 else 'NO'. \n        else 'NO'.\n\n   For the formed tuple to have two 5's and sum 17, we would need:\n        two 5's and one 7.\n\n   So if we form (5,5,y) then the sum is 10+y. We need 10+y==17 -> y=7.\n\n   Therefore, if the second program outputs 7, then we form (5,5,7) and then the condition becomes: count of 5 is 2 and sum is 17 -> then we print 'YES'.\n\n   Otherwise, we print 'NO'.\n\n   So the third program becomes: \n        if (y == 7) then print \"YES\"\n        else print \"NO\"\n\n   But wait, what if the three integers are not (5,5,7) but (5,5,7) is hard-coded based on y=7? \n\n   However, the third program is given as:\n\n        ABC = tuple(...)\n        if ABC.count(5)==2:\n            print('YES' if sum(ABC)==17 else 'NO')\n        else:\n            print('NO')\n\n   If we let ABC = (5, 5, y), then:\n        count of 5 is 2.\n        then we print 'YES' if 10+y==17, i.e., y==7, else 'NO'.\n\n   So it is equivalent to: if y==7 then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n   But is that the intended behavior of the third program? \n\n   In the original standalone third program, it would only print YES if the input was three integers that include exactly two 5's and the sum is 17.\n\n   In our chain, we are (5,5,y) and we want to know if it has two 5's and sum 17. This is satisfied only when y==7.\n\n   Therefore, we can simulate the third program with input (5,5,y) and then its output is \"YES\" if y==7, else \"NO\".\n\n   But note: the original third program might have received (5,5,7) and then output \"YES\", or (5,5,8) and output \"NO\", or (5,6,6) and output \"NO\", etc.\n\n   In our chain, we are not reading three integers for the third program. We are manufacturing them from y.\n\n   This is a stretch, but it maintains the chain: the output of the second program is used as input to the third.\n\n   And we only read input in the first block: we read n, k and the list of n integers. We do not read three integers for the third program.\n\n   So the input is only what the first program reads.\n\n   Then the chain becomes:\n        first program: uses the input to compute x.\n        second program: uses x to compute y.\n        third program: uses y to form the tuple (5,5,y) and then does its check.\n\n   This is the only way to have the third program use the output of the second and not read any extra input.\n\n   And it is consistent with the third program's code if we consider that its stdin is the string \"5 5 <y>\" (but note we are not reading, we are forming in memory).\n\n   Therefore, the C program will:\n\n        Step1: read n and k.\n        Step2: read n integers.\n\n        Step3: compute x = sum of the k smallest of the n integers.\n        Step4: compute y = second_program(x) [which is the sum for i=1..y_part (here y_part=x) of i*(x//i)*(x//i+1)//2]\n        Step5: set a=5, b=5, c=y.\n        Step6: if (a==5 and b==5) and (a+b+c==17) -> then print \"YES\"\n                but wait, it's not a and b, it's count of 5 in the tuple (a,b,c). Since a=5, b=5, then we have two 5's. Then if the sum is 17, then print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n        Alternatively, since we know a=5 and b=5, then the condition is simply: if (c == 7) then print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        if (y == 7)\n            printf(\"YES\\n\");\n        else\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n   But note: what if the tuple is (5, y, 5)? Then we would still have two 5's. In our formation we have (5,5,y) so two 5's regardless of y.\n\n   And the condition then is: two 5's -> then we check the sum: 5+5+y = 10+y. We need 10+y==17 -> y==7.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply:\n\n        if (y == 7)\n            printf(\"YES\\n\");\n        else\n            printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n   But wait, what if the second program outputs 7 in a context where the input had nothing to do with 5's? \n\n   This is a transformation of the original programs.\n\n   However, the original chain would have:\n        Program1: output x\n        Program2: input x, output y\n        Program3: input y (as a string) and then try to split it into three integers -> it will fail because there is only one integer.\n\n   So the original chain would crash on the third program.\n\n   Therefore, the only way to have a working chain is to change the third program to take one integer and then decide based on that.\n\n   Given the above, I will assume that the intended behavior of the third program in the chain is to check if the input integer is 7.\n\n   This is a big assumption.\n\n Given the time, I will output a C program that does the following:\n\n        reads n and k.\n        reads n integers.\n        compute x = sum of the k smallest.\n        compute y = for i=1 to x: y += i * (x/i) * (x/i+1) / 2.\n        if y==7 then printf(\"YES\\n\") else printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n   This matches the manufactured tuple (5,5,y) having sum 17 exactly when y==7.\n\n   And it doesn't require reading extra integers.\n\n   And it maintains the chain: \n        the output of the first program (x) is used by the second program to compute y.\n        the output of the second program (y) is used by the third program to decide the output.\n\n   And only the first block reads input.\n\n   And there are no intermediate I/O.\n\n   And the final output is only at the end.\n\n   We hope this is what the problem intended.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n Steps in C:\n\n   Step1: read n and k.\n   Step2: read n integers into an array.\n   Step3: sort the array (only the first k elements matter) and sum the first k.\n   Step4: compute y = 0;\n          for i from 1 to x (which is the sum from step3) {\n              term = i * (x / i) * (x / i + 1) / 2;\n              y += term;\n          }\n   Step5: if (y == 7) then printf(\"YES\\n\"); else printf(\"NO\\n\");\n\n However, note: the second program in the chain uses the output of the first program as N. In our case, x is that output.\n\n   In the second program: \n        N = ri()   # which is x\n        then computes for i in [1, N]: ... \n\n   But note: if x is large, the loop from 1 to x might be very slow.\n\n   We need to optimize the second program. The original second program in C would be:\n\n        long long y = 0;\n        for (int i=1; i<=x; i++) {\n            long long t = x / i;\n            y += (long long)i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n        }\n\n   But if x is large (like up to 10^9), then looping to x is not feasible.\n\n   The original second program in Python would also be slow for x=10^9.\n\n   However, note the original second program in the provided Python code reads:\n\n        N = ri()\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(1, N+1):\n            ans += i * (N // i) * (N // i + 1) // 2\n\n   This is O(N) and for N up to 10^9, it is too slow.\n\n   We must optimize it. We can use a common optimization for divisor sums: by iterating in ranges where N//i is constant.\n\n   How to do that?\n\n        We know that for i in [1, N], the value of t = N // i is non-increasing.\n\n        Let i run from 1 to N, but we can jump: \n            Let j = N // (N // i)   [which is the last index with the same t]\n\n        Then we can compute the sum for i in [i0, j] at once.\n\n        But note: the term is: i * t * (t+1) // 2, but t is constant for i in [i0, j].\n\n        So the sum over i in [i0, j] of i is: (i0+j)*(j-i0+1)/2.\n\n        Then the contribution is: (t*(t+1)//2) * (sum of i in [i0, j]).\n\n        So:\n\n            long long y = 0;\n            for (long long i = 1, j; i <= x; i = j+1) {\n                long long t = x / i;\n                j = x / t;   // the last i with x/i = t\n                long long sum_i = (i+j) * (j-i+1) / 2;   // sum of integers from i to j\n                y += sum_i * t * (t+1) / 2;\n            }\n\n   But wait, the original term is: for each i, we add: i * t * (t+1) // 2.\n\n   And note: the factor (t*(t+1)/2) is constant for the range [i, j]. So we can factor that out and multiply by the sum of i in the range.\n\n   This is valid.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute y in O(sqrt(x)).\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify constraints on n and k, but the integers in the list can be large? However, the first program: we are only summing k smallest, so x might be large.\n\n   We will use the optimized version for the second program.\n\n   Let's write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n       1. Read n and k.\n       2. Read n integers into an array.\n       3. Sort the array and sum the first k -> x.\n       4. Compute y using the optimized divisor-sum method for the second program, using x.\n       5. If y == 7, then print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n   We hope this is what the problem intended.\n\n   Note: This is based on the manufactured input (5,5,y) for the third program.\n\n   If the problem intended something else, then this solution may be wrong.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we do our best.\n\n   Let's code accordingly."
