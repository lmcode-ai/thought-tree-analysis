Step 6: Compute gcd(360, secondResult). Then, result = 360 / gcd(360, secondResult). Step 7: Print the result. Important: We must not do any I/O in between. Let's code accordingly. Note: We must be cautious about the string conversion. We need to allocate enough space for the string representation of c.

Actually, no: c could be large? but the digit sum is at most 45 for 5 digits? Actually, no: if c has 1000000, then the digit sum is 1. But wait, the second step: if c is 1000000, then the string is \"1000000\", which is not in the list (the list only has \"10\", \"100\", ... up to \"100000\"), so we do digit sum: 1+0+0+0+0+0+0=1. So the secondResult is at most 45? (because the maximum digit sum for a number with 6 digits is 9*6=54, but our list catches the ones that are all zeros except the first one? so the digit sum for numbers not in the list: minimum is 1, maximum? 54?). So we can use iterative gcd without worrying about recursion depth. Alternatively, we can write iterative:\n\n          int gcd_iterative(int a, int b) {\n              while (b) {\n                  int temp = a % b;\n                  a = b;\n                  b = temp;\n              }\n              return a;\n          }\n\n      But note: the gcd for (360,0) should be 360. The iterative version: \n          a=360, b=0 -> then the while loop doesn't run -> returns 360. So we use iterative. Code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          while (b != 0) {\n              int temp = a % b;\n              a = b;\n              b = temp;\n          }\n          return a;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n          int c_val = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              if (a >= b) {\n                  c_val += a;\n                  a--;\n              } else {\n                  c_val += b;\n                  b--;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Convert c_val to string\n          char str_c[20];\n          sprintf(str_c, \"%d\", c_val);\n\n          // Predefined list for the second step\n          const char *list [] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n          int is_in_list = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n              if (strcmp(str_c, list[i]) == 0) {\n                  is_in_list = 1;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          int secondResult;\n          if (is_in_list) {\n              secondResult = 10;\n          } else {\n              secondResult = 0;\n              for (int i = 0; str_c[i] ! = '\\0'; i++) {\n                  secondResult += str_c[i] - '0';\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now compute the result for the third step\n          int g = gcd(360, secondResult);\n          int result = 360 / g;\n\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the gcd function must handle the case when secondResult is 0? \n        gcd(360,0) -> returns 360, then 360/360=1 -> correct. Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: input \"2 1\"\n          c_val = 2 (first iteration: a=2, b=1 -> add 2, then a becomes 1) \n                   second iteration: a=1, b=1 -> add 1 -> total=3.\n          str_c = \"3\"\n          not in list -> secondResult = 3.\n          gcd(360,3): \n              360 % 3 = 0 -> so gcd(3,0)=3 -> result=360/3=120 -> output 120. Example 2: input \"1 2\" -> same as above -> 120. Example 3: input \"10 10\"\n          first: a=10, b=10 -> add 10, then a becomes 9.\n          second: a=9, b=10 -> add 10, then b becomes 9 -> total=20. str_c=\"20\" -> not in list -> secondResult=2+0=2. gcd(360,2)=2 -> result=360/2=180. Example 4: input \"5 5\"\n          first: add 5 -> a becomes 4; second: max(4,5)=5 -> total=10.\n          str_c=\"10\" -> in list -> secondResult=10. gcd(360,10)=10 -> result=360/10=36. Example 5: input \"0 0\"\n          first: max(0,0)=0 -> c_val=0; then a becomes -1? but then second iteration: max(-1,0)=0 -> c_val=0. Then string \"0\" -> not in list -> secondResult=0. gcd(360,0)=360 -> 360/360=1 -> output 1. But wait: the original first program for \"0 0\":\n          a=0, b=0 -> first iteration: c=0, then a>=b -> a becomes -1. second iteration: a=-1, b=0 -> max=0 -> c=0, then b>=a? so b becomes -1? Then output 0. Then the second program: string \"0\" -> not in list -> digit sum=0 -> then third program: 360//gcd(360,0)=360//360=1. So output 1. Therefore, it matches.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into one C program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads two integers (a and b) and then does a loop twice: \n    - In each iteration, it adds the maximum of a and b to c (initially 0).\n    - Then, if a>=b, it decrements a by 1; otherwise, it decrements b by 1.\n    - Finally, it prints c.\n\n 2. The second program reads a string (n). It checks if the string is in the list [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"].\n    - If it is, it prints 10.\n    - Otherwise, it converts the string to a list of integers (each character converted to an integer) and sums them, then prints the sum.\n\n 3. The third program reads an integer (x) and then prints 360 divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 360 and x.\n\n However, note that the output of the first program becomes the input of the second program, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But the second program expects a string (which in the first program is the integer output of c). So we have to convert the integer c to a string for the second program.\n\n Similarly, the third program expects an integer, but the second program outputs an integer (either 10 or the sum of digits) which is printed as an integer. However, the second program might output a number that is then read as an integer by the third.\n\n How we chain:\n\n  Step 1: Read two integers (a, b) -> compute c (an integer) -> then we need to pass that integer as a string to the next step? \n  But note: the first program prints c (as an integer) and then the second program reads that as a string. So in the chain, the output of the first is a string of the integer c.\n\n  Step 2: The second program reads that string and then either outputs 10 (if the string is in the list) or the sum of digits of the string.\n\n  Step 3: The third program reads the integer output of the second program and then computes 360 // gcd(360, x).\n\n We are to write a single C program that:\n\n  - Only the first block (corresponding to the first Python program) reads input (two integers).\n  - The intermediate steps do not do I/O (so we store the results in variables and pass them as needed).\n  - The last block produces the final output.\n\n Steps in C:\n\n  1. Read two integers (a, b) for the first part.\n  2. Compute the value of c (as in the first program) without printing it.\n  3. Instead of printing c, we convert c to a string (so we can simulate the input to the second program).\n  4. For the second program, we have the string of c. We need to check if this string is one of the strings in the list: [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"].\n        If it is, then the intermediate result for the second step is 10.\n        Otherwise, we compute the sum of the digits (each character converted to an integer and then summed).\n  5. Then, the third program takes that intermediate integer (from step 4) and computes: 360 divided by gcd(360, x) [where x is the integer from step 4].\n\n  6. Finally, we print the result of the third step.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n  - We need a function to compute gcd for the third step. We can use Euclid's algorithm.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read two integers: a, b.\n    Step 2: \n        int c = 0;\n        for i=0; i<2; i++) {\n            c += (a >= b) ? a : b;\n            if (a >= b) {\n                a--;\n            } else {\n                b--;\n            }\n        }\n\n    Step 3: Convert the integer c to a string. We can use sprintf.\n\n    Step 4: Check if the string is one of the predefined strings. We can have an array of those strings and compare.\n\n        Predefined: const char *a[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n\n        Then, if the string matches any of these, then the next value (let's call it secondResult) is 10.\n\n        Else, we traverse the string and convert each character to a digit and sum.\n\n    Step 5: Now, we have an integer (secondResult) which is the output of the second step.\n\n    Step 6: Compute gcd(360, secondResult). Then, result = 360 / gcd(360, secondResult).\n\n    Step 7: Print the result.\n\n Important: We must not do any I/O in between.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Note: We must be cautious about the string conversion. We need to allocate enough space for the string representation of c.\n\n Since the maximum value of c: \n   Initially, a and b are integers (from input). The maximum value of c would be at most 2 * (max of a and b). \n   The maximum integer in C we can handle is large, but the problem doesn't specify the range. \n   However, the second program only has the list of strings for powers of 10 (up to 100000). \n   So we can assume that if c is 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 then we output 10. Otherwise, we compute the digit sum.\n\n   But note: the digit sum is computed on the string representation. For example, if c is 123, then the string is \"123\", and the digit sum is 1+2+3=6.\n\n   Also note: the first program's output is an integer. So the string representation should not have any extra characters (like a minus sign). The problem states that the input for the first program is two integers (so nonnegative? not specified). But the operations (max and decrement) might lead to negative? \n\n   However, the original Python program: if we have negative numbers, the max would be the larger one (so less negative or positive). But the problem does not specify nonnegative. \n\n   But note: the second program expects a string of digits. If the integer c is negative, then the string will have a minus sign. We must account for that.\n\n   However, in the original chain, the first program prints an integer. If the integer is negative, then the string would be negative. Then the second program:\n\n        It would try to convert the string to a list of integers? Actually, the second program does: \n            n = input()\n            ... \n            sum(list(map(int, n)))\n\n        But if n has a minus sign, then converting each character to an integer would fail for the minus? Actually, no: the map(int, n) would try to convert each character to an integer. The minus sign is not a digit. So it would cause a ValueError.\n\n   But looking at the second program: it only checks if the string is in the list of positive numbers. So if the string is negative, it won't be in the list and then it would try to convert each character. The minus sign would cause an exception.\n\n   Therefore, we must assume that the first program's output (c) is nonnegative? \n\n   How does the first program behave?\n\n        c is computed by adding two max(a,b). Then we decrement either a or b. \n\n        The initial a and b are integers (could be negative). But note: the max of two negative numbers is the one closer to zero. Then we decrement one of them.\n\n        The output c might be negative? \n\n        Example: a = -10, b = -5.\n          First iteration: max = -5 -> c=-5. Then since a < b? Actually: a = -10, b=-5 -> a < b -> so we decrement b? Then b becomes -6.\n          Second iteration: max = -6? (because a=-10, b=-6 -> max is -6) -> c = -5 + (-6) = -11.\n\n        Then the first program prints -11.\n\n        Then the second program: \n            n = input() -> the string \"-11\"\n            Check: is \"-11\" in [\"10\", \"100\", ...]? -> no.\n            Then: sum(list(map(int, n))) -> \n                map(int, n): \n                    int('-') -> error? \n\n        So we see that the original chain would break for negative numbers.\n\n   Therefore, we must assume that the inputs are such that the chain does not break? Or the problem expects nonnegative?\n\n   Since the problem says: \"when run on the same input\", we assume that the input is such that the chain works. \n\n   However, to be safe, we note that the second program expects a string of digits (without any non-digit). So we must avoid negative numbers? \n\n   But the problem does not specify. We have two choices:\n\n        Option 1: Assume that the input to the first program leads to nonnegative c.\n        Option 2: Handle negative numbers in the second step by skipping the minus sign? But the original Python program doesn't. It would crash.\n\n   Since we are to reproduce the same behavior, if the original chain would crash on negative, then our C program should crash too? But the problem says \"behaves identically\". However, the original chain in Python would throw an exception. We are writing in C and we don't have exceptions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the problem does not specify the range, but the second program in the chain only works for nonnegative integers? \n\n   Let's look at the second program again: \n        It checks if the string is in a list of strings that are positive. Then it either prints 10 or the digit sum. The digit sum would be computed on the string. If the string has a minus, then the map(int, n) would try to convert the minus sign to an integer and fail.\n\n   So we must assume that the first program's output (c) is nonnegative? \n\n   How can we ensure that? The problem does not specify. But note the third program: it takes an integer and computes gcd, which is defined for integers (and gcd is nonnegative). But the input to the third program is the output of the second, which is 10 or a positive digit sum (if the string was positive). So the third program input is positive. \n\n   Therefore, the chain only works if the first program produces a nonnegative integer? \n\n   Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", we can assume the input is such that the first program produces a nonnegative integer. \n\n   We'll proceed under that assumption.\n\n   If we want to be safe, we can note that the second program in the chain in Python would crash for negative, so we can also crash in C? But how? We could check for a minus sign and then exit with an error? But the problem does not specify error handling.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem says \"the same input\", so we assume nonnegative.\n\n   Let's assume the input is nonnegative. Then the first program will output a nonnegative integer.\n\n   Steps:\n\n    1. Read two nonnegative integers: a, b.\n    2. Compute c (as above).\n    3. Convert c to a string (without any sign).\n\n    How to convert: we can use sprintf and then the string will not have a minus if c is nonnegative.\n\n    4. Check the string against the list of strings: \n          char *a[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n          int found = 0;\n          for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n              if (strcmp(string_c, a[i]) == 0) {\n                  found = 1;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          if (found) {\n              secondResult = 10;\n          } else {\n              secondResult = 0;\n              for (int i=0; string_c[i]; i++) {\n                  // Convert char to digit: subtract '0'\n                  secondResult += string_c[i] - '0';\n              }\n          }\n\n    5. Now, compute gcd(360, secondResult). Note: secondResult is at least 1? Actually, if c is 0 then the string is \"0\", then secondResult=0. Then gcd(360,0) is 360? Then 360/360=1.\n\n        But note: gcd(360,0) is 360? Actually, gcd(a,0) is |a|. So gcd(360,0)=360. Then 360/360=1.\n\n        However, the original third program: \n            x = int(input())\n            print(360 // gcd(360, x))\n\n        If x=0, then gcd(360,0)=360, then 360//360=1.\n\n        But what if x is negative? We are assuming nonnegative, so x (secondResult) is nonnegative.\n\n    6. Print the result.\n\n  Code:\n\n    We need:\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>  // not strictly needed for this, but for safety?\n\n    We write a gcd function.\n\n    Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Note: The first program might lead to negative a or b during the loop? But the max is taken before decrement. And we are adding the max to c. Then we decrement. But if a and b become negative, the max would be negative and then we add to c (which becomes more negative). Then we convert to string: we don't want the minus sign? \n\n  But we assumed that the final c is nonnegative? \n\n  Actually, we must ensure that the entire chain works for the provided inputs. Since the problem does not specify, we assume the inputs are such that c is nonnegative.\n\n  Alternatively, we can handle negative c by printing an error? But the original Python program would print a negative integer and then the second program would crash. We are to mimic the behavior. However, in C we can check: if c is negative, then we must form the string with a minus. Then the second step would try to process the minus sign and we would get an incorrect digit (because '-' minus '0' is not a digit). That would lead to a wrong digit sum? \n\n  Example: c = -11 -> string = \"-11\". Then in the else branch of the second step, we do:\n        secondResult = 0;\n        for each char: \n            '-' -> 45 - 48? -> -3? -> then add to secondResult: -3.\n            then '1' -> 1 -> secondResult becomes -2.\n            then '1' -> 1 -> secondResult becomes -1.\n\n  Then we pass -1 to the third step: gcd(360, -1) -> but gcd is defined for negative? Actually, gcd(360,-1)=1. Then 360//1=360.\n\n  But the original Python second program would crash because it tries to convert the string \"-11\" to a list of integers? Actually, no: the map(int, n) is not applied to each character? Wait, no: the code is:\n\n        n = input()\n        a = [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"]\n        new = sum(list(map(int, n)))\n\n  But wait: map(int, n) would try to apply the int function to each character in the string n. So for n = \"-11\", it would try to convert the character '-' to an integer? That would throw a ValueError.\n\n  Therefore, our C program should also throw an error? But we are in C. We can check: if we encounter a non-digit, we can break? But the problem says to behave identically. \n\n  However, the problem states: \"when run on the same input\". So if the input leads to a negative c, then the original chain would crash. We don't want to produce a wrong output. \n\n  We have two options:\n\n    Option 1: Assume that the input will be such that c is nonnegative.\n\n    Option 2: Simulate the crash? But the problem does not specify how to handle errors.\n\n  Since the problem says \"behaves identically\", and the original chain would crash, we can crash? How? We can check for a minus sign and then do something that causes an error? But the problem does not specify. Alternatively, we can note that the digit conversion in the else branch for the second step is only valid for digits. If we find a non-digit, we can output an error message and exit? But the original Python outputs a traceback.\n\n  However, the problem does not require to mimic the error message. It only says the same behavior. The behavior is: if the input leads to negative c, then the chain crashes. We can let it crash by not handling the minus and then the digit conversion would be negative? Then the third step would work? But that would be different.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid the issue by assuming the problem's input is nonnegative? The examples:\n\n      The first program: example input? \n          Example: input \"2 1\" -> \n              a=2, b=1\n              first iteration: max=2 -> c=2; then a>=b -> a becomes 1.\n              second iteration: max=1 (a=1, b=1) -> c=3; then a>=b -> a becomes 0.\n              output: 3 -> then second program: \"3\" -> not in the list -> digit sum=3 -> third program: 360 // gcd(360,3) = 360//3 = 120.\n\n      Another: \"1 2\" -> \n          a=1, b=2\n          first: max=2, c=2; then a<b -> b becomes 1.\n          second: max=1 (a=1,b=1) -> c=3 -> same as above.\n\n      Another: \"10 10\" -> \n          first iteration: max=10 -> c=10; then a>=b -> a becomes 9.\n          second iteration: max=10? (a=9, b=10) -> max=10 -> c=20; then a<b -> b becomes 9.\n          Then output 20. Then second program: string \"20\" -> not in the list -> 2+0=2 -> third program: 360//gcd(360,2)=360//2=180.\n\n      The list: only the exact strings \"10\", \"100\", ... are matched. So if the first program outputs 10, then the second program outputs 10.\n\n      Example: how to get 10? \n          We need the first program to output 10. \n          Let a=10, b=9: \n            first: max=10 -> c=10; then a>=b -> a=9.\n            second: max=9 (a=9, b=9) -> c=19 -> not 10.\n\n          How about a=5, b=5:\n            first: max=5 -> c=5; a becomes 4.\n            second: max=5 (a=4, b=5) -> c=10; then b becomes 4.\n            output 10.\n\n          Then second program: string \"10\" -> in the list -> outputs 10.\n          Then third: 360//gcd(360,10)=360//10=36.\n\n      So we see that negative does not occur in these examples.\n\n  Therefore, we assume that the input is such that c is nonnegative.\n\n  Code:\n\n    Steps:\n\n      int a, b;\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n      int c_val = 0;\n      for (int i=0; i<2; i++) {\n          if (a >= b) {\n              c_val += a;\n              a--;\n          } else {\n              c_val += b;\n              b--;\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Now convert c_val to a string. We assume nonnegative so we can do:\n      char str_c[20]; // 20 should be enough for 64-bit integers? \n      sprintf(str_c, \"%d\", c_val);\n\n      // Second step: \n      const char *list[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n      int is_in_list = 0;\n      for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n          if (strcmp(str_c, list[i]) == 0) {\n              is_in_list = 1;\n              break;\n          }\n      }\n\n      int secondResult;\n      if (is_in_list) {\n          secondResult = 10;\n      } else {\n          secondResult = 0;\n          for (int i=0; str_c[i]!='\\0'; i++) {\n              secondResult += str_c[i] - '0';\n          }\n      }\n\n      // Third step: compute gcd(360, secondResult)\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          // We'll write a helper function? But we can't nest functions in C. We can define a function outside main? \n          // Or we can write iterative inside main? But we'll write a helper function.\n\n          // Actually, we can write a helper function above main.\n\n          // But note: the problem says \"single C program\", so we can have one function.\n\n          // Alternatively, we can compute gcd in the main without a function? But for clarity, we write a function.\n\n          // We'll write a gcd function below the includes and above main.\n\n          // However, the problem says to write a single C program. We are allowed to have multiple functions.\n\n      }\n\n      But we are writing the entire program. So we can define a gcd function.\n\n  Let me write the entire program:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      // Function to compute gcd of two numbers (nonnegative)\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          // We want nonnegative. The Euclidean algorithm.\n          // We take absolute value? The gcd is defined for nonnegative? \n          // But we know secondResult is nonnegative? and 360 is positive.\n          // However, we can make sure a is positive and b nonnegative? \n          // Since 360 is positive, and secondResult is nonnegative, we can do:\n          if (b == 0) {\n              return a;\n          }\n          return gcd(b, a % b);\n      }\n\n      But note: the third program uses integer division. We want 360 // gcd(360, x). The gcd should be a divisor of 360? \n\n      However, we can do iterative to avoid recursion depth (for large numbers? but secondResult is at most 5*9=45? because the string of c has at most 5 digits? Actually, no: c could be large? but the digit sum is at most 45 for 5 digits? Actually, no: if c has 1000000, then the digit sum is 1. But wait, the second step: if c is 1000000, then the string is \"1000000\", which is not in the list (the list only has \"10\", \"100\", ... up to \"100000\"), so we do digit sum: 1+0+0+0+0+0+0=1.\n\n      So the secondResult is at most 45? (because the maximum digit sum for a number with 6 digits is 9*6=54, but our list catches the ones that are all zeros except the first one? so the digit sum for numbers not in the list: minimum is 1, maximum? 54?).\n\n      So we can use iterative gcd without worrying about recursion depth.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write iterative:\n\n          int gcd_iterative(int a, int b) {\n              while (b) {\n                  int temp = a % b;\n                  a = b;\n                  b = temp;\n              }\n              return a;\n          }\n\n      But note: the gcd for (360,0) should be 360. The iterative version: \n          a=360, b=0 -> then the while loop doesn't run -> returns 360.\n\n      So we use iterative.\n\n  Code:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n\n      int gcd(int a, int b) {\n          while (b != 0) {\n              int temp = a % b;\n              a = b;\n              b = temp;\n          }\n          return a;\n      }\n\n      int main() {\n          int a, b;\n          scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n          int c_val = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              if (a >= b) {\n                  c_val += a;\n                  a--;\n              } else {\n                  c_val += b;\n                  b--;\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Convert c_val to string\n          char str_c[20];\n          sprintf(str_c, \"%d\", c_val);\n\n          // Predefined list for the second step\n          const char *list[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n          int is_in_list = 0;\n          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n              if (strcmp(str_c, list[i]) == 0) {\n                  is_in_list = 1;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n\n          int secondResult;\n          if (is_in_list) {\n              secondResult = 10;\n          } else {\n              secondResult = 0;\n              for (int i = 0; str_c[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n                  secondResult += str_c[i] - '0';\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now compute the result for the third step\n          int g = gcd(360, secondResult);\n          int result = 360 / g;\n\n          printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n  But note: the gcd function must handle the case when secondResult is 0? \n        gcd(360,0) -> returns 360, then 360/360=1 -> correct.\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: input \"2 1\"\n          c_val = 2 (first iteration: a=2, b=1 -> add 2, then a becomes 1) \n                   second iteration: a=1, b=1 -> add 1 -> total=3.\n          str_c = \"3\"\n          not in list -> secondResult = 3.\n          gcd(360,3): \n              360 % 3 = 0 -> so gcd(3,0)=3 -> result=360/3=120 -> output 120.\n\n      Example 2: input \"1 2\" -> same as above -> 120.\n\n      Example 3: input \"10 10\"\n          first: a=10, b=10 -> add 10, then a becomes 9.\n          second: a=9, b=10 -> add 10, then b becomes 9 -> total=20.\n          str_c=\"20\" -> not in list -> secondResult=2+0=2.\n          gcd(360,2)=2 -> result=360/2=180.\n\n      Example 4: input \"5 5\"\n          first: add 5 -> a becomes 4; second: max(4,5)=5 -> total=10.\n          str_c=\"10\" -> in list -> secondResult=10.\n          gcd(360,10)=10 -> result=360/10=36.\n\n      Example 5: input \"0 0\"\n          first: max(0,0)=0 -> c_val=0; then a becomes -1? but then second iteration: max(-1,0)=0 -> c_val=0.\n          Then string \"0\" -> not in list -> secondResult=0.\n          gcd(360,0)=360 -> 360/360=1 -> output 1.\n\n      But wait: the original first program for \"0 0\":\n          a=0, b=0 -> first iteration: c=0, then a>=b -> a becomes -1.\n          second iteration: a=-1, b=0 -> max=0 -> c=0, then b>=a? so b becomes -1? \n          Then output 0.\n\n          Then the second program: string \"0\" -> not in list -> digit sum=0 -> then third program: 360//gcd(360,0)=360//360=1.\n\n          So output 1.\n\n      Therefore, it matches.\n\n  However, note that in the first program the decrement happens after the max? So for the second iteration, we use the updated a or b.\n\n  Our C code does the same.\n\n  One more: input \"3 5\"\n        a=3, b=5\n        first: max=5 -> c=5; then a<b -> b becomes 4.\n        second: a=3, b=4 -> max=4 -> c=5+4=9.\n        Then string \"9\" -> digit sum=9.\n        gcd(360,9)=9 -> 360/9=40.\n\n      In Python: \n          First: \n            a,b=3,5\n            c=0\n            i=0: c=5, b=4 -> then i=1: c=5+4=9 -> output 9.\n          Second: \n            n=\"9\" -> not in list -> sum([9]) = 9.\n          Third: 360 // gcd(360,9) -> gcd(360,9)=9 -> 40.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n  Note: The gcd function we wrote works for nonnegative numbers. Since 360 is positive and secondResult is nonnegative, it's safe.\n\n  Let me write the code.\n\n  Important: The gcd function must use absolute value? But we are passing 360 (positive) and secondResult (nonnegative). So we are safe.\n\n  We'll now write the complete C program."
