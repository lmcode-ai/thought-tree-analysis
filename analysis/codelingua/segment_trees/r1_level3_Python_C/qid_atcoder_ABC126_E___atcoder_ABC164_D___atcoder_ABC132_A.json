Another example: step1 outputs 2 -> step2:\n\n          s = \"2\", reversed: \"2\"\n          a = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2.\n          r += m[2] -> 0 -> r=0\n          then m[2] = 1.\n\n          step2 outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\". How about step1 outputs 4? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"4\" -> same as above: outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\". How about step1 outputs 0? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"0\", reversed: \"0\"\n          a = 0 + 0 * 1 = 0. r += m[0] -> m[0]=1 -> r=1\n          then m[0] becomes 2.\n\n          step2 outputs 1 -> step3: \"1\" -> distinct set {'1'} -> \"No\".\n\n        How about step1 outputs 11? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"11\", reversed = \"11\"\n\n          i=0: e='1' -> a = 1 -> m[1]=0 -> r=0, then m[1]=1.\n          i=1: e='1' -> a = 1 + 1 * (10^1 mod 2019) = 1 + 10 = 11. r += m[11] -> 0 -> r=0, then m[11]=1. step2 outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\". How can we get a non-zero r? \n\n        Example: step1 outputs 2019? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"2019\", reversed = \"9102\"\n\n          We need to compute: \n            a = 0\n            i0: e='9' -> a = 0 + 9 * (10^0 mod 2019) = 9 -> r += m[9] -> 0 -> then m[9]=1.\n            i1: e='1' -> a = 9 + 1 * (10^1 mod 2019) = 9 + 10 = 19 -> r += m[19] -> 0 -> m[19]=1.\n            i2: e='0' -> a = 19 + 0 * (10^2 mod 2019) = 19 -> r += m[19] -> 1 -> r=1 -> then m[19]=2.\n            i3: e='2' -> a = 19 + 2 * (10^3 mod 2019) = 19 + 2*1000 mod 2019 = 19+2000=2019 -> r += m[2019] -> m[2019] is 1 (because we set m[0]=1 at start? but note: we have m[2019 mod 2019] = m[0] -> which is 1 -> then r becomes 2. So step2 outputs 2? Then step3: the string \"2\" -> distinct set {'2'} -> \"No\". But note: the array m was initialized with m[0]=1. Then we have:\n\n          At the start: m[0]=1, others 0. Then for each remainder we update. How about a substring that is the whole string? The algorithm counts the number of times the same remainder has appeared before?",

The string \"1112\" has two distinct characters: '1' and '2'. The counts: '1':3, '2':1 -> fails the condition that each must be 2. So we don't need to check the length? The frequency check is sufficient. Therefore, we can skip the length check. However, note: the third program does not check the length.",

But note: the distinct count is 2, so there are exactly two non-zero frequencies in the array. And we are checking that every non-zero frequency is 2? Then we must have both being 2. Alternatively, we can break early: if we find one non-zero frequency that is not 2, then invalid. So:\n\n            valid = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] ! = 0) { if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            } Then if valid, \"Yes\", else \"No\". This is what we did. But note: what if there are more than two non-zero frequencies? But we already checked distinct==2, so there are exactly two non-zero frequencies. So the loop will break if we find one that is not 2? Otherwise, if both are 2, then we don't break and valid remains 1. So it's correct. Let's test with \"1122\": \n        freq['1']=2, freq['2']=2 -> valid=1 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  \"1223\": distinct=3 -> we skip the else part? Actually, we do the else part only if distinct==2. So \"1223\" would be distinct=3 -> \"No\". \"1123\": distinct=3 -> \"No\". \"1112\": distinct=2 -> then check frequencies: \n        '1':3 -> break -> valid=0 -> \"No\". So it's correct. We output the result. Note: We assume that the input graph is such that N and M are nonnegative and within bounds. We set MAX_N=100000.",

We are ready. However, note: the array m is of size l (2019). We set m[0]=1 and the rest to 0? Yes.\n\n  Let me test step2 with the string \"0\": \n        s1 = \"0\", len1=1. i=0: c='0' -> digit=0. a_val = (0 + 0 * 1) % 2019 = 0. r_val += m[0] -> m[0] is 1 -> r_val=1. then m[0] becomes 2.\n        base = (1 * 10) % 2019 = 10. Then r_val=1. Then step3: s2 = \"1\" -> distinct=1 -> \"No\". But in the Python step2 for \"0\": \n        a = 0 + 0 * (10^0 mod 2019) = 0.\n        r += m[0] -> 1 -> r=1. then m[0] becomes 2. So r=1. Then step3: \"1\" -> distinct=1 -> \"No\". So matches. We'll output the code.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into a single C program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (File1) reads two integers N and M, then M lines of three integers (X, Y, Z). It builds an undirected graph and counts the connected components. Then it prints the count (ans).\n\n 2. The second program (File2) reads a string (s) and then computes the number of substrings (as a contiguous part of the string) that are divisible by 2019. However, note that the first program outputs an integer (ans) and the second program reads that as a string? But wait, the chain must be consistent.\n\n However, note the instruction: the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n So, the input to the entire chain is the input for the first program (N and M, then M lines of three integers).\n\n Then, the output of the first program (a single integer, the count of connected components) becomes the input to the second program.\n\n The second program expects a string. Therefore, the integer output of the first program is read by the second program as a string.\n\n Then, the output of the second program (an integer, r) becomes the input to the third program.\n\n The third program expects a string. So the integer output of the second program is read as a string.\n\n But note: the third program checks if the string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n However, the chain might not be designed to work arbitrarily? We must follow the specification.\n\n How to structure the C program?\n\n We'll do:\n\n   Step 1: Read input for the first program (N, M and M lines of three integers). Then compute the connected components (ans1).\n\n   Step 2: Convert the integer ans1 to a string (which will be the input for the second program). Then run the second program on that string.\n\n   Step 3: The second program produces an integer (ans2). Then we convert that integer to a string (which becomes the input for the third program).\n\n   Step 4: Run the third program on that string (which is the string representation of ans2). Then the third program outputs either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n However, note the original chain:\n\n   Input for the entire chain: the graph data.\n\n   Output of the entire chain: the output of the third program.\n\n But the original chain:\n\n   File1: reads N, M and edges -> outputs an integer (ans, the number of connected components).\n\n   Then File2: reads a string (which is the output of File1) -> outputs an integer (r).\n\n   Then File3: reads a string (which is the output of File2) -> outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input: the graph data (as described for File1).\n\n   Output: either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Steps in C:\n\n   Step 1: Simulate File1 to compute the number of connected components (ans1).\n\n   Step 2: Convert ans1 to a string (say, s1) and then run the algorithm of File2 on s1 to get an integer r.\n\n   Step 3: Convert r to a string (say, s2) and then run the algorithm of File3 on s2.\n\n   Step 4: Output either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\n Important: We must not do any I/O in the middle (only the first block reads input, only the last block produces output). So we read the entire graph at the beginning, and then at the end we output the result of the third program.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   Step 1: Graph traversal (BFS) for connected components.\n\n   Step 2: The second program does:\n\n        s = input string (which is the string representation of the connected component count)\n        l = 2019\n        m = [1] + [0] * l   -> an array of length 2019+1? Actually, it creates an array of length 2020 (index 0..2019) with m[0]=1 and the rest 0.\n        Then it iterates over the string in reverse, updating a running total (a) and updating the array m and counting the number of times the current remainder has been seen.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n          a = 0\n          r = 0\n          for i, e in enumerate(s[::-1]):\n              a = (a + int(e) * (10^i mod l)) % l   [but note: we can do mod arithmetic to avoid big numbers]\n              then m[a] is incremented and r += m[a] (but note: the code does: r += m[a % l] and then increments m[a % l])\n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            a += int(e) * pow(10, i, l)   -> so a is mod l? But note: we are adding mod l? Actually, we can do mod at each step.\n\n          However, note: the pow(10, i, l) is 10^i mod l.\n\n          We can simulate the same in C.\n\n        We note: the string s is the string representation of the integer from step1.\n\n   Step 3: The third program:\n\n        It checks if the string has exactly 2 distinct characters and each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          If the number of distinct characters is not 2, output \"No\".\n          Otherwise, for each distinct character, if the count is not 2, output \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\n        But note: the string might be of any length? However, the output of step2 is an integer (r) which we convert to string. The integer r can be of any length? But note: the connected component count (ans1) is at most N (<=10^5?) so the string representation of ans1 is at most 6 digits? Then step2 produces an integer r that is the count of substrings (in the string representation of ans1) divisible by 2019. The value of r might be at most (len(s)*(len(s)+1))/2, which for 6 digits is 21 at most? So the string representation of r might be 1 or 2 digits.\n\n        So for step3, we are checking a string that is the decimal representation of r.\n\n        Example: if r is 12, then the string is \"12\" -> distinct characters: '1' and '2' -> two distinct, and each appears once? -> fails.\n\n        But wait: the example above: \"12\" has two distinct characters but each appears only once. So it would output \"No\".\n\n        However, the third program requires exactly two distinct characters and each appears exactly twice.\n\n        So the string must be of length 4? And have two distinct characters, each repeated twice? (like \"aabb\", \"abab\", etc.)\n\n        But note: the third program does:\n\n          c = Counter(S) -> counts frequency of each character.\n\n          Then it checks:\n            if the number of distinct characters (len(Sa)) is 2? \n            and then for each character in Sa, the count must be 2.\n\n        So the string must be of length 4? Actually, the total length is the sum of counts -> 2+2=4.\n\n        Therefore, the third program will only output \"Yes\" if the string is of length 4 and has exactly two distinct characters, each appearing twice.\n\n        Otherwise, it outputs \"No\".\n\n        But note: the output of step2 (r) might not be 4 digits? It might be 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits? \n\n        Example: if the graph has 1 connected component, then step1 outputs 1. Then step2 runs on the string \"1\". How does step2 work?\n\n          s = \"1\", reversed: \"1\"\n          l = 2019\n          m = [1,0,0,...,0] (2020 zeros, but m[0]=1)\n\n          i=0: e='1'\n            a = 0 + 1 * (10^0 mod 2019) = 1.\n            r += m[1] -> m[1] is 0 -> r=0\n            then m[1] becomes 1.\n\n          Then the loop ends.\n\n          So step2 outputs 0.\n\n          Then step3 runs on the string \"0\": \n            distinct characters: {'0'} -> only one -> outputs \"No\".\n\n        Another example: step1 outputs 2 -> step2:\n\n          s = \"2\", reversed: \"2\"\n          a = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2.\n          r += m[2] -> 0 -> r=0\n          then m[2] = 1.\n\n          step2 outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\".\n\n        How about step1 outputs 4? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"4\" -> same as above: outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\".\n\n        How about step1 outputs 0? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"0\", reversed: \"0\"\n          a = 0 + 0 * 1 = 0.\n          r += m[0] -> m[0]=1 -> r=1\n          then m[0] becomes 2.\n\n          step2 outputs 1 -> step3: \"1\" -> distinct set {'1'} -> \"No\".\n\n        How about step1 outputs 11? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"11\", reversed = \"11\"\n\n          i=0: e='1' -> a = 1 -> m[1]=0 -> r=0, then m[1]=1.\n          i=1: e='1' -> a = 1 + 1 * (10^1 mod 2019) = 1 + 10 = 11.\n                r += m[11] -> 0 -> r=0, then m[11]=1.\n\n          step2 outputs 0 -> step3: \"0\" -> \"No\".\n\n        How can we get a non-zero r? \n\n        Example: step1 outputs 2019? Then step2:\n\n          s = \"2019\", reversed = \"9102\"\n\n          We need to compute: \n            a = 0\n            i0: e='9' -> a = 0 + 9 * (10^0 mod 2019) = 9 -> r += m[9] -> 0 -> then m[9]=1.\n            i1: e='1' -> a = 9 + 1 * (10^1 mod 2019) = 9 + 10 = 19 -> r += m[19] -> 0 -> m[19]=1.\n            i2: e='0' -> a = 19 + 0 * (10^2 mod 2019) = 19 -> r += m[19] -> 1 -> r=1 -> then m[19]=2.\n            i3: e='2' -> a = 19 + 2 * (10^3 mod 2019) = 19 + 2*1000 mod 2019 = 19+2000=2019 -> r += m[2019] -> m[2019] is 1 (because we set m[0]=1 at start? but note: we have m[2019 mod 2019] = m[0] -> which is 1 -> then r becomes 2.\n\n          So step2 outputs 2? Then step3: the string \"2\" -> distinct set {'2'} -> \"No\".\n\n        But note: the array m was initialized with m[0]=1. Then we have:\n\n          At the start: m[0]=1, others 0.\n\n          Then for each remainder we update.\n\n        How about a substring that is the whole string? The algorithm counts the number of times the same remainder has appeared before? \n\n        Actually, the algorithm counts the number of pairs (i, j) such that the substring from j to i (in the reversed string) is divisible by 2019? \n\n        But note: the algorithm counts the current remainder and then adds the number of previous occurrences of the same remainder. This is because if the same remainder appears at two indices, then the substring between them is divisible by 2019.\n\n        So the value r is the number of such substrings.\n\n        How can we get a string that leads to step3 outputting \"Yes\"?\n\n        We need step2 to output a number that when converted to a string has exactly two distinct characters and each appears twice.\n\n        The smallest such number is 0? but 0 is \"0\" -> fails.\n\n        Then 10: \"10\" -> distinct characters: '1','0' -> two distinct, but each appears once -> fails.\n\n        Then 11: \"11\" -> distinct: {'1'} -> fails.\n\n        Then 12: \"12\" -> distinct: {'1','2'} -> each once -> fails.\n\n        Then 22: \"22\" -> distinct: {'2'} -> fails.\n\n        Then 100: \"100\" -> distinct: {'1','0'} -> fails (counts: '1':1, '0':2).\n\n        Then 1122: the number 1122 -> string \"1122\": \n            distinct: {'1','2'} -> two distinct.\n            count of '1': 2, count of '2':2 -> satisfies.\n\n        So if step2 outputs 1122, then step3 would output \"Yes\".\n\n        How to get step2 to output 1122? \n\n        We must have the input to step2 (the string s) such that the algorithm in step2 counts 1122 substrings that are divisible by 2019.\n\n        This is a large number of substrings. The string s must be very long? \n\n        Alternatively, we can try to see if the chain is fixed for a particular input? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\n        We are not to change the algorithms, just combine.\n\n        Therefore, we code the steps as described.\n\n Implementation in C:\n\n   Step 1: Read the graph and compute the number of connected components.\n\n   Step 2: Convert the integer (ans1) to a string.\n\n   Step 3: For the second program:\n\n        l = 2019\n        We'll create an array m of size 2020 (for remainders 0..2018, and we need index 2019? Actually, mod 2019, so remainders 0..2018 -> 2019 elements) and initialize m[0] = 1 and the rest to 0.\n\n        Then we traverse the string in reverse order.\n\n        We need to compute:\n\n          a = 0\n          r = 0\n          power = 1? But note: we are going to update the power as we go? Actually, we can use:\n\n            a = (a + (digit) * base) mod 2019\n\n          But note: the base for the i-th digit (from the right) is 10^i mod 2019.\n\n          However, we can avoid computing 10^i mod 2019 for large i? The string length is at most 6 (as argued) but we'll do it for any length.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            base_i = 10^i mod 2019\n\n          We can precompute the power for each i? \n\n        Steps for step2:\n\n          Precompute the powers? But note: we traverse from the last character to the first? Actually, we are traversing the reversed string (which is the original string in reverse). So the first character in the reversed string is the last digit, then the next is the second last, etc.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            base = 1;\n            a = 0;\n            for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n                digit = rev_string[i] - '0';\n                a = (a + digit * base) % 2019;\n                r += m[a];   // then m[a]++ \n                m[a]++;\n\n                base = (base * 10) % 2019;   // for the next digit (which is one more power to the left in the original string) we multiply base by 10 mod 2019.\n            }\n\n          However, note: the Python code uses:\n\n            a += int(e) * pow(10, i, l)\n\n          And then does:\n\n            r += m[a % l]\n\n          Then m[a % l] += 1\n\n          So we can do the same.\n\n        Important: the modulus operation: we do mod 2019 at each step.\n\n   Step 4: Convert the integer r (the result of step2) to a string.\n\n   Step 5: For the third program:\n\n        Count the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n        Check:\n          number of distinct characters: must be 2.\n          for each distinct character, the frequency must be 2.\n\n        Then output \"Yes\" if both conditions hold, otherwise \"No\".\n\n   Note: the entire input for the chain is the graph. We read that at the beginning.\n\n   We assume the input format:\n\n        First line: two integers N and M.\n        Then M lines, each with three integers (X, Y, Z). But note: the first program subtracts 1 from each of these integers.\n\n   Steps in C:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        // For BFS we'll use a queue.\n        #define MAX_N 100000\n\n        // Step1: Graph and BFS.\n\n        int main() {\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            // We'll create an adjacency list.

The maximum number of pairs is n*(n+1)/2, which for 6 is 21, so 2 digits.\n\n            sprintf(s2, \"%ld\", r);   // use %ld because r is long.\n\n            // Step4: Run the third program on s2.\n\n            // Count frequency of each character.\n            int freq[256] = {0};   // frequency table for ASCII\n            int distinct = 0;\n            int len2 = strlen(s2);\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < len2; i++) {\n                unsigned char c = s2[i];\n                if (freq[c] == 0) distinct++;\n                freq[c]++;\n            }\n\n            // Check condition 1: distinct must be 2.\n            if (distinct != 2) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                // Check that each distinct character appears exactly twice.\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (valid) {\n                    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"No\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Free memory\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                free(edge[i]);\n            }\n            free(u);\n            free(v);\n            free(curr_deg);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n  However, note: the third program does:\n\n        c = Counter(S)\n        Sa = set(S)\n        if len(Sa) != 2: print \"No\"\n        else:\n           for each i in Sa: if c[i] != 2: print \"No\" and break, else print \"Yes\"\n\n  But note: the string s2 might have more than 4 characters? However, the condition requires that each distinct character appears exactly twice. That implies the total length is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\n  Therefore, we can also check the length? Actually, the condition of the third program is:\n\n      distinct count must be 2 and for each distinct character the count is 2.\n\n  That implies the string length is 4.\n\n  But if the string length is not 4, then we know it fails? However, the condition of the third program doesn't require the length to be 4? It only requires the counts of the two distinct characters to be 2 each. That implies the total length is 4.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n        if (distinct != 2) -> \"No\"\n        else if (len2 != 4) -> \"No\"   [because the counts must be 2 each -> total 4]\n        else -> we check the counts? Actually, we already have the frequency array. We can check:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) -> invalid, break.\n            }\n\n        But note: if the string has two distinct characters and the total length is 4, then the counts must be either (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,1) or (4,0) ... but wait, the distinct set is two, so we have two characters. And the total length is 4, so the counts must be two numbers that add to 4. The only possibility for each to be 2 is if both are 2.\n\n        Actually, the condition of the third program is independent of the length: it only checks that each distinct character appears twice.\n\n        Example: the string \"1122\" has two distinct characters and each appears twice -> \"Yes\".\n\n        The string \"1111\" has one distinct character -> fails the distinct==2 check.\n\n        The string \"1112\" has two distinct characters: '1' and '2'. The counts: '1':3, '2':1 -> fails the condition that each must be 2.\n\n        So we don't need to check the length? The frequency check is sufficient.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip the length check.\n\n  However, note: the third program does not check the length. It only checks the distinct count and then the frequency of each distinct character.\n\n  So we do:\n\n        if (distinct != 2) -> \"No\"\n        else:\n            for each character in the string? Actually, we have the frequency array. We can iterate over the distinct characters? But we don't have the set. We can iterate over the entire frequency array and check that every non-zero frequency is 2.\n\n        But note: the distinct count is 2, so there are exactly two non-zero frequencies in the array. And we are checking that every non-zero frequency is 2? Then we must have both being 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break early: if we find one non-zero frequency that is not 2, then invalid.\n\n        So:\n\n            valid = 1;\n            for (int i=0; i<256; i++) {\n                if (freq[i] != 0) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then if valid, \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n  This is what we did.\n\n  But note: what if there are more than two non-zero frequencies? But we already checked distinct==2, so there are exactly two non-zero frequencies. So the loop will break if we find one that is not 2? Otherwise, if both are 2, then we don't break and valid remains 1.\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  Let's test with \"1122\": \n        freq['1']=2, freq['2']=2 -> valid=1 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  \"1223\": distinct=3 -> we skip the else part? Actually, we do the else part only if distinct==2. So \"1223\" would be distinct=3 -> \"No\".\n\n  \"1123\": distinct=3 -> \"No\".\n\n  \"1112\": distinct=2 -> then check frequencies: \n        '1':3 -> break -> valid=0 -> \"No\".\n\n  So it's correct.\n\n  We output the result.\n\n  Note: We assume that the input graph is such that N and M are nonnegative and within bounds.\n\n  We set MAX_N=100000.\n\n  We also note: the first program uses sys.setrecursionlimit but we are using BFS so we don't need recursion.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  We'll write the entire C program accordingly.\n\n  One more note: the second program uses mod arithmetic. We do:\n\n        a = (a + digit * base) % l;\n\n        But note: the multiplication might be large? We use long and mod 2019 (which is small). So it's safe.\n\n        We then do mod and adjust to be nonnegative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            a = (a + digit * base) % l;\n            if (a < 0) a += l;   // to make it positive\n\n        But the modulus operator in C for negative numbers: the remainder can be negative? \n\n        Example: -5 % 2019 might be negative? \n\n        We do: \n\n            base = (base * 10) % l;\n\n        Similarly, we adjust base to be nonnegative.\n\n        Actually, we can avoid negative by:\n\n            a = (a + digit * base) % l;\n            if (a < 0) a += l;\n\n        And for base:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % l;\n            if (base < 0) base += l;\n\n        But why would base be negative? The modulus of a positive number by 2019 is in [0,2018]. Then base is always nonnegative? \n\n        However, the modulus operation in C: the sign of the result is implementation-defined for negative numbers? But we are doing modulus on nonnegative numbers? \n\n        Actually, base starts at 1 (nonnegative). Then we do:\n\n            base = (base * 10) % l;\n\n        Since base and 10 are nonnegative, base*10 is nonnegative. Then modulus by 2019 (positive) is nonnegative? \n\n        But the standard says: the remainder has the same sign as the dividend.\n\n        However, if base*10 is positive, then the remainder is nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operator for nonnegative numbers is nonnegative.\n\n        So we can skip the adjustment for nonnegativity? \n\n        But the standard says: if the quotient a/b is representable, then (a/b)*b + a%b == a.\n\n        And for positive modulus, the remainder is nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, in C, for positive modulus, the remainder is nonnegative? \n\n        Example: 5%3=2, (-5)%3: can be -2 or 1? It depends on the implementation.\n\n        But we are only doing modulus on nonnegative numbers? \n\n        So we can skip the adjustment? \n\n        However, our a might be negative? \n\n        How? \n\n        We have:\n\n            a = (a + digit * base) % l;\n\n        But a starts at 0, and digit and base are nonnegative. Then a is nonnegative? \n\n        Then we do modulus: which for a nonnegative a and positive l, the remainder is nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, if a is nonnegative, then a%l is in [0, l-1].\n\n        So we don't need the adjustment? \n\n        Let me remove the adjustment.\n\n        So:\n\n            a = (a + digit * base) % l;   // a is nonnegative? \n\n        Then we do:\n\n            r += m[a];   // a is in [0,2018]\n\n        Then m[a]++\n\n        Then base = (base * 10) % l;   // base is nonnegative? \n\n        So we can remove the adjustment.\n\n  Therefore, we'll do:\n\n        a = (a + digit * base) % l;\n        r += m[a];\n        m[a]++;\n        base = (base * 10) % l;\n\n  But note: the modulus operation might be expensive? But l is 2019, so it's fine.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  Final code:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        #define MAX_N 100000\n\n        int main() {\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            int* u = (int*)malloc(M * sizeof(int));\n            int* v = (int*)malloc(M * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int z;\n                scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &u[i], &v[i], &z);\n                u[i]--;\n                v[i]--;\n            }\n\n            // Build graph: compute degrees\n            int deg[MAX_N] = {0};\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                deg[u[i]]++;\n                deg[v[i]]++;\n            }\n\n            // Allocate adjacency lists\n            int* edge[MAX_N];\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                edge[i] = (int*)malloc(deg[i] * sizeof(int));\n            }\n\n            int* curr_deg = (int*)calloc(N, sizeof(int));   // set to 0\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {\n                int a = u[i], b = v[i];\n                edge[a][curr_deg[a]++] = b;\n                edge[b][curr_deg[b]++] = a;\n            }\n\n            // BFS for connected components\n            bool used[MAX_N] = {false};\n            int ans1 = 0;\n            int queue[MAX_N];\n            int front, rear;\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                if (!used[i]) {\n                    ans1++;\n                    front = 0; rear = 0;\n                    queue[rear++] = i;\n                    used[i] = true;\n                    while (front < rear) {\n                        int node = queue[front++];\n                        for (int j = 0; j < deg[node]; j++) {\n                            int next = edge[node][j];\n                            if (!used[next]) {\n                                used[next] = true;\n                                queue[rear++] = next;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Convert ans1 to string s1\n            char s1[20];\n            sprintf(s1, \"%d\", ans1);\n\n            // Step2: process s1 with the second program\n            const int l = 2019;\n            int m[l] = {0};   // m[0..2018]\n            m[0] = 1;\n            long a_val = 0;   // the running value a\n            long r_val = 0;    // the result r\n            long base = 1;\n            int len1 = strlen(s1);\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < len1; i++) {\n                // Start from the last character of s1\n                char c = s1[len1-1-i];\n                int digit = c - '0';\n                a_val = (a_val + digit * base) % l;\n                r_val += m[a_val];\n                m[a_val]++;\n                base = (base * 10) % l;\n            }\n\n            // Convert r_val to string s2\n            char s2[20];\n            sprintf(s2, \"%ld\", r_val);\n\n            // Step3: process s2 with the third program\n            int freq[256] = {0};\n            int distinct = 0;\n            int len2 = strlen(s2);\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < len2; i++) {\n                unsigned char c = s2[i];\n                if (freq[c] == 0) distinct++;\n                freq[c]++;\n            }\n\n            if (distinct != 2) {\n                printf(\"No\\n\");\n            } else {\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n                    if (freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] != 2) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (valid) {\n                    printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n                } else {\n                    printf(\"No\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Free memory\n            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n                free(edge[i]);\n            }\n            free(u);\n            free(v);\n            free(curr_deg);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n  Note: We use long for a_val and r_val to avoid overflow? \n\n        a_val: mod 2019, so it's in [0,2018] -> no need for long? But we do:\n\n            a_val = (a_val + digit * base) % l;\n\n        digit is 0-9, base is mod 2019 so base in [0,2018]. The maximum: 9*2018 is 18162, then add a_val (max 2018) -> 20180, which is < 2^31. So we can use int? But we are doing mod 2019, so the value is bounded by 2018.\n\n        However, we store in a_val the mod result? Then we can use int for a_val.\n\n        But r_val: the number of substrings. The maximum number of substrings is n*(n+1)/2, and n is the length of s1 (at most 6) -> 6*7/2=21 -> fits in int.\n\n        But we used long for r_val? We can use int.\n\n        But to be safe for a longer string? The problem says the first program runs on a graph with up to 10^5 nodes, so the connected component count is at most 10^5 -> the string s1 can be 6 digits. Then the number of substrings is 6*7/2=21, so r_val is at most 21.\n\n        We can change to int.\n\n        Similarly, base: we do mod 2019, so base is at most 2018 -> int.\n\n        Let me change:\n\n            int a_val = 0;\n            int r_val = 0;\n            int base = 1;\n\n        And then:\n\n            sprintf(s2, \"%d\", r_val);\n\n        But note: the modulus operation: \n\n            a_val = (a_val + digit * base) % l;\n\n        This is safe because the expression: digit (0-9) * base (0-2018) is at most 9*2018=18162, then adding a_val (mod 2019, so at most 2018) -> at most 18162+2018 = 20180, which is within int.\n\n        So we change.\n\n  Final code with int for step2:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        #define MAX_N 100000\n\n        int main() {\n            int N, M;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &N, &M);\n\n            int* u = (int*)malloc(M * sizeof(int));\n            int* v = (int*)malloc(M * sizeof(int));\n            for (int i = 0;

Yes.\n\n  Let me test step2 with the string \"0\": \n        s1 = \"0\", len1=1.\n        i=0: c='0' -> digit=0.\n        a_val = (0 + 0 * 1) % 2019 = 0.\n        r_val += m[0] -> m[0] is 1 -> r_val=1.\n        then m[0] becomes 2.\n        base = (1 * 10) % 2019 = 10.\n        Then r_val=1.\n\n        Then step3: s2 = \"1\" -> distinct=1 -> \"No\".\n\n  But in the Python step2 for \"0\": \n        a = 0 + 0 * (10^0 mod 2019) = 0.\n        r += m[0] -> 1 -> r=1.\n        then m[0] becomes 2.\n\n        So r=1.\n\n        Then step3: \"1\" -> distinct=1 -> \"No\".\n\n  So matches.\n\n  We'll output the code.\n\n  Note: the graph building: we assume the graph is undirected and without self-loops? The original program does.\n\n  We also note: the first program does not use Z, so we ignore it.\n\n  We are done."
