But there are no commas, so we can simply output the string. However, we do:\n\n                for (int i=0; output3[i]; i++) { if (output3[i] == ',') {\n                        putchar(' ');\n                    } else {\n                        putchar(output3[i]);\n                    }\n                }\n                putchar('\\n');\n\n            But the original third program prints the entire string after replacement. 6.

But the string we get from the first program's output is an integer string (with optional minus for negative) and no '?'. So we are covered. But note: the second program's original code has an if for n==1? We handled that. For n==1: \n            if the string is \"5\", then output 1, else 0. But note: what if the string is \"0\"? then we output 0. And for n>1, we output 1 only if the entire number mod13 is 5. This matches. Therefore, we write the C program accordingly. However, note: the first program might output 0? Then the string is \"0\", which has length 1 -> then we check if it is '5'? -> no, so output 0. Then the third program outputs \"0\". If the first program outputs 5, then the string is \"5\", length=1 -> output 1, then third program outputs \"1\". If the first program outputs 18? \"18\": length=2 -> no non-digit -> \n                res = (0*10+1)%13 = 1, then (1*10+8)%13 = 18%13=5 -> output 1. So then the third program outputs \"1\". If the first program outputs 5 as part of a multi-digit number: e.g., 500? \n            \"500\": \n                res = 0\n                res = (0*10+5)%13 = 5\n                then (5*10+0)%13 = 50%13 = 11\n                then (11*10+0)%13 = 110%13 = 110-13*8=110-104=6 -> not 5 -> output 0. This matches. But note: the original second program does:\n\n        dp[0][5] = 1   for the first digit '5'? then for the next digit '0': \n            for state k in [0..12]:\n                new_state = (k*10+0) % 13\n            so for k=5: new_state = 50%13=11 -> so dp[1][11] += 1\n            then for the next digit '0': \n                for state k=11: new_state = (11*10+0)%13 = 110%13=6\n            so dp[2][6] = 1 -> then output 0.

So the output of the second program is a string of digits and a newline. Then the third program reads a line: it gets the digits and the newline? Then the third program's input() (built-in) reads a line and returns without the newline? -> so it returns the digits. Then it replaces commas? none, then prints the digits and a newline.

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine three Python programs into a single C program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (File1) reads two integers (n and x) and then a list of n integers (a).\n    It then constructs a 2D array `b` of size n x n and computes values for `b`.\n    Finally, it computes the minimum value of `sum(b[j]) + x * i` for i in range(n) and prints that minimum.\n\n 2. The second program (File2) reads a string S and then uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways \n    to replace '?' in S with digits such that the entire number (taken modulo 13) equals 5. It prints the count modulo (10^9+7).\n\n 3. The third program (File3) simply reads a string and replaces every comma with a space and prints the result.\n\n However, note the chain: \n    The output of the first program is an integer (m) which is printed. \n    The second program expects input from stdin (which would be the output of the first program? but wait, the second program reads a string S). \n    The third program then reads a string and replaces commas.\n\n But looking at the original sequence, the programs are independent? However, the problem states: \n    \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the chain is:\n   Input for the entire chain: the input for the first program (n, x and the list a).\n\n   Then the first program prints an integer (m) which becomes the input for the second program? \n   But the second program expects a string (S) and the first program outputs an integer.\n\n   Then the second program outputs an integer (the count modulo mod) which becomes the input for the third program? \n   The third program expects a string and replaces commas.\n\n However, note the second program also has an if condition: if n==1, it prints 0 or 1 and exits.\n\n How to chain?\n\n Let me reexamine the programs:\n\n   Program 1: reads two integers and a list of integers -> prints an integer.\n\n   Program 2: reads a string (with input() function that reads a line from stdin) -> and then processes that string.\n\n   Program 3: reads a string (with input() which is the entire line) and replaces commas by spaces.\n\n So the chain:\n\n   Step1: The first program runs and prints an integer (let's say m) to stdout.\n\n   Step2: The second program reads from stdin. But it expects the next line of input? It reads a string. \n           So the integer m (as a string) is the input to the second program? \n\n   However, the second program expects a string of digits and '?'. The integer m is a number and does not contain '?'.\n\n   Step3: The third program then reads the output of the second program? which is an integer (the count) and then replaces commas in that string? \n           But the integer has no commas.\n\n This does not seem to make sense.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n So the output of the first program (an integer) is the input to the second program? The second program expects a string of digits and '?'. \n However, the integer output by the first program is a number without any '?'. Then the second program would run and if the integer has more than one digit, \n it would do the DP. Then the third program would take the integer output of the second program and replace commas? \n\n This chain is not meaningful.\n\n Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the entire sequence is run on the same original input? \n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\"\n\n After reading the problem again: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And \"Ensure that the final C program behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input.\"\n\n How the original chain would run?\n\n   Suppose the input for the first program is provided on stdin.\n\n   The first program runs and prints an integer to stdout.\n\n   Then the second program runs, reading from stdin. But at that point, the original stdin has been consumed by the first program? \n   So the second program would read the next line? However, the first program only outputs one integer (one line).\n\n   Then the third program runs and reads from stdin? But there is no more input? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:\n\n   Input -> Program1 -> (output1) -> Program2 (as its input) -> (output2) -> Program3 -> (output3) -> stdout.\n\n But the original Program2 does not read the output of Program1? It reads a string that is supposed to be a pattern with digits and '?'.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider: the problem states that the programs are executed in sequence, with the output of one as input to the next.\n\n However, the three programs are independent and designed for different inputs.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the entire sequence\" and \"when run on the same input\". \n\n What input? The input for the entire chain is the input for the first program? Then the output of the first program becomes the input for the second, and so on.\n\n However, the second program expects a string of digits and '?', but the first program outputs an integer. \n\n This chain is not naturally compatible.\n\n But looking at the third program: it replaces commas with spaces. It would work on any string.\n\n How about we reinterpret:\n\n   The problem might mean that the entire chain is run on the same input file? That is, the first program reads its input from the beginning of the file, \n   then the second program reads the next part of the file (which is after the first program's input) and the third program then reads the next? \n\n However, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So the input for the entire chain is the input for the first program. Then the output of the first program is the input for the second, and the output of the second is the input for the third.\n\n Therefore, we must design the C program to:\n\n   Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, x and the list a) from stdin.\n\n   Step 2: Run the first program's logic and capture its output (the integer m) as a string (without printing it to stdout at that moment).\n\n   Step 3: Pass that string (the integer m) as the input string for the second program.\n\n   Step 4: Run the second program's logic on the string of the integer m (which is a string of digits, no '?' initially). \n            However, note that the second program is designed for a string that may contain '?'. \n            Since the string from the first program is an integer, it contains no '?'. \n            So the second program will count the number of ways to interpret the entire string (which has no '?') as a number mod 13 equal to 5? \n            But there are no choices. So it will check if the integer mod 13 is 5? Then it would output 1 if true, 0 otherwise.\n\n   Step 5: Capture the output of the second program (which is either 0 or 1, or in the general case with '?' it would be a count) as a string.\n\n   Step 6: Pass that string to the third program, which will replace commas in that string with spaces. \n            Since the string is a number (without commas), it will output the same number? \n\n   Then the entire chain outputs the same as the third program.\n\n However, this is not the same as running the three programs independently on the same input? \n\n But the problem says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\".\n\n So we must simulate the chain.\n\n But note: the second program has an if condition for n==1 (the length of the string). The string we are passing is the string representation of the integer m.\n\n Example: \n   Suppose the first program outputs 123. Then the string for the second program is \"123\", which has length 3.\n\n   Then the second program will run the DP for n=3, and the string \"123\". Since there are no '?', the DP will only have one path: \n        state0: [1] -> state1: [1*10+2 = 12] -> state2: [12*10+3=123 mod13 = 123 %13 = 123 - 13*9 = 123-117=6] -> so state at the end: 6 mod13.\n        Then it will output dp[2][5] which is 0.\n\n   Then the third program gets the string \"0\" (if the second program outputs 0) and replaces commas -> becomes \"0\".\n\n   So the entire chain outputs \"0\".\n\n But if the first program outputs a number that mod13 is 5, then the second program outputs 1, and the third outputs \"1\".\n\n However, the original first program's output (m) is an integer that we are converting to a string and then processing.\n\n This seems to be the intended chain.\n\n But wait, the second program in the original code (File2) is designed for the string that might contain '?' and the example in the code: \n        if n==1: if the string is '5' or '?' then ... \n\n However, in our chain the string passed to the second program is the string representation of an integer (so no '?'). \n\n Therefore, the second program in the chain will only work on a string without any '?'.\n\n So we can simplify the second program for the case without '?'.\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n We are going to write a C program that:\n\n   Step 1: Reads n and x, and then the list a (n integers) from stdin.\n\n   Step 2: Computes the first program's output (an integer m) and then converts m to a string (without printing it).\n\n   Step 3: Uses that string as input for the second program.\n\n        The second program: \n            Let S = string representation of m.\n            n = strlen(S)\n\n            We then run the DP for the string without any '?'. \n\n            But note: the second program has an if for n==1? We must handle that.\n\n            Actually, the second program code:\n\n                if n == 1:\n                    if S == '5' or S == '?': \n                        print(1)\n                    else:\n                        print(0)\n                    exit()\n\n            But in our case, if m is a single digit, then we have:\n\n                if m == 5 -> then output 1, else 0.\n\n            If m has more than one digit, then we run the DP.\n\n            However, without '?' we can avoid the DP and just compute the modulus? \n            But note: the DP is done modulo 13 and modulo mod (10^9+7). Without '?' we don't need the DP table. \n            We can compute the modulus of the entire number mod13 and then if it equals 5, then the count is 1, else 0.\n\n            However, the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", so we must do exactly the same steps? \n\n            But the second program is designed to handle '?'. Since we have no '?', the DP will be:\n\n                dp[0][digit0 % 13] = 1, and then for each next digit, we do:\n\n                    for k in 0..12:\n                         new_state = (k * 10 + digit) % 13\n                         then set dp[i][new_state] = dp[i-1][k]   (but without any branching because no '?')\n\n            And then output dp[n-1][5] mod mod.\n\n            Actually, without '?' the DP is deterministic and the modulus of the entire number mod13 is fixed.\n\n            So we can compute the modulus of the entire number mod13 and then output 1 if modulus==5, else 0.\n\n            But note: the DP in the second program does:\n\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if i==0:\n                        if not '?', then set dp[0][d0] = 1.\n                    else:\n                        for k in 0..12:\n                            new_state = (k*10 + d_i) % 13\n                            then add dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][new_state]\n\n            This is equivalent to building the number mod13? \n\n            Actually, the DP does:\n\n                state0 = d0 % 13\n                state1 = (state0 * 10 + d1) % 13\n                ...\n\n            So it is the same as the entire number mod13.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute the entire number mod13 and then set the result to 1 if that modulus is 5, else 0.\n\n            However, note: the modulus mod 13 of the entire number can be computed without building the whole number (to avoid big integers) \n            because we can do:\n\n                long long res = 0;\n                for each char in S:\n                    d = char - '0';\n                    res = (res * 10 + d) % 13;\n\n            Then if res % 13 == 5, then the count is 1, else 0.\n\n            But note: the second program does modulo 10^9+7 at every step? \n\n            Since without '?' we only have one path, the count is either 0 or 1. So we can output 1 if (res==5) else 0.\n\n            However, the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\", so we must do exactly the same? \n\n            The original second program does:\n\n                dp[0][d0] = 1   (if no '?')\n\n                then for i=1 to n-1:\n                    for k in 0..12:\n                        new_state = (k*10 + d_i) % 13\n                        dp[i][new_state] = (dp[i][new_state] + dp[i-1][k]) % mod\n\n            and then output dp[n-1][5] mod mod.\n\n            Since there's only one path, the value in dp[n-1][5] is 1 if the entire number mod13 is 5, else 0.\n\n            So we can do without the DP table for the second program? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle\", meaning we must do the computation without I/O.\n\n            But we are free to implement the second program's logic in the most efficient way? \n\n            However, the problem says \"behaves identically\", meaning same output for the same input.\n\n            Since the input for the second program is a string without '?', the output will be 1 if the number mod13 is 5, else 0.\n\n            So we can compute the modulus and then set the result to 1 or 0.\n\n            But note: the second program does modulo 10^9+7 at every step? and we are only adding 1? so 1 mod mod is 1.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                long long mod_val = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    mod_val = (mod_val * 10 + (S[i]-'0')) % 13;\n                }\n                result2 = (mod_val == 5) ? 1 : 0;\n\n            However, wait: the modulus in the DP is done step by step and the modulus base 13 is applied at each step. \n            But note: (a * 10 + b) % 13 is the same as ((a %13)*10 + b) %13.\n\n            And we are doing exactly that.\n\n            So we can do the modulus without building the whole number.\n\n            But note: the original program does:\n\n                dp[0][d0 % 13] = 1.\n\n                Then for the next digit: \n                    for each state k: new_state = (k*10 + d1) % 13.\n\n            Our method:\n\n                mod_val = (d0) % 13\n                mod_val = (mod_val*10 + d1) % 13\n\n            is equivalent.\n\n            Therefore, we can do that.\n\n            However, what if the string is very long? The integer m from the first program might be very large? \n            But note: the first program's m is computed as:\n\n                m = 10**15 initially, then we do:\n\n                for i in range(n):   # n is at most 2000? because the input list a has n numbers, and n is read from input\n                    m = min(m, ...)\n\n                and then we print m.\n\n            The value of m is the minimum of expressions that are the sum of an array of n numbers (each being an element of a) plus x*i.\n\n            The array a is given by the user, and x is given. The numbers in a and x are integers. \n\n            How big can m be? \n\n            The worst-case: the sum of the array j (which is a row of b) might be as large as n * (max element in a). \n            And then we add x*i (with i from 0 to n-1). \n\n            The constraints? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume that the numbers are within 0 to 10^9? \n\n            Then the maximum sum of j could be n * 10^9, and then adding x*i (x up to 10^9, so at most n * 10^9) -> total m might be as large as 2 * n * 10^9.\n\n            n is at most 2000? Then m is at most 4000 * 10^9 = 4e12 -> 13 digits? \n\n            So the string representation of m has at most 14 characters? \n\n            Therefore, we can safely compute the modulus by iterating over the string.\n\n   Step 4: Then the third program: we take the result of the second program (which is an integer, either 0 or 1) and convert it to a string. \n            Then we replace every comma in that string by a space? \n            But the string is either \"0\" or \"1\", which have no commas -> so the output is the same.\n\n            Therefore, we can skip the replace? \n\n            But to be safe, we do:\n\n                char *output2 = (result2 == 1) ? \"1\" : \"0\";\n                then we would do: for each char in output2, if char is ',' then output space, else output the char.\n\n            Since there is no comma, we output the same.\n\n   Step 5: Then we output the final string.\n\n However, note: the third program in the original code reads a string and replaces commas. \n        It does: print(input().replace(\",\", \" \"))\n\n        So if the input to the third program is \"0\", then it outputs \"0\".\n\n        If it is \"1\", then outputs \"1\".\n\n        And if it is \"1,000\", then it would output \"1 000\". \n\n        But in our case, the input to the third program is either \"0\" or \"1\", so no commas.\n\n Therefore, the entire chain:\n\n   Input: n, x and the list a.\n\n   Output: either \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n But wait: what if the first program outputs a number that mod13 is 5? Then we output \"1\", else \"0\".\n\n How is that meaningful? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the meaning. We just replicate.\n\n But note: the second program has an alternative for when the string has '?'? \n        In our chain we are passing a string without '?' so we don't need the full DP for the general case.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must consider the possibility that the first program might output a number that is negative? \n\n        But the first program: \n            m is initialized to 10**15 (a big positive number) and then we take min with expressions that are sums of positive numbers? \n            unless the array a can be negative? \n\n        The problem says: \"a = list(map(int, input().split()))\" -> so a can have negative numbers? \n\n        But note: the b array is computed by:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                m = a[i]\n                for j in range(n):\n                    k = i - j\n                    if k < 0: k += n\n                    m = min(m, a[k])\n                    b[j][i] = m\n\n        Then we compute: m = min_i [ sum(b[j][i] for j? no: for each i we have a row j? Actually, the inner loop is over j? \n\n        Actually, the expression: \n\n            for i, j in enumerate(b):   # here i is the index of the row? and j is the row?\n                m = min(m, sum(j) + x * i)\n\n        So j is a row of the matrix b? \n\n        The matrix b is n x n. The variable j in the loop is the j-th row? \n\n        Actually, the code: \n\n            b = [[None for _ in [0] * n] for _ in [0] * n]\n            for i in range(n):\n                m = a[i]\n                for j in range(n):\n                    k = i - j\n                    if k < 0:\n                        k += n\n                    m = min(m, a[k])\n                    b[j][i] = m\n\n        Then we do:\n\n            for i, j in enumerate(b):   # i from 0 to n-1, j is the i-th row of b\n                s = sum(j)\n                candidate = s + x * i\n                m = min(m, candidate)\n\n        So the first program outputs the minimum candidate.\n\n        Since a can be negative? Then m (the output) can be negative? \n\n        How do we handle negative numbers in the second program? \n\n        The second program expects a string. The first program prints m, which can be negative? \n\n        Example: if m is negative, then the string will start with '-'.\n\n        Then the second program: \n\n            It reads a string that may have a minus sign? \n\n            The code for the second program: \n\n                if n==1: \n                    if S=='5' or S=='?': then 1 else 0.\n\n                But if the string is \"-5\", then n=2 -> so it goes to the DP.\n\n            The DP: \n\n                for the first char: if it is '-'? \n                    The original code: if S[i]!='?', then it uses int(S[i]). \n                    But '-' is not a digit? int('-') will crash? \n\n            Actually, the original Python code: \n\n                if S[i] != '?':\n                    dp[i][(k * 10 + int(S[i])) % 13] += dp[i-1][k]\n\n            But if the string has a minus sign, then int('-') will throw an exception.\n\n        So we must avoid negative numbers? \n\n        How does the first program output negative numbers? \n\n        The first program: the array a can be negative? \n\n        Then the min candidate might be negative? \n\n        Therefore, the first program might output a negative integer.\n\n        Then the second program will crash? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n        The original chain: if the first program outputs a negative number, then the second program will crash? \n\n        Therefore, we must replicate the crash? \n\n        However, the second program in the original code does not handle negative numbers? \n\n        How does the original second program run? \n\n            It reads the string from stdin. If the string is negative, then at the first character:\n\n                if S[0]!='?' -> then it uses int(S[0]) which is int('-') -> which is not defined? \n\n            Actually, in Python, int('-') is not valid. But note: the entire string is a negative number? \n\n            The second program is designed for a string of digits and '?'? It does not expect a minus sign.\n\n        Therefore, the chain is not defined for negative m? \n\n        But the first program might output a negative m? \n\n        How can we fix? \n\n        The problem does not specify constraints on a. So we must assume a can be negative? \n\n        Then the first program might output a negative integer? \n\n        Therefore, the second program in the chain will crash? \n\n        But the original second program is designed for a string that is a pattern of digits and '?'? \n\n        So the chain is only defined when the first program outputs a nonnegative integer? \n\n        How can the first program output a nonnegative integer? \n\n            The candidate: s + x*i -> s is the sum of an array that is built from the array a by taking mins? \n            So if a is all nonnegative, then s is nonnegative, and x is nonnegative? \n\n            But the problem does not say x is nonnegative? \n\n            x is read from input: it can be negative? \n\n            Then candidate = s + x*i: if x is negative and i is large, then candidate can be negative.\n\n        Therefore, we must handle negative numbers in the second program? \n\n        But the second program does not handle negative numbers? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note: the first program outputs the integer m, and we are converting it to a string. \n        The string representation of a negative integer starts with '-'. \n\n        The second program: \n\n            It checks if the first character is not '?' -> then it converts to an integer. \n            But the integer conversion in the second program is for a single character? \n\n            The code: int(S[i]) -> for the first character: if the string is \"-123\", then S[0] is '-', and int('-') is not defined.\n\n        So the chain would crash in Python? \n\n        Therefore, we must replicate the crash? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"behaves identically\". \n\n        How does the Python int() function behave when given a string that is a negative number? \n\n        But note: the second program is not converting the entire string to an integer at once? It is converting each character? \n\n        For a negative number, the first character is '-' and then the rest are digits. \n\n        The second program does:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                if S[i]!='?':\n                    digit = int(S[i])   # this will fail on the first character because '-' is not a digit.\n\n        So it will throw an exception.\n\n        Therefore, we must make the C program crash? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the crash by noticing that the first program's output is an integer and we can output it as an unsigned representation? \n\n        But the problem does not say.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify the constraints, we must assume that m is nonnegative? \n\n        Or note: the first program: \n\n            m = 10**15   (a positive number) and then we take min with candidate expressions. \n\n            The candidate expressions: \n\n                s = sum(j)   # j is a row of the matrix b, which is built from a by taking mins? \n\n                candidate = s + x * i   # i is nonnegative? \n\n            So if x is negative, then candidate might be negative? \n\n        Therefore, the first program can output a negative integer.\n\n        Then the chain will crash in the second program? \n\n        So the C program should crash? \n\n        How to crash in C? \n\n            When converting the negative integer to a string, we get a string with a minus sign.\n\n            Then in the second program, when processing the first character:\n\n                if it is not '?' and we try to convert '-' to a digit: \n\n                    int digit = S[i] - '0';   -> this would be 45 - 48 = -3? \n\n                Then we do:\n\n                    dp[0][ (k * 10 + digit) % 13 ] ...   # but k is undefined? \n\n            Actually, in the second program, for the first character we are at i=0, and we are not using k? \n\n            Because the DP for i=0 is:\n\n                if S[0] is not '?', then:\n\n                    dp[0][ (0 * 10 + digit) % 13 ] += 1   [if we consider k=0? but actually we are iterating k?]\n\n            But wait, the code for the first character (i=0) is handled separately:\n\n                if i==0:\n                    if S[i]!='?':\n                        dp[i][int(S[i])] += 1   -> here we are not using k.\n\n            So for the first character, we do:\n\n                dp[0][int(S[0])] += 1\n\n            But int(S[0]) for S[0]=='-' -> in Python, int('-') throws an exception.\n\n            In C, we are using:\n\n                int digit = S[i] - '0';   -> but that is not the same as converting the entire string? \n\n            Actually, the second program in the original code uses int(S[i]) for a single character. \n\n            In Python, int('-') is invalid. \n\n            In C, we can do:\n\n                char c = S[i];\n                if (c == '-') {\n                    // We cannot convert to a digit -> we have to crash? \n                    // But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we should crash? \n                }\n\n            How does the original Python program crash? \n\n                ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '-'\n\n            We cannot exactly replicate that in C? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\" and the original chain would crash for negative m? \n\n        Therefore, we must assume that m is nonnegative? \n\n        How to ensure m is nonnegative? \n\n            The first program: \n\n                The array a: we are not told the constraints. \n\n                But the candidate: s = sum of a row of b, which is built from a. \n                The row j of b: for a fixed j, the row is [ b[j][0], b[j][1], ... , b[j][n-1] ]\n\n                How is b built? \n\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        m = a[i]\n                        for j in range(n):\n                            k = i - j\n                            if k<0: k += n\n                            m = min(m, a[k])\n                            b[j][i] = m\n\n                Then we compute candidate = sum(b[j]) + x * j   (here the row index is j)\n\n                Then we take the min over j.\n\n                The matrix b: each element b[j][i] is the minimum of a circular segment starting at i and going backwards for j+1 elements? \n\n                Specifically, for fixed j, the element at column i is the minimum of the segment: [ a[i], a[i-1], ..., a[i-j] ] (with wrap if needed).\n\n                Therefore, if a has negative numbers, then b[j][i] can be negative? \n\n                Then the sum for a row j can be negative? \n\n                Then candidate = s + x*j can be negative? \n\n            So we cannot avoid negative m? \n\n        Therefore, we must handle the negative string in the second program? \n\n        But the second program is not designed for negative numbers? \n\n        How did the original author of the second program expect the input? \n\n        The second program: it reads a string that is a pattern for a positive integer? \n\n        The problem states: the entire chain. \n\n        Given the ambiguity, we decide to output the absolute value of m? \n\n        But that would change the behavior.\n\n        Alternatively, we can skip the minus sign? \n\n        How about we interpret the minus sign as a separate character? \n\n        The second program's DP: \n\n            The state: modulo 13. \n\n            The DP state is built as: \n\n                state = (state * 10 + digit) % 13\n\n            But if we have a minus sign, we cannot interpret it as a digit.\n\n        Therefore, we must crash? \n\n        In C, we can crash by:\n\n            if (S[0] == '-') {\n                // We cannot handle negative numbers -> exit with an error? \n                // But the original Python program would throw an exception and print a traceback? \n                // We can simulate by printing an error message and exiting? \n                fprintf(stderr, \"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '%s'\\n\", S);\n                exit(1);\n            }\n\n        But the problem says: \"the last block should handle producing output\", meaning we should not output to stderr? \n\n        And the entire output should be the same? \n\n        How does the original chain output? \n\n            The first program prints m to stdout.\n\n            Then the second program reads that from stdin and then crashes, printing the traceback to stderr? \n\n            Then the third program is not run? \n\n            Then the entire chain outputs nothing to stdout? and the traceback to stderr.\n\n        In C, we can do:\n\n            if (S[0] == '-') {\n                // We simulate the crash by printing the same error as Python? \n                // But we are not required to produce the same stderr? \n                // The problem says: \"behaves identically to the original chain when run on the same input\"\n\n                // The original chain would crash and not produce any output to stdout? \n                // So we should not produce any output to stdout? \n\n                // We can output nothing to stdout and return an error code? \n                // But the problem does not specify the output for this case? \n\n                // Alternatively, we can let the second program's digit conversion fail? \n                // How? \n\n                // In the second program, for the first character:\n                //   if it is not '?' and it is not a digit, then we try to convert it to a digit by subtracting '0' -> but that gives a negative number? \n                //   then we do: \n                //        dp[0][some_negative_index] -> which is out of bounds? \n\n                // We can let it crash by segmentation fault? \n\n                // But that is not controlled.\n\n            }\n\n        To be safe and to match the Python error, we do:\n\n            #include <errno.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n\n            long digit;\n            if (S[i] >= '0' && S[i] <= '9') {\n                digit = S[i] - '0';\n            } else {\n                // This is not a digit -> we simulate the Python error.\n                fprintf(stderr, \"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '%c'\\n\", S[i]);\n                exit(1);\n            }\n\n        But note: the original Python program would crash on the first non-digit that is not '?'. \n\n        In our chain, the only non-digit we expect is '-' at the beginning.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for the second program, when processing each character:\n\n                if the character is not '?' and not between '0' and '9', then we crash.\n\n        This will catch the minus sign.\n\n        Therefore, the C program will crash with an error message to stderr for negative m.\n\n        This matches the behavior of the Python chain.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the last block should handle producing output\", meaning stdout? \n\n        And stderr is separate.\n\n        So we are allowed to output to stderr for errors? \n\n        And the problem does not say we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, we design:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and x, and then list a.\n\n            Step 2: Compute m (the result of the first program).\n\n            Step 3: Convert m to a string. If m is negative, we will have a string starting with '-'.\n\n            Step 4: For the second program, let S = string of m.\n\n            Step 5: For the second program, if the length of S is 1 and the string is \"5\", then we set result2=1.\n                     else if the length is 1, then result2=0.\n                     else if the string contains any character that is not a digit and not '?' -> but in our case, we have no '?' and we might have '-'? \n                     then we crash as described.\n\n            But note: we have no '?' in the string, so we only allow digits. \n\n            So for any non-digit, we crash.\n\n            Step 6: If no crash, then if the string has length>1, we compute the modulus of the number (ignoring any non-digit? but we already crashed on non-digit) and then set result2 = (mod_val==5)?1:0.\n\n            Step 7: Convert result2 to a string (without commas) and then replace commas by spaces? -> but no commas, so we output that string.\n\n        However, wait: the second program in the original code does not crash on non-digit if the character is '?'? \n                but if the character is not '?' and not a digit, then it crashes.\n\n        We are only passing a string of digits or a minus sign (which is not '?' and not a digit) -> so we crash.\n\n        So the chain is defined only for nonnegative m.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem does not specify the constraints, we assume that the input to the first program is such that m is nonnegative.\n\n        But to be safe, we include the crash for non-digit.\n\n Implementation plan:\n\n   We will write a single C program that:\n\n     1. Reads the input for the first program: \n            int n;\n            long long x;   // because x and a[i] might be up to 10^9, and then we multiply by n (2000) -> 2e12, so long long\n            long long *a;  // array of n integers\n\n        We read: \n            scanf(\"%d %lld\", &n, &x);\n            a = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\n            }\n\n     2. Compute the first program's result m:\n\n            We need to build a 2D array b of size n x n? \n\n            But note: n might be up to 2000? then the 2D array has 4e6 elements -> 4e6 * 8 bytes = 32 MB? acceptable.\n\n            Steps for b:\n\n                long long **b = (long long**)malloc(n * sizeof(long long*));\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    b[i] = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n                }\n\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    long long m_val = a[i];   // current minimum for the row j=0 to j=n-1 in column i\n                    for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                        int k = i - j;\n                        if (k < 0) k += n;\n                        // update m_val: m_val = min(m_val, a[k])\n                        if (a[k] < m_val) {\n                            m_val = a[k];\n                        }\n                        b[j][i] = m_val;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then we compute:\n\n                long long min_candidate = 1000000000000000LL; // 10^15\n\n                for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                    long long s = 0;\n                    for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                        s += b[i][j];   // the i-th row\n                    }\n                    long long candidate = s + x * i;\n                    if (candidate < min_candidate) {\n                        min_candidate = candidate;\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Then m = min_candidate.\n\n     3. Convert m to a string.\n\n            We need to be cautious for negative? \n\n            But if m is negative, then we will crash in the second program.\n\n            How to convert: \n\n                char S[50]; // 50 characters is enough for 20 digits and a minus sign.\n\n                if (m < 0) {\n                    // We will convert the absolute value? but then we crash later anyway? \n                    // We can use sprintf to get the string representation.\n                    sprintf(S, \"%lld\", m);\n                } else {\n                    sprintf(S, \"%lld\", m);\n                }\n\n            Then let len = strlen(S);\n\n     4. Second program:\n\n            if (len == 1) {\n                if (S[0]=='5') {\n                    result2 = 1;\n                } else {\n                    result2 = 0;\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Check if any character is not a digit? \n                // But note: if m is negative, we have a minus at the beginning -> we must crash.\n                for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                    if (S[i] < '0' || S[i] > '9') {\n                        // This includes minus and any other non-digit.\n                        fprintf(stderr, \"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '%c'\\n\", S[i]);\n                        exit(1);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Now we compute the modulus mod13.\n                long long res = 0;\n                for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                    res = (res * 10 + (S[i]-'0')) % 13;\n                }\n                if (res == 5) {\n                    result2 = 1;\n                } else {\n                    result2 = 0;\n                }\n            }\n\n     5. Third program: \n\n            Convert result2 to a string: \n                char output3[2]; \n                if (result2 == 1) {\n                    output3[0] = '1';\n                    output3[1] = '\\0';\n                } else {\n                    output3[0] = '0';\n                    output3[1] = '\\0';\n                }\n\n            Then we replace commas by spaces? \n\n                But there are no commas, so we can simply output the string.\n\n            However, we do:\n\n                for (int i=0; output3[i]; i++) {\n                    if (output3[i] == ',') {\n                        putchar(' ');\n                    } else {\n                        putchar(output3[i]);\n                    }\n                }\n                putchar('\\n');\n\n            But the original third program prints the entire string after replacement.\n\n     6. Free memory.\n\n However, note: the second program in the original code does modulo 10^9+7? \n        But in our case, the count is either 0 or 1, so we don't need to mod? \n        But the original program does: \n                for k in range(13):\n                    dp[i][k] %= mod\n\n            and then output dp[n-1][5] mod mod.\n\n        Since 0 and 1 are less than mod, we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the second program's string has more than one digit and no non-digit? Then we computed the modulus and set result2 to 0 or 1.\n\n        Then we output that.\n\n        This matches the original chain.\n\n However, there is a catch: the original second program does not crash on non-digit only if the non-digit is '?'? \n        But in our chain, we have no '?', so we only crash on non-digit that is not '?'.\n\n        And we are crashing on any non-digit.\n\n        But the string we get from the first program's output is an integer string (with optional minus for negative) and no '?'.\n\n        So we are covered.\n\n But note: the second program's original code has an if for n==1? We handled that.\n\n        For n==1: \n            if the string is \"5\", then output 1, else 0.\n\n        But note: what if the string is \"0\"? then we output 0.\n\n        And for n>1, we output 1 only if the entire number mod13 is 5.\n\n        This matches.\n\n Therefore, we write the C program accordingly.\n\n However, note: the first program might output 0? Then the string is \"0\", which has length 1 -> then we check if it is '5'? -> no, so output 0.\n\n        Then the third program outputs \"0\".\n\n        If the first program outputs 5, then the string is \"5\", length=1 -> output 1, then third program outputs \"1\".\n\n        If the first program outputs 18? \n            \"18\": length=2 -> no non-digit -> \n                res = (0*10+1)%13 = 1, then (1*10+8)%13 = 18%13=5 -> output 1.\n\n        So then the third program outputs \"1\".\n\n        If the first program outputs 5 as part of a multi-digit number: e.g., 500? \n            \"500\": \n                res = 0\n                res = (0*10+5)%13 = 5\n                then (5*10+0)%13 = 50%13 = 11\n                then (11*10+0)%13 = 110%13 = 110-13*8=110-104=6 -> not 5 -> output 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n But note: the original second program does:\n\n        dp[0][5] = 1   for the first digit '5'? \n        then for the next digit '0': \n            for state k in [0..12]:\n                new_state = (k*10+0) % 13\n            so for k=5: new_state = 50%13=11 -> so dp[1][11] += 1\n            then for the next digit '0': \n                for state k=11: new_state = (11*10+0)%13 = 110%13=6\n            so dp[2][6] = 1 -> then output 0.\n\n        So we are correct.\n\n Code structure:\n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n   #include <string.h>\n   #include <math.h>\n   #include <errno.h>\n\n   int main() {\n        // Step 1: Read input for the first program\n        int n;\n        long long x;\n        scanf(\"%d %lld\", &n, &x);\n        long long *a = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%lld\", &a[i]);\n        }\n\n        // Step 2: Build the matrix b and compute m\n        // Allocate b: n x n\n        long long **b = (long long**)malloc(n * sizeof(long long*));\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            b[i] = (long long*)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n        }\n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            long long m_val = a[i];\n            for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                int k = i - j;\n                if (k < 0) k += n;\n                if (a[k] < m_val) {\n                    m_val = a[k];\n                }\n                b[j][i] = m_val;\n            }\n        }\n\n        long long min_candidate = 1000000000000000LL; // 10^15\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            long long s = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                s += b[i][j];\n            }\n            long long candidate = s + x * i;\n            if (candidate < min_candidate) {\n                min_candidate = candidate;\n            }\n        }\n        long long m = min_candidate;\n\n        // Free the matrix b\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n            free(b[i]);\n        }\n        free(b);\n        free(a);\n\n        // Step 3: Convert m to a string\n        char S[50];\n        sprintf(S, \"%lld\", m);\n        int len = strlen(S);\n\n        // Step 4: Second program\n        long long result2;\n        if (len == 1) {\n            if (S[0] == '5') {\n                result2 = 1;\n            } else {\n                result2 = 0;\n            }\n        } else {\n            // Check for non-digit\n            for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                if (S[i] < '0' || S[i] > '9') {\n                    // Crash\n                    fprintf(stderr, \"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '%c'\\n\", S[i]);\n                    exit(1);\n                }\n            }\n            // Compute mod 13\n            long long res = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {\n                res = (res * 10 + (S[i]-'0')) % 13;\n            }\n            if (res == 5) {\n                result2 = 1;\n            } else {\n                result2 = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Step 5: Third program\n        // Convert result2 to string\n        char output3[20];\n        sprintf(output3, \"%lld\", result2);   // result2 is either 0 or 1 -> so string \"0\" or \"1\"\n\n        // Now replace commas by spaces?

\n\n        The original: \n            print(input().replace(\",\", \" \"))\n\n        This outputs the string without an extra newline? \n\n        Actually, in Python, the print function by default adds a newline.\n\n        So the original third program outputs the string with a newline.\n\n        We do putchar('\\n') at the end.\n\n        But wait: if the third program's input is \"1\", then output is \"1\\n\".\n\n        So we are matching.\n\n However, the third program in the original code reads a string and then replaces commas and prints. \n        It does not specify the newline? \n\n        But the input to the third program is the output of the second program, which is printed by:\n\n            print(dp[n-1][5] % mod)\n\n        This prints an integer and then a newline? \n\n        Then the third program reads the entire line including the newline? \n\n        But the original second program: \n\n            print(dp[n-1][5] % mod)\n\n        This outputs the integer and then a newline.\n\n        Then the third program: \n\n            s = input()   # this reads a line, which includes the integer and then the newline? \n\n            Then it replaces commas in that entire string? \n\n            Then it prints the string (which now has the newline at the end) and then the print function adds another newline? \n\n        So the third program outputs the integer string (with commas replaced) and then two newlines? \n\n        But no: \n\n            The input() function in the original second program (File2) is defined as:\n\n                def input():\n                    return sys.stdin.readline()[: -1]   # this removes the last character, which is the newline.\n\n            So the string S in the second program does not have a newline.\n\n            And the second program prints without a newline? \n\n            Actually, the print function in Python adds a newline by default.\n\n            So the second program prints the integer and then a newline.\n\n            Then the third program reads from stdin: the next line? \n\n            But the entire output of the second program is one integer and a newline.\n\n            Then the third program: \n\n                s = input()   # this reads the entire line without the newline? \n\n                But wait: the third program uses the same input function? \n\n            Actually, the third program is:\n\n                print(input().replace(\",\", \" \"))\n\n            And it does not redefine input? \n\n            So it uses the built-in input? \n\n            But in the original chain, the third program is run independently? \n\n            Therefore, it reads the entire line from stdin, which is the output of the second program: the integer and a newline? \n\n            The built-in input() in Python reads a line and returns it as a string without the trailing newline.\n\n            Then the third program replaces commas in that string (which is the integer string without the newline) and then prints it, and the print adds a newline.\n\n            So the entire output is: the integer string (without commas) and then a newline.\n\n        In our C program, we are outputting the integer string (which is either \"0\" or \"1\") and then a newline.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        But note: the second program in the chain (File2) redefines input to remove the last character? \n\n            def input():\n                return sys.stdin.readline()[: -1]\n\n            So when the second program runs, it reads the output of the first program (the integer and a newline) and then removes the newline? \n\n            Then the second program processes the string without the newline.\n\n            Then the second program prints the result (without a newline? because the print function in the second program does: \n\n                print(dp[n-1][5] % mod)   -> which by default adds a newline.\n\n            So the output of the second program is a string of digits and a newline.\n\n            Then the third program reads a line: it gets the digits and the newline? \n\n            Then the third program's input() (built-in) reads a line and returns without the newline? -> so it returns the digits.\n\n            Then it replaces commas? none, then prints the digits and a newline.\n\n        So the entire output is: the digits and a newline.\n\n        In our C program, the second program is simulated on the string without the newline? \n\n            Because we converted the integer m to a string without a newline.\n\n            Then we computed the second program's result and then we output that result as a string and then a newline.\n\n        So we are not including the newline in the processing of the second program? \n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Note: We assume the input integers (n, x, and the list a) are within the limits.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the original second program (File2) sets recursion limit and imports modules, but we don't need that.\n\n   We only need to replicate the behavior on the specific input (the string representation of m).\n\n   We do not use recursion in the second program's simulation.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   We'll write the C program as described.\n\n   But note: the third program is very simple: replace commas by spaces. We do that on the string representation of result2.\n\n   Since the string representation of result2 is either \"0\" or \"1\", we don't have commas, so we output the same.\n\n   We do the replacement anyway for correctness.\n\n   Code:\n\n      for (int i=0; output3[i]; i++) {\n          if (output3[i] == ',') {\n              putchar(' ');\n          } else {\n              putchar(output3[i]);\n          }\n      }\n      putchar('\\n');\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Let's write the entire C program."
