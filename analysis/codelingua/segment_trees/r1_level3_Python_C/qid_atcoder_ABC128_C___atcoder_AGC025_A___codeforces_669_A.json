The number of valid bitmasks is at most 2^(q_size) which is 2^50? Then worst-case 2^50 * 2^50 = 2^100 -> too big? But note: the valid bitmasks are at most 2^(q_size) and each adds 2^(v_size). So worst-case total is 2^(q_size) * 2^(v_size) = 2^(n) which is 2^50 -> about 1e15, which fits in a long long (since 2^60 is about 1e18). But note: q_size + v_size = n. So 2^(n) is the total. So we can use: long long ans1 = 0; and then add (1LL << v_size) for each valid bitmask. However, worst-case: 2^(q_size) * (1<<v_size) = 2^(q_size+v_size)=2^n, which is 2^50 (about 1e15) -> which is acceptable in a long long? long long is 64 bits: up to 9e18, so 2^50 is 1e15 -> fits. Step 2: Now we have ans1 (a long long). Then we have to run the second program. The second program: \n            Input: a string representation of ans1. We have to check if the string is exactly one of: \"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\". If it is, then ans2 = 10. Else, we compute the sum of the digits of the string. How to convert a long long to a string? We can use sprintf. Steps:\n\n            char str_ans1[100]; // enough for 20 digits\n            sprintf(str_ans1, \"%lld\", ans1); Then:\n\n            const char* a [] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n            int found = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n                if (strcmp(str_ans1, a[i]) == 0) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (found) {\n                ans2 = 10;\n            } else {\n                ans2 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; str_ans1[i]; i++) {\n                    ans2 += str_ans1[i] - '0';\n                }\n            }\n\n        Note: the second program outputs ans2 (an integer). Step 3: Then the third program: \n        ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3;   // integer division\n\n        Then print ans3. However, note: the third program uses integer input? And we have ans2 as an integer. So: \n            int ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3; But note: in Python, (n*2+1)//3: if n is 0? (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3 -> 0? But integer division truncates? Actually, the Python code: (0*2+1)//3 = 0. In C: (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3 -> 0? Because integer division truncates toward zero? Yes. But what if negative? The problem: the input to the third program is nonnegative?",

Example: if ans2=1: (1*2+1)=3 -> 3/3=1 -> integer. if ans2=2: (2*2+1)=5 -> 5/3=1 (in integer division) -> which is floor(5/3)=1. So it's the same. Now, we write the C code accordingly.

Then q_size <= 10 -> 2^10 = 1024, which is acceptable. But what if the problem allows n up to 50? Then we need a better solution? But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we have to use the same algorithm. And the original Python code would be too slow for n=50? Then we must assume that the input is small?

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to translate the entire sequence of Python programs into a single C program.\n The first program (File1) reads:\n   - n, m\n   - then m lines, each starting with a number k and then k integers (but note: the first number is the count, but in the code we do `input().split()` and then take [1:], so we skip the first number? Actually, the code reads the entire line, splits, and then takes from index 1 to the end. So the first number is the count, but we ignore it and take the rest.\n   - then a line of m integers (p)\n\n The second program (File2) reads a string `n` and then does:\n   - if the string is in the list a = [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"] then it prints 10\n   - else, it prints the sum of the digits (each digit converted to integer)\n\n The third program (File3) reads an integer `n` and prints `(n*2+1)//3`.\n\n However, note the chain: the output of the first program becomes the input of the second, and the output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But wait: the first program outputs an integer (ans). The second program expects a string (n = input()). The third program expects an integer.\n\n How the chain is connected?\n   Input to the first program: the initial input (from stdin)\n   Output of first program: an integer (ans) -> becomes input to the second program as a string? But note: the second program reads a string.\n\n However, the second program expects a string of digits. The first program outputs a number. So we have to convert the integer output of the first program to a string to feed into the second.\n\n Similarly, the second program outputs an integer (either 10 or the sum of digits) which is then read by the third program as an integer.\n\n But note: the second program's output is printed, and then the third program reads from stdin. In the chain, the output of the first program is the entire output (only one integer) and that is the input to the second.\n\n However, the problem says: the entire sequence is executed in sequence, where the output of each program is used as the input to the next.\n\n So we have to simulate:\n\n   Step1: Read the initial input (for the first program) from stdin.\n   Step2: Run the first program and capture its output (ans) as an integer.\n   Step3: Convert that integer to a string and use it as input to the second program.\n   Step4: Run the second program on that string and capture its output (which is an integer, either 10 or the sum of digits).\n   Step5: Use that integer as input to the third program, which then outputs the final result.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Translate the entire sequence into a single C program that reproduces the same behavior.\"\n\n And:\n   - Only the first block should handle reading input.\n   - Only the last block should handle producing output.\n   - Intermediate steps should process data without I/O.\n\n So we will:\n   - Read all the initial input (for the first program) at the beginning.\n   - Then do the computation of the first program, storing the result in a variable (say, ans1).\n   - Then use ans1 as input for the second program (without I/O, so we convert ans1 to a string in memory and then run the second program's logic on that string, storing the result as ans2).\n   - Then use ans2 as input for the third program, and then output the result of the third program.\n\n But note: the first program also reads additional input after n and m: m lines and then a line of p.\n\n So we must read the entire input for the first program at the beginning.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and m (two integers).\n 2. For m times, read a line: we know the first token is the count (but we don't need it, we skip it and then take the rest of the tokens in the line? Actually, the Python code does: `input().split()` and then takes [1:], so we skip the first token. But note: the problem does not specify that the first token is the count? However, the input format for the first program is the same as the problem \"Switches\" in ABC? Anyway, we have to read the next m lines and for each line, split and skip the first token? Actually, the Python code does: `list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]`. So we read the entire line, split by spaces, then skip the first element.\n\n 3. Then read a line of m integers (p).\n\n 4. Then compute the first program.\n\n 5. Then the output of the first program (ans) becomes the input to the second program.\n\n 6. The second program: we have to check if the string representation of ans is exactly one of the strings in [\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"]? If yes, then the output of the second program is 10. Otherwise, we compute the sum of the digits.\n\n 7. Then the output of the second program (an integer) becomes the input to the third program: which outputs (n*2+1)//3.\n\n However, note: the third program reads an integer and then prints. So we don't need to do I/O in between.\n\n Plan for the C program:\n\n   Step 1: Read the initial input (n, m, then m lines, then the p array).\n\n   Step 2: Compute the first program (which we'll call `ans1`).\n\n   Step 3: Convert `ans1` to a string (we have to be cautious: `ans1` is an integer, we need to convert to a string without any extra spaces).\n\n   Step 4: For the second program:\n        Check if the string is one of the predefined strings: \"10\", \"100\", ... up to \"100000\".\n        If it is, then set `ans2 = 10`.\n        Else, convert each character of the string to a digit and sum them up to get `ans2`.\n\n   Step 5: For the third program: compute `ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3`? But note: in Python, it uses integer floor division. In C, we have to use integer arithmetic: (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3 might be a float, so we use integer division? Actually, the Python code uses `//` which is floor division. However, note that (n*2+1) is always positive? Then we can use integer division.\n\n        But note: in C, for positive integers, `(a * 2 + 1) / 3` using integer division (truncation) is the same as floor division? Yes.\n\n        However, let me check: in Python, (n*2+1)//3 is the same as (n*2+1)/3 in C when using integer division? Actually, in C, if we do integer division, it truncates towards zero. Since n*2+1 is positive, then yes, it is the same as floor.\n\n   Step 6: Print `ans3`.\n\n Implementation details for the first program:\n\n   We have:\n     n, m\n     li: a list of m lists, each list is the integers in the line (without the first token) for that line.\n     p: a tuple of m integers (the next line)\n\n   Steps in the first program:\n\n     q = set of all elements in li (flattened)\n     r = set(range(1, n+1))\n     v = r - q   (the elements that are in r but not in q)\n\n     Then we iterate:\n        for i in range(0, len(q)+1):   -> i from 0 to |q|\n          for each combination of q of size i (call this combination s, which we treat as a set)\n          then for each (u, w) in zip(li, p):\n               u is a list (from li), w is an integer from p\n               if (len( set(s) \u2229 set(u) ) % 2 != w) then break (this combination doesn't work)\n          else: (if we didn't break) then we add 2^(len(v)) to the answer.\n\n   How to do in C?\n\n   Challenges:\n     - We need to handle sets and combinations. Since n is at most 50 (probably, because the problem is from ABC128C) but let's check: the constraints? The problem doesn't specify, but we have to assume worst-case.\n\n     However, note: the set `q` is the union of all the lists. The size of `q` can be at most n (which is up to 50). So we can iterate over combinations of a set of size |q|, which is at most 50? That would be 2^(|q|) which is 2^50 -> too big.\n\n   Wait: actually the code iterates i from 0 to |q| and then for each combination of size i? That would be the entire power set? The loop is over all subsets? Actually, `itertools.combinations(q, i)` for i from 0 to |q| is the same as the power set. The total number of subsets is 2^(|q|). Since |q| <= n and n<=50? That is 2^50 which is 1e15, too slow.\n\n   But note: the problem in ABC128C has n, m <= 50? Actually, in the problem statement (if we recall) the constraints are: n, m up to 50? So worst-case 2^50 is about 1e15, which is too many iterations.\n\n   However, the original Python code does that. We cannot run that in C in a reasonable time? So we must optimize.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So we have to do the same, even if it is inefficient? Or is there a more efficient way?\n\n   Actually, the intended solution for ABC128C is to use bitmask DP? But the code we are given is brute force over the free variables? The set `v` (the variables that don't appear in any switch) are free: they can be on or off arbitrarily, so they contribute a factor of 2^(len(v)). Then we iterate over the subsets of `q`? But note: the variables in `q` are the ones that appear in at least one switch.\n\n   However, the problem constraints: n (switches) up to 50? But m (lights) up to 50? And each switch appears in at most ...? The total size of q is at most 50? But 2^(|q|) is 2^50 which is too slow.\n\n   But wait: the original problem (ABC128C) constraints: n, m up to 50? Then 2^50 is 1e15 which is too slow in Python? Actually, the problem might have a constraint that the number of switches per light is small? Or the intended solution is different.\n\n   However, the provided Python code is written and we have to translate it as is.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Translate the entire sequence\", so we have to do the same algorithm.\n\n   However, we must note: the problem constraints in the original problem (ABC128C) are: n, m at most 10? Actually, I recall that in ABC128C, n (switches) and m (lights) are at most 10? Or 50? But 50 would be too heavy.\n\n   Let me check: the problem \"Switches\" in ABC128C: n and m are at most 10? Actually, the constraints: n, m up to 10? Then 2^(n) is 2^10 = 1024, which is acceptable.\n\n   But the code we are given does:\n\n        for i in range(0, len(q)+1):\n            for s in itertools.combinations(q, i):\n\n   This is iterating over the power set of `q`. The size of `q` is at most n (which is at most 10) -> 2^10 = 1024.\n\n   So we can do it.\n\n   Steps for the first program in C:\n\n     Precompute:\n        r: set of integers from 1 to n.\n        q: set of all integers that appear in any of the lists (so we have to collect all numbers from the m lines, skipping the first token of each line).\n\n        v = r - q -> the free switches.\n\n        Then, we want to iterate over every subset of `q`. How to represent sets? We can use bit masks? But the set `q` is not necessarily contiguous? And we don't have the elements as indices.\n\n     Alternatively, we can:\n\n        - Create an array for the set `q` and then generate combinations by index? Then we have a mapping from index to element.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Collect all the numbers that appear in any of the lists (without duplicates) and form an array for `q_arr` (the set q as a sorted array?).\n\n          Step 2: The size of `q_arr` is `q_size`.\n\n          Step 3: Then we iterate over bitmask from 0 to (1<<q_size). For each bitmask, we form the set s: which is the set of elements in `q_arr` for which the bit is set.\n\n          Step 4: Then for each light j (from 0 to m-1):\n                   u = li[j]   (the j-th list)\n                   w = p[j]\n                   Count the number of elements in the intersection of the set s and the set u? Actually, we don't need the entire set, we only need the parity (mod2) of the size of the intersection? How about:\n\n                   We can precompute for each light j and for each element in `q_arr` whether that element is in u? Then for the set s (represented by the bitmask), we can compute:\n\n                         parity = 0;\n                         for each element index k in [0, q_size-1]:\n                             if the bitmask has the k-th bit set AND the element q_arr[k] is in u, then flip the parity (XOR).\n\n                   But note: the condition is the size of the intersection mod2. We can compute:\n\n                         parity = 0;\n                         for (int k = 0; k < q_size; k++) {\n                             if (bitmask & (1<<k)) {\n                                 // then the element q_arr[k] is in the set s\n                                 // check if q_arr[k] is in u?\n                                 // How to check quickly? We can precompute a boolean matrix: light j and element index k: is q_arr[k] in the list u_j?\n                             }\n                         }\n\n                   Then if parity != w, then break.\n\n          Step 5: If we didn't break for any light, then we add 2^(len(v)) to the answer.\n\n        But note: the free set v: each free switch can be on or off arbitrarily, and that doesn't affect the conditions (because they don't appear in any list). So they are independent: each free switch doubles the count.\n\n        Therefore, the total for a valid s is 2^(|v|).\n\n        And we do that for every valid subset s of q.\n\n     However, note: the original code does:\n\n            for i in range(0, len(q)+1):\n                for s in itertools.combinations(q, i):\n\n        That is, it iterates over subsets of size i. But we are iterating by bitmask and the bitmask does not care about the order. So we are iterating over all subsets.\n\n     So the algorithm:\n\n        ans1 = 0;\n        for (bitmask = 0; bitmask < (1<<q_size); bitmask++) {\n            int valid = 1;\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n                int parity = 0;\n                // For the j-th light: we have the list u_j and the condition p_j\n                // For each element in q_arr: if the bit is set and the element is in u_j, then flip parity.\n                for (int k = 0; k < q_size; k++) {\n                    if (bitmask & (1<<k)) {\n                        // Check if q_arr[k] is in the list u_j?\n                        // We precomputed a 2D array: in_light[j][k] (1 if the element q_arr[k] is in the j-th list, else 0)\n                        if (in_light[j][k]) {\n                            parity ^= 1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                if (parity != p[j]) {\n                    valid = 0;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (valid) {\n                ans1 += (1 << v_size);   // because 2^(v_size)\n            }\n        }\n\n     But note: the set `v` is the set of switches that are not in any light? They don't appear in any list. So they are free: each can be on or off arbitrarily. So for any configuration of the switches in `q`, we can set the switches in `v` arbitrarily. Hence, each valid configuration of `q` gives 2^(v_size) valid configurations.\n\n     So we do: ans1 += (1 << v_size) for each valid bitmask.\n\n     However, what if v_size is 0? Then 1<<0 is 1.\n\n     Precomputation:\n\n        We need:\n          q_arr: an array of the distinct elements that appear in the lists (without duplicates). We can build this by:\n\n            int* q_arr = NULL;\n            int q_size = 0;\n            // We have the lists: we stored them as a 2D array? We have to read the m lines.\n\n            // We'll create a set (using a boolean array or a hash set) of integers that appear? Since n is at most 50, we can use an array `in_q` of size n+1 (index from 1 to n) to mark if the switch is in any list.\n\n            Then v_size = n - (number of distinct switches that appear in the lists)\n\n            And then we can build q_arr: an array of the distinct switches that appear? Actually, we don't need the distinct set for the array? We can also note that the same element might appear multiple times? But we want distinct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n            bool in_q[51] = {0}; // index 1..n\n            for each list in the m lists:\n                for each number in that list:\n                    in_q[number] = true;\n\n            Then v_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (!in_q[i]) {\n                    v_size++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            Then we want to build q_arr: the elements that are in_q. We can do:\n\n            q_arr = (int*) malloc(q_size * sizeof(int));\n            int idx = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_arr[idx++] = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then we precompute a 2D boolean array for in_light: for each light j and each element in q_arr (by index k), we set:\n\n            in_light[j][k] = 0 or 1.\n\n        How? For light j, we have the list of switches (without the first token). We stored that list. Then we can check for each element q_arr[k] if it is in that list? But note: the list for light j is stored as an array of integers. We can precompute a boolean array for each light j: present[51]? Then we can set:\n\n            for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                // We have the j-th list: let it be stored as an array `list_j` of length len_j (we stored the length? we read the line and then stored the tokens)\n                // We can create a boolean array for the j-th light: for switch i from 1 to n: is present?\n                // But we only care about the ones in q_arr? Actually, for the ones not in q_arr, they are free and we don't consider them in the condition? The condition only depends on the switches in the list, which are in q.\n\n            }\n\n        Actually, we can precompute a 2D array: `in_light` of size m x q_size.\n\n        For j in [0, m-1]:\n            For k in [0, q_size-1]:\n                in_light[j][k] = (is q_arr[k] in the j-th list?) -> we can do by scanning the j-th list? But we can precompute for each light j a boolean array for switches 1..n? Then for k, we look at the switch number q_arr[k] and check the j-th light's presence array.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            bool* light_switches = (bool*) calloc(n+1, sizeof(bool)); // for light j\n            for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                // we have the j-th list: an array `list_j` of integers (without the count) of length? we don't know the length? Actually, we read the line: we split and then skip the first token. But the first token was the count? So the rest of the tokens: the number of tokens is the count? Actually, we don't need the count.\n\n            }\n\n        How we stored the lists? We can store:\n\n            int** lists; // m lists, each list is an array of integers (the numbers in the line after the first token)\n            int* list_lengths; // but we don't need the length? Actually, we don't: we just need to know which switches are in the list.\n\n        We can store for each light j an array of booleans of length (n+1) (index 1..n) that is true if the switch is in the list.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n, m.\n\n            lists = (int**) malloc(m * sizeof(int*));\n            // Actually, we don't need to store the numbers? We can build the presence array for each light.\n\n            bool light_presence[m][n+1];   // We can use VLA if m and n are known at runtime? But m and n are read. We can use dynamic allocation.\n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid storing the lists and just store the presence arrays.\n\n            Read the next m lines:\n\n                for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                    // read the entire line? We can use fgets and then strtok?\n                    // But we know the first token is the count? We don't need it.\n\n                    // Actually, the input: the first token is k (the number of switches in this light), then k integers.\n\n                    // We can read k, then skip k integers? But then we don't store the integers? We need to know which switches are in the list.\n\n                    // Instead, we can:\n\n                    int k;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                    // Then we read k integers and mark in the presence array for light i: for each integer x, set light_presence[i][x] = 1.\n\n                }\n\n            Then we don't need to store the lists? We only need the presence arrays for the condition.\n\n        Then:\n\n            // Build in_q: a boolean array for switches that appear in any light.\n            bool in_q[n+1];\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                in_q[i] = 0;\n                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                    if (light_presence[j][i]) {\n                        in_q[i] = 1;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Then v_size: count the switches from 1 to n that are not in_q.\n\n            // Build q_arr: the distinct switches that are in_q? We can also just use the indices 1..n and then represent the set s as a bitmask over the entire set? But note: the set s is only over the switches in q? And the free switches are independent.\n\n            However, the condition for a light j: only the switches in the list (which are in q) are considered? Yes.\n\n            But note: the condition: the size of the intersection mod2. The free switches are not in any list, so they don't appear. So we can ignore them in the condition.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid building q_arr? We can iterate over the entire set of switches that are in_q? But we have to form subsets of q. We can do:\n\n            for (bitmask over the entire set of n switches? But that would be 2^n which is 2^50 -> too slow).\n\n        So we stick to building q_arr for the switches that are in_q.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            q_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_size++;\n                }\n            }\n            // Now we know q_size, then we build q_arr of length q_size:\n            int q_arr[q_size];\n            int index = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_arr[index++] = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Then we precompute in_light: a 2D array of m x q_size? Actually, we can avoid: we have light_presence[j][x] for each switch x. Then for a switch q_arr[k] (which is an integer x), we can use light_presence[j][x]. So we don't need to build a separate 2D array.\n\n        Then the inner loop for light j:\n\n            int parity = 0;\n            for (int k=0; k<q_size; k++) {\n                if (bitmask & (1<<k)) {\n                    int sw = q_arr[k];\n                    if (light_presence[j][sw]) {\n                        parity ^= 1;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then check parity against p[j].\n\n     But note: the condition in the Python code: `len(s & set(u)) % 2 != w` -> if the condition fails, break. And note: w is either 0 or 1.\n\n     Then if parity (which is the mod2 size of the intersection) is not equal to w, then break.\n\n   Step 5: Read the next line for p: m integers.\n\n        We read m integers and store in an array p.\n\n   So overall for the first program:\n\n        Read n, m.\n\n        // We'll use: \n        bool light_presence[m][n+1]; // but m and n are variables -> we can use dynamic allocation or VLA? We can use VLA if the compiler supports.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            bool **light_presence = (bool**) malloc(m * sizeof(bool*));\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                light_presence[i] = (bool*) calloc(n+1, sizeof(bool));\n            }\n\n        Then:\n\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                int k;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                for (int j=0; j<k; j++) {\n                    int x;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n                    light_presence[i][x] = true;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then read the array p: m integers.\n\n            int p[m];\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]);\n            }\n\n        Then build in_q: an array of booleans for switches 1..n that appear in at least one light.\n\n            bool in_q[n+1];\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                in_q[i] = false;\n                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                    if (light_presence[j][i]) {\n                        in_q[i] = true;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then compute v_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (!in_q[i]) {\n                    v_size++;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then build q_arr: an array of the switches that are in_q.\n\n            int q_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_size++;\n                }\n            }\n            int q_arr[q_size];\n            int idx = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_arr[idx++] = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then we iterate over bitmask from 0 to (1<<q_size):\n\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            for (int bitmask=0; bitmask < (1<<q_size); bitmask++) {\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                    int parity = 0;\n                    for (int k=0; k<q_size; k++) {\n                        if (bitmask & (1<<k)) {\n                            int sw = q_arr[k];\n                            if (light_presence[j][sw]) {\n                                parity ^= 1;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (parity != p[j]) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (valid) {\n                    ans1 += (1LL << v_size);   // because 2^(v_size) and v_size can be up to 50? so use long long shift.\n                }\n            }\n\n        Note: ans1 must be long long? Because 2^(v_size) might be 2^50 which is about 1e15, and then multiplied by the number of valid bitmasks? The number of valid bitmasks is at most 2^(q_size) which is 2^50? Then worst-case 2^50 * 2^50 = 2^100 -> too big? But note: the valid bitmasks are at most 2^(q_size) and each adds 2^(v_size). So worst-case total is 2^(q_size) * 2^(v_size) = 2^(n) which is 2^50 -> about 1e15, which fits in a long long (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\n        But note: q_size + v_size = n. So 2^(n) is the total.\n\n        So we can use: long long ans1 = 0; and then add (1LL << v_size) for each valid bitmask.\n\n        However, worst-case: 2^(q_size) * (1<<v_size) = 2^(q_size+v_size)=2^n, which is 2^50 (about 1e15) -> which is acceptable in a long long? long long is 64 bits: up to 9e18, so 2^50 is 1e15 -> fits.\n\n   Step 2: Now we have ans1 (a long long). Then we have to run the second program.\n\n        The second program: \n            Input: a string representation of ans1.\n\n            We have to check if the string is exactly one of: \"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\".\n\n            If it is, then ans2 = 10.\n            Else, we compute the sum of the digits of the string.\n\n        How to convert a long long to a string? We can use sprintf.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            char str_ans1[100]; // enough for 20 digits\n            sprintf(str_ans1, \"%lld\", ans1);\n\n            Then:\n\n            const char* a[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n            int found = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n                if (strcmp(str_ans1, a[i]) == 0) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (found) {\n                ans2 = 10;\n            } else {\n                ans2 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; str_ans1[i]; i++) {\n                    ans2 += str_ans1[i] - '0';\n                }\n            }\n\n        Note: the second program outputs ans2 (an integer).\n\n   Step 3: Then the third program: \n        ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3;   // integer division\n\n        Then print ans3.\n\n   However, note: the third program uses integer input? And we have ans2 as an integer.\n\n        So: \n            int ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3;\n\n        But note: in Python, (n*2+1)//3: if n is 0? (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3 -> 0? But integer division truncates? Actually, the Python code: (0*2+1)//3 = 0.\n\n        In C: (0*2+1)/3 = 1/3 -> 0? Because integer division truncates toward zero? Yes.\n\n        But what if negative? The problem: the input to the third program is nonnegative? Because the second program outputs either 10 (positive) or the sum of digits (nonnegative). So we are safe.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        #include <stdlib.h>\n        #include <string.h>\n        #include <stdbool.h>\n\n        int main() {\n            int n, m;\n            scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\n            // Allocate for light_presence: m arrays of n+1 booleans\n            bool **light_presence = (bool**) malloc(m * sizeof(bool*));\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                light_presence[i] = (bool*) calloc(n+1, sizeof(bool));\n            }\n\n            // Read the m lines\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                int k;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &k);\n                for (int j=0; j<k; j++) {\n                    int x;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &x);\n                    light_presence[i][x] = true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Read p: m integers\n            int p[m];\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Build in_q: an array for switches 1..n: if the switch appears in any light?\n            bool in_q[n+1];\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                in_q[i] = false;\n                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                    if (light_presence[j][i]) {\n                        in_q[i] = true;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Count v_size: the free switches (not in any light)\n            int v_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (!in_q[i]) {\n                    v_size++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Build q_arr: the switches that are in at least one light (in_q)\n            int q_size = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_size++;\n                }\n            }\n            int *q_arr = (int*) malloc(q_size * sizeof(int));\n            int idx = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                if (in_q[i]) {\n                    q_arr[idx++] = i;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now iterate over bitmasks for the set q_arr (size q_size)\n            long long ans1 = 0;\n            for (int bitmask=0; bitmask < (1<<q_size); bitmask++) {\n                int valid = 1;\n                for (int j=0; j<m; j++) {\n                    int parity = 0;\n                    for (int k=0; k<q_size; k++) {\n                        if (bitmask & (1<<k)) {\n                            int sw = q_arr[k];\n                            if (light_presence[j][sw]) {\n                                parity ^= 1;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (parity != p[j]) {\n                        valid = 0;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (valid) {\n                    ans1 += (1LL << v_size);   // 2^(v_size)\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Free the allocated memory for light_presence and q_arr?\n            for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n                free(light_presence[i]);\n            }\n            free(light_presence);\n            free(q_arr);\n\n            // Now, we have ans1 (long long) -> convert to string for the second program.\n            char str_ans1[100];\n            sprintf(str_ans1, \"%lld\", ans1);\n\n            // Predefined strings for the second program\n            const char *a[] = {\"10\", \"100\", \"1000\", \"10000\", \"100000\"};\n            int found = 0;\n            for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n                if (strcmp(str_ans1, a[i]) == 0) {\n                    found = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n\n            int ans2;\n            if (found) {\n                ans2 = 10;\n            } else {\n                ans2 = 0;\n                for (int i=0; str_ans1[i]!='\\0'; i++) {\n                    ans2 += str_ans1[i] - '0';\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Now the third program: \n            int ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3;   // integer division\n\n            // Output the final answer.\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", ans3);\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n   Note: We assume that the input n, m are at most 50? Then q_size <= 50? But the bitmask loop: 2^(q_size) which is 2^50 -> 1e15, which is too slow in C? We cannot run that.\n\n   However, the constraints of the original problem (ABC128C) are: n, m at most 10? Then q_size <= 10 -> 2^10 = 1024, which is acceptable.\n\n   But what if the problem allows n up to 50? Then we need a better solution? But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we have to use the same algorithm. And the original Python code would be too slow for n=50? Then we must assume that the input is small? Or we must optimize.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the constraints. But the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". So for small inputs (like the sample) it should work.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the first program (the Python code) is only efficient for small q_size (like <= 10). So we assume the input constraints are small.\n\n   Let me test with the sample from ABC128C:\n\n        Sample input: \n            2 2\n            2 1 2\n            1 2\n            0 1\n\n        Then n=2, m=2.\n\n        Then q: from the lists: \n            first list: [1,2] -> q = {1,2} -> q_size=2, v_size=0.\n        Then we iterate over subsets of q: 4 subsets.\n\n        Conditions for light0: p[0]=0 -> the intersection size mod2 must be 0.\n        Condition for light1: p[1]=1 -> the intersection size mod2 must be 1.\n\n        Check each subset:\n\n            {}: \n                light0: {} \u2229 {1,2} = {} -> size0 mod2=0 -> OK.\n                light1: {} \u2229 {2} = {} -> size0 mod2=0 -> not 1 -> invalid.\n\n            {1}:\n                light0: {1} \u2229 {1,2} = {1} -> size1 mod2=1 -> not 0 -> invalid.\n\n            {2}:\n                light0: {2} \u2229 {1,2} = {2} -> size1 mod2=1 -> invalid.\n                light1: {2} \u2229 {2} = {2} -> size1 mod2=1 -> OK. -> but light0 fails.\n\n            {1,2}:\n                light0: {1,2} \u2229 {1,2} = {1,2} -> size2 mod2=0 -> OK.\n                light1: {1,2} \u2229 {2} = {2} -> size1 mod2=1 -> OK.\n\n                Then valid: add 2^(v_size)=2^0=1.\n\n        So ans1=1.\n\n        Then the second program: input string \"1\"\n            not in the list -> then sum of digits=1 -> ans2=1.\n\n        Then the third program: (1*2+1)//3 = (3)//3 = 1.\n\n        Output: 1.\n\n        But the expected output for the first program (ABC128C) is 1? Then the entire chain: 1 -> second program:1 -> third:1.\n\n   However, the original first program (in the provided code) outputs 1.\n\n   But the sample in ABC128C: the answer is 1? So it matches.\n\n   But note: the second program: \n        n = input() -> string \"1\"\n        a = [\"10\", \"100\", ...] -> \"1\" is not in there -> so sum=1 -> then third program: (1*2+1)//3 = 3//3=1.\n\n   So the final output is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the C program should output 1.\n\n   However, we have to be cautious: the first program might output 0? Then the second program: \n        \"0\" -> not in the list -> sum=0 -> then third: (0*2+1)//3 = 1//3 = 0.\n\n   So we code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the first program might output a very large number? Then the string conversion: we use %lld.\n\n   We assume that the long long is 64 bits.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, the third program: (n*2+1)//3: if n is 10, then (20+1)//3 = 21//3=7? But the second program: if the string is \"10\", then we output 10. Then the third: (10*2+1)=21 -> 21//3=7.\n\n   But the third program: (n*2+1)//3: integer division? So 21/3=7.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        ans3 = (ans2 * 2 + 1) / 3;\n\n   Because integer division in C truncates toward zero? And for positive numbers, it is the same as floor.\n\n   But note: if (ans2*2+1) is divisible by 3? Then it's an integer. Otherwise, we truncate? Actually, we want floor division? Since (ans2*2+1) is positive, then truncation is floor.\n\n   Example: if ans2=1: (1*2+1)=3 -> 3/3=1 -> integer.\n            if ans2=2: (2*2+1)=5 -> 5/3=1 (in integer division) -> which is floor(5/3)=1.\n\n   So it's the same.\n\n   Now, we write the C code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must free the memory? But the program ends soon. It's optional.\n\n   Let me write the code.\n\n   One more note: the first program might have no free switches? Then v_size=0, and 1<<0 is 1.\n\n   We use: 1LL << v_size -> if v_size=0, then 1.\n\n   We assume v_size is nonnegative.\n\n   Code:\n\n   (We use C99 for VLAs? But we use dynamic allocation for light_presence and q_arr.)\n\n   We'll write without VLAs.\n\n   Note: the array p: we use VLA for p? Or we can use dynamic allocation? But m is known.\n\n   We can use: int p[m]; // if the compiler supports VLA? We assume.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        int *p = (int*) malloc(m * sizeof(int));\n\n   Then free.\n\n   But for simplicity, we use VLA if the compiler supports.\n\n   We'll write for a C99 compiler.\n\n   But note: we are using nested loops that might be heavy if q_size is large? But we assume q_size is small.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: if n=0? Then the first program: \n        r = set(range(1,1)) -> empty.\n        q = set().\n        v = r - q = empty.\n        Then we iterate over subsets of q: only the empty set? Then we check the conditions? The conditions: for each light, we have a list and a condition.\n\n        But m might be 0? Then the condition loop runs 0 times -> valid, then ans1 = 2^(len(v))=2^0=1.\n\n        Then second program: string \"1\" -> not in the list -> sum=1 -> then third: (1*2+1)//3=1.\n\n   So output 1.\n\n   If n=0 and m=0? Then we read n=0, m=0.\n\n        Then we skip reading the m lines? Then we read p: 0 integers? Then the p array is empty.\n\n        Then in_q: for i from 1 to 0? Then v_size=0, q_size=0.\n\n        Then the bitmask loop: from 0 to 1 (bitmask=0). Then check for j from 0 to m-1 (which is 0 times) -> valid. Then add 2^0=1 -> ans1=1.\n\n   So it's consistent.\n\n   Now, write the code.\n\n   Important: the condition in the inner loop for the lights: we break if one fails.\n\n   We assume: m can be 0? Then the loop j from 0 to m-1: runs 0 times -> valid remains 1.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        for (int j=0; j<m; j++) { ... }\n\n   If m==0, then no iterations -> valid=1 -> then we add.\n\n   That matches.\n\n   We'll write accordingly.\n\n   Code:"
