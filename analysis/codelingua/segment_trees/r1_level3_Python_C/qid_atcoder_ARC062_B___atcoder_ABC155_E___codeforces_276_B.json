Implementation details:\n\n   Step1: File1 logic. We have a string s (from stdin). We traverse each character:\n\n          num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0. For each char in s:\n            if char == 'g':\n               if num_g - num_p > 0:\n                  score += 1\n                  num_p += 1\n               else:\n                  num_g += 1\n            else (char == 'p'):\n               if num_g - num_p > 0:\n                  num_p += 1\n               else:\n                  score -= 1\n                  num_g += 1\n\n        Then we have score1 = score. Step2: Convert score1 to a string. We need to convert the integer score1 to a string. We'll use a buffer and sprintf. Then we run the logic from File2's main() on this string. The File2 main():\n\n          s = input()   -> we have the string representation of score1. Then they do: s = '0' + s   -> so we will prepend a '0' to the string. Then iterate in reverse:\n\n            pmin = 1000, mmin = 0   (initially)\n\n            for each character c in the reversed string (including the prepended '0'):\n\n               v = c - '0'   (convert char to int)\n\n               npmin = min(pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v)\n               nmmin = min(pmin + v+1, mmin + v)\n\n               pmin = npmin\n               mmin = nmmin\n\n            Then the result is min(pmin, mmin) -> score2. Note: We must be cautious because the string after prepending might be up to 20 characters? (if the number is big) but the problem doesn't specify. Step3: Convert score2 to a string. Then we run File3 logic:\n\n          s = the string representation of score2. We create a frequency map (for each character in the string). Then we check: \n            cnt = 0\n            for each frequency in the map:\n               if frequency % 2 != 0: if cnt < 1: cnt++ \n                  else: set a flag x = false and break.",

The numbers in the DP: pmin and mmin are updated and remain bounded? because we are adding at most 10 each step? so worst-case 8*10 = 80? and we start at 1000? so we are safe. Actually, the DP values start at 1000 and then we do:\n\n        npmin = min( pmin + (10 - (v+1)) , mmin + (10 - v) ) so the maximum we can add per step is 10? and we do 8 steps -> so maximum 1000 + 80 = 1080.

This is the same. Also note: the original File3 does:\n\n        for key, value in dt.items(): if value % 2 != 0 and cnt < 1:\n                cnt += 1\n            elif value % 2 != 0 and cnt >= 1:\n                x = False\n                break\n\n        So we break at the second odd frequency -> same. But note: the frequency map in the original is for every character? and we are only counting digits? and the string s3 is digits? so it's the same. However, the original File3 does not know that the string is digits? it would count any character. But in our case, the string is the decimal representation of a nonnegative integer -> only digits. So it's the same. But note: the original File3 also counts the entire string? and we are doing the same.",

So the score1 is about -ceil(n/2). The absolute value is about n/2, which for n=1000000 is 500000 -> fits in an int (which is at least 2e9). So we are safe. Code:\n\n      ... as above ...

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to translate the entire sequence of Python programs into a single C program.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The first program (File1) reads a string and processes it to compute a score. We will capture the output (an integer) and pass it to the next program? \n    However, note: the second program (File2) reads a string again. But the first program's output is an integer, and the second program expects a string.\n\n Let's reexamine the chain:\n\n File1: reads a string s, processes it, and prints an integer (score).\n\n File2: reads a string (from stdin) and then does some processing (in main_b or main). But note: the main function in File2 is called and it returns a value that is printed. However, the input to File2 is a string (which in the chain would be the original input? But wait, the chain is: the output of File1 becomes the input to File2? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So:\n\n   Input to File1: string (from stdin)\n   Output of File1: integer (score) -> printed to stdout.\n\n   Then File2 would read from stdin, but that stdin is now the output of File1? That would be an integer. But File2 expects a string (digits). \n\n However, looking at the provided programs, we see:\n\n   File1: reads a string and prints an integer.\n\n   File2: reads a string (which is intended to be a number? because it does `int(c)`). But if we chain, then the input to File2 would be the integer from File1 (as a string).\n\n   Then File3: reads a string and processes it.\n\n But wait, the chain is:\n\n   Input (original) -> File1 -> (output: integer) -> File2 (which now takes that integer as a string) -> (output: integer from main) -> File3 (which takes that integer as a string? but then does `list(input())` and then checks for frequency of digits?).\n\n However, the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\" when run on the same input. And the same input is the original string.\n\n But the chain of programs:\n\n   Program1: reads the original string, outputs an integer.\n\n   Program2: reads that integer (as a string) and outputs an integer.\n\n   Program3: reads that integer (as a string) and outputs either \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n However, the example programs in File2 have two main functions (main_b and main). The code actually calls `main()` and prints its return value. So the output of File2 is the return value of `main()`.\n\n But note: the original input to the entire chain is a string (for File1). Then the output of File1 is an integer, which becomes the input to File2 (as a string of digits). Then the output of File2 is an integer, which becomes the input to File3 (as a string of digits).\n\n However, looking at the code in File2, the `main()` function expects a string of digits? because it does `s = '0' + s` and then iterates over each character converting to int.\n\n But the problem states: the entire sequence. So we have:\n\n   Step1: Read the initial string (call it s1) -> compute an integer score1.\n\n   Step2: Convert score1 to a string (call it s2) and use as input to File2's main() -> compute an integer score2.\n\n   Step3: Convert score2 to a string (call it s3) and use as input to File3 -> compute a string output.\n\n However, note that File3 expects a string and then does:\n   s = list(input())\n   ... and then counts frequency of each character.\n\n But the output of File2 is an integer, so when converted to a string, it's a sequence of digits. Then File3 counts the frequency of each digit.\n\n But the problem says: \"the same behavior as the original chain when run on the same input\".\n\n However, the original chain is three separate programs. We are to combine them into one C program that does the same overall computation.\n\n So we break down:\n\n   Step1: Read a string (from stdin) and compute an integer (score1) as in File1.\n\n   Step2: Convert the integer score1 to a string (without printing it to the console and reading back, we just use it as a string in memory) and then run the logic of File2's main() on that string to compute an integer (score2).\n\n   Step3: Convert the integer score2 to a string and then run the logic of File3 on that string to produce the final output (either \"First\" or \"Second\").\n\n Therefore, the C program:\n\n   - Reads a string (the initial input).\n   - Processes it as in File1 to get score1.\n   - Converts score1 to a string (in a buffer) and then processes that string as in File2 (using the main() function from File2) to get score2.\n   - Converts score2 to a string and then processes that string as in File3 to decide whether to print \"First\" or \"Second\".\n\n Important: We must not do any I/O in between, only at the beginning (reading the initial string) and at the end (printing the final result).\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   Step1: File1 logic.\n\n        We have a string s (from stdin). We traverse each character:\n\n          num_g = 0, num_p = 0, score = 0.\n\n          For each char in s:\n            if char == 'g':\n               if num_g - num_p > 0:\n                  score += 1\n                  num_p += 1\n               else:\n                  num_g += 1\n            else (char == 'p'):\n               if num_g - num_p > 0:\n                  num_p += 1\n               else:\n                  score -= 1\n                  num_g += 1\n\n        Then we have score1 = score.\n\n   Step2: Convert score1 to a string.\n\n        We need to convert the integer score1 to a string. We'll use a buffer and sprintf.\n\n        Then we run the logic from File2's main() on this string.\n\n        The File2 main():\n\n          s = input()   -> we have the string representation of score1.\n\n          Then they do: s = '0' + s   -> so we will prepend a '0' to the string.\n\n          Then iterate in reverse:\n\n            pmin = 1000, mmin = 0   (initially)\n\n            for each character c in the reversed string (including the prepended '0'):\n\n               v = c - '0'   (convert char to int)\n\n               npmin = min(pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v)\n               nmmin = min(pmin + v+1, mmin + v)\n\n               pmin = npmin\n               mmin = nmmin\n\n            Then the result is min(pmin, mmin) -> score2.\n\n        Note: We must be cautious because the string after prepending might be up to 20 characters? (if the number is big) but the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Step3: Convert score2 to a string.\n\n        Then we run File3 logic:\n\n          s = the string representation of score2.\n\n          We create a frequency map (for each character in the string).\n\n          Then we check: \n            cnt = 0\n            for each frequency in the map:\n               if frequency % 2 != 0:\n                  if cnt < 1: cnt++ \n                  else: set a flag x = false and break.\n\n          Then:\n            if x is true: print \"First\"\n            else if x is false and the length of the string (which is the string of score2) is even: print \"Second\"\n            else (x false and length odd): print \"First\"\n\n However, note: the original File3 expects the entire input from stdin, which in the chain is the output of File2 (which is an integer). So the string we are processing in step3 is the string representation of score2.\n\n But note: the length of the string for File3 is the number of digits in score2.\n\n Implementation in C:\n\n   We'll do:\n\n     char s1[1000000];  // initial string, assuming large enough\n     fgets(s1, sizeof(s1), stdin);   // but note: the Python input() reads without newline? so we may have to remove the newline.\n\n     Step1: process s1 to get score1.\n\n     Step2: \n        char s2[20];   // enough for an integer (which is at most 10^6? but the score1 is bounded by the length? actually, worst-case: each char can add at most 1, so score1 is at most len(s1) and at worst negative? but we use absolute? let's say we use a buffer of 20 digits.\n\n        sprintf(s2, \"%d\", score1);\n\n        Then we create a new string: s2_prepended = \"0\" + s2 -> we can create a new buffer: \n          char s2_full[21]; // 20+1 for the '0' and then the original digits, and then null.\n          s2_full[0] = '0';\n          strcpy(s2_full+1, s2);\n\n        Then we reverse s2_full? Actually, the code in File2: `for c in s[:: - 1]` -> they reverse the entire string. But note: the string is \"0\" + the original string. Then they reverse that. So we can traverse from the last character to the first.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reverse the string and then process from start to end? But the algorithm in File2 does:\n\n          for c in s[::-1]:   # so from last character to first.\n\n        We can do: traverse from the last character (including the null terminator? no, the string is from index0 to len-1) to the first.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          int len2 = strlen(s2_full);\n          int pmin = 1000, mmin = 0;\n          for (int i = len2-1; i>=0; i--) {\n             int v = s2_full[i] - '0';\n             // then update\n             int npmin = min(pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v);\n             int nmmin = min(pmin + v+1, mmin + v);\n             pmin = npmin;\n             mmin = nmmin;\n          }\n          int score2 = min(pmin, mmin);\n\n        But note: the original code in File2 does:\n\n          s = '0' + s   -> then reverses the entire string? and then iterates from the first character of the reversed string to the last.\n\n          Actually, the for loop: `for c in s[::-1]` is the same as iterating from the last char of the original (with the prepended '0') to the first.\n\n          So if our string s2_full is \"0123\", then reversing gives \"3210\", and then they iterate over each char: first '3', then '2', then '1', then '0'.\n\n          In our C loop: we are going from the last char of s2_full (which is the last digit) to the first (the prepended '0'). So that is the same.\n\n        However, note: the original algorithm in File2 (main) does:\n\n          s = '0' + s   -> then for c in s[::-1] -> so the string becomes \"0\" + original, then reversed.\n\n          Our s2_full is \"0\" + s2 (the string representation of score1). Then we traverse from the last character (which is the least significant digit of the original number) to the first (which is the new prepended '0').\n\n        This matches.\n\n     Step3: Convert score2 to a string.\n\n        char s3[20];\n        sprintf(s3, \"%d\", score2);\n\n        Then we need to count frequency of each digit in s3.\n\n        We'll create an array for digits (0-9) and also note: the string might have a minus sign? \n\n        But wait: the output of step1 (score1) can be negative? \n\n          Step1: \n            starts at 0.\n            for each char: \n              'g': if we can pair (num_g>num_p) then we add 1 -> so positive.\n              'p': if we cannot pair (num_g==num_p) then we subtract 1 -> so it can become negative.\n\n          Then step2: we convert the negative integer to a string? which will have a minus sign.\n\n        However, the step2 algorithm (File2) expects a string of digits? because it does `int(c)`. But if the string has a minus sign, then that will cause a problem.\n\n        How did the original Python handle this? \n\n          In File1: the input string is only composed of 'g' and 'p'. The output is an integer that can be negative.\n\n          Then in File2: the input is the string representation of that integer. In Python, `input()` would read the integer as a string, including the minus sign.\n\n          Then in File2: they do `s = '0' + s`. So if s was \"-123\", then we get \"0-123\". Then when they iterate and do `int(c)` for each character, the '-' will cause an error? \n\n        Actually, the original File2 is designed for nonnegative numbers? because the problem context is about a number (and the example in main_b is about a positive integer). \n\n        But note: the input to File2 in the chain is the output of File1, which can be negative. So we have a problem.\n\n        However, looking at the original File1: the score can be negative? \n\n          Example: \n            input: \"pp\" \n            first char 'p': \n               num_g=0, num_p=0 -> num_g-num_p=0 -> so we do: score=-1, num_g=1, num_p=0.\n            second char 'p':\n               now num_g=1, num_p=0 -> num_g-num_p=1>0 -> so we do: num_p becomes 1, score remains -1.\n\n          Then we output -1.\n\n        Then File2: \n          input: string \"-1\"\n\n          Then they do: s = '0' + s -> \"0-1\"\n\n          Then they reverse: becomes \"1-0\"\n\n          Then they iterate:\n\n            i=0: c='1' -> int('1')=1 -> then update: \n               npmin = min(1000 + 10 - (1+1) = 1000+8 = 1008, 0+10-1=9) -> 9\n               nmmin = min(1000+1+1=1002, 0+1=1) -> 1\n               then pmin=9, mmin=1.\n\n            i=1: c='-' -> int('-') -> this will crash? \n\n        So the original chain would crash on negative numbers.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider: the output of File1 is an integer that can be negative, but the File2 algorithm does not handle negative numbers.\n\n        However, note the problem: \"the entire sequence\" and \"behaves identically\". The original sequence would crash on negative numbers? \n\n        But wait: the original File2 uses `int(c)` on each character. The string \"-1\" has two characters: '-' and '1'. So when it tries to convert '-' to an integer, it would throw an exception? \n\n        Actually, the original File2 would crash. So we must assume that the input to File2 is a nonnegative integer? \n\n        How can we fix? \n\n        Looking at the problem: the chain is defined by the outputs and inputs. The output of File1 is an integer that can be negative. The input to File2 is that integer as a string. Then File2 expects a string of digits (without sign). \n\n        But the original File2 does not handle negative. \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the original chain crashes on negative, then we should crash? But the problem says \"run on the same input\", and the input to the entire chain is a string of 'g' and 'p'. We are to produce the same behavior.\n\n        But the problem does not specify that the intermediate outputs are nonnegative. \n\n        Let me check the original File1: can it output a negative? \n\n          Yes: as above with \"pp\".\n\n        Then the chain would break. \n\n        Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". So we must do exactly as the chain does. \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So if the original chain would crash, we should crash? But the problem does not say we have to handle errors. \n\n        But the original chain in File2 would crash on negative? \n\n          In Python: `int('-')` -> ValueError.\n\n        Therefore, for negative numbers, the chain breaks. \n\n        But the problem says: \"the same behavior\". So we must also break? \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\". So the input to File2 is a string that is the string representation of the integer. \n\n        How about we mimic the crash? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the problem might not test negative numbers? \n\n        But the problem says: \"same input\". We must be able to handle the same inputs. \n\n        Since the original chain would crash on negative, we can also crash? \n\n        How? We can check: if the string representation of score1 contains a non-digit (like '-'), then we can break? \n\n        But the problem says: without I/O in the middle. And we are to write a single C program.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify that the intermediate steps must not crash. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"behaves identically\". So if the original chain crashes, we crash. If it doesn't, we don't.\n\n        But in C, we are going to convert the integer to a string with sprintf: if the integer is negative, we get a minus sign.\n\n        Then in step2, when we do `v = s2_full[i] - '0'` for a character that is '-', we get a negative number? or a large number? \n\n        Actually, the ASCII value of '-' is 45, and '0' is 48, so 45-48 = -3.\n\n        Then we use that in the computation: \n\n          npmin = min(pmin + 10 - (v+1), mmin + 10 - v)\n\n        This would be using negative v? and then we get a negative value? \n\n        Then the algorithm would proceed? but it would be different from the Python that crashes.\n\n        So we must mimic the crash? \n\n        How? We can check each character: if it is not a digit, then we can break? But the original Python would throw an exception and exit. \n\n        In C, we can do:\n\n          for each character in the string (for step2), we check if it is between '0' and '9'? but note the prepended '0' and the string of the integer. But if the integer is negative, then the string has a minus. So we can check:\n\n          for (int i=0; i<len2; i++) {\n             if (s2_full[i]!='0' && (s2_full[i] < '0' || s2_full[i]>'9')) {\n                 // then we have an invalid character -> we should crash? \n                 // but how? we can print an error and exit? \n                 // but the original chain crashes, so we do:\n                 fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character\");\n                 exit(1);\n             }\n          }\n\n        But wait: the original Python does not check? it just does `int(c)` and that throws. \n\n        However, the problem says: without I/O in the middle. But stderr is I/O? \n\n        Alternatively, we can cause a segmentation fault? that would be bad.\n\n        But the problem says: \"behaves identically\". We are allowed to crash? \n\n        However, the problem expects a C program that runs and produces the same output. For inputs that cause a crash in the chain, we crash. For others, we output the same.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify that the chain must not crash. \n\n        How about we avoid the crash by making the input to File2 nonnegative? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not say that the intermediate outputs are nonnegative. \n\n        But looking at the problem context? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the score1 in File1 might be negative? but the algorithm in File2 is designed for nonnegative? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and we are to mimic the chain, we must allow negative and then crash? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the same behavior\". So if the original chain crashes, we crash. \n\n        But the problem expects a single C program that does the entire chain. And if we crash, we don't produce the final output? \n\n        So for the sake of the problem, we assume the input to the entire chain (the string of 'g' and 'p') is such that the chain does not crash? \n\n        Or we must handle the crash? \n\n        Given the ambiguity, and since the problem states: \"the output of each program is used as the input to the next\", and the first program outputs an integer that can be negative, and the second program expects a nonnegative string? we might have to fix the chain? \n\n        But the problem says: \"reproduces the same behavior\". So we do exactly as the chain.\n\n        How about we do: in step2, if we encounter a non-digit, we break and do not compute? and then step3 would not run? \n\n        But the problem says: only the last block produces output. So if the chain crashes in step2, we don't run step3 and we don't produce the final output? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"the entire sequence\". \n\n        We decide: we will mimic the crash by exiting the program with an error when we find a non-digit in the string for step2. \n\n        But note: the original File2 might not crash? because the input string in the chain is the output of File1, which is an integer. In Python, the integer is converted to a string without any non-digit? except for the minus sign.\n\n        Actually, the only non-digit we can get is the minus sign.\n\n        So we can check: if the first character of the string (before prepending) is '-', then we know the number is negative. Then we can crash? \n\n        But after prepending, the string is \"0\" + ... so the minus sign is in the middle? \n\n          Example: score1 = -1 -> string s2 = \"-1\", then we prepend: \"0-1\".\n\n        Then when we traverse, the first character we process is the last character of \"0-1\", which is '1', then the next is '-' -> then we get an invalid character.\n\n        So we can check in the step2 loop: if the character is not between '0' and '9', then we crash.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          for each character in the string (in the reverse order) in step2:\n             if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n                 // crash: print to stderr and exit? \n                 fprintf(stderr, \"invalid character in input for File2: %c\\n\", c);\n                 exit(1);\n             }\n\n        This is acceptable? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might not test negative numbers. \n\n        But to be safe, we'll do the check.\n\n     Step3: similarly, we convert score2 to a string. But note: the step2 algorithm (if it runs) produces a nonnegative integer? \n\n        The step2 algorithm: \n          pmin and mmin are nonnegative? \n          Initially: pmin=1000, mmin=0.\n          Then each update: \n             npmin = min( ... ) -> the expressions: 10 - (v+1) is at least 0? v is between 0 and 9, so 10 - (v+1) is between 0 and 9? similarly 10-v is between 1 and 10? \n             and pmin + v+1 and mmin+v are nonnegative.\n\n          So the result is nonnegative.\n\n        Therefore, the string for step3 will not have a minus sign.\n\n        Then we do:\n\n          We have a string s3 (digits only).\n\n          We create a frequency array for the 10 digits? but wait: the string can have any digit from '0' to '9'. \n\n          However, the string might have a digit that is not in 0-9? no, because it's the string representation of a nonnegative integer.\n\n          Then we count the frequency of each character? but note: the string might be long? but the integer score2 is the result of step2, which is computed from a string that was the representation of score1 (which is at most the length of the initial string) and step2 is a dynamic programming that runs in O(n). The length of the string for step2 is at most 20? because an integer in the range of ...? \n\n          Actually, the initial string can be up to 1000000? but the score1 is bounded by the number of 'g' and 'p'? worst-case absolute value is about n. So the string representation of score1 has at most 7 digits? Then step2 produces an integer that is the minimal number of coins? which is at most ...? \n\n          But we don't care about the magnitude for step3: we just need to count frequency.\n\n          We'll use an array for 256? or just for the digits? \n\n          Since the string is composed of digits, we can use:\n\n             int freq[10] = {0};\n\n          Then for each char in s3:\n             if (c < '0' || c > '9') -> but we know it's a digit? so skip check?\n             else: freq[c-'0']++;\n\n          But note: the string is the decimal representation, so each char is a digit.\n\n          Then we count:\n\n             int cnt = 0;\n             int x = 1;   // true\n             for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n                 if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                     if (cnt < 1) {\n                         cnt++;\n                     } else {\n                         x = 0; // false\n                         break;\n                     }\n                 }\n             }\n\n          Then:\n\n             if (x) {\n                 printf(\"First\\n\");\n             } else {\n                 int len_s3 = strlen(s3);\n                 if (len_s3 % 2 == 0) {\n                     printf(\"Second\\n\");\n                 } else {\n                     printf(\"First\\n\");\n                 }\n             }\n\n     But note: the original File3 does:\n\n          x = True\n          for ...:\n             if value % 2 != 0 and cnt<1: cnt++ \n             else if value %2 !=0 and cnt>=1: x=False and break.\n\n          Then if x: First\n          else if not x and len(s) even: Second\n          else if not x and len(s) odd: First\n\n     So we match.\n\n Summary:\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Read the initial string (remove newline if any).\n\n     Step1: simulate File1 to get score1.\n\n     Step2: \n        Convert score1 to a string (s2).\n        Prepend '0' to s2 to form s2_full.\n        Then traverse s2_full from last char to first:\n            if we find a non-digit, print error to stderr and exit(1).\n            else: compute the two DP variables.\n        Then set score2 = min(pmin, mmin).\n\n     Step3: \n        Convert score2 to a string (s3).\n        Count frequency of each digit in s3.\n        Check: how many digits have odd frequency? \n          if at most one -> then x=1, else x=0.\n        Then:\n          if x==1: print \"First\"\n          else: \n             if the length of s3 is even: print \"Second\"\n             else: print \"First\"\n\n   However, note: the original File3 uses the entire string (including all characters) and the frequency per character. We are doing per digit? and the string s3 is composed of digits? so it's the same.\n\n   Edge: if the string for step3 is empty? but score2 is nonnegative, so if it's 0 then the string is \"0\", which is not empty.\n\n   Also note: the length of the string for step3 is the number of digits.\n\n   But note: the original File3 also considers the entire string? and the length is the number of characters.\n\n   We are using the entire string (the digits) so it's the same.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll write the C program accordingly.\n\n   Note: We assume the initial string is provided on stdin and is one line (without newline? but we'll remove the newline).\n\n   Steps:\n\n      #include <stdio.h>\n      #include <stdlib.h>\n      #include <string.h>\n      #include <limits.h>\n\n      // helper: min function\n      int min(int a, int b) { return a < b ?

or break?\n                  // But the original step3 would have taken the string of the integer which is nonnegative? so we skip non-digit? but there shouldn't be any.\n                  // Just skip?\n                  continue;\n              }\n              int digit = c - '0';\n              freq[digit]++;\n          }\n\n          int cnt_odd = 0;\n          int valid = 1; // x in the original: true until we find more than one odd frequency.\n          for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {\n              if (freq[i] % 2 != 0) {\n                  if (cnt_odd < 1) {\n                      cnt_odd++;\n                  } else {\n                      valid = 0;\n                      break;\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n\n          // Now output:\n          if (valid) {\n              printf(\"First\\n\");\n          } else {\n              if (len3 % 2 == 0) {\n                  printf(\"Second\\n\");\n              } else {\n                  printf(\"First\\n\");\n              }\n          }\n\n          return 0;\n      }\n\n   However, note: the step3 in the original does not break the frequency loop until the end? but we break at the second odd frequency. This is the same.\n\n   Also note: the original File3 does:\n\n        for key, value in dt.items():\n            if value % 2 != 0 and cnt < 1:\n                cnt += 1\n            elif value % 2 != 0 and cnt >= 1:\n                x = False\n                break\n\n        So we break at the second odd frequency -> same.\n\n   But note: the frequency map in the original is for every character? and we are only counting digits? and the string s3 is digits? so it's the same.\n\n   However, the original File3 does not know that the string is digits? it would count any character. But in our case, the string is the decimal representation of a nonnegative integer -> only digits. So it's the same.\n\n   But note: the original File3 also counts the entire string? and we are doing the same.\n\n   We assume the input to the entire chain is such that the chain does not crash? but we have the crash for negative in step2? \n\n   We'll write the program as above.\n\n   Note: the initial string might be very long? we assume up to 1000000 characters.\n\n   We'll test with small inputs.\n\n   However, note: the step2 algorithm: the initial pmin is 1000. This is a constant. But what if the string is long? the number of digits is about 6 or 7? so the loop runs 7 times? so it's safe.\n\n   But if the absolute value of score1 is large? for example, 10^6 -> 7 digits. Then the prepended string is 8 digits. Then the loop runs 8 times. The numbers in the DP: pmin and mmin are updated and remain bounded? because we are adding at most 10 each step? so worst-case 8*10 = 80? and we start at 1000? so we are safe.\n\n   Actually, the DP values start at 1000 and then we do:\n\n        npmin = min( pmin + (10 - (v+1)) , mmin + (10 - v) )\n\n        so the maximum we can add per step is 10? and we do 8 steps -> so maximum 1000 + 80 = 1080.\n\n   But 1080 is within int.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Important: The problem says: without I/O in the middle. We only read at the beginning and write at the end? \n\n   But note: in step2, if we crash we write to stderr? and then exit. The problem does not specify that we cannot write to stderr? and the original chain would print an exception to stderr? \n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the stderr and just exit? but the problem says \"behaves identically\". The original chain would print an exception? \n\n   How about we just exit(1) without printing? \n\n   But the problem says \"behaves identically\", so we should print an error message? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact error message? and we are to focus on the output? \n\n   Since the problem states: \"only the last block should handle producing output\", and if there is an error we are not at the last block? so we should not produce any output to stdout? but stderr is for errors? \n\n   The problem does not say anything about stderr? \n\n   We'll do: if we get a non-digit in step2, we print an error to stderr and exit(1). This matches the Python chain that would throw an exception (which prints to stderr).\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the check and let the conversion to int fail? but in C, we are subtracting '0', so we get a negative v? then we compute with negative v? and then we get negative pmin/mmin? and then we convert score2 to a string? and then step3 would run? but the result would be wrong? \n\n   So we must check.\n\n   Code below.\n\n   Note: We must be cautious: the step2 algorithm in File2 has two functions? but the one we are using is main(), not main_b(). \n\n   The original File2 calls main() and prints its return value? and we are using the main() algorithm.\n\n   We are not using main_b()? so we skip that.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   We'll include the necessary headers.\n\n   Note: We assume the input number in step1 is within the range of int.\n\n   The initial string length is at most 1000000, and the score1 is bounded by the number of characters? worst-case: if all are 'g', then score1 = 0? because initially: \n        num_g=0, num_p=0.\n        first char: 'g' -> num_g becomes 1 -> score1=0? \n        then next: 'g' -> now num_g=1, num_p=0 -> num_g-num_p=1>0 -> so we add 1 and num_p becomes 1 -> score1=1.\n        then next: 'g' -> num_g=2, num_p=1 -> num_g-num_p=1>0 -> add 1 -> score1=2, num_p=2.\n\n        so for n 'g's: we get floor(n/2)? \n\n        for 'p': \n          first: 'p' -> we do: score1=-1, num_g=1, num_p=0.\n          next: 'p' -> now num_g=1, num_p=0 -> num_g-num_p=1>0 -> so we do: num_p=1 -> score1 remains -1.\n          next: 'p' -> now num_g=1, num_p=1 -> then num_g-num_p=0 -> so we do: score1 = -1-1 = -2, num_g=2, num_p=1? \n\n        Actually, the algorithm for 'p':\n\n          if (num_g - num_p > 0): then we just do num_p++ -> so no change in score.\n          else: we do score1 -= 1 and num_g++.\n\n        So the worst-case negative: if we have a sequence of n 'p' at the beginning: \n\n          first: 'p' -> score1=-1, num_g=1, num_p=0.\n          second: 'p' -> now num_g=1, num_p=0 -> condition: num_g-num_p=1>0 -> so we do: num_p++ -> so num_p=1 -> score1=-1.\n          third: 'p' -> now num_g=1, num_p=1 -> condition: 0 -> so we do: score1 = -2, num_g=2, num_p=1.\n          fourth: 'p' -> now num_g=2, num_p=1 -> condition: 1>0 -> so we do: num_p=2 -> score1=-2.\n          fifth: 'p' -> now num_g=2, num_p=2 -> condition: 0 -> so we do: score1=-3, num_g=3, num_p=2.\n\n        So the score1 is about -ceil(n/2). \n\n        The absolute value is about n/2, which for n=1000000 is 500000 -> fits in an int (which is at least 2e9).\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Code:\n\n      ... as above ...\n\n   We'll write the entire C program.\n\n   Note: We removed the newline from the initial string? because the Python input() does not include the newline? \n\n   But fgets includes the newline? so we remove it.\n\n   Now, we write the code."
