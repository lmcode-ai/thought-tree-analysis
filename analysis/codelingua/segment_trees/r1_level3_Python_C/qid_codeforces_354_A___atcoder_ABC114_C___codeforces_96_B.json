But the condition (number>0 and four==seven)? so 0 is not included? because number>0? So we are safe. However, the gen function in the original Python program starts with gen(0,0,0)? and then it does:\n\n        if (number > 0 and four==seven): append\n\n        and then recursively calls gen(number*10+4, four+1, seven) and gen(number*10+7, four, seven+1) So we do the same. But note: the initial call with (0,0,0) leads to:\n\n        number=0 -> skip (because number>0 fails) -> then call gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1). So we are building from 0? but we don't add 0? and then we build 4 and 7?",

So we build the same set? regardless of N? as long as N>= the maximum number we build? which is 7777777777? which is less than 10^10? So we build the same set? and then we count only those that are <=N? but if N is huge? we still build the same set? because we stop at 11 digits? So we build about 3^10 numbers? which is 59049? So it's efficient. But if N is small? then we stop early? so it's efficient. We are ready to write the code. One last note: the step1 function: the initial answer is set to:\n\n        answer = QR * (n - 1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\n   This corresponds to taking all from the right? Then we iterate i from 1 to n? which corresponds to taking i from the left and n-i from the right? and then we adjust with the cost of switching sides? if we have more on one side? we add the extra cost for the consecutive same side. We do the same. Now, the code:",

But we'll do the same as the Python: gen(0,0,0) but then we store in a global array? We'll use a static array? Because we know the maximum size (say 1000). Then:\n\n          long long res1 = step1();\n          long long res2 = step2(res1);\n          long long res3 = step3(res2); printf(\"%lld\\n\", res3);\n\n   However, note: the second program's function in the original Python code starts with '0'? and then builds? So we have to do the same? We'll write the step2 function as:\n\n        long long step2(long long N) {\n            return aaa(0, N, 0);\n        }\n\n        long long aaa(long long current, long long N, int mask) {\n            if (current > N) {\n                return 0;\n            }\n            long long count = 0;\n            if (current > 0) {\n                if (mask == 7) { // 7 in binary is 111, meaning we have 3,5,7\n                    count = 1;\n                } else {\n                    count = 0;\n                }\n            } else {\n                count = 0;\n            }\n            // Append 3,5,7\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 3, N, mask | 1);\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 5, N, mask | 2);\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 7, N, mask | 4);\n            return count;\n        }\n\n   But note: the Python code does:\n\n        ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'} else 0\n\n   However, the condition set(...)=={'7','5','3'} requires that the number has only the digits 7,5,3 and all of them? Our mask condition (mask==7) ensures that we have at least one of each? and since we build only with 3,5,7? then the digits are only 3,5,7? So it's equivalent. However, what about numbers with leading zeros? We avoid because we start building from 0 and then we only build 3,5,7? and then we never have a digit 0 again? because we are building with 3,5,7? So the mask condition is safe. But note: the initial call: current=0? then we build 3,5,7? which are positive? and then we build from 3: 33,35,37? etc. Then we never get a number with a leading zero? because we start from 0 only once? and then we build without 0? So it's safe.",

The problem doesn't specify constraints? but the first program says n? and we read n? and then we do a loop for i in [1, n]? so O(n)? which is acceptable for n=100000? But note: the first program also does:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1): ... which is O(n)? and we do that? so we are O(n)? which is acceptable for 100000. So the entire program should work. Let's write the code accordingly. Note: we must be cautious for the step1: the condition for adding QL or QR? The Python code:\n\n        if i > (n - i):\n            energy = energy + (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL\n        elif (n - i) > i:\n            energy = energy + ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR We do the same. But note: the condition: i and n-i? and then we subtract 1? So if i=5, n-i=3, then we add (5-3-1)=1 * QL. We'll code accordingly. We'll write the entire C program as described.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to combine the three Python programs into one C program.\n Steps:\n 1. The first program reads n, L, R, QL, QR and a list W of n integers.\n    Then it computes an answer by iterating over possible splits and prints the answer.\n\n 2. The second program reads an integer N and then uses a recursive function 'aaa'\n    to count numbers formed only by digits 7,5,3 (and containing all of them) that are <= N.\n    It starts with '0' and builds numbers by appending 7,5,3.\n\n 3. The third program generates all numbers (up to 10^10) that have equal number of 4 and 7 digits,\n    then reads an integer n and prints the smallest generated number >= n.\n\n However, note that the original chain is meant to be executed in sequence, with the output of each program becoming the input of the next.\n\n But in the given code, each program reads its own input. Since we are to chain without intermediate I/O, we must:\n\n - Only the first program reads from stdin (the initial input).\n - The output of the first program becomes the input of the second.\n - The output of the second becomes the input of the third.\n\n But note: the second program expects a single integer (N) and the third also expects a single integer (n).\n\n However, the first program prints a single integer (answer). So the second program will read that integer.\n\n Similarly, the second program prints a single integer (the count) and the third program will read that integer.\n\n But wait: the third program is generating numbers and then reading an integer? Actually, the third program's input is the integer we read.\n\n However, the chain is:\n\n   Input for first: two lines: first line has 5 integers, second line has n integers.\n   Output of first: one integer -> becomes input for second (which is a single integer).\n   Output of second: one integer -> becomes input for third.\n\n But the third program is written to read an integer and then find the next lucky number (with equal 4s and 7s) that is >= that integer.\n\n So the entire chain:\n\n   Step1: Read first input (two lines), compute answer1 (an integer) and that is the output.\n\n   Step2: Take the output of step1 (call it N1) and use it as the input for the second program: which counts the numbers <= N1 that are composed of 3,5,7 and have all three. Then it outputs the count (an integer).\n\n   Step3: Take the output of step2 (call it N2) and use it as the input for the third program: which then finds the smallest number in its generated list (of numbers with equal 4s and 7s) that is >= N2.\n\n   Then the final output is the result of step3.\n\n However, note that the third program also has a main that generates a list? We must do the generation only once per run? But the chain runs the entire sequence once.\n\n But we are writing one C program. We must structure:\n\n   Read the initial input (for the first program) from stdin.\n\n   Then compute the result of the first program (without printing to stdout, but store it for the next step).\n\n   Then use that result as the input for the second program (without reading from stdin again).\n\n   Then compute the result of the second program.\n\n   Then use that result as the input for the third program.\n\n   Then compute the result of the third program and print it to stdout.\n\n However, note the third program has a global list and a recursive generator? We must generate that list only once? But note: the list is generated independently of the input? Actually, the list is generated for numbers up to 10^10 and then sorted. Then we use the input to find the next number.\n\n But we cannot generate the list multiple times? We are going to run the chain only once? So we can generate the list once at the beginning? Or when the third program is called? However, the third program is called with a specific input (which is the output of the second program). But the list is fixed.\n\n How to structure the C program?\n\n   We'll break the three steps into functions.\n\n   Step1: We read the initial input: two lines. Then compute the answer as in the first Python program.\n\n   Step2: We use the result from step1 as the input for the second program's function.\n\n   Step3: We use the result from step2 as the input for the third program's function, but note that the third program generates a list? We must generate that list only once? However, the list is fixed and independent of input? So we can generate it once at the start of the program? But the third program is called only once? Actually, the entire chain runs once.\n\n   However, the third program's generation is heavy? But note: the numbers are generated up to 10^10 (which is 10 billion) but the condition of having equal 4s and 7s? The numbers have at most 10 digits? Actually, the recursive function stops at 10^10? But the numbers with equal 4s and 7s: the number of digits must be even? And the maximum number of digits is 10? So the total numbers are not too many? (like 2^10? Actually, we have 10 choose 5 for 10-digit numbers? which is 252? and for fewer digits we have similar). So we can precompute the list.\n\n   But note: the third program has a global list and a recursive function? We can generate the list once at the start of the entire program? Then the third program's main logic is just to do a lookup? But the third program in the chain is called with an input? So we can generate the list once and then use it for the third step.\n\n   However, the chain runs sequentially? We are going to do:\n\n      result1 = step1_original(input from stdin)\n      result2 = step2_original(result1)\n      result3 = step3_original(result2)\n\n   But step3_original in the third program does:\n        gen(0,0,0)   -> generates the list\n        sort the list\n        then read n (which is result2) and find the first number in the list >= n.\n\n   So we must generate the list for the third step? But note: if we run the entire chain multiple times? No, the entire program runs once.\n\n   However, we are writing a single C program that runs once? So we can generate the list once at the beginning? But the third step requires the list? And the list is independent of the input? So we can generate it at the start of the program? Then when we get to the third step, we can use that precomputed list.\n\n   But note: the chain might be run multiple times? The problem says: \"the entire sequence\" meaning one run? So we can generate the list once at the beginning? However, the generation is recursive and might be heavy? But the numbers are limited? We'll generate the list at the start of the entire program? Then use it in step3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can generate the list the first time step3 is called? But in C, we can do static initialization? We'll generate the list in a global variable? Then the step3 function just uses the global sorted list.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Do not insert any additional print/read statements in the middle.\" and we are not allowed to do I/O in the middle.\n\n   We are going to:\n\n      Precompute the list for the third step at the beginning? But note: the third step uses a list that is generated independently? and then sorted? and then we do a linear search? But the list is small? (at most 10000? Actually, the numbers are generated for up to 10 digits, and the condition is equal 4s and 7s? The number of such numbers: for each even length L (from 2 to 10), we have C(L, L/2) * 2^(L) ? Actually, we choose positions for 4s (the rest are 7s) and then each position can be either 4 or 7? Actually, no: the number is fixed: we have exactly L/2 4s and L/2 7s? So the count is C(L, L/2) for each L? Then total is about 252 (for 10) + 70 (for 8) + 20 (for 6) + 6 (for 4) + 2 (for 2) = 350? So we can generate and store.\n\n   Plan:\n\n      Global for the third step: a sorted list of all numbers with equal 4s and 7s and <= 10^10? We'll generate it once.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Step 0: Precompute the list for the third step? But the problem says: the programs are executed in sequence? So the third step is only after the first two? But the list is independent? We can precompute it at the beginning? Or we can compute it when we need it? Since it's fixed, we can precompute at the start.\n\n        Step 1: Read the input for the first program (n, L, R, QL, QR and then the list W of n integers).\n\n        Step 2: Compute the answer for the first program (without printing, store in a variable).\n\n        Step 3: Use that answer as the input for the second program: call a function that counts the numbers (like the recursive function in the second program) for the number we got from step1.\n\n        Step 4: Use the result of step3 as the input for the third step: look up in the precomputed sorted list the smallest number that is >= the result from step3.\n\n        Step 5: Print the result of step4.\n\n   However, note: the third program in the original code also prints the answer? And that becomes the final output.\n\n   But we are to print only at the end? So the entire chain ends with the output of the third program.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n      Precomputation for the third step:\n\n          We'll write a recursive function in C to generate all numbers with the following:\n              void gen(long long number, int four, int seven, long long **list, int *index, int *size)\n          We'll use dynamic array? Or we can calculate the maximum size? (say 1000) and then allocate.\n\n          Then we sort the list? (using qsort).\n\n      Step1: Read the input.\n\n      Step2: Compute the first answer (as in the first Python program).\n\n      Step3: Use the first answer as the argument for the second program's function: we'll write a recursive function in C for the second step? But note: the second program uses recursion and might be deep? The numbers we are counting can be up to the first answer? which might be large? The first answer is the energy? which is a number that might be large? But the second program counts numbers that are <= N (which is the first answer) and are composed of digits 7,5,3 and contain all three.\n\n          However, the numbers are built from the digits 3,5,7? The maximum length? The first answer might be up to 10^10? So the numbers we build are up to 10 digits? Actually, the numbers we build are at most the first answer? but the first answer might be a large number? The recursion in the second program builds numbers by appending digits? and it stops when the number is greater than N? So the depth is at most the number of digits of the first answer? which is at most 11? So recursion is safe.\n\n      Step4: Then we use the result of step3 (an integer) to look up in the precomputed list? We can do a linear scan? Because the list is small (about 350 elements).\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n      Precompute the list for step3 (global) at the beginning.\n\n      Then:\n\n        long long step1() {\n            // Read the first line: n, L, R, QL, QR\n            // Then the next line: n integers for W\n            // Then compute as in the first Python program.\n            // Return the computed answer (which is an integer, but note: the first program uses integers? and the numbers might be large? We use long long? The problem doesn't specify, but the constraints? We'll use long long to be safe.\n        }\n\n        long long step2(long long N) {\n            // This is the recursive function aaa, but we start at '0' (as string) but note: the function aaa in Python starts at '0' and then appends. But the initial call is aaa('0').\n            // However, the function aaa('0') will build numbers that start with 0? Then we do int(n) which removes leading zeros? Actually, when we start at '0', then we have n='0', which is 0 -> then we add digits? But then we get numbers that are strings starting with 0? Then int(n) removes the leading zeros? So we get numbers without the leading zeros? But note: the set of digits for the number 0 is {'0'}? which is not {'7','5','3'}? So it won't count? Then we build numbers by appending? So the initial call with '0' will then build '07','05','03'? which become 7,5,3? and then build from there.\n\n            How to simulate in C?\n\n            We'll write a recursive function that takes a string? Or we can use a long long? But the numbers might be up to the first answer? which might be large? But the numbers we are building are only those composed of 3,5,7? and we stop when the number is greater than N? The depth is the number of digits? which is at most the number of digits in N? (say 20?).\n\n            However, the initial call is with a string? But we can use a long long? and then we can convert to string to check the set of digits? That might be inefficient? Alternatively, we can track the digits we have? But the condition is: the number must be <= N and the set of digits must be exactly {'3','5','7'}? and the number must contain all three? But note: the set of digits in the number? So we need to know which digits appear? We can track a mask? We don't care about the exact digits? We care about the presence of 3,5,7? So we can have a state for the digits we have encountered? We can use an integer bitmask? 1<<0 for 3, 1<<1 for 5, 1<<2 for 7? Then the condition is mask==7? (all bits set).\n\n            So we design:\n\n                long long count = 0;\n                We'll have a function: dfs(long long current, int mask, long long N)\n\n            But note: the initial call: current=0, mask=0? Then we append 3,5,7? But then we get 3,5,7? and then we can build 33,35,37, etc.\n\n            How to avoid leading zeros? The initial call is with 0? Then we append? Then we get 03, 05, 07? which are 3,5,7? So we can avoid the leading zero by starting with 3,5,7? But the Python code starts with '0'. Then when we append, we build numbers that start with 3,5,7? So we can start the recursion with current=0 and then we append? But when current==0, then we are building the first digit? Then we can skip the 0? Actually, the Python code: aaa('0') then in the loop for i in '753': aaa('0'+i) -> so we get '03','05','07'. Then when we convert to int, we get 3,5,7.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if current==0, then we don't count? and then we build new numbers by current*10 + digit? But then 0*10+3=3, which is not 03? So we can do without the string? We can do:\n\n                    if current==0, then we are at the start? and then we can build 3,5,7? and then from each of those, we build further.\n\n            Steps for step2:\n\n                We'll write a function: long long aaa(long long current, long long N, int mask)\n                If current > N: return 0\n                Then, if current>0, we check the mask: if mask==7 (i.e., 1<<0 | 1<<1 | 1<<2) then we count 1, else 0? But wait: the condition is set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'}? That means the number must be composed exclusively of the digits 3,5,7? and must contain all three? So we must check that the mask is 7 and also that the number does not contain any digit other than 3,5,7? But our mask is built only from the digits we have? and we are building only from 3,5,7? So the mask condition is sufficient? Because we are building only with 3,5,7? Then the set of digits is a subset of {'3','5','7'}? and we require mask==7? Then we have all three? and no others? So we can use mask.\n\n                Then we add for each digit in [3,5,7]:\n                    next = current * 10 + digit\n                    new_mask = mask | (digit==3?1: (digit==5?2:4))   [but note: 3->1<<0, 5->1<<1, 7->1<<2] so:\n                         digit 3: mask | 1\n                         digit 5: mask | 2\n                         digit 7: mask | 4\n\n                Then: count += aaa(next, N, new_mask)\n\n                Then return count.\n\n                However, the initial call: aaa(0, N, 0) -> then from 0 we build 3,5,7? and then from 3 we build 33,35,37? etc.\n\n            But note: the number 0 is built? Then we skip because current>0? and also mask=0? So we skip? Then we build 3,5,7? and then from there.\n\n            However, the Python code starts with '0' and then appends? and then converts to int? which removes the leading zero? So 0 becomes 0? then we build 3,5,7? which are positive? So we can do as above.\n\n        }\n\n        long long step3(long long n) {\n            // We have a precomputed global sorted list (of long long) and the size of the list.\n            // Then we traverse the list to find the first element >= n.\n            // Then return that element.\n        }\n\n   Then the main:\n\n        Precompute the list for step3 (call it global_list, and global_size) -> we write a recursive function to generate? We'll do non-recursive? or recursive? We'll write a recursive function that does DFS? But we'll do the same as the Python: gen(0,0,0) but then we store in a global array? We'll use a static array? Because we know the maximum size (say 1000).\n\n        Then:\n\n          long long res1 = step1();\n          long long res2 = step2(res1);\n          long long res3 = step3(res2);\n          printf(\"%lld\\n\", res3);\n\n   However, note: the second program's function in the original Python code starts with '0'? and then builds? So we have to do the same? We'll write the step2 function as:\n\n        long long step2(long long N) {\n            return aaa(0, N, 0);\n        }\n\n        long long aaa(long long current, long long N, int mask) {\n            if (current > N) {\n                return 0;\n            }\n            long long count = 0;\n            if (current > 0) {\n                if (mask == 7) { // 7 in binary is 111, meaning we have 3,5,7\n                    count = 1;\n                } else {\n                    count = 0;\n                }\n            } else {\n                count = 0;\n            }\n            // Append 3,5,7\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 3, N, mask | 1);\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 5, N, mask | 2);\n            count += aaa(current * 10 + 7, N, mask | 4);\n            return count;\n        }\n\n   But note: the Python code does:\n\n        ans = 1 if set(str(int(n))) == {'7','5','3'} else 0\n\n   However, the condition set(...)=={'7','5','3'} requires that the number has only the digits 7,5,3 and all of them? Our mask condition (mask==7) ensures that we have at least one of each? and since we build only with 3,5,7? then the digits are only 3,5,7? So it's equivalent.\n\n   However, what about numbers with leading zeros? We avoid because we start building from 0 and then we only build 3,5,7? and then we never have a digit 0 again? because we are building with 3,5,7? So the mask condition is safe.\n\n   But note: the initial call: current=0? then we build 3,5,7? which are positive? and then we build from 3: 33,35,37? etc. Then we never get a number with a leading zero? because we start from 0 only once? and then we build without 0? So it's safe.\n\n   However, the condition in the Python code: the initial call is aaa('0')? which is a string? Then we build '03'? which becomes 3? So we are building 3,5,7? and then 33,35,37, etc. So we are not building 0 again? because we start with 0 and then we build 3,5,7? and then we build from 3: 33,35,37? and then from 33: 333, etc.\n\n   But note: the Python code also builds numbers starting with 0? but then we convert to int? which removes the leading zeros? So the number 0 is built? Then we check: set('0') is {'0'}? which is not {'3','5','7'}? So it doesn't count. Then we build 03,05,07? which become 3,5,7? which are positive? and then we build 033? which becomes 33? So we are building the same as the C version? But in the C version, we start with current=0? then we build 3? which is positive? then from 3 we build 33? etc. So we skip the 0? because current>0? and then we build 3,5,7? and then 33,35,37? etc. So the C version does not build the 0 again? because the initial current=0? then we build 3,5,7? and then we never go back to 0? So we are safe.\n\n   However, the Python code builds the string '0'? then appends? and then converts to int? which removes the leading zeros? So the number 0 is built? Then the next numbers are built by appending? and then they become positive. In the C version, we start with 0? then we build 3? which is 3? Then we don't have the number 0? because we skip it (current==0) in the count? and then we build 3,5,7? So the numbers we build in the C version are the same as the Python version? except the 0? which is not counted? So it's the same.\n\n   But note: the Python code also builds the number 0? but then it doesn't count? and then builds 3,5,7? etc. So the C version is equivalent.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the Python code builds numbers that might be represented with leading zeros? but when converted to int? they become the same as without? So the C version that builds the numbers without the string representation? by multiplying? is equivalent.\n\n   Implementation of step1:\n\n        We read:\n            int n;\n            long long L, R, QL, QR;\n            scanf(\"%d %lld %lld %lld %lld\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n\n            Then read n integers: we'll use an array W of size n? and then an array sum_el of size n+1.\n\n        Then:\n\n            long long *W = (long long *)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n            for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%lld\", &W[i]);\n            }\n\n            Then compute sum_el: an array of n+1? We can use dynamic allocation? or a variable-length array? But n is read? so we can allocate.\n\n            long long *sum_el = (long long *)malloc((n+1)*sizeof(long long));\n            sum_el[0] = 0;\n            for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1];\n            }\n\n            Then initialize answer = QR * (n - 1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\n            Then for i from 1 to n:\n\n                long long energy = L * sum_el[i] + R * (sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n                if (i > n - i) {\n                    energy += (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL;\n                } else if (n - i > i) {\n                    energy += ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR;\n                }\n                if (energy < answer) {\n                    answer = energy;\n                }\n\n            Then free the arrays? But we are going to return the answer and then use it? and then the program continues? But we are in a function? Then we can free and return the answer.\n\n        However, note: the first program prints the answer? But in our chain we don't print? we return.\n\n   Implementation of step3:\n\n        We precomputed a global list? We'll have:\n\n            long long *global_list = NULL;\n            int global_size = 0;\n\n        Then we write a recursive function to generate:\n\n            void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n                if (number > 10000000000LL) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n                    // add to global_list? we need to realloc if needed? but we know max size? 1000? so we can set a max? say 1000.\n                    // We'll use a static array? or we can use a global array with fixed max? and a global index.\n                    // We'll use a global array and a global index? and we set max=1000? and then if global_size < 1000, we add.\n                    if (global_size < MAX_SIZE) {\n                        global_list[global_size++] = number;\n                    }\n                }\n                gen(number * 10 + 4, four+1, seven);\n                gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven+1);\n            }\n\n        Then in main, we do:\n\n            #define MAX_SIZE 1000\n            global_list = (long long *)malloc(MAX_SIZE * sizeof(long long));\n            global_size = 0;\n            gen(0,0,0);\n            // Then sort global_list of size global_size? using qsort.\n\n        Then step3: we traverse global_list to find the first element >= n.\n\n        But note: the original Python program also includes the number 0? But the condition (number>0 and four==seven)? so 0 is not included? because number>0? So we are safe.\n\n   However, the gen function in the original Python program starts with gen(0,0,0)? and then it does:\n\n        if (number > 0 and four==seven): append\n\n        and then recursively calls gen(number*10+4, four+1, seven) and gen(number*10+7, four, seven+1)\n\n        So we do the same.\n\n   But note: the initial call with (0,0,0) leads to:\n\n        number=0 -> skip (because number>0 fails) -> then call gen(4,1,0) and gen(7,0,1).\n\n        So we are building from 0? but we don't add 0? and then we build 4 and 7? and then from 4: 44,47? and from 7:74,77? etc.\n\n   So the C version should be the same.\n\n   Finally, we must free memory? But the program ends? So we don't have to? But we'll free for good practice? Or not? The problem doesn't care.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Precompute global_list for step3? (only once at the start of the program)\n\n        Then:\n\n            long long res1 = step1();   // which reads from stdin and computes the first answer.\n\n            long long res2 = step2(res1); // recursive function for counting\n\n            long long res3 = step3(res2); // lookup in the global_list\n\n            printf(\"%lld\\n\", res3);   // output the result of the entire chain.\n\n        Then free global_list? and any other allocated memory? But step1 allocated arrays? We should free them? But step1 is a function? we can free inside step1? after we computed the answer? but note: we use the arrays until the end of step1? so we can free.\n\n   Let's write the code:\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            #include <stdio.h>\n            #include <stdlib.h>\n            #include <string.h>\n\n            #define MAX_SIZE 1000\n\n            long long *global_list;\n            int global_size;\n\n            // For step3: gen function\n            void gen(long long number, int four, int seven) {\n                if (number > 10000000000LL) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                if (number > 0 && four == seven) {\n                    if (global_size < MAX_SIZE) {\n                        global_list[global_size++] = number;\n                    }\n                }\n                gen(number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven);\n                gen(number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1);\n            }\n\n            // Comparison function for qsort\n            int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {\n                long long arg1 = *(const long long *)a;\n                long long arg2 = *(const long long *)b;\n                if (arg1 < arg2) return -1;\n                if (arg1 > arg2) return 1;\n                return 0;\n            }\n\n            // Step1 function\n            long long step1() {\n                int n;\n                long long L, R, QL, QR;\n                scanf(\"%d %lld %lld %lld %lld\", &n, &L, &R, &QL, &QR);\n\n                long long *W = (long long *)malloc(n * sizeof(long long));\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%lld\", &W[i]);\n                }\n\n                long long *sum_el = (long long *)malloc((n+1) * sizeof(long long));\n                sum_el[0] = 0;\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                    sum_el[i] = sum_el[i-1] + W[i-1];\n                }\n\n                long long answer = QR * (n - 1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                    long long energy = L * sum_el[i] + R * (sum_el[n] - sum_el[i]);\n                    if (i > n - i) {\n                        energy += (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL;\n                    } else if (n - i > i) {\n                        energy += ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR;\n                    }\n                    if (energy < answer) {\n                        answer = energy;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Free the allocated arrays\n                free(W);\n                free(sum_el);\n\n                return answer;\n            }\n\n            // Step2: recursive function aaa\n            long long aaa(long long current, long long N, int mask) {\n                if (current > N) {\n                    return 0;\n                }\n                long long count = 0;\n                if (current > 0) {\n                    if (mask == 7) {\n                        count = 1;\n                    } else {\n                        count = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n                // Append 3,5,7\n                count += aaa(current * 10 + 3, N, mask | 1);\n                count += aaa(current * 10 + 5, N, mask | 2);\n                count += aaa(current * 10 + 7, N, mask | 4);\n                return count;\n            }\n\n            long long step2(long long N) {\n                // If N is less than 3, then we cannot have any number? but the smallest is 3?

That might be a problem? But the count (step2) is the count of numbers <= the first answer? and the first answer is an energy? which might be huge? But the count (step2) is at most the number of numbers we built? which is about 3^d (where d is the number of digits) but d is at most 10? so the count is about 3^10 = 59049? which is less than 10^10? So the step3 input is at most 59049? and the list has numbers: the smallest is 44? and then 47, etc? and 44 is 44? which is greater than 59049? No: 44 is less than 59049? Then we will find a number? Actually, the list has numbers as big as 10^10? and 10^10 is greater than 59049? So we will always find a number? So we don't need to worry.\n\n                // But to be safe, we return 0 if none found? or we can return a big number? The problem says: the list is generated up to 10^10? and the input n (which is the output of step2) is at most 59049? So the smallest number in the list is 44? which is less than 59049? but we need the smallest number that is >= n? and n might be 59049? then we need a number >=59049? and the list has numbers with more digits? the next numbers: 4444? 4447, etc? and 4444 is 4444? which is less than 59049? then 44444? which is 44444? still less? then 444444? which is 444444? which is greater than 59049?

So we can do.\n\n   But note: the first answer (res1) might be huge? but the step2 function builds numbers that are at most 10 digits? because the numbers are built by appending 3,5,7? and we stop at 11 digits? So the recursion depth is at most 11? and the total nodes is about (3^11 - 1)/2? which is about 177147? which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's test with small inputs.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the step1 function uses a loop for i from 1 to n? and n can be up to 100000? as in the input? The problem doesn't specify constraints? but the first program says n? and we read n? and then we do a loop for i in [1, n]? so O(n)? which is acceptable for n=100000? But note: the first program also does:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1): ... which is O(n)? and we do that? so we are O(n)? which is acceptable for 100000.\n\n   So the entire program should work.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: we must be cautious for the step1: the condition for adding QL or QR? The Python code:\n\n        if i > (n - i):\n            energy = energy + (i - (n - i) - 1) * QL\n        elif (n - i) > i:\n            energy = energy + ((n - i) - i - 1) * QR\n\n        We do the same.\n\n   But note: the condition: i and n-i? and then we subtract 1? So if i=5, n-i=3, then we add (5-3-1)=1 * QL.\n\n   We'll code accordingly.\n\n   We'll write the entire C program as described.\n\n   One more note: the step2 function: the initial call is aaa(0, N, 0)? and then we build numbers? but note: the number 0 is built? then we skip because current>0 is false? and then we build 3,5,7? which are positive? so we check mask? which for 3: mask=1? then we don't count? because we require mask=7? So we only count when we have all three? and the number is positive? and <=N.\n\n   This matches the Python code.\n\n   We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the step2 function might be called with a very large N? but the numbers we build are at most 10^10? because we build only 10 digits? So if N is greater than 10^10? then we build all the numbers? but we stop at 11 digits? which is about 10^10? So we build the same set? regardless of N? as long as N>= the maximum number we build? which is 7777777777? which is less than 10^10? So we build the same set? and then we count only those that are <=N? but if N is huge? we still build the same set? because we stop at 11 digits? So we build about 3^10 numbers? which is 59049? So it's efficient.\n\n   But if N is small? then we stop early? so it's efficient.\n\n   We are ready to write the code.\n\n   One last note: the step1 function: the initial answer is set to:\n\n        answer = QR * (n - 1) + sum_el[n] * R;\n\n   This corresponds to taking all from the right? Then we iterate i from 1 to n? which corresponds to taking i from the left and n-i from the right? and then we adjust with the cost of switching sides? if we have more on one side? we add the extra cost for the consecutive same side.\n\n   We do the same.\n\n   Now, the code:"
