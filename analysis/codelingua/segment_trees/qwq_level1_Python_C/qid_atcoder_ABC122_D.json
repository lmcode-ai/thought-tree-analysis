So first, need to implement a helper function to encode a given 3-character string into its integer index (0-63). Function: int encode(const char *s) {\n\n    // s is a 3-length string. int res =0;\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char c = s[i];\n        int value;\n        switch(c) {\n            case 'A': value=0; break;\n            case 'C': value=1; break;\n            case 'G': value=2; break;\n            case 'T': value=3;\n        }\n        res = res *4 + value;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nWait wait. Wait 4^2 is 16, 4^1* next -> the first digit (i=0) should multiply by 16, second by 4, then third 1. The loop here:\n\nfor i from 0 to 2 (three characters):\n\nres starts as 0. i=0: \n\nvalue of first char gives first part. So \n\nres = 0 *4 + value \u2192 which is value. Then, for the second character (i=1):\n\nres = (previous res)*4 + value. that gives (value *4) + next value? Wait let me see:\n\nFirst character (i0) \u2192 digit2? (the first digit of the 3 digits). So the first step is:\n\ndigit0: the first character. The first step (i=0):\n\nres = value0 (the first character).\n\ni=1 (second char), then:\n\nres = (res)*4 + value1 \u2192 value0*4 + val1 \u2192 which is first character *4^1 *4? Hmm, no, Let me see:\n\nWait let me see an example. Let's say the string is \"AAC\", so each char:\n\n'A','A','C'. The first character is 'A' (0). So after first step, res is 0. Second character index1 (i loop's second step):\n\nSecond character 'A', which is also 0. res becomes (0 *4) + 0 \u21920. Third character (i=2):\n\nchar C \u21921. res = (0)*4 \u21920 +1 \u21921. Thus the total would be 1. So the most significant digit is added first. Hmm, but in the formula:\n\nres = ( ( (digit0 *4 ) + digit1 ) *4 ) + digit2 Thus equals digit0 *16 + digit1 *4 + digit2 \u2192 which is exactly the desired base-4 encoding. So the function code above is correct. Thus, given a string like \u2018TTT\u2019 which is T, T, T \u2192 each is 3 \u2192 as digits each 3:\n\n3 *16 + 3 *4 +3 \u2192 48 + 12 +3 = 63. So TTT would be index 63. So encoding is correct. Thus, this helper function can turn the last3 string into an integer for memoization.",

Thus the function definition for dfs would be:\n\nlong long dfs(int cur, char last3 []) \n\nso that the array has 3 elements. Now, in the dfs function, for each character c in ACGT, then the new_last3 is formed by:\n\nchar new_last3[3] = {last3[1], last3[2], c['ACGT']}; Wait, for each character in \"ACGT\", we want to create a new_last3 which is:\n\nlast three characters being last3[1] and [2] plus the new c.\n\nWait for example:\n\nlast3 is an array of 3 chars [a][b][c], then new_last3 would be [b][c], new_c. Thus, the new_last3 array is:\n\nnew_last3[0] = last3[1], new_last3[1] = last3[2], new_last3[2] = c.\n\nWait then, to form the next's last3. So in the C code, this processing would be done in the loop. Now, in code, the dfs function would work like:\n\nlong long dfs( int cur, char last3[3] ) {\n\n    int code = encode( last3 ); // convert to integer. // check memo:\n    if ( memo[cur][code] ! = -1 ) return memo[cur][code];\n\n    if ( cur == n ) return 1; \n\n    long long ret=0; \n    for (each character in \"ACGT\") // loop over four possibilities\n    {\n        char c = <current_char>; \n\n        // first, check if adding the new character is valid (uses ok)\n        // need to create the last4 which is the current last3 + c. \n        // so the last4 is a 4-character string: last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], c ?\n\nBecause the ok function expects last4 as the previous three chars plus the new one? Wait, in Python's code, the call is ok(last3 + c). The 'last3' in that context is a 3-character string; adding a c (char) makes it 4-character, which is last4 for the 'ok' function. Thus, in C code:\n\nthe variables to pass to ok are last3's three chars plus new c as a 4-char array.",

Now, the 'dfs' function:\n\nFunction return value is ll. Function declaration: \n\nll dfs(int cur, const char last3_str[3]); Wait, but in C, the function parameters can have array parameters which will decay into pointers.

So if in any of the four loops (i=0 to 3), swapping and checking the two possible AGC presence, then return false (0). So in the code above, as soon as any one of those two if's is true, returns 0.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me look through the Python code first to understand what it's doing. The main goal here is probably solving some kind of combinatorial problem with recursion and memoization. The functions seem to be checking for certain sequences and counting valid combinations.\n\nStarting with the 'ok' function. It takes last4, which is a string of 4 characters, I think. The function checks if any of the permutations of swapping elements (like shifting adjacent pairs) contain 'AGC'? If yes, it returns False, meaning that the combination is invalid and we shouldn't consider it. The function returns True otherwise, allowing the combination. \n\nThen there's the dfs function which uses memoization. It takes a current position and a string of the last three characters. It checks the memo to see if it has computed this before. If so, returns it. If the current position has reached N, then it's a valid sequence, so returns 1. Otherwise, it loops through the four possible nucleotides A, C, G, T, tries adding each next character, checks if the new sequence (last3 plus the new character) is okay using the ok function, then recursively calls dfs with the updated current and last3.\n\nThe main part sets the modulo 1e9+7 and initializes memo as a list of dictionaries. The initial call is with 'TTT' as the starting last3? Wait, the code is written for last3 being 3 characters? Wait, the ok function is called with last3 + c. That would make last3 a 3-character string, so adding a c would give a 4-length? Wait the ok function's argument is 'last4' but in the code, when dk is called, the argument is 'last3 + c. So ok takes a string of length 3+1=4, which is okay. So the ok function's check is for the last four characters?\n\nSo in the ok function, the code is taking the input last4 (4 characters), then creating a list of those. Then for each i from 0 to 3, trying swaps. For example, if i=0, maybe they start at 1? Wait the loop is for the four elements. The code does, for each i in 0 to 3 (since range(4) in Python is 0-3, but the if it has i >=1? So then the code does the swap only when i is 1 or 3: Wait, the code says:\n\nif i >=1: swap t[i] and t[i-1]? \n\nWait, for each i, it makes a temporary list t of the last4, then if i is >=1, it swaps the i and i-1 elements? Then, the resulting string, if it contains 'AGC', then returns False? Wait, no, the code is saying if any of the swapped versions (the original might be considered too?), then returns true for invalidness?\n\nWait let me read that code again.\n\nThe code in ok function is:\n\ndef ok(last4):\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        t = list(last4)\n\n        if i >= 1:\n            t[i], t[i-1] = t[i-1], t[i]\n\n        temp_str = ''.join(t)\n        if temp_str.count('AGC') >=1:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, no. For each i from 0 to 3:\n\nThey create a list t from last4 (the 4 characters). Then if i is at least 1, swap t[i] with previous. So for each i in the loop:\n\nWhen i=0, no swap. So t remains the same as last4.\n\ni=1: swap element 1 and 0 (left with previous)\n\ni=2: swap 2 and 1.\n\ni=3: swap 3 and 2?\n\nWait, so each i in the loop is looking at the i-th position, and swaps with the prior one, but only when i is >=1. \n\nWait, the for loop is over 4 elements. So for each possible position i (0-3), but on the t list, if i is 1, swap with 0 (their indices are starting at zero). So the code is creating a list t, then for each i from 0 to 3:\n\nWhen i=0, do nothing.\n\nFor each of those 4 positions, it might swap one pair. Wait, I don't understand. The comment says that for each i, the code swaps t[i] with the previous? So for each i, the code creates a new arrangement where if you swap the ith and (i-1)th characters. \n\nWait the reason is to check that the current string after adding the next character, when swapped would form an 'AGC'? \n\nAlternatively, the function ok is trying to check that the current 4 characters (the new string after adding this character) does not have a permutation that contains 'AGC'? Or more precisely, that the original or any of the swaps of adjacent characters in the 4-character string contain 'AGC'.\n\nWait the 'ok' function is returning false if for any i, after swapping their i and i-1 (but only if i >=1), the string would contain AGC. \n\nWait no, the code loops over the 4 i's, each time making a possible swap (for some i's) and checks whether that swapped string contains 'AGC'. If any of the iterations leads to 'AGC', then the function returns false. \n\nSo the idea is that, for the current four characters (last4), if any adjacent transposition (swapping two adjacent characters) results in a string that includes the substring 'AGC', then this is considered bad. Hence, the new character being added cannot be part of such a sequence. \n\nSo the ok() function is checking that the four characters, the current and any adjacent swapped version doesn't form AGC as a substring.\n\nHmm, that might be part of some code challenge where sequences with 'AGC' are forbidden, but also, if making certain swaps would bring it closer to forming AGC in the previous steps (or I guess the code tries to prevent sequences that are adjacent swaps of such forbidden patterns. Or maybe the problem is to count all possible string sequences of length N using ACGT, that do not contain the substring 'AGC', and also any two adjacent characters cannot be part of a situation where swapping them creates such a substring. \n\nNot sure about the problem exact details, but the translation is required.\n\nNow translating this into C. \n\nFirst, the functions. Python functions can be translated to C functions. The 'ok' function is a helper function for checking the conditions. The main functions are the dfs and the main program.\n\nBut C doesn't have the luxury of function definitions with parameters of strings. So need to handle strings as arrays or as char pointers.\n\nFirst, the Python code uses strings, which in C are null-terminated char arrays. The 'ok' function's argument last4 is a string of length 4. The function is supposed to return true or false.\n\nFirst let's tackle the 'ok' function in C.\n\nThe function 'ok' in Python takes a string. In C, perhaps we can have a function that takes a 4-character array as input.\n\nSo in C, let's first write:\n\nint ok(char last4[4]) { ... }\n\nWait, but in C, you can also pass a string of length 5 (4 elements + '\\0'). Or maybe the function takes a char array of exactly 4 characters. \n\nWait, since the function is dealing with a 4-character string, perhaps the input can be a string of 4 characters. So in C, perhaps we need to pass it as a char array of length 4.\n\nBut in code:\n\nBut first, let me see the logic. The Python code loops for i from 0 to 3 (since range(4)), then for each i:\n\n- make a copy of the last4's characters into the temp list 't's characters. Then swap t[i] with t[i-1], but only when i >=1. Then check whether the new string has 'AGC' as a substring.\n\nIn C, strings are handled with arrays, so the logic would be similar.\n\nFirst, we can create a temporary array of the last4's characters. For each i from 0 to 3:\n\n- copy the characters into a temporary array temp of size 4.\n\nThen, for i >=1, swap temp[i] and temp[i-1].\n\nThen create the string temp_str (which is a char array of 4 characters, but need a null-terminator to be a proper string, but since we're dealing with 4 characters, maybe it's just the array itself without a null terminator?)\n\nWait, but in the code, in Python, the ''.join(t) is the original characters, except swapped.\n\nWait in the code, the temp array is a list of chars. So when joined, the first three characters, etc., whatever.\n\nWait in code, the Python function:\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        t = list(last4)\n        if i >=1:\n            swap the elements.\n        temp_str = ''.join(t)\n        if 'AGC' is in the temp_str, then it is invalid.\n\nThe key is to check if in the temp_str, the substring 'AGC' exists.\n\nIn Python, 'AGC' is a substring of length 3. \n\nWait the temp_str is of length 4. So check if any three consecutive characters form 'AGC'.\n\nThe substring could be at position 0-3 (the first three?), 1-3, etc. So, in a 4-length string, 'AGC' can be at positions 0, 1.\n\nWait for example: \"AGCA\" has 'AGC' starting at position 0. Similarly, \"ARCG\" would have it at position 1 (assuming the third character is G?), perhaps.\n\nSo in C, for a given temp_str (the 4 characters), how do we check if \"AGC\" is a substring?\n\nWe can check the first three characters, then next possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all possibilities:\n\nif the first three characters are 'AGC' (chars 0-1-2),\n\nor characters 1,2,3 (since they form positions 1,2,3 in a 4-char string).\n\nWait for a 4-character string, possible substrings of length 3 are chars 0-2, and 1-3.\n\nWait, let's think. The full length is 4, so the starting indices are 0 and 1, for a substring length of 3. Wait 0,1 (indices 0-2?), no. Let me see:\n\nSubstring starting at index 0 (positions 0,1,2) gives first 3.\n\nStarting at 1 (indices 1,2,3) gives the last 3.\n\nThus, the function needs to check both possibilities in the four characters.\n\nSo in the code, for the string temp_str of length 4:\n\nif (substring 0-2 is 'AGC') or (substring 1-3 is 'AGC'), then return false (so that the 'ok' returns false.\n\nThus in C code for the 'ok' function, for each iteration of i (0 to 3), create a temporary array, do the swap, then check the substrings.\n\nNow coding that in C:\n\nFirst, the 'ok' function:\n\nint ok(char last4[]) {\n\n    // last4 is a 4-character array. (assuming with null terminator? or as 4 chars)\n\nWait perhaps in the code, the parameter is length 4, and the code treats it as 4 elements, not null-terminated.\n\nWait in Python's case, it is a string of 4 chars, but that's a null-terminated string. So in the C code, perhaps we can pass a 4-length array (or char[5], but without the last char being \\0?), but in code, for copying, perhaps easier to have a fixed size of 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameters are char* but we know the size is 4.\n\nHmm. Let me consider functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the C code, when passing strings between functions, we can adjust as needed.\n\nBut for the 'ok' function, the code needs to make copies of the string, swap and check.\n\nThe steps in C:\n\nFor each i from 0 to 3:\n\n1. copy the characters of last4 into a temp[4] array.\n\nWait perhaps using loops or memcpy? \n\nProbably for each step, we can loop over the 4 elements.\n\nAlternatively, since the length is always known (4), code can copy them.\n\nchar temp[4];\nfor(int k = 0; k<4; k++) temp[k] = last4[k];\n\nThen, for when i>=1: swap temp[i] and temp[i-1]. \n\nThen, check the temp array for having 'AGC' in positions 0-2 or 1-3.\n\nWait, the 'AGC' could be in a span of three characters (so first three (Indices 0,1,2) or the last three (1,2,3).\n\nSo the check could be:\n\nif ((temp[0] == 'A' && temp[1] == 'G' && temp[2] == 'C') ||\n    (temp[1] == 'A' && temp[2] == 'G' && temp[3] == 'C')) \n    // then returns true (contains AGC).\n// thus if either of these is true, the temp has AGC, so function returns false (because this permutation is invalid)\n\nWait no, for the first check, the first three characters (0,1,2) are A-G-C, so that's the string starts with AGC. \n\nThe second part is if the last three (indices 1,2,3) are A-G-C. Wait, but then that would require the combo A at position 1, G at 2, and C at 3.\n\nWait \"BAGC\" would have first 3 as \"BAG\" (no), then positions 1-3 as \"AGC\" so that is yes, contains AGC.\n\nSo the check is correct.\n\nSo in C code, the code should check for either of those two conditions. If so, then the temp after swap creates a forbidden substring. Thus the ok function returns false (invalid).\n\nThus, putting this together.\n\nSo in the loop over i from 0 to 3 (i in 0..3?), the loop iterations are:\n\nLoop 0:\n\ni is 0. So no swap.\n\ntemp is same as last4.\n\nCheck for AGC in 0-2 or 1-3.\n\nWait wait no. Wait, temp is copy of last4, but without swapping? Because the i-1 is 0-1? Wait i is zero, so i >=1 is false, so no swap.\n\nThen check temp. \n\nLoop 1: i=1.\n\nThen, swap temp[1][0], because i=1: swapping temp[1] and [0].\n\nAfter that, check the same conditions.\n\nSimilarly for i=2: swap temp[2] and [1].\n\ni=3: swap temp[3] and [2].\n\nEach time we check those two possible substrings.\n\nIf any of the four iterations (i=0 to 3) leads to a substring 'AGC', then return False. So the first iteration that finds any such condition would return false immediately. Only after all iterations pass without any occurrence, then return True (1 in C's int).\n\nThus, in C code:\n\nIn ok function:\n\nfor (i = 0 to 3):\n\n    copy the last4 into temp array.\n\n    if (i >=1):\n\n        swap temp[i] and temp[i-1]\n\n    then check for 'AGC' in positions 0-2 or 1-3.\n\n    if yes, then return 0 (False).\n\nSo if any of the iterations return a hit, the function returns false (0). Only after all iterations are done without any occurrence, then return true (1).\n\nAlright, now the 'ok' function is manageable.\n\nNext is the dfs function. But in C, recursion may be an issue, but since it's handled similarly to Python's, perhaps we can proceed.\n\nFirst, let us think of the global variables. The Python code uses n, mod, and a list 'memo' which is an array of dictionaries. The memo has a list per depth, and for each position, a dictionary mapping strings (the last3) to their return value.\n\nIn C, implementing memoization with dictionaries is more complex. Because the keys are the last3 sequences, those are stored as strings. But in C, arrays of dictionaries are hard to do directly. We need an alternative.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can represent each 'last3' as a 3-character string, and for each depth (cur), we can have an array of values stored by the last3 key. However, to index into that, the number of possible last3 keys is 4^3 = 64, since each character can be among 'ACGT'.\n\nAh! There are only 4^3 = 64 possible different last3 strings. That's manageable. So the memo could be a 2D array where memo[cur][index], and the 'index' is 0-63, corresponding to each unique combination of three characters from ACGT. Thus, converting \"AAC\" or \"TTT\" to a unique number from 0-63.\n\nThis is necessary because storing a dictionary for each cur and comparing strings every time may be too slow, and in C, we can optimize with the small possible keyspace.\n\nSo the plan for memoization:\n\nInstead of having a list of dictionaries, we can have a 2D array:\n\nlong long memo[n+1][64], where for each depth cur, and for each possible last3 (mapped to a number between 0-63) we store the computed value.\n\nBut how to encode the 'last3' string into an integer. Let's think:\n\nEach character can be 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', so 4 options. Let me assign each character a value like:\n\n'A' \u2192 0, 'C' \u21921, 'G' \u21922, 'T'\u21923.\n\nThus, each 3-character string can be encoded as a base-4 number of 3 digits. So for example \"AAC\" would be:\n\n'A' (0) *4^2 + 'A'(0)*4^1 + 'C' (1)*4^0 \u2192 0 + 0 +1 \u2192 total 1?\n\nWait the first character (leftmost) is the highest digit. Wait, maybe the rightmost is the least significant? So the order depends on which component is which digit.\n\nAlternatively, the first character (index 0 of the 3-character string) is the highest power. So the way to compute:\n\nchar a[3] \u2192 last3.\n\nencode = a[0] * 16 + a[1]*4 +a[2]\n\nWait since 4*4*4 is 64. So:\n\nfor each character, we can convert 'A' to 0, 'C' to1, 'G' to2, 'T' to3.\n\nSo for the three characters, the encoded value is (digit1)*16 + (digit2)*4 + digit3. Where digit1 is from the first char (the first in the string), digit2 the second, digit3 the third. Thus, the total will be between 0 and 63.\n\nThis way, memoization can be done with a table of size (n+1) *64.\n\nSo first, need to implement a helper function to encode a given 3-character string into its integer index (0-63).\n\nFunction: int encode(const char *s) {\n\n    // s is a 3-length string. \n\n    int res =0;\n    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char c = s[i];\n        int value;\n        switch(c) {\n            case 'A': value=0; break;\n            case 'C': value=1; break;\n            case 'G': value=2; break;\n            case 'T': value=3;\n        }\n        res = res *4 + value;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nWait wait. Wait 4^2 is 16, 4^1* next -> the first digit (i=0) should multiply by 16, second by 4, then third 1.\n\nThe loop here:\n\nfor i from 0 to 2 (three characters):\n\nres starts as 0.\n\ni=0: \n\nvalue of first char gives first part. So \n\nres = 0 *4 + value \u2192 which is value.\n\nThen, for the second character (i=1):\n\nres = (previous res)*4 + value. that gives (value *4) + next value?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nFirst character (i0) \u2192 digit2? (the first digit of the 3 digits). So the first step is:\n\ndigit0: the first character.\n\nThe first step (i=0):\n\nres = value0 (the first character).\n\ni=1 (second char), then:\n\nres = (res)*4 + value1 \u2192 value0*4 + val1 \u2192 which is first character *4^1 *4? Hmm, no, Let me see:\n\nWait let me see an example. Let's say the string is \"AAC\", so each char:\n\n'A','A','C'.\n\nThe first character is 'A' (0). So after first step, res is 0.\n\nSecond character index1 (i loop's second step):\n\nSecond character 'A', which is also 0. \n\nres becomes (0 *4) + 0 \u21920.\n\nThird character (i=2):\n\nchar C \u21921.\n\nres = (0)*4 \u21920 +1 \u21921.\n\nThus the total would be 1.\n\nSo the most significant digit is added first.\n\nHmm, but in the formula:\n\nres = ( ( (digit0 *4 ) + digit1 ) *4 ) + digit2 \n\nThus equals digit0 *16 + digit1 *4 + digit2 \u2192 which is exactly the desired base-4 encoding. So the function code above is correct.\n\nThus, given a string like \u2018TTT\u2019 which is T, T, T \u2192 each is 3 \u2192 as digits each 3:\n\n3 *16 + 3 *4 +3 \u2192 48 + 12 +3 = 63. So TTT would be index 63.\n\nSo encoding is correct. \n\nThus, this helper function can turn the last3 string into an integer for memoization.\n\nNow, the memo can be represented as a 2D array:\n\nlong long memo[MAX_N+1][64], where MAX_N would be the maximum n possible. Since n is input, but in C we need to have it preallocated. We can set MAX_N to the maximum allowed value (like 1e5?), but since in the Python code, when n is input, it's stored in 'n'.\n\nWait the problem's constraints are not known, but for translation, as per the code, let's assume we can handle with dynamic variables. But in C, variables can't be created on heap unless using malloc. Oh right, but we can handle this with using the maximum allowed n. Wait perhaps in the problem's context, the given n is manageable. But perhaps in the original Python code, N is up to say 40, but given it's using mod, perhaps up to 1e5 or so. \n\nAlternatively, since in C, the memo table is declared once, and in Python, the 'memo' is list of dictionaries. However in C, a memo of 40x64 would be trivial. So assuming the problem allows the N to be manageable, perhaps the code can be written with memo as a global array, and read N from the input. \n\nWait in the Python code, n is taken via input(). The C code would read it from stdin.\n\nSo first, the steps:\n\nIn the main function, read n via scanf(\"%d\", &n). Then, allocate the memo array.\n\nBut in C, for variable size allocation, it's better to use dynamic allocation. So perhaps:\n\nlong long (*memo)[64]; \n\nThen, after reading n, allocate memo as (n+1) rows:\n\nmemo = (long long(*)[64])calloc( (n+1)*64, sizeof(long long));\n\nWait more carefully:\n\nEach row is an array of 64 long long elements. So the total size is (n+1) * 64. \n\nAlternatively, the better approach is:\n\nmemo is a 2d array of rows (n+1) and columns (64), dynamically allocated.\n\nSo:\n\nint n;\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\nint max_length = n +1;\n// Allocate 2D array:\nlong long (*memo)[64] = (long long(*)[64])malloc( sizeof(long long) * (max_length) *64 / sizeof(long long));\n\nWait, no. Wait:\n\nEither calculate the right size. Or use a standard way:\n\nThe total rows are (max_length), each row has 64 elements of long long. So each row is [64] = an array of 64 elements.\n\nThus, the size for all rows is (max_length) * 64 * sizeof (long long). \n\nSo in code:\n\nmemo = malloc( (max_length) * 64 * sizeof(long long) );\n\nBut to access it as a 2d array. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to predefine a max size. Suppose the problem constraints say n is up to 30 or 50 or so, but since the Python code uses a list of length n+1, perhaps in C it can be allocated as a fixed array.\n\nAlternatively, the C code can first read n, then call malloc to create a 2D array where first dimension is n+1 and second is 64. To use memoization properly, we need to initialize the table with -1 (or a flag indicating -1 as uncomputed) so that when we check if the entry is computed.\n\nHmm, in Python, the memo is initialized as a list of empty dictionaries for each cur. Then, once a value is computed, it is stores in memo[cur][last3] = ret.\n\nThus, in C, we can do similar thing for each entry. For every position cur, for every last3 (0-63), memo is maybe -1 to indicate not computed yet. Then when we compute a value, we store it there.\n\nThus:\n\nInitialize:\n\nfor all i from 0 to n:\n\n    for j from 0 to 63:\n\n        memo[i][j] = -1.\n\nSo when we check, we can see if the entry is still -1. \n\nThus the code must initialize the memo table, then in the dfs function, check if memo[cur][code] is not -1 (computed), then return its value.\n\nBut let us think through the structure.\n\nC code outline:\n\nStart with defines:\n\n#define MOD 1000000007\n\nThen functions:\n\nint ok(char *last4); // takes a 4 characters, probably as a C-style string (null-terminated?)\n\nWait but the length is exactly 4. So for the first function's signature:\n\nint ok(char last4[4]); // But in C, arrays decay to pointers, so the parameter can be char *.\n\nBut perhaps in code, you can make sure the input is 4 characters, then the ok function can proceed.\n\nNow, the helper function encode():\n\nint encode(const char *s) // s is 3 characters (assuming it's a null-terminated string of length 3?), or exactly three characters.\n\nAssuming s is length 3 (like \"TTT\" is three characters, plus the null terminator? Or no?)\n\nWait for \"TTT\", the string is four bytes including the null terminator? Well, encode function should process the first 3 characters, so perhaps it's safe.\n\nWait, the input is the current 'last3' (like 'TTT' which is 3 characters), so when passing strings of length 3, the function can read the first three chars, but in C, a string of length 3 would have four bytes (char[4], with the fourth being zero). \n\nHmm. For example, in code when we have a char temp[last3], then \"TTT\" would be stored in a char [4], with the \\0 at fourth byte. So the encode function can read the first 3 characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the encode function is called with a 3-length string. The function expects exactly three characters.\n\nSo assuming that whenever we call encode, it is given precisely a 3-character string (could be in an array of size 4 with a '\\0').\n\nThus.\n\nNow, the dfs function:\n\nlong long dfs(int cur, char last3[3]); \n\nWait last3 must be a 3-character array, so that when you pass a string like 'TTT', it's an array of at least 3+1 length. But the function can process the first three characters.\n\nWait alternatively, to simplify, perhaps represent last3 as a 3-character char array (without null terminator) so that when appending a new character, etc., the array can represent it properly.\n\nWait in the dfs function, the parameters are current depth and last3 (the previous three characters). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps pass the last3 as a char[4] with the first three, and then append. Wait, possibly simplest to represent last3 as a char array of three characters. So in C, the parameters can be char arr of 3 chars (or pointer to first element).\n\nBut in code, it's a bit complicated. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, each step appends a new character to the end, but when generating it, the new last3 is the old last3 (chars 1,2) plus the new char: last3[1:] + c.\n\nSo for example, if the current last3 is 'ABC', and c is 'D', the new last3 is 'BCD'.\n\nThus, to handle this, the functions need to manipulate the last3 string as a 3-character buffer.\n\nPerhaps in C, we can represent last3 as a char buffer of three characters (plus terminating zero?), but it's easier as:\n\nchar last3[3]\n\nInitially, in main, the initial value is \"TTT\", which can be stored as a string (3 characters plus \\0), but when passing to the dfs function, the function can just copy the three characters.\n\nAlternatively, the dfs function's parameters can be passed as a string, e.g., a char pointer.\n\nIn any case, here is a possible approach for representing last3 as a char array with size 3, not null-terminator. \n\nThus the function definition for dfs would be:\n\nlong long dfs(int cur, char last3[]) \n\nso that the array has 3 elements.\n\nNow, in the dfs function, for each character c in ACGT, then the new_last3 is formed by:\n\nchar new_last3[3] = {last3[1], last3[2], c['ACGT']};\n\nWait, for each character in \"ACGT\", we want to create a new_last3 which is:\n\nlast three characters being last3[1] and [2] plus the new c.\n\nWait for example:\n\nlast3 is an array of 3 chars [a][b][c], then new_last3 would be [b][c], new_c.\n\nThus, the new_last3 array is:\n\nnew_last3[0] = last3[1], new_last3[1] = last3[2], new_last3[2] = c.\n\nWait then, to form the next's last3.\n\nSo in the C code, this processing would be done in the loop.\n\nNow, in code, the dfs function would work like:\n\nlong long dfs( int cur, char last3[3] ) {\n\n    int code = encode( last3 ); // convert to integer.\n    // check memo:\n    if ( memo[cur][code] != -1 ) return memo[cur][code];\n\n    if ( cur == n ) return 1; \n\n    long long ret=0; \n    for (each character in \"ACGT\") // loop over four possibilities\n    {\n        char c = <current_char>; \n\n        // first, check if adding the new character is valid (uses ok)\n        // need to create the last4 which is the current last3 + c. \n        // so the last4 is a 4-character string: last3[0], last3[1], last3[2], c ?\n\nBecause the ok function expects last4 as the previous three chars plus the new one? \n\nWait, in Python's code, the call is ok(last3 + c). \n\nThe 'last3' in that context is a 3-character string; adding a c (char) makes it 4-character, which is last4 for the 'ok' function.\n\nThus, in C code:\n\nthe variables to pass to ok are last3's three chars plus new c as a 4-char array. \n\nThus, for each candidate character c, the last4 would consist of the three chars in last3 plus c (as the fourth).\n\nSo we need to construct that temporary 4-character array for the ok function check.\n\nThus:\n\nWe need to create a temporary buffer:\n\nchar temp_last4[4];\n\ntemp_last4[0] = last3[0];\ntemp_last4[1] = last3[1];\ntemp_last4[2] = last3[2];\ntemp_last4[3] = c;\n\nThen, call ok(temp_last4):\n\nif (ok(temp_last4)) {\n\n    // ok, proceed \n\n    // generate the new_last3 needed for next call:\n    char new_last3[3];\n    new_last3[0] = last3[1];\n    new_last3[1] = last3[2];\n    new_last3[2] = c;\n\n    long long temp = dfs( cur +1, new_last3 );\n    ret = (ret + temp) % MOD; \n}\n\nWait in C, arrays are passed by pointers, so when passing last3 to dfs, passing a pointer to the first element. So for new_last3, which is a 3-character array, passing it by address would be okay. However, in C, if we create new_last3 on the stack inside each loop iteration (inside the for c loop), when passed to the recursive call, that should be okay as the recursive calls will have their own copies. Wait but in the recursive call, the new_last3 has to be a variable that exists.\n\nWait the variable new_last3 is a local variable inside the loop:\n\nWithin the for (c ...) loop:\n\nInside the body (after the ok check), creating new_last3:\n\nWe can do:\n\nchar new_last3[3] = { last3[1], last3[2], c };\n\nThen passing to dfs(..., new_last3). \n\nThus, that is okay.\n\nThus:\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, considering all the steps.\n\nFirst, the code's global variables:\n\nThe memo is a dynamically allocated 2D array of (n+1)*64.\n\nThus, in the main function:\n\nRead n from input (scanf), then allocate the memo. Initialize all entries to -1.\n\nWait the code in main would need to initialize the memo array to -1.\n\nAlternatively, after malloc, we can set all the bytes to -1 (but since we allocated as signed long long, initializing with '-1' is okay.\n\nWait:\n\nIn code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007 \n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nint ok(char *last4);  // Takes a 4-char array (or string).\nint encode(const char *last3); // takes a 3-char string (like last3).\n\nvoid initialize_memo(int n, ll (*memo)[64], int rows) {\n    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++)\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++)\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    \n    // Allocate memo as (n+1) rows, 64 columns.\n    // Assuming row size is 64 elements per row.\n    int rows_needed = n +1;\n    \n    ll (*memo)[64] = (ll (*)[64]) malloc( rows_needed * 64 * sizeof(ll) );\n    if (!memo) exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    \n    // Initialize all to -1.\n    initialize_memo(n, memo, rows_needed);\n    \n    // Setup start is 'TTT'.\n    // 'TTT' is three characters. \n    char start[] = \"TTT\";\n    \n    // call dfs(0, start). \n    ll result = dfs(0, start);\n    \n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result % MOD);\n    \n    free(memo);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but the dfs would have the code variable as last3. The encoded 'TTT' is 63 as before.\n\nWait must the start array be a 3-character string? Let's see:\n\nchar start[] = \"TTT\"; \u2192 this is 4 chars (null terminated), but the encode function will handle first three characters.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the 'dfs' function:\n\nFunction return value is ll. \n\nFunction declaration: \n\nll dfs(int cur, const char last3_str[3]);\n\nWait, but in C, the function parameters can have array parameters which will decay into pointers. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use pointers:\n\nll dfs(int cur, const char *last3) {\n\n    // check memo:\n\n    int code = encode(last3);\n\n    if ( memo[cur][code] != -1 )\n        return memo[cur][code];\n\n    if (cur ==n )\n        return 1;\n    \n    ll ret =0;\n    \n    char c_list[] = \"ACGT\";\n\n    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n        char c = c_list[i];\n        \n        // Form last4 array by combining last3 (three chars) plus c (the new one)\n        char last4[4];\n        last4[0] = last3[0];\n        last4[1] = last3[1];\n        last4[2] = last3[2];\n        last4[3] = c;\n\n        if( ok(last4) ) {\n            // Need to create new_last3 for the next call: last3[1],last3[2], c \n\n            char new_last3[3];\n            new_last3[0] = last3[1];\n            new_last3[1] = last3[2];\n            new_last3[2] = c;\n            \n            ll res = dfs( cur+1, new_last3 );\n            ret = (ret + res) % MOD;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    memo[cur][code] = ret;\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\nThus, the code for dfs function.\n\nThe ok function:\n\nint ok(char *last4) { \n\n    for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {\n\n        // create a copy of last4, since we have to swap.\n        char temp[4];\n        for (int k=0; k<4; k++) temp[k] = last4[k];\n        \n        if (i >=1) {\n            // swap temp[i] and temp[i-1]\n            char t = temp[i];\n            temp[i] = temp[i-1];\n            temp[i-1] = t;\n        }\n\n        // check if AGC is present in the temp\n        // check first three letters (indices 0-2)\n        if (temp[0] == 'A' && temp[1] == 'G' && temp[2] == 'C') {\n            return 0; // found, invalid thus return false (0)\n        }\n        // check indices starting from 1: 1,2,3\n        if (temp[1] == 'A' && temp[2] == 'G' && temp[3] == 'C') {\n            return 0; // invalid\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If none of the four cases found, return 1 (ok)\n    return 1;\n}\n\nWait wait, the condition is if either of those is true in any iteration of i. So if in any of the four loops (i=0 to 3), swapping and checking the two possible AGC presence, then return false (0).\n\nSo in the code above, as soon as any one of those two if's is true, returns 0. \n\nThe loop runs over the four i's, so if any iteration returns, otherwise after all iterations, return true (1).\n\nThus, this seems correct.\n\nNow, the 'encode' function:\n\n int encode(const char *last3) { // last3 is a 3-char string.\n\n    int res=0;\n    for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {\n        char c = last3[i];\n        int value;\n        // NOTE: if last3 isn't three characters, it could read past the end.\n        // so it's important that the input is 3 chars long (plus possible string terminator)\n        \n        // assign numerical values:\n        switch(c) {\n            case 'A': value =0; break;\n            case 'C': value=1; break;\n            case 'G': value=2; break;\n            case 'T': value=3; break;\n            default: return -1; // invalid character, but problem guarantees only ACGT\n        }\n        // accumulate into res as base4\n        res = res *4 + value;\n    }\n    return res;\n}\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nPutting all together, the variables and functions need to be linked correctly.\n\nAlso, for the dfs function to access the memo array, it's a global variable.\n\nAh! In C, since the dfs function is recursive and accesses the memo array, the memo needs to be a global variable. Or pass it as a parameter. But in that case, function parameters will be cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, make memo a global variable.\n\nThus, the code should have the memo declared globally, not a local variable in main. \n\nHmm, so in the C code:\n\nPerhaps the memo is declared global (at top level). Thus:\n\nll (*memo)[64] = NULL; // declare before main.\n\nint n; // also global maybe? not sure.\n\nWait but n is needed in the dfs function when checking if cur == n.\n\nAh, that also requires that 'n' is a global variable.\n\nThus, the adjustments needed:\n\nDeclare variables n and memo as global:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n#define MOD 1000000007 \n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nint n;\nll (*memo)[64]; // global pointer to the memo array\n\nint ok(char *last4);\nint encode(const char *last3);\n\nvoid initialize_memo(int rows) {\n    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++)\n        for (int j=0; j<64; j++)\n            memo[i][j] = -1;\n}\n\nll dfs(int cur, const char *last3);\n\nint main() {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n); // n is global\n    \n    // Allocate memo. \n    int rows_needed = n +1;\n    memo = (ll (*)[64]) malloc( rows_needed * 64 * sizeof(ll) );\n    if (!memo) exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    \n    // Initialize all to -1.\n    initialize_memo(rows_needed);\n    \n    char start[] = \"TTT\"; \n    ll result = dfs(0, start);\n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", result % MOD);\n    \n    free(memo);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThen in dfs function:\n\nll dfs(int cur, const char *last3) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nThus, all the variables are accessible.\n\nNow, possible pitfalls:\n\n- In the ok() function's code check for the swapped temp array, but perhaps in some cases the 'last4' is expected to be a 4-character string, but maybe in C, due to null-termination? \n\nWait, the last4 array passed into ok is a locally allocated 4-char array (the code in dfs does that with 'last4[4]'), which is properly contains four chars (including the fourth char [3], which is 'c'), but the function ok will process them as the four chars, not including a null terminator.\n\nBut the for loop in ok runs only up to i=3, so all is okay.\n\n- The encode function may have not handled a fourth character, but since last3 is a three-character sequence, it's okay.\n\nAnother possible problem: in the dfs, when building new_last3, the characters are copied correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in C, when a function is passed a pointer, it's receiving a pointer to the first element, and the length isn't known, thus in case the last3 is passed as a pointer from a 3-character string (like the initial one), then the code is okay. However, when using new_last3 as char array built on the stack, it's correctly sized to be 3 chars, so it's okay.\n\nPotential bugs to watch:\n\n1. Stack overflow for large recursion depth. Since the n can be up to say, 20 (maybe), but if n is large like 30, it might be okay. However, in Python, the code uses memoization, so the depth is manageable, but in C, perhaps it's the same.\n\n2. MemoryAllocation: ensuring the malloc for the memo is allocated correctly. \n\n3. The 'MOD' is applied in the addition steps mod is 1e9+7. \n\nWait in the code:\n\nIn the dfs function:\n\nret = (ret + res) % MOD;\n\nHowever, in C, when using mod operation, with negative numbers, modulo can be negative. But since both ret and res are counting numbers added, their sum can safely under modulo, but the mod should be added in case addition makes a number larger than MOD. \n\nThus, to prevent negative, we can cast:\n\nret = (ret + res) % MOD; \n\nBut % in C has the sign of the first operand. Thus, if the sum is negative ( unlikely here because we\u2019re adding and using mod), but better to do:\n\nret = (ret + res) % MOD;\n\nBut to fix possible negative, if it comes out negative, add MOD then mod again:\n\n    ret += res;\n\n    if (ret <0) ret += MOD;\n\n    ret %= MOD;\n\nWait, perhaps safer but not sure.\n\nIn the code, each step's res is the return of dfs, which was modded it-self. So the addition is then modded again.\n\nSo long as modulo is well applied here should be okay. \n\nNow putting all together, the full code would look as written above.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nFor example, if input is n=0 (but code says cur reaches ==n, then returns 1). But according to the Python code, when n is 0, then the starting point (cur=0) and last3 is 'TTT', then the initial call to dfs would pass if n is 0: yes.\n\nWait in main, if n is zero, then:\n\nThe dfs starts with cur=0, which is equal to n, so returns 1, so the output would be 1 mod MOD, which is 1. But what is the use of last3 in that case?\n\nProbably okay.\n\nAnother test case: n=1. Then, the initial call starts with 'TTT' as last3 (3 characters). When adding the first character (the first character of the string), the new string has length 1, but according to the problem rules.\n\nHmm, perhaps small test cases can help.\n\nAssuming all code is correctly representing the Python logic. Now that I have gone through each step, it should be okay.\n\nI think the code would work as written."
