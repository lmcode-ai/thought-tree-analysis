Wait \u2014 here's maybe the better approach:\n\nWait in code, in C:\n\nWe need to read exactly m characters per input line. To avoid buffer overflows, but let's assume each line is exactly m characters. Thus, for each row:\n\nchar s[m + 1]; // including null-terminator.\n\nfgets(s, m+1, stdin);\n\n// then, s has the characters, and we can truncate to m chars, but perhaps the C code can process the characters up to m.\n\nWait actually, when using fgets, it will place a null terminator at the end, so even if there's a newline in the data, but perhaps the input is properly given so that each row is exactly m characters plus a newline, so the null terminator is placed at position m.\n\nBut let's proceed: the line s will be read, and then process each character. However in C, arrays can't have sizes that are variable at runtime unless using VLA. So if m is a variable, then declaring a array [m] is allowed only with VLA support (as of C99). So assuming the code can use C99. Thus, inside the loop over each row:\n\n    char s[m]; // but we need to accommodate the null terminator? Or alternatively, including it. Wait perhaps:\n\nchar s[m +1]; // to make room for the null terminator. fgets(s, m+1, stdin); // so reads up to m characters plus newline, but if the line is exactly m characters, then it will read all, then the null. Then, process each character in s:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n\n    if (s[j] == '.') { if ( (i + j) % 2 ) {\n\n            s[j] = 'W';\n\n        } else {\n\n            s[j] = 'B';\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, printf(\"%s\\n\", s); Wait but the length of s is exactly m, so when printing via %s, it will print until null. So need to make sure that s is null terminated. So after fgets, s[m] is 0 if the line is exactly m characters? Not exactly.",

Wait. Let me think: if you have m=3, the buffer size is m+1 =4. So fgets can read up to 3 characters (since the allocated buffer can take up to 3 characters plus terminator?), no, wait, the argument is the maximum number of characters to store (including the \\0). So for example, if the input is \"abcdef\" and you call fgets(s, 4), then it reads 'a','b','c', then the next character is 'd', but it stops at 3 characters to leave room for the \\0.

So that's correct here. Now, the only possible issue is the with the first row's i starting from zero. Since in C the loop starts at i =0, which is consistent with Python's for i in range(n). Thus, the code should look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, m;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m) ! = 2) {\n        // error handling, but probably not needed for this problem\n    }\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        char row[m+1]; fgets(row, m+1, stdin);\n        for(int j =0; j < m; j++) {\n            if(row[j] == '.') {\n                if( (i +j) & 1 ) {\n                    row[j] = 'W';\n                } else {\n                    row[j] = 'B';\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", row);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n} Wait, but wait for when the input has leading or trailing spaces? Let's see. The problem says it's given in the required form, so each row is exactly m characters. Thus, the code should be okay. Testing this code for an example:\n\nSuppose input:\n\n3 3\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... Then each row will be \"...\". When processed, for i=0, j=0: sum is 0, even \u2192 B. j=1: 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 W. etc. Let's see the first row (i=0):\n\nIndex 0: (0+0)=0 \u2192 B.\n\nindex1:0+1=1 \u2192 W.\n\nindex 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 B.\n\nSo row becomes 'BWB'. Yes. Second row (i=1):\n\nj=0:1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 W.\n\nj1:1+1=2 even \u2192 B.\n\nj2: 1+2=3 odd \u2192 W.\n\n'WBW'. Third row i=2:\n\nj0:2 \u2192 even \u2192 B.\n\nj1: 3 \u2192 W, etc. So third row: B W B.\n\nThus, the code should produce:\n\nBWB\n\nWBW\n\nBWB\n\nWhich is correct. Another test case: first row is 0,0 sum 0 \u2192 B.\n\nAnother case where the '.'",

The Python code is taking input, processing a grid of characters, and then printing the modified grid.\n\nHmm, the first line in Python reads two integers n and m from input. In C, I'll have to read that using scanf probably. Then, l is a list of lists. But in C, I need to handle that with a 2D array. Since C requires fixed sizes, I need to declare an array with the right dimensions. But how to get the values of n and m first?\n\nWait, maybe I can read n and m first, then allocate memory for the array. Oh right, dynamic allocation might be needed. Alternatively, since the problem probably has constraints where n and m are not too big, maybe I can use a static array? Well, probably need to read n and m first. Let's see the steps again:\n\nThe code loops n times, each time reading a string. Then, for each character in the string (of length m?), it checks if it's '.'. If so, sets it to 'W' or 'B' depending on whether i+j is odd. Then, appends the modified list to l. Finally, prints each row.\n\nIn C, I need to:\n\n1. Read n and m from input. So, first, read a line, split into two integers. Using scanf for that? Since input is probably two integers separated by space, so:\n\nint n, m;\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m);\n\nBut I need to check if there's any leading/trailing spaces, but probably scanf can handle that.\n\n2. Then, need a 2D array of characters. Since each row is a string of m characters. So declaring a 2D array of size n x m +1 (for the null terminator). Wait, each row is a string of m characters, but in C strings need a null terminator. So perhaps each row should be m+1 characters? Wait, but in the code, the Python code expects exactly m characters, so maybe in the input each row is exactly m characters long, so no need for the null terminator unless we process it as a string. Hmm, in the Python code, the input is read as a string, which is then converted into a list. In C, to process each character individually, perhaps I can read each row as a character array of exactly m characters (without null-terminator?), but that's risky. Alternatively, read it as a string which requires null terminator. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively: For each row, read m characters (but input may come with a newline). Hmm, perhaps better to use fgets to read the line, then process each character.\n\nWait, perhaps the input lines for each row are exactly m characters long, including the newline? Maybe not. The input may be like \"...\" then another line.\n\nWait, in Python, when you do input(), it reads until the end of the line, excluding the newline. So for each row, the string s is exactly m characters long? The problem may have that because the input is given such that each of the n lines has exactly m characters. So when we read each line in C, we can read exactly m characters plus the newline. So using fgets would read the line with the newline. Hmm, perhaps the first line is the dimensions, then each of n lines is m characters.\n\nTo read each line, perhaps the best way is to use fgets for each row, then process the string.\n\nBut in C, handling that.\n\nSo step by step steps:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\n- Read n and m using scanf.\n\n- Allocate an array of pointers to char, where each pointer points to an array of m+1 chars (including null). Or perhaps use a 2D array.\n\nWait, since C is row-major, perhaps a char grid[n][m] is ideal, but with variable-length arrays? Because n and m are read at runtime. In standard C99, you can have VLA. So assuming the code is written with C99, then:\n\nchar (*grid)[m];? Hmm, maybe better:\n\nchar grid[n][m];\n\nWait, declaring VLA, but need compiler support. Alternatively, dynamically allocate.\n\nAlternatively, use a 2D array with a maximum size. But perhaps the problem constraints are within desktop's memory.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, read the input with a temporary buffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Declare a 2D array char grid[n][m]; but need to make sure that the compiler supports VLA.\n\nAlternatively, since C allows variable-length arrays as an extension (even in some older compilers?), but perhaps safer code would use malloc. Let's see.\n\nLet me think: The steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nFor each of n rows:\n\n- Read the row (each has m characters), store as an array.\n\nFor each character in the row:\n\n- if it is '.' then replace with 'W' or 'B' depending on (i + j) mod 2.\n\nThen, print each row as a string.\n\nSo, steps for the C code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nInitialize a 2D array. Let me choose to use malloc:\n\nchar **grid;\ngrid = malloc(n * sizeof(char *));\nfor(i=0; i < n; i++) {\n    grid[i] = malloc( (m+1)* sizeof(char)); // because strings are null-terminated. Plus, after modifying, when we print it as a string, we need the null at the end. So each row is m characters, but allocated with m+1 space for '\\0'.\n}\n\nThen, for each row, input the characters.\n\nWait, but how to read exactly m characters? Suppose each input line is exactly m characters, then:\n\nfor (i=0; i < n; i++) {\n    fgets(grid[i], m+1, stdin); // but wait, fgets will read up to m characters, then store them with \\0, but if the line has m characters, then it can be stored. However, if there's a newline, then it would include it. Hmm. Alternatively:\n\nAlternatively, read each line with fgets into a buffer, then copy first m characters.\n\nAlternatively, read each character one by one. Hmm, perhaps the safest way is to read the entire line with fgets into a buffer, then process it character by character.\n\nWait, let's think of code structure.\n\nInitialize grid:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for each row in 0..n-1:\n\n- Read a line into a buffer.\n\n    For example:\n\nchar buffer[m+1]; but again, m is variable.\n\nWait, perhaps dynamic allocation for buffer would be required, but this is getting too complicated. Perhaps using dynamic memory for everything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are read via fgets, with each row being of exactly m characters.\n\nWait, perhaps for the first approach:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nchar **grid = malloc(n * sizeof(char *));\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n    grid[i] = malloc( (m+1) * sizeof(char));\n    fgets(grid[i], m+1, stdin);\n    // fgets will take the first m characters, but the input must have newline afterwards. But perhaps the trailing newline is in the buffer. So, after reading, we can remove it if needed. Wait, but if the line is exactly m characters long without a newline, then the input may not work. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that each input is m characters in a line.\n\nAssuming that the input lines for each row are exactly m characters, and have no trailing newline (unlikely, but perhaps the code can handle it.\n\nAlternatively, after reading, replace any newline character in the buffer's end.\n\nE.g.:\n\nfgets(buffer, ...) then set buffer[strcspn(buffer, \"\\n\")] = 0; but that would be for a buffer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, when reading each row, read m characters, then ignore the rest?\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nOnce we have the grid as an array of strings (each row being a string), then processing each character:\n\nloop over each row i (from 0 to n-1)\n\nloop over each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n\n    if grid[i][j] is '.' then:\n\n        compute (i +j) % 2: if true (1), then set to 'W', else 'B'.\n\nThen, print each row as a string.\n\nNow, in C:\n\nThe main issue will be reading the input rows properly.\n\nAlternatively, using a fixed-size buffer when reading each row.\n\nWait here's an alternative approach:\n\nAllocate a grid as:\n\nchar grid[n][m]; (using Variable Length Arrays, which may not be standard but common in practice.)\n\nThen, for each row i from 0 to n-1:\n\nRead a line into grid[i]. Here, perhaps using scanf with a %s might not work because %s reads until space or newline, but the row could have space? Probably not in this problem, since the first line has integers, the next lines have letters and '.' maybe.\n\nAlternatively using fgets, but then how?\n\nWait:\n\nfgets( (char*)grid[i], m+1, stdin ); // but grid[i] is char[m], so that may work, but not sure. Also, the string terminator.\n\nWait in C, grid[i][m] is beyond the array. So the correct way for each row is:\n\nfgets( grid[i], m+1, stdin );\n\nBut grid[i] is an array of m chars, so this would overflow. Because m+1 would need m+1 elements. So that's not correct.\n\nThus perhaps I need to use a buffer for the input line, then copy each character.\n\nE.g.:\n\nfor each row:\n\n    char s[m+1];\n    fgets(s, m+1, stdin);\n    // s now has the line, including the newline.\n\n    // remove the trailing newline.\n    s[strcspn(s, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    // then, copy each character into grid[i]?\n\nWait, but even the length may be more than m? Maybe the problem specifies that each row has exactly m characters. So if the input lines are exactly m characters plus a new line, then using s with m+1 size (including \\0) would store them okay.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the input has lines of exactly m characters, so after reading with fgets and trimming the \\n, it is okay.\n\nBut if the next input is to read exactly m characters each row, then perhaps, for each row:\n\nfor each column in 0..m-1:\n\n read from the columns. But using a loop.\n\nAlternatively, here's a better plan:\n\nInstead of using a 2D array, read each row into a character array row, and process it immediately.\n\nWait, but then the code can process it without needing a 2D array. Wait, the Python code uses a list l which appends each row after modification. But in C, perhaps after processing each row, we can directly output them? Let's see.\n\nWait in the Python code, after processing each row, it is added to list l. Then, at the end, each row in l is printed. So in C, perhaps we can process each row as we read it, so we can print it right after processing. Since there's no need to store all rows if printing immediately.\n\nOh, this would be better. So that way, we can read a row, process each char, then print it immediately. That means we don't have to store all rows, so the code can be done row-wise, which saves memory.\n\nAh, that's clever. So the C code can be done without keeping a 2D array, just process each row as it is read.\n\nAh right! This is possible. Let's restructure the code.\n\nThe algorithm in Python is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen for each of the n rows:\n\n    read the string s (length m?)\n\n    for each character in s:\n\n        if it's '.', then set to W or B.\n\n    append to l, then at the end, print all.\n\nSo if we process each row on the fly, modify it, then print it immediately, we don't need to keep all the rows. That would save memory especially for large n and m. So I can do that in C.\n\nSo steps for C:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nfor (i from 0 to n-1) {\n\n    // read a row as a string\n\n    char row[MAX_M]; ? But MAX_M is unknown since m could be up to?\n\n    Alternatively, in C, perhaps dynamically allocate each row. Or use a fixed size, but that's risky. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's read character by character.\n\nNot sure, so let's do as follows.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, for each of the n lines:\n\n    read the line as a character array of size m+1 (assuming each line is exactly m characters, plus the \\0).\n\n    process each character in the array.\n\n    then print the modified array.\n\nThus the idea is, we can process each line as we read it.\n\nSo here's how:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    char row[m]; // or m+1?\n\n    // Need to read m characters into row.\n\n    // So perhaps:\n\n    // using fgets but with buffer size of m+1:\n\n    fgets(buffer, m+1, stdin);\n\n    // then process.\n\nWait \u2014 here's maybe the better approach:\n\nWait in code, in C:\n\nWe need to read exactly m characters per input line. To avoid buffer overflows, but let's assume each line is exactly m characters.\n\nThus, for each row:\n\nchar s[m + 1]; // including null-terminator.\n\nfgets(s, m+1, stdin);\n\n// then, s has the characters, and we can truncate to m chars, but perhaps the C code can process the characters up to m.\n\nWait actually, when using fgets, it will place a null terminator at the end, so even if there's a newline in the data, but perhaps the input is properly given so that each row is exactly m characters plus a newline, so the null terminator is placed at position m.\n\nBut let's proceed: the line s will be read, and then process each character.\n\nHowever in C, arrays can't have sizes that are variable at runtime unless using VLA. So if m is a variable, then declaring a array [m] is allowed only with VLA support (as of C99).\n\nSo assuming the code can use C99.\n\nThus, inside the loop over each row:\n\n    char s[m]; // but we need to accommodate the null terminator? Or alternatively, including it.\n\nWait perhaps:\n\nchar s[m +1]; // to make room for the null terminator.\n\nfgets(s, m+1, stdin); // so reads up to m characters plus newline, but if the line is exactly m characters, then it will read all, then the null.\n\nThen, process each character in s:\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n\n    if (s[j] == '.') {\n\n        if ( (i + j) % 2 ) {\n\n            s[j] = 'W';\n\n        } else {\n\n            s[j] = 'B';\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, printf(\"%s\\n\", s);\n\nWait but the length of s is exactly m, so when printing via %s, it will print until null. So need to make sure that s is null terminated.\n\nSo after fgets, s[m] is 0 if the line is exactly m characters? Not exactly.\n\nWait, when you read with fgets(s, size, stdin), the function reads up to size-1 characters, then adds a null terminator.\n\nThus, for a line with exactly m characters (without a newline), when called as fgets(s, m+1, stdin), will read m characters, then terminate with a null. So the length is m, and s[m] is \\0.\n\nIf the line has m characters followed by a newline, then:\n\nfgets would read up to the first m+1-1 = m characters. The first m characters would be the m letters, then the newline is the m+1th, which is not read. The s has m characters (the line's data), then \\0. So proceeding is okay.\n\nThus, in all cases, processing up to m characters is safe.\n\nWait, but what if the input line is longer than m characters? The problem says that each line is exactly m characters, so it's probably okay.\n\nTherefore the code can be written with that logic.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n and m:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, m;\n\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m) != 2) {\n\n        // error handling, but maybe assume input is correct.\n\n    }\n\n    // process each row:\n\n    for (int i =0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        char s[m+1]; // m characters + null\n\n        fgets(s, m+1, stdin);\n\n        // process\n\n        for (int j=0; j < m; j++) {\n\n            if (s[j] == '.') {\n\n                if( (i + j) &1 ) { // same as mod 2, but perhaps faster.\n\n                    s[j] = 'W';\n\n                } else {\n\n                    s[j] = 'B';\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        printf(\"%s\", s); // no newline because fgets included any trailing part?\n\n        // wait, the original code's print(\"\".join(c) would print the line without a trailing newline?\n\n        // Wait, in the Python code, after processing each row in l, then l's items are printed with print(c). The print adds a new line. Because the standard print in Python adds newline. So in C, using printf(\"%s\\n\", s) would add a newline each time.\n\n        // Wait in the code:\n\n        Python's:\n\n        for c in l:\n            print(\"\".join(c))\n\n        So each row is printed with a newline between them. So in C code, the 'puts(s)' would print with a newline, but perhaps s already includes a newline from fgets?\n\n        Wait need to think about that.\n\n        Because when reading the line via fgets, if the original line ends with a newline, then s contains it. So for example, if the input has:\n\n            3 3\n\n            ...\n\n            ...\n\n            ...\n\n        Then each line will have the 3 characters followed by a newline?\n\n        Wait in Python, the input().split() on the second lines reads the entire line (including the newlines?)\n\nWait when the user enters the first line, then the next lines, each line with m characters and a newline. So when using fgets, the s will include the newline character in its string. But then after processing the characters up to m-1 (since in the code, it loops for j from 0 to m-1). For example, m =3, then for the first three characters, but if fourth is a newline, then when using the loop to j <m, that's okay. Because it processes first 3 characters (0,1,2), then the 4th character is the '\\n', which is beyond the loop.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the string being printed in C does not have a trailing newline. Because in the Python code, when joining the characters and printing, there's no newline. Because the input's line had a newline, but when the user does input().split(), the string stored in s is the line without the newline.\n\nWait in Python, the input() function reads a line from input (including the trailing newline) and returns it stripped of the trailing newline. So in the Python code, the s after input() is exactly m characters-length (as per the problem's input), because the user inputs exactly m per line.\n\nHence, in C, the fgets includes the newline, so after reading, perhaps we need to remove it.\n\nBecause in the C code, after reading, the s contains the newline as its last character (before \\0). So after modifying the m characters (the first m of the line), the s has a '\\n' at s[m-1]? Wait no.\n\nWait example: if the line is \"abc\" (no newline), then with fgets(s, m+1 (4), stdin) when m=3:\n\nthe s will be filled with 'a','b','c' followed by '\\0', so s has length 3, and the last character is 'c' (index 2). Because the 3 characters are read, then null.\n\nIf the line was \"abc\\n\" (with a newline), then fgets would read 'a','b','c', '\\n' and then stop? Wait no, because fgets would read until it gets m characters OR a newline OR EOF. So in this case, if the input is \"abc\\n\", then the line is exactly 4 characters (including the newline). So when m is 3, then executing fgets with size 4 (m+1) would read 3 characters (a, b, c, then stop before the newline? Or reads until the newline?\n\nHmm, if the line is \"abc\\n\", then the string will be stored as 'a','b','c','\\n'? No, in that case, the total characters would be 4, but the buffer can take up to 4 (including \\0), so the first three characters (a, b, c?), then the next character would be the newline, but we have buffer size of 4, so the newline can be included.\n\nWait. Let me think: if you have m=3, the buffer size is m+1 =4. So fgets can read up to 3 characters (since the allocated buffer can take up to 3 characters plus terminator?), no, wait, the argument is the maximum number of characters to store (including the \\0). So for example, if the input is \"abcdef\" and you call fgets(s, 4), then it reads 'a','b','c', then the next character is 'd', but it stops at 3 characters to leave room for the \\0. So the result is \"abc\\0\".\n\nWait, maybe in the problem statement's input, each line is exactly m characters, not including the newline. So the input for each row is m characters, followed by a newline. So when reading with fgets(s, m+1, stdin), the first m characters are the row's data (without the newline). The newline is the (m+1)th character and is not stored, except for the null.\n\nSo the line is stored in s with the first m characters as the data, then \\0. Thus, the s's content after fgets is exactly the m characters of the row (without any newline). So when processed and then printed, using printf(\"%s\", s) would print the entire string (m characters). Because the null terminator is at the end.\n\nThus, in this case, the code can proceed without needing to remove the trailing newline from the s array, since the s only contains the m characters from the row, and the newline is not part of it.\n\nWait, but only if the input lines have exactly m characters. So the idea is that each line of input (the ones after the first line) will have exactly m characters. The fgets(s, m+1, stdin) will read those m characters, then the terminating \\0.\n\nThus, the processing is correct.\n\nThus the code outline is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nfor each row in 0..n-1:\n\n    read s into a buffer of m+1 chars via fgets.\n\n    process each character in the first m characters:\n\n        if it's '.', then replace with B/W as per (i+j) even or odd.\n\n    then print the buffer s (without newline, but as the s already has m characters with no \\n, the %s will print until null, so that's fine.\n\nWait but the original Python code does print each line of the grid with newlines between them, since each c in l is printed with print, which adds a newline. So in C, the code must also print each row followed by a newline. Since the processing in Python's code, the input lines had newlines, and the output does not keep them. Because in the Python code, the s variable does not have the newline (input().split() scraps the newline). So the Python's print(c) adds a newline after each row.\n\nThus, in the C code, the printf should output the string s, followed by a newline. But when we process s, it contains the characters exactly of the row. So when printing, add a \\n. So the correct printf would be:\n\nprintf(\"%s\\n\", s);\n\nSince the s itself is exactly the characters without a newline. So adding \\n gives the same as Python's print behavior.\n\nWait in Python:\n\nFor example, if the row is 'ABC', the s after input is 'ABC'. Then, when printed via print(s), you get 'ABC'+ newline.\n\nThus in C code, the line should have the newline added by printf(\"%s\\n\".\n\nSo, with that correction:\n\nYes, in the C loop:\n\nprintf(\"%s\\n\", s); \n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, also need to process the (i + j) whether it's even or odd. The Python code uses (i +j) &1 to check if the sum is odd (because the bitwise AND with 1 gives the least significant bit, which is 1 for odd numbers). So that's correct here.\n\nNow, the only possible issue is the with the first row's i starting from zero. Since in C the loop starts at i =0, which is consistent with Python's for i in range(n).\n\nThus, the code should look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, m;\n    if(scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &m) != 2) {\n        // error handling, but probably not needed for this problem\n    }\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        char row[m+1];\n        fgets(row, m+1, stdin);\n        for(int j =0; j < m; j++) {\n            if(row[j] == '.') {\n                if( (i +j) & 1 ) {\n                    row[j] = 'W';\n                } else {\n                    row[j] = 'B';\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", row);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but wait for when the input has leading or trailing spaces? Let's see. The problem says it's given in the required form, so each row is exactly m characters. Thus, the code should be okay.\n\nTesting this code for an example:\n\nSuppose input:\n\n3 3\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThen each row will be \"...\". When processed, for i=0, j=0: sum is 0, even \u2192 B. j=1: 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 W. etc.\n\nLet's see the first row (i=0):\n\nIndex 0: (0+0)=0 \u2192 B.\n\nindex1:0+1=1 \u2192 W.\n\nindex 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 B.\n\nSo row becomes 'BWB'.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond row (i=1):\n\nj=0:1+0=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 W.\n\nj1:1+1=2 even \u2192 B.\n\nj2: 1+2=3 odd \u2192 W.\n\n'WBW'.\n\nThird row i=2:\n\nj0:2 \u2192 even \u2192 B.\n\nj1: 3 \u2192 W, etc.\n\nSo third row: B W B.\n\nThus, the code should produce:\n\nBWB\n\nWBW\n\nBWB\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first row is 0,0 sum 0 \u2192 B.\n\nAnother case where the '.' is not present, so nothing changes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nBut need to consider when there is a newline in the input. For example, if the first input line is \"3 3 \" (with a trailing space?), but that's handled by scanf which stops at space.\n\nThe n and m are correctly read.\n\nThus, I think this code is correct."
