Wait, using malloc is necessary because N is dynamic.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code is doing. \n\nFirst, the Python code reads an integer N, then an array A of N integers. Then it initializes mn and mx to N+1 and -1, respectively. Then it loops over each index i from 0 to N-1. If the element at A[i] is not equal to i+1, it updates mn to be the minimum of mn and i, and mx to be the maximum of mx and i. \n\nAfter processing all elements, if mx remains -1, which means all elements were correct, it prints \"0 0\". Otherwise, it creates a new array by reversing the subarray from mn to mx (inclusive?), then checks if this new array is sorted. Depending on that, it prints mn+1 and mx+1 or '0 0'.\n\nHmm, the key steps here are: finding the leftmost and rightmost indices where elements aren't in the correct position, then reversing that subsegment and checking if the entire array becomes sorted. The output is the 1-based indices of those positions if it works, else 0 0.\n\nNow to translate this into C. Let's think about how to handle arrays in C.\n\nFirst, variables: in C, we need to dynamically allocate the array, since the size N is determined at runtime. Wait, but in C, you can also declare a fixed-size array, but we might not know the size upfront. Hmm, but since in Python the code works for any N, perhaps the user code must read N first, then read the array of N elements. \n\nAlternatively, in C, we can read N first, then allocate an array of size N. That's the way to go. So steps:\n\nRead N via scanf. Then create an array A of size N. Read the N integers from the second line. \n\nThen find mn and mx as in Python. Wait, in Python, the indices start at 0, so A[i] is the i-th element. The condition is if (i+1 != A[i]). Wait, so the correct value at position i (0-based) is i + 1. So the correct array would be [1,2,...,N]. So in the code, they are looking for the first and last positions where this isn't the case. \n\nmn starts at N+1, which is higher than any possible index, so the first time any discrepancy is found, mn will become the index. mx starts at -1, so whenever a discrepancy is found, it's updated to the maximum. \n\nAfter that, if mx is -1, output 0 0. Otherwise, they reverse the subarray from mn to mx, then check if the new array is sorted. If yes, output mn+1 and mx+1 (since it's 1-based).\n\nWait in the Python code, A = A[: mn] + A[mn: (mx+1)][::-1] + A[(mx +1):]\n\nSo between mn and mx (inclusive?), the subarray from mn to mx (the latter being up to mx+1?), reversed. But in Python slicing, A[mn: mx+1] includes starting at mn, up to but not including mx+1, so gives from mn to mx inclusive. The [::-1] reverses this. So the reversed subarray replaces that part. \n\nThen the new array is checked if it's sorted (as per sorted(A)). If yes, then the indices mn+1 and mx+1 are printed. \n\nSo in C, replicating this process. \n\nFirst, need to do the same steps.\n\nLet me outline the steps for C:\n\n1. Read N, allocate array A of size N.\n\n2. Read N elements into A.\n\n3. Initialize min_pos as N (since mn in Python starts at N+1, so perhaps here we can start as N to make indices easier. Or perhaps initializing to N would be off by one? Wait in code:\n\nWait the original variables in Python: mn is assigned as minimum between N+1 and i. So initial value is N+1. Since indices are 0-based up to N-1, N+1 is higher than any possible index. \n\nSimilarly, mx starts at -1, so the first time you hit a problem (i), mx will become i.\n\nThen after processing all elements, if mx remains -1, no problem, output 0 0.\n\nSo in C variables:\n\nint mn = N + 1;\n\nint mx = -1;\n\nWait since C's indices are 0-based. So yes. So in C:\n\nStart with mn = N +1 (since N could be up to ... like max input size, whatever). \n\nThen for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\nCheck if (i+1) != A[i]\n\nWait, in Python, A is the list, so A[i] is the value. The correct value should have been i+1. \n\nSo in C: \n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n    if ( (i+1) != A[i] ) {\n\n        if (i < mn) mn = i;\n\n        if (i > mx) mx = i;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait because mn is the minimal index where it's wrong, and mx is the maximum index where it's wrong.\n\nSo yes, exactly that.\n\nThen if mx is == -1, then print 0 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to take the subarray from mn to mx inclusive, reverse it, and see if the resulting array is sorted. If yes, then output mn+1 and mx+1, else 0 0.\n\nBut the problem is, in C, how to create a copy of the modified array? Because modifying the original array is not needed, but in the code's logic, the original array is reversed in that portion and then checked. So we can make a copy, manipulate it, then check.\n\nSo in C, perhaps make a copy of the array, reverse from mn to mx, then check if that new array is sorted.\n\nWait the original array remains the same, and the new array is modified. \n\nYes. So in C:\n\nFirst make a copy of the array. But since in C, it's easy to create a new array.\n\nWait the code in Python is:\n\nA = A[: mn] + A[mn: (mx +1)][::-1] + A[mx +1 : ]\n\nSo in code, the reversed subarray is from mn to mx (since the slice mn:mx+1 gives up to but not including mx+1, so that's the indices mn to mx). \n\nThus in the copy, the subarray from index mn to mx (inclusive) is reversed.\n\nTherefore, in C, copy the original array into a temp array, then reverse the mn to mx portion.\n\nThen check whether the temp array is sorted.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n- After finding mn and mx:\n\nif (mx == -1) { printf(\"0 0\"); etc }\n\nelse {\n\n    // create a copy array and reverse the part from mn to mx.\n\n    // allocate another array or declare a new array?\n\n    // in C, for arrays of N elements, size should be N.\n\n    int temp[N]; \n\n    for(int a=0; a<N; a++) temp[a] = A[a]; \n\n    // reverse from mn to mx:\n\n    int start = mn, end = mx;\n\n    while (start < end) {\n\n        int swapVal = temp[start];\n\n        temp[start] = temp[end];\n\n        temp[end] = swapVal;\n\n        start++;\n\n        end--;\n\n    }\n\n    // then check if temp is sorted.\n\n    bool isSorted = true;\n\n    for(int i=1; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (temp[i] != temp[i-1]+1) { // since the correct is 1,2,... so each element is previous +1\n\n            isSorted = false;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (isSorted) {\n\n        printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1); \n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"0 0\\n\"); \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, this seems okay, but let me think.\n\nBecause the sorted array must be exactly from 1 to N in order. So each element must be exactly previous +1.\n\nAlternatively, in the original correct array, after reversal, the temp must be increasing and all correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a better way is to check if temp is sorted by comparing each next element.\n\nWait but perhaps the elements start from 1 and go up by 1. So each position's element is i+1. So temp[i] should equal i+1.\n\nYes. Wait the original problem says the correct array has elements equal to their position (1-based), so if after the reversal, the array is correct, each element must be equal to its 1-based position. Therefore, it's sufficient to check:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<N; i++){\n\n    if(temp[i] != i+1){\n\n        isSorted = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHmm, that might be simpler. So perhaps that's better. \n\nYes, because even if the array is sorted in increasing order, it's possible that the values are not starting at 1. Wait in the input, the array might not have unique numbers? The problem says nothing about that, but perhaps the input is correct except for the current arrangement. Well according to the problem logic, the code is trying to reverse a segment so that it becomes the correct array. So after reversal, it must exactly match the correct array (1 to N in order). So checking each element against its position +1 would be better.\n\nSo the code can use that approach.\n\nNow, the rest is to handle the code structure.\n\nStarting with the main function.\n\nFirst read N:\n\nBut in C, need to read from stdin. So code:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int N;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\n    // allocate the array.\n\n    int *A = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\n    for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n\n    }\n\n    // compute mn and mx.\n\n    int mn = N+1; \n\n    int mx = -1;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if( A[i] != (i +1) ) {\n\n            if( i < mn ) mn =i;\n\n            if( i> mx ) mx= i;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // proceed.\n\n    if (mx == -1) {\n\n        printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n        free(A);\n\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    // else, need to make temp array.\n\n    int *temp = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\n    memcpy(temp, A, N * sizeof(int));\n\n    // reverse from mn to mx.\n\n    int start = mn;\n\n    int end = mx;\n\n    while (start < end) {\n\n        int t = temp[start];\n\n        temp[start] = temp[end];\n\n        temp[end] = t;\n\n        start++;\n\n        end--;\n\n    }\n\n    // check temp is sorted as correct.\n\n    bool sorted = true;\n\n    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n        if (temp[i] != i+1) {\n\n            sorted = false;\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    if (sorted) {\n\n        printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mn+1, mx+1);\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"0 0\\n\");\n\n    }\n\n    free(A);\n\n    free(temp);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait wait, wait. Wait, using malloc is necessary because N is dynamic. However, perhaps in some cases, the code can be optimized by using arrays instead, but since N can be up to very big (like 1e5?), but in C, variable length arrays are allowed in C99 with -std=c99 or similar. But if the problem requires standard C89, then malloc is needed. Since the problem didn't specify, but the assistant is supposed to write standard C code. \n\nWait but in C89, variable-length arrays aren't allowed, so the above code uses malloc which is portable. Let me see. Alternatively, if the problem uses VLA, then you can write like:\n\nint temp[N]; \n\nand same for A. However, that's only in C99. \n\nThe code as written using pointers and malloc would be compatible with C89 as well, which might be better for portability. So the code above is okay. \n\nBut let me check the steps again. \n\nWait in the code I wrote, after allocating A, each element is read. The mn and mx are calculated correctly. \n\nThen, when creating the temp array: \n\ntemp is a copy of A. Because the loop for i<N: temp[i] =A[i], but using memcpy is better, as I did in code.\n\nThen reverse between start and end (mn to mx). Since start is initially set to mn and end to mx. \n\nThen check each element. \n\nWait the code should print mn+1 and mx+1 since the question expects 1-based indices. So in the end, that's correct.\n\nPossible edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: when everything is already correct. Then mx is -1, so output 0 0.\n\nAnother case where after reversing that segment, the array becomes correct. So for example:\n\nSuppose N=3, input [1,3,2]. Then:\n\nWe check each element: \n\nindex 0: A[0]=1 == 0+1 \u2192 okay.\n\nindex 1: 3 !=2 \u2192 so mn=min(4+, 1) \u2192 1. mx becomes 1.\n\nindex 2:2 != 3 \u2192 mn is still 1 (since 2 is not smaller than 1), mx becomes 2. \n\nSo mn=1, mx=2. \n\nThen the reversed segment from 1 to 2 (indices) will reverse [3,2] to [2,3]. \n\nThe new array will be [1,2,3], which is correct. So output is 2 and 3 (since 1-based).\n\nWhich would be correct. \n\nAnother case where the reversal isn't sufficient. Like N=4, input [3,2,1,4].\n\nOriginal array: 3 vs 1 \u2192 not OK, mn becomes 0, mx becomes0. \n\nIndex 1: 2 vs2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo, no? Wait, sorry the current array: A is [3,2,1,4]. Let me see step by step:\n\nFor each element:\n\nindex0: 3 !=i+1=1 \u2192 so mn is set to 0, mx=0. \n\nindex1:2 == 2 \u2192 ok. \n\nindex2:1!=3 \u2192 so mn is still min(0,2 \u2192 0). mx becomes max(0,2 \u21922). \n\nindex3:4==4 \u2192 ok. \n\nSo the mn is 0 and mx is 2. \n\nThe reversed subarray from 0 to 2 becomes [1,2,3]. \n\nThe new temp array is [1,2,3,4]. Which is correct. So output 1,3 (which are 0+1 and 2+1). \n\nAnother case where after reversal it doesn't work. For example, array [2,1]. \n\nHere mn is 0 and mx is 1. Reversing 0-1 gives [1,2], which is sorted, so output 1 and 2.\n\nWait correct. \n\nAnother example: [1,3,2,4]. \n\nSo the bad elements are at 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2). mn is 1, mx is 2. Reverse the subarray: becomes [1,2,3,4]. So sorted, hence output 2 and 3. \n\nAll these seem correct. \n\nPotential error points in my code:\n\n- Did I compute the mn and mx correctly?\n\nYes. The code says:\n\n if (A[i] != i+1), then update mn to min and mx to max. So exactly as Python code.\n\n- Reversing the correct section in temp.\n\nYes: from mn to mx (the indices), inclusive. The loop continues until start < end. \n\nChecking the sortedness by each element must be i+1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nIn Python, the code after reversing, checks if A (after modification) is equal to sorted(A). But in the problem's requirement, the correct array is sorted. So if after reversing, the array becomes the correct one (equal to 1, 2, ..., N), then it's considered correct. So in C, that's the way.\n\nI think the C code is correct. But let me check possible errors.\n\nAnother point: in the code when using memcpy, because in C, you have to copy the data correctly. So:\n\nint *temp = malloc(...) \n\nthen \n\nmemcpy(temp, A, N * sizeof(int));\n\nYes.\n\nFreeing both pointers after use is important.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, with that, the code should be correct."
