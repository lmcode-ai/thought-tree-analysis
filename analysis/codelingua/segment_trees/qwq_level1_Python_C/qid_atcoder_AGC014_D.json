But since in the code, the edges are read as N-1 edges. So we can first read the N, then read N-1 edges. Wait, the code reads N = int(input()), then N-1 edges. So in the C code, first read N, then read N-1 lines of a and b. So approach:\n\nRead N, then create an array to store edge counts for each node first. Then allocate arrays for each adjacency node's list. Let's see code steps:\n\nFirst in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    // Initialize adjacency counts:\n\n    int degrees[N+1]; // nodes 1-based\n    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) degrees[i] =0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i<N-1; i++){\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\",&a, &b);\n        degrees[a]++;\n        degrees[b]++;\n    }\n\n    // Now allocate adjacency lists:\n    int **adj = (int **)malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(int*) ); // Adj array for node 1 to N\n    for(int i=0; i<=N; i++){\n        if(i ==0){\n            adj[i] = NULL; // assume node 0 unused\n            continue;\n        }\n        adj[i] = (int*)malloc( degrees[i]* sizeof(int));\n        degrees[i] =0; // reset to store count\n    }\n\n    // Now read again edges and store in adj's lists:\n    if(i need to read the edges again? Wait that's no good. So this approach needs to read the edges twice. Not good. So probably not the best way. Hmm. So the approach of counting first and re-reading again would be a problem. Alternative idea: read all edges into an intermediate array first, then process them. So in C:\n\nFirst read all edges into a temporary storage, say, an array of N-1 edges:\n\nstruct Edge {int a, b;};\nEdge edges[N-1]; \n\nBut in C, since the N is known only at runtime, allocating this as a dynamic array is better, but for code efficiency, perhaps with stack space. Anyway, for C code: Alternatively, in code: Read N, then store N-1 edges into arrays of a and b.\n\nint edge_count = N-1;\nstruct Edge *edges = malloc(edge_count * sizeof(struct Edge));\nfor (int i=0; i < edge_count; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &(edges[i].a), &(edges[i].b));\n}\n\nThen, count the degrees again from these edges to determine the adjacency array sizes. Then, it's doable. Yes. That's better. Once the adjacency lists are set, then code proceeds similarly. Alright, so first, setting up adjacency lists. Now, the BFS part.",

Thus in Python, when c is node1, the code would have:\n\npar[c] = 0, then the grandparent is par[0], which is 0. Thus child_num[0] -=1 would be performed (but since the first node's parent is 0, and its parent's parent is also zero, but child_num[0] is initially zero, so subtracting would get to -1, then when that next node is considered (but it is zero).",

Further minor notes:\n\nIn the code, the sequence stack (seq_stack) can be allocated as:\n\nint *seq_stack = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nthen the maximum elements stored would be N in the worst case (for N nodes that are ~a chain and being processed in reverse).

For N=1, the code:\n\nedges pointer is allocated to zero elements? Because:\n\nnum_edges =0, so edges = malloc(0 * struct Edge) \u2192 possibly returning NULL or error, but in practice may be allowed. But to avoid, use an if condition:\n\nif(N ==1){\n\n   // handle case where no edges.\n\n} But the code may still work:\n\nWhen N is 1, in the edges processing loop, the for loop for reading edges is skipped. Then for the adj initialization:\n\ndegrees array for node1 is zero (since no edges), so adj[1] is set to a zero-size array. Which is okay. Even empty adj arrays for node1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Python code into C. Let me first understand what the Python code does. \n\nLooking at the Python code:\n\n- It reads N, which is the number of nodes in a tree (since it's N-1 edges).\n- Builds an adjacency list for the tree.\n- Then performs a BFS starting from node 1 to find the parent (par) of each node and count the number of children (child_num) each node has.\n- After setting up those arrays, it uses a sequence (a deque) that starts with all leaves (nodes with zero children).\n- Then enters a loop where it pops a node from the sequence. It sets its seen flag to 0 (marking it as processed?) and then checks the parent. If the parent's seen is zero, it prints \"First\" and exits. Then, it marks the parent as unseen again and decrements the child count of the grandparent. If the grandparent's child count reaches zero, it's added to the sequence.\n\nHmm, this seems like some sort of game where players take turns removing leaves, and the player who can't move loses. The code might determine if the first player can win based on some parity condition or the structure of the tree.\n\nNow, translating this into C requires thinking about data structures in C. Let's break down each part.\n\nFirst, input handling. In Python, they use sys.stdin.buffer.readline for speed, probably since it's expecting large input. In C, we can use scanf, but maybe better with faster methods. Let me just code with scanf and see how to parse integers.\n\nThe adjacency list is a list of lists. In C, since we can't have dynamic lists, perhaps use an adjacency list as a dynamic array. Alternatively, since it's a tree, the maximum number of edges is N-1. So maybe we can pre-allocate arrays for adjacency lists. Wait, no, each node's adjacency list can have varying sizes. \n\nAlternatively, we can pre-allocate an array for all edges, and then track the number of entries for each node. Let's see. Let's see what's the maximum required size. For a tree with N nodes, each node at most can have up to N-1 edges, but in practice, in such a problem, maybe the maximum number per node is manageable. \n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to use a linked list or dynamic arrays. But in C, dynamic arrays are a bit tedious. Alternatively, since the adjacency list is a list for each node's connections, perhaps we can use arrays for adjacency nodes, using adjacency lists with a maximum possible size. Since the nodes are up to N, and each node's edges can be up to N (though for a tree, it's at most N-1), but in any case, the edges are N-1 edges total. \n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Read N. Since adjacency lists, for each node, the adjacency lists can be stored in an array of arrays. But in C, perhaps use an array of pointers. Each node's list points to an array of integers. We can manage it with dynamic allocation:\n\nWait, perhaps in C, the best way is:\n\n- For node a, have an adjacency list with \"adj\" storing pointers to arrays, with \"adj_size\" for each node's current size and \"adj_cap\" for capacity, but this might be too complex.\n\nAlternative approach: since the problem is about trees with N nodes, maybe we can precompute the maximum possible edges per node. Because in a tree, the root can have N-1 children (if the tree is a star), so the maximum adjacency array size for any node would be N-1. But that's a lot of memory for large N. Hmm. Maybe better to read all edges first, count their neighbors, and then reallocate appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume the maximum number of adjacent nodes a single node can have is, say, 2e5. But perhaps, this is manageable.\n\nWait, but in the code, adjacency list is built using for each edge (a,b), add both directions. So for each edge, add to a's list, and to b's list. So for each node's adjacency list, the size is equal to the degree of that node. The maximum possible degree is O(N), but in practice, probably we can manage with dynamically allocated arrays.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of C's standard approach for adjacency lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a adjacency list stored as a linked list? But that may be complicated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since in the Python code, after the BFS, we process the child numbers etc. Maybe another approach in C:\n\nFirst, to read the edges:\n\nWe can make an array of structures storing each adjacency list. For each node, we can have a pointer to an array of integers (adjacency list) and the current size.\n\nAlternatively, first, since we are only building the adjacency list, we can first count the size needed for each adjacency list, then allocate it.\n\nSo, here's the plan steps:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Determine for each adjacency list how many edges there are. To do that, first do a pass through all edges, count the number of edges per node. Then allocate the arrays with those counts.\n\nYes. So:\n\n- First, read all edges, count them. To do that, first read all edges, note that N is known from the first input. But since in the code, the edges are read as N-1 edges. So we can first read the N, then read N-1 edges. \n\nWait, the code reads N = int(input()), then N-1 edges. So in the C code, first read N, then read N-1 lines of a and b. \n\nSo approach:\n\nRead N, then create an array to store edge counts for each node first. Then allocate arrays for each adjacency node's list.\n\nLet's see code steps:\n\nFirst in C:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    // Initialize adjacency counts:\n\n    int degrees[N+1]; // nodes 1-based\n    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) degrees[i] =0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i<N-1; i++){\n        int a, b;\n        scanf(\"%d %d\",&a, &b);\n        degrees[a]++;\n        degrees[b]++;\n    }\n\n    // Now allocate adjacency lists:\n    int **adj = (int **)malloc( (N+1)*sizeof(int*) ); // Adj array for node 1 to N\n    for(int i=0; i<=N; i++){\n        if(i ==0){\n            adj[i] = NULL; // assume node 0 unused\n            continue;\n        }\n        adj[i] = (int*)malloc( degrees[i]* sizeof(int));\n        degrees[i] =0; // reset to store count\n    }\n\n    // Now read again edges and store in adj's lists:\n    if(i need to read the edges again? Wait that's no good. So this approach needs to read the edges twice. Not good. So probably not the best way. \n\nHmm. So the approach of counting first and re-reading again would be a problem.\n\nAlternative idea: read all edges into an intermediate array first, then process them.\n\nSo in C:\n\nFirst read all edges into a temporary storage, say, an array of N-1 edges:\n\nstruct Edge {int a, b;};\nEdge edges[N-1]; \n\nBut in C, since the N is known only at runtime, allocating this as a dynamic array is better, but for code efficiency, perhaps with stack space. Anyway, for C code:\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nRead N, then store N-1 edges into arrays of a and b.\n\nint edge_count = N-1;\nstruct Edge *edges = malloc(edge_count * sizeof(struct Edge));\nfor (int i=0; i < edge_count; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &(edges[i].a), &(edges[i].b));\n}\n\nThen, count the degrees again from these edges to determine the adjacency array sizes.\n\nThen, it's doable. \n\nYes. That's better. \n\nOnce the adjacency lists are set, then code proceeds similarly. \n\nAlright, so first, setting up adjacency lists.\n\nNow, the BFS part.\n\nIn Python, they use a deque, but in C, we have to implement our own queue. Or use an array as a queue.\n\nThe BFS queue here is implemented with deque, so it's a FIFO queue, so in C, perhaps an array as a queue. Let's see:\n\nImplementing the BFS:\n\n- Initialize the queue with node 1.\n\nNeed to track:\n\nseen: array of N+1, initialized to 0 (unvisited), and set to 1 when visited.\n\npar array, which tracks parent.\n\nchild_num: counts how many children each node has (but in the BFS approach, maybe it's the number of children in the traversal? Or the number of children in the tree, irrespective of direction?)\n\nWait, looking back to code:\n\nIn the Python code, during BFS, for each child, it checks if it's unvisited, then sets par[u] = v. So the parent array is built such that for each node u (except root 1), the parent is the first node visited which discovers it, which makes it a BFS tree parent.\n\nThen, for each node v, child_num[v] +=1 for each u that's discovered from v. So it is the count of children in the BFS tree (i.e., the number of children each node has in the BFS tree, excluding the parent direction).\n\nThe child_num will then be the number of children each node has in the tree, in the way the parent pointers are set. \n\nDuring the BFS, the child_num array is built as the number of children each node has, except the parent. \n\nWait, but the adjacency list has all edges, both directions. So when processing node v's adjacent nodes, it has to exclude those already visited. \n\nHmm, okay. So in the BFS, when we visit v, we look at all its adjacent nodes. For each u in adj[v], if u is not visited yet, then u becomes a child of v (par[u] =v), and we increment the child_num[v].\n\nTherefore, child_num[v] is indeed the number of actual direct children in the tree structure.\n\nSo after building the adjacency list, we need to perform BFS from node 1.\n\nIn the code:\n\nInitialize a queue (queue starts with node 1), with seen[1] set to 1.\n\nThen, while the queue is not empty:\n\n- Remove the first item v from the queue.\n\n- For each neighbor u in adj[v]:\n\n    if not seen[u], then mark it as seen, set parent, set child_num[v] +=1, add to queue.\n\nWait, in the Python code, the que is a deque and they popleft (FIFO, so queue). So yes, standard BFS.\n\nIn C, to implement a queue, perhaps using an array with indices for front and rear.\n\nAlternatively, use linked list. But let's try using an array.\n\nDefine:\n\nint queue[N+1]; // sufficient since nodes are up to N. \n\nint front =0, back=0.\n\nEnqueue: void enqueue(int v) { queue[back++] = v; }\n\nDequeue: int dequeue() { return queue[front++]; }\n\nThen, the initial step:\n\nInitialize queue with 1. \n\nint queueSize = 0;\n\nWait perhaps:\n\nInitialization:\n\nfront = 0;\n\nback =0;\n\nenqueue(1):\n\nqueue[back++] =1;\n\nthen while front < back, process.\n\nHmm. Also need to be careful of overflow (when back reaches array capacity). Since max queue size is N, the array size N+1 should be enough.\n\nSo:\n\nint queue[N+1], front=0, back=0;\n\nThen, enqueue(1):\n\nqueue[back++] =1;\n\nseen[1] =1;\n\nThen, while back != front:\n\nv = queue[front];\n\nfront ++;\n\nWait perhaps the code will be:\n\nwhile(front < back){\n\n    v = queue[front]; \n\n    front++;\n\n    for each u in adj[v]...\n\nBut, need to loop through each adjacent node:\n\n    for each u in adj[v]'s list (the list is the array stored for each node):\n\nWait, but to loop through all adjacent nodes of v:\n\nthe adj[v] has their count stored either via the degree array or via the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, since each adjacency list has a size, defined in the edges step. Wait, in the initial step when we allocated the adjacency lists, we have for each node i, the adj[i] points to an array of size known (degrees[i] from the first pass).\n\nWait when we counted the degrees via the edges initially, that variable's count is the number of adjacent nodes. \n\nWait, when building the adjacency list, for each edge (a,b), we add both a in b's adjacency and b in a's adjacency. So degrees have been set appropriately. \n\nWait in the struct Edge, the edges array stores all edges. So after allocating adj, and degrees array was initially used to count the adjacency list lengths, so adj[i] arrays each are of size degrees[i].\n\nThen, in the code, for each edge a and b, after allocating the adjacency arrays, we can traverse them again via the edges array and add to the adj lists. \n\nWait I think here is the plan:\n\nAfter getting the edges into an array of struct Edge:\n\nInitialize the adjacency array as follows:\n\nfor all nodes, their adjacency list is size degrees[i]. \n\nThen, for each edge, append to adj[a], and to adj[b]. Since initially, the degree counts gave us exactly the required space for each.\n\nWait, the counting method won't work as explained before without reading all edges twice, so perhaps the code structure is:\n\nRead all edges into a temporary array.\n\nThen, for each edge, first count the number of edges for each node, so to allocate the adjacency list.\n\nThen, allocate each adjacency list with that size.\n\nThen, using the edges array again, fill the adjacency lists.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code can:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N-1 edges into an array.\n\n3. Count the degrees for each node (as a count for each node's edges).\n\n4. Allocate for each node's adjacency list array.\n\n5. Re-iterate over the edges and fill each node's adjacency lists.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, C code steps:\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step translating.\n\nData structures and variables:\n\n- adjacency list: array of pointers to arrays.\n\n- seen array of size N+1.\n\n- par array.\n\n- child_num array.\n\n- queues for BFS.\n\nLet's start with the C code outline.\n\nFirst, include headers:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nDefine a struct for edges.\n\nstruct Edge {\n    int a, b;\n};\n\nThen:\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    \n    if (N ==0 ) { // not possible per input, but handle if anyway.\n        // handling?\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    // Read edges:\n    int num_edges = N-1;\n    // Check N-1 >=0 (valid trees have N>=1)\n    struct Edge *edges = malloc( num_edges * sizeof(struct Edge) );\n    for(int i =0; i < num_edges; i++){\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &edges[i].a, &edges[i].b );\n    }\n    \n    // Now compute degrees:\n    int max_node = N; // nodes are up to N.\n    int degrees[N+1]; // assuming nodes are 1-based to N.\n    // initialize to 0\n    for (int i=0; i<= N; i++) degrees[i] = 0;\n    for( int i=0; i< num_edges; i++){\n        degrees[ edges[i].a ]++;\n        degrees[ edges[i].b ]++;\n    }\n    \n    // allocate adjacency lists:\n    int **adj = malloc( (N+1)* sizeof(int*) );\n    // for each node i from 1 to N:\n    for(int i=0; i <= N; i++) {\n        if( i ==0 ){\n            // node 0 may not exist, skip\n            adj[i] = NULL;\n        } else {\n            adj[i] = malloc( degrees[i]* sizeof(int) );\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // now store the edges into adj lists. \n    // first reset degrees[i] to 0, as a way to track current index for adjacency lists.\n    for(int i=0; i<= N; i++) degrees[i]=0;\n    \n    for(int i=0; i < num_edges; i++) {\n        struct Edge e = edges[i];\n        // add e.b to adj[e.a]\n        adj[e.a][ degrees[e.a] ] = e.b;\n        degrees[e.a]++;\n        // add e.a to adj[e.b]\n        adj[e.b][ degrees[e.b] ] = e.a;\n        degrees[e.b]++;\n    }\n    // free the edges array here, maybe? But not necessary now.\n    \n    // Now, BFS setup:\n    // variables needed:\n    int seen[N+1] = {0}; // all 0 initially.\n    int par[N+1] = {0};\n    int child_num[N+1]={0};\n    \n    // Using array as a queue for BFS:\n    int bfs_queue[N+1];\n    int front =0, back=0;\n    \n    // Enqueue first node 1:\n    seen[1] =1;\n    bfs_queue[back++] =1;\n    \n    while( front < back ){\n        int v = bfs_queue[front++];\n        // Check all adjacent nodes:\n        int v_degree = degrees[v];\n        for( int k=0; k < v_degree; k++ ){\n            int u = adj[v][k];\n            if ( seen[u] ==0 ){\n                seen[u] =1;\n                par[u] =v;\n                child_num[v] ++; // increment the parent's child count\n                bfs_queue[ back++ ] = u;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Now, the second part: Processing the sequences.\n    // Need another queue? The code in Python loops through leaves first.\n    // The next part in Python:\n\n    // Initialize a sequence deque, which starts with nodes where child_num[i] is 0 (leaves)\n    // Since all leaves (nodes with child_num[i]=0) are added to seq first.\n    // But in code first loop adds to seq all i with child_num[i]==0?\n    \n    // So in C, create another queue (array) for this.\n    // sequence is a deque but in code used as a stack (since they pop from end, with .append and .pop)\n    // Wait in Python, the code uses .pop() which pops from the end (so LIFO), but since append is also at the end, so acts as a stack.\n    // So the sequence is a stack structure. Because seq is initialized with leaves (appending new leaves at the end), then later the code pops from the end, so the last element added first.\n\n    // So the sequence is a stack. So in C, to use a stack, perhaps a dynamic array? Or use a standard array with tracking.\n\n    // Let me think of an array stack and manage top index.\n    \n    int stack_size = N;\n    int *seq_stack = malloc( (N)* sizeof(int) );\n    int top =0;\n    \n    // Initialize with leaves (child_num[i] ==0).\n    for (int i=1; i<= N; i++){\n        if ( child_num[i] ==0 ){\n            seq_stack[top++] =i;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Then loop while the stack is not empty:\n    while( top >0 ){\n        // pop the last element:\n        int c = seq_stack[--top];\n        seen[c]=0; // resetting seen or using another array? Wait in code, the second part uses the 'seen' array again.\n        \n        // Check parent's seen:\n        int p = par[c]; \n        if( seen[p] ==0 ){\n            printf(\"First\\n\");\n            free(edges); // need to free memory?\n            free( adj[0] ); // but adj[0] was Null. for i from 1 to N, free each adj[i]\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        seen[p] =0;\n        \n        // The parent of p (grandparent) is par[p].\n        int gp = par[p];\n        child_num[ gp ] --;\n        if ( child_num[ gp ] ==0 ){\n            seq_stack[top++] = gp;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // After processing all:\n    printf(\"Second\\n\");\n    \n    // Free all allocated memory for adj.\n    for(int i=0; i<=N; i++){\n        if( adj[i] != NULL )\n            free(adj[i]);\n    }\n    free(adj);\n    free(edges);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in the BFS processing code above, there might be an error in how adj lists are indexed. Let me check:\n\nThe adj[v] is an array of size degrees[v], which was filled by the loop that stores each edge into adj[v].\n\nBecause, the degrees array was first used to count degrees, to allocate the arrays.\n\nWait for node v, the adjacency list adj[v] is an array of length degrees[v].\n\nBut when adding the edges, in the code: for each edge, added e.b to adj[e.a], and tracked using degrees as a counter. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, step by step, the code below this point.\n\nAfter allocating adj[i] arrays with size degrees[i], since degrees was computed as the sum of edges from edges.\n\nThen, the code loops over all edges again, and for each a and b:\n\nadj[e.a] [degrees[e.a]] = e.b; then degrees[e.a] is increased. But before that, after the degree counts, but we reset degrees to 0?\n\nWait in code:\n\nAfter allocating, we set degrees[i]=0 (so the for loop after allocating runs for i from 0 to N:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<= N; i++) degrees[i]=0;\n\nSo when filling the adj arrays, the variables degrees are being used to track the current index. So for each edge e.a and e.b:\n\nThe first part for edge a,b:\n\nAdd b to the adj of a:\n\nadj[a][degrees[a]] = b --> but degrees[a] starts at 0.\n\nSame for the others.\n\nWait, for edge a <-> b:\n\nfirst add e.b (which is b) to adj[a], then degrees[a] is incremented. So now the next position in adj[a] will be the next index.\n\nThen, add a to adj[b], then degrees[b] is incremented.\n\nAfter all edges are processed, each adj[i] array contains all adjacent nodes, with length of original degree count. \n\nSo that is correct.\n\nHmm, good.\n\nNow, in the BFS for parent and child_num.\n\nIn the BFS loop:\n\nfor each neighbor (u) of v, which is in adj[v][0] ... adj[v][degrees[v] -1].\n\nSo in code, the code has:\n\nfor( int k=0; k< v_degree; k++ )\n\nwhere the variable v_degree is degrees[v].\n\nYes, but degrees after filling the adj arrays are the degree counts (original). Wait no, because in the adj arrays, each adj[v] has length of the degree (since they were allocated with that count), but the degree variables:\n\nWait the problem here: When they realloc the adj pointers, the size of each adj[v] is exactly degrees[v] (before reset to 0), because degrees earlier counted all edges.\n\nYes. Since after counting with edges, then allocated exactly that size, then in the second loop, the degrees array was zeroed, and then the edges were placed in the adj arrays, with the degrees counter inside that loop used as an index to fill the array's element.\n\nSo after the filling, the adjacent lists for each node are correctly stored. Thus, the adj[v] array is valid and filled with all adjacent nodes.\n\nThus the loop k from 0 to v_degree-1 (since v_degree is degrees[v], since it's the length of adj[v]?) Wait, the code has v_degree set to degrees[v]. \n\nYes, because v_degree = degrees[v] (the current degrees array after filling is not used, but since we counted them initially. Hmm, no.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nv_degree was assigned from degrees[v]. But the degrees after initialization after allocating are reset to 0, so when running the adj filling, the degrees[i] are the indices. But the variable v_degree is before the adj array gets filled?\n\nWait in the code above, during the BFS setup section:\n\nint v_degree = degrees[v]; \n\nBut degrees[v] after initialization?\n\nWait, no. Wait the code for the BFS setup is:\n\nWait in the code block above, in the BFS part (the first part):\n\nAfter the edges are filled into the adj lists, the BVS proceeds.\n\nIn that code, the variable 'degrees' is the array that was first initialized with the counts for each node, but later used as an index. \n\nWait, at the point where we do:\n\nint v_degree = degrees[v]\n\nWait in the C code above, the degrees array at that point:\n\nThe degrees array was first used for counting edge counts (stored in degrees), then after that, the code loops through and sets degrees[i] =0 (right after malloc'ing the adj arrays), to reset. \n\nThus, at BFS time, degrees[i] is the number of entries written before? But after resetting to 0, during the edge filling, degrees[i] is used as a count of elements for the adjacency lists.\n\nWait, the 'degrees' array in the code is being used as the current indices for each node's adjacency arrays.\n\nThus, the code's adj filling has degrees as current pointers.\n\nAfter that, the degrees arrays are at their final values (the current index?), which is exactly the total edges.\n\nBecause after the edges are filled, degrees[i] for each node i should be exactly equal to the number of edges adjacent to the node. Wait:\n\nYes, because e.g., a node starts with degrees for the node being 0. Then for each edge, when adding to adj, the code increments the 'degrees' array entry. So for each edge (a,b):\n\nWhen processing the edge e.a \u2192 adding to adj[e.a], the previous count is degrees[a], which is inserted into the array at that index, then degrees[a] is increased by one. So by the end, each degrees[i] is exactly the count of edges added to adj[i]. Thus, degrees array is the correct size of each adjacency list. \n\nThus, when we loop over the adj[v]'s edges, the correct way is to iterate from 0 to degrees[v]-1, because the degrees[v] holds the current actual size of the adjacency list.\n\nAh, but in the code written earlier, when v_degree is set to degrees[v], yes:\n\nint v_degree = degrees[v]; \n\nand then loop to k < v_degree, so it's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the BFS is correct.\n\nNow, the second part of the code.\n\nThe 'seen' array is reused here. Because in the BFS, it is 1 for visited nodes, but in the second loop, the code is using 'seen' again, but setting it to 0.\n\nWait, in the Python code, in the second part:\n\nAfter the BFS sets 'seen' to 1 for all nodes, the 'seen' array is re-purposed as a flag for when nodes are in the sequence processing step. \n\nWait the Python code does:\n\nseq = deque() storing leaves (those with child_num 0).\n\nThen, while seq is not empty:\n\n    c = seq.pop()\n    seen[c] =0 (mark as removed?)\n\n    then check if par[c]'s seen is 0: output first.\n\n    set seen[par[c]] to 0?\n\n    Then reduce child_num of par's parent, and if reaches zero, add to seq.\n\nWait the purpose here is to track whether the parent is still available, perhaps.\n\nHmm, the 'seen' array here is now acting as whether the node is still available in the game, maybe?\n\nBut translating that into C:\n\nWe need to first go through all nodes and check their child_num for leaves.\n\nThen use the stack (seq_stack as an array).\n\nEach time we pop an element c from the stack (the last in, first out).\n\nSet seen[c] to 0 (mark that it's been removed?).\n\nThen we look at its parent p.\n\nCheck if the parent's seen is 0 (indicating it has just been removed or not?)\n\nWait in the Python code:\n\nif seen[p] == 0 \u2192 that means the parent's 'available'?\n\nNot exactly sure, but translating the seen array is hardcoded here.\n\nHowever in the C code, the 'seen' array is first used for the BFS, and then this second part writes into seen again, so it should be okay.\n\nIn the C code:\n\nIn the second part, the loop:\n\nafter handling the popped node 'c', 'seen[c]' is set to 0. Then:\n\nif( seen[p] == 0 ), then print first and exit.\n\nSo that's the check. \n\nThen, seen[p] is set to 0 as well.\n\nBut why? It's unclear what the seen array represents in the second part, but since the code is duplicate, I just need to translate as is.\n\nNow, looking back, the code in the first part:\n\nseen array is initially all 0, then set to 1 when processed.\n\nchild_num counts how many children each node has (child_num is set by incrementing the parent[v] of u).\n\nThe second part's code:\n\nWe process the nodes c in the stack (sequence), which are leaves (child_num zero).\n\nThen when we take c and its parent p = par[c].\n\nWait, but c has no children since child_num[c] is zero (it's a leaf), but may have a parent.\n\nThe code then checks the parent's seen to be 0 \u2192 but what is 'seen' in this step? \n\nPerhaps in the code's second part, the seen array is used to track which nodes are still in play, not yet removed.\n\nWhen we remove node c by popping from the stack, we set seen[c] to 0 (unsetting it from available?), but then check if the parent is already unset (seen 0 \u2192 already removed?), so the condition seen[p] ==0 implies that the parent is not available, so then the first player could have taken advantage.\n\nHmm, the logic may be complex, but the C code should mirror the Python exactly.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nThe 'seen' array after the first part's BFS is 1 for all nodes, but in the second loop:\n\nInitially, we set seen[c] =0 (marks that c has been removed), and then check the parent.\n\nIf the parent's seen is 0 (has been removed as well?), but maybe the parent was just removed now?\n\nWait the Python code's second part:\n\nExactly same steps:\n\nIn the second loop:\n\nc is removed (from the sequence)\n\nthen \"seen[u] = 0\" (Python's seen is a list of 0's again?)\n\nWait in the Python code at this step:\n\nThe seen array after the BFS:\n\nseen was set to 1 for all nodes. Then in the second part, the loop:\n\nseen = [0] * (N+1)\n\nWait wait, sorry, in the code given in Python, after the BFS, the variables are:\n\nseen = [0]*(N+1)\n\nWait no, looking at the original Python code:\n\nLooking again:\n\nOriginal Python code after BFS:\n\n(seq starts with all leaves, then while loop:\n\n    c = seq.pop()\n\n    seen[c] =0\n\n    then look at par[c], check its seen is 0. \n\nWait in the Python code, after the initial BFS, the variables after are:\n\nAt the second part, in Python the code uses a different seen array?\n\nWait let's look at the original code:\n\nThe Python code has the lines:\n\n    seen = [0] * (N + 1)\n    seen[1] = 1  // in the BFS initialization?\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nThe Python code's variables are:\n\nAfter importing, then:\n\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\nThen:\n\nN = int(input())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n\nreading the edges.\n\nThen, the BFS part:\n\nque = deque()\n\nque.append(1)\n\nseen = [0] * (N +1)\n\nseen[1] =1\n\npar array, child_num initialized.\n\nThen the BFS loop.\n\nThen later:\n\nseq is initialized with leaves (nodes where child_num[i]==0)\n\nThen in the second loop:\n\n    while seq:\n\n        c = seq.pop()\n\n        seen[c] =0\n\n        if seen[ par[c] ] ==0 \u2192 then first.\n\n    Etc.\n\nWait So in the Python code, the 'seen' array is the same array used during BFS, not reinitialized again.\n\nThus after BFS, all seen values are 1 (except those possibly overwritten? Wait:\n\nBFS sets all visited nodes (all) to seen 1.\n\nThen, after that, the code start modifying the seen array for other purposes.\n\nSo in the second loop's seen array is just continued being used.\n\nThus, in the C code, using the same seen array is correct.\n\nHence the use is okay.\n\nThus, in the C code, the steps are okay.\n\nThe final part of the C code:\n\nWhen the loop finishes, and it didn't print \"First\", the code is supposed to print \"Second\".\n\nNow, possible issues in the code:\n\nThe main problemas are the adjacency lists, and the queues management.\n\nWait, what about the initial stack initialization?\n\nIn the code:\n\nseq_stack is allocated as N elements? For N nodes, maybe okay. Since at first, the maximum leaves is up to N (like star-shaped tree), so better to allocate N elements. Probably okay.\n\nIn the code, the for loop \"for (i=1 to N)\" adds all leaves (child_num 0) to seq_stack.\n\nThen, in the sequence processing loop: \n\neach time popping from the top.\n\nAnother thing: when the code reduces the child_num of the grandparent, it may trigger a new entry.\n\nYes. \n\nAnother possible error is when we do:\n\nchild_num[ gp ] -= 1 (in the C code, it's written as child_num[ gp ]--.\n\nWait the line says:\n\n// The grandparent is par[p], so parent of p is par[p], so child_num's parent of p's parent (gp's) is the next level.\n\nYes. Because p is the parent of c, and the grandparent is the parent of p. The code reduces child_num of the grandparent, since when a child (p) gets removed, its grandparent's child count drops.\n\nBecause in this game, when you remove a leaf node (node c), the next player removes its parent if possible, but I'm not sure. \n\nBut regardless, in the code the decrement of child_num of grandparent:\n\nThe code says:\n\nchild_num[ par[ par[c] ] ] -=1\n\nWhich in C is written as:\n\nchild_num[ gp ] --;\n\nYes.\n\nIf that becomes zero, add it to the stack.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the par array for the root node (node 1). Its parent is set to 0 (since the root is the starting point, the parent of 1 is 0). \n\nYes. In the BFS setup:\n\npar array is initialized to all zeros.\n\nSo in the code:\n\npar[1] = 0? \n\nIn the BFS, when we process node 1's children, for each u in adj[1], if not visited, the child is set to have parent 1, and child_num[1] increases accordingly.\n\nThus par for node 1 remains 0.\n\nThus when we reach the root node (node 1) in the second part, the parent is 0. So:\n\nWhen, say, par[c] is node 1?\n\nThen parent of p ( node 1 ), par[1] is zero, which is not a valid node.\n\nBut in the code, we have to proceed with care.\n\nBecause in the code's second part:\n\nWhen checking the condition:\n\npar[c] is the parent of current node c.\n\nThe condition is:\n\nif seen[ par[c] ] == 0 \u2192 which is the case if the parent has been removed?\n\nWait, but when processing the root node (1), its parent is 0, which is invalid. \n\nSuppose that the program is designed so that the game eventually removes the root node in some way?\n\nHmm. Not sure. But the code should be correct as according to the problem statement. \n\nAssuming the code works in Python as intended, the C code should need to mirror it even in such cases.\n\nThus, in handling the base case, if the 'root node's' parent is zero, then par[par[c]] may be unmanageable, but perhaps this case is managed since the code was working in Python.\n\nIn the code's second part, for when c is the root ( node 1 ), then p is 0 (par[1] is 0).\n\nThus, gp is par[0]... but 0 is an invalid node.\n\nWait, this is a problem.\n\nWait the code says:\n\nint gp = par[p]; // when p is node1 (par[1] is 0). \n\nThus, gp = par[0], but par[0] is 0 by initializations (par was initialized to zero for all nodes including par[0], which is unused but stored as zero). So gp is 0. \n\nSo:\n\nchild_num[ gp ] \u2192 child_num[0]. Which is initially 0.\n\nWhen we call child_num[ gp ] --, that would decrease child_num[0] to -1. But in the code, perhaps we shouldn't do this.\n\nWait but in the code of the Python:\n\nThe code is doing:\n\nif u is a leaf node (child_num[i]==0), then when you process that node, you remove it.\n\nThen, in code:\n\nworking with children nodes:\n\nHere's looking at the Python code's line:\n\nchild_num[ par[ par[c] ] ] -=1\n\nBut when c is the root node (1), then par[c] is zero.\n\nThen par[ par[c] ] is par[0], which is zero. \n\nThus, the code is trying to access par[ par[c] ] where par[c] is zero.\n\nThus this would refer to node 0 (invalid), thus attempting to manipulate child_num[0], which is an invalid node (as nodes are numbered from 1).\n\nBut the Python code's initial child_num is set using par array. \n\nWait the Python code's initializations include:\n\npar = [0]*(N+1). \n\nSo for the root, which is node1, par[1]=0.\n\nThus in Python, when c is node1, the code would have:\n\npar[c] = 0, then the grandparent is par[0], which is 0.\n\nThus child_num[0] -=1 would be performed (but since the first node's parent is 0, and its parent's parent is also zero, but child_num[0] is initially zero, so subtracting would get to -1, then when that next node is considered (but it is zero).\n\nThus, this part of the code is invalid.\n\nWait the scenario is possible only when the code reaches c being the root node. Because to have the root node in the sequence (seq), its child_num must be zero, meaning it has no children. So root node has no children, so all nodes except root must be disconnected? Only if the tree is isolated nodes (but since it's a tree with N nodes and N-1 edges, only if N=1).\n\nWait if N=1, the root has zero children. So in that case, the code would have sequence containing node1.\n\nIn that case, let's see how the Python code handles N=1:\n\nN is 1, so edges would be 0. \n\nThen par array for node1 is set to 0. child_num[1] is zero. \n\nThe sequence starts with node1.\n\nProcess c = node1:\n\nset seen[1] =0 \u2192 \n\nthen check par[1] is 0 \u2192 seen[0]?\n\nBut the array index for seen[0], which is initialized to 0. So if seen[0] is 0?\n\nYes.\n\nThus, in that case, the condition in the code would be:\n\nif seen[par[c]] ==0 \u2192 that is, seen[0] ==0 \u2192 which is yes, so print 'First' and exit.\n\nSo for N=1, the first player wins.\n\nThus, the code's logic is okay even when gp is invalid (0), but in cases where the root is processed, the condition for printing 'First' would be based on par's seen being zero?\n\nWait in the event c is the root (1), the code does:\n\nprint first only if seen[parent node (which was zero)] is zero \u2192 seen[0], which is initialized to 0 (since seen is initialized all 0 then set to 1 during BFS, and the seen array after BFS has all nodes set.\n\nWait wait let's think about the initialization of 'seen':\n\nThe seen array in the C code is initialized as:\n\nint seen[N+1] = {0}; \n\nWhich sets all elements (0 to N) to zero. \n\nThen during the BFS setup, node 1 is set to 1 (seen[1] =1 before enqueuing.\n\nThus, the initial seen array has seen[0] remaining at 0 (since we didn't touch it), and the other nodes (after BFS) are marked 1.\n\nThen in the second part's processing, when c is node1, the code:\n\nseen[c]=0.\n\nThen:\n\np = par[1] \u2192 0.\n\nseen[par[c]] \u2192 seen[0], which is originally 0 (unless it was changed earlier, but in the code's conditions, seen is only modified here).\n\nThus, the condition seen[p]==0 is true. \n\nThus, the code returns 'First', which is the desired result for N=1.\n\nThus even when accessing 'seen[0]', which is node 0 (invalid), but it's okay for the logic.\n\nHence, the code will work, even though the grandpa is node 0 and child_num[0] is being modified.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nAfter the root is processed (c =1), then p = par[1] is zero, the code checks the grandpa:\n\nchild_num[ gp ] -=1 \u2192 gp is par[p] = par[0] =0. Thus, child_num[0]-- \u2192 which is initially zero \u2192 becomes -1. So child_num[0] is -1.\n\nBut since in the C code when that is added to the stack?\n\nIn the code:\n\n    if ( child_num[ gp ] ==0 ) \u2192 then adding to stack.\n\nBut when decreasing from 0 to -1 \u2192 the condition would not be met.\n\nThus, the code would not add node 0 to the stack, which is okay.\n\nThus it's okay for the code to proceed.\n\nSo in the problematic cases, the code still behaves correctly.\n\nOther possible error: when the par arrays hold parent values correctly.\n\nNow, testing other sample inputs:\n\nExample: N=2.\n\nTree with node1 connected to node2.\n\nBFS: \n\nRoot is node1. Its child is node2. Thus:\n\nchild_num[1] is 1 (since node2 is a child).\n\nchild_num[2] is zero.\n\nIn the second part:\n\nseq_stack starts with node2 (child_num is zero).\n\nHandling node2:\n\npop node2 \u2192 seen[2]=0.\n\n parent of2 is 1.\n\nseen[par[2]=1 is currently 1 (since seen array after BFS is 1 for node1).\n\nThus, the condition is seen[1] ==0? No \u2192 so no print.\n\nThen set seen[1] to 0.\n\nThen:\n\ngrandparent of 2 is par[1], which is zero.\n\nthus, child_num[0]-- \u2192 becomes -1.\n\nBut when child_num[grandparent] reaches zero? Not applicable.\n\nThen the stack's next steps: any?\n\nNow, back to node1.\n\nWhen processing node2 done. The next iteration is the condition if top>0?\n\nIn the code after processing node2, the stack is empty (top was 1 (from adding node2), then after being popped, top becomes 0.\n\nThus, loop ends.\n\nThus, the code proceeds to check whether it has exited, and proceeds to print 'Second'.\n\nWait but for N=2.\n\nIf the first person can take node2 (a leaf), then it becomes second's turn with root node (1). The second player takes node 1, sees that there are no more moves and first will have no move, so second wins? \n\nWait no, the game is such that players remove leaves one by one, alternating turns. The game is similar to the number of leaves parity?\n\nNot sure. According to the code's logic for N=2:\n\nThe code ends with processing node2 and checking for exit.\n\nWhen processing node2:\n\nAfter popping node2, the next step is to check seen[ par[2], which is node1 (par[2]=1). seen[1] is still 1.\n\nThus the condition is not met.\n\nThen seen[1] is set to 0. \n\nThe grandparent is node0, so child_num[0] is subtracted. \n\nThen, since the grandparent's (0) child count was 0 (now -1) \u2192 not zero, so no adding to stack.\n\nThe stack 'seq_stack' now has nothing. \n\nThus, loop ends, and the code prints 'Second'.\n\nIn this case, players alternate:\n\n- Player 1 removes node2 (a leaf).\n\n- Now, the only node is node1 (no leaves), so player2 cannot move. Thus player1 wins?\n\nOr perhaps the rules are different. I'm probably misunderstanding the game logic, but the problem's code seems to decide certain outputs.\n\nBut given that the original Python code for N=2 would print 'Second', as per the code's execution, we'll assume the code is correct.\n\nThus the C code translation is correct.\n\nFinal notes:\n\n- We must make sure all allocations are freed.\n\nIn the C code above, after the adj arrays:\n\nfor each i from 1 to N: adj[i] is dynamically allocated. \n\nThus, need to loop and free adj[i], then free adj (the array of pointers), and edges.\n\nIn the code, that is handled in the free section.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nFurther minor notes:\n\nIn the code, the sequence stack (seq_stack) can be allocated as:\n\nint *seq_stack = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nthen the maximum elements stored would be N in the worst case (for N nodes that are ~a chain and being processed in reverse).\n\nThus the array is okay.\n\nTesting possible off-by-1 errors in loop ranges.\n\nAnother thing: when N == 1, the edges loop won't run (since N-1 is zero). Thus the code still processes? For N=1, the code:\n\nedges pointer is allocated to zero elements? Because:\n\nnum_edges =0, so edges = malloc(0 * struct Edge) \u2192 possibly returning NULL or error, but in practice may be allowed. But to avoid, use an if condition:\n\nif(N ==1){\n\n   // handle case where no edges.\n\n}\n\nBut the code may still work:\n\nWhen N is 1, in the edges processing loop, the for loop for reading edges is skipped.\n\nThen for the adj initialization:\n\ndegrees array for node1 is zero (since no edges), so adj[1] is set to a zero-size array.\n\nWhich is okay.\n\nEven empty adj arrays for node1.\n\nThe BFS will process node1 (since enqueues):\n\nv = node1, then traverses adj (which has zero elements), so loop runs zero times.\n\nThus, child_num[1] is zero.\n\nThen, the 'leaves' (nodes with child_num zero) includes node1.\n\nThus the seq_stack is initialized with node1.\n\nThen when processing, the code behaves as before, gives 'First', which is correct per previous analysis.\n\nThus the code handles N=1. \n\nThus the code is correct."
