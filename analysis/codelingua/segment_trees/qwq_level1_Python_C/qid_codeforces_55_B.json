But let's see. Let me think through each step: First, the function's base case: if i >=3, return. That's straightforward. Inside the loop:\n\nfor j in range(4): \u2192 in C for (int j=0; j<4; j++)\n\nfor k from j+1 to 3 (since 4 in Python range is up to but not including 4, so 0,1,2,3) So the inner loop is for k = j+1 to 3 inclusive? In C, the second loop can be:\n\nfor(int k = j+1; k <4; k++) Then, checking if nums[j] and nums[k] are not -1. Proceed with storing s and t (original values) as in the code. Then, setting nums[j] to -1, since we are swapping those two numbers? Wait the code in Python:\n\ns = nums[j]\n\nnums[j] = -1\n\nt = nums[k]\n\nThen, depending on the operation, compute the new value at k. \n\nAfter recursion, we backtrack by restoring nums[j] and nums[k] to s and t (so backtracking the changes).

But I need to be careful about input validation, but perhaps that's acceptable here. The ans is initialized as [something large]. In C, to have an int variable, initialized to a large value, and pass a pointer to that. So, in main:\n\nint ans = 1e18; perhaps, but maybe better to use a min value. Wait the code uses ans[0] being initiated as a large number (like 1e23?), so in code, in C:\n\nint ans_val = 10000000000000000000000000; \n\nint *ans = &ans_val;\n\nWait no, perhaps define an array of 1 element, and pass its address. int ans[1] = {10000000000000000000000000}; \n\nThen pass &ans[0], so the function can dereference. Hmm. Putting this all together, here's the thought process:\n\nThe function RememberTheNumber in C would be written as:\n\nvoid rememberTheNumber(int nums[4], int i, char *operations, int *ans) {\n\n   if (i >=3) return;\n\n   for (int j =0; j<4; j++) {\n      for (int k = j+1; k <4; k++) {\n         if (nums[j] ! = -1 && nums[k] ! = -1) {\n             // Save the current value\n             int s = nums[j];\n             int t = nums[k];\n             // set nums[j] to -1\n             nums[j] = -1;\n             // compute new value for k\n             if (operations[i] == '+') {\n                 nums[k] = s + t;\n             } else if(operations[i] == '*') {\n                 nums[k] = s * t;\n             }\n             // If at i=2 (third step), check and update ans\n             if( i ==2 && nums[k] < *ans ) {\n                 *ans = nums[k];\n             }\n             // recurse\n             rememberTheNumber(nums, i+1, operations, ans);\n             // backtrack\n             nums[j] = s;\n             nums[k] = t;\n         }\n      }\n   } Wait, but wait, in the Python code, after swapping and modifying, the code proceeds to call the function recursively and then backtracks.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Python code into C. Let's see what the Python code does. \n\nThe function rememberTheNumber is a recursive function. It seems to handle some operations on an array of numbers. The parameters are nums, i, operations, and ans. The main goal is probably to find the minimum value after performing certain operations.\n\nLooking at the variables:\n\n- nums is a list of integers. But in Python lists are mutable, and passed by reference. In C, arrays are passed as pointers. But since we need to modify them in the recursive calls, maybe we need to pass the array and the size? Wait, the code uses indexes up to 3? Or maybe it's fixed size? \n\nWait, looking at the loops in Python: for j in range(4), and for k in range(j+1,4). So the nums list has at least 4 elements. The indices go up to 3 (since it's 0-based and j ranges up to 3? Wait, range(4) is 0-3 so j can be 0,1,2,3. So the nums array is 4 elements.\n\nWait, the original code may be working with four numbers, so perhaps the nums array is of size 4. So in C, if I use an array of 4 integers. When passing to functions, I can just pass the array (as pointers).\n\nThe 'ans' is a list with one element, so in C, it's probably a pointer to an int. We can simulate that by using an int array of size 1. Or perhaps a direct pointer?\n\nThe operations array in Python is a list of strings, each either '+' or '*'. In C, strings need to be arrays of characters. Wait the input for operations is split into strings, so maybe in C, read as a character array for each operation. Each operation is one character. So perhaps in C, we can store them as a char array of size 3 (since operations is length 3, since there are two operations between three numbers, making two operations? Wait the original problem is a bit unclear, but the Python code's initial call is with i=0, and in the function, there's a check for if i >=3. Wait the functions parameters are operations, which in the code calls are passed in. So in the Python code, \"operations\" seems to be a list of length 3 (because the recursive step increments i from 0 to until 2 reaches, and the for loop with j up to 4). Hmm, let me see:\n\nIn the Python code, the operations list is created with split() from the second input. So the number of operations is possibly 3? The code's for loops are nested, but the main control is the recursive calls. The loop for the function is when i becomes 0,1,2. Because once i reaches 2, after the next call (i+1=3), the function returns when i >=3. So operations have 3 operators. So the operations array length is 3.\n\nSo in C, we can define an array of 3 characters (each 'x' being '+', '*'). \n\nNow the ans: in Python, it's a list with a single element, which is a big number. It's passed by reference, so when modified, it's modified in-place. In C, to mimic this, we need to use a pointer to an integer (or an array with size 1). \n\nSo the steps for translating:\n\n1. The function signature: RememberTheNumber() (maybe in C), parameters are:\n\nnums: an array of integers (size 4?), but passed as an array, so the parameter will be int* or int nums[4] (though in C when passing arrays, they decay to pointers, but the size is not carried over).\n\ni: integer.\n\noperations: an array of char, size 3.\n\nans: an array of int with size 1 (so to pass it, we pass the address, perhaps as int*).\n\nWait, in C, perhaps it's better to have:\n\nThe function parameters in C will be:\n\nint nums[4] (or int*, and maybe pass its size?), int i, char operations[3], and int *ans.\n\nWait in C, formal array parameters can be written as array type (though in practice it's a pointer). But the important thing is to carry over that in the function, the array is treated as a pointer.\n\nBut let's see. Let me think through each step:\n\nFirst, the function's base case: if i >=3, return. That's straightforward.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nfor j in range(4): \u2192 in C for (int j=0; j<4; j++)\n\nfor k from j+1 to 3 (since 4 in Python range is up to but not including 4, so 0,1,2,3)\n\nSo the inner loop is for k = j+1 to 3 inclusive?\n\nIn C, the second loop can be:\n\nfor(int k = j+1; k <4; k++) \n\nThen, checking if nums[j] and nums[k] are not -1.\n\nProceed with storing s and t (original values) as in the code. \n\nThen, setting nums[j] to -1, since we are swapping those two numbers? \n\nWait the code in Python:\n\ns = nums[j]\n\nnums[j] = -1\n\nt = nums[k]\n\nThen, depending on the operation, compute the new value at k. \n\nAfter recursion, we backtrack by restoring nums[j] and nums[k] to s and t (so backtracking the changes).\n\nHmm, so this is a backtracking approach. \n\nIn C code, same steps.\n\nNow, passing nums as an array. Since in C, arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions, we need to make sure the function parameters are pointers.\n\nWait in the function, when we modify the nums array, we must pass it as a pointer to the first element.\n\nSo the function signature would be something like:\n\nvoid rememberTheNumber(int nums[4], int i, char operations[3], int *ans)\n\nWait but in C, when passed as an array, you can just use it. \n\nWait also the function is called recursively. Each recursive step modifies the nums array, then backtracks. So need to pass it by reference. \n\nNow, the global or local variables? The C code should not have global variables unless necessary. The original Python code is using ans as a list passed around, so in C it can be a pointer to an integer, which we can modify in the function.\n\nIn the code's initial part:\n\nIn Python:\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nassuming that the input provides 4 integers. So in C, we need to read 4 numbers from the user, into an array of 4 integers. \n\ncodes in C:\n\nint nums[4];\n\nscanf expects space-separated numbers. \n\nThen for the operations:\n\noperations is a list from input().split(). So in the C code, the next line would be reading the operations. Since there are 3 operations (assuming that the input gives exactly three characters), perhaps like:\n\nchar operations[3]; \n\nThen, using scanf to read the 3 characters. Wait, but input might be a string like \"+ * *\", etc. So we need to read each character properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use getchar() with space as delimiters?\n\nAlternatively, using a helper to read 3 chracters. Let me think.\n\nThe Python code is reading each string from split(), but each of them is one-character operators. So the input for operations is separated by spaces, but each is a single character. So in C, perhaps use sscanf:\n\nBut perhaps:\n\nRead the input line as a string, then for each character, skip spaces, then take the next character as the operator. Alternatively,:\n\nchar buffer[100]; \n\nfgets(buffer, 100, stdin); \n\nthen parse each character, skipping spaces, into the operations array.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach would be to loop reading each using scanf with %c and %*1[ ] to skip spaces/following whitespace, but it can be error-prone. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using sscanf:\n\nchar tmp[128];\nfgets(tmp, 127, stdin);\nint result = sscanf(tmp, \" %c %c %c\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]); \n\nThat way, leading spaces are skipped, and then each %c would skip any whitespace and read the next character, until three are read.\n\nBut I need to be careful about input validation, but perhaps that's acceptable here.\n\nThe ans is initialized as [something large]. In C, to have an int variable, initialized to a large value, and pass a pointer to that. \n\nSo, in main:\n\nint ans = 1e18; perhaps, but maybe better to use a min value. Wait the code uses ans[0] being initiated as a large number (like 1e23?), so in code, in C:\n\nint ans_val = 10000000000000000000000000; \n\nint *ans = &ans_val;\n\nWait no, perhaps define an array of 1 element, and pass its address.\n\nint ans[1] = {10000000000000000000000000}; \n\nThen pass &ans[0], so the function can dereference.\n\nHmm.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the thought process:\n\nThe function RememberTheNumber in C would be written as:\n\nvoid rememberTheNumber(int nums[4], int i, char *operations, int *ans) {\n\n   if (i >=3) return;\n\n   for (int j =0; j<4; j++) {\n      for (int k = j+1; k <4; k++) {\n         if (nums[j] != -1 && nums[k] != -1) {\n             // Save the current value\n             int s = nums[j];\n             int t = nums[k];\n             // set nums[j] to -1\n             nums[j] = -1;\n             // compute new value for k\n             if (operations[i] == '+') {\n                 nums[k] = s + t;\n             } else if(operations[i] == '*') {\n                 nums[k] = s * t;\n             }\n             // If at i=2 (third step), check and update ans\n             if( i ==2 && nums[k] < *ans ) {\n                 *ans = nums[k];\n             }\n             // recurse\n             rememberTheNumber(nums, i+1, operations, ans);\n             // backtrack\n             nums[j] = s;\n             nums[k] = t;\n         }\n      }\n   }\n\nWait, but wait, in the Python code, after swapping and modifying, the code proceeds to call the function recursively and then backtracks. \n\nHmm. The problem here is that in C, the arrays are passed as pointers, so when you modify nums in the function, it's modifying the original array. However, that's the expected behavior, as in Python, the list is mutable. So backtracking is essential here for this approach. \n\nWait another thing: in the loops in Python, they loop through all j and k pairs and for each, choose two numbers (non -1) to perform operation, and proceed with these new numbers. Since this is recursive, all possible paths are considered, and when backtracking, the previous state is restored. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, the operations array in the function in C: functions parameters are operations (for the operators), which in C is passed as a pointer, so 'char* operations' since it's a string of characters. \n\nWait the 'operations' in C can be an array of 3, and the parameters can be char ops[3], but since arrays in C can be passed as pointers, so just using 'char* operations'.\n\nIn C, the function would be written with parameters like that. \n\nNow, I need to translate the initial code's function first, then the main part. Let me try.\n\nNow, the main function:\n\nThe first input is a line giving 4 integers. \n\nIn C:\n\nint nums[4];\nfor(int i =0; i<4; i++) {\n   scanf(\"%d\", &nums[i]);\n}\n\nThe second input: operations, which is three characters. So:\n\nchar operations[3];\nfgets(buffer, 40, stdin); // To get the next line.\nor, using something like:\n\nchar op_str[50];\nscanf(\"%s\", op_str); // but that leaves the third operator? \n\nHmm perhaps better to read via sscanf. Let me think:\n\nAssuming the input is given via the second line, which consists of three operators separated by spaces, like \"+ * -\".\n\nSo first read the entire line into a buffer, then parse the characters from there, skipping spaces. \n\nAlternatively, use scanf for each character with proper formatting.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (scanf(\" %c %c %c \", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]) !=3) \n   /* error */ \n\nWait the space before %c in scanf would consume any leading whitespace. The formatting ensures each scans a direct character but skips any leading spaces. \n\nWait, for input like \"+ * *\", the stdin would have.\n\nthe first space (if any) before the '+' is skipped by the first \" %c\", then %c reads '+', then the next space(s) are handled by the next %c, thus each. So using:\n\n   scanf(\" %c %c %c %*[^\\n]\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]);\n\nWait, perhaps better to read three chars with:\n\nscanf(\" %c%c%c%*[^\\n]\",...) ?\n\nHmm maybe.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nfgets(buffer, 100, stdin); // read the line into buffer.\n\nchar *p = buffer;\n\nsscanf(p, \" %c %c %c %n\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2], &consumed_chars);\n\nNot sure, perhaps the scanf in C can do it with:\n\nscanf(\" %c %c %c\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]);\n\nAssuming that the input has exactly three characters, each separated by spaces, and no leading/trailing except possibly leading space. \n\nThe space before first %c in the format string ensures any leading whitespace is skipped.\n\nThis should work, as for example for input like \" + *   *\", the scanf will capture the '+' (after the leading space), then the '*' (after the space), then the other '*' (after the three spaces). So the spaces are not a problem. \n\nIf the input for operations is being read correctly into the 3-character array.\n\nOnce operations are read correctly, then proceed. \n\nThe ans variable is initialized to a large number. In C:\n\nint ans_val = 10000000000000000000000000ull; ? Wait what's that number?\n\nWait the Python code sets ans[0] to 1e24 (something like). However, in C, the maximum value for a signed integer is about 2^31 which is ~2e9, but 1e24 is way bigger. So perhaps the number is beyond 64-bit integer's maximum. So need to use a larger type, like long long, but even that would be 64 bits. Because 1e24 is over 2^80, so better use a 64-bit number?\n\nWait the original Python code uses ans[0] = 10^24 (maybe?), perhaps in C, we can set it to the maximum possible long long, and see, but the actual operations would allow for a minimal number? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial value can be set as a large number like 1e18, since the problem's constraints may not require such a large number. But to stay faithful to the original code, maybe set it to a very big number. So perhaps:\n\nlong long ans_val = 10000000000000000000000000LL;\n\nand use a 'long long' for ans type. Because else, the number is way too big for an int, even on 64-bit systems. Wait let me see:\n\nThe number in the problem's Python code is 10000000000000000000000000. Let's count the digits:\n\nThat's 1 followed by 23 zeros. So 1e23? Wait 24 zeros would be 1e24. Wait in Python, that's a big integer but C can't store it in a standard int. So need to use a 64-bit type, but even a 64-bit signed number can only handle up to about 9e18 (2^63). So 1e23 is way beyond. Hmm, this is a problem. So maybe the problem expects that ans is a large number which can be stored in 64 bits. Because 1e23 is larger than 2^64 (which is ~1.8e19), so even as an unsigned long long (max is ~1.8e19), it won't work. So perhaps the original code's ans was initialized with the wrong constant? Or maybe in the problem's context, the numbers can't go that low? Wait wait the code's purpose is to find the minimal possible number. So setting ans to a very large number. \n\nWait but maybe the original Python code had ans initialized to a very big number but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. But in C, using long long, the maximum value for a signed 64-bit is 2^63-1 (~9e18). So if the problem can have a result lower than that, we can proceed. Perhaps the test case doesn't require the starting to be 1e24?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer can be initialized to the maximum possible value of a long long. So:\n\n#define LLONG_MAX (9223372036854775807LL)\n\nans_val = LLONG_MAX;\n\nSo initializing to that. \n\nHmm but the Python code sets it to something smaller (earlier code in Python `ans[0] = 10000000000000000000000000`, which is smaller than LLONG_MAX). Wait, 1e23 is way smaller than 9e18? Wait no: 1e23 is 10^23 (1 followed by 23 zeros), which is 10^23 = 10000000000000000000000. That's 1e23 is way larger than 9e18, so such a value can't be stored in a signed 64-bit integer. Therefore, the problem may have constraints such that the minimal result is at least within that 64-bit range. So, perhaps the right thing to do in C is to cast the initial ans to be 9223372036854775807LL (the max for 64 bit), since otherwise the code would overflow.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not need such a large number because, for example, the initial numbers are up to some limits, but since the original Python code uses that very large number, perhaps the user is following that.\n\nWait let me check in Python. 10000000000000000000000000 in Python is just a number, no problem. But in C, when storing that, it exceeds 64-bit. Therefore, in C, the variable ans needs to be a larger type. But since C does not have a 128-bit integer, perhaps that's impossible. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. So how should I handle this? \n\nPerhaps the initial value is just 1e17 or another manageable value. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different scenario. \n\nWait let me think about the problem. \n\nThe function seems to compute some minimal expression with applying operations between two of the four numbers. The initial numbers are possibly up to some maximum? For example, if the numbers are up to 1e9, and with multiplication, three operations, the result might be up to 1e27 (but that's 3 multiplicative steps, so e.g. (a*b)*c)*d --> but maybe each step reduces the numbers but in this case, perhaps the problem is to choose which numbers to combine first to get the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial ans in the Python code is just a placeholder for \"very big\", so in C, we can set the ans_val to a very large value compatible with long long, e.g. 1e18.\n\nWait the initial code in C could set ans_val to 9223372036854775807ULL, which is the max for 64 bit signed. However in the Python code the initial ans starts even higher. Maybe it's sufficient because the problem will have an actual answer lower than that. Alternatively, maybe the code would fail, but perhaps the problem constraints ensure that even with 64 bits it works. \n\nI think the best approach is to use long long in C:\n\ndefine the ans as long long, and the ans in the function takes a pointer to long long. \n\nAdjusting the code accordingly. \n\nSo for the vars in C:\n\n- ans_val will be a long long initialized to a large number.\n\nThe function's parameters will have an ans parameter as pointer to long long.\n\nSo the function definition:\n\nvoid rememberTheNumber(int nums[4], int i, char *operations, long long *ans) {\n\nThe variables nums[k], s, and t must be integers, but the intermediate computations can overflow as well. For example, if during a multiplication step, the value exceeds 64 bits, but in that case, the problem might not require handling such cases, so the variable nums can stay as integers, and the final result may also be allowed to overflow (since in the competition problems, usually numbers stay within 32 or 64 bits). \n\nBut assuming that the operations and the numbers are small enough not to cause overflows, but just to stay as 32 or 64 bit integers. \n\nNow, the initial code's ans stores the minimum of nums[k], but in the code, the ans is a large value which is being potentially overwritten with a smaller one. \n\nPutting all together, the code outline in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <limits.h>\n\nvoid rememberTheNumber(int nums[4], int i, char* operations, long long* ans) {\n    if (i >= 3) return;\n    \n    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {\n        for (int k = j + 1; k < 4; k++) {\n            if (nums[j] != -1 && nums[k] != -1) {\n                int s = nums[j];\n                int t = nums[k];\n                nums[j] = -1;\n                if (operations[i] == '+') {\n                    nums[k] = s + t;\n                } else {\n                    nums[k] = s * t;\n                }\n                if (i == 2 && nums[k] < *ans) {\n                    *ans = nums[k];\n                }\n                rememberTheNumber(nums, i + 1, operations, ans);\n                // Backtrack\n                nums[j] = s;\n                nums[k] = t;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int nums[4];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &nums[i]);\n    }\n    \n    char operations[3];\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        scanf(\" %c\", &operations[i]); //Space before %c to ignore whitespace\n    }\n    \n    long long ans_val = 9223372036854775807LL; // LLONG_MAX\n    long long* ans = &ans_val;\n    \n    rememberTheNumber(nums, 0, operations, ans);\n    \n    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans_val);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but this needs to be checked.\n\nWait in the Python code, in the line:\n\noperations = list(map(str, input().split()))\n\nWhich splits the input into substrings (split by whitespace) and converts each to a string (but they are individual characters like '+', '*'). So the input for the operations is a string like \"+ - +\" which is split into [\"+\", \"-\", \"+\"], each of which is used as a single character. So in C, the 'char operations[3]' needs to hold each character. \n\nIn the code above, using scanf(\" %c\", ...) for each character. The first scanf consumes any whitespace, then gets the next character. The \" %c\" allows for ignoring leading spaces before the first operator. \n\nBut using multiple scanf statements would work:\n\nFor example:\n\nscanf(\" %c %c %c\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]);\n\nThis would eat any leading whitespace, then scan the first character (assuming that there's enough), then require a space and the second, etc. Wait if the input is like:\n\n \"+ * ^\" (without a space between? Hmm, no. Since space is needed between the characters.\n\nWait, the input is provided as a line of three operators, separated by spaces. So the code with a single scanf line for all three:\n\nscanf(\" %c %c %c%*c\", ...)?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is better if:\n\nThe line is read using a scanf with three %c and the format string with spaces. So, for example:\n\nscanf(\" %c%c%c%*c\", ...) ?\n\nNo, since the spaces between in the input can be handled by the space in format.\n\nWait here's an example. Suppose user inputs '+ * *', then:\n\nthe first %c reads '+', and the space in the format after %c skips any whitespace (like the space after '+'). \n\nWait:\n\nThere's an initial space in the format string, which skips leading spaces. Then %c reads the first non-whitespace character (e.g. '+'). Then the next %c has no space before it, so needs the next character, but if there's space between the '+ and next, then it will read the space? No, space in input between would be considered as next. \n\nWait the format string should have spaces between the %c terms in order to ignore any whitespace between them. \n\nSo the correct format is:\n\nscanf(\" %c %c %c\", &ops[0], ops[1], ops[2]) \n\nWait. Wait, but the spaces between the format specifiers are part of the format string. \n\nSo \" %c %c %c\" will match: \n\n0. Any leading whitespace (because of the initial space) followed by:\n\na character (the '+', then any whitespace (so the space between '+' and next), then next %c (so the second operator character). \n\nHence, this should work.\n\nThus, in main:\n\nif (scanf(\" %c %c %c\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]) !=3 ) then error, but assuming correct input. \n\nThus changing the code to:\n\nscanf(\" %c %c %c\", &operations[0], &operations[1], &operations[2]);\n\nNow, the rest.\n\nNow, checking the backtracking code. The 'j' loop and k loop in C.\n\nThe function is using the recursive approach correctly. Each time, when the numbers j and k are chosen (both are not -1), then they are replaced, computed, and after recursion, roll back.\n\nIn C, integers are modified correctly via the array passed as a pointer. So that's good.\n\nNow, the initial ans value is set to a large number. Using LLONG_MAX.\n\nWait, in the code example I wrote earlier, it was set to 9223372036854775807LL which is indeed LLONG_MAX. \n\nWait but in code, maybe include <limits.h> and use LLONG_MAX:\n\nlong long ans_val = LLONG_MAX;\n\nThat's better. So include the header and use the constant.\n\nAlso, when printing, use %lld. \n\nTesting:\n\nLet me see if the code is correct. \n\nOne possible test case:\n\nInput:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n* + +\n\nSuppose the numbers are 1 2 3 4.\n\nThe first operation (i=0) is *, which is the first operator in operations[0].\n\nThe aim is to choose two numbers (not -1) to combine via *, and set j and k so that they will be replaced. \n\nWait the logic in the code: the first call, when i=0, i is less than 3, so loop over all j and k pairs where nums[j] and nums[k] are not -1 (they are all 1-4, so initially all are valid).\n\nWe can pick any two numbers, say 1 and 2:\n\nThen, set nums[j]= -1, j is the first, then nums[k] (2's position) becomes 1*2=2. (but depends on which were chosen). \n\nWait perhaps the test case is just to see if it will compute the minimal path. Well, in any case, the code structure seems right. \n\nAnother possible test case:\n\nThe input could have four numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4 and operations \" + * \", so the operations are + then *. The function chooses the sequence of operations and which numbers to combine.\n\nThus, I think the C code above is correct."
