Finally, it prints the total.\n\nHmm, so the main steps are: read n, read the array, compute the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, including the first element's absolute value.\n\nIn C, I'll need to handle input differently. Let's think about how to structure this. \n\nFirst, to read n, I can use scanf. Then read the array. But how to read variable number of elements? The array size is n, so I need to get n first, then allocate memory for the array. Oh right, in C you can't have a variable-length array unless it's in C99. But assuming that's allowed here, since the Python code uses a list which is dynamic. So maybe we can use a pointer and allocate with malloc. Wait, but in some cases, people just make the array as [n], but in C89 that's not allowed. Hmm, but maybe it's okay for the problem constraints. Let's see. Let's suppose the code can use C99, so variable-length arrays are okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simpler to read n first, then allocate the array. So first step: read n. Then read n integers into the array.\n\nWait, the Python code does r = [*map(int, input().split())], which effectively reads all the integers from the second input line as a list. So in C, the second input line is a list of space-separated integers. So in C, after reading n, I can loop n times and read each element. Alternatively, read them all at once using a loop with scanf. \n\nNow for the absolute value function: in C, there's abs() in stdlib.h for integers. So that's straightforward.\n\nThe algorithm part is similar to Python. Initialize ans with the absolute value of r[0]. Then loop from i=1 to n-1, add the absolute difference between r[i] and r[i-1].\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, include the necessary headers: #include <stdio.h> for input/output and #include <stdlib.h> for abs?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, abs is in stdlib.h, but for C, if you use int's, the standard says that you can use abs(int), which is declared in stdlib.h. So make sure to include that.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead n. \n\nRead the array of length n. Let's declare the array after reading n. \n\nWait, let's see in code:\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    int r[n];  // assuming C99 VLA\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &r[i]);\n    }\n    int ans = abs(r[0]);\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        ans += abs(r[i] - r[i-1]);\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, variable length arrays (VLAs) are part of C99. If the compiler is using an older standard like C89, that would be a problem. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, assuming that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if not, but I don't think the user would mind that, since the Python code uses a list which is similar.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the case when n is 0? But in the problem, probably n is given as a valid input. So assuming n is at least 1. Because otherwise the first element would be out of bounds. So the code would crash if n is 0, but that's up to the problem's input constraints, perhaps. The user's Python code also assumes that r[0] exists, so n is at least 1.\n\nNow, is there any issue? Testing with the code.\n\nWait, in the code above: when the second input line is read, say the user enters the numbers space-separated, and the for loop reads each one with scanf. So input would have to be properly formatted.\n\nWait, for example, if the input line has exactly n numbers, then that's okay. If not, it might give unexpected results, but that's up to the problem's constraints. So the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the second input line is split into parts, so any extra elements beyond n are ignored, or if less, then it might be an error? Wait, Python takes all elements from the split, and stores them in the list. So the length of the list may not be exactly n, but in the problem statement, probably the input is correct and the second line has exactly n numbers.\n\nTherefore assuming that in the C code, the user will input exactly n numbers after the first line.\n\nSo I think the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in C, the loop for reading the elements would require that each is space-separated. Since scanf with %d will read the next integer, skipping whitespace, so that's okay.\n\nThus the C code should work.\n\nAnother thing: in C, the abs function returns an int, and since the sum is stored in an int, what about possible overflow? But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big. But the problem likely assumes that the input is such that the result fits into an int. So proceeding accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the code is as written above."
