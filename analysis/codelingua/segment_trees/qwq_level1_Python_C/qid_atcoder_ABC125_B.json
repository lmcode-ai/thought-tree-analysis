Alternatively, use a pointer to the line and parse with strtok. Hmm. Let me think: perhaps using a simplified version. Let's try to proceed step by step.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me first read through the Python code to understand what it's doing.\n\nSo, the Python code starts by reading an integer N from input. Then it reads two lists V and C, converting each element to integers. Then there's a list initialized with [0], and ans and X, Y are set to 0. Then a loop runs from 0 to N-1. For each index i, if V[i] - C[i] is greater than 0, it sets X to V[i], Y to C[i], and appends X-Y to the list. Finally, it prints the sum of the list.\n\nWait, the variables X and Y are set each time but their values are just V[i] and C[i], so they might be redundant. The key thing is that for each i where V[i]-C[i] is positive, that value is added to the list. The initial list is [0], so the sum is the sum of all positive (V[i]-C[i]) plus zero, which is just the total of all positive differences. \n\nHmm, maybe the code is calculating the sum of all (V[i] - C[i]) where that difference is positive. Because the list starts with 0, the sum would include all the valid positive differences added into the list. So, the logic is to compute the sum of (V[i]-C[i]) for each i where V[i] > C[i].\n\nNow translating this into C. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, in C, we need to read N from input. Then read N integers into V and N into C.\n\nIn Python, input().split() splits by whitespace, so in C I need to read each line, split the inputs. So perhaps using scanf for each element?\n\nWait, the inputs for V and C are given as space-separated strings. So in C, perhaps read the entire line with fgets and then parse each number?\n\nAlternatively, since in C, using scanf with %d might work if we can read each number from stdin. Let's think:\n\nFirst, read N with scanf(\"%d\", &N);.\n\nThen for V and C, since they are arrays of N elements each, we can read each element with a loop.\n\nBut in Python, there's a split(\" \") to split the input into parts. So in C, maybe for each element in V:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < N; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\nSame for C's elements. But input() in Python captures the entire line. So in C, after reading N, the next line for V would be something like:\n\nBut wait, in Python, after N, the next line is V's elements split by space, then the third line is C's elements. Or perhaps the code expects that V's elements are input in a single line, and C's in another line?\n\nThe original code's structure:\n\nV = input().split() --> so all V elements are on a single line, split by spaces.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nTherefore, in C, after reading N, the program must read a line with N integers for V, then another line with N integers for C.\n\nHmm. So using scanf with space-separated inputs.\n\nWait, maybe using:\n\nscanf(\" %d\", ...) each time, since after the first number, the next inputs might have leading spaces.\n\nAlternatively, using getchar() to eat newlines if necessary, but perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, read all the numbers in sequence. Let me see.\n\nLet me structure the steps:\n\nIn C, variables would be:\n\nint N;\n\nRead N with scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nThen read N numbers for the V array. Wait, in C, arrays need to be declared with fixed size. So if N can be up to some limit? Well, perhaps assuming that N is up to a certain size, but in code translation, perhaps making an array with size N. \n\nWait, but in C, you can dynamically allocate arrays with malloc, but maybe for the problem's constraints, it's better to have a maximum size. Alternatively, since it's code translation, perhaps use a static array with enough size. Let's think of the problem's constraints. The Python code doesn't set any, so maybe the C code can assume N is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, assuming N is up to say 10^5? But maybe in code translation, the code can read N first, then allocate arrays. So perhaps:\n\nint N;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nThen, after reading N, dynamically allocate arrays for V and C. \n\nBut in C, you can do:\n\nint *V = (int *) malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nSame for C.\n\nAlternatively, use fixed arrays of say 1e5 elements, but perhaps better to do dynamic allocation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the code step by step:\n\nThe code in Python reads N, then reads the next line as all the V elements, split into list, converted to integers. Then reads the C elements similarly.\n\nIn C, perhaps the V and C are read via:\n\nAfter reading N, read N integers from the next line for V, then read N integers for C.\n\nWait, but in C, the input is read as a stream. So after the first scanf for N, the next inputs would be the numbers for V, but they need to be read in N elements, then after finishing those, the next line (or next numbers) would be for C.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nRead N with scanf(\"%d\", &N); \n\nThen ignore the rest of that line, like by getting the newline with getchar() until the newline is read. But maybe not necessary, as scanf for %d would read the number and leave the newline, which may interfere with subsequent inputs.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps just:\n\nAfter reading N from the input, read N numbers into V, then read N numbers into C.\n\nBut the user's inputs for V and C are each given on their own lines. So maybe:\n\nAfter reading the first line (for N), the next line is all the V elements, and the next line is all the C elements.\n\nWait, in the Python code's code:\n\nAfter N = int(input()), then V = input().split() --> so that next input().split() gets the next line. So the V list comes from a line, and then the C list comes from another line.\n\nSo in C, the code would need to read the N, then read the next line (for V), then next line (for C).\n\nTherefore, the way to read the lines in C would be:\n\nRead the V line using something like fgets, then split into tokens. Similarly for C. \n\nAlternatively, using scanf with space-separated tokens in a buffer. \n\nHmm. Let's first decide the approach.\n\nFirst step: Read N.\n\nint N;\n\nif (scanf(\"%d\", &N) !=1) { ... error but assuming input is correct}\n\nThen read the inputs for V and C.\n\nSo for V, perhaps:\n\nint *V = (int*) malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0; i<N; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\nSimilarly for C:\n\nint *C = (int*) malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n\nfor(i=0; i<N; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &C[i]);\n\nBut the problem is that after N is read, the next inputs (for V and C) must be read here correctly.\n\nWait, in the Python code, after N is read, the next input is input() for V which is a line. So in C, after reading N, the rest of that line (if any) must be consumed, because the next call to scanf may have leftover newlines.\n\nHmm, so perhaps after reading N, we need to consume the new line.\n\nIn c:\n\nAfter scanf(\"%d\", &N), the next character could be a newline, so we can do:\n\nint c;\n\nwhile( (c=getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF);\n\nso that the next inputs read from the next line.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the user inputs, for example:\n\n3\n\n5 6 7\n\n2 3 4\n\nSo the first line is \"3\", then new line. The second line is the V's elements, then the third is C's.\n\nThen, using:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &N); --> reads the 3.\n\nThen, the next input line is the V's, so perhaps then read all V elements.\n\nSo, after reading N, perhaps we can read V via:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\nBut the first scanf after N may leave some newlines. Wait, actually, after entering the first number, the user may press enter, so the next input is the second line.\n\nIn this case, when you do scanf(\"%d\", &N), it reads '3' and leaves the '\\n' in the input buffer.\n\nThen, when starting to read the V elements, the first scanf would see the '\\n', which is not a number, so would fail?\n\nHmm. That could be a problem.\n\nSo to avoid that, after reading N, we should consume any remaining characters up to the newline. For example, as I thought before:\n\nAfter scanf(\"%d\", &N), we can use:\n\nwhile ( getchar() != '\\n' );\n\nso that any remaining characters on that line are consumed.\n\nSimilarly, after reading all V elements, perhaps we need to consume the newline? Maybe not, but it's better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to read the V and C elements as a whole line each time.\n\nHmm, using fgets may be more reliable.\n\nSo, here's an alternative approach:\n\nAfter reading N, read a line for V elements. Then split them into array.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N:\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nThen read a line for V.\n\nchar line_v[100000]; // assuming the line isn't too long. Wait, but how big can it be? Maybe use dynamically allocated buffer, but perhaps to keep it simple assume it's okay.\n\nfgets(line_v, sizeof(line_v), stdin);\n\nThen parse that into the V array. Split the string into tokens.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAlternatively, using sscanf to parse the tokens. But for that, perhaps:\n\nfor(i=0; i<N; i++) if (i==0) sscanf(..., else next)...\n\nAlternatively, use a pointer to the line and parse with strtok.\n\nHmm. Let me think: perhaps using a simplified version. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nIn C code:\n\nInitialize variables.\n\nint N;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nThen for V array:\n\nint *V = malloc( N * sizeof(int) );\n\nint i;\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\n}\n\nThen similarly for C.\n\nBut the problem is that after the initial N, there may be a space or newline following. Suppose the N is entered followed by a space and then the V list, but more likely, N is on its own line.\n\nWait, in Python code:\n\nThe code is:\n\nN is read as input(), then V is input().split(), then C is input().split(). So in user's input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n\n5 1 2\n\n3 4 0\n\nThen N is read as 3, then V is [5,1,2], and C is [3,4,0]\n\nIn C, after reading N via scanf, the next input would be the next line (the one starting with 5 1 2).\n\nBut in that case, if scanf is used again for the V array, then the next input would read that line.\n\nWait, each call to scanf will read numbers until it gets all of them here.\n\nWait, when the user's input for V is on a single line, separated by spaces, then the scanf for each V[i] would scan each integer in sequence. Given that, that approach might work.\n\nWait, the first scanf(\"%d\", &N) will read the '3', and leave the newline character. So then:\n\nThe first scanf for V[0] would read the next line, which contains 5 1 2 followed by a newline.\n\nSo the first scanf(\"%d\", &V[0]) would read 5, then next scanf would read 1, etc.\n\nSo the sequence works.\n\nYes, because the newline after 3 will be treated just like whitespace, so the next inputs read in the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as:\n\nAfter the initial N read, the code reads N integers for V, then N integers for C.\n\nWait, no, because the code reads the C elements from the next line. Wait the V's elements are read via the next line, then the next line is for C's elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps the loop for reading C is also needed.\n\nWait, the first loop for V's elements consumes all of them, then the next loop for C would read from the next line. So the order is correct.\n\nWait, for example, the code inputs would be:\n\n3 [enter]\n\n5 1 2 [enter]\n\n3 4 0 [enter]\n\nAfter the first scanf for N, the newline is there. Then the V loop proceeds to read the next numbers (5,1,2), which are all read from the second line, then the C loop reads from the third line.\n\nYes, so the code would work as follows.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nint N;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &N);\n\nV is an array of size N, read as:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++ ) scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n\nSame for C.\n\nNow, after that, we need to compute the sum of (V[i] - C[i]) where that difference is positive.\n\nBut in the Python code, they have a list starting with [0], and appending each (X-Y) when the difference is positive, then the sum is the total.\n\nIn C, the equivalent would be to compute a sum variable starting at 0 and adding (V[i]-C[i]) whenever it's positive.\n\nWait, in the Python code:\n\nlist = [0]\n\nThen, for each i in loop, if the difference >0, append (X-Y). So the total is sum(list) which is 0 plus all the positive differences.\n\nSo the final answer is the sum of all (V[i] -C[i]) where that is positive.\n\nThus, in C, the code can compute a sum variable initialized to 0, then loop for i from 0 to N-1, and if (V[i] - C[i] >0) sum += (V[i] - C[i]).\n\nThat's simpler, so in C, perhaps just:\n\nint sum=0;\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++){\n\n   if (V[i] - C[i]>0) sum += V[i] - C[i];\n\n}\n\nBut the original Python code appends to a list starting with zero, so adding 0 in the list and then the differences. So yes, sum would be equal to that.\n\nSo this is much more straightforward. The original code's list approach is extra, since the 0 doesn't affect the sum, plus each valid difference, so the total can be directly computed.\n\nThe Python code's use of X and Y is redundant since they are just V[i] and C[i], so we can skip that.\n\nTherefore, the correct algorithm is just sum the (V[i]-C[i] when positive), so the C code can do that without needing to manipulate arrays except for the input.\n\nThus, the problem can be solved with this approach, and the code would be simpler.\n\nHence, the code can be written as such.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo the entire code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &N);\n    \n    int *V = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n    int *C = malloc(N * sizeof(int));\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &V[i]);\n    }\n    for (int i=0; i < N; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &C[i]);\n    }\n    \n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i <N; i++) {\n        if (V[i] - C[i] > 0) {\n            sum += (V[i] - C[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", sum);\n    \n    free(V);\n    free(C);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, do I need to check the return of malloc?\n\nWell, in code translation for the purpose here, maybe it's okay to not handle errors as per the problem constraints (assuming inputs are valid).\n\nAlso, if the loops for V and C are correct.\n\nYes. However, note that in the second loop (for reading the C array), after reading all V elements, the next loop would read the next line's numbers.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose in the example input:\n\n3\n\n5 1 2\n\n3 4 0\n\nAfter reading N (3), the first loop for V will read 5,1,2 (from the next line). The second loop for C will read the next line's 3,4,0.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother note: Using %d in scanf can have issues with trailing characters, but assuming that inputs are correctly given.\n\nAnother thing: The initial C code uses V and C as the arrays. The code uses malloc to allocate them, then frees them at the end.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, in C99, variable length arrays can be used (if supported) but not all C standards may allow VLA.\n\nIf the code uses:\n\nint V[N], C[N];\n\nThen that would be allowed in C99 with variable length arrays, which might be acceptable, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps safer to use malloc.\n\nHence, the code as above should work.\n\nWait, but in the original Python code, the code does:\n\nlist = [0]\n\nans =0 \n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n   if ... then append ... \n\nThen sum(list).\n\nThe first element is 0, but the sum is same as the sum of all (V[i] - C[i] ) when positive.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus the C code should be correct.\n\nTesting example.\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n\n5 1 2\n\n3 4 0\n\nThe differences are:\n\n5-3=2 (positive)\n\n1-4 is negative, so not added.\n\n2-0 =2, added.\n\nTotal: 2+2=4. The code would output 4.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nN=2, V = [4, 3], C = [5,1]\n\nDiffs: 4-5 =-1 (no), 3-1=2 (yes). Sum is 2. Correct.\n\nHence the C code works."
