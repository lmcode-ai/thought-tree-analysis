So in the whoops part, when considering the 'a' lower case in s:\n\nSuppose 'a' is present in s, and 'A' is present in t but s has 'a's remaining. Then: the C code would check freqt[uppercase] which is 'A's count (assuming 'a' is the current character; uppercase is 'A'.

Thus, in C, the whoops section can proceed as I outlined earlier. Now, moving on code structure. First, read the two strings. We need to read S and T using fgets. The code in C should handle input. First:\n\nWe can declare buffers:\n\n#define MAX 100000 // assuming input won't be longer than that. char s[MAX];\nchar t[MAX];\n\nThen read the two lines:\n\nfgets(s, MAX, stdin);\nfgets(t, MAX, stdin);\n\nBut need to remove any newline character added by fgets. So after each read, we can do:\n\ns[strcspn(s, \"\\n\")] = 0; // remove trailing newline\nt[strcspn(t, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\nGood. Then, initialize freqs and freqt arrays. int freqs[256] = {0};\nint freqt[256] = {0};\n\nThen, for each char in s, increment freqs[ c ]:\n\nfor (int i =0; s[i]; i++) \n    freqs[ s[i] ]++;\n\nSimilarly for t:\n\nfor (int i=0; t[i]; i++)\n    freqt[ t[i] ]++;\n\nThen, process the 'yay' part. int yay =0;\nint whoops =0; \n\n// compute Yay:\n\nfor (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    if (freqs[c]>0 && freqt[c]>0) {\n        int take = (freqs[c]<freqt[c]) ? freqs[c] : freqt[c];\n        yay += take;\n        freqs[c] -= take;\n        freqt[c] -= take;\n    }\n} Then, the whoops part:\n\nfor (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    // process each character where s's remaining count is >0\n    while (freqs[c] >0) {\n        if (islower(c)) { \n            // uppercase counterpart:\n            int upper = toupper(c);\n            if (freqt[upper] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqs[c]--;\n                freqt[upper]--;\n            }\n            else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        else if (isupper(c)) {\n            // lowercase counterpart:\n            int lower = tolower(c);\n            if (freqt[lower] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqs[c]--;\n                freqt[lower]--;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            break; // non-letter, so can't be matched by case\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait but wait, in the original code's loops:\n\nThe whoops loop iterates over all keys in freqs's keys (the characters present in s), but in C's current code, we loop over every possible c, including control chars. For which the 'else' will break and exit the loop. Alternatively, for letters, the code proceeds. Wait the code 'c' loops from 0 to 255, and for each c, it enters the 'while (freqs[c]>0)'.",

Wait let me re-post the whoops loop as per previous thoughts. Let me re-structure the whoops part as follows:\n\nfor (c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n        // determine if this character can contribute to whoops via case conversion. if (islower(c)) {\n            int other = toupper(c);\n            if (freqt[other] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqt[other]--;\n                freqs[c]--;\n            } else {\n                break; // No more of other, can't take anymore, so stop trying for this c\n            }\n        } else if (isupper(c)) {\n            int other = tolower(c);\n            if (freqt[other] >0) { \n                whoops++;\n                freqt[other]--;\n                freqs[c]--;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        } else {\n            break; // not a letter, can't form a pair.  \n        }\n    }\n} This way, for each character c in frequencies for s:\n\nas long as we have at least one occurrence of c, we try to pair it with its case counterpart. Each iteration of the while loop takes one of the current c's count and the other's count. Thus, this mirroring the Python's while loop for each character. But wait, in the code above, 'while (freqs[c]>0)', each iteration of the loop, we may decrease freqs[c] by 1 (if the check succeeds), else break the loop. Thus for example, if we have 5 instances left of 'a', and the upper 'A' has 3, then 3 steps will occur, so three pairs. Then the upper 'A' is exhausted and the loop. So the loop would run 3 times (breaking after that). Thus correctly takes 3. Yes.",

In the inner loop for the 'upper case' part:\n\nInside the while loop (freqs[c]>0), for 'c' being uppercase:\n\nwe have:\n\nelse if (isupper(c)) {\n\n    int lower = ... if freqt[lower] >0 ...? \n\n    then:\n\n    ... \n\n    else { break }\n\n} \n\nThe problem is the 'else' after the uppercase check is one level maybe missing. Wait in code: if (islower(c)) {\n            // ... \n        } else if (isupper(c)) {\n            ...\n            } else { // This case, else on the if (is upper ...) ?? Wait no. Let me rewrite that section with proper indentation. Inside the while loop (freqs[c] ...>0)\n\n{\n\n    if ( islower(c) ) {\n\n        ... \n\n    else if ( isupper(c) ){\n\n        ... \n\n    } else {\n\n        // not a letter. break;\n\n    }\n\n} Ah right, the code should be:\n\n            // inside while (freqs[c] >0 block ) if (islower(c)) {\n                int upper = toupper(c);\n                if (freqt[upper] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[upper]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else if (isupper(c)) {\n                int lower = tolower(c); if (freqt[lower] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[lower]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else {  // non letter, break loop\n                break;  // so that we do not consider this character again\n            }\n} Ah right! In my code above, I missed the closing brace for the else if part. The current code has after 'else if...' has a closing '}' before the else, which may be off. Let me rework the code section:\n\n        while (freqs[c] >0) { \n\n            if (islower(c)) { \n                ... \n            } else if (isupper(c)) { \n                ... \n            } else { \n                break;\n            } \n\n        // here \n\n        } Thus, after the if statements, the 'else' is for non-letters (thus, break the loop, so no further iterations). Thus correcting the code:\n\nLooking back at the code for whoops part:\n\n    for (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\n        while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n            if (islower(c)) {\n                int upper = toupper(c);\n                if (freqt[upper] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[upper]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else if (isupper(c)) {\n                int lower = tolower(c);\n                if (freqt[lower] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[lower]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    } Ah, that is correct. I think that's the correct code.",

Wait in the example:\n\ns = 'a', t = 'A'\n\nIn C code:\n\nthe 'A' in freqt's array started at 1, so after processing, the 'whoops' part, after the first loop (yay), the uppercase A's count was 1 (since during the first loop's 'yay' processing, the character 'a' (lower) was processed, and A was not part of 'a's first loop (since 'a' is not same as 'A').

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Python code to C. Hmm, the Python code seems to be dealing with two strings, s and t. Then it counts the frequency of each character in both, and does some operations to calculate yay and whoops, which are integers.\n\nFirst step: Understanding what the Python does. Let's read through the code again. \n\nThe code starts by taking two inputs, s and t. Then it creates two frequency dictionaries, freqs and freqt. For each character in s, it counts how many times they appear, same for t. \n\nAfter that, there's a loop over all the keys in freqs. It uses a while loop to check if both freqs[letra] and freqt[letra] are positive, and if so, it increments yay and decreases both counts. That part seems to be counting the common characters between the two strings, right? So for each character present in both, the minimum of their counts contributes to yay. The while loop might be handling that by decrementing until one of them runs out.\n\nThen the next part is the 'whoops' part. It loops over freqs again. For each remaining character in freqs, it looks for the opposite case (like lowercase vs uppercase) in freqt. So if there's a lower case letter left in s's freqs and the uppercase version is present in t's remaining freqt, then they can pair up but that counts as a whoops. The same check for uppercase characters. Again, it's a while loop decreasing as possible.\n\nThe final output is the yay and whoops counts.\n\nNow, translating to C. Hmm, in C, we don't have dictionaries. So we need an alternative way to track character frequencies. The easy way would be to use arrays, since ASCII characters can be mapped to indices. Let's remember that there are 256 possible ASCII characters, so we can make arrays of size 256, with indexes representing each possible ASCII character.\n\nFirst, the input. In Python, input() reads a line from stdin. In C, we can use fgets to read strings. However, note that we might need to read until the end of the line. Let me think about handling that.\n\nWait, in C, we need to be careful with buffer sizes. Let's assume that the input strings are not too long. We can perhaps define an array of sufficient size. Alternatively, check with the problem constraints. Maybe the code expects that the strings can be read via fgets with a buffer of, say, 1000 characters each, but we need to make sure the buffer is big enough. Alternatively, the code can read until EOF, but since two lines are inputted, maybe the code reads two lines with fgets.\n\nSo, steps for translation:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- The two strings s and t. So declared as char arrays with maximum possible size. Let's say s[100001] and t[100001] maybe.\n\nThen, the frequency arrays. Let's see:\n\nfreqs and freqt can be arrays of integers, size 256, initialized to zero. So:\n\nint freqs[256] = {0};\nint freqt[256] = {0};\n\nNext, for loops:\n\nThe first loop for counting frequencies:\n\nfor each character in s: for (i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) { freqs[s[i]] +=1; }\n\nSame for t.\n\nThen the 'yay' loop. The problem states that for letters present in both, take min(freqs, freqt) and add to Yay. Wait, but the Python code's loop seems to do this through a while loop, decrementing both each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe For each character, the contributions to yay is the minimum of freqs[c] and freqt[c]. Then, after that, subtract that minimum from both to get what's left for the whoops.\n\nWait, in the Python code, for the yay loop: They loop while freqs[letra] >0 and freqt[letra] >0. Each time inside the while, they subtract 1 from both and add 1 to yay. So that's equivalent to adding the minimum of freqs and freqt, and subtracting that. \n\nSo perhaps better to compute min(freqs[c], freqt[c]) for each c, sum that as yay. Then subtract those amounts from both arrays.\n\nBut in the C code, looping through all possible characters would be the way. \n\nWait, the Python code loops through the keys in freqs. So, in C, we need to loop through all possible characters (0-255), or just the ones present in freqs? \n\nHmm, to be accurate, in Python's loop over 'for letra in freqs.keys()', so each key present in freqs (so letters that existed in s). So in C, we have to loop through all characters where freqs[c] is >0, then proceed. Therefore, maybe that can be done with a for loop from c=0 to 255, then check if freqs[c] >0.\n\nAlternatively, to limit to only characters present in s. But in C, perhaps better to just loop all possible 256 characters, and process those entries where freqs[c]>0.\n\nSo for the first loop (computing yay):\n\nfor (c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\n    int count = 0;\n    if (freqs[c] >0 && freqt[c] >0) {\n        count = min(freqs[c], freqt[c]);\n        yay += count;\n        freqs[c] -= count;\n        freqt[c] -= count;\n    }\n}\n\nWait but in Python, the original code is a while loop, but the min approach is equivalent, so this might be better in terms of loops. That's better than looping while, which is O(N) but min is O(1). \n\nWait but for code equivalence, maybe the original code's way is not exactly min. For example, if the loop is for a key in freqs, which are characters in s. For each such character, the 'yay' contribution is the minimum between freqs and freqt, then subtract that from both. Then that's correct. Because in the Python code, it's decrementing both until one runs out. So effectively, the same as adding the minimum and subtracting.\n\nThus maybe better to proceed in that way in C.\n\nThen, the whoops part.\n\nThe whoops code: \n\nLoop over remaining characters in freqs (the ones not fully used up in the first pass). Then for each such c in freqs, look at its opposite case, and see if that exists in freqt (which is maybe left over from the first step).\n\nWait, let's think again:\n\nThe Python code after first step (yay) has the freqs and freqt reduced by the minimums. The second part (whoops) then looks for, say, a lowercase character in freqs still left, and its uppercase equivalent in freqt's remaining counts.\n\nWait, the 'whoops' loop:\n\nFirst, for each letra in freqs.keys() (since we loop through all keys in the first for loop):\n\nThen for each such letter, while there are remaining instances of it in freqs:\n\nSo, for a given c in frequencies, if it is lowercase, check if the uppercase version exists in freqt with count>0, and then can combine, which reduces both by 1, and count whoops.\n\nWait, the code's logic:\n\nif letra is lowercase: check if 'letra.upper()' is in freqt and its count is positive. So, for example, if 'a' has remaining in freqs, and 'A' has some remaining in freqt, then one pair can be counted as a whoops (so both their counts go down).\n\nSimilarly for uppercase: if the current character is uppercase (and still has occurrences left in freqs), check if lowercase version is in freqt's count.\n\nWait, in C, we can do this by checking the lowercase or uppercase version's ASCII code.\n\nLet me think in C terms.\n\nWe can loop through each character c in the freqs array where freqs[c] >0.\n\nWait for each character c in s's remaining (so freqs[c]>0):\n\n   if it's lowercase, (c is 'a' to 'z'), check if freqt[U] >0, where U is uppercase version (c - 'a' + 'A'):\n\n   if yes, then subtract 1 from both, and add to whoops.\n\n   else if it's uppercase and lowercase exists in freqt, same idea?\n\nAlternatively, in the current implementation, it's structured as:\n\nfor each c in freqs's keys (all characters present in s):\n\n    while freqs[c] >0:\n\n        see if appropriate opposite case (if applicable) has remaining in freqt.\n\n        So for example:\n\n        if the current c is a lowercase character (c is between 'a' and 'z'):\n\n            check if freqt has (c_upper), which is 123 to 91 steps (like c & ~32 maybe?)\n\n            then, while that count is >0:\n\n                take one of each, increment whoops and decrement both.\n\n        else if uppercase, check lowercase.\n\n        else (no case: like symbols or uppercase not paired?), break.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn C, looping through all c (0-255):\n\nfor (c=0; c <256; c++) {\n\n    // process only if current freqs has count remaining.\n\n    while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n\n        if (islower(c)) {\n\n            // look for uppercase of c:\n\n            char up = toupper(c);\n\n            if (freqt[up] >0) {\n\n                whoops++;\n\n                freqs[c]--;\n\n                freqt[up]--;\n\n            } else {\n\n                break; // can't match anymore. \n\n            }\n\n        } else if (isupper(c)) {\n\n            char low = tolower(c);\n\n            if (freqt[low] >0) {\n\n                whoops++;\n\n                freqs[c]--;\n\n                freqt[low]--;\n\n            } else {\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        } else {\n\n            break; // non-letter? Doesn't contribute, so break the loop for this c.\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait no, maybe not exactly. Let me see the Python code for the whoops loop:\n\nIn Python:\n\nfor letra in freqs.keys():\n\n    while (freqs[letra] >0):\n\n        if letra.islower() and (letra.upper() in freqt and freqt[letra.upper()] >0):\n\n            whoops +=1\n\n            freqs[letra] -=1\n\n            freqt[letra.upper()] -=1\n\n        elif...\n\n        else:\n\n            break\n\nAh, the Python code inside the 'if' checks two things for the lowercase case:\n\n1. The uppercase version is a key in freqt (which is just whether freqt has count >0 for that char).\n\nWait but in the Python code, 'letra.upper()' in freqt checks whether there was ever a frequency (could be zero?), but after first loop, the freqt would have the remaining counts (if we did the frequency loop correctly). Wait, no, in the first loop, the code that counts yay is decrementing both, so the freqt for uppercase A would have the remaining after the first loop, so checking that 'freqt[uppercase]' is >0.\n\nBut in the C code's current approach, we process all the characters where the original 'freqs' has remaining. \n\nWait, but the code for whoops:\n\nIn Python's approach, the loop for letra in freqs.keys():\n\n    loops while some conditions are met, so the 'while' loop for each character in the 'letra' can continue until that character cannot contribute more.\n\nWait the loop is for each letra, while freqs[letra] >0, and see if there is a possible match:\n\nSo, for a given letra in s's characters, it starts decrementing while there is a possibility.\n\nSo in C, we can loop through all characters in the freqs array (0-255), and For each c (using a for loop over 256), then while there are remaining counts in freqs, see if applicable conditions are met:\n\nWait maybe better code structure for the whoops loop in C:\n\n   for (int c =0; c < 256; c++) {\n       while (freqs[c] >0) { // as long as current c in freqs has remaining counts\n           // check the possibilities\n           if (islower(c)) { // lowercase c\n               char other = toupper(c); // uppercase version of c\n               if (freqt[other] >0) { // check if in freqt there is any remaining of the uppercase\n                   whoops++;\n                   freqs[c]--;\n                   freqt[other]--;\n               } else {\n                   break; // can't find pair, so stop processing this character\n               }\n           } else if (isupper(c)) {\n               char other = tolower(c);\n               if (freqt[other] >0) { // check if lowercase is present here.\n                   whoops++;\n                   freqs[c]--;\n                   freqt[other]--;\n               } else {\n                   break;\n               }\n           } else { // non-letter? Not to be processed further\n               break;\n           }\n       } \n   }\n\nWait but does this cover the same conditions as the Python code?\n\nIn Python's code, in the first condition (letra.islower) it checks whether 'upper is in freqt's keys and freqt[upper]>0. \n\nWait, because in Python, the 'freqt' is a dictionary that includes entries even if the count is zero. Because in the first loop, the while loop may have reduced the freqt counts. For example, suppose in the original t, the freqt had say, some characters which are now zero. So, the check 'if letra.upper() in freqt' is redundant, because the keys in freqt may include all characters, including those with count zero. Wait no, in Python's first loop, the first part: for letra in t's characters initially, so when building freqt, each character is added, even if it only occurs once. So even after the first loop, if the count reaches zero, it's still in freqt but with zero. So when checking 'if letra.upper() in freqt' is True always, so that check is implicit, so perhaps in the code the condition could be 'freqt[letra.upper()]>0'.\n\nWait, the Python code for the letters in the 'if' parts: the 'islower' case checks:\n\nif (letra in freqs, which we are iterating, and then it is in lowercase), then check 'letra.upper() in freqt' (which is always true? Not sure.)\n\nWait no, for example: if t didn't contain any 'A's, then uppercase 'A' would not be a key in the original freqt. But after the first loop. So perhaps we need to check whether 'freqt has that letter's uppercase in its keys.\n\nWait but the freqt is built by counting all letters in t. So even if t had no 'A's, 'A' isn't present as a key in freqt. So when considering a lowercase 'a', in the 'freqt has U,A's count zero? No, because the original freqt keys are only those present in t.\n\nAh so in Python's code, the check for 'upper in freqt' (whether the key exists), because otherwise freqt[upper] would be undefined. Therefore, the first condition is:\n\nletra is lowercase and (exists in freqt's keys) uppercase and freqt has that key with count>0.\n\nWait no, the code in Python: first, check:\n\nif letra.islower() and (letra.upper() in freqt) and (freqt[letra.upper()] >0):\n\nWait yes, that's exactly what the conditions are. So the code ensures that the uppercase version (when dealing with a lowercase letra) is present in the freqt (i.e., at least one count initially in t), but also that its remaining count is still above zero.\n\nSo, in C, the freqt array is initialized at zero for all, and then incremented for each occurrence in t. So after the first loop (the first for loop for the 'yay') any count in freqt for a character is either:\n\ncount original t_count minus the amount taken in the first pass (the denominator for 'yay'). But freqt has the remaining counts. \n\nWait, in the first part, the yay loop is subtracting from both freqs and freqt for the same character. For example, if the current character c is present in both, so the min between s and t counts is removed from both, with the difference remaining in each. \n\nTherefore, in the whoops part, the freqt array would have those remaining counts, and thus for checking whether, say, 'A' exists, you need to check that freqt has a remaining count, even if it was originally present. \n\nWait, let me think: for the 'letra.upper() in freqt' condition in Python code's first part of the whoops loop, the existence check is required because, say, maybe 'a' in s but 'T' in t hadn't any 'A's. So we need to check that 'A' was present in t at least once (so it's a key in freqt). Otherwise, the letter isn't present at all. But in C, the freqt array would have been initialized to zero for any character not present in t. So 'letra.upper()' is not in freqt's keys corresponds to freqt[that character] being zero.\n\nWait, in C, the 'freqt' array contains the remaining counts after first loop, and initially those counts were built by the initial read of t, so even if that character wasn't in t, it will have a zero. \n\nTherefore, in order to check whether the uppercase of a lowercase letter (like 'a' being the current c) is present in the freqt's keys (i.e., whether there was at least one occurrence in t), that's not necessary because it can have a residual count. Wait no, the 'present in freqt's keys' in Python would mean that initially, t had that character. So, in C, the proper way to check whether there exists a residual count in the 'upper case' is simply to check if freqt[upper] >0.\n\nWait in the first condition of the whoops part in Python, the code checks:\n\nletra.islower() and (letra.upper() in freqt) and (freqt[letra.upper()] >0):\n\nBecause in Python, if t didn't have any 'A's, then 'A' is not in freqt's keys, so that first part (letra.upper() in freqt) will be false, so the condition becomes false. Therefore, in C, we can't just check the count being >0. Because perhaps the key was never there. For example, even if some counts were reduced: but if t's freqt for uppercase 'A' was zero, then even if before it was 5, but now it's zero, we can't use it. \n\nWait, but the 'freqt' array's count for that character may have been zero even initially (if it wasn't present in t). \n\nWait in the code:\n\nThe 'freqt' array in C is initialized to all zeros. So when we process the t string, each character in t is incremented in freqt. So any character not in the t would have a zero, even after that initial loop.\n\nThus, the existence in the keys (in Python) is equivalent to freqt[character] >0 at the start (before the first loop). Wait no:\n\nWait in the first loop:\n\nThe first loop in the Python code is counting frequencies. So any occurrence of 'A' in t would have been added to the 'A' key. The first loop, 'yay' loop, may have reduced it, but even if the residual is zero, the key 'A' is still present in freqt, and 'freqt.get(A,0) would exist. So in Python, that key remains, but with zero count. But in the condition, 'letra.upper() in freqt'? Yes. So the first condition is redundant? Maybe the code has it there for a reason, but perhaps in effect, only the count matters. \n\nWait in the Python code:\n\n       if letra.islower() and letra.upper() in freqt and freqt[letra.upper()] >0:\n\nso the check if the uppercase is even present in freqt (i.e., that there was at least one instance in t of that uppercase letter). But perhaps the code is correct without that: just checking that the count is >0 would suffice, because if the count were zero, then 'freqt[letra.upper()]>0' would be false. \n\nWait but 'freqt' (dictionary) holds zero entries for characters not present. So if 'A' is not in freqt's keys, trying to access 'freqt[A]' would raise KeyError.\n\nWait that's a mistake! Wait Python's dict: if the key is not present, then accessing it would throw an error. Therefore the code in the first condition must first verify that the key exists in the freqt, to avoid KeyError.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nThe line: if letra islower() and (letra.upper() in freqt) and freqt[letra.upper()]>0:\n\nThe first 'letra.upper() in freqt' is a protection against KeyError. Therefore, in C, since the array has entries for all possible characters, even those with 0 counts, perhaps the check is not necessary. Wait in C, to check if the 'uppercase' had any occurrence in the original t. Because even if it had been in t but its count was reduced to zero by the first loop, does that matter?\n\nIn C, the count is stored in the array. The question is whether any occurrence was possible.\n\nWait in the case of, say, uppercase 'A' in freqt. Suppose that in t, there was an 'A' (so originally, freqt[A] was at least 1), but in the first 'yay' loop, if s had 'A' and they were max'd down to 0:\n\nWait: no, the 'yay' loop in Python is looping over each character that was in the first freqs (from s). So if s doesn't have 'A', then A isn't considered in the first loop. So if t had 'A's but s didn't, so the freqs[A] was zero, then in the first loop, for the 'A' key, only the part in freqs[A] is checked. \n\nWait, the 'yay' loop in Python loops over all keys in freqs (the s's characters). So, if s doesn't have any 'A's, then the 'A' in t isn't considered in the first yay loop. Therefore , the 'yay loop' doesn't touch the A count in freqt. So if t has an 'A', then after the first loop, freqt[A] has the original count (since s didn't contribute to that character. So in the whoops part, when considering the 'a' lower case in s:\n\nSuppose 'a' is present in s, and 'A' is present in t but s has 'a's remaining.\n\nThen: the C code would check freqt[uppercase] which is 'A's count (assuming 'a' is the current character; uppercase is 'A'. \n\nThus the condition in Python requires that in T there was at least one 'A' (so freqt had the key), but after first loop, it might still have a count. \n\nBut in C code, since the freqt array has the original count minus any used (in first loop), and the first loop would have touched 'A's only if s had 'A's. \n\nWait, in C, I can first compute the 'yay' correctly, then the 'whoops' can be computed by looking at the remaining counts. But to replicate the 'letra.upper() in freqt' check in Python (preventing KeyError), in C, the equivalent of 'the letter's uppercase ever existed in T' is freqt[upper] >=1 before the first loop. \n\nBut we don't track that. Since in C the array may have entries but some are 0, we can't track that, which could lead to possible discrepancies for those characters that originally were in t but got reduced to zero. \n\nHmm. Therefore in Python, the 'letra.upper() in freqt' is really checking that at least one occurrence existed in t. Because otherwise, freqt wouldn't have the key.\n\nIn the C code, when handling a character like 'a' (lowercase) we can't tell whether the 'A' was ever present in t, unless we can track the original counts. But the current approach only tracks the residual counts.\n\nWait because:\n\nSuppose t had 'A's (count 2), then in the first loop, if s had 'A's, let's say s has count 3, then the min is 2, so after first loop, freqt[A] is 0, but the key was present in T. So for 'a' (the lowercase), then the C code would check the uppercase count (0) and decide not to count. That's correct, since after the first loop, there is nothing left. \n\nAlternatively, suppose T had no 'A's, so original freqt[A] is 0. Then 'A' was never a key in freqt (since it's built by counting t's characters), so the 'letra.upper() in freqt' would be false. Thus, the code doesn't proceed.\n\nSo in C, for the equivalent check, 'letra.upper() in freqt' is equivalent to (freqt[upper] has any count, i.e, original count before first loop). \n\nWait no. Because 'freqt[upper]'s current count could be 0 even if it was present, but it was reduced. We can't track whether it was present before first loop. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nIn the Python code's whoops condition, the first 'islower' part's first condition must ensure that the uppercase form is one that was present in t at least once, so that when it checked, even if it's now reduced to zero? Or not?\n\nWait let's think of an example:\n\nCase 1:\n\ns has 'a', t has 'A'.\n\nSo the first loop (yay's case, since both letters are in s and t. So 'A's count in t? Are we looking at 'a' in s and the 'A' in t?\n\nWait wait, 'letra' is iterating over keys in 'freqs', so which are the characters in s. \n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of an example.\n\nSuppose s is 'a', and t is 'A'.\n\nThen, the first loop:\n\nFirst, for the yay:\n\nlooking at each letra in s (only 'a'):\n\nthe first loop will look at freqs['a'] and freqt['a'].\n\nBut in t, since 'A' is in t, the original 'a' in the freqt (from t's characters, since t's characters include 'A' but not 'a', so the freqt['A'] would be 1, but freqt['a'] is 0. \n\nWait, so 'a' is not in freqt's keys. So when the code for the first loop (yay's loop):\n\nthe first loop in the code for yay runs 'for letter in letters in freqs' (s's characters), 'a' is there. But in freqt, 'a' is 0, so no contribution. \n\nSo first loop (yay's processing for 'a') won't do anything, since freqt['a'] is 0. \n\nThus, the 'yay' remains zero. \n\nThen the whoops loop: \n\nLooking at the 'a' (lowercase) in s's keys. \n\nThen, in the whoops loop: \n\nTesting whether 'A' is in freqt's keys (since 'A's count is 1 (before any first loop processing?), but in the first loop, did anything happen to A? \n\nWait in the first loop (the yay's loop), 'A' would only be considered as a letra if it was present in s. In this case, s has 'a', so A is not in s's keys, so it is not examined in the first loop. So the first loop leaves frequencies as such:\n\nAfter initial counting:\n\nfreqs['a'] is 1.\n\nfreqt has: freqt['A'] is 1, others zero. \n\nIn first loop (yay's loop):\n\nprocessing each character in s's keys (only 'a').\n\nSo the 'a' is checked against freqt's 'a' (which is zero). So no change. \n\nThus, in the whoops loop, for the 'a' (in freqs):\n\nThe code checks islower('a') is true. Then look at 'letra.upper() is 'A', which is in the keys of freqt (since t had an 'A') so 'A' is in freqt's keys. \n\nfreqt['A'] is 1 (since the first loop didn't touch it, because the first loop didn't process 'A' as a key from s. So, in this case, the conditions are true (freqt[A] is 1), so the whoops is incremented. \n\nThe counts become freqs['a'] becomes 0, freqt['A'] 0. \n\nThus, the total is Yay 0, whoops 1. \n\nIn C code, for this scenario:\n\nThe first loop (yay):\n\nOnly the 'a' in s's frequencies (1), and the 'a's freqt is 0. So nothing happens to Yay. \n\nThen the whoops loop:\n\nProcessing 'a': \n\nislower is yes. \n\nfind 'A' (uppercase). \n\ncurrent freqt[A] is 1, so yes. \n\nThus the code would proceed to add to whoops. \n\nTherefore the C code would seemingly work for this case. \n\nWait, but what if the case where:\n\nSuppose t had an uppercase 'A', and s has 'a's, but after first loop (yay) A's freqt count was decreased. \n\nWait, let's think of s is 'a', t is 'Aa'.\n\nThen, s's 'a' has 1, t's 'A' is 1, 'a' is 1. \n\nFirst loop (yay) over 'a' in s's key:\n\nCheck freqt['a'] has count 1 (from the lowercase in t). So for 'a', the minimum between 1 (s) and 1 (t's a's) is 1. So yay +=1. Both counts become zero. \n\nNow, moving to the whoops loop: \n\nNow 'a' has count 0 in freqs. \n\nThus the whoops loop does nothing for that. \n\nWhat about the 'A' in t's counts? The first loop's other keys (if any)... Well the first loop only processed the keys in 'freqs', so 'A' wasn't a key in s (since s has 'a' only), so in first loop, 'A' is not processed. So the 'A's count in freqt remains 1 (because we didn't touch it).\n\nThen, in whoops loop, the 'A' in t is 1, but 's' has no 'A's. So the only opportunity for whoops comes from s's uppercase letters (but there are none). \n\nHence, no whoops. \n\nThus the total is yay =1, whoops=0. So that's correct. \n\nThe example shows that the C code can handle the conditions as per the Python code. \n\nAnother example where the frequency in T for upper case is originally present but first loop reduces to zero. \n\nExample: s is 'AAA', t is 'A', so:\n\nFirst, freqs['A']=3, freqt['A'] = 1.\n\nYay loop:\n\nsince 'A' is in s's keys, check freqt['A'] is 1.\n\nmin(3 and 1 is 1). Yay is 1. \n\nSo freqs[A] becomes 2, freqt[A] 0.\n\nThen in whoops:\n\nprocessing 'A' (uppercase). \n\nCheck if it is uppercase \u2192 isupper is true. \n\nThen look for lowercase 'a' in freqt. However, in the freqt, 'a's count is zero. \n\n Wait, first loop has not touched 'a'.\n\nThus, for this scenario:\n\nThe uppercase 'A' has freqs[A] 2, but 'a' in t is 0 (since t has no 'a's). So when processing 'A' in the whoops loop:\n\nisupper \u2192 yes. \n\nthen low = 'a' (lowercase). \n\nwe check freqt of 'a's count, which is zero. \n\nThus, can't add to whoops. \n\nThus, whoops zero. So total is Yay=1, whoops=0. \n\nIn the Python code:\n\nIn the whoops part, processing 'A' (uppercase):\n\nchecking if freqt has 'a'? Because in the first code:\n\nthe code for uppercase letters in the whoops part:\n\nletra is 'A', uppercase. Then look for lowercase: 'a'. \n\nFirst, check if 'letra.lower()' is in freqt's keys. \n\nSince in T there was no 'a's originally, 'a' isn't in freqt's keys. So the condition for uppercase (second elif):\n\nletra.isupper() and (lowercase in freqt) and its count>0:\n\nsince 'a' not in freqt's keys \u2192 False. \n\nThus no whoops. \n\nWhich is what the C code does, since in the C code, freqt['a'] is zero, since nowhere present. \n\nThus, this case is okay. \n\nHmm, so what was the problem? I think the original code in Python requires checking whether the key exists in freqt (i.e., the character was present in T at least once) in order to prevent KeyError. \n\nIn C, the freqt array has counts, even for characters never present (they have zero). Therefore, the 'existence' check (like 'letra.upper() in freqt') is equivalent to checking whether freqt's original count for that character was at least one? \n\nBut in our current approach, we can't track the original counts, only the remaining. So the code will proceed even if the key existed but is now at zero. \n\nWait in the example:\n\ns = 'a', t = 'A'\n\nIn C code:\n\nthe 'A' in freqt's array started at 1, so after processing, the 'whoops' part, after the first loop (yay), the uppercase A's count was 1 (since during the first loop's 'yay' processing, the character 'a' (lower) was processed, and A was not part of 'a's first loop (since 'a' is not same as 'A'). Thus 'A's count remains 1. So in whoops loop, that allows pairing. \n\nThus, C code's condition is correct. \n\nAnother scenario:\n\nIf t had 'B' (uppercase) initially, but s's 'b's were processed in the first loop. \n\nWait, maybe there's a scenario where the uppercase was in t but was later set to zero. \n\nSuppose s has 'b' with count 5, t has 'B' with count 3. \n\nThen during first loop (the 'yay') since:\n\nfor 'b' in s's keys, we check 'b' in freqt? Wait, no, t's freqt 'b' is zero (if T had 'B's and no lowercase 'b's). So 'b's in s would look for their own 'b' in freqt. If there were none, they don't contribute to Yay. But the 'B's in T's case are only counted when a 'B' is processed in the s's loop (only if s has a 'B'). \n\nThus, in that scenario, the 'B' in T's uppercase is still there. \n\nWait, but if T had 'B', s has 'b', and in first loop:\n\nThe 'b's entry in t's counts is zero. So first loop doesn't process 'B's count. \n\n Thus, in the 'b' (lowercase) in whoops loop, check upper case 'B' (uppercase B), and if it has a count remaining, then process it. \n\nThus, the code seems correct. \n\nTherefore, in C code, the key thing is to check the current counts, not whether the key ever existed in the original T. Because, even if 'B' was in T, and now its count is zero after first loop, the code would not count it. Because the code only looks at current freqt[uppercase] after the first loop. \n\nThe original check in Python of 'upper in freqt' (key existence) is equivalent to (original count of uppercase >0), so after any first loop processing, if the residual is 0, the code would skip. \n\nWait, the key existence in the original freqt is equivalent to having originally some count. So, in C, the check would need to know if that character was in the original freqt. To capture the key existence, we can track whether any count (even after the first loop) is >0, but maybe that's not sufficient. \n\nWait no, because after first loop, if the original count was 5, but first loop used 3, the count is 2, so key existed. \n\nBut his is already captured since in that scenario, the freqt count would be 2>0 so the code proceeds. \n\nAlternatively, if the original count was 5, and first loop used all (count 5), then freqt[B] is 0, so:\n\nIn whoops loop's check, 'B's current count is 0. The original 'B' was present. But in the whoops condition, we need B to have >0 now. \n\nSo the code correctly doesn't count it. \n\nThus the problem's 'key existence' is a red herring. Because even if the key was present but the count is zero, the condition (freqt[...]>0) is false. \n\nThus, the whoops loops can be written in C without an 'exists' check, since the 'freqt[other]>0' is sufficient. \n\nThus, in C, the whoops section can proceed as I outlined earlier. \n\nNow, moving on code structure.\n\nFirst, read the two strings. \n\nWe need to read S and T using fgets. The code in C should handle input. \n\nFirst:\n\nWe can declare buffers:\n\n#define MAX 100000 // assuming input won't be longer than that.\n\nchar s[MAX];\nchar t[MAX];\n\nThen read the two lines:\n\nfgets(s, MAX, stdin);\nfgets(t, MAX, stdin);\n\nBut need to remove any newline character added by fgets. \n\nSo after each read, we can do:\n\ns[strcspn(s, \"\\n\")] = 0; // remove trailing newline\nt[strcspn(t, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\nGood. \n\nThen, initialize freqs and freqt arrays. \n\nint freqs[256] = {0};\nint freqt[256] = {0};\n\nThen, for each char in s, increment freqs[ c ]:\n\nfor (int i =0; s[i]; i++) \n    freqs[ s[i] ]++;\n\nSimilarly for t:\n\nfor (int i=0; t[i]; i++)\n    freqt[ t[i] ]++;\n\nThen, process the 'yay' part. \n\nint yay =0;\nint whoops =0; \n\n// compute Yay:\n\nfor (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    if (freqs[c]>0 && freqt[c]>0) {\n        int take = (freqs[c]<freqt[c]) ? freqs[c] : freqt[c];\n        yay += take;\n        freqs[c] -= take;\n        freqt[c] -= take;\n    }\n}\n\nThen, the whoops part:\n\nfor (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    // process each character where s's remaining count is >0\n    while (freqs[c] >0) {\n        if (islower(c)) { \n            // uppercase counterpart:\n            int upper = toupper(c);\n            if (freqt[upper] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqs[c]--;\n                freqt[upper]--;\n            }\n            else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        else if (isupper(c)) {\n            // lowercase counterpart:\n            int lower = tolower(c);\n            if (freqt[lower] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqs[c]--;\n                freqt[lower]--;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            break; // non-letter, so can't be matched by case\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait but wait, in the original code's loops:\n\nThe whoops loop iterates over all keys in freqs's keys (the characters present in s), but in C's current code, we loop over every possible c, including control chars. For which the 'else' will break and exit the loop. \n\nAlternatively, for letters, the code proceeds. \n\nWait the code 'c' loops from 0 to 255, and for each c, it enters the 'while (freqs[c]>0)'.\n\nIn the Python code's whoops, it's looping over the keys of s's freqs (so c is only those characters with freqcounts> before first loop?\n\nWait the first loop (yay) may have reduced the freqs[c], so after the yay loop, even characters present in s (but their freqs were reduced to zero) won't be processed in whoops. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the code loops over all c in the 256. \n\nOther notes:\n\nThe 'toupper' and 'tolower' functions convert characters. \n\nAlso, 'islower' is part of standard C, so the code should include <ctype.h>.\n\nWait the code should #include the required headers.\n\nSo in the C code, we need to include:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h> // for strcspn\n#include <ctype.h>  // for isupper, islower, toupper, tolower\n\nThe code structure.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nmain() {\n\n    char s[MAX], t[MAX];\n    fgets(s, MAX, stdin);\n    s[strcspn(s, \"\\n\")] =0;\n    fgets(t, MAX, stdin);\n    t[strcspn(t, \"\\n\")] =0;\n\n    int freqs[256]= {0};\n    int freqt[256] = {0};\n\n    int i;\n    for (i=0; s[i]; i++)\n        freqs[s[i]]++;\n    for (i=0; t[i]; i++) \n        freqt[t[i]]++; \n\n    int yay=0, whoops=0;\n\n    for (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n        if (freqs[c]>0 && freqt[c] >0) {\n            int take = (freqs[c]<freqt[c]) ? freqs[c]: freqt[c];\n            yay += take;\n            freqs[c] -= take;\n            freqt[c] -= take;\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int c=0; c<256; c++) {\n        while (freqs[c]-- >0) { \n            // wait no, the 'while' needs to be based on freqs[c]>0. \n\n            // Hmm, in code, I need to loop while freqs[c] still have counts.\n\n            // The way I had before, while (freqs[c] >0) ... but then we have to check conditions. But in code iteration.\n\n            // so need to loop as:\n\n       while (freqs[c] >0) { \n\n            ... \n\n            but must be careful with modification. \n\n            But perhaps the previous approach is better.\n\n        Wait the code above may have an alternative approach. \n\nHmm, the problem with the previous code's approach is:\n\nfor (int c =0; c <256; c ++) {\n\n    while (freqs[c] >0) { \n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\n}\n\nBut this may take a lot of time if the characters have many counts. \n\nAlternative approach: for each character c with freqs[c] >0, process as much as possible.\n\nBut maybe this is acceptable given the problem constraints. \n\nWait in the example of 'a' with a count of 5, we would have to loop 5 times. But in C code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, can we find a more O(n) approach to compute 'whoops' ?\n\nWell, perhaps yes, but in translation to the Python code's logic, the above is more straightforward.\n\nWait let me re-post the whoops loop as per previous thoughts.\n\nLet me re-structure the whoops part as follows:\n\nfor (c=0; c<256; c++) {\n    while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n        // determine if this character can contribute to whoops via case conversion. \n        if (islower(c)) {\n            int other = toupper(c);\n            if (freqt[other] >0) {\n                whoops++;\n                freqt[other]--;\n                freqs[c]--;\n            } else {\n                break; // No more of other, can't take anymore, so stop trying for this c\n            }\n        } else if (isupper(c)) {\n            int other = tolower(c);\n            if (freqt[other] >0) { \n                whoops++;\n                freqt[other]--;\n                freqs[c]--;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        } else {\n            break; // not a letter, can't form a pair.  \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, for each character c in frequencies for s:\n\nas long as we have at least one occurrence of c, we try to pair it with its case counterpart. \n\nEach iteration of the while loop takes one of the current c's count and the other's count.\n\nThus, this mirroring the Python's while loop for each character.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, 'while (freqs[c]>0)', each iteration of the loop, we may decrease freqs[c] by 1 (if the check succeeds), else break the loop. \n\nThus for example, if we have 5 instances left of 'a', and the upper 'A' has 3, then 3 steps will occur, so three pairs. Then the upper 'A' is exhausted and the loop. So the loop would run 3 times (breaking after that). Thus correctly takes 3.\n\nYes. This code would do the correct thing.\n\nWait but the way the loop is structured here: for each c (0-255), and while it has count, checks once per iteration.\n\nThus, this may run in O(256)*min(freqs[c], freqt[counterpart]), which in total could be O(N), but with the 256 multiplier.\n\nGiven that the original Python code does similarly (two loops over the frequencies keys), it should be acceptable. \n\nThus the code can proceed as written.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow let's write the code with corrections.\n\nWait in the code I have above:\n\nWait in the first loop for 'yay', after dividing up the first part, the code should be correct. \n\nThen, the whoops loop as per the code above. \n\nLet me note that in the 'whoops' loop, the 'freqt' array is modified, so we have to make sure that when we process other characters, we are referencing the current state of 'freqt'.\n\nThe code is correct for that. \n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nEdge case: s and t are empty. Then yay and whoops 0.\n\nAnother edge case: s is 'a', t is 'A' \u2192 yay 0, whoops 1.\n\nAnother case where letters are fully matched in the first loop.\n\nLike s is 'a', t is 'a': so yay 1, whoops0.\n\nCase where both uppercase in s and lowercase in t.\n\ns is 'A', t is 'a': then first loop: they are same character? No: 'A' vs. lowercase 'a', so not overlapping in counts. Thus, first loop's yay is 0. \n\nThen in whoops:\n\nprocessing 'A' (uppercase). \n\nCheck for lowercase 'a's count in freqt (freqt[a] would be 1. \n\nThus can pair once. So whoops=1. \n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle.\n\nNow finally, output:\n\nprintf(\"%d %d\\n\", yay, whoops);\n\nPut together. \n\nThus, the C code would be written as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s[100000];\n    char t[100000];\n    fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);\n    s[strcspn(s, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n    fgets(t, sizeof(t), stdin);\n    t[strcspn(t, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n    int freqs[256] = {0};\n    int freqt[256] = {0};\n\n    for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        freqs[s[i]]++;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; t[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        freqt[t[i]]++;\n    }\n\n    int yay = 0, whoops = 0;\n\n    // Calculate Yay\n    for (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\n        if (freqs[c] > 0 && freqt[c] > 0) {\n            int take = (freqs[c] < freqt[c]) ? freqs[c] : freqt[c];\n            yay += take;\n            freqs[c] -= take;\n            freqt[c] -= take;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Calculate Whoops\n    for (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\n        while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n            if (islower(c)) {\n                int upper = toupper(c);\n                if (freqt[upper] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[upper]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else if (isupper(c)) {\n                int lower = tolower(c);\n                if (freqt[lower] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[lower]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n            }\n            else { // Not a letter, cannot form a pair\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", yay, whoops);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, I think there is a missing closing brace in the else if (isupper { ...? \n\nLet me check the code's structure. In the inner loop for the 'upper case' part:\n\nInside the while loop (freqs[c]>0), for 'c' being uppercase:\n\nwe have:\n\nelse if (isupper(c)) {\n\n    int lower = ... \n\n    if freqt[lower] >0 ...? \n\n    then:\n\n    ... \n\n    else { break }\n\n} \n\nThe problem is the 'else' after the uppercase check is one level maybe missing. \n\nWait in code:\n\n        if (islower(c)) {\n            // ... \n        } else if (isupper(c)) {\n            ...\n            } else { //  This case, else on the if (is upper ...) ?? \n\nWait no. Let me rewrite that section with proper indentation.\n\nInside the while loop (freqs[c] ...>0)\n\n{\n\n    if ( islower(c) ) {\n\n        ... \n\n    else if ( isupper(c) ){\n\n        ... \n\n    } else {\n\n        // not a letter.\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAh right, the code should be:\n\n            // inside while (freqs[c] >0 block )\n            if (islower(c)) {\n                int upper = toupper(c);\n                if (freqt[upper] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[upper]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else if (isupper(c)) {\n                int lower = tolower(c);\n                if (freqt[lower] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[lower]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else {  // non letter, break loop\n                break;  // so that we do not consider this character again\n            }\n}\n\nAh right! In my code above, I missed the closing brace for the else if part. \n\nThe current code has after 'else if...' has a closing '}' before the else, which may be off.\n\nLet me rework the code section:\n\n        while (freqs[c] >0) { \n\n            if (islower(c)) { \n                ... \n            } else if (isupper(c)) { \n                ... \n            } else { \n                break;\n            } \n\n        // here \n\n        }\n\nThus, after the if statements, the 'else' is for non-letters (thus, break the loop, so no further iterations).\n\nThus correcting the code:\n\nLooking back at the code for whoops part:\n\n    for (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\n        while (freqs[c] > 0) {\n            if (islower(c)) {\n                int upper = toupper(c);\n                if (freqt[upper] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[upper]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else if (isupper(c)) {\n                int lower = tolower(c);\n                if (freqt[lower] > 0) {\n                    whoops++;\n                    freqs[c]--;\n                    freqt[lower]--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nAh, that is correct.\n\nI think that's the correct code."
