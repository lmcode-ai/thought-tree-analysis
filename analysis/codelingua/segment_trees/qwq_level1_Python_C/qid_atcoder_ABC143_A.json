So the first line would involve getting two integers from the user. So, variables A and B. Let's declare them as integers. Then, read using scanf. Oh right, the format would be something like scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B); but I have to make sure that the input is correctly parsed. But since in Python it's split by whitespace, in C using scanf with %d should work as long as the inputs are two integers separated by spaces. Next line: ans is calculated as A - 2*B. That's straightforward. Then, if ans is less than zero, set it to zero. Finally, print the ans. Now, the structure of the C program. The main function will have to handle this. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables A, B, ans.\n2. Read A and B from input. 3. Compute ans = A - 2*B.\n4. If ans is negative, set to 0. 5. Print ans. Wait, in C, variables need to be declared before use, so that's important. So the code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int A, B, ans;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &A, &B);\n    ans = A - 2 * B; if (ans < 0) {\n        ans = 0;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n} Wait, that should work.
