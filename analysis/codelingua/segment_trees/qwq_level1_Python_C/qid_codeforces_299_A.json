Alternatively, use:\n\nreturn (*(int*)a > *(int*)b) ? 1 : (*(int*)a < *(int*)b) ? -1 : 0;\n\nWhich avoids subtraction, but that's a bit more code. The standard advice for C's qsort is to do that to avoid overflow. Wait, for numbers, the difference could be big. For example, two large numbers: a = 2^30, b =2^30 -1: their difference is 1. Wait but if a and b are maximum possible ints (like INT_MAX and another large number), subtraction may overflow. So for code correctness, perhaps using the compare as:\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    int x = *(int*)a;\n    int y = *(int*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThat way overflow is avoided. Because returning -1,0,1 based on comparison. This is better. Thus, that's the comparator code. So adjusting the code accordingly. Thus, the comparator is safer. So the complete C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    int x = *(int*)a;\n    int y = *(int*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), cmp);\n\n    int valid = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % a[0] ! = 0) {\n            valid = 0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (valid) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a[0]);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in the for loop starting with i = 0: but when i=0, a[i] is a[0], so modulo is zero. So the loop is redundant for the first element. But that's okay, since the first element is always dividing itself. But the loop runs through all elements regardless, so checking all. Alternatively, the loop could start at i=1, but the first element is okay, so perhaps better to just loop all for correctness. Wait code works as written. Another problem: What if n is 0? Probably not possible as per problem's constraints.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I have to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does step by step. First, the functions num_inp and arr_inp are helper functions. But the main code seems to be at the bottom. Let's look at that. \n\nThe variable a is assigned to sorted(map(int, [*open(0)][1].split())). Hmm. Wait, [*open(0)] in Python is a way to read all lines from standard input. So open(0) would be reading from stdin, and splitting into lines. Then, [*open(0)] would be a list of all the input lines. So [1] the second element (since Python is 0-indexed) here is the second line of input. Wait, but open(0) might start reading from the first line, so the first line is line 0, and [1] would pick line 1. So they're taking the second line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each to int, sorting them, and storing in a. \n\nThe next line prints either the first element of the sorted array or -1, depending on whether any element in a is not a multiple of a[0]. The [any(... )] is a conditional check. The expression [a[0], -1][condition] is equivalent to: if condition is True, pick the second element, else the first. So if any element x in a has x mod a[0] not equal to zero, we print -1 else a[0].\n\nSo the code finds the smallest element in the list. Then, checks if all elements are divisible by this smallest element. If yes, then the GCD is a[0]. If not, then there's no common divisor (so the GCD would be 1? Wait wait, no, perhaps not. Wait actually, the minimal element is the GCD only if all elements are multiples? Because if, for example, the list has elements 2,4,6,8 then the GCD is 2. But if there's 2,4,5, then the GCD of 2,4 is 2 but 5 mod2 is 1, so the overall GCD would be 1. So the code is checking whether the minimal element divides all elements. If it does, then the minimal (a[0]) is the GCD; else, -1. So the problem must be to print the GCD only if all elements are divisible by the first element, else -1. \n\nHmm. So the code is a bit of an optimization instead of computing the GCD properly. It's assuming that the minimal element is the GCD, but that's only true if all elements are multiples of it. Otherwise, we return -1. \n\nNow, translating this into C. Let's see the steps:\n\nFirst, in C, I need to read input. The input is coming from stdin. The first line is probably the number of elements, but looking back at the Python code: Wait, the line is [*open(0)][1].split(). That means the first line of the input is line 0 (the first line), then the second line (line 1) is the actual data. But perhaps the first line contains the count of elements, but since in the Python code, they are not using it, perhaps in the problem, the input is structured as:\n\nThe first line has an integer N (number of elements), then the second line contains N integers. The Python code is reading the second line (the actual array) and processing it. So in the C code, I'll have to read the second line's elements. \n\nWait in the Python code, the first line is not considered, perhaps. Or maybe the first line is part of the problem's input but is not used here. Let me parse the Python code again. The code reads all lines from open(0), which is the standard input, then the first line is line 0, so the second is [1], then split into parts split by whitespace. So the code is reading the second line as the list of numbers, then splitting into the individual numbers, converting to integers, then sorted. \n\nTherefore, the C program should read the second line of input, split into integers, sort them, then check the condition. But since C doesn't have a standard library split on whitespace, I need to handle that.\n\nNow, steps to write the C code:\n\nFirst, read the second line from input. But in a C program, inputs can be read using scanf or fgets. However, the standard way would be to read all the lines. Since the first line's content isn't used (since in Python it's [1]), perhaps the first line is the number of test cases or the count of elements, but in the Python code, they are not using that. Wait, perhaps the first line contains the count of elements, and the second line contains the actual elements. For example:\n\nInput format might be:\n\nIn the first line, N (number of elements).\nSecond line: the N elements.\n\nThen the Python code takes line 1 (the second line), splits it into N numbers, converts to integers, sorts them, and proceeds.\n\nTherefore, in C, the code must read the second line (the elements), parse them into an array, sort, then check the condition.\n\nSo in C:\n\n1. Read the first integer (probably from first line), but if it is needed, but the code is ignoring the first line. Wait in Python code, the first line isn't used. So in C, the code will first read the first line, but maybe it doesn't care, as long as it skips it. Like, we can either read a line from stdin, then the next line's data. So:\n\nFirst, perhaps read the first line (number of elements?), but in the Python code the code is reading all lines, so in open(0) returns all lines. So the first line is line 0 here. The code takes line 1 (the second line). So in C, we need to read all input lines, then take the second line? Wait no, because open(0) in Python gives all lines, so as an array, so the first line is index 0, the second's data is at index 1.\n\nHowever, maybe in programming contest problems, the code would first read N elements from stdin. So in the problem's input, the user might provide the first line as the number of elements, then the next line is the elements separated by spaces. So perhaps in the C code:\n\n- Read N (from first input line), but then you don't need but skip over it? Wait but the Python code is taking the second line, which is after first. So in the problem, the second line is the array's data.\n\nTherefore in C, the code can:\n\nRead the first line (e.g., with fgets), then read the second line. Then process that second line.\n\nAlternatively, since the second line is the first after any part, you can read all the data in one go, but we need to parse it. Alternatively, read all the input, but split into two lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, the code could ignore the first line of input, provided that the second line is where the actual elements are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count is not needed, and we can read all numbers on the second line into an array of integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can directly read until EOF? But in programming problem scenarios, perhaps better to first get the count, read that many numbers. But according to the Python's code, the first line is skipped (because it uses open(0)[1], so the first line is the 0th element). \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, perhaps the first line is exactly the number of elements, and the second line has those N elements. So to read the second line correctly, the first line is read (the N) but not stored, then the second line is split into N numbers, read into array.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem\u2019s actual code may not care about N, and reads the entire line as integers (like splitting all the inputs on the second line into an array, regardless of N) but the code in Python is correct.\n\nSo in any case, in C, I need to read the second line of input, split into integers, sort the array, then check the condition.\n\nNow, the plan steps:\n\nRead the first line: perhaps with fgets, but ignore its content. Then read the second line into a buffer. Then parse that into integers, split by whitespace.\n\nBut in programming competition style code, typically for reading a line, people can use fgets() then use strtok() or something to parse the tokens. Alternatively, read the whole line as a string and split.\n\nBut in C, handling variable length arrays can be a bit tricky. Since we don\u2019t know how many numbers are on the line until we parse it.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the input has up to a certain number of elements, but perhaps the problem assumes a manageable count given the constraints. Alternatively, we can read each number one by one, but skipping the first line's numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first line is a number N, then the next line has N numbers. So:\n\nRead first line as N (even though it's not needed later, but must be read), then read N numbers from the next line.\n\nWait the original Python code's code, they are taking all the elements from the second line. So the splitting of the second line into integers would give exactly N elements. So in C, perhaps the way to handle this is to read N, but not store it, then read N integers from the second line. That might be the proper way. Let me think.\n\nSo in steps:\n\nIn C code:\n\n1. Read first line (to get N, but not store it). Read it with, say, scanf to read the integer, or a line read function.\n\n2. Then read the next line (the second line), which is the actual elements. Since we know how many elements to expect (from N), but since in Python the code didn't use N but instead just took all the elements, maybe in the problem the N is redundant (like in the input the second line has exactly N numbers). So to read the elements, in C, after reading first line, read N integers from second line. \n\nBut in that case, we need to read N first. Wait, but how do we read the first line as N? Hmm, perhaps:\n\nWe can first read N via a scanf(\"%d\", &n), then read the rest via scanf into an array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using:\n\nBut perhaps the problem's first line is the number of elements, then the second line has them all. So in code:\n\nRead first line: N.\n\nAllocate an array with N elements.\n\nThen read the second line's numbers: scanf for N integers. \n\nBut in the Python code, the elements are stored as a list, which is sorted. So yes.\n\nTherefore, that plan would work. Now, coding steps:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nint n;\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &n); // first line is n.\n\nThen read the second line. But how to read exactly n integers?\n\nPerhaps using a loop with scanf, but buffer input with spaces?\n\nAlternatively, get the second line's data. Read the next input as a single line (the second line) with fgets into a buffer, then use sscanf to parse each number?\n\nBut maybe using a loop with fscanf:\n\nAfter the first line is read, the next numbers are on the same or next line? Confusion here. Wait scanf reads from stdin, so after first line is read with %d comes newlines, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, one can use scanf for the N, then read the rest as n numbers, space-separated, ignoring any newlines.\n\nSo after N is read:\n\n proclaimed_max = scanf(\"%d %d ... \" but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively read the next numbers with a loop (scanf with looping over n elements) and fill array.\n\nWait in practice, perhaps it's better:\n\nDo:\n\nAfter reading N, create array of size N.\n\nLoop over N times, each time using scanf(\"%d\", ...) to get next number until N elements are read. That would work, since after first N is read via a call such as scanf(\"%d\", &n); the remaining input is on the second line, so subsequent calls to scanf would read the numbers from second line, line after next.\n\nWait but the input is \"first line has N, then second line has N numbers\". So, assuming after scanf(\"%d\", &n), the rest of standard input is the second line's data (since first line ends after its newline). So, the second number reading can be done via a loop with %d, and that's what's required.\n\nSo in code:\n\nint a[n]; but variable length arrays are not standard C, but allowed in C99.\n\nAlternatively, dynamic allocation:\n\nint *a = malloc (n * sizeof(int));\n\nBut variable arrays are easier if allowed. So assuming C99 or C11 with VLA:\n\nRead N, then:\n\nint a[N];\n\nfor (int i=0; i<N; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\nBut this assumes that the numbers are all on the same line as after N? But in coding problem scenarios, it's common that the second line has all the elements. \n\nThus, the code can proceed as such.\n\nNow, steps:\n\nRead N first, then the array of N elements.\n\nSort array a in ascending order.\n\nThen check for each element in array a whether it mod a[0] is zero. If any isn't, then output -1. Else output a[0].\n\nNow, the problem is the sorting. The C standard library has qsort.\n\nWe need to write a comparator function for qsort. For example:\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return *(int*)a - *(int*)b;\n}\n\nThen sort the array a via:\n\nqsort(a, N, sizeof(int), cmp);\n\nOnce the array is sorted, loop through each element from index 0 to N-1:\n\nCheck if any element (from index 0 onward) has x % a[0] != 0.\n\nWait, a[0] is the first element, which after sort is the smallest.\n\nWait since the array is sorted, that's the minimal element.\n\nSo for all elements in the array:\n\nfor (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n\n}\n\nWait already sorted, so the first element is smallest, so a[0] is the minimal. Then check for any element x where x mod a[0] !=0.\n\nIf all elements are divisible by a[0], then output a[0], else -1.\n\nNow the code steps:\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut first, code structure.\n\nThe code can be structured as:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    return *(int*)a - *(int*)b;\n}\n\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n); // First line is N.\n\n    int a[n]; // VLA.\n\n    for(int i =0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]); \n    }\n\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), cmp);\n\n    // Check condition\n    int flag =1;\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n        if(a[i] % a[0] !=0) {\n            flag =0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (flag) \n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a[0]);\n    else\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but wait: The array is sorted, so the first element is the smallest. So checking all elements for divisibility with that will work.\n\nWait in the first case, if a[0] is zero? But in that case, division of any element by zero is undefined behavior. Wait, but the problem constraints might not include zero? Because if a[0] is zero, then in the array, there must be elements like zero. However, but modulo with zero is undefined.\n\nBut in programming competition problems, often inputs are such that they don't have zero here unless required, so perhaps the problem implicitly ensures that all numbers are positive. The original Python code would have a[0] as a valid integer, but division by zero could cause issues. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem constraints require inputs to be positive integers, so that the code doesn't have to handle zero.\n\nAssuming so, the code works.\n\nSo this should be the C code. But let's check the Python code's line-by-line.\n\nThe Python code's print statement is:\n\nprint([a[0], -1][any(x % a[0] for x in a)])\n\nWait the expression is a list [a0, -1], and then the index is the boolean result of 'any', which evaluates to True or False, which in Python can be 1 or 0 as an integer. So if any element x has remainder, then the index is 1, so result is -1 else 0 -> a[0].\n\nBut in the check in the Python code, the 'any' loops through all x in a (so including a[0] itself. Because for x in a is the entire array. So when x is a[0], x mod a[0] is 0. So 'any' would only be true if at least one element in the array has remainder when divided by a[0].\n\nWait in the code I have, I loop through all elements, and if any fails, set flag 0, then output accordingly. So that part is equivalent.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, another edge case: if a has only one element. Like a has only a[0], then since all elements are divisible (only itself), so output a[0]. \n\nSo that's handled.\n\nWhat about when a[0] is 1? Suppose the elements are [1,2,3], then all are divisible by 1, so output 1. If elements are [2,3,4], then modulo 2 for each gives 0,1,0. The second element (3) gives remainder 1, so the code would output -1.\n\nWhich matches the Python code's logic.\n\nAnother thing: in C's qsort, the comparator may need to be adjusted for large values, since the difference could be beyond an int (leading to integer overflow). But since this is a problem from programming contest-like code where elements are manageable numbers (like up to 1e9), but then a*(-b) and b*(-a) would be problematic but for purpose of passing test cases?\n\nAlternatively, the input's numbers may not be big enough to make the subtraction overflow, so the simple code is okay.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nreturn (*(int*)a > *(int*)b) ? 1 : (*(int*)a < *(int*)b) ? -1 : 0;\n\nWhich avoids subtraction, but that's a bit more code. The standard advice for C's qsort is to do that to avoid overflow.\n\nWait, for numbers, the difference could be big. For example, two large numbers: a = 2^30, b =2^30 -1: their difference is 1.\n\nWait but if a and b are maximum possible ints (like INT_MAX and another large number), subtraction may overflow. So for code correctness, perhaps using the compare as:\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    int x = *(int*)a;\n    int y = *(int*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThat way overflow is avoided. Because returning -1,0,1 based on comparison.\n\nThis is better. \n\nThus, that's the comparator code.\n\nSo adjusting the code accordingly.\n\nThus, the comparator is safer.\n\nSo the complete C code would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint cmp(const void *a, const void *b) {\n    int x = *(int*)a;\n    int y = *(int*)b;\n    if (x < y) return -1;\n    if (x > y) return 1;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int a[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n    }\n\n    qsort(a, n, sizeof(int), cmp);\n\n    int valid = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (a[i] % a[0] != 0) {\n            valid = 0;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (valid) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", a[0]);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait but in the for loop starting with i = 0: but when i=0, a[i] is a[0], so modulo is zero. So the loop is redundant for the first element. But that's okay, since the first element is always dividing itself. But the loop runs through all elements regardless, so checking all.\n\nAlternatively, the loop could start at i=1, but the first element is okay, so perhaps better to just loop all for correctness.\n\nWait code works as written.\n\nAnother problem: What if n is 0? Probably not possible as per problem's constraints. The code would crash if n is zero, but perhaps the problem specifies that n is at least 1. So assuming that n is valid.\n\nThus, this code should be the correct translation."
