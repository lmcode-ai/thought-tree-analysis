Finally, it prints the counter. Hmm, translating to C. Let me think about each part. First, in C, we need to handle input differently. The first line is n = int(input()), which in C would be reading an integer from standard input. So I can use scanf for that. Then the counter c is straightforward, just an integer initialized to 0. The loop for i in range(n): will be a for loop from 0 to n-1 in C. The next part is where it gets tricky. The Python code reads a line, splits into integers, sums them, checks if the sum exceeds 1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me first understand what the Python code does. \n\nThe Python code starts by reading an integer n from input. Then it initializes a counter c to 0. It loops n times, each time reading a list of integers from input, splits them, converts to integers, and sums them. If the sum is greater than 1, it increments the counter. Finally, it prints the counter.\n\nHmm, translating to C. Let me think about each part.\n\nFirst, in C, we need to handle input differently. The first line is n = int(input()), which in C would be reading an integer from standard input. So I can use scanf for that.\n\nThen the counter c is straightforward, just an integer initialized to 0.\n\nThe loop for i in range(n): will be a for loop from 0 to n-1 in C. \n\nThe next part is where it gets tricky. The Python code reads a line, splits into integers, sums them, checks if the sum exceeds 1. \n\nIn C, I need to read each line, split into integers. Since the input lines can have variable numbers of elements, but how does the Python code handle that? Wait, in the Python code, the split without arguments splits on any whitespace, and then converts each part to int. So for each line, we have a list of integers. The sum is of all elements in that list.\n\nSo in C, I have to read each line, process each number, sum them, and check.\n\nThe problem here is reading each line's numbers. Since the number of elements per line isn't known in advance, maybe using scanf in a loop until the end of line?\n\nAlternatively, we can read the entire line into a buffer, then parse each token. Since C strings are null-terminated, that might be better. Let me plan that.\n\nFirst step: Read each line into a buffer using fgets, then process the buffer with sscanf or strtok.\n\nBut the line could be of arbitrary length. So I should allocate a sufficiently large buffer, maybe 1024 characters?\n\nAlternatively, use dynamic allocation, but maybe for simplicity, just use a large enough buffer.\n\nLet's structure the code.\n\nThe main steps in C:\n\n1. Read n using scanf(\"%d\", &n). But wait, sometimes input might have trailing spaces or other issues. Let's see. Since in Python input().split() splits on any whitespace, maybe that's okay.\n\nWait, but when reading lines with multiple numbers, perhaps the user enters each line as space-separated integers. So in C, for each line, we read the entire line, then process each token as integer.\n\nTherefore, the steps would be:\n\nLoop n times:\n\n- Read a line using fgets into a buffer.\n\n- Then parse each token in the line as integers, sum them.\n\n- If the sum is >1, increment c.\n\nThe challenge is parsing each token. So using strtok for splitting the line into tokens, then converting each token to integer, adding to sum.\n\nAlternatively, using sscanf in a loop. Let's think.\n\nLet's see code structure.\n\nIn the main:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    getchar(); // To consume the newline left by scanf.\n    int c =0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        char line[1000]; // Assuming lines not longer than 1000 chars. Maybe adjust.\n        if(fgets(line, sizeof line, stdin) == NULL) {\n            // handle error? Probably not needed for code submission.\n        }\n        // now process line\n        int sum =0;\n        char *token = strtok(line, \" \\t\\n\");\n        while(token != NULL) {\n            sum += atoi(token); // convert to int and add to sum\n            token = strtok(NULL, \" \\t\\n\");\n        }\n        if(sum >1) c++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nHmm, that's the general idea. But need to check for possible edge cases.\n\nWait, but in Python, split() without arguments splits on any whitespace, and ignores leading/trailing. The strtok with \" \\t\\n\" would split on those, but the same as split()? More or less, I think. Except that split() treats any whitespace as a separator and ignores multiple, but strtok with those delimiters would do similar, but perhaps the difference is that strtok splits on each occurrence. But for the purpose of summing numbers, perhaps it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, in C, the scanf approach. Another alternative is, for each line, read numbers until end of line.\n\nAnother approach is to read all numbers on the line:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nInitialize sum =0;\n\nThen, ignoring leading whitespace, read each integer in the line. For that, perhaps:\n\nBut after reading the first line (n), the next lines can be processed like this:\n\nBut need to process each line's numbers. However, the problem is that after the first scanf for n, the newline might still be in the input buffer. So in C, the scanf(\"%d\") leaves a '\\n' if the user entered it. Hence, the getchar() is to consume that, otherwise the first fgets might read an empty line.\n\nWait, maybe the code should use:\n\nAfter scanf(\"%d\", &n); we can call getchar() to consume the newline character.\n\nYes. Otherwise, the next fgets would read the next line immediately, but if the user entered the n followed by a newline, then the first fgets would read that newline as an empty line, leading to reading an empty line for the first test case. Hence, the getchar() is necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using scanf to read lines. But that's tricky.\n\nProceeding with the code:\n\nWe can write the code as above. But what about when the line is too long? If the input line is longer than the buffer (1000 here), fgets will read until the buffer is filled, but the line isn't fully read. That could be a problem, but perhaps the problem constraints have lines not exceeding that. But to make it safe, maybe a bigger buffer? Like 100000 or so. But given that for programming competition purposes, that should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: atoi can return 0 for invalid input, but given the problem expects integers, perhaps the inputs are correct.\n\nAlternatively, using strtol to handle conversion with error checking, but perhaps it's overkill here.\n\nAlternatively, using scanf to read each number on the line.\n\nAnother approach for summing the numbers in a line:\n\nAfter reading the line into buffer with fgets, then set the pointer to the start of the buffer. Then, use a loop with sscanf:\n\nint sum =0;\nchar *p = line;\nwhile (sscanf(p, \"%d\", &num) == 1) {\n    sum += num;\n    p += strlen(token) +1; // Not sure. Alternatively, find the next position after the number. Maybe better to use sscanf with a pointer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a loop like:\n\nint num;\nchar *p = line;\nwhile(1) {\n   int res = sscanf(p, \"%d\", &num);\n   if (res == EOF) break;\n   sum += num;\n   p += strcspn(p, \" \\t\\n\"); // move past the number\n   p += strspn(p, \" \\t\\n\"); // move past whitespace\n}\n\nWait, perhaps better using pointers properly.\n\nHmm, maybe the first approach with strtok is okay.\n\nWait, let me test strtok:\n\nSuppose the line is \" 1 2 3 \", then strtok with \" \\t\\n\" would split into \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nYes. atoi of each would give the numbers correctly.\n\nBut what about leading spaces, etc? strtok ignores the delimiters, so that should be okay.\n\nThus the code with strtok is okay.\n\nNow, in the C code, the main variables are declared correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. The buffer size for line. Let's set it to a large value, like 1000 characters. Maybe 1024 to be safe.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nchar line[1000]; \u2014 the size is 1000, including the null-terminator, so maximum input line length is 999 characters. That might be okay for problems unless the problem's line can be longer. But if that's a concern, perhaps a larger value would help. But let's proceed with that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the for loop, after the first iteration, the second line is read, but what about trailing spaces? The strtok will handle.\n\nNow, code step by step:\n\nStart with main. Read n, then consume the newline with getchar(), then loop n times, each time reading a line.\n\nWait, but after the first scanf (for n), the next character in stdin is '\\n' if the user entered it. So the getchar() after scanf is to read that, so that the subsequent fgets won't pick up an empty line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the getchar() is not sufficient? Because sometimes the user might have entered more characters. For example, if the user entered '3abc', then scanf will read 3, and the next getchar will get 'a'? So that would be wrong.\n\nHmm, but this code is expected to work with inputs that are properly formatted as per problem description. So assuming that after the n, each line is properly input with the required numbers. So perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to read the rest of the line after the integer. To do that, perhaps after the scanf, call fgets to read the rest of the line. Because after reading with scanf(\"%d\", &n), there might be some other characters (like if user entered \"5   6\" then the scanf would read 5 but then there are 6 and the rest in the buffer. Which is incorrect.\n\nWait, so if the first line has n followed by other characters, like \"5 abc\", then scanf will correctly read 5, but the rest of the line would be part of the next inputs.\n\nThis would be a problem. To avoid that, we can read the first line as a string, then extract n from it. But perhaps the code can be written as follows.\n\nAlternative approach to read n:\n\nchar buffer[1000];\nfgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\nsscanf(buffer, \"%d\", &n);\n\nThis way, it reads the entire first line,.scanfs the first integer. That might be better, to avoid issues with leftover characters.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use this method for robustness.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    char buffer[1000];\n    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) {\n        // error handling, but assuming valid input\n    }\n    sscanf(buffer, \"%d\", &n);\n    int c = 0;\n\n    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {\n        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);\n        int sum = 0;\n        char *token = strtok(buffer, \" \\t\\n\");\n        while(token != NULL) {\n            sum += atoi(token);\n            token = strtok(NULL, \" \\t\\n\");\n        }\n        if(sum > 1) c++;\n    }\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", c);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nYes, this approach may be better.\n\nThis way, the first line is read with fgets, then n is scanned from it. This avoids any leftover characters after n. Because if the user inputs, for example, \"5   \" followed by newline, it's okay. Also, if there are other characters after the integer in the first line, sscanf will just take the first integer and ignore the rest, which is acceptable as n is the first.\n\nIn the case of the first line having more numbers, like \"5 3\", the n would be 5, which is correct.\n\nThis approach is better because it avoids the problem of leftover characters from scanf.\n\nSo that code should be better. Then the rest of the lines (each line for the test cases) are read with fgets into the same buffer. Since each call to fgets would read a new line.\n\nWait, but in the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1, we call fgets(buffer, ...). Each time, it reads a new line. So that's okay.\n\nBut also, the buffer is reused. But since it's overwritten each time, that's okay.\n\nThe size of the buffer should be large enough. 1000 is okay unless the problem allows longer lines.\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nWait, what if a line is exactly 1000 characters? The buffer is 1000 chars, but fgets reads up to (size-1) so that's 999. So maybe better to use a larger buffer, say 1024. Let me adjust:\n\nSo the buffer declaration can be:\n\nchar buffer[1024];\n\nThat's better.\n\nAnother consideration: when using strtok, the strtok modifies the string (it replaces the delimiter with '\\0'). But since the buffer is being overwritten each time, that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parse the string without modifying it, but strtok is the simplest way here.\n\nNow, testing the code for some examples.\n\nFor example:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n0 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n2\n\nThen sum first line is 0, so no. The second line's sum is 2, so counts it, third sum is 2, so total 2.\n\nWait, for the second line sum: 1+1+0 = 2. That's >1, so count increments. The third line's sum is 2>1, so count becomes 2.\n\nHence the total c would be 2. The code should output that.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst line: 3, stored into n=3.\n\nThen three lines after that.\n\nFirst line after: 0 0, sum is 0, no.\n\nSecond line: 1+1+0=2, yes, so c becomes 1.\n\nThird: 2 gives sum 2, so c becomes 2. Thus yes, output is 2.\n\nThus the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: a line with 0 elements? Probably not, since the problem requires the line to have at least one? Or maybe the code can handle that. If a line is empty, sum is 0, so not counted.\n\nAnother edge case: a line has 1. Sum is 1, so no.\n\nA line has 2. Sum is 2: yes.\n\nWhat if sum is exactly 1? Not counted.\n\nNow, in code, the condition is sum > 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code looks correct.\n\nWait but in the first approach I made, the code for the first read was using getchar(). Now in this second approach (using fgets for first line), it's better.\n\nThus the final C code would look like this.\n\nWait in second approach:\n\nWait the for loop's fgets uses the same buffer as the first one. Since when first we used fgets for buffer (for n), then each time in the for loop, we again read to buffer, overwriting the previous contents. So that's okay.\n\nSo I think this is the correct approach.\n\nThus the C code is as outlined, with buffer of 1024 characters.\n\nHence, the translated C code."
