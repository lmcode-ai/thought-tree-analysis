So the third interval's existence causes the l to go lower (so expanding to the left), but the right side is less \u2192 but that doesn't cause the previous interval (third step) can't form a full enclosure. Thus the else if condition kicked in because of the left side being smaller (li < l) \u2192 which means that the next interval starts smaller, but doesn't fully contain previous's l and r. Hence, the existing track is broken. Therefore, the code's output is -1. In that scenario, what is the correct answer? If you look for an interval that contains all previous ones:\n\n- The second interval (i=1, which is the second interval) has [3,12]. Does that contain all previous ones (the first [5,10] \u2192 yes, because the second is enclosing first. The third interval (2-11) is not contained by the second interval's [3,12]?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by looking at the Python code and understanding what it does. \n\nThe code starts with some imports but I notice in Python they're using functions like input(), which in C would be handled through stdin. The functions I, IS, IN, IF are defined for input. But since we're moving to C, I'll have to handle input differently, probably using scanf.\n\nLooking at the main code:\n\nn is read as an integer. Then, l and r are read from input as two integers. Then a loop from 1 to n-1 (since in Python, range(1, n) would go up to n-1). For each iteration, li and ri are read. The variables id is initialized to 0. The code checks conditions to update id. The loop is tracking the minimum and maximum of l and r, and updating id accordingly. Finally, it prints id+1 or -1 based on the value of id.\n\nHmm. The key is to replicate this logic in C. Let me think about variables and loops.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nid starts at 0. The loop variable i in Python's for loop starts at 1 and goes up to n-1 (since range(1, n) is exclusive on the upper end). So in C, the loop would probably be for (int i = 1; i < n; i++).\n\nIn Python, after the first l and r are read, for each subsequent line, we read li and ri. Then check:\n\n- if li is <= l and r <= ri \u2192 then set id to i? Because in Python, the initial i starts at 1? Wait the loop starts with for i in range(1, n). Wait Python's first iteration is i=1, then increments to 2, ..., n-1. Wait the original code's loop runs for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nWait, the initial first input l and r comes from the first line after n. Then for the next n-1 lines, we process them, starting with i=1 and going up? Because the loop is for i in range(1, n) \u2192 which for n lines? Let me see.\n\nOriginal variables:\n\nThe initial l and r are from the first line after n (the first test case). Then, for the remaining n-1 cases, each is read in the loop. So the first iteration (i=1) corresponds to the second input pair, etc. Each time, they check if the current li, ri is such that they contain the current l and r, or if they are not nested, possibly indicating overlapping. \n\nThe logic of id is: \n\nInitially id is 0. For each new li, ri (after the first pair), they check:\n\n1. If li <= current l and ri >= current r \u2192 then this new interval includes the previous, so this is the possible candidate (i?), so set id to i. Because this would be the interval that fully contains all previous ones. Wait, but why? \n\nWait the code is trying to determine which interval is the outer one. Because, each time, we track the overall min and max. Wait the loop keeps updating l as the minimum of all the lefts, and r as the maximum of all the rights.\n\nWait the condition li <= l and ri >= r \u2192 that means this new interval [li, ri] completely contains the previous [l, r]. So, this current interval (i) is part of a chain that keeps expanding outward, so perhaps the id needs to track such a candidate.\n\nThe first condition is if this li and ri is larger in both directions, so that the previous interval is inside this one. Then set id to the current step (i?), but in the Python code, since the loop's index starts at 1, then for the first iteration (i=1), this would be the second interval (since first was input before the loop), so maybe the index is correct. But when they later set id to i, but at the end, the output is id+1, because the problem wants 1-based indexing, maybe? Because in the Python code, if the id is set to n (which is the maximum possible, then print -1 else id+1).\n\nWait the code has an else part? Wait the code's condition:\n\nif li <= l and r <= ri \u2192 id becomes i (the current index).\n\nelif li < l or r < ri \u2192 in this case, we set id = n. Hmm, because maybe this indicates that there's an overlap that breaks any possible hierarchy?\n\nNot sure exactly what the problem is doing, but the translation is about code structure, not the algorithm. So perhaps I can just port the code as it is.\n\nNow, moving to C.\n\nFirst, the functions like IN() return an int. In C, that would be easier, just using scanf.\n\nThe steps in C:\n\n- Read n from stdin.\n\n- Read first l and r from next line.\n\n- Then loop (n-1) times, reading each line's li and ri.\n\nWait in the code, for the loop, each iteration's i is the loop variable, which starts from 1 to n-1 (since for i in range(1, n) \u2192 which in Python is from 1 up to but not including n, so total steps: n-1, which matches the n-1 test cases after the first line. So the first step (i=1) is for the second interval.\n\nSo in C, variables needed:\n\nint n, l, r, id=0, li, ri;\n\nWe need to read n with scanf(\"%d\", &n). Then read l and r as two integers on the next line:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &l, &r).\n\nThen loop from i=1 to i < n (so up to i = n-1, which has exactly n-1 iterations). For each iteration, read li and ri:\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nAfter reading li and ri:\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nThe code has:\n\nif (li <= l and r <= ri) \u2192 in that case, we should set id to i (current iteration's i)\n\nWait in Python code:\n\nif li <= l and r <= ri: \u2192 yes. So then id is set to i (the current loop iteration's i).\n\nElse: check if (li < l OR r < ri) \u2192 if so, set id to n \u2192 which is the maximum possible, to signal that the final value will have to output -1.\n\nWait why?\n\nWell, the code's output is \"print(-1 if id == n else id + 1)\".\n\nSo if during any step the second condition (li < l or r < ri) is true, then id is set to n. Then, at the end, if id is n, output -1.\n\nSo the idea is that if there's a point where we can't have a nested interval but had to expand the min or max, then the answer is invalid and set to -1. But perhaps this needs to be translated correctly.\n\nNow, in C, translating that:\n\nThe loop runs for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\nread li and ri.\n\nthen:\n\nif (li <= l && r <= ri) \u2192 set id = i.\n\nElse if ( (li < l) || (r < ri) ) \u2192 set id = n.\n\nthen update l and r: l = min(l, li), r = max(r, ri).\n\nWait the order here matters. Because even if the conditions are not met, we still update l and r. \n\nWait yes. The code in Python:\n\nl = min(l, li)\n\nr = max(r, ri)\n\nare always executed, after the condition checks.\n\nSo in C, after the condition checks, we do:\n\nl = (l < li) ? l : li; \u2192 but wait, no. Min of l and li?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait min(l, li) \u2192 so, e.g., if li is smaller than l, then the new l is li. Because we have to keep track of the minimal left value across all intervals. Similarly, the maximum for the right.\n\nYes.\n\nIn C: l = (l < li) ? l : li ?\n\nWait no, min would return the smaller one. Wait no: the minimal value between them.\n\nWait for example, if current l is 5 and new li is 3 \u2192 then the new minimal is 3. So new l would be min(5, 3) = 3. So the code does l = min(l, li). So in C, perhaps use a helper function but likely it's better to compute it inline.\n\nSame for r: r = (r > ri) ? r : ri; \u2192 no, because max(r, ri) \u2192 so whichever is larger stays. So yes, r = (ri > r) ? ri : r; \n\nWait: \n\nmin(l, li) \u2192 the smaller of l and li \u2192 so l is kept if current l is smaller. So l should be the minimum of the two, so l = (l < li) ? l : li.\n\nYes. Similarly, r = (r > ri) ? r : ri. Or equivalently, r = ri > r ? ri : r.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nInitially:\n\nid = 0.\n\nSo in the C code:\n\nWe have to read all the input lines properly.\n\nNow, input bits:\n\nIn Python, the first number is read via IN() which is input(). Then the first line after that has two numbers l and r \u2192 so split into l, r.\n\nIn C, after reading n via scanf(\"%d\", &n), then the next line has two integers, so we can scanf(\"%d %d\", &l, &r). But wait, sometimes input can have leading or trailing spaces, but the scanf should handle it.\n\nWait in code:\n\ninput() in Python may read the entire line, but in the code for first input after n is split into two integers. So the second line must be exactly two integers.\n\nIn C, the code can use:\n\nAssuming that each line is two numbers, separated by spaces or tabs, etc.\n\nTherefore, in the loop, need to read each next li and ri:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (i is the current index):\n\nWait, but the first step (i=1) is the second interval. So each loop iteration corresponds to the next line.\n\nWait the loop runs (n-1) times, for the remaining lines.\n\nWait, in Python, first line after n is read as l and r via input().split().\n\nThen, for the next (n-1) lines, loop reads each into li and ri.\n\nSo in C, after the first line's l and r, the loop needs to read (n-1) pairs of integers.\n\nThus:\n\nIn the code structure:\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, l, r, id=0, li, ri;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &l, &r);\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &li, &ri);\n\n        // do the conditions and updates.\n\n        // first condition:\n\n        if (li <= l && r <= ri) {\n\n            id = i;\n\n        }\n\n        else if (li < l || r < ri) {\n\n            id = n; \n\n        }\n\n        // update l and r:\n\n        if (li < l) {\n\n            l = li;\n\n        }\n\n        if (ri > r) {\n\n            r = ri;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // after loop, decide output.\n\n    if (id == n) {\n\n        printf(\"-1\\n\");\n\n    } else {\n\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", id +1);\n\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the code's condition for the else if was in Python: elif li < l or r < ri \u2192 which would set id to n, overriding any previous id.\n\nWait, let me recheck the code:\n\nThe Python code is:\n\nfor i in range ...: \n\n    li, ri = map(...)\n\n    if li <= l and r <= ri: \u2192 set id to i\n\n    elif li < l or r < ri: \u2192 then set id to n (which is the maximum i would ever reach?)\n\nHence, the code first checks if this interval is enclosing the previous [l, r]. If yes, we set the candidate id to i. \n\nElse, if there is an expansion (either left side is smaller or right side larger), then we need to set id to n, which would at end make it print -1, since that would indicate impossibility?\n\nBut in the case where the first interval is exactly [5, 10], and the next is [3, 12], then first check: li=3 <=5, but r=10 is not <= 12 \u2192 because 10 is less than 12? Wait no. The r in previous step would be 10, ri is 12 \u2192 so 10 <=12 yes. So the first condition would apply? \n\nWait let me recast variables.\n\nOld l is 5, r is 10.\n\nThe new li is 3, ri is 12 \u2192 check if 3 <=5 (yes), and 10 <=12 (yes \u2192 so condition is true \u2192 so yes: then set id to i (since this interval [3, 12] contains the previous [5,10]). Then l becomes min(5,3) \u21923, r becomes 12. \n\nBut if a next interval is like 2, 14: same thing, so the id would updated again.\n\nNow, if the next interval after that is like 1, 15 \u2192 also enclosing all previous, so the id would track the latest.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is looking for the last interval that encloses all previous, and if any interval breaks that structure, then the id is set to n (making it invalid).\n\nAlternatively, the code could be for tracking the last interval that's part of a monotonically expanding sequence, but the problem may want specific condition.\n\nWell, the code's logic is straightforward; the translation must be correct.\n\nNow, in the C code:\n\nWait I have to make sure that in the else if branches:\n\nThe first condition is checked first, then else if the second. \n\nIn Python code:\n\nThe order is important: because the first condition (li <= l and r <= ri) could be true. Then we process it. Else, check the second condition (li < l or r < ri). If that is true, then set to n. But perhaps in cases where neither condition is met, then nothing happens (so id remains what it was).\n\nWait what if the li is greater than l and ri is less than r?\n\nLike the new interval is [ (l+1), (r-1) ] \u2014 inside the current interval.\n\nThen the first condition is false. The second condition (li < l ? no \u2192 5 < l? For example, say current l is 5, li is 6 \u2192 6 <5 \u2192 false. r < ri? r is r is 10, ri is 9 \u2192 10 <9? no \u2192 so (li < l is false, and r < ri is false \u2192 so the else if condition is false. So both are skipped. So id is not changed.\n\nThus, in this case, the id remains as whatever it was before. \n\nHence, the code only changes id to i when it is an enclosing interval, or to n if there was expansion. Otherwise does nothing.\n\nSo, the C code should implement that logic.\n\nNow, on the loop steps.\n\nWait the code in the loop:\n\nIf the first condition is true, set id to current i.\n\nIf the first is false, check the second condition \u2192 if it is true, set id to n.\n\nElse, do not change id.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nIn C, the same.\n\nSo the code in loop:\n\nAt each iteration:\n\nWe first check if (li <= current l && current r <= ri). That is, li is <= the current l and ri >= the current r?\n\nWait in code variables, current l and r refer to the accumulated min and max so far.\n\nWait that\u2019s correct.\n\nThen, when that is true, the current interval is fully enclosing all previous ones. So this becomes a candidate, so we can set id = i (the current iteration's index, starting from 1 to n-1 \u2192 but since problem requires printing id+1, that should be okay.\n\nElse, check the OR condition (li < l \u2192 which is li less than current l, which may indicate the new left is smaller (but not enough to encompass previous's whole interval perhaps). Or ri is > current r \u2192 the right is bigger.\n\nWait for instance, if the current l is 5, the new li is 4 \u2192 which is less than l. Then, this would mean the new interval's left is to the left of current's l. However, since we are taking the min, then new l will become 4, but the first condition's check was li <= l \u2192 4 \u2264 5 \u2192 true? Wait the current l is 5 here, so to the first part of condition is true, but the second, whether r (current's r) is <= new ri? \n\nAh, right. So in the first condition checking, if the current l is 5, and the new li is 4, but the new ri is less than current r (say current r was 10, new ri is 9), then:\n\nli (4) is less than current l (5 \u2192 yes, so first part of first condition \u2192 true. But the second part (current r=10) <= ri (9 \u2192 no. So the first condition (li<=l and r <= ri) is not met. Because the first condition is a AND of both parts. So the first condition is false here. Then the second condition (li < l \u2192 yes, so the second condition is.\n\nHence, the second condition would trigger, setting id=n. \n\nThus, the code is correct here.\n\nSo the code in C should reflect this.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nIn the C code, I have to be careful about all variables:\n\nFirst, read n correctly.\n\nThen l and r.\n\nThe for loop runs n-1 times (since i starts at 1, step to n-1 steps).\n\nEach time, read two integers.\n\nThen, the conditions.\n\nNow, handling the loop's variables:\n\nNote that in C, the variables should be properly declared.\n\nIn the for loop, since i is local to the loop, declaring it there is okay. \n\nNow, for updating l and r:\n\nAs written in C.\n\nWait in my earlier code:\n\n    if (li < l) {\n\n        l = li;\n\n    }\n\n    if (ri > r) {\n\n        r = ri;\n\n    }\n\nWhich correctly finds the min and max, since l is the minimum of all the li's and r is maximum of all ri's. \n\nYes, that code is equivalent to l = min(l, li) and r = max( r, ri ).\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, the final output is to print id +1 if id is not equal to n, else -1.\n\nWait initial id is zero. So if in all iterations none of the conditions except the first (the enclosing one) were met, and the id is set once, then the +1 would be correct.\n\nBut in the code, consider:\n\nSuppose for the first interval (i=1), it is enclosing.\n\nSo id is set to 1 (since code: id =i, which is 1. The interval in question is the second input, which would be i=1's step (the first in the loop).\n\nThe problem probably numbers the input intervals starting from 1, so adding 1 gives the correct index. \n\nWait the original Python code's output is 'id + 1', so in C, that's correct.\n\nThe only edge case is when id was zero (no conditions were met), but then the output is 0+1=1?\n\nWait the problem may need the first (original) interval as the default. Need to check when the id remains 0.\n\nSuppose all intervals are inside the first's. For example:\n\nn is 2: [5, 10] first. Next is [6,9]. \n\nThen for the second interval (i=1):\n\nli is 6, which is greater than l(5), so first condition li <= l \u2192 6 <=5 \u2192 false. Second condition: 6 <5? No \u2192 so the OR is not met. So neither conditions are triggered. Thus the id remains 0, so printing 1 \u2192 which is correct, because the first interval (before loop) is considered as 0-th? Not exactly.\n\nWait in the problem, perhaps the first interval is the first one, so the indices are 1-based for each interval. Wait:\n\nn is the number of intervals. The first interval is read first (so index 0?), or first step is step 1 which corresponds to the second interval.\n\nWait the inputs:\n\nn = IN(). \n\nThen the first line is interval 1 (the first one?), then for the rest, n-1 lines, which are intervals 2 to n.\n\nHmm so the first interval (the one read before the loop) is the first, and the loop's i from 1 to n-1 (total n-1) correspond to intervals 2 to n.\n\nThus the id in the loop's variable i represents the (i+1) th interval, perhaps?\n\nWait no. If the loop runs with i going from 1 to n-1, then each i is the current interval's index (assuming the first interval is index 0).\n\nWait no. The first interval is the first line after the n. So let's say:\n\nn is 3.\n\nn=3. The first interval (input line 1) is interval 1. \n\nSecond line (input line 2) is the second interval (i=1 in the loop). Third line (input 3) is third (i=2 in the loop).\n\nThe problem is to find which interval is the outer one.\n\nThe code's id variable is initialized as 0.\n\nSuppose for the second interval (i=1), which is the second input interval, if it encloses the first interval's l and r \u2192 then id is set to 1 (i=1).\n\nIf the third interval (i=2) further encloses it \u2192 then id becomes 2.\n\nWhen printed as id+1, that would give 2, which is the third interval's 1-based index (since i=2 \u2192 2+1=3? Wait, no. Wait 1+1= 2, 2+1=3. So for the third interval (index 3), which is stored as i=2, adding 1 gives 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait no: the third interval (third in sequence) is stored in the loop as i=2. So yes, adding 1 to i gives the correct 1-based number.\n\nThus, the output logic is correct: id 0 \u2192 interval 1 (1st), id=1 \u2192 interval 2 (second), etc.\n\nWait why is initial id 0? \n\nIf no interval after the first one is an enclosing interval, but all intervals are inside the first one (including those that may have come after but enclosed earlier ones), but can still have their own inside conditions.\n\nWait suppose:\n\nFirst interval's l and r are 5-10.\n\nSecond interval (i=1) is 6-9 \u2192 this is inside the first interval. So the first condition (whether li <= original l (5)? 6 <=5 is false. \u2192 no. The second condition (li < l \u2192 6 is <5 \u2192 no. Or r (10) < ri (9 \u2192 10 <9 \u2192 no. So the second condition is false \u2192 no change to id. \n\nThus after processing second interval, the id remains 0.\n\nSince the first interval is the only one left. The answer is 1 (id 0 +1 \u2192 yes. The first interval is the one that is the outermost. \n\nBut according to the problem's conditions, if all intervals after the first are inside, then the first interval is the one we need. So the code's output is correct.\n\nSo the code's logic is okay.\n\nThus, the code seems correct. So now, writing that in C.\n\nBut wait, in Python:\n\nThe initial id is 0. So in case nothing is set in the loop, for example when all subsequent intervals are inside the first, but never trigger the first condition (since their intervals are entirely within current l and r), then id remains 0 \u2192 output is 0+1 =1 \u2192 which is the first interval (the index 0th input line).\n\nWait but in the first interval, there's nothing else to trigger the condition to set id=0 \u2192 because the initial intervals' l and r come from the first interval. So any enclosing intervals would be among the other ones.\n\nWait for example, in the first scenario: first interval is 5-10. Second interval is 3-12 \u2192 then in the loop (i=1):\n\nli (3) is less than l=5, and ri(12) is larger than r=10 \u2192 so first condition is 3<=5 \u2192 yes, and 10 <=12 \u2192 yes. \u2192 set id to i=1. So resulting id+1 =2 \u2192the second interval is the one that contains the first one, so correct.\n\nAnother scenario where all are inside the first, then the answer should be the first (id 0 \u21921).\n\nYes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, in C, code.\n\nWait, code structure:\n\nI think variables must be initialized properly.\n\nThe main steps are the same.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. scanf might fail if input isn't read properly, but the problem assumes the inputs are correctly formatted.\n\n2. The loop index: in C, loop runs from i=1 to i <n \u2192 correct?\n\nYes. For example, if n is 3, the loop runs for i=1 and 2, which matches the two additional intervals.\n\nWait, for n=3, the first interval is read, then two more are read.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1 \u2192 but in that case, the loop (which starts at 1) doesn't run, since i from 1 to 0? Wait. If n is 1, then the loop is for(int i=1; i <1 \u21920 so the loop doesn't execute. Then the id is 0.\n\nThus, the output is 0+1=1, which is the first interval as intended.\n\nBut perhaps n=1 is a possible input. The code handles it correctly.\n\nNow, in the code in loop:\n\nWait, the id is set when the new interval encloses the current l and r. Since after reading the initial l and r, in the first iteration, current l and r are the original ones. \n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nAnother possible problem is that in C, the 'id' variable may be uninitialized, but in our code, it's initialized to zero.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\n    int n, l, r, id = 0, li, ri;\n\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &l, &r);\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &li, &ri);\n\n        // Check first condition\n\n        if (li <= l && r <= ri) {\n\n            id = i;\n\n        } else if (li < l || r < ri) {\n\n            id = n;\n\n        }\n\n        // Update l and r to current min and max\n\n        if (li < l) {\n\n            l = li;\n\n        }\n\n        if (ri > r) {\n\n            r = ri;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", (id == n) ? -1 : id + 1);\n\n    return 0;\n\n}\n\nHmm, but in the C code, the variables must be declared before the loop? \n\nWait in the for loop, the 'i' is declared in the for's initialization part, so it's local to the loop.\n\nThe rest's variables n, l, r, id, li, ri are all declared at the start.\n\nBut in C, variable declarations must be at the top of the block. So, in the main() function, declaring all variables first.\n\nYes, in the code above, they're all declared at the top of main().\n\nThus this should work.\n\nTesting possible cases.\n\nTest Case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n5 6\n\n3 8 \u2192 second interval (i=1)\n\n4 5 \u2192 third interval (i=2)\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial l=5, r=6.\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\nli=3, ri=8.\n\nCheck first condition: li (3) <=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nr (6) <= ri (8 \u2192 yes \u2192 so set id=1 (i=1). \n\nThen check l and r's min and max: new l is min(5,3) \u21923, r is max(6,8\u21928.\n\nThen second iteration (i=2):\n\nInput is 4 5.\n\nli=4 and ri=5 \u2192 \n\nCheck first condition:\n\nli=4 \u2264 3 (current l after first iteration is 3). \n\n4 <=3 \u2192 no \u2192 condition false.\n\nThen check second condition: li (4) < l (3 \u2192 no), and r (8) < ri (5 \u2192 8 <5 \u2192 no \u2192 so the condition is false.\n\nNeither applies \u2192 so the id remains at 1 (from previous step).\n\nThen:\n\nupdate l and r:\n\nli=4 is greater than l (3 \u2192 no \u2192 so l remains 3.\n\nri=5 is less than (current r is 8 \u2192 so r stays 8.\n\nAfter all, id is 1 \u2192 so output is 2 \u2192 correct? \n\nBecause the first interval (i=1's step corresponds to the second input interval (3 8), which is the second interval (index 2?), wait the first interval is (5,6), the second is (3,8), the third is (4,5).\n\nThe algorithm's goal is to find which interval contains all previous intervals. The correct answer is the second interval (the one at index 1, which is the second one, so output is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, so output is 1+1=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother scenario:\n\nn =2\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line after n: 5 10\n\nSecond line: 3 15 \u2192 i=1.\n\nChecking: first condition.\n\nli =3 <=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nr 10 <= 15 \u2192 yes.\n\n thus id =1. output 2.\n\n Which is correct.\n\nAnother example where after first interval, there's one that makes it expand, then again expand.\n\nWait Another scenario where the third interval breaks the possibility.\n\nSuppose:\n\nn=3\n\nFirst: 5 10 \u2192 l and r start as 5 and 10.\n\nThen interval 2 (i=1): 3 12 \u2192 li is 3 <5 \u2192 first condition's first part (3<=5), and r (10) <= 12 \u2192 so set id=1 (i=1).\n\nThen interval3 (i=2): 2 11 \u2192 \n\ncheck first condition: li (2) <= current l (3)? \u2014 l after previous iteration was 3 (since min(5 and 3 \u2192 3).\n\nWait after first iteration, l was updated to 3, r to max(10 vs 12 \u219212).\n\nWait current l is 3, r =12.\n\nWait in the third interval's processing (i=2):\n\nli is 2 \u2192 which is less than l (3 \u2192 yes.\n\n ri is 11, which is less than current r (12 \u2192 r < ri \u2192 no, 12>11 \u2192 So first condition is: li (2 \u22643? yes) AND 12 <=11? No \u2192 so first condition false.\n\nSecond condition: li <l \u2192 2 <3 \u2192 yes \u2192 so condition is true.\n\nThus, set id=2.\n\nSo after third iteration, id is set to 2 (i=2). \n\nNow, the output would be 3 (2+1). \n\nOutput is correct: because the third interval (2,11) can't fully contain the fourth's data?\n\nWait no, in this example:\n\nWait third interval is i=2 (third is the second iteration? Wait the interval is third input line (so the third interval, which corresponds to i=2. Then, the code's id.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nAfter processing i=2 (third interval):\n\nThe new l is min(3 (the l before iteration) and 2 \u21922.\n\n The new r is max(12 and 11 \u2192 12.\n\nFirst condition for third interval (i=2):\n\nAfter the first interval's l=3 and r=12, the third interval's li=2 <=3 \u2192 yes, but r is 12 \u2264 11 \u2192 no. So first condition is false.\n\nSecond condition: li < l (2 <3 \u2192 yes \u2192 true. So set id =n? Wait wait no, the condition is (li < l || r < ri). Wait the new ri is 11, so r (previous r is 12) compared to it? \n\nWait current r before this interval was 12, and new ri is 11 \u2192 12 is greater than \u2192 So the second part of the condition (r <ri \u2192 12 <11 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the condition is (li <l OR (r < ri))? \u2192 yes, because li is 2 <3 \u2192 part1 is true, so the condition is true \u2192 so the else if block sets id to n (id= n \u2192 which is 3?) \n\nWait n is 3, so setting it to 3.\n\nWait in this case:\n\nThe third interval's processing (i=2):\n\nFirst, check the first condition is valid?\n\nLi (2) \u2264l (previous l is 3 \u2192 yes. But r (previous r was 12) must be \u2264 ri (11) \u2192 no. So first condition not met.\n\nThen check the else if condition (li < l (yes \u2192 set id to n \u2192 3).\n\nThus, after this step, id is set to 3?\n\nWait yes, because the condition is in the elif clause.\n\nBecause the first condition is false, and the second condition (li < l) is true, so the code enters the else if block and sets id =n.\n\nTherefore, after processing, the id is set to n (3).\n\nTherefore, the final output would be -1.\n\nWait that's interesting.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the third interval's ri is 11 < current r (12), but the li is less than previous l (3 \u2192 now the new l is 2. So the overall externals are expanding (l is now 2, but the right side is same as before? Because ri is 11 < previous r of 12.\n\n In this case, the intervals' min and max now are 2 to 12, but the third interval (2,11) can't contain previous l/r (3 and 12?), wait:\n\nThe previous step after first interval had l=3, r=12.\n\nThe third interval's li is 2 (so new l is 2). lr is 11 \u2192 the current r after third interval is max(12, 11) \u219212.\n\nso the third interval (2-11) has r of 11 which is less than previous r of 12, so the new interval doesn't have r greater than current r (which was 12). \n\nSo the third interval's existence causes the l to go lower (so expanding to the left), but the right side is less \u2192 but that doesn't cause the previous interval (third step) can't form a full enclosure.\n\nThus the else if condition kicked in because of the left side being smaller (li < l) \u2192 which means that the next interval starts smaller, but doesn't fully contain previous's l and r. Hence, the existing track is broken.\n\nTherefore, the code's output is -1. \n\nIn that scenario, what is the correct answer?\n\nIf you look for an interval that contains all previous ones:\n\n- The second interval (i=1, which is the second interval) has [3,12]. Does that contain all previous ones (the first [5,10] \u2192 yes, because the second is enclosing first. The third interval (2-11) is not contained by the second interval's [3,12]? The left-edge of third interval (2) is less than 3 \u2192 so not enclosed \u2192 so third's interval is not inside the second's. So the third interval breaks the enclosing.\n\nThus, there is no interval that contains all three intervals. So the answer should be -1, which the code would return \u2192 correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is working.\n\nAnother test case where a later interval breaks the expansion.\n\nTest Case 4:\n\nn=2\n\nInitial interval: 10 20 \u2192 so l=10, r=20\n\nSecond interval (i=1): 5 30 \u2192 \n\nCheck first condition: yes (5 <=10 \u2192 condition1; 20 <=30 \u2192 yes \u2192 set id to 1 \u2192 so output is 2 \u2192 meaning the second interval which is correct.\n\nBecause the second interval fully contains first.\n\nNow suppose third example.\n\nn=2, first interval:5 10\n\nSecond interval:6 9 \u2192 \n\nFirst condition:6 <=5? 6<=5 is false \u2192 no.\n\nElse the second condition: li <l \u21926 <5 \u2192 no \u2192 r is 10? 10 <9 \u2192 no \u2192 no second condition \u2192 thus no change to id's value (still 0).\n\nUpdate l and r \u2192 min(5 and6=5. Max(10 vs9 \u219210 \u2192l remains 5. So after processing, id remains 0.\n\nThen output 1 \u2192 correct, as the first interval contains second.\n\nWait wait the second interval [6,9] is inside [5,10], so the first interval is the one that contains all. So the output is 1 \u2192 correct. \n\nThe code gives id+1 \u2192 0+1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAll seems okay.\n\nThus, the C code should work."
