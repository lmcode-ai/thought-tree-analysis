    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the code does.\n\nThe Python code is a solution for some programming problem, probably from Codeforces. The class CodeforcesTask397BSolution has methods to read input, process the queries, and output the results. The main task seems to be checking for each query if a certain condition is met, returning \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nFirst, let's see the structure. The Python code reads T test cases. For each test case, there's a query which is a list of three integers. For each query [a, b, c], the code checks if (a // b) * c >= a. If yes, output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nHmm, translating this to C. Since C doesn't have classes, I'll need to structure this as a procedural program. Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read T from input.\n2. Read T lines, each containing three integers a, b, c.\n3. For each triplet (a, b, c):\n   - Compute k = a / b (integer division, so use division truncating towards zero, but since a and b are positive here, maybe straightforward division).\n   - Check if k * c >= a. If yes, add \"Yes\" to the results, else \"No\".\n4. Output all the results separated by newlines.\n\nNow, in C, I need to manage dynamic arrays because the number of queries is T, which isn't known in advance. Wait, but in the Python code, queries are stored as a list of lists, but each query is a list of three integers. For C, perhaps read all the queries into an array of structs.\n\nAlternatively, process each query immediately as we read them. Wait, but the Python code reads all queries first and then processes them. The C code can do the same, but to store the three numbers for each query, we need to create an array of structs.\n\nWait, in C, it might be better to process each query right after reading it, since that way we don't need to store all queries in memory. Let me check the code structure.\n\nLooking at the Python code's process_task method:\n\nIt iterates over all queries, computes k = query[0] // query[1], then appends \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on k*query[2] >= query[0].\n\nSo, the processing is done after all queries are read. Therefore, in C, to mimic this, we need to store all queries first, then process them, collecting the results, then print them all.\n\nBut storing in C requires arrays. Let's plan the structure.\n\nFirst, steps in C:\n\n- Read T from input.\n- Allocate memory for an array of structs to hold the queries. Each struct has three integers a, b, c.\n- Read each line into the struct array.\n- Then, process each query in a loop, compute the result (Yes/No), store the results in an array of strings or a buffer.\n- Then output all the results, each on its own line.\n\nAlternatively, since each query is independent, perhaps process each query as we read it, and immediately print the result. Wait, but the original Python code reads all queries first, then computes all outputs. The outputs are collected and then printed all at once, which in C would be better as well to do it in same order, so perhaps better to collect the results first and then output all. But for large T, maybe memory can be a problem, but given that T is probably manageable.\n\nAssuming that the problem requires the outputs in order, after all inputs have been read as in the Python code, then storing all the inputs first is better.\n\nSo, steps in more detail:\n\nIn C, the code will be:\n\n- Read T.\n- Dynamically allocate an array of structs for T queries.\n- Read each of the T lines into the struct array.\n- Create an array of strings (char pointers) for the results, each being either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n- Iterate through each query in the array, compute the result, store in the result array.\n- Finally, print each result in order followed by a newline.\n\nBut handling strings in C can be a bit tricky. For each result, we can store either a pointer to \"Yes\" or \"No\", but since these are static strings, but in C, we can just have an array of char pointers pointing to \"Yes\" and \"No\".\n\nWait, but in C, \"Yes\" and \"No\" are static strings. So for each result, we can have an array of char pointers, pointing to either \"Yes\" or \"No\". Let me think:\n\nAlternatively, for each query, we can allocate a string, but that's more work. Since all we need is to output \"Yes\" or \"No\" per line, perhaps the result can be stored as a character array of pointers. Let me see:\n\nWe can have an array of char* results, each holding \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nIn code:\n\nstruct Query {\n    int a, b, c;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    int T;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n    struct Query *queries = malloc(T * sizeof(struct Query));\n    for(int i=0; i<T; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &queries[i].a, &queries[i].b, &queries[i].c);\n    }\n    char **results = malloc(T * sizeof(char*));\n    for(int i=0; i<T; i++) {\n        int k = queries[i].a / queries[i].b;\n        if(k * queries[i].c >= queries[i].a) {\n            results[i] = \"Yes\";\n        } else {\n            results[i] = \"No\";\n        }\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i<T; i++) {\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", results[i]);\n    }\n    free(queries);\n    free(results);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, but in C, strings are arrays of characters, but using pointers here points to the string literals. So the memory is okay since \"Yes\" and \"No\" are stored in read-only memory, but assigning the pointer is okay as long as you don't modify the strings.\n\nWait, yes, this is allowed. So the code above should work. But let me think again about integer division.\n\nWait the Python code uses integer division with //. In C, when both operands are integers, the division is integer division discarding the remainder, but in cases where numbers are negative, it's different. However, in the problem constraints (probably, since it's from a programming competition problem) inputs are positive. But the code must handle it as per Python's division.\n\nWait, the problem may have a and b positive. Let's see:\n\nIn Python, 7//2 is 3, and 7//3 is 2, etc. In C, 7/3 gives 2.\n\nSame for positive numbers. So for positive a and b, the division is okay. But in case of negative numbers?\n\nWell, the problem probably assumes a and b are positive. So in that case, it's okay.\n\nSo the division in C is okay as queries[i].a / queries[i].b.\n\nTherefore, this code should be correct.\n\nWait but in Python, query[0] // query[1] is doing floor division. For negative numbers, like -7 // 2 is -4, but in C, -7/2 is -3 (since integer division truncates towards zero). Hmm, but if the problem's inputs are all positive numbers, then no problem. Since the code is from Codeforces problem 397 B, probably the inputs are such that a and b are positive. So the code should be okay.\n\nThus, the C translation would be as above.\n\nWait, but the original Python code has a class with methods. But in C, the code would be structured in a main function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the C code can be written in a more procedural way without using structures, but I think using a structure is better here for clarity.\n\nNow, another point: in the Python code, each query is a list of three numbers. So in C, we can read them into a structure, but each query is stored as a struct.\n\nThe code I wrote earlier looks correct. Let me write it step by step.\n\nFirst, the structure definition:\n\nstruct Query {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n    int c;\n};\n\nThen in main:\n\nRead T, read each line for T queries, store in array of Query structs.\n\nThen process each query.\n\nWait, but when using scanf, you have to be careful with the input format. The Python code uses input().split(\" \"), which splits on any whitespace.\n\nIn C, the scanf can do \"%d %d %d\" for each line, provided that there are exactly three integers per line, and separated by whitespace.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses self.queries in the Python code as a list of lists. So each query's elements are stored directly. So in structs it's okay.\n\nNow, the second part is the result array. We can create an array of pointers where each points to \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, you could use a character array for each line, but that's more complex. Since \"Yes\" is 4 characters and \"No\" is 3 (including null terminator), you can preallocate for each result's maximum length.\n\nBut using pointers to the strings \"Yes\" and \"No\" is simpler. But since these are string literals, they are stored in read-only memory. Assigning pointers to them is okay, but you can't modify the strings. Since we just read them, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, you can allocate each result as a new string:\n\nBut for the result, maybe better to use an array of arrays. Like, each result is stored as a char[4], since \"Yes\" is 4 characters (including null).\n\nWait, \"Yes\" has length 3, with '\\0' as fourth.\n\nHmm, \"Yes\" is Y-e-s-\\0, 4 bytes. \"No\" is N-o-\\0, 3 bytes. So to be safe, allocate 4 chars per string.\n\nSo for each result, in C, perhaps:\n\nchar **result is not appropriate. Alternatively, have a 2D array of char:\n\nchar *results[T]; where each element points to either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nWait that way, each entry is a pointer to a string literal, which is okay. So in that case, the code doesn't need to allocate memory for each string, just assign the pointers. So the code I presented earlier is okay. So that's efficient.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the original Python code's process_task method goes through each query in queries. So the C code does the same.\n\nPotential issues in C code:\n\n- Memory allocation. For malloc, if T is zero or so. But the problem probably requires T to be a positive integer.\n\n- Overflow? For large numbers, but in C, using int might be okay. The problem's constraints probably specify that the numbers fit into 32-bit integers. So assuming that the inputs are integers within the 32-bit int limits, which is a safe assumption for programming contest problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother possible optimization: since the results are only \"Yes\" or \"No\", we could store a boolean array and then print accordingly. Like, have a char *array, and for each element, choose the string at output time.\n\nWait, in the code, you could just compute the strings at the time of printing, rather than storing them. Let me see:\n\nAlternative plan: process each query immediately when reading them, then collect the output in an array of pointers, or even better, just print out the result as you read each query. Wait is that possible? Let me think.\n\nIn the original Python code's structure, it reads all the queries first, then processes them. Thus, if you have to process them after collecting all, perhaps that's necessary. However, in the C code, you can read a query, process it, and immediately output the result, which might be more memory efficient, especially for large T.\n\nWait, but in the Python code, the result is built as a list and then joined with newlines. If the problem requires all input to be read before any output, then you would have to process all queries first. But in typical programming competition problems, I think you can process each query as it comes.\n\nWait looking at the problem's likely constraints: the problem may have input that is T followed by T lines, but the output is T lines, each in correspondence with the input lines. So each output line is determined solely by the corresponding input line, i.e., queries are independent.\n\nLooking at the code, each query is processed independently. So the output for each can be produced as soon as it is read. Thus, you can process the code as:\n\nRead T, then loop T times:\n\n- Read a line (the query)\n- Process it\n- Output the result immediately.\n\nThus, you can do all that, avoiding storing all queries in memory. Which would make the code more efficient and simpler.\n\nAh, that's a better approach. So why didn't the Python code do that? Because it's structured as a class with separate methods for reading and processing, but the logic could have been refactored.\n\nThus, in the C code, it can be better to read each query, process, and print right away, which is better. So then, the C code would look like:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int T;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n    for(int i=0; i<T; i++) {\n        int a, b, c;\n        scanf(\"%d %d %d\", &a, &b, &c);\n        int k = a / b;\n        if (k * c >= a) {\n            printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n        } else {\n            printf(\"No\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait, this is way simpler. But does this work correctly?\n\nThis would process each query as it is read, which is okay.\n\nThat's much better. Why didn't I think of that earlier? Oh right, the original Python code reads all queries first into a list and then processes, but that's not necessary. The problem allows processing each query independently, so the code can be simplified.\n\nWait, but what about the division a//b in Python vs a/b in C when a and b can be something like a =7, b=2: 7//2 is 3 in Python, 7/2 is 3 in C too. So same result. If a was 5 and b=2, then 2 vs 2.5. 5//2 is 2 in Python, and 5/2 is 2 in C.\n\nBut if b divides a, then it's exactly. So the same. So that code works.\n\nThus this simple code would work, and is better because it doesn't need to store any queries, saving memory.\n\nSo then, why the original Python code was written that way? Maybe for the sake of code structure in a competition submission (using a class structure perhaps), but the actual computation can be done inline.\n\nTherefore, the correct C translation would be the simple loop per query, processing each as it's read.\n\nTherefore, the user's Python code can be optimized in C as the code above, without structures and without big dynamic arrays.\n\nYes, so the answer is the simplified code."
