Alternatively, let me proceed. Declare PC as an array. Using a 2D array. Let's say:\n\nint PC[D][2]; Wait, but D's value is known only at runtime, so a static array won't work. So in C, to have an array whose size is determined at runtime, we need to use a pointer and malloc. For example:\n\nAfter reading D and G from input, allocate the array:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n\nThen:\n\nint** PC = (int**)malloc(D * sizeof(int*));\nfor (int i = 0; i < D; ++i) {\n    PC[i] = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));\n} But maybe that's tedious. Alternatively, using a 2D array allocated with:\n\nint (*PC)[2] = malloc(D * sizeof(*PC));\n\nWait, that would be a 2D array where each row has 2 elements. That might be better, since it's contiguous in memory, but perhaps making it a struct is clearer. Alternatively, since each line has two integers, we can read them like:\n\nfor each of the D lines:\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[j][0], &PC[j][1]); So, in code, after reading D and G first, then loop D times to read the PC elements. Now the main part is the loops over all possible subsets (i loops 0 to (2^D - 1)). In Python, (i >> j) & 1 checks if the j-th bit is set in the bitmask.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Python code into C. Let me start by understanding what the Python code does. \n\nThe problem seems to involve some kind of combination of problems from different days, calculating scores, and finding the minimum number of problems needed. The code uses bitmasking to iterate through all subsets of the days (since for each day D, there are 2^D possibilities). For each subset, it calculates the score and the number of problems solved. Then it checks if the current score is less than or equal to G and tries to add the remaining points by taking some problems from the other days not in the subset. If the total meets G, it updates the answer. The goal is to find the minimum number of problems required.\n\nNow translating this to C. Let's see the variables and steps:\n\nFirst, the Python reads D and G from input using input().split(). Then PC is a list of D tuples, each tuple being the split of the input line. Then there's the loop over 2**D possible bitmasks, and so on.\n\nIn C, I need to handle input, loops with bitmask, etc. Let's structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, variables in Python:\n\n- D is an integer, G is an integer\n- PC is an array of tuples (each tuple has PC[j][0], PC[j][1])\n- ans is initialized to 1e9 (which is a large number)\n\nSo in C code, variables would be:\n\nint D, G;\nThen need to read D and G from input. Sscanf can read them from stdin.\n\nThen the PC array in C. Maybe an array of structs? Or two arrays, one for the counts and one for scores? Or perhaps 2D array. A 2D array would work here.\n\nFor example, int PC[D][2]. Wait, but in C, the variable-length arrays (VLA) are allowed in some compilers, but not standard C. Hmm. Wait, D can be up to what? The problem's constraints for D? Let me assume that in the problem statement, D is manageable, like up to 30, since 2^30 is too big? Maybe the original code might have a limit? The original Python loops for 2^D \u2013 so for D=30, that's 1e9 iterations, which would be way too slow. Maybe D isn't that big? Because the Python code might use itertools or bitmasking for D up to like 14, where 2^14 is 16k, which is manageable? Well, assuming D is small enough for bitmask loops.\n\nAssuming that D is small enough, perhaps we can read it and use an array. Let's see, for now, we can just proceed, but in C arrays need a fixed size, so perhaps using VLA is possible. Or maybe a dynamic allocation. Wait, maybe the code can have D up to say 20 bits. Let's see, but since the problem is from CodeForces or a similar competition, maybe the constraints can be deduced.\n\nAlternatively, let me proceed.\n\n Declare PC as an array. Using a 2D array. Let's say:\n\nint PC[D][2]; \n\nWait, but D's value is known only at runtime, so a static array won't work. So in C, to have an array whose size is determined at runtime, we need to use a pointer and malloc. For example:\n\nAfter reading D and G from input, allocate the array:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n\nThen:\n\nint** PC = (int**)malloc(D * sizeof(int*));\nfor (int i = 0; i < D; ++i) {\n    PC[i] = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));\n}\n\nBut maybe that's tedious. Alternatively, using a 2D array allocated with:\n\nint (*PC)[2] = malloc(D * sizeof(*PC));\n\nWait, that would be a 2D array where each row has 2 elements. That might be better, since it's contiguous in memory, but perhaps making it a struct is clearer.\n\nAlternatively, since each line has two integers, we can read them like:\n\nfor each of the D lines:\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[j][0], &PC[j][1]);\n\nSo, in code, after reading D and G first, then loop D times to read the PC elements.\n\nNow the main part is the loops over all possible subsets (i loops 0 to (2^D - 1)).\n\nIn Python, (i >> j) & 1 checks if the j-th bit is set in the bitmask. Same in C, but using bitwise operators.\n\nThen for each subset i, we compute score and problem (problem count). Wait in the Python code:\n\nscore starts at 0, then for each j (day), if the bit is set, adds 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] (since 0-based, j+1 gives the day number, which is from 1 to D). Plus PC[j][1]. The problem count is PC[j][0], summing that.\n\nWait in Python code:\n\nscore starts at 0, and problem is 0. For each j from 0 to D-1 (since D days?), if set, add:\n\nscore += 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]\n\nproblem += PC[j][0]\n\nThen, after computing all bits where set, check if the current score is > G. If so, continue, i.e., skip further processing.\n\nWait, if the current subset's score is already over G, then there's no need to consider adding any more points (since adding more would only increase score). So that path is skipped.\n\nOtherwise, we need to find how much more points are needed, then see if we can take some problems from the remaining days (those not selected in the bitmask).\n\nThe left is (G - score), but since score is already less than or equal to G? So left could be >=0.\n\nThen, for each j from 0 to D-1 not selected (i's j-th bit is 0?), we need to see whether adding additional problems from that day can contribute to the left.\n\nWait the code loops through the same D days again, but for j where bit is not set (i.e., the day not in the subset). For each such day, if we can take some of its problems (since the subset hasn't taken those, so those can be added). \n\nThe line:\n\nif (i >> j)&1 is true, then continue, skip that day. So for days not selected (bit not set), proceed.\n\nWait the code is looping over all days again, but in the code's third loop (the \"for j in range(D):\" after the initial check), the \"if (i >> j) &1\" would continue, so for days NOT in the subset, it considers them for adding their remaining points.\n\nThe code calculates how many more problems you can take from that day, and if adding them reaches G, then it might find a better 'ans'.\n\nIn this code's section, for each day not in the subset, we can take some of their problems (but not all, unless necessary).\n\nIn Python:\n\nleft = G - score\n\nthen for each j not selected (bit not set):\n\nif (left > ...) ?\n\nWait, the logic is:\n\nif taking all problems from that day (but the day wasn't selected in the bitmask), which contributes 100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1] ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the code's current setup (the rest of the code), perhaps the code checks what is the maximum possible contribution from adding some problems from that day.\n\nHmm, maybe the code is looking to take some of the problems from that day's not included day.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is:\n\nThe current score (from the initial subset) is S. Since S < G, we need to add enough points from any day not in the subset. Each problem in day k contributes 100*(k+1) points. (Wait, the PC's first element is the number of problems in day k? Let me think:\n\nLooking at the problem's code. The initial selection includes taking PC[j][0] problems, which gives 100*(j+1) * that count plus PC[j][1]. \n\nWait, maybe PC stores the details of each day as (number_of_problems, bonus). So when you choose a day, you take all its PC[j][0] problems (so that gives (j+1)*100 multiplied by that number, then add the bonus). \n\nWait, the Python code when a day is selected adds the full PC[j][0] problems, but in the later loop, perhaps the idea is to take some of the problems from a day not taken in the subset. But since the day wasn't taken, the code can pick how many problems from that day to get up to \"left\" points?\n\nWait wait, let's think again:\n\nThe left is G - current_score. The main subset S is all days with a set bit. So the current_score is sum from S's days: (j+1)*100 * PC[j][0], plus their bonuses, etc.\n\nThen, to reach at least G, you might need to add points from days not selected. The possible points are adding some problems from those days not in the subset. So for a day j not in the subset, when you take the first m problems from it (since they were not taken before?), but how is that calculated?\n\nWait in the code:\n\nFor days not taken in the subset (bit not set), then for j in those days:\n\nthe problem not taken in the subset. So maybe, adding some of the problems from that day (since they are not in the original subset). The points added would be 100*(j+1) * x where x is the number of problems selected (up to PC[j][0]).\n\nThe problem is trying to cover the left.\n\nThe code says:\n\nif left > (100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]): then pass (probably can't get enough from that day)\n\nElse:\n\nthe required number of problems to solve to cover left is calculated via (left + 100*(j+1) -1 ) // (100*(j+1)), but since each problem gives 100*(j+1) points each (since it's the same per problem).\n\nWait the \"tmp\" is the number of questions needed from day j. \n\nWait let's see, each problem in day j contributes 100*(j+1) points. To reach 'needed' points, the minimal number of problems is ceil( left_needed / (100*(j+1)) )). \n\nWait yes.\n\nSo in that way, the required number of problems is tmp = ceil( left / (100*(j+1)) ), but since in C, (a + (b-1))/b gives the same as ceiling.\n\nThe code then takes the minimum between that tmp and PC[j][0], meaning if even taking all the problems from that day isn't enough, then it can be used, but only if that gives enough.\n\nBut the condition for this code to happen must satisfy that (the total bonus from fully taking that day isn't enough?), no, but the first condition checks whether:\n\nif (the possible maximum addition from this day is not enough (if the required left is more than 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] (since PC[j][1] is bonus? or is that included?)\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the bonus.\n\nThe initial calculation for the selected days includes the bonus (each selected day's PC[j][1] is added). But for a day not selected, the bonus is not adding. So when adding problems from a day not selected in the subset, their contribution is only the per-problem points (each problem is 100*(j+1)), and the bonus is NOT included?\n\nHmm, this is crucial.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe code for the initial subset:\n\nif (i >> j) & 1: (the bit is set, day j is selected in the subset)\n\nThen:\n\nscore += 100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]\n\nproblem += PC[j][0]\n\nThus, the bonus (PC[j][1]) is added when the day is included in the subset. So when you're taking problems from a day not in the subset, you don't get the bonus. Thus, the contribution from taking x problems from that day (not in subset) would be 100*(j+1)*x points. You can choose any x from 1 to PC[j][0], but only to get at least the remaining left.\n\nWait the problem is not to hit exactly G, but to reach at least G. So the minimal number of problems needed from the days not in the subset.\n\nHence, for a day j not in subset:\n\nThe maximum possible points from that day is (number of problems as many as they have) times their per-problem points, because their bonus is only added when the subset includes the day. So for which, this day's bonus is not considered here since it wasn't selected.\n\nThus, for day j not selected, the possible contribution is x * (100*(j+1)), and choosing the minimal x where x*(term) >= needed points (left). \n\nThe code's first condition checks whether the maximum possible contribution from that day ( PC[j][0] * 100*(j+1) ) is more than the needed \"left\".\n\nWait, the code's first line in that loop is:\n\nif left > 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]:\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nIn the Python code:\n\nif left > 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]:\n\nBut where did PC[j][1] come from here? That's confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nAh! Wait the code is considering whether the \"left\" can be obtained by taking the maximum possible from that day? No, because when you are not taking the day, the bonus is not added. \n\nWait, perhaps this line is incorrect in my interpretation.\n\nLooking at the line in the Python code (third loop):\n\nfor j in range(D):\n\n    if (i >> j) &1: continue\n\n    if left > 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]:\n\n        pass\n\n    else:\n\n        tmp = (left + 100*(j+1) -1) // (100*(j+1))\n\n        ...\n\nWait this is possibly a mistake. Why would the PC[j][1] be part of the equation here? Since the day j isn't selected in the subset i, the bonus (PC[j][1]) doesn't get added. So in this code's check, the \"100*... + PC[j][1]\" is incorrect here.\n\nWait that's a possible error. Because when we're considering a day j not in the subset, the maximum points you can get by taking that day's problems (but without selecting the day, which means bonus is not added), then the potential points would be 100*(j+1)*number_of_problems_taken (max is 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0]). So the code's first condition, adding the PC[j][1] might be wrong here.\n\nThis could be a serious mistake in the Python code. If that's the case, perhaps I need to see why that's done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial selection didn't take the day, but perhaps the code is trying to include the day's bonus by taking all its problems, which isn't the case. Because, to get the bonus, the day needs to have been selected (when we added that day's terms with PC[j][1]. \n\nThis indicates that perhaps the Python code has a mistake here, but I must work with the given code and translate accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the code in Python includes the bonus in that (possible max points from day j not in the subset), even though that can't happen. So, perhaps that part is incorrect. But since the user provided the code, I need to just translate it.\n\nTherefore, in the code's third loop's if condition, even if the bonus is being considered where it shouldn't, the C code must replicate that exactly.\n\nTherefore, to proceed, I need to proceed with the original code's logic. The code might have a bug, but my task is to translate, not fix it.\n\nSo in the C version, the same logic: when considering a day not selected, the code computes whether the possible maximum (including the day's bonus) could be taken? But since you can't get that because the day wasn't selected. Hmm. Well, perhaps an error in original code.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be considering whether to add the day entirely (explaining where the bonus comes in, but it's somewhat conflicting). However, given the problem, the user wants the code translated correctly, regardless of that.\n\nSo moving on, now the code's structure.\n\nLoop over all i in 0 to 2^D - 1:\n\nfor i in range(2**D):\n\nIn C, this would be a loop over i from 0 to (pow(2, D) - 1). But since 2^D may be very large for D=20, but since in the problem, likely constrained to manageable D (e.g., up to 14, so 2^14=16384).\n\nThus, in C:\n\nfor (i=0; i < (1 << D); i++ )\n\nYes, since 1 << D is 2^D.\n\nSo the outer loop would be:\n\nint i;\n\nfor(i = 0; i < (1 << D); i++) { ... }\n\nThen, inside that, for each bit j:\n\nfor (j from 0 to D-1):\n\nif (bit is set):\n\nadd to score and problem counts.\n\nThen, after calculating, if score > G: continue (skip rest of the processing).\n\nElse:\n\ncompute left = G - score.\n\nand then for each j in D again:\n\nchecking if that j is not set.\n\nWait, the code loops through j from 0 to D-1 again, but skips the j's that are set. \n\nWait, inside the third loop (over the days again):\n\nfor j in 0 to D-1:\n\n    if (i has the bit set for j): continue\n\n    else:\n\n        proceed.\n\nSo the C code does the same:\n\nfor (j=0; j<D; j++){\n\n   if ( (i >> j) &1 )\n\n        continue;\n\n... rest.\n\nNow the calculation inside the third loop:\n\nif left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]):\n\nThe code says pass, which skips doing anything with that day.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute tmp = (left + 100*(j+1) -1) // (100*(j+1))\n\nSo tmp = ceil( left/(100*(j+1)) )\n\nand since you can't take more than PC[j][0], so min(tmp, PC[j][0])\n\nthen, the candidate answer is problem + tmp (since problem is the initial count from the subset i, and adding tmp from this day j not selected). \n\nThen the ans is the minimum of all these possible candidates.\n\nThus, each time in this part, if the required number of problems is possible (i.e., tmp <= PC[j][0] or tmp exceeds it? Well, because the check was if left <= max, the first part, that 'max' includes PC[j][0] * the per point and the bonus? Hmm, but maybe in the else part, even if the PC[j][0] can provide sufficient points, since the left is within that?\n\nWait in the condition, if left exceeds the possible maximum (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]), perhaps. \n\nWait, but the code had (the condition uses the bonus here?), but we know this day is not selected. So that's perhaps a bug. But in any case, let's note that.\n\nNow, the tmp calculation's (left + term -1)/ (denominator) is integer division in Python with floor? Well in Python, // does floor division. Since in C, the division is integer division towards zero. So to replicate ceiling division:\n\nleft divided by denominator (100*(j+1)) but always rounded up.\n\nThus:\n\nnumerator = left\n\ndenominator = 100*(j+1)\n\ntmp = (numerator + denominator -1 ) / denominator;\n\nIn C, integers, so: (left + (100*(j+1) -1)) / (100*(j+1))\n\nWait, yes. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nThe C code must compute that. \n\nThen, ans is the minimum between itself and (problem + tmp), but only if tmp is <= PC[j][0]. Because we are taking the minimum of tmp and PC[j][0], which could be the smaller. \n\nWait, the min between tmp and PC[j][0] because tmp is the required problems, but if the available problems (PC[j][0]) are more than what is needed, you can just take the required. But if the PC[j][0] is smaller, then you have to take all of them, but check if that covers.\n\nWait wait no. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the required problems tmp is the minimal needed to reach at least 'left'. \n\nBut PC[j][0] is the total number of possible problems on day j, so you can't take more than PC[j][0]. Thus, if tmp exceeds PC[j][0], then you cannot get enough from that day. \n\nHence, in the code, the else clause: we do the else only if left can be covered by taking the maximum available from that particular. So the first condition:\n\nif left > (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]):\n\nthen we cannot get that day's problems to cover the needed left (since the max possible from that day is ( PC[j][0]* 100*(j+1 )) (but why add their bonus? maybe the code has this wrong here)\n\nSo the code proceeds only if the required left is <= (PC[j][0]* (100*(j+1)) + PC[j][1]) ?\n\nWait, but that term adds the bonus, which is not part of this day's contribution unless it was included in the initial subset. \n\nSo, the logic might be flawed here, but again, proceed.\n\nIn the code's logic, if left is greater than (the day's contribution if we took it as part of subset (including the bonus)), then passing, meaning that we can't use this day to cover the remaining left. Because even taking all problems and the bonus from this day (as if we included it in the subset) wouldn't satisfy the 'left' needed. \n\nBut this is correct in the case when you decide to include the day into the subset. But since you are considering not including them. So this logic is conflicting.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing, but perhaps just translate the code as is.\n\nThe C code can proceed, but in the condition:\n\nif (left > ( 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1] ) ) \n\nthen continue, probably using pass, meaning do nothing for this day.\n\nElse:\n\nthen compute tmp.\n\nWait the code has the else block. So when the above condition is not met (left <= that term), then it computes the required tmp.\n\nNow, the computation in code would require that:\n\nproblem + tmp's sum and compare with current ans.\n\nSo in C, after computing the 'tmp' as:\n\ntmp = (left + (100*(j+1) -1 )) / (100*(j+1))\n\nthen, tmp_needed = tmp \n\nthen, take min(tmp_needed, PC[j][0])\n\nsum_added = problem + min(tmp_needed, PC[j][0])\n\nthen compare with ans.\n\nThus, updating the ans each time.\n\nNow translating into C.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nThe code starts with D and G as the first two numbers.\n\nThen PC array which is D elements each with two integers. \n\nImplement:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <limits.h>  // for maximum values.\n\n// Since we need to allocate an array based on D, which is runtime, we'll have to dynamically allocate memory.\n\nint main() {\n\n    int D, G;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n\n    // Now read D lines, each with two integers.\n    // Need an array to store them.\n    int **PC; // Not sure yet. Maybe 2D array.\n\n    // Using a 2D array allocated with malloc:\n    PC = (int**)malloc(D * sizeof(int *));\n    for(int i =0; i < D; i++) {\n        PC[i] = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));\n    }\n\n    // Read each line into PC[j]\n    for(int i =0; i < D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[i][0], &PC[i][1]);\n    }\n\n    // Now, the rest variables:\n    int ans = 1e9; // Probably set to a big number, but 1e9 is manageable? C needs ans to be an int. 1e9 is 10^9, but max value for int might be 2e9, okay.\n\n    int i,j;\n\n    for (i=0; i < (1 << D); i++) {\n        int score =0;\n        int problem =0;\n        for (j=0; j < D; j++) {\n            if( (i >> j) & 1) { // if bit is set\n                score += 100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1];\n                problem += PC[j][0];\n            }\n        }\n        if(score > G) continue;\n\n        // Now, compute left.\n        int left = G - score;\n        // Check all days not selected.\n        for(j=0; j < D; j++) {\n            if( (i >> j) & 1) continue; // skip selected days\n            // Check the condition\n            if( left > (100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]) ) { // this is the condition\n                // do nothing; continue \n                continue; // since in pyhton, passing means continue\n            } else { // enter else block\n                // compute tmp\n                int den = 100*(j+1);\n                // compute tmp = ceil( left/den )\n                int tmp = (left + den -1 ) / den;\n                // min with PC[j][0]\n                int take = (tmp < PC[j][0] ) ? tmp : PC[j][0];\n                // so the total is problem + take, and compare with ans.\n                int candidate = problem + take;\n                if( candidate < ans ) ans = candidate;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait wait, but after handling all possible paths for the current bitmask, do we need to check whether the problem's count plus take is indeed sufficient to cover the left? Because the code in Python might assume that because the 'else' part passed, taking 'take' problems would get to the required.\n\nBut let me see:\n\nIn Python's code's else condition: (left <= (100(n)*P0 + pc1) )\n\nWhich (in the case where this day isn't selected, but the code considers the bonus as part of that day's max. Regardless, if that somehow holds, then proceeding.\n\nBut suppose, the necessary 'tmp' could require to have tmp <= PC[j][0].\n\nBecause, if tmp exceeds PC[j][0], then the minimal is min(tmp, PC[j][0}) becomes PC[j][0], but that would only contribute den * PC[j][0]. Which could be insufficient?\n\nWait, but the earlier 'if' condition avoids this?\n\nNo, let's see:\n\nSuppose the required left is 100:\n\nden is 100, so tmp = 100 / den (den=100?) So tmp would be 1. \n\nBut if PC[j][0] is 0, then take is 0, which can't cover it. But then the 'if' condition would have:\n\nif (left (100) > ( 100* (j+1)*0 + PC[j][1] )) \n\nWhich depends on PC[j][1], but perhaps in the condition, but then it would not proceed? \n\nWait, no, this potential issue is that even with the condition, maybe the code's logic is flawed but the user need it translated. \n\nAnyway, in the code's logic, when we enter the else clause, the maximum possible contribution from that day is (the 100*(j+1)* PC[j]0) + (their bonus which is only when setting the bit). However, since the day in not in the subset, their bonus is not added. So the actual maximum would be 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0], but the code compares against including the bonus.\n\nBut the problem is originally from a programming competition, maybe the code is correct, perhaps the PC[j][1] is not a bonus but another component. Wait, perhaps the problem actually considers that the first is the number of problems, and the second is the bonus points added when you solve all the problems of that day? In that case, when you take all the problems in the day (as in selecting the bit), you get a bonus. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So the code is correct. \n\nThus, the code in Python's first loop sums:\n\nFor a selected day (bit set) \n\nscore += 100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] (the per problem points from all n problems)\n\nthen adds the bonus (PC[j][1]).\n\nBut if not selected (bit not set) then you can take some problems from that day, but you only get per-problem. \n\nIn the second part, for a day not selected, if you choose to take some number of problems (up to PC[j][0] ) from that day, the max points is 100*(j+1)* PC[j][0], which is the \"without the bonus\".\n\nThus, the first condition is:\n\nleft <= (total from this days problems (non-selected, so only per problem) ) \n\nbecause that's the max they can contribute.\n\nSo in the code's condition of the else, the term should just be \"100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] \" and not +PC[j][1]. Thus the condition is incorrect (missing the bonus term shouldn't be there).\n\nBut since the code is provided and I must translate, proceed accordingly.\n\nSo the code's condition is as written. \n\nNow, in the current C code above, when computing tmp, then the code uses problem + take where 'take' is the amount from that day. \n\nHowever, in the Python code, the code only enters the else and updates ans ONCE per day in the ELSE. \n\nWait, no:\n\nIn the code's third loop, after a day j not selected, and condition met, the code computes the minimal tmp and combines it with the initial problem count, then tracks the minimum of these. \n\nThus, for each such day, it may contribute a candidate answer which could reduce ans. \n\nThus, the code must go through each of such days and may update ans multiple times (once per day considered, in that scenario).\n\nThus, the C code I wrote would indeed do the same.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- What if all selected days already give score >=G? Then the initial continue is called, and nothing added, and ans stays minimal (but the initial ans was set to 1e9 if no such cases). \n\nWait, no: the initial 'ans' is set to 1e9. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn Python code:\n\nans is set to 1e9. \n\nIf none of the subset's score (including the possibility of not selecting any subset and going into the else part?), then the else parts might not find any valid path, leading ans unchanged. \n\nWait maybe a minimal case. Suppose the case where no subset has total score less than or equal to G, so you just iterate over none of them, so ans remains as 1e9? Then the output would be 1e9, which may be wrong. \n\nBut perhaps such cases are handled differently. But that's a problem with the code.\n\nNow, in C code, variables initializations must be correct. \n\nThe initial 'ans' should be set to a huge number. In the code i have set as '1e9', but in C, the ' ' is needed for integer. \n\nWait, 1e9 in Python is 10^9, in C, 1e9 is a double. But as an int, 1e9 is okay if the number fits in an int (which up to 1e9 is okay in 32-bit system, as 2^31 is about 2e9).\n\nThus initializing ans with 1000000000.\n\nThus in C code:\n\nint ans = 1000000000;\n\nNow, compiling that code could have some issues. \n\nWait, code in C:\n\nThe PC array is allocated as a double pointer. Each row is dynamically allocated. \n\nAlternatively, to simplify, since each row has two elements, perhaps using a single array of pairs:\n\nint PC[D][2]; \n\nBut in this case, VLA (Variable Length Arrays) are only allowed in C99 and not in some environments (like Visual Studio). \n\nHmm, but if the problem assumes the submission uses a standard compliant compiler, then okay. Let me see the code size.\n\nAlternatively, allocate all in one malloc.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to rewrite the C code using VLA assuming D is a variable.\n\nSo let me try rewriting in such a way:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int D, G;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n\n    int PC[D][2]; // VLA\n    for (int i=0; i<D; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[i][0], &PC[i][1]);\n    }\n\n    int ans = 1e9;\n    for (int i=0; i < (1 << D); i++) {\n        int score = 0, problem = 0;\n        for (int j=0; j<D; j++) {\n            if ( (i >> j) & 1 ) {\n                score += 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1];\n                problem += PC[j][0];\n            }\n        }\n        if (score > G) continue;\n\n        int left = G - score;\n        for (int j=0; j<D; j++) {\n            if( (i >> j) & 1 ) continue;\n            if ( left > ( (100*(j+1)*PC[j][0]) + PC[j][1] ) ) continue;\n            // compute tmp\n            int den = 100*(j+1);\n            int tmp = (left + den -1)/den;\n            int take = tmp < PC[j][0] ? tmp : PC[j][0];\n            int candidate = problem + take;\n            if(candidate >= 0 && candidate < ans) { // avoid if negative?\n                ans = candidate;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans); // but if ans remained at initial value, but in cases where it's possible to get it down? \n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWait this is better using VLA and less dynamic memory. \n\nThis might be preferable. \n\nHowever, variable-length array is a C extension requiring a C99 compiler.\n\nAlso in the calculation of candidate:\n\nWhat if the candidate is -infinity? Well, ans is initially set to 1e9, so any valid candidate less than that will set it properly. The \"problem\" variable counts the initial selected problems (always non-negative?), yes. \n\nNow the loop must run all possibilities, leading to ans being set to the minimal value. \n\nWait what about when the full score from all selected subsets allows to reach G?\n\nFor example: if the current subset's score is exactly G? Then the 'left' is zero, so the day loop can choose not to take any problems (take zero) giving the candidate as problem +0. So this is a valid candidate.\n\nHmm. Wait in the code's third loop, the case where left can be covered even by adding zero from the other days.\n\nWait in that case:\n\nif left ==0. Then in the third loop:\n\nfor each j in days not selected:\n\nthe condition: \n\nif 0 > ( ... )\n\nif (0 <= ... (max)), then we proceed.\n\nThen compute tmp as zero? \n\nBecause left is zero \u2192 tmp = (0 + den-1)/den \u2192 which is 0? No, wait:\n\ntmp = ceil(0/den) \u2192 ceil(0) =0. \n\nThus the 'take' is zero.\n\nThen the candidate is problem +0. Which is better than ans (which might have been 1e9 before).\n\nSo in this case, this would be counted. So the code will consider the solution of choosing the subset i and none of the additional, which is exactly correct (the problem count is right).\n\nSo that case is handled properly.\n\nThus the code seems okay.\n\nNow need to test edge cases.\n\nAnother possible mistake in my C translation:\n\nIn the first loop for bit selection:\n\nThe inner loop for j in 0 to D-1, so the bits are numbered from 0 to D-1, corresponding to each day.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error in the code is the line:\n\nif (left> ... ), in the else clause compute the 'take' and then problem + take.\n\nBut what's the effect of combining multiple days?\n\nWait, the code tests adding the least number of problem needed by considering any one day not selected. Because in each iteration of the outer loop (for bitmask i), for each day not selected, we compute what could be gotten by taking some of that day's problems, but not the combination of multiple days. \n\nWait, the algorithm's logic may be missing some cases: the code is only allowing to take additional problems from *one* day not selected? Because in the third block, for each not selected day, it considers adding some from that day, but not more than one.\n\nAh! This is a crucial point. The code as written considers only adding additional points from a single unselected day.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to take unselected days' problems to the maximum possible, whichever is better. \n\nWait, perhaps the code in Python is flawed in this aspect.\n\nLet me think:\n\nScenario: To reach G, you might need to take a couple of unselected days' problems to get the needed points. But the code only takes one day's contribution, ignoring using two or more days. \n\nWait the code's current logic loops through each unselected day and sees \"what if I take as many points as needed from just this day\".\n\nThen, for example, when the sum of taking some from this day is insufficient, but taking a little from this and some other day could suffice, but the code doesn't consider this combination. \n\nThus the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem, and if the Python code has such a bug, then translating it is necessary, but this must be the case?\n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that when you choose subset S (days selected), you can pick from all the remaining days to take any number of problems (not just from one day) to cover the remaining points.\n\nBut the code is only considering days one day at a time (getting the minimal from each day, and taking the minimal over all days). \n\nWait the code's logic could work because considering any of the unselected days:\n\nThe minimum additional required is ceil(left / (cost)), but the minimal over all days is the chosen (because we are taking the minimal of the worst case), but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that after selecting a subset of days (including bonuses), you can take any number of the problems not in those days (up to their counts) from any days and their total points must be at least the needed left.\n\nThe minimal count is to choose the day with the smallest problem per point contribution.\n\nBecause the per-unit point cost for each day is 100*(j+1). \n\nThus the optimal strategy to cover \"left\" units is to choose the day with the smallest (100(j+1)) per problem) so taking as many as possible from that day (as much as possible), and then use another if needed.\n\nThus, to get the absolute minimal problems, it is sufficient to consider using any one single unselected day. \n\nBecause that day is the cheapest option (if we take the cheapest day's contribution, that will require least questions).\n\nOther combinations (like taking from two days that are expensive) won't help.\n\nTherefore, to find the best, you need to look at all unselected days and see which one allows you to cover the left with fewest problems. \n\nThus the logic in the code is correct: For each day not taken in the subset, check the required problems to cover the left. Then the minimal among all such candidates would be the best option for that subset (in terms of minimal added questions). \n\nFurthermore, the loop over all the days' possible contributions allows finding that minimal. \n\nThus the code is correct in its algorithm's logic. \n\nThus the C code I wrote is correct (assuming of course I have implemented the code accurately). \n\nNow, in the code I wrote, after the third loop, there is a line:\n\nif(candidate < ans) ans = candidate;\n\nYes. All paths where the candidate is smaller than the old ans.\n\nThus that should work. \n\nTesting when the non-selected day can't help:\n\nSuppose left is 1000, but one unselected day has 100*(j+1)= 200, so takes 5 (ceil(1000/200)=5) but PC[j][0] is 4 (so 4*200=800 < 1000; thus the condition is that the left is > (the max possible from that day (4*200) + PC[j][1] ?), thus the condition is satisfied (1000 > (4*200 + PC[...] )). Thus, the 'if' condition is triggered, and we skip this day.\n\nThus, that day is not a candidate. \n\nOnly days whose maximum possible contribute to the left (if max possible from day is >= left) or at least enough to possibly contribute (even with the condition involving bonus which might include it).\n\nThus, the code is as per the original's logic.\n\nThus the C code can now be written using the code I wrote but with the VLA.\n\nChecking the code again:\n\nWait, in the VLA version:\n\nThe first loop for the PC array:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<D; i++)\n\nYes.\n\nScore calculations:\n\nThe inner loops are okay.\n\nThe 'left' is computed as G - score, assuming score <= G.\n\nIn the third loop:\n\nEach day j not selected, then the condition is:\n\nleft > (100*(j+1)* PC[j][0] + PC[j][1])\n\nIf yes, continue (so that day can't contribute the needed), so skip.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute tmp as the ceil(left/den).\n\nso, for example, with den = 100*(j+1), and that PC[j][0] has enough (tmp <= PC[j][0]), the candidate would fully cover it with tmp problems, and the candidate is problem + tmp.\n\nBut what if the left is exactly den * PC[j][0] (and thus +bonus is not needed, and the first condition is okay).\n\nWait, the code's condition includes the bonus in case. So let's say a day has PC[j][0] of 3, and bonus 200. \n\nIf the left is 300, and the per-problem is 100 (so, j+1 = 1?), maybe. \n\nThen, PC[j][0] * 100 = 300. The bonus is not added here, but the code's first condition would check if 300> (300+200). No, so the condition allows it to proceed. Then take tmp= 300/100 = 3. (ceiling of 3.0 is 3). So take is min(3,3)=3. \n\nThus the problem is indeed covered. So code proceeds.\n\nIn the worst case, perhaps the code might be slightly incorrect because of the bonus in the condition, but that is original code's.\n\nThus, the code is translated properly.\n\nFinal points:\n\nThe program may have an initial value of ans = 1e9. But in cases where no subset's score is within or below G, then nowhere is ans updated. So ans remains 1e9, which may be the correct answer (if even after taking all the days, the maximum score obtained is not enough). \n\nWait wait, if the best case is to take all days, but that gives a score under G:\n\nWait No, if the subset of all days is considered. Then:\n\nscore = sum over all days (100(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1] )\n\nif that is less than G, then that subset is considered, then which requires to add more points from other days (even though all are selected, thus no days are unselected, so the third loop doesn't run, but the 'left is G - totalScore (larger than required)'. \n\nWait then, the third loop would not have any unselected days. \n\nThus:\n\nFor the subset that includes all days, and the total score is less than G:\n\nThen left = G - sum >0.\n\nThere are no unselected days to provide more points. Thus, the third loop runs but has no j's to process. \n\nThus, this case would not be counted. So the only way to achive the needed score is to get exactly or > equal to with the current subset, but the current subset's score is already <G, and needs more points from unselected days (which none exist in this case). \n\nBut since there are none, thecan't make up the needed points. So the subset of all days can be considered, but since the left remains without possible days, the loop does not contribute candidates. \n\nThus, the overall answer would only consider those cases where score plus some of the unselected days' problems is sufficient to get at least G.\n\nThus, the code would not consider the case when even adding all the unselected days' max points might not reach G, and thus skipping such subsets, meaning that there is no valid solution, but the code would not find those. \n\nWait, but the code in its first check: 'if(score> G): continue' \n\nAh, so the subset with all days might have a score below G, but there are no other days to contribute, so it is impossible to reach the required G, thus not counted as candidate. \n\nThus, the answer remains 1e9 (or whatever).\n\nThus the problem requires that at least one subset can reach or surpass G when combined with adding unselected problems.\n\nWait the problem's original intention \u2014 perhaps G is attainable? \n\nBut the problem's code seems to assume that the minimal is found and the initial ans is updated. \n\nThe problem might state that it can always be done. \n\nIn any case, the code is correct per the provided Python.\n\nThus, the final C code with VLA is probably the right way to write it (assuming compiler allows it).\n\nAlternatively to use a dynamic array:\n\nAnother approach, using malloc for a 2D array:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int D, G;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &D, &G);\n    \n    // Read PC\n    int **PC = (int **) malloc(D * sizeof(int *));\n    for(int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\n        PC[i] = (int *)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));\n        scanf(\"%d %d\", &PC[i][0], &PC[i][1]);\n    }\n\n    int ans = 1000000000;\n    for(int i = 0; i < (1 << D); i++) {\n        int score = 0, problem = 0;\n        for(int j = 0; j < D; j++) {\n            if( (i >> j) & 1 ) {\n                score += 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1];\n                problem += PC[j][0];\n            }\n        }\n        if(score > G) continue;\n        \n        int left = G - score;\n        for(int j = 0; j < D; j++) {\n            if( (i >> j) & 1 ) continue;\n            int max_add = 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1]; // wait, but bonus shouldn't count here\n            if( left > max_add ) continue; // condition as per py code lists it\n            int den = 100*(j+1);\n            int tmp = (left + den -1 ) / den; // ceildiv(left,den)\n            int take = tmp < PC[j][0] ? tmp : PC[j][0];\n            ans = (problem + take < ans) ? problem + take : ans;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Following a possible bug check: if all subsets cannot reach G, then answer remains at 1e9???\n\n    for(int i=0; i < D; i++) free(PC[i]);\n    free(PC);\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis version uses dynamic allocation.\n\nThe difference is that in the third loop's condition:\n\nmax_add is computed as 100*(j+1)*PC[j][0] + PC[j][1], but that includes the bonus. \n\nBut per the problem logic, that day's contribution shouldn't have the bonus unless selected. \n\nThe code is based on the original, so that is accepted.\n\nThis should be correct now."
