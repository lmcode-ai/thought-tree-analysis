Another possible way is to use a one-line calculation for result:\n\nresult = 1 - (x == 1) Wait, but again if (x==1) as .true. becomes -1, so result would be 1 - (-1) =2. No good.

The mask is a logical. So when mask is true, it returns tsource, else fsource. So for mask being x /=1, the tsource is 1, fsource 0. So yes, merge(1,0, x /=1) is correct. Yes. So the code is correct.

So we can use 1*(x/=1) or merge(1,0,...). Because 1 * (x==1) would give 1 when x is 1, 0 otherwise, but that's the opposite. Wait, in that case, the result needs to be 1 - (x==1). So, let me see:\n\nresult = 1 - (x==1) But if in Fortran, (x ==1) is stored as .true. (which is -1?), then 1 - (x==1) would be 1 - (-1) =2 when x is 1, which is not desired.

Wait no. Actually, in Fortran, when you use a logical in an arithmetic expression, it is converted to integer 0 for false and -1 for true, so 1 - (x==1) would evaluate to 1 - (-1)=2 when x is 1, which is bad.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program seems straightforward. Let's go through it step by step. The class is named atcoder_ABC178_A, and the main method is where everything happens. \n\nFirst, a Scanner is created to read input from standard input. Then, they read an integer x using scan.next(), parse it to an integer. \n\nNext, there's a boolean variable bool which is set to true if x is 1, else false. Then, the result is computed as !bool ? 1 : 0, which I think means if bool is false, result is 1, else 0. Wait, because !bool would be the opposite of bool. So when x is 1, bool is true, so !bool is false, so result would be 0. If x isn't 1, then bool is false, so !bool is true, so result is 1. So basically the result is 1 when x is not 1, and 0 when it is 1. So the program is outputting 0 if the input is 1, else 1. \n\nHmm, maybe they could have just done result = (x != 1) ? 1 :0; or even result = 1 - x; but that's probably not necessary. Anyway, translating this into Fortran.\n\nNow, let's think about how to do this in Fortran. \n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a Scanner like Java. To read input, we can read from the standard input using a read statement. \n\nThe steps needed would be:\n\n1. Read an integer x from input.\n2. Determine if x is 1. \n3. If x is 1, output 0; else, 1.\n\nSo the code structure would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, result\n    ! read x from input\n    read(*,*) x\n    ! compute result\n    if (x == 1) then\n        result = 0\n    else\n        result = 1\n    end if\n    ! write result\n    write(*,*) result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a one-liner for the result. Let me see. The original code uses a ternary operator, but in Fortran you can write it as a similar expression. \n\nThe original Java code's result is computed as:\n\nboolean bool = x ==1 ? true : false;  // which is redundant; could've just be x ==1, but whatever.\n\nThen result = !bool ? 1:0. \n\n!bool is equivalent to (bool == .false.). So the condition is !bool. If true, result is 1, else 0.\n\nWhich is equivalent to result = 1 - bool (since in Java, booleans can't be treated as integers, but in Fortran, logical can be converted to integers? Hmm, perhaps better to use the if construct. Alternatively, in Fortran, the expression can be written as result = merge(1, 0, x/=1). Because if x is not 1 (i.e. x /=1 is true), then result is 1, else 0. Wait, because the merge function's third argument is the condition. The syntax is merge(a,b,mask), so when mask is true, the result is a, else b.\n\nAlternatively, the result can be written as 1 - (x ==1). Because (x ==1) in Fortran would evaluate to .true. or .false., but when used in integer context, .true. is 1, .false. 0. So 1 - (x ==1) would give 0 when x is 1, 1 otherwise. Because if x is 1, the equation is 1 - 1 =0. If not, it's 1-0 =1. That's concise and works. \n\nSo maybe that's another way to write it.\n\nSo the code can be made even shorter. Let me test:\n\nHmmm. \n\nFirst, read x: that's done via read(*,*)x.\n\nThen result = 1 - (x ==1)\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you use a logical in an arithmetic expression, it's treated as 0 or 1? Let me confirm. \n\nYes, in Fortran, logicals can be converted to integers (e.g., 0 for .false. and -1 for .true. in older versions, but in later versions, maybe 1?), wait no, I think in Fortran 90 and later, when converting logical to integer, .true. is 1 and .false. 0? Or is it that .true. is -1? Wait I might be getting confused with logicals in C.\n\nWait better check: \n\nAccording to Fortran standards, when converting a logical to an integer, the result is 0 for .false., and -1 for .true. (in default). However, perhaps in certain contexts, this might differ. Hmm, that could complicate things. Because then 1 - (x ==1) would not work as expected. \n\nWait, if (x ==1 ) is .true., then its integer value is (-1). So 1 - (-1) would be 2, which is wrong.\n\nOh that's a problem. \n\nHmm so this approach wouldn't work. Therefore, perhaps using the if then else construct is better.\n\nAlternatively, to cast the logical to an integer as 1 or 0. So we can use 1*(x/=1) or merge(1,0,...). Because 1 * (x==1) would give 1 when x is 1, 0 otherwise, but that's the opposite. Wait, in that case, the result needs to be 1 - (x==1). So, let me see:\n\nresult = 1 - (x==1)\n\nBut if in Fortran, (x ==1) is stored as .true. (which is -1?), then 1 - (x==1) would be 1 - (-1) =2 when x is 1, which is not desired. So that approach is wrong. Therefore, must use a different method.\n\nThus, using an if statement is more straightforward here. \n\nAlternatively, using integer arithmetic:\n\nresult = merge(1,0, x /=1)\n\nBecause when x is not 1, the mask is true, merge returns 1. Else 0. \n\nAlternatively, the result can be written as integer = logical, but since logical to integer conversion gives -1 for true, perhaps:\n\nBut result = 1 - (x ==1)\n\nBut since (x==1) is a logical, in an arithmetic context it is treated as -1 and 0? Wait no. Actually, in Fortran, when you use a logical in an arithmetic expression, it is converted to integer 0 for false and -1 for true, so 1 - (x==1) would evaluate to 1 - (-1)=2 when x is 1, which is bad. Thus that won't work. So can't do that.\n\nTherefore, better to compute via an if statement.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: x, result\n  read(*,*)x\n  if (x ==1) then\n     result =0\n  else\n     result=1\n  end if\n  write(*,*)result\nend program main\n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nWait the original Java code uses a scanner, but in Fortran the read statement is sufficient. The original code also uses a PrintWriter to output, but in Fortran, the write statement is enough, and flush is unnecessary as the write is to standard output. \n\nNow, the original Java code is named atcoder_ABC178_A, but in Fortran, the executable name can be the program's identifier. Let me check. In Fortran, the program can be named as the class name. So we can have:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: x, result\n  read (*,*) x\n  result = 1  ! default to 1\n  if (x ==1) then\n     result =0\n  end if\n  print*, result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nAlternatively, using an if-then-else construct. The code can be written as above.\n\nAlternatively, using the merge function:\n\nresult = merge(1,0, x /=1)\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: x, result\n  read *,x\n  result = merge(1, 0, x /=1 )\n  print*, result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nThis is concise and works. Let me see:\n\nmerge(1,0,mask) when mask is true (i.e., when x !=1), returns 1; mask false (x=1) returns 0. Which is exactly what is needed. So this is a better approach, without an if statement, making it one line.\n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo the Fortran code can be written with the merge function. So I'll go that route. \n\nWait, is the merge intrinsic in Fortran? Yes, it's a Fortran intrinsic function available in Fortran 90 and later.\n\nThus, the code could be shorter. \n\nAlternatively, result can be written as:\n\nresult = (x /=1 )\n\nBut since x /=1 is a logical, converting to integer, but then as I mentioned earlier it would be 0 or -1, which is not desired. For example, (x /=1) would be .true. when x is 0, so (x /=1) is 1, but the integer would be -1. So 0 when x is 1 (mask is false: 0), else -1. So that's not desired, but the merge function is the way to go.\n\nThus, the code with merge is better. \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x\n    integer :: result\n    read (*,*) x\n    result = merge(1,0, x.ne.1) ! Using .ne. because sometimes old style uses it?\n    print*, result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nWait note that in Fortran, the .ne. is the operator for 'not equal' and == is also allowed in newer versions. So x \u22601 could be written as x /=1 or x .ne. 1. So x /=1 is Fortran 90 way, I think. \n\nAlternatively,\n\nresult = merge(1,0, x /= 1)\n\nSame effect.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: x, result\n  read(*,*) x\n  result = merge(1, 0, x /=1 )\n  print *, result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nTesting this:\n\nCase1: x=1. Then x /=1 is false. So merge returns 0. So output 0.\n\nCase2: x=0 \u2192 x !=1 \u2192 true \u2192 returns 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus the code works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the logical not.\n\nAnother approach: boolean is equivalent to (x ==1). The result is !bool (if bool is (x==1), then !bool is x !=1). Since the result is 1 when x !=1, so result is equal to the integer value of (x !=1). However the integer value of a logical is problematic as before.\n\nWait because (x !=1) is a boolean. So, \n\nresult = (x !=1) \n\nIn Fortran, this would implicitly convert the logical to an integer. The problem is that the integer representation of .true. is -1, so that\u2019s not desired. Thus the result would be -1 when x not 1 and 0 when x is. Which is not the desired output (we need 1 and 0, respectively). Therefore, this approach won't work, so the merge is better.\n\nSo the code using the .merge is better.\n\nHence, the correct Fortran code should use merge, or an if clause. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nThe original Java code first reads via scan.next() and parses as integer. \n\nIn Fortran, the read (*,*) will read the next input as integer. Since the problem likely takes a single integer input, that's sufficient.\n\nThe PrintWriter is not needed here because Fortran's print or write statement directly outputs to standard out. The flush isn't necessary in Fortran because the write is buffered, but in most cases, the print will flush automatically, especially when the program ends.\n\nSo, the final code can be written in a few lines as I mentioned.\n\nThus the Fortran translation would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x\n    integer :: result\n    read(*,*) x\n    result = merge(1, 0, x /= 1)\n    print *, result\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nAlternatively, I can use an IF statement instead.\n\nAnother possible way is to use a one-line calculation for result:\n\nresult = 1 - (x == 1)\n\nWait, but again if (x==1) as .true. becomes -1, so result would be 1 - (-1) =2. No good. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, if in Fortran, the .true. evaluates to 1 numerically?\n\nHmm, I need to confirm how logical to integer conversion works. Let me check.\n\nAccording to Fortran 90 standard, the Logical to Integer conversion:\n\nThe value becomes 0 for .FALSE. and 1 for .TRUE. Only for the kind corresponding to default logical?\n\nWait maybe there is a difference between the values. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon checking, the conversion of logical to integer in Fortran:\n\nIn Fortran 90 and later, the transformation from logical to integer is processor-dependent. However, the processor must give a positive value for .TRUE. The actual value can vary (most typically, maybe 1 and 0, or 1 and something else). But the standard says conversion to default integer yields 0 for false and -1 for true in some implementations, but this is not reliable. Therefore, relying on this can be dangerous. \n\nHence better to avoid that. So using the merge function (which is an intrinsic function and behavioral is defined) is better.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is to stick with the merge or an if statement.\n\nTherefore, the code with merge is better.\n\nAlternatively, to use an if:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC178_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: x, result\n\n  read (*,*) x\n\n  if (x ==1) then\n    result =0\n  else\n    result =1\n  end if\n\n  write(*,*) result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC178_A\n\nThis is clear and unambiguous. So either way is okay.\n\nSince the problem is straightforward, perhaps the code with the merge is a bit more concise, but both are acceptable. Since the original Java used a ternary, maybe the conditional expression is the closest, but in Fortran it's the merge function.\n\nThus the final code can be written either way. Since I want to present concise code, I\u2019ll go with the merge approach.\n\nLet me check once again for syntax. The merge function's syntax is MERGE(TEMPLATE, ALTERNATE, MASK). Wait, no, looking at the merge syntax: merge(tsource, fsource, mask). The mask is a logical. So when mask is true, it returns tsource, else fsource. So for mask being x /=1, the tsource is 1, fsource 0. So yes, merge(1,0, x /=1) is correct.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nI think that's it. So the final Fortran code is as above."
