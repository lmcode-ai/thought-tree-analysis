    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code to Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code is doing step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n from the user. Then it reads n+1 integers into an array, starting at index 1. Wait, why n+1? Oh, probably because in the loop, it's iterating from 1 to n. So maybe that's a typo? Wait no, the array is declared as size n+1, but the loop goes from 1 to n, so it's using indices 1 to n, and leaving the 0th element unused. That's a bit odd but okay.\n\nThen the code counts the number of even and odd numbers, and also keeps track of their indices. Wait, not all indices, just the last occurrence? Because each time it hits an even number, it increments even and sets even_ind to that index. Same for odd. So in the end, even_ind and odd_ind store the index of the last even or odd number.\n\nThen, it checks whether there are more odds than evens. If so, it prints the index of the even (since it must have just one even, so that's the one causing the difference). Else, it prints the odd's index. So essentially, it's trying to find the single element that is different in parity from the rest. Because if all but one are even, then the odd one is the problem, but the majority here would be even but since it's checking if odd>even, maybe it's better to think differently.\n\nWait, the condition is if odd is greater than even, print even_ind, else print odd_ind. Let's see: if there are more odds (so odd count > even count), then the even is the outlier, so even's index is printed. Else, the odd is the outlier, so its index is printed. So the code is finding the number which has the minority parity and returns its position (starting from 1, which matches Java's 1-based indexing here).\n\nNow translating to Fortran. Let's see.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are typically 1-based if declared with DIMENSION(n), but actually, by default they start at 1. Wait, no. Wait in Fortran, the default lower bound is 1, but you can specify others. So we can set up an array from 1 to n. But the original code in Java uses 1-based indexing for the array (since it starts at i=1 to n). So that's okay.\n\nThe first thing is to read input. In Fortran, the standard is to use READ(*,*) for input.\n\nThe steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n integers into an array. Since Java's array starts at 1, in Fortran we'll declare the array to be size n, starting at 1.\n\nThen, the code loops through the array, counts evens and odds, and keeps the last index for each. Wait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based as well.\n\nSo for the variables: the code has 'odd' and 'even' counts, and 'odd_ind' and 'even_ind' which store the last occurrence's index.\n\nThe code in Fortran would need variables:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: array\n\nThen after reading n, allocate array(n). But in the Java code, the array is n+1 in size, but filled from 1 to n. Probably, that's a mistake. Because in Java, the code reads n elements (loop from 1 to n) into an array of size n+1. So the first element (array[0]) is 0, but not used. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but perhaps they intended to read n elements. Let me check:\n\nThe code:\n\narray is size n+1, but in the loop for reading, the indices go from 1 to n. So array[0] is not set. But that's okay because it's not used. So in Fortran, since arrays can start at 1, we can just use array of size n. So to replicate the Java's behavior, better to make it starting at 1 and size n. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(n) :: array\n\nWait, allocation is probably better because n is read first. So in Fortran:\n\nread*, n\n\nallocate(array(n))\n\nThen read the elements into the array. The loop in Java starts at 1, so in Fortran, the array is 1-based so that's okay.\n\nNow, the variable declarations: even, odd, even_ind, odd_ind.\n\nInitially set to 0. Hmm. In Fortran, variables must be initialized? Or are they automatically 0? Well, in older standards they were not, but in newer standards, maybe. To be safe, better to initialize them to zero manually.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: n, odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind\n\nThen set those variables to 0 before the loop.\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to n.\n\nIf array(i) is even?\n\narray(i) mod 2 == 0?\n\nIf yes, increment even, and set even_ind = i.\n\nElse, increment odd, and set odd_ind =i.\n\nThen after the loop, check if odd > even. If so, print even_ind. Else, print odd_ind.\n\nIn Fortran, printing is write(*,*) var.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nLet me sketch the code step by step.\n\nFirst, declare the variables.\n\nprogram main\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, odd, even, odd_ind, even_ind, i\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: array\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(array(n))\n\n! Read the array elements:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   read(*,*) array(i)\nend do\n\nodd = 0\neven = 0\nodd_ind = 0\neven_ind = 0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if (mod(array(i),2) == 0) then\n      even = even + 1\n      even_ind = i\n   else\n      odd = odd +1\n      odd_ind =i\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (odd > even) then\n   write(*,*) even_ind\nelse\n   write(*,*) odd_ind\nend if\n\ndeallocation(array) -- Wait, no, in Fortran, deallocating is done with deallocate(array), but it's optional here, because the program ends, but better to do it.\n\nSo add:\n\ndeallocate(array)\n\nWait but the code may end without an error. Hmm, Fortran will automatically deallocate allocatable variables when they go out of scope. Since the array is in the main program, which exits, so it's okay. But in code standards, perhaps better to deallocate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not needed here, but let's include it.\n\nWait, in the structure:\n\nprogram main\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, etc...\n...\n\ndeallocate(array)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, after the reads, the loop is in place.\n\nWait, the variables odd and even start at 0. Then each time the loop increments. So that's okay.\n\nWait, the indices are being stored correctly. The even_ind and odd_ind variables store the last occurrence's index.\n\nWait, in the code, for each even number, it replaces even_ind with current i, same with the odd. So the final even_ind will be the index of the last even, and similarly for odd. So when odd count is larger than even, the even (and its index) is the minority, so that index is printed.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing for syntax.\n\nIn Fortran, the mod function is mod(a,b). So mod(array(i), 2) ==0.\n\nThe write statement: The indices are 1-based, which matches the problem's requirement.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, we need to put the program in a proper structure.\n\nAnother thing: implicit none is good practice to have. So the code is all right.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nHere's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_25_A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, odd = 0, even = 0, odd_ind = 0, even_ind = 0, i\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: array\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(array(n))\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     read(*,*) array(i)\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (mod(array(i), 2) == 0) then\n        even = even +1\n        even_ind = i\n     else\n        odd = odd +1\n        odd_ind = i\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  if (odd > even) then\n     write(*,*) even_ind\n  else\n     write(*,*) odd_ind\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(array)\nend program codeforces_25_A\n\nWait, but in variable declarations, can we initialize them when declaring?\n\nIn Fortran, you can initialize variables at declaration, but the syntax may depend on standard. For F90:\n\ninteger :: odd =0, etc.\n\nIs that acceptable?\n\nYes. So that's okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase when all numbers are even except one odd:\n\nSuppose n=3, numbers 2,4,5. Then the odd count is 1, even is 2. Since even>odd, so print odd_ind, which is 3.\n\nWhich is correct, as 5 is the odd one (minority).\n\nAnother case where all even except one: but even is 1, then odd is higher if n is even?\n\nWait n=4 (numbers 1,3,5,6). odds count is 3, evens 1. So print even_ind 4.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. So if the number is even, even count 1 (odd count 0). Since even is bigger (1 vs 0). So print odd_ind (0) but the problem? Wait in this code, when n=1 and the number is odd, then odd_ind is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait in the code, when all are even (count n, since if n is even or odd?), then even is n. So odd count is zero, so code would take the even-majority, so check if odd>even is no, so print odd_ind, which is 0. But that's a problem.\n\nWait wait in that case, if all are even, then odd count is zero. Thus code would go into the else (since even>odd), so then prints odd_ind which is 0. But the problem requires the case where there's exactly one element different. However, in this scenario, if all elements are even, then there is no odd element. So perhaps this is an impossible input? The problem's statement (as per Codeforces problem 25A maybe?) likely requires that exactly one element differs in parity.\n\nBecause the code for Java is working on the assumption that exactly one is different. So for input where all are even, there is no odd, then the code would print 0 or similar which would be an error.\n\nWait actually the original code may have an off-by-one? Let's see:\n\nWait in original Java code, the array starts at i=1 to n. But odd_ind and even-ind are initialized to 0, so for example if all elements are even, then even is n, odd is zero, so the code would print even_ind, which is the last value of even. Because the loop over all elements, and for each even element, even_ind is set to the current index. So, the last index is n. So the code will print even_ind, but only when even < odd? No. Let me see:\n\nWait in the code's condition: if (odd > even):\n\n if all elements are even: odd =0, even = n. So odd < even. So it goes else clause, prints the odd_ind. But odd_ind remains 0, since no elements were odd. So the code would print 0? Which is wrong.\n\nAh, that's a bug in the original code.\n\nWait hold on, this is a critical point. The original java code seems to have a problem.\n\nWait let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nThe variables are initialized as:\n\nint odd =0, even=0, odd_ind =0, even_ind=0;\n\nThen for each element:\n\nif even, even increment and even_ind =i.\n\nElse odd increment and odd_ind =i.\n\nSo, if all elements are even, then the odd remains zero. Then the condition 'if (odd> even)' is false, so it prints odd_ind, which is 0, but the indices in the Java code are stored as 1-based, so 0 is an invalid position. Which would mean that the code is wrong for all cases where one parity doesn't exist except when there is only one element (but for n=1, if the one element is even, then even is 1, odd is 0, so it would print 0, but the correct index should be 1, right? Wait no. Wait in the problem statement's context, the problem says that exactly one number is different. So the code assumes that there is exactly one differing element.\n\nSo in input where all numbers are even except one or all except one, the code would work.\n\nBut when all are even, the problem's input is invalid, but the code may crash? Because the code would output 0, but problem requires 1-based index.\n\nWait that's an issue. However, according to the problem's requirement (which is codeforces 25A), the problem states:\n\nProblem: \"You are given a sequence of N integers arranged in a circle. All integers except one are even, and the one remaining integer is odd. Find the index of the odd integer.\"\n\nWait wait that's not exactly the problem's description. Wait let me check the problem.\n\nProblem 25A: \u00abParty\u00bb, as per Codeforces.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nn people came to a party. As is often the case, each person has a drink in his/her hand. The drinks are as still as the party is boring \u2014 all of them are Vodka... well, almost all. Maybe one of them is not Vodka.\n\nThe i-th guest's drink has ai milliliters of the drink in it. All the Vodka bottles have the same volume, while the other bottle (if it's present) is different. You need to determine whether there is a non-Vodka drink at the party. If there isn't, output \"Still in the lead\". If there is, output the number of the guest (either 1 or 2 or ... or n) whose drink is different in volume. It's guaranteed that the test cases will guarantee that a unique solution exists.\n\nWait, the actual problem is not about parity but finding the unique element in a list where all others are same except one, but with integer values. But perhaps in the translation here the code was for another problem, perhaps an older version?\n\nAlternatively, the user's provided Java code is solving a problem where exactly one element has a different parity. So the code expects that exactly one of even or odd occurs once, the others all same. Hence in normal cases, the code's output would be correct, but for inputs that don't satisfy that condition, the code's output is invalid.\n\nAssuming that the code is correct for the problem's constraints (where exactly one element differs in parity), then the code works. So in translation, we can proceed accordingly. However, the problem in code is that if all elements are even, the code would have odd=0 and even=n, so the else condition (since odd < even) prints odd_ind which is 0. Which is invalid because indices start at 1.\n\nWait the original code's Java snippet's input:\n\nn is followed by n numbers. So for inputs where all are even, but the problem's constraints ensure that this cannot happen (since there must be exactly one different), then the code is okay.\n\nHence the code may be safe given the problem constraints.\n\nIn that case, the Fortran code will have the same potential issue, but as per problem's constraints, we can proceed.\n\nSo in Fortran code, variables odd_ind and even_ind can store 0 if no element found, but according to the problem's input constraints, it won't happen.\n\nThus, the translated code is okay.\n\nNow checking in the Fortran code:\n\nLooking back, variables are initialized to zero. The loops are correct.\n\nNow the output is written with write(*, *) so that's okay.\n\nHence the code is correct."
