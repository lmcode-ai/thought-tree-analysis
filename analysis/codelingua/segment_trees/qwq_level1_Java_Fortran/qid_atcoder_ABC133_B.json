But in the Fortran code: do j = i+1, N \u2192 since in Fortran the range is inclusive. Wait, that is a problem? Wait in Java, j runs from i+1 (inclusive) to N-1 (inclusive) (since j < N \u2192 j can be N-1). So in Fortran, the loop variables:\n\nin Java:\n\ni runs from 0 to N-2 (because i < N-1), because the outer loop is for (i=0; i < N-1; i++). So in Java, N-1 is the upper limit for the outer loop, so the outer loop runs from 0 to N-2, so the total loops i from 0..N-2, and j from i+1 to N-1 (for inner loop).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does step by step.\n\nThe Java program reads N and D, then reads N vectors each with D dimensions. Then it calculates the Euclidean distance between every pair of vectors. If the distance is an integer (when the square root of the squared distance is an integer, or almost an integer considering a small error), it increments the answer count. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nFirst, the main steps in Fortran:\n\nRead N and D, then read N rows of D integers each. Then loop over all pairs of vectors, compute the squared distance (sum of squared differences in each dimension), take the square root, check if it's integer-like (with some tolerance), and count. Finally output the count.\n\nNow, let's think about the Fortran code structure.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to use subroutines or functions. But since it's a small program, maybe a program block is okay. The main variables are N, D, the vectors (array), and the answer counter.\n\nThe input: Scanner in Java is here for reading inputs. In Fortran, perhaps read from stdin with read(*,*) statements. The vectors can be stored as a 2D array. Wait, in Java, the vectors are stored as a 2D array of integers. In Fortran, integers are straightforward, but arrays are declared with dimensions.\n\nDeclaring the vectors: in Java it's N rows and D columns. In Fortran, the array can be declared as integer, dimension(N,D). But since we need to read N and D first, which are variables, we'll need to use an allocatable array. Wait right, because Fortran can't have array dimensions as variables unless we use allocatables.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and D first.\n\n2. Allocate a 2D array of size (N, D).\n\n3. Read each row into the array.\n\nThen process the pairs.\n\nProcessing each pair (i,j) where i < j. The loops would be similar: for i from 1 to N-1, for j from i+1 to N. Wait, in Fortran, indices start from 1? Wait, in Java the loops start at 0, but in Fortran, the indices can also start from 1 if declared as such, but default is 1. Wait, did the Java code start at 0? Let's check:\n\nYes, in Java the for loops start at 0. So in the 2D arrays, vectors[i][j] in Java has i from 0 to N-1, j from 0 to D-1. But in Fortran arrays, by default, the indices start at 1 unless specified otherwise. Wait, no, in Fortran you can set the lower bounds with the DIMENSION statement. For example, declaring an array as integer :: vectors(0: N-1, 0: D-1) so that the indices match Java.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps easier to adjust the indices in Fortran code to use 1-based. Let me think.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes the vectors with variables starting from zero, but in Fortran, the user can choose the starting indices. Maybe to make it easier, in Fortran, use 1-based indices for N and D. So for the N vectors (each with D elements), the arrays would be 1-based.\n\nWait, the Java code's variables:\n\nvectors is a 2D array with indices [i][j], where i runs from 0 to N-1 (number of vectors), and j from 0 to D-1 (number of dimensions). In Fortran, perhaps the easiest is to shift the indices by 1, but perhaps better to set the arrays to have 1-based so i runs 1..N and d 1..D. The translation for loops:\n\nOriginal Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) loops i from 0 to N-1, so in Fortran, i would go from 1 to N.\n\nSimilarly for the j loop (dimension D).\n\nThus, the 2D array in Fortran will have dimensions (N, D), with each element (i, j) corresponding to the Java's (i-1, j-1).\n\nWait, no, it's better to actually set the Fortran array to be (N, D), starting at 1,1. So that for the first vector, which is index 0 in Java, becomes 1 in Fortran.\n\nNow, the next part is reading the vectors. The Java code reads N lines, each with D numbers. So in Fortran, after reading N and D, we need to read N lines, each line contains D integers. So the read loop would be:\n\nDO I = 1, N\n\n   READ *, (vectors(I,J), J=1,D)\n\nEND DO\n\nWait, assuming that the variables are read sequentially, with each line containing D integers. So that's correct.\n\nThen the calculation loops:\n\nThe Java loops:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++ )\n\n   for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++ )\n\nIn Fortran terms, i would go from 1 to N-1, and j from i+1 to N. So:\n\nDO I = 1, N-1\n\n   DO J= I+1, N\n\n       ... compute distance between vectors I and J\n\n   ENDDO\n\nENDDO\n\nNow the inner loop for computing the distance:\n\nIn Java they compute the squared distance: for each dimension d from 0 to D-1, add (x)^2 where x is the difference of the vectors in dimension d.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndistance =0\n\nDO K=1, D\n\n   Diff = vectors(I,K) - vectors(J,K)\n\n   distance = distance + Diff * Diff\n\nENDDO\n\nWait, yes. Then compute the square root of distance. The Java code uses Math.sqrt( (double)(dist) ) ?\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nthe variable 'dist' in Java is an int (since each x*x is int and summed into dist (int). Then, when taking sqrt:\n\ndouble sq = Math.sqrt( dist );\n\nThe condition is checking whether the square root is an integer, almost. Since it's comparing the fractional part (sq - floor sq) to be less than 0.001. So if the square root is exactly integer, for example, then it's 0, else 0.000... or up to 0.000999...\n\nWait the condition is Math.abs( squared sqrt minus floor of it ) < 0.001. So if the sqrt is an integer plus something less than 0.001? But actually, perhaps they're checking if it's an integer within an error of 0.001. Wait, no: the problem says to count pairs where the distance is an integer.\n\nWait the original problem, according to this code: the code counts when the sqrt is integer-like, within 0.001. So if the sqrt is, say, 5.0 exactly, or 5.0001, or maybe 4.999, but within 0.001 of an integer? So the condition is that the fractional part is less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999?\n\nWait, the code Math.abs( (sqrt - floor(sqrt)) ) <0.001 would mean that the fractional part is less than 0.001, so sqrt is almost an integer. Because the difference between the sqrt and its floor would be like 0.999, so if it's 2.999, then the difference would be 0.999, which is not less than 0.001, so not count. Wait, no, actually, floor gives the largest integer less than or equal to the value. So for a value like 2.999, the floor is 2, so the difference is 0.999, which is bigger. If the value was 2.0 then difference is 0, so is counted. For 2.0005, the difference is 0.0005 <0.001 \u2192 counted. For 2.001, that's 0.001 which is not less than, so not counted.\n\nWait the condition is:\n\nif (Math.abs( sq - Math.floor( sq ) ) < 0.001 ) then count it \u2192 so the fractional part must be within 0.001 of 0. That would capture sqrt values like 2.0003, but not 2.001. So it's checking if the square root is approximately an integer, with a tolerance.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to compute the square root of the integer variable 'distance', then check the fractional part.\n\nNow, variables in Fortran:\n\nThe distance can be stored as an integer (since in Java it was an int). The square root is a real number. So compute sqrt_dist = sqrt( distance ), then the fractional part would be sqrt_dist - real( int(sqrt_dist) ). If that fractional part is less than 0.001, or maybe equal? The condition uses absolute value of ( sq - floor( sq ) ), so it's okay.\n\nWait code:\n\n    if (Math.abs( ( (sq - Math.floor( sq )) ) ) < 0.001 ) \u2192 1 else 0\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nLet me see:\n\nsqrt_val = sqrt( dist )\n\nfractional_part = sqrt_val - aint( sqrt_val )\n\nWait, aint is the function for integer truncation. Alternatively, we can use (sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val)). But in Fortran:\n\nABS( fractional_part ) < 0.001 ?\n\nWait, fractional_part can be positive up to (if sqrt_val is not integer, it would be sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val) between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). So absolute value is the same as fractional_part.\n\nWait, yes:\n\nfloor(sqrt_val) gives the nearest integer below sqrt_val. So sqrt_val - floor(...) is between 0 (when it's integer) and 1.\n\nThus the condition is whether that value is less than 0.001. If yes, then count +=1.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nif ( abs( sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val) ) < 0.001 ) then answer = answer +1\n\nWait but in Fortran, the functions: floor is real function returning the largest integer less than or equal to the argument. So the expression sqrt_val - floor( sqrt_val ) gives the fractional part, exactly. So in Fortran code, say:\n\nreal(kind=8) :: sqrt_val\n\nsqrt_val = sqrt( d )\n\nif ( abs( sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val) ) < 1.0d-3 ) then answer = answer +1\n\nWait, precise types.\n\nWe need sqrt_val to be double precision, because Java handled with Math.sqrt (double). So to have the same precision in Fortran, using double precision variables (kind=8 perhaps, depending on compiler). Since in Java the logic is that the sqrt is computed as a double.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, declare variables. Let me plan variable declarations.\n\nFirst, the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC133_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, D\n\ninteger, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\n\ninteger :: i, j, d, dist\n\nreal(kind=8) :: sqrt_val\n\ninteger :: answer = 0\n\nRead N and D:\n\nread*, N, D\n\nallocate( vectors( N, D ) )\n\nthen read N rows into vectors:\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   read*, (vectors(i,j), j =1, D)\n\nend do\n\nThen the loops:\n\nfor i from 1 to N-1:\n\ndo i =1, N-1\n\n   do j= i+1, N\n\n       dist =0\n\n       do d=1,D\n\n           dist = dist + ( vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d) )**2\n\n       end do\n\n       sqrt_val = sqrt( dble( dist ) )   !! need to cast to real to compute sqrt. (dble in Fortran turns to double precision)\n\n       if ( abs( sqrt_val - floor( sqrt_val ) ) < 1.0d-3 ) then\n\n           answer = answer +1\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, but wait: the variable 'd' for loop is used here. Wait in the nested loops, the variables:\n\nvariables:\n\ni (indices for vectors from 1 to N-1)\n\nj (another index)\n\nthe loop over d =1 to D ?\n\nYes, the innermost loop is over the dimensions from 1 to D.\n\nBut in the calculation for 'dist', yes.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop for d is from 0 to D-1, so that's covered here since in Fortran it runs 1 to D.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nThe 'dist' variable here is an integer. Because (vectors(i,d) - vectors(j,d)) is an integer, squared gives an integer, sum all gives an integer. Then, converting to real when taking the square root.\n\nNow, checking:\n\nsqrt_val is the real value of sqrt(dist).\n\nThe condition uses the fractional part. Then, proceeding as above.\n\nWait, note that in Fortran, the operator for exponentiation is **, so (x)^2 is (x)**2. The parentheses are there to make sure order of operations is correct.\n\nAnother possible problem is the allocation. The vectors array must be allocatable. So we have to declare it as allocatable.\n\nWait, in the code above, have integer, allocatable :: vectors(N,D). Wait, but since we don't know N and D before reading, but they are variables.\n\nYes, so:\n\nWhen variables N and D are read, the allocatable array is allocated with allocate( vectors(N, D) )\n\nThat should work.\n\nNow, once all loops finish, output the answer.\n\nprint*, answer\n\nWait, but in Fortran, we need proper formatted output. The Java code just prints the answer as an integer, so in Fortran, print*, answer is sufficient.\n\nThus putting all together:\n\nNow, testing some edge cases. Let me see.\n\nSuppose N and D are 0? Probably not since in Java, but the code may not handle such cases. But according to AtCoder problem, probably N and D are within some constraints.\n\nNow possible edge case when D=1, etc. The code should handle it.\n\nNow, note that in the loops:\n\nWhen D is 0? Probably the problem specifies D>=1? Probably.\n\nNow, checking the code:\n\nWait, in the loops when the code computes the distance between all pairs (i,j):\n\nYes, in Fortran the loop for j starts from i+1 to N, which is correct to count each pair once (i < j), so that's correct.\n\nNow, what about the sqrt computation?\n\nIn Fortran, when dist is zero? (vectors are identical). Then sqrt(0) is zero, so fractional part is zero \u2192 counted.\n\nThus, the code would consider zero distance as valid (since the distance is an integer). The problem says \"the distance is an integer\", so zero is okay.\n\nWhat about between two points whose squared distance is 2, so sqrt(2) is about 1.414..., which would have fractional part ~0.414 \u2192 condition not met. So is correct.\n\nAnother corner case: squared distance = 4 \u2192 sqrt is exactly 2 \u2192 counted. So correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In the inner loops, the indices for vectors must be correctly set. For example, the vectors are stored in 1-based indexes (as per the read loops).\n\n- The code uses the allocatable array, which in Fortran needs to be properly declared and allocated.\n\n- The conversion to real for sqrt: since 'dist' is integer, then sqrt(dble(dist)) because sqrt can't take an integer in Fortran unless converted to real. Because sqrt in Fortran for integer would require a function?\n\nWait, in Fortran, sqrt is a function that can accept real numbers. To compute sqrt of dist, which is an integer, need to convert it to a real. So dble converts to double-precision real (the kind=8), so that sqrt_val is of double precision. Correct.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nOther points:\n\n- In the calculation of the fractional part:\n\nsqrt_val could be, for example, 5.0000000000, then the fractional part is 0 \u2192 counted. If it's 3.0, same.\n\nIf the sqrt_val is 2.9999, then floor is 2, fractional part 0.9999 \u2192 0.9999 is larger than 0.001 \u2192 not counted.\n\nWait the condition is whether it's less than 0.001. So even if the fractional part is 0.9999, that would not be counted. So only when the sqrt is very close to an integer (within rounding) would pass. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the code uses (x*x) as integers, adds them all, but when the sum overflows? Wait, in Java, int can be up to 2^31-1. For example, if D is 1000 and each coordinate difference is 10^4, then (10^4)^2 = 1e8, multiplied by 1000 dimensions gives 1e11, which is less than 2^31 (2e9?), wait 1e11 is more than 2^31 (which is ~2e9), so even in Java, this would cause integer overflow. But the problem's constraints probably prevent that.\n\nWe have to assume the problem constraints are such that dist won't exceed what a 32-bit int can hold. Similarly in Fortran's integer which by default may be 4 bytes (but Fortran can use kinds), but the problem's input data is valid so no overflow.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, finally, putting all this together.\n\nThe Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC133_B\n\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, D\n  integer, allocatable :: vectors(:,:)\n  integer :: i, j, k, dist\n  real(kind=8) :: sqrt_val\n  integer :: answer = 0\n\n  read(*,*) N, D\n  allocate( vectors(N,D) )\n\n  do i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) (vectors(i,k), k = 1, D)\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, N - 1\n    do j = i + 1, N\n      dist = 0\n      do k = 1, D\n        dist = dist + ( vectors(i,k) - vectors(j,k) )**2\n      end do\n      sqrt_val = sqrt( dble( dist ) )\n      if ( abs( sqrt_val - floor( sqrt_val ) ) < 0.001d0 ) then\n        answer = answer + 1\n      end if\n    end do\n  end do\n\n  print*, answer\n\nend program atcoder_ABC133_B\n\nWait, variables:\n\nThe loop variable over the D dimensions uses a variable not named d but k, since in Fortran's variable names can be same? Wait in the loops:\n\nWait original loops:\n\nJava's d is the loop variable over the dimensions. In Fortran loops:\n\nIn the loops:\n\ni is from 1 to N-1,\n\nj from i+1 to N,\n\nthen k from 1 to D ( I changed the name to k to avoid confusion).\n\nAlternatively, we can name it d (the variable name is variable, but in the overall code's structure).\n\nHere's the code with d as the loop variable:\n\nWait, since in the outer loops, the variables a named i and j, then the innermost loop (dimension) can be d.\n\nIn the Fortran code above, k can be d:\n\nWait:\n\ndo d = 1, D\n\nBut then the variable d might conflict with any other variables? Let me check.\n\nWait in the code, the variable for the loop (dimension) is written as d, but the name was used in the Java code. However, in Fortran, local variables declared in the program are in a single namespace (assuming everything is in the main program). So, we can name it d as long as redeclaring is okay.\n\nWait in the code, variables are declared at top:\n\ninteger :: N, D (the capital D variable here is a variable, so case is not significant?)\n\nWait in Fortran, variable names are case-insensitive typically, so in some compilers, but in recent versions, you can use case-sensitive variable names if specified, but perhaps better to use lowercase to avoid confusion. Let me see.\n\nThe problem is:\n\nThe variable D is declared as an integer, and the loop variable in the innermost loop (dimension loop) is named d. So in Fortran, d is different from D (case matters?), but in default Fortran 77 style, it's case insensitive. So in that case, using lowercase d as loop variable might conflict with capital D variable, which is problematic. That would cause an error.\n\nAh, right! Oh, that's a bug.\n\nBecause the variable D is used as a loop upper bound, but if the loop variable is named d (lowercase), but in Fortran's case-insensitive mode, using d as the variable would conflict with D.\n\nSo, the loop variable must not be named the same as any variable, considering case-insensitive.\n\nTherefore in the inner loop's loop variable:\n\nInstead of d, let's name it k as in the initial code.\n\nAlternatively, use another variable like j is taken.\n\nYes in previous code, using k is better.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nvariables are:\n\ninteger :: N, D (read variables)\n\nin the loops:\n\nin the outer loops: i and j.\n\ndimension loop: k from 1 to D.\n\nThus in the code above, it's correct.\n\nWait but in my code example earlier, I have written:\n\ndo k = 1, D \u2192 so the loop variable is k, which is okay.\n\nOther variables are fine.\n\nWait the 'dist' is an integer variable, initialized to zero each loop.\n\nNow the loop for i and j:\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: in the calculation of sqrt_val: dble( dist ), since in Fortran if you call sqrt on an integer, you have type issues, so converting to double is necessary.\n\nNow, in the code:\n\nthe loop variables in the second dimension are using k.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nAnother check: the loops' indices:\n\nJava's j loop runs for j from i+1 to N-1?\n\nWait in the Java code's j loop:\n\nfor (int j = i+1; j < N; j++) \u2192 so it's exclusive of N, so j runs up to N-1.\n\nBut in the Fortran code: do j = i+1, N \u2192 since in Fortran the range is inclusive. Wait, that is a problem?\n\nWait in Java, j runs from i+1 (inclusive) to N-1 (inclusive) (since j < N \u2192 j can be N-1). So in Fortran, the loop variables:\n\nin Java:\n\ni runs from 0 to N-2 (because i < N-1), because the outer loop is for (i=0; i < N-1; i++). So in Java, N-1 is the upper limit for the outer loop, so the outer loop runs from 0 to N-2, so the total loops i from 0..N-2, and j from i+1 to N-1 (for inner loop). Thus, the total pairs are C(N,2).\n\nIn the Fortran code, outer loop is i from 1 to N-1 (since N is the original N from input), so i runs up to N-1. The inner loop j starts from i+1 up to N. The maximum j would be N when I = N-1 \u2192 j goes from N and the upper limit N \u2192 j=N. So j runs from i+1 to N. But since the original j has to go up to N-1?\n\nWait Java's N is the same as the Fortran's variable N. Let me see:\n\nJava: N is the number of vectors. The loop for i in i from 0 to N-2 (so I_max = N-2), then j runs from i+1 up to (N -1) since j < N. Thus total pairs is (N*(N-1)/2.\n\nIn the Fortran code: the loops:\n\nouter loop i from 1 to (N-1):\n\nso i can be up to N-1. Then for each such i, j runs from (i+1) up to N. If i is N-1, then i+1 = N, so j loops starts at N, up to N \u2192 the loop for j will run just on j=N?\n\nBut then j can be N?\n\nWait that would count j up to N?\n\nWait the Java code's N in its input is the same as the Fortran's N, so in the Java's j loop, the maximum 'j' index is N-1 (Java is 0-based), which in the Fortran code is the maximum N (since the first element is at 1, so the last element is at N. Thus j can go up to N \u2192 which would be correct.\n\nWait let's see example:\n\nSuppose N=3 in Java. So in Fortran, the code's N=3.\n\nThe Java code\u2019s outer i runs from 0 to 1 (because N-1 is 2, so 0 to 1 <2 \u2192 i =0,1).\n\nThen j runs from 1 and 2 (since i+1 =1, when i is 0 \u2192 j up to 2 (since j <3 \u2192 2) etc.\n\nIn the Fortran case, i runs from 1 to 2.\n\nFor i=1, j goes from 2 to 3 \u2192 j=2 and 3?\n\nWait, in the case of N=3, the vectors are 1..3 (since java had indices 0,1,2). So in Fortran's code j=3 would correspond to the third vector.\n\nWhich is correct because in the Java code, the upper limit for j is N-1 (so 2\u2192 the index 2).\n\nThus in Fortran code, the loops go up to N for j, so when i is N-1 (in the example N=3, i=2), j ranges from 3 to 3 \u2192 which is correct because the third vector is index 3 in Fortran (original Java's index 2). So the total pairs are still C(N,2).\n\nBecause when N=3:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ni=1, j=2,3 \u2192 two pairs (1,2), (1,3)\n\ni=2, j=3 \u2192 one pair (2,3)\n\nTotal of 3 pairs, same as C(3,2).\n\nThus the loops are correct.\n\nSo the code for loops is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, looking at the code again:\n\nreal(kind=8) :: sqrt_val \u2192 correct for double precision.\n\nThe condition:\n\nif ( abs( sqrt_val - floor(sqrt_val) ) <0.001_8 ) \u2192 wait the 0.001 must be a double precision number. So in Fortran, 1.0d-3 or 0.001d0.\n\nIn the code, written as 0.001d0 is more explicit, but the code above uses 0.001d0? Wait in the code I wrote earlier, it's < 0.001d0.\n\nThus correct.\n\nThus the code should translate properly.\n\nTesting.\n\nNow, can I think of an example?\n\nSuppose N=2, D=1.\n\nVectors: (0 and 1):\n\nThen vectors are [0] and [1].\n\ndistance squared is (0-1)^2 \u2192 1. sqrt is 1.0 \u2192 counted \u2192 answer =1.\n\nAnother case:\n\nVectors (0 and sqrt(2): but inputs are integers. Suppose D is 2, vectors:\n\nvector1 (0,0), vector2 (1,1): their squared distance is (1)^2 + (1)^2 =2 \u2192 sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414\u2026 \u2192 fractional part 0.414 \u2192 not counted. Thus answer 0.\n\nAnother case: vectors (0,3), (0,4): squared distance is 1 \u2192 sqrt 1 \u2192 counted.\n\nThus, the code should correctly compute these.\n\nThus, the Fortran code as written should work."
