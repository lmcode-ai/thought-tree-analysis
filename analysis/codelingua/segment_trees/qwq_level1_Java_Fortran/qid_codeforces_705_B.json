    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does first. \n\nThe main class is called codeforces_705_B, and there's a static FastReader class for input. The main method runs solve() t times, but wait, looking closer, the main method initializes t to 1, then enters a loop while t-- >0. Hmm, but the solve() method itself starts by reading t = scan.nextInt(), which suggests that in the original problem, maybe it's supposed to handle multiple test cases. But the main's t is 1, so the loop runs once. So the program actually reads the number of test cases first. Let me see the solve function:\n\nInside solve(), after t = scan.nextInt(), we create an array arr of size t, then read the numbers into it. Then there's a loop through the elements. For each number in arr, if it's 1, and prevWinner is 0, then set prevWinner to 2. Then the big condition: if prevWinner is 2 or 0, check if (arr[i]-1) mod 2 is 0. If yes, output 2, else output 1. Else (if prevWinner was 1?), then opposite. \n\nWait, the logic here is a bit confusing, but maybe it's part of a game where each number determines the winner of each turn, with some dependency on previous result. Anyway, the task is to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the FastReader class. Since Java has dynamic user input handling with next() and nextInt(), Fortran can't have a class like that, but can use standard input. But Fortran doesn't have a StringTokenizer. We'll need to read line by line and split. Alternatively, we can read an integer each time.\n\nWait, the FastReader class in Java is for fast input, but in Fortran, it can just use read(*,*) to read numbers directly. \n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\nIn Java solve function:\n- Read t (number of test cases for this problem). \n- Read an array of size t with the elements.\n- Iterate over each element in the array.\n- For each number arr[i], do some logic involving previous winner (prevWinner), etc.\n\nSo first, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Since the numbers are integers (given in nextInt()), probably integers. \n\nThe main structure in Fortran would be: \n\nprogram codeforces_705_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, prevWinner, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n    ! read the number of test cases first?\n    ! Wait, the Java code in main sets t to 1, so the solve is called once, but in the solve function, the first step is to read t (the input's first number), which is the loop's count for the number of test cases? Wait no, that's confusing. Let me recheck the code:\n\nLooking at the Java code again: \n\nThe main function does:\n    int t =1; \n    while (t-- >0) { solve(); }\n\nBut in solve(), inside solve there's:\npublic static void solve() {\n    int t = scan.nextInt(); // this is a different t? The input's first number is being read here. \n\nSo the original code is probably intended to have a single test case where t is given, then the array, but the main loop in the Java code's main was perhaps redundant? Wait, in the main function, they set t to 1 and loop, but they should have read the number of test cases there. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait the problem might not have multiple test cases, but in the current code, the solve function reads t as input, so the first input is t, then t numbers. \n\nSo the flow is: the main function calls solve once, and inside solve, the first input is the number of elements for that problem's instance. So for the problem, each test case (the outer loop in main) is not necessary here, but the problem may actually just be a single case, or perhaps the main is set up for multiple cases but not used. \n\nBut for the translation to Fortran, I can assume that the problem requires reading a single test case with multiple elements. So, the program flow in Fortran would:\n\n1. Read the integer t. \n\n2. Read t integers into an array. \n\n3. Iterate over each element in the array, applying the logic. \n\nNow, the logic step:\n\nVariables: prevWinner starts at 0. \n\nFor each element in the array:\n\nif arr[i] == 1 and prevWinner is 0 \u2192 set prevWinner to 2.\n\nThen, regardless, there's a condition on prevWinner's current value:\n\nif prevWinner is 2 or 0 \u2192 choose based on (arr[i]-1) mod2.\n\nElse (prev was 1), do the opposite?\n\nWait let me read the original code again.\n\nThe code for each i in arr: \n\nif (arr[i] == 1) {\n    if (prevWinner == 0) {\n        prevWinner = 2;\n    }\n}\n\nThen the next part has:\n\nif (prevWinner == 2 || prevWinner ==0 ) {\n    if ((arr[i] - 1) % 2 == 0) \u2192 print 2, prevWinner 2 \n    else \u2192 print 1, prevWinner 1\n} else { \n    if same condition, but swap the print?\n}\n\nWait the code's structure:\n\nif (prevWinner is 2 or 0) \u2192 then (do x or y based on mod)\nelse \u2192 (prev is 1 \u2192 do the opposite. )\n\nWait let me see:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nAfter handling the arr[i] ==1 case:\n\nNow, if prevWinner is 2 or 0 then:\n\n   check (arr[i]-1) mod 2.\n\n   if yes, then output 2 and set prev to 2\n\n   else \u2192 output 1 and set prev to1.\n\nElse (prev was 1):\n\n   if (arr[i]-1 mod 2 is zero \u2192 output1 (since prev is 1? Let me see code:\n\nElse part:\n\nif (prevWinner == 1):\n\n    if (arr[i]-1 mod2 ==0 \u2192 output 1 \u2192 prev=1?\n\nWait, the code's \"else\" block is when (prev is not 2 nor 0 \u2192 hence must be 1).\n\nIn that case:\n\n    if (arr[i]-1)%2 ==0 \u2192 print 1 \u2192 prev becomes 1?\n\nWait in code:\n\nInside the else clause:\n\n   if ( (arr[i] -1) mod2 ==0 \u2192 print1 (prev=1)\n\n   else: print2 (prev=2)\n\nWait, putting it all together:\n\nThe code can be rephrased as:\n\nFor each number x in the array:\n\n1. If x is 1 and previous was 0 \u2192 set previous to 2.\n\n2. Then, check based on previous value (could be 2/0 or 1).\n\n- If previous is 2 or 0:\n\n   if (x-1) mod2 is even (i.e. 0) \u2192 player 2 wins, set prev to 2\n\n    else (mod1) \u2192 player 1 wins, set prev1\n\n- else (previous was 1):\n\n   if ( mod even (0) \u2192 player1 \u2192 set to 1?\n\n   if mod even: player1, else player2? \n\nWait let's look at the code:\n\nInside the else (which is the case where prev was 1):\n\nthe first check is (arr[i]-1) mod 2 is 0.\n\nThen: if so \u2192 output 1 and set prev to 1?\n\nIf not \u2192 output2 and set prev to2.\n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is a bit involved. \n\nNow, translating the logic into Fortran. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nFirst, we need to read t first. Then an array of Integers. \n\nThe main variables:\n\ninteger :: prevWinner =0\n\ninteger :: t\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nRead t.\n\nallocate(arr(t))\n\nread(*,*) arr\n\nThen loop over each element:\n\ndo i =1, t\n\n   if(arr(i) ==1 .and. prevWinner ==0 ) then \n\n      prevWinner = 2\n\n   endif \n\n   if(prevWinner ==2 .or. prevWinner ==0) then \n\n      if( mod( (arr(i) -1),2 ) ==0 ) then \n\n          print*,2 \n\n          prevWinner =2\n\n      else \n\n          print*,1 \n\n          prevWinner=1\n\n      endif\n\n   else \n\n      if( mod( (arr(i)-1),2 ) ==0 ) then \n\n          print*,1 \n\n          prevWinner=1 \n\n      else \n\n          print*,2 \n\n          prevWinner=2 \n\n      endif \n\n   end if \n\nend do\n\nWait that's the core logic. \n\nWait, but need to be careful with the index, in Java uses arr from 0 to t-1, which in Fortran would be 1 to t. So that's fine.\n\nWait in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. \n\nNow, putting it all into code.\n\nBut the first step: The FastReader is a helper class, but in Fortran, we can directly read the array using a single read statement for the array once we've allocated it.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the input is read line by line. The FastReader might read the next token each time, so in case the inputs are on separate lines or multiple per line. \n\nWait how is the input structured for this problem? Well, the problem (since codeforces_705_B suggests problem B from contest 705). \n\nLooking at problem 705B (maybe) on Codeforces.\n\nAssuming the problem expects first the integer t (number of elements), then the next line has t space-separated integers. \n\nSo in Fortran, the code can:\n\nRead first t.\n\nThen read the array. \n\nSince Fortran can read the array in one line via:\n\nread(*,*) arr \n\nBut the user inputs t elements in one line. \n\nBut if the input is the first line the t and the second line the elements, no problem. Let me think about the code:\n\nThe Java code reads the input as follows: \n\nIn solve() method:\n\nThe first nextInt() is t (number of elements, which is read as an integer here).\n\nThen, loops to read each of the next t numbers, storing in the array. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the code should be:\n\nprogram codeforces_705_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, i, prevWinner\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n    \n    read(*,*) t\n    allocate( arr(t) ) \n    read(*,*) (arr(i), i=1, t)\n    \n    prevWinner = 0 \n    ! process each element\n    do i = 1, t\n        if( arr(i) == 1 .and. prevWinner ==0 ) then \n            prevWinner =2\n        end if \n\n        ! now determine the output\n        if( prevWinner ==2 .or. prevWinner ==0 ) then\n            if( mod( arr(i) -1, 2 ) ==0 ) then \n                print *,2 \n                prevWinner =2 \n            else \n                print *,1 \n                prevWinner =1 \n            end if \n        else \n            if( mod( arr(i)-1, 2 ) ==0 ) then \n                print *,1 \n                prevWinner=1 \n            else \n                print *,2 \n                prevWinner=2\n            end if \n        end if \n    end do \n\n    deallocate(arr)\nend program codeforces_705_B \n\nWait, but do we need to deallocate? Well, in Fortran, it's better to deallocate for arrays. But in code submission on Codeforces, it's probably not necessary, but better to include for correctness.\n\nWait looking at the logic, the variables have the same role as in Java.\n\nTesting a sample input: Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose t =3.\n\nInput elements: [1,2,3]\n\nLet's see step by step:\n\nFirst element is 1.\n\nprev is 0.\n\nThe first condition (arr[1]=1 and prev 0? \u2192 yes \u2192 set prev to2.\n\nThen, for first element:\n\nprev is 2 \u2192 check prev is 2 or 0. Yes.\n\nThen compute 1-1=0 \u2192 mod2 is 0 \u2192 so output2 (prev remains 2).\n\nSecond element is2:\n\narr[i] is2. \n\nprev is 2. \n\nThe condition (prev is 2 or 0): yes.\n\n2-1 is1 \u2192 mod2 is 1 \u2192 so output1 (prev now 1?)\n\nWait yes: \n\nmod(2-1,2) \u2192 mod(1,2)=1 \u2192 so output1, set prev to1.\n\nThen third element is 3 \u2192 \n\nprev is 1 (now), so in the else block.\n\nmod(3-1,2)= mod(2,2)=0 \u2192 so in if, output1. \n\nThus the outputs are 2,1,1?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFirst step:\n\nFirst element 1 \u2192 after the if, prev set to2.\n\nThen, prev is 2, so first condition (yes). 1-1 is 0 \u2192 mod0 \u2192 yes, output 2. prev=2? No, after the code, since we're in the first case, it outputs 2 and sets prev to2.\n\nSecond element is 2:\n\nprev is 2 \u2192 yes, so check (2-1) mod2 \u21921 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 thus output 1 and set prev to1.\n\nThird element, 3:\n\nprev is1 \u2192 in else clause.\n\nmod(3-1==2, mod2=0 \u2192 so code would do print1 and set prev1.\n\nThus the outputs would be 2,1,1 \u2192 but let me check with the Java code to see if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait let me run the Java code step by step for input 1,2,3:\n\nSample input: \n\nFirst line is3 (t). \n\nSecond line: 1 2 3.\n\nJava code's solve() reads t as 3 then reads the array of three elements.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nFirst element is1.\n\narr[i] ==1 and prev is 0 \u2192 set prev to2.\n\nThen check prev (now 2) is either 2 or 0 \u2192 yes.\n\n(arr[0]-1) \u2192 0 mod2 \u21920 \u2192 so print 2, and set prev to2.\n\nSecond is2:\n\nprev is2 \u2192 yes.\n\n(2-1)=1 mod2 is 1 \u2192 else \u2192 print1 \u2192 prev1.\n\nThird is3.\n\nprev is1 \u2192 else clause.\n\nmod(3-1)=2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 so first part ( yeah the condition is 0).\n\nThus in code: \n\nif prev is else (the 1 case):\n\nthen if mod is0 \u2192 print1 and set prev1 \u2192 so yes. \n\nThus outputs are 2 1 1.\n\nSo the Fortran code should return the same.\n\nAnother test case: \n\nInput of arrays like [1,0, ...] but wait the input is integers from when? Probably the code uses 1-based? Or maybe can be any positive integer? \n\nAnyway, the code should work.\n\nPossible edge case when the first element is 1. prev is0 \u2192 then set prev to2. \n\nSo okay.\n\nAnother case: \n\nTake input arr [1]. \n\nFirst element:\n\nprev is0 \u2192 set to2. Then since prev is now2 \u2192 check mod0, so output2.\n\nThus for [1], output 2.\n\nAnother case: arr [3]\n\nprev0.\n\nprev is0 \u2192 in the first condition (since arr[1] is3, not 1 \u2192 so first if not triggered. So prev stays 0.\n\nNow in the condition, prev is0 \u2192 which is treated like previous case (prev is0 or 2). \n\nmod(3-1)=2 mod2 is 0 \u2192 so output2, set prev2.\n\nThus output 2. \n\nAnother scenario where arr is [2], prev 0.\n\nSo, prev is0, so first line not triggered (since arr not 1. \n\nThen, we check prev0 (so in the if block):\n\n mod(2-1 =1 mod2 \u21921 \u2192 so print1 \u2192 prev1.\n\nThus output 1.\n\nOkay, the code seems okay.\n\nNow to write the Fortran code properly, making sure to use 1-based indexing and setting prev correctly. \n\nAlso, in Fortran, the print statements should output each integer on separate lines?\n\nWait the problem requires for each number in the array, to print the outcome (1 or 2), each on a new line. Let me see:\n\nThe Java code's System.out.println(2 or 1) means each result is on a new line. So the Fortran code's print *, number will also output each on a new line. \n\nYes, in Fortran, each print statement with * will output followed by a new line. So that's correct.\n\nAnother point: All variables should be declared in the program. prevWinner is initialized as 0. \n\nYes, so in the code, prevWinner is initialized to 0.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nprevWinner =0 \n\nYes.\n\nSo the complete code:\n\nprogram codeforces_705_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: t, i, prevWinner\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n    \n    read(*,*) t\n    allocate( arr(t) )\n    read(*,*) (arr(i), i = 1, t)\n    \n    prevWinner =0\n    \n    do i =1, t\n        if( arr(i)==1 .and. prevWinner ==0 ) then\n            prevWinner =2\n        end if\n        \n        if ( prevWinner ==2 .or. prevWinner ==0 ) then\n            if ( mod( arr(i) - 1, 2 ) ==0 ) then\n                print *, 2\n                prevWinner =2\n            else\n                print *,1 \n                prevWinner =1\n            end if\n        else\n            if ( mod( arr(i) -1,2 ) ==0 ) then \n                print *,1\n                prevWinner =1\n            else\n                print *,2 \n                prevWinner =2\n            end if\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    deallocate(arr)\n    \nend program codeforces_705_B\n\nThat seems correct. \n\nWait but check the first condition:\n\nIn the Java code, the arr is indexed from 0 to t-1, but in Fortran it's 1 to t. The loop and code should correctly handle all elements.\n\nAnother possible bug is if the original Java code had a mistake, but since I'm translating as per instructions, it's supposed to replicate the behavior. So assuming the Java code is correct, this should work. \n\nTesting the case where the first element is not 1. \n\nLike arr [2]. \n\nprev is0 \u2192 first check, since arr(i) is not 1, it doesn't do anything. \n\nThen prev is0 \u2192 in first condition (prev is 0 \u2192 yes). \n\nSo mod(2-1=1 \u2192 1 mod2 \u21921 \u2192 so the else is taken again? \n\nWait no. The first condition (prev ==2 or 0 \u2192 yes ( since prev is0 \u2192 yes.\n\nmod( (arr(i)-1) \u21921 \u2192 mod is1.\n\nSo enters the else, meaning print1 and set to1.\n\nThus printed '1', which aligns with previous example.\n\nAnother test case with arr being [3,1,5]:\n\nLet me see:\n\nt is3, elements 3,1,5.\n\nLoop steps:\n\ni=1: 3.\n\nFirst check if 3 is1? no \u2192 so prev remains0.\n\nprev is0 \u2192 so the first if block (prev is0 or 2 \u2192 yes).\n\nmod(3-1)=2 mod 2:0 \u2192 print 2 \u2192 prev is now2.\n\ni=2: element1:\n\nprev is2 \u2192 check arr[i] =1 \u2192 yes. \n\nCheck prev was0? \u2192 no. Because prev is2 now. So that first if's condition is only done if arr is1 and prev is0. Here arr is1 but prev is 2 \u2192 so the if statement does nothing, as the first clause's condition is false (prev was not0).\n\nProceed to the condition:\n\nprev2 is 2 \u2192 thus in first condition (yes).\n\nmod(1-1=0 \u2192 mod0 \u2192 yes \u2192 print2 and prev remains2? \n\nWait, yes: \n\nmod 0 \u2192 yes:\n\nso print 2 \u2192 prev2.\n\nSo output so far 2 and 2.\n\nThird element 5:\n\nprev is2.\n\nSo first condition:\n\nmod(5-1=4 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 so yes \u2192 print2 again. prev stays2.\n\nSo the outputs are 2,2,2?\n\nWait let's think through the third element (5):\n\nelement5 \u2192 arr is 5.\n\nprev is 2 (from i=2 step). \n\nARR[i] is5. \n\nCheck arr==1? 5 is not \u2192 so first if does nothing.\n\nprev is2 \u2192 yes (first condition).\n\nmod(5-1=4 \u2192 mod2=0 \u2192 so print2, set prev to2.\n\nThus total output: 2 (from 3) \u2192 2 (from1), 2 (from5). \n\nSo yes. \n\nAlternatively, let me think Java's code for this input:\n\nFirst element3: \n\nprev starts as0. \n\nelement3 \u2192 first check for 1? Not. Then for code: \n\nprev is0 \u2192 so the first condition's:\n\nprev is0 or2 (since yes \u2192 prev is0). \n\n(3-1=2 mod2 0 \u2192 so print2 \u2192 prev becomes2. \n\nSecond is1: \n\nprev is2.\n\nThe first part: arr[i]=1. \n\nif (arr[i] ==1, and prev is0? \u2192 no. (prev is2). \n\nSo that first if clause in the code doesn't trigger. \n\nProceed to code's condition if prev is 2 or0 \u2192 yes (prev2). \n\nmod(1-1 is0 mod2 \u21920 \u2192 yes \u2192 so code prints2, and keeps prev2. \n\nThird element5 \u2192 same as before. \n\nThus outputs are 2,2,2. \n\nThe Fortran code does the same. So yes, works.\n\nLooks like the code is correct."
