So when in the Java code, sum[firstR] refers to the first R up to firstR (where firstR can go from 0 to N). So firstR can be 0, which is sum[0] in Java (0), or up to N (sum[N], the total). So in Fortran, to access sum[firstR], that would be sum(firstR +1) since the 1st element corresponds to Java's 0. Ah!

So maybe in the problem constraints, N is up to 1e5, and each element of W up to, say 1e9, so the total sum would be 1e14 which can fit into 64-bit. So variables like W can be integer(8). Wait, if in the problem statement's constraints allow N up to 1e5 and W elements up to 1e9, then the sum can be up to 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e14, which can be stored as a 64-bit integer. So declaring them as integer(8) is a safe choice for W and sum_array to avoid overflow.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code is doing. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads several integers from standard input: N, L, R, QL, QR, followed by an array W of size N. Then it calculates a prefix sum array sum, where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of W. After that, it loops through possible values of firstR (from 0 to N) and calculates a 'cand' value which is some combination of L, R, QL, QR multiplied by counts, and keeps track of the minimum value of 'cand'. Finally, it prints the minimum.\n\nHmm, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about the data types and structures. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but maybe we can use 0-based by adjusting the declaration. Wait, in Java the sum array is of size N+1, with sum[0] = 0 and sum[1] = W[0], etc. So in Fortran, we might need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nFirst, the input part. The Java code uses a Scanner. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using the * unit. So variables N, L, R, QL, QR can be read with a read(*,*) statement. Then the array W has N elements. In Fortran, declare W as an integer array of size N. The sum array is of size N+1, so sum(0 to N). But Fortran doesn't support 0-based indices unless we specify. Let me see: we can declare it as dimension(N+1), starting from 1? Or use offset. Alternatively, we can adjust the code to index from 1. So perhaps in Fortran, sum will have indices from 1 to N+1, with sum(1) = 0, sum(2) = W(1), etc. That might complicate things, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, in the problem description, the loop over n from 0 to N-1 (since in Java, the for loop is for (int n =0; n < N;n++) ). So in Fortran, the array W would be from 1 to N, and n would loop from 1 to N.\n\nWait the sum array in Java is built such that sum[0] =0, then for each n in 0..N-1, sum[n+1]=sum[n]+W[n]. So in Fortran, perhaps we should have sum as dimension(N+1), where sum(1) =0, and then loop i from 1 to N, and sum(i+1)=sum(i) + W(i). Since in Fortran W would be 1-based. \n\nOkay, so variables:\n\n- N, L, R, QL, QR: integers.\n\nThe array W's size is N elements (Fortran uses 1-based). So W is declared as integer, dimension(N). But in the code, when N is read first, we need an allocatable array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if N is a variable, then we can declare W as an allocatable array. So:\n\ndeclare W as integer, dimension(:), allocatable.\n\nSame for the sum array: integer, dimension(N+1). So first read N, then allocate W(N). Then proceed to read W's elements. \n\nThe next step is the calculation of the prefix sums. The sum array in Fortran will be dimension N+1, starting at 1. So sum(1) is 0, and for each i from 1 to N:\n\nsum(i+1) = sum(i) + W(i). Since the loop in Java is over n from 0 to N-1, in Fortran, the loop index (say i) will be from 1 to N, and W(i) is the element in Java's W[i-1] position. But the calculation is correct since the Java code sets W[n] in the loop, then sum[n+1] += W[n].\n\nSo moving on.\n\nThe main computational part is the loop over firstR from 0 to N (in Java). The variables firstR in Java range from 0 to N, which is total N+1 iterations. But since firstR in the Java code can be 0 to N (inclusive). Wait the loop is for (int firstR =0; firstR<=N; firstR++){...}. \n\nBut in Fortran, the loop index can be from 0 to N if we use an integer variable that starts at 0. However, Fortran 90+ typically uses 1-based indices, but the variables can be integers. So we can have a loop: do firstR=0,N, and that's okay as an index variable, not array indices.\n\nInside the loop, the lCount is firstR. Because in Java, lCount = firstR; rCount = N - lCount; since lCount is firstR.\n\nWait the Java code has:\n\nint lCount = firstR;\n\nint rCount = N - lCount;\n\nBecause the firstR is the number of elements in left partition? Maybe. The variable names are a bit ambiguous, but the main thing is translating correctly.\n\nThen, the 'cand' is calculated as sum[lCount] * L + (sum[N] - sum[lCount])* R. Wait, the sum array in Java is sum[N] is the total sum up to N. In Java, sum's size is N+1, so sum[N] is the total sum. \n\nBut in the Fortran version, sum starts at 1, so sum(N+1) would be the total. So in the Fortran code, the same expression would be (sum(lCount) \u00d7 L) + (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount)) \u00d7 R.\n\nWait, no: in Java, the sum has an index from 0 to N. So sum[N] is the total sum. So in Fortran's sum(1) is sum[0] in Java, and sum(i) corresponds to Java's sum[i-1]? Wait not quite. Let me see:\n\nJava:\n\nsum[0] =0 \n\nsum[1] = W[0] \n\nsum[2] = sum[1] + W[1] etc.\n\nSo sum in Java is 0-based with length N+1. In Fortran, sum(1) corresponds to Java's sum[0], sum(2) to sum[1], ..., sum(N+1) is Java's sum[N].\n\nSo when in Java, lCount is firstR (which can be 0 to N), then:\n\nJava's sum[lCount] is sum[firstR], so in Fortran's equivalent would be sum(firstR +1) ?\n\nWait not exactly. Let me map indices.\n\nWait no, for example, for firstR=0 in Java:\n\nlCount = 0 (number of elements on left?), so in Java's code:\n\nsum[lCount] is sum[0], which is 0.\n\nIn Fortran, sum starts at 1, so the equivalent is sum(1). Therefore, when lCount is firstR in Java, the Fortran code's sum(lCount +1) would be sum[firstR] in Java. \n\nWait perhaps I'm overcomplicating; perhaps better to write the Fortran code so that sum in Fortran is analogous to the Java code's sum, but with offset: \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nsum(1) = 0 \n\nsum(2) = sum(1)+W(1)\n\nsum(3) = sum(2)+W(2)\n\n... \n\nsum(N+1) is the total. So when in the Java code, sum[firstR] refers to the first R up to firstR (where firstR can go from 0 to N). So firstR can be 0, which is sum[0] in Java (0), or up to N (sum[N], the total). So in Fortran, to access sum[firstR], that would be sum(firstR +1) since the 1st element corresponds to Java's 0.\n\nAh! So when moving variables from Java to Fortran, for sum:\n\nJava's sum[i] corresponds to Fortran's sum(i+1). \n\nTherefore, when in Java:\n\nsum[lCount] is Java sum's sum[firstR]. So in Fortran, to get that value, it's sum(firstR +1).\n\nSimilarly, when in Java they calculate (sum[N] - sum[lCount]), that's (Java sum[N] - Java sum[firstR]) \u2192 (Fortran's sum(N+1) - Fortran's sum(firstR +1)).\n\nGot it. So in the Fortran code, the equivalent expressions are:\n\n cand = sum(firstR +1)* L + ( sum(N+1) - sum(firstR+1) )*R \n\nOkay. Then the next part:\n\n llCount = Math.max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nWait in Java: rCount is N - lCount. So lCount - rCount -1 \u2192 firstR - (N - firstR) -1 \u2192 2*firstR - (N+1)\n\nWait let me see:\n\nlCount is firstR, so rCount = N - lCount = N - firstR.\n\nllCount = max(0, lCount - rCount -1) \u2192 firstR - (N - firstR) -1 \u2192 firstR - N + firstR -1 \u2192 (2 firstR) - (N+1)\n\nThis could be negative, so taking the max with zero.\n\nSimilarly for the other term:\n\nrrCount = max(0, rCount - lCount -1 \u2192 (N-firstR - firstR) -1 \u2192 (N - 2 firstR -1).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nlCount = firstR \n\nrCount = N - lCount\n\nthen:\n\nll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount -1) \u2192 which is lCount is firstR, so l_count - r_count-1 \u2192 (firstR) - (N - firstR) -1 \u2192 2 firstR - (N +1) \u2192 if that's positive, else 0.\n\nSimilarly for rr_count: max(0, rCount - lCount -1) \u2192 (N - firstR - firstR) -1 \u2192 N -2 firstR -1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nSince there is a MAX function, or we can write:\n\nll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nBut in Fortran, we can use the MAX function. Fortran's MAX is for two numbers. So, we can write:\n\nll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\nSame with the other variable.\n\nThen, adding ll_count * QL and rr_count * QR to the candidate.\n\nFinally, compare with min and find the minimum. \n\nNow, variables:\n\nThe 'min' variable in Java is initialized to Long.MAX_VALUE. In Fortran, the equivalent would be initializing to a very large number, like huge(0) or similar. Since in Fortran integers can be of different kinds, but assuming that the numbers fit in default integer or derived types.\n\nWait, what is the data type for the variables? In Java, the 'cand' is a long, since L, R etc could be multiplied and summed to big numbers, so in Fortran, to handle large numbers, we should use integer(8) or similar.\n\nWait Fortran uses KIND parameters. So variables like min might need to be of kind 8 (if the problem requires it). Let me see:\n\nThe initial value of min in Java is Long.MAX_VALUE (~ 2^63-1). To store that in Fortran, use an integer(8) with kind 8 typically. So in the code, variables min and cand should be integers of large enough size. So perhaps in the code, we'll use INTEGER*8 or in modern Fortran: integer(8).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem constraints ensure that 32-bit is enough, but better to be safe. So let's use integer(8).\n\nSo steps for code structure:\n\n1. Read N, L, R, QL, QR.\n\n2. Read N elements into array W (Fortran 1-based).\n\n3. Compute the prefix sum array sum(1:N+1), where sum(1)=0 and the rest is as described.\n\n4. Initialize min to a large value, say huge(1_8).\n\n5. Loop firstR from 0 to N (inclusive). \n\nIn each iteration:\n\n   lCount = firstR\n\n   rCount = N - lCount\n\n   compute:\n\n   term1 = sum(lCount + 1) * L\n\n   term2 = (sum(N+1) - sum(lCount+1)) * R\n\n   cand = term1 + term2 \n\n   then compute llCount and rrCount:\n\n   ll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount -1)\n\n   rr_count = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n   then add ll_count*QL and rr_count*QR to cand.\n\n   if cand is less than current min, update min.\n\n6. After all firstR iterations, print min.\n\nNow, coding in Fortran.\n\nFirst, declare variables. Here's the plan.\n\nprogram codeforces_354_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\ninteger, allocatable :: W(:), sum_array(:) ! sum_array(1:N+1)\n\ninteger(int64) :: min_val, cand\n\ninteger :: firstR, lCount, rCount, ll_count, rr_count\n\n! Read input\n\nread(*,*) N, L, R, QL, QR\n\nallocate( W(N), sum_array(N+1) ) \n\nread(*,*) W(1:N)\n\n! compute prefix sum\n\nsum_array(1) = 0\n\ndo i=1, N\n\n   sum_array(i+1) = sum_array(i) + W(i)\n\nenddo\n\nmin_val = huge(0_8)  ! initial value (but need to ensure it's the largest 64-bit?)\n\nWait, in Fortran, huge(0) gives the largest integer for default kind, but we need for 8 bytes. In Fortran 2003 and later, you can use selected_int_kind. Like, use integer(8) variables, and then the value is huge(0_8).\n\nAlternatively, set min_val to a large value like 1e18, but to be precise:\n\nProbably best to use:\n\nmin_val = huge(0_8)\n\nor initialize to a big value like 1e18.\n\nWait, the maximum for integer(8) (signed) is 2^63-1, which is about 9e18. So initializing to that value would require using the FPTOINTRF1 or similar, but in practice, the initial value can be set to a very big number.\n\nAlternatively, let me just set min_val = huge(0_8). Then in code:\n\nread input:\n\nThen the loop:\n\nloop firstR from 0 to N.\n\nIn the code, in Fortran:\n\ndo firstR = 0, N\n\n    lCount = firstR\n\n    rCount = N - lCount\n\n    ! compute term1 and term2\n\n    term1 = sum_array(firstR +1) * L\n\n    term2 = ( sum_array(N+1) - sum_array(firstR+1) ) * R\n\n    cand = term1 + term2\n\n    ! compute ll_count\n\n    ll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount - 1)\n\n    rr_count = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n\n    cand = cand + ll_count * QL + rr_count * QR\n\n    ! update min_val\n\n    if (cand < min_val) then\n\n        min_val = cand\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSo all in code.\n\nWait variables:\n\nMust note that the cand must be of type int64 (same as min_val). So all the terms need to be integers. But variables like lCount, etc are integers, which are default (probably 4 bytes) but when multiplied by L (integer), maybe resulting in 32-bit. So if L is big and N up to, say, 1e5, then W elements summed may lead to big numbers which can cause overflow. So, sum_array should be of kind 8 as well?\n\nWait. Wait the problem's code in Java uses sum as an array of int, and cand is a long. So in the Java code, the (sum... multiplied by L, etc) can cause overflow but in Java, the 'cand' is long.\n\nHence to avoid overflow in Fortran, sum_array should be integer(8) or similar.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because the terms like sum[N] can be up to N * (max W), which might need larger than 4 bytes.\n\nWait: Original Java code declares 'sum' as int[], but in the cand calculation, it's multiplied by L or R. So Java uses the sum as ints but multiplies them with L and R (int types?), but the total 'cand' is stored as a long. To prevent overflow, but in Java, you can have overflow unless careful. In Fortran, to replicate this correctly, sum array and the terms should be in KIND that can hold the multiplications. So probably better to make the sum_array as integer(kind=8). Since in Fortran, you can use integers of 8 bytes even if you don't need it, to be safe.\n\nSo, changing variable declarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: sum_array(N+1)\n\nand also W as integer(8), perhaps? Or not?\n\nLooking back at the Java code: the input for W is via in.nextInt(), which is an integer (32-bit). So maybe in the problem constraints, N is up to 1e5, and each element of W up to, say 1e9, so the total sum would be 1e14 which can fit into 64-bit. So variables like W can be integer(8).\n\nWait, if in the problem statement's constraints allow N up to 1e5 and W elements up to 1e9, then the sum can be up to 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e14, which can be stored as a 64-bit integer. So declaring them as integer(8) is a safe choice for W and sum_array to avoid overflow.\n\nThus, in coding variables:\n\nVariables L, R, QL, QR can be integers (assuming they don't exceed 2^31), but multiplying them with sum terms (integer(8))\u2014so when multiplied by L (integer), the result is integer(8).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndeclare variables:\n\ninteger :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: W(:), sum_array(:)\n\nAlso, the variables firstR, lCount, rCount, ll_count, rr_count can be integers (since they're loop indices or counts which can't be more than N+1 which is manageable with 4-byte).\n\nThe 'cand' and 'min_val' should be integer(8).\n\nSo putting this all together, the code would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_354_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: N, L, R, QL, QR\n  integer(8), allocatable :: W(:), sum_array(:)\n  integer(8) :: min_val, cand\n  integer :: firstR, lCount, rCount, ll_count, rr_count\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) N, L, R, QL, QR\n\n  allocate(W(N))\n  allocate(sum_array(N+1))\n\n  read(*,*) W(1:N)\n\n  ! Compute prefix sums\n  sum_array(1) = 0\n  integer :: i\n  do i = 1,N\n    sum_array(i+1) = sum_array(i) + W(i)\n  end do\n\n  ! Initialize min_val \n  min_val = huge(0_8)\n\n  do firstR = 0,N\n    lCount = firstR\n    rCount = N - lCount\n\n    cand = sum_array(firstR+1)*L + (sum_array(N+1) - sum_array(firstR+1))*R\n    ll_count = max(0, lCount - rCount -1) \n    rr_count = max(0, rCount - lCount -1)\n    cand = cand + ll_count * QL + rr_count * QR\n\n    ! Update min_val\n    if (cand < min_val) then\n      min_val = cand\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the result\n  write(*,*) min_val\n\nend program codeforces_354_A\n\nWait, but in the code above, variables 'll_count' and 'rr_count' are integers, which is okay since they are counts derived from N and firstR (which are up to N), so can be stored as integers.\n\nWait: the max function in Fortran is handled via the max intrinsic, which takes two integers as arguments. So for example:\n\nll_count = max(0, expression)\n\nIs okay.\n\nWait, what is the data type here? The 'max(0, ...)' where the second argument is an integer (since lCount and rCount are integers), so it's okay, and the result is an integer. Thus, ll_count is of type integer, correct.\n\nYes. So that's okay.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nFor the prefix sum array loops: the indices are correct.\n\nIs firstR from 0 to N? yes.\n\nWait in the Java code, firstR is up to N (including N). So in Fortran's loop, firstR can be 0 and N. Correct.\n\nChecking the terms:\n\nThe expression for cand in the first two terms is as needed.\n\nThe ll_count and rr_count expressions are also correct.\n\nThus, this should translate the Java code into Fortran correctly.\n\nOne thing to note: In the Java code, the first sum is from 0 to N elements (firstR which can be N gives lCount=N, so rCount becomes 0. The ll_count and rr_count:\n\nIf firstR =N, then rCount is 0. \n\nSo ll_count = max(0, N - (N) -1 ) = max(0, -1) \u2192 0. rr_count is max(0, 0 - N -1 ), which is a negative number \u2192 0.\n\nThus, OK.\n\nOther edge cases seem okay.\n\nNow, need to make sure that the Fortran code is written correctly. For example: in the program, variables must be declared correctly. Allocate blocks correctly.\n\nThe loops. Yes.\n\nThe write statement uses * formatting, which is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the 'implicit none' prevents undeclared variables.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct translation."
