But the code's original logic is that 'spawned' refers to the indices of the unsorted array, which are then reordered by sorting, so the indices no longer correspond to the same elements as when it was allocated.",

Common in fortran 90, one approach is to allocate arrays with sufficient size, but since the problem constraints are up to N being maybe up to 20 (since 2^20 is million, but perhaps competition problems may have N limited), but with N=20, the active array might be needing to have length up to something like double each time. Wait the original code's loop is N steps, and each step the active array may double in size (since for each element, adding a new one?), but I need to see:\n\nThe original java code's loop works as:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        active.sort(Collections.reverseOrder()); // sorts active in descending. List<Integer> activated = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        int next = size -1; \n\n        for (int slime : active) {\n\n            while (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) {\n\n                next--;\n\n            }\n\n            if (next <0)  ... spawned[next] = true;\n\n            activated.add(S[next]);\n\n        }\n\n        active.addAll(activated); // appends the activated list to active\n\n    } So per iteration, the size of active can increase by the same number of its current elements.",

So all elements before next (when moving down from next = size-1) would be S[next] = S[size-2] (the second largest) is less than.

Wait no, in java code: Wait for each slime in active_sorted (descending order), the 'next_val' is starting from size_val-1 each iteration's beginning. Wait the next_val variable start at size_val-1 in each loop of the i's iteration, and then for each slime, the loop  scans down. thus each slime starts the 'while' loop at the next_val's current value. thus the 'next_val's value continues from the previous iteration.

Initialize spawned; all to .false., then set the last original index to .true.\n\nspawned = .false.\nspawned(size_val-1) = .true.\n\n! Read the S array: do i =0",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to convert this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the code does first so I can understand how to translate it properly.\n\nThe Java code seems to solve some problem related to slimes and N rounds. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read N, which determines the size as 2^N.\n2. Initialize an array S of size elements, then read them, sort them.\n3. There's a boolean array 'spawned' tracking which elements have been used.\n4. Starts with the largest element as active, marks it as spawned.\n5. Then for N iterations, process the active list, finding suitable slimes to activate.\n6. If at any point it can't find a next valid slime, output \"No\". Otherwise, after all steps, output \"Yes\".\n\nFirst, translating Java to Fortran. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, declarations.\n\nIn Java, variables are declared with types. For example, Scanner sc, int N, etc. In Fortran, variables have to be declared with types. Since Fortran is typically older, but assuming using Fortran 90 or later, which has modules.\n\nThe code structure will be a program with modules? Probably just a program here.\n\nLet me break down each part:\n\nStarting with the Input:\n\nJava reads via Scanner. In Fortran, use read statements. The main input is reading N first, then 2^N numbers.\n\nWait, the Java code does:\n\nint N = sc.nextInt();\nint size = 1 << N; // which is 2^N\n\nThen reads S from nextInt. So the input format is first N, then the array S of size elements.\n\nIn Fortran, the program would first read N, compute size as 2^N, then read the array S of size.\n\nThe Java code does:\n\nfor (int i =0; ... ) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen sorts the S array.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default? Or not? Actually Fortran arrays can be 1-based or can be set with the bounds. Have to be careful.\n\nWait Java's arrays are 0-based. The code defines size elements from 0 to size-1.\n\nSo in Fortran, I can use an array from 1 to size, but likely need to adjust all indices accordingly to make it 1-based.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to use 0-based? Hmm, Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. Maybe better adjust the code to use 1-based.\n\nAlternatively, can set the lower bounds.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90, you can declare an array as integers(0:size-1), which would be 0-based, but need to be careful with the declarations.\n\nAlternatively, using 1-based in Fortran and adjust all indices accordingly. Let me think:\n\nOriginal Java code uses 0-based:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < size; i++) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nIn Fortran, if I make S(1) correspond to S[0], that would complicate. Alternatively, the Fortran array can be 0-based.\n\nWait Fortran allows array indices to start at any integer. So, can explicitly declare:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:2**N -1) :: S\n\nBut variable-sized arrays are a bit more complicated.\n\nHmm variables in Fortran's array dimension can be done with dynamically-sized arrays. Since N is read at runtime, we need allocatable arrays.\n\nWait right, the size (which is 2^N) is not known at compile time. So the arrays need to be dynamically allocated.\n\nAh right, so in Fortran, we first read N, compute size = 2**N, then allocate arrays S(size-1), but indexes might need adjusting.\n\nAlternatively, using 1-based arrays, so S(1 to 2^N). Let's outline steps.\n\nFirst step in code:\n\nRead N.\n\nCompute size = 2^N. Since 2^N could be large depending on N's value. N is presumably limited so it doesn't overflow; in programming competition problems N is often smaller.\n\nThen, we have arrays:\n\n- S: array of integers with size elements. Java uses 0-based.\n\n- spawned: boolean array of size elements. Java initializes to false, but then sets spawned[size-1] = true (the last element is 1-based? Or in Java's original code, size is (1<<N), and indexes 0 to size-1. So the last element is index size-1.\n\nWait in Java:\n\nspawned[size -1] = true; which is the last index.\n\nThen, in Fortran:\n\nSo if S is 1-based to size (indexes 1 to 2^N), then the last element is S(size). Hmm no, indexes 0 to size-1 in Java became 1-based in Fortran? That complicates indices, need to be carefull.\n\nWait let me think carefully:\n\nIn Java, the spawned array has indices from 0 to size-1 (since the size is (1<<N)). Hence, in Fortran, to mirror the indices exactly, we could have arrays starting at 0. But in Fortran by default they start at 1, so to make arrays starting at 0 can be declared with:\n\ninteger, dimension(-0 : size) :: array\n\nor perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:size-1) :: S\n\nSo that the indices are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nThe arrays S and spawned must be 0-based.\n\nTherefore declaring them with the allocatable arrays.\n\nSteps needed:\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nThen compute size as 2 ** N.\n\nThen:\n\nAllocate S(0 : size -1), and spawned(0 : size-1).\n\nThen input S.\n\nRead the values for S from the input, then sort them in increasing order.\n\nWait Java reads all the S elements first, then sorts them.\n\nWait:\nfor (int i=0; ... ) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen:\n\nArrays.sort(S);\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nRead all elements, then sort using a routine (e.g., via sort function in fortran's intrinsic method, or call a routine).\n\nIn Fortran, there is the Mergesort or quicksort? The array can be sorted via:\n\ncall sort(s)\n\nassuming good to use the intrinsic.\n\nBut need to check.\n\nHmm in Fortran, you can use the intrinsic function 'sort' which is available in Fortran 90+.\n\nWait, actually the intrinsic for sorting is in the 'iso_fortran_env' module? Or perhaps better to implement.\n\nWait the 'sort' subroutine is part of the standard libraries? Let me recall.\n\nYes, there's 'sort' in the Fortran standard. So for a 1D array:\n\ncall merge_sort(S)\n\nWait maybe the actual name is slightly different, but the intrinsic exists.\n\nAlternatively, the syntax is in Fortran 90: to sort an array, you can do:\n\ncall sort(S) (but I might be misremembering the name. Let me check mentally.)\n\nOh right, the correct function is:\n\ncall msort(S, indexes)\n\nWait perhaps need to see how to sort an array in place.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to use the 'merge_sort' or other, but perhaps it's better to use the built-in function with the kind of:\n\ncall sort(S)\n\nAssuming that is correct. Let me confirm. Wait in Fortran 90, indeed, you can sort an array with the following?\n\nWait perhaps the following code would do:\n\ncall sort(S, MYPREDICATE) for custom sort, but for default, maybe the function is called sort. Wait I'm now getting uncertain, perhaps I should check.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'merge_sort' procedure from the standard library.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a custom bubble sort, but that's not efficient, but for the purpose of code conversion, perhaps the standard method is present.\n\nWait let me think: in modern Fortran, there's a generic function with the intrinsic\u2014 perhaps using the 'sort' routine. Maybe the first argument is the array and the second an optional comparison function. So for default, sorting in ascending order can be done with:\n\ncall sort(S)\n\nYes, that's the intended approach. So that should sort S in increasing order.\n\nSo sorted array is like in Java.\n\nNow the next part: in Java, 'boolean[] spawned = new boolean[size];' initialized all to false? Because in Java, initialized to false by default.\n\nIn Fortran, the arrays are initialized to zero (false for logical arrays).\n\nThus, spawned is declared as a logical array, which starts with .false. (zero).\n\nThen spawned(size -1) = .true. (since in Java, the last index (size-1) is set to true).\n\nSo first, after allocating, set spawned to .false. (maybe redundant because it's initialized so), but to set spawned(size-1) to .true.\n\nWait in Java, spawned is initialized with new boolean[size], which initializes all elements to false, then on line:\n\nspawned[size -1] = true;\n\nSo similarly in Fortran:\n\nlogical, dimension(0 : size -1) :: spawned = .false.  (at allocation time)\n\nThen spawned(size -1) = .true.\n\nYes.\n\nThen in Fortran code steps:\n\nAfter reading and sorting S, proceed.\n\nThen the code initializes active as an ArrayList containing the last element of S. Wait in Java:\n\nList<Integer> active = new ArrayList<>();\nactive.add(S[size-1]);\n\nWait wait no. Wait in Java, after the for loop (reading into S) and sort S, then they do the same again?\n\nWait let me re-express the Java code:\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nWait the initial code:\n\n    spawned[size - 1] = true; // So in Java.\n\nWait wait, there are two lines:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nWait the code has:\n\n int[] S = new int[size]; \n\n... then after a for loop (loop over N?) Or no.\n\nWait let me look at the code structure again.\n\nWait the Java code does:\n\nAfter reading N, the code:\n\nint size = (1 << N); \n\nThen initializations:\n\nint[] S = new int[size]; \n\nboolean[] spawned = new boolean[size]; \nspawned[size-1] = true;\n\nThen:\n\n for (int i =0; i < size; i++) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, Arrays.sort(S);\n\nWait wait, so the first line after the spawned[size-1] = true is to read all the S elements, then sort.\n\nWait that's a bit strange. The first assignment of spawned[size-1] is probably a leftover from a previous step, but look:\n\nWait the original Java code:\n\npublic class atcoder_ABC140_F {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int N = sc.nextInt();\n        int size = (1 << N);\n        int[] S = new int[size];\n        boolean[] spawned = new boolean[size];\n        spawned[size - 1] = true; // <--- hmm this line\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n        Arrays.sort(S);\n\nWait the spawned[size-1] is set to true here, before the S array is filled with input values? Wait no, that's a problem.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait yes, the order is:\n\n 1. Read N.\n\n 2. size = 1<<n.\n\n 3. initialize S and spawned arrays.\n\n 4. Set spawned[size-1] to true (but S has not yet been read)\n\n 5. Then read the array into S (0..size-1)\n\n 6. sort S.\n\nAh! So that line `spawned[size-1] = true` is done before reading the input? That is a mistake?\n\nWait that would mean the spawned array is modified before the input has been read, but maybe the initial assignment was meant to be after.\n\nWait perhaps a typo in the original code?\n\nWait hold on, let's recheck:\n\nOriginal code:\n\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int N = sc.nextInt();\n    int size = (1 << N);\n    int[] S = new int[size];\n    boolean[] spawned = new boolean[size];\n    spawned[size - 1] = true; // this line\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n    Arrays.sort(S);\n\nThe line \"spawned[size-1] = true\" is executed *before* the for loop that reads S's values. But why? Since after reading the S values, then they sort them. So the spawned array was pointing into the initial S array before it's been read. So this is an error?\n\nWait that must be a mistake in the original code. Because S's initial values (before reading) are uninitialized? But in java's array, the ints are initialized to zero, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nWait but in Java, the spawned array is of size 'size', which is 2^N. As long as the index is valid. The problem is that in the next steps, after the sorting, the indices refer to the sorted array's elements, not the original.\n\nAh, this is a possible bug in the original code. Because the 'spawned' array is initialized by setting the last entry (for the initial unsorted array's last element) to true, but after sorting, the indices now refer to different elements.\n\nAh, That's a problem.\n\nWait the code's logic might require that after sorting S into order, the spawned array's indices are re-mapped based on the sorted array. But the code's original logic is that 'spawned' refers to the indices of the unsorted array, which are then reordered by sorting, so the indices no longer correspond to the same elements as when it was allocated.\n\nThis would mean the original code is erroneous. But perhaps the code has been written incorrectly here.\n\nWait that's an issue. Let me look again at the code's logic.\n\nWait the problem statement likely requires the slimes to be processed in some way. So perhaps the code's logic is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spawned array should be based on the indices of the sorted array. Let me think.\n\nThe code reads all the S elements into the array and then sorts them. Thus the S array after sorting has the elements in increasing order, with S[0] after sorting is the smallest element.\n\nThe initial spawned array was initialized as spawned[size-1] (the original array's last element). But after sorting, S[0] to S[size-1] are the ordered elements.\n\nThus the code's original line 'spawned[size-1] = true' refers to the original (unsorted array)'s last index, but after sorting, that original last element is in some position in the S array now, not at index size-1.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic has a flaw here. Hmm. But perhaps that's an error in the original code provided here?\n\nHmm, this could be a confusion between the indices. The problem requires that when they are sorted, the active list is the largest element (sorted S's last index? No, in Java after Arrays.sort(S) sorts in natural order, so from lowest to highest. So S[0] is the smallest, S[size-1] is the largest.\n\nWait yes! Arrays.sort(S) in Java sorts in ascending order, so the elements are in 0..size-1 being increasing.\n\nWait but the Java code then proceeds to:\n\nactive = new ArrayList<>();\nactive.add( S[size-1] )\n\nBecause the largest element is now at S[size - 1].\n\nBecause the spawned array's indices refer to the unsorted array's indices. That's a problem.\n\nWait wait that's a big problem. The Java code has a flaw here because the 'spawned' array was initialized on the initial (unsorted) S array's index, but after sorting, the elements are moved, so the spawned array no longer points to the same elements.\n\nWait this must be a mistake in the Java code provided. Maybe the original code is intended to sort the S array first?\n\nWait let's read the Java code again:\n\nThe code first initializes S and sets spawned[size-1] (unsorted S's last element) to true. Then reads the S elements, sorts them, then proceeds. \n\nBut the 'spawned' array is tied to the indices of the initial array before sorting. So the code after sorting is considering the current elements of S[i] which are now sorted, but the spawned array is pointing to the wrong indices.\n\nFor example, suppose the S values before sorting are [5,3,8]. Then after sorting, it's [3,5,8].\n\nOriginally, the spawned[2] was true (index 2 was 8, the last element before sorting. After sorting, that's now element at index 2 (still 8?), so that part is okay? Wait actually the original value at index size-1 (the last one) was 8 (for the example), which after sorting is still at index 2, because after sorting into increasing order, the last element is the largest. Wait yes! So the largest element will be at S[size-1], but the value of S[size-1] (after sorting) is the largest among all elements. However, the *original* S[size-1] (the unsorted array) was being stored in spawned[size-1], which may or may not correspond to the maximum element in the array. \n\nWait wait that's a different problem. The Java code's logic for initializing 'spawned' might be wrong.\n\nWait let me think through the code. \n\nThe problem's logic might involve choosing elements in a way where you need to track which elements are available.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the indices based on the original array's position? But that doesn't make sense, because the S values are being sorted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spawned array is supposed to track the elements based on their value. But no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the code's intention. Let me think.\n\nThe Java code's flow:\n\nAfter reading S array, then sorts it. \n\nSo after sorting, the S array is in increasing order.\n\nThen, the spawned array was set spawned[size-1] to true before the sorting. \n\nTherefore, the original array's elements are in some order, and spawning is on that original's index size-1. However, after sorting, the S's array elements are reordered, so the same index size-1 in \"spawned\" now points to the element which was the original's second to last element's value (if swapped to make it sorted).\n\nWait that's exactly the problem. \n\nWait this must be an error in the original Java code. Because the spawned array was supposed to track which element is available, but after sorting the S array, the indices in spawned no longer correspond to the elements in the current S array.\n\nTherefore, the code as written is incorrect. However, perhaps the code is correct in another way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the labels in the spawned array are wrong, but the S array is sorted in the code, so the elements are in a different order, but the code might correctly manage that.\n\nWait perhaps in the code, the key is that the S array is being stored in sorted order, and spawned array is being indexed according to the sorted array.\n\nAh! Here's the thing: Maybe the code is actually written in a way that uses the indices of the sorted array. Let me check:\n\nThe Java code has, after sorting S, the line:\n\nactive.add(S[size - 1]); \n\nWhich is the largest element (since sorted in ascending order, so the last element is the biggest). \n\nSo the spawned[size -1] being set to true refers to the position in the original array, but the S array after sorting has a new value at index size-1. \n\nThis can not be correct.\n\nThus, the code has a logical error here. However, perhaps the original code is written this way because it first reads the elements into the S array, then sorts, but the indices for spawned are actually the indices of the originally read S elements.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait maybe the problem uses the values, not the indices. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code was written with an error, but since the user is asking to translate it, I have to assume that the code is correct, even if there is a possible mistake.\n\nSo let me proceed, assuming that the Java code provided is correct, and perhaps I've incorrectly analyzed the error.\n\nWait perhaps the 'spawned' array is supposed to track the indices based on the sorted S array. Thus after sorting S, the indices correspond correctly.\n\nWait, but the line where spawned is initialized as 'true' on element size-1 is done before the S array is even read. Wait the first step:\n\nWait in Java:\n\nThe initial code:\n\nScanner sc = new Scanner(...);\n\nint N = sc.nextInt();\n\nint size = (1 << N); \n\nint[] S = new int[size];  // allocate to size elements.\n\nboolean[] spawned = new boolean[size];   // initializes to 0, so all false except set below.\n\nspawned[size -1] = true; // this is 0-based.\n\nThen filling the array:\n\nfor (i from 0 to size-1) S[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen, Arrays.sort(S) is called. Thus after sorting, the S elements are in order.\n\nThe line where spawned depended on the S's indices (size-1) before the array is filled is a mistake because S wasn't filled yet. So spawning size-1 refers to some arbitrary value that was not input? \n\nWait the spawn array's flagged element should be part of the input.\n\nBut the spawned array is set to true for the last position before reading the values. However, the S array is read into from input after that initial assignment.\n\nWait the problem is, the initial line 'spawned[size-1] = true' sets that position as spawned, but that position in the original unsorted S before any input. Wait but since the S array is declared and allocated, but the values are read after, then the initial line `spawned[size-1] = true` is irrelevant, because that's just to track whether the value at that position was spawned before input. \n\nBut after we read the input, the corresponding element's value is whatever the user input, so that spawned array now correctly tracks the indices of the array as filled in after the input is read.\n\nWait but the code sets spawned's indices before the reading. The reading will overwrite S's values, but the spawned is independent. Since S's values are read into S[0] to S[size-1], the indices are correctly mapped. \n\nSo the spawned array flags an index (position in the array) whether it was \"activated\" or whatever.\n\nSo the problem is after the code sets 'spawned[size-1] = true', then reads into the S array. \n\nThen after sorting, the array S is in sorted order. The spawned array is an array of booleans, but the indices are now referring to the sorted array. \n\nWait but the spawned array is tracking the indices of the original array (before sorting). Because when the S array is sorted, the indices of S refer to different elements. \n\nTherefore in the next step:\n\nactive.add(S[size-1]) is correct because after sorting, the largest value is at S[size-1], but in the spawned array, the same index refers to the original unsorted position. \n\nWhich is a flaw. \n\nWait this is really problematic. Because the code 'active' starts with the largest element (correct, from the sorted array), but the corresponding spawned array's index refers to the original sorting.\n\nThus, this would lead to incorrect results.\n\nHmm, perhaps the entire code has indices which are mixed between sorted and unsorted S. But the user might have provided the correct code, so I need to translate it as is.\n\nTherefore proceed.\n\nFirst, the code's structure:\n\nInfortran, the main program would read N, compute size=2^N, allocate arrays S (size elements, 0-based), allocated as integer array.\n\nThen, read all S elements into it, then sort in ascending order (via the sort intrinsic).\n\nBut after that, the spawned array (logical array 0-based) has the index size-1 set to true, but this is in the original (unsorted array).\n\nWait in Java, the spawned is set to true before fill in the array. That is:\n\nIn Java:\n\nAfter allocating:\n\nspawned[size-1] = true\n\nthen:\n\nfor(int i=0;... S[i]=sc.nextInt();\n\nthen sort(S);\n\nThus, the S array's indices before being filled and after can be different. However, the S element at position size-1 in the initial array (before fill) is just whatever, and after reading, it holds the last input value. Thus the spawned array's mark is on index size-1 (the last element in the initial array). However, after sorting, the elements may change which elements are in each index except that the last element after sorting will contain the largest.\n\nThe spawned array is tracking the indices based on the original array's indices (before sorting). Thus, the algorithm must be considering that the indices are from the original array.\n\nWait that's a key point for the function.\n\nWait, the problem might be such that the indices need to remain according to the original array's order. Wait but why would that be? \n\nAlternatively perhaps the spawned array is intended to track individual elements regardless of their location. Since after sorting, when you have an element, you need to know it's index in the sorted array. \n\nHmm. So this might be a code misunderstanding in the translation, but since my task is to translate the java code correctly, I need to follow exactly what the code does, even if it has a problem.\n\nTherefore, in fortran code, I will proceed as per the java code's syntax.\n\nNow.\n\nProceeding step by step for conversion.\n\nFirst, in fortran:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC140_F\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, size, i, j\n    integer, allocatable :: S(:)\n    logical, allocatable :: spawned(:)\n    integer, allocatable :: active(:) \n\nWait but Java's 'active' is a list which can be dynamically added. In Fortran, using arrays might require dynamic allocation, but lists can be simulated via allocatable arrays with resizing.\n\nAlternatively, use a list with a temporary array and reallocate as needed.\n\nAlternatively, use a linked list structure, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, just proceed using arrays and resize when needed, even if less efficient.\n\nWait the active list in java starts as having the first element (the last element of the sorted array) added, then in each step adds elements.\n\nWait in Fortran, perhaps better to use dynamic arrays. Let me think.\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nRead(N,*) \n\nthen size = 2 **N \n\nallocate(S(0:size-1), spawned(0:size-1))\n\nthen read the S array: \n\ndo i=0, size-1\n   read(*,*) S(i)\nend do\n\nthen sort S in ascending order.\n\ncall sort(S) \n\nthen, the 'spawned' array was set only after the first allocation? Wait in java, it was set before the array is filled, but in Fortran code, to replicate exactly, the spawned array should first be set as:\n\nspawned = .false.\n spawned(size-1) = .true.\n\nWait in Java code, after initialization of spawned array (all elements are false since array is initialized to false, except the set line).\n\nWait in Fortran code:\n\nAfter allocations, first the spawned array is all false (default initialization for logical is .false.), no need to assign.\n\nBut then the line in Java was spawned[size-1] = true. So in Fortran:\n\nspawned(size-1) = .true.\n\nBut the Java code did this before reading the array. In the Fortran code, after allocations of S and spawned, this line would set the element to true before reading into S array. Therefore the Fortran code must proceed that way as per the Java code.\n\nThen, proceed to read S array elements. So after setting spawned(size-1)=true, then reading the array.\n\nThus, the code now has:\n\nprogram atcoderABC\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, size_val, i, current, next_val\n\n! Arrays:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: S(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: spawned(:)\ninteger, allocatable :: active(:)\n\n    read(*,*) N\n\n    size_val = 2**N\n\n    ! Allocate arrays\n    allocate(S(0:size_val-1), spawned(0:size_val-1), source = 0)\n\n    ! Wait source not needed for allocation (defaults, but initialized correctly?)\n\n    ! But spawning the last position (S's last element before read):\n\n    spawned(size_val-1) = .true.\n\n    ! Read the elements of S:\n\n    do i=0, size_val-1\n        read(*,*) S(i)\n    end do\n\n    ! Now sort S in increasing order\n\n    call sort(S)   ! requires that S is a rank-1 array of integers.\n\n    !***\u904e\u3054\u3059***\n\n    !*** Now set the first active element:\n\n    ! Initialize active list with S(size_val-1) (the largest element)\n\n    allocate(active(1))\n\n    active(1) = S(size_val-1) \n\n    !*** Wait but the JavaScript code used an ArrayList. The code is similar here, but in Fortran, maybe we need to use dynamic array and track size.\n\nBut need to manage the active list size. The ArrayList in java can dynamically grow and sort.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps the best way is to use a dynamic array for active, and keep track of the current size. Perhaps even better to do so.\n\nThus, here's the plan for the active list:\n\nInitialize active as a dynamic array. When adding elements, reallocate if necessary.\n\nWait alternatively, in the first step, the active starts with 1 element.\n\nThen in each iteration of N (for (int i=0; i < N; i++)), the code sorts the active list in reverse order (descending), then processes each element, and builds a new list (activated) to collect the new elements, which are then added to active.\n\nAlternatively, in the current code:\n\nAfter the mainSort loop, the loop for i in 0 to N-1:\n\nFor each iteration:\n\n    active is sorted in reverse order (so descending).\n\n    Then, for each 'slime' in active:\n\n        while (next >=0 ...) \n\nThen the code in Fortran must:\n\n1. Sort the active array in descending order.\n\n2. Create an activated array.\n\n3. Find next element.\n\nIn Fortran, the active array must be re-ordered in each step.\n\nThe challenge is managing the dynamic array sizes.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use dynamic arrays for active.\n\nAlternatively, use a resizing array.\n\nCommon in fortran 90, one approach is to allocate arrays with sufficient size, but since the problem constraints are up to N being maybe up to 20 (since 2^20 is million, but perhaps competition problems may have N limited), but with N=20, the active array might be needing to have length up to something like double each time. Wait the original code's loop is N steps, and each step the active array may double in size (since for each element, adding a new one?), but I need to see:\n\nThe original java code's loop works as:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < N; i++) {\n\n        active.sort(Collections.reverseOrder()); // sorts active in descending.\n\n        List<Integer> activated = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        int next = size -1; \n\n        for (int slime : active) {\n\n            while (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])) {\n\n                next--;\n\n            }\n\n            if (next <0)  ... \n\n            spawned[next] = true;\n\n            activated.add(S[next]);\n\n        }\n\n        active.addAll(activated); // appends the activated list to active\n\n    }\n\nSo per iteration, the size of active can increase by the same number of its current elements.\n\nFor example, starting from 1:\n\nFirst iteration: active.size() becomes 1 + activated.size(). Activated has as many elements as active's previous size (possibly 1?), but not sure.\n\nAnyway, for N steps, the size could grow exponentially, so with N steps, up to 2^N.\n\nThus, for large N, but for 20 steps, size becomes 2^20 which is 1million, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible active size is 2^N. \n\nWait because in first step: active has elements ... ?\n\nWait let's think the initial active is 1 element (size 1).\n\nLoop iteration 0:\n\n in first iteration (i=0):\n\n    sort active (size 1) descending (no change).\n\n    next = size -1 ( the index of S where now it's sorted).\n\n    then process the active's first element (slime = S[size_val-1], the max element).\n\n    then loop 'while (next >=0 and (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next]) )\n\n        The S array is in ascending order.\n\n        S[next] is size_val-1? Let me think:\n\n    S before any spawned:\n\n    The S is sorted ascending, so S[0] is minimum, S[size-1] is maximum.\n\n    spawned array was initialized with:\n\n    In the Java code, before the read, the spawned[size-1] (unsorted's position) was set true. \n\n    But after sorting, S's elements have changed indices. \n\n    Wait, what the code does after sorting is the spawned array's indices correspond to the original indices of the S array before it was read; so after sorting, the current S elements are reordered but the indices in spawned have nothing to do with that.\n\nThis is confusing me, but need to proceed.\n\nBack to the january loop:\n\nFor each slime in active:\n\n    while ( next >=0 and ( S[next] >= slime || spawned[next] ) )\n\n        then decrement next.\n\n    As long as S[next] is >= the current slime (the player is looking for a smaller slime?), but spawned must be unspawned.\n\nWait, the while loop finds next where S[next] < slime and not spawned.\n\nWait the condition:\n\nwhile (next >=0 && (S[next] >= slime || spawned[next])).\n\nAs long as S[next] is >= slime or already spawned, we need to move to smaller indices (starting from next originally set to size-1? Wait in Java the next variable starts as size-1 each time? Or each time it loops through the for loop? \n\nWait in Java's code:\n\nfor ( int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n\n            active is sorted in reverse order (descending).\n\n            then, \n\n            List <... has:\n\n            List<Integer> activated = new ArrayList<>();\n\n            int next = size-1; \n\n            for (int slime : active) {\n\n                while (next >=0 ... \n\n                                next--;\n\n                if (next <0 ... ) \n\n                //enter new state\n\n            }\n\n            }\n\nThus, for each iteration of the for each (for each slime in active), the 'next' is initialized at size-1, but then decremented?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait>\n\nWait the code for the 'next' is:\n\nWithin the loop for each slime in active:\n\nLoop over active in sorted order after the sort. \n\nThen:\n\nNext is initiated to \"size-1\" (the max index, which corresponds to the largest element in S (which is at index size-1).\n\nWait for each slime (from largest to smallest?), since the active was sorted in reverseOrder (descending). \n\nFor each slime in active (sorted descending), the nested loop starts at next = size-1 (the last element of S array, which is max element, then looks for next which is the first S[next] < slime, and not spawned.\n\nBut since slime is in the active list, which (in this iteration), presumably came from the previous steps.\n\nHmm.\n\nThe while loop: do the first two conditions:\n\nwhile ( next >=0 and ( S[next] is >= slime's value, or the spawned[next] is already true (so taken))\n\nWe want to navigate to indices where S[next] < slime and spawned[next] is false (i.e., can be used now.)\n\nThus, this moves next backward to find the first such position.\n\nOnce such a position is found (if any), the next is kept at that position, then spawned is set to true for that index.\n\nThen, added to activated list.\n\nThen, next is not reset for the next slime in the active list? Wait, the next is found for the specific slime.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nfor (slime : active ){\n\n    while ( next >=0 && ... ){\n\nThe initial next is size-1.\n\nWait but that's problematic, because the very first time, when next starts at size-1, then S[next] (the max element) will likely be >= slime (since slime is taken from active, which contains the max element). So the condition S[next] >= slime (since it's equal) will trigger the loop to decrement next.\n\nWait in the first iteration:\n\n active has [S(size-1)], which was the first element added. \n\n when we are in the first loop (i=0):\n\nactive has the largest S element. \n\nThen, the loop for active (sorted descendingly):\n\n so \"slime\" is S[size-1].\n\n next is size-1.\n\n Now evaluating while ( next >=0 && (S[next] >=slime || spawned[next])) \n\n since S[next] (S[size-1]) is equal to slime (since slime is S[size-1], and S is in ascending order), so S[next] >=slime is true --> loop continues.\n\n thus next-- becomes size-2.\n\nNow check again: S[size-2] ?\n\n Which is the second highest element in the sorted array. \n\n We then proceed until next reaches a point where S[next] < slime (the slime is the former max element).\n\n Thus, since slime is the max, all S[next] values from next's decrease until next reaches some position where S[next] < S[size-1] (the largest). So the \"found next\" will eventually be the second largest (the next appropriate one?) \n\nWait wait the S array is sorted in ascending order so S[size-1] is largest. So all elements before next (when moving down from next = size-1) would be S[next] = S[size-2] (the second largest) is less than. Wait no, the array is ascending so each element is larger than previous ones? No ascending means S[0] <= ... < S[size-1]. Thus, S[next], where next starts at size-1, then decrementing next, the S values are descending as next moves towards 0.\n\nThus, for slime being S[size-1], the first S[next] that less than slime is S[size-2], which is less than.\n\nThus, the while loop would eventually decrement next to size-2, then check conditions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe condition is S[next] >= slime (slime is the biggest) --> S[next] must be bigger than slime: impossible. Thus the first condition S[next] >=slike would be false. Wait S[next] where next is size-1 is exactly equal to slime's value. Thus the first condition is S[next] >=slike (equal: yes), thus triggers the loop.\n\n thus, moving next down to size-2:\n\n then check S[size-2] >= slime? No, because it's less. \n\n Thus exit loop. \n\n So next is at size-2. \n\n Is spawned[next] (size-2) true? \n\n Until now, only spawned[size-1] was true (initialized earlier).\n\nThus, no: spawned[size-2] is false. \n\n Thus the condition S[next] >= slime is false, and spawned is false: thus the loop breaks.\n\n So code proceeds.\n\n So spawns next (size-2) as true, and adds S[size-2] (next's value) to activated.\n\nThus, for this first slime (the biggest), it takes next = size-2.\n\nThus, the activated list contains this second element.\n\nThen, after procecssing all slimes (in the first iteration of the outer loop, there's just one slime), activated is size 1.\n\n Thus, active will be the original active array plus activated array, so length 2.\n\n And proceed to next iterations.\n\n Thus the process continues.\n\n Now, getting back to translating this into Fortran.\n\nThe main loop for i in 0 to N-1.\n\nThe first main difference is handling the active array which is dynamic growing list.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe'll need to have an array and a counter for the active's current length.\n\nThe variables:\n\nDeclare active_array as an array of integers, with a size that we can increase as needed. Maybe start with a buffer that can grow.\n\nAlternatively, each time, after adding elements, reallocate the array.\n\nIn fortran, to manage the active array:\n\nInitially, after initialization, active has [ S(size_val-1) ]\n\nWe can store the active in a 1D array, along with the current active count (number of elements stored).\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: active(:)\n\ninteger :: active_count = 1\n\nThen, when starting:\n\nactive(1) = S(size_val-1)\n\nWait but initially:\n\nallocate( active(1) )\n\nactive(1) = val.\n\nThen, in each loop iteration:\n\nSort the active array in reverse order (descending).\n\nThen, for each element in active (now sorted descending), process.\n\nNeed to do a few steps:\n\nFirst, to sort the active array in reverse order (descending).\n\nFor that, can use a temporary array and sort, then copy back.\n\nAlternatively, use a custom sorting routine.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, since it's rank-1, can sort in reverse:\n\ncall sort(s(1:active_count), dim=1, key(... ?)\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, create a descending array copy.\n\nAnother approach: \n\ncopy active into a temporary array, then sort in reverse and store again.\n\nHere's the plan for each loop iteration:\n\nAllocate a new array for the new activated elements, and also the sorted active.\n\nBut since loop iterations can occur N times, and the arrays can grow exponentially, it might be better to manage it properly.\n\nAlternatively, in each iteration:\n\n1. Sort active in descending order.\n\nTo sort, can do:\n\ncall sort(active(1:active_count)) will sort in ascending order. To sort in descending order, can sort then reverse.\n\ncall sort(temp array from active) in ascending and then reverse.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ninteger :: temp(active_count)\n temp = active(1:active_count)\n call sort(temp)\n\n then reverse the temp array.\n\nthen, active is now temp[::-1] ( Fortran uses 1-based orders):\n\n so do i=1, active_count\n\n        active_sorted(i) = temp(active_count+1 -i)\n\n to make descending.\n\nSo, that's one way.\n\n2. Then, iterate through each element in the active_sorted (the active array sorted in descending order), keeping track of the length (active_count).\n\n3. For each \"slime\" in active_sorted:\n\n   we need to find the next starting from size_val-1 downwards.\n\n    int next = size_val -1\n\n    loop:\n\n     while next >=0 and ( S(next) >= slime or spawned(next) is true)\n\n         next = next-1\n\n    exit loop\n\n    if next <0:\n\n     print \"No\" quit\n\n    else:\n\n        set spawned(next) = true\n\n        add to activated list (the new array)\n\nThus, the 'next' is shared among all the slimes in this active? Or per-slime? Well in Java code, next is a variable that's reset per iteration of the outer loop: each for the 'i' loop's inside, next is initialized to size-1 at the beginning of processing each 'i' loop iteration.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n    sorted active.\n\n    then, create activated list as empty.\n\n    set next= size-1 (so start at the end of the S array)\n\n    then for each slime in the active (descending):\n\n        while ... \n\n    thus, the 'next' variable starts at size-1 each time.\n\n Thus each iteration of the main loop (i) has a fresh 'next' variable reset to size-1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus in the Fortran loop:\n\nFor each of the N iterations:\n\n1. allocate temporary array for sorted and process.\n\n2. create activated list (array) to collect new elements.\n\n3. initialize 'next' variable as size-1 (the upper bound index).\n\n4. iterate over each element of the active list (now in descending order).\n\nWait confusing to track.\n\nLet's try to outline the steps in code variables.\n\nThe variables in Fortran:\n\nactive has current_count elements.\n\nactive_count is the current number of elements in 'active'\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo iter = 1,N    ? \n\nBut wait N steps, so loop over do i=0, N-1.\n\nBut in code:\n\n loop over i in 0 to N-1:\n\n   first, sort active in descending order.\n\nThen, process each element:\n\n   then, create activated array as empty.\n\n   next_val = size_val-1\n\n   do j =1, active_count  ! assuming the active is sorted in descending order (sorted in temp array)\n\n        current_slime = active_sorted(j)\n\n        do while ( next_val >=0 .and. (  S(next_val) >= current_slime  .OR. spawned(next_val) ) )\n\n            next_val = next_val -1\n\n        end do\n\n        if ( next_val < 0) then\n\n           print *, \"No\"\n\n           stop\n\n        end if\n\n        spawned(next_val) = .true.\n\n        (store the S(next_val) in the activated list)\n\n   end do\n\n   ... add these activated elements to active.\n\nThus, the activated list is to be appended to active array.\n\nThus, after processing each active element in the sorted list:\n\n Need to store the activated elements.\n\n Thus, the 'activated' list in fortran is another array, with its own count.\n\nThus:\n\ntrack activated_count =0\n\nallocate activated(0:active_count)  &c.\n\nBut to track:\n\nLet's try:\n\n Inside the main loop (for each of N steps):\n\n active has active_count elements. (unsorted, but in next steps need to sort it in descending first)\n\ntemp array for sorted active in descending order: \n\nallocate temp(1:active_count)\n\n do i=1,active_count\n\n     temp(i) = active(i)\n\n end do\n\ncall sort(temp) --> sorts in ascending.\n\n then reverse it:\n\n do i=1,active_count\n\n     temp2(i) = temp(active_count+1 -i)\n\n     or build it directly.\n\nThen, the sorted_desc array is temp2.\n\nBut perhaps better to compute the reversed sorted array.\n\nAlternatively, this can be handled via a custom loop.\n\nAlternatively, temporarily reversed.\n\nOnce the sorted_desc is built, then:\n\nthe processing for each slime in this array.\n\nThe 'next_val' is initialized to size_val-1.\n\n activated is an array where we collect entries needed.\n\nThus:\n\nallocate activated(activated_max_size ... no, need a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can use another temporary array with a maximum size of active_count elements (since each active element requires one activation element).\n\nSo let me proceed step by step:\n\nInside each i iteration of N loops:\n\nstep:\n\n    !1. sort active in descending:\n \n !Get the active array sorted in descending order into an array desc_active.\n\n ! temporary storage for active elements.\n\n    integer, allocatable :: desc_active(:)\n\n    allocate( desc_acvive(1:active_count) )\n\n    do j=1, active_count\n\n    desc_active(j) = active(j)\n\n    end do\n\n    call sort( desc_active(1:active_count) ) ! sorts ascending, then reverse.\n\n do k=1,active_count\n\n     temp_value = desc_active(k)\n\n     temp_store(active_count+1 -k) = temp_value \n\n so this is tedious. Or use simple loop.\n\n    write(*,*) \"Need to reverse the sorted array.\"\n\nAlternatively, to sort in reverse order, invert the comparison.\n\nIt might be simpler to call the sort and then reverse the array.\n\n    call sort(desc_active)\n\n    do j=1,active_count\n\n        temp_desc(j) = desc_active(active_count +1 -j)\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Now temp_desc contains the sorted in descending order.\n\nWait maybe better to avoid this complexity. For the purpose of this code, perhaps use:\n\n  the 'slime elements must be processed in the current active's descending sorted order.\n\n thus, using:\n\n To get active in reverse:\n\n first sort in ascending order.\n\n then copy into a new array in reverse.\n\nSo temp_active_sorted is the reversed array.\n\n Alternatively, simply sort in descending in code.\n\n Thus, perhaps:\n\n    desc_active = active\n\n    call msort desc_acvtive(-1:i to make descending. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write a custom quicksort for descending order.\n\nHmm this introduces extra work, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, just proceed with the algorithm using the ascending sort and then the reversing loop.\n\nWell, assuming that we have the sorted in descending array into desc_active:\n\nNow:\n\nthen activated_count=0 \n\nallocate activated_array(1:1) ? \n\nAlternatively, allocate activated to size active_count (maximum possible additions).\n\nallocated activated(1:active_count)\n\nactivated_count=0\n\nnext_val = size_val-1\n\n do j=1, active_count \n\n    current_slime = desc_active(j)\n\n    do while ( next_val >=0 .and. ( S(next_val) >= current_slime .or. spawned(next_val) ) )\n\n        next_val = next_val -1\n\n    end do\n\n    if (next_val <0 ) then\n\n        print *, \"No\"\n\n        stop\n\n    end if\n\n    ! mark spawned, and collect the value.\n\n    spawned(next_val) = .true.\n\n    activated_count = activated_count+1\n\n    activated(activated_count) = S(next_val)\n\n    next_val = next_val -1\n\n end do  ! j loop\n\n    ! Now, need to add these to active.\n\n    ! The new active is old active plus activated elements.\n\n    ! so old active has active_count elements, new active will have active_count + activated_count elements.\n\n    ! create a new array, allocate.\n\nThe new_active array:\n\n    integer allocate new_active(1:active_count+activated_count)\n\n    new_active(1:active_count) = active(1:active_count)\n\n    new_active(active_count+1:active_count+activated_count) = activated(1:activated_count)\n\n    deallocate(active)\n\n    active => new_active\n\n    active_count = active_count + activated_count \n\n    deallocate(desc_active, activated) etc.\n\n   >\n\nThis is quite involved.\n\nBut to implement the dynamic arrays.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 90, using allocated arrays:\n\n after the processing of each current slime, the activated array is built as a temporary array.\n\nBut the key task here is the 'next_val' which is shared among all the slimes in the same iteration (i loop), but for each slime starting from the previous next_val's position.\n\nWait no, in java code:\n\nWait for each slime in active_sorted (descending order), the 'next_val' is starting from size_val-1 each iteration's beginning.\n\n Wait the next_val variable start at size_val-1 in each loop of the i's iteration, and then for each slime, the loop  scans down.\n\n thus each slime starts the 'while' loop at the next_val's current value.\n\n thus the 'next_val's value continues from the previous iteration.\n\nWait no. In the java code:\n\nThe 'next' variable is initialized to  size-1 at the start of the for(elt: active) loop in the current iteration's i step.\n\nSo:\n\nLoop for i:\n\n   ... \n\n   next = size-1 \n\n   for each slime in active (sorted descending):\n\n       while next ... conditions\n\n          next--\n\n       ... \n\nThus, the 'next' starts at size-1 for first element, but after the first elements processing, next is now potentially moved backward, and for the next elements, 'next' starts from that lower position.\n\nThis is important - The next_val for each slime in the iteration is searching from before where previous found it.\n\n Thus, this is sequential search decrementing from initial next (size-1) down, finding for each slime the next possible 'next_val' position.\n\n Thus, the 'next_val' value is shared across all the 'slime' loop iterations in this i's loop.\n\n Thus, the next_val moves downward and becomes 'locked' at some point.\n\nThus, in the code translation, 'next_val' is initialized per i's loop.\n\n Thus, the code steps inside the i's loop are:\n\n   // Inside the loop per i:\n\n   next_val is initialized to size_val-1\n\n   activated_count =0 \n\n   allocate a storage for activated elements.\n\n   do j from 1 to active_count (processing each slime in the current active in desc order):\n\n       current_slime = ...\n\n       while ( next_val >=0 && (S(next_val) >= current_slime or spawned[next_val]))\n\n          next_val = next_val -1\n\n       if ( next_val <0) ... \n\n       ... etc\n\n Thus this is the key.\n\nThus in Fortran code, during the i loop:\n\n  next_val = size_val -1 \n\n  then loop over j to process each element in desc_array.\n\nThus moving next_val accordingly.\n\nThus, proceeding with the Fortran code:\n\nThis is quite involved. Let me attempt to sketch the code block.\n\nHere's a step-by-step pseudo-code:\n\nprogram ABC \n\nimplicit none\n\n integer :: N, size_val, i, next_val, current_slime, current_activated_count, new_count\n\n integer,allocatable :: S(:), spawned(:), active(:)\n\n integer,allocatable :: temp_active_sorted(:), activated(:)\n\n \n\n!

However, after the S array is sorted, the S indices are now referenced in the ascending sorted array. Thus, the spawned array's indices are indeed indices into the S array after sorting. \n\nBecause in the code:\n\nAfterSort:\n\n    the S array is sorted in ascending order.\n\n thus the code's logic is sound, even with the previous faulty step of setting spawned before the read.\n\nWait spawned was initialized before reading the array's elements. \n\nBUT, after the elements are sorted, the S array's indices are now in the sorted position, so when we access\tS[next_val], it refers to the value at position (sorted array's index).\n\nBut spawned(next_val) refers to the original index?\n\nThus that's the main error, but the user's provided Java code does it that way. Thus, in fortran code, we follow the same logic.\n\n Thus, the code's logic is correct in terms of the problem's intentions, even if has some confusion between indices.\n\nThus, continuing.\n\n Now, considering that the code must proceed like what the java does.\n\nIn the initial code:\n\n spawned[] is declared with size=size_val (0 based).\n\n spawned(size_val -1) is set to T before reading elements of S array.\n\n then, after reading, sorted S into increasing order.\n\n the code proceeds.\n\n thus when accessing S[next_val], it's the sorted array's value at next_val (which may or may not correspond to the original' array's element at that index).\n\n but the spawned array's indices are of the original array's indices. So the 'spawned' array is keyed by the indices of the original array. however, the S array is re-sorted. thus when the code refers to S[next_val], it's taking the value at the new index (sorted array's next_val-th entry).\n\n but the spawned array tracks whether the original's index is spawned.\n\n thus, the problematic indices are intertwined between the original array and the sorted array. but this is what the code does.\n\n but in the problem's context, perhaps the indices are not related. The logic may require tracking whether a particular element (regardless of index) can be used.\n\n but the code defines elements in the sorted array and tracks their indices as original indices.\n\n This is perhaps an error in the original code, but I has to translate \"as is\".\n\n thus in fortran code, the arrays are:\n\n spawned(0: size_val-1).\n\n to make it match the Java code.\n\nThus the fortran code's code must proceed as outlined.\n\nFinally, the End of code would print 'Yes' if all N loops pass.\n\n thus, after all the loops finish normally, print 'Yes' and exit.\n\nThus, after coding all these steps.\n\n Now, code must be careful with indices and array allocations and deallocations.\n\nPotential error points:\n\n- Array allocation sizes: e.g., temp arrays must be allocated.\n\n- when reallocation new_active array must handle the previous elements.\n\n- handling the loop indices correctly.\n\nNow, moving to writing the actual Fortran code.\n\n(Note: Using the free-form Fortran 90+ syntax.)\n\nThe complete code would look something like this:\n\nprogram ABCF140_F\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, size_val, i, ierr\n\ninteger, allocatable :: S(:), spawned(:), active(:), temp_active_sorted(:), activated(:)\ninteger :: active_count, next_val, current_activated_count, new_count, current_slime\n\nread(*,*) N\nsize_val = 2**N\n\n!

Here lies a mistake.\n\n The current logic of the code's loop may have an error. Because during the processing:\n\n The 'active' array is the \"old active\", stored in \"temp_active_sorted\".\n\n Thus, to create the new active array:\n\nnew_active = [previous active array] + [activated elements]\n\nor \"previous active array\" is \"active\" before this loop iteration.\n\n thus the previous \"active\" array stored in \"temp_active_sorted\" ?\n\n No:\n\n The code's \"active\" array stored in \"temp_active_sorted\" contains the elements of the active array before sorting (but then sorted and processed).\n\n thus, perhaps the logic is :\n\n The new active is \"active\" plus \"activated\".\n\n The \"active\" array is the original array. However, in the code, after processing each iteration:\n\n The previous \"active\" is the array we started with.\n\n after the current loop iteration:\n\n the new \"active\" array must be the old active array elements plus the activated's elements.\n\nThus in code:\n\n new_active(1:active_count) = active(1:active_count) \n\n new_active(active_count+1: new_count) = activated(1:current_activated_count)\n\n then replace active.\n\n Thus the mistake in the previous sketch:\n\n The code above used temp_active_sorted (which is a copy of the active array (previous)), which was re-sorted.\n\n thus the previous elements are stored in temp_acvtive_sorted (but sorted in ascending).\n\n but the code's new \"active\" needs all the previous elements plus the new added elements.\n\n Thus, the previous \"active\" elements (unordered) can be retained?\n\n Wait no, the \"active\" array previous is represented by the active array before entering the loop.\n\n thus the previous \"active\" array is:\n\n active(1:active_count).\n\n Thus, when merging, it is necessary to keep the original elements.\n\n \u56e0\u6b64 the new array should be previous active elements plus the activated elements.\n\n Thus:\n\n The new_count is active_count + current_activated_count.\n\n then, the new array will be:\n\n new_active has the old active elements (so active(1:active_count)), and then appeneded with the activated.\n\nThus in the Fortran code block:\n\n Old active is still stored in the \"active\" array before we changed it.\n\n thus:\n\n allocate( new_active(1:new_count) )\n\n new_active(1:active_count) = active(1:active_count)\n\n new_active( active_count+1 : new_count ) = activated(1:current_activated_count )\n\n then, deallocate active, and assign active = new_active etc.\n\n To achieve this, in the code:\n\n after the processing of current loop:\n\n new_count = active_count + current_activated_count\n\n allocate ( new_active(1:new_count )\n\n new_active(1:active_count) = active(1:active_count)   ! Here, active not replaced yet.\n\n new_active(active_count+1: new_count) = activated(1:current_activated_count)\n\n \n\nNow,  update:\n\n deallocate( active )\n\n allocate( active(1:new_count) )\n\n active = new_active(1:new_count)\n\n deallocate(new_active) \n\nThus in the coding.\n\nNow, in the code's previous attempt (my earlier draft), it was wrong to use 'temp_active_sorted'.\n\nThus, the correct approach must use the previous 'active' array's elements, not the sorted one.\n\nThus the mistake in the earlier code:\n\n the JavaScript code used the 'active' list as the collection, and the new elements are added via active.addAll(activated).\n\n thus The new active array is old_active plus activated's elements.\n\n the old_active is the current active array (before processing this i loop iteration).\n\n Thus in Fortran:\n\n The new array is the previous active plus the activated elements.\n\n Thus the error in the earlier draft was handling this as temp_active_sorted, but actually, we must keep the previous active elements.\n\n to make it clear, inside the main loop:\n\n1. make a copy of current active array elements.\n\n2. sort them , but the new array to build is not dependent on the sorted active (except the processing orders the \"slime\" processing).\n\nThus the processing loop (the inner loop with j) is:\n\n process all elements in the active array in descending order.\n\n the active's previous elements are part of the new active array.\n\n the addition is simply appending the new elements.\n\n hence the code fragment inside the main loop should be:\n\n \n\n  ...\n\n   allocate( temp\\Active(1:active_count) )\n\n   temp_active(1:active_count) = active(1:active_count)\n\n  ... \n\n \u7136\u800c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981, \u56e0\u4e3a new_active\u53ea\u9700\u5408\u5e76 active and activated.\n\n thus the correct approach is:\n\n \u5728 the loop:\n\n\u5904\u7406\u7b2c i\u8f6e\u65f6\uff1a\n\n- \u5148\u5bf9 active\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u9006\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd old_active array\uff09\n\n the processing just need the elements of current active array to determine the ordering of processed slime,\u4f46\u539f active array\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u65b0 Active array\u4e2d.\n\n thus:\n\n the new_active is constructed as:\n\n\u4fdd\u7559\u539f active\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09,\u7136\u540e\u52a0\u5165 activated elements.\n\n the order of the new_Active is irrrelevant until next iteration's sort.\n\n hence the code can be omit \u6e05\u55ae\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9 new_active's ordering\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd, because the next iteration will sort it again.\n\n\u56e0\u6b64, \u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u5982\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c:\n\n in the main loop:\n\n the new_active is simply:\n\n old elements + activated elements.\n\n but the way the Java code handles the active's\u6392\u5e8f is only used for processing the slime\u987a\u5e8f, but the elements are kept in the active array for the next iterate.\n\n hence the correct code must:\n\n the new_active beneath has:\n\n old elements followed by new elements.\n\n thus the correct code\u8fdb\u884c this would be:\n\n \n\nwithin the main loop:\n\n current_count = active_count\n\n new_count needed is current_count\u52a0\u4e0a activated_count.\n\n\u4e8e\u662f:\n\n allocate ( new_active Array ) \n\n\u65b0 array contains old elements and added elements.\n\n \n\nThus, the corrected Fortran code for this part is:\n\n \n\ndo Iloop=1,N\n\n    !
