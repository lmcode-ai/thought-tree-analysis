    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main class reads input from the user, counts the number of names starting with M, A, R, C, H, and then calculates the number of possible triplets (combinations of three different groups) from these counts. The result is printed out.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses a Scanner for input and PrintWriter for output. In Fortran, I/O is typically handled with read and write statements. Since the problem requires reading multiple inputs, I can read them in a loop.\n\nThe TaskC class has a solve method. Let's see how to structure this in Fortran. The main program will probably handle the I/O, and maybe a module or a subroutine for the logic.\n\nThe key variables in Java are an integer n and an array cnt of 5 longs. In Fortran, arrays are declared with specific sizes, so I'll have a 5-element array. The counts will be integers (or integers of a larger size? Since n can be up to a certain size, but for the problem constraints, integers might suffice.)\n\nIn the loop over n inputs, each string is read, and the first character is checked. So in Fortran, I need to read each string, maybe using a character array. The first character is the first element, so checking its value (M, A, R, C, H).\n\nThen, the calculation for res is the sum of all combinations of three different elements from the cnt array except those with same indices. So all triplets of indices (i,j,k) where i<j<k would be combinations. Alternatively, the given expression expands all possible triplets (but not all permutations). Wait, looking back, the given Java code computes terms like cnt0*cnt1*cnt2, cnt0*cnt1*cnt3 etc. It's covering all possible triplets among the five elements except those with the same indices? Wait no, actually, each term is a product of three distinct elements. Wait, let me see: how many terms are there? For 5 elements, selecting any 3 distinct elements, the number of combinations is C(5,3)=10, and indeed the sum has 10 terms. So the formula is the sum over all combinations of three different indices from 0-4 multiplied together.\n\nTherefore in Fortran, I need to compute all 10 combinations. Let me note the list of terms as per the Java code:\n\nThe terms are:\n\n0,1,2 (all)\n0,1,3\n0,1,4\n0,2,3\n0,2,4\n0,3,4\n1,2,3\n1,2,4\n1,3,4\n2,3,4\n\nYes, that's the list.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran:\n\nSince Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but the problem uses 0-based in Java. But in Fortran, it's easier to use 1-based. Wait, but the array indices in Java are from 0 to4. So in Fortran, perhaps we can adjust the array to 1-5 so indices match, but that's not necessary. Alternatively, shift indices by 1.\n\nWait, the code counts the first character: M corresponds to index 0 in Java's cnt array. So in Fortran, if I use an array from 1 to 5 (indices 1-5), or maybe 0 to 4 (but Fortran arrays can be declared with a lower bound of 0? Wait, in Fortran, the default is 1, but you can specify lower bounds. So maybe use, for example, a 5-element array starting at 0:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:4) :: cnt\n\nBut some people might think it easier to start at 1. Alternatively, reindex the letters to 1-5. Not a big deal. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the main program structure:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC089_C\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger, dimension(5) :: cnt ! indices 1 to 5, where 1=M, 2=A, etc No, wait, need to see which letters map to which positions.\n\nWait the Java code has:\n\nThe cnt array's indices are 0 (M), 1(A), 2(R),3(C),4(H). Because in the code:\n\nif first char is 'M' -> cnt[0]++, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, it's better to use 1-based array. So maybe create an array with 5 elements, where position 1 corresponds to M (like Java's 0), position2 to A (Java's 1) etc. So the indices are shifted by +1.\n\nSo:\n\ncnt has 5 elements, indices 1-5 for M,A,R,C,H.\n\nSo the first line of code in solve method is reading n. Then initializing cnt to zero.\n\nWait, Java does:\n\nlong[] cnt = new long[5];\nArrays.fill(cnt, 0);\n\nIn Fortran, declare the array as an integer array (since counts might be big? Well, Java uses long but for codeforces/AOJ/AtCoder problems, the constraints may not require 64-bit integers. But if the count could be up to 1e5, multiplying three might need up to 1e15, which is over 2^32 (which is around 4e9). So integers in Fortran need to be 64-bit. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger(8) :: cnt(5), res\n\nSo using integers with 8 bytes (64-bit) would be better.\n\nNow, initializing the array:\n\nIn Java, initialized to zero. In Fortran, after declaration, we can set each element to zero, perhaps with a loop.\n\ncnt = 0\n\nmight work, but to be safe, since all are initially zero, perhaps that's enough. ALlocate?\n\nNo, since fixed size.\n\nNow, loops:\n\nRead n strings. For each, read the string, check first character, increment cnt accordingly.\n\nIn Fortran, reading strings can be done with a character variable. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: str\n\nsince the problem likely has strings with length up to, say, 10? But since we only need the first character, even if longer, just take the first character.\n\nThus, within the loop:\n\nread(*,*) str\ncharacter(1) :: first_char\nfirst_char = str(1:1)\n\nThen, check which character:\n\nif (first_char == 'M') then\n cnt(1) = cnt(1)+1\nelse if (first_char == 'A') then\n cnt(2)=...\nelse if 'R' \u2192 cnt(3), 'C'\u21924; 'H'\u21925. Else, not part of any of the counts (so ignored).\n\nBut the problem says only those starting with M, A, R, C, H contribute to the count. Others can be ignored.\n\nWait, the problem statement? Let me see the problem: the original problem (since it's called ABC089_C) probably counts the letters MARCH subjects, so each entry is a name starting with one of those letters. So if a name doesn't start with any of those, it's not counted. So in code, increment the respective count only for those first characters.\n\nTherefore in the loop:\n\nLoop over n times.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nread *, n\ncnt = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n  read(*, '(A)') str ! since the string can have varying lengths\n  first_char = str(1:1)\n  select case (first_char)\n    case('M')\n      cnt(1) = cnt(1)+1\n    case('A')\n      cnt(2) = cnt(2)+1\n    case('R')\n      cnt(3)=cnt(3)+1\n    case('C')\n      cnt(4)=cnt(4)+1\n    case('H')\n      cnt(5)=cnt(5)+1\n    case default\n      continue ! do nothing\n  end select\nend do\n\nThen, compute the sum of all combinations of 3 counts. The expression in Java had all possible triples. So the same terms as in the Java code's res.\n\nThe calculation for res:\n\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + ... etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the code in Java wrote all the combinations explicitly, in Fortran we can do the same.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nres = 0\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + ...\nWait, better to compute each term and add all the terms.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + &\n      & cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + &\n      & cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5) + &\n      & cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n      & cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + &\n      & cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n      & cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + &\n      & cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + &\n      & cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + &\n      & cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nThen, output res.\n\nNow, variable declarations: Let's structure the program.\n\nPROGRAM main\nIMPLICIT NONE\nINTEGER(8) :: cnt(5), res\nINTEGER :: n, i\nCHARACTER(LEN=10) :: str\nCHARACTER(LEN=1) :: first_char\n\n! Read n\nREAD*, n\ncnt = 0\nDO i=1, n\n   READ(*,'(A)') str\n   first_char = str(1:1)\n   SELECT CASE( first_char )\n      CASE ('M')\n         cnt(1) = cnt(1)+1\n      CASE ('A')\n         cnt(2)=cnt(2)+1\n      CASE ('R')\n         cnt(3)=cnt(3)+1\n      CASE ('C')\n         cnt(4) = cnt(4)+1\n      CASE ('H')\n         cnt(5) = cnt(5)+1\n      CASE DEFAULT\n         ! Do nothing\n   END SELECT\nEND DO\n\nres = cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(5) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(1)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(1)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(4) + cnt(2)*cnt(3)*cnt(5) + cnt(2)*cnt(4)*cnt(5) + cnt(3)*cnt(4)*cnt(5)\n\nWRITE(*,*) res\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be read with varying length, but using a fixed-length buffer may be problematic if input strings longer than 10. To avoid that, perhaps using an unlimited length string or something. However, in practice, since only the first character is needed, maybe using a length of 1 would suffice? Wait, no. Because if you read a string with a length of 10, even if the input is longer, Fortran reads the first few characters. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps better to read the entire line except for the first character. Alternatively, read the first character as a scalar character variable.\n\nAlternatively, read into a single character variable. Since first character is needed, perhaps better read the first character:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read the first character only, but Fortran's READ may be tricky for that. Let me think:\n\nAnother approach: using a character(1) variable and reading the first character only.\n\nBut in Fortran, the input can be read as a character variable of length 1, but how to read it?\n\nWait, perhaps read the entire first word as a variable of length 1. But that may cause errors if the word is longer. Wait, the code in Java used in.next(), which reads the next token. In Fortran, if we can read the first token as a character array of, say, at least first character, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, read each string as a character array of length\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8db3\u591f ( sufficiency?), but likely, in code submission, the strings input can have arbitrary length, but we just need the first character. So to be safe, perhaps declaring STR as a character of length, say, 20 would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, use list-directed input (`read(*,*) str`), which for a character variable will read the first token, but if the string is longer than the declared length, it will be truncated. However, the first character won't be affected.\n\nBut in that case, even if the entire string is read, as long as the first character is accessible.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nUse a character variable with length 1.\n\nBut when read(*,*) reads a string, and the variable is a single-character, then it would read first character?\n\nNo. Wait, in Fortran:\n\nThe input is reading strings separated by white spaces. The first word is read as the entire string, but when stored in a 1-char variable, the read will only store the first character (assuming the word is not empty). But perhaps better to read the entire string first and then take the first character.\n\nHence, the way I have in the code above should work, using a CHAR array of some sufficient length (like 10) to hold the first token, then take first character.\n\nBut the problem may have strings longer than 10 characters. So perhaps set it to 200?\n\nAlternatively, let's set the length to 1. Since all we need is the first character:\n\nIf using a character*(1) str:\n\nBut then read(*,*) str would read one character? Not exactly. Believe list-directed input would process each input token, but each token is separated by whitespace, so when using a character(1) variable, perhaps it would read the first character of the next input word, then the rest of the word is left in the input stream, which might be problematic.\n\nNo that's not correct. Because in such case, if I have a character*1 variable in list-directed input, then it will read the first character of the next token (the next \"word\"), leaving the remaining characters for further reads, which can cause problems.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the next read would not skip over the rest of the token, leading the input to be out of sync.\n\nThus, perhaps need to read the entire string (the entire next \"word\"), so that the rest of the token is consumed correctly.\n\nHence, the variable to store the string should be large enough to hold the longest possible \"word\" (since we don't know). Well, problem constraints: for this particular problem, maybe the strings can be up to, say, 10 characters, but let's set it to a longer length.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line.\n\nAnother approach is to read everything into a character variable with sufficient length. For example, 1000 characters would be large enough.\n\nAlternatively, read until end of line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to read using a fixed length of, say, 100 characters for each input string. Let's choose 100.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: str\n\nThis would ensure that even if the input string is long (but within reasonable), it gets read properly, and the first character is accessible.\n\nTherefore, modifying the code to read as 100 length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even ignoring the rest of the string. Since only the first character is needed, perhaps the rest can be buffered without issues.\n\nThus, the code's read handling should be okay.\n\nNow, testing the Fortran code logic.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase when n <3: then the answer is 0.\n\nSuppose n is 2, and all counts are 1 each. Then any triplet requires 3 elements, so res is 0. So that works.\n\nAnother test case: suppose three of the letters: say 1 M, 1 A, 1 R. Then the first term (1*1*1) is part of the sum, so res is 1.\n\nOther terms are zero, so total is 1? Wait the first term is cnt[1]*cnt[2]*cnt[3], which is 1*1*1=1. The rest are zero, so total is 1, yes.\n\nWhich would be correct, because choosing one M, one A, and one R \u2192 exactly one way.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are two of one letter and one of another, but only three letters. But let me see.\n\nAnother test case: n=5 with 1 each. Then each cnt(i)=1 for all 5 indices. Then the total combinations of three would be 5C3 = 10, each with product 1. So total 10. Which is what the code computes, since there are 10 terms each contributing 1, so yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran code variables:\n\nMake sure the array is declared with 5 elements as integers(8) to handle large multiplications. Variables cnt are initialized to zero. Then read n, loop n times. Then compute all terms.\n\nThe code looks okay. The only possible issues are:\n\n1. Input reading's character length.\n\nIf in the programming contest problem, the first character is the only one relevant, then the code using len=100 for the string should be okay.\n\nAnother potential issue: the order in which the indices are used. Let me check:\n\nOriginal Java's cnt had M as index0, A as 1, R as 2, C as3, H as4. The Fortran code uses indices 1-5 for M/A/R/C/H. Thus, in the formula, the terms correspond correctly. Like the first term is cnt[0] * cnt[1] * cnt[2] in Java, which becomes cnt(1)*cnt(2)*cnt(3) in Fortran. Exactly as in the first term of the formula.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother possible problem is using 8-byte integers. In the code, variables res and cnt are declared as integer(8), but need to ensure that when multiplied, there's no overflow. However, in programming competition contexts, the problem usually ensures that the product fits in a 64-bit integer. So this should be okay.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work."
