    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the original code does. \n\nLooking at the Java code: it's a console application. The main function first reads an integer n. If n is 1, it prints \"Hello World\". If n is not 1 (specifically 2 in this case, since the else clause takes 2 inputs), it reads two more lines, converts them to integers, adds them, and prints the sum. \n\nThe read method in Java uses a BufferedReader to read lines from standard input. The read method takes a length and returns an array of Strings of that length. There's also a close method for closing the BufferedReader.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about the steps needed for Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, input/output is handled differently. We usually read from the standard input unit, which is unit 5 by default. We don't have classes, so variables are just variables. The structure of the program would be a main program, no classes.\n\nThe first step is to read the integer n. Then decide the path. If n is 1, print \"Hello World\". Else, read two integers, add, and print.\n\nWait, but in Java's case, when n is 1, it reads 1 line (the n itself?), or wait, looking back at the Java code: the read(1) is called. The read function is used to read len lines. Wait, in the main method, n is parsed from read(1)[0]. So the read function reads 1 line, splits into an array with one element, so read(1) returns an array of length 1, first element is that line. So the n is the first line of input. \n\nThen, when n is 1, the code just prints \"Hello World\". When it's not (like 2), then read(2) is called, which reads two lines, those two are the numbers to add. \n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read the first input as n. Then check if n is 1, so output \"Hello World\". Else, read two integers and add them, then output the sum.\n\nIn Fortran, to read from standard input, we can use read(*,*) or read(unit=5, ...). \n\nWait, but in the Java code, the read function is handling reading lines. The Java code's read method uses a BufferedReader, and reads lines one by one. So each call to read(len) returns len lines as an array. So for the first case, when n is 1, they read 1 line, but that's just the value of n. Wait, no: in Java's code, n is obtained as read(1)[0], converted to integer. So the first input line is the n. \n\nSo, in Fortran, the steps should be:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. If n equals 1, output \"Hello World\".\n\n3. Else, read two more integers, add them, and output the sum.\n\nTherefore, the code structure is straightforward for Fortran.\n\nSo, the Fortran code can be structured as:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc112_a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, a, b\n  character(len=20) :: line\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  if (n == 1) then\n     print *, \"Hello World\"\n  else\n     read(*,*) a\n     read(*,*) b\n     print *, a + b\n  end if\n\nend program atcoder_abc112_a\n\nWait a second. Wait, in Java, when n is 2, they read two lines, right? Because in the Java code's read(2), which is two lines. So in that else clause, the code expects two lines of input after the initial n. Therefore the code for n=2 after the first line is to read two lines, parse them as integers, then add them. \n\nSo in Fortran, that's indeed how it would work. The above code does exactly that.\n\nWait the Java code in the else case does:\n\nString[] strs = read(2); // which gets 2 lines.\n\nThen, strs[0] is the first line, strs[1] the second line. Then converting them to integers and adding. So in Fortran, same thing: two read statements to get a and b from two lines.\n\nYes, so the Fortran code I wrote above should be correct.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read with read(*,*) a, if the input is, say, \"123\", then it's okay, but if the input is \"  123 \" (whitespace), it's handled. Since the input could have leading/trailing whitespaces, but the read will skip them.\n\nTherefore that should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, they read lines with readLine(), so each line is exactly the whole line. But when using Java's Integer.parseInt, it only parses the entire string as a number, so each line must be a valid integer. So in Fortran, the same holds: the input lines must contain an integer. If the input line is something else, like alphabets, the program will get an error.\n\nTherefore the Fortran translation should be as above. \n\nWait, but in the original code, when n=2, it reads two numbers from two lines. So in Fortran, after reading n, the else branch does read two numbers, each in their own line.\n\nWait, the read(*,*) a will read until it finds the next integer, but if inputs are given with newlines between, that's okay. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n2\n\n5\n\n-3\n\nThen, n is 2. Then read the next line (5) into a, next into b, then a+b is 2. The code correctly outputs 2.\n\nAlternatively, if inputs are given in the same line, like:\n\n2 5 6 \n\nThen n is read as 2 (since first read(*,*) will read the first value, then the next read would read 5, and then 6 from the rest, but that's a problem because the Java code expects separate lines. Wait hold on, this is a crux point I need to think about.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the way the input is read is using readLine() for each call. So each call to br.readLine() reads a full line. Thus:\n\nScenario: the code expects first the number n (first line). Then when n is 2, two more lines (input line 2 and line 3). So in Fortran, the read statements after n are reading each from a line.\n\nIn Fortran, when you have read(*,*) a: that will read the next value from the input. So if inputs are given as three lines:\n\n2\n\n5\n\n3\n\nthen each read statement will read from the next line. \n\nBut if the input is all on a single line, for instance, like:\n\n2 5 3 \n\nThen the read for a would take 5, then read for b would take 3, but that's correct for n=2. But in the problem's context, perhaps the user is expected to input each number on its own line?\n\nHmm the problem that the code is solving, probably from AtCoder ABC112_A, perhaps?\n\nChecking the problem statement for ABC112 A: Let me recall. \n\nProblem statement for ABC112 A is: \n\n\"Hello World or Sum\"\n\nThe problem says: You will be given an integer N. When N=1, output \"Hello World\". When N=2, read two integers a and b, and output their sum.\n\nAh, right. So when N is 1, we just need to print \"Hello World\". When N is 2, two integers are given in the next two lines.\n\nSo in Java's code's logic: \n\nThe first input is n, then if n==1, print. else, read two lines (so two separate lines), parse those.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to read the first integer n. Then when N is 2: two reads, each reading one integer from the next line respectively.\n\nTherefore, the code above is correct. Let's see.\n\nWait, but in Fortran's read(*,*) a, the * format reads free format, so it uses whitespace separators, but each time the read will read the next variable from the current input. So if the input is given as three lines:\n\nFirst line: 2\n\nSecond line: 5\n\nThird line: 6\n\nThen first read(*,*),n reads 2. Then the else block: first read for a will read line 2 (5), then read for b reads line 3 (6). \n\nThat works.\n\nAlternatively, if all inputs are on one line: \"2\", then next line \"5 6\"\u2014Wait, then after reading n as 2, the next read would read 5, and the next read would read 6. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, if someone inputs \"2 5\" as the first line, then the second read (for a) would take 5, but then third read (for b) would have to read next line (third), which may be empty. But according to the problem's condition, when N is 2, two numbers will be provided. So the code can assume that the user provides inputs properly, as per problem's requirement.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but Fortran uses implicit typing. Wait, in the code I wrote, I included 'implicit none', which is good practice. Variables n, a, b are declared as integers. The character variable 'line' isn't necessary in my original code. Wait, why did I include that?\n\nWait, looking back, no, in the code I thought of, there's a variable line which is unnecessary. Oh, that's a mistake. Wait in the code I wrote above, there is a line declared. Wait that's a mistake. Let me see: \n\nWait the first version I thought of had:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc112_a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, a, b\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  if (n ==1) then\n    print *, 'Hello World'\n  else\n    read (*,*) a\n    read (*,*) b\n    print *, a +b\n  end if\n\nend program\n\nSo that would be the correct version. The line variable wasn't needed. \n\nI had mistakenly added a character variable in my first draft. Probably because I thought there was a problem, but no. \n\nWait, in the initial thought process I considered that, but then realized the variables are correctly declared. So the code is okay.\n\nTherefore, the correct Fortran translation is as written, without that unnecessary line variable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc112_a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, a, b\n\n  read *, n\n  if (n == 1) then\n     print *, \"Hello World\"\n  else\n     read *, a\n     read *, b\n     print *, a + b\n  end if\n\nend program atcoder_abc112_a\n\nWait, but in some Fortran versions, the read statement can be written as read(*,*) or read *, which is equivalent. The form without parentheses is also acceptable, perhaps.\n\nWait the original code uses read(*,*) n. But maybe in free form, you can write read *, n. \n\nWait, let me check syntax.\n\nIn modern Fortran, the syntax is \n\nread (unit, format) variable\n\nBut when using * as format, it's free format.\n\nThe parentheses are required. So the correct way is:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nBut in some versions, writing read *, n is also okay?\n\nHmm, depending on spaces. I think in Fortran, the read *, n is acceptable. So either way.\n\nTherefore, the code is okay as written.\n\nWait, in my example above, perhaps I missed the spaces. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal code I wrote had:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the intrinsic types correctly. Oh, integers are okay.\n\nSo this should be the translation.\n\nI don't see any other parts. The original Java code's read method uses a BufferedReader, and closes it at the end. But in Fortran, since it's reading from standard input, there's no need to close, as the program exits.\n\nThus, the code should work as intended."
