    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to convert this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. It looks like it's solving some graph problem, probably related to counting the number of bipartite or non-bipartite components and calculating a total based on that. \n\nFirst, looking at the main structure: the Java class has a run method which runs some logic involving reading input, building a graph, then processing each connected component. The main method starts it as a thread, but Fortran doesn't really handle threads in the same way, but the question is about the code translation, so perhaps the main part is just the main program logic. Since threads in Java are for multi-threading and the problem's solution probably is single-threaded, maybe the Fortran code will just ignore the threading part except for the actual processing.\n\nLet me list the key components in Java:\n\n- The graph is an array of ArrayList<Integer>s. In Fortran, an array of lists can be a bit tricky, but perhaps we can use a linked list or fixed-size arrays. Alternatively, since the adjacency lists can vary per node, using a dynamic array might be an issue. But Fortran is more static. Maybe using a list of edges represented as a list, but in Fortran 90+, we have allocatable arrays. Alternatively, adjacency lists can be stored as lists stored in arrays. Hmm. The standard way is maybe to use an array of dynamically allocated arrays for each node. Let's think: each node has a list of its adjacent nodes. So for n nodes, each node's adjacency list can be stored as an array that can be dynamically sized.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can have a derived type for the node's adjacency list, perhaps using pointers. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe a more straightforward way is possible. Let me think of how to represent the graph in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can pre-allocate a large array and track the edges. Wait but since the code reads m edges, the total number of edges is 2*m (since each edge is added twice, u to v and v to u). So maybe:\n\nInstead of using an ArrayList<ArrayList<int>>, since in Fortran you can have a different approach. Perhaps we can have an array of lists. In Fortran, you could have a list implemented with integer arrays, where each node's adjacency list is stored starting at a certain index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use a list of nodes' adjacents stored in an array. Like, using the standard adjacency list method as integers stored in a big array, and have pointers indicating where each node starts. But this might be more efficient but complicates code. Alternatively, perhaps use linked lists, but that's complicated in Fortran. Maybe since Fortran doesn't have built-in dynamic lists, the easiest approach would be to use an array where for each node i, its adjacents are stored in an array. For example:\n\nWe can have an array, for each node, the adjacency list is stored in a block. To do that, perhaps first count the number of edges for each node, then allocate each adjacency list's size, and store them as a 2D array with a start and end index. But maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, considering that in the Java code, the graph is an array of ArrayLists. Each time adding an edge to both nodes u and v. So, the adjacency list for each node is dynamic. In Fortran, perhaps best to read all edges first, store each adjacency list in an array, using dynamically allocated arrays for each node's list. \n\nAlternatively, since Fortran 90 allows allocatable arrays, perhaps we can create an array of pointers to arrays. The graph can be a 1D array of pointers to integer arrays, but that's getting into non-standard technique, perhaps via the Fortran 2003 features. Alternatively, perhaps use an array of integers where for each node the list is stored as a list, but how?\n\nAlternatively, given that Fortran's Fortran 90 and later has allocatable arrays, maybe we can pre-allocate a sufficiently large array, but not sure. Alternatively, let me think step-by-step:\n\nThe Java code for building the graph is:\n\nfor (i=0 to m-1 steps):\n   read u and v, subtract 1 (assuming input 1-based to Java's 0-based)\n   graph[u].add(v); graph[v].add(u).\n\nSo for each edge between u and v, both directions. So each node's adjacency list is the list of its connected nodes.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps the approach can be:\n\n1. Read all the edges first, track the length of each adjacency list, then allocate, then build the lists.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read m edges, each consisting of u and v (probably 1-based in the input, so we'll subtract 1 to get Java's indices, which are 0-based.) \n\nFirst, for counting the size of each adjacency list:\n\nInitialize an array counts for each node, initialized to 0. Then for each of the m edges, increment counts[u] and counts[v]. Then, we will have the size of each adjacency list. \n\nThen, allocate arrays for each node:\n\nThe graph can be represented as an array of allocatable integer arrays. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can't have an array of pointers (unless using dynamic types), but can use an array of integer arrays, each with their size determined. The standard way is maybe to use an array of dynamically allocated arrays.\n\nFirst, let's see:\n\nType declaration: \n\nperhaps in Fortran code:\n\ntype :: Node\n  integer, allocatable :: adj(:)\nend type Node\n\ntype(Node), dimension(:), allocatable :: graph\n\nthen after calculating the counts per node, you can allocate each graph(i)%adj with the size equal to counts(i). \n\nThis might be possible.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nBut let me first think the overall structure of the fortran code.\n\nSo the main part will read n and m, then build the graph.\n\nThen, proceed with visited and color arrays.\n\nThe DFS function in Java is a recursive function. But in Fortran, recursion can sometimes be an issue, but for the purposes of translation, we can implement the recursive calls as in Java. Fortran allows recursion, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in some versions or compiler settings it might need enabled, but since the translation is needed, perhaps proceed with recursion.\n\nThe variables:\n\n- graph: The adjacency lists.\n\n- visited: boolean array.\n\n- color: integer array (initialized to -1)\n\n- one, bipartite, count are long integers (in Java, integers, but in fortran, perhaps using integer*8 or whatever, but let's see).\n\nOther variables: mujun (a boolean flag). But since in the DFS function, it's modifying this variable in the outer scope?\n\nWait, in Java, the \"mujun\" variable is a class variable, which the dfs() function is setting. So, in fortran, the variables will have to be either module-level or passed to the function as an argument with ability to modify.\n\nWait, the Java code has \"this.mujun = true\" in the DFS function. So in Fortran, the equivalent variables (one, bipartite, count, mujun) would have to be available in the scope of the DFS function. If in a module, perhaps they can be module variables. Alternatively, if structured as a subroutine for the DFS, then those variables can be passed by reference or pointer.\n\nHmm, this might complicate things. Let's think about how to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the variables like one, bipartite, count, mujun, etc. are global variables in the Java code, so in Fortran they can be placed in a module or as local to a program's main block, but Fortran's subroutines can access these variables only if they are in common blocks, or in the same scope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to have a main program that holds the variables, and the DFS is a recursive subroutine that modifies them.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the structure step by step.\n\nIn Java, the variables are instance variables of the class atcoder_AGC011_C, so in fortran's main program, those can be global variables (declared as variables in the main program).\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps the main program contains all the variables (graph, visited, color, etc), and the DFS function is a recursive function that can access these variables, provided proper declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to pass these variables as arguments to DFS, but in that case, passing the graph, visited etc. might be tedious, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Fortran the procedure can be an internal subroutine, and thus have access to the variables. \n\nLet me start structuring the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables to declare in the main program.\n\nWe'll need:\n\ninteger, parameter :: n, m\n\nWait no; n and m are read from input. So variables declared as integers.\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: graph(:)\n\nWait no, for adjacency lists, perhaps better to use the type approach.\n\nLet me think of declaring the graph as a type which includes an array.\n\nSo first, define a node type.\n\ntype :: node_type\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: adj\nend type node_type\n\nthen the graph is an array of node_type: type(node_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: graph\n\nThen, for the code:\n\nFirst part: read n and m.\n\nThen allocate graph(n):\n\nallocate( graph(n) )\n\nthen set counts for each node.\n\nFirst, read all edges:\n\ninteger :: u, v, i\n\nallocate an array counts of size n, initialized to zero:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: counts\nallocate( counts(n) )\ncounts = 0\n\nthen loop over m edges.\n\ndo i = 1, m\n   read *, u, v\n   ! since input is probably 1-based, subtract 1 to get 0-based (like Java)\n   u = u - 1\n   v = v - 1\n   counts(u+1) = counts(u+1) + 1\n   counts(v+1) = counts(v+1) + 1\nend do\n\n(Note that in fortran, array indices start at 1 unless specified otherwise, so node indices 0 in Java would need to be stored at 1 in fortran? Hmm, perhaps the variables are 1-based here. Maybe better to keep as 0-based with fortran arrays starting from 1, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe just re-implement the indices as 1-based since fortran arrays are 1-based unless declared with lower bounds. So perhaps the nodes are numbered 1..n in the code. Maybe the original code in Java used 0-based, so in fortran, the code will need to match that with arrays using 0-based indices. Wait no, fortran requires explicit start and end. To handle 0-based indices, you can use array(0:n-1) by declaring with bounds, like dimension(n) starting at 0, but this can be done.\n\nWait, in fortran, declaring a array as follows:\n\ndimension(n), kind= etc. but you can't have an array starting at 0 without explicit allocation.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to have nodes numbered 1 to n, so when converting from java's 0-based, subtract or add 1 as needed.\n\nWait the original code in java does:\n\n   u = scan.nextInt() -1 \n\nso input is supposed to be 1-based? So perhaps the code needs to treat numbers as 1-based in input, then internally uses them as 0-based. \n\nBut in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based, so when converting, perhaps:\n\nJava's nodes 0 to n-1 can be stored as elements 1 to n in fortran arrays, but the actual value can stay as input minus 1, so that the nodes are stored as (u.Green's input becomes node%id = u_in -1, stored as fortran's 1-based array indices?)\n\nHmm perhaps it's easier to have array indices start at 0 in fortran by using the 'dimension(N,1)' but that might complicate. \n\nAlternatively, just proceed with 1-based indices, and adjust the calculations accordingly.\n\nSo let's proceed with nodes numbered 1 to n, so that the code can use 1-based internally. So for example, if input u is 1 (Java's 0-based would be 0, but probably the problem is in 1-based?), no, wait the problem's input edge nodes are probably 1-based, so in Java they subtract 1 to get 0-based.\n\nThus, in fortran, when you read u and v, you can store them into 1-based variables. Wait no, better to read into integers, then subtract 1. So:\n\nSuppose:\n\ninteger :: u_input, v_input \n\nread *, u_input, v_input \n\nthen u = u_input -1, v = v_input -1 (but in fortran, node 0 is allowed if arrays are declared as 0-based. For this to work, need to have arrays declared as lower bound 0, but that's possible.)\n\nSo, for example, declare graph of size n in nodes, starting from 0.\n\nWait, in fortran, to have an array starting from 0, you can declare it as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0: n-1) :: visited \n\nor similarly for other arrays.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to have arrays be 0-based to match Java.\n\nTherefore, in the code, all arrays should have lower bounds at 0, so for n nodes, they are 0 to n-1.\n\nTo do this in fortran:\n\nFor counts (previously mentioned):\n\nallocate(counts, source=0, ...). Hmm, but for 0-based, the counts array will be 0-based.\n\nSimilarly, the nodes are 0 to n-1, so in the code:\n\nFirst, read n and m (Fortran reads into variables, say, n and m).\n\nThen, initialize counts(0..n-1) to zero.\n\nloop over m edges:\n\nfor each edge:\n\nread u_input, v_input (for fortran, input numbers are 1-based as in Java, so u is u_input -1, so in code:\n\nu = u_input -1\n\nv = v_input -1\n\nthen, for the adjacency lists, each edge adds v to u's list, and u to v's list.\n\nSo to do that:\n\nfirst, need to calculate the size of each adjacency list (for each node).\n\nTherefore, counts array as before. (counts(u) +=1; counts(v) +=1 for each edge).\n\nAfter all edges are read, we can allocate each node's adjacency list.\n\nThen, read the edges again, this time to fill the adjacency lists.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in my previous approach, I first need to know the adjacency list sizes, so first read every edge once, record the counts, allocate each's space, and then read edges again to put them into the arrays. That would be inefficient but possible. Alternatively, read all edges into storage (like a temp array), then process twice. Hmm that may be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a two-pass approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of counting first, just pre-allocate arrays with m edges per node (but that would be bad for memory). Alternatively, a better approach is to first read all edges, store in a temporary list, then build from there.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nRead all edges into two separate arrays (for the edges):\n\nFirst, read all m edges into two arrays, for u and v, list. Then:\n\n- allocate counts array as zeros.\n\nThen compute counts:\n\ndo i = 1 to m:\n\n   temp_u = edges_u(i) (stored as the actual u index (0-based?)\n\n   counts(temp_u) = counts(temp_u) + 1\n\n   temp_v = edges_v(i)\n\n   counts(temp_v) +=1\n\nThen after that, allocate the adjacency lists for each node, and finally loop again over all edges and add the entries. This would need more temp arrays but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use a list structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edge lists can be built incrementally.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps use the following steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nAllocate an array for counts: counts(0:n-1) = 0.\n\nAllocate another array for the edges:\n\ninteger, dimension(2, m) :: edges\n\nloop m times:\n\n   read u_int, v_int \n\n   u = u_int-1; v=v_int-1\n\n   edges(1,i) = u; edges(2,i)=v \n\nthen compute counts:\n\ndo i=1, m \n\n   counts(edges(1,i))= counts +1 \n\n   counts(edges(2,i)) = counts +1 \n\nenddo\n\nthen, with counts known, allocate each graph's adj array for each node:\n\nso:\n\nallocate graph(0:n-1) as the type array. Wait, no:\n\nWait the graph is an array of node types. Each node_type has an allocatable integer array for adj.\n\nso:\n\ndo j = 0 to n-1 \n\n   allocate (graph(j)%adj(counts(j)) ) \n\nenddo \n\nThen, reset counts (or have another array) to track current position for each node's adj list.\n\nWait, to fill the nodes' adjacency lists:\n\nreset counts (assuming counts is used as the counters for next positions):\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: pointers \n\npointers = 0\n\nloop over m edges again:\n\nfor each edge i (original loop):\n\n   u=edges(1,i), v=edges(2,i)\n\n   append v to u's adj list:\n\n   graph(u)%adj(pointers(u)+1) = v\n\n   pointers(u) = pointers(u) +1\n\n   do the same for the reverse edge:\n\n   append u to v's adj list:\n\n   graph(v)%adj( pointers(v) + 1 ) = u \n\n   pointers(v) = pointers(v)+1\n\nHmm this might work, but requires careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Perhaps I can rework all the steps:\n\nOnce we have counts for each node, we can go through edges in the edges array, and for each edge between u and v, append v to u's adj list, and u to v's adj list. \n\nAh right, so for building the adjacency list, suppose:\n\nAfter preallocating each adj array's size to counts(j), then proceed to loop through each edge, and for each edge (u, v), we can add v to adj[u]'s next available position, and similarly a to v's adj. \n\nBut how to track where to insert next? We can use pointers array, starting at 1 for each (since lists start at 1 for fortran).\n\nWait with the initial counts, the pointers are initialized to 0. So each time we add to adj list:\n\ngraph(u)%adj( pointers(u) +1 ) = v\n\nThen pointers(u) +=1. So pointers record the current size.\n\nBut for nodes, the max size is already known, which was counts(j). Because each edge contributes to both directions, each adj list's size is correct.\n\nYes, this works. \n\nOk, now, setting up all this in code.\n\nNow, the visited node array:\n\nlogical, dimension(0:n-1) :: visited \n\ncolor as integer, same dims:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: color\n\ninitialized to -1, so color = -1\n\nvariables:\n\ninteger :: one, bipartite, count\n\nlogical :: mujun \n\nThese variables start at zero or false.\n\nBut in Fortran, integers can't be initialized during declaration with an initial value directly. So:\n\nTherefore, after declaring them, they can be set to 0 with one = 0, etc.\n\nNow, the main processing loop:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n\n   if (visited(i)) cycle\n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   mujun = .false.\n\n   ... call dfs on node i, with initial color 0 (since Java's function is dfs(int a, int c) with c is color)\n\n      the dfs function should return the total number of nodes in the component.\n\nWait in the Java code, the dfs returns an int (the size of the component). Also, the function sets the mujun flag if there is a bipartition issue.\n\nThe return value is the size of the component.\n\nWait in Java's DFS code:\n\nThe function returns the total nodes in the component. So the returned 'kind' is the size of the component.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the DFS routine must return an integer (the total). Additionally, the variables :- one, bipartite, color, visited, and mujun may be set/modeled.\n\nWait, but the variables like mujun (boolean) is set inside the DFS function. So in Fortran's version, since the variables are in the main program's scope, the DFS will modify them as needed. But subroutines in Fortran can have access to them through the global variables, or, should be passed by reference.\n\nHmm. \n\nThe main approach is the code structure in Fortran:\n\nstructure:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, u_input, v_input, u, v\n\n    ! declare variables:\n\n    type node_type\n        integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: adj\n    end type node_type\n\n    type(node_type), dimension(0:), allocatable :: graph\n\n    logical, dimension(0:) :: visited\n\n    integer, dimension(0:) :: color\n\n    integer :: one=0, bipartite=0, count=0\n\n    logical :: mujun\n\n    ... read input n,m...\n\n    ... read edges, build graph ...\n\n    ... initialize visited, color etc., then loop over each node ...\n\nBut let's think of the steps in code:\n\nFirst Steps in Main program:\n\nread *, n, m\n\nallocate the graph array:\n\nallocate( graph(0:N-1) )\n\nallocate counts array (0:N-1)\n\nthen read edges into a temporary structure:\n\nallocate edges(2, m)\n\nthen loop to load edges, etc.\n\nNow, after building the adjacency lists.\n\nLoop over all nodes to visit them if not visited:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n\n   if (visited(i)) cycle\n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   mujun = .false.\n\n   kind = dfs(i, 0)\n\n   if (kind ==1) then\n\n      one = one +1 \n\n   else if (.not. mujun) then\n\n      bipartite +=1 \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nThen compute total:\n\ntotal = ... \n\nprint *, total \n\nNow, the dfs routine. \n\nThis is a recursive subroutine.\n\nThe DFS function in Java:\n\nint dfs(int a, int c) {\n\n   if (visited[a]) {\n\n      if (color[a] > =0 && ! (color[a] == c)) { mujun = true }\n\n      return 0;\n\n   }\n\n   visited[a] = true;\n\n   color[a] = c;\n\n   int total =1 \n\n   for ( all b in graph[a] ) {\n\n      total += dfs(b, 1-c)\n\n   }\n\n   return total;\n\n}\n\nIn fortran, the recursive subroutine must be able to access the graph, visited, color, etc.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the subroutine can be written as:\n\nrecursive function dfs(a, c) result(total)\n\n  integer, intent(in) :: a, c\n\n  integer :: total, b, i, temp\n\n  \n\n  logical :: is_visited = visited(a)\n\n  if (is_visited) then\n\n     if (color(a) >=0 .and. color(a) /=c) then \n\n        mujun = .true.\n\n        return 0\n\n     end if \n\n     dfs =0 \n\n     return \n\n  end if \n\n  visited(a) = .true.\n\n  color(a) = c \n\n  total =1 \n\n  do i=1, size(graph(a)%adj) \n\n     b = graph(a)%adj(i) \n\n     temp = dfs(b, 1 -c )\n\n     total = total + temp \n\n  end do \n\n  dfs = total \n\nend function dfs\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions can be recursive, but in practice, perhaps using a subroutine and returning the value via an argument. Alternatively, this may require explicit imports, but perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, Fortran allows functions to be recursive. So yes, a function style dfsmethod will work here.\n\nHowever, variables like visited and others are global in the program, so the dfs function can access them.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n1) The visited array is accessed via the main program's variable, so the function must have access to it. \n\nSince the function is inside the program (or declared in a separate module), this can be accommodated.\n\n2) The color array similarly is available in the main program's scope.\n\n3) muun flag: a local variable? Or a program variable.\n\nIn the Java code, mujun is an instance variable of the class, so in the fortran code, the main program's variable is the mujun. \n\nThus, using the Fortran dfs function as I described above should access the variables correctly, as long as they are in the same scope.\n\nBut need to make sure that the function is declared with implicit access. However, in Fortran, when the variables are in the 'containing scope' of the function. \n\nIn a program, all variables declared in the program's specification part are accessible to internal functions or subroutines. \n\nYes. So if the dfs function is declared within a program, it can reference visited, color, etc. \n\nSo the code can work.\n\nNow, some details:\n\nThe parameter check in the DFS:\n\nif color is not equal to c, and already visited, set mujun to .true. and return 0.\n\nBut the code must NOT add the \"kind\" (or any count) in this case, because that would be an existing node in the same component and conflicting color.\n\nWait in the java code, in the 'visited' case where the color does not match,\n\nit just return 0.\n\nHence in fortran, the code proceeds similarly.\n\nNow, what about the types:\n\nIn Java, the DFS returns an integer (number of nodes in the component). The recursive summing works correctly in Fortran.\n\nNow, all variables:\n\nVariables in the Main:\n\nvariables:\n\ngraph: array of node_type with adj lists.\n\nvisited: logical array (0-based)\n\ncolor: integer array, initialized to -1.\n\none, bipartite, count are integers.\n\nmujun is logical.\n\nNow, when performing the loop for each node (i):\n\nWe have:\n\nAfter calling dfs(...), the returned value (integer) is the total node count in that component.\n\nThe variables:\n\n   if kind (returned from DFS) ==1, it's a single-node component. So one counts it.\n\nElse, if the component is bipartitioned without conflict (mujun is .false. after the DFS), then it's counted in bipartite.\n\nElse, (mujun is true) the component is 'mujun' (conflict) but not counted in either.\n\n Wait the code in Java's legacy is:\n\nif (kind ==1) one++ \n\nelse if (!muun) bipart +=1 \n\nElse (it's a non-bipartitioned component, but how does it handle here?)\n\nThe problem says, but perhaps the problem is calculated the total as a combination where:\n\none * (2n - one) ) + (count-of-non-bipart-single?) Well the code's formula needs to be correctly followed.\n\nThe code's final computation is:\n\ntotal = one * (2*N - one) \n\n + (count - one) * (count - one) \n\n + bipartite * bipartite \n\nHmm.\n\nSo, the one is all the components that have a single node (so connected component size 1). \n\nThe count is the total number of connected components. So (count - one) is components which have more than one node, but which are not bipartitionable (so mujun is true?), or else counts.\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nfor each connected component (each time when visited[i] is unchecked, then the component is counted into count (total components).\n\nThen, after the DFS returns the kind (size of component):\n\nif (kind ==1) --> one +=1 \n\nelse if (!mujun) --> the component is bipartitioned (valid, not mujun). So bipartite +=1.\n\nSo, components with size>1 are either bipartition and counted as bipart, or not and not counted here. \n\nThese non-bipartition components (where mujun is true) are neither counted in bip or in one. \n\nTherefore, The total counts for:\n\none: components of size 1.\n\nbip: components which are bipartitioned (both colored alternately, no conflicts).\n\nothers (count - one - bip) are the non-bipartitioned.\n\nThe final formula is:\n\ntotal = (one * (2n - one)) \n\n + (count - one) squared \n\n + (bip)^2 ?\n\nWait the code says:\n\ntotal = one*(2*N - one) \n\nplus \n\n (count - one)* (count - one) \n\n plus bipartite^2.\n\nWait why?\n\nFirst term: one * (2n - one).\n\n second: (count - one)^2 \n\n third: (bip)^2 ?\n\nSo, the explanation from the problem is probably : \n\neach pair of nodes:\n\nif they are in component of size 1, then the contribution is ... not sure, perhaps it's part of the count of edges required? Or it's in the problem's solution. But the code calculates total as per that formula.\n\nWe just have to translate code as per that, so it should follow as per variables.\n\nSo the other variables: when the code is written properly, since the fortran code should capture the same variables.\n\nNow, the variables are all in place.\n\nPutting all the pieces together.\n\nNow, the main program code needs to be structured.\n\nSo here's a first draft:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, current_node\ninteger :: u_input, v_input\ninteger :: total \n\ntype :: node\n  integer, allocatable :: adj(:)\nend type node\n\ntype(node), allocatable :: graph(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: visited(:)\ninteger, allocatable :: color(:)\ninteger :: one = 0, bipartite =0, count_components =0\nlogical :: mujun \n\n!

When visited, color is set to 0 or 1. So:\n\nif color is set (>=0), and not equal to c (then set muun to true and return 0.\n\nThe code in Fortran's function:\n\n   if ( visited(node) ) then \n\n     if ( color(node) >=0 .and. color(node) /=c ) then \n\n        muun = .true.\n\n     end if \n\n    res =0 \n\n    return \n\n else ... \n\nWait in the code above I have for the condition:\n\nif ( color(node) /= -1 .and. (color(node) .neqv. c) )\n\n.wait, comparing with the color's value.\n\nWait in java, color is an array of integers, initialized to -1. \n\nSo in the DFS function, after the starting node, for each node's neighbor, when revisiting (already visited), if the color is not -1 and not equal to c.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (visited) then:\n\n   if (color(node) != c):\n\n       then set mujun. \n\n     and in any case return 0. \n\nThus, the Fortran code needs to check if color(node) is not equal to -1, and not equal to c.\n\nWait actually, color(node) is >=0 (because when set, it's 0 or 1). \n\nSo in fortran code, the check is:\n\nif ( color(node) > =0 .AND. color(node)/= c )\n\nthen set mujun to true.\n\nBut in any case, the function returns 0 (since it was already visited).\n\nThus, the code should have:\n\n  if ( visited(node) ) then \n\n     if ( color(node ) >=0 ) then \n\n       if ( color(node) /= c ) then \n\n           mujun = .true.\n\n       end if \n\n     end if \n\n     res=0\n\n     return\n\n   end if \n\nBut in the code above written in the function body:\n\nif ( color(node) /= -1 .and. (color(node) .neqv. c ) )\n\nWait the .neqv. is bit-wise exclusive or? No, that\u2019s not correct. \n\nWe need to check if color(node) is not equal to c. \n\nThus, the condition is:\n\nif ( color(node) /= c )\n\n, but since color(node) was already initialized to -1 (hence, if color(node) is not -1 then it's 0 or 1.\n\nHence in code:\n\ninteger :: current_color = color(node) \n\nif (current_color /= -1 ) and (current_color /= c) then \n\n    mujun = .true.\n\nend if \n\nSo the code:\n\nIn the function dfs:\n\n   if ( visited(node) ) then \n       if ( color(node) /= -1 .and. color(node) /= c ) then \n           mujun = .true.\n       end if \n       res=0 \n       return \n   end if \n\nYes that would be correct.\n\n So the earlier code's function implementation had .neqv. which is not correct.\n\nSo the correct condition in FORTRAN is: \n\nif ( color(node) /= -1 .and. (color(node) != c) )\n\nThus, in code:\n\ninteger :: current_color = color(node)\nif ( current_color >=0 .and. current_color /=c ) then \n\n   mujun = .true. \n\nend if \n\nThen set res to zero. \n\nSo correcting that, the DFS function's logic is okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the parameters of the function: 'res' is the returned value. \n\nAlso, the loop in the DFS:\n\nIn the function:\n\n  do i =1, adj_count (size of adj array of the node).\n\nThat is, for each of the adjacents, loop and accumulate.\n\nNow, regarding the 'mujun' flag: it's a logical variable in the main program's scope. So whenever the DFS detects a conflict, it will set mujun to .true., which will remain so until the current component processing completes.\n\nOnce the DFS returns, the 'mujun' is set based on whether a conflict was encountered anywhere in that component. Thus in the loop over components:\n\nif component size is 1 then add to one, \n\nelse if ( mujun is not set (i.e., .false.) then it is bipartition possible \u2192 add to bipartite \n\nElse, it's counted as a non-bipartite (not counted in one or bip rats)\n\nSo the code correctly handles this.\n\nNow, testing for possible errors.\n\nPossible edge cases:\n\n- All nodes are single edges and bipartitioned.\n\n- Some invalid components (which cause mujun to become .true.) \n\nFor example, a triangle (which isn't bipartitioned)\n\nThe code should count that component as not counted in bip, and thus contribute to count_components -one, \n\nwhich participates in the term (count - one)**2.\n\nNow, the final calculation: \n\ntotal = \n\none*(2*n - one) \n\n+ (count -one)^2 \n\n+ bip^2 \n\nThis formula, which in Java the code computes correctly.\n\nThe code in Fortran's statements must make sure that when bipart (++ then the contribution is present.\n\nOther possible problems:\n\nAllocation errors, for example when a node has zero nodes, may cause issues, like an array with size zero. However, in the code, when the graph is built, for a node with no edges, counts(j) =0, so the adj array has length zero. Thus in the DFS function:\n\nWhen looping over adj(adj) of length zero, the loop does not run, so a single-node component of size 1 is correctly counted.\n\nThus, the code should handle that case.\n\nAnother point is that in the case of zero edges (m=0). Then every node is a single-component.\n\nThus, one =n, count=n. \n\nThe bipart would be n - the count_components (count=n). \n\nWait no : if m=0, every node is its own component, so:\n\nFor each of the n components:\n\ncomponent size is 1 \u2192 added to one.\n\nThus, since component size is 1 \u2192 one increments.\n\nThe 'count' would be n.\n\nThe bipart is zero, as all components are size 1 (other cases), so the final total:\n\none*(2n -one) \u2192n*(2n-n)=n\u00b2 \n\nplus (count - one)\u00b2 \u2192Zero \n\nplus bipart^\u00b2 \u21920 \n\nso total n^2.\n\nWhich may be correct.\n\nNow, putting this all together, the fortran code should be:\n\nWait the edge list storage in fortran has some specifics. \n\nThe declaration of edges_list as dimension(2,m), then the read into it.\n\nAs per above.\n\nNow, one other thing: in the function dfs's loop over adjacents:\n\nthe array graph(node)%adj is being used, and traversed.\n\nNow, another possible point is the order of the edges in adj lists, which doesn\u2019t matter, because the order of traversal doesn\u2019t affect the BFS or the count, just the path taken, which is inconsequential for the purpose of the algorithm.\n\nSo, that's okay.\n\nSo, the code as presented should work.\n\nNow, let me write the final code in the box.\n\nI have to make sure:\n\n- All variables are declared.\n\n- The DFS function is inside the Main program, so can access variables.\n\nIn the code, I used the 'contains' block to include the function.\n\nThat way, the function dfs can access the variable.\n\nThus the program's structure.\n\nSo here's the final code:\n\nNow, some corrections in the code:\n\nWait in the DFS function's condition:\n\nthe mujun flag is being set.\n\nThe loop over adjacents uses graph(node)%adj's entire array via i from 1 to size(...).\n\nThe function's signature returns res, which is the accumulated total.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the fortran code should be as written above, but with the corrections mentioned (the condition in the visited case).\n\nThe final functional code should contain all that."
