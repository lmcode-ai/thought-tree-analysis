Thus this code should be correct. Another edge case: when N is divisible by min_val, then (N + min-1)/min_val = N/min \u2192 adding 4 is correct. Example1:\n\nJava code:\n\nSuppose N=10, and next five numbers are 3,2,5,4,1 \u2192 the five are 3,2,5,4,1. So the minimum is 1. Wait no: the five numbers: after reading first 3 \u2192 min is 3. Then next number is 2: becomes min. Then 5: no change (2 is smaller), then 4, no change. Then the last number is 1: new min_val is 1. Then the calculation: ceil(10/1) \u219210, plus4 \u219214.

Wait 9/5 is 1 with remainder 4. Wait 9 /5 is 1.8, but in Fortran integer division (using /) will truncate towards zero, which gives 1. However that's not what I want. Wait wait hold on, that's a problem! Wait my formula (N+min-1)/min: in case where N=5, min=5. Then (5+5-1) =9 \u21929 divided by 5 is 1.8 \u2192 in integer division gives 1 \u2192 then 1 plus4=5.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. \n\nThe Java program reads some numbers from the user. The first number (N) is a long integer. Then it reads 5 more numbers. The first of those five is assigned to min, then the minimum between min and the next ones is calculated each time. Basically, it's finding the minimum value among those five. \n\nAfter that, there's a calculation: Math.ceil(N / min) +4. Then it prints the result. The Math.ceil function is used to round up the division result to the nearest integer, since it's dividing N by the minimum of those 5 integers. Since in the Java code, the variables are long, they can be pretty big. \n\nSo, the program calculates something like the ceiling of N divided by the minimum of five values, added to 4. Hmm. Probably what's going on here is a problem like, given a number N and 5 values, you need to find the minimal time or steps which depends on using the minimal of the 5 after that.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Fortran, input is handled with read statements. Since the code uses a scanner, in Fortran we can use read(*,*) to read from stdin.\n\nLet me see the structure:\n\n- In Java, it reads N first, then five more numbers, tracking the minimum of those 5.\n\n- The loops runs from i=0 to 4 (since the for loop is for 5 iterations).\n\nWait, here's the loop in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <5; i++ ) \n\neach iteration:\n\ni=0: first time, min set to sc.nextLong();\n\nelse: get the current number, set min to the smaller of min and the current number.\n\nSo yes, the five numbers are read one after another, and min keeps the minimum of the last five.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nThen read 5 values, each time keeping track of the minimum.\n\nNext, they compute the ceiling of (N / min). Since in Java it's (double) N/min, which is then ceiling'ed, then add 4.\n\nWait, in the code it's (long)Math.ceil(... ) +4. So ceil part is a cast to long, but since the result is a double, then adding 4.\n\nWait the code's line is p((long)Math.ceil(...) +4); \n\nWait so first, (double)N/min is passed to ceil, which gives the smallest integer not less than that value. Then cast to long, then add 4.\n\nWait why +4? Maybe the problem requires adding 4 for some reason. The code's logic is probably about finding the minimal time steps given some coins or something, so adding 4 might correspond to adding steps. But regardless, the code is straightforward: compute those terms.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me note the steps.\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared with their types. Let's think:\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- N: integer probably large, but in Fortran, integers can be selected for precision. Since Java uses long which is 64-bit, but Fortran has kind selector to specify size. Let's use integer(8) for better compatibility. Wait, but maybe the actual problem constraints don't require that; let's see. The Java code is using long, which is 64-bit, but the problem's constraints may have N up to some big value. In this case, assuming that variables can be up to 1e18 or something, but Fortran's integer can be 8 bytes (64bit) with selected_int_kind.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the numbers don't exceed the standard integer size in the compiler's default, but better to use 64-bit integers. Hmm. Alternatively, in Fortran you can just code them as integers same as the problem expects. Well, for Fortran, I'll use integer(8) for all the variables.\n\nWait, the min variable is a long. So all variables N, min are integers (long in Java), so let's use integer(kind=8) in Fortran.\n\nNow, the min variables: in Java, initially set to the first number. Then for the next four, loop compares the new number to min and keeps the min.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead N.\n\nThen read 5 more numbers, track min.\n\nLet me write the steps:\n\ndeclarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: N, min, a, i\n\nWait, but how to read five numbers. Let me see:\n\ndeclare variables.\n\nFirst, N will be read from input.\n\nThen, we have to read 5 numbers, and find the min among them.\n\nOne approach: first, read the first of the five numbers, assign to min (since that's what the first iteration of Java loop does). Then read the next four numbers and compare each to current min, keep the minimum. Alternatively, maybe read all five into an array, then compute min.\n\nIn Java it's done in a loop, but in Fortran perhaps easier with an array.\n\nBut let's see the Java loop:\n\nThe 5 numbers:\n\nFirst, when i=0, set min to first value.\n\nThen, for each of the remaining values (i from 1 to 4), read the value and take the min between min and the new value.\n\nSo the code reads five numbers in order, each as a single step.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, can read them in an array.\n\nRead (5 numbers), store them in an array, then compute the minimum.\n\nBut I can proceed like in Java. Let's see:\n\nInitialize min to a starting value, but in the code, the first is stored into min, then the next four are compared.\n\nSo:\n\nRead N: read(*,*) N.\n\nthen, do 5 iterations:\n\nFirst variable is read into min. Wait:\n\nWait, first step: read the first of the 5, to assign to min, then the rest.\n\nThen loop 4 more times.\n\nWait, in Fortran, here's a structure:\n\nFirst: read N\n\nthen read the first of next five:\n\nread(*,*) temp\n\nmin = temp\n\nthen a loop from 1 to 4:\n\nloop:\n\nread(*,*) temp1\n\nif (temp1 < min) then\n\n    min = temp1\n\nend if\n\nend loop.\n\nBut perhaps better to loop through the 5 values. Alternatively, using a loop 5 times where first time set min to first value, then the rest compare.\n\nAlternatively, using an array to store the 5 numbers, then get the minimum.\n\nLet's proceed with first method:\n\nIn code:\n\ninteger(8) :: N, min, a\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nmin = a\n\ndo i = 1,4\n\n   read(*,*) a\n\n   if(a < min) min = a\n\nend do\n\nThus that would read 5 values (after N), first becomes min, then next four are used to see if they are lower.\n\nNow, the compute part.\n\nCompute (N / min). But since we need to perform division with ceiling and add 4.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nN divided by min: N/min, cast to double because Java's math operations between integers truncate, so casting to double first.\n\nWait in javas code:\n\n(double)N / min is cast to a double, then Math.ceil() makes it so that (for example) 10/3=3.333 \u2192 ceil \u21924.0.\n\nThen cast to long (so 4), then add 4: 4+4=8? Wait no, in the code it's (long) Math.ceil(...) +4.\n\nWait let me relook:\n\nThe code has a line: p((long) Math.ceil( (double)N / min ) +4);\n\nSo Math.ceil returns a double, cast to long, then added 4.\n\nWait no, the calculation is ceiling(N/min double) cast to long then add 4? Or is it (long) (ceil(...)+4) ?\n\nNo, the code's calculation is: (ceil(...) is a double, cast to long \u2192 which truncates decimal? Wait no, the original code uses Math.ceil(dbl) which since it can return a whole number like 5.0, then (long) would give 5. Then adding 4.\n\nWait for example, if ceil(N / min) =5 \u2192 adding 4 gives 9.\n\nBut let's think:\n\nLet me see, the Java code: Math.ceil((double)N / min) \u2192 say that is 5.0, casting to long gives 5 (because it's just 5.0?), which adding 4 gives 9. \n\nNow in Fortran, we need to replicate that.\n\nSo given N and min (both integers), the formula is: the ceiling of N divided by min, plus 4.\n\nWait: So (ceil(N / min)) +4, but since in Java the division is done via casting to double first to prevent integer division.\n\nBut in Fortran, if I have integers a and b, a / b is integer division (truncated to zero). To get the floating point division, I have to divide them as real numbers. So in Fortran:\n\n(N / min_real) would need N's value divided as real.\n\nWait so the Fortran code would do something like:\n\nresult_value = ceiling( (real(N)/real(min)) ) +4\n\nBut then, since ceiling is needed. Wait, ceiling in Fortran is ceiling function. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the ceiling function takes a real argument and returns an integer.\n\nWait in Fortran 90 or later, ceiling(REAL(N)/REAL(min)) would be correct. Because dividing two integers in real form.\n\nThus, the line would be:\n\ntemp = ceiling( real(N,8) / real(min,8) ) +4\n\nWait, yes: real(N, 8) would cast N and min to double-precision (assuming kind=8 for real variables).\n\nWait the real function in Fortran has kind. If I use real(N, kind=kind(0d0)) to make sure it's double, but maybe better to just cast with real(kind=8). Alternatively ensure that in the code.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger_answer = ceiling( real(N)/real(min) ) +4\n\nWait, but since N and min are of integer(8), when you pass to real, the default kind may be same as min of the integer's kind, but in any case, real division will be precise enough.\n\nAlternatively, we can use another approach, in case precision or integer overflow is an issue when converting, but I think for this code's purpose, it's okay.\n\nAnother approach to compute ceiling(n/min):\n\nThe ceiling of n divided by d is equal to (n + d -1)/d (integer division with discarding remainder). \n\nWait, yes. For example:\n\nIf d divides n, then (n +d-1)/d = (n +d-1)/d = n/d + (d-1)/d \u2192 floor is n/d, ceil also n/d \u2192 but (n +d-1)/d = (n/d) + (d-1)/d \u2192 so no. Wait wait, maybe let's compute with specific examples.\n\nTake n=10, d=3 \u2192 10/3=3.333 \u2192 ceil is 4 \u2192 (10 +3-1)/3 = 12/3=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, d=5 \u2192 (5+5-1)/5= 9/5= 1.8 \u2192 floor is 1, but is (5 +4)/5 =9/5 \u2192 integer division would give 1 (since floor(1.8) is 1 but the equation would need 1 here). Wait but the actual ceil(5/5)=1. So that's correct.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me write the formula:\n\nceil(a / b) = (a + b -1) / b \n\nBut using integer division (flooring towards zero).\n\nWait this formula works when b is positive. Since in our problem, min is one of the numbers read from input, would any of them be zero? I think the problem's constraints (since its AC problem) likely require that min is positive. Because if any of those five numbers is zero, then division by zero occurs. So assuming the problem ensures the numbers are positive, so min is positive.\n\nThus:\n\nceil(N / min) can be computed as (N + min -1)/min using integer division, which is easier, perhaps avoiding floating point operations.\n\nSince this is integer operations, maybe better for efficiency but also avoids any floating-point inaccuracies.\n\nIn Java, the code uses Math.ceil with double. Using this formula would be better because in Fortran, integer division can be straightforward.\n\nSo let me see:\n\nInstead of doing real numbers and ceiling, maybe do (N + min -1) / min. \n\nSo the result would be (N + min -1)/min \u2192 which is exactly the same as ceiling(N/min) (since if there was a fractional part, adding min-1 before dividing would push it to the next full integer).\n\nTherefore, the formula is (N + min -1)/min \u2192 which gives the same result as the ceil function.\n\nThen, plus 4.\n\nSo in code:\n\nanswer = (N + min -1)/min +4\n\nThat's better, uses only integers, avoiding any real operations.\n\nThis is probably better practice, given that integer division can be exact in this context, and avoids possible floating point precision issues.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is:\n\nAnswer = integer_division((N + min -1), min) +4\n\nIn Fortran, when you write (N + min -1)/min, it will do integer division (floor toward zero), but since N modulo min is less than min, the numerator will be N + min -1, so for example:\n\nN=10, min=3 \u219210+3-1=12 \u2192 12/3=4 which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5, min=3: (5+3-1)=7 \u21927/3=2 (integer division floors to 2?), wait but 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2, so the formula gives (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2 (since 7 divided by 3 is 2.333 which integer division truncates to 2, but floor of that is 2, which is the ceil of 1.666 \u2192 correct). \n\nYes, so the formula is correct.\n\nSo the steps in the Fortran code are now clearer.\n\nNow putting all together.\n\nFirst variables:\n\ndeclares integer variables of 8-byte (for 64bit as in Java).\n\nIn the code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, min_val, temp, i, a\n\nread *, n\n\nread *, temp\n\nmin_val = temp\n\ndo i = 1,4\n\n   read *, temp\n\n   if (temp < min_val) min_val = temp\n\nend do\n\ninteger(8) :: ans\n\nans = (n + min_val -1)/min_val +4\n\nprint *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared before their use. Let me structure the declarations properly.\n\nWait also, in the code, after N is read, then we read temp (the first of the 5).\n\nWait in code:\n\nDefine variables:\n\ndeclarations:\n\ninteger(8) :: n, min_val, temp, i\n\nThen after that:\n\nRead N (read *, n)\n\nRead first of five into temp \u2192 assign to min_val.\n\nThen loop for four other numbers:\n\nYes.\n\nWait, then the loop:\n\ndo i=1,4\n\nread *, temp\n\nif (temp < min_val) then\n\nmin_val = temp\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nThen compute ans.\n\nYes.\n\nWait also, the variable 'ans' can be declared right there. \n\nWait the total code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, min_val, temp, i\n\n! Read N\n\nread(*,*) n\n\n! Read first of 5 numbers and set as min_val\n\nread(*,*) temp\n\nmin_val = temp\n\n! Read the remaining four\n\ndo i=1,4\n\n   read(*,*) temp\n\n   if (temp < min_val) then\n\n      min_val = temp\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Compute ans.\n\ninteger(8) ans\n\nans = (n + min_val -1)/min_val +4\n\nprint *, ans\n\nend program main\n\nWait, wait. The variable 'ans' here is a local variable, but in Fortran we can just declare it where needed. Alternatively, maybe declare all variables at the top.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 90 you can declare variables where you need them. \n\nWait the code as above:\n\nWait, after declaring n, min_val, temp, then, to declare ans:\n\nwithin the code:\n\ninteger(8) :: ans\n\nbut need to do that upfront.\n\nWait the variables:\n\nThe first line after implicit none should declare all variables. Let me correct that:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8) :: n, min_val, temp, ans, i\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*,*) temp\n\nmin_val = temp\n\ndo i =1,4\n\n   read *, temp\n\n   if (temp < min_val) min_val = temp\n\nend do\n\nans = (n + min_val -1)/min_val +4\n\nprint *, ans\n\nend program\n\nYes, that's better. \n\nWait the variable Ans is initialized via the equation, so it needs to be declared. \n\nNow, testing for possible min_val=0? Well, the problem probably ensures that inputs are positive, so division is okay.\n\nThus this should work.\n\nLet me check the code:\n\nAfter reading the first five numbers (after N), the first is stored in temp and then min_val. Then the remaining four are read one by one, checking if they are smaller than current min_val. That's correct.\n\nThen the calculation: (N+ min_val -1)/min_val \u2192 ceil(N/min_val), then add 4.\n\nWhich matches what the Java code does, because in Java:\n\nMath.ceil(N/(double) min) \u2192 which gives the same as the formula when cast as integer division.\n\nThus this code should be correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when N is divisible by min_val, then (N + min-1)/min_val = N/min \u2192 adding 4 is correct.\n\nExample1:\n\nJava code:\n\nSuppose N=10, and next five numbers are 3,2,5,4,1 \u2192 the five are 3,2,5,4,1. So the minimum is 1.\n\nWait no: the five numbers: after reading first 3 \u2192 min is 3. Then next number is 2: becomes min. Then 5: no change (2 is smaller), then 4, no change. Then the last number is 1: new min_val is 1.\n\nThen the calculation: ceil(10/1) \u219210, plus4 \u219214.\n\nBut according to formula, (10 +1-1)/1 +4 \u2192 (10)/1 \u219210 +4 \u219214. Correct.\n\nAnother case:\n\nSuppose N =7 and min is 3. So (7 +3-1)/3 = 9/3=3 \u2192 3+4=7.\n\nWhich Math.ceil(7/3=2.333) gives 3 \u2192 3+4=7.\n\nAnother case where N=5, min=5 \u2192 (5+5-1)/5 \u2192 (9)/5=1.8 \u2192 integer division gives 1, since in Fortran 9/5 would be 1 (no decimal). Wait 9/5 is 1 with remainder 4.\n\nWait 9 /5 is 1.8, but in Fortran integer division (using /) will truncate towards zero, which gives 1. However that's not what I want. Wait wait hold on, that's a problem!\n\nWait my formula (N+min-1)/min: in case where N=5, min=5.\n\nThen (5+5-1) =9 \u21929 divided by 5 is 1.8 \u2192 in integer division gives 1 \u2192 then 1 plus4=5. \n\nBut the correct answer would be: 5 divided by 5 \u21921, so the ceil(1) +4 \u21925, which is correct. So yes.\n\nAnother example with N=6 and min=5:\n\nceil(6/5)= 2 \u21922+4=6. \n\nThe formula (6+5-1)/5 \u219210/5=2 \u21922+4=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case N=5, min_val=6? Wait no, if N=5, min_val is 6, so the division would be 5/6 \u21920.833. ceil is 1. So the formula gives (5+6-1)/6 \u219210/6 \u21921.666 \u2192 when done as integer division (since in Fortran (10/6) in integer division is 1 (1.666 truncated to 1). Which would be ceil(5/6=0.833) \u21921 \u2192 so formula gives 1 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nWait 10 divided by 6 in integer division is 1 (since 6*1=6, 6*2=12 which exceeds 10). So formula gives 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nAh, so the formula works correctly.\n\nWait So the formula (n + min-1)/min using integer division is correct for all cases because:\n\nIf (n mod min) is zero \u2192 (n + min-1)/min \u2192 (n + (min-1)) /min \u2192 n is exactly divisible, gives n/min.\n\nIf there is a remainder, then the added (min-1) increases the numerator by enough to push it to the next integer.\n\nHence, the formula works.\n\nSo the Fortran code is correctly implementing this.\n\nTherefore the code above should be correct.\n\nNow about the printing. The original Java code uses a p function to print, but in our Fortran code, we can simply do print*, ans. The print statement in Fortran will output the integer as before.\n\nNow, the variable names:\n\nI used min_val instead of min to avoid conflict with the MIN intrinsic function. Because in Fortran, if a variable is named min, it might conflict with the built-in functions, so better to call it min_val.\n\nYes, in the code above, min_val is the variable, which is okay.\n\nTherefore, this should be correct."
