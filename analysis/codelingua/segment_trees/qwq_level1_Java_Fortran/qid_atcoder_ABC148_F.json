    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what each part does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads N, u, and v. Then it builds an adjacency list for the tree since it's a tree with N nodes and N-1 edges. It uses two BFS (or DFS?) to find distances from u and v. Wait, the method uses DFS, right?\n\nWait, looking at the dfs method: it recursively goes through the edges and calculates distances. The initial call is setting d[u] to 0, then the DFS propagates that distance. So this is actually a BFS approach in a recursive manner? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, in Java, a depth-first approach would traverse in depth first. But when you initialize the node's distance and then visit all neighbors, that would be similar to BFS only if it's implemented in a certain way. Wait, no. The method here is a depth-first search for calculating distances, which is different from BFS. But to compute the shortest path in a tree (since it's a tree), both BFS and DFS can work since there's only one path between any two nodes.\n\nAnyway, the code computes the distances from u to all nodes (stored in d) and from v to all nodes (e). Then it finds the maximum value of e[i] among nodes where d[i] < e[i], which I think is related to a problem involving two people moving in the tree, maybe finding some minimal path or waiting point.\n\nNow I have to translate this into Fortran. Let's see the Fortran code structure required.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, there's no built-in List class like Java, so the adjacency list needs to be handled differently. Maybe using a dynamic array structure, but in Fortran, arrays are fixed size. Hmm. Perhaps, since the graph is a tree, it might be manageable by using linked lists, but that's complicated. Alternatively, since all nodes are connected, we can pre-allocate the adjacency lists. Since each node has degree varying from 1 to N-1 but for a tree, the average is small. Since in the worst case, the root has N-1 children. But in Fortran, to represent a list, perhaps we can use a dynamic array, but fixed size in the program.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of lists, but in Fortran. So each node's adjacency list is a one-dimensional array, and we can use an array of pointers (array of pointers in Fortran), but that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, since it's a tree, each edge is stored twice (for both directions), but for each node's edges, it can be stored in an array, but we need to know how many edges each has. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a list of edges for each node as a 'edge list', with a specified length. Let me think.\n\nIn Fortran, since every array has fixed size when declared, but in practice for variables in a function or procedure, you can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo the basic steps are:\n\n1. Read N, u, v (Java uses 0-based indices, so subtract 1. In Fortran, indices start at 1, so I can adjust variables accordingly.)\n\n2. Build the adjacency structure. So for N nodes (numbered 0 to N-1 in Java, but in Fortran, likely 1-based, so maybe converting to 1-based).\n\nLet me re-examine the variables:\n\nIn the Java code, nodes are 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps starting at 1 would be easier. So need to adjust variables. The initial u and v are read, then subtract 1. In Fortran, perhaps we'll work with 1-based indices as well.\n\nSo first, the input:\n\nRead N, then u_in = sc.nextInt; u = u_in-1. So in Fortran, read u and v, then add 1 to make them 1-based?\n\nWait, no, in the code, since Java uses 0-based nodes. For example:\n\nJava reads a and b, subtracting 1 to make them 0-based. So when the user enters numbers from 1 to N. Hence, in Fortran, if the user input is 1-based, then converting to Fortran's 1-based would be easier, so that variables can be directly used.\n\nWait, perhaps to make it easier, in the Fortran code, nodes are numbered 1 to N. So the edges would be read as from a and b (from user input as 1-based). So first, adjusting variables:\n\nOriginal Java variables u and v are given 0-based (because in Java, they subtract 1), but in Fortran, no need to adjust if input is 1-based. Therefore, perhaps the Fortran code can process the input as:\n\nRead N, then u and v, then a and b for edges, all as integers, but without subtracting 1. So that node indices are 1-based.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, the adjacency list.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nList<Integer>[] edges = new List[N]; for each node 0-based. So for Fortran, perhaps each node from 1 to N has a list of adjacent nodes.\n\nTo represent this efficiently, we can use an array of pointers to the adjacency lists. Alternatively, since it's a tree, the adjacency lists can be represented with a fixed maximum size for each, but unknown.\n\nIn Fortran, for dynamic lists, perhaps using variable-length arrays. Alternatively, we can precompute an array of neighbor counts first, then allocate for each node. Let's think of this approach:\n\n1. First, read all edges (N-1 edges), store them in a temporary array, then for each node count the number of edges, then allocate storage for each adjacency list.\n\nWait, but that requires storing all edges first before building the adjacency lists.\n\nAlternatively, can we do it in two passes?\n\nLet me think. Here's a possible approach:\n\nInitialize for each node a counter (adjacents_count). Then first pass through all the edges to count how many entries each node has.\n\nWait in this code:\n\nThe code first reads N-1 edges. Each edge is between a and b (converted to 0-based in Java). So in Fortran, for each of the edges a and b (converted to 1-based?), we can then do first pass to count how many edges each node has. Then allocate an array for each node's list.\n\nSo in steps:\n\nThe edges are stored in two arrays, say for the first edge list: adj_list. Let me outline:\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nThen read u and v (user inputs, convert to 1-based if the code expects that. So if the user entered 1-based, no need to adjust. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger N, u, v\n\nread *, N\n\nread *, u, v\n\nThen, read N-1 edges, but first we need to count how many edges each node has.\n\nDeclare arrays:\n\ninteger, dimension(N) :: adj_count = 0\n\nThen read each edge:\n\nfor i = 1 to N-1\n\nread *, a, b\n\nadj_count(a) = adj_count(a)+1\n\nadj_count(b) = adj_count(b)+1\n\nthen allocate arrays for each node's list.\n\nBut in Fortran, to do that, you can have an array of pointers. Another approach is to use two arrays: one for the indices and one for the list of nodes. Wait, perhaps better to create an adjacency list as a 2d array with the maximum capacity. Since each node's adjacency list can be up to N-1 elements, but that's inefficient. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is:\n\nUse an array of dynamic arrays. Wait, in modern Fortran (2003+), allocatable arrays can be components of derived types. Let's think of using a type, say, for each adjacency list:\n\ntype adjacency_info\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type\n\nThen declare an array of adjacency_info:\n\ntype(adjacency_info) :: edges_list(N)\n\nFirst pass to count the size for each list, then allocate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that's a bit complicated. Another way is use array of lists. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, here's an alternative approach using a linked list structure. But maybe that's too hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a 1-based array for each adjacency:\n\nFirst, read all edges into a temporary array:\n\nWe can read all edges first into a list of edges, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nLet me plan this step.\n\nRead all the edges (a and b), and store them in a list. Then, for each node, build its adjacency list from this list of edges. This way, you can process all edges without needing to pre-count.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead u_v (wait, after that u and v):\n\nRead N, u, v.\n\nThen read N-1 edges. Let's store edges as 1-based node indices.\n\nSo let's create an array to store edges:\n\ninteger, dimension(2, N-1) :: edges_temp\n\nThen read all edges into edges_temp:\n\ndo i = 1, N-1\n\n read *, edges_temp(1,i), edges_temp(2,i)\n\nend do\n\nThen, build adjacency list:\n\nWe can create an array for each node's adjacency list. Since we want a dynamic size, but Fortran doesn't have built-in dynamic arrays, except using allocatable arrays with size managed at runtime.\n\nSo for each node 1 to N:\n\nWe can have an integer array adj(i,:), which is the list of nodes connected to i.\n\nTo handle this, perhaps allocate each array as big as needed, but how?\n\nFirst, precompute the number of edges per node using the edges_temp array:\n\ninteger, dimension(N) :: adj_count = 0\n\nLoop over edges:\n\ndo ie = 1, N-1\n\n a = edges_temp(1, ie)\n\n b = edges_temp(2, ie)\n\n adj_count(a) = adj_count(a) + 1\n\n adj_count(b) = adj_count(b) +1\n\nend do\n\nThen, for each node from 1 to N, allocate an array with size adj_count(node):\n\nso type something like this:\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:) :: adj(:)\n\nNo, in Fortran arrays have to be declared with dimensions. So perhaps a better way:\n\ndeclare a 2D array, with row 1: N, and each row has as many as needed columns. So a 2D array where for each node, the adjacency list is stored as adj(Node, 1 : adj_count[node])\n\nBut in Fortran, this requires the 2nd dimension to be at least the maximum adj_count. Since the maximum can be up to N-1 (for the root), but that's big. So again, perhaps better to allocate as 1D arrays in a structure.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of dynamic arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a dynamic list implemented in a 1D array, with start and end pointers for each node. Maybe an adjacency list stored as follows:\n\n- An array of pointers to the next element for each edge.\n\nAlternatively, a better way for Fortran:\n\nWe can use an array of lists via allocatable arrays:\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nWe have a 1D array to hold all the adjacency elements.\n\nWe also have two arrays to track the start and count for each node:\n\ninteger, dimension(N+1) :: adj_start, adj_count\n\nThis is similar to associative lists where adj_start[i] holds the starting index in the adjacency array for node I. The count is adj_count[i], so the nodes for adj[I] are from adj_start[i+1] to adj_start[i] + adj_count[i].\n\nWait, the standard approach is that adj_start and adj_count arrays so that:\n\nFor each node i, the neighbors are stored between adj_start(i) and adj_start(i)+adj_count(i)-1. \n\nWait, more precisely, sometimes people use adj_start(1)=1 and adj_start(i)=adj_start(i-1)+adj_count(i-1) etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the approach with:\n\nInitialize adj_count for all nodes to 0. Then for each edge, we increment adj_count(a) and adj_count(b). Then allocate adj_start where adj_start(1)=1, and adj_start(i)= adj_start(i-1)+adj_count(i-1), for i=2 to N. The total length needed is the sum of all adj_count, which equals 2*(N-1). Since each edge connects two nodes.\n\nWait that might be manageable.\n\nAnother approach is to do as follows:\n\nCompute the adj_count for each node.\n\nCompute the total size of the adjacency list: total = 2*(N-1)\n\nAllocate an array adj_list(1:total)\n\nThen, create the adj_start array, which for each node i points to the first entry in its list.\n\nAlso, have the adj_count array as before.\n\nInitialization steps:\n\n1. First iterate over edges to count adj_count for each node.\n\n2. Compute adj_start:\n\nadj_start(1) = 1\n\nDo i=2 to N:\n\nadj_start(i) = adj_start(i-1) + adj_count(i-1)\n\nBut wait, does adj_count store for each node the number of adjacent nodes? That would be yes.\n\nThen, when building the adjacency list:\n\nInitialize the pointers.\n\nDo a second pass over edges:\n\nEach edge (a and b) contributes to both nodes' adj lists.\n\nWe need to store both a \u2192 b and b \u2192 a.\n\nFirst for edge A-B:\n\nadd B to node A's adjacency list.\n\nadd A to node B's adjacency list.\n\nThus, iterate over all edges (both original edges and reversed edges?), no, original edges are stored. So, the process:\n\nFirst, prepare the arrays:\n\nWe have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: adj_list(:)\n\ninteger adj_count(N), adj_start(N+1) ! because adj_start for N has adj_start(N+1) as the end point\n\nThe process:\n\nOnce adj_count is known, adj_start can be computed. So:\n\nadj_start(1) = 1\n\ndo i =2 to N:\n\n    adj_start(i) = adj_start(i-1) + adj_count(i-1)\n\nend do\n\nAlso, adj_start(N+1)=adj_start(N)+adj_count(N) =sum_{i=1 to N} adj_count(i) = 2*(N-1).\n\nThen, to fill the adj_list:\n\nWe have to track a fill pointer. Alternatively, first initialize the whole adj_list to zero.\n\nThen for all edges:\n\nWait, originally, for each of the N-1 edges (a, b), we need to add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nSo the first step:\n\nLoop through all edges in edges_temp and add both entries to adj_list and adj_count.\n\nWait, but in the current approach, we already counted adj_count during first pass. Then after that, building the adjacency list entries.\n\nHmm, perhaps need a more detailed step plan.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe in this case, a better approach is that in Fortran, you can have an allocate an array of lists, using an allocatable array for each node's adjacency list. So perhaps using something like:\n\nTYPE TreeNeighbor\n   INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: edges(:)\nEND TYPE TreeNeighbor\n\nTYPE(TreeNeighbor), DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: nodes\n\nThe code would be:\n\nFirst, read N, and Allocate the nodes array:\n\nallocate(nodes(N))\n\nThen, perform pass over edges to count the number of edges per node, but need two temporary arrays to track counts?\n\nAlternatively, instead of counting first, can simply read each edge and append to each node's list.\n\nAh, that way, even better:\n\nBecause in the first read pass:\n\nafter N and u and v are read, then for the edges:\n\ndo i= 1, N-1\n\n  read *, A, B\n\n  call append_to_list( a, B, edges)\n  call append_to_list( b, A, edges )\n\nend do\n\nHere, 'edges' is an array of TreeNeighbor such that for each index a, append the B to the edgesedges(a) list, and similarly for b.\n\nThe append_to_list function would check if there is space, and if not, reallocate the array (like a linked list in some way).\n\nThis is possible in Fortran via pointers.\n\nAlternatively, use a module with allocatable arrays and use a procedure to handle the appending.\n\nAlternatively, for code simplicity, given that Java uses ArrayList, which auto-expands, perhaps we can preinitialize each adj list with capacity N (since a tree's node can have up to N-1 edges) but in practice, it's a waste, but manageable.\n\nWait, making it as an allocatable array for each node's adjacency list.\n\nSo let's outline this type approach:\n\ntype adjacency_t\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type\n\ninteger :: N\ntype(adjacency_t), dimension(:), allocatable :: edges\n\nAllocate edges(N), then for each node 1:N, edges(i)%list is an array.\n\nInitially, for each node, edges(i)%list has size zero. \n\nWhen adding a new edge, check if the array is big enough, and reallocates.\n\nAlternatively, we can preallocate each array to have size N, which is the worst case, so that no need to reallocate.\n\nBut that would require each adjacency list's array to have N elements, which is okay for a reasonable N, say 1e4 nodes.\n\nWait, if N is up to 1e5, but then that could be memory intensive, but if the code expects small N?\n\nWell, the problem is from AtCoder contest ABC148 F: perhaps the constraints are up to small values. Well, perhaps we can just preallocate a large enough size, say N nodes, and let adj list each can have up to N-1 edges, so allocating for each node an array of size N:\n\nAlternatively, re-allocating on the fly. Let's see how to code this.\n\nLet me think of a helper function to append a new element to a dynamic array. For instance:\n\nsubroutine append_element(array, item)\n   integer, intent(out), allocatable :: array(:)\n   integer, intent(in) :: item\n   integer :: n\n\n   n = size(array) // allocatable arrays have size 0 initially.\n   if (n == 0) then\n      allocate(array(1))\n      array(1) = item\n   else\n      redim \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0432 with ve\u0438\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0438 size. But it's better to use Fortran's allocatable reallocation:\n\n      allocate(temp(0:size(array) + 1)) \n\nWait, in Fortran, to append, you can use:\n\n   integer, allocatable :: temp(:)\n   temp = [array, item]\n   array = temp\n   deallocate(temp)\n\nBut that would be inefficient? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n   integer :: new_size\n   new_size = size(array)+1\n   call move_alloc( from = array, to = temp )\n   temp = reallocarray with new_size to array\nWait, perhaps I need to allocate a new array and copy over.\n\nThis syntax in Fortran is manageable but can get a bit verbose. \n\nAlternatively, in the code of adj processing, perhaps for purposes of efficiency, allocate each adjacency list to N elements (max possible). Thus, pre-allocate arrays of size N for each node's edges list. Then adds each edge, and track the current number in each list.\n\nBut to do this, perhaps:\n\ntype adjacency_t \n   integer, pointer :: list(:)\n   integer :: count\nend type\n\nBut perhaps overcomplicating.\n\nWait the original Java code uses ArrayList, so in their DFS that can handle the lists.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way is:\n\n- Represent the adjacency list for each node in an allocatable array. Use a function to append, which reallocates as needed.\n\nLet me code this idea.\n\nFirst, define the adj list as an array of allocatable lists:\n\ntype adj_t\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\nend type adj_t\ntype(adj_t), dimension(:), allocatable :: adj\n\nallocate(adj(N))\n\nthen for each edge (a, b)\n\ncall add_edge(a, b)\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a,b)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: a,b\n    integer :: i\n\n    ! adding to a's adj list\n    if ( allocated(adj(a).list) ) then\n        ! need to check size\n        if( size( adj(a)%list ) == adj(a)%count ) \n            then\n                allocate(old_list( size(adj(a)%list) ) )\n                old_list = adj(a).list\n                deallocate( adj(a).list )\n                adj(a).list = old_list // [something]\n            ...\n    else\n        allocate(adj(a)%list(1))\n    end if\n\nWait, perhaps for simplicity, let's say each adj%list and the count of elements (size of list?)\n\nAlternatively, just redimension each time adding an element:\n\n   original_size = 10\n    but this might be error prone.\n\nAlternatively, pre-initialize each node's list with capacity say N elements.\n\nFor example:\n\nDeclared type has list being arrays of size N.\n\nBut Fortran lets us allocate arrays with initial size.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a linked list structure but I think that's not simple.\n\nPerhaps this is better handled with the following plan for the adjacency list:\n\nFor each node, store its adjacent nodes in an array, and track the current length. Let me try:\n\ntype adjacency_info \n    integer :: count =0\n    integer, allocatable :: list(:)\nend type\n\ndimension: adjacency_info edges(N)\n\nThen when adding edges:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a, b)\n    integer ::a, b\n    edges(a).list(edges(a).count +1) = b\n    edges(a).count = edges(a).count +1\n\n    edges(b).list(edges(b).count +1) = a\n    edges(b).count = edges(b).count +1\nend subroutine\n\nBut this will require that edges(a).list is already allocated.\n\nSo prior to this, perhaps when adding the first element, we need to allocate the array to a size of say N.\n\nAlternatively, when the count is zero, allocate with whatever size. Let me think.\n\nWait before the loop over edges:\n\ndo for each node i, edges(i).list is uninitialized, so when adding the first element:\n\nwhen edges(a).count == 0 (the first time) we have to allocate edges(a).list.\n\nThus, in add_edge:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a, b)\n   integer a, b\n\n   if(.NOT.allocated(edges(a)%list)) then\n      allocate(edges(a)%list( N ))  ! arbitrarily high capacity\n   else if ( edges(a)%count == size(edges(a)%list) ) then \n       ! time to grow the array\n       allocate(temp_list( 2*size(edges(a)%list) ))\n       temp_list(1:size(edges(a)%list)) = edges(a)%list\n       deallocate(edges(a)%list)\n       edges(a)%list = temp_list\n   end if\n\n   edges(a)%list(edges(a)%count +1) = b\n\n   edges(a)%count = edges(a)%count+1\n\n   ! similarly for the other node:\n   if (a.ne.b) then \n\n      if(.NOT.allocated(edges(b)%list)) then\n         allocate(edges(b)%list( N ))\n      else if ( edges(b)%count == size(edges(b)%list) ) then\n          allocate( temp ( 2*size( edges(b)%list ) ) )\n          temp(1:size(edges(b)%list)) = edges(b)%list\n          deallocate(edges(b)%list)\n          edges(b)%list = temp\n      end if\n\n      edges(b)%count = edges(b)%count + 1\n      edges(b)%list(edges(b)%count ) = a\n\n    ! important, because the edges can be loops? Wait in the problem statement: it's a tree so no loops.\n\n    end if\n\nend subroutine add_edge\n\nHmm this could work. However, in the original code, the input edges are non-loop, since it's a tree.\n\nThis requires passing 'edges' as a module or passing via pointers, but in Fortran, when writing a subroutine, you need to have variables that can be passed.\n\nAlternatively, you can have a global array of edges. Which might be easier.\n\nPerhaps the code will be manageable with the following:\n\nFirst, define the adjacency list variables in the main program or module.\n\nBut let me think of the overall steps.\n\nFirst, the code needs to read N, u, v, then the edges.\n\nLet's structure the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the module if any.\n\nAlternatively, let me code it as a subroutine.\n\nBut in any case, the main code:\n\nprogram abc148_f\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: N, u, v, i, a, b\n   type adjacency_info, dimension(:), allocatable :: edges \n\n   ! read N, u, v\n   read(*,*) N\n   read(*,*) u, v\n   ! since nodes are 1-based in this code.\n\n   ! allocate edges array\n   allocate(edges(N))\n\n   ! read N-1 edges.\n   do i=1, N-1\n      read(*,*) a, b\n      call add_edge(a, b, edges)\n   end do\n\n   ! then compute distances.\n\n   ! proceed to code for the distance arrays d and e.\n\n   ! ... but now, need to deal with the adjacency list.\n\nBut to implement add_edge above as a subroutine, we need to pass edges by pointer, or as a dummy argument with allocatable.\n\nWait, passing an allocatable array of derived type in a subroutine.\n\nIn Fortran, allocatable arrays can be passed to subroutines.\n\nThe add_edge subroutine signature would be:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a, b, edges)\n   integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n   type(adjacency_info), intent(inout), dimension(:) :: edges\n   ! ... the body as before\nend subroutine add_edge \n\nThus, inside add_edge, the edges is a pointer to the edges array.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut now, in the code:\n\nWait, also note that the adjacency_info has count =0 and list not allocated.\n\nThus for each edge (a,b), the call adds node a to b's adjacency list and vice versa.\n\nNow, after all edges are added, we need to compute distances d and e.\n\nFirst, compute distances from u to all nodes (d array), then from v to e array.\n\nThe DFS in the Java code was implemented recursively. However, in Fortran, recursion depth can be an issue if the tree is deep. Given that it's a tree up to N= a large number, but in practice contest problems often have recursion allowed unless N is big. Alternatively, an iterative DFS or BFS could be better.\n\nWait the Java code's DFS is doing exactly BFS? Because the way it's showing.\n\nLooking at the dfs function in Java:\n\nstatic void dfs(int u, int[] d, List<Integer>[] edges) {\n    for (Integer nu : edges[u]) {\n        if (d[nu] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {\n            d[nu] = d[u] + 1;\n            dfs(nu, d, edges);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis is a recursive depth-first traversal. But for calculating shortest path in a unweighted graph, a BFS is more appropriate, but according to the Java code, this is done with a DFS. But since it's a tree, it's okay because there's only one path between any two nodes. Thus, the recursive DFS calculates the distances correctly since each path is unique.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the same approach can be taken.\n\nHowever, the maximum recursion depth in Fortran may be a problem if the tree is deep. Let me suppose that u can be a root and the tree can be a straight line. Thus, it's a chain with N nodes. So for N=1e5, recursion would stackoverflow. But perhaps in the AtCoder problem, the constraints for F may be small enough. Alternatively, the code uses DFS for this purpose.\n\nIf that's acceptable in the problem, then proceed with recursive DFS.\n\nSo, first, implementing the distance arrays.\n\nTo compute the distance arrays:\n\nThe approach:\n\n- The d array is initialized with infinity except d[u] =0.\n\n- Perform a recursive DFS to compute all distances.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nSubroutine dfs(n, current_node, edges, distance, visited)\n\nWait no, the code starts from the initial node, sets its distance, and then proceeds recursively. Wait in the Java code, they just pass the distance array, which starts with max except for start point.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nPerhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(:) :: d\n\n   ! Initialize d to a large value (e.g. infinity). Use integer*8 or a big value.\n\n   d = big_val\n\n   d(u) =0\n\n   call traverse(u, 0, edges, d) \n\nWait, but what is big_val?\n\nInteger in Fortran is default usually 4 bytes (up to 2e9) . Since in the Java code, they use Integer.MAX_VALUE which is 2^31-1 (~ 2e9). So in Fortran, an integer can handle it.\n\nThus, choose big_val as 2e9 or similar.\n\nSet big_val = (2**31 -1). Or use whatever is suitable.\n\nWait 2^31 is about 2147483648, so 2147483647 is the max int32.\n\nThus:\n\ninteger, parameter :: INF = 2147483647\n\nSet:\n\nd= INF\n\nd(u) =0\n\nThen call the dfs.\n\nBut we need to write a recursive function.\n\nSUBROUTINE dfs(u, edges, d)\n\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: u\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension(:), intent(in) :: edges\n   integer, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: d\n   integer :: v, i\n\n   do i =1, edges(u)%count\n      v = edges(u)%list(i)\n      if (d(v) == INF) then\n          d(v) = d(u) +1\n          call dfs(v, edges, d)\n      end if\n   end do\nEND SUBROUTINE dfs\n\nWait so, the edges(u)%list holds the adjacency list for node u. \n\nYes.\n\nNow, the Java code's dfs only passes the 'edges' and 'd'. Since in the Java code, the edges are List[] edges, similar to our Fortran structure.\n\nThus, the similar code can be implemented.\n\nWait, note that in the Java code, the edges are passed to the dfs function. So in Fortran, the edges array must be available in the recursive calls, which works here.\n\nThus, the code outline for distance:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nallocate(d(N)), initialize d= INF\n\nd(u)=0\n\nCALL dfs(u, edges, d)\n\nSame for e array.\n\nAfter computing d and e arrays:\n\nthen loop over all nodes:\n\nq = -1 (or some default value such as -1 or 0)\n\n q = -1  in Fortran. Need to find the maximum e(i) where d(i) < e(i).\n\nWait, initially set q = -1?\n\nYes, same as Java code.\n\n   q = -1\n\n   do i=1,N\n      if(d(i) < e(i) ) then\n         if(e(i) > q) then\n             q = e(i)\n         end if\n      end if\n   end do\n\nThen output:\n\nif q <=0 then write 0 else write q-1.\n\nWait the original code's output is:\n\nif (q <= 0) {\n\n             System.out.println(0);\n\n         } else {\n\n             System.out.println(q - 1);\n\n         }\n\nSo similarly, in Fortran:\n\nif(q <=0) then\n\n   write(*,*) 0\n\nelse\n\n   write(*,*) q-1\n\nend if\n\nThus, the algorithm seems manageable.\n\nNow putting together the code:\n\nFirst, need to write the data type definitions and subroutines.\n\nFirst the adjacency_info type:\n\ntype :: adjacency_info\n   integer :: count =0\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type adjacency_info\n\nThen the add_edge subroutine:\n\nSUBROUTINE add_edge(a, b, edges)\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension(:), intent(inout) :: edges\n   integer :: enlargen_a, enlargen_b\n   integer :: new_a, new_b\n\n   ! Enlarge array for a's list as needed\n   if(.NOT. allocated(edges(a)%list)) then\n      allocate(edges(a)%list(10))  ! initial buffer of size 10, but can change\n   else if( edges(a)%count +1 > size(edges(a)%list )) then\n      ! double the allocated size\n      integer :: new_size, i\n      new_size = max(10, size(edges(a)%list))*2\n      integer, dimension(new_size) :: tmp\n      tmp(1: size(edges(a)%list) ) = edges(a)%list(1: edges(a)%count )\n      deallocate(edges(a)%list)\n      allocate(edges(a)%list(new_size))\n      edges(a)%list(1:edges(a)%count) = tmp(1:edges(a)%count)\n      deallocate(tmp)\n   end if\n\n   edges(a)%count = edges(a)%count +1\n   edges(a)%list(edges(a)%count) = b\n\n   ! Now do the same for the edge from b to a:\n   if(a /=b) then\n      if(.NOT. allocated(edges(b)%list)) then\n         allocate(edges(b)%list(10))\n      else if( edges(b)%count +1 > size(edges(b)%list)) then\n         integer :: new_size\n         new_size = max(10, size(edges(b)%list )) *2\n         integer, dimension(new_size) :: tmp\n!         print*, \"resizing b's list from/to\", size(edges(b)%list), new_size\n         tmp(1:edges(b)%count) = edges(b)%list(1:edges(b)%count )\n         deallocate(edges(b)%list)\n         allocate(edges(b)%list(new_size))\n         edges(b)%list(1:edges(b)%count) = tmp(1:edges(b)%count)\n         deallocate(tmp)\n      end if\n      edges(b)%count = edges(b)%count +1\n      edges(b)%list(edges(b)%count) = a\n   end if\nend subroutine add_edge\n\nThis is the subroutine to add edges. We can see that it's a bit involved with dynamic memory handling.\n\nSecond, the DFS subroutine:\n\nRECURSIVE SUBROUTINE dfs(u, edges, dist)\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: u\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension(:), intent(in) :: edges\n   integer, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: dist\n   integer :: i, v\n\n   do i =1, edges(u)%count\n      v=edges(u)%list(i)\n \n      if( dist(v) == INF ) then\n          dist(v) = dist(u) +1\n          call dfs(v, edges, dist)\n      end if\n   end do\nEND SUBROUTINE dfs\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe main program:\n\n   program ABC148\n     implicit none\n\n     integer, parameter :: INF = 2147483647\n     integer :: N, u, v, q\n     type(adjacency_info), dimension(:), allocatable :: edges\n     integer, dimension( : ), allocatable :: d, e\n     integer :: i, a, b\n     character(len=256) :: line\n\n     !

Compute distance from u\n     allocate(d(N))\n     d = INF\n     d(u) =0\n     call dfs(u, edges, d)\n\n     ! Compute distance from v\n     allocate(e(N))\n     e= INF\n     e(v)=0\n     call dfs(v, edges, e)\n\n     ! Find the maximum e(i) where d(i)<e(i)\n     q = -1\n     do i =1,N\n        if( d(i) < e(i) ) then\n           if( e(i) > q ) then\n              q = e(i)\n           end if\n        end if\n     end do\n\n     if( q <=0 ) then\n       print*, 0\n     else\n        print*, q-1\n     end if\n\n   end program ABC148\n\nBut wait for this to compile, need to ensure all the subroutines are defined, and the add_edge and dfs are accessible.\n\nIn a single file, this would work if the subroutines are placed before the main program, or in modules.\n\nAlternatively, putting the subroutines after the program but before the end program.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, the order of subroutines must be properly threaded.\n\nWait, in standard Fortran (F90/F95), you need to have subroutines and functions declared in the scope before their use or placed in modules.\n\nTo avoid this, the approach here is to write the main program, include the type definitions and subroutines after the main program calls, but since subroutines can be referenced in the main program without prior declaration because they are in the same file but later in the code, but this depends on the compiler's default. So we can structure the code as:\n\nStart with the program ABC148.\n\n Inside the program, after the reads and before they are called, the subroutines must be placed. Alternatively, use modules.\n\nIt's better to arrange the program as follows:\n\nFirst the program block:\n\nprogram ABC148\n   ...\nend program\n\nthen the subroutines below.\n\nBut for free-form source that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, place all the subroutines within the program's body (although in that case, they need to be inside the program's scope).\n\nAlternatively, better to put module definitions at top, but in a submission here, the code can be written without modules for simplicity.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, if you do not use Modules, you can have subroutines and functions after the program, provided that the main program does not reference them before they are defined.\n\nIn the code above, the main program uses add_edge and dfs, which are defined later.\n\nThus, this will not work because the compiler would see the called routines not yet defined. To fix this:\n\nEither:\n\n 1. Put the subroutines before the main program.\n\n 2. Use a module to contain everything, but this is more code.\n\nOption 1 is easier.\n\nThus, reorganize the code:\n\nStart with modules (if needed), then subroutines, then the main program.\n\nBut for this case, let me adjust.\n\nFirst, the type definition for adjacency_info must be available to all the subroutines.\n\nSince in the code above, the typedef is inside the main program, but subroutines requires the type to be declared in scope.\n\nThus, perhaps better to define the type inside of a module, or before the program.\n\nAlternatively, place all type and subroutines first.\n\nThe corrected code structure:\n\nFirst, the type declaration.\n\ntype :: adjacency_info\n\n  integer :: count =0 ! count of adiacent nodes:\n  integer, allocatable :: list(:)\nend type adjacency_info\n\ninteger, parameter :: INF = 2147483647\n\nThen, the subroutines.\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a,b, edges)\n  ...\n   use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env\n  implicit none\n type(adjacency_info) ....\n\nWait to avoid confusion, perhaps the best way is:\n\nDefine the type outside of the main program, so that both the program and the subroutines can access it.\n\nSo:\n\nmodule my_mod\nimplicit none\n\ntype :: adjacency_info\n   integer :: count =0\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n  end type adjacency_info\n\ncontains\n\n  subroutine add_edge(...)\n    ...\n  end subroutine\n\n  recursive subroutine dfs( u, edges, dist)\n    ...\n  end subroutine\n\nend module my_mod\n\nAnd then the program uses this module.\n\nBut this may add some complexity to the code.\n\nAlternatively, simplify, and declare the type and subroutines in the global space.\n\nHowever, in this submission, perhaps for the code to work, the above needs to have the type and subroutines visible to the main program.\n\nAn alternative approach is to place all the code in a single file, with the type definition at the top.\n\nThus:\n\nFirst the type:\n\ntype adjacency_info\n   integer :: count =0\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type adjacency_info\n\nThen the subroutines:\n\nsubroutine add_edge(a, b, edges)\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n  type(adjacency_info), dimension(:), intent(inout) :: edges\n  ... as before\n... all the code for add_edge here.\n\nThen the df recursive subroutine.\n\nThen the program.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram ABC148_F\n   !

Some subroutines can be held here, but in the code above are not needed.\nend program ABC148_F\n\nWait, but when we first allocated edges, each element is initialized with count =0 and list unallocated?\n\nYes.\n\nWait in the allocate(edges(N)), the type has count defaulting to 0, and list is not allocated. So the loop that sets edges(i)%count =0 is redundant but safe.\n\nBut might need to reset them?\n\nNo, they were initialized to 0 with the constructor.\n\nThus it's okay.\n\nHowever, in the add_edge sub, when checking for allocated, edges(a)%list might be allocated, but since it was initialized to unallocated initially it starts empty.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nThe add_edge could be inefficient with repeated allocations. But given that tree edges are read once each, it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing is that the dfs is recursive. For large N, this might stack overflow.\n\nSuppose that the tree has a linear structure (chain of nodes 1-2-3-...-N). Then the DFS would g\ub85c N recursive calls, which for N=1e5 would overflow the stack.\n\nHowever, in practice, many modern Fortran implementations have a large recursion stack, but some might limit.\n\nThis is a potential problem. To work around this, the code can switch to an iterative DFS or use a BFS.\n\nLet me think of the DFS using a stack:\n\nPerhaps rewrite the DFS as an iterative implementation using an explicit stack.\n\nSubroutine dfs_iterative(u, edges, dist)\n\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: u\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension( : ), intent(in) :: edges\n   integer, dimension( : ), intent(inout) :: dist\n   integer, dimension( : ), allocatable :: stack\n   integer :: top, current_node, i, v\n\n   allocate( stack( N ) ) !

To implement depth first, you can push children to the stack first or last.\n\nWait, to wykon implementing a recursive DFS iteratively:\n\nAlternative, using a stack that stores the current node and a pointer indicating how much processing has been done:\n\nAlternatively, a simple iterative DFS:\n\n   call DFS iterative using a stack:\n\n   initialize stack with u.\n\n   while stack not empty:\n\n       current = pop(stack)\n\n       for each neighbor v of current:\n\n           if dist(v) ==INF:\n\n               dist(v) = dist(current)+1\n\n               push v to the stack.\n\n   However, this is pre-order traversal: but needs to push neighbors into the stack in reverse order.\n\n   So the code would be:\n\nThe order may vary, but in terms of correctness, since it's a tree, any order is fine as long as paths are explored correctly.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nsubroutine iterative_bfs(u, edges, dist )\n\n   ! This is better to be BFS, which would ensure shortest paths.\n\n   ! Since we are calculating the shortest path in a tree, BFS is suitable.\n\n   ! Mistakes can happen if DFS or BFS is used and the list is unordered. But for a tree, any path is okay since there's only one path.\n\n   ! But perhaps for unweighted shortest paths, it's better to implement BFS.\n\nBut given the original code used a recursive depth-first search, we can also choose to implement BFS.\n\nWait BFS is breadth-first, so ensures that nodes are visited in order of their distance from the source, which is optimal for shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nThus, in the original Java code's DFS, even implemented recursively, the distances are still calculated correctly because on a tree, all paths between nodes are unique. Thus, the recursive DFS still works.\n\nBut for large N that might lead to stack overflow, the iterative BFS or DFS is better.\n\nThus, to make this more robust, let's re-write the distance calculation with BFS.\n\nImplementing BFS via a queue.\n\nThe BFS code skeleton:\n\nsubroutine BFS( s, edges, dist )\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: s\n\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension( : ), intent( in ) :: edges\n\n   integer, dimension( : ), intent( inout ) :: dist\n\n   integer :: qmax_size = N, front=1, rear=1 \n\n   integer, dimension( N ) :: queue \n\n   dist(s )= 0\n\n   queue(1)= s\n\n   do while ( front <= rear )\n\n      integer :: current_node = queue( front )\n\n      front = front+1\n\n      do i=1, edges(current_node)%count\n\n        v = edges(current_node)%list(i)\n\n        if( dist(v) == INF ) then\n\n          dist( v )= dist(current_node)+1\n\n          rear = rear +1\n\n          queue(rear) = v\n\n        end if \n\n      end do \n\n   end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nThis would be more efficient and stack-safe.\n\nThus, replacing the recursive DFS with this BFS could be better.\n\nThus, modifying the code accordingly:\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Replace recursive subroutines with BFS.\n\nModify the code's main program to call BFS instead.\n\nSo replacing 'call dfs(u, edges, d)' with 'call BFS(u, edges, d)', and similarly for v's e array.\n\nThus, the add_edge remains the same, but the distance calculation uses BFS.\n\nNow, implementing the BFS subroutine.\n\nThe BFS function:\n\nsubroutine BFS( s, edges, dist )\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: s\n  type(adjacency_info), dimension( : ), intent( in ) :: edges\n  integer, dimension( : ), intent( inout ) :: dist\n  integer, parameter :: queue_size = 1000000 ! Arbitrary large enough size.\n  integer queue(1:queue_size)  ! but in Fortran can be allocated as needed.\n  integer :: front, rear, current_node, i, v\n  dist(s) = 0\n  front =1\n  rear=1\n  queue(1)=s \n\n  do while ( front <= rear )\n     current_node = queue(front)\n     front = front +1\n     do i=1, edges(current_node)%count\n        v= edges(current_node)%list(i)\n        if ( dist(v) == INF ) then \n           dist(v) = dist(current_node) +1\n           rear = rear +1\n           queue(rear) = v\n        end if\n     end do\n  end do\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but this uses a fixed size queue. For large N, say up to 1e6 nodes, this can exceed. However, perhaps in the code's problem limits, the queue can be sized as N.\n\nAlternatively, allocate dynamically:\n\nsubroutine BFS( s, edges, dist )\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: s\n   type(adjacency_info), dimension( : ), intent(in) :: edges\n   integer, dimension( : ), intent(inout) :: dist\n   integer, dimension( : ), allocatable :: queue\n   integer :: front, rear, front_initial, rear_initial, current_node, i, v, N\n   N = size(edges) ! assuming edges size is N, the number of nodes.\n\n   allocate( queue( N ) ) ! maximum queue size is N (tree case)\n\n   dist(s) =0\n   front =1\n   rear =1\n   queue(1) = s\n\n   do while ( front <= rear )\n      current_node = queue( front )\n      front = front +1\n      do i=1, edges(current_node)%count\n         v = edges(current_node)%list(i)\n         if( dist( v ) == INF ) then\n            dist(v)= dist(current_node) +1\n            rear= rear +1\n            queue( rear )= v\n         end if\n      end do\n   end do\n   deallocate(queue)\nend subroutine BFS\n\nThis way, the queue is allocated as large as N, which works for tree BFS.\n\nNow, with this BFS subroutine replacing the recursive DFS, the code should be more robust against deep recursion.\n\nThus, updating the main program:\n\nreplace the dfs calls with BFS:\n\nAllocate d and e arrays as before.\n\ncall BFS(u, edges, d)\n\ncall BFS(v, edges, e)\n\nThus, the code now is more stack-safe.\n\nNow, putting all together with BFS.\n\nThus the final Fortran code would include:\n\nThe type definition, the add_edge, the BFS subroutine, and the main program.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the code:\n\ntype adjacency_info\n   integer :: count =0\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type adjacency_info\n\ninteger, parameter :: INF = 2147483647  !

If edges(a)%count+1 would exceed 10, then new_size is 20, and the command allocate(edges(a)%list(20), source= edges(a)%list) copies the first 10 elements into the new array.\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nBut this is good practice in a language supporting allocatable arrays and Fortran 2003's features.\n\nAlternatively, to use this idiom.\n\nHowever, in Fortran 2003, you can directly do:\n\nedges(a)%list = [edges(a)%list, new_element]\n\nFor appending. Since this creates a temporary array of size N+1, whose elements are the original array values.\n\nThus, this is a much simpler way.\n\nThus, the following method to append to the array:\n\n edges(a)%count = edges(a)%count+1\n edges(a)%list(edges(a)%count) =b\n\nWhen the array is undersized, use:\n\n if(edges(a)%count > size(edges(a)%list) ) then\n    ! Resize:\n    allocate(tmp(size*2))\n    tmp(1: original_size) = edges(a)%list\n    deallocate(edges(a)%list)\n    edges(a)%list = tmp\n    deallocate(tmp)\n end if\n\nBut in function add_edge:\n\nThe code can be written more simply using the Fortran 2003 allocation with source, or using array constructors.\n\nThe previous code may be more efficient in the current add_edge implementation.\n\nBut in the current code above in the add_edge's first part:\n\nif the initial allocation is 10, and need to expand:\n\nallocate(edges(a)%list(new_size), source=edges(a)%list)\n\nThen this will copy all elements from the previous array.\n\nBut this requires that edges(a)%list was allocated. But in our case, we had:\n\n   if ( .not. allocated(edges(a)%list) ) then\n      allocate(edges(a)%list(10))  ! Initial capacity\n\n   else if ( ... ) then\n      ... do the resize.\n\nThus, if it's allocated before, then the source= can be used.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nPossibleEdge Cases:\n\nTest case where u and v are adjacent.\n\nFor example, N=3 nodes.\n\nu=1, v=2.\n\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3.\n\nThen distance from u to all nodes:\n\nd[1]=0, d[2]=1, d[3]=1.\n\nDistance from v (2) to nodes:\n\ne(1)=1, e(2)=0, e(3)=2.\n\nNow for each node:\n\nFor node 3, d(3)=1 < e(3)=2 \uff0cthen e(i)=2 which is candidate for q. \n\nThus q is 2. Then output 2-1 = 1.\n\nBut according to the problem's logic?\n\nPerhaps check this.\n\nBut the final code should compute q=2, and output q-1 =1.\n\n Thus the code should output 1.\n\nThus code works?\n\nProbably.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nLastly, the printed output uses the format 'print'(i0) which is free format with no comma.\n\nThe overall code should now be correct."
