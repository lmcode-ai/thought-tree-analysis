    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first, I should understand what the Java code is doing. Let's go through it step by step.\n\nThe main class is atcoder_ABC043_B, and it uses a LightScanner to read input and a PrintWriter to write output. The problem is about processing a string with some commands. The solver is an instance of BUnhappyHackingABCEdit which has the solve method.\n\nThe solve method takes a string input, iterates over each character, and builds a string (d) where:\n- '0' or '1' are appended to d as is.\n- 'B' causes the last character of d to be deleted, if there is any.\n\nSo the main logic is processing each character of the input string and modifying the output string accordingly.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nFirst, Fortran's input/output is different. Since we need to read a string from standard input, perhaps using read(*,*) is the way to go. But in Java's code, the LightScanner is used to read tokens, but in this case, it's just reading a single line as a string because each test case is one line. Since the Java code uses in.string(), which reads the next token, but since the problem is probably reading a single line (the problem statement is not given, but based on the code's structure), maybe in the original problem it's a single line input. Wait, but the code uses a StringTokenizer, which splits on whitespace. Wait, but in the code's solve method, the input is read as in.string(), which would get the next token (so perhaps each line is processed as a single token, meaning that maybe the input is free of spaces). Because the problem is about processing a string with '0', '1', 'B' characters, so probably the input is a string without spaces. So perhaps in Fortran, we just read a line from standard input.\n\nIn Fortran, the way to read a line is with a character string of sufficient length, using the adjustl and some methods, but maybe using the intrinsic function GET_LINE? Wait Fortran 2003 introduced get_command_argument, but for reading from stdin, perhaps the best is to use a READ statement with an implicit format. Alternatively, for variable length strings, using the new allocatable strings in F2003.\n\nWait, let me structure the approach:\n\nThe Fortran program should:\n\n1. Read the input string from stdin (standard input). Since the Java code reads a single token (assuming the input is one line with no whitespace), but in the Java code's LightScanner's string() function, each call returns a token (split by whitespace). However, in the solve method, they call in.string() once, so if the input is a single line with the entire string (no spaces), then the first token is the entire line.\n\nWait, in the Java code's LightScanner's string() function, it uses StringTokenizer on the line, which by default splits on any whitespace. So if the input is a single line with commands (e.g., like \"0B1B\"), then that works. So in Fortran, to read the entire line (the first token?), no, perhaps the input line is just one token. So in Fortran, the code can read it as an input line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is directly read as a single string. So in Fortran, I can:\n\nRead the input line as a character array or a string.\n\nThe next step is to process each character in the string, building up the result string, and then write that out.\n\nThe processing logic for each character:\n\nLoop over each character in the input string:\n\n- For '0' or '1', append it to a result string.\n- For 'B', if there are characters in the result, remove the last one.\n\nSo in Fortran, I'll need to use a character variable to hold the result. In Fortran, strings can be built step by step, perhaps by concatenation, but for efficiency (though maybe not an issue here), better to use an array or a character variable with varying size. But since Fortran has fixed length variables traditionally, but with allocatable or automatic arrays in modern versions, perhaps Fortran 90/95.\n\nLet me plan the variables:\n\nLet's see. Declare a character variable to hold the input string, say 'input', length enough (since the problem might have a very long input, but maybe in the code constraints, but for the translation, just assume the length is sufficient for the test case. Alternatively, use a dynamic length method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe read the entire line as a variable length string. In Fortran 2003, we can have allocatable strings, which would be easier.\n\nFirst, the main program structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC043_B\n   implicit none\n   character(:), allocatable :: input\n   character(:), allocatable :: result\n   integer :: i\n   input = get_input()\n   result = process_string(input)\n   print *, trim(result)\ncontains\n   ! functions to get input and process\nend program\n\nWait, but getting the input: how?\n\nTo read the input line:\n\nIn Fortran, one approach is using the touchy method with read(*,'(A)') or read(*,'(A)').\n\nWait for example:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: input\nread(*,'(A)',advance='no') input  ! No, but in some compilers, but perhaps better to use the get_editvar?\n\nWait. Alternatively, to read a line, using the following method:\n\nread(*,'(A)') input_string\n\nBut 'input' must be of sufficient length. To avoid length issues, perhaps use an allocatable array in f2003. The syntax:\n\nWe could do:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\nread(*, '(A)') s \n\nWait, does that work? Let me recall: in Fortran 2003, the allocatable character variable in a read statement with '(A)' will automatically resize to hold the data. So that should be possible.\n\nSo, in that case:\n\nWe can read the input as a single line.\n\nThen process each character in 'input', building the result string.\n\nNow, the processing loop.\n\nThe processing:\n\nInitialize the result as an empty string. We can have a dynamic length string here.\n\nIn each step:\n\nDo for each character in input (i from 1 to len_trim(input))\n\nc = input(i:i) \n\nCase when c is '0' or '1': append to result.\n\nCase when c is 'B': if the result is not empty, remove the last character.\n\nThe question is how to represent the result in Fortran.\n\nApproach 1: Use an array of characters with a length tracker. For example, a character array with a variable to track the current length.\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: res_arr\ninteger :: res_len\nallocate( res_arr( 0 : len_trim(input) ), and similar)\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible length is the input length (since B can only remove characters), start with an array of length len_trim(input), and have a variable res_len.\n\nInitialize res_len to 0.\n\nThe loop over each character of input:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input)\n   c = input(i:i)\n   select case (c)\n   case ('0', '1')\n      res_len = res_len + 1\n      res_arr(res_len) = c\n   case ('B')\n      if (res_len >0) then\n        res_len = res_len - 1\n      end if\n   case default\n      continue ! ignore other characters?\n\n   end select\nend do\n\nThen, after processing all characters, the result is the first res_len characters of res_arr.\n\nThen, we can create the result string as res(: res_len), but need to manage the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to have a character array of the required length and then trim it or take the substring up to the current length.\n\nWait, in Fortran, appending each character one by one step could be done with a variable-length string.\n\nBut Fortran does not support efficient appending to a string because each append would create a new string. So perhaps an array is better.\n\nLet me think. Let's proceed with the array.\n\nInitialize an array of character with the maximum possible needed (input length, because each 'B' can remove, so the maximum is input length without 'B's, and since each 'B' only erases previous characters, the final length can be up to input_length - 2*B_count, but the maximum possible starting length is if there's no B's. So length of input is safe.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: i, res_len=0\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: current_str\ninteger, parameter :: input_length = len_trim(input)\nallocate( character(input_length) :: current_str )\n\nThen:\n\ndo i = 1, input_length\n   c = input(i:i)\n   select ... \n   case '0', '1'\n      res_len = res_len +1\n      current_str(res_len:res_len) = c\n   case 'B'\n      if ( res_len >0 ) then\n        res_len = res_len -1\n      end if\n   case default\n      continue\nend select\nend do\n\nAfter processing, result is current_str(1: res_len).\n\nYes, this would work.\n\nThen, to output the string from 1 to res_len.\n\nNow, let's put all together.\n\nNow, the program steps:\n\nRead the input string. If the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, but in the problem the input is a sequence of 0/1/B characters.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ab\n   implicit none\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: res\n   integer :: res_len = 0\n   integer :: i, L\n\n   ! Read input\n   read(*, '(A)', iostat = stat_var) s\n   ! Wait, perhaps using a different method? Let me think.\n\nWait, in some compilers, reading with '(a)' may read until end of line, but perhaps in others it's more complicated. Alternatively, better to read using a line. Alternatively, perhaps using a string of sufficient length, but in Fortran, allocatable strings can handle this.\n\nWait, perhaps better to read from stdin, possibly with a GET_LINE? No, GET_LINE is for reading command-line arguments. Wait, in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV there is EOR status, but I might just read the entire line via the following method:\n\nAlternatively, read into an already allocated array. Let's try this step:\n\nFirst, to read the entire line into s:\n\ncharacter(len= :), allocatable :: s\n\nread (*, '(A)') s\n\nThis should work in Fortran 2003. But some older compilers might not support it. Assuming that the problem allows using modern Fortran.\n\nOnce s is read, then we have s is the string.\n\nThen, current_str must be an array of length equal to len_trim(s). Assigning a new array in Fortran may be needed.\n\nLet me see:\n\nL = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate( character(L) :: current_str )\n\nSet res_len to 0.\n\nLoop over each character:\n\nThen after processing, the result is the first 'res_len' characters, so the final string is s(1:res_len).\n\nWait, for the final output, we can output current_str(1: res_len). But how to display that? Use:\n\nprint *, current_str(1:res_len)\n\nBut the problem expects the string as output. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, construct the final string as:\n\nres = current_str(1:res_len)\n\nThen, print trim(adjustl(res)) ?\n\nNo, because a character(1:10) with only 5 will have 5 chars, but in Fortran, when you print with *, the trailing spaces may be printed as spaces, which is not desired.\n\nAh, here is the problem. Because when the current_str is an array of size L, when you take the first res_len characters, the rest (positions res_len+1 to L) are padded with spaces. When printing, Fortran will output the entire array unless using trim.\n\nWait no, in Fortran, variables in a print * statement have their actual characters. If you have an array current_str(1:L) but you output current_str(1:res_len), the part after res_len is not printed. Wait, no. Wait, the expression current_str(1:res_len) is a substring. For example:\n\nSuppose current_str is 5 characters (length 5). Then current_str(1:res_len) is that subarray. So when you print *, current_str(1:res_len), it would output the first res_len characters as the string, and any extra space is considered part of the printed value. Hmm, so using the trim function?\n\nWait, if the characters beyond res_len's position have spaces, then when using current_str(1:res_len), since the substring is exactly up to res_len, the characters there won't have the following spaces. Because the substring stops at res_len.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent_str(1:5) is '01B1 ', then current_str(1:3) would be '01B', right? No, let's think:\n\nSuppose after processing, current_str has elements:\n\n1: '0'\n\n2: '1'\n\nThen 'B', which deletes the '1', so the first two positions are '0', and then maybe the next characters are whatever (since res_len is 1 now, so with the 0 at position 1, and the rest may be anything, like spaces).\n\nThus, current_str(1:res_len) is the correct characters. So when we print it, the trailing spaces are irrelevant because the substring is exactly the first res_len characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you have a character array, the array can be large, but the actual characters are just the first elements.\n\nSo, in the print *, current_str(1:res_len) should display exactly the characters up to res_len. However, when using print*, the trailing nulls or spaces may not be printed, but in our case, since each append adds actual characters (0, 1, or B's), except the B removes them. So the res_len tracks the actual length, so current_str(1:res_len) is exactly the string needed.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nPutting all together, the code structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC043_B\n   implicit none\n   character(:), allocatable :: s\n   character(:), allocatable :: current_str\n   integer :: res_len, i, L\n   read(*,'(A)',iostat=*) s  ! Adjust this line properly.\n\n   L = len_trim(s)\n   if(L ==0) then\n       print*,''\n       stop\n   end if\n\n   allocate( character(L) :: current_str )\n   res_len =0\n   do i=1, L\n      select case( s(i:i) )\n      case('0','1')\n          res_len = res_len +1\n          current_str(res_len:res_len) = s(i:i)\n      case('B')\n          if( res_len > 0 ) then\n              res_len = res_len -1\n          end if\n      case default  ! ignore other characters?\n          ! Do nothing\n      end select\n   end do\n\n   if( res_len ==0 ) then\n       print*,''\n   else\n       print '(A)', current_str(1:res_len)\n   end if\n\nend program\n\nWait but in the original code, the Java code is more strict, processing each character (since it uses the foreach loop) and the characters are '0', '1', 'B' only. So any other characters could be present? The problem may assume the input is only those characters.\n\nThus, the Fortran code can safely ignore others (e.g., the default case does nothing).\n\nNow, for input.\n\nThe read statement and allocatable variables require Fortran 2003.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the read(*,'(A)') s will read the entire line. Except perhaps, in some cases when the input is too long. Oh no, because if s is allocatable, then upon reading, Fortran 2003 will automatically allocate the correct size. But how to confirm?\n\nYes, according to the standard, when reading into a deferred-length (allocatable) character variable, the variable is first deallocated (if necessary), then reallocated to hold the input.\n\nThus:\n\ns = whatever the input string was, read in its entirety.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, for edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"0B1B\"\n\nProcess:\n\nStart:\n\nres_len=0.\n\nLoop step 1: i=1 (0):\n\nAppend to res_len (1 becomes '0'), res_len=1.\n\nStep2: i=2 is 'B', so res_len becomes 0.\n\nStep3: i=3 '1', append: res_len 1, char '1'\n\nStep4: i=4 'B' \u2192 res_len 0.\n\nThus, the final output is empty string.\n\nIn the code, when res_len is zero \u2192 print empty string. The output is a blank line.\n\nWait, in Java, the code appends '0B1B' processing would give empty string. Thus, the Fortran code would do that as well.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput: 'aBc' \u2192 processed as:\n\na: default \u2192 no change (res_len 0)\n\nB: since res_len is 0, nothing.\n\nc: 'c' is not 0,1 \u2192 ignored.\n\nSo the output is empty.\n\nWait, but according to the original program, it currently ignores all characters except 0,1 and B. So in Fortran code, the default branch is \"do nothing\". That's the same.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, when input is empty (though probably not possible for the problem), it prints empty string.\n\nAnother test case: \"01B\"\n\nProcess:\n\n0 \u2192 res_len 1.\n\n1\u2192 2.\n\nB: res_len 1.\n\nSo the result is '0'.\n\nSo Fortran code would show '0'.\n\nThus, the code seems right.\n\nNow, the only thing left is the IOSTAT handling? The read for the input could have a problem, but perhaps assuming the input is present.\n\nWe can also check for IOSTAT, but perhaps for code submission, this is not necessary.\n\nNow, Fortran's 'read' needs to read the entire line. However, in the Java code, the LightScanner's 'string()' function uses 'readLine' which yields the full line, then takes a token. Wait, but in the original code as given in the example, the code's solve function uses in.string() once. So that would get a single token split by whitespace from the line. That complicates things. Wait a second, perhaps the code is misinterpreted?\n\nWait, looking again at the Java code:\n\nThe solver's solve is called once.\n\nThe input is read via in.string() which in LightScanner's code:\n\nThe LightScanner's string() function reads the next token. So if the input line has multiple tokens separated by whitespace, it would process them one by one. But since the solve method only calls in.string() once, thus, it would read the first token of the line, and process the rest (other tokens) remain unread, which would be a bug unless the input line is exactly one token.\n\nBut given the problem context, perhaps the input is a single string with no spaces, so that the first 'string()' gives the entire line. Thus, the code should be okay.\n\nHence, in Fortran, the code to read a single string (the first token or the entire line?), but in our code when reading 'read(*, '(A)') s, it will read the entire line (until end of line) into s. So this matches the problem's requirement.\n\nWait no! The Java code reads the first token in the current line (split by whitespace), but our Fortran code reads the entire line. Which one is correct?\n\nAh, this is crucial! Depending on the problem's input, perhaps the entire line is one token (without spaces). So for example, the problem's input for the test case is like '0B0'.\n\nThus, if the input is a single token, then the Java code's in.string() gets the entire line. Our Fortran code reads the entire line (even if there are spaces?), but in the problem's context, only letters, 0,1,B. So spaces are probably not part of the input, so the Fortran code is okay.\n\nBut if the input line had a space-separated string, like '0B 1', then in Java, the first call to in.string() would give '0B' as the first token, and the second token '1' would be ignored. So the Java code will lose that second part.\n\nWait, so the problem requires that the entire input line is processed as the string? Or just the first token?\n\nLooking back at the problem. The code given in the Question probably comes from a coding competition problem (AtCoder).\n\nProblem's context: The problem is from ABC043 B: Unhappy Hacking (the class name BUnhappyHackingABCEdit). Looking up the problem statement for AtCoder's ABC 043 B problem.\n\nWait, let me check what the problem requires. Since I can't access external links now, but according to the code, the problem requires to process a string and output the remaining characters after processing '0's, '1's and 'B's (where B deletes the previous character).\n\nThe input is probably a single string, which may contain '0', '1', and 'B' characters. Thus, the entire input line is the string. Thus, the Java code's 'in.string()' is actually incorrect, because the entire line is one token, but if the line has no whitespace, that works, but in general, if the line is provided with non-space characters, it's okay.\n\nWait, the Java code's LightScanner's string() uses a tokenizer that splits on whitespace, and returns the next token. So if the input is, for example, \"0B1\", then the '0B1' is a single token, so it works. However, if the input line is something like \"0 1 B\", then in.string() would return '0', which is incorrect. \n\nWait that suggests that the problem's input is a single string without spaces, so that the entire line is the input's string. Hence, the Java code is correct because the input is given as a single token with no whitespace. \n\nHence for Fortran, we can process the entire line, which is better because it reads the entire line, which is the right solution.\n\nSo, the Fortran code would be correct.\n\nNow, coding that in Fortran:\n\nWait also note that in the original code, when 'B' is pressed, it does trimToSize, which is irrelevant in Java because in Java, the StringBuilder's trimToSize only affects internal buffer, but the actual length is just the current length. The Fortran code takes care of the result up to res_len, so no need.\n\nNow, the code's structure would be:\n\nThe program starts, reads the input string, processes it into current_str, and prints it.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe code in Fortran:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC043_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: current_str\n    integer :: res_len, i, L\n\n    read(*, '(A)') s  ! Read the entire line into s\n    L = len_trim(s)\n    res_len = 0\n\n    allocate( character(L) :: current_str )\n\n    do i = 1, L\n        select case (s(i:i))\n            case ('0', '1')\n                res_len = res_len + 1\n                current_str(res_len:res_len) = s(i:i)\n            case ('B')\n                if (res_len > 0) then\n                    res_len = res_len - 1\n                end if\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    ! Print the result\n    if (res_len == 0) then\n        print '(A1)', ''\n    else\n        print '(A)', current_str(1:res_len)\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(current_str)\nend program atcoder_ABC043_B\n\nWait. Wait, but how to deal with the print statement for an empty string?\n\nBecause when res_len is zero, we need to print nothing (an empty line), but in Fortran, if you do 'print *, ''', but how?\n\nAlternatively, the way to output an empty string is to print a character string of length zero, but in Fortran, you can also just print a format that includes nothing.\n\nHmm, in the code above:\n\nThe else clause prints current_str(1: res_len), which for res_len=0 would be an invalid substring (since for a character array, 1:0 is zero length, but in Fortran, is that allowed?) The Fortran 2003 standard allows substring expressions where the lower limit is higher than the upper, and it yields an empty string. So current_str(1:0) is the empty string.\n\nThus, we can simplify:\n\nprint '(A)', current_str(1:res_len)\n\nBut in this case, when res_len is 0, it's the same as print '(A)', ''.\n\nThus, the code can have the following:\n\nAfter the loop:\n\nprint '(A)', current_str(1: res_len)\n\nBut need to check if that works. But let me modify:\n\ninstead of the if/else, just do:\n\nprint '(A)', current_str(1: res_len)\n\nThis would handle all cases.\n\nSo that simplifies the code:\n\nThe entire Fortran program can become:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC043_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: current_str\n    integer :: res_len, i, L\n\n    read(*, '(A)') s\n    L = len_trim(s)\n    res_len = 0\n\n    allocate( character(L) :: current_str )\n\n    do i = 1, L\n        select case (s(i:i))\n            case ('0', '1')\n                res_len = res_len + 1\n                current_str(res_len:res_len) = s(i:i)\n            case ('B')\n                if (res_len > 0) then\n                    res_len = res_len - 1\n                end if\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    print '(A)', current_str(1:res_len)\n\n    deallocate(current_str)\nend program atcoder_ABC043_B\n\nThat's better. Let me check possible edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: input is \"B0\" \u2192 processing:\n\nFirst character B: res_len starts at 0 \u2192 no change.\n\nSecond '0' \u2192 res_len becomes 1. The current_str has '0' in 1st position. Thus the output is '0' which is correct. The original Java code would also do the same.\n\nAnother test case where res_len is 0:\n\nInput \"B\" \u2192 output empty.\n\nInput \"\" \u2192 but read as s of length 0 \u2192 then L=0, loop doesn't run. res_len remains 0 \u2192 output \"\".\n\nAnother case: \"0\", output \"0\". Correct.\n\nIf the input is \"0B\" \u2192 res_len after '0' \u2192 1; after 'B' \u2192 0. Output is \"\", which is correct.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n\nAnother point: the current_str is allocated with size L. The maximum res_len can reach is L (if all are 0,1 and not erased). So that's fine. For example, if all are '0's, the final res_len equals the input length, so the array is sufficient.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the characters are stored in a character array. Each assignment to current_str(res_len:res_len) = s(i:i) is correct as an assignment to a single character.\n\nNow, the Fortran does not have an issue with 'B's; each 'B' reduces the res_len properly.\n\nThus, I think this is the correct translation.\n\nNow, the final point: in Fortran, the 'read(*, '(A)') s' may have to read until end of line, but in some cases, like if there is a second line, would it read more? No. The format '(A)' reads one record, which is the whole line.\n\nTherefore, this should be correct."
