Wait row_str should be at least W characters. So in code, when reading row_str, we need to read a string with length exactly W. Alternatively, using a format to read precisely, but perhaps with the following:\n\nSince in Fortran, reading with the format '(A)' reads until end of record, so that's okay, but the row_str must have length at least W.\n\nThus:\n\n    do i=1,H\n\n        read(*,'(A)') row_str\n        do j=1,W\n            A(i,j)= row_str(j:j)\n            if (A(i,j) == '#') then\n               ... \n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\nThus: But row_str must be declared as a sufficiently large length, but when reading via '(A) it's okay.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads a grid of H rows and W columns, where each cell is either '.' or '#'. It then uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) starting from all the '#' positions to find the maximum distance (number of steps) to reach the farthest '.' cell. The answer is the maximum distance found.\n\nIn Fortran, the first thing I need to consider is how to handle the input, queues, and 2D arrays.\n\nWait, Fortran has arrays as well, but I need to declare dimensions properly. Let me note that Fortran arrays have lower bounds starting at 1 by default, but in code, we might need to specify. In Java, they were starting from 0, so maybe I'll have to adjust indices.\n\nThe main challenge will be implementing the queue. Java uses a Queue for BFS. In Fortran, since there's no built-in queue, I can simulate it with an array. Perhaps using an array to represent the queue, with a front and rear pointers. Alternatively, since the code might be manageable with the size, maybe I can pre-allocate an array large enough and track the current size. That might be easier.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read H and W.\n2. Read H lines of strings (each line is W characters long).\n3. Initialize the grid (A) and a flag array to track visited cells.\n4. Initialize a queue with all the '#' positions, each entry has coordinates and depth (initially 0).\n5. Perform BFS: for each node, check four directions, enqueue non-visited '.' cells, and track the maximum depth.\n6. Finally, output the maximum depth.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the queue is initialized with all '#' cells as they are the starting points, and their depth is zero. Each of these positions can be considered as sources. Since the BFS starts from all '#' at once, the code effectively finds the longest path from any of those to a '.' cell, but actually, BFS is needed to compute the maximum shortest path from any # to a . since all #s are starting points.\n\nWait, in the BFS, the distance is tracked for each '.' cell, and since BFS gives the shortest path, the maximum among all these would be the answer. \n\nBut how to manage the queue in Fortran? Let's see:\n\nAlternative approaches for queues in Fortran:\n\nOption 1: Use arrays. For each element in the queue, we need to store y, x coordinates and the depth. Let's say each element is an array of 3 integers. If we use an array to represent the queue, and have two pointers: front and rear, or use a dynamic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps an array with a fixed size (like H * W * 4, since each cell could have four neighbors, but maybe overkill).\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran 95/2003+ pointers can be used, but perhaps it's easier to just pre-allocate arrays and track indices.\n\nMaybe:\n\nWe have a 2D array (but 3 elements per entry... Maybe better a 2D array of some kind. Alternatively, have three separate arrays to track the coordinates and depth. Hmm, perhaps not. The easiest way is to have a 2D array (like a list of records) but in Fortran, records are structures.\n\nYes, in Fortran, we can use a derived type. Like:\n\ntype queue_node\n    integer :: y, x, depth\nend type\n\nThen have a dynamic array of queue_node. But handling dynamic arrays might require allocatable arrays and allocation.\n\nAlternatively, precompute the maximum possible size. The maximum possible elements in the queue would be all the cells in the grid, so H*W. Let's say the maximum queue size is H*W, which can be allocated at the beginning.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Declare variables H and W.\n\n- Declare the grid (A) as a 2D array of characters (needs to be 'CHARACTER*(1)' in Fortran, probably).\n\n- 'flag' is an integer array dimensioned as (H, W), initialized to 0. \n\nWait, in Fortran, 2D arrays are column-major, but for accessing them, the indices can be handled as in Java.\n\nBut since Java uses 0-based indices, I have to adjust to 1-based. So in the code, variables i and j in Java start from 0, but in Fortran, they would be starting from 1. So, in the loop over rows and columns, I need to handle 1-based indexes.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nOriginal Java code starts with H rows (from 0 to H-1) Each row has W elements. \n\nIn Fortran, I'll have rows from 1 to H and columns 1 to W. So when translating loops:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < H; i++){\n\nbecomes in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, H\n\nWait no: in the Java code, the row number i goes from 0 to H-1, so in Fortran, if we change it, the indices would be i from 1 to H. Same in the columns. So when we read a row, for each character in that row, the columns j in Java start at 0, which would become 1 in Fortran. But need to adjust indices.\n\nSo when accessing A(i,j) , the first (original Java) 0,0 becomes 1,1 in Fortran.\n\nThat's important, so all loops must be adjusted to start at 1, and H becomes H in size (since the loops go from 0 to H-1 originally). So in Fortran, the array is declared as H x W.\n\nNow, about the queue: a queue with elements of coordinates and depth. Let's declare an array of type queue_node, which is a structure with y, x, depth as integers.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran has array sections, maybe three separate arrays:\n\nWe can have three arrays: queue_y, queue_x, queue_depth each indexed by the queue position. But a structure would be more convenient.\n\nAlternatively, since we can precompute the maximum size, we can have a 1D array of integers where each node holds Y, X, depth in trios. But that would complicate access, so better to use a derived type.\n\nFirst, code steps:\n\nRead H and W, then read H lines, each line a string of length W.\n\nIn Fortran, the input would be done with read(*,*) H, W. Then, to read the grid, since each row is a string, in Fortran, I need to read each line as a character string, then assign each character to A(i,j).\n\nIn the code:\n\ndimension H is the first, W second?\n\nWait in Fortran, 2D array declarations are first dimension rows, second columns? Or columns first? Let me confirm.\n\nFortran arrays are column-major, but the order for declaring is 'dimension H, W', i.e. A(1:H, 1:W) is a H x W matrix.\n\nYes, so A is a 2D array with first subscript rows (H) and second subscript columns (W).\n\nSo reading each row:\n\nWe need to read each row as a string, then loop over characters.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps something like:\n\nread(*, '(A)') row\n\nthen DO j = 1, W\n\nA(i,j) = row(j:j)\n\nBut first check the row length is W, but perhaps the code can proceed.\n\nNow, initializing the queue. In Java, they start by adding all the # positions to the queue with depth 0. So for each cell (i,j), if A(i,j) is '#', add to the queue the element (i,j, 0). \n\nIn the queue initialization, since we are using Fortran with indexes starting at 1, then the first entry would be at position 1, etc.\n\nSo in code, after reading all A, loop over each cell, and for each #, enqueue it into the initial queue.\n\nThe BFS loop: while the queue is not empty, dequeue an element, process the four directions.\n\nProcessing the directions dx, dy. Are the same as in Java: dx is [1,-1,0,0], dy is [0,0,1,-1], which mean moving up/down (y), and right/left (x)? \n\nWait in Java's code, the rows are i (up and down) and the columns are j (left and right). So for delta in dx, dy:\n\nIn each iteration of the 4 directions:\n\nnew_y = y + dy[i]\n\nnew_x = x + dx[i]\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nWait in the Java code's loops:\n\ndx is {1, -1, 0, 0}, dy is {0, 0, 1, -1}\n\nWait no, perhaps miswritten?\n\nLooking at the Java code's dx and dy:\n\ndx is {1,-1,0,0}\n\ndy is {0,0,1,-1}\n\nWait so the four directions:\n\nThe dx and dy are for x and y directions.\n\nWait in the code for the for loop steps for four directions, the new coordinates are:\n\ny + dy[i], x + dx[i]\n\nWait in the code:\n\nfor each of 4 directions, it computes:\n\ny + dy[i], and x + dx[i]\n\nWait is dy[i] the delta for the y coordinate and dx[i] delta for x?\n\nWait for dx[0] is 1 (so delta x is 1?), so for each direction, the steps are:\n\nFor direction of index 0:\n\ndx = 1, dy = 0. \n\nSo that would be adding to x (columns) +1: moving right.\n\nWait so moving right, increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for direction 1 (dx=-1, dy=0), moving left (decrease x).\n\ndx[2] and dx[3] are 0, for moving up/down ?\n\nWait direction 2: dx[2] is 0, dy[2] is 1. \n\nWait, dy[2] is from the initial array dy {0,0,1,-1}? \n\nWait dy is during the for loop i in 0..3,\n\nlooking back at the Java code:\n\nint[] dx = {1, -1, 0, 0};\n\nint[] dy = {0, 0, 1, -1};\n\nSo for direction i:\n\ndx[i], dy[i]\n\nWait the first element:\n\ndx[0] =1, dy[0] =0 \u2192 move east (right) (x+1, y same)\n\ndx[1] =-1, dy[1]=0 \u2192 west\n\ndx[2] 0, dy[2] = 1 \u2192 north (the row increases? Wait, depends on how rows are setup.\n\nAssuming in the grid, row increases down, then:\n\ndy[2] is 1 \u2192 adding 1 to y would be going downward? Wait no:\n\nWait in terms of coordinates, in Java the rows were from 0 to H-1, so when moving down (south) would be y+1. \n\nWait, let me think: the direction where dy[i] is 1 would mean increasing y (from first index, which is row), so that's moving \"down\" (row increase) in the grid. So the four direction i=0 to 3 are east, west, south, north?\n\nYes:\n\ndx: \n\ndx[0] = 1 so x (column) increases \u2192 east.\n\ndx[1] =-1 \u2192 west.\n\ndy[2] =1 (i=2) \u2192 y increases (south)\n\ndy[3] = -1 \u2192 y decreases (north).\n\nWait direction i=2:\n\ndx=0, dy=1 \u2192 south, i=3: dx=0, dy=-1 \u2192 north.\n\nSo the four directions are east, west, south, north? Or east, west, north, south?\n\nWait the dy[3] is -1 \u2192 y decreases (-1 in row number), so up.\n\nSo:\n\ni=0 \u2192 east (east is +x)\n\ni=1 \u2192 west (-x)\n\ni=2 \u2192 south (y +1)\n\ni=3 \u2192 north (y-1)\n\nYes.\n\nSo the direction loops are handling the four directions correctly.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the same.\n\nNow, the code proceeds: for each element dequeued, we check the four directions. New coordinates new_y, new_x must be within 1 <= new_y <= H and 1 <= new_x <= W.\n\nIn the Java code's condition:\n\nif (0 <= y + dy[i] && y + dy[i] <= H - 1 ... which translates to new_y between 0 and H-1. Converting this to 1-based indices, it's new_y between 1 and H, and similarly for x.\n\nSo the condition becomes:\n\nnew_y >=1 and <= H\n\nnew_x >=1 and <= W\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (1 <= new_y .and. new_y <= H) .and. (1 <= new_x .and. new_x <= W)\n\nThen, check if the cell has not been visited (flag(y,x) ==0?) Wait in flag: In Fortran, the code in the Java initializes flag as all 0, and marks visited by setting to 1.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nif (flag[y + dy[i]][x + dx[i]] == 0 && A[y + dy[i]][x + dx[i]] == '.')\n\nSo two conditions:\n\nThe cell is '.' , and not yet visited (flag is 0).\n\nWhen enqueuing, we set the flag to 1 (marking as visited) so no other entry in the queue can process it again, ensuring BFS proceeds correctly.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the same condition, compute new coordinates (ny, nx) and check if within bounds, then check:\n\nA(ny, nx) is '.' (char is '.')\n\nand flag(ny,nx) is 0.\n\nIf so, we set flag[ny,nx] to 1, and add the new position (ny,nx, depth +1) to queue.\n\nAlso, the ans variable is updated to the maximum between current ans and depth+1.\n\nWait, in the Java code, in the line:\n\nans = depth +1;\n\nWait, that might be the problem. Because in the original code's 'ans' is updated each time, but if multiple cells are added with different depths, the last one to be processed (since the queue is FIFO) would have the highest depth?\n\nNot exactly. Because BFS proceeds level by level, so the last node processed in the queue will indeed have the maximum depth, since it's the furthest away from any starting # location.\n\nThus, by storing ans as the current depth each time, the last occurrence will be the maximum.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can do the same: each time a cell is processed (enqueued), ans is assigned depth +1.\n\nBut need to make sure that it captures the maximum. Wait: perhaps not. Because depth increments every step. Since BFS proceeds in BFS order, the last entry processed would have the largest depth. Because in BFS, each step is processed level by level.\n\nWait, suppose multiple nodes have the maximum depth. Since they are enqueued after the initial ones, their depth would be the same, so overwriting ans with that value every time would accumulate the correct max.\n\nAlternatively, since ans is initially 0, and each time we enqueue, if the current depth is larger, it can be kept as the maximum.\n\nWait perhaps better to write ans = max(ans, depth+1). Because if we have depth=10 and then later comes depth=15, this would ensure ans is stored as 15. \n\nIn the original code:\n\nans is initially 0, and it's being overwritten each time to \"depth +1\". So, in fact, it will store the last depth, which is the maximum possible?\n\nBecause when the first cell is added with depth 1, ans becomes 1. If another cell is added with depth 2, ans is 2. Eventually, when the last cell with the deepest depth is processed, ans will have that value. Since BFS visits all nodes level by level, the last enqueue is indeed the deepest.\n\nWait, but in code, ans is being assigned with every cell. Let me see in code:\n\nSuppose processing node (depth D). The loop runs for i=0..3, and for each valid cell, we do:\n\nflag[ny][nx] =1 \n\nqueue adds (ny,nx, depth+1)\n\nans = depth +1\n\nSo, for the first such cell in any step, ans will be set to the current depth+1. But if consecutive nodes in the same step (i.e., different cells added from same parent with depth D) also set ans to the same value, so the last assignment may be irrelevant. However, when the next level (depth+1) is being processed in the queue, the nodes there will have higher depth.\n\nThus, each time a new layer of nodes is processed, they can only have depths higher than the previous, so ans gets overwritten each time. Therefore, the final ans will be correct.\n\nSo in Fortran, I can code similarly, but need to have that logic.\n\nNow, back to the Fortran implementation steps:\n\n1. Declare variables. Let's think of the datatypes.\n\nH and W are integers.\n\nThe grid A will be a character array of H rows and W columns. So in Fortran, declare A(1:H,1:W), but since arrays need to be declared with dimensions at compile time or as allocatable. Since we read H and W first, they need to be allocatable or with a big fixed size.\n\nWait modern Fortran allows allocatable arrays. So in code:\n\nProgram name etc:\n\nprogram agc033a\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: H, W\n   integer, allocatable :: flag(:,:), dx(:), dy(:)\n   character(len=1), allocatable :: A(:,:)\n   type queue_node\n      integer :: y, x, depth\n   end type queue_node\n   type(queue_node), allocatable :: queue(:)\n   integer :: ans = 0\n   integer :: front, rear, i, j, current, ny, nx\n   ! and others...\n\nBut variables need to be properly declared and initialized.\n\nWait let me see the actual code structure step by step.\n\nFirst read H and W.\n\nread(*,*) H, W\n\nThen, allocate the arrays.\n\nAllocate A(H, W), flag(H, W), and the dx/dy arrays.\n\ndx and dy arrays can be constants, declared as:\n\ninteger, parameter :: dx(4)=(/1,-1,0,0/)  ?\n\nWait no, in Fortran, constant arrays can be set as:\n\ndx = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n\ndy = [0,0,1,-1]\n\nBetter to have them as module parameters, but in code:\n\ndx(0:3) would be different indices. Wait no, since in Fortran arrays indices start at 1 unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait wait, variables in Fortran arrays unless 'dimension' is declared with lower bound. \n\nWait, the dx array is size 4 elements, which can be indices 1-4. \n\nSo the code:\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: dx, dy\n\ndx = [1, -1, 0, 0]\n\ndy = [0,0,1,-1]\n\nwill initialize them correctly.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(4) :: dx, dy\n\ndx=[1,-1,0,0]\n\ndy=[0,0,1,-1]\n\nWait but in Fortran, the initializer list is enclosed in (/ /) ? \n\nYes, in Fortran 90 syntax, it would be:\n\ndx = (/1, -1, 0, 0 /)\n\nSimilarly for dy.\n\nWait so:\n\ndx = (/1, -1, 0, 0 /)\n\nWait okay.\n\nThen, proceed to read the grid:\n\nallocate(A(H, W))\n\ndo i = 1, H\n\n   read(*, '(A)') row_str\n\n   A(i,1:W) = row_str(1:W)\n\nend do\n\nWait but in fortran, the strings are read into a character variable. So need to have a temporary variable of length W, row_str of Length=w\n\nBut what if the rows are exactly W characters? Then that works.\n\nSo declaring:\n\ncharacter(len=W) :: row_str\n\nInside the loop:\n\nread (\\*, '(A)') row_str\n\nthen do j=1, W\n\nA(i,j) = row_str(j:j)\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nBut first, row_str must be of length W.\n\nWait if row_str is declared as character(len=*), it might fit but better to have determined length.\n\nAlternatively, use a temporary character*(*) variable.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to read the string into a character(W) variable, but to read exactly W characters.\n\nWait in Fortran, the format A is used. To enforce that exactly W characters are read:\n\nThe format would be '(aW)'.\n\nHmm, tricky because W is variable. So perhaps:\n\nmax_len = W\n\nin format statements, using W as a parameter.\n\nBut in the code, the read loop would be:\n\ndo i = 1, H\n\n    read(*,'(a)') row_str\n\n    A(i,1:W) = row_str(1:W)\n\nend do\n\nAssuming that row_str is a character* sufficient length, but perhaps better to have row_str as length W.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncharacter(len=W) :: row_str\n\nallocate( A(1:H,1:W) )\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=1,H\n\n   read(*,'(a)') row_str\n\n   A(i,1:W) = row_str(1:W)\n\nend do\n\nBut this requires the input strings to be exactly W characters long. If padded with spaces, that's a problem. But according to the problem statement, each line has exactly W characters, so this should be okay.\n\nAdditionally, need to initialize the queue.\n\nInitially, all '#' cells are enqueued with depth 0.\n\nSo first, loop over all cells to check if A(i,j) == '#' :\n\nallocate( queue(0:H*W) ) ! maximum number of elements possible is H*W.\n\nfront=0\n\nrear=-1\n\ndo i=1,H\n\n    do j=1,W\n\n        if (A(i,j) == '#') then\n\n            rear = rear +1\n\n            queue(rear)%y =i\n\n            queue(rear)%x =j\n\n            queue(rear)%depth=0\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend do\n\nBut wait initially, the queue is empty (front=0, rear=-1). Each time we add an element, we increment rear and store there.\n\nWait but for the array, initial allocation: would need the array to be large enough. H*W is safe since in worst case, all cells are # and all are in the queue.\n\nBut allocating queue(0:H*W-1) assuming we have up to H*W elements. Wait queue(0:H*W) is okay, but index starting at 0 can be.\n\nWait in Fortran, arrays are by default indexed from 1, but you can specify the lower bound. To have an array starting from 0:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_queue_size = 1000000 ' for example,\n\nbut as the code is, perhaps better to just use an allocatable derived type array which can be dynamically expanded? But perhaps better to pre-allocate to H*W.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate( queue( H*W ) )\n\nfront = 1\n\nrear = 0\n\nthen, for each entry:\n\nenqueuing is:\n\nrear = rear +1\n\nqueue(rear)%y = i\n\n... and so on.\n\nSimilarly, dequeuing:\n\ncurrent = front\n\nfront = front +1\n\nWait maybe it's better with a circular queue. Or keep track with front and back indices.\n\nWait maybe the easiest way in Fortran is to use a linear array and track the first and last indices.\n\nWhen initially, the queue has elements added from 1 to N (where N is the number of # cells), then front starts at the first entry and rear is last entry.\n\nWait perhaps better for the queue to be managed via front and rear pointers.\n\nInitialize the queue as:\n\nfront =1\n\nrear=0\n\nthen, when enqueuing:\n\nrear = rear +1\n\nqueue(rear) = ... the node.\n\nWhen dequeueing:\n\ntemp = queue(front)\n\nfront = front +1\n\nEventually, when front>rear, queue is empty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe that can work.\n\nSo setting up the queue variables.\n\nNow, the BFS loop:\n\ndo while (front <= rear)\n\n   current_node = queue(front)\n\n   current_y = current_node.y\n\n   current_x = current_node.x\n\n   current_depth = current_node.depth\n\n   front = front +1\n\n   ... process the current node\n\n   loop over four directions:\n\n    do di =1,4 (since the dx/dy are indices 1-4.\n\n    ny = current_y + dy(di)\n\n    nx = current_x + dx(di)\n\n    Wait wait, in the Java code, the dx and dy are array elements. Let's check again:\n\n    dx(1) is the first element of dx: in our code, dx was set to (1, -1, 0,0). Because in Fortran:\n\ndx = [1, -1, 0,0 ] when declared as a 4-element array with indices 1-4.\n\nThus for direction index i from 1 to 4:\n\ndx(i) is 1, -1, 0, 0 respectively.\n\ndy(1) is 0, dy(2)=0, dy(3)=1, dy(4) =-1.\n\nWait dy is:\n\ndy = (/0,0,1,-1/). So indices 1 to 4: 0,0,1,-1.\n\nThus:\n\nfor each direction di from 1 to4:\n\ndelta_y = dy(di)\n\ndelta_x = dx(di)\n\nThen:\n\nny = current_y + delta_y\n\nnx = current_x + delta_x\n\nCheck if ny and nx are within 1<=ny <=H, and 1<=nx <=W.\n\nIf yes:\n\nif ( (flag(ny, nx) == 0 ) .and. (A(ny,nx) == '.' ) ) then.\n\n    flag(ny,nx)=1\n\n    rear = rear +1\n\n    queue(rear)%y = ny\n\n    queue(rear)%x = nx \n\n    queue(rear)%depth = current_depth +1\n\n    ans = current_depth +1\n\n end if\n\nend do over di=1 to4\n\nend processing the current node.\n\nWait, but code in Java's code for the flag:\n\nIt checks if flag is 0 and the cell is '.'.\n\nWait important that the cell is '.' because the starting points were '#' which are not '.' and the first cells processed are '.'s.\n\nWait the BFS moves from the starting positions (all #) to the '.' cells. So direction moving through a cell only if it is '.'.\n\nBecause '#' cells have already been processed (the initial ones are in the queue's starting so not enqueued again since flag would already be set? Let me think.\n\nWait initially, the flag array is all 0 except for the cells with '#'?\n\nNo, in the Java program, the flag array is initialized as all zeros.\n\nWait the 'flag' array is only marked when a cell is enqueued, so for the starting '#' cells which are enqueued, are their flags set?\n\nNo. Because in the Java code, the code adds the start node (for # cells) to the queue, but does not set the flag for them. Because the code only sets the flag when a '.' is processed.\n\nWait this is a difference.\n\nAh, right! Because the flag is initialized to 0, but the 'if' statements in the loop for adding to queue are:\n\nflag[ny][nx] ==0 and cell is '.'.\n\nWait in the original Java code:\n\nWhen adding to queue (when checking the new_y and new_x):\n\n- It checks the new cell's A value must be '.' and flag unvisited.\n\nBut the original starting points (the # cells) have flag 0, but they are added to the queue without setting the flag. \n\nWait that's a problem! \n\nWait in the java code:\n\nthe starting positions (which are #) are added to the queue; but the flag array is not marked for those. Thus, when a cell with # is processed (i.e., when it is dequeued from the queue, the code then explores its neighbors. However, their paths could lead to visiting other # cells.\n\nWait but the problem says that the # are starting points and we are counting steps to reach '.'s. \n\nWait but how to handle the BFS so that # and '.' cells are properly processed.\n\nWait in the initial queue, all # positions are added, but in flag, those are not marked, even though they were added to the queue. So when processing a cell from the queue (the # cell), when it comes off the queue, you consider all directions, but since the cell itself is #, the condition for adding its neighbor is only when it is '.' and flag is 0.\n\nWait in the code, the code starts with the queue having all # positions, but their flag is 0 (unvisited). But what happens when processing them?\n\nWait when a cell comes off the queue (starting with the # cells):\n\nthe code loops over the four directions. \n\nFor those # cells, their own positions (before moving) are considered in the processing. \n\nWait the current node's cell (current_y, current_x) is a # cell. \n\nSo when processing the neighbors: if the neighbor is a '.' and unvisited (flag 0), then mark it and add to the queue.\n\nThus, the starting #s can be considered as nodes that have distance 0, and their neighbors (.) at distance 1 etc.\n\nWait but the BFS works from all # cells at once. The flag is kept to only mark '.' cells which were enqueued so they are not enqueued again. The # cells are not marked in the flag, but after being dequeued once, they are never enqueued again so won't process them again.\n\nSo the flag for a cell marked to 1 means that it has been added to the queue, so it's only the '.' cells that can be queues.\n\nWait, no. Because the code's checks:\n\nTo add a cell to the queue, the cell must be '.' and flag 0. Because in the code, it checks first flag[ny,nx]==0 (so unvisited) and then ensures cell is '.'.\n\nSo the # cells themselves will never be enqueued again except initially (but their flag is 0). However, when they are dequeued, the code might process their neighbors.\n\nThe main issue is: when moving from a # to another #, the code doesn't consider that. Which is correct, because the problem wants the maximum distance to any # to reach the '.' cell, so BFS ignores going through other # cells.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the flag array's purpose is to track '.' cells that have been visited (queued), while # cells are not stored.\n\nThis way, all paths move from # cells to '.' cells step by step, and any path to '.' cells is covered via BFS, finding the shortest paths.\n\nNow back to the code:\n\nIn Fortran, the initial loop for queuing the starting nodes ( # cells):\n\nallocate( queue( H*W )\n\nfront =1\n\nrear =0\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=1 to H:\n\n   do j=1 to W:\n\n       if A(i,j)== '#' then:\n\n            rear = rear +1\n\n            queue(rear). y =i\n\n            queue(rear). x =j\n\n            queue(rear). depth =0\n\n       end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThus, the starting nodes are added correctly.\n\nThen, the BFS loop:\n\ndo while (front <= rear )\n\n   temp = queue(front)\n\n   current_y = temp%y, etc. \n\nWait, code steps for the processing.\n\nNow, after that code, the processing of four directions.\n\nWait in code:\n\nLoop variables i=1 to4:\n\nWait in the code, in the Java loop, it's:\n\nfor (int i=0; i<4; i++) { ... the elements 0-3}\n\nin Fortran, since indices are 1-4, we loop di from 1 to4.\n\nnx = current_x + dx(di)\n\nny = current_y + dy(di)\n\nBecause dx and dy for Java were dx[i], dy[i].\n\nWait wait:\n\nWait the delta_x would be dx[di], delta_y dy[di], so the code's direction for dx is delta_x = dx[i], so in the new x coordinate:\n\nx_new = x_current + dx[di].\n\nSimilarly delta_y = dy[di], so new y is current_y + dy[di].\n\nYes.\n\nThus, that will compute the new coordinates correctly.\n\nIf new coordinates are within the grid:\n\nthen:\n\nif (flag(ny, nx) ==0 and A(ny,nx) == '.' ) then\n\n   flag(ny,nx) =1\n\n   rear = rear+1\n\n   queue(rear)%y = ny\n\n   ... \n\n   ans = current_depth +1\n\nend if\n\nBut also ensuring that the new cell's flag is set so they are not processed again.\n\nNote that the flag is set before adding to the queue because once added to the queue, we don't want it to be added again. The BFS ensures the shortest path is the one in the queue.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nInitialization for flag:\n\nallocate( flag(1:H,1:W) ) when we first read H and W.\n\nset all flag to 0:\n\nflag = 0\n\nYes.\n\nNow, handling ans.\n\nInitially ans=0. Each time a node is added to the queue, the current_depth+1 becomes the new ans. Since each level deeper will overwrite, thus, the last such is the maximum.\n\nNow variables declarations in code.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nStructure of the Fortran Code:\n\nprogram agc033a\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: H, W, ans =0, i, j, di, current_depth, ny, nx, current_y, current_x\n   integer, dimension(4) :: dx, dy\n   integer, allocatable :: flag(:,:), front, rear\n   type queue_node\n      integer :: y, x, depth\n   end type queue_node\n   type(queue_node), allocatable :: queue(:)\n   character(len=1), allocatable :: A(:,:)\n   character(len=200) :: row_str ' assuming W is less than 200.'\n\n   !

So in code, when reading row_str, we need to read a string with length exactly W. Alternatively, using a format to read precisely, but perhaps with the following:\n\nSince in Fortran, reading with the format '(A)' reads until end of record, so that's okay, but the row_str must have length at least W.\n\nThus:\n\n    do i=1,H\n\n        read(*,'(A)') row_str\n        do j=1,W\n            A(i,j)= row_str(j:j)\n            if (A(i,j) == '#') then\n               ... \n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\nThus:\n\nBut row_str must be declared as a sufficiently large length, but when reading via '(A) it's okay. However, for really long lines, it could be a problem, but in programming competition context, W is within 200, so row_str length 200 is acceptable.\n\nIn the code above:\n\nWait another crucial point: in doing queue(front) when dequeuing.\n\nIn the code as written, current = queue(front) then increment front. Front starts at 1, and increments each time.\n\nAlso, the queue is allocated to H*W size. What if rear goes beyond? Well, in the problem's constraints, the number of enqueues can't exceed that.\n\nNow, are there any possible errors in indices?\n\nAnother possible problem: when initializing flag array to 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, also, in the code, when the first elements are the starting flags, but the initial nodes ( # cells ) are not marked in flag. So when processing their neighbors, the '.' cells are queued and marked in flag.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with a sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n...\n\n# . .\n\n. . #\n\n... (like)\n\nWait a test case.\n\nSuppose the input is like:\n\n3 3\n\n. . .\n. # .\n. . .\n\nBut then all the starting cells are the # (only one here).\n\nThe BFS would start there and visit adjacent '.'.\n\nMaximum distance from that # to the corners would be 2.\n\nWait ans should be 2.\n\nThis code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case when all cells are '.' would have all distance from #s to them, but no # so ans would be 0?\n\nWait in the code, if there are no # cells (HxW grid with all '.' ), then initial rear is 0 (no elements were added), so the loop does not run. ans remains 0. But the correct output would be ?\n\nWait the problem says: perhaps, the standard is that the grid has at least one #, but the problem may have edge cases. The problem's sample inputs should help.\n\nAnother point: in the queue initial allocation, it is possible that H*W is big, but in practice programming competition codes often preallocate even with large numbers.\n\nIn the code:\n\nallocate( queue(H*W) ).\n\nThen front starts at 1, and rear at 0. So initially, if no # cells, rear is still 0. Hence the loop terminates: since front (1) > rear (0), nothing executed. Ans is 0.\n\nThus correct.\n\nHmm, seems okay.\n\nNow, in the loop over four directions:\n\ndx and dy were defined as:\n\ndx = [1, -1, 0,0]\n\ndy = [0,0,1,-1]\n\nSo for each di from 1 to4:\n\ndx(1) =1: dx( di ==1 \u2192 delta_x +1\n\ndy(1) =0 \u2192 so first direction is moving right.\n\ndy(2) is 0 \u2192 direction 2 is left.\n\ndy(3)=1 \u2192 third direction, delta_y up (no, delta y is +1? Wait when added to current_y, it increases. So direction di=3: dy(3)=1 \u2192 moves down?\n\nWait direction di=3:\n\nnx = current_x + dx(3) \u2192 dx(3) is 0 \u2192 stays same\n\nny = current_y + dy(3) \u2192 +1 \u2192 down.\n\ndi=3 is moving south/down.\n\ndi=4: dy(4) = -1 \u2192 moving north/up.\n\ndx(4)=0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the code handles directions correctly.\n\nWhat about the variables: In the Fortran code above:\n\nWhen the code is:\n\ntype(queue_node) :: current = queue(front)\n\n    front = front +1\n\ncurrent is an object with y, x, depth. \n\nYes.\n\nYes I think this code should be correct.\n\nNow, a possible mistake: in the code when reading the input strings.\n\nSuppose when reading the row_str, it was declared as length W:\n\ncharacter(len=W) row_str.\n\nBecause if W is up to e.g., 1e5, that's too much.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if H and W can be up to, say 1e5, but in programming competition problems it's limited (like for AGC, perhaps 500x500). \n\nAssuming that variables are under control, but perhaps the initial declaration of row_str should be as:\n\ncharacter(len=W) :: row_str\n\nBut then, the W is a variable so the length must be made dynamic. \n\nHowever in Fortran 90/95, a character variable cannot have adjustable length except for allocatable arrays.\n\nAh, problem here.\n\nAh, row_str cannot be declared with length unknown at compile time. So to read a line of any length, you should use a variable with length sufficient.\n\nBut the input is such that each line has exactly W characters, so if W is up to, say 200, but like 1e4 could cause a problem. \n\nSo perhaps:\n\nUse a sufficiently large character variable like:\n\ncharacter(len=10**5) row_str \n\nOnly if allowed by the problem's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, use a derived type with a allocatable character, but might be complex.\n\nAlternatively read the line as a single character list:\n\nPerhaps:\n\nFirst read each line as a single character:\n\nBut in practice in programming competition context, a character array of 2000 should be enough for most cases.\n\nWait in the problem statement (given in the Java code's context AGC033 problem, the constraints are probably H and W up to say 1000 or less.\n\nAssuming the maximum W is like 1e4, then 10^5 length is manageable.\n\nBut for the purposes of code here, we might proceed with:\n\ncharacter(len=2000) :: row_str\n\nSo in code:\n\ncharacter(len=2000) :: row_str\n\nThen, when you read a row (even if longer than 2000, but per problem constraints it won't be).\n\nBut in the code, in the loop over j=1 to W, it will process correctly up to W characters.\n\nThus that should be okay.\n\nThus, the code with this correction is:\n\nprogram agc033a\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: H, W, ans =0, i, j, di, current_depth, ny, nx, current_y, current_x\n   integer, dimension(4) :: dx, dy\n   integer, allocatable :: flag(:,:), front, rear\n   type queue_node\n     integer :: y, x, depth\n   end type queue_node\n   type(queue_node), allocatable :: queue(:)\n   character(len=1), allocatable :: A(:,:)\n   character(len=2000) :: row_str\n\n   !
