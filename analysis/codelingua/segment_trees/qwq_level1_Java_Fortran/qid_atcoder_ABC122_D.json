    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what this program does. The Java code seems to solve a problem where you count valid DNA strings of length N that don't have the substring 'AGC' in them. The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to cache results and avoid recalculating.\n\nFirst, I'll Note down key components:\n\nThe main parts are the DFS with memoization and the check to ensure that the last 4 characters don't contain 'AGC' in some rotated way.\n\nSo, translating to Fortran. Let me think about data structures.\n\nIn Java, they use a Map<String, Long>[] memo array. The keys are strings, and the values are longs. Since Fortran doesn't have hash maps natively, I need to think of how to represent this. Alternatively, maybe since the strings are 3 characters, which is manageable a finite set, perhaps precompute all possible combinations (since each character can be A, C, G, T). There are 4^3 = 64 possible three-character strings. So, instead of a map, I can use a 2D array where the indices are for the current position and an encoding of the last3 string.\n\nHmm, that would be better for performance and easier in Fortran. Because handling strings as keys would be cumbersome in Fortran otherwise. So, the idea is to replace the String keys with an encoded integer. Let's see:\n\nEach character in the three-character string can be represented as a two-bit number (since there are 4 options). So for each character (A, C, G, T), assign a number 0-3. So the three characters would be a 6-digit binary number, or rather, as a base-4 number (0-3 for each digit). So, the \"TTT\" string would be 3 3 3 in their indices, which is 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48 +12+3= 63? Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps a triplet of numbers (0-3) can be uniquely mapped to an integer 0-63.\n\nYes, so encoding last3 string as an integer between 0 and 63 would be manageable. So instead of the Map<String, Long> array, I can have a 2D array of dimensions (N+1) x 64, where each element is the memoized value. That should simplify the problem. Because the original Java code uses the Memo[i][last3] where last3 is a string. So mapping that to the encoded index will allow the use of an array.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is replace the String keys with an integer encoded value. So in the code, we need functions to encode and decode between the 3-character string and an integer.\n\nThen, the 'last3' can be represented as that integer.\n\nSo the steps I need to perform for the translation:\n\n1. Replace the memo array (Map) with a 2D array. Let's have an array dp with dimensions (max N+1) x 64 (since max N is probably up to 1e5? Wait, actually the problem constraints probably aren't given here but in the original problem. But the code uses N as input. But for getting it into Fortran's array, we can probably allocate it once we read N.\n\nWait, in the Java, the code uses the memo array of size N+1. So in Fortran, perhaps we can have a 2D array memo(N+1, 0:63) or memo(N+1, 1:64). But since Fortran arrays are usually one-based, but for this, let's see. Wait, actually the size should be N+1 (since the problem checks when current == N), so indices from 0 to N in the first dimension.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to represent the initial code's variables:\n\nMOD is 1e9+7.\n\nThe tokens are \"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\".\n\nThe method isOK is checking if the last4 contains \"AGC\" directly, and also checking permutations where two letters are swapped? Wait the original code in isOK:\n\n1. First, checks if last4 contains 'AGC'.\n2. Then for each position from 0 to 2, swaps the i-th and (i+1)th character, then checks again if the resulting string contains 'AGC'.\n   Because the problem might require that no four characters can form an 'AGC' in a way that could be formed by a transposition. Like to prevent something like the forbidden substring when formed by adjacent swaps.\n\nWait the code for isOK is:\n\nCheck if last4 contains \"AGC\".\n\nThen, loop over 0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2):\n\nTake the 4-character string last4 converted to a char array. Swap the i and i+1 characters (swap positions i and i+1?), which gives a new string s. Then check if s contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait no, actually, in the code:\n\nThe code does:\n\nfor each i from 0 to 2:\n\n    create a new string by swapping the i-th and (i+1)th character in last4?\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n\n    vals[i] = last4.charAt(i + 1);\n\n    vals[i + 1] = last4.charAt(i);\n\n    then create s from vals array.\n\nSo for example, if last4 is \"ABCX\", when i=0:\n\nvals[0] becomes last4[1] (B), vals[1] becomes last4[0] (A). The other chars remain (X at position3 is still X?), so the new string is \"BACX\".\n\nWait the loop runs only up to i+1 to 3? Let me detail:\n\nSuppose last4 is a 4-character string. So last4.toCharArray() is length 4. So when i is 0,1,2.\n\nSo when i is 0:\n\nswap the 0 and 1 character.\n\ni=1: swap the 1 and 2.\n\ni=2: swap 2 and 3.\n\nThese are all adjacent swaps. So for each possible adjacent pair, swap them and check the new string.\n\nHence, the resulting string s after swapping must not contain 'AGC' in its sequence. So this way, the four characters in the original string can't be rearranged to form \"AGC\" in any adjacent swaps, thereby preventing sequences like AXXGC, which could have a forbidden substring formed through an adjacent swap. I think this is to handle the case where by permuting some adjacent characters, you can form \"AGC\", so the permuted string counts as invalid.\n\nHence, in the isOK function, the original code ensures that any such transformations do not allow \"AGC\" in the resulting string\u2014so that the current partial sequence is not forbidden in any possible way.\n\nSo in the Fortran version, for a given substring of 4 characters, the isOK function must be implemented with the same logic. But since in the memoization we track the last 3 characters, when adding a new character C, the resulting last 4 would be the previous last3 + C. The isOK function checks this last4 and the possible swaps.\n\nSo, moving to the translation:\n\nOverall structure:\n\nThe main function would read N (using Fortran's input methods).\n\nThe memo table can be represented as a 2D array, say memo(0:N, 0:63) for the 64 possible codes, initialized to some invalid value (e.g., -1).\n\nThe recursive function would need to be reworked into a memoized approach with loops (since Fortran can handle recursion, but for N up to say 50, but if N is large like thousands, recursion might hit stack limits. The original code is written in Java which handles recursion better, but maybe the problem's constraints are small enough. Alternatively, since this is DP, it might be better written iteratively. But original is DFS with memo. So maybe in Fortran it's manageable if using memoization properly.)\n\nWait but Fortran versions - Current Fortran standards (90, 2003, etc.) handle recursion, but if N is up to say 1e5, then a recursion depth of 1e5 would cause stack overflow. So perhaps in the original code, since it's memoized, it uses memoization to avoid redundant steps, but recursion for N up to like 1e5 would be problematic in terms of stack depth.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem constraints for which this code is a solution have a maximum N of, let's say, like 1e5? Maybe not. Wait the problem might be of the type where N is up to 1e5 or 1e6, but then in that case, a recursive approach is not feasible in any case except when optimized with memo. Alternatively, perhaps the N given is small. But let's proceed, and think of code for the given Java's approach.\n\nAssuming that the code can work with the memo array, perhaps up to some manageable N (like 1e5 may require a deep call stack). Maybe in the original problem's constraints, N is small. For the purpose of translation, I have to proceed with the code's logic as given.\n\nNow, the main functions to translate are the dfs and the isOK functions.\n\nFirst, encoding the three-character string into an integer. Let me think:\n\nEach character can be A, C, G, T, which is 0,1,2,3.\n\nSuppose the order is A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.\n\nThen, for a string like \"TTT\" (all Ts), it would be 333 in digits, the code would be (3)*16 + (3)*4 + 3 = 3*(16+4+1)= 3*21=63? Wait base 4?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nEach character is a digit in base 4.\n\nThe leftmost character (most significant digit) is the first character in the string, so for a string s = \"ABG\":\n\nCharacters: A, B, G.\n\nWait wait, but in our case the three characters, the order is the last three characters. The key is the last three letters.\n\nFor the encoding, let's think of the encoding as:\n\ncode = (char1 * 4^2) + (char2 *4) + char3).\n\nchar1 is the first character in the string (the earlier among the three), so for \"ABC\", it's 0*16 + 1*4 +2 = 6.\n\nThus, the function to encode a three-character string would need to take each character, convert to its index (0-3), then compute the code.\n\nSo we need to write a helper function to convert a string to the code, and vice versa.\n\nWait in Fortran, strings can be manipulated with subscripts. In this case, Fortran strings are type character (LEN=3), etc.\n\nWait perhaps using a function like code = encoding(s) where s is a 3-length string, and code computed as above.\n\nAlternatively, for passing parameters in the recursive function (DFS), perhaps the code (integer) is easier to handle than the string.\n\nSo in DFS, instead of passing a string, we can pass the code (integer representing the 3 characters). Thus, the code can be passed as an integer argument, and we can manipulate it.\n\nWait but in the original Java code, the keys are the strings. So the memo array in Java uses the Strings as keys, but in Fortran's memo array, since we can represent that as an integer code, we can replace the first dimension (current step) with N+1 elements, and the second dimension as the codes (0 to 63). That way, accessing memo[current_position][code] will retrieve the stored value, or store the computed value.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the memo array can be a 2D array of size (max N + 1) x 64 (since there are 4^3 =64 possibilities for the last3 code).\n\nSo, steps:\n\nImplementing encoding:\n\nFunction get_code(s) which takes a three-character string and returns an integer between 0-63.\n\nSimilarly, a function get_char(c, position) -> char, but perhaps not needed, except when within isOK function.\n\nWait in isOK function, the steps require to process the last4 string (the previous three characters plus the new character to add).\n\nWhen adding a character c (one of the tokens A, C, G, T) to the last3 string, then the new last4 is last3 + c. Wait, no, the function isOK is not exactly that.\n\nWait, the isOK function in Java's code checks if the current \"last4\" (which is the concatenated last3 plus the candidate new character c? Wait the parameters of isOK in the code:\n\nIn the dfs loop:\n\nfor each c in tokens:\n\n   if (isOK( last3 + c ) )\n\nSo the input to isOK is the last4 string = last3's current string plus the character c. The function then checks:\n\n- That this 4-character string doesn't contain \"AGC\"\n\nalso, for each possible adjacent swap in the last4, check if the resulting string contains \"AGC\". If any of these is true, return false (invalid).\n\nWait the function isOK argument is a four-character string.\n\nWait in the Java code's isOK, the parameter is a four-character string (since the original variable last4 is passed). The code's input to isOK is last3 + c; the last3 is three characters, concatenated with a fourth, creates a four-character string. So the isOK function is given a four-character string and checks both the current string and the string after swapping adjacent characters.\n\nHence, in Fortran, the isOK function will need to process a four-character string, given as input, and return a logical (boolean) value.\n\nTherefore, S in the function is a string of 4 characters. To perform the swap steps.\n\nSo the steps for converting the isOK logic to Fortran.\n\nFirst, in the isOK function (takes a four-letter string):\n\nCheck if substring \"AGC\" is present anywhere. Since the string is four characters long, this is possible if the first three letters form \"AGC\", or letters 2-4 (positions 1-4?), wait indices are different. Let's think in terms of 1-based indices.\n\nSuppose the characters are s(1), s(2), s(3), s(4).\n\nCheck if the substring s(1:3) is \"AGC\" (characters s(1)=='A', s(2)=='G', s(3)=='C'), or s(2:4) is 'G', 'C'? Wait no, the substring needs three letters. Let me think:\n\nWait the four letters can have \"AGC\" at position 0-3 (like positions 1-3?), so the possible positions in the four-letter string are:\n\npositions 1-3 (characters 1,2,3),\n\npositions 2-4 (characters 2,3,4).\n\nSo check whether any of these three-linestring contains \"AGC\".\n\nWait in Java, 'last4' is a string, then \"AGC\" may appear in the first three characters (like first three letters A-G-C, then 'C' may be first three?), so code:\n\nString s = last4;\n\nif ( s.contains(\"AGC\") ) then return false;\n\nthen, after that, swap each pair of adjacent characters, check again each modified s.\n\nWait, the code swaps i and i+1 for i in 0-3? Wait the loop runs for i from 0 to 2, since in the code, when last4 has 4 characters:\n\nfor (i=0; i < 3; ++i):\n\nso i can be 0,1,2 \u2192 indexes up to 2 (since i+1 is 1, 2, 3 respectively).\n\nWait since the loop is for the first three positions to swap.\n\nWait when you swap characters at position i and i+1 (0-based vs Fortran's 1-based strings).\n\nWait the code in Java works with 0-based strings.\n\nWait in Java, the loop variables might be 0-base.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nIn the isOK function's Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; < 3; ) \u2192 loop runs three times, i from 0 \u2192 2 inclusive.\n\nEach iteration swaps the characters at positions i and i+1 (indices are 0-based).\n\nThe new string s is created by swapping these adjacent characters.\n\nThe code then checks if the new string s contains \"AGC\".\n\nSo in the swapped strings, each one must not contain \"AGC\".\n\nIn the Fortran code, the same logic applies.\n\nThus, the four-letter string passed into isOK is s, a character array (Fortran's 4-character string).\n\nThe Fortran code for isOK:\n\nFUNCTION isOK(s) RESULT(okflag) \n  character(4) :: s\n  logical :: okflag\n\n  okflag = .true.\n\n  ! Check original s for AGC\n  if (s(1:3) == \"AGC\" .or. s(2:4) == \"AGC\") then \n    okflag = .false.\n    return\n  end if \n\n  ! Now check all swapped adjacent pairs\n  do i = 1, 3 ! Positions 1 to 3, since swapping at i and i+1 where i is from 1 to 3-1 ? Wait need to match Java's logic.\n\nWait in Fortran, loops are 1-based here, perhaps.\n\nWait the loop in the Java code loops from 0 < i < 3 \u2192 three times, so i = 0 \u2192 i=2 (0-based).\n\nSo in Fortran, need i runs from 1 to 3, but with adjustments:\n\nWait in the original loop, the positions are affected.\n\nFor each i in 0,1,2 (Java's 0-based loop):\n\nthe ith and (i+1)th position of the string are swapped.\n\nThe new string is created. then check for \"AGC\".\n\nIn Fortran's 1-based positions:\n\nwhen the original i is 0 \u2192 corresponds to swapping 1st and 2nd character.\n\ni=1 \u2192 swap 2nd and 3rd,\n\ni=2 \u2192 swap 3rd and 4th character.\n\nWait the four characters are positions 1-4, and swapping 3rd and 4th (i=0's first step?)\n\nWait in code:\n\nFor Fortran s(1), s(2), s(3), s(4).\n\nFor Java i from 0 to 2 \u2192 the positions to be swapped are:\n\nJava i = 0 \u2192 swap character 0 and 1 \u2192 positions 1 and 2 in Fortran.\n\ni =1 \u2192 swap 1 and 2 \u2192 positions 2,3 \u2192 in Fortran.\n\ni=2 \u2192 swap 2 and 3 \u2192 positions 3 and 4 in Fortran.\n\nHence in Fortran, we loop over possible swaps at indices 1-3 (the end indices).\n\nThus, for each i from 1 to 3 in loops \u2192 because 1-based.\n\nWait correction: the number of iterations is three because in the original Java loop.\n\nWait the loop runs 3 times (indices 0 to 2). So in Fortran, the do loop is from 1 to 3 (i=1,2,3).\n\nWait in Fortran code:\n\n   do i = 1,3\n\n        ! create new string with swap of i and i+1 ?\n\nWait Not exactly. Wait in code, to create a copy of the array, swap the i and i+1 elements of the string.\n\nWait in the Java code, they create a new char array (vals) from the string's characters, swap the ith and (i+1)th elements, then form a new string s.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can create a temporary array, copy the characters, swap the positions, check, then proceed.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ninside isOK function:\n\n   temp_chars = s(1:4) 's is a character variable ?\n\nWait in Fortran, it's easier to use characterize:\n\nLet me write:\n\n  character(4) s, temp\n  temp = s\n\nBut since assigning to a string is easy.\n\nWait perhaps:\n\ntemp = s\n\nthen, swap characters at positions (i) and (i+1) in temp, then check.\n\nWait for each i from 1 to 3:\n\n    Loop through i from 1 to 3:\n\n        temp = s \n\n        swap the characters at positions (i) and (i +1) in temp.\n\n        Then check if the resulting temp string contains \"AGC\" in any possible substring.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait after swapping, you need to check if any three-character substring (of the new temp string) contains AGC.\n\nWait the swapped string is of length four. So check for \"AGC\" in its substrings as before:\n\nso after the swap:\n\n    if ( temp(1:3) == 'AGC' .or. temp(2:4) == 'AGC' ) then \n\n         okflag = .false.\n\n          return \n\n    end if \n\nWait but in this code, the swapping is done for a particular i. So, for each i, after swapping, check the new string temp.\n\nIf any of these swapped strings contains \"AGC\", then the original string is invalid, so the function returns false.\n\nWait, the logic in the Java is: does swapping any pair of consecutive characters in the original string lead to the substring \"AGC\" appearing anywhere?\n\nThus, the loop is over each possible adjacent swap, and check the resulting string.\n\nIf any of those swaps create a string containing \"AGC\" in any possible triplet, then the original is invalid.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, 3\n\n    temp = s\n\n    ! swap i and i+1 characters (1-based)\n\n    ctmp = temp(i+1:i+1) \n\n    temp(i+1: i+1) = temp(i:i)\n\n    temp(i:i) = ctmp\n\n    ! now check this temp string.\n\n    if ( temp(1:3) == 'AGC' .or. temp(2:4) == 'AGC' ) then\n\n        okflag = .false.\n\n        return \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nIf any of those swaps result in a bad string, return false.\n\nElse continue.\n\nSo in this way, the function can compute the required condition.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Fortran: need to define an auxiliary function isOK that takes a four-character string and returns a logical.\n\nAnother thing is that, in the original code, when building the DFS steps, when you choose a new character c (each of the tokens), you append it to last3, making a four-character string (last3 + c), then check whether isOK( that string ) is true. Only then, you proceed into the next step.\n\nBut the next step uses last3's state. When moving forward, after adding c, the next last3 becomes last3(2:3)+ c.\n\nWait, the original code after incrementing current, the next's last3 is last3.substring(1,3) + c.\n\nWait in Java, the last3 is a string consisting of the last 3 characters before adding c. Then adding the new character gives a 4-character string, but after, the next state uses the last three of the new four: which would be taking from characters 1: last3's last three? Hmm.\n\nWait in code:\n\nlast3 is the string representing the previous three characters. When adding a new character c, the next last3 is the substring from index1 (second character onward) + C.\n\nSo if last3 is \"TTC\", and adding 'G', then the new last3 is \"\"TC\" + G\" \u2192 \"TCG\".\n\nSo the current's next string's last three characters are the last three of the previous's last3 plus the new character. Hence, in Fortran terms, when last3 is stored as a three-character string, appending the new character C, dropping the first, becomes: last3[2:3] & newChar.\n\nWait thus, the function dfs increments current and computes newLast3 = Strings from the original last3 (indexes 1 and 2?) plus the new character.\n\nBut stored as an integer code, this would be done by compressing the resulting three-character string into its new code.\n\nHence, to compute the new code, given the previous code (lastThreeCode) and the character c added (char_val).\n\nWait let me see:\n\nThe previous code is represented as an integer. Let me recall how the integer code is formed:\n\nfor code = a*16 + b*4 + c;\n\nEach part is the first character, second, third.\n\nSo, to get new code when we add a new character 'd' (char_val), the new last three characters ( after adding d to the current 3 ) would be:\n\nold second character \u2192 new first,\n\nold third \u2192 new second,\n\nnew character \u2192 new third.\n\nSo the formula for newCode:\n\noldCode is (a)*16 + b*4 + c. the next character's value is d.\n\nso the new three characters are b, c, d \u2192 newCode = (b)*16 + c*4 +d.\n\nHence, the formula for the new code can be computed without reconstructing the string.\n\nTherefore, in the DFS when we compute the new last3 code:\n\n// prevCode was the previous code (last3's encoded value)\n\n// the new character's value is char_val (0-3)\n\n// the new code is newCode = (shift left by two bits) (since each char is 2 bits?) \n\nWait, alternatively, extracting a/b/c from the previous code:\n\nLet me think:\n\ncurrent code is: a*16 + b*4 +c \u2192 the digits are the first character (a), second (b), third (c).\n\nThe new characters are b, c, new_char (d).\n\nThe value of the new code should be:\n\nnew_val = ( (a<<2) + b ) << 2 shifted? Wait perhaps:\n\nWait new_val is ( (b * 4 + c )*4 ) +d? Let me see: No.\n\nWait the new new_val is b * 16 (4^2) + c*4 (4^1) + d*1 (4^0).\n\nYes, because:\n\nEach each position in the code is a digit in a base-4 number. So the first character in the old code (a) is the most significant (4^2). The second (b) is in the middle (4^1), the third (c) is 4^0.\n\nFor new, the new three characters are:\n\nSecond and third (b,c) and the new character d.\n\nSo:\n\nnewCode = (b)*16 + (c)*4 + d )\n\nSo, the newCode can be calculated by getting the old code and shifting right two bits (to drop the first digit a) and then shift left by two and add the new digit d.\n\nAlternatively, since:\n\nPrevious code was:\n\noldCode = (a) *16 + (b)*4 + c \u2192 we can write this as (a)*4^2 + b *4^1 + c*4^0.\n\nSo when we drop 'a', the leading digit is b, and append d as third digit:\n\nnewCode = (b * 4^2) + (c *4^1) + d*4^0 \u2192 the newCode is (b * 16 + c*4 + d).\n\nSo how can we get b and c from oldCode?\n\nWell, the b is (oldCode div 4) mod 4.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nLet me see:\n\ndecomposing oldCode into a,b,c:\n\n- a = oldCode / 16 (since 16 is 4^2).\n\n- rem is oldCode % 16 \u2192 rem = b*4 + c.\n\n- b = (rem)/4 \u2192 (oldCode //4) mod 4 or ( (oldCode mod 16) ) /4 )\n\n- c = rem mod 4 (oldCode mod4).\n\nThus:\n\nb = (oldCode / 4) mod4 \u2192 divided by 4 gives (a*4 + b) \u2192 but then take mod4? Wait maybe:\n\nWait oldCode divided by 4 gives ( (a*4\u00b2 + b*4 +c)/4 ) = a*4 + b + (c)/4. Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to compute b and c as:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me code in terms of Fortran variables.\n\noldCode is an integer, e.g. 4* oldCode is divided.\n\nWait maybe:\n\nb = ( oldCode ) /4 mod4 \u2192 no, since e.g., if oldCode = a*4\u00b2 + b*4 +c,\n\nthen oldCode//4 \u2192 (a*4\u00b2 +b*4 +c) //4 \u2192 a*4 + b + int( (c)/4 ) \u2192 c can be up to 3, so floor(c/4) is 0. Hence, the result is a*4 +b.\n\nSo (a*4 +b). mod4 \u2192 This gives b mod4?\n\nWait that gives (a*4 +b ) mod4 \u2192 the a*4 drops mod4, so remains b mod4 \u2192 b.\n\nYes. So ( (oldCode)//4 ) mod4 \u2192 gives b.\n\nSimilarly, c = oldCode mod4.\n\nSo, given b and c, plus the new character's value (d), newCode is (b*16)+ (c*4 +d).\n\nYes, since:\n\nb*4\u00b2 + c*4 +d \u2192 16 is4\u00b2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnewcode = b*16 + (c*4 + d).\n\nTherefore, in the functions, the new code can be calculated without reconstructing the string.\n\nSo now, the plan for the DFS:\n\nWe need to, for each step, current position, and current code representing the last three nucleotides, generate all possible next characters (A, C, G, T).\n\nFor each such character (char_dna, with value d_val, 0 to3):\n\nConstruct the future code's next three nucleotides as:\n\nThe next code is newCode: as computed above.\n\nBut first, need to check if the new four-letter string (the previous three plus this new char) is OK.\n\nWait no, we cannot just rely on the newCode because the four-letter string includes the previous three + the new character. So, the four-letter string is:\n\nThe string corresponding to the old code (a characters) plus the new d character.\n\nWait more precisely, the four letters are: the current three letters represented by oldCode (a, b, c \u2192 a is first letter of last3's first character, so the string is \"abc\" (a=0\u2192 A etc.), so the new four is \"a b c [d]. So the four-character string's first three are a b c, last four are a b c d.\n\nWhen replacing or when the isOK is called, the argument is the four letters \u2192 which is the 3-old's + d character.\n\nTo get those four letters, the oldCode's three chars (a, b, c) + the new character (d), so:\n\nTo form the four letter string S, which needs to be passed to isOK.\n\nThus, the code to form the four-character string can be done either by decoding the oldCode and then appending the new char, or perhaps through integer values.\n\nWait let's think:\n\nThe four-character string's code can be seen as (a) , b, c, d. So the four chars, their components.\n\nTo form the S string for isOK, the first step is to create the four-character string, so we need to decode the three-character code into the individual characters (a, b, c), and add the new character.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to precompute all possible codes and their corresponding strings, but for that, since there are only 64 codes, perhaps we can store arrays for the first, second, third character of each code.\n\nBut that may be complex.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nTo decompose oldCode to get the three letters (a, b, c):\n\na = mod( (oldCode / 16),4 )\n\nb = mod( (oldCode /4 ),4 )\n\nc = oldCode mod4 \n\nthen the four-character string s_str would be made of:\n\nchars = a, b, c, d\n\nThus, each of a,b,c,d is 0-3, representing A(0), C(1), G(2), T(3).\n\nThus, each of those numbers can be mapped to a character via a mapping array.\n\nThus, we can have a character array (char(0:3) = 'A','C','G','T').\n\nSo in code:\n\ncharacter(len=4) s\n\ns(1:1) = base_char(a)\n\ns(2:2) = base_char(b)\n\ns(3:3) = base_char(c)\n\ns(4:4) = base_char(d)\n\nThen isOK(s) is evaluated. \n\nWait yes, that would be done each time.\n\nAlternatively, create a function to get_char which converts a number (0-3) to character.\n\nThis might be manageable.\n\nSo, the base array is: base_char(0) = 'A', 1: 'C', 2: 'G', 3: 'T'.\n\nThus:\n\ncharacter(4) :: s_fort\n\ns_fort(1) = base_chars(a)\n\ns_fort(2) = base_chars(b)\n\ns_fort(3) = base_chars(c)\n\ns_fort(4) = base_chars(d)\n\nThen pass s_fort into isOK(s_fort).\n\nNow the steps.\n\nSo in DFS, given the current step (current) and current_code (integer):\n\nWe check if memo is already present for that state (current, current_code). The memo is a 2D array where memo(current+1)[code], but in Fortran, arrays usually start at 1. Wait need to see the indexing.\n\nNow, design of the memo array.\n\nLet us represent memo as a two-dimensional array:\n\ninteger, dimension(N_max, 64) \u2192 where N_max is N (since up to N steps).\n\nWait in Fortran, the first index is current_step (0-based?), up to N.\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nThe memo array is of length N+1. The first element corresponds to step 0 up to N.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the memo array can be declared as 0 : N in rows (indices 0 to N), and 0-63 in columns, but since Fortran often uses 1-based arrays, perhaps starting at 1 for step and codes starting at 0.\n\nThus:\n\nSuppose the memo array is set as:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: memo(0:N,0:63) \n\nsince in Fortran, the parentheses can be with ubound including the max (0:N is allowed).\n\nWait but I need to check the 0: yes in fortran, you can have arrays starting at zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can shift:\n\nmemo(1:N+1, 1: 64). So step 0 \u2192 1, etc.\n\nBut for ease, let's suppose using 0-based indices for the first dimension:\n\nBut in Fortran, variable-length arrays can be declared with allocatable.\n\nSo in the driver code, after reading N:\n\nallocate( memo( N+1, 0:63 ) )\n\nthen memo(0,:) is for the 0th step.\n\nThus, in the code:\n\nThe memo is initialized to -1, to indicate uncomputed.\n\nWait the question is, how to access memo and update.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nVariables:\n\nThe tokens are represented via the four characters. Additionally, we need a mapping from characters to their numerical code.\n\nWait perhaps create a character array for base:\n\ninteger, parameter :: N_BASE=4\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(0:N_BASE-1) :: BASE_CODES = (/'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'/)\n\nThen, to get the character from its index, use base_codes(i).\n\nFor code to characters:\n\nTo decompose a three-character code into a, b, c (indices 0-3 each):\n\na_val = (oldcode /16) mod4 \u2192 (oldcode//16) mod4 (since 16=4^2)\n\nb_val = (oldcode//4 ) mod4 \u2192 (oldcode divided by 4, then mod 4).\n\nc_val = mod(oldcode,4). \n\nthus, writing a function:\n\nsubroutine decode(oldcode, a, b, c)\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: oldcode\n\n    integer, intent(out) :: a, b, c\n\n    a = mod( oldcode /16 ,4 )\n\n    b = mod ( oldcode /4 ,4 )\n\n    c = mod( oldcode ,4 )\n\nend subroutine\n\nthis way we can decompose.\n\nNow, the recursive DFS approach in Fortran.\n\nBut recursion in Fortran may hit stack limits, but let's assume for now the N is small (original code's author probably thinks N is acceptable).\n\nThus, the finite DFS:\n\nFunction dfs( current_step, code ) result( res )\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: current_step, code\n\n    integer(8) :: res\n\n    integer :: new_dna_val, new_code, a, b, c, d, i\n\n    logical :: ok\n\n    if( current_step == N ) then \n\n        res = 1  ! base case\n\n        return \n\n    end if \n\n    ! check memo\n\n    if( memo(current_step, code) /= -1 ) then \n\n        res = memo(current_step, code)\n\n        return \n\n    else \n\n        memo(current_step, code) =0  ! or some default?\n\n        res = 0 \n\n        do i=0,3 \n\n            ! ith code corresponds to the DNA character ( 'A','C','G','T') \n\n            new_dna_val = i \n\n            ! Need to get the previous a,b,c from oldcode \n\n            call decode( code, a, b, c )\n\n            ! the four-character string is a, b, c, d =newdna_val \n\n            ! construct s as the four characters \n\n            character(4) :: s \n\n            s(1:1) = base_codes(a)\n\n            s(2:2) = base_codes(b)\n\n            s(3:3) = base_codes(c)\n\n            s(4:4) = base_codes(new_dna_val)\n\n            call isOK( s ) \u2192 and get logical ok \n\n            if( ok ) then \n\n                ! compute new_code, which is the new 3-character code (b, c, newdna_val)\n\n                new_code = (b*16) + (c *4) + new_dna_val \n\n                ! recursive call:\n\n                res = mod( res + dfs( current_step+1, new_code ), MOD )\n\n                MOD is the 1e9+7 - define as a parameter.\n\n                (Wait in Java, MOD is a long, but in Fortran, needs to be a large integer kind; using 8-byte for results)\n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n        memo(current_step, code) = res \n\n        return res \n\n    else \n\n    wait no, sorry\u2014 strucutre may need correction.\n\nWait perhaps, the problem with the first step: when the memo is initialized to -1 (say, -1 is the default, meaning uncomputed), then when accessing:\n\nif( memo(current_step, code) .ne. -1) \u2192 return value.\n\nelse:\n\nthen, for each of the four possible new_dna_val (0-3):\n\nCheck if four-char 's' is OK. \n\nThen, if yes:\n\ncompute new_code (b, c, new_dna_val), and then recursive call to dfs( current_step+1, new_code) \n\nthen add to res.\n\nWait, so the code:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the function dfs would have to be a recursive function, so we need to declare \"recursive function dfs...\" \n\nLet me try to sketch the code outline:\n\nFirst, defines:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc122d\n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: N \n\n    integer(8), parameter :: MOD = 1000000007_8 \n\n    character(len=1), dimension(0:3) :: base_codes = (/'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'/)\n\n    ! variables for memoization \n\n    integer :: N_max \n\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: memo(:,:) \n\n    ... \n\n    read( *, *) N \n\n    N_max = N \n\n    allocate( memo(0:N_max, 0:63) )\n\n    memo(0:N_max, 0:63) = -1 \n\n    ! initialize all to -1 (uncomputed)\n\n    ... \n\n    write( *, * ) dfs(0, 51)  ! initial code is 'TTT'\n\n    ! since T is 3 \u2192 code for 'TTT' is 3*16 + 3*4 +3 \u2192 48+12+3=63. So code 63. \n\nWait, the initial call is to dfs(0, \"TTT\").\n\nIn Java's code, the initial call is `dfs(0, \"TTT\")`. The code for \"T\" is 3, so three of them, code would be:\n\nThe first character (T) is a=3, so 3*16 \u2192 + (second T: b=3 \u2192 3*4 \u2192 plus third T, c=3 \u2192 total 3*16 + 3*4 +3 = 48+12+3=63 \u2192 thus code 63.\n\nWait in code, in Java the initial last3 is \"TTT\" \u2192 which is 'T','T','T' \u2192 the first character (T=3 \u2192 a=3, b=3, c=3 \u2192 code 63.\n\nThus, in the Fortran program's main call, it should call dfs with code=63.\n\nWait the function's parameters are current_step and code, initial is 0,63.\n\nWait, in the initial call, the 'TTT' is the starting state. The function 'dfs' is started with current_step 0 and code 'TTT' (63).\n\nThus, the main program calls print the value of dfs(0,63).\n\nThus, the reader should be initialized, and the recursive function should handle it.\n\nThus, the full code outlines are:\n\nBut before going deeper, let me note: the recursive functions in Fortran must be declared 'recursive':\n\nprogram atcoder_abc122d \n\nimplicit none \n\n   characterize:\n\n   declare the memo, etc.\n\n   ...\n\n   call recursive functions \n\nend program\n\nThus, I need to structure it.\n\nNow, making the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nprogram atcoder_problem\n\n  implicit none\n\n  !

Let me try to write the full code skeleton:\n\nBut let me correct the code outline.\n\nFirst, the module parts or main program:\n\nPerhaps the decode function is inside the dfs function? Not possible as functions are separate in Fortran.\n\nThus, the functions/ subroutines must be declared in the program.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be structured as follows:\n\nThe check_ok function must be external to dfs.\n\nBut in Fortran, the functions are placed in the same program unit.\n\nWait here is a possible coding structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc122d\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8), parameter :: MOD = 1000000007_8\n\n  character(1), dimension(0:3) :: base = (/ 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' /)\n\n  integer :: N\n  read(*, *) N\n\n  integer :: current_step_max = N\n  integer, parameter :: code_max = 63\n  integer(8), allocatable :: memo(:,:)\n  allocate(memo(0:current_step_max, 0:code_max))\n  memo = -1\n\n  integer(8) :: result\n  result = dfs(0, 63)\n  write(*, '(I0)') mod(result, MOD)\ncontains\n\n  recursive integer(8) function dfs(current_step, code)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: current_step, code\n    integer :: a, b, c, i, new_dna_val, new_code\n    character(4) :: s\n    logical :: is_okay\n\n    if (current_step == N) then\n      dfs = 1\n      return\n    end if\n\n    if (memo(current_step, code) /= -1) then\n      dfs = memo(current_step, code)\n      return\n    end if\n\n    dfs = 0  !

Yes.\n\nSo this should loop over four possibilities.\n\nThe code for the new_code is computed as b*16 + c*4 + new_dna_val (who is i, the new character.\n\nBut the parameters to dfs are passed as new_code, the code for the next step.\n\nThe modulo operation:\n\nModifying the count correctly.\n\nWait in the DFS function:\n\ncount is initialized to 0. Then, in each iteration, if is_okay, he adds the recursive call's result modulo MOD.\n\nWait in code:\n\ndfs = mod( dfs + dfs(...) , MOD )\n\nso every addition is carried mod MOD.\n\nHowever, in modular arithmetic, you have to take the modulo at each addition to prevent overflow. Alternatively, since each term is correct, the sum can be modded once at the end, but since intermediate steps can overflow, it's better to mod at step.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, integers may be large enough.\n\nBut since the MOD is 1e9+7, using 64-bit integers (8 bytes, which is kind=8) has enough capacity for sums up to roughly 1e19, but for N up to say, a hundred, it's manageable. But for higher N, you need modulus at each step.\n\nThus, using MOD in each addition is better.\n\nWait in the current DFS function, during the loops:\n\nThe code has:\n\ndfs = mod(dfs + dfs(...), MOD)\n\nWait in Fortran, the function's \"\"dfs\" is the result. However, during the function, when doing \"dfs = ...\", that updates the result variable.\n\nBut also, the function is also named \"dfs\", which is the current function.\n\nThis might actually create an error in Fortran variables.\n\nAh wait, the function's name is \"dfs\" and the result variable is \"dfs\". So in the loop, when it's doing dfs = something, that's fine, because it's the function's return value. \n\nBut When you have:\n\ndfs = mod(dfs + dfs(..., code) ..., MOD)\n\nBut that would be:\n\nThe right-hand side accesses the current value of the return variable (before the call), then add the other term. Which is okay.\n\nWait for example:\n\nInitially, dfs is initialized to 0.\n\nfirst iteration:\n\nSuppose the first r = dfs(...) is 5.\n\nThen, dfs will become mod(0 + 5, MOD) \u21925.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nanother dfs(...) returns 3.\n\n=> dfs becomes mod(5+3, mod) \u21928, etc.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is the base is declared as a variable with initial values inside the program.\n\nThat should be fine in Fortran.\n\nThe decode subroutine's variables a,b,c are outputted.\n\nFinally, in the initial call, code 63.\n\nThe main concerns are:\n\nThe check_ok function performs the adjacent swaps correctly.\n\nTesting when the code's dose not check.\n\nAlso, in the check_ok function:\n\nWhen the loop over i=1 to 3 (since adjacent swaps between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 characters in the four letters).\n\nSo the code for swapping:\n\ntemp is initialized to s, then swap positions i and i+1 (in 1-based).\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to confirm is the 'b' and other values calculations in decode function:\n\nA code is computed as a*16 + b*4 + c. So a= code//16 mod 4.\n\nLet me test with the example of code=63 (TTT):\n\ncode =63 \n\na= 63 div 16 \u2192 3 \u2192 mod4 \u21923.\n\nb = (63/4) mod4 \u2192 63/4 is 15.75 \u219263//4 = 15 (integer division)\n\n15 mod4 \u2192 15- 3*4 (12) \u21923. So b=3.\n\nc = mod(63,4) \u2192 63 mod4 = 3 (since 15*4 is60, 63-60=3).\n\n thus a=3, b=3, c=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test code=0 \u2192'AAA' \u2192 code is 0*16 +0*4 +0 \u21920.\n\nThus, this works.\n\nTesting code=6 for 'A C G' ?\n\ncode=6 \u2192a=0, b=1, c=2 \u21920 (A?),1 (C?),2 (G).\n\nThus, the 'decode is correct.\n\nNow, issues:\n\nIn the DFS, the code's new_code computation:\n\nYes, new_code is b*16 + (c *4 + new_dna_val).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nHence, the code should work.\n\nBut I should check other aspects:\n\nThe decode subroutine is called once for each iteration of the loop, because for each new_dna_val (i from 0 to 3), the decode must be done once to get a,b,c.\n\nWait No, inside the loop in DFS over i from0-3:\n\nThe current_code is given. We can call 'decode(code,a,b,c)' once, outside the loop.\n\nWait in current code outline:\n\nInside the loop, for each i, the decode is done again. But this is redundant.\n\nIn other words, within the DFS function's code, a loop over i=0-3 needs to get a, b, c a single time, before the loop start.\n\nAh, that's a mistake.\n\nThe decode is done once before the loop.\n\nNo, because code is constant within the function (the current code parameter).\n\nYes, the code for the current \"\"four\" is the current sibling's.\n\nWait, within the current function's parameters:\n\ncurrent_step and code are fixed.\n\nThus, the a,b,c can be derived from the code once, \n\nbefore the loop, to avoid recomputing in each iteration.\n\nThus, the correct code would have:\n\nIn the code:\n\n...\n\n Call decode( code, a, b, c ) \n\n ... \n\nthen loop over i (each new character) and construct Strings based on a,b,c and i's value.\n\nThus, this is a bug in the code.\n\nIn my code outline above, the code is:\n\nIn the DFS function:\n\n Inside the loop for new_dna_val (i from 0 to 3):\n\n  new_dna_val =i \n\n  call decode( code, a,b,c) \u2192 this is done for each i, but they are parameter and don't change.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nShould call decode once outside.\n\nSo the corrected version:\n\n inside the DFS function:\n\n call decode( code, a, b, c )\n\n then:\n\ndo i= 0,3 \n\n   new_dna_val = i\n\n   character(4):: temp_str is constructed as above \n\nThus:\n\nCorrecting this:\n\nanchor:\n\nThe code inside dfs:\n\nInside the function dfs(...) after handling the base case and memo check:\n\n....\n\ncall decode( code, a, b, c )\n\ndfs =0 \n\ndo i=0,3 \n\n  new_dna_val =i \n\n  ...\n\nend do \n\n ...\n\nthus, fix the code to only call decode once.\n\nThe previous code had the call to decode inside the loop, which was a mistake.\n\nThus, this error must be fixed.\n\nSo in the code pen outline, the code has:\n\n call decode once outside the loop, saving a, b, c.\n\nThus, the code for the function dfs should have that.\n\nHence the fixed code's DFS:\n\n recursive function dfs( current_step, code ) result ( count )\n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: current_step, code \n\ninteger(8) :: count \n\ninteger :: a, b, c \n\ninteger :: i, new_dna_val, new_code \n\nlogical :: isOK \n\ncount =0 \n\nif ( current_step == N ) then \n\n    count =1 \n\n    return \n\n end if \n\n if ( memo(current_step, code) .ne. -1 ) then \n\n    count = memo(current_step, code)\n\n    return \n\n end if \n\n ! get a,b,c \n\n call decode(code, a, b, c )\n\n ! loop through four new characters \n\n do i=0,3 \n\n    new_dna_val =i \n\n    ! build four-character string \n\n    character(4) temp \n\n    temp(1)=base(a)\n\n    temp(2)=base(b)\n\n    temp(3)=base(c)\n\n    temp(4)=base(new_dna_val) \n\n    isOK = check_ok( temp )\n\n    if ( isOK ) then \n\n        new_code = b*16 + c*4 + new_dna_val \n\n        count = mod( count + dfs(... , new_code ), MOD )\n\n    end if \n\n end do \n\n memo( current_step, code ) = count \n\n return \n\nend function dfs \n\nThis way, decode is only called once per call to dfs.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nNow, with this correction, the code should work.\n\nAnother point: in the new_code calculation, yes, correct.\n\nFinally, MOD needs to be applied upon each addition to prevent overflow and remain within the modulus.\n\nThis is done in the code.\n\nThe initial call is to dfs(0,63) which is \"TTT\".\n\nAll variables sizes should be correctly handled:\n\nmemo is dimensioned for 0:N rows, 0:63 columns.\n\nThus, if the N read is, say, 5, then memo is 6 rows (0-5).\n\nThus, the Fortran translation is possible.\n\nFinal code with those corrections will be valid.\n\n\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6808\u6ea2\u51fa\uff1f\n\nFor large N such as when the function will recurse 1e5 times\u6df1\u5c42\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6808\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\n\n\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u5982\u679c N \u662f 100\uff0c recursively.\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a N steps (\u4ece0\u5230 N)\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u7528\u5c06\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u5c42 \u6b64\u6808\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6.\n\n\u5982\u679c N \u662f\u5927\u7684 like 1e5, \u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u9012\u5f52\u6808\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a1e5,\u8fd9\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7fortrn\u7684\u6808\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5d29\u6e83.\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c if the original problem's N is large, this recursive approach may not work, and thus an iterative DP approach is better.
