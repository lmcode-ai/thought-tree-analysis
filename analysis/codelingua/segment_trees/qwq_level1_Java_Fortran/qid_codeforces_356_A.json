    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem seems to be related to handling some kind of data structure and updating answers based on intervals and operations.\n\nFirst, the main points in the Java code:\n\n1. Reads integers from input.\n2. Uses a TreeSet (left) which maintains sorted integers. The TreeSet is initialized with numbers from 0 to n-1.\n3. For each query (q times), it processes an interval [l, r] and a win value. It iterates over the elements in the TreeSet from l upwards. For each element (curr) between l and r, it sets the answer array's element at curr to win, and removes that element from the TreeSet. Finally, it sets answer[win-1] to 0 and adds that index back into the TreeSet.\n4. Finally, outputs the answer array as a string.\n\nHmm. Now, translating this to Fortran. The key challenges are:\n\n- TreeSet equivalent in Fortran. TreeSet is a sorted set, so in Fortran, maybe we can represent this as a sorted array that gets maintained. Since we need to find the ceiling (smallest element >= key), insertion, and removal, this could be tricky. Alternatively, since each element is added once and removed once, perhaps a list that's kept sorted?\n\n- Also, the answer array is straightforward, but the TreeSet operations need a custom approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Since in the code, the TreeSet left starts with 0..n-1, and each time in a query, we process the elements in the left set that are >= l and <= r. Since the TreeSet is ordered, ceiling(l) gives the first element >= l. Then we check if that is within r's range.\n\nPerhaps in Fortran, we can manage the left as an array of flags or an array that's dynamically maintained as a sorted list. Let's think:\n\nMaybe we can use a logical array to keep track of which elements are still present. Initially, all indices are present. When we process a query, we look for the first element in the left array from l onwards which is present, and then continue until we go beyond r. But how do we efficiently find the elements in [l, r]?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for small n, a linear scan would work? Because the operations in the Java code involve iterating through possible elements in the TreeSet, which are sorted. But for a given query, every element in left within [l, r] is removed. The process is:\n\nIn each query:\n\n1. Find first element in left >= l (call it curr)\n2. If curr <= r, we process it (set answer[curr] to win, remove from left)\n3. This repeats until the next element after curr is beyond r.\n\nBut how to track this in Fortran? Let's see.\n\nFirst, the fast reader part. Fortran can read with read(*,*) but since input could be multiple integers per line, maybe we'll read the entire input at once. So perhaps that's easier.\n\nThe FastReader class in Java is just to read inputs quickly; in Fortran, we can just read everything using read.\n\nNow, let's think about the TreeSet left. Since in the Java code, the TreeSet initially contains all numbers from 0 to n-1, and the queries process intervals. \n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nleft starts by adding all numbers from 0 to n-1 (the loop for (int i=0; i < n; i++) left.add(i);)\n\nSo the elements in left are the current available indices.\n\nWhen a query comes (l, r, win), it proceeds to iterate over all elements in left starting from l up to r. So in the TreeSet's ceiling(l) function. The loop runs as long as there is a ceiling greater than or equal to l, and that's <=r. Then for that element, set the answer to win and remove that element from left. So the remaining elements after that would have been handled by the next steps.\n\nThe key is that for the elements between l and r: any present in left will be processed.\n\nHmm. To represent the TreeSet in Fortran:\n\nSince the TreeSet holds all the indices present so far (those not yet removed). To efficiently track which indices are present, perhaps a logical array (present) where present(i) is .true. if the index i is still in left.\n\nAlternatively, a list (array) that's maintained in order? But since the order is needed to quickly find the ceiling(l), perhaps we need another approach.\n\nIn the Java code, TreeSet's find ceiling operation is O(logN). So in Fortran, without a built-in TreeSet, the operations would be O(N) time if done naively, but maybe that's okay for the problem constraints.\n\nAssuming n is small, perhaps we'll proceed.\n\nAlternative approach for the TreeSet:\n\nWe can use a dynamic array to keep track of the existing elements in sorted order. Since TreeSet is a sorted collection, so we can maintain a sorted list. \n\nWhen we add elements, we insert them in the right position to keep the list sorted. For our case, initially it's all elements from 0 to n-1, already sorted.\n\nThe ceiling operation for l can be done via binary search on the current array.\n\nRemoving elements (when found) would require maintaining that sorted list.\n\nSo in Fortran, here's the plan:\n\nWe'll have an array sorted_indices that holds the remaining indices in sorted order.\n\nEach time ceiling(l) is needed, we perform a binary search between the left part of the array.\n\nWait, but implementing a binary search in Fortran for ceiling(l).\n\nAlternatively, for each query step:\n\nWe can first search the sorted array to find the first index in sorted_indices where entry >= l. If that entry is <= r, then mark it to be removed.\n\nWait but this has to loop until the next entry is beyond r.\n\nHmm. Then, in each loop iteration of the While (in Java):\n\nThey first find the ceiling of l, which is the first element in left >= l, then check if it's <= r. If yes, process it (remove and set answer) else break.\n\nWe need to process all elements starting from that element, until they are still within r.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nLet me think: In the loop in Java:\n\nThey call ceiling(l). Suppose that value is curr, if curr is <=r.\n\nThen they process curr, remove it, and then next iteration: ceiling(l) again would give the next element after curr in the set >= l, so as long as that is still <= r, process again.\n\nWait, but the ceiling(l) after removing curr would give the next element after curr. So this process removes all elements in the set between curr (first >= l) and up to r. Wait, no, until it is still that the ceiling(l) is <= r.\n\nWait perhaps the loop in the Java code continues as long as the current ceiling (which is always >= l) is not null (present) and it is less than or equal to r.\n\nThus the loop removes all the elements between the ceiling(l) and (the 1st element exceeding r). Since each iteration picks the next element.\n\nSo the loop runs for all elements in left that are between l and r, inclusive. Because those elements are exactly the ones that are in the ceiling(l) sequence.\n\nWait, but how exactly are they traversed?\n\nThe first step:\n\nceiling(l) is x where x is the smallest element in left >= l.\n\nIf x <= r, it is removed.\n\nThen the next ceiling(l) is the next element after x which is >= l, and if it is also <= r, also gets removed, and so on.\n\nThis continues until the next element after X's last removed element is not <= r. Therefore, effectively, the loop removes all elements from x onwards until the next element after x would be beyond r. Therefore, the entire segment from x up to the largest element in left within r are all removed, but in the order of their elements (sorted since the set is sorted).\n\nTherefore, in the Java code, the while loop is processing elements in the [l, r] in order, and removes them all.\n\nIn this case, perhaps in Fortran, we can represent the elements in a sorted array. Then for a query [l, r], we need to find the first element >= l and <=r, then remove those elements between that element and the largest possible within r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way (if feasible) is to:\n\nStep 1: The sorted list is maintained as an array. \n\nWhen processing a query (l, r, win):\n\na) Find the first index in the sorted array where the value is >= l.\n\nb) The starting element is that value (call it curr). If curr > r, then no elements are processed.\n\nElse, then all elements from that entry onwards until the element can be as high as possible (so the current element must be <=r).\n\nDuring iteration: \n\nWe need to process the elements in the sorted array starting from that position and collect those up to the first entry exceeding r.\n\nAll those collected will be removed from the array, and their answers set to win, except the last step where they do answer[win-1] =0 and add it back.\n\nHmm but adding back win -1.\n\nWait the code, after that loop, does:\n\nanswer[win-1] =0 and adds it back to the TreeSet. Wait, why?\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nFirst, the loop runs and removes elements in [l, r] (the entire chain starting from ceiling(l)), then after that loop, two steps:\n\nSet answer[win-1] to 0 (so that its value in the array is 0, and then add it back to the TreeSet. \n\nWait so even though win is part of the group that the loop just took, perhaps the win-1 could be outside of the loop?\n\nBut the loop processes elements in the TreeSet left which were between l and r. So the current win (the parameter here) is likely not part of that, but perhaps need to consider that?\n\nWait the variable 'win' is the value input into the query. The code sets answer[win-1] =0 (so 0 would imply that it's a winning position?), but then adds it back to the set. That's a bit unclear, but perhaps this is part of the problem's algorithm.\n\nIn any case, we need to replicate this behavior.\n\nLet me think how this could be implemented in Fortran.\n\nApproach for Fortran:\n\nWe can use an integer array sorted_indices that holds the elements in left as a sorted list. We also use a logical array 'present' to indicate if an index is still available. However, since TreeSet maintains the elements in order, and we need efficient querying, perhaps using the sorted array is better.\n\nInitially, the sorted array will be from 0,1,...n-1. We can store that as an array.\n\nNow, each query:\n\nFind the first position in the sorted array that is >= l. Since the array is sorted, can use binary search.\n\nOnce found, check if the element at that position is <= r. \n\nIf yes, collect all elements from that position until the first > r (using the binary search approach). But collecting all the elements between these indices requires a loop?\n\nAlternatively, the code processes each element in the loop until:\n\ncurr = ceiling(l) in the current set.\n\nFor each iteration:\n\n- The current element is curr.\n\n- If curr > r, break.\n\nElse:\n\n- set answer(curr+1) = win (Wait in Java it is 1-based? Or 0-based?)\n\nWait Java uses 0-based indices here. In the Java code, answer is of size n, and the loop for (i from 0 to n-1). \n\nWait in the answer[curr], then the correct indices are 0 to n-1.\n\nWait in answer[win -1], so win is possibly from 1 to n?\n\nYes. The input is l and r, which are 1-based probably (since subtract by 1).\n\nWait Java code:\n\nInteger l is stored as l = in.nextInt() -1; so input is 1-based converted to 0-based.\n\nSimilarly with r.\n\nSo win is also input as in.nextInt(), converted to the Java 0-based by win-1 in the last line.\n\nTherefore in the answer array, the indices are 0-based. So when the code sets answer[win-1] to 0, that variable is part of the array.\n\nTherefore, the answer array is correctly handled.\n\nNow, in the loop over the first part (processing elements between l and r):\n\nEach curr found is part of the original left collection, so must be set to win. Because in the code: answer[curr] = win (the parameter to the query).\n\nWait, the parameter is the third input to the query. So when processing each curr, that's the current position, and answer[curr] = win (the win value from the query's third parameter). \n\nWait but the code says:\n\nanswer[curr] = win.\n\nSo the value stored in the answer array is the 'win' value (which is 1-based input, not the index).\n\nWait let me read the code again:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nin.nextInt() is the l, converted by subtract1 (the input l is 1-based).\n\nSame for r. \n\nThen the third integer is 'win', which the code stores as an int. The code then:\n\nanswer[curr] = win.\n\nBut curr is the index from 0-based (since left is a Treeset of 0-based indices). \n\nWait so the win parameter is an integer (possibly 1-based?), but stored directly into answer[curr].\n\nWait in the Java code, win's value could be between 1 and n, so the answer will be those numbers. So the answer array holds the value of which query \"conquered\" it, except when it's set to zero (the final step when we set answer[win-1] to zero).\n\nWait the code sets answer[curr] = win (the win is the third parameter). So it is the unadjusted \"win\" value here (the value as read from input). For example, if the input is 3, then it's stored as 3 into the answer array cell.\n\nWait then in order to set answer[win-1] =0, it's the index (in 0-based terms) refers to the win's index.\n\nTherefore, in the answer array, the final entries are the \"conquering\" move (the 'win' from each query that took over that index, except for the index which is win-1, which after processing a query, is set to 0 again and added back. So perhaps this is a special handling?\n\nThis logic must be transformed into Fortran code.\n\nNow, back to the algorithm for Fortran.\n\nWe'll need:\n\n- The sorted_indices array. This is maintained as a sorted list, so whenever elements are removed, it has to be updated.\n\nNow, each time we process a query, here's how it could work:\n\n1. Find the first element in sorted_indices that is >= l.\n\n   To do this efficiently, use binary search.\n\n2. Once found, we can start at that position (index in sorted_indices array).\n\n3. Iterate through the remaining elements in the sorted_indices until we hit an element > r. All those in the current position and up to (before that element) are to be processed.\n\n4. For each such element (curr):\n\n   a. Set answer[curr] = win.\n\n   b. Remove this element from the sorted_indices array.\n\n5. After processing all elements from step3, we have to set answer[win-1] to zero, and add that index back into sorted_indices.\n\n   But the index win-1 might already have been removed, or not?\n\n   Wait:\n\n   Since when you process the previous steps, you loop through the elements between l and r. Suppose the query is l = 1 (so l = 0 in 0-based), r = 3 (so r is 2 in 0-based). The current elements in sorted_indices are, say, 0, 1, 2, 4.\n\n   The loop would pick 0 (since its >= l=0) up to the elements <= r=2.\n\n   They remove all elements in 0,1,2. \n\n   Then, answer[0], answer[1], answer[2] are set to the win value. Then, answer[win-1] is set to zero. Assume the win was, say, 2 (input value, so win-1 is 1. So answer[1] is set to 0.\n\n   Then, add 1 back into the sorted_indices.\n\n   So this effectively removes those indices from the available list except for win-1's index? \n\nSo in any case, the algorithm requires that the elements selected in the first loop (all between l and r) are removed from the available elements. The final step adds back win-1 (0-based?)\n\nHmm, so that after setting all elements between l and r (in the TreeSet) to their answer, and then for the winner (win's value converted to zero based index) we set it to zero and add it back.\n\nSo in any case, after the loop, the current index (win-1) is added back to the available set.\n\nNow, the Fortran code:\n\nWe can represent the sorted_indices as an array, initially set to 0,1,\u2026n-1.\n\nSince arrays are fixed in Fortran, but if n is up to 1e5, this could be too big, but the problem may have constraints where n is manageable.\n\nWait, the problem's constraints are probably important here. But since I don't have that info, proceeding as per the code.\n\nIn Fortran, an array can be dynamically extended or, alternatively, we can handle it with a resizable array via allocatable array.\n\nWe can start with an array sorted_indices of size n, initialized as 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nAlternatively, for ease, a sorted array is kept, and then when we remove elements, we replace them with the last element and decrease the count. Like a dynamic array approach. But that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe, since the TreeSet is used, and we need to allow for removal, perhaps:\n\nStep by step for handling the sorted array:\n\nInitialize sorted_indices(1:n) with 0,1,...,n-1 (since fortran arrays can be 1-based, but the elements are 0-based indices). But we can have a 1-based array of integers, storing 0 to n-1.\n\nWait the elements stored in sorted_indices will be 0-based. Let me think of Fortran's sorted_indices as a 1-based array of size original_n (the n from input). But the elements are 0-based indices.\n\nNow each query:\n\n1. Find the first element in sorted_indices that is >= l.\n\n   We can use a loop to scan, but for larger n, that's slow. So binary search is better.\n\nSo code for binary search in Fortran.\n\nLet me think: the array is sorted, so indexes from 1 to len(sorted_indices).\n\nWait let me represent the current size of the available elements as the 'current_count' variable.\n\nInitially, current_count = n.\n\nsorted_indices(1:current_count) contains the current available indices in sorted order.\n\nWhen we need to perform a ceiling(l):\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the first current_count elements of sorted_indices to find the smallest element >= l.\n\nBut how to do this in Fortran. Let's recall the algorithm:\n\nInitialize low =1, high = current_count, res = 0.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)/2\n\n   if sorted_indices(mid) >= l:\n\n      res = mid\n\n      high = mid -1 (to find smaller index)\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid +1\n\nAfter this, the res is the first element where sorted_indices(mid) was >=l. Wait, not exactly, careful.\n\nWait to find the first element >=x:\n\nInitialize the low and high as (1 to current_count).\n\nInitialize best = -1\n\nWhnce the search loop:\n\nmid = (low+high)/2\n\nIf sorted_indices(mid) >= l:\n\n       best = mid\n\n       high=mid -1 (to see if there is a smaller index with >= l)\n\nElse:\n\n    low = mid +1 (search the upper half)\n\nSo at the end, if best is found, the first occurrence is best.\n\nWait, the first element >= l is sorted_indices(best), and the smallest such element (the leftmost one).\n\nBut since it's the TreeSet's ceiling(l), that is exactly right.\n\nOnce found best:\n\nif best is non-null (found), then the current index is best's element.\n\nWe can get position = best.\n\nBut need also to check if this element is <= r.\n\nIf so, then we can start collecting all elements from that position until reaching elements > r.\n\nThus:\n\nLet me define:\n\nstart_pos = best \n\nWe can compute the end_pos as the largest index in the sorted array <= r.\n\nTo compute end_pos, we can do a binary search for the largest element <= r.\n\nAlternatively, after start_pos, iterate through until the elements exceed r.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, once we reach elements beyond r, we can stop.\n\nThus, for all elements starting at start_pos, and onwards until sorted_indices(end_pos) <= r.\n\nThen, how many elements are there? We need to determine the maximum idx such that sorted_indices(idx) <= r.\n\nTo find the maximum index where sorted_indices(idx) <= r, that is the insertion point of r+1.\n\nTherefore another binary search for r.\n\nWe can find the upperbound's position for r.\n\nSo let's see: \n\nthe end_pos is the largest index where the element is <= r. \n\nTo find end_pos:\n\nlow =1, high = current_count\n\nresult =0\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low+high)/2\n\n   if sorted_indices(mid) <= r:\n\n      res = mid\n\n      low = mid +1\n\n   else:\n\n      high = mid-1\n\nThus, res will be the maximum mid where element <= r.\n\nThus, the elements from start_pos to res are to be processed (if start_pos <=res).\n\nSo the valid range is start_pos until res.\n\nEach element at indices start_pos to res in the array will need to be processed.\n\nOnce those are determined, the step is:\n\nFor all indices from start_pos to res:\n\n   curr = sorted_indices(k) where k starts at start_pos to res.\n\n   Need to remove each and set answer.\n\nBut how?\n\nHowever, the original sorted array is sorted, so those are consecutive elements.\n\nWait the sorted_indices[start_pos] is the first element >= l (and <=r) so we can check:\n\nAlso, if sorted_indices(start_pos) > r, then there are no elements.\n\nElse, the start and end positions give the elements.\n\nThe number of elements to process is (res - start_pos +1).\n\nSo:\n\nIf start_pos > res \u2192 no elements. So nothing to do.\n\nElse, all elements from start_pos to res in the sorted_indices array are to be removed and have their indices recorded.\n\nWe can't just delete these elements in place without reordering, which complicates things. \n\nWait, in the Java code, the TreeSet automatically removes elements, so its internal sorted order is maintained. \n\nTo do this in Fortran, the sorted_indices array can be a list which, when elements are removed, we can:\n\n- collect all the indices we need to remove (start to end_pos in the sorted array),\n\n- then create a new array, removing those elements.\n\nBut that would be O(n) time for each query which is not efficient.\n\nSo maybe the code would be too slow if n is large. \n\nAlternatively, can we use a logical array indicating presence, and a sorted list is maintained?\n\nAlternative approach with a present array:\n\npresent[L] is .true. if the element is still in left.\n\nThen when processing a query:\n\nloop over all elements >= l and <=r, in order from left to right.\n\nWait but how to collect the elements in the correct order?\n\nThis could be problematic because we can't find their order unless sorted.\n\nAlternatively, process with the initial sorted array, and for each query:\n\n- first find the indices from start_pos to end_pos in the sorted array (the positions where elements are in [l, r]\n\n- collect those elements into a temporary array (to decide what to do).\n\nBut in code:\n\nWe can collect the elements in the current sorted array between position start and end,\n\nrecord them all. Then for each of them:\n\n   set answer to win, remove from present array.\n\nHowever the problem with this is the next step of modifying the sorted array.\n\nAlternatively, when the process completes the loop for those elements, we have to remove them from the sorted array?\n\nAlternatively, the code can proceed in this way:\n\nThe algorithm steps for the query are:\n\n1. Find all elements in the current left that are between l and r (inclusive and >= l).\n\nThese elements are in the sorted_indices array between start_pos to end_pos.\n\n   For each such element (curr_val):\n\n       mark answer[curr_val] = win.\n\n       remove curr_val from the left (i.e., present).\n\n   Now, also after this, we do answer[win-1] =0, and add (win-1) to left.\n\nThe key here is, after all the elements in the query's [l, r] are processed, the current win's index (win-1) is dealt with.\n\nSo the elements to be removed are all the sorted elements between l and r (in the left's elements).\n\nSo the steps can be:\n\na) find the first index in the sorted array where element >= l \u2192 start.\n\nb) check if the element at start is > r \u2192 then done.\n\nElse:\n\nc) find the last index where element <= r \u2192 end.\n\nd) All elements from positions start to end need to be processed.\n\nBut \n\nIs that correct?\n\nFor example, if the sorted array is [0,2,3,5,6]\n\nand l=1, r=4.\n\nthen elements between l (1) and r (4) would be 2 and3.\n\nyes, their indices would be start_pos = first element >=1: 2 is the first such element (at index 2).\n\nthe last element <=4 is 3 (index 3). \n\nelements from 2-3 \u2192 2 and 3.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nTherefore, the elements between start_pos and end_pos in the sorted array are to be processed.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, perhaps the array present could be a flag, and the sorted array is maintained for efficient lookups.\n\nBut when elements are removed from the left (the current pile), the present array is marked as 'false', and we need to reconstruct the sorted array only when necessary. \n\nWait, maybe this is complicating.\n\nAn alternative approach might be better:\n\nInstead of maintaining a sorted array, process all queries with a list. \n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nPerhaps for small n (maybe up to 1e4 or so), the following approach can work:\n\nProceed as follows:\n\n- present is logical array (size n).\n\n- The first time (initialization), all present[i] = true.\n\nThen for queries processing:\n\n1. l' = l (input's l-1 in 0-base)\n\n2. r' = r-1 (converted)\n\n3. win = in's next integer (the 3rd parameter). Then win_idx = win -1 (0-based).\n\nFirst, collect all the indices between l' and r' which are present and have been in the available list.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? \n\nWe need to iterate from l' to r', but only for indices present.\n\nWait since they are sorted?\n\nAlternatively, we can loop through the indices up from l', and collect all the elements between l' and r'.\n\nWait but this is an O(r-l) operation, which can be okay if n is small.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nInitialize the present array to .true. for all elements 0..n\u22121.\n\nFor each query:\n\n    l = (from input) - 1\n\n    r = (from input) -1\n\n    win_val = in.nextInt()\n\n    win_idx = win_val -1 (so the 0-based value)\n\n    ans = answer array.\n\n    So need to process the elements from l to r which are present.\n\n    *But in addition, in the original problem, in the Java code, the processing happens via the TreeSet which has all elements present and in order, so the first element >= l is taken until the first exceeding r.\n\nWait but the elements are processed in order, but the correct sequential processing is required.\n\nWait the code in Java loops as long as the ceiling(l) is present and <= r. Each iteration takes the current's ceiling.\n\nThe ceiling(l) is the first element >= l in left. Once you remove that, then the next is the previous ceiling's next.\n\nSo the order of removal is the elements starting at first element >= l, up to the largest element (which may have been beyond that, but in r's upper bound.\n\nSo the elements processed are exactly those that are between l and r (inclusive) and are present in left at that time.\n\nAh! So the elements must be present. \n\nWait no: the elements are in the set, so when you do ceiling(l) and get an element, that is present, because it is in the set. So the elements are those >= l and <=r in the available elements. \n\nHence, in Fortran, the way to do this would be:\n\nInitialize:\n\npresent(0:n-1) = .true.\n\nsorted is not needed (maybe? because in Fortran's array iteration loop), but would require looping from l to r and then collect.\n\nWait, the problem is that you can't do:\n\nfor i from l to r where present[i] \u2192 but in Fortran, no such structure.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nYou can loop from the first element >= l (found via binary search) and iterate, but this requires a sorted array for the current present elements.\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit too involved.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nMaintain the current elements in a dynamic array. Let's use a list called 'elements', which is always kept sorted.\n\nInitially, elements = [0,1,...n-1]. \n\nEach time a query comes in (after reading l (converted 0-based) r (converted) and win_val (0-based? No, input l is converted to 0-based, but win_val from the input is not subtracted? Wait, need to be careful.\n\nThe win_val is the third parameter, which in Java code:\n\nanswer[curr] = win (the win is the value read from input, then at the end:\n\nanswer[win -1] = 0 \u2192 so the input's 'win' is in 1-based (since for example, if the third input is 3, the indexed index would be 2 (0-based). Therefore the code's 'win' variable in Java is the input's, so in Fortran, the index would be win = third input value.\n\nHence in Fortran, the 'win_idx' is third_parameter -1.\n\nSo back to the logic:\n\nFor each query:\n\n- get l as input, subtract 1 (making it 0-based \u2192 L)\n\nr = input -1 \u2192 R.\n\nwin_val = input (3rd parameter). win_idx = win_val -1.\n\nThen the action is:\n\n1. Find the first position in elements array which is >= L \u2192 this is the first element that is >= L.\n\n    This is done with a binary search.\n\n   the starting element would be elements(i) >= L?:\n\n   Find the first occurrence:\n\n   Let me use the previously discussed code for finding the first occurrence >= L.\n\n   start_pos is the index in the elements array where the first element >= L is found.\n\n   if elements(start_pos) > R \u2192 no elements, loop not entered.\n\n   else:\n\n      find the last occurrence <= R \u2192 end_pos.\n\n      the elements between start_pos and end_pos must be processed.\n\n2. For each element in elements[start_pos ... end_pos]\n\n   a. set answer(arr) to win_val (the input's third parameter).\n\n   b. remove them from the elements array.\n\n3. set answer(win_idx) to 0 \u2192 but wait:\n\n   the original action in Java is:\n\n   answer[win_idx] = 0\n\n   then add the win_idx to the elements.\n\n   However, win_idx may have been removed (if it's been in the processing).\n\n   For example, if the query's L=1 (0-based is 0) and R =3 (0-based 2), win_val is 1 (win_idx 0), then in the initial elements, the element 0 is in elements array.\n\n   The first step:\n\n   L=0 \u2192 first element is elements[0]=0, which is <= R (R here is, say, 2).\n\n   The elements between start (pos 0) and end (pos whatever it is) are processed, so element 0 would be removed from the elements array.\n\n   Then, step 3: answer[0] (the current array's value?) is set to 0, and then adding 0 back to the elements array.\n\n   Hence, the answer array has it's current value overwritten.\n\n   So the steps in order:\n\n   Process the elements between start and end:\n\n      all those elements (including possibly the win_idx) are removed from the elements array and their answer is set to win_val.\n\n   Then, the next steps:\n\n      set answer(win_idx) to 0 \u2192 overwrites the previous value.\n\n      Then add win_idx to the elements array (after sorting?)\n\n   So, for that case, the element 0 was in the previous elements array and was added to the processing (since in L<=R), but then after setting its answer to win_val and removing it (now 0 is out of elements array). The next steps would set answer[0] to 0.\n\n   Thus now, 0 is added back to the elements array again.\n\nHmm, so the code needs to:\n\n- Iterate over those elements between start and end in elements. For each, they are removed from elements and their position's answer is set.\n\nThen, after, set the win_indices' answer to zero. \n\nWait, because the problem requires that after the loop in Java:\n\nAfter removing those elements, the answer to all those elements are set to win (the current query's win value). \n\nBut then, the current code sets answer[win-1] (win-1's index) to 0.\n\nSo it's possible that the win_idx was among the elements processed and its value was set to the win_val, but after this assignment to 0, it will be 0 anyway.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nFor step 3, first we set answer(win_idx) to 0, then add the index back to the elements array.\n\n But where to add it?\n\n Since the elements array has to remain sorted, when adding a new element:\n\n find the position to insert it via bisect and insert at the correct spot.\n\n Therefore, in the steps for Fortran code, the steps are:\n\n Processing the elements from start_pos to end_pos:\n\n   For each element in elements[ start_pos : end_pos ]\n\n       set ans( element's value ) = input's win_val ( the parameter )\n\n       remove it from elements array. (there is work here: need to build a new array with those elements removed, or similar)\n\n Then, then:\n\n       ans( win_idx ) = 0 \n\n      insert win_idx into the elements array in the sorted position.\n\nThus, the tasks are:\n\n- maintaining elements in order.\n\n To remove a multiple elements between indices start and end (which may be contiguous or with other elements not part of the removal), requires the code to create a new array by copying elements except those in the desired range (start to end?)\n\nWait, since elements are stored in a sorted array, the elements between start and end are contiguous. \n\nE.g., elements are sorted and the elements to remove are from start_pos to end_pos in the array. So all elements in this range are to be removed.\n\nTherefore, removing those elements is simply making a new array that excludes those indices. \n\nThus:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n  the elements array is stored as an integer array of current_elements_count.\n\n Let's denote original array size as current_count.\n\nThe start and end indices in the elements array are start_pos and end_pos.\n\nThe size of the range is delta = (end_pos - start_pos +1).\n\nThe new array will be:\n\nelements_old(1:start_pos-1) // elements_old(end_pos+1:current_count)\n\nThen, we need to create a new array:\n\nelements = elements_old[1:start_pos-1] + elements_old[end_pos+1:current_count]\n\ncurrent_count is set to current_count - delta.\n\nThus, this step involves copying the arrays except the slice to remove.\n\nTo do this in code, we can create temporary arrays.\n\nBut for elements array, this is manageable, even in Fortran (assume that the elements are stored in elements(1:current_count) )\n\nThus:\n\nnew_count = current_count - (end_pos - start_pos + 1)\n\ntemp_save = elements(1:start_pos-1) // elements(end_pos+1:current_count)\n\nelements = temp_save\n\nThen current_count = new_count\n\nBut in Fortran, array concatenation may need to be done element-wise.\n\nPerhaps better to:\n\nelements(1:start_pos-1)\n\nthen \n\nelements(end_pos+1:current_count) \u2192 but when combined:\n\nThe new array:\n\nelements is now of length: (start_pos -1) + (current_count - (end_pos))\n\n\u2192 which is current_count - (end_pos - start_pos +1) \u2192 correct.\n\nBut to make this done in code, perhaps:\n\nstart_idx = 1\n\nend_idx = 0\n\nthen:\n\n! copy the first part:\n\nfor i = 1 to start_pos-1:\n\n   new_elements( i ) = elements( i )\n\nend_idx = start_pos-1\n\nThen copy the second part from end_pos+1:\n\nfrom elements(end_pos+1) to elements(current_count)\n\nthen for each i from end_pos+1 to current_count:\n\n   new_elements(end_idx +1) = elements(i )\n\n   end_idx +=1\n\nThus, the new_elements array has length: (start_pos-1) + (current_count - end_pos )\n\nthen current_count = end_idx.\n\nThus in code steps.\n\nBut this is quite involved. \n\nThis requires a good understanding of Fortran's array handling. \n\nAssuming elements is an allocatable array:\n\nelements: integer, Allocatable(:)\n\nMoreover, each time we remove the block, we create a new array.\n\nThis may be memory intensive for large n, but let's proceed under the assumption that the problem's constraints are not too large.\n\nOnce those elements are removed:\n\nThen:\n\n ans( win_idx ) =0 \u2192 this sets its answer value.\n\nThen, we need to add win_idx back to the elements array in the correct position to keep the array sorted.\n\nTo add it:\n\nWe use the binary search.\n\nposition = find where to insert it.\n\n   which is the first index > win_idx in the elements array.\n\nThus insert it before that position.\n\nLet me think:\n\nbinary search for the insertion point:\n\n   find first element in elements > win_idx.\n\n   the index of that element is the insertion point.\n\nThus, the elements array is:\n\nnew_elements = elements(1: insertion_pos -1) // [win_idx] // elements(insertion_pos: previous_current_count)\n\nnew_count = previous_current_count +1\n\nThus, again, this can be done with an array reallocation.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran code steps:\n\nFirst, the code structure:\n\nWe'll have the elements array as dynamic, and current_count tracks its length.\n\nThe answer array can be a standard array of size n.\n\nFirst:\n\nRead n.\n\nallocate answer(n) \u2192 assuming n is known first.\n\nread q the number of queries.\n\n initialize:\n\n   allocate elements(0:n-1) \u2192 no, since in fortran arrays are 1-based. Or:\n\nWait the indices are 0-based. But in elements array, stored as integers 0,1,..n-1.\n\n So elements array in fortran will be elements(1:n), initialized as elements(i)=i-1 \u2192 for 1 to n indices. \n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nelements is an array of size current_count, initially n.\n\n   elements(1 to n) \u2192 elements(1) is 0, elements(2) is 1, down to elements(n) = n-1\n\n  current_count = n\n\n  integer, allocatable :: elements(:)\n\n  answer is also an array of integers of size n.\n\nThen loop for q queries:\n\nRead l, r, win_val.\n\nConvert l to 0-based: L = l -1 (Perhaps the user's inputs are l and r as 1-based in the problem.)\n\nWait: First, reading input numbers in Fortran:\n\nWe need to read them using a Fast Reader-like, but here in Fortran using read-unit.\n\nWait, the user inputs can be read with read(*,*) but splitting them. For multiple queries, the input may have each query's elements on separate lines, or all together. \n\nAssuming input is such that each query is three integers. So for a total of q queries, the input will have lines after the first two numbers (n and q) each line is three integers, l, r, win.\n\nIn Fortran, the simplest is to read all at once or sequentially:\n\nBut, the code:\n\ninteger n, q, l, r, win_val\n\nread *, n, q\n\nallocate( elements( n ) ) \u2192 start with n elements.\n\nelements(1:n) = [ (i-1, i=1, n) ] \u2192 So elements(i) = i-1. But this can be written in Fortran via a loop.\n\n Then current_count = n\n\nallocate(answer(0 : n-1)) \u2192 but fortran arrays start from 1 by default. \n\nWait perhaps better to shift all indices to fortran-based (starting from 1) with an offset:\n\nAlternative: Let the elements in the array be 1-based indices (since fortran arrays are easier there). The elements are stored as 1-based? No, but maybe keep 0-based data in the array. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nanswer is an array of size n (Fortran indices 1 to n), but the actual index 0 corresponds to answer(1).\n\nThis may complicate. \n\nPerhaps to minimize confusion, in code:\n\nanswer(0:n-1) will be fortan array from 1 to n, shifted by 1.\n\nWait, this is going to be a bit of a mess. Alternatively, use fortran's 1-based array storage, and have indexes shifted.\n\n So :\n\n in fortran:\n\nelements array will represent indices from 0 to n-1, stored as integers in elements(1) to elements(n), with elements(1) =0, etc.\n\nSame with the answer array:\n\nanswer(1) = java's answer[0], etc.\n\n Thus:\n\n read( *, *) l \u2192 then L = l -1 (converted to 0-based)\n\n Read *, r \u2192 R = r-1\n\n read *, win_val \u2192 win_idx = win_val -1 (so for example, if input is 3 then win_idx is 2).\n\n Thus, all values are 0-based.\n\nSouth for the code:\n\nThe steps:\n\nFor Query processing:\n\nl = read from stdin (original is 1-based for problem's input)\n\nCalculate L = l-1 \u2192 0-based.\n\nSimilarly R = read( and subtract 1.\n\n win_val = third input integer \u2192 win_idx is win_val -1 (0-based index).\n\n Now:\n\nfind the starting position in elements array (from 1 to current_count).\n\nWe need to perform a search for the first element in elements (which is sorted) that is >= L.\n\nImplement the binary search:\n\n   low =1\n\n   high= current_count \n\n   start_pos =0\n\n   do while (low <= high):\n\n      mid = (low + high)/2\n\n      if (elements(mid) >= L ) then \n\n          start_pos = mid\n\n          high = mid-1 \n\n      else \n\n          low = mid +1 \n\n   if start_pos == 0:\n\n      the element is not found \u2192 so no elements to process, then skip to adding back the win_idx.\n\n   else \n\n      but we need to make sure that elements(start_pos) is the first element >= L.\n\n      So after the loop, check whether it is indeed the first:\n\nWait perhaps the binary search could proceed as follows (the code for finding first occurrence >= L):\n\nAfter loop:\n\nif low > high:\n\n   start_pos = low ?\n\nWait I need a better binary search for the first position.\n\nAlternative approach for searching for the first element >= L:\n\n function find_first_ge( L )\n\ninteger(8) :: low, high, mid, res\n\nlow =1\n\nhigh= current_count \n\nres= -1 ! not found.\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low+high)/2\n\n    if elements(mid) >= L :\n\n        res = mid \n\n        high = mid-1 ! look for earlier occurrences.\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid+1\n\nend do \n\nif res ==-1 \u2192 not found \u2192 nothing.\n\nElse:\n\n the first position is res is the first element >= L?\n\n Not exactly. Wait no. For example, the element at mid could be the first occurrence.\n\n Wait, the way this loop:\n\n While low <= high:\n\n we pick mid.\n\n case1:\n\n elements(mid)>= L \u2192 then potential candidate. Check earlier positions.\n\n So set res= mid \u2192 but see if there is an earlier.\n\n set high = mid-1.\n\n case0:\n\n else, set low = mid +1.\n\n So finally, if res is set, then the first occurrence \u2265 is the maximum of all such candidates where the loop terminates with res being the highest candidate.\n\nWait, thus the first element \u2265 L would be at position res?\n\n No, it could be that there are elements before res with value \u2265 L but since res is updated.\n\nFor example, if Array is [2,3,4,5].\n\nSearching for L=3 \u2192 desired first element is position2 (element 3). \n\nThe loop would first check mid =2 at first 1-4 \u2192 mid=2.5 rounded to 2.\n\n elements(2) is 3 \u2192 >=L \u2192 set res=2 \u2192 set high to mid-1 =1.\n\n Now low 1, high1 \u2192 mid=1:\n\n elements(1) = 2 < L (3):\n\n set low to 2 \u2192 loop terminates.\n\n Res is 2 \u2192 which is correct.\n\n another example, position overcounts?\n\nAnother example: \n\narray [1,2,3,5]\n\nQuery L=4.\n\nfind first element >=4. The element is 5 at position4.\n\n initial low=1, high=4.\n\n mid 2: elements(2) is 2 <4 \u2192 low becomes3.\n\n mid is (3+4)/2 \u2192 3.5 \u21923? \n\nelements(3)=3 <4 \u2192 low to 4.\n\n at iteration with low=4, high=4 \u2192 mid=4 \u2192 element is 5 \u22654 \u2192 res=4 \u2192 high=3 \u2192 loop ends.\n\n \u2192 res is4 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus the function find_first_ge returns the smallest index where the first element >= L. Or the position of the wanted element.\n\n Wait no:\n\nWait example where there are multiple elements >= L, then res is the first occurrence.\n\nYes, the algorithm returns the first occurrence's earliest position.\n\nThus, the first occurrence (leftmost) where elements \u2265 L is found as res.\n\nIf we set start_pos = res.\n\nNow, must also check that this element's value is <= R. \n\nElse, there's nothing to process.\n\nElse:\n\nThen, find the last element <= R.\n\nThis is done similarly with another binary search.\n\nWe search for the last element <= R.\n\nThe algorithm for finding the last element:\n\nfunction find_last_le( R )\n\ninteger low, high , mid, res\n\n low =1 \n\n high = current_count\n\nres = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low +high ) /2 \n\n   if elements(mid) <= R \u2192 this is a valid candidate, so we can have better (farther) position \u2192 move to right.\n\n   \u2192 set res = mid \n\n   low = mid +1\n\n else:\n\n     high= mid -1\n\n Thus, when loop ends, res is the largest position where elements are <= R.\n\nThus, after this:\n\nif (start_pos <= res), then process from start_pos to res.\n\nThus, the range is possible.\n\nelse \u2192 no elements.\n\nNow:\n\ncollect the current elements from the start_pos to end_pos (res). all the elements between those indices in elements array are to be processed.\n\nThey need to be removed, and their answer set to win_val.\n\nFirst, the answer updating:\n\nDO i = start_pos , res \n\n   ans = elements(i)\n\n   answer(ans+1) = win_val \u2192 wait no, the answer array in Fortran is 1-based for the 0-based indices. If stored as:\n\nanswer(0..n-1) \u2192 shall be stored in fortran as array(1:n), with elements 1 to n \u2192 each element in answer array corresponds to 0-based index.\n\nWait wait.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIn Java, the answer is an array of size n. The code:\n\nanswer[curr] = win_val (the 3rd input).\n\ncurr is a 0-based index (0 to n-1).\n\nIn Fortran's code, I should have a one-based array where answer(1) is the first index, thus answer( i ) holds the 0-based value.\n\nWait better:\n\nLet:\n\nanswer(0:n-1) \u2192 but in fortran, perhaps I can use a 1-based array of size n where answer(1) is the answer for java's index 0, etc.\n\nThus:\n\nj_index = 0 \u2192 fortran answer(1) = 5.\n\nj_index =4 \u2192 fortran answer(5).\n\nThus in code:\n\nfor each element in the range (start_pos to res), the value is elements(i) \u2192 0-based.\n\nThus answer( elements(i) +1 ) will be the correct array entry.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nCreate an array in fortran of n elements, with indices 1 to n. Thus:\n\nanswer(1) \u2192 corresponds to 0.\n\n    answer elements(0) is answer(1) in fortran.\n\nThus the elements(I) (0-based) must be used as answer( elements(I) + 1 ), if the array is 1-based.\n\nThus, code:\n\ndo i = start_pos, res \n\n   idx = elements(i)\n\n   answer( idx + 1 ) = win_val \n\nenddo \n\nThen, we need to remove these elements from the elements array.\n\nAs outlined earlier, re allocating the elements array minus the range start_pos to res.\n\nOnce done, then we must:\n\nSet answer(win_idx +1 ) \u2192 0, since win_idx is 0-based:\n\nThus:\n\nanswer( win_idx +1 ) = 0\n\nThen, need to add the win_idx back into the elements array in the correct position.\n\nTo add the element win_idx to the elements array:\n\n   first find its insertion point \u2192 the first elements(j) > win_idx. \n\n the new elements array's insertion point is between pos -1 and pos.\n\nSo:\n\n   start inserting at pos, so the new elements are inserted after pos-1's elements.\n\nTo find pos, use another binary search.\n\nfunction find_insert_pos( value ) \n\ninteger :: value, low, high, mid, pos\n\n low =1 \n\n high = current_count \n\n pos = current_count+1 \n\n do while ( low <= high )\n\n    mid = (low+high)/2 \n\n    if elements(mid) gt value \u2192 \n\n         pos = mid \n\n         high = mid-1 \n\n     else \n\n          low = mid +1\n\n end do \n\n Thus, pos is the first element > value.\n\nTherefore, the new element is inserted at position pos. \n\nThus, inserting the new element at index pos requires:\n\nelements array grows in length by 1.\n\nThe insertion is done by:\n\nnew_elements = elements(1: pos-1) // value // elements(pos: old_length) \n\nThus, this again requires copying the arrays.\n\nSo, after the deletion step, elements has current_count minus (res - start_pos +1). After that:\n\n   current_count = dc & \u2192 the new count.\n\nThen inserting the new element:\n\n current_count +=1 \n\n Then, the new array is constructed, which is elements(1:pos-1) // [win_idx] // elements(pos: current_count -1)\n\n Thus, this requires:\n\n Allocating a new array.\n\nPerhaps using the following steps:\n\nnew_current_count = current_count \n\nnew_elements = allocate( new_current_count )\n\n\u2192 not exact in code, but:\n\ntemp_length = current_count \n\nallocate( new_elements( temp_length +1 ) )\n\n do i=1, pos-1:\n\n    new_elements(i) = elements(i)\n\n new_elements(pos) = win_idx \n\n do i=pos, temp_length \n\n    new_elements(i+1) = elements(i)\n\n end do \n\n \u2192 total length new_current_count temp_length +1.\n\nThus, element array now holds this new array.\n\nelements \u2192 becomes new_elements, and current_count = temp_length +1 \u2192 which is previous_count +1 (since after previous steps, current_count was temp_length).\n\nThus, in code.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nThe code structure in Fortran:\n\n    program problem356A \n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: n, q, l_input, r_input, win_val, win_idx \n\n    integer, allocatable :: elements(:) \n\n    integer, allocatable :: answer(:)\n\n    integer :: current_count, i \n\n    ! read n and q \n\n    read*, n, q \n\n    allocate( elements(n) ) \n\n    elements = [(i-1, i=1,n) ] \n\n    current_count = n \n\n    allocate( answer(0:n-1) )  ! using 0-based array here (Fortran starts at 1, but stored 0-based.

So the answer array should be 0-based in Fortran:\n\n    allocate( answer(0: n-1) ) \n\nThus:\n\nanswer( elements(j) ) = win_val \n\n then, after processing, set \n\n answer(win_idx) =0 \n\n So that's better.\n\n Thus correction:\n\n    answer( tmp_idx ) = win_val \n\n then, after removing the elements, \n\n answer(win_idx ) =0 \n\n Then add win_idx back.\n\n The loop for updating the answer is:\n\n do j=start_pos to end_pos \n\n   tmp = elements(j) \n\n   answer(tmp) = win_val \n\n end do \n\nThus:\n\nNow back.\n\n So after the loop, the elements must be removed.\n\n To remove the elements from the elements array:\n\n   the indices from start_pos to end_pos are to be removed.\n\n   Thus the new elements array is the elements array excluding those indices.\n\n   So they need to be copied into a new array.\n\n   The new count is current_count - (end_pos - start_pos +1 )\n\n Thus:\n\n integer, allocatable :: temp_elements(:) \n\n integer :: new_count = current_count - (end_pos - start_pos +1 )\n\n allocate ( temp_elements( new_count ) )\n\n integer :: temp_index =0 \n\n do jj =1, start_pos -1 ! first part \n\n    temp_index = temp_index +1 \n\n    temp_elements(temp_index) = elements(jj)\n\n end do \n\n do jj = end_pos +1, current_count ! second part \n\n    temp_index = temp_index +1 \n\n    temp_elements(temp_index) = elements(jj)\n\n end do \n\n deallocate( elements )\n\n elements => temp_elements \n\n current_count = new_count \n\nAfter that, we can proceed to set the win_idx's answer and add it back.\n\n So:\n\n ! now set answer(win_idx) to 0 \n\n answer(win_idx) =0 \n\n ! Now insert win_idx into elements \n\n integer pos \n\n call find_insert_pos(elements, current_count, win_idx, pos )\n\n ! new_elements array size is current_count +1 \n\n integer, allocatable:: new_elements(:) \n\n allocate(new_elements( current_count +1 ) \n\n do jj =1, pos-1 \n\n    new_elements(jj) = elements(jj) \n\n new_elements(pos) = win_idx \n\n do jj=pos, current_count \n\n    new_elements(jj+1) = elements(jj) \n\n end do \n\n deallocate( elements )\n\n elements => new_elements \n\n current_count = current_count +1 \n\n    end if \n\n    end if \n\n   end do \n\n end do \n\nWait that's a rough draft. There are many conditions to handle:\n\n- The function find_first_ge and find_last_le and find_insert_pos must be functions or routines.\n\nThis is getting quite involved, but possible.\n\nAnother challenge is the functions for finding the positions. \n\nImplementing these functions requires writing them as part of the code.\n\nFor ex:\n\nFunction find_first_ge (elements, current_count, L) \u2192 this will return the starting_pos as explained.\n\nThis can be a function inside the program.\n\nThe Fortran code would have all the functions.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran 90+, functions can be included within the main code.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nInside the program's scope:\n\n! Find the first element >= L \n\ninteger function find_first_ge( current_count, ele_array, target )\n\n  integer, intent(in) :: current_count \n\n  integer, intent(in) :: ele_array( current_count )\n\n  integer, intent(in) :: target \n\n  integer :: low, high, mid \n\n  find_first_ge = -1 \n\n  low =1 \n\n  hight = current_count \n\n  do while ( low <= high ) \n\n    mid = (low + high)/2 \n\n    if (ele_array(mid) >= target) then \n\n      find_first_ge = mid \n\n      high = mid -1 \n\n    else \n\n      low = mid +1 \n\n    end if \n\n  end do \n\nEnd function find_first_ge \n\n Wait no. The return value here is whether the function has been set correctly. Wait let me correct:\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nWe set find_first_ge = mid whenever the condition is hit. When the loop ends:\n\nif no element found (initial remains -1?), then returns -1 (no found).\n\nElse returns the original value.\n\nWait the loop continues until low>high.\n\n The final value is the first occurrence's earliest position.\n\n But the code may have:\n\n initially set to -1 \n\n so the only time it changes to a valid position.\n\n Thus, this function returns the first occurrence index or -1.\n\nSimilarly for find_last_le.\n\nThis part is getting quite involved. \n\nIn summary, the Fortran code will involve:\n\n\u00b7 maintaining a sorted array of available indices (elements array).\n\n\u00b7 For each query, search for the first eligible index and the last eligible index in the elements array within the required range.\n\n\u00b7 Remove those indices by creating a new array.\n\n\u00b7 Update the answer array for those indices.\n\n\u00b7 Add win's index back into elements (south maintaining the sort)\n\nThis requires writing a series of loops and array management.\n\nFinally, after processing all queries, output the answer array into the string.\n\nThe final part: printing the answer array:\n\n! print the result \n\ndo i=0, n-1 \n\n   write(*, \"(I0)\", advance='no') answer(i) \n\nend do \n\nwrite(*,*) '' \n\nThus, printing without spaces.\n\nNow, compiling all this into Fortran code.\n\n \n\nA possible Fortran code would look something like this:\n\nFortran:\n\nThe code will have to handle all the array operations, including the sorting-related functions.\n\nHere's an attempt (error prone, but capturing the logic):\n\n```fortran\nprogram code_356A\n    implicit none\n    \n    integer :: n, q, l_input, r_input, win_val, win_idx\n    integer, allocatable :: elements(:), answer(:)\n    integer :: current_count, i\n    integer :: L, R, start_pos, end_pos, new_count\n    logical :: found\n\n    !

Let's think:\n\nThe insertion_pos is the first element > win_idx \u2192 thus place win_idx before that position.\n\nThe current_count is the current array size before adding.\n\nThus, when you want to add the element:\n\nnew elements must have size current_count+1.\n\nThe insertion is done by shifting elements from position 'insert_pos' to end by one, and placing win_idx at position 'insert_pos'.\n\nThus, the code for inserting could be:\n\ntemporary array allocation may be better.\n\nAnother approach for insertion:\n\nAllocate a temporary array.\n\n allocate(temp_ins( current_count +1 )) \n\n temp_ins(1:insert_pos-1) = elements(1:insert_pos-1) \n\n temp_ins(insert_pos) = win_idx \n\n temp_ins(insert_pos+1: current_count+1) = elements(insert_pos:current_count) \n\n deallocate(elements) \n\n elements = temp_ins \n\n current_count = current_count+1 \n\nThus, the code for insertion can replace the line:\n\n! after answer(win_idx)=0\n\ninteger :: insert_pos = find_insert_pos(elements, current_count, win_idx)\n\ninteger :: new_size = current_count +1 \n\n allocate(temp_ins(new_size) )\n\n temp_ins(1:insert_pos-1) = elements(1:insert_pos-1)\n\n temp_ins(insert_pos) = win_idx \n\n temp_ins(insert_pos+1: new_size) = elements(insert_pos: current_count )\n\n deallocate(elements)\n\n elements => temp_ins \n\n current_count = new_size \n\nThis is better because it avoids the loop for shifting.\n\nTherefore, in the main code, after setting answer(win_idx) =0, we compute the insert_pos, then do the allocation and array set.\n\nThus, those steps would be more correct.\n\nThis approach avoids loops and might be easier in Fortran.\n\nUpdating the code's insertion part accordingly:\n\nThere are many probable errors in the code due to Fortran's strict array handling, but the above represents the core of what is needed.\n\nGiven the complexity, I believe this would be the translated code in Fortran."
