So the total n + z will be the next multiple of k after n (since n was already incremented). So in Fortran it's straightforward. Now, writing in Fortran syntax:\n\nProgram codeforces_678_A\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  integer :: n, k, z\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  n = n + 1\n  z = 0\n  if (mod(n, k) /= 0) then\n     z = k - mod(n, k)\n  end if\n  write(*,*) n + z\nEnd program codeforces_678_A\n\nWait, that's the structure. Let me check. Wait the mod function in Fortran: mod(n, k) gives the remainder. So if n is 7 and k is 3, mod(7,3)=1, so 3-1=2, so adding 2 to 7 gives 9 which is divisible by 3. Correct. Yes, that seems right. So this code should do the same as the Java code. Testing possible edge cases.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the Java code starts by importing Scanner. In Fortran, we don't need imports like that. Input/output is handled with read and write statements.\n\nThe main method in Java is public static void main, which in Fortran translates to a program block, maybe named the same or similar. So I'll start with program codeforces_678_A followed by end program.\n\nNext, variables. The Java code declares n, k, z as integers. In Fortran, variables need to be declared with IMPLICIT NONE, so I'll set that in a block. Variables n, k, z will be integers.\n\nThe code reads two integers from input. In Java, they use Scanner's nextInt. In Fortran, we can read from * using read(*,*) n, k. \n\nThen there's n++ which increments n by 1. In Fortran, that would be n = n + 1.\n\nThe next part is checking if n mod k is not zero. If so, z is set to k minus the remainder. So, in Fortran, modulo can be done with mod function. So the condition is if (mod(n, k) /= 0) then z = k - mod(n,k).\n\nFinally, print n + z. In Fortran, that's write(*,*) n + z.\n\nWait, need to make sure the order is correct. Let me step through the code again.\n\nOriginal Java steps: Read n and k, increment n, compute z as the difference to reach the next multiple of k, then print n + z.\n\nWait, the Java code's output is (n + z), but let me see. Suppose n is 5, k is 3. Then after n increments to 6, mod(6,3) is 0, so z is 0. So output is 6 +0 =6. But that's exactly the next multiple. Hmm, perhaps the logic is to calculate the minimal number to add so that (n + z) is divisible by k?\n\nWait, the code in Java: After n is increased by 1, then the code calculates z as the needed added to n to reach the next multiple of k. So the total n + z will be the next multiple of k after n (since n was already incremented). So in Fortran it's straightforward.\n\nNow, writing in Fortran syntax:\n\nProgram codeforces_678_A\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  integer :: n, k, z\n  read(*,*) n, k\n  n = n + 1\n  z = 0\n  if (mod(n, k) /= 0) then\n     z = k - mod(n, k)\n  end if\n  write(*,*) n + z\nEnd program codeforces_678_A\n\nWait, that's the structure. Let me check.\n\nWait the mod function in Fortran: mod(n, k) gives the remainder. So if n is 7 and k is 3, mod(7,3)=1, so 3-1=2, so adding 2 to 7 gives 9 which is divisible by 3. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So this code should do the same as the Java code.\n\nTesting possible edge cases. For example, when n is already a multiple of k before increment? Let's say n was 5, k=5. Then n becomes 6. mod(6,5) is 1, so z would be 4. Then total is 10? Wait, no. Wait, wait n was originally 5. So after n++, becomes 6. So 6 mod 5 is 1. So z is 4. Then total 6+4=10? That's actually the next multiple. But maybe the original code had a different intention. Wait, perhaps the original Java problem was to find the minimal z such that (original n +1 + z) is divisible by k? So maybe the problem expects to compute the next multiple after the incremented n.\n\nWait the code is correct as per the translation, so the Fortran code should mirror that exactly.\n\nTherefore the translation should be correct as I outlined above."
