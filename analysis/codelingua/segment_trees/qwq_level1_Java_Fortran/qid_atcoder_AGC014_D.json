Now compute list_start and list_end.\n\n    allocate(list_start(0:n-1), list_end(0:n-1))\n\n    integer :: sum_adj \n\n    sum_adj =0 \n\n    do v =0, n-1 \n\n        list_start(v) = sum_adj +1 \n\n        sum_adj = sum_adj + count_deg(v) \n\n        list_end(v) = list_start(v) + count_deg(v) -1 \n\n    end do \n\nThat should work.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the Java code into Fortran. Let me start by looking at what the code does. The Java code is solving a problem related to a tree structure, computing some maximum matching, and then determining based on the result whether \"First\" or \"Second\" should be printed. \n\nFirst, I'll go through the Java code step by step.\n\nThe main class has a static array of ArrayLists called g, which represents the graph. The maxMatching function is a recursive function that traverses the tree starting from a node v with parent p. The function computes some value and returns it. The key part there is the calculation with a (accumulated even edges?), o (remainders?), and then returning a formula.\n\nThe main method reads N, creates an adjacency list for the tree, parses the edges, calls maxMatching starting at node 0 (assuming root?), divides the result by 2 to get m. Then, it checks if 2*m equals N, outputting Second if yes, First otherwise.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's note the steps involved:\n\n1. Representing the graph. Since Java uses ArrayLists, which are dynamic, in Fortran, since arrays are fixed size, maybe using linked lists or arrays with a fixed maximum size. But Fortran doesn't support dynamic structures easily. Alternatively, since N can be up to say 1e5 (assuming problem constraints - though the problem isn't specified, but I'll proceed as the code given). Wait, original problem's constraints aren't here, but in code everything seems to be handled even for large N. Hmm, in Fortran, for adjacent lists, we can use a list where each node's edges are stored as a list of pointers. Wait Fortran 90/2003 allows array of linked lists, but using allocatable arrays might be better. Alternatively, using a static array with a maximum size? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent the adjacency list as a 2D array, but with varying length per list. Since in Fortran, an array of the specified size would be needed beforehand. Since Java uses ArrayLists for each node, in Fortran, perhaps we can use an adjacency list stored as a list with a fixed capacity for each node, but that requires determining the maximum required size. Alternatively, using linked lists might be difficult. Maybe the best way here is to represent the adjacency list with a structure that uses vectors, perhaps using a dynamic list. Since this is a competition-style problem, the coding might need to be adjusted to use arrays properly.\n\nAlternatively, create an array where for each node, the edges are stored in a list, and since each tree edge is represented twice (since it's undirected), but in Fortran, perhaps an array of arrays. Because in Java, each node's adjacency list is an ArrayList. Let me think: for maximum N nodes, say up to like 1e5 or something. Wait, but the given code's N is read from input, so we can perhaps not know it in advance. So, any dynamic allocation would be needed. In Fortran 90/2003, using allocatable arrays is possible. So let's see.\n\nFirst, the graph. The Java code declares an array of ArrayLists: static ArrayList<Integer>[] g;. So for each node v, the g[v] contains the list of its neighbors. In Fortran, since Fortran is 1-based or 0-based, but programs often use 1-based, but in this code (Java uses 0-based as seen in a= sc.nextInt-1), perhaps in Fortran it's better to use 0-based array indices too, but Fortran is 1-based by default, so might need to adjust. Alternatively, adjust the code to use 1-based.\n\nWait, let me check: in Java the code reads a and b, subtracts 1 (so nodes numbered 0-based). So in Fortran, we need to decide whether nodes are 0-based or 1-based. Probably easier to treat them as 0-based here, even with FORTRAN's 1-based, but that might require some offset management. Maybe using 1-based for arrays and adding 1 when storing.\n\nAlternatively, let's see.\n\nStep by step translation plan:\n\n1. Translation of the graph structure. Since in Java, the g is an array of ArrayLists. In Fortran, this can be a list of linked lists stored as linked list nodes, but perhaps more simply, using an adjacency list stored as an array of dynamic lists via pointers. Alternatively, since in each node's adjacency list is just a list of integers (indices), and the list size can be dynamically known.\n\nBut with modern Fortran (since 90/95), we can have an array of linked list nodes using pointers, but that might be more involved. Alternatively, the method for adjacency lists is to have a 1D array for storing edges, and then an array for head pointers for each node, and another array for the next indices. That's perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, using dynamic arrays with a helper function. The standard way might be to use a list stored as a vector for each node. But since Fortran doesn't have built-in dynamic arrays for each node, the easier way might be to precompute how many nodes there are, then have a max array. But for the problem, it's a tree, so each node v has (n-1) edges total, but each vertex has degree of up to say max_degree, but the average is small.\n\nAlternatively, the code can read all edges first, and for each node store the adjacency. Therefore:\n\nIn Java, first, the code initializes g as an array of ArrayLists. Then, for each edge, adds entries to both a's and b's lists.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps first read all edges, store in an array, and then build adjacency lists. Alternatively, dynamically build the adjacency lists as each edge comes in.\n\nBut I think the better approach here is to have an adjacency list stored as an array of arrays, but require knowing the maximum size. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, for each edge between a and b, adding to both lists. So in Fortran, for each node, we can preallocate a large enough array for adjacency lists, but perhaps the problem constraints allow this. Though without knowing the problem's constraints, but let's see the Java code.\n\nAssuming N is up to say 1e5, that's a million nodes? No, wait N-1 edges for a tree. So maximum N would be maybe up to 1e5, then the adjacency list per node on average would be 2. But for nodes that have higher degrees, like if a tree, the maximum degree can be up to N-1 (like a star shape). So for a star, the root node has N-1 edges. So, in Fortran, using a 2D array with N entries of size say 1e5+2 would work but uses a lot of memory, but perhaps acceptable. Alternatively, use linked lists. Let's consider F90's approach.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic array approach for each adjacency list. Since Fortran can't have an array of pointers easily, perhaps we can make a list for each node by having a start array and an edges array. Let me try:\n\nLet\u2019s structure it in a way that all edges are stored in a 1D array of type node of edges. For each node, we can have a pointer to the list of nodes. Using a linked list system. Let\u2019s see:\n\nFirst, we need to have an adjacency list for each node. Let\u2019s define an array for next pointers and the node pointers.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method:\n\n- Reserve a list of edges as integers (or two arrays: to store the node and the next in list)\nBut that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's preallocate an array of pointers (indices) for the edges in each node, using a linked list structure. Since we don't know the size upfront, this might require a fixed size. Alternatively, since the total number of edges is N-1 (since a tree is given), we can handle this via a dual array.\n\nAn alternative approach for adjacency lists In Fortran:\n\nFirst, read all edges, then build adjacency lists as an array of linked lists.\n\nThe steps could be:\n\n- Read N and the edges.\n\n- For each node v from 0 to N-1, store a linked list of edges. But for Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, instead of dynamic, we can set a maximum possible degree (like say N is up to 1e5, but the degree per node can't exceed N-1). Therefore, it might need a very large array, but perhaps a better approach is to represent each adjacency list as a dynamic array. Since Fortran allows allocatable arrays:\n\nOption one:\n\n- For each node v, have an array (say list(v)) of integers. Each time you add a node w, store in list(v). The array can be dynamically lengthed via allocatable arrays. Since we can process edges as they come in, adding to the arrays:\n\nIn code:\n\nInitialize for all nodes lists to be empty. Then, for each edge a b, add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nIn Fortran, even with allocatable arrays, since each list must be extended on demand, it's a bit tedious. But maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method:\n\nWe can first read all edges (N-1 edges), and collect each node's edges.\n\nSo steps in Fortran code:\n\nRead N.\n\nRead N-1 edges:\n\nRead a and b from each of N-1 lines. Then, a is stored in 0-based or 1-based.\n\nSince in the Java code, a and b are read and then a-1 and b-1 (so 0-based).\n\nSo in Fortran, suppose we store nodes as 1-based (since default), so need to add 1 to input? Or make them 0-based by starting indices at 0.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, we can use 1-based and then adjust the input by adding 1 to the Java's logic.\n\nWait in Java code, the nodes are stored as 0-based, because the code says:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n -1; ++i) {\n\nreads a and b, and they have a-1 and b-1.\n\nHence, in FORTRAN, suppose we read a and b as 1-based, so in Fortran code, we can read a as input value (say from 1 to N), then subtract 1 to use 0-based (since if Fortran arrays are 1-based, maybe better to use 1-based, but 0-based can also be forced via using array(0:...) declarations).\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nMake the nodes 0-based in Fortran. Therefore, in code:\n\nDIMENSION n\n\nRead n, then dimension the graph as nodes(0: n-1). Wait, but arrays are declared with sizes known at compile time? In Fortran, you can use allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the steps in code:\n\nFirst, it's easier to have n as a variable, so when moving to Fortran, we'll have to have variables initialized via dynamic memory, etc.\n\nNow, the code's main steps:\n\n- Read N.\n\n- Read N-1 edges, each one becoming an edge between a and b.\n\nWait the original Java code's a and b are input nodes, converted to zero-based via subtracting 1. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the same steps can be done by reading a and b, adjusting to 0-based by subtracting 1, but in array dimensions, if arrays are 0-based, then it's okay. Fortran can have arrays from 0 to n-1 by declaring arrays like node_list(0:n_nodes-1).\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nWe must first read N, then allocate the adjacency lists arrays.\n\nThe adjacency list for each node v (0-based in 0 to N-1) will need to store entries. \n\nTo handle this, perhaps first for each edge, we can build two-way edges (since it's an undirected tree). So first idea: read all edges first, then build the adjacency lists.\n\nBut in Fortran, since we don't know the size of adjacency list per node beforehand, perhaps the easiest approach is to first read all edges into an array, then compute for each node the number of edges in their adjacency lists, then allocate arrays of that length and fill them.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nSuppose N nodes, numbered 0 to N-1. The total edges are N-1, and each edge is entered twice (for symmetry).\n\nProcedure steps in code:\n\n1. Read N.\n\n2. Read N-1 edges, storing them into an array of pairs (a_pair and b_pair arrays, say of length N-1).\n\n3. For each node v in 0..N-1, count the number of edges (neighbors) by iterating over all edges.\n\n   So for each v, count_degree(v) = number of edges where a equals v or b equals v? No, only each edge has two endpoints, but each edge contributes to the count of each of the two nodes. So:\n\n   Initialize an array count(n_nodes) = 0\n\n   For each edge in edge array (say for i=1, N-1), get a = a(i), b = b(i)\n\n   count(a) = count(a)+1\n\n   count(b) = count(b)+1\n\n4. Then, allocate the adjacency list for each node. That is, for each node v, have an array of length count(v), in which the neighbors will be stored.\n\n5. Then, re-scan the edges and for each v, fill their adjacency list: for each edge (a, b), add b to a's list and a to b's list.\n\nSo this way, we can have each adjacency list exactly with the required size, and fill each entry one by one.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nLet's structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me define variables:\n\n- n: the number of nodes.\n\n- edges_num = n - 1 (since a tree)\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nAfter reading N:\n\nallocate(a_edges(edges_num)), allocate(b_edges(edges_num))\n\nThen read N-1 lines from input, storing a_edges and b_edges:\n\nRead (unit=...) the a and b:\n\n   Read *, a, b\n\n   a_edges(i) = a-1 (since in fortran read 1-based, converted to 0-based)\n\n   b_edges(i) = b-1\n\nWait if in Fortran, the input reads a and b as in java (1-based?), thus, the user inputs are like the Java code's inputs (a and b are originally from the input as 1-based, but then converted to 0-based).\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\n   For each edge in 1..edges_num:\n\n      input a and b (as in Java)\n\n      a_edges(i-1) = a-1 (assuming list starts at 0 for nodes, and stored in 0-based indices)\n\n      (Wait indices in fortran arrays start at 1 unless declared otherwise. Wait the a_edges might be declared as a_edges(edges_num), which is size N-1 (since edges_num =n-1). Let's clarify variable types.\n\nVariables:\n\nINTEGER :: n\n\nINTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: a_edges(:), b_edges(:)\n\nThen lines:\n\nread*,n\n\nallocate(a_edges(n-1))\n\nallocate(b_edges(n-1))\n\ndo i=1, n-1\n\n   read *, a, b\n\n   a_edges(i) = a -1\n\n   b_edges(i) = b -1\n\nend do\n\nSo after reading edges into a_edges and b_edges arrays (as 0-based).\n\nThen step 3, count degrees:\n\nInteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: count_deg = 0\n\ndo i=1, n-1\n\n   a = a_edges(i)\n\n   b = b_edges(i)\n\n   count_deg(a) = count_deg(a) +1\n\n   count_deg(b) = count_deg(b)+1\n\nend do\n\nThen, allocate for each node's adjacency list:\n\nallocate the adjacency lists as an array of pointers or using a 1D array? Alternatively, we can create an array of allocatable arrays.\n\nSo in Fortran, you can have an array of allocatable arrays. For example:\n\ntype list_t\n\n   integer, dimension(:), pointer :: adj_list\n\nend type \n\ntype(list_t), dimension(0:n-1) :: g\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, use an array of arrays. Not sure the best way. Alternatively, have a list of pointers. Let me think:\n\nAn alternative approach is to use a 1-dimensional array for all adjacency nodes, and have offset pointers. That is:\n\nTotal elements: sum(count_deg(0:n-1)), so sum over all counts:\n\nsum_adj_nodes = 0\n\ndo v=0, n-1\n\n   sum_adj_nodes = sum_adj_nodes + count_deg(v)\n\nend do \n\nallocate(adj_array(sum_adj_nodes))\n\nThen, also to have a pointer array for each node.\n\ndeclares adj_node_count(0:n-1) = counts\n\nBut to track the starting and ending indices of each node's adjacency list. Let me see:\n\nUse a \"start\" array.\n\nInteger (starting_indices and node lists)\n\nWe can use:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: list_start, list_end\n\nInitialize list_start(0) = 1\n\n then list_start(v) = list_start(v-1) + count_deg(v-1), but that's sequential; hmm perhaps:\n\nInitialize list_start(0) =1\n\n Then for v =0 to n-2:\n\n list_start(v+1) = list_start(v) + count_deg(v)\n\n similarly, list_end(v) = list_start(v)+count_deg(v) -1 \n\nBut this is accumulating over the counts. Then the adjacency edges can be stored in adj_array(1:sum_adj_nodes), and for each node v, the adj elements are from list_start(v) to list_end(v).\n\nThus, for each node v, the adjacencies are stored in adj_array( list_start(v): list_end(v) )\n\nThis way the adj_array is a long 1-dimensional array. The start and end pointers give the current positions.\n\nThis is a way to succinctly represent the adjacency lists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to first create a list for each node with pointers to the array segments, but the above scheme should work.\n\nAlternatively, here's the plan:\n\nFirst, we:\n\nCompute the starting indices, then accumulate:\n\nallocate(list_start(0:n-1), list_end(0:n-1))\n\nsum_adj=0\n\ndo v=0, n-1\n\n   list_start(v) = sum_adj +1\n\n   sum_adj = sum_adj + count_deg(v)\n\n   list_end(v)= list_start(v) + count_deg(v) -1 \n\nend do \n\nThen allocate adj_array(1:sum_adj)\n\nThen fill in the adj_array with the edges:\n\nWe need to again go through each edge, and for each edge's nodes, to add the corresponding nodes.\n\nWait, but how:\n\nWe need to fill the adjacency lists for each edge. \n\nWait the adjacency lists should contain all neighbors. For each edge (a, b), a has b as neighbor and b has a as a neighbor.\n\nSo, to loop over each edge and add both entries:\n\nWe can go through each edge in the a_edges and b_edges arrays.\n\nfor each edge i from 1 to edges_num:\n\n   a = a_edges(i)\n\n   b = b_edges(i)\n\n   So:\n\n   first, for node a, append b to its adj list.\n\n   second, for node b, append a to its adj list.\n\nTo do this:\n\nWe need to know where to place these in the adj array. \n\nTo do this, we need to have an array for \"current pointer\" into the adj array for each node.\n\nWait, maybe after building the start pointers, we can loop through the edges again, but also have a counter array (current index for each node) initialized to start.\n\nWait Let me see:\n\nInitialize for each node v:\n\ncurrent_pos(v) = list_start(v)\n\nThe current_pos array, of size n, initialized to list_start(v).\n\nThen loop over all edges:\n\nfor i in 1:edges_num\n\n   a_edges(i) and b_edges(i) => a and b.\n\n   first, for a: adj_array( current_pos(a) ) = b\n\n   current_pos(a) = current_pos(a) +1\n\n   second, for b: adj_array( current_pos(b) ) =a \n\n   current_pos(b) = current_pos(b)+1\n\nThis way, each edge contributes to two entries in adj array, each in the corresponding nodes' list.\n\nThus the adjacency lists get built correctly.\n\nYes, that would work. So this approach is manageable.\n\nSo here's how to do it step by step in code:\n\nAfter getting the list_start and list_end:\n\nallocate(current_pos(0:n-1))\n\ncurrent_pos = list_start ! because list_start is an array starting at index 1, but current_pos array would be 0:n-1, so:\n\ndo v=0, n-1\n\n   current_pos(v) = list_start(v)\n\nend do\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=1, n-1\n\n   a = a_edges(i)\n\n   b = b_edges(i)\n\n   ! add b to a's list\n\n   adj_array(current_pos(a)) = b\n\n   current_pos(a) = current_pos(a) +1\n\n   adj_array(current_pos(b)) = a\n\n   current_pos(b) = current_pos(b)+1\n\nend do\n\nWait but this may have an error because current_pos(a) was initialized to list_start(a). \n\nWait for the first edge of node a, the first entry is stored at current_pos(a)= list_start(a). Then after incrementing, current_pos(a) becomes list_start(a) +1. etc, but the maximum is list_start(a) + count_deg(a) -1, so the incrementing up to that number should be okay since count_deg was exactly the number of entries in a's edges. So this should work.\n\nOnce the adjacency array is filled, then for any node v, its adjacency list is adj_array( list_start(v): list_end(v) )\n\nThis way, when you need to loop through the neighbors of v, you loop through those indices.\n\nNow, onto the next function in Java: the maxMatching recursive function. \n\nThe function is static int maxMatching(int v, int p). \n\nIt's doing a recursive post-order traversal of the tree, accumulating a and o. Let's see the recursive code:\n\nJava:\n\n static int maxMatching(int v, int p) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int o = 0;\n        for (int w : g[v]) {\n            if (w == p) continue;\n            int r = maxMatching(w, v);\n            a += r / 2;\n            o += r % 2;\n        }\n        return 2 * a + Math.min(1, o) + 1;\n    }\n\n Functions returns a value for a node v, with parent p. \n\nSo for each neighbor w of v (excluding p), recurse, then handle the returned value r.\n\nAfter collecting the children's contributions, a stays as sum r//2 (integer division), o is sum r mod 2 (the remainder).\n\nThe final return is (2*a) + min(1, o) +1.\n\nThe question is, how to implement this recursion in Fortran. Fortran can do recursion, but with certain constraints, especially on stack size. Because for large N (up to say 1e5?), it might hit a stack overflow. However, given that it's a tree, and the recursion depth is the depth of the tree, which is O(N) only in worst case (a linear chain), it could be problematic. Hmm. But for the problem's test cases, maybe it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the tree has reasonable depth.\n\nHowever, this is a problem. Since the Java code uses a recursive approach here, and in Fortran, recursive functions can have stack limitations. For big N, like 1e5, this would be a stack overflow in Fortran. But perhaps the problem's constraints are small, or the solution is expected to work, so proceed with the translation.\n\nAlternatively, even if in Fortran, the code would need to handle large N, it's possible that the test inputs are small for this problem. We can proceed, but perhaps the code will have to use an iterative approach. But since the problem requires a direct transliteration, perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nNow, how to implement the maxMatching function as a recursive function in Fortran.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the parameters must all be passed by value or by reference, but variables declared inside the function can be local.\n\nRecursion is allowed, but the same as in Java.\n\nThe function's parameters are v and p (the parent node). The function returns an integer.\n\nIn the original code, the function maxMatching takes v and p, loops through all the neighbors (excluding the parent p), then computes.\n\nIn Fortran, the function can be written as an integer function, with the adj arrays and variables are in a module or in the scope where they're visible. Thus, the adjacency list needs to be accessible from within the maxMatching function. Since Fortran can have internal or external functions, but for this case, perhaps the function is placed inside the main program's scope, so it can access the adj arrays which are declared earlier.\n\nBut in Fortran, you don't have the same OOP as Java, so the graph structure will be in variables that are accessible everywhere.\n\nBut first, let me outline the Fortran code structure, and see how to structure the code.\n\nLet me think outline:\n\nProgram name (maybe just the main program?)\n\nRead N.\n\nRead edges and build adjacency list as described.\n\nCall the maxMatching function starting from node zero (0-based index?), with parent -1 (but in Fortran, nodes are 0-based, but the parent could be -1 which is invalid, but p could be a value not part of the nodes, like -1, so that the first parent is -1, and when checking w == p (which is the parent), skipping.\n\nWait in Java, p is -1 for the root (the first node). So in Code: maxMatching starts with v=0 (root) and p= -1.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the parent is an integer that's invalid for nodes (like -1), so for the root node.\n\nThus, in the function maxMatching, when w equals p (which is -1), skipped.\n\nThus, in the recursive step, each neighbor w of v (excluding p) is processed.\n\nNow, the problem comes: in Fortran, how will the function access the adjacency list.\n\nIn Fortran, functions have parameters. So to compute maxMatching(v, p), the function must have access to:\n\n- The adjacency list for each node, e.g., given v, its adjacency list can be obtained via list_start and list_end arrays and adj_array.\n\nThus, the function maxMatching must be a recursive function that has access to the adj_array, list_start, list_end, variables which are in the main program's variables, or in a module. \n\nIn Fortran, function variables need to be accessible. So either the variables are explicitly passed to the function, or it's part of the main program's variables (since the function is inside the main program). But in Fortran 77, functions are external, but in modern Fortran (with free form), you can have internal functions.\n\nAlternatively, the recursive function can be in the main program's scope so the variables are visible inside.\n\nThus, code structure:\n\nprogram name \n\nimplicit none\n\nread n \n\nprocess edges and build adj arrays.\n\nRECURSIVE FUNCTION maxMatching(v,p)\n\n   implicit none \n\n   integer, intent(in) :: v,p \n\n   temps: a, o, r, res\n\n   etc\n\nend function\n\nBut in Fortran, the recursive function must be declared with \"recursive\" outside.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\ninteger :: n, ... \n\nallocate arrays etc.\n\nrecursive function maxMatching ... \n\nend function \n\ncall max = maxMatching(0,-1)/2\n\netc.\n\nBut order is important. The function must be defined before its use.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nprogram agc_problem\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, edges_num, max_val, m \n\n    integer, allocatable :: a_edges(:), b_edges(:)\n\n    integer, allocatable :: adj_array(:), list_start(:), list_end(:), count_deg(:)\n\n    ! Define the current_pos array and other variables as needed \n\n    read *, n\n\n    edges_num = n-1\n\n    allocate(a_edges(edges_num), b_edges(edges_num))\n\n    ! read edges etc. (as above steps)\n\n    ! create adj array...\n\n    ! compute max_val: call my_maxMatching() \n\n    \n\n    contains \n\n        recursive function my_maxMatching(v, parent) result(res)\n\n            integer, intent(in) :: v, parent \n\n            integer :: res \n\n            integer :: a, o, w, i_node, r \n\n            a =0 \n\n            o=0 \n\n            do i_node = list_start(v), list_end(v)\n\n                w = adj_array(i_node)\n\n                if ( w == parent) cycle \n\n                r = my_maxMatching(w, v)\n\n                a = a + (r /2) \n\n                o = o + mod(r,2) \n\n            end do \n\n            res = 2*a + min(1, o) +1 \n\n        end function\n\nend program \n\nThis way, the function is an internal function inside the program, so can access the variables list_start, list_end, adj_array.\n\nWait, but variables like list_start are (0-based?) with v as 0..n-1?\n\nYes, the variables are declared in the program and thus accessible in the function. Since the function is internal, it can see those variables.\n\nThus, this should work. \n\nNow, the function can loop through all the neighbors except the parent.\n\nNow, in code the loop:\n\nIn Fortran, the loop over node v's neighbors would be:\n\ndo i_node = list_start(v), list_end(v)\n\n    ... \n\nThe variables in the loop:\n\nFor each i_node spanning the indices in the adjacency array from list_start(v) to list_end(v), the w is adj_array(i_node).\n\nThen check if w == parent: if yes, then skip.\n\nElse, recurse into.\n\nThe variables a and o are local variables initialized to 0.\n\nThen, res is computed as stated.\n\nBut Fortran does integer division with a_numerator / divisor, which truncates towards zero, but in the java code, r / 2 is integer division (using integer division). Fortran also does the same for integer division.\n\nThe mod function should be mod(r,2), which gives r modulo 2. The addition proceeds as in Java.\n\nOnce all children processed, the result is calculated as 2*a + min(1, o) +1.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nAfter building everything, calls my_maxMatching(0, -1). The -1 is the parent for root node. But in Fortran, when w (the adjacency entry) is -1, it is possible only if the nodes can have -1, but nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1, hence when w is the parent (which is -1 in this case), comparisons will work.\n\nThus, calling the function my_maxMatching(0, -1).\n\nThen compute m = res / 2 \n\nThen, if 2*m equals n, it's a draw, output Second, else First.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nmax_val = my_maxMatching(0, -1)\n\nm = max_val / 2 \n\nif( 2*m ==n ) then \n\n   print *, 'Second' \n\nelse \n\n   print *, 'First'\n\nend if \n\nNow, to write the code step by step.\n\nNow, also note that in Fortran, variables have to be PRE-declared.\n\nTherefore, the code would be structured as follows:\n\nprogram main \n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger :: n \n\ninteger :: edges_num \n\ninteger,allocatable :: a_edges(:),b_edges(:), count_deg(:), list_start(:), list_end(:), adj_array(:)\n\ninteger :: max_val, m \n\ninteger, allocatable :: current_pos(:)\n\nrecursive function my_maxMatching(v, parent) result(res)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: v, parent \n\n    integer::res \n\n    ! local variables \n\n    integer a, o, w, i_node, r \n\n    a =0 \n\n    o=0 \n\n    do i_node = list_start(v), list_end(v)\n\n        w = adj_array(i_node)\n\n        if( w == parent ) cycle \n\n        r = my_maxMatching(w,v)\n\n        a = a + r /2 \n\n        o = o + mod(r, 2)\n\n    end do \n\n    res = 2*a + min(1, o) +1 \n\nend function \n\n!

Let's go through in detail:\n\nIn the function my_maxMatching, note that in Fortran, the integers in 'res' should be returned as the function's result, which is done correctly here.\n\nAlso, in the loop over i_node = list_start(v) to list_end(v), even if list_start and list_end might have different values.\n\nNow, in the initial declarations, the variables like count_deg are allocated to 0:n-1. But in Fortran, when you use an array with a lower bound 0, you have to allocate it as such? \n\nYes.\n\nThe allocation for count_deg:\n\n allocate(count_deg(0:n-1)) \n\nWhich is possible in Fortran2003 with the ALLOCATE statement. By default, the first index is 1, but specifying lower and upper bounds:\n\nWhen you declare an allocatable array like count_deg(:), you can allocate it with the desired indices:\n\nallocate( count_deg(0:n-1) )\n\nwhich sets the indices from 0 to N-1.\n\nSimilarly for other arrays like list_start(0:n-1), etc.\n\nCurrent_pos is allocated the same way.\n\nThe adj_array is 1:sum_adj, but in Fortran, that's okay.\n\nWait in the loops for initializing current_pos, the indices:\n\ndo v=0 to n-1:\n\n zero-based.\n\nYes.\n\nWhen filling current_pos(v), which is set to list_start(v).\n\nBut list_start(v) is initialized to sum_adj plus which increments from zero, but the first call for v=0, the list_start would be 1.\n\nYes: \n\nInitially, sum_adj is 0. \n\nAt first iteration (v=0):\n\nlist_start(0) = 0+1 =1\n\nsum_adj becomes 0 + count_deg(0) \n\nThen list_end(0)= list_start(0) + count_deg(0)-1 \u2192 since count_deg(0) is the degree of node 0. \n\nThis seems correct.\n\nThus, the adj_array starts at 1.\n\nNow, in the loop for filling adj_array:\n\nIn each edge iteration, two entries are added (for a and b), so that each edge contributes exactly two entries.\n\nNow, testing if code logic is okay.\n\nNow, when moving through the do i=1, edges_num steps:\n\nfor each edge, do the two entries, and current_pos adjusts correctly for a and b.\n\nNow, the function returns the same value as Java's function?\n\nLet me see: the function my_maxMatching is correct?\n\nYes. \n\nIn the Java code, the function returns 2*a + min(1, o)+1\n\nin Fortran, same expression. \n\nNow, possible edge case: \n\nTake N=1. Then edges_num is 0. The root is node 0, and its adjacency list is empty. Then, the loop over neighbors would run zero times. Then a=0, o=0. \n\nThe return value is 2*0 + min(1,0) +1 \u2192 0+0+1=1?\n\nWait no:\n\n wait \n\no is 0, min(1, o) \u2192 min(1,0) is 0. \n\nSo 1+ 0 +1 \u2192 2?\n\nWait wait, code's calculation:\n\nres = 2*a + min(1,o) +1 \u2192 2*0 (a=0) + min(1, 0) (0) \u2192 plus 1 \u2192 total 1?\n\nYes.\n\nSo for a tree with one node, the returned value is 1. m =1/2 \u2192 0.5 \u2192 floored to 0.\n\ncheck if 2*0 ==1? \u2192 no \u2192 output first.\n\nWhich is correct because in the problem, probably the single node can be taken by first player.\n\nFor N=1, the answer is First?\n\nPossibly but depends on the problem's rule.\n\nBut the code's output would be First if 2*m \u2260 N.\n\nIn this case m would be 0.5 \u2192 floor division would make m 0. So 2*0=0 !=1 \u2192 First.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: N=2, edges between 0 and1.\n\nThen for the root node v=0, whose parent is -1. Then, the neighbors of 0 is 1:\n\nThe call for v=0:\n\n parent is -1, so recurse to v=1 (the only neighbor (1\u2260-1).\n\nIn maxMatching(1,0):\n\nthe node 1 has only 0 as neighbor, but parent is 0 \u2192 so no other nodes. so, a and o are 0. \n\nThen returns 1 (like N=1 case). Then, parent is 0:\n\n the r=1.\n\nThen for the node0:\n\na += 1/2 =0 (integer division, 0). o +=1 mod2 is 1.\n\nso a=0, o=1.\n\nThen the res =2*0 + min(1,1)+1 \u2192 0 +1+1 =2.\n\nThus, max_val is2 \u2192 m =1.\n\nthen 2*1=2 ==N \u2192 Second? \n\nWait for N=2 the output \"Second\"?\n\nBut in problems like this, sometimes if someone can always win, but the tree is different.\n\nWait in this example with two nodes forming an edge: suppose players take turns. To win, need to form a matching. Maximum matching of a 2-node edge is 1, so m=1. The maximum edge is 1.\n\nThe problem says that if 2*m == N, then the second player can win, else first.\n\nBecause when m is exactly N/2, then if N even, player first can't make a move?\n\nWait the condition says if 2m == N \u2192 Second wins.\n\nWait let me see.\n\nThe formula in the java code to decide: if the \"m\" ( which is maxMatching(0,-1) /2 ) is exactly N/2 \u2192 then \"Second\" else \"First\".\n\nIn the case of two nodes:\n\nThe maxMatching(0,-1) gives 2 \u2192 m=1 \u2192 2*1 equals N=2, so the output is Second.\n\nDoes that correspond to something?\n\nAssuming the problem is: two players alternately select edges such that they form a matching. The winner is the one able to make the last selection. \n\nWait \"maximum matching\" m. Wait perhaps m here is the maximum matching size. The code's approach might be that the first player can win if the total m is even vs. odd? Or perhaps the game is that the players alternate, and the one who cannot pair anymore loses.\n\nWait in the code's condition:\n\nif 2*m ==N \u2192 then \"Second\", else \"First\".\n\nWait in the case of N=2: the maximum matching is 1, so m=1. Thus 2* m=2 =N \u2192 output Second.\n\nWhich would mean that when maximum matching is exactly N/2, then the second player can win. That suggests that when the maximum is even, the second player can do so. Because for each edge pair or something...\n\nHmm. Maybe the code's logic is that if the maximum matching is even, then second can win? For N=2, m=1 gives 2, so the total number of edges is 1 (m=1). Wait no. For the two node edge, the maximum matching is 1.\n\nHmm but I'm not going into the problem's correctness. The code as given produces that result, and we're to translate it. \n\nThus, the translation should be correct.\n\nNow, code needs proper variable declarations and allocations.\n\nPotential issues in Fortran code above:\n\n1. Need to define all variables properly. For arrays, memory allocations.\n\n2. Variables inside the recursive function may not be visible unless the function is contained within the program's scope. \n\nThe CONTAINS clause is needed.\n\nWait yes. The function my_maxMatching is inside the program, so needs to be in the contains block.\n\nIn the draft code above, the function is written as part of the program, but need to have contains clause before it.\n\nThus, the code should be written:\n\nprogram main \n\n  implicit none \n\n  ... declarations of variables ... \n\ncontains \n\n recursive function ... \n\nend program\n\nWait the correct structure would need the contain for the function:\n\nThe code should be structured as:\n\nprogram agc_problem\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, edges_num, ... \n\n   ... \n\n   contains \n\n      recursive function my_maxMatching ... \n\n end program \n\nThus, the code above missed that.\n\nThus adding 'contains' before the function.\n\nThus:\n\nprogram agc_problem \n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: n, edges_num \n\n    integer, allocatable :: a_edges(:), b_edges(:) \n\n    ... \n\n    contains \n\n        recursive function my_maxMatching(v,parent) result(res)\n\n             ... \n\n        end function \n\n    ... \n\n    ! main code \n\n    read *,n \n\n    etc\n\n    ... \n\nend program \n\nNow, variable names must also match. \n\nAnother point: in the loops over a_edges.\n\nWait in code:\n\nDo i=1, edges_num \n\nRead*,a,b \u2192 but in Fortran, reading a and b as integers.\n\nThen a_edges(i) = a-1.\n\nWait but in the read statements, if the input files may have large numbers, but as per problem constraints, it is okay.\n\nNow, let me check some corner cases:\n\nSuppose N=1.\n\nedges_num is 0. The edges loop is skipped. \n\nThen, when computing count_deg, all are zero. \n\nThen list_start for v=0 is 1 (since sum_adj starts at 0), then list_start(0)=1, but count_deg(v) is zero. So list_end(0) = 1+0 -1 =0. That is, list_end is less than list_start?\n\nThus, do loop for v=0 gives list_start=1, list_end =0 \u2192 the loop in the function does i_node from 1 to 0 \u2192 which in Fortran is empty loop (loop does not execute).\n\nThus, the my_maxMatching function returns 1 in this case.\n\nAlso when building adj_array, the code for current_pos.\n\nIn this case, since edges_num is zero, the loops adding the adj entries are skipped, so adj_array would be size sum_adj=0 \u2192 but when the adj_array is allocated, sum_adj is 0 ?\n\nWait in code:\n\nsum_adj is initially 0. When building list_start and list_end for N=1 (v=0):\n\ncount_deg(0) =0 \n\nlist_start(v) =0+1 =1 \n\nsum_adj += count_deg(v) \u2192 sum_adj 0 +0 \u2192 remains 0 \n\nlist_end(0) =1+0-1=0 \n\nSo sum_adj is zero. Hence, the allocate(adj_array(1:0))? Which is allowed in Fortran as a zero-length array. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the loop for filling adj array isn't called since edges_num=0.\n\nHence, in the function, the adjacency loops won't trigger errors.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother case: N=2.\n\nedges_num is 1.\n\nRead edge between 0 and 1.\n\nThus, count_deg(0)=1, count_deg(1)=1.\n\nlist_start(0)=1; list_end(0)=1 (starts at 1, count is 1, so end 1).\n\nlist_start(1)=2 (starts at 0+0 (count_deg(0)=1: total after processing node0 was sum_adj 1 \u2192 next node1 starts at 1+1=2.\n\ncount_deg(1) is 1 \u2192 so list_end(0) is 1. list_start(1)= sum_adj (1 after node0) +1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 list_end(1)= 2+1-1= 2.\n\nThen the adj_array has size 2.\n\nFilling:\n\nFirst edge is edge between a=0 and b=1 (after a-1 and b-1).\n\nFirst edge in the do i=1 loop.\n\nProcess:\n\na=0, b=1.\n\ncurrent_pos(0) is 1:\n\nadj_array[1] =1 (b's value is 1). (adj entry for node0's first position).\n\ncurrent_pos(0) becomes 2.\n\nThen add a to b's list:\n\nb is1. current_pos(1) = list_start(1)=2.\n\n so adj_array(2) =0.\n\ncurrent_pos(1) becomes 3. \n\nNow adj_array has entries:\n\nadj_array(1)=1, adj_array(2) =0.\n\nThus for node0's adjacency list: index 1 to1 \u2192 contains 1 (node b is the neighbor). \n\nnode1's adj entries are at 2 \u2192 contains 0.\n\nThus in the function for node0's:\n\nparent is -1 \u2192 processing w =1 (since that is the only neighbor in node0's list).\n\n recurse into my_maxMatching(1,0) \n\nIn that function:\n\nfor node1, parent is 0. its adj list entries are list_start(1)=2, list_end(1)=2 \u2192 loop over i_node=2.\n\nadj_array(2)=0. \n\nw =0 equals parent (0), so skipped.\n\nThus a=0, o=0. returned res =2*0 +0+1=1. \n\n then when returning to node0's processing: \n\n the r=1.\n\na +=1/2 \u2192 0. \n\n o +=1 mod 2 \u21921 \u2192o becomes 1.\n\nSo the node0's calculation: \n\nres = 0*2 plus min(1,1 \u21921) \u21921 +1 \u21922. \n\nThus, max_val=2 \u2192m=1. 2*1=2 ==2 \u2192 output Second.\n\nWhich matches the code's logic.\n\nHence, looks correct.\n\nNow the code should now be correct. \n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nSo putting everything correctly:\n\nThe potential code:\n\nprogram agc_problem\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, edges_num, max_val, m, i\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a_edges(:), b_edges(:), count_deg(:), list_start(:), list_end(:), adj_array(:)\n\n    integer, allocatable :: current_pos(:)\n\n    contains\n\n        recursive function maxMatching(v, parent) result(res)\n            integer, intent(in) :: v, parent\n            integer :: res\n            integer :: a, o, w, i_node, r\n            a = 0\n            o = 0\n            do i_node = list_start(v), list_end(v)\n                w = adj_array(i_node)\n                if (w == parent) cycle\n                r = maxMatching(w, v)\n                a = a + r / 2\n                o = o + mod(r, 2)\n            end do\n            res = 2 * a + min(1, o) + 1\n        end function maxMatching\n\n    begin:\n        !

If list_start is an array from 0 to n-1, then yes. \n\nIn Fortran, you can assign array values like current_pos = list_start provided both have the same bounds and type.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nallocate(current_pos(0:n-1)), then list_start(0:n-1) also. \n\nThus, the assignment current_pos = list_start is valid.\n\nNext, in the fill-adj loop:\n\nLoop over the edges (the edges_num times):\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n    a_val =a_edges(i) \u2192 which is stored as 0-based\n\nThen, adj_array's slot is current_pos(a_val). \n\nThe indices for adj_array are 1:sum_adj.\n\nBut when current_pos(a_val) is accessed, after ensuring it's within the allocated array?\n\nSince current_pos is zero-based v nodes, but current_pos(a_val) starts at 1 and increments appropriately.\n\nTesting N=2 case:\n\nfor a_val =0 (assuming first edge):\n\ncurrent_pos is initialized at list_start(v) \u2192 for v=0, current_pos(0) is 1.\n\nThus adj_array(1) gets set to b_val.\n\nSimilarly for other nodes.\n\nThus, code should be okay.\n\nThus, this should be the final Fortran code."
