    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what this Java code does. \n\nThe main goal of the code is to check if a number is \"lucky\". A number is considered lucky here if the sum of the first half of its digits equals the sum of the second half. Additionally, the number should only contain digits 4 and 7. \n\nLet me go through the Java code step by step to see how it works.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n (length of the string) and a string str. It checks each character in the string to ensure they are only '4' or '7'. If any character isn't, it sets a flag t to 1. Then, if that flag is 1, it outputs NO immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the sums for the first and second halves. If those sums are equal, it outputs YES; else NO.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me note that Fortran uses different syntax for variables, arrays, loops, and I/O.\n\nFirst, variables: The Java uses integers x, y, t, n, and a String str which is converted to a character array. In Fortran, I can read the input as a string (character variable) and process it.\n\nDealing with the characters: In Fortran, the string can be a character array. Each character can be tested to see if it is '4' or '7'. If any character other than those is found, set a flag (t) to 1.\n\nThe sums: x is the sum of first half's digits. y is the sum of the second half's digits. Since the string is in a character array in Fortran, I can loop through them. \n\nWait, how to convert a character to integer in Fortran? For a character c, c - '0' will give the numeric value. That's present in intrinsic function, like ichar(c) - ichar('0').\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and then the string. But wait, in Java code, 'n' is the integer input, then the string is read. In Fortran, perhaps the input could be the string first, then its length would be n, but maybe the user enters n first and then the string. That way, check if the string's length is exactly n? Or perhaps the program can trust the user input. In the problem's context, maybe the correct approach is to read n first, then read the string. Then, maybe the string length can be different? Well, in the Java code, 'n' must be the length of the string, as the loop uses 'n' to loop over the string's characters (they just converted to a char array using toCharArray(). But perhaps the Java code reads n as the length? Or maybe the code is assuming that the next input is a string of length n? Wait, the Java code first reads an integer n, then a String, and then converts the string into char array. So in Fortran, I need to read an integer n and then a string. However, in Fortran, reading a string with a variable length can be tricky. You can read it as a certain size, but maybe better to read the string, then find its length, but in this code, n is given as input, so perhaps the code expects that the string's length equals n. The Java code uses the string's toCharArray() which gets its actual length. Hmm, so perhaps there's a problem when n is not equal to the string length? Because in the code, the loop runs for i <n, but if the string is shorter than n, then it would cause a problem. But in the original code's problem (from codeforces), perhaps the input is structured so that n is indeed the length, so in Fortran, that assumption is okay. So in Fortran code: read n, then read the string (even if it's longer, but perhaps trimming it or something? Well, perhaps better to read a string of length n, but in Fortran, when reading a string, it includes all characters until the end or until the next format. Hmm. So perhaps better to read the string as a single word, then check if its length is exactly n. Maybe the problem's input always gives correct data. So proceed as per that. )\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read integer n.\n\n2. Read the string (in Fortran using read(*,'(a)') command). Let's get the string into a character variable of sufficient length. Let's say, create a character array of size (say) 100 or variable length? In Fortran, perhaps define a character variable str*100. But to be compatible with n, the safest is to have the string length at least n, but since n is provided, then the program will use it. So in code:\n\nfirst, read n.\n\nThen read str.\n\nThen, check whether the string's length is exactly n? Well, perhaps the code is written such that n is the length, so proceed to use the first n characters, but in the problem, it's probably a test input where n and the string's length match. \n\nAlternatively, compute the length of str as len_trim? But according to the Java code, uses 'str.toCharArray()', which should be exactly the length of the string. \n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran, after reading the string, we can trim it into a length of n. Let me think.\n\nIn any case, the code loops through each character up to n in the Java code, so in Fortran, I need to read a string of exactly n characters. Let me think: perhaps, in the Fortran input line, use read(*,*) n\n\nThen read the next line as a string (as the input). So, assuming that the string is the next input, and is exactly n characters long? In programming competition problems usually the inputs are correct. So proceed.\n\nIn code:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str !assuming max length as 1000 or better with allocatable, but here, for simplicity.\n\nBut perhaps better to read the string in an array of characters. So:\n\nDECLARE n as an integer. Read n.\n\nThen read a string (str) as a variable, and then access its individual characters as str(1:1), etc. Wait, in FORTRAN, unlike C, the strings are indexed from 1, and characters in an array have indices starting at 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninteger :: n, i, t=0\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: str\n\nreal, parameter x=0, y=0\n\n... Or better:\n\nWait variables. Let me list variables:\n\nx: integer to sum first half digits.\n\ny: same for second half.\n\nt: flag for any invalid character (0 is okay, else 1).\n\nThen the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read str. Trim if needed? Or not?\n\n3. Check each character in str (positions 1 to n) whether it is '4' or '7'. If any is not, set t=1.\n\nIf t is 1, print \"NO\".\n\nElse compute x (sum of first half digits) and y (sum of second half's digits). \n\nFirst calculate n/2. Let's suppose n is even?\n\nWait, the original Java code loops for i from 0 to n/2-1 (since it's \"i< n / 2; i++\", starting from 0). Then for the second loop, the loop is \"i=n-1 down to (n/2)-1 (since (n/2)-1 is the midpoint -1? So for example, for n=4:\n\nfirst half: i=0 and 1 (indices 0 to 1 (count of 2 elements (4 digits) first half is first 2), then the second loop would start at n-1 (index 3) down to (n/2)=2-1? Wait wait.\n\nWait, in Java's second loop is:\n\nfor (int i = n - 1; i > (n / 2) - 1; i--)\n\nWhich is i starts at n-1 (Java indices start at 0), and goes down to (n/2) -0.5? Wait, (n/2) with integer division. In Java, n=4, n/2 is 2. So (n/2)-1 =1. Thus the upper part would be for elements from n-1 downto (n div 2). (Wait let's see for n=4:\n\nloop for i from 3 downto greater than (2-1)=1; i steps down to 2? \n\nWait the condition is i > (n/2)-1. For n=4:\n\n(n/2) is 2, minus 1 is 1. The loop continues while i>1. So when i is 3,2, then when i=1, it's not greater than 1. Wait, the loop for i from n-1 (3) downto to i greater than (n/2 -1) which is 1. Hmm, so the upper part would be indices from 3 downto 2, so those are two elements.\n\nThe total first half count: n/2 elements (for even n). \n\nSecond half also is n/2 elements. So in total, the first half is 0...n/2-1 (indices 0 to 2-1 for n=4, since n/2=2, so first half indices 0 and1). Second half indices 2 and 3 (if starting from index 0). \n\nWait in FORTRAN, since characters start at 1.\n\nSo for n=4, the first half is positions 1 to 2, second half 3 and 4. \n\nTranslating to the loops in Fortran.\n\nFirst loop for x: sum characters 1 to n/2.\n\nSecond loop for y: sum characters (n/2+1) to n?\n\nWait, no in the Java code, the second loop is:\n\nfor (int i =n-1 downto when i is greater than (n/2-1). So in Fortran:\n\nBut in original Java code, for the second part:\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i> (n/2) -1; i--). Let's do that for n=4. Then (n/2) is 2. Subtract 1 \u21921. So i >1 \u2192 yes, when i starts from 3 (assuming n-1 is 3), so i from 3 down to 2 (since when i=2, it's greater than 1?). \n\nWait, when (n/2) -1 is 1, then the loop while i>1? So i can be 3 and 2 (since 3>1 and 2>1), but when i becomes 1, it stops. So that gives indices 3 and 2. But their numeric values are added to y. \n\nWait, but the order (since decrementing from end to middle? \n\nThe loop in Java for y:\n\nThe variable i starts at the end of the string (index n-1, which is last character) and moves backward towards ( (n//2) -1 ), but as long as i is greater than (n/2 -1), so the indices are from n-1 down to (n/2). For n even: example n=4, so the second loop's i's are 3 and 2 (indices 3 and 2). So the characters at 3 and 2 positions (Java indices, which are positions 4 and 3 in actual number's digits, since indices are from 0 to 3). Thus those two digits contribute to y. But wait, those are the last two characters. So the second half is taking the last n/2 digits and summing their values. \n\nWait so the first loop sums the first half's characters (the first n/2 digits), and the second loop sums the last n/2 characters. \n\nSo in FORTRAN, the first loop is straightforward for first n/2 digits.\n\nThe second loop can also be done by adding from n/2+1 up, but perhaps easier to loop over the second half. Alternatively, use a loop from i = n down to (n)/2 +1.\n\nWait for n=4:\n\nfirst half \u2192 1-2: sums these two.\n\nsecond loop is from 3 (3rd character) to 4 (4th character), because the last two digits (Java has in positions 0-3, so their indices would be 2 and3 in Java, but when translated to FORTRAN which starts at 1: 3 and4. So: \n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nfirst loop: from 1 to (n/2). \n\nsecond loop: from (n/2 +1) to n.\n\nWait the code in Java:\n\nfor the second loop, the code uses the other end.\n\nWait but in the code for y:\n\nIn the Java code for the second part:\n\nfor (int i = n -1; i> (n/2)-1; i--)\n\nso in terms of FORTRAN indices (assuming the first digit is stored in str(1) (character array), then the loop from the end backwards to the (n/2)th element. Wait for Fortran 1-based indexes, when n is 4:\n\ni in the loop: \n\nLoop counter (Java) is from 3 downto (since n=4, n-1=3) to i>1 (since (n/2)-1 is 2-1=1).\n\nSo the indices in java are 3 and 2 \u2192 which map to FORTRAN indices 4 and 3 (since array starts at 1 vs 0).\n\nWait Java's 0-based:\n\nJava i may be variable up to n-1, so for Java's code up to n-1 = 3 (for n=4), which is FORTRAN's position 4.\n\nTherefore the total sum:\n\nfirst loop sums first two (Java 0 and1 \u2192 FORTRAN 1 and2),\n\nsecond sums the last two (Java 2 and3 \u2192 FORTRAN 3 and4.\n\nSo the code in FORTRAN could loop over i from n down to n/2 +1 (since (n/2) +1 is the start of the latter half?\n\nAlternatively, it's better to loop from the start to the middle for the first sum and the start from the end for the second. But in code:\n\nThe code can proceed as follows:\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nx and y are integers initialized to 0.\n\nThen for the first half:\n\ndo i =1, n/2\n\n x =x + numeric value of str(i)\n\nenddo \n\nfor the second half, starting at ( (n/2)+1 ) up to n:\n\ndo i= n_int - n_div2 +1 ... wait not sure, perhaps better:\n\ndo i = (n/2 +1),n\n\n y = y + numeric value of str(i)\n\nenddo\n\nWait wait, n/2 is integer division in FORTRAN.\n\nThus summing for the first middle elements and the rest. \n\nWait yes! yes. That would give exactly the last (n - (n/2)) digits. Since n is even?\n\nYes if n is even, but even if n is odd, then the code still needs to handle. But according to the original code, the first half is the first n/2 (integer division) elements. The second loop is for the last n/2 elements (since for even n, n/2 is the first and second. For odd, like n=5, the first half is 2 elements, the second half also 2? but maybe the code wants to split the digits such that total first and second sums are (floor(n/2))? Wait the Java code loops for i <n/2, so in the case of n=5, the n/2 is 2.5 rounded down to 2. Then the first half is 2 elements, second would be 3 elements?\n\nWait let's see: for n=5, n/2=2 (in integer division in Java), so the first loop is for 0 to 1 (2 chars). The second loop's equation:\n\ni starts at n-1 (4 in 0-based). The condition i > (n/2)-1 \u2192 (2-1)=1 \u2192 i>1 \u2192 so i can be from 4 down to 2 (since (n/2)-1 is 1, so i must be >1. When i=2 (0-based), the condition is 2>1 \u2192 yes). So like:\n\nFor n=5:\n\nJava indices for second part are from 4 downto 2 \u2192 the 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits (in FORTRAN terms, 5,4,3. Because 4 would be position5 in FORTRAN and their digits:\n\nthe second half includes the last 3 digits? Because n=5, so the first two and then last three. The sum would be the first 2 and last 3. \n\nWait in original problem: when the length is odd, then the total sums will split into the first floor(n/2) and last floor(n/2), but then the middle digit is not counted? \n\nWait the code in Java would take first n/2 (2) and second loop the remaining 3 digits? Wait for n=5:\n\nThe second loop would run from n-1 (4 in 0-based \u2192 the fifth character) down to (n/2)-1 \u2192 (2-1)=1. So the value of i must be >1 \u2192 so when i is 4 (ASCII for 5?), but wait index4 present.\n\nWait no, when n=5, n/2 in Java is 2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2 (as in the cast of 'int'). The 'n//2' would be 2.\n\nThe loop condition for the second loop is i> (2-1)=1 \u2192 so i can be 4,3,2 (thiS in Java indices).\n\nWait for i=2 \u2192 which is the third element of the character array (0-based), so the third digit. So the second part's indices are 2,3,4 \u2192 summing the third, fourth and fifth elements? Hmm, that way, the sums are not exactly equal length. That's due to handling the odd length. Perhaps the problem expects the entire sum of the entire first half and the second half with their exact middle? Not sure, but the Java code uses exactly the same approach. So the code in FORTRAN must mimic that.\n\nSo the code's logic must split the first n/2 digits (with integer div) and the second n/2, but for odd n, the total is n/2 and n/2 (but not using the middle digit?), but according to the Java code, total for n=5:\n\nfirst half: two digits (indices0-1), the second loop includes indices 2,3,4 \u2192 three digits. So their sums would each be the first two and the last three digits' sum. \n\nThus the code will compare those two sums.\n\nNow, to code:\n\nNow, the steps for FORTRAN code:\n\nRead n and the string.\n\nThen loop through each character in the string's first n characters (since the input may have input of n first then the string). Check if each is '4' or '7'\n\nThen, if not, set t=1. \n\nThen proceed.\n\nElse compute the sums for the halves.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nVariables declaration:\n\ninteger :: n, x, y, t =0, i, mid\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: str\n\ncharacter :: c\n\nBut in\u6e24\u6d77 FORTRAN can be structured as such.\n\nFirst:\n\nread *, n\n\nread (*,*) str ! however, in Fortran when reading a string with read(*,*) str, it might stop at whitespace. So In programming competitions, it's better to read entire line. Perhaps use the following approach:\n\nAfter reading n, read the next line into str, trimming any leading or trailing spaces?\n\nAlternatively, use read(*,'(a)') str. This will read everything up until end of the line.\n\nBut in code:\n\nprogram codeforces_146_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, x, y, t, i\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: str\n\n! Read inputs\n\nread*,n\n\nread(*,'(a)') str\n\n! Process\n\nt=0\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n    if (str(i:i)/='4' .and. str(i:i)/='7') then\n\n        t=1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nif(t ==1) then\n\n    print*,'NO'\n\nelse\n\n    x=0\n\n    y=0\n\n    ! Sum the first half\n\n    do i=1, n/2\n\n        x = x + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n    end do\n\n    ! Sum the second half (from n/2 +1 to n)\n\n    do i = n/2 +1, n\n\n        y = y + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\n    end do\n\n    if(x == y) then\n\n        print*, 'YES'\n\n    else\n\n        print*, 'NO'\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nend program\n\nWait, but let me check for n= even:\n\nTake n=4:\n\nFirst half is 1 and 2 \u2192 first two, second half 3 and4 \u2192 so their sums are correct.\n\nYes. For n=5. The first half is 1-2 (2 digits). The second part is from 3 to5 \u2192 3 digits. \n\nOriginally in java code, the second loop would include those three digits. \n\nSo that code should match the original logic.\n\nWait for java code's loop on the second half: in java's loop is from i= n-1 downto ... For n=5, n-1=4 (zero-based) which corresponds to FORTRAN 5th character (str(5). So the second loop goes from last character backwards through the third (the middle) character.\n\nThe loop in Java:\n\nThe second loop would iterate when i is 4 (5) \u2192 YES (in Java's terms, the fifth character).\n\nWait in FORTRAN code above's second loop:\n\nthe second loop runs from n/2 +1 (which is 3) to n (5). So for i=3,4,5 \u2192 thus the sum of three characters (the middle character is included here).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus the code would correctly capture the same sum.\n\nAnother point to verify: For \"4444\" gives n=4. The first two are '4' and '4' sum to 8. The second two also sum 8 \u2192 \"YES\"\n\nAnother case: \"4744\"\n\nn=4, the first two sum 4+7=11, second two (4+4)=8 \u2192 different \u2192 \"NO\".\n\nThus the code seems correct.\n\nWait also, check the case where the input is \"444\" (n=3).\n\nThen first half is two 4s \u2192 sum 8. Second part 4 \u2192 sum4. 8 not equal to 4 \u2192 output NO.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nNow, also need to check that if the string is correct (contains only 4 and7), else output NO.\n\nThus, all parts should be okay.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nIn Fortran, the READ statements may have to be written carefully.\n\nThe first read reads n, then second read the string as a line (so the STR can have up to n characters). However, if the input has more than n, but in the problem's context, that won't happen. So that's acceptable.\n\nThe variable x and y should be initialized to 0 before the loops.\n\nThe conversion of the character to its numeric value is done via ICHAR(c) - ICHAR('0'). For a '4', ICHAR is (depends on ASCII, but 52, minus 48 gives 4, so that's correct.\n\nTesting in code:\n\nWait in Fortran, the statement:\n\nx = x + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nYes, because str is a character array. Each element can be taken as the single character.\n\nEdge case when n=0? Probably not, but the problem's constraints say probably n>0.\n\nAnother case when n=1 \u2192 '4' \u2192 then first half is i=1 to 0 \u2192 wait n/2 is 0. \n\nWait when n=1: first half loop would be Do i=1 to n/2 (0.5 \u2192 integer division in Fortran is 0). Thus, the loop from 1 to0 does not execute. So x=0.\n\nSecond loop starts at n/2 +1 = 1, so to 1.\n\nSo y's loop is i=1 to 1 \u2192 adding first digit (which is the only one). \n\nThus total x=0, y=4 \u2192 0 vs4 \u2192 NO.\n\nThe original Java code for n=1:\n\nIt would check the first half: first (n)/2 iterations \u2192 which is 0.5 \u2192 integer division \u2192 0 \u2192 so loop does not run. So x is 0.\n\nSecond loop for n=1 is:\n\nloop i=0 downto ... Wait let me see:\n\nJava in the case n=1, n-1 is 0; the loop condition i> (0.5-1= -0.5 \u2192 floor(n/2)-1: since n/2 as integer is 0. So (n/2) -1 = -1. \n\nWait in Java, the loop would start at 0 (n-1=0), and check against:\n\ni> (n/2 -1) \u2192 (0 vs (0-1)= -1 )\n\nso i=0 is greater than -1 \u2192 So the loop would execute for i=0. \n\nSo the code would have y = value of first element (the only one, since loop i=0) \u21924, so x is zero and y is4 \u2192 sum not equal. \n\nSame as in the Fortran code. \n\nThus, code works correctly.\n\nTherefore the Fortran code looks okay.\n\nThe code can be written as:\n\nprogram codeforces_146_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, x, y, t, i\n  character(len=200) :: str\n\n  ! Reading the input\n  read *, n\n  read (*,'(a)') str\n\n  t = 0\n  ! Checking if all characters are '4' or '7'\n  do i = 1, n\n    if (str(i:i) /= '4' .and. str(i:i) /= '7') then\n      t = 1\n      exit\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  if (t == 1) then\n    print *, 'NO'\n  else\n    x = 0\n    y = 0\n\n    ! Summing first half\n    do i = 1, n/2\n      x = x + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n    end do\n\n    ! Summing second half\n    do i = (n/2)+1, n\n      y = y + ichar(str(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n    end do\n\n    ! Comparing sums\n    if (x == y) then\n      print *, 'YES'\n    else\n      print *, 'NO'\n    end if\n  end if\nend program codeforces_146_A\n\nWait, but in the first loop where we check characters, since n can be up to 100? Well, assuming the string length is at least n. The code reads up to n characters via the loop (even if the string is longer).\n\nThe loop can be terminated earlier with an exit once a invalid char is found, so added 'exit' for efficiency. But in FORTRAN, using the loop until n and then setting the flag is okay. However, using exit will make it more efficient.\n\nAdding exit is better, but even without it, the code will still work as the flag will be set to 1 and any further iterations will not change it but just take more time. But including \"exit\" makes the flag check redundant for further iterations \u2192 better.\n\nWait, yes. So in the code above, after setting t=1, better to break the loop. Hence I added exit.\n\nAnother note: FORTRAN character variables are padded with space when the entered string is shorter than the declared length. So when reading a string (even with read(*,a), the remaining spots are filled with spaces. So the loop must process exactly first n characters, which the n is the first input, so it's okay as long as the code checks exactly n characters.\n\nHence this should work."
