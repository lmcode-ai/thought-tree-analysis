    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads a string from the user. Then it converts the string into a character array. It uses a HashMap to count the occurrences of each character. After building the map, it checks if every character in the map has exactly two occurrences and that there are exactly two distinct characters. If both conditions are met, it prints \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nHmm, Fortran doesn't have a built-in HashMap like Java. So I need to find an alternative way to count character frequencies. Maybe using an array where the indices represent characters. Since the problem probably uses lowercase letters (given typical programming contest problems), I can consider characters from 'a' to 'z'. That's 26 letters. So an array of size 26 initialized to 0 should work.\n\nWait, but what if the input contains uppercase? The problem statement isn't clear. Let me think: in the original code, the input is taken as a string and each character is processed as is. Since in programming contests, sometimes case-sensitive, but the problem might expect lowercase. Let me proceed under that assumption, but maybe in code, just use the ASCII values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is specifically for lowercase letters. Let me proceed assuming that, so the characters are lowercase a-z. So each character can be mapped to its position in 'a' (e.g., 'a' - 'a' is 0, up to 'z' - 'a'=25). \n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. Read the input string. In Fortran, read a character string from stdin.\n\n2. Initialize an integer array of size 26 to count frequencies.\n\n3. Loop over each character in the string, increment the corresponding array element.\n\n4. After counting, check two conditions:\n\n   a) Each non-zero element in the array must be exactly 2.\n\n   b) Exactly two elements in the array are 2 (since each character must occur exactly twice, and there are two characters, total counts would be 2*2=4, which matches the string length test as well but maybe not. Wait, the string length must be 4 if there are two characters each appearing twice. Wait the required condition is that each is exactly 2, and there are two entries in the hash (so that exactly two characters present, each with two occurrences). Therefore, the total length must be 4. But the code checks the size of the map (number of keys) is 2. So in Fortran, the array counts will have exactly two indices with 2, and all others 0.\n\n5. Count how many elements in the array are equal to 2. If exactly two, then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nBut maybe the code should count the number of non-zero elements. Let me re-examine the Java code's logic: In the for loop over map entries, it checks that every entry's value is exactly 2. So the map must have exactly two entries (since the code also checks map.size()==2), and each of them has a value 2. So in Fortran:\n\nWe can loop through the counts array, check that exactly two of them are 2, and the rest are 0. \n\nHow to implement this:\n\n- Initialize count array with zeros.\n\n- For each character in the input string, increment counts(char).\n\n- After counting, check two conditions:\n\n   a) The total number of characters should be 4 (since 2 characters each twice). So if the length of input is not 4, it's automatically no.\n\n   b) The counts must have exactly two elements with 2, and others zero.\n\nWait, perhaps first checking the length? Because if the input is length not equal to 4, then it's definitely invalid. So first step: check len_trim(s) is 4. Else print no.\n\nThen check the rest.\n\nHmm, the code in Java may not check the length, because the loop over the map would handle it. But adding length check as an optimization could help.\n\nBut in any case, here's how I can approach this in Fortran:\n\nRead the string, then:\n\n1. Let string be of length N. So first check N ==4. If not, print \"No\".\n\n2. Initialize count array [26].\n\n3. For each character in the string:\n\n   - Convert to lower case if necessary (if the problem allows uppercase but the problem expects case-insensitive). Wait, the original code doesn't do case conversion, so maybe it's case-sensitive. For example, 'ABcd' has four different characters, so counts would be A, B, c, d each appearing once, so would not qualify.\n\nIn Fortran, if the input has uppercase, like 'AB', the code would treat 'A' and 'B' as different characters unless converted. But the Java code does exactly that. So we have to represent characters exactly as given.\n\nTherefore, to mimic the Java code exactly, need to treat uppercase and lowercase as different. Since Java uses characters as read, so the Fortran code must do so.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, characters can be treated as integers via IACHAR or the character's ASCII value. Let me think: the problem might be assuming all lowercase, but the code should be general.\n\nBut in the absence of specific constraints, better to handle all possible valid characters.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed so that each character occurs exactly twice. The question is about whether exactly two distinct characters exist each occurring exactly twice, so the total length must be 4. Therefore, the first check would be that the length is 4, otherwise output \"No\". This could be an optimization. Let's see in the Java code, the length could be 4 but counts may not be correct, but the code checks the two conditions. Let me see.\n\nJava code:\n\n- reads the entire input (using in.next(), which takes until whitespace, but in this case, the input is a single word. Because next() returns the next token, but with default delimiter, which is whitespace. But if the problem expects the input is exactly one string (like 4 or more characters), maybe.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the Scanner's next() takes the next token, but in the online judge scenarios, it's possible that the input is given as one word. So the input is a single string, perhaps of length 4, but that's a possibility. But the Java code does not check the length.\n\nWait, the code can work even with a longer string if the first two characters are each present twice in the entire string, but the rest of the letters may not. So the problem may have some specific input length, but given that the code in question is for a programming contest (the problem name is atcoder_ABC132_A), probably the input has exactly 4 characters, so that this code can work, but the code could handle longer strings.\n\nIn the problem statement for ABC132 A, let me think: problem might be \"Different Dishes on Different Days\". Which likely requires the input be a 4-letter string where each of the first two days have exactly two dishes each (like \"AABB\" would be yes, \"ABBB\" no).\n\nWait, the actual problem requires that exactly two different letters, each appearing exactly two times. So the code from Java would output yes only when the string has exactly two distinct characters each exactly two times. So the total length has to be 4. So first, perhaps the code should check the length is 4? But in Java's code, they don't do that, but their code would work for that scenario. Because if the length is not 4, then the resulting counts would not satisfy the required conditions, resulting in a 'No'.\n\nFor example, if the string is \"AAA\" (3 chars), then the counts would have 'A' 3, and since the map would have size 1. The second loop would check each value: 3 !=2 \u2192 ok becomes false. So the output would be correct 'No'.\n\nSo including the length check is redundant but not crucial for correctness, but maybe more efficient. So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to first check the length is 4. Because otherwise, even if the string is 3, then the code can just output no.\n\nSo let's structure the code as:\n\nRead the input string. Then check its length is 4. If not, output No.\n\nElse proceed to count.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the code in the question does it without that, which it does. So I should proceed as the original code, but the first check can be added for better efficiency, but correctness is maintained.\n\nIn any case, here's how to proceed.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe can write a program, let's name it similar, like atcoder_ABC132_A.f90.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- THE_STRING: a character string. Let's make it sufficient length, maybe 4 or 10. For a competition problem, perhaps 4 is sufficient, but maybe to be safe, let's read it as length of 10.\n\n- count array: to count occurrence of each character.\n\nWait, the problem is, which characters are considered? Since the original code treats characters as they are (e.g., including uppercase, lowercase, etc.), we can treat each character's ASCII code. So for example, 'a' is different from 'A'.\n\nIn Fortran, a character has an ASCII value, which can be obtained via IACHAR(). The possible ASCII values are 0-127 (or using a larger range if the compiler uses Unicode, but for programming contests, assuming ASCII).\n\nTo count all possible characters, the count array can have an element for each possible ASCII value. But ASCII has 256 (0-255). So an array of 256 elements.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem restricts to lowercase letters, then using (26 elements) is okay. To be safe, perhaps use 256 elements.\n\nHmm. Let me see: For the code to exactly replicate the original Java code, we need to treat each character's code correctly.\n\nIn Java, the char type is 16 bits (Unicode). But in the problem, perhaps all inputs are lowercase letters like a-z, so their ASCII codes are 97-122.\n\nBut maybe we should use the ASCII values (for example, in Fortran, each character is 8 bits, so 256 possibilities). So the count array will be dimensioned as size 256, with integer values, initially 0.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension (0:255) :: count = 0\n\nWait, in Fortran, to initialize arrays all to 0 can be done with:\n\ncount = 0, but need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, declare as:\n\ninteger :: count(0:255) = 0\n\nOr in the code:\n\ncount = 0\n\nWait, perhaps the code structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC132_A\n  implicit none\n  character (len=10) :: s\n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n  integer :: i, len_s\n  logical :: ok\n  read(*,'(A)') s\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n  ok = .true.\n  if (len_s /=4) then\n    print *, 'No'\n    stop\n  end if\n  do i =1, len_s\n    count(ichar(s(i:i))) = count(ichar(s(i:i))) +1\n  end do\n  ! Now check each entry in count with count>0 is exactly 2, and exactly two such entries\n  integer :: num_two =0\n  do i=0,255\n    if (count(i) ==2 ) then\n      num_two = num_two +1\n    else if (count(i) ==0) then \n      ! do nothing\n    else\n      ! found a count not 0 or 2, so set ok =.false.\n      ok = .false.\n      exit\n    end if\n  end do\n\nWait wait, no. Let me see. The code can be structured as follows:\n\nFirst, after counting, check all elements in count array must be either 0, 2. So loop over the array and verify this.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nInitialize a counter for the number of elements with count exactly equal to 2, and another to see whether any count is not 0 or 2.\n\nLet me try:\n\ninteger :: num_two=0, other=0\ndo i=0,255\n  if (count(i) ==2 ) then\n    num_two = num_two +1\n  else if ( count(i) >0 .or. count(i)/=2 ) then\n    other =1\n    exit\n  end if\nend do\nif (other /=0 .or. num_two /=2) then\n  ok = .false.\nelse\n  ok = .true.\nend if\n\nHmm, that might work.\n\nWait, but the loop can break early. So:\n\nlogical :: has_invalid = .false.\ninteger :: num_two=0\ndo i=0,255\n   if (count(i) ==0 ) cycle\n   if ( count(i)/=2 ) then\n      has_invalid = .true.\n      exit\n   else \n      num_two = num_two+1\n   end if\nend do\nif ( has_invalid .or. num_two /=2 ) then\n   ok = .false.\nelse\n   ok = .true.\nend if\n\nYes, that's better. \n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nInitialize ok as .true.\n\n ok = (num_two ==2) and (no other non-zero counts that are not 2)\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nFirst, check all non-zero counts are 2, and the number of them is exactly two.\n\nTo do this, we can loop through all possible count values:\n\nok = .true.\n\nnum_two =0\n\ndo i=0,255:\n   if ( count(i) ==0) cycle\n   if (count(i) /=2 ) then\n      ok = .false.\n      exit\n   else\n      num_two= num_two +1\n   end if\nend do\n\nAfter this loop, ok is true only if all non-zero counts are 2, and after this, we need to check that num_two is exactly 2. \n\nWait, no. Because after the above loop, if ok is true, that means that all non-zero counts are exactly 2. But then we have to make sure num_two equals 2. Because if the count had, say three counts of 2 (like three different characters, but each count is 2), that would give num_two=3 and then fail.\n\nWait, the code in the Java requires that the map has size 2, which is exactly the number of entries with count >=1 \u2192 exactly two unique characters, each with two counts. So in the code above, after the loop, if ok is true, then all counts are 0 or 2. Therefore the num_two = number of entries with count 2.\n\nThus, in this case, after the loop:\n\nif ok (i.e., all non-zero counts are 2), then check that num_two ==2. If yes, then ok remains true. else ok set to false.\n\nWait, no, the 'ok' variable is already true or not based on whether all counts are 0 or 2. So after the loop, the 'ok' could be true, but to also check if num_two is exactly 2.\n\nWait the loop's logic:\n\nIf any count(i) is non-zero and not 2, then ok becomes false, loop restarts checking other counts (though, but exit).\n\nWait, correct: once ok has been set to false the loop breaks.\n\nAlternatively, the loop continues checking all counts. Wait the 'exit' statement causes the loop to terminate when any count is bad. So after the loop, 'ok' is true only when all counts that are non-zero are exactly 2 (because we checked all).\n\nBut then, the number of non-zero entries (num_two) could be anything higher than 2. \n\nWait, no. Because num_two counts how many entries had exactly 2.\n\nWait in the code above:\n\nif (count(i) ==0 \u2192 skip (cycle)\n\nelse \u2192 if the count is not 2 \u2192 ok = false and exit. \n\nelse \u2192 add to num_two\n\nSo when ok is still true after the loop, it means that all non-zero entries had count==2 (so loop went through all i, and for non-zero counts, they were 2 and contributed to num_two).\n\nTherefore after the loop, if ok is still true (i.e., no invalid counts), then the second check is that num_two equals 2. \n\nBecause the problem requires exactly two distinct characters (each with two counts). So total two in num_two \u2192 then it's ok.\n\nTherefore the final conditions are:\n\nok = (ok) .and. (num_two == 2)\n\nThus, in code:\n\nAfter the first loop, handle the ok situation:\n\nif ok then \n\n   if (num_two ==2) then \u2192 ok remains true.\n\n   else \u2192 ok set to false.\n\nend if\n\nSo:\n\nif(ok) then\n\n   if (num_two /=2 ) then\n\n      ok =.false.\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nHmm, putting all together:\n\nInitialize variables.\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck length is 4, else output no, exit.\n\nElse, count each character.\n\nThen check counts as above.\n\nNow, in Fortran code steps:\n\nNow let me draft the code step by step.\n\nThe program structure:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC132_A (don't use underscores, maybe atcoder_ABC132_A is okay if Fortran allows underscores in identifiers, which Fortran 90 does.)\n\nBut let me check syntax.\n\nAlso, when declaring variables:\n\ncounts can be an array.\n\nThe code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC132_A\n  implicit none\n  character(len=10) :: s \n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n  logical :: ok = .true.\n  integer :: i, len_s\n  integer :: num_two =0\n  read(*, '(A)') s\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n  if (len_s /=4) then\n     print *, 'No'\n     stop\n  end if\n\n  do i =1, len_s\n    integer :: c = ichar(s(i:i))\n    count(c) = count(c) +1\n end do\n\n num_two =0\n ok = .true.\n do i=0,255\n     if (count(i) ==0 ) cycle\n     if (count(i)/=2 ) then\n        ok = .false.\n        exit\n     else\n        num_two = num_two +1\n     end if\n end do\n\n if (ok) then\n    if (num_two /=2 ) ok = .false.\n end if\n\n if (ok) then\n    print *, 'Yes'\n else\n    print *, 'No'\n end if\nend program\n\nWait, but in the loop, when the code is in the loop over all i from 0-255, when a count is non-zero:\n\n- if it's not two \u2192 ok set to false, then exit loop.\n\nBut suppose all counts are zero except two counts with value 2. Then the loop ends with num_two=2 and ok=true. Then the check is ok and required.\n\nOtherwise, if there's a count not 0 or 2, then ok is false. \n\nThus the logic seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where during the counting of all elements:\n\nSuppose a code where a count is 0, so cycle.\n\nothers are all exactly 2 except one count of 3.\n\nThen when i reaches the count of 3, ok is set to false and exit loop. So the loop exits early. The num_two may not have counted all 2's, but ok is false, so the rest of the checks won't matter.\n\nThe 'num_two' variable is only used when ok is true. Because in the later if (ok) then \u2192 then, we check if num_two equals 2.\n\nThus, this is okay.\n\nPossible edge cases. Like:\n\nTest case 'ABCD' \u2192 counts each 1. So loop would hit first 1 (count is 1 \u2192 not 2), set ok to false \u2192 output No.\n\nTest case 'AAAA' \u2192 count for 'A' is 4, others 0. \u2192 during loop, the 'A's count=4\u22602 \u2192 ok set to false.\n\nTest case 'AABB' \u2192 counts for A:2, B:2 \u2192 ok is true, num_two is 2 \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nTest case 'ABAB' \u2192 same as above \u2192 yes.\n\nTest case with four letters, two with 2 and another with 1 \u2192 for example 'AABC':\n\nCounts: A:2, B:1, C:1 \u2192 \u2192 during the loop, when first hit B (count 1), set ok to false.\n\nSo all should work.\n\nNow testing another test case where two characters each twice: counts=2 and 2, others zero, so num_two=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nAnother: three characters (e.g., 'AABB' + 'CC' \u2192 wait no. Only length 4. Suppose 'AABC' \u2192 counts would have A:2, B:1, C:1 \u2192 and the first non-2 count would cause ok to be false.\n\nAnother case, 'AABB', the counts for 'A' and 'B' both 2 \u2192 which passes both conditions.\n\nNow, let's adjust the code.\n\nWait, in the reading part, using read(*,'(A)') s \u2192 this reads until end of line? In Fortran, the format A reads the entire line? Or perhaps A10 is better, but in this case, if the input is up to 10 characters, but the code first checks the trimmed length. Wait, in Fortran:\n\nThe declaration is character(len=10) :: s.\n\nThen, when reading with read(*,'(A)') s \u2192 this reads a string until end of line, but it's stored in a 10-character variable. However, if the input is longer than 10, it would truncate. To be safe, perhaps use read (*,'(A255)') s but given the problem, maybe the input is exactly 4 characters. Since the code checks the len_trim(s), but perhaps better to set the variable length as something sufficient, like 10.\n\nAlternatively, using read(*,'(A)') s \u2192 but in Fortran, I think that would use the whole line, but with s's capacity. Hmm, but maybe using explicit len.\n\nAlternatively, let's set the variable length to be 4.\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: s.\n\nThen read(*,*) s \u2192 but that would stop at first whitespace. But if the input is a single word, it's okay. But perhaps better:\n\nread(*,'(A4)') s \u2192 reads 4 characters, padding with spaces if less. But then len_trim might be less than 4.\n\nWhich would be a problem.\n\nHmm. The safest approach is perhaps read the entire line using a sufficiently large length array, then check the length of the trimmed string.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran:\n\n   character(len=255) :: s\n\n   read (*,'(A)') s \u2192 this reads the entire line, up to 255 characters (but if the line is longer, it might be truncated. But for programming competition problems, input is usually one line, so len_trim(s) will be correct.\n\nSo, here's an alternative code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC132_A\n  implicit none\n  character(len=255) :: s \n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n  logical :: ok = .true.\n  integer :: i, len_s\n  integer :: num_two =0\n  read(*, '(A)') s\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n  if (len_s /=4) then\n     print *, 'No'\n     stop\n  end if\n\n  do i =1, len_s\n    integer :: c = ichar(s(i:i))\n    count(c) = count(c) +1\n end do\n\n num_two =0\n ok = .true.\n do i=0,255\n     if (count(i) ==0 ) cycle\n     if (count(i)/=2 ) then\n        ok = .false.\n        exit\n     else\n        num_two = num_two +1\n     end if\n end do\n\n if (ok) then\n    if (num_two /=2 ) ok = .false.\n end if\n\n if (ok) then\n    print *, 'Yes'\n else\n    print *, 'No'\n end if\nend program\n\nWait, in this case, the len_trim(s) will check that the string after trimming has exactly 4 characters. This way, the code will first reject inputs with different lengths.\n\nThus, this should be correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is in the DO loop for reading characters:\n\nThe variable declaration for c inside the loop: In Fortran, variable declarations must be at the beginning of a scope. So inside the DO loop, you can't declare an integer c. Need to declare it before.\n\nOops, that's a mistake.\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nThe code currently is: do i =1 to len_s \u2192 inside the loop block:\n\ninteger :: c = ichar(s(i:i)). That is not allowed in Fortran. Variables must be declared at the top of the program unit.\n\nCorrection:\n\nI need to declare c before the loop.\n\nSo variables declarations:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC132_A\n  implicit none\n  character(len=255) :: s \n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n  logical :: ok = .true.\n  integer :: i, len_s\n  integer :: num_two =0, c\n\nThen in the loop:\n\ndo i=1, len_s\n  c = ichar(s(i:i))\n  count(c) = count(c) +1\nend do\n\nThat works.\n\nThus corrected:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC132_A\n  implicit none\n  character(len=255) :: s \n  integer :: count(0:255) = 0\n  logical :: ok = .true.\n  integer :: i, len_s\n  integer :: num_two =0, c\n  read(*, '(A)') s\n  len_s = len_trim(s)\n  if (len_s /=4) then\n     print *, 'No'\n     stop\n  end if\n\n  do i =1, len_s\n    c = ichar(s(i:i))\n    count(c) = count(c)+1\n  end do\n\n  num_two =0\n  ok = .true.\n  do i=0,255\n     if (count(i) ==0 ) cycle\n     if (count(i)/=2 ) then\n        ok = .false.\n        exit\n     else\n        num_two = num_two +1\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  if (ok .and. (num_two ==2) ) then\n     print *, 'Yes'\n  else\n     print *, 'No'\n  end if\nend program atcoder_ABC132_A\n\nAlternatively, in the end conditional, it's better to re-arrange as in the original structure.\n\nWait in the previous code:\n\nif (ok) then\n\n   if (num_two ==2) \u2192 ok remains true?\n\nWait, no. The final decision is whether ok is true, and also num_two is two. So the final condition is (ok .and. (num_two ==2)) \u2192 so the code can combine that in the if statement.\n\nIn code:\n\nif(ok) then\n\n    if (num_two ==2) then\n\n        print 'Yes'\n\n    else\n\n        print 'No'\n\n    end if\n\nelse \n\n    print 'No' \n\nend if\n\nWait no, maybe better to combine all in a logical expression:\n\nif( ok .and. num_two ==2 ) then ... \n\nAs written in my corrected code above.\n\nSo that should work.\n\nTesting possible cases:\n\nTest case 1: input 'AABB' \u2192 len=4. counts for 'A' (ASCII 65?), and 'B' (66). counts(65)=2, counts(66)=2.\n\nLoop over all 256:\n\nwhen i=65 \u2192 count=2 \u2192 okay, num_two increments by 1.\n\ni=66 \u2192 count=2 \u2192 num_two becomes 2.\n\nAll other indices have count 0 \u2192 so the loop completes ok remains true.\n\nnum_two is 2 \u2192 condition met. Output yes.\n\nTest case 2: 'ABBA' \u2192 same as above, yes.\n\nTest case 'ABab' \u2192 lower/uppercase? If input has 'ABab', then the ASCII codes are different (assuming uppercase A (65), lowercase a (97) etc). Then counts for 'A', 'B', 'a', 'b' would each be 1 and 1, so counts would have four entries of 1 \u2192 thus in loop, the first count of 1 (at character A) would make ok = false \u2192 output No.\n\nAnother test case: input 'AAAA':\n\nlen is 4. count for 'A'=4 \u2192 during loop, when reaching that i (ASCII for A's value), count is 4, so ok set to false \u2192 output no.\n\nAnother case: 'AABC' \u2192 counts for 'A'=2, 'B'=1, 'C'=1 \u2192 first when B's count (1) \u2192 set ok false.\n\nAnother case 'AABc' \u2192 same as above if 'c' is lowercase \u2192 counts for c is 1 \u2192 \u2192 ok false.\n\nEdge case: 'ABcD' (one lowercase, others uppercase) \u2192 counts of 1 each \u2192 No.\n\nEdge case 'ABCD' \u2192 counts=1 each \u2192 four, so the first entry with 1 will cause ok to be false. \n\nAll this seems correct.\n\nThus the Fortran code should work as needed."
