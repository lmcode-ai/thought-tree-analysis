Wait why is temp reinitialized? Wait in the first part, temp was used to build the maxxes array. Now they reset temp to 0 and start building temp again (like re-creating the numbers: 9,99, etc., each time building up in the loop again. So in the first loop for the array, temp is 0, then increases each step. The second loop again, starts from 0, builds the same numbers, but uses it to find if the midpoint (temp/2) is between L and R.\n\nThus, in the second loop in Fortran, the initialization would again set temp=0 (they have to reinitialize temp to 0). So in Fortran code, after the first loop for maxxes:\n\ntemp =0\n\nthen loop over i from 0 to9:\n\ntemp = temp *10_ INT64 + 9_INT64\n\nthen check if l <= (temp/2) .and. (temp/2) <= r:\n\nif that is so, then compute max with the maxxes(i) and current res:\n\nres = MAX(res, maxxes(i)) Thus, in Fortran:\n\nDO i=0,9\n    temp = temp * 10_INT64 + 9_INT64\n    IF ( (l <= (temp/2) ) .AND. ( (temp /2) <= r) ) THEN\n        res = MAX( res, maxxes(i) )\n    END",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me go through the code step by step and see how to convert each part. \n\nFirst, the problem seems to involve calculating some maximum product between numbers in certain ranges. The functions 'power' and 'mult' are key here, along with the main logic that processes input L and R to compute the result.\n\nLet me start with the 'power' function. The function counts the number of digits in a number. In Java, it's taking a Long and returning an int by dividing by 10 until it's 0. In Fortran, we can handle this by converting the number into a string and getting its length, but perhaps a loop-based approach is better here for strict translation. So in Fortran, the function would take a number (since it's Long in Java, which is 64-bit, but Fortran has different types; maybe using integer*8 for 64-bit integers?), and iteratively divide by 10. Wait, but in Fortran, integers have different definitions. Maybe use integer(8) (if supported) for 64-bit. Let me think.\n\nWait, Fortran has fixed type sizes. The intrinsic function for that is 'digits', but in some cases, we might need an alternative. Hmm, but maybe better to stick with the loop method here. So, the function power would be a function that takes an integer argument, probably a long (so in Fortran, perhaps an integer(8)), and returns an integer. Let me structure that.\n\nNext is the 'mult' function. This function calculates a value based on the power of the number and does some multiplications. The variables here are max which builds a number with all 9's of length pow, then calculates a * (max - a). So translating that, again making sure of the variable types.\n\nNow the main program. The Java code reads two longs (L and R), initializes some arrays and loops. The maxxes array in Java is of size 10, storing some computed values. \n\nFirst, let me note variables:\n- In Java, mult is called with l and r, but in the code, the mult function takes a Long, so passing l and r as parameters. Wait in the mult function definition, the argument is 'Long a'. But in Java, when you call mult(l), which l is a long primitive, but the method expects a Long object. Does that cast correctly? Wait, in Java, autoboxing would handle that. So when passing a long (primitive) to a Long parameter, it auto-boxes. So in Fortran, probably, just use integers correctly.\n\nFortran's syntax is somewhat different, so I need to structure the code accordingly. Let's think about steps:\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nJava code reads two numbers: l and r via scanner. In Fortran, we'll read them using read(*,*) in the main program.\n\nThe array 'maxxes' in Java is an array of 10 elements of long. In Fortran, declared as a dimension(10) of integer(8), probably.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nStarting with the 'power' function. Let's write a function in Fortran:\n\nFUNCTION power(a) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a\n  INTEGER :: res\n  res = 0\n  DO WHILE (a > 0)\n    res = res +1\n    a = a / 10\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION power\n\nWait, but in Fortran, integers can't be modified in a function if they are passed as INTENT(IN). Wait, right! So in the function, the variable 'a' is an input-only. So perhaps to avoid modifying the original variable, we need to create a working variable inside. Let's see.\n\nWait the original code in Java: inside power, a is modified. Since in Java function parameters are pass-by-value, so the original variable isn't modified. So, in the Java function, the initial a is copied into the local parameter. Hence, in Fortran function, since if we have to modify a, even though it's a parameter, we need to make a local copy.\n\nTherefore, the function would better be written as:\n\nFUNCTION power(a) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a\n  INTEGER :: res, num\n  num = a\n  res = 0\n  DO WHILE (num > 0)\n    res = res + 1\n    num = num / 10\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION power\n\nThat should avoid modifying the original a because we make a copy in 'num'.\n\nSimilarly for the 'mult' function.\n\nFUNCTION mult(a) RESULT(result)\n  INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a\n  INTEGER(8) :: result, max, pow, j\n  pow = power(a)\n  max = 0\n  DO j = 1, pow ! Wait, original Java is for j from 0 to pow-1, maybe?\n  Wait, looking at the Java mult function:\n\n  int pow = power(a);\n  long max =0;\n  for (int j =0; j < pow; j++) {\n    max = max *10 +9;\n  }\n\nSo the loop runs 'pow' times. For the first iteration (j=0), it adds 9? Because when starting with 0:\n\nFirst, max starts at 0. \n\nAfter first run, j=0:\n\nmax = 0 *10 +9 =9. Then j increments to 1, and so on.\n\nWait, if the initial loop runs from 0 to pow-1 (since j < pow), that's pow iterations. So the loop is from 1 to pow (if 1-based) to do the same. So: in Fortran, in a DO loop, the steps would be from 1 to pow since for each iteration, adding a digit to max. The key is the number of iterations.\n\nAlternatively, starting j from 1 to pow.\n\nWait, let's see: for the first loop:\n\nmax = max *10 +9: So every time you loop, you add a 9. So for j in 0 to pow-1, you end up with pow digits. So in Fortran, the loop would run pow times, starting from 1 to pow, and the same formula.\n\nWait, the max starts at 0. So first step, max becomes 0 * 10 +9 =9.\n\nSecond step: 9*10 +9 =99. etc. So after pow iterations, it's a number made of pow 9s.\n\nYes, so in the code, the loop in Fortran can be:\n\nmax =0\n\nDO j = 1, pow\n\n   max = max *10_8 + 9_8 \n\nWait, but need to ensure using integer(8). \n\nYes. So 'max' is initialized as 0. \n\nThen, the mult function returns a * (max -a). So the result is a * (max -a). \n\nThe mult function's parameters and return type are 8-byte integers (or Fortran's kind 8). \n\nNow the next part is the main program.\n\nFirst, reading L and R:\n\nIn main:\n\nImplicit none\n\nRead L and R as integers*8 (which in Fortran is integer(8) )\n\nThen, res is initialized as 0 (long in Fortran 0 is integer(8)), but in code before the loop, res is initialized as 0, so need to set that to 0.\n\nThen, the maxxes array. In the Java code, it's length 10, but Fortran arrays are 1-based by default unless specified with 'dimension(...)'.\n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for(int i=0; i < 10; ++i). So in Java, the indices are 0-based. So the array size is 0-9 (10 elements).\n\nSo in Fortran, when declaring the array, needs to be of size 10, but starting from 0 to 9? Or since it's 1-based, up to 10? Wait in Fortran, by default, arrays are 1-based. So the array declaration would be of size 10 (so indices 1-10). But in the loop, the Java loop runs from i=0 to 9, which would go up to the ninth element of a zero-based array, which causes confusion here.\n\nWait, let me see how the Java code works for maxxes.\n\nInitialize temp=0, then for each i from 0 to 9:\n\ntemp = temp *10 +9\n\nmaxxes[i] = temp /2 * ( temp - temp /2 )\n\nSo, for each iteration, temp becomes 9, 99, 999, etc. up to 9999999999 (10 digits). Each step represents a 1, 2, ...,10-digit maximum number (all 9s).\n\nThe maxxes array stores for each i, the product of (temp/2) * (temp - temp/2). So for each possible power (number of digits is i+1?), perhaps?\n\nWait for each i from 0 to 9: the loop runs 10 times. \n\nThe first iteration (i=0):\n\ntemp =0 +9 =9.\n\nmaxxes[0] = (9/2) * (9 - 9/2 ). Since integer division applies in Java, 9/2 is 4?\n\nWait yes in Java integer division: 9/2=4, so 4*(9-4)=4*5=20.\n\nSecond loop i=1: temp becomes 99. So 99//2 = 49, 49*(99-49)=49 *50=2450, which is stored in maxxes[1].\n\nFinally, the array has elements up to i=9, so the last element is for 10-digit 9999999999.\n\nSo when translating to Fortran's array, which is 1-based, maybe we declare it as dimension(0:9) (specifiyng explicit bounds). Or perhaps using an array with 1-based indices, but the loop would offset i in the code.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nDIMENSION maxxes(0:9)\n. . .\nDO i=0,9\n  (proceed...)\n END DO\n\nAlternatively, declare it as (1:10) and then loop from 1 to10, but that would require adjusting the indices, but it's perhaps better to stick with the same indices as in Java to avoid confusion.\n\nWait Fortran allows array declarations with explicit lower bound:\n\nvariable(0:9) ... so specifying that.\n\nTherefore, in the main program:\n\nINTEGER(8), DIMENSION(0:9) :: maxxes\nINTEGER(8) :: temp\ntemp=0\nDO i=0,9\n   temp = temp*10_8 + 9_8  ! 10_8 ensures constant is 8 bytes? Wait, in Fortran, the underscore with kind.\n\nWait constants like 10 and 9, in declarations, perhaps need to explicitly cast as integer(8).\n\nWait in Fortran, integers are default kind, unless specified. So using 10_8 (or 10_KIND) where Kind is set, perhaps. Alternatively, use *1 (8-byte integers).\n\nWait, perhaps first set a parameter for the kind.\n\nLet me first set a kind parameter for 8-byte integers. \n\nAt the top:\n\nINTEGER, PARAMETER :: INT64 = SELECTED_INT_KIND(18)  ! 64-bit integers need at least 18 digits (since 2^63 is about 9e18)\n\nThen use integer(INT64) for variables.\n\nSo:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_86_A\n  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: INT64 = SELECTED_INT_KIND(18)\n  INTEGER(INT64) :: l, r, res, temp, max\n  INTEGER(INT64), DIMENSION(0:9) :: maxxes\n  INTEGER :: i, j, pow\n  ...\n\nNow the part after reading L and R:\n\nres is initialized to 0.\n\nThen, compute maxxes array:\n\ntemp is initialized to 0 (since in Java code)\n\nloop i from 0 to9:\n\ntemp = temp*10 +9\n\nmaxxes(i) = (temp/2) * (temp - temp/2 )\n\nBut in Fortran division of integers is integer divide already. So (temp/2) is integer division. So the code would be:\n\nmaxxes(i) = (temp / 2 ) * ( temp - temp/2 )\n\nWait need to compute this.\n\nThen, after building the maxxes array:\n\nNow in Java, after that loop, the code updates 'res' to the maximum between mult(l) and the current res (initially zero).\n\nres = Math.max(mult(l), res);\n\nSimilarly with mult(r).\n\nThen, the next loop for the i in 0-9:\n\ntemp is reset to 0? Wait the Java code says \"temp =0\" before this loop.\n\nWait let's go back to the Java code:\n\nThe Java main:\n\nAfter computing maxxes array:\n\nres = Math.max(mult(l), res);\n\nres = Math.max(mult(r), res);\n\nThen \"temp = 0;\"\n\nfor (int i=0; i <10; ++i) {\n    temp = temp*10 +9;\n    if (l <= temp/2 && temp/2 <=r) {\n       res = Math.max(maxxes[i], res);\n    }\n}\n\nAh okay: temp starts at 0, then in each step it builds up. Wait why is temp reinitialized?\n\nWait in the first part, temp was used to build the maxxes array. Now they reset temp to 0 and start building temp again (like re-creating the numbers: 9,99, etc., each time building up in the loop again.\n\nSo in the first loop for the array, temp is 0, then increases each step. The second loop again, starts from 0, builds the same numbers, but uses it to find if the midpoint (temp/2) is between L and R.\n\nThus, in the second loop in Fortran, the initialization would again set temp=0 (they have to reinitialize temp to 0).\n\nSo in Fortran code, after the first loop for maxxes:\n\ntemp =0\n\nthen loop over i from 0 to9:\n\ntemp = temp *10_ INT64 + 9_INT64\n\nthen check if l <= (temp/2) .and. (temp/2) <= r:\n\nif that is so, then compute max with the maxxes(i) and current res:\n\nres = MAX(res, maxxes(i))\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nDO i=0,9\n    temp = temp * 10_INT64 + 9_INT64\n    IF ( (l <= (temp/2) ) .AND. ( (temp /2) <= r) ) THEN\n        res = MAX( res, maxxes(i) )\n    END IF\nEND DO\n\nFinally, output res.\n\nBut in Fortran, the output is done via a write statement.\n\nprint *, res\n\nWait, but need to ensure that 'res' is of integer(8), so the write statement must handle that.\n\nPutting all together, the full program:\n\nincluding the functions.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions are either internal, or external, but since versions before F90 had different conventions, but let's use F90 standard.\n\nStructure:\n\nFirst, program defines the functions, then the main.\n\nBut in Fortran, subroutines and functions must be declared before the program if in the same file. Alternatively, putting them before the main program in the code.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram codeforces_86_A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer, parameter :: INT64 = selected_int_kind(18)\n  \n  interface\n    integer function power(a)\n      integer(INT64), intent(in) :: a\n    end function power\n    integer(INT64) function mult(a)\n       integer(INT64), intent(in) :: a\n    end function mult\n  end interface\n\n  integer(INT64) :: l, r, res, temp, i, pow\n  integer(INT64), dimension(0:9) :: maxxes\n  character :: newline = achar(10)\n\n  l = 0\n  r =0\n  read(*,*) l, r\n  res = 0_INT64\n\n  temp =0_INT64\n  do i = 0,9\n     temp = temp *10_INT64 + 9_INT64\n     maxxes(i) = (temp/2) * (temp - temp/2)\n  end do\n\n  res = max( res, mult(l) )\n  res = max( res, mult(r) )\n\n  temp = 0_INT64\n  do i =0,9\n     temp = temp*10_INT64 +9_INT64\n     if ( (l <= temp/2 ) .and.

Wait no, the 'mult' function uses 'i' which is a variable declared in the outer scope (the main program)?\n\nWait that's a problem. The variables in the main program are not accessible in the 'mult' function.\n\nAh right. So the loop in 'mult' function uses a variable i, which should be local to that function. Because in the main program, the 'i' variable is used in loops, but in the mult function, using 'i' would refer to the main program's i, which is incorrect. To avoid variable collision, in Fortran, the loop variables in the function need to be declared or use a different name.\n\nYes, that would cause an error. So in the mult function, the loop should use, say, 'j' instead. Let me correct that.\n\nIn the mult function's code:\n\ninteger(INT64) function mult(a)\n  integer(INT64), intent(in) :: a\n  integer :: pow, j\n  integer(INT64) :: max_val\n  pow = power(a)\n  max_val =0_INT64\n  do j =1, pow  ! changing the loop variable to j\n     max_val = max_val *10_INT64 +9_INT64\n  end do\n  mult = a * (max_val -a)\nend function mult\n\nYes. That way, the variable 'j' is local to the DO loop.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, the function result is set by assigning the function name to the return value. So in the 'power' function, the last line is 'power = res'.\n\nTesting for the loop in the power function: since 'num' is an integer(8), dividing by 10 would do integer division, which is correct.\n\nNow checking the main program's array maxxes. The first loop:\n\nWhen i runs from 0 to9: each iteration builds temp (starting at 0) to 9, then 99, etc up to 9999999999.\n\nThen, the maxxes(i) is set as (temp/2)*(temp - temp/2). That's accurate.\n\nThen, after that, the res is initialized to 0, then takes max with mult(l) and mult(r). \n\nThen second loop with temp restarting to 0 again.\n\nYes.\n\nOther points:\n\n-the read in Fortran: read(*,*) l, r reads two numbers. \n\nIn Fortran, the variables can be declared with proper types and it should read correctly. \n\nNow the 'contains' section is needed to include internal functions. \n\nThis should be the translated code. Let me see potential issues.\n\nWait, in the main program's mult(a) function: the mult function is declared to take an integer(INT64). So when we call mult(l), l is an integer(INT64), so that's okay.\n\nAnother detail: in Fortran, \"max\" function. The intrinsic function MAX is for scalars, or array: but here, in the first use, like res = max( res, mult(l) ), so it's okay because MAX is used with two arguments, which is allowed.\n\nAnother thing: in some Fortran versions, the selected_int_kind(18) might not be 8. Wait, SELECTED_INT_KIND(r) returns the kind number for an integer that can hold at least 10^r. So for 18, it should be suitable for 64-bit, but perhaps we should just use integer(8). Alternatively, test. To make it more compatible, perhaps better to use KIND parameter. Hmm but maybe that's safer. Suppose that on some systems, the default integer might be 4 bytes, so using kind parameter is necessary.\n\nOverall, I think this code should be accurate. Let me write it out again with these corrections."
