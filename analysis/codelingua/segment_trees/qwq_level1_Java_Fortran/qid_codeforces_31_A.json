So in java, the print is using the j's last value (from the loop's condition) before breaking out. So in the code's structure, the variables k,i,j will be those that triggered the condition. Thus in FORTRAN, saving the variables lastk, lasti, lastj will have the correct values. Thus the output is lastk (k+1 in java), lastj (j+1), lasti (i+1) ? Wait no: FORTran's variables were stored in 1-based:\n\n                    yes, because FORTran's j starts at 1, which corresponds to the Java's j=0 \u2192 so stored lastj = 1 corresponds to j+1=1 in java's output. So the values are correct. So the print statement is to output lastk, lastj, lasti. But wait, in the code's structure above, in the FORTRAN code, when the condition is met during the j loop, we have:\n\n                    lastk=k, lasti=i, lastj=j.\n\n                    Thus, the print statement should output lastk, lastj, lasti \u2192? Wait let me see:\n\n                    in the java code example where java's (k=0, j=0, i=2 ) \u2192 then the output is 1,1,3 (since Java k=0 \u21921, j=0 \u21921, i=2 \u21923). In FORTRAN, the variables would be stored as lastk=1, lasti =3 (since in FORTRAN's i loop, that i is 3), lastj =1 (FORTRAN's j is that of the first iteration), so when you print in that order: lastk, lastj, lasti \u2192 which gives 1,1,3 \u2192 which is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does first.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n, then reads an array of n integers. It then checks if any element in the array is equal to the sum of any two other distinct elements. If such a triplet (k, i, j) exists where a[k] = a[i] + a[j], it outputs the indices+1 of those elements. If not, it outputs -1.\n\nHmm, translating this to Fortran. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, handling input. In Java, Scanner is used; in Fortran, we'll use READ statements. So for reading n and the array, I can use a loop to read n integers.\n\nThe variables in Fortran: n is an integer, the array a, which will be an integer array of size n. The flag f is an integer (0 or 1). Variables k, i, j, t are integers as well.\n\nThe main loops: the outer loop runs over each element k (from 0 to n-1 in Java). Wait, arrays in Fortran are 1-based by default, unless specified otherwise. So perhaps I should adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, let's note that in Java, arrays are 0-based, and the problem uses indices in the output as k+1, j+1, i+1. So when converting, perhaps Fortran's arrays can be 1-based. So in Fortran, the array a will be declared with size n, starting at index 1 to n.\n\nWait the loops in Java: for (k = 0; k < n; k++), so in Fortran k would loop from 1 to n? Or maybe adjust indices. Let me see.\n\nWait the loops in Java's code:\n\nThe outer loop is for k from 0 to n-1 (since k < n). For each element a[k], the code checks pairs (i,j), such that i and j are between 0 and n-1, and i != j. If a[i] + a[j] equals a[k], then it sets f to 1 and breaks out of loops.\n\nIn Fortran, variables are typically 1-based unless declared otherwise, so we might need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based arrays. So in Fortran:\n\nThe array is a(n). Each element from a(1) to a(n). The variable k loops from 1 to n (equivalent to Java's 0-based loop over n elements). Then, the inner loops i and j go over 1 to n.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n\nfor (j = 0; j < n - 1; j++)\n\nWait hold on, looking again. The j loop is written as for (j = 0; j < n - 1; j++), so that would loop n-1 times? Wait wait, perhaps that's an error. Wait, in the code, the line is:\n\nfor (j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) \n\nWait that would loop j from 0 up to n-2 (since stopping at j < n-1). Wait that's a bug! Wait but the Java code might have this, but maybe I should check. Because in the logic, perhaps there's an off-by-one error here?\n\nWait the j loop is from 0 to n-2, but the intention is to loop until j < n-1? Wait that would mean j goes up to n-1, but with j < n-1 as the condition. That's only up to n-2? Hmm, perhaps the original code has a mistake here, but as a translator, I have to stick to exactly what is given. So in Fortran, we have to translate the loops as given. So the j loop is up to n-1? Wait no: Let's check Java:\n\nThe code's inner loop for j is:\n\nfor (j = 0; j < n - 1; j++)\n\nWait n-1 is the upper bound, so j can go up to n-2? Because in Java, the loop runs while j is less than (n-1). So j max is n-2.\n\nHmm, that's an important detail. So maybe the code's logic is flawed because the j loop stops at n-2, thus not covering all possible pairs. But the user provided code may have that, so we just have to replicate it accurately.\n\nAlright, proceeding.\n\nVariables:\n\nIn Fortran, the variables would be declared. For example, integer :: n, a(n), etc. But since in Fortran arrays are static, we need to read n first, then allocate the array. This complicates things. Alternatively, the code can use an array with a size parameter, but since it's interactive, perhaps we can read n first, then read the array.\n\nWait in Fortran, if n is known first, but arrays have fixed size, so maybe we can use a dynamically allocatable array. For that, the Fortran would need:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nBut how to structure that.\n\nThe main steps:\n\nRead n via read(*,*) n\n\nAllocate a(1:n)\n\nThen read the array elements.\n\nThen proceed with loops.\n\nThe loops would then be in 1-based indices.\n\nWait let's go through the code.\n\nOriginal Java variables:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint f = 0; (flag)\n\nint[] a = new int[n]; (array of size n).\n\nThe loops:\n\nfor (k = 0; k < n; k++) { ... }\n\nSo in Fortran, k would go from 1 to n.\n\nInside, t = a[k], which is a( k ) in Fortran (since in Java it's a[k] where k is 0-based). Wait: Since in Java, k starts at 0, so the first element is a[0].\n\nBut in Fortran, we're using 1-based. So Java's a[k] (for k from 0 to n-1) would correspond to a(k+1) if we have a 1-based array. Wait no, maybe in the Fortran code I should just start at 1, so the first element of the array is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert all loops to 1-based in Fortran, which should mirror the code's logic when translated.\n\nWait the following variables:\n\nint k = 0, j =0, i=0; (initialized to zero in Java).\n\nIn Fortran, similarly initialized, but since loops are 1-based, variables can just be integers, but their initial values are 0 as in Java? No, Fortran variables need explicit initialization if they aren't allocated. Alternatively, they can be declared and set.\n\nWait in the code, k, i, j are declared at the same time as local variables (in main method). In Fortran, variables are declared at the top of the scope. Let me structure:\n\nProgram Codeforces31A\n\nRead n, then read array a.\n\nInitialize variables: f=0, k=0, j=0, i=0, and t.\n\nWait but in Fortran:\n\nvariables can be declared like:\n\ninteger :: n, f = 0, k, j, i, t\n\nBut I can set f = 0 initially.\n\nWait code logic:\n\nThe outer loop runs through each element a[k]. The code picks that element, and checks all pairs (i,j), where i and j are indices (excluding the same k?), or any i and j except each other?\n\nWait the code in Java says, for the current a[k], it wants to check if there exists i and j (any pair) such that i is not equal to j, and their sum equals a[k], but does it require i and j to also be different from k?\n\nWait the code in Java says:\n\nif (i != j && t == (a[i] + a[j])) \n\nWhere t is a[k] (the current element being checked). But in the loops for i and j, are they ranging over all possible indices, which includes possibly k? For example, the i can be the same as k, as long as there's some j not equal to i that sums to a[k].\n\nWait the variables i and j can even include k. Because the check is i != j, but the code doesn't exclude k. So in the code, if it's possible that a[k] is equal to a[k] + a[j] where j !=k, then that's possible but for that would require a[j] =0, etc. But the Java code doesn't restrict that. So the logic is any i and j, as long as they are different from each other, but could both include k. \n\nTherefore, in the code, for a given k, the loop finds any i and j (could include k or not) that sum to a[k].\n\nTherefore, the logic in Fortran should mirror this.\n\nNow, translating the loops.\n\nFirst in the Java code's k loop:\n\nfor (k=0; k < n; k++)\n\nIn Fortran, this is do k = 1, n (since arrays are 1-based? Wait, no. Because the original Java array's first element has index 0. Therefore if in Fortran we choose to use a(1) as first element, then the loop over k would start at 1, ending at n, with indices being 1-based. So that's the plan.\n\nWait no, let me see:\n\nWait suppose the Java array has indices 0..n-1, and in each iteration the k loops through all of these. Then in Fortran, variable k would loop from 1 to n, and a is stored in 1-based array. Thus, in each loop, t is assigned a(k) (since old a[k] in Java would be a(1 +k) ? Wait no, no. Wait Java's a[k] where k is the loop 0 to n-1 is the same as the k-th element. So in Fortran's array a(1 to n), the Java a[0] is a(1), and Java a[k] where k is up to n-1 would be Fortran a(k+1)? Wait no. Wait no, I think the equivalent would be that in Fortran, a(1) is equivalent to a[0], but that might complicate the translation.\n\nWait maybe it's better to use 1-based in Fortran arrays and 1-based indices for variables. Let me think: let's take n elements stored in a(1..n), then:\n\nThe outer loop is Do k = 1, n\n\nt = a(k)\n\nThen, the inner loops:\n\nOriginal Java loops:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < n; i++) loops i from 0 to n-1.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nIn Fortran, this would be i from 1 to n, since n now is n.\n\nWait but in the Java code:\n\ni loops from 0 to n-1 (since i <n). So in Fortran, to loop over same number of elements, the i loop is do i=1, n.\n\nSame for j: in Java, j loops from 0 to (n-1-1) = n-2? Wait yes, because in the innermost loop, the j loop is for (j =0; j <n-1; j++) \n\nSo j runs from 0 to n-2.\n\nWait this might be a mistake in original code. Let me check the code again. The inner j loop:\n\nfor (j=0; j <n-1; j++) \n\nSo in Java that is j runs up to when j < n-1 (as long as j is less than n-1). So the maximum j is (n-1-1)=n-2. \n\nWait that's an important point. That loop runs only from 0 to n-2. So that loop will never reach n-1. That's probably a bug in the original Java code. Because to check all j from 0 to n-1 (if possible) except for i?\n\nWait the inner loop is inside the i loop, and for each i, the j loop runs from 0 to n-2.\n\nHmm, this might be a bug, but since I need to translate the given code as-is, even if there's an error.\n\nSo in Fortran, for the j loop, that would translate to:\n\ndo j =1, n-1 (since j starts at 0 in Java which becomes 1 in Fortran? Wait wait, in this case, the Java's loop for j up to n-2 would correspond to j from 1 to n-1 (converted to 1-based), since 0 in Java becomes 1, so:\n\nOriginal Java j ranges from 0 to (n-2): which in terms of 1-based is 1 to (n-1). So the loop in Fortran would be do j =1, n-1.\n\nThe problem is this j loop might miss elements beyond that.\n\nBut the given code has that j loop condition, so proceed as per code.\n\nWait the problem is perhaps that in Java, the j loop runs only up to n-2, so for each k, the code checks only j indices up to n-2 (or in the original problem's terms, maybe not all combinations are checked). But this is the code given, so the translation must follow it.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nThe loops would be structured with variables from 1 to the required numbers.\n\nNow variables:\n\nOriginal code's variables are declared as int k =0 and so on. Since FORTRAN variables need to be declared with initial values or they have undefined values. We can initialize them to zero in the declaration.\n\nVariables needed:\n\ninteger :: n, a(n), f, k, i, j, t\n\nBut since a must be dynamic, need to allocate.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nprogram codeforces_31A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, f, k, i, j, t\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    ! Read the array\n    read(*,*) a\n\n    f = 0\n    k =0; i =0; j =0; ! Not sure if needed, but initialized to zero.\n\n    ! Outer loop over each k: in FORTRAN, from 1 to n\n    do k=1, n\n\n        t = a(k)\n\n        ! Now, loop over i:\n        do i=1, n\n\n            ! Loop over j from 1 to n-1 (since orig j loop is up to n-1-1?)\n\n            ! Wait no: in Java's loop, j runs up to n-1 (n-1 is not included?), wait:\n\n            In Java: the j loop is:\n\n            for (j =0; j <n-1; j++)\n\n            Which in terms of Fortran indices (converted 1-based):\n\n            j starts at 1 (since 0\u21921) and the upper limit is (j < (n-1) in Java? No, wait Java's loop is j < (n-1). So in Java:\n\n            j_max is n-2, so in 1-based terms, that would be j_Fortran = (Java j)+1 \u2192 1\u2192 (n-1)\n\n            So the upper limit for j in Fortran's loop is (n-1). So loop from 1 to n-1 inclusive.\n\n            So the loop:\n\n            do j =1, n-1\n\n            but this only goes up to n-1, which in 1-based is 1 to n-1 (so n-1 values). \n\n            Wait in original java's j loop, the maximum is n-2, so Fortran is 1-based \u2192 Java's j is max n-2 \u2192 1-based is (n-1). Which is correct.\n\n            So, in Fortran:\n\n            do j =1, n-1\n\n            but within the i and j loops.\n\n            Wait but the Java has the j loop nested within i's loop? Yes. So in the innermost loops:\n\n            for (i =0; ...i <n; then j loop:\n\n            for (j =0; ...j <n-1) \n\n            But in Fortran:\n\n            the code must have the loops as:\n\n            do i =1, n\n\n            do j = 1, n-1\n\n            ... \n\n            end do\n\n            So for each i, loop j from 1 to n-1, and check if i /= j, and sum equal to a[k]\n\n            Wait wait, but the original code's i and j loops: in Java, they check all pairs (i,j) where i ranges from 0 to n-1 (same as all elements), and j runs up to n-2. \n\n            However, the Fortran loops as outlined would have j going from 1 to n-1, which corresponds to the original j's 0 to n-2. So that's correct for the code's original logic.\n\n            Now, the condition in the Java is if (i != j ...), which in terms of Fortran's indices (1-based), the condition becomes (i /= j).\n\n            So the code would have:\n\n            if (i /= j .and. (a(i) +a(j) ) == t ) then\n\n                set f=1, break all loops, etc.\n\n            So the logic.\n\n            So putting this into code structure.\n\n            Now, the code loops:\n\n            For each k (from 1 ton) \n\n                t = a(k)\n\n                loop over i from1 ton:\n\n                loop over j from1 to n-1 (Java's original j's max is n-2 \u2192 Fortran's n-1)\n\n                if (i\u2260j and a(i)+a(j) == t), set flag f=1, break loops.\n\n            The code is structured with break statements in Java which exit the inner loops, then break further outer loops.\n\n            In Fortran, which doesn't have break like in C/Java, we need to use flags and control flow, or use loop exit constructs with GO TO or CYCLE/EXIT.\n\n            Alternatively, can exit loops once the condition is met.\n\n            So the code:\n\n            inside the i\u5faa\u73af:\n\n            do i=1, n\n\n              do j=1, n-1\n\n                if( (i /=j) .and. (a(i)+a(j) == t) ) then\n\n                  f =1\n\n                  exit \n\n                end if\n\n              end do\n\n            \uff0c but wait\uff0c here, the original Java breaks out all the inner loops.\n\n            Wait the Jave is:\n\n            inside the j loop:\n\n            if hit condition, then breaks (exit j loop), then break the i loop, then break outer loop.\n\n            That is, once any such pair is found, then f is set to 1, and the loops break so that it comes out of all loops.\n\n            So in the print statement, the variables k,j,i will be left at their last value.\n\n            Thus in Fortran, need a flag f to check when found.\n\n            So perhaps the loops would look like this:\n\n            Loop over k:\n\n            Set f=0 (maybe, but since outer loop is over each k?)\n\n            Wait in original code, f is set to 0 initially before any loops.\n\n            Because in Java's code:\n\n            f is initialized to 0 outside, then for each k's loop, we keep checking until find a triple.\n\n            Thus in Fortran:\n\n            initialize f=0 at start of program.\n\n            Then in each outer loop (k), after reset? No, because if f is set to 1, then the outer loop would break. Let me see the original code's structure.\n\n            Original code:\n\n            variables k,j,i are declared at the top.\n\n            Initially, f is set to 0.\n\n            The loops are:\n\n            for (k=0; k <n; k++) { \n\n                t = a[k]\n\n                for (i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n                    for (j=0; j <n-1 ; j++) { \n\n                        if (i !=j ... )\n\n                        if found, set f=1, break (j's loop)\n\n                    }\n\n                    if (f==1) break i loop\n\n                }\n\n                if (f==1) break k loop\n\n            }\n\n            So the loop structure in Java is that when inner loops hit the condition, they break out of the inner loops and exit the outer loops once any combination is found.\n\n            Thus the Fortran code should do the same.\n\n            To implement this, in Fortran's loops:\n\n            After setting t = a(k), then:\n\n            the code must have flags for the breaks.\n\n            How to do that. Maybe using an internal loop structure with flags.\n\n            Alternatively, use a loop that exits early when conditions are met.\n\n            One approach:\n\n            inside the k loop:\n\n            Set a temporary flag found_in_i as false or reset.\n\n            Then loops over i and j, and check conditions.\n\n            But perhaps the code can be written with DO loops with CYCLE and EXIT statements.\n\n            Let me try:\n\n            The outer k loop:\n\n            do k =1, n\n\n                t = a(k)\n\n                ! initialization flags before i loops:\n\n                flag_ij = 0\n\n                do i=1, n\n\n                    ! restart j's loop each i?\n\n                    do j=1, n-1\n\n                        if (i==j) cycle   ! skip if equal \n\n                        if (a(i)+a(j) == t ) then\n\n                           flag_ij =1 \n\n                           exit  ! exit inner j loop\n\n                        end if\n\n                    end do\n\n                    ! after j loop:\n\n                    if (flag_ij == 1 ) then\n\n                        f=1   ! found so set global flag\n\n                        exit i loop\n\n                    end if\n\n                    if (flag_ij ==1 ) then exit i loop \n\n                end do i loop\n\n                if ( flag_ij ==1 ) exit k loop \n\n            end do\n\n            This is getting complicated. The variable flag_ij is temporary for this k.\n\n            Wait perhaps nest the loops and use flags.\n\n            Let me see in Fortran:\n\n            in the k loop:\n\n            t = a(k)\n\n            inner_i: do i =1, n\n\n                inner_j: do j=1, n-1\n\n                    if( j .eq. i ) cycle inner_j \n\n                     if (a(i)+a(j) == t) then\n\n                        f = 1 \n\n                        ! save the parameters i,j and current k, then exit all loops\n\n                        ! but have to capture these values and not lose them\n\n                        ! since when exit the loops, the variables i,j,k can still be kept?\n\n                        !

After loops:\n\n                if (f ==1 ) then \n\n                    ! output: note that in java the output is k+1 etc, but in our variables, the indices are 1-based so it's lastk, lasti, lastj.\n\n                    ! But in Java code's output is System.out.println(k + 1 + \" \" + (j + 1) + \" \" + (i + 1));\n\n                    ! Wait in the Java code:\n\n                    The variables at the end:\n\n                    the final variables are k, j,i from the loop's state.\n\n                    For example, when the inner loop breaks out, the variables k, j,i would have the values at the iteration when the condition was met.\n\n                    But in the for loop, in the triple nested loops, after finding, the code breaks from the inner loops and also returns to the outer loop's variables.\n\n                    So in Fortran's variables, after exiting the j, i loops and k loop, we need to record their value.\n\n                    So storing in lastk, lasti, lastj would be appropriate.\n\n                    So the output is:\n\n                    write(*,*)lastk, lastj, lasti  ?\n\n                    Wait wait Java's output is \"k+1 \" + \"j+1 \" + \"i+1\".\n\n                    Wait the variables are:\n\n                    In the Java code, after breaking out of the loops, the print statement uses:\n\n                    k, (j+1), (i+1) ?\n\n                    Wait let me check:\n\n                    In Java's code:\n\n                    After finding, the print is:\n\n                    System.out.println(k + 1 + \" \" + (j +1) + \" \" + (i +1));\n\n                    Because in Java:\n\n                    The loop variables are 0-based. For example, initially when the condition is found, k is the current outer loop index (0-based), i and j are 0-based.\n\n                    Hence the output adds 1 to each to get 1-based indices.\n\n                    So in our code here, with FORTRAN being 1-based, the indices stored in lastk, lasti, lastj are already 1-based, so the printed values should be in the same value.\n\n                    Wait no. Let me re-express:\n\n                    Let me see:\n\n                    In Java's code, when the condition is met, the variables are k (0-based), j (0-based), i (0-based). So adding 1 makes the indices.\n\n                    So in FORTRAN, since the indices are stored as 1-based, the values lastk, lasti, lastj are already the correct 1-based indices, so the output should be those numbers.\n\n                    Thus printing:\n\n                    write(*,*) lastk, lastj, lasti \n\n                    Or is the order preserved as per Java? Let's check.\n\n                    In the Java code's print statement: it is:\n\n                    (k +1) (j+1) (i+1)\n\n                    The order is k's 1-based, j+1, and i+1.\n\n                    Wait in FORTRAN variables:\n\n                    lastk is the correct 1-based index of the outer loop.\n\n                    lasti is the 1-based i.\n\n                    lastj is the 1-based j.\n\n                    So the print should be the same sequence.\n\n                    Thus:\n\n                    write(*,*) lastk, lastj, lasti \n\n                    Wait: no, let me see:\n\n                    For example, in Java:\n\n                    if the indices were (k=0, j=0, i=0), then the print is 1,1,1.\n\n                    In FORTRAN, those would be stored as (1,1,1) \u2192 so same.\n\n                    Hence, the order in print should be:\n\n                    lastk (k index: correct), then j (current j's value in FORTRAN, corresponds to the Java's j+1? No, no: since FORTRAN i and j are stored as 1-based, so the stored values are already the correct 1-based indices. So the output is simply the lastk, lastj, lasti.\n\n                    Wait in FORTRAN variables:\n\n                    Suppose, in the Java code, variables k (outer loop) , i and j (inner loops) had values 0, 2, 5 (0-based), then in 1-based:\n\n                    the values would be k+1=1, i+1=3, j+1=6 \u2192 output \"1 6 3\".\n\n                    But the stored in FORTRAN variables would be lastk=1, lasti=3, lastj=6 \u2192 so output 1,6,3 \u2192 same as in java.\n\n                    So storing the FORTran variables lastk, lasti (correct 1-based) and lastj (stored as 1-based), so when we write lastk, lastj (the second index), and lasti (third index), that would be equivalent to the java's k+1, j+1, i+1.\n\n                    Wait the Java's output is order k+1, (j+1), (i+1). The variables are the outer loop's k, and the inner loops' j and i, but in the java code's code:\n\n                    the outer loop is over k, then i loop, then j loop's variables.\n\n                    Wait when the code hits the condition:\n\n                    The for loops could stop, and the current i and j are from the inner loops. \n\n                    For example, in java:\n\n                    suppose the break happens during a certain j and outer i iteration.\n\n                    Then the i variable will be wherever it broke out to, and the j variable holds the last j before breaking.\n\n                    (Wait Java for loops: if you break out of the inner j loop, then proceed through other loops.\n\n                    So in java, the print is using the j's last value (from the loop's condition) before breaking out.\n\n                    So in the code's structure, the variables k,i,j will be those that triggered the condition.\n\n                    Thus in FORTRAN, saving the variables lastk, lasti, lastj will have the correct values.\n\n                    Thus the output is lastk (k+1 in java), lastj (j+1), lasti (i+1) ?\n\n                    Wait no: FORTran's variables were stored in 1-based:\n\n                    yes, because FORTran's j starts at 1, which corresponds to the Java's j=0 \u2192 so stored lastj = 1 corresponds to j+1=1 in java's output.\n\n                    So the values are correct. So the print statement is to output lastk, lastj, lasti.\n\n                    But wait, in the code's structure above, in the FORTRAN code, when the condition is met during the j loop, we have:\n\n                    lastk=k, lasti=i, lastj=j.\n\n                    Thus, the print statement should output lastk, lastj, lasti \u2192?\n\n                    Wait let me see:\n\n                    in the java code example where java's (k=0, j=0, i=2 ) \u2192 then the output is 1,1,3 (since Java k=0 \u21921, j=0 \u21921, i=2 \u21923).\n\n                    In FORTRAN, the variables would be stored as lastk=1, lasti =3 (since in FORTRAN's i loop, that i is 3), lastj =1 (FORTRAN's j is that of the first iteration), so when you print in that order: lastk, lastj, lasti \u2192 which gives 1,1,3 \u2192 which is correct.\n\n                    Oh! Oh right! The order in the print statement of the original Java is (k+1) followed by (j+1) then (i+1).\n\n                    So the sequence needs to be:\n\n                    k's value first, then j's value and then i's.\n\n                    So in FORTRAN, it's lastk, lastj, lasti.\n\n                    Yes. So the output should use:\n\n                    write(*, \"(3I4)\") lastk, lastj, lasti\n\n                    Alternatively, formatted as needed.\n\n                    The actual printing can be done with:\n\n                    if (f ==1 ) then \n\n                        write(*, \"(I0, A, I0, A, I0)\") lastk, ' ', lastj, ' ', lasti\n\n                        ! or \n\n                        print*, lastk, lastj, lasti \n\n                        ! since write with ',*' can also.\n\n                        write(*,*) lastk, lastj, lasti \n\n                    else \n\n                        print*,'-1'\n\n                    end if\n\n                    So putting it all into code:\n\n                    Now, considering all these steps:\n\n                    Also, in the code, the variables lastk, lasti, lastj are initially set to 0, but in the case when f is 1, will be overwritten.\n\n                    So now, compiling all the code:\n\n                    program codeforces_31A\n\n                    !

This is as per the original code.\n\n                    Also, in Fortran, variables declared in the program scope are initialized to zero, but to be safe, explicitly set them.\n\n                    Testing edge cases:\n\n                    What if n=1?\n\n                    The code might have loops but in the j loop's upper limit would be n-1 =0 \u2192 which causes an error in Fortran. \n\n                    So in such case, when n<2, then the j loop will have an upper bound of n-1 which is <1 \u2192 so maybe loop doesn't execute.\n\n                    Which may lead to undefined for the variables.\n\n                    However the original java code has:\n\n                    When n is 1, then the outer k loop runs from 0 to 0 (n=1). Then, in the i loop (0 to 0), so i=0.\n\n                    Then the j loop is for j < 0 \u2192 since n-1 is 0 \u2192 j <0 \u2192 so the loop doesn't run.\n\n                    hence the loops don't execute, and f remains 0.\n\n                    The code's Fortran would, with n=1:\n\n                    The j loop has j from 1 to 0 \u2192 which might cause the loop to not run. Since Fortran's loop start > end doesn't execute.\n\n                    So that's okay.\n\n                    Another issue is the j loop in Fortran is from 1 to n-1 \u2192 but in cases when n=0?\n\n                    Wait n is the input, so the program would crash if n=0, but maybe that's allowed by the problem.\n\n                    The problem's Constraints might have n>=1 ?\n\n                    So assuming the problem's input is proper.\n\n                    So the code should be okay.\n\n                    Also, in the print statement, we are outputting the indices in the order lastk, lastj, lasti, which corresponds to the java's k+1, j+1, i+1. So that's correct.\n\n                    Now, in the code above, in the Java's case, the j loop is up to j < n-1 in Java (indices up to n-2 ), which in Fortran's 1-based is up to n-1. So yes that's correct.\n\n                    Another possible error in the original java code is that the j loop may not cover pairing with the last element. Wait Java's j loop runs up to n-2 (inclusive). So, for example, if n is 3, the j loop runs from 0 to 1 \u2192 j can be 0 or 1, so stops before 2. Then, with i=2 (0-based, which is a[2] in java), j=1 (0-based), then the pair (i=2,j=1) would be okay, but j can't go to 2 (which is the 3rd element).\n\n                    Wait maybe the original Java code has a bug here, but the code has to be translated exactly.\n\n                    Therefore this code in FORTRAN would replicate the same logic.\n\n                    Thus the final Fortran code should be something like that."
