Now, putting the code together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram codeforces598A\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: q, x\ninteger(8) :: n, s, pow2x\n\nread(*,*) q\n\ndo while (q > 0)\n   q = q -1\n   read(*,*) n\n   x = int( log(dble(n))/log(2.0d0) ) x = x +1\n   pow2x = 2_8 ** x\n   s = (n*(n+1) / 2_8 ) + 2_8 - 2_8*pow2x\n   write(*,*) s\nend do\n\nend program codeforces598A Wait but let me check data types and operations. Wait, (n*(n+1)) for large n: if n is of kind=8, then multiplying two integers (n and n+1) of that kind will result in an 8-byte integer. Then divided by 2 (since 2_8 is an 8-byte integer). But in the division n*(n+1)/2, the question is whether the division is integer division.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads an integer q which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer n, then calculates some value s, and prints it. \n\nLooking at the inner loop, it's calculating x as the floor of log2(n) plus one. Then s is computed using a formula. Let me break down the steps:\n\nThe Java code starts with:\nx is (int)(Math.log(n)/Math.log(2)) +1;\n\nWait, Math.log is natural log, but dividing by log 2 gives log2(n). Then converting to int gives the exponent where 2^x <= n?\n\nWait, let me see: suppose n is 4, log2(4) is 2. 2+1 would be 3? Or wait, maybe I should think again. Let me see, n =5: log2(5) is approx 2.32 so divided by log 2 gives 2.32, then cast to int is 2, plus 1 makes x=3. \n\nWait, perhaps the x is the smallest integer such that 2^x > n? Because for n=5, 2^3 is 8 which is greater than 5. Since when the log2(n) is taken, truncating the decimal and adding 1 gives the next integer. Yeah, so x here is the exponent where 2^x is the first power of 2 exceeding n.\n\nSo x = floor(log2(n)) +1. \n\nThen, the formula for s:\n\ns = - (2^x) *1 + 2 + (n*(n+1)/2) - 2^x. Wait the formula is written as:\n\ns = -1 * 2^x + 2 + (n*(n+1)/2) - 2^x; \n\nWait combining the terms with 2^x, those would be -1*2^x minus another 2^x, so that's -2*2^x. Let me see:\n\nLet me re-express:\n\n-2^x + 2 + (n(n+1)/2) - 2^x \u2192 yeah, so combining the two terms with 2^x gives -2^x -2^x = -2*2^x. \n\nSo the formula is s = (n(n+1)/2) + 2 - 2*(2^x). \n\nHmm. So that's the formula to compute s. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the main structure. Fortran does not have classes; the main program would be a program block. \n\nWe need to read q, loop q times. For each iteration, read n, compute x, then s using the formula.\n\nNow, for the steps in Fortran:\n\n1. The x calculation: finding x as floor(log2(n)) +1. \n\nIn Fortran, log2 isn't as straightforward. The intrinsic function log is natural, so log2(n) = log(n)/log(2.0). But for very large n, maybe we can compute the floor via another method, but perhaps using log is okay. \n\nWait, since n is an integer. Maybe another way to compute x is via a loop? Like find the largest exponent of 2 before it. Wait no, probably for the purposes of code translation, using the same method as Java is okay. \n\nIn Java, Math.log(n) could be problematic for very large n? In the problem constraints, I don't know, but perhaps the code is correct.\n\nIn Fortran, we can compute the natural logarithm using log(), so log2 = log(n)/log(2.0).\n\nBut n is an integer, but in Fortran, it can be converted to double. The code would:\n\nx = int( (log(real(n))/log(2.0)) ) +1 \n\nWait, but wait in Java, they cast to int which would be floor in this case for positive numbers. For example, for n=5, the division would give log(5)/log(2) is about 2.3219..., so cast to int would be 2, then adding 1 gives 3. \n\nSo in Fortran, to calculate x as the integer part of log2(n), we can use the floor function. \n\nAlternatively, using real to compute:\n\nlog_n = log(real(n)) / log(2.0d0) \u2192 in double precision, then take its floor (like using the aint or int function? The int function in Fortran truncates towards zero. So for positive numbers, that's the floor. Wait yes, for positive numbers, so for 2.3219, int(2.3219) is 2. \n\nSo the equivalent would be x = int( (log(real(n)) / log(2._dp)) ) + 1. \n\nWait but note that if n is 0, log(0) would be a problem. But in the context of this code, n is read from input. Since in Java, the code can have input n where log2 of it is taken. But the problem constraints (if this is problem 598A from Codeforces) probably have n \u22651. So I think it's okay. \n\nNow, in Fortran, variables must be declared. So, let's see the variables in the Java code: q is an integer, n is integer, s is a long (so in Fortran, integer*8 or integer(8), but depending on the compiler, perhaps just a 64-bit integer. )\n\nWait, in Fortran we can use kind parameters. But maybe using integers with sufficient size. Or maybe s can fit in 64-bit. Let me think about the constraints.\n\nThe problem (if this is 598A) let's recall, what was the problem? Let me think. The problem 598A is titled \"Special Permutation\", maybe not exactly, but the code here calculates s as per the given formula. The 2^x terms can get big. For example, if n is up to say, 1e6, then x would be about 20, since 2^20 is about a million. So 2^20 is about a million. So even for n up to 1e18, log2 would be 60, so 2^60 is manageable in integers of 64-bit. \n\nWait the problem 598A's input constraints: Let me think, since I can't see the problem statement. Let me assume that n is up to say 1e18; the formula uses squares of n, so n*(n+1)/2 could be up to (1e18)^2 which is 1e36, but in Fortran, if variables are of type integer(8), which is 64 bits (up to 1e19?), but 1e36 would overflow. Wait wait a second, hold on.\n\nWait the formula in s is n*(n+1)/2 minus 2^(x+1), or wait let's see the original Java code's formula:\n\nThe original formula in the code is:\n\n-1 * Math.pow(2,x) +2 + (n*(n+1))/2 - Math.pow(2,x); \n\nWait so the terms:\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n-2^x +2 + [n(n+1)/2] - 2^x \u2192 that's the same as [n(n+1)/2 + 2] - 2^(x+1)\n\nWait, yeah: because -2^x -2^x is -2^(x+1). \n\nWait, but this formula might result in very large numbers. For n being 1e18, n squared is way beyond 64-bit integer. \n\nWait but the problem: the code is written in Java which uses 64-bit integers (long), but in Fortran, if n is very big such as up to 1e18, then n*(n+1)/2 would be 0.5 * n^2 + something. \n\nWait, in codeforces' problem 598A, I think the constraints might be n up to 1e18. Let's see: assuming that, then n can be up to 1e18. But in Fortran, the default integer might be 4 bytes. So to handle larger numbers, need to use integer*8 (kind=8).\n\nSo the variables should probably be of kind 8. In newer Fortran (F90 and up), kind is used. So, let's decide to use integer(kind=8) for these variables except x, which can be a regular integer unless x can be up to like 60. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, we can check: let me note that x is floor(log2(n)) +1. For n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is approx 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). So x can be up to 60 or so, which fits in an integer.\n\nSo for the code variables:\n\n- q (number of test cases) can be integer.\n\n- n: integer(kind=8)\n\n- s: integer(kind=8)\n\n- x: integer\n\nTherefore:\n\nNow variable declarations would be:\n\ninteger :: q, x\n\ninteger(8) :: n, s\n\nNow the steps:\n\nRead q first, then loop q times.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nRead n (as 8-byte integer), then compute x.\n\nCompute x as:\n\nx = int( (log(real(n))/log(2.0_8)) ) + 1 \n\nWait in Fortran, need to cast n to real because log only takes real arguments. Let's see. The function log takes a real or complex argument. So:\n\nreal(n) converts integer(8) n to default real (if not specified). But maybe better to use double precision for better accuracy.\n\nWait, to use double precision, better because log2(n) might not be exact in single precision.\n\nWait I need to make sure that when calculating log2(n), it's precise enough. Because if the log is slightly less than the true value, then floor might decrease x by 1. Which could cause an error.\n\nHmm, perhaps in Java the original code uses log and then cast to int, so it's the same as taking the floor. But since the problem constraints might have stricter conditions, perhaps we have to use enough precision. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, better to use double precision logarithms. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nlog_n = log(dble(n)) / log(2.0d0)\n\nthen x = int( log_n ) +1 \n\nWait yes:\n\nFirst, converting integer n into double (via dble(n)), taking log over that. Divide by log(2.0d0), gives log2(n).\n\nThe int() function will then take the integer part (floor, for positive numbers).\n\nSo the correct way:\n\nlog_n = log(dble(n)) / log(2.0d0)\n\nx = int( log_n ) +1 \n\nThen, compute s.\n\nThe formula for s in Java:\n\ns = -1 * (long) Math.pow(2, x) + 2 + \n    ( (long)n * (n+1)/2 ) \n     - (long) Math.pow(2,x);\n\nWait, let me re-express this:\n\ns = (n*(n+1)/2 ) \n    + 2\n    -1 * 2^x \n    - 2^x \nSo,\n= (n(n+1)/2 + 2) - (2^x + 2^x)\n= (n(n+1)/2 +2 ) - 2*2^x \nYes. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the formula can be coded as:\n\ns = (n*(n+1)/2) + 2 - 2_i8 * (2_i8 ** x )\n\nWait, but 2^x in Fortran: exponentiation is ** operator. So 2**x. \n\nWait but in Fortran, since x can be up to 60, 2^60 is about 1e18, so 2_i8**x would be needed so that it's large enough. \n\nWait n is an integer*8, so 2**x must also be stored as integer(8). But since x can be up to say 60 (for n up to 1e18), 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is 2^60. That's less than 2^63, so it can be stored in an 8-byte integer. So okay.\n\nThus, the formula in Fortran:\n\ns = (n*(n+1)/2_8) + 2_8 - 2_8 * (2_8 ** x )\n\nWait, let me make sure:\n\nThe terms need to be in integer(8):\n\nn*(n+1)/2: \n\nIn Fortran, integer division is with / for integers, but since these are integers, we want (n*(n+1)) divided by 2. To ensure that the multiplication is done in integer(8) space, yes.\n\nWait, for n as an integer(8), n*(n+1) is an integer(8), then divide by 2 (integer division). Or maybe to avoid overflow, perhaps? Well, using 8-byte integers, n can be up to ~1e18, n squared is up to ~1e36, which 8 bytes can't handle. Wait wait a second, hold on, 8 bytes can hold up to 2^63-1. For n up to 1e18, n^2 is ~1e36, which is way bigger than 2^63 (which is about 9e18). So, n*(n+1)/2 would exceed the maximum value of an 8-byte integer when n is over ~3e9 (since (3e9)^2 is 9e18). Wait, 3e9 squared is 9e18 which is about 2^63 (which is about 9e18). So for n up to 1e18, it would require a 128-bit integer. \n\nHmm. Now that's a problem. The Java code's approach uses a long, which is 64 bits. 2^63 is about 9e18. Thus, if n is larger than 2^31 (since n squared would be up to 1e12 which is okay?), but for n up to 1e9, n^2 is 1e18 which can fit into a 64-bit integer only if it's exactly \u2264 9e18. \n\nWait let me check the actual formula again. Wait, the code's formula requires n*(n+1)/2 for very large n? So the code is incorrect for n >= sqrt(2^(64)), or perhaps the problem constraints are actually that n is small enough that this product doesn't overflow in a 64 bit variable. \n\nMaybe the problem has n up to, say, 1e5. Let me assume that the problem allows this code. Let me check the problem codeforces 598A.\n\nWait, the user hasn't specified the problem, but given this Java code, perhaps the problem has constraints where n is small enough so that 2^x is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem uses a different approach which allows the code to work within 32 bits, but I'm not sure. \n\nBut since I'm translating the code as is into Fortran, I have to make sure that variables have the right size.\n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, n is up to say 1e5, so n^2 is 1e10, which is okay in an 8-byte integer (since 8-byte can go up to ~1e18). So that's acceptable. \n\nSo, to compute the terms correctly, in Fortran:\n\nWe can do n*(n+1) first as an 8-byte integer, then divide by 2. So n*(n+1)/2 is okay as long as n^2 doesn't exceed 2^63 (since it is divided by 2, so approximately n must be less than ~sqrt(2^63)). For n up to 2e9, that's okay. But maybe in the problem the actual constraints are n up to some limit. But given that the code is using long in Java, perhaps we can just proceed with integer*8.\n\nNow, back to writing the code:\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces598A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: q, x\ninteger(8) :: n, s\ninteger(8) :: two_power_x\n\nread *, q\n\ndo while (q > 0)\n   q = q -1\n   read *, n\n   x = int( log(dble(n)) / log(2.0d0) )\n   x = x + 1\n   two_power_x = 2_8 ** x  ! Or calculate as 2**x as an integer*8?\n   s = (n*(n+1)/2_8) + 2_8\n   s = s - 2_8 * two_power_x\n   print *, s\nend do\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the formula, the formula is s = (n*(n+1)/2) + 2 - 2 * 2**x. Yes.\n\nWait, so that code should work. Let me test for small cases manually. \n\nLet me pick n=1. \nLet's see x:\n\nlog2(1) is 0, so x=0+1=1. 2^x is 2.\n\nThen compute s:\n\n(1*2)/2 =1, plus 2 \u2192 total 3. 3 minus (2 * 2)=4 \u2192 3-4 = -1?\n\nWait what does the original Java code do for n=1?\n\nRun through the Java code:\n\nn=1:\n\nx=(int)(log(1)/ln(2))). log1 is zero, so divided by any is zero. So x=0+1 \u21921.\n\nThen: \n\ns = - (2^1) + 2 + (1*2)/2 -2^1 \u2192 \n\n-2 +2 is 0, plus (1) (because 1*2/2 is 1) \u2192 1, then minus 2 gives total 1 -2 = -1. So outputs -1? \n\nWait, but let me compute again:\n\nJava's code:\n\ns = -1 * Math.pow(2,x) ... \n\nx=1: \n\n-1 * 2^1 \u2192-2\n\nThen +2 \u2192 +2 so total so far is 0.\n\nThen add (n*(n+1)/2 \u2192 this is (1*2)/2 =1. So 0 +1 \u2192 1\n\nThen subtract Math.pow(2,x) \u2192 2 \u2192 1 -2 \u2192 -1. \n\nYes. So s would be -1. \n\nBut what is the correct answer for n=1?\n\nThe problem's intention may be different, but the Java code may be correct. \n\nTesting Fortran code:\n\nFor n=1,\n\nlog(1) is 0 \u2192 x=0+1=1. \n\ntwo_power_x is 2^1 =2. \n\ns = (1*2/2) +2 \u2192 (1) +2 =3 \n\nthen minus 2*2 \u2192 3-4 = -1. Same as Java. So correct.\n\nAnother test case, let's take n=2. \n\nJava code:\n\nx is (log2(2)=1 \u2192 floored is 1 \u2192 x becomes 1+1=2?\n\nWait wait:\n\nWait, for n=2: log2(n) is exactly 1. \n\nx is (int)(1.0 / log 2 (divided by by itself? Wait the code's java code is:\n\nx=(int)(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2)), which when n=2, log(2)/log(2)=1.0 \u2192 cast to int is 1. So x increments by 1, so x=2.\n\nThus, 2^x is 4.\n\nThen s = -4 +2 + (2*3)/2 -4 \u2192 \n\n-4+2= -2; (2*3)/2 =3 \u2192 -2 +3 \u21921. Then minus4 \u2192 total 1-4 = -3. \n\nOriginal formula:\n\nn=2, the formula would be:\n\n(n(n+1)/2 +2) -2*2^x \u2192 (2*3/2 +2) \u2192 (3 +2)=5 - 2*4=8 \u21925-8=-3. So s=-3.\n\nHmm, so the Java code outputs -3. \n\nNow with the Fortran code: \n\nFor n=2, log2(2)=1 \u2192 gives x=1 (from the log division) \u2192 so x+1 is 2. \n\nso same value. \n\nThus code should work correctly.\n\nNow, coding in Fortran.\n\nWait in the code above, the first x calculation:\n\nx = int( (log(dble(n)) / log(2.0d0) ) ). Let's see:\n\nThe function log here is taking the natural log in both cases, so log(dble(n)) is ln(n), divided by log(2.0d0) which is ln(2). \n\nThat's correct. \n\nWait yes, log2(n) = ln(n)/ln(2). \n\nThus, the code calculates x properly. \n\nNow another thing: the line:\n\ntwo_power_x = 2_8 ** x \n\n2 is being treated as int8? Of course, but exponent raised to x (which is an integer) gives an integer(8) result. \n\nAlternatively, can we compute 2**x directly without a variable?\n\nIn the formula:\n\ns = (n*(n+1)/2) + 2_8 - 2_8 * (2_8 ** x)\n\nBut perhaps using two_power_x is better to avoid recomputing 2^x again?\n\nSo yes, storing into a variable is better for efficiency and code clarity. \n\nNow, putting the code together:\n\nThe Fortran program would look like this:\n\nprogram codeforces598A\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: q, x\ninteger(8) :: n, s, pow2x\n\nread(*,*) q\n\ndo while (q > 0)\n   q = q -1\n   read(*,*) n\n   x = int( log(dble(n))/log(2.0d0) )\n   x = x +1\n   pow2x = 2_8 ** x\n   s = (n*(n+1) / 2_8 ) + 2_8 - 2_8*pow2x\n   write(*,*) s\nend do\n\nend program codeforces598A\n\nWait but let me check data types and operations.\n\nWait, (n*(n+1)) for large n: if n is of kind=8, then multiplying two integers (n and n+1) of that kind will result in an 8-byte integer. Then divided by 2 (since 2_8 is an 8-byte integer).\n\nBut in the division n*(n+1)/2, the question is whether the division is integer division. In Fortran, when you divide two integers, you get integer division (truncating). Since n and n+1 are consecutive, one is even, so their product is even, so division by 2 is exact. So okay.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, operator precedence may require parentheses. Let's see:\n\ns = n*(n+1) / 2_8 \n\nThis is parsed as (n*(n+1)) / 2_8, which is correct. \n\nThen adding 2_8: +2_8 \n\nThen subtract (2_8 * pow2x): \n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to make it clearer:\n\ns = (n*(n+1)/2_8) + 2_8 - (2_8 * pow2x)\n\nBut it's unnecessary because operator precedence isfine.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the formula again to make sure all terms are correctly accounted.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing with n=3:\n\nJava:\n\nlog2(3)= ~1.58 so floor(1.58)=1 \u2192 x=2. \n\nso 2^x=4. \n\ns = (3*4/2 +2 ) \u2013 2*4 \u2192 6+2 =8 \u2192 8 -8 =0. \n\nWait what?\n\nWait let's compute via Java code:\n\n Java code:\n\nx=2:\n\nMath.pow(2,x) is 4.\n\ns= -4 +2 (so -2) \n\n+ (3*4/2 \u21926)\n\nthen minus 4 (the second Math.pow(2,x)\n\nSo: -2+6 + is that? Wait the formula:\n\nJava code:\n\ns = - (2^x) +2 + (n*(n+1)/2) -2^x \n\nSo yes: \n\n-4 +2 \u2192 -2, plus 6 (the middle term) \u21924, then subtract the second 4 \u21924-4=0. \n\nThe formula is correct. \n\nNow in the Fortran code for n=3:\n\nsame calculation: \n\npow2x =4 \u2192 2*4=8 (the subtraction term: 8)\n\nthe first term is (3*4/2 ) \u21926, plus 2 \u21928 \u2192 8 -8 \u21920. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for this test.\n\nAnother test case, maybe n=5:\n\nx is log2(5)= ~2.32 \u2192 floored to 2, so x becomes 3.\n\nThus pow2x= 8 (2^3 is8). \n\nThus:\n\n(n=5) \u21925*6/2=15 \u2192 +2 \u219217 \u2192 minus 2*8 \u2192 16. 17-16=1. \n\nJava code would calculate similarly. \n\nTherefore the Fortran code works as intended.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. The use of kind=8. Need to ensure that the compiler recognizes 2_8 as an 8-byte integer. However, in some Fortran versions, the kind parameter for 64-bit integers may be different (like 4 or 8 may vary). \n\nAlternatively, to use selected_int_kind to define proper kind parameters. But for simplicity, it's possible that using 8 works in most cases. Alternatively, use \"integer(kind=8)\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to write using the _8 suffix as in 2_8, but if the compiler uses different kinds, it could be an issue. But given that the code is translated as such, I think that's acceptable.\n\nAnother possible adjustment is to use integer*8, but the kind=8 is more standard in modern Fortran.\n\nAnother possible issue: the log function's precision. Because for huge n, the division of the two logarithms might not be precise enough. But that's a problem existing in the original Java code as well. For example, if n is exactly a power of two. Let's say n=4.\n\nThen log2(n)=2 \u2192 so x becomes 3.\n\nSo x=2 gives 8 (2^3)? \n\nWait for n=4:\n\nx = log2(4) is exactly 2 \u2192 integer cast gives 2, x became 3. \n\nWait, then:\n\npow2x=8. \n\ns = (4*5/2 +2) \u2192 (20/2 is10; 10+2=12) \n\n minus 16 \u219212-16 =-4. \n\nWait, let's see with Java code:\n\n For n=4:\n\nx = (int)( Math.log(4)/ln(2) ) \u2192 which is (ln4/ln2=2 \u2192 cast as int is 2 \u2192 then x is 3. \n\nThen the formula gives:\n\n-8 +2 + (4*5/2 \u219210 \u2192 10 + (-8 (from previous terms: -8+2+10) \u21924. Then subtract 8 \u2192 4-8 =-4. So correct.\n\nHmm, seems that when n is exactly a power of two, the code's process increases x beyond the log2(n). \n\nWait yes, that's exactly the code's way. Because the code adds +1 to the floor of the log2(n). So x = floor(log2(n)) +1. \n\nThus, for n=4, x is 3.\n\n Thus, the code is correct. \n\nSo, code should work.\n\nFinal check for code formatting in Fortran:\n\nThe program uses '2000' standard. The read statements can be either formatless (with *, or maybe list-directed I/O which uses *). The loops: the original code uses a while (q-- >0), but in Fortran, it's coded with a do-while loop. Alternatively, a do loop where the q is decremented. \n\nWait the Do while (q>0) starts, and inside, q is decremented by 1. The same as in Java.\n\nYes.\n\nHence, this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code as per the above should be correct."
