Wait in the code: In Java, they set next as the last character each time, so for the first iteration (i=0 in Java's loop), next becomes the last character. Then, for i=1, check whether the first character equals next. That's correct. In Fortran, for the first string (i=1), next is set to its last character. Then for the next string (i=2), check if starts with next. So that logic needs to be preserved.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, first, I need to understand what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads N strings and checks two conditions: all strings must be unique, and each subsequent string must start with the last character of the previous one. Oh right, like a chain where each next word starts with the previous's end.\n\nNow translating that to Fortran. Let me think about the components:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: In Java, they use a Scanner. In Fortran, I can read from stdin using read(*,*) or similar. Since we have N numbers first, then N strings. Wait, wait, no\u2014looking at the Java code, N is read first, then each of the N strings. So first read N, then loop N times to read the strings.\n\n2. **Data Structures**: Java uses HashMaps here. The first HashMap 'map' stores the index and the string. But in Fortran, maybe use an array of strings? Since the index is just 0 to N-1, an array would work better. Similarly for 'past', which seems to track previously seen strings.\n\nWait, the 'past' in Java's code is checking if the current string has been seen before. Wait, in the code:\n\n- past contains the strings as values. Because past containsValue(map.get(i)), which checks if the current string is already in the past values.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can have a logical array or use an array of strings and check for duplicates each time.\n\n3. **Checking for duplicates**: Instead of a HashMap, since we only need to know if the string exists before, a simple check in an array each time. So for each new string, check if it's already present in the array up to that point.\n\nWait, in the loop, for each i, it checks if past contains the current string. Wait, 'past' is being built by adding the current string each iteration. So effectively, if any previous occurrence of the current string exists, it breaks and ans is false.\n\nAlternatively, since we're processing in order, perhaps we can just keep an array of all the strings and check if the current string is in the array up to index i-1.\n\nSo for Fortran arrays:\n\n- Use a character array to hold all the strings.\n\nFor checking a new string against existing entries, loops are needed. Since in Fortran, there's no built-in hash, linear search for duplicates.\n\n4. **String operations**: The Java code gets the first character of the current string and compares it to the previous string's last character. In Fortran, strings can be handled with substrings. The first character is substr(1:1), the last character is the length? Wait, in Fortran, intrinsic functions. For a string 'str', its length can be found via len_trim(str). So for the next variable, which holds the last character of the current string, that's substr(currentStr, len_trim(currentStr): len_trim(currentStr)).\n\nBut since Fortran is 1-based, maybe it's easier.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nFirst, read N, then read N strings into an array.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\n- logical ans = .true.\n\n- an array of strings, say, str_list(1:N)\n\nThen, create a loop to check for duplicates and the chain rule.\n\nProcessing the strings in order, for each i from 1 to N:\n\nCheck if str_list(i) is already present in the previous entries (before i).\n\nTo check duplication, for each string str_i:\n\nLoop through all previous strings (from 1 to i-1) and see if any matches.\n\nIf found, set ans to false and break loops.\n\nThen, check the chain: for each i starting from 2 (since i=1 has no previous), current string's first character must be equal to the previous last character.\n\nWait, the code in Java uses next to track the required starting character. Let's think:\n\nInitially, next is empty string. Then, for each iteration:\n\nIf i is not zero (0-based in Java), then check the first character of current string versus next (which is the last character from the previous string).\n\nSo in Fortran's 1-based indexing, the first element (i=1) doesn't need to check previous, only from i >=2.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nIn Java, they set next as the last character each time, so for the first iteration (i=0 in Java's loop), next becomes the last character. Then, for i=1, check whether the first character equals next. That's correct.\n\nIn Fortran, for the first string (i=1), next is set to its last character. Then for the next string (i=2), check if starts with next. So that logic needs to be preserved.\n\nSo variables:\n\nInitialize ans = .true.\n\nInitialize next as empty string, but in Fortran, empty string could be handled via initial assignment.\n\nWait, let's structure the loop:\n\nFor each i from 1 to N:\n\n1. Check if str_list(i) is already present in str_list(1) to str_list(i-1). If yes, set ans to false and exit.\n\n   But how to do this efficiently? Well, inside the loop, perhaps have another loop from 1 to i-1, compare each.\n\n   If any match, break and set ans.\n\nWait but this is O(N^2), but the problem's constraints aren't known, but for code, perhaps acceptable.\n\n2. Then, check the next character condition.\n\n   If i >=2, then the first character of current string must match the next stored from previous step.\n\n   The next variable is updated each time to be the last character of the current string.\n\nSo, to implement:\n\nInitialize next as empty.\n\nLoop over i from 1 to N step 1:\n\n   Check for duplicates in previous entries:\n\n      do j from 1 to i-1:\n\n          if str_list(i) == str_list(j), then ans = false, break loops.\n\n      end do\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n   Wait, but how to break out of the loop if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, after finding a duplicate, set an error flag and exit the rest of the loop.\n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nwithin the main loop, after processing each string:\n\n- check for duplicates by looping through existing entries before i. So check from 1 to i-1.\n\n   If found:\n\n      set ans to false, and exit to the end.\n\n   then, check next condition (chain):\n\n      if i >1:\n\n         if first character of current string is not equal to next, set ans to false and break.\n\n      then, update next to last character of current string.\n\nWait, the order is important: first check the chain condition only if the first condition is okay?\n\nSo steps:\n\nAt each iteration:\n\n   Check if the current string has been seen before (from 1 to i-1). If yes \u2192 ans false.\n\n   Also, check the chain: if it's not first, check first char equals next.\n\n   Update next to last char of current string.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, ans becomes false.\n\nNow coding in Fortran.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- N: integer.\n\n- strings array: character(len=?) [max possible length?]\n\nHmm, problem is the string input. Since in the Java code, the strings are taken from next() (so possibly variable lengths), in Fortran, the strings can be of varying lengths. The input strings should have enough length. Suppose we can set a maximum length as needed. Let's assume a size of 10 up to, say, 100? Like in many competitive coding problems. So for the strings array, maybe:\n\nparameter (max_len=10)\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_len = 10\n\ncharacter(len=max_len) :: str_list(1:N) \u2192 but N is variable.\n\nAh, but in Fortran, arrays must have fixed sizes. Since N is read, we can use an array that is allocated dynamically (modern f90).\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the problem's constraints on N are small, so maybe read N first, then allocate an array of N elements, each of length, say, up to 10 characters (as per contest problem ABC109 B's problem description maybe).\n\nLet me check the problem.\n\nWait, the problem... The code is for ABC109 B. Let me think, but perhaps the problem's input has words like 1<= N <= 1e5? Well, perhaps better to assume some fixed length sufficient for the problem. For this code, since in the Java code they're reading via next(), likely the expected strings are reasonable in length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read all strings as 1000 characters? But Fortran can handle that with some pain.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, one can just get each line as a string, using read(*, '(A)') dummy_str, then trim it to the necessary length.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the program reads N numbers, then reads N Strings via next().\n\nWait, wait no, in the Java code:\n\nThe first line is N = sc.nextInt()\n\nThen, for the next N times, sc.next().\n\nWait, if the input after N is N lines of strings, each as a word, then each word is obtained with next().\n\nTherefore in Fortran, to read each string until the end, can read each line with read(*, '(A100)') and trim the excess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nRealize that each input after N is a single word per line. So for each of N strings, we can read with:\n\n read(*, '(A)') str_list(i)\n\nThen, trim them, and process.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\nStart with:\n\nprogram atcoder\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, j, len_str\ncharacter(len=100), allocatable :: str_list(:)\ncharacter(len=1) :: next\nlogical :: ans = .true., duplicate\n\n! Read N:\nread(*,*) N\n\nallocate(str_list(N))\n\n! Read N strings:\ndo i=1, N\n    read(*, '(A)') str_list(i)\n    ! Remove any newlines or trailing spaces? Not sure, but if the problem expects each as a single token,\n    ! but using A format reads entire line? Hmm.\n\n    ! Trim leading/trailing spaces. The Java code uses next(), which is a token separated by whitespace.\n    ! So maybe in Fortran, we can read as a string and use adjustl to get rid of leading spaces. But maybe that's complicates.\n\nAlternatively, since Java's next() reads each token separated by whitespace, perhaps in Fortran, use a list directed read.\n\nWait perhaps better to read as follows:\n\nAt the point of reading each string:\n\nread(*,*) str_list(i)\n\nBut for list directed, the strings can be supplied per line. So for each N lines after the first number N, each line is one string.\n\nWait but in list-directed read, the input can be on a line by itself for each str_list(i).\n\nSo that might be okay.\n\nBut for strings with embedded spaces? The problem likely considers each string as part of the problem's input as a token without spaces. So proceeding.\n\nWait the Java code uses sc.next(), which reads tokens without spaces. So if the input lines have multiple words, all but the first would be misparsed. So in the input, each line after N is a single word, so the list-directed read in Fortran is okay.\n\nTherefore proceed with:\n\ndo i = 1,N\n\n   read(*,*) str_list(i)\n\nend do\n\nBut strings might have varying lengths. But in Fortran, str_list must be a fixed length character array. So, we can set the length to, say, 100.\n\nThus, the variable str_list is allocatable with length 100.\n\nSo the initial lines would be:\n\ninteger :: N\n\ncharacter(len=100), allocatable :: str_list(:)\n\nlogical :: ans = .true.\n\nThen, after reading the N strings, proceed.\n\nNow, processing:\n\nInitialize next as empty, maybe as a length=1 character.\n\nInitially, next is empty.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variable next can be a length 1 character, initialized as blank or whatever.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a variable, initializing it as ' ' but initially check if i is the first element.\n\nFirst step: Creating loop for i from 1 to N:\n\nFor each i, do these steps:\n\nCheck for duplicates:\n\nCheck in the array up to i-1 for current string (str_list(i)) being a duplicate.\n\nSet duplicate = .false.\n\ndo j =1, i-1\n\n   if (str_list(i) == str_list(j)) then\n\n       duplicate = .true.\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif (duplicate) then\n\n   ans = .false.\n\n   exit\n\nend if\n\nBut how to exit the outer loop in Fortran? Because we can't have a 'break' like in Java. We can exit the loop with a flag, and set ans to false then break.\n\nAlternatively, after setting ans to false, set a flag and check it after each iteration.\n\nAlternatively, turning this into a loop over N, and within each loop step, first check for duplicates:\n\nInside the main loop:\n\ni from 1 to N loop:\n\nFirst check for duplicate:\n\n- for existing strings 1 to i-1, check against current. If found, set ans to false and goto the end.\n\n   So after this inner loop, maybe:\n\n   if (duplicate) then\n\n      ans = .false.\n\n      exit the loop\n\n   end if\n\nThen, check the chain condition:\n\nif i>1:\n\n   first_char = str_list(i)(1:1) ? but str_list has length 100, so must look for first character. However, if length is less than that? Well, comparing trim(str_list(i))? No, perhaps the strings can have leading or trailing spaces?\n\nHmm, wait, the Java code processes the strings as per Scanners. So trimming isn't required here? The input strings are exactly the tokens given, so in Fortran, when reading with list-directed, leading/trailing spaces are ignored, so maybe the read does that. So the actual string stored as str_list is without leading/trailing spaces, varying content.\n\nThe comparison between two strings in the array would be comparing the actual characters as read, so that's okay.\n\nBut to get first character of current string, since it's stored as a character array of length 100, with the string in the first positions, then trimming perhaps would better?\n\nAlternatively, the first character is str_list(i)(1:1).\n\nThe problem requires the first character of the current string to equal the last character of the previous.\n\nFor current string, the last character is the last non-blank character? Or the last character stored.\n\nHmm, this is a critical point. The problem likely considers the strings as written exactly, without any trailing spaces, so in Fortran, the strings stored in str_list(i) will have no leading or trailing spaces since we're reading them as list-directed or using a format that strips such.\n\nTherefore, the first character is simply str_list(i)(1:1), and the length is determined by the actual string's characters, but the current string's last character is str_list(i)(len_trim(str_list(i)):len_trim(str_list(i))), but perhaps more simply, find the first character as first_char.\n\nWait let's think about how to get last character of current string.\n\nThe last character is the last non-blank character. Or perhaps, for the current string stored as a string in str_list(i) with fixed length (like 10 character array), but only using the part from the beginning up to the length of the actual string.\n\nHmm, this can be tricky with Fortran's fixed-length strings. Let me see:\n\nThe string \"hoge\" stored in a 10-character variable would be \"hoge      \" (with spaces). So trim(str_list(i)) to find its actual length.\n\nThe last character is the last non-blank? Or is leading / trailing spaces part of the string?\n\nSince the problem is such that each input is a word as per the JVM's Scanner's next(), which trims whitespaces, so in Fortran, list-directed read would have read \"hoge\" into \"hoge\" with the latter characters as spaces. But comparing the trimmed strings would be correct.\n\nWait, but comparing \"hoge\" and \"hoge \" (with a space) would be different. Because in the strings stored in the array, even if the actual word is \"hoge\", the Fortran variable would have \"hoge\" followed by spaces up to length 100, so when comparing two stripped versions. Hmm.\n\nTherefore, to properly compare the strings, we need to use the trimmed version (without the trailing spaces). Thus, the code needs to handle this.\n\nSo, for the purposes of comparisons (both duplicates and first/last characters), the strings should be treated as their actual content without trailing spaces.\n\nSo, the following approach:\n\nWhen comparing strings in the duplicate check, we can compare using trim(str_list(i)) == trim(str_list(j)). However, trim removes leading and trailing space characters. But if the actual input strings have leading spaces? The problem's input probably has no leading/trailing spaces, as per the context. But to be safe, perhaps use adjusted strings.\n\nAlternatively, since in the problem's context, each string is read as a single token (without whitespace), the stored strings have no leading/trailing spaces. Thus, the trimming isn't needed for the strings stored. Because the list-directed read would place the data into the string variable starting at first position, with the rest filled with spaces. However, comparing such variables with their first characters may include leading or trailing spaces if not handled properly.\n\nWait, for example, if the string is 'apple', stored in a variable of 10 characters, then str_list(1)(1:1) would be 'a'.\n\nThe last character of 'apple' is 'e', which is in position 5. But the rest are spaces. Therefore, to get the last character properly:\n\nWe can compute the length of the string using the LEN_TRIM function:\n\nThe length of the string is len_trim(str_list(i)), so the last character is at position len_trim(str_list(i)).\n\nTherefore, the first character is str_list(i)(1:1), the last is str_list(i)(len_trim(str_list(i)): len_trim(str_list(i))).\n\nSo coding that.\n\nTherefore, in the main loop:\n\nInside each iteration i:\n\nAfter checking duplicates, then check the following:\n\nFirst, if i ==1 (first element):\n\n   then, next = last character of this string. But store it for the next elements.\n\nElse (i>1):\n\n   current_first = str_list(i)(1:1)\n\n   if current_first /= next, then ans = false, exit loop.\n\nThen set next to the last character of current string.\n\nSo variables:\n\nnext is a 1-character string, initialized as ' ' (or whatever), but let me initialize it before the loop.\n\nInitialize next to a dummy value before the loop starts (since first time, i=1, then next is set to the last character).\n\nNow code structure:\n\nallocate(str_list), read the strings.\n\nInitialize next: let's set it to a space? Not important since the first iteration will set it properly.\n\nans = .true.\n\nnow loop:\n\ndo i=1,N\n\n   check for duplicates first:\n\n      duplicate = false\n\n      do j=1 to i-1:\n\n         if ( str_list(i) == str_list(j) ) then\n\n             duplicate = true\n\n             exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   if duplicate:\n\n      set ans = false\n\n      exit loop\n\n   end if\n\n   ! Now, check chain condition:\n\n   if i >1 then\n\n      if str_list(i)(1:1) /= next then\n\n          an = false\n\n          exit loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   ! set next to last char of current string:\n\n   len_current = len_trim(str_list(i))\n\n   next = str_list(i)(len_current:len_current)\n\nend do i loop\n\nWait wait, the code above has some flow control.\n\nWait, once a duplication is found, then ans becomes false and you have to exit the entire loop and proceed.\n\nHow can we exit both the i and the j loops?\n\nPossibly, using a flag.\n\nSet a flag after detecting ans = .false., and then after each iteration,\n\nif ans is false, then exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nHere's how to code this:\n\nInside the do i=1,N loop:\n\nFirst check duplicate:\n\nduplicate = .false.\n\ndo j=1, i-1\n\n   if str_list(i)(1:len_trim(str_list(i))) == ... no, wait comparing the whole strings.\n\n   actually, to compare the strings, since trimming might not be needed if they are properly read. Wait, but if they are padded with spaces in the array, then comparing the entire variable would not be correct.\n\nWait if str_list(i) is 'hoge      ' and str_list(j) is 'hoge     ', then test(str_list(i) == str_list(j)) will return false if the trailing space counts as different.\n\nBecause 'hoge      ' (with 6 spaces) vs 'hoge     ' (with 5), so as stored in Fortran arrays, they are different.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait this is a critical problem. To check for duplicates correctly, the code must compare the actual strings excluding trailing spaces. Or, the problem is such that each string is stored correctly without padding?\n\nWait, in the Java code, the Strings are stored exactly as per input (without leading or trailing spaces). Thus, in Fortran, to check for equality we need the strings to be exactly equal, including characters up to their length (so spaces are significant if they are present in input, but in this problem, the input strings are words from next() which wouldn't have trailing spaces).\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to store the actual strings in such a way that their trailing have no spaces, which requires using the left-justified storage with spaces stripped.\n\nIn Fortran, to store a string exactly as the actual content without trailing spaces, the read should put it in the first positions and keep the rest as spaces, so trimming would help.\n\nTherefore, when comparing two strings, we should compare their trimmed values, or a substring from 1 to their length_trim.\n\nSo:\n\nfor strA and strB, which are stored in character(len=100) variables, to check if they are equal as actual input strings, the following would work:\n\nif ( trim(adjustl(strA)) == trim(adjustl(strB)) ) then ...\n\nWait no, trim removes all trailing characters but space. Hmm, better to simply compare the actual content up to their lengths.\n\nWait in this context, each time a string is read with read(*,*) str_list(i), the variable str_list will contain the actual characters, with the rest as spaces, so the actual content is up to the first blank.\n\nHence, for two strings to be equal, their non-whitespace parts must be same. Hence, we can either:\n\n1. Trim both strings and compare.\n\n2. Compare the substring up to the shorter length of both.\n\nBut the simplest way is to use the LEN_TRIM and compare up to that length.\n\nWait, here's a catch: To check whether the strings are the same, the entire non-space part must be identical.\n\nThus, in code terms:\n\nif ( adjustr(str_list(i)) == adjustr(str_list(j)) ) then \n\nBut Fortran has ADJUSTR which shifts the string to the right, so perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should compare TRIM(str_list(i)) == TRIM(str_list(j)).\n\nYes.\n\nTrim removes trailing spaces, so then the two trimmed strings would be identical if the actual inputs are the same.\n\nBut in Fortran:\n\nTRIM(str_list(i)) returns the string without trailing spaces.\n\nThus, to check if the same string:\n\nif ( TRIM(str_list(i)) == TRIM(str_list(j)) ) then ...\n\nSo, this change needs to be made in the duplicate check:\n\nIn the duplicate loop:\n\nduplicate = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, i-1\n\n   if ( TRIM(str_list(i)) == TRIM(str_list(j)) ) then\n\n      duplicate = .true.\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nAh, this is important.\n\nSimilarly, when checking the first character and the last character.\n\nThe first character is the first character of the trimmed string.\n\nWait no, the first character is the first character of the string, which even if there were leading spaces, but given list-directed read, those wouldn't be present. Because in list-directed mode, leading spaces would have been skipped.\n\nWait, for the String being input as \"  hoge \" (with spaces around), the read would intake the \"hoge\" part only as the token? No, list-directed read skips leading space and stops reading at the next whitespace. So in that case, the entire 'hoge' part would be captured (assuming it's in quotes, but without).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait the key point is that in Fortran, using list-directed input:\n\nIf the user enters, for the second string: \"  apple\" (with leading space), then the list-directed read would read the first \"apple\" which is the token. Wait leading spaces are skipped, so if it's in the beginning of the line, the spaces are ignored, but the leading spaces in a string are kept? Or are they treated as part of the string?\n\nWait no, list-directed reads coerce the input into the variable's format. For a character variable, leading and trailing blanks are as read. The list-directed reads skip over leading blanks to get the item, but if there's a space as part of the item, that's complex.\n\nWait maybe this is safer to read the strings into a temporary string using an unformatted read to capture exactly what was given? Maybe using A format.\n\nWait, to clarify:\n\nIf the input for a string is \"hoge\" follows right after the previous number N, then list-directed read would read it into str_list as 'hoge' followed by spaces.\n\nLeading and trailing blanks in the input for a character are preserved? \n\nThe Fortran 90 standard says: \n\nWhen inputting with list-directed, any blanks between the values are treated as item separators. So, leading and trailing spaces within an item would be part of the string?\n\nWait if the user inputs a string with spaces inside, how is that captured?\n\nThe problem states that the strings are given as per Scanner#next, which skips whitespace and takes the next token. So spaces in the token would have been chopped unless quoted. \n\nSo in the problem's input, the strings are tokens without spaces. Hence, in the code, list-directed read is okay, because the strings are read as their tokens, without any whitespace before or after (except that within the token, no spaces). So the stored strings can be safely compared with TRIM, but actually, any trailing spaces in the variable would not be part of the actual string, and the TRIM would handle them.\n\nSo to check for duplicates properly between str_list(i) and str_list(j):\n\nWe need to see whether their trimmed strings are equal.\n\nSo, in the duplicate check loop:\n\n   if ( TRIM(str_list(i)) == TRIM(str_list(j)) ) then \u2192 duplicate.\n\nThe chain conditions:\n\nCurrent string's first character: first_char = str_list(i)(1:1) \u2192 trimmed or not?\n\nWait, the first character of the actual token is fine, as stored in position 1 of str_list(i). Because the leadingspaces are skipped, so the first non-space character is at first position, so the first character is okay.\n\nHowever, the last character must be the last character of the actual string, not the trailing space.\n\nTherefore, to get the last character of the current string's original value (i.e., of the token):\n\nCompute len_trim_str = LEN_TRIM(str_list(i))\n\nthen last_char = str_list(i)(len_trim_str, len_trim_str)\n\nSimilarly, the first character is properly str_list(1:1) \u2013 it will be the first character of the token.\n\nWait, as the tokens are read with list-directed, any leading blanks would have been skipped, so the stored strings' first character is indeed the first character from the input.\n\nTherefore, for first character, just first_char = str_list(i)(1:1).\n\nCombine this with the above understanding, proceed.\n\nThus, in the main loop:\n\ndo i = 1,N\n\n   check for duplicates with TRIM comparisons.\n\n   Then:\n\n   if (i > 1) then\n\n      if str_list(i)(1:1) .ne. next(1:1) then \u2192 ans false etc.\n\n   else \u2192 set next to last_char.\n\n   set next to last_char of current string.\n\n   end do\n\nNow putting this all together:\n\nThe Fortran program would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC109_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, i, j, len_trim_str\ncharacter(len=100), allocatable :: str_list(:)\ncharacter(len=1) :: next\nlogical :: ans =.true.\nlogical :: duplicate\n\n! Read N\n\nread(*,*) N\n\nallocate(str_list(N))\n\n! Read the N strings. Assuming each is a single token line.\n\ndo i = 1,N\n    read(*,*) str_list(i)\nend do\n\nnext = ' '\n\ndo i =1,N\n\n    ! Check for duplicates\n    duplicate = .false.\n\n    do j = 1,i-1\n        if (trim(str_list(i)) == trim(str_list(j)) ) then\n            duplicate = .true.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (duplicate) then\n        ans = .false.\n        exit\n    end if\n\n    ! Check chain condition\n    if (i >1) then\n        if (str_list(i)(1:1) /= next) then\n            ans = .false.\n            exit\n        end if\n    end if\n\n    ! Compute next\n    len_trim_str = len_trim(str_list(i))\n    next = str_list(i)(len_trim_str:len_trim_str)\nend do\n\nif (ans) then\n    print*, \"Yes\"\nelse\n    print*, \"No\"\nend if\n\ndeallocate(str_list)\n\nend program\n\nWait, let me check this code.\n\nDoes next get initialized properly?\n\nInitially, next is set to ' ' (single space). But in the first iteration (i=1):\n\n   duplicate: j loops 1 to 0 \u2192 no loops \u2192 okay \u2192 then:\n\n   since i is 1, chain check is skipping.\n\n   then len_trim_str is computed, next is set to the last character of first string. So next will be correct.\n\nSecond iteration (i=2):\n\nthe first condition (i>1) is true. So compares str_list(2)(1:1) with next (from previous string's end).\n\nYes.\n\nSo that should handle it.\n\nNow, what about variables:\n\nThe str_list is length 100. Perhaps the maximum required. But in the problem, what is the max string length?\n\nThe problem statement for ABC109 B: \"B - ... each string is given between 1 and 100 characters ... etc?\" I'm not sure, but 100 is enough.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\napple\n\neven\n\nno\n\nFirst strings all unique.\n\nCheck chain:\n\napple ends with 'e' \u2192 next is 'e'.\n\nnext must be next character for 'even' \u2192 'e' (matches first char 'e' yes). 'even' ends with 'n'. so next becomes 'n'.\n\nThird string 'no' starts with 'n' \u2192 okay.\n\nAll good \u2192 output Yes.\n\nTest case 2, duplicate:\n\n3\n\napple\n\napple\n\n...\n\nThen first and second are same \u2192 Fail \u2192 output No.\n\nTest case 3: chain break.\n\n3\n\napple\n\npear\n\nthird \u2192 next after apple is 'e', pear starts with p \u2192 no \u2192 output no.\n\nAll should be covered.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nBut let me think about the next variable's initialization:\n\ninitializing next to ' ': the first time it is set to the last character of first string, which overwrites it.\n\nThus, even if initialized as ' ', it won't matter since in first iteration, it doesn't have to check.\n\nAlternatively, next's initial value can be arbitrary, since for the first string's checking, the i>1 doesn't fire.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nOne thing to note: in the 'next = str_list...' statement:\n\nYes, that's fine since it's length 1.\n\nTherefore, this Fortran code should be correct."
