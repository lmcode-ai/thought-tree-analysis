Wait but wait, in Fortran, integer division is truncating towards zero. So if a is negative, then a/2 would be problematic? But in the loop, after exiting, note that at least one of a or b is non-positive. So for instance, after loop exits, suppose a is -1? Then a/2 would be -0.5 which truncates to 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look at what the Java code does step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads two integers a and b from the user. Then it has a loop that counts how many times it can subtract 1 from both a and b as long as both are positive. The loop continues until either a or b becomes zero or negative. After the loop, it calculates ans as the sum of half of the remaining a and half of the remaining b (integer division, I guess). Then it prints the count plus the ans.\n\nHmm, but wait. Looking again at the code: the ans is computed as a/2 + b/2 after the loop. The loop condition is if both a and b are greater than zero, then decrement each and increment count. The loop continues indefinitely until that condition isn't met. So the loop exits when either a or b drops to zero or below. The loop counts the number of times they can both be decremented.\n\nWait, but in Java, the while (true) loop runs infinitely, and inside, the only way to break is when a or b becomes non-positive. So in each iteration, as long as both a and b are positive, we do the steps. Else we exit.\n\nSo the count is the number of steps where both are positive and we subtract them.\n\nThe code after the loop then adds (a divided by 2) and (b divided by 2), but when do these values come from? Because after the loop, at least one of a or b is not positive, so any remaining in a or b is their original values minus the number of decrements.\n\nWait, let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose initial a = 3 and b = 5.\n\nLoop:\nFirst iteration: a and b both >0, so:\n\ncount becomes 1. a becomes 2, b becomes4.\n\nSecond iteration, same, count 2. a=1, b=3.\n\nThird iteration: count 3. a=0, b=2.\n\nNow, next iteration: check if a is 0 and b is positive, so condition fails (since a is 0, not greater than 0). So loop exits.\n\nAfter loop, a is 0, b is 2. Then ans is 0/2 + 2/2 = 1. The total printed is count (3) and ans (1), so 3 4? Wait no, 3 +1 would be 4 if printed together. Wait the code actually does System.out.println(count + \" \" + ans). So the example would output 3 1.\n\nWait, but why are the variables after the loop being divided by 2? So perhaps those are for some other part. Wait, the problem is probably from a programming contest. The original Java code might not be correct, but the problem here requires just translating it.\n\nBut regardless of the logic, the question is to translate the code into Fortran as per given.\n\nSo translating the code structure:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, variables are declared with types. Need to use integer variables.\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nThen loop until when?\n\nThe while(true) loop is tricky in Fortran because you can't have a while(true), but you can loop with an endless loop and have a conditional exit.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps a DO loop with a label and GOTO.\n\nAlternatively, use a DO loop and loop until a condition is met.\n\nWait, Fortran doesn't have a direct while loop in some older versions, but since you can have a loop with a condition. Or maybe use a DO WHILE.\n\nAh right, in Fortran, you can use a DO WHILE loop:\n\nDO\n   ... statements ...\n   IF (condition) EXIT\nEND DO\n\nAlternatively,\n\nDO WHILE ( condition )\n\nBut in this case, the loop continues until condition a <=0 or b <=0.\n\nWait, the Java loop continues until the \"if\" condition is false, then breaks. So the loop runs as long as the condition is true.\n\nWait the loop in Java is while(true) but in the loop body, it first checks if a and b are positive, and only then does the action. So the loop runs forever, but the only way to break is by hitting the else break.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can structure this as a loop that runs until either a or b is non-positive:\n\nSo code outline:\n\nInitialize a and b.\n\ncount = 0\n\nDO\n   if (a >0 and b>0) then\n       count = count +1\n       a = a -1\n       b = b -1\n   else\n       exit\n   end if\nEND DO\n\nWait but in the Java code, even if after decrementing, in the next iteration, the check would ensure both are positive again?\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nInside the loop, the code says: if (a>0 && b>0) then do the steps else break.\n\nWait, no. The only break is when the condition is false. The S stands in the loop, then if condition is true, do the steps. Else break.\n\nWait in pseudocode:\n\nDo forever:\n\n   if (a>0 and b>0) do the steps, inc count, dec a and b, continue loop\n\n else: break the loop.\n\nThus the loop continues until at least one of a or b is <=0.\n\nYes. So in Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\nDO\n\n   IF (a > 0 .AND. b >0 ) THEN\n\n       count = count + 1\n\n       a = a -1\n\n       b = b -1\n\n   ELSE\n\n       EXIT\n\n   END IF\n\nEND DO\n\nThat should do it.\n\nThen, compute ans as (a/2) + (b/2). Since in Fortran, integers divided with / do integer division (truncation towards zero), which is the same as Java's / for positive numbers.\n\nBut need to make sure that a and b can be negative after the loop executes. Wait in the loop, the last iteration where a and b are both >0 will decrement them both once, so after loop, one of:\n\nEither a became a-1, which must be a-1 could be 0, and same for b. Let me see:\n\nExample: suppose a and b start as 1 each. Then loop enters, count becomes 1, a becomes 0, b becomes 0. Next iteration, a or b are zero (not positive), so exit loop. Then in ans, 0/2 +0/2=0. So total count is 1, answer 0.\n\nAnother case: a=5 and b=3.\n\nloop runs 3 times (because min(5,3)=3). Thus count becomes 3. Then a is 5-3=2, b is 0.\n\nThen ans is 2/2 +0/2=1 +0=1. So total outputs 3 1.\n\nThe code's calculation of ans after the loop is using the remaining a and b.\n\nNow, in Fortran, to compute ans as integers:\n\nIn code:\n\nans = (a / 2) + (b / 2)\n\nOnce that's done, print count and ans separated by space.\n\nNow, the input is via standard input in Java using Scanner. In Fortran, standard input can be read via read(*,*) a, b.\n\nThe Fortran code structure would be something like:\n\nprogram codeforces_581a\n  implicit none\n  integer :: a, b, count, ans\n\n  read(*,*) a, b\n  count =0\n\n  DO\n     if (a >0 .AND. b>0) then\n         count = count +1\n         a = a -1\n         b = b -1\n     else\n         exit\n     end if\n  END DO\n\n  ans = a /2 + b /2\n  print *, count, ans\n\nend program codeforces_581a\n\nWait that should be correct.\n\nWait but wait, in Fortran, integer division is truncating towards zero. So if a is negative, then a/2 would be problematic? But in the loop, after exiting, note that at least one of a or b is non-positive. So for instance, after loop exits, suppose a is -1? Then a/2 would be -0.5 which truncates to 0. But perhaps the problem's test cases ensure that variables are non-negative at this point.\n\nHmm, not sure, but according to the given Java code, it is allowed to go into cases where a or b is negative here. But since the problem might be ensuring that, perhaps the code just needs to replicate exactly.\n\nAnother possibility: the initial problem may have constraints that a and b are non-negative, so in the code it's safe.\n\nOkay, so this Fortran code should be correct.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, after the loop, the a and/or b can be negative. However, when doing a/2, if a is negative, the division in Java would also truncate towards zero, same as Fortran.\n\nYes, so this would be correct.\n\nSo the program is as above.\n\nWait, let me check syntax.\n\nProgram name: codeforces_581a? The original was codeforces_581_A, but Fortran might have limits on the characters. But I think underscores are allowed.\n\nVariables declared with integer type.\n\nRead *, a, b is correct (alternatively, read(*,*) a, b).\n\nTrapping a and b via input.\n\nThe loop structure seems okay.\n\nVariables are count initialized to 0.\n\nThe calculation of ans: a divided by 2 plus b divided by 2. Correct.\n\nFinally, output with print *, count, ans.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the print statement automatically adds a new line, so that should work.\n\nTesting with the example I thought of earlier: a=3, b=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nInitially, a=3, b=5. count 0.\n\nInside loop:\n\nCheck yes, a and b both >0. count becomes 1, a=2, b=4.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nCheck yes, a=2>0 and b=4>0. count 2. a=1, b=3.\n\nNext iteration: a=1>0 and b=3>0. count 3. a becomes 0, b=2.\n\nNext iteration check: a is 0, so condition is false. Exit loop.\n\nThen ans is (0/2)+(2/2)=0 +1=1. So total 3 1, correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=0 and b=5, initially. The loop won't run, since a is already 0. So count is 0. ans (0/2) +5/2 =0 +2=2. So output 0 2.\n\nWait in that case:\n\nWait original code:\n\na =0 and b=5: after loop, count is 0. ans is 0/2 (0) and 5 divided by 2 is 2 (since 5/2=2.5 floored?), yes. So 0+2=2.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case, a=1, b=1. Then count becomes 1. Both become 0. ans (0/2)+(0/2)=0. Output 1 0.\n\nAnother case where a=-1, b=3 (perhaps user entered). then the loop doesn't even run. ans: (-1 /2 ) + 3/2 = -0.5 rounds to -0. (but in integer division -0.5 would be -0 or ?) Wait in Fortran, division truncates towards zero. So -1 /2 = -0.5 -> -0, so 0? Because in integer division, -1//2 = -0.5, but in Fortran, integer division would give -0, which is 0? So yes, for a=-1, it would be ( (-1)/2 = -0.5 \u2192 0?), since integer division would truncate towards 0, -1/2 \u2192 0.\n\nHmm, in Java, -1 /2 is -0 (0). So yes, same.\n\nIn code.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nSo the translated code is as above. Let me write it again in the correct syntax.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nThe Fortran code is as follows."
