    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code takes three integers from the user: T, S, and q. Then it initializes a variable previous to S. It also has an answer counter starting at 0. The loop runs as long as previous is less than T. Each iteration, it multiplies previous by q and increments the answer. Finally, it prints the answer.\n\nAlright, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nIn Fortran, input is usually handled with read(*,*) statements. So I'll need to read T, S, q from the user. Wait, but in Java they are read via Scanner's nextInt. So same here.\n\nVariables: The variables T, S, q are integers. previous is a long in Java, but in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Wait, the problem might require handling large numbers since multiplying by q each step. So maybe previous should be a 64-bit integer? In Fortran, that's either selected_int_kind(18) or using 'integer*8'. Hmm. The original code uses long, which is 64 bits in Java, so I should use a 64-bit integer in Fortran. So perhaps declare previous as integer(8) or use a kind parameter. Let me decide to use integer(8).\n\nThe loop: do while (previous < T). Then increment answer and multiply previous by q.\n\nFortran's loop constructs: a do loop. Let's see.\n\nLet me structure the variables.\n\nProgram variables: T, S, q (integers), previous (integer(8)), answer (integer).\n\nInitialization: previous = S, answer = 0.\n\nWait, but S is an integer, so when storing into previous which is integer(8), that's okay.\n\nThen loop:\n\ndo while (previous < T)\n   answer = answer +1\n   previous = previous * q\nend do\n\nWait, but Fortran is older, so maybe the variables have to be declared first.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_569_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: T, S, q, answer\n  integer(8) :: previous\n\n  read(*,*) T, S, q\n  previous = S\n  answer = 0\n\n  do while (previous < T)\n    answer = answer + 1\n    previous = previous * q\n  end do\n\n  write(*,*) answer\n\nend program codeforces_569_A\n\nHmm. Let me check possible issues.\n\nWait, in the loop condition: the multiplication by q could potentially overflow, but in Fortran, with integer(8), it's big enough for typical cases. Since Java's code works with long, we need the same here.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, S is an int, but when multiplied by q (int), but stored in a long. So in Fortran, since previous is integer(8), even if S is small, the multiplication is done in the 64-bit type, so overflow would occur only when reaching very large numbers, but the problem probably expects standard overflow behavior.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, variables need to be declared with their types. The code above declares them properly.\n\nWait: in the read statement, variables T, S, q are integers. The input is read correctly? The read(*,*) should read three integers into those variables.\n\nYes, that should be okay.\n\nAnother possible issue: what if q is 1? Then the loop would run indefinitely. Wait, but maybe the original code handled this? Let me see the Java code. Let's see, if q is 1, then previous remains S, so if S < T, the loop would run forever (unless S equals T or becomes larger). Hmm, but maybe the problem's constraints avoid that? Not sure, but the translation would carry forward that behavior.\n\nOther than that, the code should work.\n\nWait, let's confirm the loop logic: initial previous is S. If S >= T, loop doesn't execute, answer is 0. That's correct as per Java code.\n\nAnother test case: suppose T=100, S=10, q=2. The steps are:\n\nStart previous =10 <100 \u2192 answer becomes 1, previous =20\n\nThen 20 <100 \u2192 answer 2, prev 40\n\nThen 40 \u21923 \u219280\n\nNext, 80 \u21924 \u2192160. Now previous (160) is >=100 \u2192 exit. So total answer 3 times. Wait Wait:\n\nWait first iteration: after multiplying by q (2 each time):\n\nInitial previous =10.\n\nAfter 1st loop: 20 (answer becomes 1)\n\n2nd iteration \u219240 (answer 2)\n\n3rd \u219280 (ans 3)\n\n4th: 80*2=160 <100? No, its 160>100, so loop stops. The answer is 3.\n\nThe Java code would output 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems okay.\n\nAnother edge case: if S is already greater or equal to T, then answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case where q is 0. But then after first step, previous becomes S *0, which could be 0. But if T is, say 5, and S is 5. Then if q is 0, then initial previous is 5 which equals T, so answer 0.\n\nBut if S=3, q=0, T=5: previous becomes 0, which is less than T. Then next step would answer increment, but previous *0 is 0 again. So we end up in an infinite loop. So that's a problem. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that q is >=2 or some other condition. Since the input handling is the same between Java and Fortran, this is not a problem of the code but the input.\n\nSo the translation seems correct.\n\nSo I think the Fortran code would be as I wrote above. Let me write it again properly formatted.\n\nThe program name should be the same as the Java class? Probably, but in Fortran programs start with program [name]. The problem might just need a program that reads the inputs and prints the answer. So the above should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the write statement's format. The code uses write(*,*) answer. That should print it as an integer. Since answer is an integer variable, it should output correctly.\n\nSo I think that's the correct translation."
