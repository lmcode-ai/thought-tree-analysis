So after every pair, a space is added, leading to a trailing space at the end of each line. But in the end, after finishing the inner loop, the program calls pw.println(), so it adds a new line. So the line would have trailing space which is printed as part of the line, but maybe acceptable.",

After the two numbers, then a space, and after each j step, it's adding that pair and space \u2192 so perhaps each iteration of the loop (j loop) produces two numbers and an extra space, but then at the end after all inner loops, it does a line, so perhaps the final output ends with a space per line, but the code is supposed to write exactly n numbers, spaced with inbetween.\n\nWait for instance, in n=3, the row would contain two numbers (each j iteration gives two numbers], so the inner loop runs once (j=0 \u2192 two numbers per row \u2192 2 numbers, but then an extra space, but the problem may require them not to care about trailing space. However, with n=3, 2 numbers per row, that can't form n elements. So perhaps that implies code is incorrect?",

Now, considering the loops. Another example: n=2. The matrix is 2x2. The code loops i from 1 to 2 (loop=2). div=1. Row 1 (i=1 is odd). Each j loop (1 time):\n\nFirst pair:\n\nnum1 = odd[front_odd =1], which is 1, then front_odd becomes 2. num2 = even[back_even =2], which is 4 (because even array is [2,4] \u2192 index 2 is 4). Then back_even becomes 1. So this gives 1,4. Then the next is line 1, but div=1, so that's it for the inner loop. Then after printing that pair, goes to new line. Next i=2 (even):\n\nj loops 1 time. Processing for even i:\n\nnum1 is even[front_even =1 \u2192 2], front_even becomes 2. num2 is odd[back_odd=2 (initially 2 because the odds array has two elements (1,3) \u2192 back_odd was initially 2 \u2192 then after first iteration, pointers:\n\nAfter first row:",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the code does. \n\nThe Java program takes an integer n from the input, calculates square = n*n. Then it separates numbers from 1 to square into odd and even lists. After that, it loops through these numbers in a certain pattern and prints them out in a specific arrangement. The main part is about generating a matrix in some pattern based on odd and even numbers. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about how to do each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the input and output. In Fortran, instead of Scanner and PrintWriter, we can use standard I/O routines. The main program will read n from the input. \n\nThe odd and even lists: in Java they are ArrayLists. In Fortran, dynamic arrays might be tricky, but since we know the size of the square (n*n), perhaps we can use static arrays. But first, let's see the details.\n\nThe code initializes two lists: odd and even. Numbers from 1 to square are added to them based on whether they're odd or even. So in Fortran, perhaps two arrays of size square, but since odds and evens can be tracked:\n\nWait, the total number of odd numbers is (square +1)/2 if square is odd, or square/2 if even. But for n squared, since n could be any integer. Let's think: when n is even, say 4, square is 16. All evens are 16/2 numbers, and odds as well. If n is odd, say 3: square 9, odds are 5, evens 4.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's better to precompute two arrays. Let me think. Alternatively, have two arrays: odd and even. Their sizes can be determined as:\n\nTotal numbers in odds is up to (square +1)/2. Evens are the rest. So in Fortran, perhaps allocate arrays of size square each, then track the counts.\n\nAlternatively, since in the Java code they start with empty lists and add elements. In Fortran, arrays are fixed size, so better to pre-allocate arrays with the maximum possible size. Wait, but arrays in Fortran can be declared as allocatable. Let's see.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute square = n * n.\n\nInitialize two arrays for odds and evens, their size is known:\n\nnumber_of_odds is (square +1)/2 (because every other number starting at 1 is odd). Similarly, evens is square // 2.\n\nWait for example: for 4, square 16. Evens are 8, odds 8. For 3, 9, then 5 and 4.\n\nIn Fortran, since we need the capacity for each array, perhaps:\n\nINTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: odd(:), even(:)\n\nALLOCATE(odd( (square +1)/2 ), even( square / 2 ) )\n\nBut then, we need to fill them. Let me see how to loop from 1 to square, adding to the arrays.\n\nAlternatively, loop through 1 to square, and for each i:\n\nif mod(i,2) ==1 then add to odd array else even array.\n\nBut since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. Wait, in Java the code starts at i=1 and increments by 1. So in Fortran, the same can be done with a loop.\n\nAlternatively, create two arrays and track an index variable for the current position to insert.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using separate counters for index for odd and even.\n\nInitialize count_odd =0, count_even=0.\n\nThen, loop i from 1 to square.\n\nif mod(i,2) ==1 then\n\n    count_odd = count_odd +1\n\n    odd(count_odd) = i\n\nelse\n\n    count_even = count_even +1\n\n    even(count_even) = i\n\nSo that way, when starting with arrays allocated at the maximum possible size. The size would be the number of odds possible. For n=3, square 9, number of odds is 5, evens 4. So the initial allocations can be square for both, but it's unnecessary. But given that in Java they used ArrayLists which grow as needed, perhaps using allocatable arrays with preliminary size (max possible) would be better.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize variables count_odd=0, count_even=0.\n\nThen go through each i.\n\nFor each i from 1 to square:\n\n     if mod(i,2) == 1:\n\n          count_odd=count_odd +1\n\n          odd(count_odd)=i\n\n     else:\n\n          count_even=count_even +1\n\n          even(count_even)=i\n\nWe need to have the arrays ALLOCATABLE with proper sizes. Wait, this approach requires first determining the allocated size before assignment. So we can first calculate the total odds and evens, then allocate the arrays using that size.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nnumber_odds = (square +1)/2 ?\n\nYes. Because for square even, say 4, 4+1=5/2=2.5 \u2192 but in Fortran, integer division. Wait, maybe better number_odds = (square +1)/2 if square is even or odd:\n\nFor square even (n even):\n\nsquare=4 \u2192 5/2 \u2192 2.5 \u2192 but integer division would be 2? Wait (5/2) in integer division in Fortran is 2).\n\nThe actual number of odds in 1-4:\n\n1,3 \u2192 so two. So number_odds is indeed (square)/2, but when square is even. Wait Wait, (4+1)/2 is 2.5 \u2192 in Fortran, (square +1)/2 would be 2.5, but integer division truncates? Or do we need to use ceiling?\n\nHmm, perhaps for square even:\n\nnumber_odds = (square)/2 \u2192 for square even.\n\nWait 4 \u2192 4/2=2 (correct).\n\nFor n=3 (square=9):\n\nnumber_odds is 5 \u2192 (9+1)/2 =5 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait square is 9: (9+1)/2=5 \u2192 exactly right. So that formula gives correct number_odds regardless of evenness.\n\nSo the number of odd numbers from 1 to square is (square +1)/2, yes.\n\nThus, the arrays can be allocated with size:\n\nALLOCATE( ODD((square +1)/2 ), EVEN( square / 2 ) )\n\nWait square/2 gives evens, yes.\n\nThis way, the arrays will have exactly the right size. Perfect.\n\nSo the first part's code structure would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nsquare = n*n\n\nallocate odds and evens.\n\nLoop from 1 to square, and assign each number to the right array in order.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nThen comes the loop part:\n\nThe variables loop = square / n \u2192 because n is the size of the matrix's sidelength, so the matrix is square divided by n \u2192 since square is n^2. So loop = n squared / n \u2192 n. Wait loop is equal to n? Because n squared divided by n is n. So loop is n.\n\nWait in the Java code, 'loop' is declared as square / n \u2192 but square is n*n \u2192 so square/n is n. So loop is n.\n\nAh yes, so loop is n.\n\nThen 'div' is loop / 2 \u2192 which for loop=n, that's floor(n/2). For example, n=4 \u2192 loop is4, div is 2. n=3 \u2192 div is 1 (since 3/2 is 1.5 \u2192 using integer division, it'll be 1).\n\nThe debug statement: In Java it's printing this, so perhaps in Fortran it's a print statement. But the user probably wants to exclude the debug function. So perhaps in the Fortran code, since the problem requires the translation, but the debug is just for themselves, we can omit that line or replace it with a comment.\n\nThen the main loops:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <= loop; i++) \u2192 in Fortran, a do loop from i=1 to loop.\n\nInside that, looping over j from 0 to div -1 (since in Java the loop is for (int j=0; j < div; j++ ) ).\n\nThen, for each inner iteration, check if i is odd or even (i%2==1: corresponds to odd, else even).\n\nThen: when i is odd:\n\npw prints odd.remove(0) and then even.remove(even.size()-1), followed by a space (but the Java code has \" \" +... which adds a space. Wait, in Java the code uses odd.remove(0) is first element, since ArrayList in Java, which is zero-based. Wait in the code:\n\nThe odd list starts with elements in the order of 1,3,5,... etc. So when we remove(0), that's the first element. Similarly, even.remove(even.size()-1) would be the last element of even array. Then in the next part, for even i, even.remove(0) is first element of even, and then odd.remove(odd.size()-1), the last element of odd array. Each time, they remove the elements from the start and end.\n\nWait the Java code's approach is similar to a two ends method:\n\nfor each two element pair in the inner loop (div per outer loop step?), they take from the start of the relevant list and the end of another list and alternate.\n\nThe key idea is that the two lists are being consumed from their ends or the beginning in different ways, depending on the row (i even or odd).\n\nThe problem is that when you call remove(0), the list shifts its elements, so the next removal from 0 will get the next element. Similarly, the last one would be the next one after removing the last. In Java ArrayList, remove(0) removes the first element, and remove(n-1) removes the last element (assuming size is n before remove).\n\nIn Fortran, we have arrays. So to do the same, perhaps we can track pointers. Because removing elements from the beginning and end would require dynamic data structure, but with arrays, perhaps better to use pointers indicating next element to take from the start and end.\n\nWait, in the code, since the odd and even arrays are filled in order, the first element of odd is the first odd number, etc. So for example, odd contains [1,3,5,...], and even [2,4,6,...].\n\nWhen they do odd.remove(0), that's taking element 1 (since in Java indices start at 0). In the fortran array, the first element is always present. So perhaps in Fortran, we can have two pointers or indices:\n\nfor odds array: frontptr, backptr.\n\nSimilarly for the even array. \n\nBecause the code uses:\n\nfor i odd:\n\nwe take the first element of odd (since removing from beginning), then the last element of even (remove from end). \n\nWait the code in Java for when i is odd:\n\neven's last element is being removed from the end. So each call to even.remove(size-1) takes the last element and removes it.\n\nBut each time we call that in a loop, it's moving the back pointer.\n\nWait let's see: for instance, even starts with elements [2,4,6,8,...].\n\nWhen we remove from the end first (e.g., 8), then next time it will be the new last element (e.g.6 if removed once, etc). So perhaps for each array (odd and even), we can have two indices: first and last available.\n\nSo for example for the odds array:\n\ninitial first_odd_pointer = 1\n\nlast_odd_pointer = size_odd (which is (sq+1)/2)\n\nsimilar for even.\n\nThen, each time when you need to take from the front (remove(0)), you take the first element (first_odd_pointer) and then first_odd_pointer +=1.\n\nTo take from the end (like even's last element), take even's current last (initially first_even+last_even?), no. Wait the even array is filled in order so even(1)=2, even(2)=4, etc. So the last element's index is last_even_pointer = size_even.\n\nThen, taking 'remove from end' (i.e, taking the value at last_even and then decrementing the pointer.\n\nWait perhaps this approach:\n\nInitialize for the odd array:\n\nfront0 =1, back0= n0 (where n0 is number_odds)\n\nFor the even array:\n\nfront1=1, back1 = n1 (where n1 is number_evens)\n\nThen,\n\nfor each case:\n\nwhen i is odd:\n\ntake front_odd (odd(front0)), then increment front0 by 1.\n\nthen take back_even (even(back1)), then decrement back1 by1.\n\nThe output is these two numbers, separated by space.\n\nWhen i is even:\n\ntake front_even (even(front1)), then front1 +=1\n\nthen take back_odd (odd(back0)), then back0 -=1?\n\nWait, wait the Java code for even i says:\n\nit first even.remove(0) \u2192 the first element of the even array, so front.\n\nThen, odd's remove(size-1), so the last element. So for odd: taking the last element. \n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor even case (i even):\n\nthe seond element is odd.remove(odd.size()-1)\n\nThe code for when i is even is:\n\npw.print(even.remove(0) + \" \" + (odd.remove(odd.size() - 1)) + \" \");\n\nSo the first value is removing 0, the front of the even array, and the second is removing the end (last element) of the odd array. \n\nSo for the even case, the steps are: \n\ntake front of even (then increment even's front pointer?), and take last of odd (and decrement odd's back pointer).\n\nThen, after this, we continue until the loop conditions.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the pointers need to be tracked for both arrays. \n\nThus:\n\nInitialize:\n\nfor odds: let's have front_odd and back_odd as indices to the current position.\n\nInitially front_odd = 1; back_odd = size_odds.\n\nfront even and back even:\n\nfront_even =1 ; back_even = size_evens.\n\nThen, in each iteration of j from 0 to div-1:\n\nLoop over i from 1 to loop (loop is n):\n\nWait let me consider the loops in order.\n\nSo the outer loop is over i from 1 to loop (i.e., n times).\n\nThen, inner loop over j from 1 to div (div = loop/2 \u2192 which is floor(n/2)).\n\nWait wait in JAVA, the j is looped 0 to div-1 (so exactly 'div' times). So the inner lop runs exactly div times.\n\nAt each step:\n\nfor each i and j in loops:\n\nif i is odd:\n\ntake the next front_odd (current front_odd), increment front_odd.\n\nthen the next is the back_even (back_even element, decrement back_even).\n\nthen print both numbers with a space. \n\nWait no: the Java code prints the two elements, so in the print statement, \n\nthe two terms are \"odd.remove(0)\" followed by \"even.remove(even.size-1)\", so each pair uses two numbers, added with a space between. And then the trailing space? Because the code has \" \" + ... So for each of those two numbers, they are printed with space separators, and perhaps after the two, another space?\n\nWait looking at the Java code's print statement for when i is even:\n\npw.print(even.remove(0) + \" \" + (odd.remove(odd.size() - 1)) + \" \");\n\nSo the two numbers are printed separated by a space, and then another space at the end. But that might lead to an trailing space. But in some problems, that is allowed \u2013 possibly, but maybe in the Fortran code, that space needs to be managed properly.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran we can print each pair with a space, ensuring that there's no trailing space. So in Fortran's case, after two numbers printed, perhaps just do not add the trailing space. Let me see:\n\nThe Java code has in the line after printing, a 'pw.println()' outside the inner loops. \n\nWait the inner loops:\n\nfor each inner j step, the code is printing two numbers followed by \" \" but then after all inner j loops done, the code does a println. \n\nWait let's see code structure:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor each i from 1..n (loop):\n\n    for j from 0 to (div-1):\n\n        print two numbers and spaces.\n\n    After inner loop, do a println.\n\nSo the placement is: each row (outer i loop iteration) has 2* div numbers. Because each j iteration prints two numbers, so total 2*div numbers per row. Since the div is n/2 (when n even) or floor(n/2), then 2*(n/2)=n terms. So n numbers per row.\n\nThe spaces between them: each pair is printed with a space between them, and the pairs are separated by another space?\n\nWait the code for the two numbers has \" + \" and then another \" + \" ... Let me see:\n\nodd.remove(0) + \" \" + (even.remove(even.size() - 1)) + \" \");\n\nSo the two values are converted to strings, and each separated by a space. The '+' operator connects them followed by another space. \n\nSo for example, the two numbers (a and b) become a 'a ', then ' b' with the space, so the total becomes a\" \"b\" \"? \n\nWait maybe better: the code does the first value as string, adds a \" \", then the second value as string, then adds a space again. So after every pair, a space is added, leading to a trailing space at the end of each line. But in the end, after finishing the inner loop, the program calls pw.println(), so it adds a new line. So the line would have trailing space which is printed as part of the line, but maybe acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the trailing space can be ignored. \n\nIn Fortran, to replicate this, the approach would be to print each pair with a space in between, and then after all pairs (i.e., j iterations per row), end with a new line.\n\nSo:\n\nFor each i in 1..n:\n\n    for j in 1..div:\n\n        print the two numbers, separated by a space. \n\n    then, after all j's, print a new line.\n\nWait in Fortran, the New Line can be achieved by an implicit newline with *, or using write statements.\n\nThe specific way to print the two numbers separated by a space without a space at the end is better. Let me think of the code structure.\n\nThe Fortran code would have to use a loop over each j (from 1 to div). \n\nInside the j loop:\n\nif i is even/odd.\n\nTake the next two numbers from the arrays and pointers, and write them, separated by a space. \n\nWait also, the Fortran arrays are starting at 1. \n\nPutting it all together: the steps for translation.\n\n1. Read n.\n\nsquare = n*n\n\n2. Compute loop = n (since square div n is n).\n\ndiv = loop /2 \u2192 integer division.\n\n3. Allocate odd and even arrays.\n\nnumber_odds = (square +1)/2\n\nnumber_evens = square / 2 \n\nallocate odd(1:number_odds)\n\nallocate even(1:number_evens)\n\n4. Fill the arrays:\n\ncount_odd =0, count_even=0\n\ndo i =1, square\n\n    if MOD(i,2) ==1 then\n\n        count_odd=count_odd +1\n\n        odd(count_odd) = i\n\n    else\n\n        count_even=count_even +1\n\n        even(count_even)=i\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n5. Now set the pointers:\n\nfront_odd =1\n\nback_odd = number_odds\n\nfront_even=1\n\nback_even = number_evens\n\n6. Now the loops:\n\ndo i=1, loop \n\n    do j=1, div \n\n        if MOD(i,2) ==1 then\n\n            ! first take front_odd and advance front_odd\n\n            ! get number off_odd = odd(front_odd)\n\n            num1 = odd(front_odd)\n\n            front_odd = front_odd +1\n\n            ! then take the even array's back_even element and decrement\n\n            num2 = even(back_even)\n\n            back_even = back_even -1\n\n        else\n\n            ! when i even:\n\n            num1 = even(front_even)\n\n            front_even = front_even +1 \n\n            ! second is the odd's back_odd:\n\n            num2 = odd(back_odd)\n\n            back_odd = back_odd -1\n\n        end if\n\n        ! print num1 and num2, separated by a space\n\n        write(*, '(i0,1x,i0)', advance=no) num1, num2\n\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*) ! new line\n\nend do\n\nWait but check this logic. Since for each j in 1..div, the code produces a pair of numbers, each pair separated by a space. After all the pairs per line, a new line.\n\nYes. The advance=no is necessary to prevent the write statement from adding a new line, thus allowing everything on the same line per row.\n\nAlso, the pointers must be updated correctly each time.\n\nWait for the pointers: in the first case (i odd), the first number is taken from front_odd, and then front_odd moves to next element.\n\nThe second number comes from the back of even. So we take the current back_even, then back_even is decremented so next time, even's next to last element will be taken.\n\nYes.\n\nWait when i is even, for the second number (num2), that comes from the back_odd.\n\nBecause in even's case (code in Java: odd.remove(odd.size-1) ), so it's getting the last element in the array. \n\nWait in Fortran, the odd array's last element is at index back_odd. Taking odd(back_odd), and then decrement back_odd by one so next back_odd is now one less.\n\nYes, correct. \n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nPotential corner cases: Let's see n=1.\n\nn=1, square is 1 \u2192 which is odd.\n\nThen, loop is 1.\n\ndiv is 1//2 \u21920. So the inner loop would run from 1 to 0, but in Fortran, does this loop run 0 times?\n\nIn Java, the inner loop is for j from 0 to div-1 (div is 0 \u2192 j runs from 0 downto -1 \u2192 no iterations.)\n\nIn Fortran, loop j=1 to 0 is executed 0 times, which is correct.\n\nWait no: when div is 0, the j steps from 1 to 0 \u2192 which is a negative count, so the loop does not execute. So that's okay.\n\nAnother test case: n=2 (even):\n\nsquare 4 \u2192 2x2 matrix.\n\nloop is 2 (loop=n)\n\ndiv =2/2=1.\n\nNumber of odds: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 no, wait (4+1)=5, divided by 2. Since in Fortran, integer division. So if (square+1)/2 uses integer division (// for integer division), then if it's 5//2 \u2192 2.5, but integer division would be 2, which is wrong because square=4 has 2 odds (1,3). But with 4+1 is 5/2 \u2192 2.5 \u2192 integer division would return 2, correct. Wait wait, 4 has exactly two odds (1,3). So (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 when using slash (/) in Fortran for real, but since and are integers, it can depend. Wait better to compute as (square +1) divided by 2 with integer division. Like (square+1)/2. But let me check:\n\nInteger n = (4+1)/2 is 2 (if integer division truncates towards zero), but 2.5 \u2192 integer division would be 2. But in reality, the correct number of odds is 2. So yes.\n\nThus the initial allocation for the arrays:\n\nnumber_odds = (4 +1)/2 \u2192 integer division gives 2? Wait depends on if it's double division or integer division.\n\nWait let's be precise.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, variables are integers, then (square+1) divided by 2, so:\n\nsquare integer, so (square+1) is integer. Then when / is used, in integer context, would that be integer division? \n\nIn code:\n\nnumber_odds = (square +1)/2 \u2192 if square +1 is odd, like 9, (9+1) would be 10, so 5 \u2192 but if square =4 \u2192 then (4+1)=5, divided by 2 is 2.5, but as integer division, that would be 2. So the code would allocate an array with size 2 which is exactly correct for the 2 odds (1,3).\n\nWait no, 2.5 as integer division would be 2. Yes.\n\nWait for odd n, like n=3, square=9 \u2192 (9+1)/2 =5 \u2192 exactly the correct count. So yes. So the code to compute number_odds is okay.\n\nSo the code would correctly fill the arrays.\n\nNow, considering the loops. Another example: n=2.\n\nThe matrix is 2x2. The code loops i from 1 to 2 (loop=2).\n\ndiv=1.\n\nRow 1 (i=1 is odd).\n\nEach j loop (1 time):\n\nFirst pair:\n\nnum1 = odd[front_odd =1], which is 1, then front_odd becomes 2.\n\nnum2 = even[back_even =2], which is 4 (because even array is [2,4] \u2192 index 2 is 4). Then back_even becomes 1. \n\nSo this gives 1,4.\n\n Then the next is line 1, but div=1, so that's it for the inner loop. \n\nThen after printing that pair, goes to new line.\n\nNext i=2 (even):\n\nj loops 1 time.\n\nProcessing for even i:\n\nnum1 is even[front_even =1 \u2192 2], front_even becomes 2.\n\nnum2 is odd[back_odd=2 (initially 2 because the odds array has two elements (1,3) \u2192 back_odd was initially 2 \u2192 then after first iteration, pointers:\n\nAfter first row:\n\nThe initial front_odd is 1 \u2192 now after first use it's 2. \n\n back_odd is 2 (since first time, not yet used).\n\nWait when processing for i=1\u2019s j=1 step:\n\nnum1 is taken as odd[front_odd=1] \u2192 1. Then front_odd becomes 2. \n\nnum2 is even[back_even =2 \u2192 4]. back_even becomes 1.\n\nThen, for i=2 (even):\n\nnum1 = even[front_even =1 \u2192 2], so front_even becomes 2.\n\nnum2 is odd[ back_odd =2 \u21923]. Then back_odd becomes 1.\n\nThe two numbers here are 2 and 3 \u2192 so the second line prints 2 3, then newline.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n1 4 \n\n2 3 \n\nBut wait the problem expects the correct arrangement. Maybe I need to check what the code does.\n\nWait the Java code for n=2:\n\nAfter separating evens and odds:\n\nodds are [1,3], evens [2,4].\n\nThen loop n=2, div=1.\n\nRow i=1 (odd). The first step (j runs once):\n\nremoves first odd (so [3]), and removes last even (4 \u2192 then evens is left with [2].\n\nSo first pair is 1 and 4. \u2192 printed as \"1 4\"\n\nRow i=1 is complete \u2192 then the next row i=2 (even). \n\nAt that moment:\n\neven array is now [2] (since after first iteration, even's last was 4, which was removed, so current even array (since they are lists in Java) after that is [2].\n\nWait for even.remove on last element:\n\nInitially even has elements [2,4].\n\nafter first step (i=1, j=0 (only j loop?), when even.remove(even.size-1)) which is the last (4). Thus evens is now [2].\n\nThe next step for i=2 (even):\n\nthey remove(0) \u2192 which is evens[0] (if java 0-based) \u2192 2's first element. So that's the 2, then even becomes empty (but in code, since they have j only goes once, but when i=2's j=0 iteration:\n\neven is now [2] (from start of the line i=2), so even[0] \u2192 2 is taken. \n\nThen, take the odd's last element (3). \n\nThus the second row's numbers are 2 and 3. \n\nThus the arrangement is what the Fortran code's approach would reproduce. So the final matrix for n=2 is:\n\n1 4 \n\n2 3 \n\nIn matrix terms (2x2):\n\nFirst row 1 and then 4?\n\nWait the question is, what is the actual output format.\n\nThe code in Java, in the first row, for the line i=1 (first row), the inner loop for j from 0 to div-1 (div=1, so j=0). \n\nThe two numbers printed are (after a prints, then a space and the next number, then another space (but the code appends a + \" \" at the end, so maybe that adds a trailing space? But then after the inner loop, the code.println() is called, which puts a newline. So the line would have two numbers followed by two spaces? Like \"1 4 \" \u2192 which after the loop could have an extra space but probably the problem ignores it. \n\nIn any case, the Fortran code's approach ensures that each pair is printed with a space between them, and a newline at the end.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nNeed to remember: in Fortran, arrays are one-based, indices start at 1.\n\nAlso, the pointers:\n\nfront_odd starts at 1, back_odd at number_odds (which for n=2 is 2). \n\nAlso, after all these steps, after each iteration, the pointers are incremented/decremented as needed. So the code should work as expected.\n\nPotential issues to debug in the code:\n\n- Division in Fortran for div is loop/2 \u2192 since loop is n, div =n/2, but uses integer division (for instance, if n is odd).\n\nSo for n=3 (odd), div=1 (as 3//2 is 1, yes).\n\nAnother test case, let's see n=3.\n\nSquare is 9. So odds are [1,3,5,7,9], evens [2,4,6,8].\n\nNumber of odds:5, evens 4. \n\nLoop is 3 (3 rows).\n\ndiv is 1 (3//2 \u21921.5 \u21921 if integer division).\n\nSo Row i=1 (odd):\n\nNeed to process j 1 to 1.\n\nProcess:\n\nFor j=1:\n\ni is odd \u2192 first pair.\n\nfront_odd is 1 \u2192 first number \u21921. front_odd now becomes 2.\n\nback_even is 4 (since even has four elements, and back_even starts at 4 (the fourth element?\n\nEven array is [2,4,6,8]. back_even is initialized to 4 \u2192 so references 8. \n\nnum2 = even(4)=8. back_even now 3.\n\nPrint 1 8.\n\nThen next pair (since j can go 1 to 1, so that's it. Then moves to next line.\n\nSecond line (i=2 even):\n\nj = 1 to 1:\n\nprocess:\n\neven case: take even's first element, from front_even (starting at 1 \u21922, front_even becomes 2. Then the odd back_odd (initially 5 (the fifth element in odds:9), so num2 is 9 \u2192 then back_odd becomes4.\n\nso the numbers would be 2 and 9. \n\nThird row (i=3, odd again):\n\nj runs 1 to 1.\n\ni odd so takes:\n\nfront_odd (2 \u2192 next is odds[2]=3 \u2192 front_odd becomes3.\n\n back_even is current back_even: after previous steps, when processing the first row: back_even became 3 (from 4 to 3). \n\nWait let's retrace for i=2 (even) \n\nIn second step (i even):\n\nnum2 is the odd's back. \n\nInitially after first row (i=1):\n\ni=1's process:\n\neven's back_even started at4 \u2192 after the step 4\u21923.\n\nSo in second step (i=2), when doing even case's second number (num2), the back_odd is still 5 (the odds array originally had back_odd =5). \n\nWait let's track pointers step-by-step for n=3 case.\n\nInitially:\n\nfront_odd =1, back_odd=5 (number_odds:5). \n\nfront_even=1, back_even=4 (number_evens=4).\n\nFirst row (i=1):\n\nj=1:\n\nodds's first is 1 \u2192 front_odd now 2.\n\nevens' last element is 8 (index4), so back_even now 3.\n\nso first pair: 1 8.\n\nAt end of this, odd array's front is at 2, back_odd remains 5 (since when it did the odd part, it didn't touch the odd's back). So the next step:\n\nSecond iteration (i=2, even):\n\nprocess the j=1 steps.\n\nfirst number: even front (1) \u2192 takes evens[1]=2 \u2192 front_even becomes 2.\n\nsecond number is odd's back: which is currently back_odd=5 (the 5th element is 9 \u2192 thus num2 is 9. back_odd becomes4 (5-1=4).\n\nThus printed here is \"2 9\".\n\nThird row (i=3, which is odd):\n\nprocess j from 1 to 1:\n\ncurrent pointers:\n\nfront_odd is at 2 (from i=1's processing), and after i=2, since that case did not affect odd's front or back except in when i is even, which only took back_odd.\n\nSo:\n\nfor i=3 (odd):\n\nthe num1 comes from front_odd=2 \u2192 which is 3 \u2192 front_odd becomes 3.\n\n num2 is even's back_even which is now 3 (from earlier back_even after first row: back_even=3).\n\n even's back_even is currently 3 \u2192 that's evens[3], which is6 (since even array is [2,4,6,8]. Even after removing 8 (first loop), then second loop that's back_even was 4 then 3. So back_even at first step's first j: started at 4, went down to 3 after first step. The second (i=2) step's processing for even's back:\n\nWait:\n\nLet me retrace the even's pointer for the second row:\n\nWait during first row, in i=1's processing after that first j=1:\n\nEven's back_even was 3.\n\nNow, when processing i=2, in even case (i even):\n\nthe code for even:\n\ntakes even's first (front_even: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 front_even becomes 2.\n\nthen the second number comes from odd's back (back_odd initially 5 \u2192 now, for the second step, the code does back_odd = back_odd -1 \u2192 yes, since:\n\nin the case of even i:\n\nthe second number (num2) is odd(back_odd), then back_odd -=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo after second row's process:\n\nfront_odd is increased to 2 \u2192 now, moving to 3 (from first row step, front was 2 \u2192 now after first row's processing, front_odd was 2. Then during second row, the even case does not touch the front_odd except when doing the even loop.\n\nThen, when third row (i=3) comes:\n\nfront_odd is at 3 (because first row's step 1incremented to 2, first step of third bot? Let's see:\n\nthird row:\n\ni=3 is odd:\n\nso:\n\nnum1 is odd[front_odd =2].\n\nWait, wait after first step (row 1):\n\nfront_odd became2.\n\nrow2 processing (even i=2) does not modify front_odd (because even case would only modify front_even and back_odd). So after processing for row 2:\n\nback_odd from row's processing:\n\nit started at5 \u2192 after taking 9: back_odd becomes 4.\n\nfront_odd remains at2.\n\n thus when processing row3 (i=3:\n\nfront_odd is2 \u2192 first element is odd[2] \u21923, then front_odd becomes3.\n\nSecond part: even's back_even.\n\n even's back_even after first row(i=1) step was 3 \u2192 but now for that?\n\nWait let's track even's back pointer:\n\nFirst step (i=1, j=1):\n\nback_even is 4 \u2192 after taking that \u2192 back_even becomes3.\n\nIn second step (i=2, even case) the code does not touch even's back via the even's processing. The num2 for even case comes from odd, so even's back is not modified during the even i's processing (except if processing the even's first element which uses front_even. \n\nBecause the even's first part:\n\nthe first element comes from front_even.\n\n So during row2's processing (i=2), the front_even was initially at 1 (before processing row2). \n\nIn row2:\n\neven's front is at 1 \u2192 taking its first element (2) \u2192 front_even becomes 2. \n\nThe even's back pointer isn't changed during that step, only the even's front. \n\nSo the even's back_even remains at 3 (from previous row's processing). \n\nThus, in third row (i=3, j=1):\n\nWe are in the loop for odd i\n\n takes front_odd (3 \u2192 which is third element of odds array: 5 ( since odd's elements are 1,3,5,7,9).\n\nWait the front_odd is at 2 (after row2's processing). So for row3 (i=3):\n\nnum1 is odd[front_odd=2 \u2192 element at 2 is 3. Then front_odd increases to3. \n\nWait, let's simulate step by step:\n\nProcessing row 3 (i=3):\n\nj=1:\n\ni is odd \u2192 process as i is odd.\n\ncurrent front_odd: after row1: front was 2. Then in row2's processing, front_odd wasn't changed. \n\nThus front_odd is 2? \n\nWait let's list the pointers step by step for n=3 example:\n\nInitial pointers:\n\nfront_odd=1, back_odd=5.\n\nfront_even=1, back_even=4.\n\nRow 1 (i=1):\n\n  j=1:\n\n   since i is odd,\n\n   num1 = odd[1] =1 \u2192 front_odd becomes 2.\n\n   num2 = even[4] =8 \u2192 back_even becomes3.\n\n So now after row1:\n\n front_odd=2,\n\n back_odd=5 (no change here),\n\n front_even is1 (no changes here yet),\n\n back_even is3 (from 4 \u2192 3).\n\nRow2 (i=2, even):\n\nj=1:\n\n   even case \u2192 \n\n   num1 is even[front_even =1 \u21922] \u2192 front_even becomes2.\n\n   num2 is odds[back_odd=5 \u21929 (odd array element 5 is9), \n\n then back_odd becomes4 (5-1).\n\n pointers after this step:\n\nfront_odd remains2.\n\nfront_even now is2.\n\n back_odd is4.\n\n back_even remains3 (since it wasn't touched here; this came from even).\n\n \n\nNow, row3 (i=3, odd):\n\nj=1:\n\ni is odd.\n\nSo, \n\nnum1 is odd[front_odd =2 \u21923 \u2192 front_odd becomes3.\n\nnum2 is even[ back_even=3 \u2192 which is even array's element3, which is 6 (since even array is [2,4,6,8].\n\nThus even element at back_even=3 is6 \u2192 back_even decreases to2.\n\nThus they are taken: 3 and6 \u2192 pair.\n\nSo the third row would output 3 6.\n\nThus the matrix (the lines are the 3 rows):\n\nRow1:1 8 \n\nRow2:2 9 \n\nRow3:3 6 \n\nWait but this only gives 2 numbers per line, since div is 1. So the lines would have 2 numbers (the loop over j from1 to1, so two numbers per row).\n\nWait for n=3, the loop is 3 columns (each row has n elements?), because for the initial code, when the matrix is n x n. The code's output prints n numbers per row (since each j loop does step div times, and each step produces 2 numbers, so total 2 * div = 2*(n/2) \u2192 n numbers per row).\n\nYes. \n\nThus for n=3, each row has 3 numbers. So in the above, the rows only 2 numbers. Hmm, what's wrong here.\n\nAh! Wait wait, this is a mistake I made. Let's look at the code steps again.\n\nWait for the div loop (div =1):\n\nso the inner loop runs j from 1 to div \u2192 but div is 1 for n=3. So the number of iterations per row is 1. Each iteration adds 2 numbers \u2192 2 numbers per row \u2192 but n is3. So perhaps there's an error here.\n\nWait n=3 is the loop is3. \n\nThe code's logic:\n\nloop is equal to n (since loop is set to square /n \u2192 n^2 / n =n).\n\ndiv = loop/2. So for n=3, that is 1.5, which in integer division would be 1 (since 3//2 is 1).\n\nEach j loop has div iterations \u2192 for n=3, div is1 \u2192 each row has 1*2 =2 numbers \u2192 but that gives only two numbers per line. Which would make the total numbers per row being 2, but n is 3 \u2192 that would be incorrect. So something's wrong.\n\nWait what's the issue here?\n\n looking at the java code: loop is n. div= n/2 \u2192 rounded down? \n\nYes, in Java loop is square/(n)=n. Then div = loop /2 \u2192 integer division, so (n)/2.\n\nThus for n=3 \u2192 div=1.\n\nSo per row, the j loop runs from0 to div-1 \u2192 0 to0 \u2192 one iteration, so two numbers \u2192 total 2 numbers per row \u2192 but for n=3, need 3 numbers per row. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh, that indicates a problem in the algorithm.\n\nWait let's look back at the code:\n\noriginal java code:\n\nthe inner loop was for (int j=0; j < div; j++).\n\nso for n=3 \u2192 div is 1 \u2192 j loops for 0 to0 \u21921 iteration \u2192 gives two numbers per line, but n=3. Thus how is that possible?\n\nWait perhaps there is an error in the code or my analysis?\n\nWait perhaps the code produces a different pattern.\n\nWait original problem statement: What was this code solving?\n\nThe code appears to generate a matrix of n x n where elements are arranged in some pattern with odds and evens.\n\nWait perhaps each row has two numbers per iteration of div's loop. For n=3, two numbers can't form rows of three elements. Thus there must be an error.\n\nWait perhaps I misunderstood the code's purpose. Let me re-express what the code does. \n\nWait the code's for loop:\n\nloop is n (number of rows?), and the inner loop over div. Each inner loop contributes 2 numbers, so total 2*div numbers per row. Since the(code may output n numbers per row. 2div =n \u2192 which requires that div =n/2.\n\nThus div= n/2 (exact division), requiring that n is even.\n\nBut in cases where n is odd, this would be a problem. Thus the algorithm likely has a mistake when n is odd?\n\nWait maybe the code is written for a specific problem where n must be divisible by 2? Or perhaps the code's logic is incorrect?\n\nWait looking back at problem code: \n\nthe code uses an ArrayList, then in the loops, for each j up to div:\n\ndiv is loop divided by 2 \u2192 loop is n. So div is n/2.\n\nWait perhaps the code actually uses loop is the number of elements per row? Not certain. Let me trace through the Java code for n=3.\n\nJava code for n=3:\n\nsq=9. \n\narraylists odds contains [1,3,5,7,9]; even contains [2,4,6,8].\n\nLoop is n =3. div is 3//2 \u21921.\n\nthe outer loop runs for i from 1 to3 (rows). The Inner loop runs j from 0 to0 (so 1 iteration each).\n\nSo each row has two numbers \u2192 total two numbers per line. But the required total numbers per row would be 3, so there is a problem.\n\nThis suggests that the code may have a mistake or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait wait no, perhaps the code does more than that.\n\nWait the code in the Java's main loop:\n\nIn the code, after the print of the two numbers, there is an extra space (due to the code having . . . + \" \" at the end of each .print line).\n\nAfter the two numbers, then a space, and after each j step, it's adding that pair and space \u2192 so perhaps each iteration of the loop (j loop) produces two numbers and an extra space, but then at the end after all inner loops, it does a line, so perhaps the final output ends with a space per line, but the code is supposed to write exactly n numbers, spaced with inbetween.\n\nWait for instance, in n=3, the row would contain two numbers (each j iteration gives two numbers], so the inner loop runs once (j=0 \u2192 two numbers per row \u2192 2 numbers, but then an extra space, but the problem may require them not to care about trailing space. However, with n=3, 2 numbers per row, that can't form n elements. So perhaps that implies code is incorrect?\n\nHmm this could be a problem with my initial reasoning, but perhaps I need to look back at the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the code in Java is correct, and my analysis for n=3 is wrong?\n\nWait the rows are the loop i which is from1 to loop=3, so rows 3.\n\neach row has 2*1= 2 numbers \u2192 but need 3 numbers per row. \n\nHmm, this discrepancy implies the code is only producing two numbers per row when n=3, but the output should requires three.\n\nPerhaps the mistake is in how the 'div is calculated. \n\nWait in the java code, div is loop divided by 2 \u2192 but is it correct to have two numbers per iteration and that divided multiplied by two equals n.\n\nBecause 2*(div)= n? div =n/2 \u2192 2*(n/2) =n.\n\nOK, yes.\n\nWait for n even: n=4 \u2192 div=2 \u2192 2*2=4.\n\nFor n odd, n=3 \u2192 2*div (div=1) =2 \u2192 but n=3. So discrepancy?\n\nAh so the code's approach requires that div is loop/2 \u2192 3/2 is 1.5 \u2192 but in java int division, it would be 1. So 2 * div is 2 \u2192 which is less then n.\n\nWhich means, the code may have a bug in the logic.\n\nWait perhaps in the Java code, there is a different logic.\n\nWait perhaps I'm missing a part of the code that ensures the outer loops cover?\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait in the java code, loop is square / n, which is n (n2 /n =n).\n\nThe code then runs the loops i from 1 to loop.\n\nSo, for n=3:\n\ntotal per row is 2 numbers per row: total in all 3 rows is 3*2=6 numbers. But the total numbers (n sequare is9) \u2192 this implies it's wrong.\n\nThus my conclusion must be wrong: the Java code is not writing correctly for n=3.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait wait maybe I got the code wrong.\n\nWait in the Java code, the code for the inner loop:\n\neach iteration of the inner lop (j) contributes two numbers. So the total numbers per row are 2* div, and the code's full runs ensures that the total number of elements printed equals n\u00b2.\n\ntotal numbers is n rows * (2*div)= n*(2*(n/2)) = n\u00b2. thus it works when n is even, but when n is odd:\n\ndiv = floor(n/2), 2 * div = n-1 \u2192 so per row 2*(n/2) is n-1, then, over n rows \u2192 n*(n-1) =n\u00b2-n \u2192 missing n elements.\n\nThus there is an error.\n\nAh, so this indicates that the code may not be correct, but given that the user provided this as code, I should stick to translating it as per the instructions, regardless of correctness.\n\nThus I need to proceed.\n\nIn Fortran, I will proceed with the code as above.\n\nThus the Fortran code is as follows:\n\nNow coding it.\n\n\u2014 Start with declaration of necessary variables.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, dynamic allocation is done with ALLOCATE.\n\n The code:\n\nprogram codeforces_334_A\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, square, loop, div\n\n   integer, allocatable :: odd(:), even(:)\n\n   integer :: i, j\n\n   integer :: front_odd, back_odd, front_even, back_even\n\n   integer :: count_odd, count_even, num1, num2\n\n   ! read n\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   square = n * n\n\n   loop = n\n\n   div = loop / 2\n\n   ! compute number of odds and evens\n\n   count_odds = (square + 1) / 2\n\n   count_evens = square / 2\n\n   allocate (odd(1:count_odds))\n\n   allocate (even(1:count_evens))\n\n   count_odd =0\n\n   count_even =0\n\n   ! fill the arrays\n\n   do i=1, square\n\n      if (mod(i,2) == 1) then\n\n         count_odd = count_odd +1\n\n         odd(count_odd) = i\n\n      else\n\n         count_even = count_even +1\n\n         even(count_even)=i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! initialize pointers\n\n   front_odd =1\n\n   back_odd = count_odds\n\n   front_even =1\n\n   back_even = count_evens\n\n   ! loop through rows\n\n   do i=1, loop ! rows are loop =n (since loop is n)\n\n      do j=1, div\n\n         if (mod(i,2)==1) then\n\n            ! i odd\n\n            num1 = odd(front_odd)\n\n            front_odd = front_odd +1\n\n            num2 = even(back_even)\n\n            back_even = back_even -1\n\n         else\n\n            ! i is even\n\n            num1 = even(front_even)\n\n            front_even = front_even +1\n\n            num2 = odd(back_odd)\n\n            back_odd = back_odd -1\n\n         end if\n\n         !

So the better way is to have between them a space:\n\nwrite(*,\"(i0,1x,i0)\", advance=\"no\") num1, num2\n\nWhich is:\n\nformat: integer followed by 1 space, then integer.\n\nThat way, each pair is printed with a space between.\n\nThus, in the code's inner loop:\n\n     if (mod(i,2)==1) then\n\n            ... get num1 and num2\n\n         else\n\n            ... \n\n      end if\n\n         write(*, '(i0,1x,i0)', advance='no') num1, num2\n\n      end do\n\n   after the inner loop, do new line. \n\nThis way, the pairs are separated by space, and the line ends with a newline. Also, the 'advance=\"no\" means that the new line is not added yet, so next writes are on the same line. \n\nThis should handle it correctly.\n\nTesting with example n=2: the pairs are 1 4 and the next... wait no, for n=2, the first row has one div (div=1) \u2192 j loops once, so produces two numbers (1 and4 \u2192 printed with a space \u2192 '1 4' \u2192 then new line. So first line is '1 4' followed by newline. Second row: '2 3' \u2192 newline. \n\nWhich would fit into a 2x2 matrix correctly.\n\nBut the Java code for n=2 would have the same output.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the code should be correct."
