    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads three lines of input. The first line is split into two words, I think probably because it's space-separated. Then the next line is tokenized with a StringTokenizer. Oh wait, but a StringTokenizer and split(\" \") might behave differently, but in this case, maybe the second line has two integers separated by space. So the second line is two integers a and b. Then the third line reads a string u. \n\nThe output is checking if u equals the first word from the first line. If yes, then subtract 1 from a, else subtract 1 from b. Then print a and b separated by a space. So the logic is: compare the third input string with the first part of the first line, adjust a or b accordingly.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about how to read input in Fortran. Since Fortran uses formatted and unformatted I/O, perhaps the best way is to read lines using read(*,*) for simple inputs, but sometimes you need to read from the stdin line by line. \n\nWait, first step: parse the first input line. In Java, it's split on spaces. So the first line has two strings: str[0] and str[1], but maybe in the problem, the first line is two words, like \"hello world\", so first word is str[0].\n\nNext, the second line has two integers. So in Fortran, using read(*,*) a,b should work, but need to ensure that.\n\nWait, but the second line uses a StringTokenizer, which is similar to split but maybe specifically for tokenizing. But in Java, using split and then get the tokens would be same as StringTokenizer in this case. So the second line's two values can be read directly as two integers.\n\nThird line is a single string. So the first line's two strings, then the second line gives a and b, and third is u.\n\nThen compare u with the first string from first line. So need to store the first word first.\n\nHmm, how to read the first line's two strings in Fortran? Let's see. In Fortran, if I allocate a character array to read the first line, then split it into two parts. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, using list-directed input. The first line as two words. But perhaps the first line can be read as two words, perhaps using a and r, but wait, the first line is string input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first line consisting of two strings (like two words separated by space) is stored in variables like s1 and s2. Since in Fortran, if the input is read as two strings separated by spaces, then read(*,*) s1, s2 should work. However, list directed I/O in Fortran may read until a space, so that should be okay. \n\nWait, so let me outline the steps in Fortran code:\n\n1. Read first line, which has two strings: s1 and s2 (the first word and second word). But in our logic, only the first string (s1) is relevant here, since we compare u to s1.\n\n2. Read the next line with two integers, a and b.\n\n3. Read the next line (the third line) as a string u.\n\n4. Compare if u is equal to s1. If yes, then subtract 1 from a, else subtract from b.\n\nWait a second, looking back to Java: in the output, the code does:\n\nSystem.out.println(u.equals(str[0]) ? (a - 1) + \" \" + b : a + \" \" + (b - 1));\n\nWait, note that either subtract 1 from a, and keep b as is, OR subtract 1 from b. \n\nWait, let me confirm the logic in Java. The first line's first word (str[0]) is compared to u. \n\nYes, so if they are equal, we have a-1 and b. Otherwise, we have a and b-1.\n\nSo now, in Fortran, after reading the three variables, need to perform the logic.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, variables. \n\nWe can use character variables for s1, s2 (from the first line), u (third line). \n\nThe lengths of the strings may be tricky. Since in Fortran, character variables have fixed length, unless using allocatable or the intrinsic len_trim function. Perhaps we can use a parameter, say 100, but in this case, the problem probably has short inputs. Alternatively, suppose that the first line's two words are each up to 10 characters. Alternatively, use the commented lengths as per need. But in a simple Fortran program, maybe just set a suitable size.\n\nSo let's define:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n\nBut need to read first line.\n\nThe first line's two strings can be read with read(*,*) s1, s2. But in FORTRAN list-directed I/O, the default delimiters are spaces, tabs, or newlines, so this would split at the first space, and read into s1 and s2. But perhaps if the strings have other characters like spaces but the problem's input is two words separated by space, this is okay. \n\nSecond line, the integers:\n\ninteger :: a, b\n\nread (*, *) a, b  // reads the second line.\n\nThird line: reading the entire line as a string u. Wait, the third line is a single string (u in code), so could read with read(*,'(a)') u  but how to read a single line.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread (*, '(a)') u // but perhaps in Fortran, the read statement can read the next line here. \n\nWait, but what if the third line may contain spaces or is a multi-word string? According to the Java code, the third line is just a single string. In Java, in.readLine() reads the entire line (until newline) as the third one. So in Fortran, should read the entire line, trimming any possible newline? Let's see. \n\nIn Java's third line, u is read with in.readLine(); which reads until the next newline (excluding the newline). So, in Fortran, to read an entire line (including spaces) we need to use an appropriate format. \n\nHence, for example, using a format like '(a1000)', but the length should be large enough. Alternatively, maybe just set the strings to be 255 or something. Since in the problem's example (like in an atcoder problem), the input lines are typically short. But assuming the problem's third line is a single string, but perhaps with spaces, but in the problem it may just be a single word. Hmm, the exact requirement?\n\nWait the original Java code for that third line uses in.readLine(), so whatever comes until the next newline is stored in u. So that entire line is stored, including possible trailing spaces? Or excluding the new line. \n\nSo in Fortran, the third line can be read with:\n\nread (*,'(a)') u\n\nBut the 'a' format in Fortran is up to the next line terminator. But since Fortran uses the default, perhaps trimming is needed if trailing spaces are an issue. Maybe in the code's comparison, leading and trailing spaces matter?\n\nBut in the problem, likely the third input line is a single word, so probably safe. So, let's proceed with that.\n\nNow the main logic: compare u to s1.\n\nBut in Fortran, when comparing strings, characters beyond the actual length can have spaces if the strings are of different lengths, so perhaps need to use the TRIM function.\n\nWait, in the code, suppose in Java:\n\nThe str[0] is the first token, but if the original line is \"aaa bbb\", str[0] is \"aaa\". The u is read as \"aaa\", then comparison is true. However, if in the Fortran code, s1 reads the first word (with leading/trailing space?), but in FORTRAN, when using list-directed read, the variables s1 and s2 would have the first two fields. But the line is read as \"aaa bbb\", then s1 is \"aaa\", s2 is \"bbb\".\n\nHowever, if the first line has leading or trailing spaces, but in the problem such cases may not be present. Assuming that the first line is two words separated by a single space, the read(*,*) would work.\n\nNow the u is the third line. So when we read it with read(*,*) would read until the first space, but that's wrong. Because the line may have multiple words. So hence in code the third line must be read as a whole.\n\nTherefore, better to read the third line as a whole, hence read(*,'(a100)') u, (with length 100), for any characters.\n\nWait, perhaps better read the first line as s1 and s2 via read statement with known format.\n\nAlternatively, make the variables a sufficient length. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead first line as two words, stored in s1 and s2:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1, s2, u\n\nThen read(*,*) s1, s2\n\nSecond line: read a and b.\n\nThird line: Read the entire third line (u) into a string variable.\n\nSo in Fortran, for reading entire third line, perhaps:\n\nthe correct way would be to use the '(a)' format but with a sufficient length. Wait, the following:\n\nread\u5355\u5143\uff08 *, ' (a200) ' ) u\n\nBut then u can have 200 characters. \n\nAssuming the maximum length requirements are okay. \n\nNow, once we have the variables, then compare u and s1.\n\nBut comparing the strings: need to be careful with trailing spaces. Because, in Fortran, character arrays are filled with spaces up to their full length. So, if s1 is 'abc' and has a length of 20, then it's 'abc' followed by 17 spaces. Similarly, u might be something else. So the comparison would require trimming the strings.\n\nSo comparing the strings should be done as TRIM(u) vs TRIM(s1). But the problem says that in the problem, perhaps leading or trailing spaces are not part of the input, but in code we can assume that the first line's s1 is exactly the string from the first word, and u is the entirety of the third line (trimmed? Or with any leading or trailing spaces?). \n\nThe code's Java code uses 'equals' which compares exactly. In the third line's input, in Java, if the line has leading or trailing spaces, those would be part of the u string. So the code may be trying to compare the entire string read in u with the first part of the first line, including any leading/trailing spaces.\n\nHmm, but in a typical programming contest problem (since the code is from atcoder ABC 154 A), probably the first line's two words are just two strings without spaces, and the third line is exactly one of them, so trimming may not be necessary. But for accurate translation, perhaps the Fortran code should compare the strings without trimming, but because of the space padding, this won't work. \n\nHence, to resolve the padding issue, we have to use the TRIM function. For instance:\n\nif ( trim(u) == trim(s1) ) then\n\nAlternatively, if the code requires exact length (including spaces), then this might be an issue. But since the problem is likely expecting the strings to be compared character by character (excluding leading/trailing spaces), using TRIM is better. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow the calculation part:\n\nIf u equals s1 (after trimming?), then compute a-1 and b, else a and b-1.\n\nThen output the two numbers separated by a space. \n\nIn Fortran, the print statement can be:\n\nif (condition) then\n\nprint *, a-1, b\n\nelse\n\nprint *, a, b-1\n\nend if\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe code would look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC154_A\n\n  character(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n  integer :: a, b\n\n  read(*,*) s1, s2\n  read(*,*) a, b\n  read(*, '(a)') u  ! Or using trim here, maybe read( *, '(a100)') u\n\n  ! Trim needed\n  if ( trim(u) == trim(s1) ) then\n     print '(i0, 1x, i0)', a-1, b\n  else\n     print '(i0, 1x, i0)', a, b-1\n  end if\n\nend program atcoder_ABC154_A\n\nWait, but in the reads, let's think again. First line: when using read *, s1, s2, in list-directed format, if the line is \"happy birthday\", then s1 gets \"happy\", s2 gets \"birthday\". \n\nSecond line: a and b are read normally. \n\nThird line: The entire line is read into u with the \"(a100)\" format. \n\nWait, in Fortran, to read the entire third line (including any characters except the newline) into u, perhaps the simplest way is to use the '(a)' format but with a suitable length. For variable u with length 200, then read(*,'(a200)') u  \u2014 but the problem is that Fortran has different ways to handle string input.\n\nAlternatively, since the third line is read via read(*,*) would stop at the first space. For instance, if the third line is \"hello world\", then read(*,*) u would read \"hello\" into s1? No, but in this case, u would get \"hello\", whereas we want the entire string. \n\nHence, the third read must read the entire line, so unless there are other constraints, the correct format is to read with an implied-do construct or a sufficient character length. \n\nWait, let me think about the read(*,'(a100)') u statement. That will read the next 100 characters (or to the end of the line, not sure). \n\nActually, the a100 format specifier in a read statement (for input) will read up to 100 characters, without trimming. The problem here is, when the third line is shorter than 100 characters, the remaining characters in u will be padded with spaces. So, for example, if u is exactly \"hello\", then the u's content is \"hello\" followed by 95 spaces. Comparing trim(u) would get \"hello\", but comparing with s1(which may also have trailing spaces) would need to be handled via trim.\n\nAlternatively, using list directed read for the third line would read until the first blank, but the third line may consist of multiple words. However according to the original Java code, the third line is read with in.readLine(), which reads entire line. So if the problem requires that third line is a single string, even if contains spaces, then list directed is bad.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to read the third line as a single string (the entire line) using a formatted read with a format that can capture all characters of the line.\n\nThus:\n\nread (*, '(a)') u \n\nWait but the 'a' format requires a fixed length? No, actually Fortran 2008 has a non-standard support, but maybe older standards have this differently.\n\nAlternatively, find the length of the line. Wait, perhaps the safest way for this problem is to use a sufficiently large character length. \n\nLet me define u as having len=100, then using a format of '(a100)'\n\nSo the third line can be read as:\n\nread(*, '(a100)') u \n\nthat would read up to 100 characters (the entire line if it's less than 100). \n\nSo in code, the variables:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n\nNow, read first line: read *, s1, s2  \u2192 assuming the first line is two words. \n\nSecond line: read *, a, b \u2192 easy.\n\nThird line: read '(a100)' \u2192 the entire line is stored into u, up to 100 chars. \n\nThen the comparison:\n\ncompare trim(u) to trim(s1). \n\nThus, code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC154_A\n\n  implicit none\n  character(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n  integer :: a, b\n\n  ! Read first line\n  read(*,*) s1, s2\n\n  ! Read second line (a and b)\n  read(*,*) a, b\n\n  ! Read third line into u (entire line)\n  read(*,'(a100)') u \n\n  if ( trim(u) == trim(s1) ) then\n    print *, a-1, b\n  else\n    print *, a, b-1\n  end if\n\nend program\n\nWait, but the print statements in fortran may use default format. Using * will format with spaces, which is okay. \n\nHmm, let me test this with a sample input. Let's see.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nJapan z $98\n\nWait, perhaps actual example from the problem.\n\nSuppose the first input line is \"apple orange\", second line \"5 3\", third line \"apple\".\n\nThen in code s1 would be \"apple \", but since read *, s1, s2 would have \"apple\" and \"orange\" as strings (assuming no trailing space in first line). Wait, actually, when reading with list input, the trailing spaces are omitted? Or are they stored as part of the variable's string?\n\nWait no. Let me clarify. Let's say the first line input is \"a b\" \n\nWhen I read using read(*,*) s1, s2\n\ns1 will be \"a\" (no space), a character of whatever their length is, but contains the exact content. The variables are list-directed, so leading/trailing space are removed. Wait, no, the list-directed read into character variables will read until the delimiters (spaces, ACSII) with any leading spaces skipped. \n\nWait, in Fortran, for list directed input to a character variable, the input is read as a single \"value\", skipping any leading spaces. \n\nSo for the first line \"apple orange\" \u2192 s1 is 'apple', s2 'orange'\n\nIf the third line is 'apple', then trim(u) equals 'apple' (since it was read as 'apple', with space up to the length filled with space? Wait, the third line is read with read (*,'(a100)') u \u2192 reads the input line, which is, for \"apple\", then u is \"apple\" followed by 95 spaces.\n\nThus, trim(u) = 'apple', trim(s1) is \"apple\" (since s1 is read as 'apple' and stored in a length 100 variable, the rest filled with spaces). So trim(s1) would also be 'apple' \u2192 the comparison is true. \n\nAnother example: Third line is \" apple \" \u2192 then trim(u) would be 'apple' again (if s1 was 'apple', so comparison may see they match). But in the original Java code, in.readLine() would capture \" apple \" exactly (including spaces). But in the problem's logic, perhaps the inputs are such that the third line's exact value matters. So is this an issue?\n\nIf the original program's first line is \"apple orange\", but the user types \" apple \" (with spaces), then the Java code's u would contain \" apple \" (presumably leading and trailing spaces), and since s[0] is \"apple\", the comparison would fail in Java, but in Fortran's code, when comparing trimmed versions, they would be equal, leading to different outputs.\n\nHence the requirement could vary, but for programming competition problems like AtCoder, typically such problems have the first line's first token be exactly the string to compare with the third line's content, implying that the third line has no leading/trailing spaces, so trimming is okay.\n\nHence, the code is correct with the trim.\n\nWait, the user's Java code compares u with str[0]. So str is the first line split on space. So the first word is exactly the first token. For example:\n\nFirst line is \"  hello  world  \" \u2192 puts \"hello\" as str[0]. The third line's input may be \"he\" \u2192 so comparing to str[0] would be \"hello\" vs \"he\"? \u2192 no, but in the problem, presumably the third line is exactly one of them. Let's suppose the problem's constraints are that the first line has two words, and third is exactly one of them as input. \n\nHence, the trimming approach is correct.\n\nNow, perhaps the format for printing?\n\nThe output in Java is using string concatenation. In Fortran, the print *, a-1, b would output the numbers separated by one space, which is what needed.\n\nAlternatively, the code could also explicitly format to avoid any leading or trailing space issues. For example, using '(i0,1x,i0)'.\n\nHence, to make it precise, perhaps:\n\nprint '(i0, 1x, i0)', a-1, b\n\nBut in the original Java code, it is \" (a-1) + \" \" + b \", which is exactly two numbers separated by space. \n\nIn Fortran, the comma in print *, will do that, as using * is list directed with free formatting. Since integers are printed as default formatted, separated by blanks.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible pitfall is the fact that the third input line's newline character. The third read with 'a100' will read that line's characters, including any until the LF or CRLF? \n\nIn Fortran, the a100 format reads data until the record ends (i.e., the end of line), which is correct. Trailing newlines are stored as part of the record? No, newlines are the delimiters. \n\nHence the code should read exactly what is needed.\n\nWait another possible point: the second line in Java is parsed using a StringTokenizer from the InputStreamReader. Maybe there are cases with leading or trailing spaces? \n\nThe Java code uses:\n\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n\nThe StringTokenizer is initialized with that line. By default, StringTokenizer splits by any whitespace and ignores empty tokens. So if that line is a spaces, but it's an input line for two numbers, then that line could have e.g., \"3   5\" and it's split into two tokens. So the Fortran code's read(*, *) a, b is same.\n\nHence, except for any possible number of trailing spaces, that isn't an issue here.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nLet me write the final Fortran code:\n\n```fortran\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  character(len=100) :: s1, s2, u\n  integer :: a, b\n\n  ! Read the first line\n  read(*,*) s1, s2\n  ! Read the second line (a and b)\n  read(*,*) a, b\n  ! Read the third line\n  read(*,'(a100)') u\n\n  if (trim(u) == trim(s1)) then\n    print *, a-1, b\n  else\n    print *, a, b-1\n  end if\n\nend program main\n```\n\nWait, the program name can be anything? The original Java class was atcoder_ABC154_A. But the name in Fortran is not crucial as long as the executable is correct. \n\nHowever, perhaps better to include the actual name if desired, but the problem just requires functionality. \n\nAlternatively, the exact program name could be given, but for the translation, the code above is okay.\n\nWait, in my first code draft, I used the program name \"atcoder_ABC154_A\", but here it's \"main\". That's okay. Let's make the program name as in the code's original (if possible). However, atcoder allows programs to have any name, as long as they output correctly. \n\nThus, the code should be correct."
