    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers a, b, c. Then, it checks if at least two of them are 1. If so, it increments a counter. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nSo, the Fortran version should do the same. Let me think about how to structure this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses read and write statements. The input handling in Java uses a Scanner, but in Fortran, I'll read from standard input. The loop will run t times, where t is the first input.\n\nWait, in Java, the first input is t (the number of test cases). Then for each test case, three integers are read. \n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the integer t.\n2. Initialize count to 0.\n3. Loop t times:\n   a. Read a, b, c.\n   b. Check if any two or all three of a, b, c are 1.\n   c. If yes, increment count.\n4. After all test cases, print count.\n\nHmm, the condition in Java is checking if at least two of the variables are 1. The original condition includes all combinations where two or all three are 1. Let me see the original condition:\n\n(a == 1 && b == 1) || (a ==1 && c ==1) || (b ==1 && c ==1) || (a==1 && b==1 && c==1)\n\nAlternatively, this can be simplified. Since if all three are 1, then any two pairs would already satisfy the condition. Therefore, maybe it can be written as \"at least two are 1\". However, the existing condition covers that. But perhaps in Fortran, I can compute this condition more elegantly. But maybe it's easier to directly translate the condition.\n\nAlternatively, count how many of a, b, c are 1. Then, if the count is >=2, then increment.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. So maybe in Fortran code:\n\nCompute the number of ones among a, b, c. Let that be 'sum' or 'nones'.\n\nnones = (a == 1) + (b ==1) + (c ==1)\n\nsince in Fortran, logical expressions can be converted to integers (True=1, False=0). Wait, actually in Fortran, when you use a logical in arithmetic context, .TRUE. is 1, .FALSE. is 0. So the sum can be done as:\n\nnones = (a .eq. 1) + (b .eq. 1) + (c .eq. 1)\n\nThen, if nones >= 2, increment count.\n\nThis would be a better and concise way of handling the condition. Let me see the original Java condition: it also includes the case when all three are 1. So the sum would be 3, which is >=2, so yes.\n\nTherefore, this approach is equivalent, perhaps more efficient.\n\nSo, code steps for each test case:\n\nread a, b, c.\n\nsum = (a ==1) + (b==1) + (c==1)\n\nif sum >= 2 then count=count+1\n\nThis way, no need for all those ORs. So this is better.\n\nSo, now how to write this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, declaring variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. So, let's see:\n\nimplicit none (better to use this to enforce declarations)\n\ninteger :: t, count, a, b, c, nones\n\nThen read t from input. In Fortran, that would be:\n\nread(*,*) t\n\nThen, count =0\n\nloop over i from 1 to t:\n\ndo i =1, t\n\nthen inside loop:\n\nread *, a, b, c\n\ncompute nones = (a.eq.1) + (b.eq.1) + (c.eq.1)\n\nequivalent in Fortran: \n\nnones = (a ==1) + (b ==1) + (c ==1)\n\nWait, Fortran uses .eq. for equality in expressions, or can also use == ?\n\nIn Fortran 90 and later, == is equivalent to .eq.. So either is acceptable. Let's use .eq. since it's more standard.\n\nWait, in expressions, if you have variables a, then in the code:\n\nnones = (a .eq. 1) \n\neach of these terms is a logical variable, but when added, they become integers 1 or 0. Because in Fortran, when you add a logical to another, they get converted to integers. So yes.\n\nalternatively, maybe use \"merge(1,0, a==1)\" but the way I thought is better.\n\nSo, nones will be the count of 1's in a, b, c.\n\nThen, if nones >=2, then count=count+1.\n\nSo, read a, b, c each time.\n\nAfter all loops, print count.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nStructure of program:\n\nprogram codeforces_231_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t, count, a, b, c, nones\n\nread(*,*) t\n\ncount=0\n\ndo i=1, t\n\n    read(*,*) a, b, c\n\n    ! compute nones\n\n    nones = (a .eq. 1) + (b .eq.1 ) + (c .eq. 1)\n\n    if ( nones >= 2 ) then\n\n        count = count +1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) count\n\nend program\n\nWait, but wait: what if the loop variable i isn't declared?\n\nYes, so variables i is needed here. Need to declare it.\n\nAh, right. In the loop, I need an index variable, so need to include 'integer :: i' in the variable declarations.\n\nSo the variable declarations should include 'i'.\n\nThus, the code will be:\n\nprogram codeforces_231_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: t, count, a, b, c, nones, i\n\n  read(*,*) t\n\n  count = 0\n\n  do i =1, t\n\n    read(*,*) a, b, c\n\n    nones = 0\n\n    ! alternative approach, but better way using sum:\n\n    nones = (a ==1) + (b ==1) + (c ==1)\n\n    if ( nones >= 2 ) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n    end if\n\n  end do\n\n  write(*,*) count\n\nend program codeforces_231_A\n\nWait, in Fortran, using '==' is okay, I think.\n\nWait, but perhaps better to use the Fortran operators like .eqv. but in this case, for equality with 1, it's integer comparison, so .eq. is correct. Because 1 is integer.\n\nSo (a .eq. 1 ) is a logical, true or false, which when added gives 1 or 0.\n\nSo yes. Therefore, the code above should work.\n\nAlternatively, for clarity, perhaps using:\n\nnones = 0\n\nif (a ==1) nones = nones +1\n\nif (b ==1) nones = nones +1\n\nif (c ==1) nones = nones +1\n\nmaybe that's clearer for some people, but the one-liner should be okay.\n\nWait but in Fortran, (a ==1) is a logical, which when used in arithmetic context is treated as 1 for true, 0 for false. So the original nones = (a.eq.1)+(b.eq.1)+(c.eq.1) is correct.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nTesting edge cases: For example, when two variables are 1, nones is 2 \u2192 count. When all three are 1, nones is 3 \u2192 count. If only one, then nones 1 \u2192 no count. So that matches the original condition.\n\nNow, what about data types?\n\nAll variables here are integers, so no problem.\n\nThe initial code in Java uses Scanner, but in Fortran, the input is read via read(*,*) which reads from stdin, and expects the numbers to be in free format. So that should be okay assuming the input is given in the same way. The Fortran code uses free source form, which is standard in modern Fortran.\n\nThe program should be written in free format, with line continuation if necessary, but in this case, all lines are okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: in Fortran, the loop 'do i=1,n' when n=0 will not execute. Which is okay, because in the problem, t is the number of test cases, which presumably is non-negative. The code would handle t=0, but according to problem's input, probably t is at least 1, but code can handle correctly.\n\nTesting this code, it should work as the Java version.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would be as written above.\n\nWait the variable nones can be declared inside the loop, but in Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable statements, so since it's inside the loop, in the current code, it's declared in the main variables. But the way the current code is written, it's okay.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps re-initialize nones each time inside the loop but since the variable is computed each time, it's okay.\n\nSo the code seems correct."
