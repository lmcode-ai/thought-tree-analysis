    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem is about checking whether it's possible to reach exactly 'n' using some combination where the number of terms from two coefficients a and b satisfy certain conditions. \n\nFirst, I'll go through the Java code step by step to make sure I understand the logic.\n\nThe code reads inputs for multiple test cases. For each test case:\n- It reads n, a, b.\n- If n < a, then it's immediately \"No\".\n- If a equals b, then it checks if n is divisible by a. If so, \"Yes\"; else \"No\".\n- Otherwise, it calculates x = b/(b - a). But wait, this division is integer division inJava, so since a and b are different here, we'll need to see how that translates in Fortran's integer division.\n\nThen there's a check: if n > x * a, then output \"Yes\" and skip further steps. Otherwise, proceed to the binary search part.\n\nThen there's a binary search between low and high (starting at 1 and x +1?), finding the minimal 'ans' such that ... Hmm, perhaps the code is finding the minimum k where k*a >= n? Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the binary search loop:\nThey initialize low =1, high= x+1. The loop continues while low <= high. The mid is computed, and depending on whether mid*a <n, they adjust low and high. The 'ans' is supposed to track something. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code is looking for the minimal mid where mid*a >= n? Because initially, ans is set to 1. Then when mid*a <n, they set low=mid+1. Otherwise, they set ans to mid and high to mid-1. \n\nWait, the binary search here is trying to find the minimum mid such that mid*a >=n. Because when the mid*a is less than n, we need to go higher, so increasing low. But the ans gets updated to mid each time the condition is not met (when the mid*a isn't less than n). \n\nOnce found ans, the code checks whether n is between (ans -1)*b and ans*a. If yes, then \"No\", else \"Yes\". \n\nWait, the condition is: if n > (ans -1)*b and n < ans*a \u2192 \"No\", else \"Yes\". Let me recap.\n\nThe logic seems to be:\n\nAfter handling cases where a equals b, then when a\u2260b:\n\nIf n is larger than (x)*a, then output \"Yes\". But if not, then after computing ans (the minimal mid where mid*a >=n), we check if n is in between (ans-1)*b and ans*a \u2192 which would mean it can't be formed, so \"No\".\n\nHmm, I need to translate that code accurately into Fortran.\n\nFirst, note that in Fortran, the input/output is different. The code uses Scanner and PrintWriter in Java, so in Fortran, I'll probably read from stdin and write to stdout, using internal functions.\n\nVariables: The Java code uses long for everything. Fortran uses integers, so perhaps using integer*8 or the appropriate kind for large numbers. Let me see the constraints. Since a can be up to 1e9 perhaps, so using 64-bit integers (INT64) in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, we'll define variables with parameters (such as MOD is 1e9 +7). But in the code, MOD isn't used. Wait, in the Java code, MOD is a static variable, but it's only used in that. Wait, looking at code:\n\nWait in the code, the MOD variable is declared but not used. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the code is named codeforces_387_B, perhaps it's problem B from a Codeforces contest. The code does some mathematical comparison. The MOD might have been a leftover from previous attempts, as MOD isn't referenced elsewhere. So I can ignore that in the translation.\n\nNow, starting the Fortran code: functions are in the main program. Let's start coding.\n\nFirst, variables in Java are declared with type. In Fortran, variables need to be declared with types. Since the variables a, b, etc, can be up to large numbers (like 1e9), they need to be 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, we can use integer (kind=8) (assuming 8 is the kind for 64-bit, which is typical).\n\nFirst, the program:\n\nprogram codeforces_397_B\n   implicit none\n   integer(kind=8) :: t, n, a, b, low, high, mid, ans, x\n   logical :: condition\n   integer :: iostatus\n\nBut perhaps better to handle variables step by step.\n\nIn Fortran, loops are often handled with DO loops, and the same condition structure as Java.\n\nFirst, the main loop reads t test cases.\n\nWait, the first line in main() is:\n\nScanner in = new Scanner(System.in); PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\nIn Fortran, we can read from the standard input, maybe using read(*,*) statements.\n\nSo the main outline would be:\n\nRead t.\n\nLoop over t test cases:\n\n   read *, n, a, b\n\n(Note that in the Java code, in the while loop:\n\npublic static void main(){\n\n    Scanner...\n\n    t = in.nextInt();\n\n    while (t-->0) {\n\n        then read n, a, b.\n\nSo in the loop, for each case, read the three numbers. But the code is in the loop: So for Fortran:\n\ndo while (t >0)\n\n   t = t -1\n\n   read *, n, a, b\n\nSo each test case is processed in a loop.\n\nLet me Sketch the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nimplicit none  ! Requiring explicit variables\n\nLater, define all variables.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- t (number of test cases) as integer (since test case counts are small)\n\n- n, a, b as integer(kind=8). \n\nIn the code variables: x is also a long.\n\nlow, high, mid, ans also long.\n\nAlso, the program would write \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nThe code structure:\n\nRead t.\n\nloop over t times:\n\nread n, a, b.\n\nCheck if n <a \u2192 print 'No', next case.\n\nElse if a == b \u2192 then check (n mod a ==0 ) \u2192 yes or no.\n\nElse:\n\nx = b/(b - a). But in Fortran, when doing integer division, need to take care. Since in Java, division of integers is integer division that truncates towards zero. Since b and (b -a) are variables here. Let me see: In the case when a < b, since a and b are positive?\n\nWait, the code's condition when a !=b. For example, when a < b, but when a > b we need to be careful. Let me see:\n\nWait in the original code, when a and b are different, there's a line: x = b/(b - a). Let me think: if a < b, then denominator is positive. But if a > b, then denominator is negative. For example, if a=3, b=2, then denominator is -1 \u2192 b/(b -a)= 2/-1 = -2 (in integer division). So that would be a negative x, but perhaps the code can handle that?\n\nWait in the code's next step: if (n >x*a). Suppose x is negative, then x*a could be very negative. So perhaps in cases where denominator is negative (a >b), maybe the code would process that differently? Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way, but perhaps the code expects certain input parameters.\n\nWait maybe the constraints in the problem are such that inputs a and b are in certain ranges. For example, possibly a and b are positive integers, and the problem requires that the answer is possible under some conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the translation as-is without worrying about the logic.\n\nNow, the x = calculation: in Java, division of longs. In Fortran, use integer division. But need to see the exact calculation. Since it's truncating towards zero?\n\nFor example in Fortran, a/b is integer division where the result is the floor towards zero. So the same as in Java.\n\nNext, the code checks if n > x*a \u2192 if yes, then output yes. Otherwise, do the binary search.\n\nMoving to variables in code.\n\nAnother part: in the binary search:\n\nInitialize low=1, high=x+1. The high is set to x+1. Then the loop runs until low > high. The initial setup.\n\nThe binary search part is finding the minimal ans such that ans*a >= n.\n\nWait, in the code, the ans is initialized to 1. Then, when mid*a < n \u2192 set low to mid+1, but only when mid*a <n, else you set high to mid\u22121 and update ans to mid. This suggests that ans is set to the current best (smallest) value where mid*a is >=n.\n\nEventually, the ans will end up as the smallest integer where ans *a >=n.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nLet me see the binary search steps:\n\nExample, let\u2019s say low=1, high= 10, let's see how it proceeds.\n\nSuppose n is 7, a is 3.\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nFirst mid is (1+10)/2=5. 5*3=15>=7 \u2192 so ans is 5, high =4.\n\nNext: low=1, high=4 \u2192 mid= (2.5) \u2192 3. So 2nd mid is (1+4)= 5/2 \u2192 2.5, round down to 2 or 3? Wait in Fortran, integer division: (low + high)/2 would be integer division. Let me think:\n\nSuppose mid is (low+high)/2 \u2192 in Fortran, the division is integer, so mid will be rounded down?\n\nYes, in Fortran integer division, (low + high)/2 is (sum) divided by two, integer division. So if low+high is odd, will truncate.\n\nBack to example, mid between 1-4: (1+4)=5, divided by 2 \u2192 2 (since 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 truncates to 2).\n\nSo mid is 2. Check 2 * a: 6 <7 \u2192 so we need to go higher. So set low=mid+1 = 3.\n\nNow, low=3, high is 4.\n\nmid =3+4=2 \u2192 7/2=3.5 \u2192 floor is 3.\n\nmid=3. 3*3 =9 \u22657 \u2192 so set ans to 3, set high=2 (mid-1=2). Now loop exits?\n\nBecause now low (3) is greater than high (2). \n\nSo the final ans is 3, which is the correct minimal k where k*a >=n (since 3*3 is first greater than 7).\n\nOkay, so the binary search works like this.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing ans, the check is:\n\nIf (n > (ans-1)*b and n < ans * a) \u2192 \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\nWait, that's the condition written as: if n is strictly between (ans-1)*b and ans*a, then output \"No\".\n\nSo how is that condition determined?\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that after the minimal k (ans) which is the first k where k*a \u2265n, the regions between (k-1)*a and k*a would have possible solutions, but when a and b are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when a and b are not equal, we can model possible reachable numbers as sequences?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula or the approach here that requires the point lies outside the interval between (ans-1)*b and ans*a gives a 'No' since it can't be formed.\n\nNow, moving to translation.\n\nLet's start writing.\n\nIn Fortran, the program would have:\n\nprogram codeforces_397_B\n   implicit none\n   integer(kind=8) :: n, a, b, low, high, mid, ans, x\n   integer :: t, i\n   character(len=3) :: result  ! To hold \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n\n   read(*,*) t\n   do i=1,t\n       read(*,*) n, a, b\n       if (n < a) then\n           result = 'No'\n       else if (a == b) then\n           if (mod(n,a) == 0) then\n               result = 'Yes'\n           else\n               result = 'No'\n           end if\n       else\n           x = b/(b - a)  ! integer division, truncates towards zero\n           if (n > x * a) then\n               result = 'Yes'\n           else\n               low = 1\n               high = x +1\n               ans =1\n               do while (low <= high)\n                   mid = (low + high) / 2   ! integer division here\n                   if (mid * a < n) then\n                       low = mid +1\n                   else\n                       ans = mid\n                       high = mid -1\n                   end if\n               end do\n               ! Now check if n is outside the interval (ans-1)*b and ans*a\n               ! The condition written: (n > (ans-1)*b) .AND. (n < ans*a)\n               if ( (n > (ans-1)*b) .AND. (n < ans *a) ) then\n                   result = 'No'\n               else\n                   result = 'Yes'\n               end if\n           end if\n       end if\n       write(*,*) trim(result)\n   end do\nend program codeforces_397_B\n\nWait, let's check if variables are correctly declared. \n\nIn the problem, the variables a, b, etc. are declared as long in Java, so in Fortran their declarations as integer(kind=8) should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the loop over the test cases, the variables are read inside each iteration, so declaring them inside would cause them to be reinitialized each time. Since they are in the main program, they should be declared at the top.\n\nWait, in my outline above, all variables are inside the program, which means that variables n, a, b, etc. are in the main program's scope, so each iteration would not reset them unless done so. Since we read inside each loop iteration, that should be okay.\n\nWait, let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is a while(t-- >0). In my translation, I used a do loop from 1 to t. So in that code, for each i, it reads the inputs.\n\nI have to make sure after each test case, variables like x, low, etc. can be reinitialized properly each time, but that's handled by the code path.\n\nWait in the code, after reading a and b, the checks proceed.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Fortran, the module MOD(n,a) gives the remainder when n is divided by a. But we need to ensure that mod(n,a) is indeed 0 for when division is possible. For example, if the code says mod(7,3)=1, so not divisible. So yes, mod is okay.\n\nNow, the x = b/(b-a) calculation. Suppose in cases where (b -a) is negative. Let's say b=2 and a=3, so b -a =-1 \u2192 x =2 / (-1) \u2192 -2 (since division in Fortran truncates towards zero, so 2/-1 is -2).\n\nThen x*a would be -2 *3 =-6. The next 'if' check is if (n> x*a), then yes.\n\nSuppose n is 5. Since 5 is larger than -6 (since n is positive), then we'll output 'Yes'. Which may be the case, but maybe this is a valid scenario.\n\nWait according to the original problem logic, when a and b are different.\n\nLet me think of an example scenario.\n\nExample:\n\nTest Case:\n\nn=5, a=3 (so a=3, b=2. Since a != b.\n\nSo x =b/(b-a) \u2192 2/(2-3)= 2/(-1)= -2 (integer division).\n\nThen check if n> x*a \u2192 5 > (-2)*3 \u2192 -6 \u2192 yes. 5 is greater, so output 'Yes'.\n\nTherefore, the code in Java would output yes here.\n\nBut what does that mean?\n\nWait, the problem is about n being achievable via some combination? But the logic might have some underlying problem. However since this is just a code translation exercise, unless the code is obviously wrong (but it's from Codeforces possibly?), perhaps it's correct.\n\nWell, proceeding with translation.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the binary search for ans, the variables like mid must be of integer(kind=8), but in the current code, all variables (low, high, mid, ans) are integer*8.\n\nWait in my code outline above, the variables are declared as:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: n, a, b, low, high, mid, ans, x\n\nBecause in variables like mid = (low + high)/2 \u2192 low and high can be up to x+1, which when x can be up to, say, n which can be large.\n\nWait, but in the case where x is very large, but high is set to x+1 which could be very big. But in terms of storage, as long as variables are in 64 bits, it's okay.\n\nAnother check: the result variable is a character array of length 3. The 'Yes' and 'No' strings. Since 'Yes' is 3 characters and 'No' is also 3, with the spaces?\n\nWait, no, 'Yes' is three letters, 'No' is two letters. So: 'Yes' is 3, 'No' is 3? No, 'No' is two, but perhaps to avoid issues, I can set the character length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, just write as 'Yes' with 3, but when 'No' is written, it's only 2, but with a space, or maybe using ' ' to pad it? But in Fortran, the trim function should handle the trailing space.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you write:\n\nresult = 'No'\nthen trim(result) would be 'No ' (since the length is 3), but using trim to remove trailing spaces.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nresult is 3 characters. When you write 'Yes', it's exactly 3 characters. When you write 'No', it's two characters, so stored as 'No ' (assuming we have to have 3 characters). So when you output with trim, it will write 'No' without the space. So better to set:\n\nresult = 'No  ' (with two spaces?) no, since it's a length 3 string.\n\nWait better to set result as 3 chars:\n\nFor 'Yes', the string is \"Yes\".\n\nFor 'No', need two characters. So perhaps, when setting as 'No', it would leave two spaces? Or perhaps using 'No ' with a space at end?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps use a single character string and avoid the problem. Alternatively, just ensure that when writing, it is printed without trailing spaces by trimming.\n\nThe statement is:\n\nwrite(*,*) trim(result)\n\nWhich will remove any trailing spaces, so whether it's 'Yes' (3 characters) or 'No' (2 with one space, trimming gives 'No').\n\nWait:\n\nresult is a string of length 3. For 'No', assign as 'No', but actually in Fortran when you do \u2018No\u2019 = string of length 3, you would have 'No ' (since two chars, so third is a space).\n\nSo ' Yes' and 'No\u5de5\u7a0b\u65bd\u5de5' (whatever) \u2192 but when you use trim(result), it will remove the trailing space, so 'No' will appear correctly.\n\nYes, so the write statement is okay with trim.\n\nNow, let me check the code again for possible issues.\n\nThe initial code after declaring variables: the loop is over i from 1 to t. Each test case is evaluated.\n\nWait, in the else clause when a \u2260 b:\n\nThe code first checks if n >x*a \u2192 if yes, then \"Yes\", else do the rest.\n\nNow, x is computed as b/(b -a).\n\nLet me check what is the purpose of x.\n\nSuppose, for example:\n\na = 2, b =3 \u2192 b -a =1 \u2192 so x = 3/1 =3.\n\nThen x*a is 6.\n\nIf n is 7, then n >6 (6 would be 3*2), so 7 would get 'Yes'.\n\nMeaning that the condition holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this x is the value where the 'worst case' threshold is.\n\nAnother thing: in the else part (when a\u2260b), the 'No' case after binary search is when n is sandwiched between (ans-1)*b and ans*a.\n\nWait the condition is written as:\n\nif (n > (ans-1)*b and n < ans*a) \u2192 which in Fortran is .AND. between the two.\n\nWait, wait the code in Java uses:\n\nif (n > (ans -1)*b && n < ans*a ) \u2192 so if both conditions hold \u2192 \"No\".\n\nElse \u2192 \"Yes\".\n\nThe Fortran code should mirror that exact condition.\n\nLet me now check the code for possible integer overflows.\n\nVariables in Fortran declared as integer(kind=8) should handle 64-bit numbers (up to ~1e18), so unless inputs are beyond that, which is unlikely since a n, a, b can be up to, say, 1e9, leading to products like 1e9 *1e9 \u2192 1e18, which is exactly what 64 bits can hold (since 2^63 is about 9e18 so just barely).\n\nIf in a case where variables exceed 64 bits, but per the problem constraints maybe it's okay.\n\nOther potential issues: the initial conditions.\n\nWait in the code's first check:\n\nif (n <a ) \u2192 print \"No\".\n\nThis is correct.\n\nElse if a==b: check mod(n,a).\n\nElse, proceed to the next steps.\n\nAnother thing in the binary search:\n\nThe high starts as x+1.\n\nWait in the original code's else case (when a\u2260b), the binary search runs after x is computed.\n\nDoes the value of high need to be set as x +1? Because the code in Java uses:\n\nlow=1; high =x+1.\n\nThen, the binary search proceeds.\n\nHmm, perhaps in some cases x might be negative. But given the variables involved, but even so, the loop is written.\n\nAnother edge case when x is negative: For example a=2,b=1 \u2192 then (b-a)= -1, so x =1/(1-2) \u21921/-1 \u2192 -1.\n\nThen high =x+1 \u21920. Since low starts at 1 and high 0, so the while (low <=high) loop won't run, so ans remains its initial value of 1.\n\nThen, the check:\n\nans-1 =0 \u2192 (ans-1)*b =0 \u2192 and ans*a= 2*1=2.\n\nIf n is 1 (n <a? a=2 yes so in first condition \u2192 print \"No\". So not applicable here.)\n\nWait if n=2, a=2, b=1:\n\nBut a and b are different (a\u2260b), so:\n\nFirst, a=2, n=2 \u2192 n >= a?\n\nYes. Proceed to the else case.\n\nx = b/(b -a)= 1/(1-2)= -1.\n\nCheck if n >x*a \u2192 2 > (-1)*2 \u2192 -2 \u2192 2 >-2 \u2192 yes \u2192 so \"Yes\".\n\nThus the code would print yes, but let's see: when a=2 and b=1, perhaps the problem allows some combinations. The problem\u2019s actual logic may require certain conditions, but as we are just translating, we need to capture the code exactly.\n\nNow, regarding the Fortran code's logical conditions:\n\nYes, I think the code is as intended.\n\nTherefore the translated Fortran code should behave the same as the Java code.\n\nNow, writing the code with these considerations:\n\nWait, the variable x is integer(kind=8), which is correct.\n\nAlso, the result is set to \"Yes\" or \"No\" depending on the conditions, then write(*,*) trim(result).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHere's the Fortran code."
