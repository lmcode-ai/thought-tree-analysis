    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code is doing.\n\nFirst, the Java program reads two integers, n and d. Then it reads an array of n integers. After that, it calculates some result based on the array and these numbers. Finally, it prints the result.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n1. The main method starts by getting input using Scanner. In Fortran, I'll need to read from standard input, probably using read(*,*) statements.\n\n2. The variables n and d are read first. Then the array nums is of size n, filled with the next inputs.\n\nWait, in Java, arrays are 0-based, but Fortran typically uses 1-based indexes unless specified otherwise. Hmm. Need to be careful about that.\n\nMoving to the loops. The first loop reads n numbers into the array. The second loop starts at i=1 (Java's index 0 to n-1, so in Fortran maybe 1 to n). Let me see.\n\nIn the main processing loop (for i from 1 to n-1 in Java), the code calculates a as (nums[i-1] - nums[i]). Since the Java indices start at 0, in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then the elements are nums(1) to nums(n). So when i is from 1 to n-1 (Java's i goes up to n-1, which is 1-based's up to n-1), so the equivalent in Fortran would loop from 2 to n? Wait, no: let's think:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) \n\ni runs from 1 to n-1 (since i < n). So the indices in nums are [i-1] and [i], so 0 to 1, etc., up to n-2 and n-1.\n\nIn Fortran with 1-based arrays, the equivalent would be to iterate over 2 to n (since the first element is 1, so i starts at 2, up to n, which gives pairs (i-1, i)). Wait, no: if i is up to n, then i-1 would be n-1. So for the loop in Fortran:\n\nDo i = 2, n\n\nSo in the loop body, nums(i-1) and nums(i) are the two elements. That seems correct.\n\nNow, in the Java code:\n\na = (nums[i-1] - nums[i]) \n\nThen, if a is >=0, then result += a/d +1, and then nums[i] += (a/d +1)*d;\n\nWait, division in Java is integer division. So in Fortran, we need to use integer division, perhaps with the / operator but considering that in Fortran, integers divided give integer (if both are integers). \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division of two integers gives a real unless using integer division. Wait, no: actually, in FORTRAN 77 and earlier, a / b would produce integer division if both are integers. In newer versions like F90, maybe it's different? Well, the code is probably intended for older style. To be safe, perhaps use INT division. But perhaps the code can just use normal division, and in Fortran, if a and d are integers, a/d will truncate.\n\nWait, in any case, the code in the loop:\n\na = nums[i-1] - nums[i]. So if that's positive or zero, then we compute (a divided by d, integer division), then add 1. \n\nWait the expression a/d +1: because in Java, the division is integer division towards zero. So positive numbers are straightforward. Let's see example. For example, a =5 d =2 \u21925/2 is 2 in Java. So 2+1=3. So perhaps the formula is calculating the required increments?\n\nWait the purpose here is likely to adjust the current element nums[i] so that it's at least nums[i-1], requiring the number of steps to increase. Hmm, maybe it's part of some greedy algorithm. \n\nSo the key steps to translate correctly:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared. Let's see:\n\n- Declare n and d as integers.\n\n- The array nums needs to be an array of integers with size n. But in Fortran, you need to declare the array size before using it. Since n is input, perhaps using an allocatable array.\n\nAlternatively, in fixed size arrays, but we have to guess the maximum possible n. But the code must read n, so maybe we need an allocatable array.\n\nIn Fortran 90, we can do:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: nums\n\nSo first, declare variables:\n\ninteger :: n, d, result, a, i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: nums(:)\n\nThen in the main block:\n\nRead in n and d first, then allocate nums(n). Then read the array.\n\nThe code structure for the main part:\n\nprogram codeforces_11_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, d, result, a\n\ninteger :: i\n\ninteger, allocatable :: nums(:)\n\n! Read n and d\n\nread(*,*) n, d\n\nallocate(nums(n)) ! allocate array after reading n\n\nread(*,*)(nums(i), i=1,n) ! read all elements\n\nresult =0\n\ndo i=2, n  ! Java loops i from 1 to n-1 (Java's indices). In Fortran 1-based, so i from 2 to n.\n\na = nums(i-1) - nums(i)\n\nif (a >=0) then\n\n   result = result + (a /d ) +1\n\n   nums(i) = nums(i) + ( (a/d +1 ) * d )\n\nend if\n\nend do\n\nprint*, result\n\ndeallocate(nums)\n\nend program codeforces_11_A\n\nWait, but I need to check the loop indices again.\n\nWait, in the for loop in Java:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++)\n\nSo in Java, i goes from 1 to n-1 (because when i is n-1, it's still less than n). So the indices in the nums array are (i-1) and i, so starting from 0 and 1 (Java indices) up to n-2 and n-1.\n\nIn Fortran with 1-based arrays, the equivalent would loop from i =2 to i = n (since i starts at 2, so i-1 is 1, up to i =n, so i-1 is n-1 and i is n, which would cover all adjacent pairs). Because for the first iteration (Java i=1) \u2192 Fortran i=2: elements 1 and 2; last iteration Java i =n-1 (Java's element indices n-2 and n-1 \u2192 Fortran elements (n-1) and n when i is n.\n\nWait, perhaps the loop should be from 1 to n-1 in Fortran's loop index, but the code using the current approach will work as i ranges from 2 to n, which is the same as (Java's 1 loop). So the code is correct here.\n\nWait in Fortran loop Do i = 2, n gives i values 2,3,...,n if n>1.\n\nSo the loop over all pairs is done.\n\nNow testing the calculation of a:\n\na = nums[i-1] - nums[i] (Fortran uses i here as well, yes)\n\nif a >=0, then proceed.\n\nThen, result += a/d +1 \u2014 in Fortran that would be:\n\nresult = result + (a/d) +1. Here, in Fortran, since a and d are integers, a/d is integer division, as in Java.\n\nWait but what if a is negative? Well, the if condition (a >=0) prevents that part.\n\nWait the division is only done when a is non-negative, so a/d is non-negative. So the calculation is okay.\n\nThen, the nums[i] is updated by adding (a/d +1)*d.\n\nIn Fortran that is:\n\nnums(i) = nums(i) + ( (a/d +1) * d )\n\nSo multiplying by d and adding.\n\nNow, variables a is of integer type?\n\nYes, in the code above, a is declared as integer.\n\nWhat about the initializations?\n\nresult starts at 0, which is done here with result=0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for I/O:\n\nThe initial read is n and d. The read statement in Fortran: \n\nread(*,*) n, d\n\nThe array inputs:\n\nRead the next line for n integers. The read command can be:\n\nread(*,*) (nums(i), i=1, n)\n\nYes.\n\nThen print the result.\n\nOther points: In Fortran, program execution starts with the program line. The variables are declared with the appropriate types.\n\nThe deallocate is necessary after using an allocatable array. So that's included.\n\nWait, but Fortran allocatable arrays are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope, but since we're in a program (not a subroutine), the deallocation there is okay.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the code can omit the deallocate, though it's better to include it.\n\nWait, in older Fortran, maybe no, but in F90 and later, allocatable arrays should be deallocated? Well, the program exits, so it might not be necessary, but it's good practice.\n\nSo the code looks correct.\n\nTesting for possible edge cases.\n\nWait, let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose n=2, d=2. The nums array is [5, 1].\n\nThen in the first (and only) iteration (since i=2):\n\na =5-1 =4.\n\nSo a/d is 2. Then the result is 0 +2+1=3.\n\nThen nums(2) becomes 1 +3*2 =7. But that's modifying the array, but this example's result would be 3.\n\nWait but maybe that's part of the algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original code wants to track how much adjustment is made between elements so they are increasing?\n\nThis particular code may be for problem \"Split the Leaderboard\" or some problem from Codeforces. Anyway the code's logic is as given, so translation is about accurately converting the operations.\n\nPotential syntax issues in Fortran:\n\nIn the assignment statement for the array, when reading, commas vs. asterisks?\n\nThe read statement for the array would be read(*, *) (nums(i), i=1, n) \u2014 which is correct in Fortran 90.\n\nAnother possible syntax: in some older Fortran versions, the loops might have required different forms.\n\nWait the DO loop here is structured with the DO and END DO, which is Fortran 90 style. So the code is in modern syntax.\n\nAll together, the translated code should be okay.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the array starts at 0, but the Fortran code starts at 1. That's handled correctly in the loop and in the array access.\n\nYes, I think this should work."
