    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding the Java code first. \n\nThe Java code reads two integers n and k from the input, followed by n integers. It then checks for consecutive duplicates and keeps track of the count. The logic here is to find the longest sequence of the same number. Finally, it checks if adding k to this count exceeds n. If so, it prints n - c, otherwise -1. \n\nHmm, let's think about how to implement this in Fortran. \n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a Scanner class like Java. So I'll need to use standard input methods. Maybe using read(*,*) statements.\n\nThe variables: n, k, l (previous number, initialized to 0?), c (current count, starts at 1). Wait, in the Java code, c is initialized to 1. But what if the first element starts a new sequence? Let me look again. \n\nIn the Java loop, for each a (the next input integer), if it's equal to l (the last), then increment c. Else reset c to 1. Then set l to a. The initial l is 0. Wait, but the first a could be anything. So for the first element, since l is 0, which probably isn't part of the input, unless the input starts with 0. So that could be an issue. Wait, in the Java code, the initial l is 0. But the input numbers might have 0. Hmm. Let's see: the problem probably counts the first element's occurrence. Let's see.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes l to 0. Then for each a of the n elements, the code checks if a equals l. For the first iteration, a is the first element, l is 0. So except when the first element is 0, else c will reset to 1. Wait, but then the c is started at 1. Wait the initial c is set to 1 before the loop. \n\nAh, so let's see: For the first element, since a (first input) is compared to l (initially 0), unless the first a is 0, it will trigger the else clause, so c becomes 1 again. Wait, because in the first iteration, after reading a, if a is not equal to l (which was 0), then c gets set to 1. Then l is set to a.\n\nWait but the c was initialized to 1 before the loop starts. Let's walk through:\n\nInitialize before loop: l is 0, c is 1.\n\nFirst iteration: Read a (the first element). \n\nCheck if a == l (which is 0). \n\nIf the first element is 0, then c becomes 2, else, else case: set c to 1. Then l is the first element.\n\nWait, this seems okay. The initial c=1 is a bit tricky. Let me see: The first element's count is c's value after the first step. If the first element is different from 0, then the else clause sets c=1, resets, since the previous l (0) is different. So the first element's count becomes 1. Which is correct.\n\nIf the first element is 0, then since a (0) equals l (0) initially, c increments to 2. Which also correct.\n\nSo for the Fortran code, variables:\n\nn and k: integers read first. Then the variables l is an integer storing the last value, c (current count). And the array of integers. Wait, in the Java code, it reads each a in a loop, so the elements are read one by one, without storing them all. So perhaps in Fortran, we can read each element as we go, like in Java.\n\nIn Fortran, variables have to be declared. So I'll need to declare variables n, k, l (for previous value), c (count). And the variables for the loop counter and the current number a each time. Since Fortran has different variable handling, especially with declarations.\n\nLet me outline the steps in Fortran:\n\nStart program. Read n and k from stdin. Then initialize l to 0, c to 1.\n\nThen loop n times:\n\nRead a (each subsequent integer). \n\nCheck if a equals l:\n\nIf yes: c = c + 1\n\nElse: c = 1\n\nSet l to a.\n\nAfter each iteration, proceed.\n\nOnce loop is over, check if (c + k) > n:\n\nIf yes, print n - c\n\nElse: print -1.\n\nSo now, considering the syntax differences:\n\nFortran uses implicit typing unless specified, but better to use implicit none and declare variables.\n\nVariables: n, k, l, a (current integer), c.\n\nLoop variable i from 1 to n, perhaps. (Fortran loops use DO loops, starting with a variable).\n\nBut in the Java code, the loop variable i is not used, only for iteration count. So in Fortran, can do:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\nthen read a, then do the checks.\n\nWait for variables:\n\nThe program would start with a PROGRAM block.\n\nWait let's structure it:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_222_A\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: n, k, l, c, i, a\n\nRead the first line: read(*,*) n, k\n\nThen initialize variables:\n\nl = 0\n\nc = 1\n\nThen the loop from 1 to n:\n\nDO i = 1, n\n\n   READ(*,*) a\n\n   IF ( a == l ) THEN\n\n       c = c +1\n\n   ELSE\n\n       c = 1\n\n   END IF\n\n   l = a\n\nEND DO\n\nAfter the loop, check the condition:\n\nIF ( c + k > n ) THEN\n\n   PRINT *, (n - c)\n\nELSE \n\n   PRINT *, -1\n\nEND IF\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nHmm, but wait, in Java the initial c is set to 1 before the loop. The loop runs n times, so the variables start with that. Let me test possible cases.\n\nWait let's consider the initial setup:\n\nIn Java, before the loop c is 1. Then in the first a, which is the first element, so after the loop runs once, \n\nSuppose n=1, then the loop runs once, and checks:\n\nif first a is equal to l (0). So if the first element is 0, then c becomes 2, else it resets.\n\nWait, then for n=1, if the input a is 0, then after the loop, c will be 2. Then c +k > n (since 2 +k >1). So the result would be n - c (1-2 = -1?), but since the condition is c +k >n, then for n=1, k=0, then 2 +0 = 2>1? yes. So output would be 1-2 = -1, which would be printed. Wait but n=1 can't have a longer sequence?\n\nHmm the problem expects the code to find the longest consecutive sequence, then check if after adding k, the total is more than n. Not sure about the logic here, but the code in Java is as given. But the code as written may have some edge cases but in the translation, the logic is preserved.\n\nNow for the Fortran variables:\n\nWe have to make sure l is initialized to 0, c is 1.\n\nWait, code:\n\nBefore the loop, set l =0, c =1.\n\nThen read first a.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCompare a with l (0). \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nLet me check the code again.\n\nYes, this seems correct. \n\nBut I should note that in Fortran, all variables must be declared. So the code should have:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_222_A\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: n, k, l, c, i, a\n\nRead first two numbers:\n\nREAD(*,*) n, k\n\nThen initializations:\n\nl=0\n\nc=1\n\nloop:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\nand so on.\n\nYes.\n\nOne thing to watch out: Fortran's default input may require a formatted read. Since Java uses Scanner which handles space-separated inputs. The Fortran code using read(*,*) should also read space-separated inputs.\n\nSo assuming the inputs are all given in a single line? Or maybe each number is entered on a new line?\n\nThe problem statement might require that the input is provided as lines with space-separated numbers. For example, first line has n and k, then the next n lines each have a, or perhaps all inputs are in one line. But in Java, the Scanner will do the same.\n\nIn Fortran, the READ *, list will read as much as needed from the current input, so if all on same line, that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle that.\n\nTesting scenario:\n\nLet's take a sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nJava example input say:\n\n3 1\n\n0 0 1\n\nThe first line is n=3, k=1, then a's are 0,0,1.\n\nThe code execution:\n\nInitialize l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a=0.\n\nSince a equals l (0), so c becomes 2.\n\nThen l becomes 0.\n\nSecond iteration (i=2):\n\na is 0 again.\n\na equals l (0), so c becomes 3.\n\nl is set to 0 again.\n\nThird iteration (a=1):\n\na not equal to l (0), so c is set to 1. l becomes 1.\n\nAfter loop, c is 1.\n\nThen check if (1 +1 =2 >3? 2>3 is false. So output -1.\n\nWait but let's see in code:\n\nWait in this case, the maximum consecutive sequence was 3 (the two 0's plus the first). Wait first iteration:\n\nWait, let me redo the execution step by step:\n\nWait original input numbers: 0,0,1.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=1: \n\nRead a as 0.\n\nComparing a (0) to l (0). So yes, since l is 0 (initial value), c increases to 2, then l becomes 0.\n\nWait, then next a (0 again for i=2):\n\na (0) equals previous l (0). Thus c becomes 3. l remains 0.\n\ni=3:\n\na is 1. Not equal to l(0), so c reset to 1. l becomes 1.\n\nAfter the loop, c =1.\n\nThus condition 1 +1=2>3? No. So output is -1.\n\nThus correct.\n\nAnother sample: Let's say n=4, k=2. The sequence: 2,2,2,2.\n\nn=4, k=2. The code should process that:\n\nInitialize l=0, c=1.\n\nFirst a=2: not equal to 0, so c becomes 1, l=2.\n\nWait initial steps:\n\nWait first iteration:\n\nAfter first a: 2. Check if equal to l=0? No, so c sets to 1, then l set to 2.\n\nThus c is 1.\n\nSecond a=2 (second element, i=2):\n\nCompare to previous l=2: yes. c becomes 2, l stays.\n\nThird, a=2 again: yes, c goes to 3.\n\nFourth, a=2: yes, c becomes 4.\n\nAfter loop, c=4.\n\nNow, c +k (4+2) =6 >n (4). So yes. So output n -c \u21924-4=0.\n\nThus the code would output 0, which would match the code's calculations.\n\nTesting that in code:\n\nThe Fortran code's logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing the code:\n\nNow variables: in the code, I have to declare all variables. So the declaration is okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, variables can be in any order as long as declared.\n\nPotential problem: the variable l is initialized to 0. What if the first element of the input is 0?\n\nThen the first element's count starts correctly as c=2. Because first a (0) equals l (0 \u2192 yes), then c =1 +1 \u2192 2? Wait, wait in the first iteration.\n\nWait, code's variables:\n\nInitially, l=0, c=1.\n\nThe first a is 0: since a == l (0), then c +=1 \u2192 c becomes 2. Then l becomes a (0).\n\nThen the second element if it's also 0, then proceed.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nAnother possible test case where the entire sequence is the same.\n\nE.g. n=5, all zeros. Initial setup:\n\nc starts at 1, l=0.\n\nFirst a=0: equals l (0), so c becomes 2. l=0.\n\nSecond a=0: same \u21923, and so on.\n\nAfter all, the fifth 0: so after 5 steps, the c will be 5+1?\n\nWait let's see.\n\nWait for n=5:\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\na=0. c becomes 2, l remains 0.\n\ni=2: a=0 again. c increases to 3.\n\ni=3 \u21924, etc. After fifth a=0:\n\nAfter 5 steps, c would be 5+1? Wait:\n\nWait wait the process:\n\nStart c is 1. The first a (0) matches (0 \u2192 yes):\n\nc increases by 1. So first step: c=2.\n\nAfter 5 elements, the count would be 5+1? Wait let's walk through each:\n\nAfter each step:\n\nLoop:\n\ni=1: a is 0 \u2192 yes to a==l, so c increments from 1 \u21922.\n\ni=2: 0 again: c becomes 3.\n\ni=3: c \u21924.\n\ni=4: c\u21925.\n\ni=5: a=0 again, so c becomes 6.\n\nSo c=6 at end.\n\nThus the c +k would be 6 +k. So yes, the code logic works.\n\nThus, Fortran code as written should be correct.\n\nSo putting it all together. The Fortran code would be:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_222_A\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: n, k, l, c, i, a\n\nREAD(*,*) n, k\n\nl = 0\n\nc = 1\n\nDO i =1, n\n\n    READ(*,*) a\n\n    IF (a == l) THEN\n\n        c = c +1\n\n    ELSE\n\n        c =1\n\n    END IF\n\n    l = a\n\nEND DO\n\nIF (c +k > n) THEN\n\n    PRINT *, n -c\n\nELSE\n\n    PRINT *, -1\n\nEND IF\n\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_222_A\n\nWait but in the first case where n=3, the code for the sample had the maximum sequence of 2 zeros, leading to c=3 (second iteration's c), but then when the third element is different, the code calls c=1. But the code's c would hold the last count. That is, the code is keeping track of current run, not the maximum run.\n\nAh! Wait this is a problem. Oh no! The Java code is using c to track the current run length, but the problem requires finding the maximum run. Wait no, looking at the code:\n\nWait the code given in the problem may have a flaw?\n\nLooking back at the java code:\n\nThe java's \"c\" is the current run length. But after the loop, it uses c which is the last run's length. So the code's logic is: if the last run plus k exceeds n \u2192 then it prints something. But maybe the code is actually intended to have c track the maximum run. If so, then the translation is wrong because the code as is would use the final run's length, not the maximum. \n\nWait this is a critical point. I must check this.\n\nLooking at the original Java code:\n\nThe variables:\n\nc is initialized to 1 before the loop.\n\nInside the loop, for each a, if the current a is same as previous (l), then c increases by 1. Else set to 1. \n\nBecause the variables l is tracking the last value, so the code computes the longest consecutive sequence. But wait, no. The code is only tracking the current run length. But since c is overwritten each time, the final c after the loop would be the length of the last run. The problem must require the maximum run.\n\nWait then the original code is wrong. Unless the code is intended for some particular problem. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem's logic.\n\nThe original code's input is n, k, and a sequence of values. Then, it loops over each element and tracks the current run of the same number, and recorded the latest run length c. After the entire array, it checks if adding k to c (the last run's length) exceeds n. If so, then output n -c. Else, -1.\n\nPerhaps this code is solving a specific programming competition problem, perhaps Codeforces 222A, so understanding the problem statement would help, but since the user provided the code, I must translate it as is, without questioning correctness.\n\nTherefore, given that, the code only tracks the last run's length, not the maximum. So in the sample where the entire sequence is 0 0 0, n=3, k=0:\n\nThe c would be after the last run, 3, so c +0 is 3, not greater than 3 \u2192 output -1. But if k=1, then 3+1>3 \u2192 output 3-3=0.\n\nHmm, so the code uses the last run's length. Maybe the problem's condition requires that the last possible run. \n\nAssuming the given code is correct for its problem, then we need to translate it as is.\n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code is correct as written.\n\nNow check code syntax.\n\nVariables: declared correctly.\n\nIn the DO loop, loop variable must be integer. \n\nYes, all variables are declared.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the output will use PRINT *, and the logic is correct.\n\nThus I think this is a correct translation."
