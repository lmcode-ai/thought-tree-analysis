Thus the +modulus term is redundant. Wait wait, let me compute:\n\nSuppose (a + b) is 7, mod is 5. Then 7 mod5 is 2. (7 +5)=12 mod5 is 2. So same.

So (a +b + mod) can be any value. mod returned is:\n\nvalue = (a +b +mod) - k*mod, where k is the quotient. So (a +b + mod) mod mod is equal to (a +b mod mod). So the +mod makes no difference. Wait Modulo operation can be defined as giving the remainder of division. Wait for example, a+b = 100, mod=5. 100 mod5=0. 100 +5 mod5 is 0 too. So same. Alternatively if (a +b)= -1. Then ( -1 + 5 ) mod5 is 4, which is ( -1 mod5 ) which is indeed 4, so same. Wait so this term is redundant. But perhaps in code, it's to avoid negative values when the sum is negative? But mathematically, isn't the result the same?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at the Java code provided. There are two parts: the main class with a main method and a RemRing class. \n\nFirst, the main class 'atcoder_ABC151_A' reads a string from standard input using a BufferedReader. Then it outputs the first character of the string incremented by 1. Wait, but Java's String's charAt(0) gives the first character's value, so adding 1 would probably shift the character code. So in Fortran, how do we handle strings and characters?\n\nSo for the main part, the equivalent in Fortran would involve reading a string from input. In Fortran, you can read a string using a READ statement. The first character can be accessed with the (1:1) substring notation. To get its ASCII code, we can use IACHAR function. Then add 1 and convert back to a character with ACHAR. So the output would be ACHAR(IACHAR(S(1:1)) + 1). Using print *, to output that.\n\nWait, but the Java code uses System.out.printf with %c format to print the character. So in Fortran, using ACHAR on the correct code should do it.\n\nNow the second part is the RemRing class. This has methods for modular arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and an inverse function. These methods perform operations modulo a given module value. \n\nIn Fortran, since there's no direct class and object system, I need to translate this into modules and procedures. Alternatively, since Fortran is more procedural, perhaps creating a module for RemRing, defining the module variable as a parameter or variable, and then encapsulating the functions as module procedures.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn Java's RemRing:\n- A constructor takes the module as a parameter. In Fortran, the module variable can be a global variable inside a module. The constructor initializes it, but in Fortran, when initializing such a data structure, maybe we need a separate initialization function that sets the module parameter.\n\nWait, Fortran doesn't have objects, but we can use modules. Alternatively, perhaps passing the modulus as an argument to each function. Alternatively, wrapping it as a module where the module contains the modulus as a variable.\n\nHmm. Since the Java code's RemRing is a class with an instance variable 'module', each RemRing instance has its own modulus. But in Fortran, to mimic this, perhaps each 'RemRing' instance would be represented by a record or a custom data type, where the modulus is part of the data, and the functions take this data as part of the parameters. However, Fortran uses modules for encapsulation but doesn't have objects. \n\nAlternatively, we might need to use derived types. Oh right! Fortran has derived types, which can have components and type-bound procedures. That's probably the way to go.\n\nYes, so in Fortran 2003 and later, derived types can have type-bound procedures, similar to classes in Java. Therefore, I can create a derived type RemRingType which has a component 'module_val' (since module is a keyword in Fortran, maybe use a different name like modulus). Then each method of the RemRing class becomes a type-bound procedure.\n\nSo let's structure that:\n\nDefine a derived type RemRingType:\ntype RemRingType\n   integer(8) :: modulus\n   contains\n   procedures...\nend type RemRingType\n\nThen, the constructor (like a method) would be a subroutine that initializes an instance. But in Fortran, derived types can have a \"constructor\" via the initialization.\n\nAlternatively, the 'module' parameter is set when creating an instance. So to create a RemRing instance, you might do something like:\n\ntype(RemRingType) :: myring\nmyring%modulus = module_value\n\nSo the functions (sum, sub, prod, div, inv) would be type-bound procedures.\n\nWait, in Java, the instance variables are treated as hidden, so in Fortran, we can have the type's components as public, or encapsulate them. Since Java allows access via public variables, perhaps it's okay here.\n\nNow, the methods:\n\nsum(a, b) returns (a + b + module) mod module.\n\nSo in Fortran, sum would be a function that takes a and b (as integers 8?), adds them, adds modulus, then mod by modulus. The same applies for subtraction, which adds modulus to (a - b) before mod? Or the Java code uses (a - b + module) mod. \n\nYes, the Java code does: (a - b + module) % module. Which probably ensures the result is positive mod.\n\nFortran's modulo function is modulo(a - b + module, modulus). But need to compute the way as in Java. Alternatively, we can do sum as (a + b) mod modulus, but the Java code sums, adds module, then mods again. Not sure if that matters. Wait, maybe the addition could be negative, so adding the modulus before mod keeps it positive before taking mod. But in any case, translating precisely the code.\n\nFor inv(a) \u2014 the inverse of a modulo modulus. The implementation here uses the extended Euclidean algorithm. \n\nLooking at the inv function in Java:\n\nlong u starts at 1, v at 0. Then loops until b is 0. Wait the code in inv:\n\npublic long inv(long a) {\n    long b = this.module;\n    long u = 1;\n    long v = 0;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        u -= t * v; \n        // Then swap a and b, u and v etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is like the extended Euclidean step. Although I have to step carefully, because the code's loops might have a different approach.\n\nBut the key is to translate that loop into Fortran.\n\nSo for each function, let's think.\n\nIn terms of the sum function, which is part of the RemRing class. But how to write that in Fortran.\n\nWait, using the derived type:\n\nIn the RemRingType's type-bound procedures:\n\ntype RemRingType\n   integer(8) :: modulus\n   contains\n   procedure :: sum => RemRing_sum\n   procedure :: sub => RemRing_sub\n   procedure :: prod => RemRing_prod\n   procedure :: div => RemRing_div\n   procedure :: inv => RemRing_inv\nend type RemRingType\n\nThen each function (sum, etc.) will have the first parameter to be of type RemRingType, allowing the procedure to access the modulus.\n\nWait, in type-bound procedures, the first argument is the object instance if not explicit pointers. The syntax in Fortran for type-bound procedures is that when you call instance%sum(a,b), the instance is the first argument. So in the procedure's definition, the first argument is an object of RemRingType.\n\nSo, for example, the sum procedure would look like:\n\nmodule RemRingModule\ncontains\nfunction RemRing_sum(this, a, b) result(res)\n    class(RemRingType), intent(in) :: this\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = mod(a + b + this%modulus, this%modulus)\nend function\n\nWait no, the Java code has:\n\nreturn (a + b + module) % module;\n\nWait, adding module is to avoid negative numbers perhaps. Wait, perhaps the Java code is adding the module before mod, but modulus can be large. So the actual expression (a + b + module) mod module is equal to (a + b) mod module. Because (x mod module) is the same as (x + k*module) mod module. Adding module to (a + b) would be part of the modular addition. Wait actually no, perhaps that code is a way to handle negative results differently.\n\nWait, because for example, if a + b is negative, then (a + b + module) would be a + b + mod, so mod that by mod, gives a +b mod mod but by adding mod, then mod modulus gives a + b mod mod, but the sum can be (a + b) mod modulus?\n\nWait (a + b) mod mod is the same as (a + b) added any multiple of mod, then mod mod.\n\nBut here it's (a+b + mod) mod mod. But perhaps that's equivalent to (a+b + mod)%mod. The addition of mod is redundant, unless a+b is negative?\n\nWait in Java, the % operator returns a result with sign of the dividend. Hmm, so if (a + b) is negative, then (a + b) mod module (positive mod) \u2014 but adding module before taking the mod makes sure that the dividend is positive before mod. For example:\n\nSuppose modulus is 5. a = -2, b = 3. a + b = 1, adding 5 gives 6 mod5:1, same as before.\n\nIf a = -4, a + b (if b=0) would be -4. So -4 mod5 is 1, but (-4 +5) mod5: 1 mod5 is 1, same. So in that case, it's redundant.\n\nWait why does the Java code have this? Maybe because in the case when (a + b) is negative? Let's see:\n\nIf we have a situation where (a + b) is -1 and mod is 5.\n\nThen ( -1 +5 ) mod5 gives 4 mod5 is 4, which is the same as ( -1 mod5 ), which is 4. So same result.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is doing that to ensure that the sum before mod is always positive. Not sure why. Alternatively, maybe it's to handle underflows? Or the Java code uses (a + b + module) mod (2*module) then takes mod again?\n\nWait no. Let me look again: the Java code is:\n\nreturn (a + b + this.module) % this.module;\n\nWait, since (a+b + modulus) mod modulus is the same as (a +b) mod modulus, since modulus adds a full modulus increment. Thus the +modulus term is redundant.\n\nWait wait, let me compute:\n\nSuppose (a + b) is 7, mod is 5.\n\nThen 7 mod5 is 2. (7 +5)=12 mod5 is 2. So same.\n\nIf (a +b)= -3, mod is 5, then -3 mod5 is 2, but (-3 +5)=2 mod5 is also 2.\n\nSo maybe the code's addition of mod is superfluous, unless perhaps in cases where the intermediate result overflows? Because in Java, integer addition can overflow, but using 64-bit longs, but maybe to prevent negative results? \n\nHmm, maybe the code is written that way to handle cases where (a +b) is negative: adding mod makes it positive so the modulo returns same result as positive mod.\n\nWait the % operator in Java gives a result with the sign of the dividend. So (a + b) mod mod would be negative if the dividend is negative. Adding mod first makes the dividend non-negative before mod.\n\nWait take (a +b)= -6 and mod=5. Then (a+b) mod mod would be -6 %5 = -1. Adding mod gives (-6 +5) =-1, mod 5 is still -1?\n\nHmm then that's still the same. No, perhaps I compute using the formula in code  (a +b + mod) % mod.\n\n-6 +5 = -1. mod5, which is -1 mod5 = -1. Wait no, perhaps in mod function, in Fortran, what does mod do?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the idea is to compute (a +b + mod) then mod mod, but the result would end up being (a +b + mod) mod mod, but since mod is added once, the result is (a +b mod mod) + mod mod mod? Wait not sure. Maybe the code is written to force the intermediate to be positive. Maybe better to stick precisely to the code as written.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\n(a +b + mod) mod mod. Let's compute for any integer value of (a +b):\n\nmod is a positive number. So (a +b + mod) can be any value. mod returned is:\n\nvalue = (a +b +mod) - k*mod, where k is the quotient.\n\nSo (a +b + mod) mod mod is equal to (a +b mod mod). So the +mod makes no difference. Wait Modulo operation can be defined as giving the remainder of division.\n\nWait for example, a+b = 100, mod=5. 100 mod5=0. 100 +5 mod5 is 0 too. So same.\n\nAlternatively if (a +b)= -1. Then ( -1 + 5 ) mod5 is 4, which is ( -1 mod5 ) which is indeed 4, so same.\n\nWait so this term is redundant. But perhaps in code, it's to avoid negative values when the sum is negative? But mathematically, isn't the result the same?\n\nPerhaps the code uses it for integers to avoid negative intermediate results when a +b is negative. Wait, perhaps the author added the mod so that (a + b + mod) is always positive to prevent problems with modulo's sign? Or perhaps it's part of the algorithm to prevent wrapping, but as written, the code's sum can be simplified to (a +b) mod mod. But since the question is to translate it, the Fortran code should do exactly the same steps as the Java code, even if they can be simplified.\n\nHmm. So in the sum function:\n\nsum = (a + b + this.modulus) % modulus\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to compute that. In Fortran, the modulo function is modulo(a, m), which returns result such that sign is same as m. Or it's (a mod m). Let me check: \n\nThe Fortran intrinsic MOD(a, p) returns a - p*floor(a/p). \n\nSo for example, MOD(7,5)=2, MOD(-1,5)=4, MOD(-6,5)= -1? Wait no: because:\n\nMOD(-1,5): -1 - 5*(-0.2) \u2192 floor(-0.2) is -1, so -1 -5*(-1) \u2192 -1 +5 =4. Yes.\n\nWait so in Java when you do (a +b + this.module) % module, that would give the same as MOD( (a +b) + module, module ). Wait but adding module again would shift the number into a positive.\n\nWait, let's compute (a +b + mod) mod mod (Java code) \u2014 in Java, the result is between 0 (inclusive) and mod (exclusive). \n\nBut according to Fortran's MOD function, MOD( (a +b + mod), mod ) would also be the same.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nJava's % operator can return negative results if the dividend is negative. Wait no, I think in Java, the remainder has the same sign as the dividend. So if (a +b) is negative, let's say it's -3, mod=5. Then (a +b +5)=2 \u2192 mod5 \u21922. Which is correct. But the original (a +b) % mod would give -3 %5 \u2192 -3, but after adding mod, the mod calculation would give the proper positive. So this is necessary to get positives.\n\nAh, so the code is using mod function in Java to get a positive value between 0 and mod-1, but the modulo operator in Java may not handle negative numbers properly, so by adding mod before mod, it ensures that the argument to mod is non-negative. \n\nIn Fortran, the MOD function correctly wraps negative numbers, so perhaps the +modulus term is redundant. However, since we are translating exactly the code, we should follow exactly what the code says.\n\nIn Fortran, the expression (a + b + this%modulus) would be computed, then modulo modulus.\n\nThus, writing:\n\nresult = mod(a + b + this%modulus, this%modulus)\n\nSimilarly for subtraction:\n\nsub(a,b) \u2192 (a -b + module) % module. The same approach.\n\nprod(a,b) is (a *b) mod module. \ndiv(a,b) is (a * inv(b)) mod module.\n\nInv is more complex. Let's look at inv in Java.\n\nThe inv function:\n\npublic long inv(long a) {\n    long b = this.module;\n    long u = 1;\n    long v = 0;\n    while (b >0) {\n        long t = a / b;\n        a -= t * b;\n        u -= t * v;\n        long z = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = z;\n        z = u;\n        u = v;\n        v = z;\n    }\n    u %= this.module;\n    if (u <0) u += this.module;\n    return u;\n}\nHmm, this is an implementation of the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse. Let me trace through the variables.\n\nWait, the standard extended Euclidean algorithm computes coefficients u and v such that a * u + b * v = gcd(a, b). \n\nThe loop steps here:\n\nInitially, variables:\n\nThe 'a' and 'b' start as:\n\nInitially, a is the 'a' parameter (the number to invert), and b is set to the modulus. Then in each step, the algorithm does division (a = t * b + r), swap variables. \n\nHowever, the code here uses a while loop with b >0.\n\nLet me walk through the loop steps. Let me see:\n\nLet me see. Variable names are similar. The variables are similar to the standard algorithm but track the time steps. \n\nHowever, in the code's loop:\n\nInside the loop, after computing t = a /b, the remainder is a - t*b. However, then a is updated as (a - t*b). Wait but then the values swap:\n\nWait after dividing a by b, obtaining quotient t, remainder r. Then in extended GCD, next step is to set a = b, then b = r. Here in the code:\n\nAfter computing a -= t * b \u2192 this a is actually r (since a = t*b + r \u2192 r = a -t*b). But wait, the code then copies a into the swap variables and then sets a and b to the next a and b. Wait perhaps the code is doing a non-standard way of swapping?\n\nWait, steps in the code:\n\nIn each iteration:\n\nloop:\n\ncompute t = a / b (integer division truncating towards 0?)\n\nThen a = a - t*b \u2192 which is remainder (but with sign?)\n\nWait, but then after that, the variables:\n\nWait:\n\noriginal variables are a and b (call them a_old and b_old).\n\nThen a becomes the remainder (a_old - t*b_old). \n\nThen the code sets:\n\nz holds the new a (remainder). \n\nThen a becomes b_old, and b becomes the remainder (a_old - t*b_old). So proceed. \n\nWait, but perhaps the code is moving a and b as in the standard Euclidean algorithm. So it is working towards b -> 0. \n\nThe variables u and v are coefficients. \n\nINIT: Let me track:\n\nStart with:\n\ninitial a is input a (value to invert), initial b is modulus. \n\nu starts at 1, v starts at 0. \n\nWait, the purpose here is to track coefficients so that in each step, the relations are maintained.\n\nSuppose before the loop, a and b are as the given a (input to inv function) and modulus (module value). \n\nThe variables u and v start as 1 and 0. So initially:\n\nWe have:\n\na = a', original a.\n\nb = modulus.\n\nu = 1, v = 0.\n\nTherefore, a = a' * 1 + modulus *0 = a.\n\nAt each step, we compute coefficients:\n\nThe standard algorithm would track u and v such that a = a_initial * u + b_initial * v ?\n\nNot sure, but let's go step by step.\n\nThe key part is:\n\nWithin the loop:\n\nlong t = a / b; \u2192 quotient of a divided by b.\n\nThen,\n\nold_a = a \n\na -= t * b \u2192 a = a mod b. ( actually a = a - t*b \u2192 the remainder, but possibly with subtraction).\n\nThen, for the coefficients:\n\nu -= t * v \u2192 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is tracking the coefficients 'u' and 'v' such that a \u2261 u0 mod module, but I'm getting a bit confused. It might be better to see that this code is the standard extended GCD algorithm but implemented in a loop with swapped variables.\n\nAfter the while loop, the GCD is found ( stored in a? not sure), but in an inverse modulo, if the GCD(a, modulus) !=1, then there is no inverse, but this code may assume modulus is a prime. \n\nAssuming the modulus is prime, then a and modulus are coprime unless a is 0. But the code may not handle that case, returning some value.\n\nAssuming it works correctly, the code proceeds to the end where u is adjusted by mod and then made positive.\n\nIn the end:\n\nu mod modulus is taken. If it's negative, add modulus to make it positive.\n\nSo, in fortran:\n\nTranslating the inv function into a function that is part of the RemRing type's inv procedure.\n\nType-bound function RemRing_inv( this, a )\n\nIt will need to do the steps as in the Java code:\n\nvariables b is this%modulus.\n\nWait variables:\n\nStarting with:\n\nlong b_local = this.modulus; (because in Java, the code sets b = this.module)\n\nlong a_local = a.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables need to be copied since they are modified in the loop.\n\nSo, the inv function would need to make copies of a and the modulus (b) variables inside to avoid changing the original.\n\nWait the code works with variables b and a (but in the loop, they are modified). \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInside the_inv_subroutine:\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: a\ninteger(8) :: u, v, t, z, temp\ninteger(8) :: a_var = a\ninteger(8) :: b_var = this%modulus\nu_var = 1\nv_var = 0\n\nWait, but need to track changes inside the loops.\n\nWait let me rewrite in pseudocode for clarity:\n\nprocedure inv(a):\n   b = this.module\n   u =1\n   v =0\n   while b >0:\n       t = a // b (integer division)\n       a = a - t*b\n       temp = a \u2192 ? wait no, let me see.\n\nWait in the Java code, after a -= t*b, then the variables a and b do a swap.\n\nWait in the code, after the update of a and b:\n\nWait:\n\nAfter the updates:\n\n  a -= t * b; // new a: remainder?\n\nThen, inside the loop, variables z and others are swapped. \n\nLet me look again at the code:\n\n    long t = a / b; # a is divided by b, quotient is t\n\n    a -= t * b;    # a becomes remainder (assuming non-negative? depends on sign)\n\n    u -= t * v;    # also ? \n\n    long z = a; \n    a = b;\n    b = z; # swap a and b (then presumably, the previous remainder becomes b? )\n\n    z = u;\n    u = v;\n    v = z; # swap u and v, but need to subtract t*v earlier?\n\nHmm, this code might be tracking variables similar to the standard algorithm but with control flow that I'm having to parse.\n\nWait this feels a bit messy, maybe I need to think of alternative variable names to track:\n\nLet me let at each step:\n\nprevious a and b are variables. The code proceeds as follows:\n\nLoop condition: while (b >0 )\n\nInside loop:\n\nCompute t = a divided by b (integer division)\n\na is reduced by t*b \u2192 so a = a mod b?\n\nThen, do:\n\n compute u is updating via u -= t * v \u2192 \n\nThen swap a and b? Let's see:\n\n  z is assigned the current a (after reduction). a becomes the old b, and b becomes z (the reduced a). \n\nSimilarly for u and v: they swap.\n\nSo perhaps the code swaps a and b, but after the modulo step.\n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it would be better to reimplement the extended Euclidean algorithm in Fortran following the same steps as the Java code to be precise.\n\nLet me think of variables in Fortran for inv function:\n\nLet me outline the function:\n\nFunction RemRing_inv( this, a ) result (res)\n\n    class(RemRingType), intent(in) :: this\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n    integer(8) :: res\n\n    integer(8) :: b, tmp_a, tmp_b, u, v, t, z\n    \n    tmp_a = a\n    tmp_b = this%modulus\n    u = 1\n    v = 0\n\n    do while ( tmp_b >0 )\n        t = tmp_a / tmp_b\n        tmp_a = tmp_a - t * tmp_b\n        u = u - t * v\n\n        ! Swap tmp_a and tmp_b and variables.\n        z = tmp_a\n        tmp_a = tmp_b\n        tmp_b = z\n\n        z = u\n        u = v\n        v = z\n    end do\n\n    ! The loop ends when b was zero ( original b becomes zero?)\n\n    ! Now compute u mod modulus.\n    u = mod(u, this%modulus)\n    if (u <0) then\n        u = u + this%modulus\n    end if\n    res = u\n end function RemRing_inv\n\nWait wait, perhaps I need to track variables step by step:\n\nWait let me see the loop condition in Fortran code: while (tmp_b >0). The variable tmp_b starts as this%modulus.\n\nWait now, the variables:\n\ntmp_a is initialized to a (value to invert), tmp_b to modulus (this%modulus), u =1, v =0.\n\nThen, in each loop:\n\ncompute t= tmp_a / tmp_b \u2192 integer div.\n\nThen, tmp_a is set to tmp_a -t * tmp_b \u2192 remainder of division?\n\nThen, compute u -= t*v. So current u is updated to u - t*v.\n\nThen, during swap steps:\n\nz holds the current tmp_a (which is remainder after first step). \n\ntmp_a now becomes tmp_b (the previous divisor), and the next division will divide this into new tmp_b (old remainder).\n\nThen swap u and v variables similarly (but before swapping u had been modified).\n\nWait in the code, after the first swap assignments:\n\nAfter the first swap (tmp_a and tmp_b), then we also swap (z as temp) for u and v.\n\nWait perhaps the variables after the swap are now the next set.\n\nThis is quite involved, but the code must be accurate.\n\nWait let's also note that in Fortran, variables are generally 4-byte by default, so since the code uses long (64 bit integers), need to use integer(8).\n\nAlso, in Fortran, division is // ? Or /?\n\nIn Fortran, integer division can be done via the / operator, which truncates towards 0, like in Java (assuming), so that's correct.\n\nWait let me think again of the variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my Fortran translation for the inv function has some errors. Let's continue.\n\nAnother thing to consider is, after the loop, the variables u and v are such that u is the coefficient for the original a, and the loop terminates when tmp_b (the divisor) is zero. \n\nWait in the loops, since tmp_b starts as the modulus, and each loop reduces it by the remainder step, the loop proceeds until tmp_b reaches zero. The GCD is then the remaining tmp_a. So, if the GCD divides a?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the loop, u holds the inverse (if GCD is 1). \n\nThe code then adjusts u to be in modulus and positive.\n\nBut the code's final part: u = mod(u, modulus), but in code steps:\n\nAfter the loop:\n\nres = mod(u, modulus). Then if negative, adds modulus.\n\nWait mod(u, modulus) returns a value from 0 to modulus-1?\n\nWait Fortran's mod function returns the remainder with the same sign as the first argument. Wait no:\n\nFunction MOD(A, P)\n\nLet\u2019s see: if A is negative:\n\nMOD(-4,5) \u2192 -4 mod5 \u2192 ?\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nMOD(A, P) returns a result with the same sign as P.\n\nWait According to FORTRAN Wiki: MOD(A,P) returns a value of A - P*FLOOR(A/P), so for A negative. \n\nFor example, \n\nMOD( -4, 5 ):\n\n-4 / 5 \u2192 -0.8 \u2192 FLOOR is -1 \u2192 so:\n\n-4 - 5*(-1) \u2192 -4 +5 \u2192 1. So MOD(-4,5) is 1. \n\nWait so mod in fortran does the same as Java's % if P is positive?\n\nWait in java:\n\n-4 %5 \u2192 returns -4, but mod in Fortran returns 1. \n\nWait this is a critical difference! \n\nAh, this is an important point. \n\nIn Java, a % b (when b is positive) yields the remainder having the same sign as a. So negative if a is negative.\n\nBut in Fortran's MOD function, the result has the same sign as the divisor (the second argument). So, 5 is positive, so MOD(-4,5) is 1.\n\nWait that's a problem because the Java's modulo function is different from Fortran's.\n\nThus, in order to replicate the same behavior as the Java code's modulo operator, perhaps the remainder must be computed differently in Fortran.\n\nWait the problem arises in the inv function's final adjustment:\n\nJava code's code after the loop:\n\nu % module \u2192 which can be negative. \n\nWait let's see the code in Java:\n\npublic long inv(long a) {\n\n    ... loop code ...\n\n    u %= this.module;    \u2192 this is actually equivalent to u mod module. \n\n    if (u < 0) u += this.module;\n    return u;\n}\n\nWhich corrects if the remainder is negative. Because in Java, (u  mod module) can be negative (if u was negative), but after that check, adding mod. \n\nIn Fortran, the MOD function is already handling it so that the result is positive, provided the second argument is positive. \n\nWait, let's think for example:\n\nSuppose the modulus is 5. Let me take u = -1 after the loop.\n\nIn Fortran's code:\n\nu = mod(u,5) \u2192 mod(-1,5)=4, which is positive. So the 'u <0' check would be false.\n\nBut in Java, (u %5) would be -1, then adding mod:\n\nif (u <0 ), adds modulus to it \u2192 gives 4.\n\nThus, the correction in the Java code would not be needed for the Fortran MOD function, as MOD gives non-negative.\n\nThus, perhaps in the inv function, after computing:\n\nu = mod(u, modulus) \n\nthen no adjustment is needed. \n\nWait but in the Java code, after the loop, they do \"u %= module\" (which is same as mod). But then check for u <0.\n\nWait in our Fortran Mod implementation, can that happen?\n\nLooking at code steps:\n\nThe loop continues as long as the value b (tmp_b in Fortran code) is >0. \n\nAssuming that after the loop, the resulting u could be negative?\n\nHmm perhaps the algorithm's u variable can be negative even after the loop?\n\nLet me consider an example.\n\nTake a=3, modulus=5. Let's see step by step.\n\nJava's inv(3):\n\nLoop steps:\n\nInitial variables:\n\nb =5 (modulus)\n\nu=1, v=0\n\nloop since b>0:\n\nt = 3/5 \u21920\n\na becomes 3 -0*5 =3?\n\nWait the a here is the local variable a?\n\nWait in the Java code the variables are:\n\na and b are the variables being divided. \n\nWait wait the Java code's variables are:\n\nInitially, a is the input 'a' (3 here), b is module (5).\n\nLoop 1:\n\nb is 5 >0.\n\nt = a / b \u21923 /5 \u21920.\n\nThen, a = a - t*b \u21923-0 \u21923.\n\nu -= t*v \u2192 u -0 \u2192 u remains 1. \n\nThen swap steps:\n\nFirst swap a (3 now) and b (5). \n\nWait after the code after a -= t*b is done:\n\nThen, z is set to a (the new a is 3?), then:\n\nWe set a = b (5), b = z (3). \n\nWait, a is initially 3, after reduction, it's still 3, which becomes stored in z as 3. So the a becomes the old b (5), and b the new a (3). \n\nThen swap variables:\n\nz =u (1). Then:\n\nu = v (0), v = z \u2192 z was 1 \u2192 v is now 1. \n\nSo new variables after first iteration of loop:\n\na is 5 (old b), \n\nb is 3 (the previous a),\n\nu =0,\n\nv =1.\n\nNow loop continues as b (3) >0.\n\nSecond iteration: \nt = 5/3 \u21921 (taking floor. So trunc division.)\n\nThen, a is 5 -1*3 \u21922. \n\nThen, u -= t * v \u2192 u (0) -1 *1 \u2192 -1.\n\nThen swap variables a and b:\n\nz =a (2). Then a becomes 3 (current b value), b becomes 2 (z). \n\nThen swap u and v:\n\nz=u (-1). u =v(1), v=z (-1).\n\nNow variables:\n\na=3 (old b was 3, but now a is 3?)\n\nWait sorry:\n\nAfter first step in second iteration's swap after step:\n\nBefore the swap between a and b variables:\n\nAfter a is compute 5 -1*3= 2.\n\nAfter that, the step before swaps:\n\n a is 2. \n\n old variable b is 3 (from previous step). \n\n So in the swap for a and b:\n\nz = a \u2192 2 \u2192 then a is set to b (current b value is 3?), then b is set to z (2). \n\n Thus, then variables:\n\na \u21923, b\u21922.\n\n Then for the u variables:\n\n  the variables before swap: current u is -1, v \u21921 (qwqw)\n\n Wait after the u -= t *v step:\n\nu was 0, subtract 1 (t) * 1 (v) \u21920-1= -1.\n\n then z =u (-1)\n\n u becomes v (which was 1) \u2192 u is now 1.\n\n v becomes the old u: -1.\n\n Thus after second iteration:\n\nu is 1, v=-1.\n\n Now loop continues since new b is 2>0.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nt = a /b \u2192 a is 3 /2 \u21921 (3 divided by 2 is 1.5 \u2192 integer division is 1.\n\n Therefore, a becomes 3 -1*2=1.\n\nu = 1 - t*v \u2192 v is -1: so 1 -1*(-1) \u2192 1 +1 = 2.\n\n Then swapping steps:\n\n swap a and b variables: current a is 1 (after reduction), b is2.\n\n assign z = a (1) \u2192 then new a =b (2), new b = z (1). \n\n swap u and v:\n\n z =u (2), u set to v (-1), v = z (2). \n\nVariables now:\n\na:2, b:1 \n\nu: -1, v: 2 \n\n Next iteration of loop (b=1>0):\n\ncompute t =2 /1 \u21922.\n\n a becomes 2-2*1 =0.\n\nu (initial -1) >= minus t*v (2) *v's value (2 \u2192 because v is 2 here now? let me confirm.\n\n Wait after the onchange of variables:\n\nWait in previous iteration before swap, after the computation of the step:\n\nAt the third iteration:\n\nAfter the a is set to1 (a=3-1*2=1)\n\n then compute:\n\n swap steps: \n\nfirst swap a and b (a becomes 2 and b becomes1?)\n\nWait let me try tracing:\n\nLet me do this step again.\n\nAfter third iteration (after reset):\n\nVariables before third iteration:\n\na was 3 (previous a is 3 ( old a was 2?), this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe better to make a table:\n\nPerhaps, step by step:\n\nLet's set up an example step by step.\n\nExample: Find inverse of 3 mod5.\n\nJava code's inv(3,5):\n\nStart variables a=3, b=5, u=1, v=0.\n\nLoop while b>0:\n\nLoop 1 (b=5):\n\nt= a/b \u21923//5 \u21920.\n\na becomes 3 = a - 0*b \u21923.\n\nThen u becomes 1 -0*v (v is 0) \u2192 same.\n\nthen:\n\nswap a and b:\n\nstore a (3) into z, \n\nthen a becomes b (5), \n\nb becomes 3 (z).\n\nthen swap u and v: \n\nz =u (1)\n\nthen u =v (0), v becomes z (1). \n\nNow after first iteration:\n\nnew variables:\n\na =5 (stored from previous b)\n\nb =3 (previous a)\n\nu =0\n\nv=1\n\nNow loop continues (b=3>0).\n\nLoop iteration 2:\n\nt =a (5)/b (3) \u21921.\n\na =5  - 1*3 = 2.\n\nu = u \u21920 (old) minus t *v (v is 1 \u21920 -1*1 \u2192-1\n\nthen swap a and b:\n\nz =a (2)\n\na =b (3)\n\nb =z (2)\n\nthen swap u and v:\n\nz =u \u2192-1\n\nu =v (1)\n\nv = z \u2192-1 \n\nnow after second iteration:\n\na =3 (old b=3), \n\nb=2 (the swapped z from a's 2)\n\nu=1 \n\nv =-1 \n\nLoop continues (b=2>0).\n\nLoop iteration 3:\n\nt= a (3)/b (2) \u21921 (since 3/2=1.5 \u2192 integer division 1.)\n\na =3 -1 *2 =1 \n\nu=1 (current u) - t *v (v is -1 here?)\n\nWait current variables before the step:\n\nAt the start of the loop iteration3:\n\na is 3 (after second loop's previous variables). \n\nWait let me track step 3 variables:\n\nAfter loop iteration 2 ends, variables are:\n\na =3, b=2, u=1, v =-1 \n\nNow iterate again:\n\nSecond part of third loop:\n\na=3 \n\nb=2 \n\ncompute t =3//2 =1 \n\nso,\n\na =a - t*b \u21923-2=1 \n\nu = u (1) - t*v \u2192 v is -1 (from iteration2's end)\n\n1 - (1) * (-1) = 1+1=2 \n\nNow, the swap steps:\n\ntemp a is now 1. So:\n\n swap a and b:\n\n z =a \u21921 \n\n ( new a will be b (2), and new b z (1) \n\nSo a becomes 2 ( the value of b), and new b is 1.\n\n Then swap u and v: \n\n z =u (2)\n\n then u =v \u2192v is -1.\n\n v becomes z (2)\n\n so u is now -1, v is 2 \n\n now variables:\n\na=2 ( old b was2)\n\nb=1 ( new b is 1)\n\nu =-1 \n\nv=2 \n\nloop continues (b is 1>0)\n\n fourth iteration:\n\nloop starts with b=1.\n\n compute t= a (2)/b (1) \u21922 \n\na_next = 2-2 *1=0 \n\nu = u (now -1) - t*v (t=2) *v (v is 2 now?)\n\n Wait v is 2?\n\nAfter third iteration's swap steps for u and v, after which v becomes 2?\n\nAt the end of the third iteration's changes:\n\nAfter swapping: \n\nu was declared to become the old v (v is -1?) no:\n\nWait let's track. At step 3:\n\nBefore swapping the u and v variables:\n\nAfter setting variables:\n\nu was determined as 1 - t *v \u21921 -1 * (-1) \u21922. \n\nWait let me go back to step3:\n\nAt step3:\n\nAfter the subtraction for a:\n\na=1 \n\nthen,\n\nthen the code does:\n\nswap a and b:\n\n first part: \n\n z = a (1), a becomes b (2?) Wait initial a here is 3 (before subtraction?), no:\n\nNo, current a after step a=3? Or the value after 'a -= t*b' which was at third step:\n\nYes, at third iteration: \n\ncurrent step after subtraction:\n\na became 1. So:\n\nThen z = a (1), set new a =b (2) , which was previous b being 2 before swapping. \n\nWait this is really tricky. I think a table is better. \n\nIn any case, let's continue:\n\nWhen the b becomes 1, so entering iteration4 of the loop (b=1):\n\nt= a /b \u21922 /1 \u21922 \n\na becomes 2 -2*1 \u21920.\n\nu = current u (which after step3's swap after variables was ??? \n\nAt the end of step3's swaps, after step 3\u2019s swap steps, a was 2 (old b), b is 1 (old a's result 1), and u is -1, v is 2 (because after the swap step?). \n\nWait maybe this is getting too muddled, but let's proceed.\n\nAfter the fourth iteration:\n\nAfter all steps, a is now 0, then the swap steps:\n\nz is set to a (0), then a is set to old b (1), and b to 0. \n\nSo variables after this step's swaps:\n\na becomes 1 (old b was 1), b is now0. \n\nAlso swap for u and v:\n\n previous u was, before step4 computations:\n\nu was -1 (from end of iteration3)\n\n then during step4's computation:\n\nU = previous u ( -1) \n\ncompute u -= t*v \u2192 t=2 \n\nv is 2 (from iteration step?)\n\nWait this is too difficult to track without step by step tracing, but the main issue is that the modulo in Fortran's mod function is different from that used in the Java code's %.\n\nIn any case, in the end of the loop, the resulting u variable (the one to be returned) is typically correct modulo the modulus. But regarding the sign:\n\nIn the example above (a=3 mod5):\n\nThe correct inverse is 2, since 3*2=6 mod5 is 1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter the fourth iteration:\n\nAfter computation of a becomes 0 (3rd iteration's expr: 2 -2 *1?)\n\n Then, before the iteration 4's swaps:\n\n a is 0 (\u6b8b\u308a)\n\n then swapping variables:\n\n z = a (0), a will be set to old b (1,  ). b's new value would be 0. \n\n The step after iteration4 is:\n\n step 4's 'do while (b>0)':\n\n At the fourth iteration:\n\n b was 1 ( the b before entering the iteration is 1. \n\n after step:\n\n a becomes 0, then:\n\n the swap steps:\n\n z =0 \u2192 new a is b=1 (old b was 1?), and new b becomes z 0. \n\n then variable b is now 0. \n\n So after the iteration ends (y loop continues only if b>0 \u2192 0 is false, so the loop stops.\n\n thus the loop terminates.\n\n thus, at end of loop, u is ?\n\n this is getting too time-consuming. but ultimately, regardless of the literal steps, the crucial point is in Fort  the MOD function may need correction.\n\nAs for the Java code's inv function returns (u) after ensuring it is in the range [0, mod). \n\nIn Fortran, mod(u, mod) will already be in 0 to mod-1, so the adjustment of adding mod if u is negative is not needed.\n\nBut in the current example above, when in step4's calculation:\n\n suppose after all, the u value after loop is 2, so mod(u,5)=2, which is correct.\n\n Alternatively, \n\n perhaps the Fortran function's final steps are:\n\n u = mod(u, this%modulus)\n\n and then return it. the 'if (u <0)' can be removed.\n\nThus, the inv function's code for Fortran:\n\n function RemRing_inv( this, a ) result (res)\n\n    class(RemRingType), intent(in) :: this\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n    integer(8) :: res\n\n    integer(8) :: b_var, a_var, u, v, t, z, tmp\n    \n    a_var = a\n    b_var = this%modulus\n    u = 1\n    v = 0\n\n    do while ( b_var >0 )\n    \n        t = a_var / b_var\n        a_var = a_var - t * b_var  ! a_var is remainder (a_var =a-old minus ...)\n        u = u - t * v\n        \n        !
