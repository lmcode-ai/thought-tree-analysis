    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Hmm. First, I should understand what the Java code does. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n, then reads an array of n integers. It sorts the array, finds the minimum element (since after sorting, the first element is the smallest), then checks if all elements are divisible by this minimum. If any isn't, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum. Got it.\n\nNow, translating that into Fortran. Let me recall Fortran syntax and structures. \n\nFirst, input handling. In Java they use Scanner, so in Fortran I probably need to read from standard input. How do I read an integer n and then an array of n elements? \n\nFortran uses READ() statements. But for variable-length arrays (since n is determined at runtime), I might need an array with an allocatable size. Oh right, in Fortran 90 and later, we can have allocatable arrays. So I can declare an array, read n first, allocate the array to size n, then read the elements.\n\nNext, the array needs to be sorted. In Java, they call Arrays.sort(a). In Fortran, I'll have to sort the array manually. Maybe using the Mergesort or a built-in function? Wait, I think there's a function in Fortran called `SORT`, but I need to check if that's standard. Alternatively, perhaps use the `ISORT` subroutine from the intrinsic modules, but maybe just writing a sorting routine here could be easier. Hmm, but the code should be straightforward. Alternatively, using the standard `SORT` function? Let me think. \n\nWait, the `SORT` intrinsic in Fortran is available for arrays. Let me see: the syntax is like CALL ZEROS(A), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the `SORT` function from other libraries. Maybe the simplest way is to use the built-in `SORT` function. Let me confirm. Wait, I think in Fortran 90, you can sort the array using the intrinsic function `SORT`, which returns a sorted array. So something like `sorted_a = SORT(a)`, but I need the original array to be modified? Or maybe the user wants to sort in place? Hmm, perhaps better to make a copy. Alternatively, perhaps modify the original array.\n\nAlternatively, since the code first sorts the array, then proceeds, maybe here's how to do it:\n\nAssign the sorted array to a = sort(a)? Let me check. So, in Fortran, the `SORT` function returns a sorted array in ascending order. So:\n\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nBut then I need to replace the original array. Wait, actually, the original code sorts the array in place. The Java code uses 'Arrays.sort(a)', so modifies a in place. So in Fortran, I can do: CALL MERGE SORT? Maybe better to use the Fortran intrinsic sort:\n\nCALL QSORT(a) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing with Fortran versions. Let me search in mind. The standard way in Fortran 90+ to sort an array would be to use the `SORT` function. So the syntax is:\n\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nBut then you have to assign it. Alternatively, to sort in place, maybe use the `SORT` subroutine. Wait, perhaps the intrinsic procedure is 'SORT' but requires an array of indices. Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the `MSTRESS` function or manually implement selection sort. To keep it simple, maybe implement a simple sorting algorithm? Well, given that the original code just needs to sort the array, perhaps the most straightforward way here is to use the built-in function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nCALL SORT(a)\n\nBut I think the correct way is to use the 'SORT' intrinsic which is a function. Therefore, to sort in place, we have to use a temporary array.\n\nWait, perhaps I need:\n\na = sort(a)\n\nYes. Because the function sort(a) returns a sorted array. So by assigning it to a, the array is replaced with the sorted version.\n\nOkay, that should work.\n\nNext step after sorting is to get the first element as the minimum. Since after sorting, the first element (index 1 in Fortran) is the smallest. Then, loop through all elements, checking if each is divisible by the min. If any is not, print -1 and exit. So in Fortran, that loop can be a do loop.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, unless specified otherwise with (0:... etc.). So in the Java code, the loop starts at i=0, but in Fortran, the elements are from 1 to n.\n\nNow, translating each part step by step.\n\nStart with the program:\n\nProgram codeforces_299_A\n    implicit none\n    ... variables ...\n\nFirst, read the integer n. Declare n as integer, then read it. Then declare an allocatable array.\n\ninteger::n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nRead n: read(*,*)n\n\nThen allocate a(n):\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nThen read the elements of a:\n\nread(*,*)(a(i), i=1,n)\n\nWait, or read(*,*)a. I think in Fortran, you can read the entire array at once with read(*,*)a.\n\nBut maybe better to confirm syntax. So, after allocation, read the array.\n\nThen, sort the array using a = sort(a). But in Fortran, the syntax would be:\n\na = sort(a)\n\nBut need to check if it's available or if there's a module needed. If Fortran's standard intrinsic sort is available, then yes, but in some cases, you need to include a module, but I think it's part of the standard library.\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might be mistaken. Because in Fortran the intrinsic function called is SELECTED, perhaps? Or some other. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check. Let me think again. Wait, there's an intrinsic function called \"SORT\" in Fortran? Let me recall. \n\nAh, perhaps the confusion comes because in Fortran 90 and later, the functions called are more about searching, etc. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use a sorting routine. Maybe the best approach here is to use a built-in sort function. Alternatively, if the sort function is not available, then I need to implement a sort. Hmm, perhaps better to do it with a simple bubble sort or selection sort here for the code.\n\nAlternatively, what's the actual standard function?\n\nUpon some recollection, I think that there is a `SORT` function in Fortran as part of the ISO Fortran environment. Wait, in Fortran 2003 or 2008, the library might have it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way to sort an array is to use the `SORT` function like:\n\ninteger, dimension(size(a)) :: permutation\npermutation = merge( (/ (i, i=1, size(a)) /), &\n                    (/ (i, i=1, size(a)) /), &\n                    a < minvalue ) ... Hmm no, maybe this is getting into more complex business.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. \n\nPerhaps in Fortran, the standard way is to use the intrinsic procedures such as `SORT` in the `ISO_Fortran_binding`, but perhaps it's better to use a sort algorithm. Since the problem here requires the minimal element's first position after sorting, maybe it's better to sort the array in ascending order, and the first element will be the minimum. \n\nAlternatively, since sorting may be necessary, maybe I can use 'call msort(a)', but the availability of that might depend on the compiler.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written using the sort function. Let me check.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, you can sort an integer array via a = sort(a). So, the 'sort' function exists. Let me try to assume that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is 'sort(a)' but returns an array, so if I have to sort the array, then I would have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a_sorted(:)\na_sorted = sort(a)\n\nand then work with a_sorted. But that requires allocating another array, which is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can do that. Then, after sorting, the minimum is a_sorted(1). \n\nWait, but the code in Java modifies the original array. However in the code logic, after sorting, it uses the array in the subsequent loop, so perhaps we need to replace the array, so the sorted array is used. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps to save memory, proceed as follows.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, after computing min, then looping through the original array. Wait no, in Java it's the sorted a array. So in any case, the sorted array must be processed.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the function-based approach.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with code steps.\n\nAfter reading and sorting the array:\n\na = sort(a)\n\nso then the minimum is a(1).\n\nThen, loop over the elements:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    if (mod(a(i),a(1)) .ne. 0) then\n\n        print *, -1\n\n        stop\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen print a(1). \n\nWait, in mod(a(i), min) is zero for all elements? Because the first element is min. So that's how the check is done.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nNow, also, in Fortran, the input for the array is read as: when using list-directed input (read(*,*) a) then if user enters the numbers separated by spaces, it'll read them correctly. \n\nPutting all this into code.\n\nNow the variables:\n\nProgram codeforces_299_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    ! Read n\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    ! Allocate array\n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    ! Read the array\n\n    read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\n    ! Sort the array.\n\n    a = sort(a)\n\n    ! First element is min.\n\n    do i=1, n\n\n        if (mod(a(i), a(1)) /= 0) then\n\n            print *, -1\n\n            stop\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, a(1)\n\n    deallocate(a)\n\n    contains\n\nWait, but now the problem is the sort function. Does Fortran have this as a built-in? I think in some versions, but perhaps not. For example, in some Fortran versions, the sort function isn't available unless you use specific modules.\n\nWait, perhaps Fortran does not have a built-in sort function, which complicates things. Oh right, that's a problem.\n\nAh, right, I was confused earlier. Fortran does not have a built-in sort function in the standard library. Therefore, I need to implement a sorting algorithm.\n\nHmm. that's a crucial point I missed.\n\nTherefore, I need to write a sorting routine here. Let's think: perhaps a simple bubble sort, or selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, the easiest way here for the problem at hand is to implement a selection sort, which is straightforward.\n\nBecause the array's size isn't known until runtime. So implementing selection sort.\n\nSo code for selection sort:\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n    min_val = a(i)\n    min_idx = i\n    do j = i+1, n\n        if (a(j) < min_val) then \n            min_val = a(j)\n            min_idx = j\n        end if\n    end do\n    ! swap a(i) and a(min_idx)\n    temp = a(i)\n    a(i) = a(min_idx)\n    a(min_idx) = temp\nend do\n\nThis is the selection sort algorithm. That would sort the array in place in ascending order, which is needed.\n\nTherefore, including such a sort routine in the code.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow the program will have to have this sorting code.\n\nThus, the code outline becomes:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_299_A\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER :: n, i, j, min_idx, temp\n    INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: a(:)\n    \n    ! Read input\n    READ(*,*) n\n    ALLOCATE(a(n))\n    READ(*,*) a\n    \n    ! Sort array using selection sort\n    DO i = 1, n -1\n        min_idx = i\n        DO j = i+1, n\n            IF (a(j) < a(min_idx)) THEN\n                min_idx = j\n            END IF\n        END DO\n        ! Swap a(i) and a(min_idx)\n        IF (min_idx /= i) THEN\n            temp = a(i)\n            a(i) = a(min_idx)\n            a(min_idx) = temp\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    \n    ! The minimum is now at a(1)\n    DO i = 1, n\n        IF (MOD(a(i), a(1)) /=0 ) THEN\n            PRINT *, -1\n            STOP\n        END IF\n    END DO\n    \n    PRINT *, a(1)\n    DEALLOCATE(a)\nEND PROGRAM\n\nWait, but in the swapping, we only swap when min_idx is different from i. Well actually, even if they are the same, swapping may not be needed. But the code checks, so it's okay.\n\nTesting the code's logic. Let me think through possible steps.\n\nSuppose input n=3, array 3 6 9 \u2192 sorted as 3,6,9, so mod each is 0 \u2192 output 3.\n\nAnother example: n=4, array 4, 6, 8, 10. The minimum is 4. mod 6%4=2 \u2192 not divisible \u2192 so output -1. \n\nYes, the code should handle that.\n\nWait the second example: array 4, 6, 8, 10.\n\nSort to 4,6,8,10. Then check each element:\n\n4 mod 4 \u21920,\n\n6 mod4=2 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 so print -1.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, checking the Fortran syntax.\n\nIn the reading part: \n\nREAD(*,*) a \u2192 reads all elements into the array a. That should be okay.\n\nThe sorts. The selection routine.\n\nYes, looks correct.\n\nAlso note that in the initial code, the main variables are declared properly, with allocation and deallocation.\n\nThus, this Fortran code should be the correct translation.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code should look like that."
