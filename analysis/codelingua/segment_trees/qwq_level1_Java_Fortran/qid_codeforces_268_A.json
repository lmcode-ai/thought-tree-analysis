The matching are h[0]=1 matches first g's 1 in position1 (if loops from 0, etc.), so the total would be 3. But in Fortran, loops from i=1 to 3, so h(1) is 1, which matches g(2). h(2)=2 matches g(1). h(3)=3 matches g(3). So total 3, which is correct. The code seems correct. Another test case: n=2. h = [5,5]\n\ng = [5,5]\n\nThen the count is 4, which in Fortran loops would compute:\n\nfor each of the 2 h values (both 5), each compare against 2 g's (5,5).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code reads an integer n, then reads n pairs of integers (h and g arrays). It then counts how many times an element from the h array matches an element in the g array. So for each element in h, it checks all elements in g and increments the result if they are equal.\n\nNow, I have to think about how to do this in Fortran. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, in Java they import Scanner and use it to read input. In Fortran, I'll need to read from standard input using read(*,*) or similar statements. Since the code starts by reading a line for n, in Fortran I can read an integer n first.\n\nThen, arrays h and g of size n are declared. In Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions, and since Fortran uses 1-based indexing by default, that's something to note. However, the Java code uses 0-based because it's using for loops from 0 to n-1. Wait, but in Fortran arrays are declared with size n, starting at 1, so when translating the indices, I should adjust the loops to start at 1 instead of 0. Let me make sure: In Java's for loop, i starts from 0 to n-1, so in Fortran, the loop should run from 1 to n.\n\nSo the variables h and g are of length n, stored as integers. The loops to fill them: in Java, the code does sc.nextInt() twice for each i. In Fortran, I can read all pairs at once. So perhaps read each line as two integers. Wait: The Java code uses sc.nextInt() after nextLine(). Wait the first line is n, then the code reads n lines? Wait no: Looking at the code again. Let me see:\n\nWait the Java code after reading n using nextLine(), then for each i from 0 to n-1, reads h[i] and g[i] via sc.nextInt(). So the input is probably given with the first line being the integer n, then n lines each containing two integers h and g. Wait, but in the Java code, after reading n via nextLine(), then in the for loop it uses nextInt() which might read from the same line if the nextLine was only reading the first line. Wait, but maybe the input is provided with all values on one line? No, typically for codeforces, the input might be the first line n, then n lines each with two integers. But Java Scanner's nextInt can read from the next lines. \n\nWait, the initial code uses sc.nextLine() to read n. Wait that might be a problem because the nextLine() reads the entire first line, then when the next nextInt() is called, it will read the next token. But the problem is, if the first line has only n as an integer, then using nextLine() would read the entire line as a String, then convert it to integer. That's acceptable. So the rest of the input is n lines each with two integers, right? Or perhaps all inputs are given on a single line. But the code after the nextLine() reads n times with sc.nextInt(), each iteration taking two integers. So maybe after n, the rest is all on a single line, or multiple lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is written with the first line being n, then the next lines have each pair. So for Fortran, perhaps, I should read the input as a total of 2n numbers, after the first n.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the first line is read with nextLine, then n is parsed from that. Then for each i from 0 to n-1, it reads h and g, using sc.nextInt twice each iteration. So the subsequent input is read as two integers per line, or all as space-separated?\n\nBecause the code uses sc.nextInt(), it can handle space-separated inputs. So for example, input would be:\n\nn = 3\n\nThen lines like:\n\n5 6\n\n3 4\n\n7 2\n\nOr the rest of the input can be one long line with 6 integers: 5 6 3 4 7 2 ... so that each pair is h and g.\n\nIn any case, in Fortran, to read integers, we have to read from the input.\n\nSo, the plan in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read an integer n from standard input.\n\nThen, read 2n integers into arrays h and g, each of size n, so for each i from 1 to n, read h(i) and g(i).\n\nWait, so the code's data reading part would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n pairs, each pair is h(i) and g(i) for i=1 to n.\n\nThen the loops: for each i in h's elements, check each j in g's elements to see if h(i) equals g(j). If yes, increment result.\n\nSo, the nested loops in Fortran:\n\nresult = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) == g(j)) then\n\n         result = result +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, the Fortran variables.\n\nFirst, the program structure. Since Java is a class with main, in Fortran it's a program block, probably no need for a class.\n\nVariables:\n\nn is an integer. h and g are integer arrays of size n.\n\nBut in Fortran, array size must be known at compile time or use allocatable arrays or adjustable arrays (in modern Fortran).\n\nSince the code requires the size to be read from input first, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo, the variables declaration:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: h, g\n\nThen, the main steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate h and g.\n\nThen read the values.\n\nWait, the step-by-step:\n\n1. Read the value of n.\n\n2. Allocate h and g with size n.\n\n3. Read the next lines into h and g.\n\nWait, but the reading part needs to get n pairs, two integers each.\n\nHere, the code in Fortran could be something like this:\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(h(n), g(n))\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read *, h(i), g(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait but, depending on how the input comes, maybe the data is all in a stream so after reading n, the rest is read in 2n items. Alternatively, maybe the input after n is n lines each with 2 numbers. Either way, the read statement can handle it as long as the data is structured correctly.\n\nNow, Fortran has a different indexing. But the loop over i and j would be okay from 1 ton.\n\nNow, initializing the result variable. In Java it starts at 0. Similarly in Fortran:\n\nresult = 0\n\nNow the loops:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   do j = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) == g(j)) then\n\n         result = result +1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nAfter that, printing the result.\n\nprint *, result\n\nBut in Fortran, there are different formatting options, but Print *, is straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe program structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_268_A\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, i, j, result\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: h, g\n\n   read *, n\n\n   allocate(h(n), g(n))\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n       read *, h(i), g(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   result =0\n\n   do i=1,n\n\n      do j=1,n\n\n         if (h(i)==g(j)) then\n\n            result = result+1\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   print*, result\n\nend program codeforces_268_A\n\nWait, that looks okay, but perhaps I need to check the loops and variable declarations. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the declaration:\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, result\n\nare the loop variables i and j declared. So that's correct.\n\nBut I should also mention that in the loops, j is going to be used, so yes.\n\nWait the indices: The code in Java loops from 0 to n-1, but since in Fortran arrays start at 1, so the loops from 1 to n correctly covers all elements.\n\nNow, check if the code reads the inputs correctly.\n\nAnother thing: The first line in Java is read via sc.nextLine(), then the rest is sc.nextInt(). In the Java code, the first number is n. But when using Scanner, nextLine() might capture the new line after n, so maybe the code is reading the n from the first line, and the nextInt() would read from the next number, which is h[0]. But perhaps all the numbers after that are space-separated, so that's okay. In the Fortran code, using read *, n will read the next integer, and the subsequent reads will go through.\n\nWait, suppose the input is:\n\n3\n\n5 2\n\n6 1\n\n3 4\n\nThen in Fortran:\n\nFirst read *, n: reads 3.\n\nThen loops 3 times for i=1,2,3:\n\nRead *, h(1), g(1) would read 5 and 2.\n\nh(2)=6, g(2)=1\n\nh(3)=3, g(3)=4\n\nThen loops over h and g. So for h(i) =5, check all g's elements. in this example, 5 vs 2,1,4: no match. 6 checked against 2,1,4: no. 3 vs those: no. So result is zero? But let's see in the given code.\n\nWait maybe an example is better. Suppose n=3, and h has [1,2,3], g has [2,1,3]. The matching are h[0]=1 matches first g's 1 in position1 (if loops from 0, etc.), so the total would be 3.\n\nBut in Fortran, loops from i=1 to 3, so h(1) is 1, which matches g(2). h(2)=2 matches g(1). h(3)=3 matches g(3). So total 3, which is correct.\n\nThe code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2.\n\nh = [5,5]\n\ng = [5,5]\n\nThen the count is 4, which in Fortran loops would compute:\n\nfor each of the 2 h values (both 5), each compare against 2 g's (5,5). So each h gives 2, so total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code above should be correct.\n\nAre there any issues with the Fortran syntax?\n\nChecking:\n\n- The program block is correct.\n\n- Allocate for the arrays is okay after reading n.\n\n- The loops for reading h and g are okay.\n\n- The variables are declared before use.\n\nWait in the code I wrote, variables i and j are declared in the same line as n and result. So that's okay.\n\nNow, print * should output the result, without any formatting, which matches the Java's System.out.println(result).\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThe only thing to note is that in the Fortran code, the allocation is required. If the input n is zero, maybe it's an invalid case, but given the problem context, n must be a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the translated code should be:\n\nprogram codeforces_268_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, j, result\n\n  integer, allocatable :: h(:), g(:)\n\n  read (*,*) n\n\n  allocate(h(n), g(n))\n\n  do i = 1, n\n\n    read *, h(i), g(i)\n\n  end do\n\n  result =0\n\n  do i =1, n\n\n    do j=1, n\n\n      if (h(i)==g(j)) then\n\n        result=result +1\n\n      end if\n\n    end do\n\n  end do\n\n  print *, result\n\nend program codeforces_268_A\n\nWait wait, in the allocation, the declaration for h and g should be before the read - which they are, since the code declares them as allocatable. Also, after reading n, they can be allocated properly.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the read statements:\n\nThe first \"read *, n\" is okay. Then, the loops for reading h and g can be read in the same way. The read statement in the loop can be read *, h(i), g(i). Since in Fortran, the format is list-directed.\n\nThus the code should be correct."
