    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. First, I'll go through the Java code to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe problem seems to involve two integers a and b. The code calculates a result starting with res = a. Then in a loop while a is greater or equal to b, it adds a divided by b to res, and updates a to be the quotient plus the remainder. The final res is printed.\n\nAlright, translating to Fortran. Let's think about the structure. In Fortran, the main program can be written as a program block. Input and output use read and write statements. \n\nFirst, variables: in Java, they're declared as int a, b, res. In Fortran, I'll need to declare them as integers. Maybe use integer variables. \n\nThe Scanner in Java is for reading input; in Fortran, I can read from * to get input from standard input. So the first two lines would be reading a and b. \n\nThe loop is a while loop. Fortran uses a do loop structure. The loop continues as long as a >= b. \n\nInside the loop, res += a / b. So res = res + (a / b). Then a is updated to (a / b) + (a mod b). Wait, but in Fortran, the modulus operator is MOD or MODULO function. So a mod b in Fortran would be MOD(a, b). \n\nWait, the Java code's a is being updated as (a divided by b) plus (remainder of a divided by b). Wait, actually, the original a is (b * quotient) + remainder. So when you do quotient + remainder, that's (a divided by b) + (a mod b). But how does that affect the next iteration?\n\nWait, let's get that part clear. The original a is being reduced each time by replacing it with the sum of quotient plus remainder. Wait, maybe that's incorrect, but that's what the code does. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nInitialize res to a.\n\nWhile a >= b:\n\nres += (a / b) --> that's the quotient.\n\nThen a is set to (a / b) + (a % b). \n\nWait, so for example, if a is 10 and b is 2, first iteration:\n\nres starts at 10. Then 10/2 is 5. res becomes 15. Then new a is 5 + 0 (since 10 mod 2 is 0) so 5. Next iteration, since 5 >=2?\n\nBut in next step, 5/2 is 2, res +=2 \u2192 17. Then new a is 2 (quotient) +1 (remainder) \u2192 3. Then next iteration: 3 >=2 \u2192 yes. Then res +=1 (3/2=1), so 18. a becomes 1 + (3 mod2=1 \u2192 1+1=2. Then again 2 >=2? a is now 2, so again quotient is 1, adding to res (total 19). Then a becomes (2/2)=1 +0 \u21921. Now a is 1 <2. So loop ends.\n\nHmm, but I need to make sure I translate the operations correctly.\n\nIn Fortran, the division operator for integer division is / (but in some versions may floor differently, but assuming that in this problem, the division is integer division as in Java which truncates towards zero. For example in fortran, 5 / 2 is 2, same as Java.)\n\nSo the key parts to translate.\n\nThe main steps are input, loop, and output.\n\nNow, structuring Fortran code:\n\nStart with the program statement:\n\nprogram codeforces_379a\n\nThen declare variables. Let's see, variables a, b, res. All integers. So:\n\ninteger :: a, b, res\n\nThen, read the inputs. Use read *, a, b.\n\nThen initialize res to a. So res = a.\n\nThen the loop:\n\ndo while (a >= b)\n\n    res = res + (a / b)\n\n    a = (a / b) + mod(a, b)\n\nend do\n\nThen write the result: write(*,*) res.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function is MOD, case-insensitive, so MOD(a,b). And the assignment of a is (a divided by b plus mod(a,b)).\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo putting together:\n\nprogram codeforces_379a\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a, b, res\n    read(*,*) a, b\n    res = a\n    do while (a >= b)\n        res = res + a / b\n        a = (a / b) + mod(a, b)\n    end do\n    write(*,*) res\nend program codeforces_379a\n\nWait, but I should check for division by zero. The code in Java probably expects b to be at least 1. Because if b is 0, then division by zero would happen. But the problem may have constraints ensuring b is valid. So we can proceed as per the code.\n\nWait the original code's while loop condition is a >= b. So if b is zero or negative, this could be an issue. But perhaps the problem statement ensures that the inputs are valid (like for Codeforces problem 379A?), probably a and b are positive integers with b>0. So the code is okay.\n\nLet me test with some sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2 \u2192 expected output is 19? Let's see.\n\nThe original Java code:\n\nInitial res = 10.\n\nLoop:\n\na=10 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres += 10/2=5 \u2192 res becomes 15.\n\na is set to 5 + 0 \u21925.\n\nNext loop: 5 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nres += 2 \u2192 17. new a =2+1 \u21923.\n\nLoop continues.\n\n3 >=2: add 1. res becomes 18. new a=1 +1 \u21922.\n\na is 2, so loop again:\n\n2 >=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nAdd 1 \u2192 res 19. new a=1 +0 \u21921. Now a=1 <2, loop ends.\n\nTotal res is 19. So code works.\n\nTesting Fortran code with the same input should produce 19. So code should be correct.\n\nAnother test case. Let's try a sample from the problem if I recall.\n\nWait problem 379A is \"Cups\", perhaps I'm getting the problem wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait no, actually the problem was A. Suppose the problem is as per code's logic. The code is from Codeforces 379A? Wait probably, but I'm not sure, but the code is given here.\n\nAnother example, say a=8, b=3.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nInitial res=8.\n\nLoop:\n\n8 >=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nAdd 8/3 =2 to res \u2192 10.\n\na becomes 2 +2 \u21924 (since remainder is 2).\n\nNow a=4.\n\n4 >=3 \u2192 yes.\n\nres +=1 (4/3=1 \u2192 total 11.\n\nnew a:1 +1 \u21922.\n\nNow 2 <3 \u2192 loop ends. Total res is 11.\n\nIn the code, so let's see with Fortran.\n\nYes, the code should be correct.\n\nI think that's the correct Fortran translation. Let me make sure that the MOD function is used correctly. Because in Fortran, MOD(a,b) gives the remainder with the sign of a. But in cases where a is divided by b in Java, when a is positive and b positive, MOD(a,b) is same as a mod b in Java.\n\nYes, because in our case, inputs are positive. So that's okay.\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
