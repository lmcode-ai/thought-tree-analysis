    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code to Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. \n\nThe Java program reads an integer n from standard input and then calls a solve method which calculates and prints some value. The solve method does (n divided by 3) multiplied by 2, plus 1 if there's a remainder when divided by 3, else 0. \n\nSo, translating this to Fortran: I know Fortran uses read(*,*) for input. The main program structure in Fortran is a bit different. Since Java is object-oriented, but Fortran is procedural, I'll just need a program block here. \n\nFirst, the main part. In Java, they use a BufferedReader to read the input. In Fortran, I can just read an integer directly. So the equivalent would be reading from the standard input using read(*,*) n. \n\nThen, the solve function. Since Fortran uses functions and subroutines, perhaps I can write a subroutine solve that takes an integer n and writes the output. Wait, but in the Java code, the solve method is static and just prints the result. So in Fortran, the subroutine can compute the value and then print it. \n\nLet's think about the calculation. The expression is (n / 3)*2 + (if n mod 3 is 0 then 0 else 1). \n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with /, and mod is modulo. So the first term is (n /3)*2. Then the second term is 1 if mod(n,3)/=0, else 0. So combining those terms. \n\nWait, let's see: when n is exactly divisible by 3, the remainder is zero, so add 0. Otherwise add 1. So the second part is equivalent to 1 if mod(n,3) !=0. \n\nSo the total is (n/3)*2 + present(remainder ?1 :0). \n\nSo, in Fortran code, how to compute this? Let me see.\n\nLet me structure it step by step. \n\nFirst, in the main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_669A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    read(*,*) n\n    call solve(n)\nend program\n\nThen the subroutine solve:\n\nsubroutine solve(n)\n    integer, intent(in) ::n\n    integer :: result\n    result = (n /3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n    print*, result\n    return\nend subroutine\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute directly in the print statement. Let's see.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can compute expressions directly. The merge is a function that takes two values and a logical condition. So merge(1,0, condition) where condition is mod(n,3)/=0. So that would give 1 when true, else 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe an arithmetic expression. Because the condition is whether mod(n,3) is zero or not. If mod is non-zero, add 1, else 0. So maybe 1*(mod(n,3)/=0). Since in Fortran, logical values in expressions are treated as 1 (true) or 0 (false). Wait, no, actually in Fortran, logical values can't be directly used in arithmetic, but using the merge should work. Alternatively, use the fact that ceiling(n/3.0) ?\n\nWait, maybe I can re-express the formula. Let me see.\n\nOriginal formula: (n//3)*2 + (if remainder !=0 then 1 else 0). \n\nWait, let's see for some test cases. Let me think of examples:\n\nTest1: n=3: division gives 3/3=1, remainder 0. So total is 1*2 +0= 2.\n\nTest2: n=4: 4/3 is 1 in integer division. remainder is 1. So 1*2 +1 =3.\n\nAnother example, n=5:4*2? Wait, n=5 divided by 3 gives 1, remainder 2, so the second term is 1, so 2+1=3. \n\nAlternatively, for n=2: 0*2 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nHmm, what about n=1: 0 +1=1. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to express this without the conditional. Like the ceiling(n/3) *2 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake n=3: 3/3=1, ceiling is 1 \u2192 1*2=2. Yes. \n\nn=4: 4/3 is 1.333, ceiling 2 \u2192 2*2=4. No, that's higher than 3. So that doesn't work. Hmm, so that approach might not.\n\nTherefore, the original formula is better. So better stick with the existing formula.\n\nSo back to writing the code. \n\nAlternatively, just code the expression in one line:\n\nprint*, (n/3)*2 + iachar(mod(n,3)/=0)\n\nWait, iachar() gives the ASCII code, which would be 1 for .true.? Not sure. Wait, no, logicals in Fortran are .true. or .false. \n\nWait, perhaps better to compute it as an integer: \n\nThe term is 1 if mod(n,3) ne 0 else 0. \n\nOne way is to use the fact that (mod(n,3) .ne. 0) evaluates to 1 or 0 when converted, but maybe in Fortran, we can cast it. \n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ninteger :: term\nterm = 1\nif (mod(n,3) == 0) then\n    term =0\nend if\n\nBut that's more lines. Alternatively, use a merge function. Merging 1 and 0 based on condition mod(n,3)/=0. So that's exactly what merge is for. \n\nmerge( first, second, condition) \u2192 if condition is true, returns first. \n\nTherefore, merge(1,0,mod(n,3)/=0). So that works.\n\nAlternatively, (mod(n,3)/=0) is a logical, which can be converted to integer with nint(), but I think better to use merge. \n\nAnother approach: (mod(n,3) ==0 ) ? 0 :1: but Fortran doesn't have ternary operator, so that's why merge is needed. \n\nTherefore, putting this together in the subroutine:\n\nsubroutine solve(n)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    integer :: result\n    result = (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n    print *, result\n    return\nend subroutine solve\n\nWait, but do I need the subroutine? Alternatively, can just compute directly in the main program. Let me think.\n\nThe original code in Java has a separate solve method. So in Fortran, perhaps it's better to create a separate subroutine for it to maintain the structure, unless it's too trivial. \n\nAlternatively, just combine everything into the main program. Let's see:\n\nprogram codeforces_669A\n    implicit none\n    integer ::n, res\n    read(*,*) n\n    res = (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\n    print *, res\nend program codeforces_669A\n\nThis might be even simpler. That's more concise. \n\nWait, but the original Java code has a separate solve function. Since Fortran allows subroutine, but perhaps the code can be written both ways. \n\nThe problem might not require the subroutine, but if the user wants to keep the structure similar, maybe keeping the subroutine is better. However, since the original code just calls solve, perhaps writing the minimal Fortran code is better. \n\nLet me check the original code again. The Java code has a class with main method, then a static solve method, but in Fortran there is no class structure, so a separate function or subroutine would be okay. But perhaps it's acceptable to inline the computation in the main program. \n\nSo the minimal Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_669A\n  implicit none\n  integer ::n\n  read(*,*) n\n  print*, (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\nend program\n\nHmm, that's even better, right? Since the calculation is straightforward. So that's more concise. \n\nWait, let me test with example:\n\nTest case 1: n=3: \n\n3/3 =1, so 1*2 + merge with mod is 0 \u2192 0. So 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case, n=4: \n\n4/3 is 1 (integer division in Fortran), mod(4,3)=1 \u2192 not zero, so add 1 \u2192 2+1=3, which matches. \n\nAnother test: n=5 \u2192 5/3=1, mod=2 \u2192 so add 1 \u21921*2+1=3. \n\nWhat about n=1 \u2192 0*2 +1 \u21921. Correct. \n\nn=2: 0 +1 \u21921. \n\nn=6 \u21926/3=2 \u21922*2=4, mod is 0 \u2192 total 4. \n\nWait, for n=6, original Java code would (6/3)*2 +0 \u2192 2*2 +0=4. So correct. \n\nOkay, the formula works. \n\nThus, the Fortran code can be written without the subroutine. \n\nTherefore, the translated code would be as above. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, integer division: when you do 4/3, in Fortran, is it 1? Yes, because in integer division it truncates towards zero. So that's correct. \n\nSo the one-line print with the calculation should be okay. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nprogram codeforces_669A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    read(*,*) n\n    print *, (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\nend program codeforces_669A\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Let's see the original solve(n) is (n/3)*2 + (if n mod 3 is not zero, then 1). Alternatively, the same as (n+2)/3 * 2 ?\n\nWait, let me test:\n\nFor n=3: (3+2)/3 \u2192 5/3 =1.666 \u2192 floor to 1. 1 *2 \u2192 2. That would not help. Wait, no, (n +2)/3?\n\nWait n//3 is integer division. Wait another way to check: perhaps ( (n +2) /3 ) * 2 ? Does that give same results?\n\nLet's see n=3: (5)/3 is 1 \u2192 2, same as before.\n\nn=4 \u2192 (6/3)=2 \u2192 2*2 =4, but original was 3. Hmm no. So that's not the same. \n\nAnother approach: Let me think the formula. The current expression is (n//3)*2 + (1 if mod). \n\nLet me see for n mod 3 =0 \u2192 total is (n/3)*2 \u2192 since mod 0.\n\nElse mod 1 or 2 \u2192 then (n/3)*2 +1. \n\nAlternatively, when mod is non-zero, we add 1. \n\nAlternatively, the expression can also be written as ceiling( (2n)/3 ), but let's see:\n\nTake n=1 \u2192 ceiling(2/3)=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nn=2 \u2192 ceiling(4/3)=2 \u2192 but original formula gives 1 (since 0*2+1=1). So no. \n\nHmm, so that gives a higher value. So not the same. \n\nHmm so the initial formula is needed. \n\nBack to coding. \n\nWait, another thought: merge might be optional. Since mod(n,3) is between 0-2. So mod(n,3)! =0 \u2192 1 or 2. The function is 1 in either case. \n\nTherefore, the term is 1 if mod(n,3) >0, else 0. \n\nAlternatively, use the function (mod(n,3) >0) *1. But in Fortran, that would be:\n\nint(mod(n,3)/=0) ?\n\nWait, but converting a logical to integer would give 1 if true. \n\nWait, in Fortran, if you have a logical variable, and you add it as 1 + mylogical, would it work? Maybe not, but you can use a transfer function or... Alternatively:\n\nThe value can be expressed as: \n\n 1*(mod(n,3).ne.0)\n\nThus, the total is (n/3)*2 + (mod(n,3)/=0)\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf mod(n,3) is zero: (0 is .false \u2192 0, so adding 0. Correct. \n\nIf mod is non-zero: (true \u21921). So adding 1. \n\nYes, that would work. Because mod(n,3)/=0 is a logical variable. In Fortran, when you use it in integer arithmetic, does it automatically convert?\n\nWait, I need to confirm.\n\nFortran logical to integer conversion: \n\nIn Fortran, .true. is -1, but when converted to integer, according to the standard, when you use a logical value in an integer context, it may not directly be 1. So that's unsafe. \n\nTherefore, I cannot rely on that. Hence, better use the merge. \n\nTherefore, the original approach with merge is safer. \n\nTherefore the code is as written. \n\nSo the final Fortran code is the simple program as above. Alternatively, perhaps using the introduction of a variable for clarity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the expression ( (n+2)/3 - 1 ) * 2 +1 , but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the formula:\n\nLet me think: (n//3)*2 + if there's a remainder (1). \n\nSuppose the remainder is r = n mod3 (0,1,2). \n\nSo when r is not zero, the formula adds 1. So, the term is 1 if r=1 or 2. \n\nHence, total is (n//3)*2 + (1 if r >=1 else 0). \n\nWait, this could be equal to ( (n + 2) // 3 ) * 2 ?\n\nWait let's check:\n\nTake n=3 \u2192 (5//3)=1 \u2192 but (3//3)*2 =2. \n\nSame result. \n\nn=4: (4+2)/3=2 \u2192 2*2=4, but original was 3. \n\nHmm no. \n\nWait, that doesn't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps alternative formula:\n\nThe number of pairs or some other structure?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is the same as ceil( 2n /3 ), but let me see:\n\nFor n=1: 2/3 \u21920.666 \u2192 ceiling is 1 \u2192 matches. \n\nn=2 \u21924/3 \u2192 ceiling 2 \u2192 but original is 1. \n\nDoesn't match. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo original formula is better. \n\nThus, the code as written is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final code is the program without the subroutine. \n\nSo the translated code is:\n\nprogram codeforces_669a\n    implicit none\n    integer ::n\n    read(*, *) n\n    print *, (n/3)*2 + merge(1,0, mod(n,3)/=0)\nend program codeforces_669a\n\nWait, variable names can be lowercase, but Fortran is case-insensitive. \n\nAlternatively, using the exact variable names as in the problem may not matter. \n\nAlternatively, to make it clearer, perhaps write the print statement as \n\nprint '(i0)', ... \n\nfor better compatibility, but the default * in format should work. \n\nTesting mod(n,3)!=0. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo I think this is the correct translation."
