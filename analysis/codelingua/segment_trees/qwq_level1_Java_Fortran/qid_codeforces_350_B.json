The code does:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] == 1) {\n                st[i] = true;\n                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                int x = b[i];\n                StringBuilder sss = new StringBuilder();\n                sss.append(i);\n                sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n                int s = 1;\n                while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] ! = 1) {\n                    sss = new StringBuilder();\n                    sss.append(x);\n                    sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n                    st[x] = true;\n                    x = b[x];\n                    s++;\n                }\n                if (s > ans) {\n                    ans = s;\n                    ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nLooking here: For example, when appending \" \" + sss.reverse(), sss was initialized with a number (i's value?), so sss.reverse() reverses the characters. But if the numbers are in form *i, eg 12, so to get the digit in order, but the reverse might just be string reversal, which is not needed. Wait what is the actual intention here?",

Alternatively, in the code, when i is in the first step, they write i as a string to a variable, then reverse it (so if it's \"1\", stays same; \"123\" becomes \"321\"). Then appending the reversed string. Wait, looking at:\n\nIn the first code step for i=1 to n, when a[i] is 1:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder().append(i) \u2192 string is \"i\" (e.g. \"4\").

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n, then two arrays a and b of size n+1 (since indices start at 1 in Java here). It also has a num array that counts occurrences in b. Then it processes something involving cycles, maybe finding the longest path where each element is followed by b[i], but only if the next elements satisfy certain conditions like a[x] !=1?\n\nWait, the main loop seems to look for elements where a[i] is 1. Then it's building a string with some reversed parts. The key part is tracking sequences where starting at some a[i] =1, following the b links, and checking if each next node has num[x] ==1 (meaning that node is entered exactly once?), and also making sure the path hasn't been visited before (using the st boolean array). \n\nHmm, the code might be finding the longest path in a graph where edges are from i to b[i], but only considering nodes where a[i] can be part of the path unless a[x] was 1 again. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about Fortran specifics. Arrays in Fortran are usually 1 to n, but in the Java code, arrays go from 1 to n, and initialized to 0 since they're new int[n+1].\n\nVariables in Fortran are declared with types. The Scanner in Java is handled via input statements. Fortran uses read statements from stdin.\n\nThe st array is a boolean array, so in Fortran, perhaps an array of logicals. The num array counts the number of times each value appears in b. So for i from 1 to n, num[b[i]] is incremented. \n\nWait, the index for num in Java is b[i], which is the element stored in each position. So if b[i] is, say, 3, then num[3] is incremented each time that value occurs. But since b is 1..n elements, the indices (for num) need to be 1..n, so the size in Java is n+1, probably to avoid issues with index zero, but maybe in the problem setup the elements of b are between 1 and n. So in Fortran, num can be dimensioned (n). Wait, in Java, the num array has n+1 elements. Hmm. Maybe because the problem allows b[i] to be from 0 to n? The code initializes each element as an int, and in Java, arrays are initialized to zero by default. So in the for loop for num, for each i from 1 to n, num[b[i]]++. So if b[i] can be zero, then in Java's case the array size is n+1 so that even when b[i] is zero, it doesn't go out of bounds.\n\nWait the problem's input... Well, the code in Java may have elements read into a and b arrays starting at index 1. For the variables in the problem, I need to see. Let me think: in the Java code, when initializing the arrays a and b, the code uses n+1 as size, so indices 0 to n are technically in the array. But in the loops for input, they start at 1 and go to n. So elements 1 to n are filled, and index 0 is left as zero, but in the code, variables like b[i] in the num increment would include b[i] which is read in. So if the input allows elements of b to be zero, then the array has to be size n+1 to have index up to n (since Java arrays are 0-based, but here they use 1-based). Hmmm. Maybe in the problem, b is between 1 and n? Wait original problem (if it's codeforces problem 350B?), perhaps but regardless the code uses indices that can be up to n for b[i], so in Fortran, I need to decide the upper limit. Let me think. So the for loops in Java go up to 1 <= i <= n. So the b array elements are stored from 1 to n, and the values in b[i] could be from 0? Because if it's possible for b's element to be zero, the num array needs to account for that. But since the num array is initialized as new int[n+1], it's size n+1, so indices 0 through n.\n\nWait but in the code, in the for loops for a and b, they read n elements (since from 1 to n). So each of the a arrays and b arrays start at i=1 to n. The b array's elements can presumably take values from 0 to n (or something?), so to prevent array-out-bound errors when storing in num[b[i]], the num array is size n+1. \n\nTherefore, to port in Fortran:\n\nThe variables a, b, num need to have indices from 0 to n. Because in Fortran, arrays start at 1 by default but can be declared otherwise. To be safe, perhaps declare them to have an upper bound of n, but maybe providing a starting index. For example:\n\nIn Fortran, declaring integers a(1:n), but if the original Java uses indices from 0 to n, then perhaps:\n\ndimension a(0:n), b(0:n), num(0:n). Wait. That's an issue. Because the problem's code might have b containing 0? Let's see, in the code:\n\nIn the loop for num[b[i]]++, since i goes from 1 to n, the b[i] is the index for num. So if b[i] is 0, that refers to num[0], so we need to include that in the array.\n\nSo in Fortran, I need:\n\ninteger, dimension :: a(0:n), b(0:n), num(0:n)\n\nWait but the input loops for a and b read indices from 1 to n. Therefore, a(0) and b(0) would not be overwritten and remain zero (initialized to zero?) because in Fortran arrays are initialized to zero unless specified? Or no, in Fortran you have to initialize them explicitly. So maybe in the code, we have to explicitly set them to zero? Or proceed as variables from 0 to n, but only indices 1 to n will be used for input. That complicates a bit, but perhaps in the code, the a array is 1-based with 1 to n elements. Because:\n\nWait the original Java code uses a[1] to a[n], so in Fortran perhaps a(1:n+1) to make it similar? Wait the Java array is initialized as int[n+1], which gives indexes 0 to n because in Java arrays are 0-based. But in the loops, they run i from 1 to n, so only a[1...] and up to a[n] are filled. So in Fortran, perhaps variable a is declared with size n, indices from 1 to n. But the problem is that in the code, the num array in Java is of size n+1 (0 to n), so when they do num[b[i]]++, if b[i] can be zero (since in Java it can be stored), but in Fortran if the variables are declared starting from 1, that's okay but need to adjust indices.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem's context, the b array elements are between 1 and n because of indexes? Or maybe 0 is also possible. Without knowing the problem details, it's hard, but the existing Java code must have a reason. Let me check the original Java code's loop for the num array. \n\nThe increments are num[b[i]]++. Since in Java, the array is 0-based array with size n+1, which allows b[i] to be 0 to n (if possible). So in Fortran, to mirror that, the num array must have a length that accommodates the maximum possible b[i] value. If b[i] can be 0, then declaring num from 0 to n, like 0: n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nThe variables a and b can have indices from 1 to n (since in loops i from 1 to n), but the indices b[i] could be 0 to n. Wait, if the input for b is allowed to be zero, then in Fortran, to use b[i] as an index to num must have the num array cover 0 to n. So the num array needs to be dimensioned (n+1), with indices 0 to n.\n\nSo I think, in Fortran code:\n\nWe need to declare arrays with indices starting at 0. For example:\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: a, b, num\nWait but in Fortran, arrays have to be declared with fixed size. Wait, but n is a variable here. Oh right, so Fortran is flexible with array sizes declared dynamically. Wait, in modern Fortran (Fortran 90+), we can use allocatable arrays or automatic arrays, so perhaps.\n\nWe'll have to do something like read n first, then allocate the arrays.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, read the integer n. Then allocate arrays a, b, num of size 0 to n.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based indices but offset, but perhaps it's easier to set the lower bounds to 0.\n\nWait the code uses indices starting at 1 for the loops. So maybe declare arrays with lower bounds 1 to n for a and b, but since b can have 0 values, then the num array needs to go to 0. Hmm, this complicates, so maybe the better approach is to use arrays (0:n) for all variables.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then allocate arrays for a(0:n), but perhaps in Fortran, array indices can also start at 1. Alternatively, to start at zero, can declare as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: a, b, num\n\nBut the problem is that in Fortran you can't have a variable in the dimension until you know the value after input. So it's easier with allocatable arrays.\n\nFirst part of code:\n\nRead(n)\n\nThen:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: a(:), b(:), num(:)\n\nallocate( a(0:n), b(0:n), num(0:n) )\n\nBut the loops for reading a and b's elements:\n\nIn the original code, the loops are for i from 1 to n.\n\nSo in Fortran, the loops would be:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   read(*,*) a(i)\n\nend do\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nBut a(0) and b(0) can stay zero (since only positions 1 to n are set, they can be undefined except a[0] which was allocated but not read. But in the num array, when they process the b array's elements (which are 1 base in the code?), maybe not.\n\nWait the original Java code for the b array reads into b[i], which is 1-based, but their indices could have values from 0 to n? Let's see:\n\nLooking back at the code's line in Java: for (int i =1 to n: b[i] = scanner.nextInt(). So the elements entered for b are stored from index 1 to n. However, the value of b[i] could be 0, since the Scanner just reads whatever integer the user inputs, so it can be anything. The code then uses this b array to address num's indices. So if any of the b elements are zero, then the 'num' array at 0 will be incremented. Hence, in Fortran, num has elements from 0 to n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran code:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate arrays a(0:n), b(0:n), num(0:n)\n\nInitialize num to zero initially:\n\nnum(:) = 0\n\nThen read a and b from 1 to n.\n\nOnce that's done, for (i from 1 to n):\n\nnum(b(i)) = num(b(i)) +1\n\nOkay, then we go into the rest.\n\nNext variables and the main loop:\n\nString ss is to hold a reversed sequence of indices? Let's see the code's logic:\n\nThe code uses a StringBuilder, appends string, then reverses it. So in Fortran, since there's no dynamic strings, perhaps character(len=2000) or some sufficiently long string, and building it via allocating an array or constructing.\n\nAlternatively maybe using an array to collect the indices and then reverse.\n\nHmm, dealing with string in Fortran can be a bit tricky. The code builds the sequence as string in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nInitially ss = \"\";\n\nans =0.\n\nst is a boolean array (logical in Fortran).\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n:\n\nif a(i) ==1:\n\nthen proceed to find the sequence.\n\nst array is initialized to false, except the ones set here.\n\nWait:\n\nInitially st[i] = false for all, except being set to true once in loops.\n\nWait the code's first part:\n\nfor (int i=1 to n: st[i] = false? No, Java default initializes the boolean array to false, so the initial state is all false.\n\nIn the loop, first marking st[i] as true (since a[i] is 1) and then follows the chain.\n\nIn Fortran, the st array can be declared as logical, dimension st(0:n) with allocation as before. Initialize all to .false. ?\n\nWait the loop in Java for i from 1 to n for num[b[i]] incremented. \n\nIn the code, the main processing loop:\n\nfor (i in 1..n):\n\nif a[i] ==1:\n\nthen new variables:\n\nString s = \"\"\n\nWait no:\n\nThe initial code:\n\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n\nString sss is initially \"\".\n\nsss is used to create string representations of the current index.\n\nWait let's try to breakup the code.\n\nInside the a[i] ==1 case:\n\nst[i] = true\n\nthen a new temp string is built:\n\nsss is new with .append( i ), then sss is reversed? Because the code's line:\n\nsss.append(i); then \" + sss.reverse()\" ?\n\nWait the code first does: sss is initialized with new StringBuilder().append(i), so sss is the string form of i. Then, the<String> reverse() method returns the reversed string. Wait but the length of the number might be such that reversed(\"123\") is \"321\". So that's probably a mistake. For example, if the number is 1, reversed gives same, but if 12 then it becomes 21, but that's not correct. Wait the Java code's intention is unclear here. Let me look again.\n\nThe code does:\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            if (a[i] == 1) {\n                st[i] = true;\n                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                int x = b[i];\n                StringBuilder sss = new StringBuilder();\n                sss.append(i);\n                sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n                int s = 1;\n                while (!st[x] && num[x] == 1 && x != 0 && a[x] != 1) {\n                    sss = new StringBuilder();\n                    sss.append(x);\n                    sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n                    st[x] = true;\n                    x = b[x];\n                    s++;\n                }\n                if (s > ans) {\n                    ans = s;\n                    ss = sb.reverse().toString();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nLooking here: For example, when appending \" \" + sss.reverse(), sss was initialized with a number (i's value?), so sss.reverse() reverses the characters. But if the numbers are in form *i, eg 12, so to get the digit in order, but the reverse might just be string reversal, which is not needed. Wait what is the actual intention here?\n\nWait, the code uses sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse()). The sss's string is the current number, perhaps to reverse its digits? That's odd. Wait maybe that's a mistake in the code, but perhaps it's copied from the problem. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to reverse the sequence so that the path is stored backwards? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the process:\n\nInitially:\n\nsb starts with \" \" + sss.reverse(), where sss is the i's number as a string, but reversed, then concatenated with a space. So if the current i is, say, 3, then \"3\" reversed is still \"3\", so the (first part) is \" 3\". Then the loop adds the next elements by reversing each x's string as well. But then, at the end, the sb is *reverses the entire entire string* before storage. E.g., if the sb after all steps was \" 3 \u21924\u21925\", then reversing would give \"5\u21924\u21923 \".\n\nHmm confusing. Maybe the code has some logic errors, but to port it faithfully without changing logic.\n\nSince this code is supposed to be translated exactly, including any bugs, the approach here is to port the exact logic.\n\nTo handle the string-based reversed numbering, in Fortran:\n\nFor each number, we need to get its string representation, reverse it, and append it to a temporary buffer, then append to the main buffer with a space.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIn Fortran, converting an integer to a string is done via write formatted, then perhaps with adjustl or trim. But to handle reversing the digits:\n\nexample: For a number like 123, reversing the digits would require converting it to a string, then reversing characters. Let's say the variable k is an integer. \n\nIn Fortran, we can write the number into a character variable, then reverse the characters.\n\nSo for each x, the process is:\n\nconvert x to string, then reverse the characters to get sss reversed, then add that part to the string. \n\nAlternatively, in the code, when i is in the first step, they write i as a string to a variable, then reverse it (so if it's \"1\", stays same; \"123\" becomes \"321\"). Then appending the reversed string. \n\nWait, looking at:\n\nIn the first code step for i=1 to n, when a[i] is 1:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder().append(i) \u2192 string is \"i\" (e.g. \"4\").\n\nThen reversed \u2192 \"4\" still, then sb.append( \" \" + sss).\n\nThen in the while loop, for each x (the next nodes), it appends similar after appending.\n\nAt the end, when \"sb\" is built reverse the entire buffer?\n\nHmm, The code uses sb.reverse(). The entire string is reversed. So perhaps the code is constructing a string with each part's reversed, then reversed again? \n\nThe exact logic may be tricky, but I have to port it as per the code provided.\n\nBut how to do this in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reverse operations are not needed and the code has a flaw, but the problem is to re-express it exactly.\n\nFor handling the string, perhaps use arrays to temporarily hold the sequence indices, then reverse them at the end.\n\nBecause for each loop iteration, the code builds a path (starting from the initial i, then following b's links).\n\nOne approach:\n\nCollect the sequence of indices (starting at the initial i, then proceeding until loop condition fails) into an array, and then reverse that array for the final string.\n\nIn the Java code's process, the sb is building a list as reversed on each step. Maybe the final reversal is intended to straighten it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nThe current path is being stored in reverse order, then the final reversal gives back the list in correct order, then to be stored in ss if it's the longest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reversed calls mean that in the end, the string is stored in the correct order. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the path is 1 \u21925 \u21927 \u21929.\n\nThe Java code first appends the reversed of each step?\n\nFirst, initial node is 1:\n\n- the code appends \" \" + reverse(\"1\") \u2192 \" 1\"\n\nThen, the next node (x = b[i]), say next node is 5:\n\nNow they create sss = \"5\" reversed (still \"5\") \u2192 \" 5\", so after appending to sb, it's \" 1 5\" in the sb's content.\n\nWait but in the loop:\n\nIn the while loop, the process is:\n\ndoing loops that appends:\n\nstring of x's number reversed.\n\nBut then every part is added in sequence, but reversed.\n\nWait inside the loop:\n\nThe first iteration of the loop for the next x is:\n\n             sb.append(\" \" + sss.reverse());\n\nwhere sss is for the new x (like the second element). The first element (i) is already added.\n\nWait let me analyze:\n\nInitially, the program does:\n\n sb is initially empty? Or starts with \" \" + reversed of i's string (yes).\n\nSo after starting, the sb contains \" <reversed i>\" (space + reversed string of i's value.)\n\nWait the first step after 'i' in the code:\n\nFirst, st[i]=true.\n\nthen sb starts with \" \" + sss.reverse(). The sss for i is the number + reversed, but perhaps the code is doing this to just add the reversed, but the reversed of the integer as a string would not change its numeric value. But adding the reversed as a form *might* be part of the string logic to get the desired order.\n\nAlternatively, the code has a bug and the 'reverse()' on the stringbuilders are not intended, but since we have to translate it precisely, we need to replicate this effect.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the code's logic is wrong, but our job is to translate as per the code.\n\nSo in any case, the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the integer to a string, reverse it.\n\n2. Add the reversed string (with a leading space?) to the overall string.\n\n3. Then, at the end of building a sequence, reverse *the entire current sb*.\n\nSo the resulting string is the reverse of all the reversed strings added.\n\nWait, for example, if the sequence is 3, then 2, then 1:\n\nThe code first adds '3' (since sss.reverse would (for number 3 as '3', it stays '3') reversed is same. \n\nThen for next elements, say the x is 2, and append the reversed (2 \u2192 \"2\"), then x=1 and reversed (1 \u21921).\n\nSo after all steps, the sb would have:\n\n\" 3\" (from initial)\n\nthen on next elements, \" 2\" and \" 1\".\n\nThe total sb would be \" 3 2 1\", then reversed becomes \"1 2 3 \", but with a leading space?\n\nHmm, the actual process may require careful retracing.\n\nAlternatively, the final 'sb.reverse()' is essentially reversing each individual number's reversed, thus getting back to the original numbers in the path's order, but reversed.\n\nAlternatively, to make this manageable in Fortran, perhaps instead of dealing with reversed strings, collect the indices in an array (list) in the order, then at the end reverse the list and format the string accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the code uses the 'reversed' as a mistake and the overall output is just the path in order, but in code's Java it is built through reversed steps for some reason. Perhaps the actual path's indices are collected in reverse and thus reversed again. \n\nGiven the difficulty here, perhaps the best way is to:\n\n- collect all the indices in a temporary array. The path is followed starting from the initial node and moving to next nodes, storing each element in the path into an array (reverse the order here?), then when storing, reverse the array and output the indices sequentially separated by spaces.\n\nAlternatively, given all this, perhaps an approach in Fortran:\n\nInstead of using strings, track the current path's indices in a dynamic list. Since Fortran arrays are fixed, but maybe start with a temporary array big enough.\n\nSuppose the maximum possible path length is N (since 'n' in input), so we can have an array PATH of size N.\n\nThen, for each start node i:\n\nReset st array for the run?\n\nWait the original code uses boolean array st which marks visited nodes. Because in the while loop:\n\nwe have a condition while (!st[x]...). So st is marked true for nodes as we form *this path's elements. But since in Fortran's variables are static (assuming no re-initialization), perhaps the st array is re-initialized each time the main loop for i runs?\n\nWait, in the Java code's main loop:\n\nThe st array was initialized once, right?\n\nThe code declares \"boolean st[] = new boolean[n + 1];\" (one time before main loop), so each test of a[i]==1 will mark some st entries as true, but once. So the code may have an error here. Because for example, if in a first iteration of a[i] where i is part of some path, st is left marked as true, possibly preventing subsequent paths from being processed.\n\nWait, looking at code's variables:\n\nst is initialized as new boolean[n+1], which starts with all false.\n\nIn each of the a[i] == (1) handling steps, st[i] = true.\n\nThen the next nodes are marked.\n\nBut for subsequent a[j] ==1, they may pick a path that overlaps? Because the st array is not being reset. That would mean the code is incorrect, but according to the code's design, perhaps this is intentional? Because otherwise, when another a[j] is 1 and starts walking a path that has nodes already marked as touched in st (from previous runs), the code would stop.\n\nWait that might be incorrect. If a different starting point can form a path by not using those nodes previously used, then this is wrong. Because once a node is marked with st[x]=true, any other path after that cannot use it again for other a's.\n\nHence the code may be flawed, but as the user wanted to translate the code exactly, including any flaws, we must carry that over.\n\nThis suggests that the st array must be repeatedly marked as true in all run through the paths, thus accumulating the marks over multiple runs, leading to paths possibly being undercounted.\n\nHowever, when calculating the maximum path length, only the first path might get a chance to walk, but subsequent ones can't.\n\nBut in the code's logic, it seems that every path is being tried, and the 'st' array is not being re-initialized. Since it's a Java array, it remains in the marked state between iterations, leading to wrong results, but since the user wants the same code, that must be preserved in the Fortran translation.\n\nThus, in Fortran, need to implement the same behavior.\n\nNow, approaching the string part again:\n\nTo build the sequence of indices in the path:\n\nEach time the path is followed (from the starting i to b[i], b[b[i]] etc. until conditions stop), we can store the indices in an array. So perhaps, inside each processing block (for an a[i]==1 node), the indices are stored in a array (let's say 'current_path'), then:\n\nthe length s is the count (already tracked), and if this is the longest s, then the current_path array is processed to write the string to ss.\n\nIn the code's current string approach, using reversed numbers, etc., perhaps the actual order is stored.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indices should be stored in the array in the order they are visited (starting with i, then next nodes), and then the sequence is written as \"<x1> <x2> ... <xk> \", but reversed in the string due to the code's logic.\n\nWait in the code the first character is a space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current code's intended logic is reverse-reversing:\n\nEach time adding the reversed string of the current x, then returning the entire string's reversed, leading to each x's string being reversed again, effectively resulting in the correct order. For example, the path is 1 \u21922\u21923 \u21924:\n\nBuilding each step's reversed string:\n\n- for x=1: revStr(1) \u2192 \"1\", added as \" 1\" \u2192 sb becomes \" 1\".\n\nThen next x=2 (next in loop):\n\nAppend the reversed \"2\" \u2192 \" 2\" \u2192 sb becomes \" 1 2\".\n\nNext x=3 \u2192 \" 3\", adding gives \" 1 2 3\".\n\nNext x=4 \u2192 \" 4\": Total is \" 1 2 3 4\".\n\nWait then the final reversal of the entire string would be \"4 3 2 1 \".\n\nHmm so the final ss holds the reversed path, but the original loop appends in forward direction but reversed the individual strings, then the code appends in forward direction but after the entire string's reverse.\n\nHmm. So the 'ss' for that example would be \"4 3 2 1\".\n\nWait no:\n\nWait the code's sb after all append calls would have the parts as \" 1 2 3 4\" (because each step's reversed had added them backward or not). Then when we call sb.reverse().toString():\n\nthe string \" 1 2 3 4 \" (assuming leading space) would become the reverse of each character, so spaces and numbers:\n\nFirst, the entire string is reversed:\n\nSuppose it's like \" 1 234\", reversing all characters:\n\nFor example, the entire string is \" 1 2 3 4\" (each number separated by spaces), reversing it would give \"4 3 2 1 \" (with trailing space). So the 'ss' ends up storing the path in reverse order?\n\nWait the desired path is starting at 'i =1' then going to 2, then 3 then 4, but the path would be written in reversed order.\n\nHmm, looks like it's storing the path in the direction opposite to the traversal. So the final stored ss is the sequence written with numbering in the backwards direction of the path? Or maybe I have it wrong.\n\nWell, to ensure the code's translated version does the same, perhaps the easiest approach is to track the current elements in an array in the order they are visited, then reverse the array and build the string from that reversed array, using the reversed numbers?\n\nThis can get messy.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran solution, whenever the code appends to sb, we can track an array of indices in order, then reverse that array to get the sequence for the string, then format the numbers in order.\n\nAlternatively, since the code's final sb is being reversed, then the resulting 'ss' is the reversed of all the appends up to than point. So whatever order the appends are in, the final ss is reversed.\n\nTherefore in the temp array, the indices collected in the order of ____, and then the string is printed in reverse.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose the path is [i, x1, x2, ..., xk], the first element is i which is first processed:\n\nThe code first appends \" \" + reversed( i ), so in the string that part is \" reversed(i) \" (with leading space). Then adds \" \" + reversed(x1 ), so overall \" reversed(i) reversed(x1) \" followed by the other elements. The entire string after all is then reversed, the result would be that the order of characters (i.e., each reversed number, but then the whole string reversed):\n\nLet's see:\n\nLet me take an actual small example.\n\nSuppose the path is 3 \u21922\u21921 .\n\ni is 3.\n\nThe process:\n\nFirst:\n\nsss = i (3). reversed is \"3\". sb is initialized by appending \" \" + sss.reverse \u2192 \" 3\".\n\nThe first step's appending is \" \" + sss (since sss is after append (i) and reverse). \n\nWait initially, the code has:\n\nsss is StringBuilder().append( i ), then sss.reverse().toString() ?\n\nWait in Java, sss is new, then appending the current x (first is i). Then reversed.\n\nWait, in Java:\n\nsss = new StringBuilder(); sss.append(i); sss is the string of the number i.\n\nthen sss.reverse() returns the reversed string of this number. So the part appended is \" \" + reversed.\n\nBut for a number like 12, the reversed would be \"21\".\n\nAfter the first step, the sb becomes \" 21\".\n\nThen in the while loop processing the x = b[i], say next number is 2 (reversed is \"2\"). Then append \" \" + \"2\", so sb is now \" 21 2\".\n\nThen if the next is 1 \u2192 reversed is \"1\" \u2192 append to make \" 21 2 1\".\n\nThen total is \" 21 2 1\", then reversing the whole string sb.reverse() would be \"1 2 21 \" (reversing all the characters). So the final result is \"1 2 21 \" ?\n\nBut that's probably not desired. This suggests the code may have a bug here. However, it's our job to translate it as is.\n\nGiven this complexity, perhaps instead of worrying about reversing numbers, we should just track the array of nodes in the path as they are visited, and construct the string as:\n\n' ' followed by number.toString() reversed for each node, then reversing the entire string.\n\nWait but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps use a temporary array 'nodes' to record the indices in the path in the order they are visited (starting at i, then moving to x = b[i], etc.). Then once the path is recorded, we can:\n\nConstruct the string as the reverse of the nodes (since the code's appends them in order, then reverses the entire buffer.\n\nWait in the code example for nodes [i, x1, ..., xk], their appends are done in the order i first, then x1, x2, etc. But each step's addition is appending the x's string reversed, thus the sequence in the buffer is [i_reversed, x1_reversed, ... xk_reversed], but then reversed again, so the final string becomes the reversed of all.\n\nWait the process is:\n\n1. Collect all elements (indices) in order path: path = [i, x, ...], where x = b[i], and so on.\n\n2. Each element of the path is converted to its reversed string.\n\n3. These reversed strings are joined with spaces (leading space for each term).\n\n4. The entire resulting string is then reversed, which effectively reverses each character and the order of elements. \n\nTherefore, the result is the inversion of all steps.\n\nBut this is very tricky. So perhaps the easiest way in Fortran is to:\n\n- for each path's elements (indexes), collect them in the order as they're followed (i, x1, x2, ...). This gives a list.\n\n- then reverse this list (so it is [xk, etc., x1, i])\n\n- then, for each element in this reversed list, we can write its integer as a string to a buffer, then concatenate them with spaces between.\n\nWait no. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the code's reversing of each element and then the total results in the path being stored in reversed order. For example:\n\nOriginal path is i=3 \u2192 next x is 2 \u2192 next is 1 (terminates):\n\nThe code appends \"3\" reversed (still \"3\"), then the x=2's reversed \"2\" and x=1's reversed \"1\". So the sb has \"3\" (first), then space \"2\", then space \"1\".\n\nWait the actual string sequence would be: \" 3 2 1\" (starting with first is \" 3\" and then appends other parts). The entire string's reverse would be the string read backward including each character, which gives \"1 2 3 \" (with a trailing space). So the result was the reversed list:1 comes first.\n\nThus, the stored path is the reversed order of the path's actual nodes.\n\nSo the code's result 'ss' ends up with the path written as the reverse of the actual path's order. \n\nBecause in code's logic, the sequence is stored reversed (so the path is printed in reverse order). So the actual longest path is from i to ... to x, but stored as the reverse inside 'ss'. The 'ans' stores the correct count.\n\nHmm, but the problem requires that the answer is the correct count and the sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual approach is that the code's process builds the path's order in reverse, and then the string is built accordingly. \n\nTo proceed in Fortran:\n\nThe main steps:\n\n1. Read n, allocate arrays.\n\n2. Read the a and b arrays.\n\n3. Initialize the num array: count frequency of each b[i]\n\n4. Initialize the st logical array to all false (except initialized to false by default? No, in Fortran variables are undefined unless. Should set to false by a loop).\n\nWait, in the Java code, after declaring the st array, all elements are false. In Fortran, to do that:\n\nallocate st(0:n)\n\nThen need to initialize all st elements as .false.:\n\nst = .false.\n\n5. For each starting i where a(i) ==1, do as per code.\n\nInside the loop over i:\n\n- check if a(i) is 1.\n\n- then mark st(i) as true\n\n- collect the path's nodes (starting from i and proceeding via b[i] until conditions stop)\n\n- track the nodes in an order, and the count s.\n\nOnce a path is found (with count s), compare to ans and keep the maximum, and keep the path's string if it's the longest.\n\nThe critical steps are:\n\nCollecting the path nodes.\n\nFor collecting the path nodes:\n\nWe can have an array (temp_list) to store the indices in order (i followed by x, ...), and for each step of the process:\n\n- x starts as b(i).\n\n- while the next conditions hold:\n\n   - If st(x) is false, and num(x) is exactly 1, and x is not 0, and a(x) is not 1 \u2192 then we proceed.\n\n   At each step, we need to do:\n\n   - append the current x to the temp_list array.\n\n   - mark st(x) as true (so no other paths can use again this x, due to the incorrect code handling).\n\n   - go to next x = b(x).\n\nWait in the code's while loop:\n\nThe loop is :\n\nwhile ( !st[x] && num[x] ==1 && x !=0 && a[x] !=1 ) {\n\n   do processing (mark, etc.)\n\n}\n\nWait, the loop continues as long as all those conditions are *true*. So in each iteration:\n\n- check if x's next step is valid.\n\nInside the loop body:\n\n- adds x's reversed string, marks st[x] = true, sets x = b(x), increment s++, and loops.\n\nWait initially for the path:\n\nthe first x after i is b[i], but in the while condition, the conditions:\n\nst[x] is false (since before the loop.\n\nx is not 0, etc.\n\nso in code:\n\nProcess:\n\n   int x = b[i]; --> the first next element.\n\nThen, the while loop:\n\nFirst condition is check whether we can add x:\n\n   while ( not st[x] and ... ) then:\n\n       add the x in the temp sequence.\n\n       mark st[x] for this iteration.\n\n       then set x to next.\n\nWait in effect:\n\nThe while loop does the following steps:\n\n   while (x can be added (viable)):\n\n      process x (add to path, mark it, then go to next x).\n\nThe initial x is the first step after i.\n\nSo the path from i is the starting point, then the first x =b[i], then b[b[i]], etc.\n\nThe code in Java:\n\nthe temp sequence is started with sb containing \" 3\", then for x, which is next node, then followed.\n\nThe variables are:\n\nThe current path is from the start node i, followed by x's elements.\n\nSo to track this in Fortran:\n\nWe need to:\n\n- create an array to store path elements, and then when storing the longest, use that array reversed (if needed).\n\nPerhaps for the given problem, to port the code precisely:\n\nInstead of string reversal, we can collect the elements in the path's array in the same way the code's string builders do (order is correct?), then loop backwards (reverse order) to build the string.\n\nLet's proceed step by step for the Fortran code.\n\nVariables and steps in FORTAN:\n\nStart with declaring needed variables.\n\nprogram codeforces_350_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, x, s, ans = 0, tmp_size\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, num\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: st\ncharacter(len=2000) :: ss = '  ', temp_str = ''\n\n!

However, in my Fortran example's code, in the path_array's 'i' is the first element and reversed, etc.\n\nBut the code's loop inside the while loop adds nodes in sequence:\n\nthe first iteration appends the x to the path_array (path_array(2)=x), and so on.\n\nSo the path_array(1) is the initial i, then the next elements as they follow.\n\nThen in formulating temp_path_str by going over path_array to get the reversed numbers in order, but the string built is \"reversed_i reversed_x etc.\"\n\nThen the entire string is reversed, so each reversed component's reversed are reversed again, returning them to the original digits, but the order is reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps with the code's logic:\n\nTake each element in the path (elements are ordered as i, x1, x2 ...), \n\neach element is converted to a string, reversed (exposing the actual number's digits reversed).\n\n Then the reversed parts are appended in the order i followed by x1 etc. creating i_reversed_string followed by x1_reversed_string etc.\n\nThen the entire string is reversed, getting each reversed parts' characters reversed again, leading each element's sting to return to their original, but the sequence of elements is reversed.\n\nE.g (for elements 3, then 2, then 1):\n\n reversed(3) is '3, 2 becomes '2, l '1.\n\n the sequence of appended reversed_strs is '3 \u21922\u21921' \u2192 so temp_path_str is:\n\n \" 3 2 1\"\n\n then reversing the entire string would give \"12 3 \", but more precisely the string would be \"3 \u2192 separator and so on\".\n\nWait, in the example above, the cumulative temp_path_str would be: \"3\" after first step (the path_array's first element is \"3\", reversed gives \"3\").\n\n Then adding the next x:\n\n If the while loop added x (say b[i] is 2, so the path would a have path_array become [3,2], then next x becomes b(2)=1, so path becomes [3,2,1].\n\n Then, the temp_path_str begins as:\n\nBuild for path elements 3,2,1:\n\nFor each of the elements in path_array, \n\nWhen processing each val (3 \u2192 first step):\n\nval_str of '3' \u2192 reversed is '3'.\n\nNext is '2' \u2192 reversed '2', and then '1' \u2192 reversed '1'.\n\nThe combined temp_path_str becomes:\n\nInitially empty, then loop over index 1 to 3:\n\nafter first iteration:\n\ntemp_path_str is ' 3' \u2192 appending '3' with space.\n\n Wait:\n\n First iteration:\n\n temp_path_str starts as ''\n\n first element:\n\n val=3 \u2192 val_str is '3', reversed is '3'.\n\n adding to temp_path_str: ' '// '3' \u2192 ' 3' (assuming starting from an empty string, the write is ' 3')\n\n Wait no: code above in the temp_str section:\n\n Or wait the code would have 'temp_str' as initialized in reverse_string and all...\n\nHmm, my above code may have error in building temp_str.\n\nIn the example:\n\nfor array [3,2,1], the loop:\n\ncurrent_s=1, val=3 \u2192 '3' reversed still '3', so temp_path_str becomes \"3\" with extra parts?\n\nWait the code written above for building the temp_path_str:\n\nInitially empty, then for each value:\n\ntemp_path_str = trim(temp_path_str) // ' ' // trim(reversed_val_str)\n\nSo first element:\n\ntemp_path_str starts empty \u2192 trimmed to nothing, then ' ' & reversed_str of \"3\" \u2192 overall \" 3\".\n\nSecond element (current_s=2 \u2192 val=2: reversed string is \"2\", the total becomes \" 3 2\".\n\nThird element \u2192 val=1 \u2192 \"1\", the string is \" 3 2 1\".\n\nThen, after looping, the temp_path_str is the same as in the Java code's sb's value before reverse.\n\nThen the code reverses it, which would become \"1 2 3 \" (assuming the trailing space is on top of the trailing space from the last item).\n\nThus, it matches the example: the stored string would be the reversed sequence of the path's nodes, and the order is 1 followed by 2, then 3.\n\nHence, the sequence when stored is '1 2 3 ' reversed out, but since the actual maximum path is length 3 here, the ans is also correct.\n\nTherefore, this code approach would replicate the code's string-processing.\n\nThus the Fortran code would include a function to reverse a string.\n\nAlso, need to account for the maximum length for temp arrays.\n\nAlso, handling arrays in Fortran:\n\nThe path_array is allocated inside the loop for each i. But maybe it can be an allocatable array.\n\nI'll have to define the reverse_string function.\n\nFunction to reverse a string in Fortran:\n\npure function reverse_string(s) result(rev_str)\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n    character(len=len_trim(s)) :: rev_str\n    integer :: i, l\n    l = len_trim(s)\n    rev_str = ' '\n    do i = 1, l\n        rev_str(i:i) = s(l - i + 1:len_trim(s))\n    end do\nend function reverse_string\n\nWait, or perhaps more simply:\n\nrev_str = s( len_trim(s):1: -1 )\n\nbut in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps using character arrays.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAnother approach for reverse_string function:\n\nfunction reverse_string(s_in) result(s_out)\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: s_in\n\ncharacter(len=len(s_in)) :: s_out\n\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s_in)\n\ns_out = ' ' * len_s\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n   s_out(i:i) = s_in(len_s -i +1:len_s -i +1)\n\nend do\n\nend function\n\nThis function will take the input string, and return the reversed version.\n\nWith this function, the code can handle the reversing.\n\nNow putting it all together with correct:\n\nWait also, in the code:\n\nWhen the temporary array is allocated with \"path_array(0:n)\", the array's initial size is up to N, but in the code, the loop accumulates to \"index\" up to s.\n\nThus, I think (for the code to work):\n\nThus in the main program, the path_array is allocated.\n\nBut in that example of code, possible off-by-index.\n\nAlternatively using the path_array of size n+1.\n\nAlso, during storage of the path_array, after processing:\n\nThe allocation was made with path_array(0:n), but in the code above:\n\n allocate(path_array(0:n)) \u2192 do we need index?\n\nThe variables are declared as integer, dimension(:), and each allocated.\n\nBut the indices can be from 1 to n+1? Need to handle carefully.\n\nWait in the block:\n\nallocate( path_array(0:n) )\n\nThen the:\n\npath_array(1) =i, index=1.\n\nThe next elements:\n\nindex increases up to <= n ?\n\nHard to see problem.\n\nAn alternative way to code the while loop's section:\n\nThe code:\n\nInitially:\n\npath(1) =i, then index=1.\n\nx = b(i).\n\nThen in the while loop:\n\n          index = index +1\n\n          path_array(index) =x\n\n          st(x) = .true.\n\n          x= b(x)\n\n          s= s+1 \n\n          continue as long as conditions are met.\n\nThe loop continues until the next conditions are no longer true.\n\nThis means that the path_array is filled with path elements index from 1 to index_final.\n\nThus, to build the string correctly.\n\nOther considerations:\n\nThe 'st' array is being set to true for nodes in different paths, but this is as per the original Java's logic which is incorrect but we need to replicate it.\n\nTotal steps:\n\nNow, the code in Fortran:\n\nAllow me to reconstruct it properly.\n\nDefine the reverse function first:\n\nThen:\n\nThen the main code:\n\nprogram codeforces_350_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, x, s, ans =0\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, num, path_array\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: st\n\ncharacter(len=2000) :: ss = '', temp_str\n\ncharacter(len=12) :: num_str\n\ncontains\n\n    !
