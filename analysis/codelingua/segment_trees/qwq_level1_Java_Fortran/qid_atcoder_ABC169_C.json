Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program takes two inputs: a long integer a and a string b. Then it processes the string b by removing any '.' characters, converts the result to an integer, multiplies it by a, and then divides by 100, outputting the result.\n\nAlright, so in Fortran, I need to replicate this functionality. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, reading the inputs. In Java, they used a Scanner. In Fortran, I can read from standard input using read(*,*) or similar statements. The first input is a long, which in Fortran is an integer*8. The second input is a string. But wait, in Fortran, reading strings can be tricky. Since the input might have a '.' and some digits, maybe it's better to read it as a string and then process it.\n\nSo the first line would be reading a and then the string. But Fortran's read statement can read strings with some caution. Let me check how to read two values in one statement. Maybe something like:\n\nread *, a, b\n\nBut the second input might be a string that includes a dot. Hmm, but in Fortran, when you read with a format, you can specify the type of each variable. Alternatively, maybe read the entire line as a string first and then parse it? Wait, maybe better to separate the two inputs. Like read the first number, then read the string. Because if they are separated by a space, perhaps the first is the number and then the string comes next. Let's see. In the Java code, they used sc.nextLong() and then sc.next(), which suggests that the first value is the long, then the next token (the string). So in Fortran, I can read it as:\n\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nBut the problem here could be if the string contains numbers. Wait, no. The string is read as a character array or a string variable. Wait, in Fortran, if you read a string with *, it might read until the end of line, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, maybe using list-directed input (the default read format). The string in Java is \"b = sc.next();\" which is the next token, so it can be either a word or until space. So perhaps in Fortran, using list-directed input, the same approach would work. So the first input can be an integer (or integer*8 for the long), then the second is a string.\n\nWait, Fortran variables have to be declared. So first, declare variables: a as integer*8, and b as a character array or a string.\n\nPerhaps declare:\n\ninteger*8 a\ncharacter(len=255) :: b\n\nThen read: read(*,*) a, b\n\nBut wait, the second input might be something like \"123.45\", so the string would include digits and a '.' character. List-directed input will read until the next whitespace. But the next token would be the entire string like \"123.45\".\n\nOkay, perhaps this works. Then next step, process the string b to remove '.' characters. The Java code loops through each character in the string and appends to bStr if it's not '.'. The resulting bStr is converted to an integer, multiplied by a, then divided by 100, and printed.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are a bit more cumbersome. So the steps are: take the input string, iterate over each character, check if it's not '.' (or a period), and collect the digits into a new string. Then convert that new string to an integer. Multiply by a, divide by 100, then output.\n\nHmm. So first, process the string b to remove '.' characters. Let's see. The original Java code uses a for loop from 0 to length-1 (since in Java strings are 0-based). In Fortran, strings are 1-based, so need to be careful with indices.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the string processing:\n\nInitialize a new string (or in Fortran, a character array maybe) to hold the digits. Then loop through each character in the input string b, and if it's not a '.', append it to the new string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be assigned, but perhaps using a temporally array. Since we don't know the length in advance, maybe we can first find the length after removing '.'s, then allocate a new character array, or maybe use a string with a sufficient size and trim it later.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, character variables can be concatenated using write and then read back, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nFirst, find the length of b without the '.' which would be len_trim(b) - count of '.' in the string. Let's first loop through each character and count the non '.' characters. Then allocate a temporary character array of that size, and then build the new string.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, assuming we are using a fixed length character variable. Alternatively, maybe a better way:\n\nSuppose the input string b is up to, say, 20 characters. Since it's a currency amount, probably okay. Let me think of maximum possible length. Let's see: in Java, they just used a string, so perhaps in Fortran, using a variable like:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: b, new_str\n\nthen loop through each character:\n\nnew_str = ''\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(b)\n   c = b(i:i)\n   if (c /= '.') then\n      new_str = trim(new_str) // c\n   end if\nend do\n\nWait, but string concatenation in Fortran can be done with concatenation operator //, but the left side (new_str) has to be handled properly. Because if new_str has trailing spaces (since it's a fixed-length string in Fortran). For example, if new_str is initially all blanks, then when you assign new_str = trim(new_str) // c, it combines the trimmed (no trailing blanks) part with c. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, the initial new_str should be initialized as empty. Suppose the maximum length of new_str is known in advance. Let's say that the input b can be up to say 10 digits plus a '.' and some more digits. The maximum possible length after removing the '.' would be say 15 characters. So define the new_str as a character(len=something) variable, initialized as blanks. Then after processing, the actual digits are in front, and we can use only the non-blank part later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a temporary character array to build the string, and then convert it to new_str. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, here's the step:\n\nFirst, find the non '.' characters count (n). Then create an array of size n, collect the characters there. Then, convert that to an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps an array of characters. Let's see. For example:\n\nThe original string is stored in b. Let's loop through each character in b, count the digits (excluding '.') first, allocate a new character array of size n, then fill it in order.\n\nAlternatively, here's code:\n\ninteger :: i, len_b, count\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\ncharacter(len=100) :: new_str\n\ncount = 0\nlen_b = len_trim(b)\ndo i = 1, len_b\n    c = b(i:i)\n    if (c /= '.') then\n        count = count +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nallocate (char_array(count))   ! Wait, but in Fortran, allocatable arrays need to be declared so.\n\nHmm, perhaps let me see:\n\nFirst, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Iterate through b to create new_str that excludes '.'.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n// Declare new_str as a sufficiently large character array, say 20 characters:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: new_str\nnew_str = \"\" ???\n\nBut in Fortran, initializing a character to empty may not be straightforward. Instead, perhaps start with blanks and then count and build.\n\nWait, here's another approach. Since the final result after removing '.' is the numeric part for bInt. So the value of new_str is the concatenation of all the characters except '.' in b.\n\nSo in code:\n\nnew_str = \"\"\ndo i = 1, len_trim(b)\n    if (b(i:i) /= '.') then\n        new_str = trim(new_str) // b(i:i)\n    endif\nenddo\n\nBut in Fortran, the variable new_str has a fixed length (say, len=100), so when initialized as all blanks, the first assignment would be:\n\nnew_str = adjustl(new_str) // ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps let's see with an example. Suppose new_str is declared with len 10, initialized as all blanks. The first character not '.' would be, say, '1' then new_str would be '1' followed by 9 blanks. Then next character, say '2', then new_str becomes the trimmed (i.e., the first part without trailing blanks?) plus '2'. Hmm, trimming and concatenation may not work as expected here.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is:\n\nnew_str = ''\n\nWait but in Fortran, you can't have an empty string? Or maybe using a to_string method?\n\nAlternatively, start with an empty string by initializing as blanks and then building it character by character. Wait but leading blanks would matter. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of using a temporary integer to track the length. Let me try to think of a step.\n\nLet me refer to pseudocode:\n\nInitialize a length of the processed string (call it new_length) to 0.\n\nProcess each character of b:\n\nif c is not '.', then append to new_str at position new_length+1 and increment new_length.\n\nThis way, new_str's content from 1 to new_length is the desired digits.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't directly modify parts of a character variable unless you use array elements. So, better to use a character array for the new_str, like an array of characters. Let me see.\n\nLet me try this:\n\ndeclare: character :: new_str(100) (or a suitable length)\n\nInitially set all to '0' or something, but perhaps better to process character by character and track the new_length.\n\nSet new_length =0.\n\nThen, loop from i=1 to len_trim(b):\n\n    c = b(i:i)\n\n    if (c .ne. '.') then\n\n        new_length = new_length +1\n\n        new_str(new_length) = c\n\n    end if\n\nThen, after the loop, the new_str has length new_length, and the string is stored in new_str(1:new_length).\n\nAh, this might work better. So, once that is done, then we can convert new_str(1:new_length) into an integer.\n\nOkay. Now, converting the digit string into an integer. In Fortran, we can use internal read statements.\n\nSo, in Fortran code:\n\ninteger :: bInt\n\nread(new_str(1:new_length),*) bInt\n\nWait but new_str is an array of characters. To concatenate them into a string, perhaps we can form a temporary character string that is the concatenation of all the chars in new_str. So, like:\n\ntemp = ''\ndo i=1, new_length\n    temp = temp // new_str(i)\nend do\n\nthen read(temp,*) bInt\n\nHmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, the variable new_str is a character array, and you can read it in a loop, perhaps withf a do loop. Alternatively, maybe the internal read can handle the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if the variable is an array of characters, you can read from it as follows:\n\nSo the code:\n\ncharacter(1) :: new_str(100)\n\ninteger :: bInt\n\n! after filling new_str up to new_length\n\nread(new_str(1:new_length), '(a)') temp_str\n\nThen read(temp_str, *) bInt. Hmm, but again getting into multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, make the new_str into an integer with the value. Since in Fortran, you can use the internal read directly from the array, assuming it's contiguous. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the new_str is stored as a string. Let me think of an example. Suppose b was \"123.45\", the new_str would be \"12345\", so the digits stored as an array, and then reading from it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a function. Alternatively:\n\ncharacter(len= new_length) :: temp_str\ntemp_str = new_str(1:new_length)\nread(temp_str, *) bInt\n\nBut how to allocate varying length variables? Hmm, maybe working with variables of sufficient length.\n\nWait, but perhaps in practice, the string won't be very long. Let's suppose that the maximum length of new_str is, say, 20. So:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp_str\n\nthen, assign:\n\ntemp_str = (new_str(1:new_length))\n\n? Not sure. Alternatively, use array strings:\n\ntemp_str = new_str(1:new_length)\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array constructor. Maybe:\n\ntemp_str = (/(char_array(i), i=1,new_length)/)\n\nHmm, perhaps a bit complicated.\n\nHmm, maybe another way is better. Instead of using the array, build the string by concatenation within a loop, appending each non-dot character to a character variable.\n\nSo:\n\nnew_str = ''\n\nWait but in Fortran, you can initialize variable with quotes.\n\nWait, let's try this way:\n\ndeclare new_str as a character(len=255) variable.\n\nSet new_str = ''\n\nthen loop through each character in b:\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(b)\n    c = b(i:i)\n    if (c /= '.') new_str = trim(adjustl(new_str)) // c\nend do\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings don't automatically grow. The variable new_str has fixed length. If you start with blank, then the first letter would be appended to the empty string? Not really. Because trim(adjustl(new_str)) would be trim the leading spaces first. Wait, no. Let's think of examples.\n\nOriginal new_str is initialized to '' (but in Fortran, it's all blanks of the given length). Suppose new_str is of length 10, initialized as ' ' (10 times). Then, the first iteration, trim(adjustl(new_str)) is the empty string? Because adjustl moves the left part, so leading blanks are removed. So, adjusting new_str, which is all blanks, it remains as a blank string. So trim(adjustl(new_str)) would be an empty? No, perhaps.\n\nWait, adjustl removes leading blanks. So if the string is all blanks, then adjustl returns the same string. Trimming removes leading and trailing blanks? Wait no: trim removes trailing blanks only. So if new_str is \"          \", then adjustl(new_str) is still \"          \", then trim(adjustl(new_str)) is also \"          \" but trailing spaces may not be removed? No, trim trims trailing blanks from the adjusted left string.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nOriginal new_str is all blanks (length 10: '          ')\n\nThen, adjustl(new_str) gives same. Then trim(adjustl(new_str)) would also give same, because there are no non-blank characters. So the first assignment:\n\n trimmed_str = trim(adjustl(new_str))\n new_str = trimed_str // '1'\n\nBut trimed_str is still 10 spaces. So the concatenation would be 10 spaces + '1' but since new_str can only hold 10, it would be first 9 blanks and then '1'? Not sure.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps initialize new_str as blanks, and then build the string by adding characters to it with the correct offset.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran 90/95 can support character arrays. Let me try to think of the first way with an array:\n\nWe can declare new_str as a character array:\n\ncharacter(100) :: new_str_char! assuming 100 is a safe maximum length. Maybe better to have something like 20.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_len_b = 20\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(max_len_b) :: new_chars\n\ninteger :: new_length =0\n\nLoop over the characters of b:\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(b)\n\n    char = b(i:i)\n\n    if (char /= '.') then\n\n        new_length = new_length +1\n\n        new_chars(new_length) = char\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen the desired number is in new_chars(1:new_length). So the value is the integer formed by that sequence.\n\nNow, how to convert that to an integer. \n\nWe can read it with an internal file.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp_str\n\ntemp_str = (/( new_chars(i), i=1, new_length)/)\n\nWait, that may not be reading correctly, because new_chars is an array. Alternatively, to join the characters, perhaps form a string:\n\ntemp_str = ''\n\ndo i=1, new_length\n\n    temp_str = temp_str // new_chars(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen read(temp_str,*) bInt.\n\nBut this can work. Then, the conversion would be successful provided that the concatenated string is a valid number. \n\nAlternatively, use an internal read statement directly on the array:\n\nread(new_chars(1:new_length),*) bINT\n\nWait, maybe in some versions of Fortran this is possible, but I need to check. I think that if the RHS of the read is a character array slice, then it can be read as a string. Let me see:\n\nread (new_chars(1:new_length), '(a)') temp_str\n\nthen read(temp_str, *) bin... \n\nHmm, perhaps that's the way. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the read statement can be:\n\nread(new_chars(1:new_length),*) bin... \n\nYes, I think the above may work. Let me try to see a code example.\n\nSuppose variables:\n\ninteger :: x\n\ncharacter(2) :: chararr = (/'1', '2'/)\n\nread(chararr, *) x \u2192 x would be 12? That seems plausible. \n\nYes, that's probably how it works. So in this case, using read(new_chars(1:new_length), *) bInt should read the digits as an integer. \n\nBut first, we have to make sure that new_length is not too long (if the string is longer than what fits in an integer), but given that in Java it was parsed to an integer, the problem likely ensures that's okay.\n\nAlright, proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead a and b:\n\nRead them into variables of type integer*8 (for a) and a character string (for b).\n\nThen process the string.\n\nThen compute the result as (a * bin) / 100. \n\nOutput the result.\n\nIn Fortran, integer division is done with / operator, but for the variables:\n\nThe types need to be considered. Since a is integer*8, bInt is integer (so default, likely 4 bytes?), so multiplying a (64-bit) by an integer (32?) may cause issues, but perhaps the compiler will promote automatically. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps need to make sure the types are consistent. Let's see:\n\na is an integer*8 (equivalent to 8-byte integer). bin is an integer (maybe 4 bytes), but when multiplied by a 8-byte integer, the result may be 64-bit or 8-byte? Well, depends on compiler, but as long as the cast is handled, but in any case, dividing by 100 (which is integer). So, maybe:\n\nresult = (a * bin) / 100\n\nBut in Fortran, the multiplication would be in the size of a, which is 8 bytes, and dividing an integer by 100 would be exact division (since both are integers). The result is an integer, which needs to be printed.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ninteger*8 :: a, result\n\ninteger :: bin, new_length, i, max_len\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(100) :: new_chars  ! assuming 100 is a big enough buffer.\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: b  ! The input string is read into b (we need to choose a sufficient length)\n\nWait, but how big should the b be? Since the original Java's string can have, say, a maximum of, let's say 15 characters (like \"1234.5678\"). But in Fortran, when we read a character string with list-directed input ( * ), the string can have up to the available space. So perhaps declaring b as len=100?\n\nSo:\n\ncharacter(len=255) :: b\n\nthen read:\n\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nWait, but in Fortran, that read may read up to the next blank. Let's test this. Suppose the input is, for example:\n\n345 1234.56\n\nThen a is read as 345, b is '1234.56', which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the input is split over lines, but probably the code is okay.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer*8 :: a, result\n    \n    integer :: bInt, new_length, i \n\n    ! Allocate a character array for the new string. Max input length?\n\n    character(len=255) :: b\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(255) :: new_chars ! Needs to be as big as maximum possible length of b (without '.' )\n\n    new_length =0 \n\n    ! read the inputs\n\n    read(*,*) a, b\n\n    ! process the string b to remove '.' \n\n    do i=1, len_trim(b)\n        if (b(i:i) /= '.') then\n            new_length = new_length+1\n            new_chars(new_length) = b(i:i)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, read the new_chars as integer\n\n    read(new_chars(1:new_length), *) bInt \n\n    ! calculate the result\n\n    result = ( a * bInt ) / 100\n\n    ! print the result\n\n    print*, result\n\nend program main\n\nHmm, does this work?\n\nWait, possible points to check:\n\n- The length of new_chars is 255, which is the same as the input b's length. So if b has a '.' then there can be at most 254 characters. But the dimension is 255, so perhaps okay.\n\nWait, actually, in the loop, the new_length starts at zero, and for each character that is not '.' , new_length increases by 1. So for each character except '.' s, so if the original length of b (without blanks) is up to 255, then new_length could be up to 255.\n\nHence the new_chars array is dimension 255. Thus the (new_length) will not exceed the array.\n\nSo that is okay.\n\nBut in the read statement:\n\nread(new_chars(1:new_length), *) bInt. \n\nThis should take the array elements from 1 to new_length (the digits) and parse them as the integer.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting case:\n\nSample input:\n\nFor example, in Java's sample code:\n\nWhat if input a=5, b=\"123.45\"\n\nThen b's length is 6, the '.' is at position 4. So new_length will be 5 (12345), and bInt is 12345. Then (5 * 12345)=61725 /100 is 617.25 \u2192 but in integer division, 61725 divided by 100 is 617 (since in Fortran's default integer division cuts towards zero?), but 61725/100 is exactly 617.25 \u2192 integer division would be 617?\n\nWait, yes, but the problem in the Java code does (a*bInt)/100. Since bInt is integer, (5 * 12345) = 61725, divided by 100 is 617.25 \u2192 but in Java the division is integer division, which would be 617. So the code should output 617.\n\nIn Fortran, the same division would give 617 since 5 is an integer. Variables: a is integer*8 (so 64-bit), so (a * bInt) is 64-bit* 12345 (integer), so the result is 61725 (probably in integer*8). Then dividing by 100 (integer /integer would the same division. So same result.\n\nAnother test case: \n\nInput:\n\na=3 \n\nb= \"9999.99\"\n\nprocess: bStr is \"999999\", so bInt is 999999, multiply by 3 \u2192 2999997 \u2192 /100 \u2192 29999.97 \u2192 truncates to 29999. Is this correct? Wait 2999997 /100 is 29999.97 \u2192 integer division truncates to 29999, yes, which is the correct answer.\n\nHence, the code should be okay.\n\nPossible issues in code:\n\n- What if the input string b has no '.' characters? Then the processing is okay, new_length is the same as the length of b, the code proceeds.\n\nWhat if the string has spaces? Like if input was \" 123.45 \\n\" \u2192 but since Java's next() reads the next token, so in Fortran, the read with list-directed input would read the \"123.45\" as the b string, because blank-delimited. \n\nWait, but in Fortran's list-directed input, the variable b would be trimmed, so if the user inputs leading or trailing spaces, the len_trim(b) would exclude those, so the code is okay even if there are leading/blanks.\n\nWait in the initial code, the Java code's b is the next token, so the input for it would be the next token after a, so in Fortran, the variable b would take the next token (i.e., without leading or trailing spaces), so the processing is correct.\n\nAnother possible problem: if the string is too long? Like over 255 characters, but as the problem's constraints probably state an appropriate max length, assuming it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, if the string has non-digit characters except '.', then the code may process it wrong? Like if the input is \"1a2.3b4\", the new_str would have '1a23b4' which is not an integer, causing a read error. But according to the problem's input constraints, perhaps the input is always valid, like the string represents a number, so only digits and at most one '.' But the code could be robust anyway.\n\nThus, the Fortran code as written should work."
