    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first, I should understand what the Java code is doing. Let's go through it step by step.\n\nThe Java program reads two integers, n and k. Then it reads an array of n integers. Then it counts the number of 1s and 0s in the array, storing them in o and e respectively. Then, for each of the k test cases, it reads l and r (probably 1-based indices?), calculates the length of the interval (r - l +1). If that length is odd, output 0. If even, check if half of that length is less than or equal to both o and e. If yes, output 1, else 0. Finally, print all the results.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to replicate this logic. Let me think about the structure.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, input is done via READ statements. The main variables: n, k, arr, o, e, then l and r for each query.\n\nWait, the array in Java is integers. But in the problem context, the array elements are 0 or 1 since we are counting o and e based on 1s and non-1s (probably 0s). So in Fortran, the array can be an integer array.\n\nFirst steps:\n\n1. Read n and k from input.\n2. Read array of n elements into an array (probably starting at index 1? Wait, Java uses zero-based indexes, but Fortran is typically 1-based unless specified. But the indices l and r in the input\u2014are they 1-based? The Java code uses for loops from 0, so probably in the Java code, the input l and r are 1-based? Wait the array in Java is from 0 to n-1, but when you process a segment from l to r in the queries, in Java terms, do we have l and r as 0-based or 1-based?\n\nWait the code's comments: For each query l, r. The calculation r-l+1 gives the length. In the Java code, the array is processed with indices from 0. So, when the user inputs l and r in the Java code, they must be in 1-based indices. For example, to get the entire array, l is 1 and r is n. But the code doesn't check for that, perhaps the user expects l and r to be between 1 and n?\n\nBecause in Java array is zero-based, but the code uses l and r as though from 1 (since the code just calculates the length, not accessing elements). Wait actually, no. The code is just calculating the length of the interval between l and r. Since in the query, the length is (r - l +1), perhaps l and r are in the 1-based index. The actual array elements are not indexed here, but the interval's length is checked for parity and divided into halves. The problem might require that. So, the indices here are probably 1-based as per input. So in the code, the Java program uses l and r as per input. So in Fortran, when we read l and r, we can leave as integers as is.\n\nNow, in Fortran variables. Let's see variables:\n\no and e are counts of 1s and 0s. So in Fortran, variables need to be declared. Maybe use integers: o, e.\n\nArray arr has to be an array of integers, size n. But in any case, we just iterate through each element and count the 1s. So in Fortran:\n\nRead the array elements. Then loop through each element, increment o or e.\n\nThen, process each query. So loops from 1 to k.\n\nIn Java, they use a StringBuffer for the result. Fortran can build up a character string (or append to an array of characters, then write at the end). Alternatively, printing each result line as it comes would be simpler, since Fortran can't append to a string variable the way Java does easily. The StringBuffer is built to accumulate text, but in Fortran, perhaps it's better to just write each line as it's computed. So maybe, instead of appending to a string, Fortran can print directly. Wait the code has to collect all the results and print them in the end? No, in the Java code, they use a StringBuffer and then print it all at the end. Let me check the Java code: they append to the buffer in a loop, and then print the string. So in Fortran, perhaps we can build a string variable (like a character array) that fills up with each result line, then print it at the end. But Fortran strings can be a bit tricky, perhaps better to print as each line is generated.\n\nWait, no. Let's think. The Java code uses a StringBuffer where each line is added to res. The Fortran code would need to replicate that. Let's see.\n\nAlternative approaches:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n1. Read n, k.\n\n2. Read the array of n integers. Let's see: arr(1) to arr(n).\n\n3. Compute o and e: the number of 1s and 0s.\n\nWait wait, in Java the code does:\n\nfor each i up to n, if arr[i] ==1, then o++ else e. So the array elements are 1 or others (0?), so e counts the number of elements not equal to 1? So that's assuming the array has elements 0 or 1. The problem says, probably in the context of Codeforces problem, but the code is written with that assumption.\n\nSo in Fortran code: loop over the array elements and count the number of 1s (o) and the rest (considered 0) as e.\n\nWait but if the elements can be other numbers (like 2 etc), then code's logic might be wrong. But as per the code, probably the problem specifies that elements are 0s and 1s. So proceed accordingly.\n\nThen the queries:\n\nfor each query (l, r):\n\nCompute the length: r - l +1.\n\nIf that's odd: output 0.\n\nElse if (length /2) <= o AND <=e: output 1, else 0.\n\nWait important: For the even case, the required condition is that the half of the length can be covered by both 1s and 0s. So if the interval length is even, you need at least length/2 1's and length/2 0's. Because when the interval has even length, you need to pair them or something? The problem might be about being able to flip or arrange the bits such that it's possible.\n\nNot sure about the actual algorithm here. But the code is given, so just transcribe the logic.\n\nNow in Fortran code structure.\n\nDeclare variables.\n\nFirst, n and k are integers, say, declared as INTENT(N,K). The array size must be allocated, but F90 has dynamic arrays, but if we're using a code that can handle static arrays, need to know the maximum possible n. However, in Codeforces style, perhaps n is up to 1e5? Not sure. But for the exact code, perhaps we can use an array of size n, but Fortran requires the dimension at compile time. Alternatively, read n first, then allocate the array. \n\nWait the code needs to read n, then read an array of that size. So better to use dynamic allocation. So:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_302_A\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, o, e\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\ninteger :: l, r, len, half_len\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: result_str  ! but maybe better to write directly\n\n! Alternatively, let's read n, then allocate array.\n\nRead *, n, k\n\nallocate( arr(n) )\n\nRead *, arr\n\no = 0\n\ne = 0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   if ( arr(i) == 1 ) then\n\n      o = o +1\n\n   else\n\n      e = e +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now process each of k queries.\n\nresult_str = ''\n\ndo i =1, k\n\n   read *, l, r\n\n   len = r - l +1\n\n   if ( mod( len, 2 ) ==1 ) then\n\n      ! write '0'\n\n      result_str = trim(result_str) // '0' // char(10)\n\n   else\n\n      half_len = len /2\n\n      if ( (half_len <= o) .and. (half_len <= e) ) then\n\n         result_str = trim(result_str) // '1' // char(10)\n\n      else\n\n         result_str = trim(result_str) // '0' // char(10)\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nprint *, trim(result_str)\n\ndeallocate( arr )\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nWait, but how to handle the string building in Fortran. Because in older versions, character strings are fixed length, but in F90, we have some flexibility, but maybe with adjusted assignments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe concatenate step by step. But in F90, when you do something like:\n\nresult_str = trim(result_str) // '1\\n' ... but the problem is '\\n' equivalent is LF (ASCII 10) or CRLF (but Fortran uses just newlines). Since in Java, it appends \"\\n\", which in fortran, the char(10) would be a newline.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the new line as an actual line by writing to a file, but better to just append.\n\nWait but in many cases, when using the '//' operator, you have to be cautious about the length. For example, the allocated length of 'result_str' must be sufficient to hold all the concatenated strings. So the character(len=100000) \u2014 perhaps if the output is up to (for k=1e5, each line is 2 chars so 2e5 chars, maybe that's okay. But in any case, for competitions like Codeforces, the constraints would have a known maximum, but perhaps in this code we can use a sufficiently large size.\n\nAlternatively, dynamically extending the string as needed would be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each case, just print the result immediately. That might be better not using an accumulator.\n\nWait in original Java, they build a buffer and at the end print all in one go. But printing per line would be also acceptable.\n\nSo, in that case, the code can be restructured to just PRINT, \"0\" or \"1\" each time, but with a new line.\n\nBut in Fortran, the default I/O have some formats, so we can write:\n\nPRINT *, '0'\n\nBut the comma adds a space, but in C, the trailing space is not allowed. Wait the original code appends \"0\\n\", which outputs a line with just 0. So perhaps in Fortran:\n\nIn the loop:\n\n...\n\nif ( ... )\n\n   write(*,'(A)') '0'\n\nelse\n\n   write(*,'(A)') '1'\n\nend if\n\nWait maybe using the same approach. Because using 'print *, \"0\" ' would output \"0 \" (with space?), but using write with format a is better.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid trailing spaces, the format '(A)' ensures the string is written as is. The line feed would be handled by the default, but in Fortran, after the write, it might proceed to new line.\n\nWait the 'PRINT *, ...' statement in Fortran automatically adds a new line. So for example:\n\nPRINT *, '0' would output \"0\" followed by a new line.\n\nExactly what we want. So that's better.\n\nSo changing the approach to just output each line as it comes.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\nprogram codeforces_302_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, o, e\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\ninteger :: l, r, len, half_len\n\n! Read n and k\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nallocate( arr(n) )\n\n! Read the array elements:\n\nread(*,*) arr\n\n! Calculate o (count of 1s), e (others, 0s)\n\no = 0; e = 0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if( arr(i) == 1 ) then\n\n      o = o +1\n\n   else\n\n      e = e +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Process each query:\n\ndo i =1, k\n\n   read(*,*) l, r\n\n   len = r - l +1\n\n   if( mod(len,2) ==1 ) then\n\n      print *, 0\n\n   else\n\n      half_len = len /2\n\n      if ( (half_len <= o ) .and. (half_len <= e ) ) then\n\n         print *, 1\n\n      else\n\n         print *, 0\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(arr)\n\nend program\n\nWait wait, the print statement with print *, 0 would output a new line correctly. Let me think:\n\nFor example, when in Java it appends \"0\\n\" followed by next, in Fortran, when using print *, 0, the output is the integer 0, with a space before newline? Or perhaps the asterisk in print allows free-form? Alternatively, maybe it's better to format the output as a character.\n\nWait better to check.\n\nSuppose in Fortran, when I do print*,0: the output is \"0\" followed by a new-line, without a space. Because the * specifier lets the compiler choose the field by default, and it adds a space between items, but if there is only one item, it just writes in the field with a new line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using write statements with fixed format.\n\nTo be precise, to output exactly the number followed by a new line. Let's see:\n\nThe program expects lines with \"0\" or \"1\" followed by a new line.\n\nThus using:\n\nprint *, '0' \u2192 writes '0' (since it is a character constant), but that is a bit different. Wait perhaps better:\n\nwrite(*, '(I1)') 0 \u2192 writes '0' with no space, and then new line.\n\nAlternatively, using print *, 0 would also suffice as the print statement places 0 followed by a new line. Because in PRINT, \"0\" is an integer, so it's printed with enough space.\n\nWait maybe in Fortran, \"print *, 1\" will write \"   1\" (with leading spaces?), but depends on the compiler. To make sure there are no trailing characters, perhaps better to use the formatted write.\n\nFor example, to write exactly one character, '0' or '1' followed by a newline:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') '0'\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') '1'\n\nBecause the 'A' format from a character (or the string converted).\n\nAlternatively, for the numbers, perhaps 'I1' would be okay.\n\nAlternatively, in the code above, since when we print *, 0, the number 0 is written with a space, but since it's a single line. But given that the desired output is exactly '0' followed by a newline, perhaps using the write with a format.\n\nSo, the following code would be:\n\n   if( mod(len,2) ==1 ) then\n\n      write(*,'(A)') \"0\"\n\n   else\n\n      half_len = len /2\n\n      if ( (half_len <= o ) .and. (half_len <= e ) ) then\n\n         write(*,'(A)') \"1\"\n\n      else\n\n         write(*,'(A)') \"0\"\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nWait the strings \"0\" and \"1\" as character variables need quotes.\n\nWait in Fortran, write(*,fmt) \"0\" \u2014 but that's valid. The compiler might accept it, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, use a character variable:\n\n      char = '0'\n\n      write(*, '(A)' ) char\n\nBut in lines of code, the first approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, the code can safely do that.\n\nBut then in that code, I can proceed. Now test some edge cases.\n\nNow let me think of test cases.\n\nSample input:\n\nSuppose the code expects:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 2\n\n1 0 1\n\nThe array has two 1's (o=2), and one 0 (e=1).\n\nThen first query, say l=1, r=3 (whole array): the length is 3, odd \u2192 output 0.\n\nSecond query l=1, r=2: length 2. half is 1. The 1 requires that o (2) >= 1 and e (1) >=1 \u2192 yes. So output is 1.\n\nThus, the output should be 0 and 1, each on their own line.\n\nIn the Fortran code, when that runs, the first case would be written as \"0\" and the second as \"1\" with new lines between.\n\nThe code would do that.\n\nWait in the code above, when we print, for the length even, the half is length/2.\n\nWait length is even, yes.\n\nAnother case: if the length even but the half exceeds o or e.\n\nE.g., if the array has elements [1,0], o=1, e=1.\n\nA query over the whole array (length 2).\n\nSo half is 1 each: since o=1 and e=1 (each == 1), output 1.\n\nAnother case, if o is 0, then if query with even length where half is 1. Then it would output 0.\n\nNow testing in code:\n\nThe code should handle these.\n\nOther possible error points: the array being read properly. The program uses read *, arr \u2014 but in F90+ , when you read an array, it's read in the entire array from the given line, elements separated by space. So the input for array is provided as all elements in a line.\n\nWait the java code uses sc.nextInt for each array element. So the array elements are read one by one, which in Java would be from the same line (probably). So in Fortran, the second Read statement \"read *, arr\" needs to read n integers from a line. So if the user inputs them as space-separated on a single line, the code works. But if multiple lines, but the code requires that the next input line(s) provide exactly n numbers. Well, the code is designed in the same way as the Java version, perhaps assuming that the user inputs the array in one line (or multiple, but the program reads all n elements properly).\n\nSince in the Java code, the Scanner uses nextInt(), which will read tokens from the input, regardless of line breaks. So in Fortran, if the code reads all elements from the same line (as required perhaps by code setup), but using read*,arr would work. For example:\n\nIn Fortran, the read *, arr directive reads all the values from the input until n elements are read, regardless of lines. So that's okay.\n\nNow considering array indexes. The Java code starts from 0, but the loop from i=0 to n-1, thus the array[0] is the first, array[1] the second. The fortran code uses indexes 1-based, so arr(1) is first element, arr(n) the last. This doesn't interfere with the counting of o and e, since we just count elements equal to 1 or not, so the logic is correct.\n\nAnother point: in the java code, when calculating (r - l +1)/2 \u2014 for even length (because if even length, the length is even), so dividing by 2 gives integer. So in Fortran, using integer division is okay. The half_len is set to len/2, which is integer. Because modulo for len is 0.\n\nSo yes, the code is okay.\n\nNow check variable declarations: all variables are declared.\n\nThe variables in USE:\n\nThe variables:\n\no and e are integers initialized to 0.\n\nThe 'i' loop variable in the array is fine (loop from 1 to n).\n\nThe k loop uses another 'i', which would shadow the outer i? Let me see. The code inside the k loop has 'do i=1, k', so this changes the 'i', but in the 'do i=1,k' loop, that is okay because in an inner loop. Fortran allows this, but variables inside have preference. Wait yes, in Fortran, in the inner loop, the \"i\" would be redeclared only if allowed, but actually, Fortran variables are block-scoped only in Fortran 90+ with proper use of blocks. Wait no, variables in Fortran are not block-scoped unless inside an explicit block. So the \"i\" in the first loop (over 1 to n) is same as the \"i\" in the loop over k queries, so this is an issue. Because when the loop over queries is done with the same loop variable 'i', the loop variables conflict. Since changing the loop index variable names would cause an issue.\n\nAh! Oops, that's a problem. Because the two 'do i' loops share the same variable i. So the first loop over the array uses i, then the second loop (over queries) uses the same variable i, which is allowed in Fortran, but in the first case, the first DO uses a variable i that would remain, and then the second DO starts with an I that starts from 1. However, after the first loop, the variable i is 'n' when done (since last iteration i is n), so that's okay, but in the second loop (k iterations), the variable i will step from 1 to k, so overwriting the previous value. The variable is the same, but the code should still work because it's intended to have the loop variable's value change each iteration regardless. So in Fortran, loop variables are by design the same variable, and the inner loop overwrites the outer's loop variable. So for this, this is allowed and works fine.\n\nWait in code:\n\nThe first loop:\n\ndo i =1, n \u2192 variable i goes from 1 -> n\n\nThen, the second loop:\n\ndo i =1, k \u2192 uses the variable i again.\n\nYes, that's acceptable in Fortran, variables are not in local scope unless declared. So this should work. So not an issue, variable i can be used in both loops.\n\nWait but \u2014 the first loops leaves it in i = n. Then the next loop will start with i=1. Since in the second loop's DO, the variable is reinitialized. In Fortran loops, the loop variable is set to the starting value each time regardless of its prior value. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnother possible issue: Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, and the indices in the problem might be 1-based. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the edge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn = 1, k=1.\n\nInput array: 1 \u2192 o =1, e=0.\n\nQuery l=1, r=1.\n\nLength is 1. Odd \u2192 output 0.\n\nThus, code would output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, array [0,0], o=0, e=2.\n\nQuery l=1 to 2 (length 2 even). half 1. required e has to be \u22651 and o \u22651. o is zero, so output 0.\n\nWhich the code would do.\n\nAnother case where o and e have enough to cover: n=4, array has 2 ones and 2 zeros. A query for 4 elements (even, half is 2. So 2 <= 2 and 2 <=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nSo the code in Fortran seems okay. So I think that's the translation.\n\nSo, the final code."
