So the index would increment to n correctly, but in the array index, but the length array is size n, so that's okay. Wait in the Java code: the 'index' was initialized to 0 at the same time as returnDex, and during the loop, for each of the n strings, it's adding to length[index++], so it goes up to n elements. That's okay. So in Fortran's case, we can loop over each string (from 1 to n), and for each of them:\n\ndexG = INDEX(str, \"G\") but in Fortran, since it's a single character, we can write:\n\ndexG = INDEX(arr(i), 'G', .true.)",

Wait for instance, if m is 1, that can't happen because G and S can't coexist in a one-character string. So likely the problem\u2019s constraints ensure G and S are present and their indices different. Thus the differences are between 1 and m-1.

Wait in the first part: the 'allocatable' for arrs is allocated as \"character(len=m) :: arrs(n)\", which is possible via\n\nallocate( character(len=m) :: arrs(n) ) But in some fortran standards or compiers that may require the allocation be done as:\n\nallocate( arrs(n) ) and with len(m). Wait Not sure. The correct syntax is:\n\nallocate( arrs(n), source=character(len=m) :: ' ' ...) ?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads two integers n and m, then reads n strings. For each string, it finds the positions of 'G' and 'S'. If in any string G comes after S, it sets returnDex to -1. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the positions of S and G, storing these differences in an array. Then, it counts the unique differences using a HashSet. Finally, if returnDex is -1, it prints -1; else, the size of the set.\n\nHmm, Fortran doesn't have sets like Java. So I need to find another way to count unique values. Maybe use an array and sort it, then count distinct elements. Or another approach is to check each element against all others to count uniques.\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure. The main steps are: input handling, processing each string, collecting lengths, checking for invalid cases (G after S), then counting unique lengths.\n\nStarting with inputs: in Fortran, we'll read n and m first. The m might be part of the input but not used here? Wait, looking back, the Java code uses n as the number of strings and m is... the second input. But in the code, m isn't used except in the declaration. The strings are read as arrs[i] = sc.next(), which in Java would read up to the next whitespace, but since each line is scanned sequentially, maybe the strings are of fixed length m?\n\nWait the Java code is using sc.next(), which reads the next token. But perhaps each string is exactly m characters long? Because in the problem statement (since this is Codeforces problem B from 400), maybe each of the n strings is of length m. So, in the Fortran code, probably need to read n lines, each of length m, so some sort of character array.\n\nWait the Java code's for loop reads n strings via sc.next(), but each string would actually be the next token, which could be any length unless the input is structured such that each line is exactly m characters. Hmm, maybe in the problem's input, each of the next n lines is a string of length m? Because otherwise, the m might be part of the problem's constraints but not actually used here. But the original code has a variable m that's declared but never used except in the declaration. Wait looking at the Java code: after reading m, it ignores it, and reads n strings with sc.next(). So perhaps m is not used here. Wait that could be a problem, but perhaps the problem requires each string to have exactly m characters. Because otherwise, in Java, how does sc.next() know? Maybe the input for the strings is such that each string is exactly m characters, so after reading n, m is read, but then the code proceeds to read n strings. Maybe m isn't actually used, so the code could be written that way. Anyway, in the Fortran code, since we have to read the n strings correctly, and in Java, the code may have m as an unused variable. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the original Java code: the m is read but not used except in the variables? No, m isn't used anywhere except stored as a variable. So maybe the actual problem specifies that each of the next n strings has m characters, but in the code, it's not used. So in the Fortran code, I can just read n strings each of which might be length m, but perhaps the code can handle variable-length as well? But in Fortran, handling variable-length strings is possible with arrays.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read n lines of fixed-length m characters:\n\nWait, if each string is exactly m characters long, then perhaps in Fortran, the code should read a character array of (n, m), but how to read them? Hmm, in code:\n\nFirst, variables: n and m are read from input. Then, read n strings, each of length m.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ninteger::n, m\nread*, n, m\n\nThen, to declare an array of n strings, each of m characters:\n\ncharacter(len=m) :: arrs(n)\n\nThen, read n lines into arrs:\n\ndo i=1,n\n   read*, arrs(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but the input lines may have the strings. Alternatively, read as\n\ndo i=1,n\n   read(*,'(a)') arrs(i)\nend do\n\nBut the format needs to ensure we read exactly m characters. Alternatively, if m is the length of each string, then the strings must be exactly m characters. \n\nAnother point: the Java code is using next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So perhaps the actual input format is different? Maybe the next n lines each is a single string of any length, up to m? Hmm, perhaps better to assume that each string is exactly m characters wide (as the problem might have specified in problem 400B). \n\nAssuming that the m is indeed the length of each string, so each string is m characters. Then the code proceeds.\n\nMoving on, for each string, we need to find the indices of 'G' and 'S', and compute dexG and dexS. In Java, they use the indexOf method. In Fortran, to find the positions, perhaps use the INDEX function. The INDEX function in Fortran returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring. So for G and S in each string. However, Fortran uses 1-based indices, which matches the Java code's approach.\n\nBut in Java, if the string does not contain 'G', then dexG is -1? Or throws an exception? Wait the Java code would return -1 if, for example, G is not found. But the problem likely ensures that G and S are present in each string. Because otherwise, the code would crash. The problem statement (assuming it's Codeforces problem 400B) requires each string has exactly one G and one S. So that's safe.\n\nSo for each string, in Fortran:\n\ndexG = INDEX(arrs(i), 'G')\n\ndexS = INDEX(arrs(i), 'S')\n\nThen compare them. If dexG > dexS, then return -1. Else compute dexS - dexG as the length for this row.\n\nWait Fortran string\u2019s length is m, so the indices are between 1 and m.\n\nOnce we have all the length differences (length array in Java), we need to collect the unique values. Since in Java, they use a HashSet, in Fortran, we can create an array of the differences, then sort it and count distinct elements.\n\nAlternatively, we can loop through all the elements and check if each is present in a list that already contains uniques. Let me think.\n\nFirst, process each string, storing the length differences. \n\nVariables: length array in Fortran. The Java code has an array length of size n. So in Fortran, declare an array of integers, say arr_length(n).\n\nInitialize an index variable? The Java code uses var index starting at 0, but in Fortran, maybe loop from 1 to n. Let me see the loops:\n\nIn the Java code's for loop: \n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    arrs[i] = sc.next();\n}\n\nThen, the loop for each string:\n\nfor (String tmp : arrs) {\n    ...\n}\n\nSo the first loop reads the strings into the array, then the second loop checks each string. \n\nIn Fortran, loop over each string in arrs(1) to arrs(n). \n\nProcessing each string:\n\ndexG = index(arrs(i), 'G')\n\ndexS = index(arrs(i), 'S')\n\nIf dexG > dexS, then returnDex is set to -1. Else, the current length is dexS - dexG. \n\nWait in the Java code's code:\n\nfor (String tmp : arrs) {\n    int dexG = tmp.indexOf(\"G\");\n    int dexS = tmp.indexOf(\"S\");\n    if (dexG > dexS) {\n        returnDex = -1;\n    }\n    length[index++] = dexS - dexG;\n}\n\nWait index starts at 0 (initialized as 0) but in the loops, the first loop is for (String tmp ...), so for all n elements. So the index would increment to n correctly, but in the array index, but the length array is size n, so that's okay. \n\nWait in the Java code: the 'index' was initialized to 0 at the same time as returnDex, and during the loop, for each of the n strings, it's adding to length[index++], so it goes up to n elements. That's okay. \n\nSo in Fortran's case, we can loop over each string (from 1 to n), and for each of them:\n\ndexG = INDEX(str, \"G\") but in Fortran, since it's a single character, we can write:\n\ndexG = INDEX(arr(i), 'G', .true.)\n\nWait, need to check if the substring is case-sensitive, but assuming the problem is in uppercase. The default in INDEX is case-sensitive, but if the problem is as per Codeforces 400B, maybe it's uppercase. So no problem, just using 'G' and 'S' in the checks.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\ndo i=1, n\n    currentStr = arrs(i)\n    call fun_occurrence(currentStr, dexG, dexS)\n    if (dexG > dexS) then\n        returnDex = -1  ! Once found, stays there\n    else\n        arr_length(i) = dexS - dexG\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait but in the Java code, when any string has G after S, it sets returnDex to -1. The returnDex variable starts at 0, but in Java's code, that's an integer. Wait no, in Java:\n\nint index =0, returnDex =0;\n\nWait, no: initial value of returnDex is 0, but in the loop, if any string has G after S, returnDex becomes -1, but remains that way.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nif (dexG > dexS) {\n    returnDex = -1;\n} \n\nSo if any such string exists, returnDex is set to -1 and remains that way, as further checks don't change it. So in Fortran code, initialize returnDex as 0, then in the loop check each row:\n\nif (dexG .gt. dexS) then\n    returnDex = -1  ! once true, remain -1\n\nSo that part is straightforward.\n\nThen, the array arr_length stores the values of dexS - dexG for each string where dexG < dexS. \n\nWait, but in the Java code, even if some rows are invalid (G after S), they still compute and store the length? Wait no, because in the Java loop:\n\nfor each tmp in arrs:\n\n    compute dexG and dexS.\n\n    if (dexG > dexS), set returnDex = -1.\n\n    then, add to length[]: length[index++] = dexS - dexG; \n\nWait that part's a problem. Wait, the Java loop for the String tmp is:\n\n   for (String tmp : arrs) {\n        int dexG = ... \n        int dexS = ...\n        if (dexG > dexS) ... set returnDex to -1.\n        length[index++] = dexS - dexG; \n    }\n\nWait! Even if G is after S, they still compute dexS - dexG (like, perhaps negative number), and store it in the length array.\n\nWait this could be a bug. But the problem requires that if any G is after S, the answer is -1 but the code continues processing?\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nThe 'length' array is filled with all the dexS-g for every row, then regardless of whether the row is good or bad. But in the end, it prints -1 if returnDex is -1, else the number of unique elements in the length array, but wait that's not correct.\n\nWait let me look again:\n\nIn the code:\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nfor each string tmp:\n\n    compute the positions.\n\n    If G comes after S, set returnDex to -1.\n\n    compute the difference and add to the length array.\n\nThen, after all strings, we collect unique entries in the length array. \n\nBut in the case where returnDex is -1 (due to any G>S), then even if we consider the length array's unique elements, but the code will print -1, ignoring the unique count. \n\nBut the problem's expectation: if any row has G after S, the answer should be -1, else the number of distinct (S-G) differences.\n\nWait the code's approach is correct. Because even if one string has G after S, the returnDex is set to -1, so print -1, else, how many unique differences are there across all strings. \n\nThus, in the code, it's okay that the length array includes all differences, even for invalid rows. Because in such cases, even the presence of an invalid row causes the returnDex to be -1, and then the code proceeds to print-1, so the array's uniqueness is irrelevant then.\n\nBut in valid cases, all strings have G before S, so all differences in the array are computed, but the code then counts the unique values. \n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent is:\n\n- First, read all strings and store them.\n\n- For each string, compute the difference, store into arr_length array, and check if any G is after S.\n\n- After all strings, if any bad, output -1.\n\n- Else, count the number of distinct elements in arr_length.\n\nNow the problem reduces to, in Fortran, how to count the number of unique elements in an array.\n\nOption 1: Sort the array and count unique elements.\n\nOption 2: Loop through each element and check if it is in previous elements.\n\nOption 1 might be more efficient.\n\nOption 2 might be easier to code without sorting.\n\nBut let's see: \n\nFirst, to count unique elements, perhaps:\n\nInitialize a count variable.\n\nSort the array.\n\nLoop through each element, and if current is different from previous, increment count.\n\nInitially, count starts at 1 if the array is non-empty.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nSort arr_length(1) to arr_length(n)\n\nInitialize count =0\n\nprev = some value.\n\nloop over sorted array elements:\n\nif current != prev: increment count and set prev = current.\n\nWait:\n\nLet me see code:\n\nsort the array.\n\nif n =0: count=0, but that shouldn't happen here since n is the input.\n\ncount =1\n\nprev = arr_length(1)\n\ndo i=2 to n\n\n    if arr_length(i) .ne. prev then \n\n        count =count +1\n\n        prev = arr_length(i)\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nSo that gives the count.\n\nTo perform sorting in Fortran: we can use the Mergesort or refer to an intrinsic function. Alternatively, we can implement a simple sort like bubblesort, but that might be cumbersome. Alternatively, use the FORALL or some built-in method.\n\nWait Fortran has the function ISORT from the ISO library but maybe standard.\n\nWait perhaps use Mergesort from the intrinsic functions? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use a procedure to sort an array. The best way is to use the built-in routine. But in standard Fortran90 code, we have to sort it ourselves or use a module.\n\nAlternatively, to make it easier, implement a sorting loop here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is easier with an algorithm that doesn't sort.\n\nAnother approach for counting unique values is using a hash or a flag array.\n\nWait for the unique length values:\n\nSince the difference can be from (1 to m-1, as G must come before S). Wait if G is at position j and S at j+1, then the difference is 0. So possible differences vary between - ... + ... ?\n\nWait, no. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIf G is at position i and S is at position j, then j must be >i (since otherwise -1 return).\n\nso j -i is a positive value (since j>i), so the difference will be positive integer from 1 to m-1.\n\nWait if m is up to, say, 1e5? Well, but the problem didn't specify n and m's constraints, but in any case, the possible differences are between 0 to m^2 or whatever. But for integers, we can count them in a frequency array.\n\nIf the differences are small, like the maximum possible difference is m (if m is up to 1e5, then an array of 1e5 elements would be feasible? Well maybe not in terms of memory for very large m, but for Codeforces problem's constraints, perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for any difference d, we can loop through all elements and keep track of the unique ones using a set implemented via a list.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nallocate an array of flags or a hash table. Since in Fortran, arrays are easier.\n\nAssuming that the difference values can be up to (m-1), as G cannot be after S, and the positions can be up to m.\n\nFor each value in arr_length array:\n\nloop through all elements, keeping track of unique values.\n\nInitialize a flag array to .false. and set to .true. for each encountered value.\n\nBut the problem is that differences can be negative if G is after S (but such cases are already caught, but stored in the array). Wait no, when G is after S, then dexG is larger, so dexS - dexG is negative. But if any row has this, returnDex is set to -1, and so in the output, the code would just print -1, so in that case, we don't care about the unique values. \n\nSo in the case where returnDex == 0 (no invalid rows):\n\nall the difference (S - G) are non-negative. Because for all rows, G is before S, so S is after, so the difference is positive.\n\nThus, the differences are non-negative.\n\nThe maximum possible difference is m-1 (for example, G in first position and S in last, difference m-1).\n\nThus, the possible range of differences is from 1 up to m-1 (assuming each string has exactly one G and one S, so difference at least 1? Wait no:\n\nWait if G is at position j and S at j+1: then the difference is 1, which is possible.\n\nWait the minimum difference is at least 1 (since G must be before S in valid case). \n\nTherefore, the possible differences are from 1 to (m-1).\n\nHence, if m is up to say 1e5 then the number of buckets can be m, but in a problem like Codeforces, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, construct an array for counts and iterate through the differences, flagging each encountered value.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nallocate a logical array presence(max_possible). \n\nWait the steps for the case where returnDex isn't -1:\n\ncount =0\n\ninitialize a logical array, say, present, of size (0 to (m_max difference)),? Wait the maximum difference would be (m-1). So if m can be up to 1e5, then 1e5 elements array.\n\nWait in code: \n\nmax_diff = m -1 \n\nallocate(present(0:max_diff)) ? Since difference can be up to max_diff.\n\nWait let me think:\n\nInitialize all present elements as .false.\n\nthen loop over each element in arr_length:\n\n    d = arr_length(i)\n\n    if d <0: well, if returnDex is not -1, then this can't happen.\n\n    so for the case where returnDex is 0 (i.e., no invalid), then d is non-negative.\n\n    so for each d in the array (except possibly if some rows are invalid, but we are considering the case where returnDex is 0)\n\n    so, set present(d) = .true.\n\nthen count the number of true in present.\n\nThis would be O(m) + O(n), which may be better for large n and m.\n\nBut how to determine the max_diff needed. Since we can call m is the maximum possible m.\n\nBut in the problem, m is input, so before doing this, we can have max_diff = m -1.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, how to handle if m is large, but the code would be able to allocate an array of m elements?\n\nYes, in Fortran, you can dynamically allocate an array. Let's see:\n\nif returnDex is not -1, then:\n\n    allocate( present(0: m) )  ! but to be safe.\n\nWait, but in the valid case, all differences are between 1 and m-1, so the max value is m-1, so array from 0 to m would have to store.\n\nWait 0 may not be needed but just to be safe.\n\nWait, maybe better:\n\nmax_diff = m-1\n\nallocate( present(0:max_diff) )\n\npresent = .false.\n\nthen for each element in arr_length:\n\n    d = arr_length(i) \n\n    present(d) = .true.\n\nthen the count is the number of .true. in present.\n\nWait but what about when d exceeds the possible? For example, if somehow in an invalid row, but since we're handling only the case where no invalid row exists, then this won't happen.\n\nThus, this method is reliable. So in code:\n\nIn the valid block (when returnDex is 0):\n\n    max_diff = m -1\n\n    allocate(present(0:max_diff))\n\n    present = .false.\n\n    do i =1,n\n\n        d = arr_length(i)\n\n        present(d) = .true.\n\n    end do\n\n    count = 0\n\n    do i =0, m-1\n\n       if (present(i)) count = count +1\n\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(present)\n\n    print *, count\n\nWait but what if any difference is 0?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nG and S can have the same position? No, since in Java, the code would have:\n\ndexG > dexS would be true if they are same? Because if same index, then G and S would have indices same, but that is impossible because they are different characters. Wait in the problem\u2019s input, each string has exactly one G and one S, so their indices can't be same. \n\nSo difference must be at least 1? So differences can be 1 to m-1.\n\nWait for instance, if m is 1, that can't happen because G and S can't coexist in a one-character string. So likely the problem\u2019s constraints ensure G and S are present and their indices different.\n\nThus the differences are between 1 and m-1. So the array can be from 1 to m-1, but the previous code would cover it even if starting at 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can set lower bound of present array at 1.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow the steps for code:\n\nFortran code structure:\n\nread n and m.\n\nallocate an array of strings, each of length m.\n\nread each string.\n\nloop through each string to compute differences, check return condition.\n\nif returnDex is -1: output -1\n\nelse:\n\n    compute the number of unique differences via the present array method.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, for the variables.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_400_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex, dexG, dexS\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr_length\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: arrs\n\n    ! Read input n and m.\n\n    read(*,*) n, m\n\n    allocate( arrs(n, m) )\n\n    allocate( arr_length(n) )\n\n    ! Read each line into arrs.\n\n    do i =1, n\n\n        read(*, '(A)') arrs(i, 1:m)  ! read each character, but have to be careful with F's read.\n\n    wait, to read a string of length m into a character array.\n\nWait in Fortran, reading into a 2D array might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps using a 1D array of strings with len=m.\n\nWait in modern Fortran:\n\nPerhaps better to use a 1D array of strings, each with len m.\n\nSo:\n\n    character(len=m), dimension(:), allocatable :: arrs\n\nThen:\n\n    allocate( arrs(n) )\n\n    do i =1,n\n\n        read(*, '(A)') arrs(i)\n\n    end do\n\nYes, this would work. The read statement reads the next m characters into arrs(i), and assuming each line has exactly m characters (except for possible end of line? But in case of trailing spaces, but problem likely ensures precise form).\n\nThus in code:\n\nprogram codeforces_400_B\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex, k, current_d\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr_lengths\n    character(len=200) :: temp_str  ! arbitrary len large enough, but to ensure reading. Alternatively variable length.\n\nWait but for the problem's string length m, better to use:\n\n    integer::n, m\n    integer, allocatable :: arr_lengths(:)\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nBut variable length strings can be in Fortran with the -fcooperatively flushing option but depending on version.\n\nAlternatively, use a character array of fixed length m.\n\nLet me think the better approach.\n\nLet me proceed with the following plan:\n\nVariable-length strings in Fortran can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, use a fixed length equal to m.\n\nHence:\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex\n    character(len=1000) :: buffer\n    character(len=1000), dimension(:), allocatable :: arrs\n\n    Read n and m first.\n\n    allocate(arrs(n), source='')\n    do i=1, n\n\n        read(*, '(a)') buffer\n        ! store buffer into arrs(i) but trimming whitespace?\n\n        arrs(i) = trim(buffer)  ! maybe not needed if m exactly. But if the input ensures that each string is exactly m long, maybe buffer is exactly m length.\n\n        But the length of each line may be variable up to m?\n\n    Hmm, better to use a length equal to m for each string.\n\nAlternatively, since each input string is m characters, then maybe to declare:\n\ncharacter(len=m), dimension(n) :: arrs\n\nBut the problem requires reading n strings each of exactly m characters. Which can be done as follows:\n\nread(n, *) ... but in fortran:\n\nBut let me try to write the code step by step.\n\nWait here\u2019s the problem:\n\nVariable-length strings in Fortran can be a bit more complex. So to make it simple, given that each string is exactly m characters (as per n and m inputs), perhaps:\n\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex\n    character(len=200) :: temp\n    character(len=200), dimension(200) :: arrs ! assuming constraints up to 200, but can use allocatable\n\nWait but better to use allocatable arrays to handle input size.\n\nWait let's rewrite with proper variables.\n\nAdjusted steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\nThen, allocate arrs as an array of n strings, each of length m.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n    read(*, *) n, m\n\n    allocate( arrs(n), source = ' ' )\n\nBut how to read the next n lines into arrs ?\n\nThe problem is that the input could be line-fed strings where each line is exactly m characters.\n\nWait in fortran:\n\n    read the next n lines, and for each line, store into arrs(i).\n\nThus:\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n       read(*, '(a)') arrs(i) \n\n       ! But this may read until the end of line, but arrs(i) is of length m, so if the input line is longer than m, or shorter, that could be an issue. However, since m is given, perhaps the lines have exactly m characters. Alternatively, to make sure that only m characters are read:\n\n        ! Perhaps the line is always exactly m characters, so:\n\n    Alternatively:\n\n    read the line into a buffer which is large, but then take only the first m characters.\n\nWait here's a way: \n\n    allocating arrs as per len(m).\n\n    This requires using the / kind input.\n\nLet me try:\n\n    program codeforces_400_B\n    implicit none\n    \n    integer :: n, m, i\n    integer, allocatable :: arr_length(:)\n    character(len=m) :: arrs(1000) ! Not good: len needs to be known at compile time. Not allowed as m is a variable.\n\nAh, this is a problem. In Fortran, the length of a character array has to be known compile-time unless you use a deferred length variable.\n\nWait, so, variables with kind and length parameters can be allocated. Let me see:\n\nActually, since m is read first, perhaps use:\n\n    integer, parameter :: m_max = 100000\n    character(len=m_max) :: temp\n\nWait no, but we can use ALLOCATABLE arrays with deferred character length.\n\nWait the solution is to use: \n\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n\n    integer :: n, m, i\n\n    read*, n, m\n\n    allocate( character(len=m) :: arrs(n) )\n\nThen reading each string:\n\n    do i =1, n\n        read*, arrs(i)\n    end do\n\nWait but `read *, arrs(i)` will read until the next white space. Which may not be correct as the string could contain spaces? Not sure, but in codeforces problem, the strings probably don't have spaces, since they are sequences of G and S and other characters as per problem description. \n\nAssuming that reading with `read(*,'(A)') arrs(i)` to read exactly up to the end of the line.\n\nThus, let me structure the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_problem_400b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, i, returnDex\n    integer, allocatable :: arr_length(:)\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n\n    ! Read n and m.\n    read *, n, m\n\n    ! Allocate the string array with length m each.\n    allocate( character(len=m) :: arrs(n) )\n\n    ! Read each string.\n    do i =1, n\n        read *, arrs(i)\n        ! Perhaps check if the length matches m....\n        ! Not needed; assume inputs are correct.\n    end do\n\n    ! Now, compute the differences and check conditions.\n    allocate( arr_length(n) )\n    returnDex =0\n    do i =1, n\n        character(len=m) :: current_str = arrs(i)\n        integer :: posG, posS\n        posG = index(current_str, 'G')\n        posS = index(current_str, 'S')\n\n        if (posG > posS) then\n            returnDex = -1\n        else\n            ! valid, compute the difference\n            arr_length(i) = posS - posG\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now decide output.\n    if ( returnDex == -1 ) then\n        print *, -1\n    else\n\n        ! Count the number of unique elements in arr_length(1:n).\n        ! Using the presence flag method, with m.\n\n        ! Since some elements could have the same difference.\n\n        integer :: max_diff\n        logical, allocatable :: present(:)\n        integer :: count =0, j\n\n        max_diff = m-0  \n        ! Wait the maximum possible difference is m-1?  Because if G is in position 1 and S in position m, difference is m-1.\n\n        allocate( present(0:max_diff) )  ! indexes 0 to m-1, 0 is unused but safe.\n\n        present = .false.\n\n        do j =1, n\n            current_d = arr_length(j)\n            present(current_d) = .true.\n        end do\n\n        ! count the number of true in present(1:max_diff)\n        count =0\n        do j=1, max_diff\n            if ( present(j) ) then\n                count = count +1\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        print *, count\n        deallocate(present)\n    end if\n\n    deallocate( arr_length, arrs )\n\nend program\n\nWait but let me check the logic here.\n\nWait in the loop where we set present:\n\npresent is allocated from 0 to (m-1 + something? Let me recheck variables.\n\nMax difference was set to m-1 (since G at 1, S at m: S-G = m-1). So max_diff is m-1.\n\nSo when we allocated present(0:max_diff: which would be up to m-1.\n\nWait initializing present(0:max_diff) means indices 0,1,..., (m-1).\n\nThus, the differences (which are 1 to m-1) will set present(1) to present(m-1) properly.\n\nThen, when counting, we start the loop from 1 to m-1 (as max_diff is m-1) so:\n\n    do j=1, max_diff  ! which is m-1, so from 1 to m-1.\n\n        if present(j) ... count.\n\n        So this is correct.\n\nThis code should work.\n\nLet me check possible mistakes.\n\nWait in the first part: the 'allocatable' for arrs is allocated as \"character(len=m) :: arrs(n)\", which is possible via\n\nallocate( character(len=m) :: arrs(n) )\n\nBut in some fortran standards or compiers that may require the allocation be done as:\n\nallocate( arrs(n) ) and with len(m). Wait Not sure. The correct syntax is:\n\nallocate( arrs(n), source=character(len=m) :: ' ' ...) ?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nUsing mold syntax.\n\nBut perhaps better:\n\nThe line:\n\nallocate( character(len=m) :: arrs(n) )\n\nThis is valid in Fortran 2003 to allocate arrays with deferred type parameters. The variable arrs needs to be declared with deferred length:\n\n    arrs must be declared as: character(len=:), allocatable :: arrs(:)\n\nWhich I have in the code above.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the rest:\n\nThen, in the loop where processing each string:\n\n    current_str = arrs(i)\n    posG = index( current_str, 'G' )\n\nBut in fortran, the index is 1-based. So exactly as the Java code.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about the case where the string has no 'G' or 'S'? The problem must ensure that each has exactly one G and one S, so this code is okay but the problem says that?\n\nAssuming the problem ensures valid input.\n\nThen, the 'present' array is initialized to false, and elements set to true as encountered.\n\nThis will count all the unique differences.\n\nOtherwise, when any row had posG > posS, output -1.\n\nThus, this should be the correct code.\n\nWait, but in the code when returnDex is -1, we don't compute the length array beyond the first invalid row? No, in the code:\n\n    If any row has posG> posS, then returnDex becomes -1. But the rest of the rows still have posG compared, and the arr_length(i) is filled with the thing.\n\nBut in that case, those are not counted, since the output is -1.\n\nBut the code only considers the count if returnDex is 0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing:\n\nTest Case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\nGSA\n\nAGS\n\nSGA\n\nWait for the strings:\n\n\"GSA\":\n\nG is at position 1, S at position 2. difference 1.\n\n\"AGS\": positions G is 3, S is 2. So G >S? dexG is 3>2: yes. so the returnDex becomes-1.\n\n\"SGA\": G is at position 3, S is first position, so 3>1, so returnDex is -1.\n\nThus the output is -1. Which code would do.\n\nAnother test case where all are valid.\n\n2 4\n\nGSXX \u2192 the string has G at 1 and S at 2 \u2192 difference 1.\n\nXGSS \u2192 maybe G at position 2, S at 3 and 4. Wait the first S is at 3. So difference 3-2 =1\n\nSo the difference array is [1,1], unique count is 1.\n\nThus, the output is 1.\n\nSo in code, when m=4, max_diff is 3 (since 4-1=3). The present array is allocated 0 to 3.\n\nThe entries are 1 and 1 \u2192 present(1) is true, others no \u2192 count is 1.\n\nThus code gives correct output.\n\nThus the code should be correct."
