    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer N and a long x. Then it reads a list of N long integers called srimeList. The next part initializes a 2D array of Long arrays, costList, where each row i has N elements. \n\nLooking deeper into the loops: For each row i in the costList, the first element (castNum=0) is set to the value in srimeList at position i. Then for each subsequent castNum (from 1 to N-1), the costList[i][castNum] is the minimum of the previous costList[i][castNum-1] and the value at position (i - castNum + N) mod N in srimeList. \n\nWait, the (i - castNum + N) mod N part ensures that the index is modulo N so it stays within the list. That's important. Essentially, for each castNum and i, it's looking at a position that's castNum back (adjusted modulo N). The cost array is storing cumulative minimum values based on the current and previous elements as you move around the circle?\n\nThen, the result list is computed by iterating over each i from 0 to N-1. For each i, the value is calculated as (i * x) plus the sum of the costList arrays' elements at position j = i. Wait, more precisely, for each row in costList (which corresponds to costArray), take the j-th index of each array and sum those. So for each i, the sum of the elements in column i of the costList array? Wait, costList is a list of Long[] arrays. So each costArray is 0-based, and for each element in costList, their j-th element (where j is i, the current row index?) Because the loop variable is 'i', and then j is i. So the code is for all rows (each row in costList), take the j (which is the row's index) and sum those elements? Wait, that might be important. Let me see the original code's result calculation line again:\n\nresult.add( i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n\nHere, 'j' is set to i (final int j = i). So for each cost array in costList, which corresponds to a row in the costList (each row was generated from the row's index i earlier), you take the j-th element. But j is i here. Wait, but the costList has N rows (each i from 0 to N-1), so the costList's rows are from 0 to N-1. For the i loop (in creating results), each iteration's j is the current i, so for result position 0, we are taking each row's [0] position? Wait, no:\n\nWait in the result loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    final int j = i;\n    result.add(i * x + costList.stream().mapToLong(costArray -> costArray[j]).sum());\n}\n\nSo for each i from 0 to N-1:\n\n- j takes the value of i.\n\nThen, the stream over costList (which has N elements, each a Long[] array of N elements).\n\nFor each costArray (the array from each row of costList), the element at j (which is i) is taken. So for each row in the costList, we take the element in column j (which is equal to the current i) of the row's array.\n\nSo sum all the elements in column i across all rows. Then add i * x.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nSuppose N=3:\n\nEach costArray is a 3-element array.\n\nFor the inner sum when i (the loop variable in result) is 0:\n\nj=0.\n\nWe take each row's [0] element and add them. So it's the sum of cost[0][0] + cost[1][0] + cost[2][0]\n\nSimilarly, when i is 1 (j=1), sum all the first columns (index 1) of each row's array.\n\nWait, but why? Let me make sure I haven't misread the code.\n\nThe costList is a list of Long[] arrays. Each row corresponds to the 0-based row number (since for the initialization, they looped i from 0 to N-1, each time adding a new Long[N] array to the costList. Then costList.get(i) is the i-th row.)\n\nSo when the sum is done over all costArrays (the elements of costList) and for each costArray (each row in costList), the value at the j (current result's i) index. \n\nWait, so costList's rows are rows 0, 1, ... N-1. Each corresponds to a row. So the sum for the result at position i is effectively the sum of costList.get(row)[i], where row runs from 0 to N-1. Because j = i, so each row's cost array is accessed at column j.\n\nWait, so the sum over all the rows of the ith column of their cost array. Wait but rows are the first index here. \n\nWait, no, the columns are the second index. Let's see: costList.get(row)[col]. But for the sum, col is i (the current outer loop variable in the result calculation). \n\nSo for each i in result's loop, the sum is of all rows' column i of their array. Then, adding that sum to i * x and putting it into the result list.\n\nThen, finally, the minimum of the result list is printed.\n\nHmm. Now, the problem is translating all of this into Fortran code. Some challenges:\n\n- Java uses generics (List<Long>), but in Fortran, we can use arrays with explicit types.\n\n- The costList is a 2D array. Wait, in Java it's a list of Long arrays, which is effectively a 2D array. So in Fortran, we can use a 2D array to represent it.\n\n- The loops in Java can be directly translated into Fortran with appropriate variables.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the variables:\n\n- N is the input integer.\n\n- x is input long.\n\n- The array of srimeList: in Fortran, an array of size N.\n\n- The costList would be a 2D array (N rows, N columns). In Fortran, this can be declared as something like Integer(8) :: cost(N,N) if we're using integers, but since Java uses long, which is 64-bit, in Fortran can be represented with integer(8). But need to make sure about data types here.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the Long arrays, which for Java would take 64-bit values. So in Fortran, if using default integers, maybe need to use integers of suitable kind, perhaps using integers(8). The input x is read as a Long (since in Java, nextLong is type long).\n\nNow, step by step.\n\nFirst, read N and x. So in Fortran, using a read statement. Probably, we can do:\n\nread*, n, x\n\nThen, array for srimeList has N elements, which can be read as:\n\ninteger(8) :: srimeList(n)\n\nread(n), list...\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran:\n\nProbably:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:), allocatable :: srimeList\n\nThen allocate before reading.\n\nWait, perhaps something like (considering allocation steps).\n\nAlternatively, since we know size N is input, better to use a non-allocatable array with dimension (n). But that requires the variable to be known at compile time, but in this case N is read from input.\n\nHmm. So in modern Fortran, we can use allocatable arrays. Let's structure that.\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc004b\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger(8) :: x\ninteger(8), allocatable :: cost(:,:), srimeList(:)\ninteger(8) :: result_list(:)\ninteger(8) :: min_val\n\n! read N and x\nread*, n, x\n\n! read srimeList:\nallocate(srimeList(n))\nread*, srimeList(:)\n\nThen, initialize the cost array as N rows, N columns. So cost must be a 2D array with dimensions (n, n):\n\nallocate( cost(n, n) )\n\nNow, populating the cost array:\n\nFirst step:\n\nfor each row i in 1 to N (Fortran is 1-based), the first column (j=1) is set to the srimeList(i-1) in Java (since Java is 0-based). So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   cost(i, 1) = srimeList(i) \nend do\n\nWait in Java, for the first term in costList.get(i)[0], the value is srimeList.get(i).\n\nWait, in Java the loops for filling the costList start with:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n   costList.get(i)[0] = srimeList.get(i);\n}\n\nThen for castNum from 1 to N-1 (castNum starts at 1 in the inner loop?), each entry in costList.get(i)[castNum] is the minimum between the previous cast number's value and the element at (i - castNum + N) mod N of the srimeList.\n\nWait, in Fortran loops, since arrays are 1-based, the indices need to be adjusted.\n\nWait first, the inner loops:\n\nIn Java code's loop for the costList filling:\n\nfor (int castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++) {\n   costList.get(i)[castNum] = Math.min( costList.get(i)[castNum - 1], \n                                       srimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N ));\n}\n\nWait, so the point is that for each 'i' (the row), going through castNum from 1 to N-1.\n\nNow, to adjust for Fortran's 1-based indices, some variables might need to shift. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Java's terms:\n\nsrimeList is list from 0 to N-1 (indices), so in Fortran, to get the same element, if the index is (i - castNum + N) mod N, but in Fortran's 1-based mode, if the equivalent Fortran index for srimeList would be (original_j +1), so perhaps when converting, the calculations need to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can proceed with 0-based arrays but that might be harder in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert everything to start from 1 in Fortran's indices and adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me try to re-express the loops.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe have cost as (N, N). The row index is i from 1 to N.\n\nThe first loop (setting cost(row,1)):\n\ndo row = 1, n\n   cost(row,1) = srimeList(row)\nend do\n\nThen, for each row in 1 to N, loop castNum from 2 to N:\n\nWait Java's castNum is starting at 1 (i.e., castNum ranges up to N-1, giving castNum from 1 to N-1 steps, so in Java the columns are 0-based going up to N-1.\n\nWait, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe outer 'i' loops from 0 to N-1 (rows in 0-based to N-1, so in Fortran, rows 1 to N), and the inner loop for castNum starts at 1 and runs castNum < N (so castNum from 1 up to N-1, so the column index (starting at 0 in Java?) Wait, no.\n\nWait in Java's code, for each i (row index (0-based to N-1)):\n\ncostList.get(i) is the row array, which has N elements.\n\nThe first element, castNum=0 (so the first column), is set in first loop.\n\nThen for castNum starting from 1 to N-1, setting elements (current col is castNum, so up to N-1 in 0-based numbering). Since they're using a for loop for castNum from 1 to (N-1) in Java (since castNum is less than N). So in Java, the columns of each row's array have indices 0 to N-1. So for the first step, castNum=1 corresponds to column 1 (Java zero based) which in Fortran is equivalent to position 2? Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code, perhaps the Fortran columns would correspond to castNum from 1 to N, but in the way the loops run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, the columns can be 1 to N.\n\nLet me think step by step for the code's costList[i][castNum]. Let's map the indices:\n\nJava Code:\n\n- For loops:\n\nRow i (from 0 to N-1):\n\nCostList is a list where each element is an array of N elements (0-based).\n\nfor (castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++){\n\nSo castNum runs from 1 to N-1 inclusive, so the castNum can be up to N-1. \n\nThus, for each castNum, it's calculating the value for column castNum (since the starting index was 0).\n\nWait in the first assignment loop:\n\n costList.get(i)[0] = srimeList.get(i). \n\nThen when castNum=1, the column is castNum =1. The element costList[i][castNum] = min( previous, etc. )\n\nIn Fortran, the cost array would have rows from 1 to n and columns 1 to n.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first loop (setting row, cast to 1 column in Fortran):\n\nSetting row starts from 1 to n, and column 1 to each row:\n\ncost(row, 1) = srimeList(row) (since row in Java is 0-based, so the current element matches?)\n\nWait, in Java, srimeList is 0-based. In Fortran, the first element is at 1, so perhaps:\n\nJava's srimeList.get(i) in row i (0-based) would be Fortran's srimeList(i+1), but I think no, maybe for the rows:\n\nWait in Fortran, the initial loop for rows:\n\nrow is from 1 to n corresponds to i from 0 to N-1 in Java. So for each row (starting at 1):\n\n cost( row, 1 ) = srimeList(row)?\n\nBecause Java's srimeList(i) is the first element, in the 0-based list for row i (since the code line is: costList.get(i)[0] = srimeList.get(i). For the first assignment in costList per row, that's corrrect.\n\nYes. So that's correct. The first element of each row (column 1) in Fortran is the original element.\n\nNow, the inner loop:\n\nfor each row, for castNum from 2 to N (in Fortran, because castNum is starting at 1 in Java, but in the Java's loop, castNum starts at 1 and runs from up to N-1).\n\nWait, let me think: \n\nIn the code's loop for inner part:\n\nJava:\nfor (castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++) {\n\nSo in Fortran, castNum starts at 2 (since the first step after the initial set is for cast_num=2 ? Or do I need to reindex variables to 1-based?\n\nLet me clarify variables:\n\nJava's castNum runs from 1 (due to castNum =1) to N-1 (since castNum < N).\n\nIn Fortran, for loops can use a \"do castNum = 1, N-1\"?\n\nWait yes. Let's have in Fortran, for each row:\n\ndo castNum = 2, n\n\nWait no, perhaps keeping it as the same loops:\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\n    do i_row = 1, n\n        ! Set cost(i_row,1) first\n        cost(i_row,1) = srimeList(i_row)\n        ! Then, for subsequent columns:\n        do castNum = 2, n\n            previous = cost(i_row, castNum - 1)\n            ! compute the (i - castNum + N) mod N in Java. But using Fortran indices:\n\n            ! The Java equivalent i (0-based) here corresponds to (i_row -1) (since Fortran starts at 1)\n\n            java_i = i_row-1\n            pos = (java_i - castNum_prev + N) mod N\n            ! Wait, castNum is the current cast number in Java?\n\nHmm, perhaps this part is getting complicated. Let me think:\n\nWait in the Java code, the line in question is:\n\nsrimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N ) \n\nHere, \"i\" is the zero-based row index, \"castNum\" is the loop variable (starting at 1). \n\nSo in Java, when we're in row i (zero-based):\n\nWhen we take castNum = current value (starting at 1), we need to compute (i - castNum + N) mod N.\n\nThe calculation gives an index into the srimeList, which is zero-based.\n\nIn Fortran, the row is i_row (starting at 1), so the corresponding java i is (i_row - 1).\n\nThe castNum in Java's terms is the loop variable in that loop. Since in Java we are loop over castNum starting at 1 to N-1 (because castNum < N).\n\nThus, in the Fortran code:\n\nIn the loop over i_row from 1 to N:\n\n    do castNum = 1 to N-1 (because the Java's castNum was 1 to N-1)\n\nWait wait, original code in Java:\n\nfor (int castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++ )\n\nThus, in java, castNum runs through values 1.. N-1 (so as the upper limit is N-1). \n\nIn Fortran, that would be a loop over castNum from 1 to (N-1):\n\nso inside the row loop:\n\n        do castNum = 1, N-1 \n\n            column = castNum +1? Wait no. Wait the java's castNum is 1 to N-1, so columns 1 to N-1 (since they start at 0). Wait the previous column is castNum -1 in Java's 0-based.\n\nWait in code's Java costList.get(i)[castNum], castNum starts at 1 and is up to N which is not, but since the condition is castNum < N, so the max castNum is N-1, so:\n\nThe Java's code is filling columns 1 (since castNum starts at 1, so castNum corresponds to java columns 1 (index 1 in the array) which is the second element. \n\n Wait, variables in Java:\n\nThe castNum in the inner loop corresponds to which column. For the assignment costList.get(i)[castNum], castNum is the index (0-based up to N-1?), but since it starts at 1.\n\nWait maybe it's better to denote variables as:\n\nIn Java, for castNum from 1 to N-1:\n\nWe compute the value of costList[i][castNum] as min of costList[i][castNum-1] (the previous column's value) and the srimeList element at position (i - castNum + N) mod N. \n\nWait, the position in question is : (i - castNum + N) mod N \n\nBecause the term (i - castNum) could be negative, adding N and modulo N to keep it in 0-based indexes. So it is the same as (i - castNum) mod N. So it's the position (i - castNum) mod N.\n\nWait yes, since modulo N will give between 0 and N-1.\n\nSo (i - castNum) mod N , but let me see examples.\n\nSuppose N is 3.\n\nFor i=0 (the first row in Java), castNum=1:\n\n (0 -1) mod 3 \u2192 -1 mod3 \u2192 2 mod3 \u2192 since modulo in java gives 2 in this case.\n\nWait d0-1 is -1 \u2192 and mod N=3, that's ( -1 + 3 ) mod 3 = 2. So that term is valid.\n\nSo the element is srimeList.get( (i - castNum + N) % N )\n\nThus, in Fortran, to convert this to the calculation:\n\nGiven that in Fortran, the row i is i_row (starting at 1), so the corresponding Java's i = i_row-1.\n\nThe castNum is castNum (from 1 to N-1, since looping from 1 to N-1).\n\nThus, the equivalent position in the Fortran's srimeList array would be:\n\njava_index = ( (i_row-1) - castNum ) mod N \n\nWait but since modulo can be negative, adding N before mod?\n\nWait same as Java: ( (i_row-1) - castNum + N ) mod N \n\nSo:\n\nmod_value = ( (i_row -1) - castNum + N) mod N\n\nthen element is srimeList[ mod_value + 1 ]? Because the srimeList is 1-based in Fortran.\n\nYes. So that's the position in the srimeList.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute pos_java = mod( ( (i_row -1) - castNum + N ), N ) \n\nThen, in Java that's the zero-based position. So Fortran array is 1-based, so the actual index is pos_java + 1. Wait no, because in Fortran:\n\nsrimeList has elements 1-based. So the Java index zero-based x corresponds to element x+1 in Fortran. So yes, the position in Fortran array is pos_java +1.\n\nSo the value to grab is srimeList( pos +1 )\n\nTherefore, the formula for the candidate value is the minimum between the previous value (cost(i_row, castNum) ) 's current idea?\n\nWait, in Java, the current row is i (0-based), and for the castNum th iteration (starting at 1), the castNum is the current column's index (so castNum is 1\u2026N-1, which would correspond to column indices 1 through N-1 in 0-based indexing? Wait, no. Wait, the columns in costList's array's index is 0 to N-1.\n\nIn the Java code, for the current castNum, which is the loop variable:\n\n cost[castNum] is column castNum.\n\nThus in the loop over castNum from 1 to N-1:\n\nThe previous (column castNum -1) is the 0-based index.\n\n Thus, in Fortran terms, column up to castNum starts at column 1 (for castNum=1). The previous (castNum-1) would be 0.\n\nThus, in Fortran's terms, for a given castNum in the loop, this translates to column (castNum+1) ?\n\n Wait maybe not. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, the cost array is:\n\ncost(i_row, cast_col)\n\nwhere cast_col starts at 1 (since columns are 1-based starting from the first element set).\n\n In Java code, for the castNum =1:\n\n the column is 1 in 0-based(J) becomes column 2 in Fortran. Wait no.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to adjust variables:\n\nLet me re-define variables in Fortran terms:\n\n- The row index in Fortran loops as i_row from 1 to n.\n\n- castNum in loops in Fortran: from 1 to (Java's N-1?), which remains 1 ton-1.\n\nAnd the column number in Fortran's cost array corresponding to the variable castNum is:\n\ncolumn = castNum.\n\nSo, for each castNum in the inner loop, the cost(i_row, castNum) should be set to min( cost(i_row, castNum-1), ... )\n\nWait, in Fortran, cost(i_row, 1) is already set from the first loop. \n\nFor castNum from 2 to n-1? Wait no, looping castNum from 1 (Java's castNum) to N-1 (Java's castNum):\n\nWait, in that case:\n\nIn the inner loop:\n\nfor castNum =1 to N-1:\n\ncurrent column is castNum (in 1-based).\n\nBut then for the first iteration (castNum=1 in we are in column1? No need, because column1 was already set. \n\nWait yes that would be a problem. Because when castNum=1 in the loop, the castNum is used to calculate column1?\n\nWait, let's see in Java code:\n\nThe first element (column0) is set outside the loop. Then, inside loop of castNum from 1 to N-1 (inclusive), and the columns set are up to castNum which is N-1. The loop is for setting columns from 1... N-1 (Java zero-based, which would be columns 1 to N in Fortran's 1-based if needed? No, maybe not. \n\nWait, in Java, the castNum loop runs over castNum starting at1 to N-1. So the column indices in the cost are going from 1 to N-1 (zero-based) in their lists.\n\nSo, in Fortran's cost array column numbering (1-based), that would be columns 2 to N.\n\nBut that complicates. Alternatively, perhaps the castNum in Fortran should start at 2, but this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the loops can be re-edited to be 1-based in Fortran with adjusted variables.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of rephrasing the loop as follows:\n\nJava code:\n\nfor (int castNum = 1; castNum < N; castNum++) {\n\n    costList.get(i)[castNum] = Math.min( costList.get(i)[castNum-1], ... )\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nDo castNum in 2 to N\n\n ...\n\nWait but that could be. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we translate the Java loop:\n\nIn Java code, castNum runs from 1 to N-1 (Java cast variable starting at 1, loop while cast < N)\n\nCastNum represents the current column (zero-based) to process. \n\nEach iteration processes this castNum, which is the new column. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the equivalent columns (1-based) are castNum +1. Because:\n\nJava zero-based column is (castNum). So for castNum=1, column is 1 (0-based), but in Fortran's 1-based, 2?\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to just shift variables. Let me instead of castNum in 1-based, use Fortran's variable col for each current column, going from 2 to N steps, because first column was already set.\n\nWait let me re-phrase the code's loops in Fortran.\n\nLet me outline steps again:\n\nFor each row in 1..n:\n\n    set column 1 = row's srimList value\n\n    for col =2 to n:\n\n        previous = cost(row, col-1)\n\n        compute the position needed for the srimeList element.\n\n        ...?\n\nWait, that might be equivalent \n\nThe col in 2..N corresponds to castNum in 1... N-1 in Java terms (since when col is 2 is castNum=1). \n\nThus:\n\nthe Java castNum is equal to col-1 in this scenario.\n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the variables:\n\nJava castNum corresponds to (col -1) in this Fortran loop.\n\nSo the term (i - castNum + N) mod N,\n\nConverted in Fortran terms:\n\ni_j = i_row-1 ( since row is 1-based)\n\ncastJava = col -1 \n\npos_javIndex = (i_j - castJava + N) mod N \n\n= (i_j - (col-1) + N) mod N \n\nThen the value to take is srimeList( pos_javIndex +1 ) (convert 0-based to 1-based)\n\nSo:\n\nposition_in_fortran = mod( (i_j - (col-1) + N), N ) +1\n\nWith mod operation here should be handled correctly in Fortran. \n\n( Wait, however, in FORTRAN modulo, negative numbers give positive modulus? For example, in Java, mod is (a mod n) in Java may give a negative value if a is negative, but in Fortran's modulo function, the result has the sign of the n (the divisor) when the first argument is negative. So perhaps to ensure it's correct, adding N before mod?)\n\nWait, for example:\n\nmod( (i_j - (col-1) ), N ) \n\nBut that could be negative. Let me see: \n\ni_j is (row is 1-based, so i_j = i_row-1 \u2265 0)\n\n(col-1) can be up to (N-1 -1) ? Wait no. Since col runs from 2 to N:\n\ncol can be as big as N \u2192 then col-1 = N-1.\n\nSo i_j can be up to N-1 (if i_row is N, then i_j = N-1). \n\nThus i_j - (col-1) can be as low as (N-1) - (N-1) = 0 \u2192 down to (0 - (N-1)), like - (N-1). \n\nSo mod( (- (N-1)), N ) \u2192 N-1 (but with mod function in Fortran)?\n\nWait in Fortran, the modulo function is modulo(a,b) where the result has the same sign as b. \n\nSo modulo(-5, 3) would be +1?\n\nLet me check:\n\nmodulo( (i_j - (col-1)), N) \n\nWait modulo(a, b) is basically the remainder r such that a = (a/b)*b + r, with 0 <= r < |b|. \n\nWait actually, the sign depends on the implementation? Or is it defined as per mathematics?\n\nWait according to Fortran documentation: \n\nThe modulo function returns a mod p = A - (B * floor(A / B)) )\n\nBut the value would be such that modulo(x, y) is congruent to x modulo y, but with the same sign as y.\n\nWait perhaps an example:\n\nSuppose N =3, for example:\n\ni_row=1 (so i_j=0), col is 2.\n\nSo (i_j - (col-1) )= 0 -1 = -1 \n\nmodulo(-1, 3) is (-1)/3 \u2192 -0.333 \u2192 floor is -1 \u2192 -1 *3 \u2192-3 \u2192 0- ( -3) \u2192 3 \u2192 subtract 3 \u2192 modulo(-1,3) \u2192 2?\n\nYes, 3*(-1) +2 = -3 +2 = -1. So 2. \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, ( -2 ) mod 3 \u2192 1? Because 3*(-1)= -3 \u2192 -2 - (-3) = 1. \n\nSo yes, the modulo calculation works. \n\nTherefore, modulo( i_j - (col-1), N ) gives between 0 and N-1.\n\nHence, the element is at the zero-based index modulo( (i_j - col +1 -1 ), N ) \u2192 Wait.\n\nWait, computed as pos = modulo( i_j - (col-1) , N )\n\nYes. \n\nSo then absolute index in the Fortran list is pos +1. \n\nThus, putting it all together into Fortran.\n\nLet me code that loop:\n\n    do row =1, n\n        ! first column is set:\n        cost(row, 1) = srimeList(row)\n\n        do col=2, n\n            previous_val = cost(row, col-1 )\n\n            ! compute the position in the srimeList\n            i_j = row -1\n            cast_j = col -1\n            pos_java = modulo( i_j - cast_j + 0, n ) \n\n            ! or perhaps \n\n            pos_java = modulo( (i_j - cast_j), n ) \n\n            element_value = srimeList( pos_java +1 )\n            new_val = min( previous_val, element_value )\n            cost( row, col ) = new_val\n        end do\n    end do\n\nYes, this looks correct.\n\nSo the inner loops should work this way.\n\nNow, the next part is the result array:\n\nThe sum over all rows of cost( row, column=j ), where column j is the current index in the outer loops (i from 1 to N).\n\nIn the result calculation in Java:\n\nresult.add( i_val *x + sum( costList.get(krow)[i_val] for krow in 0..N-1 )\n\nWait, the variable 'i' in Java loops from 0 to N-1. The variable 'i' here is which in Fortran becomes (current i in 1-based from 1 to n).\n\nWait Java's 'i' in the loop:\n\nfor (int i =0; i < N; i++) { \n\n   j =i \n\n   ... sum all costArrays (rows of the costList) at column j \n\n}\n\nSo for each i (Java 0-based, corresponding to Fortran j_val= I+1),\n\nthen sum over each row of cost[ row ][ I ] from Java's arrays. \n\nWait in Java, the row is referring to costList.get(k_row)[j], where j is (Java i). \n\nIn Fortran, the rows are 1-based. \n\nThus:\n\nfor each i (in 1-based in Fortran, ranging from 1 to N):\n\nthe column value we are using is (i-1) ?\n\nWait no, let's see:\n\nJava's i is from 0 to N-1 \u2192 column index for each row is i (zero-based).\n\nSo in Fortran, when the outer loop is for i_val in 1 to N (equivalent to Java's i from 0 to N-1), then the column being accessed in each row is i_val_minus_1?\n\nWait, need to link variables:\n\nIn Java for the result loop:\n\nLoop over 'i' from 0 < N, J is set to i. \n\nThus for rows 0 to N-1 in Java (i_val_java):\n\nthe column is J =i_val_java, so zero-based.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nLooping over i_val from 1 to N.\n\nThe corresponding java i_val_java is i_val -1.\n\nThus the desired column is (i_val_java = i_val -1) thus in 0-based. But in Fortran's 1-based column, we need to add 1?\n\nWait no. The column in Fortran for that value is (i_val_java +1).\n\nWait, not the column, but in the fortan's cost columns: since the Java's column j (0-based) corresponds to column j+1 in Fortran.\n\nThus, to get the column for each row in Fortran, we have column = (i_val_java +1) \u2192 because the Java column j is (i_val_java).\n\nWait yes. So in Fortran:\n\n for each i_val in 1..n: (Java's i is (i_val -1))\n\n desired column = (i_val -1) +1 = i_val \u2192 so column index =i_val.\n\nThus, for each i_val in 1 to N, the required column is (i_val), so the cost( kj_row , i_val ), for all rows kj_row from 1 to N.\n\nThus, the sum over all rows of their column i_val's element.\n\nThen, the term is (i_val -1) * x : wait no, \n\nWait in Java:\n\nJava's i is the loop variable (0-based) of the 'i' in the loop.\n\nJava's term is i * x. \n\nBecause the Java expression is i (starts at 0) multiplied by x. So for i in Fortran as i_val (1-based), the corresponding i in Java is i_val -1 \u2192 the term is (i_val-1)*x.\n\nSo the sum over all the cost[k_row][ column = (i_val) ].\n\nPutting this all together, the Fortran result array can be computed as follows:\n\nallocate( result_list(n) )\n\ndo i_val=1, n\n    current = (i_val-1)*x ! Java's i *x\n    total = 0\n    do k_row=1, n\n        ! term is cost(k_row, i_val)\n        ! since column i_val corresponds to the Java index (i_val -1), so the column is exactly i_val in Fortran.\n\n        total = total + cost( k_row, i_val )\n    end do\n    current = current + total\n    result_list(i_val) = current\nend do\n\nThen, find the minimum value in the result_list array.\n\nFinally, print the minimum.\n\nNow, to compute the minimum in Fortran, you can use the minval intrinsic:\n\nmin_val = minval(result_list)\n\nand print it.\n\nNow, let me structure the code:\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc004b2\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, i_row, cast_col\n  integer(8) :: x\n  integer(8), allocatable :: cost(:,:), srimeList(:), result_list(:)\n  integer(8) :: min_val\n\n  read*, n, x\n\n  allocate( srimeList(n) )\n  read*, srimeList(1:n)\n\n  allocate( cost(n, n) )\n  allocate( result_list(n) )\n\n  ! Initialize first column\n  do i_row =1, n\n     cost(i_row, 1) = srimeList(i_row)\n  end do\n\n  ! Fill the rest of the cost array\n  do i_row =1, n\n     do cast_col =2, n\n        ! compute previous_val:\n        integer(8) :: previous_val = cost(i_row, cast_col-1)\n\n        ! calculate the java indices\n        integer :: i_j = i_row -1\n        integer :: cast_j = cast_col-1\n\n        integer :: pos_in_srime = modulo( i_j - cast_j, n )\n\n        ! since modulo is from 0 to n-1, convert to java 0-based:\n        ! SrimeList in java is 0-based, so the position is pos_in_srime.\n\n        ! so the actual element is srimeList (pos_in_srime + 1, since fortran is 1-based\n\n        integer :: new_element = srimeList( pos_in_srime + 1 )\n        ! Now, compare previous_val and new_element, pick the smaller.\n\n        cost(i_row, cast_col) = min( previous_val, new_element )\n     end do\n  end do\n\n  ! Now compute the result list:\n  do i_val =1, n\n     integer(8) :: current = (i_val -1)*x\n     integer(8) :: sum_col =0\n     do k_row =1, n\n        ! the column in cost is i_val (1-based in the original term leads to correct column)\n        sum_col = sum_col + cost(k_row, i_val)\n     end do\n     current = current + sum_col\n     result_list(i_val) = current\n  end do\n\n  min_val = minval( result_list )\n  print*, min_val\n\nend program atcoder_agc004b2\n\nHmm, but I should check data types and possible array indices.\n\nWait in the calculation of the current variable:\n\nIn the first loop (initialization):\n\nsrimeList is read as dimension (n). Each element is an integer(8). cost is also integer(8).\n\nThe modulo calculation for i_j - cast_j could be an integer except for n.\n\nWait: in Fortran, in the pos_in_srime:\n\nthe i_j and cast_j are both integers (since i_row, cast_col are integers).\n\nYes, so i_j - cast_j is integer (could be negative), and mod(n) is between 0 and n-1, so that's okay.\n\nThe srimeList has to be accessed at (pos_in_srime +1), which will be between 1 and N.\n\nThus, the index is okay.\n\nOther than that, we need to ensure that all assignments to cost are properly done.\n\nAlso in the loops over cast_col from 2 to n.\n\nWait, in the loop for cast_col in 2 to n:\n\nCast_col starts at 2, which is cast_j = cast_col-1 \u2192 1 in java.\n\nThe maximum cast_col is N, so cast_j = N-1. Which for the Java term cast_j must not exceed (since N-1 was the previous upper limit.\n\nThus, this is safe.\n\nAnother possible issue: what is when one of the modulo(\u2026) calculations?\n\nWait modulo expects an integer and n is also an integer, so no problem.\n\nLooking at the code, variables:\n\nsrimeList and the cost arrays are properly allocated.\n\nNow, let's check the result list computation:\n\nfor i_val = 1 to n:\n\nthe first term is (i_val-1)*x \u2192 correct.\n\nsumming over all rows' costs for column i_val. The column i_val is exactly the current position: since in Fortran's column numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the minimum is taken of the resulting array, then printed.\n\nThe code should work. \n\nWait, but need to remove any redundant variables declarations inside loops. Wait in Fortran, variables have to be declared in a declaration region.\n\nSo in the cost loop, the lines:\n\nprevious_val is an integer(8), and cast_col loops inside loop.\n\nThus need to move that variable declaration inside the do i_row loop or as a separate declared variable before loops.\n\nHmm right, in the current code I have inside the first i_row loop:\n\nprevious_val is declared inside that loop. That's not correct.\n\nWait in current code:\n\n        do i_row =1, n\n            do cast_col =2, n\n                integer(8) :: previous_val = cost(i_row, cast_col-1)\n\nThat's invalid. In Fortran, variable declarations must be inside a declaration section, not within loops.\n\nAh that's a mistake. Need to fix that.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\nInside the first i_row loop:\n\ninteger(8) :: previous_val (should be declared outside the cast_col loop)\n\nWait better to declare inside the loop but in a declaration region.\n\nperhaps:\n\ndo i_row =1, n\n\n   ! declare previous_val here?\n\nBut in Fortran, within a DO loop, you can't declare variables except in a declaration region preceded by IMPLICIT NONE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inside the cast_col loop, previous_val can be assigned via calculation.\n\nWait perhaps better:\n\ninstead of declaring it, just compute the value inline.\n\nWait previous_val is:\n\ncost( i_row, cast_col-1 )\n\nThus:\n\nnew_element is the value from the list.\n\ncost( i_row, cast_col ) = min( cost(i_row, cast_col -1), new_element )\n\nThus, do not need the variable. \n\nAh, right. So maybe that variable declaration was error-prone. I can just do:\n\ncost( i_row,cast_col ) = min( cost(i_row, cast_col-1), new_element )\n\nso the code can omit the temporary variable previous_val. \n\nYes, that's better. \n\nSo modifying the loop to remove that variable:\n\nInside the i_row and cast_col loop:\n\n            ! previous is cost(i_row, cast_col -1 )\n\n            integer :: i_j = i_row -1\n            integer :: cast_j = cast_col-1\n\n            integer :: pos_in_srime = modulo( i_j - cast_j, n )\n\n            integer(8) :: new_element = srimeList( pos_in_srime + 1 )\n\n            cost(i_row, cast_col) = min( cost( i_row, cast_col-1 ), new_element )\n\nHence, removing previous_val variable.\n\nThat's better. \n\nSimilarly, in other parts, no problem.\n\nHence, updated code:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc004b\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8) :: N, x\n  integer, allocatable :: tmp1, tmp2\n  integer(8), allocatable :: cost(:,:), srimeList(:), result_list(:)\n  integer(8) :: min_val\n\n  read*, N, x\n\n  allocate( srimeList(N) )\n  read*, srimeList(1:N)\n\n  allocate( cost(N, N) )\n  allocate( result_list(N) )\n\n  ! Initialize first column\n  integer :: i_row, cast_col\n  do i_row =1, N\n     cost(i_row, 1) = srimeList(i_row)\n  end do\n\n  ! Fill the rest of the cost array\n  do i_row =1, N\n     do cast_col = 2, N\n        ! calculate the position in srimeList:\n        integer :: i_j = i_row-1\n        integer :: cast_j = cast_col-1\n        integer :: pos_in_srime = modulo( i_j - cast_j, N )\n        integer(8) :: new_element = srimeList( pos_in_srime +1 )\n\n        cost(i_row, cast_col) = min( cost( i_row, cast_col-1 ), new_element )\n     end do\n  end do\n\n  ! Compute result list\n  integer :: i_val\n  do i_val =1, N\n     integer(8) :: current = (i_val-1)*x\n     integer(8) :: total =0\n     integer :: k_row\n     do k_row =1, N\n        total = total + cost(k_row, i_val)\n     end do\n     current = current + total\n     result_list(i_val) = current\n  end do\n\n  min_val = minval( result_list )\n  print*, min_val\n\nend program atcoder_agc004b\n\nAh yes, now variables inside loops should be properly declared.\n\nWait in the first loop (i_row loop):\n\nthe loops have no variables, except the variables declared outside.\n\nWait in the inner loop for cast_col:\n\nvariables i_j, cast_j, pos_in_srime, new_element are declared locally. Since in the loop's block, need to use a declaration section with 'Integer' etc.\n\nWait in Fortran standard (before Fortran 2003), the order of declarations must come before the executable statements.\n\nWait in the code above, in the inner loop:\n\ndo cast_col =2,N\n\n    integer variables -> that's not possible in f77 compliant code.\n\nHence, this would produce an error.\n\nAh, right. To fix this, declarations have to be placed in the main program's declaration section, or inside if using Fortran 90/95.\n\n Wait in Fortran 90+, one can use \"declarative blocks\" using a 'block' statement or just declare variables in the main declaration.\n\nThus, perhaps I can rearrange the code to have variables declared in the main function.\n\nAlternatively, rewrite the problematic loops.\n\nDecisions:\n\nIn the loops for cast_col:\n\nThe variables i_j, cast_j, pos_in_srime, and new_element can be declared in the main program's declaration block.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nAt the top, after the integer(8) declares:\n\n declare variables:\n\ninteger ::i_row, cast_col, i_val, i_j, cast_j, pos_in_srime, k_row\n\ninteger(8) :: new_element \n\nWait wait new_element is integer(8), while srimeList is integer(8), so that makes sense.\n\nSo declarations:\n\n program atcoder_agc004b \n\n  implicit none\n\n integer :: N, i_row, cast_col, i_val, i_j, cast_j, pos_in_srime, k_row\n integer(8) ::x\n integer(8), allocatable :: cost(:,:), srimeList(:), result_list(:)\n integer(8) :: min_val\n\n ... \n\nThen in the loops, use variables as integers except for new_element.\n\nHence, the code can be fixed by removing the variable declarations inside loops.\n\nRevised code:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc004b\n\n implicit none\n\n integer :: N, i_row, cast_col, i_val, k_row, i_j, cast_j, pos_in_srime\n integer(8) :: x\n integer(8), allocatable :: cost(:,:), srimeList(:), result_list(:)\n integer(8) :: new_element, min_val\n\n read*, N, x\n\n allocate( srimeList(N) )\n read*, srimeList(1:N)\n\n allocate( cost(N, N) )\n allocate( result_list(N) )\n\n ! Initialize first column\n do i_row =1, N\n    cost(i_row, 1) = srimeList(i_row)\n end do\n\n ! Fill the rest of the cost array\n do i_row =1, N\n    do cast_col =2, N\n        ! Variables:\n        i_j = i_row -1\n        cast_j = cast_col -1\n        pos_in_srime = modulo( i_j - cast_j, N )\n\n        new_element = srimeList( pos_in_srime + 1 )\n\n        cost(i_row, cast_col) = min( cost(i_row, cast_col-1), new_element )\n    end do\n end do\n\n ! Compute the result list\n do i_val =1, N\n    integer(8) :: current = (i_val-1)*x\n    current = current + sum( cost(1:N, i_val) )\n    result_list(i_val) = current\n end do\n\n min_val = minval(result_list)\n print*, min_val\n\nend program atcoder_agc004b \n\nWait, also in the result calculation: previously I have used a loop over k_row, adding each cost(k_row, i_val). But instead, we can use sum(cost(:, i_val)), but how is this done in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran 90+, the array sections can be used with array functions.\n\nThus:\n\ncurrent = (i_val-1)*x + sum( cost( 1:N, i_val ) )\n\nSo the inner do loop is not necessary. That simplifies the code.\n\nThus, the previous code was:\n\n sum=0:\n\n do k_row =1,N\n   total += cost(k_row, i_val )\n end do\n\nbut with the sum function, it's better.\n\nSimilarly, in the cast_col loop, the variables are now properly declared in the program's declaration block.\n\nWait also: new_element is of type integer(8), declared at the top.\n\nI think that now the code is correct.\n\nNow some final points:\n\n- variables are declared in the proper scopes.\n\n- the arrays are properly sized.\n\n- the modulo operation is handled correctly.\n\n- all casts and indices are correct.\n\nHence, the code should translate correctly."
