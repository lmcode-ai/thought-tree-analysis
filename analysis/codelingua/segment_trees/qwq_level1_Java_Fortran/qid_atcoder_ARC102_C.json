So in Fortran:\n\nif (mod(i,2)==0) then \n\n   active = active - 1 \n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, MOD function returns remainder, but mod(a,b) where b is positive gives the remainder. Yes. Then the variables times2 and total are initialized.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by looking at the code carefully. \n\nThe Java code starts with importing a Scanner and then defines a class with a main method. The main part initializes a 2D array for combinations (nchoosek), precomputes it using the binomial coefficients formula, and then reads inputs k and n. There's a loop from 2 to 2k, and for each i, it calculates some values based on pairs, active, and then loops over j to compute some sum that's printed out modulo mod.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, there are a few differences to note. For instance, arrays are declared with dimensions. Also, Fortran uses modules instead of classes, but a main program can be written without a module. Since this is a single program, I can structure it as a FUNCTION or just a main block.\n\nThe mod variable is a constant set to 998244353. In Fortran, we can declare this as a PARAMETER. The nchoosek is a 2D array. Since Java uses a 2D array of integers (long), in Fortran I might need to use INTEGER*8 (or similar for 64-bit integers) for the arrays to handle the modulus.\n\nLooking at the initialization: In Java, the first loop sets the first and last elements of each row (since for i from 0 to 4000: nchoosek[i][0] =1, nchoosek[i][i] =1. Then the next loops compute the combinations in the middle using the recurrence relation.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to precompute the combinations in a 2D array. Since the array is symmetric (n choose k = n choose n-k), perhaps there's a more efficient way, but the code uses the standard dynamic programming approach. So I'll follow the same logic.\n\nNow, variables in Fortran: Need to declare all variables at the start of the program. The loops in Java are for (int i=0; i <nchoosek.length; i....). The array nchoosek in Java is initialized as new long[4001][4001], which in Fortran would be a 4001x4001 2D array of integers (assuming 64-bit integers here, so maybe using integer(8)).\n\nWait, let me think: in Fortran, arrays are declared with size parameters. The maximum indices here are 4000, so we can set the dimensions to (4001,4001). For example:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(4001,4001) :: nchoosek\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. Oh, important! The Java code uses 0-based indices, starting at 0 for rows and columns. This is a difference. So in Fortran, the arrays would be from 1 to 4000 (since in Java it's up to 4000 inclusive). Or perhaps it's better to make them 0-based in Fortran? Or handle the indices accordingly.\n\nHmm, perhaps adjusting Java indices to Fortran. In Java, for (i =0 to 4000). In Fortran, we can have the array from 0 to 4000, but for Fortran's 1-based, probably, it's safer to use a declared array size with (0:4000,0:4000), making it explicit.\n\nAlternatively, adjust all indices to be 1-based. Let me see. For example, in the initialization loop:\n\nIn Java:\nfor (int i =0; i < nchoosek.length; i++) {\n    nchoosek[i][0] =1;\n    nchoosek[i][i] =1;\n}\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is nchoosek(4001,4001), with indices from 0 to 4000 (or maybe 1 to 4001?), need to be precise here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use (0:4000,0:4000) in Fortran.\n\nSo, in Fortran declarations:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:4000,0:4000) :: nchoosek\n\nSame for loops.\n\nProceeding with the nchoosek initialization.\n\nWait, in Java's code:\n\nThe code for nchoosek starts with i from 0 to 4000 (since new long[4001][4001], indices 0-4000), and initializes nchoosek[i][0] and nchoosek[i][i] to 1.\n\nThe first loop only initializes those two elements per row.\n\nThen for each i >=2, j from 1 to i-1:\n\nnchoosek[i][j] = ( ... etc ). \n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nDO i =0, 4000\n\n    nchoosek(i,0) =1\n\n    nchoosek(i,i) =1\n\nNot sure what for rows where i < j, but since in the second loop, i starts from 2, etc.\n\nThen after that, the second loop:\n\nDO i =2, 4000\n\n   DO j =1, i-1\n\n     nchoosek(i,j) = mod( nchoosek(i-1,j)+nchoosek(i-1,j-1), modvalue )\n\n     ... etc.\n\nWait, need to make sure that the indices are correct here. \n\nOkay, moving to the variables:\n\nMod is set to 998244353. In Fortran, declare it as a parameter, e.g.:\n\nINTEGER,PARAMETER :: mod = 998244353\n\nThe code's scanner reads two integers k and n, which are input variables. So in Fortran, the input is read with a READ statement.\n\nThen the outer for loop runs from i=2 to 2*k. But in cases where k is large, like if k is up to (given the problem's constraints, I suppose 2*k would be up to the 4000 limit per the array size).\n\nWait, the nchoosek array is size 4001 (so 4000 maximum in 0-based). So the maximum value for i in the outer loop is 2*k, but the code uses nchoosek in the loops where i can go up to 4000. Therefore, I assume that the constraints given in the problem ensure that k is up to 2000, but maybe the problem says that but I don't need to check that.\n\nProceeding.\n\nIn Fortran, loops use DO ... ENDDO.\n\nThe loop:\n\nfor (int i =2; i <=2*k; i++) \n\nIn Fortran: do i=2, 2*k, 1, since it increments by 1.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran 90, the k must be a variable. So perhaps:\n\nDo i =2, 2*k\n\n   ...\n\nEnddo\n\nOkay.\n\nInside the loop, variables pairs, active are calculated. The condition:\n\nif (i >k) then\n\n            pairs = k - i /2 \n\nelse\n\n            pairs = (i-1)/2 \n\nWait, but in Java the integers are divided with integer division. So in Fortran, (i-1)/2 would be integer division.\n\nBut Fortran has real division and integer division, so (i-1)/2 should be integer. Need to use integer division, but since i is an integer variable, (i-1)/2 would just be integer in Fortran inherent division.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if dividing two integers, the result is REAL unless using integer division with INT function?\n\nWait, actually in Fortran,\n\nthe expression 2/5 is 0 if using integers.\n\nSo, in the Java code, when assigning pairs, for i >k, the expression is k minus (i divided by 2 integer division).\n\nIn Fortran, that would be written as\n\npairs = k - i/2 \n\nSimilarly, (i-1)/2 is (i minus 1)/2 in Fortran integer division.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen active is calculated as k - 2*pairs. \n\nThen, if i%2 ==0, active -=1. So in Fortran:\n\nif (mod(i,2)==0) then \n\n   active = active - 1 \n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, MOD function returns remainder, but mod(a,b) where b is positive gives the remainder.\n\nYes.\n\nThen the variables times2 and total are initialized. Times2 starts as 1 (so initializes to 1?), and total to 0. \n\nFor loops j from 0 to pairs. Note that pairs could be up to k (if i is up to 2k).\n\nThen compute choice as (times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j)) mod mod\n\ntimes2 is then set to (times2 *2 ) mod mod.\n\nWait, the next statement after the assignment of choice is to multiply times2 by 2 each step. So in Java code, it's \n\ntimes2 = times2 *2 % mod;\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ntimes2 = mod( times2 * 2, mod )\n\nSame applies for each step.\n\nThe next lines involve calculations with the combination arrays. \n\nThe first term added to total is:\n\nchoice * nchoosek(n + active -1, active + j -1 )\n\nWait, no, nchoosek is an array. The indices of the second array (nchoosek) would require careful check.\n\nLooking at the Java code line:\n\ntotal += choice * nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1];\n\nSo in Fortran terms, the row is (n + active -1) and the column is (active +j -1).\n\nBut in Java, the binomial coefficients are stored in nchoosek[N][k], which is the number for N choose k. So the way to compute C(a, b) is via array[a][b], but in the code, what is a and b here.\n\nWait, in Java code, nchoosek[i][j] is equal to the value of combination (i choose j). Wait yes, that's the standard setup. So the array is storing combination[i][j] for C(i,j).\n\nTherefore the term choice * nchoosek[n + active -1][active + j -1]\n\ntranslates to (n + active -1 choose active + j -1), etc.\n\nThus in Fortran, it should be nchoosek( n + active -1, active + j -1 ), provided that the array has those indices.\n\nBut need to check the indices here. For example, when I write n + active -1, is it in the permissible range?\n\nWe have to ensure that n+active-1 does not exceed 4000, the maximum row in the array.\n\nSo, let's think. The problem constraints: the original array nchoosek is 4001 x4001 (rows and cols 0-based to 4000). But in some cases, maybe n could be up to N as given. The problem's n is the input variable, which can be up to... well, the original Java code does read n and k. The problem might be a programming competition problem.\n\nAssuming the inputs n and k are within the constraints such that n+active -1 is within bounds. The initial array computed up to n choose k would have to be big enough. Since the code uses 4001 rows (so up to n + ... can be up to 4000?), but perhaps n can be up to 10000? Wait the code might not handle that. But given that the array is 4000, perhaps this code is from a problem with constraints that n and the terms involved don't exceed 4000?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual maximum n in the problem is 2000, but the user's example here is the code for solving such a problem. I'll proceed with the code as is, assuming the arrays are big enough.\n\nProceeding with the code translation.\n\nIn the loop over j:\n\nfor(int j=0; j<=pairs; j++) {\n\nthe inner loop's j runs from 0 to pairs.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nDO j=0,pairs\n\n   ... the code lines ...\n\nENDDO\n\nNow, the choice variable in Fortran:\n\nchoice = (times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j)) mod mod \n\nWait, mod is the name of a constant defined as 998244353, but mod is a function in Fortran. Oh right, so that's a problem. The variable name mod conflicts with the Fortran intrinsic function MODULO. \n\nWait the original code in Java uses 'mod' as a static int variable. In Fortran, naming a variable 'mod' is bad because MOD is a function. The user should rename it.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nIn the Java code, static mod is 998244353. So in Fortran, we need to have a parameter with a different name like:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MOD = 998244353\n\nYes, so that MOD is the parameter. Then the mod operator can be MOD(a,b) function, but we can use modtype with MOD function.\n\nSo when taking modulo, it becomes MOD( expression , MOD )\n\nWait, but need to be careful with variables.\n\nTherefore:\n\nchoice = MOD( (times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j)), MOD )\n\nThen, times2 is set to MOD( times2 * 2, MOD )\n\nOkay.\n\nThe next lines have:\n\ntotal += choice * nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1];\n\nThen if (i %2 ==0) add another term.\n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\ntotal = total + (choice * ...\n\nWait, need to use modulo at each step since numbers may overflow beyond 64 bits. Thus the Java code does the modulo after each addition, so need to do the same in Fortran.\n\nWait, the Java code's total is initialized to 0, and then in each iteration, it adds to total, and after that does total %= mod (and then adds the other term's contribution if i even, and then another mod).\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nthe lines inside the j loop:\n\ntotal += choice * nchoosek[ ... ]\n\nthen, if (i even):\n\ntotal += choice * nchoosek[ ... ]\n\nthen, total %= mod;\n\nWait in the Java code, after adding both terms, they mod by mod.\n\nSo in code:\n\nin Fortran:\n\nThe first part:\n\nterm1 = nchoosek(...)\n\ntotal = total + (choice * term1)\n\nthen if even:\n\nterm2 = nchoosek(...)\n\ntotal = total + (choice * term2)\n\nthen total = mod( total, MOD )\n\nWait but also, need to compute the terms modulo MOD, but since we are adding to total which is accumulating moded. So perhaps in Fortran:\n\nWe can write:\n\ntotal = (total + (choice * nchoosek(n + active-1, active + j-1))) MOD MOD\n\nbut that might not work directly. Let's see step by step:\n\nOriginal Java code does:\n\ntotal += ... ;\n\nthen \n\nif (....) {\n\n   total += ... \n\n}\n\nthen total %= mod\n\nSo in code sequence:\n\ntotal = total + term1;\n\nif (... even ...) total += term2;\n\ntotal = (total % MOD + MOD) % MOD; \n\nWait, but in case total becomes negative (though the problem probably doesn't lead to that here) to wrap to positive mod.\n\nAlternatively, it's probably just total % mod, but to ensure it stays positive mod.\n\nIn Fortran, using MOD function from intrinsic, perhaps:\n\nIn code:\n\ntemp = (choice * term1) \ntotal = total + temp\nif ( even ) then \n   term2_part = (choice * term2 )\n   total = total + term2_part \nend if \n\ntotal = MOD(total, MOD)\n\nBut integer arithmetic here, so I need to ensure that the addition doesn't overflow. But with modulus being about 1e9, and the total could be up to (something mod 1e9) plus ... but using mod.\n\nAlternatively, better to mod each term before adding to total.\n\nWait, but in the problem code, the intermediate sum is added and then mod is taken at the end of each iteration. So in code, it's:\n\ntemp1 = choice * term1 \n\ntemp2 = (even ? choice * term2 :0)\n\ntotal = (total + temp1 + temp2) % mod \n\nso in Fortran:\n\nt1 = (choice * nchoosek(n + act -1, act+j -1)) \n\nt2 = 0 \n\nif (even) then \n\n   t2 = (choice * nchoosek( n + act-2, act +j -1 )) \n\nend if \n\ntotal = mod( total + t1 + t2, MOD )\n\nOr carefully handle each part:\n\ntemp = (choice * nchoosek(...))\ntotal = mod(total + temp, MOD )\n\nthen if even:\n\ntemp2 = (choice * nchoosek( ... 2nd term )\ntotal = mod( total + temp2, MOD )\n\nThis is probably better because it's more step-by-step.\n\nIn Java, the code is:\n\ntotal += choice * first_part;\n\nif (i is even):\n\n   total += choice * second_part;\n\ntotal %= mod; \n\nThus, the total can be negative perhaps, but in code, they just mod it again. So in the initial Java code, it's okay.\n\nTranslating this to Fortran step by step.\n\nFirst, compute first term:\n\nt1 = choice * nchoosek(n + active -1 , active + j -1)\n\ntotal = total + t1\n\nif (mod(i,2) ==0) then \n\n   t2= choice* nchoosek(n + active- 2, active +j -1) \n\n   total = total +t2 \n\nend if \n\nthen \n\ntotal = mod( total, MOD )\n\nWait but need to make sure that when adding t1 and t2, they are modded. However, the intermediate sum may be too large to compute directly.\n\nWait but nchoosek values are up to (say, 2000 choose 1000 etc.), but multiplied by choice (which can be up to 2^(pairs) mod MOD, but even that may be manageable.\n\nIn Fortran, integers can handle up to 9e18 (if using 64-bit integers, which their type is integer(8)), so the intermediate multiplication may still be okay modulo the modulus?\n\nBut in Java, the code uses 'long' which is 64 bits, which is same as integer(8) in Fortran.\n\nBut since we have to ensure that the code works as written, we need to perform the mod after each operation where it's needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute each term mod(MOD), then add them and then mod.\n\nSo to prevent overflow, perhaps do:\n\ntemp1 = MOD( choice * (nchoosek( ... )), MOD )\n\ntotal = (total + temp1) MOD MOD \n\nsimilar for the second term.\n\nBecause in the Java code, the choice is stored mod MOD (since choice is calculated as (times2 * ... mod MOD ). Therefore, choice is already modded.\n\nHence, the terms choice * nchoosek(...) can be calculated mod MOD directly.\n\nHmm, so a better approach would be replacing variable names with their modded counterparts.\n\nWait let me think again.\n\nIn Java:\n\nThe 'choice' is computed as:\n\nchoice = ( times2 * nchoosek[pairs][j] ) % mod \n\n(Thus, mod is applied, so it's within 0 to mod-1)\n\nSimilarly, when multiplied by the other terms (nchoosek[...] which also are modded (since they were computed mod mod).\n\nThus the products are up to (mod^2), which is  almost a trillion, which is within 2^40, so even a 64-bit register can hold it. But multiplying (mod^2)*n unless n is small, but the n here comes into play in the terms like nchoosek(n+active-1, ...). Since the code pre-computes nchoosek, the nchoosek entries are modulo mod, so their values are all between 0 and mod-1.\n\nTherefore, the term: (choice)* (some nchoosek[ ... ]) is at most (mod) * mod) \n\nWhich is mod^2. Then when taking mod mod, \n\nso ( (mod^2) mod mod ) is 0. Wait, no. Actually, if both terms are modded, then their product is (a*b mod mod)\n\nThus, when doing choice * nchoosek(...) it can be up to mod * (mod). Thus:\n\nchoice * nchoosek(...) can be up to (mod)^2.\n\nSo adding that to total, which is also mod mod (since total is always modded at the end of the loop step).\n\nHmm. Therefore, in fortran:\n\nif (active +j -1 <0 ), continue (in fortran, cycle the loop)\n\nThe code has an 'if (active +j -1 <0 ) continue' meaning that the current j is skipped. So in Fortran:\n\nif (active +j -1 <0 ) cycle\n\nThis continues to the next j iteration.\n\nNow, translating all of this step by step.\n\nOverall structure of the Fortran program:\n\n! Declare constants and variables.\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer, parameter :: MOD = 998244353\n\n  integer(8), dimension(0:4000,0:4000) :: nchoosek\n\n  integer :: i,j,k,n,pairs,active,var,pairs_j,pairs_i\n\n  integer(8) :: times2, total,t1,t2\n\n !

But I don't know the constraints of inputs n and k. But assuming the code was written such that this holds. Since the problem uses combinations here, perhaps the values are manageable.\n\nThe same applies to the second term (if i even) which accesses n+active -2.\n\nThus, with that in mind:\n\nIn code inside the inner loop:\n\n! Compute first term.\n\n! Check for valid indices:\n\n! first term indices:\n\nif ( (active+j-1) <0 .or. (n+active -1) < (active+j -1) ) then \n\n   ! binomial coefficient is zero \n\n   ... but perhaps the code continues to skip?\n\nWait the Java code has the first check 'if (active + j -1 <0) continue'\n\nSo if active+j-1 <0 is true, then the rest of the loop iteration is skipped. \n\nSo in Fortran, that is:\n\nif ( active+j -1 <0 ) cycle\n\nThis will skip all processing for this j and go to next j.\n\nElse:\n\nproceed.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSo the code in the j loop:\n\ndo j=0,pairs\n\n   if (active + j -1 <0 ) cycle\n\n   ...\n\nend do \n\nThus, when that condition is not met, compute the terms.\n\nSo inside the inner loop, after checking if active+j-1<0, then proceed.\n\nWe can proceed:\n\ncompute the first coefficient:\n\nfirst = nchoosek( nactive_minus_1, active_plus_j_minus_1 )\n\nwhere,\n\nnactive_minus_1 = n + active -1\n\nactive_j_minus_1 = active + j -1 \n\nsince active +j -1 might be zero or a non-negative number, but nactive_minus_1 must be >= active_j_minus_1 for the binomial coefficient to be non-zero.\n\nWait the binomial coefficient (n choose k) is zero when n <k, so in that case, the term would be zero. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfirst = nchoosek(nactive_minus_1, active_j_minus_1)\n\nif (nactive_minus_1 < active_j_minus_1) then \n\n    first =0 \n\nend if \n\nBut because the array is precomputed with the combination values, the code might have stored zero where n <k. Wait, no: in the initial code, when initializing, nchoosek[i][j] is set to (.. ), so for j up to i.\n\nWait, in the code's dynamic programming for loops:\n\nthe array is filled such that nchoosek[i][j] is combination i choose j for all 0<=j<=i.\n\nThus, for any indices (a, b) where a <b, that entry hasn't been initialized? Because the first loop set i,0 and i,i (so for j=0 and j=i, it's set to 1), and the loop between is i starts from 2 and for j from 1 to i-1.\n\nThus, if the first term call is to nchoosek(a,b), where a <b, then that entry hasn't been filled, leading to undefined value. Which could be a problem.\n\nWait, the code in Java will have initialized the first and the diagonal, but for other cells not in paths of those loops they will be zero?\n\nWait, in Java's dynamic initialization, the array is initialized to zero by default? Let me check.\n\nYes, because in Java, a newly created array of primitive types like integer initializes to zero. Thus, in Java code, the nchoosek array starts as all zeros. The first loop (i from 0) sets the first and last element of each row to 1. Then the remaining cells are filled in. So in the code, the loops fill in from the previous entries.\n\nIn cases where the requested a <b, then nchoosek[a][b] is zero (not initialized, because for the first i < b, they would have been skipped).\n\nThus, in Java, the value is zero, which is the correct C(a,b).\n\nHence, the same in Fortran, but Fortran how?\n\nIn Fortran, variables declared inside a PROGRAM or FUNCTION are initialized to 12 thirty-lines, unless the compiler has a flag. Wait in Fortran 90, variables declared but not initialized are notset (garbage). So we need to initialize the entire nchoosek to 0 first.\n\nAh, right! That's a problem. The code's nchoosek in Java is initialized all to 0, which is required.\n\nHence in the Fortran code, we must first set all elements of nchoosek to 0, then set the first and last entries in the initial loop.\n\nOtherwise, some cells might not be initialized and their values are garbage. \n\nTherefore, when declaring the array, we must initialize all elements to zero (or, do that in a loop). \n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nfirst, we initialize nchoosek to zero:\n\ndo i=0,4000\n\n   do j=0,4000\n\n      nchoosek(i,j) =0\n\n   enddo \n\nenddo \n\nBut that could be time-consuming but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, by declaring with a / to set initial values. But in all Fortran versions, perhaps a loop is better.\n\nWait the original code's Java equivalent is:\n\nstatic long[][] nchoosek;\n\nthen in main:\n\nnchoosek = new long[4001][4001]\n\nSo that creates an array set to 0 (default for long). Thus, in Fortran, the code should also initialize it to zero.\n\nTherefore, starting the code:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(0:4000,0:4000) ::nchoosek\n\ninitialization:\n\ndo i=0,4000\n\n  do j=0,4000 \n\n    nchoosek(i,j) =0\n\n  enddo \n\nenddo \n\nthen proceed with the first loops.\n\nAlternatively, might have a more efficient way. Since first loop sets all first and diagonal elements to 1, which would overwrite. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop in the code can do that.\n\nThus, the first steps are:\n\nallocate nchoosek as a 4001x4001 array of 0.\n\nthen the first loops.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to have the initialization of the array to zero first.\n\nAdding that in the beginning.\n\nSimilarly, when accessor function for binomial, like nchoosek(n+active-1, active+j-1). Since if nactive_minus_1 is < active+j-1, the portion will be zero.\n\nOkay, now proceed.\n\nThus, the code outline is:\n\nProgram\n\n  declare mod, nchoosek,\n\n  initialize the array to zero,\n\n  run the initial loops to compute combinations,\n\n  read k and n,\n\n  loop i from 2 to 2k:\n\n    compute pairs and active.\n\n    then loop j from 0 to pairs.\n\n    etc.\n\n.\n\nPutting all these together, here is a draft of the code.\n\nNow, some syntax points:\n\n- In fortran loops: DO variable = start, end, [increment]. Default increment is 1.\n\n- The mod function: that is, mod(x,y).\n\n- The assignment of matricies: nchoosek[i][j] becomes nchoosek(i,j) in Fortran.\n\nNow putting this all together.\n\nAlso, note that variables active and pairs are integer.\n\nAnother point:\n\nThe order of modulus operations.\n\nIn Java: total += ... and then mod each time. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nEach step where the total is computed should be modded as appropriate.\n\nWait, let me try to write the inner j loop code carefully.\n\n inner_j_loop:\n\n DO j =0,pairs\n\n   active_term = active + j -1\n\n   if (active_term <0 ) then \n\n      cycle\n\n   endif\n\n   !

Alternatively, more precisely:\n\ntotal = mod( total + first, MOD )\n\nif even:\n\n   total = mod( total + sec, MOD )\n\nBut also in this way accumulating properly.\n\nThus, the code for the inner j loop after checking conditions:\n\nfirst = ( choice * nchoosek(...) ) mod MOD \n\nand the second term similarly.\n\nWait, but even in the case where the second term is zero, then it doesn't contribute.\n\nThus, inside the inner loop:\n\nCompute comb1 and comb2 (if applicable):\n\nnactive_m1 =n + active -1 \n\ncomb1 = nchoosek(nactive_m1, active_term )\n\nif comb1 is zero (because nactive_m1 < active_term, then it will be already zero)\n\nthen term1 = choice * comb1 mod MOD \n\nSimilarly for comb2 if even case.\n\nThen, total is updated as :\n\ntotal = mod( total + term1 + (term2 if even else 0 ), MOD )\n\nSo in code:\n\n           term1 = mod( choice * comb1, MOD )\n\n            term2 = 0_8\n            if (i even) then \n\n                if (n + active -2 .ge.0) then \n\n                   comb2 = nchoosek( n+active-2, active_term )\n\n                   ! which will be zero if the first is too small.\n\n                else \n\n                   comb2 =0 \n\n                end if \n\n                term2_val = choice * comb2 \n\n                term2 = mod( term2_val, MOD )\n\n            end if \n\n            temp_add = term1 + term2 \n\n            total = mod( total + temp_add, MOD )\n\nAlternatively:\n\ntemp_add= term1 \n\nif ( even ) then \n\n   temp_add = temp_add + term2 \n\nend if \n\ntotal = mod( total + temp_add, MOD )\n\nThus in code:\n\n term1 = mod( choice * nchoosek(nactive_m1, active_term ), MOD )\n\n ifmod: if (mod(i,2) ==0) then \n\n    ! check if active_term can contribute (as before, nactive_m2 >=0 )\n\n    nactive_m2 =nactive_m1 -1 \n\n    if (nactive_m2 <0 ) then \n\n        comb2=0 \n\n    else \n\n        comb2= nchoosek( nactive_m2, active_term )\n\n    end if \n\n    term2_val= choice * comb2 \n\n    term2= mod( term2_val, MOD )\n\n    temp_add = term1 + term2 \n\n else \n\n    temp_add = term1 \n\n end if \n\n total = mod(total + temp_add, MOD ) \n\nSo this handles adding and mod.\n\nThus, putting this into code.\n\nAlso, the variable 'active' \n\n ACTIVE =k - 2*pairs \n\nAND if ( mod(i,2)==0 ) then \n\n   active = active -1 \n\nThus, note that active could be negative but in the code's condition check later (active+j-1 <0).\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, let's wrap up the Fortran code step by step:\n\nFirst, the PRE\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f, the first initialization loops.\n\nBut first, a full draft sketch:\n\nPROGRAM atcoder_ARC102_C\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: MOD = 998244353\n  INTEGER(8), DIMENSION(0:4000,0:4000) :: nchoosek\n  INTEGER :: i, j, k, n, pairs, active, active_term\n  INTEGER(8) :: times2, total\n\n  !

Wait, in the Java original:\n\nchoice = (times2 * nchoosek[pairs][j]) mod mod. \n\nAh yes, this is crucial! \n\nWait I missed that.

Need to recalculate.\n\nLet's retrace the code step.\n\nInside the inner j loop (after the active_term check):\n\nFirst, compute the choice variable:\n\nchoice = (times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j)) mod MOD \n\nYes.\n\nWait this is the first step inside j's loop:\n\n! need to compute choice.\n\nchoice = mod( times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j), MOD )\n\nThen, before doing anything else!\n\nOnly after that, compute the terms:\n\nThe terms are choice * [ binomial coefficients ].\n\nThus, the code should have:\n\nDO j=0,pairs \n\n    active_term =active +j-1 \n\n    if ( ... ) cycle \n\n    else \n\n      ! compute choice first\n\n      choice = mod( times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j), MOD )\n\n      term1 = choice * comb1 \n\n      ect. \n\n    also, after computing choice, then compute term1 and term2 \n\n    then accumulate on total. \n\n    !\u6700\u540e, update times2: \n\n    times2 = mod( times2 *2, MOD ) \n\n    before proceeding to next iteration ?\n\n    Wait in the Java code, after calculating choice, times2 is updated for the next step.\n\n     For example:\n\ntimes2 is 1 initially.\n\nfor each j:\n\n choice = (times2 * ... )\n\n then times2 *=2 \n\n thus next iteration j+1 will use the new times2 \n\nSo in the code order:\n\n inside j's loop:\n\n compute choice ( using current times2)\n\n compute terms contributing to total.\n\n add the terms to total \n\n THEN update times2 by doubling mod MOD \n\n thus:\n\nThus the following sequence:\n\ninside j loop (after calculating active_term):\n\n  ! compute choice \n\n  choice_val = times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j)\n\n  choice = mod( choice_val, MOD )\n\n  ! then compute terms\n\n  compute comb1 and comb2 ( the binomial coeffs )\n\n  term1= choice * comb1 \n\n  etc \n\n  ! add to total \n\n  ! update total \n\n  total = mod( .. )\n\n  ! only now\uff0ctimes2 is updated for the next iteration \n\nSo in code:\n\nafter computing contribution to total, then:\n\n ! compute new times2\n\n new_times2 = MOD( times2 * 2, MOD )\n\n times2 = new_times2 \n\n \n\nThus, in the code structure:\n\n DO j =0,pairs \n\n   ... \n\n    compute choice \n\n    compute terms \n\n    update total \n\n    update times2 \n\n \n\nThis is critical to reproducing correct times2.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nIn the inner j loop:\n\n         ! compute choice \n\n         choice = mod( times2 * nchoosek(pairs,j), MOD )\n\n         ! compute first combination \n\n         n_active_minus_1 = n + active -1 \n\n         active_term = active +j -1 \n\n         IF (n_active_minus_1 < active_term) then \n\n            term1 =0 \n\n         else \n\n             comb1 = nchoosek(n_active_minus_1, active_term )\n\n             term1 = choice * comb1 mod MOD \n\n         end if \n\n     \u5e76 so on \n\nWait but I need to compute term1 properly, ensuring it is mod mod \n\n term1 = mod( choice * comb1, MOD )\n\n\u540c\u7406:\n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c the times2 is updated after using the current times2.\n\nThus, correct code would be:\n\nDO j =0,pairs \n\n  if (active +j-1 <0 ) then \n\n    CYCLE \n\n  endif \n\n  ! compute choice \n\n  comb_j = nchoosek(pairs, j) \n\n  term_choice = times2 * comb_j \n\n  choice_val = mod(term_choice, MOD )\n\n  ! now compute terms \n\n  ! compute first term:\n\n  ... \n\n  ! compute terms using choice_val \n\n ... \n\n  ! accumulate into total \n\n  total = mod( total + (term1 + ... ), MOD )\n\n  !
