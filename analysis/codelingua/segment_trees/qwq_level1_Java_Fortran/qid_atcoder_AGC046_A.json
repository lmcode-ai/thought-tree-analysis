So 360. Count becomes 3. At the start of the next iteration, check: current_angle (360) ==360 \u2192 condition is false, exit loop. Hence, returns count 3.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe main class is called atcoder_AGC046_A, and the main method reads an integer x from input. Then it initializes a count to 0 and a temporary variable tmp with the value of x. Then x is set to 0. The loop starts where while x is not equal to 360, it adds tmp to x. If x exceeds 360, it subtracts 360 to wrap around. Each iteration increments the count. Finally, it prints the count.\n\nWait, but the initial x becomes 0, and then we add tmp (original x) each time, wrapping around. The loop continues until x equals 360. Hmm, but adding tmp each time... Let's think. Let me see.\n\nWait, the code's steps are:\n\n- Read x (input)\n- Then, count starts at 0, tmp is x, then x is set to zero?\nWait, the original code: \n\ntmp = x;\nx = 0;\n\nSo the original x (the input) is stored in tmp. The actual variable x starts at zero, and in each iteration, it adds tmp. But since x starts at 0 and then after first step becomes tmp, but if that's over 360, subtract 360. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the loop steps. Let me code walkthrough:\n\nInitial x (input) is stored as tmp. But then x is set to 0. Then, in the loop:\n\n- x = x + tmp. Let's say the initial x is 0, so first addition gives tmp, then check if it's over 360, then mod it if needed, but the loop continues until x equals 360. \n\nWait, but how does the loop exit? Let me consider an example. Suppose tmp is 180.\n\nInitial x is 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nx = 0 + 180 = 180. Since that's <= 360, no subtraction. So x is 180, count becomes 1. Continue.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nx becomes 180 + 180= 360. Which is equal to 360, so after check, since x is now 360? Wait, after adding, they check if x is over 360. \n\nWait the code does:\n\nx += tmp\n\nthen: if x > 360 then subtract 360.\n\nThen check if x == 360, if not, loop again.\n\nWait in this example, when x becomes 360: after adding gives x= 360. The x is not >360, so the subtraction isn't done. Thus, the loop check after that: x is 360. So loop halts. The count is 2 in this case.\n\nAnother example: let's say tmp is 150. \n\nStarting at x=0.\n\nIteration1:\n\n0+150 \u2192150 \u2192count=1.\n\nLoop continues since 150\u2260360\n\nIteration2:\n\n150+150=300 \u2192count=2. Still not 360.\n\nIteration3:\n\n300+150=450 \u2192450-360=90. Now x is 90, count3.\n\nIteration4:90+150=240 \u2192 count4.\n\nIteration5:240+150=390\u2192390-360=30 \u2192 count5.\n\nWait this seems like maybe it's always looking for when (current_x + tmp) modulo 360 equals 360?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the smallest count where (count * tmp) mod 360 ==0.\n\nBecause 360 is a full circle, so when the total steps (multiplied by tmp) mod 360 gives zero, then x would be 360 mod 360 is zero, so maybe there's a mistake in the code?\n\nWait wait a second, let's see the original code:\n\nLoop continues while x is not equal to 360.\n\nWait when the x equals 360, the loop stops. So after each step, the x is updated as (x+tmp) mod 360?\n\nWait no. Because the code adds tmp to x each time, and if it exceeds 360 subtract 360. So the net effect is x mod 360. So x is always kept in 0-360. The loop ends when x == 360?\n\nWait hold on, the code can only set x to 360 in the case where x + tmp is exactly 360, but then no subtraction. Or perhaps when after adding tmp to current x and getting x equal to 360. So the loop condition is x !=360, so when x is 360, it stops. So the loop stops when x is exactly 360. But since the modulo operation would reset it every time, except when it exactly hits 360.\n\nHence the code is trying to find the minimal count where (count * tmp) mod 360 is zero. Because count multiplied by tmp would have to reach exactly 360 or a multiple, so mod360 would be zero, but the code requires x is exactly 360. Wait no. Wait, for example, if tmp is 90. Then count=4: 4*90= 360, so x would be 360 \u2192 loop stops, count is 4.\n\nYes, so indeed, the problem wants the minimal count where count * tmp is a multiple of 360. But because the code is checking for x being exactly 360, and when adding the current x (0) plus the next tmp each time.\n\nHmm, okay. The code seems to correctly find the minimal count where the total is a multiple of 360. \n\nNow, translating to Fortran.\n\nFirst, the input: the Java uses a custom FastReader class for reading. Since Fortran can read input directly via read(*,*) or using some more complex methods, perhaps using the intrinsic input with integer variables.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nThe program will:\n\n- Read an integer x from input.\n\n- Store that x in tmp (a temporary variable).\n\n- Initialize x (maybe a new variable?) to zero?\n\nWait in Fortran, variables start from scratch. In Java, the code overwrites x with 0 after storing in tmp. So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nRead the original x into tmp (an integer variable).\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nInitialize current_x to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, variables will be named differently to avoid confusion. Let me restructure the variables:\n\nLet me call the read integer as x_input. Then tmp would be x_input. The current angle is stored in a variable say 'current_angle', starting at 0.\n\nLoop while current_angle is not equal to 360:\n\n    add tmp to current_angle.\n\n    if current_angle exceeds 360, subtract 360 (so effectively current_angle mod 360, but with 360 kept as is? No, because mod 360 would give 0 for 360, but in the code, when current becomes exactly 360, we need to exit. So perhaps:\n\nWait the way to compute it:\n\ncurrent_angle = current_angle + tmp\n\nif current_angle >360: then subtract 360?\n\nSo for example, if adding gives 360 exactly, current_angle remains 360, so loop stops?\n\nWait, correct.\n\nSo yes. The logic here is:\n\ncurrent_angle starts at 0\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent_angle += tmp\n\nif current_angle >360 \u2192 current_angle -= 360 (i.e., current_angle mod 360)\n\nWait no, that's not exactly correct. Because, for example, if current_angle is 300, and tmp is 150, adding gives 450. subtract 360 gives 90. However, the modulo here would be 450 mod360 is 90. So that's equivalent to mod. \n\nBut when current_angle adding to tmp is exactly 360 \u2192 which would set it to be 360 \u2192 loop will terminate.\n\nThus, the final condition is current_angle==360 \u2192 exit loop. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran code:\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Read input x (integer), stored in tmp.\n\n2. Set current_angle =0, count =0.\n\n3. Loop while current_angle \u2260 360:\n\n   current_angle = current_angle + tmp\n\n   if current_angle >360 \u2192 current_angle = current_angle -360\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   (Wait but the increment is before or after?)\n\nYes: increment count each time the loop runs. Because the loop is done until current_angle reaches 360. \n\nSo let's see the steps:\n\nStart with current_angle =0.\n\nEach iteration:\n\nAdd tmp to current_angle, then subtract 360 if too big. \n\nBut the steps:\n\ninside the loop:\n\ncurrent_angle = current_angle + tmp\n\nif (current_angle >360) then \n\n   current_angle = current_angle - 360\n\nend if\n\ncount = count +1 ?\n\nWait no, no. Wait, the code does:\n\nIn Java's code:\n\nx = x + tmp;\n\nif (x>360) x= x-360;\n\ncount++;\n\nBut the count is incremented each loop iteration.\n\nWait the loop is while (x not 360). So the count is incremented, so the first time is before checking the condition?\n\nWait in the code:\n\nThe loop is while (x !=360) { ... the next steps. Wait no, the loop is:\n\nEach time, the check is first, then do the steps. So the steps for each iteration (including the calculation) happens until x becomes 360.\n\nWait the loop structure:\n\nwhile (x !=360) {\n\n   x += tmp;\n\n   if x>360, subtract 360.\n\n   count++;\n\n}\n\nWait no, in the Java code, the code increments count each time inside the loop.\n\nWait let me check the exact code again.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nx = sc.nextInt();\n\nint count = 0;\n\nint tmp = x;\n\nx=0;\n\nthen loop:\n\nwhile (x != 360) {\n\n   x += tmp;\n\n    if (x >360 ) ... \n\n    count++;\n\n}\n\nWait no, the code inside the loop is:\n\nExecute the loop as long as x != 360. So each step:\n\nDuring loop:\n\nx += tmp \n\nthen check over and adjust, then count is incremented each loop iteration. \n\nWait no, looking at the code:\n\nInside the loop block:\n\nx = x + tmp;\n\nif (x>360) \u2192 subtract 360.\n\ncount++;\n\nSo the count is incremented each time through the loop.\n\nWait, the statements inside the loop are:\n\nx = x + tmp;\n\nif ... \n\ncount++;\n\nWait so the count is incremented after doing the adding. Wait the increment occurs in the loop in Java.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nEach iteration:\n\nAdd tmp to x,\n\nthen subtract 360 if needed,\n\nthen increment count.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the Java code's exact syntax:\n\nIn the loop body:\n\n    x = x + tmp;\n\n    if (x > 360) {\n        x = x - 360;\n    }\n    count++;\n\nSo after adding and adjusting, increment count.\n\nThe loop condition is checked first, then inside the loop body:\n\neach iteration does the adding, the adjustment, then increments count.\n\nWait yes. The loop continues until the condition is met before rechecking.\n\nWait here's an example. Let's say tmp= 180.\n\nInitial x=0, so loop runs.\n\nInside loop:\n\nx += 180 \u2192 x=180.\n\nNo, since 180 isn't over 360.\n\nIncrement count \u2192 count becomes 1.\n\nThen, loop will check again if x (now 180) !=360 \u2192 yes.\n\nNext loop iteration:\n\nx =180 +180 \u2192 360. Do not subtract.\n\ncount increments to 2 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nAt the end of the second iteration, the count is 2.\n\nNow, after that, the loop checks the condition again: x == 360 \u2192 yes, so loop exits.\n\nHence, the final count is correct.\n\nSo in code structure, the loop logic is important.\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be: use a do loop with a condition.\n\nPerhaps using a do while construct.\n\nFortran has do while loops.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead input (tmp):\n\nread*, tmp\n\nset current_angle =0\n\ncount=0\n\nloop: do\n\n   current_angle = current_angle + tmp\n\n   if current_angle>360 then \n\n       current_angle = current_angle - 360\n\n   end if \n\n   count = count +1 \n\n   if (current_angle ==360) exit loop  \n\nend do loop\n\nprint*, count \n\nWait but wait, the loop continues until current_angle is 360. So after doing the computation (adding and mod), we check if current_angle is 360 \u2192 if so, exit. \n\nAlternatively, the loop should execute until current_angle is not equal to 360. Wait the original code continues looping while x !=360.\n\nWait in the original code, the loop condition is checked at the top before running the loop. So in Java:\n\nwhile (x !=360) {\n\n   ... do things, including count++\n\n}\n\nSo in fortran, it would be:\n\ndo while (current_angle /= 360)\n\n   ... compute steps \n\n   count = count +1 \n\nend do \n\nWait let me structure it correctly.\n\nWait, in fortran:\n\ncurrent_angle =0 \n\ncount =0 \n\ndo while (current_angle /= 360)\n\n    current = current_angle + tmp \n\n    if (current >360) current = current -360 \n\n    current_angle = current \n\n    count = count +1 \n\nend do \n\nprint*, count \n\nWait yes, that would work.\n\nBecause, the loop continues while current_angle is not 360. So the steps:\n\nAt the start of each loop iteration, check current_angle (before the code), so if the current_angle is 360 the loop exits.\n\nWait no, the check is on the loop condition at the start.\n\nWait, in Fortran DO WHILE loops are structured as:\n\ndo while (condition)\n\n   statements\n\nend do\n\nThe loop will run the condition first. If condition is true, it proceeds, else exits.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ncurrent_angle =0 \n\ncount =0 \n\ndo while (current_angle /=360)\n\n    ! Need to compute the next step.\n\n    current_angle = current_angle + tmp \n\n    if (current_angle>360) then \n\n        current_angle = current_angle -360 \n\n    end if \n\n    count = count +1 \n\nend do \n\nWait but this has an issue. After the loop, when current_angle reaches 360, which would happen after performing the addition and adjustment. Let me see:\n\nLet me walk through the example with tmp=180.\n\nInitial current_angle is 0. \n\nEnter loop since 0 !=360:\n\nAdd 180 \u2192180. Not over 360 \u2192 current_angle 180. count becomes 1.\n\nLoop repeats: current_angle (180) is not 360 \u2192 do again:\n\nAdd 180 \u2192 360. Not over, so stays at 360. Count 2. \n\nThen, the loop condition is checked again before next iteration. The next loop's condition: current_angle is 360 now, so the loop terminates. So the count is 2, correct.\n\nAnother example: tmp=240? Let's see.\n\nLet me pick tmp = 240:\n\nInitial current_angle is 0.\n\nLoop 1: \n\n0+240=240 <360 \u2192 current_angle=240. count 1.\n\nLoop 2:\n\n240+240=480 \u2192 subtract 360 \u2192 120. count becomes 2.\n\nLoop3:\n\n120+240=360 \u2192 current remains 360. \n\nNow the loop condition is checked again. \n\nBefore doing anything, the current_angle is 360 \u2192 the loop doesn't execute again. \n\nThus count is 3? \n\nWait.\n\nWait after the second iteration, the current is now 120 (after loop2). \n\nThen loop3: \n\ncurrent_angle is 120, so enters loop again. \n\nAdds 240 \u2192 360 \u2192 no subtract. \n\nSo 360. Count becomes 3. \n\nAt the start of the next iteration, check: current_angle (360) ==360 \u2192 condition is false, exit loop. \n\nHence, returns count 3. Let's see what 240*3 =720 \u2192 720 mod360 is 0 \u2192 yes, which is correct. Because count*240 mod360 is 720 mod360 = 0 \u2192 hence the correct result is 3. \n\nSo the code would produce 3, which is correct. \n\nAnother case: tmp=150\n\nSo, the example I thought before:\n\ntmp=150. Then count?\n\nLet me calculate step by step.\n\nInitial current_angle 0:\n\nLoop 1: 0+150=150 \u2192 count 1.\n\nLoop 2: 150+150=300 \u2192 count 2.\n\nLoop3: 300 +150 =450 \u2192450-360=90 \u2192 count3.\n\nLoop4:90+150=240 \u2192 count4.\n\nLoop5:240+150 \u2192390-360=30 \u2192 count5.\n\nLoop6:30+150=180 \u2192 count6.\n\nLoop7:180+150=330 \u2192 count7.\n\nLoop8:330+150=480\u2192480-360=120 \u2192 count8.\n\nLoop9: 120 +150=270 \u2192 count9.\n\nLoop10:270+150=420\u2192420-360=60\u2192 count10.\n\nLoop11:60+150=210\u219211.\n\nLoop12: 210+150=360 \u2192count12+1 \u2192count 12? \n\nWait, let's track step by step:\n\nAfter first iteration (count1): current_angle=150.\n\n2nd: 300 \u2192 count2.\n\nThird: 450-360=90 \u2192 count3.\n\nFourth: 240\u2192count4.\n\nFifth: 240+150=390 \u219230 \u2192 count5.\n\n6th step adding 150: 30+150=180 \u2192 count6.\n\n7th \u2192180+150=330 \u2192 count7.\n\n8th :330+150=480 \u2192480-360=120. \u2192count8.\n\n9th: 120 +150=270 \u2192 count9.\n\n10th \u2192270+150=420 \u219260 \u2192 count10.\n\n11th \u219260+150=210 \u2192count11.\n\n12th step \u2192210+150=360 \u2192 now, after adding and adjusting, current_angle is 360.\n\nThen the count increments to 12? Wait Let's see.\n\nLet me detail steps:\n\ncurrent_angle starts at 0. count is 0.\n\nNow:\n\nFirst iteration (since current_angle != 360):\n\nYes: enter loop.\n\ncurrent_angle becomes 0+150 = 150, no adjustment.\n\ncount becomes 1.\n\nThen check the loop condition again?\n\nWait after the block, the loop goes back to the condition check.\n\nWait in the code structure: \n\ndo while (current_angle is not 360).\n\neach time, after the code is executed, it checks again.\n\nWait, no. Wait the do while in Fortran:\n\nThe loop is 'do while' \u2192 check before the loop starts each time.\n\nWait actually, in FORTRAN, the DO WHILE loop's condition is evaluated at the top of the loop. So the flow is:\n\nif (condition) [execute statements], then loop back and check condition again.\n\nSo in the case:\n\ncurrent_angle is 0.\n\nFirst, check condition (0 !=360 \u2192 true \u2192 enter loop).\n\nThen perform the code:\n\ncurrent_angle = current_angle + tmp \u21920+150 =150. \n\nThen if \u2192 no subtraction.\n\nSet current_angle = 150. \n\ncount is 0 \u2192 becomes 1 (count = count +1 \u2192 1).\n\nThen loop back \u2192 check condition (150 !=360 \u2192 true \u2192 loop again.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ncurrent_angle \u2192 150 \u2192 add 150 \u2192300, count becomes 2.\n\nThird iteration: 300 \u2192 +150 =450.\n\n450>360 \u2192 subtract 360 \u2192 90. count 3.\n\nFourth iteration: 90 \u2192 +150 \u2192 240 \u2192 count4. \n\nFifth:240\u2192400- wait no. 240+150=390. 390-360=30 \u2192 count5. \n\n6th:30 \u219230+150= 180 \u2192 count6.\n\n7th:180 \u2192 +150 \u2192 330 \u2192 count7.\n\n8th:330 \u2192 +150 \u2192 480\u2192 subtract \u2192120 \u2192 count8.\n\n9th: 120 \u2192270 \u2192 count9.\n\n10th: 270 \u2192420 \u219260 \u2192 count10.\n\n11th: 60 \u2192210 \u2192 count11.\n\n12th step: current_angle was 210. 210+150=360.\n\nNo subtraction, so current_angle becomes 360.\n\ncount becomes 12.\n\nNow exit the loop condition check (current_angle is 360 \u2192 condition false \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThe print is 12. \n\nBut what's the minimal count where 150 * count is divisible by 360?\n\n150 * count mod360 ==0?\n\nWe can compute GCD(150,360). GCD(150, 360). \n\n150 factors: 2*3*5\u00b2.\n\n360 is 2\u00b3*3\u00b2*5. \n\nSo GCD is 2 * 3 *5 \u219230 \u2192 LCM(150, 360) = (150*360)/(30) \u2192 LCM= 150*12= 1800?\n\nWait LCM (150, 360) is (150 * 360)/GCD(150, 360)) \u2192 (150 \u00d7 360)/30 \u2192 150 \u00d712 \u2192 1800.\n\nSo desired equation is count *150 = 1800 \u2192 count= 12 \u2192 exactly. So that works. \n\nSo the code in Fortran should produce the correct count.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\n- Read tmp from input.\n\n- Initialize variables.\n\n- loop while current_angle is not 360, update the angle and count as before.\n\nNow, for handling the input: in Java, they read via FastReader, but in Fortran simply, the input can be read via read(*,*) tmp.\n\nHowever, in some fortran versions (depending on the compiler), standard input may need to be treated differently, but generally read(*,*) should work.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, integers are 4 bytes usually, but for 360, no problem.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nprogram main \n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger :: tmp, current_angle, count \n\ncurrent_angle =0 \n\ncount =0 \n\nread*, tmp \n\ndo while (current_angle /= 360) \n\n    current_angle = current_angle + tmp \n\n    if (current_angle >360 ) then \n\n        current_angle = current_angle -360 \n\n    end if \n\n    count = count +1 \n\nend do \n\nprint*, count \n\nend program main \n\nWait that's the code. Let me test some cases.\n\nTest case1: input 180\u2192 output 2 \u2192 yes, works.\n\nTest case 2: tmp=240 \u2192 input 240 \u2192 output 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test: 3 \u2192 what?\n\nLet's compute with tmp=3:\n\nWait 3*120=360. So count should be 120.\n\nWait in the code, let's see:\n\ncurrent_angle is 0.\n\nAfter each iteration:\n\ncurrent_angle starts at 0, then increments by3.\n\nLoop runs until adding to get to 360.\n\nBecause 360 mod3 is 0, so the current_angle after adding 3's will go to 360 after 120 steps. \n\nLet me say after 359 steps:\n\ncurrent_angle would be 359*3? Wait Hmm you have to think that way.\n\nAlternatively, each iteration:\n\nAt step 399 steps: count is 119? current angle is 3*119 = 357 \u2192 current_angle=357.\n\nThen step 120:\n\n357+3 = 360 \u2192 yes, so then current_angle is 360, set count to 120, and exit loop. \n\nSo the code will output 120, which is correct.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- In Fortran, the syntax for DO and indentations aren't required, but the code must have proper continuation.\n\nIn the code above, the code lines for loops are correctly written.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is as written."
