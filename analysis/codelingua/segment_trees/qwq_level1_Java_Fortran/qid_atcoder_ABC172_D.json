    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java code's main method takes an integer n from standard input. Then, it calculates an answer using a loop from 1 to n. The formula in the loop adds to the answer the value of i multiplied by some terms. Let me parse that formula.\n\nThe key part inside the loop is ans += (long)i * ((long)n/(long)i) * (( (long)n/(long)i ) +1 ) /2. Breaking that down, (n/i) is the integer division result. Let's call that q. Then the term is q*(q+1)/2, multiplied by i. Wait, right, so it's i * q * (q +1)/2. The loop sums that over all i from 1 to n.\n\nThe goal is to translate this logic into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the structure of a Fortran program. We need a program block, maybe a module or just a main program. Since Java has a class and a main method, but in Fortran, typically we can write a program and a main-like block.\n\nLet me think about variables. The Java code uses a Scanner for input. In Fortran, input is done via READ(*,*) or similar. So first, the code will read an integer n from the user.\n\nThen, the loop. The variable ans is a long, which would be INTEGER*8 in Fortran (or SELECTED_INT_KIND(8)), but maybe better to use integer(8) for clarity. \n\nWait, Fortran's integer division: in Java when you divide integers with / it truncates towards zero. In Fortran, similar behavior. The expression (n/i) in integer division will be the same, I think. \n\nSo translating the formula: \n\nAt each iteration i, the loop adds:\n\ni * (n div i) * ( (n div i) + 1 ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, the division is integer so n divided by i. Let me write that as q = n / i in integer division. Then the term is i * q * (q+1)/2. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize ans as 0. Then loop i from 1 to N inclusive, then accumulate ans += i * q*(q+1)/2 where q = n/i.\n\nIn Fortran syntax:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC172_D\n   implicit none\n   integer(8) :: n, ans, i, q\n   read(*,*) n\n   ans = 0\n   do i = 1, n\n       q = n / i\n       ans = ans + i * q * (q +1) / 2\n   end do\n   print *, ans\nend program atcoder_ABC172_D\n\nWait, but let's check the data types. Since n can be up to, probably, something that would make the product and sum overflow if using integers of insufficient size. The original Java code uses long which is 64 bits, so in Fortran we need integers with 8 bytes (64 bits). So using integer(8) is appropriate for all the variables except n? Wait, n is given. Let's see: in the input, Java uses int, which is 32 bits. But in Fortran, I can read n as an integer(4), but since in calculations it may multiply with other terms, it's safer to have it as integer(8) too. Alternatively, just make them all integer(8). Let me see the formula:\n\nThe maximum value of n could be, considering the problem this code is for (AtCoder ABC172 D, which I don't know the exact constraints of, but competition problems often have n up to 1e12 or similar). Let's say n can be up to 1e12. Then (n / i) can be up to n. So for an n of 1e12, the terms can get very big. The term q*(q+1)/2 when q is ~1e12 would be ~5e24, and multiplying by i (up to 1e12) gives 5e36, which requires a 64-bit integer? Not exactly because 64 bit integer can hold up to ~9e18. Wait here's a problem: the terms could get too big for Fortran integer(8), which is 64 bits. Wait, in the code, perhaps n is up to 1e11, making the total ans value (after the sum) up to O(n^3), which could be way more than 2^63. Wait n^3 if n is 1e12 would be 1e36, which is way larger than a 64-bit integer's max of ~9e18.\n\nOh, wait that's an issue. The Java code uses long (64 bits) which also has a max of ~9e18. Which implies that the problem's constraints must be such that the answer can fit in a 64-bit integer. So the Fortran code must also use integers that can handle that.\n\nWait but maybe in the problem's constraints n is up to something like 1e6, so that the values are manageable. Anyway, the code as per translation would use the same data types as the original. The original uses long for ans and the variables involved in calculations. Hence the Fortran code should use integer(8) (which is 64 bits) for all variables involved in calculations.\n\nSo variables n must be integer(8) because in the calculation n/i, if n is 1e12, and i is small, like 1, then n/i can be very big, but FORTRAN's integer division is okay. However, the types must be sufficient to hold the variables.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code:\n\nAll variables involved calculation: n, ans, i, q should be declared as integer(8)\n\nWait in the loop, the i variable comes up through 1 to n, which is an integer(8). So in the do loop's index, when n is up to 1e12, would that be a problem?\n\nIn Fortran, the loop variable can be of any integer type, but by default, maybe the loop variable is integer. So perhaps in the loop, the index i is by default an integer(4), which might be a problem for large n.\n\nWait the original problem might have n up to say 1e12, so the loop must handle up to that. So in Fortran, the loop variable's upper limit has to be an integer that can take up that value.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nWe need i to be of type integer(8), as well. Wait but in the loop, the 'do i=1,n', the variables have to be integers, but depending on the declaration of n, which is integer(8), so perhaps Fortran would upcast it. Wait, but in Fortran, loops can use the variable type. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, we can declare i as integer(8).\n\nYes, better to explicitly declare all variables as integer(8).\n\nSo the variables n, ans, i, q are all integer(8).\n\nThus, code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc172d\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: n, ans, i, q\n  read(*,*) n\n  ans = 0\n  do i = 1, n\n    q = n / i\n    ans = ans + i * q * ( q + 1 ) / 2\n  end do\n  print*, ans\nend program atcoder_abc172d\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the division between two integers (using /) automatically performs integer division, discarding the fractional part. So yes, that's the same as the Java code's (long)n / (long)i.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, checking possible issues:\n\n- The loop from 1 to n inclusive. The original Java loops from 1 to n (since the loop is for (int i=1; i< n+1; i++)), which counts up to including n. The Fortran do i =1,n does the same.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the loop is i from 1 to N, and n can be up to very large, but in Fortran, the loop variable's capacity must be sufficient.\n\nAnother possible point: the variable ans starts at 0 (initialized correctly in Fortran).\n\nThe multiplication is done as per the Java code. The division in the formula is okay.\n\nWait the arithmetic operators have precedence: q is calculated correctly. So yes, the expression is correct.\n\nWait the term 'q*(q+1)/2: Let's see in Fortran, the order of operations is * and / as same precedence, so left to right. But parentheses will help. The current expression is written as:\n\ni * q * (q+1)/2 \n\nWhich would be ( (i * q) * (q +1) ) / 2 ?\n\nYes, since multiplication is left-associative. So that's ((i*q) * (q+1)) / 2. Which is same as the original Java code, which has (long) n / (long)i ... which is also correct. \n\nIs there a possible integer division issue here? For example, if the product is not divisible by 2? The same as in Java. The original code truncates division (same in Fortran), but the formula requires the sum of numbers from 1 to q is q(q+1)/2. Since that's an integer, the division by 2 must be exact, so no problem.\n\nHence, the code should translate correctly.\n\nTesting sample input:\n\nSuppose n is 1.\n\nJava code would loop for i=1.\n\nThen q=1/1 =1. The term is 1 *1*(1+1)/2 =1* 2/2 =1. Sum is 1. So ans prints 1.\n\nFortran code should do the same.\n\nAnother test case, n=2.\n\nLoop i=1:\n\nq=2/1=2. term = 1 *2*(3)/2 = 1*3=3.\n\ni=2:\n\nq=1: 2/2=1. term = 2 *1*2/2 =2*1=2. Total ans 3+2=5.\n\nSo output 5.\n\nTesting with Fortran code:\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAnother check.\n\nLooks like the code should be okay."
