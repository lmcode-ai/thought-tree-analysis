    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n, then n pairs of integers, stores them in sorted ArrayLists ai and bi. Then it calculates the median or something similar based on whether n is even or odd, and outputs the difference between the two medians plus one. \n\nSo the main steps are: read input, sort the arrays, compute medians, calculate difference. \n\nNow, to think about Fortran. I know Fortran uses arrays, so instead of ArrayLists, we'll need to declare arrays of size n. The input handling might be a bit different. Also, Fortran has different methods for sorting arrays. Plus, the way medians are calculated, depending on whether n is even or odd. \n\nFirst, variable declarations. In the Java code, num is 998244353 but it's not used. Wait, looking back. Oh, the value of num isn't used in the code. So maybe it's just part of the code but not needed here. Probably the user just included the code as is, but that variable is unused. So I can ignore that in the Fortran translation. \n\nThe input comes from standard input. In Fortran, reading from stdin can be done directly via read(*,*). Since we need to read n first, then n lines each with two integers. \n\nSo first, read n. Then read two arrays of size n. \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based or 0-based? Hmm, by default, Fortran arrays start at 1. But Java uses 0-based like ArrayLists in the code. \n\nSo when sorting and getting the medians, need to adjust indices. \n\nLet me outline steps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n pairs of integers into arrays ai and bi (both of size n).\n3. Sort both arrays. \n4. Determine if n is even or odd.\n5. Calculate the medians, then the difference, then print (result + 1). \n\nIn Java, for the odd case, the medians are the middle elements (ai.size / 2, etc.), but in Fortran arrays starting at 1, the position would be (n+1)/2. Let me see:\n\nWait, for sorted list with n elements:\n\nIn Java, if n is 5 (odd), the middle is at 2 (since indexes 0-4?), so 4/2=2. Wait, no, in the Java code, for a list of elements sorted in ai, the index is (ai.size() /2) when n is odd. Since the list is zero-based, the middle element is at (size-1)/2? Wait, maybe I have to think in terms of zero-based vs one-based arrays. \n\nWait, in the Java code, when n is 5, the ArrayList's size() is 5. So size/2 would be 2.5, but since it's an integer division, it's 2, so the element at 2 (third element, since starting from 0) is the median. Which is correct for 1-based it would be (n+1)/2. So for n=5, (5+1)/2=3, but Java uses 0-based, so (n)/2 would be 5/2=2 (integer division). So the indices in Fortran would need to be adjusted. \n\nWait in the code for Java, when n is even, say 4 elements. The median positions would be 1 and 2 when indexes are zero-based. But with n even, the code uses ai.size()/2 (which for 4 would be 2) and ai.size()/2 -1 (1). \n\nYes, for even n, median is average of the two middle numbers. But in the code, when n is even, the Java code computes b as average of (elements at positions (n/2) and (n/2 -1)) for ai, same for bi, then computes c - b, multiplies by 2 and adds 1. \n\nWait, code:\n\nWhen n even:\n\ndouble b = (ai.get(n/2) + ai.get(n/2 -1))/2 ... Wait no. Wait the ai was sorted, so the indices are for the array list. The code uses ai.size (which is n), so the two middle elements are at (n/2 -1) and n/2, which is for zero-based indices. Because for n even, the first median element is at (n-1)/2, the second at (n)/2 (since 0-based). \n\nWait, for n=4, n/2=2, so elements at 1 and 2 (zero-based) would be the middle elements. So for array indexes of 0-based, yes. \n\nSo in Fortran, arrays are 1-based, so for n elements, the middle for even n would be elements at positions n/2 and n/2+1. Wait let's think: \n\nExample, n=4: elements 1,2,3,4. The two middle are at 2 and 3. So positions n/2 (2) and n/2 +1 (3). \n\nSo in the code in Fortran, for even n, the two mediates (mid indices) would be (n/2 and n/2+1). Wait, no, in the Java code's case when n is even, they take the (n/2)th and (n/2-1)th elements? Because in zero-based:\n\nWait if n is 4 elements, indexes 0,1,2,3. The two middle are at indexes 1 and 2. Those are n/2 -1 (2-1=1?) Wait n=4 divided by 2 is 2, so ai.get(2) is the third element (index 2) and ai.get(1) (2-1=1) would be the second. So that's the two middle elements when n is even. \n\nAh, so for the Fortran code, since arrays start at 1, for n=4, elements 1, 2, 3,4. The two middle are 2 and 3. So indexes n/2 = 2 and n/2 = 2 +1? Wait 4/2 =2, so indexes 2 and 3? Wait yes. So the first is (n/2), second (n/2 +1). \n\nTherefore, in Java, in the even case for the array:\n\npositions (n/2 -1) and (n/2) in 0-based correspond to (n/2) and (n/2 +1) in 1-based. So when translating, we need to adjust the index from Java's 0-based to Fortran's 1-based.\n\nSo, the steps for Fortran code:\n\nFirst, read n. Declare two integer arrays of size n. \n\nRead each line into those arrays. \n\nSort them. \n\nFind the median(s). \n\nCompute the result. \n\nNow, the code for the two cases (odd or even n). \n\nFirst, how to sort the arrays in Fortran. \n\nIn Fortran, you can use the MERGE_SORT intrinsic? Or use a library. Alternatively, write a bubble sort, but maybe use a built-in sort function. \n\nAlternatively, in modern Fortran, you can use the built-in sort function. \n\nThe code can be written as:\n\ncall mergesort(ai, 1, n)\n\nBut I need to check if Fortran has a sort function that can be called directly. Actually, Fortran does not have a built-in sort function in the standard library, unless using a specific compiler's extensions. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the ISO Fortran environment comments? Hmm, maybe better to use the swap and implement a quicksort or some other sort.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written using the Mergesort function? But to keep things simple, perhaps we can use the Fortran sort intrinsic, which is available via some methods. Alternatively, use a sort like:\n\nUse the ISO_C_BINDING? Not sure if the user expects that.\n\nAlternatively, write a simple sorting function. Since the code needs to sort the arrays. Let me think: For the purpose of coding translation, perhaps use a bubble sort? Though that's not efficient, but in this case, the code is for programming contest, and the data sets could be up to N = 3*1e5 (like in programming contests?), but maybe not. Wait the problem is from AtCoder ABC169 E. Let me check the problem constraints. Wait I don't have that, but given the code reads n pairs, perhaps n is up to 2e5 or something. So bubble sort is not efficient. \n\nAlternatively, better to use a sort function that's available. \n\nAlternatively use a module that provides sorting. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the F90/95 status and rely on the compiler's sort functions. Maybe in some versions of Fortran, one can use \"call sort\" but I think it's compiler-dependent. \n\nWait, looking up:\n\nIn Fortran, there's no built-in sort function, so perhaps the correct way is to proceed with a subroutine that sorts an array. Since the code is written in pure Fortran, we need to write or use a sort function.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the easiest way for now is to write a quicksort routine. But that could take some time. Alternatively, in the problem here, since the code just sorts the arrays. Maybe the code can use the internal function with an array. \n\nWait in the code:\n\nWe have arrays ai(1:n) and bi(1:n). We need to sort them in increasing order. \n\nWait, here's another idea: Fortran has the array assignment with the sort. \n\nWait, for example:\n\ncall heapsort(ai, n)\n\nBut again we need the function heapsort, which would have to be implemented. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'll proceed by writing a function to sort the arrays. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use selection sort (though not efficient for large N, but if the problem allows). But given that the problem is from AtCoder, perhaps the intended code would use a sort, so perhaps the Fortran code will have to include a sort routine.\n\nI should implement a quicksort for integers. \n\nAlternatively, here, let me code a selection sort, for brevity. Even if it's O(n^2), perhaps for the problem constraints, but maybe the code here requires.\n\nWait, I'm not sure but let me think. So perhaps in the code, the user just wants the translation, so perhaps it's better to proceed by indicating the need to sort the arrays. \n\nWait, the Java code's original approach sorts the two lists using Collections.sort(), which is an efficient sort. So to translate this properly, the Fortran code must sort the arrays efficiently. \n\nSo maybe I should write a subroutine to sort an array. Let me think of writing a quicksort function. \n\nAlternatively, the question might not be expecting me to implement a sort function, but perhaps we can use a compiler's built-in feature. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can call the sort in a way that uses the compiler's implementation, but without specific functions, perhaps the code is not portable. \n\nHmm, but here, perhaps for the purpose of code translation, I can write a simple bubble sort. Let me proceed with that, but note that this may not be efficient for large N, but for the purposes of code translation, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can proceed by stubbing the sort functions with comments, but I think the user wants the code to work. \n\nWait, maybe we can use the ISO\u5821\u5792 Fortran stuff? Like:\n\nIn Fortran 90, you can use the `MCSORT` intrinsic, but no, I think not. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, there might be some module available. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to proceed with a simple sort. \n\nAlternatively the code can use the 'bubble sort' for small N. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use an array and the sort is done via a simple routine.\n\nLet me draft the code structure first, and then in the sorting part, write a simple quicksort.\n\nAlright, proceeding step by step:\n\nFirst, declare necessary variables. \n\nThe code reads n, then n lines each with two integers. \n\nIn Fortran 90:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC169_E\nimplicit none\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: ai, bi\n... then read data. \n\nWe need to dynamically allocate arrays. \n\nFirst read n, then allocate the arrays accordingly. \n\nThen read n lines. \n\nWait, reading the n lines: each line has two integers. So the read statement can be in a loop. \n\nSomething like:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate( ai(n), bi(n) )\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) ai(i), bi(i)\nend do \n\nYes. Then sort the arrays. \n\nImplement sorting. For this purpose, let me proceed with implementing QuickSort. \n\nAlternatively, perform bubble sort. \n\nWait let me write a quicksort routine for ai.\n\n subroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer, intent(in) :: left, right\n    integer :: i, j, pivot, tmp\n    i = left\n    j = right\n    pivot = arr( (left + right)/2 )\n    do\n        do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n        do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n            j = j - 1\n        end do\n        if (i <= j) then\n            tmp = arr(i)\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n            arr(j) = tmp\n            i = i + 1\n            j = j - 1\n        end if\n        if (i > j) exit\n    end do\n    if (left < j) call quicksort(arr, left, j)\n    if (i < right) call quicksort(arr, i, right)\n end subroutine quicksort\n\nBut I need to pass the entire array, and the left and right indices. \n\nSo call quicksort(ai, 1, n)\n\nBut I have to be careful with stack overflows for large arrays. \n\nAlternatively, I can use a different sorting method. Let's try to write this. \n\nEven so, in the code, perhaps the problem will expect a simple approach, and I'll proceed with including the QuickSort subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, bubble sort, but with n up to say, 1e5 or similar, it would be too slow, so the best is to use Quicksort or mergesort. \n\nAlright, perhaps I can proceed with writing a Quicksort function. \n\nSo in the Fortran code's main program, after reading the arrays, call:\n\ncall quicksort(ai, 1, n)\n\ncall quicksort(bi, 1, n)\n\nThen compute the medians. \n\nNow, for the median calculation.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nif mod(n, 2) == 1 then \n\n the median for ai is ai( (n+1)/2 )\n\n similarly for bi, and the difference is (b - a +1) ?\n\n Wait, in the Java code when n is odd, the output is (bi.get(med) - ai.get(med) +1 ), since the elements are zero-based and when sorted, the center is at size/2. \n\nIn Fortran with 1-based arrays, for odd n, the median is at (n+1)/2. \n\nThus, when n is odd, compute b = bi(mid) and a = ai(mid). The formula would be (b - a +1). \n\nThen, if even, the mid indices are:\n\nmid1 = n/2 \n\nmid2 = n/2 +1 \n\nso for ai, b is the average of ai(mid1) and ai(mid2). \n\nSimilarly, c is average of bi(mid1) and bi(mid2). \n\nThe formula is 2*(c -b) +1? \n\nWait in the Java code for even case:\n\nb is (ai.get(n/2) + ai.get(n/2 -1))/2. \n\nWait in 0-based, for n=4:\n\nn/2 = 2, so elements at index1=1 (n/2-1 is 1) and index2=2 (n/2 is 2). The average is (ai(1)+ai(2))/2 \n\nIn 1-based, the elements for n=4 are at positions 2 and 3 (since first half is positions 1-2 and second 3-4, so mid1=2, mid2=3). \n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nb = (ai(mid1) + ai(mid2))/2. \n\nWait but the code uses double. Since Fortran uses variables with type real for decimals. \n\nWait the code in Java for even case computes c and b as doubles. So in Fortran, we'll have to use real numbers for those variables. \n\nThe Java code computes 2*(c-b) +1 and casts to int, then print. \n\nSo in Fortran, the steps would be similar. \n\nPutting it all together. \n\nThe steps in code:\n\nRead n, then read the pairs into ai and bi arrays.\n\nSort the arrays. \n\nThen compute the required values. \n\nNow, putting all this into code. \n\nFirst, the program structure. \n\nThe program must read inputs, process, output the result. \n\nYour Fortran code would be structured like:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc169_e\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, mid\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: ai, bi\n  real :: b, c\n\n  read *, n\n  allocate( ai(n), bi(n) )\n  do i = 1, n\n    read *, ai(i), bi(i)\n  end do\n\n  call sort_ai\n  call sort_bi \n\n  ! --> here, compute the median, etc.\n\ncontains\n subroutine sort_ai()\n   call quicksort_ai(ai, 1, n)\n end subroutine sort_ai\n\n subroutine sort_bi()\n   call quicksort_ai(bi, 1, n)\n end subroutine sort_bi\n\n    ! Define Quicksort subroutine here \n    subroutine quicksort(arr, left, right)\n    ! ... code for quicksort as above, but this needs to be generic or separate for each array\n\nWait, but I need to have a general sort routine. \n\nHmm, perhaps the Quicksort can be written for a generic array. Let me redefine the subroutine with a more generic approach. \n\nAlternatively, here's a standard Fortran quicksort routine for integers. \n\nWait the problem is passing the array into the subroutine. \n\nHere's a common quicksort implementation:\n\nsubroutine quicksort(arr, first, last)\n    integer :: arr(first:last)\n    integer :: first, last\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    i = first\n    j = last\n    pivot = arr((first + last)/2) \n\n    do\n        do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n            i = i + 1\n        end do\n        do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n            j = j - 1\n        end do\n        if (i <= j) then\n            temp = arr(i)\n            arr(i) = arr(j)\n            arr(j) = temp\n            i = i + 1\n            j = j - 1\n        end if\n        if (i > j) exit\n    end do\n\n    if (first < j) call quicksort(arr, first, j)\n    if (i < last) call quicksort(arr, i, last)\nend subroutine quicksort\n\nWait in this code, the 'arr' is passed as an assumed-size array. \n\nThus, in the main program, to sort ai and bi, we can call quicksort(ai, 1, n) and quicksort(bi, 1, n) \n\nWait let's write that. \n\nPutting all together:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc169_e\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger, allocatable :: ai(:), bi(:)\nreal :: b, c\n\nread *, n\nallocate(ai(n), bi(n))\ndo i = 1, n\n    read *, ai(i), bi(i)\nend do\n\ncall quicksort(ai, 1, n)\ncall quicksort(bi, 1, n)\n\nif (mod(n,2) == 1) then\n    mid = (n +1)/2 \n    print *, bi(mid) - ai(mid) +1\nelse\n    mid = n/2\n    b = (real(ai(mid)) + real(ai(mid+1))) / 2.0d0\n    c = (real(bi(mid)) + real(bi(mid+1))) / 2.0d0\n    print *, nint( 2*(c - b) +1.d0 ) ! since cast to integer\n    ! Wait in Java code, it's (int)(2*(c -b)+1), so using nint or int?\n    ! nint is the nearest integer function, but since c and b are averages of two integers, 2*(c-b) would be integer? \n\nWait, for example, suppose ai has elements arr and mid elements are a and b, then (a +b)/2 is stored in b. So when multiplied by 2, that gives (a +b). Similarly for c. Thus, the difference (c -b)*2 is (c -b)*(2)= ( (sum for bi) - (sum for ai) ) \n\nWait let's see example: suppose ai's mid points are 5 and 7. The average is 6, so 2*(6) is 12. For the bi mid points 8 and 10, average 9, so 9*2 is 18. The difference is 18-12 =6, plus 1 gives 7. So yes, that would be an integer. \n\nThus in Fortran, 2*(c -b) is an exact integer. \n\nSo 2*(c-b)+1 is already an integer, which the Java code (int) casts, which in Fortran can be written as int() function but for real numbers, it would possibly truncate. Or use nint(), but since c and b are computed as (a + a2)/2, c-b is ( (b1 + b2) - (a1 +a2) ) /2, so 2*(c -b) = (b1 +b2 -a1 -a2). The difference would be an integer. So 2*(c-b) +1 is also integer, so the code can compute it directly. \n\nTherefore, in the else branch, the calculation is (2*(c -b) +1). Thus in Fortran:\n\nprint *, 2*(c - b) +1 \n\nThus the code can do print *, int(2*(c -b)+1). But let's see how the Java does it. The code does (int) (2*(c -b)+1), so same. \n\nBut in Fortran, since c and b are real, their differences multiplied by 2 would be a real. Adding 1 gives a real. But to output as integer, we can cast with nint or just use integer conversion. \n\nAlternatively, the code can compute as real( kind=8 ), then take the integer part. \n\nAlternatively, compute all in integers. \n\nWait another approach for the even case:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nmid = n /2 \n\nsumai = ai(mid) + ai(mid +1)\n\nsumbi = bi(mid) + bi(mid+1)\n\n difference = (sumbi - sumai) + 1 \n\n then print *, difference \n\nBecause 2*( ( (ai(mid)+ai(mid+))/2) ) = sumai, so 2*(c - b) is (sumbi - sumai). So adding 1 gives the same result. \n\nWait yes, because:\n\n2*(c -b ) = ( (sumbi)/2 - (sumai)/2 ) *2 = sumbi - sumai \n\nTherefore, 2*(c -b)+1 = (sumbi - sumai) +1 \n\nThis eliminates the need for using real numbers. That's better to do so to avoid precision errors. \n\nAh, that's a good point. Thus, we can rephrase the even case algorithm:\n\nIn code:\n\ninteger:: sumai, sumbi\n\nmid = n/2 \n\nsumai = ai(mid) + ai(mid+1)\n\nsumbi = bi(mid) + bi(mid+1)\n\nresult = sumbi - sumai +1 \n\nprint *, result \n\nThis would be entirely integer arithmetic. So that's better. \n\nAh, right! Because the average of the two middle elements in integers, when multiplied by 2 gives exactly their sum. So difference between the sums plus one would be exact. \n\nSo in Fortran, the even case can be written as integers. \n\nThat simplifies the code. \n\nThus, the code can avoid using real variables. \n\nSo, that's better. \n\nTherefore, recomputing:\n\nIn code:\n\nif (mod(n,2) ==1) then \n\nmid = (n+1)/2 \n\nval = bi(mid) - ai(mid) +1 \n\nelse \n\nmid =n/2 \n\nval = (bi(mid) + bi(mid+1) ) - (ai(mid)+ai(mid+1)) +1 \n\nprint *, val \n\nend if \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nSo the Fortran code would:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc169_e\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, mid, val\n  integer, allocatable :: ai(:), bi(:)\n\n  read *, n\n  allocate( ai(n), bi(n) )\n  do i =1, n\n    read *, ai(i), bi(i)\n  end do\n\n  call quicksort(ai, 1, n)\n  call quicksort(bi, 1, n)\n\n  if (mod(n,2) ==1) then\n    mid = (n+1)/2\n    val = bi(mid) - ai(mid) + 1 \n  else\n    mid = n/2\n    val = (bi(mid)+bi(mid+1)) - ( ai(mid)+ai(mid+1) ) + 1 \n  end if\n\n  print *, val\n\ncontains\n   ! Here define the quicksort \n   recursive subroutine quicksort(arr, first, last)\n      integer, intent(inout) :: arr(first:last)\n      integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n      integer :: i, j, pivot, tmp\n\n      i = first\n      j = last\n      pivot = arr( (first + last)/2 )\n\n      do\n         do while (arr(i) < pivot)\n             i = i +1\n         end do\n         do while (arr(j) > pivot)\n             j = j -1\n         end do\n         if (i <= j) then\n             tmp = arr(i)\n             arr(i) = arr(j)\n             arr(j) = tmp\n             i = i +1\n             j = j -1\n         end if\n         if (i > j) exit\n      end do\n\n      if (first < j) call quicksort(arr, first, j)\n      if (i < last) call quicksort(arr, i, last)\n   end subroutine quicksort\n\nend program atcoder_abc169_e\n\nYes, this should work. \n\nNow, let me check for possible errors.\n\nFirst, the quicksort subroutine: is it embedded within the program?\n\nIn the above code, the quicksort is a contained subroutine in the program, using the \"contains\" block. That should be fine in Fortran 90/95.\n\nTesting when n is 1 (odd):\n\nmid =1 \n\noutput is (b1 - a1 +1 )\n\nWhich matches Java. \n\nWhen even n=2:\n\nmid=1. So for ai(1) and ai(2), their sum etc.\n\nWait in code for n=2:\n\nmid is 1 (2/2 =1), so the sum is ai(1)+ai(2) and same for bi. Then val is (sumbi - sumai)+1. Exactly as per the original code's formula 2*(c -b) +1. \n\nThus this works. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose n=4. \n\nSuppose the arrays after sorting ai are [1,3,5,7], bi [2,4,6,8]\n\nmid is 2. \n\nsumai=3+5=8; sumbi=4+6=10 \u2192 val = (10-8)+1=3. \n\nWhich would be the same as ( ( (4+6)/2 - (3+5)/2 ) )*2 +1 \u2192 (5-4)*2+1 \u2192 2+1=3. Correct. \n\nYes.\n\nThus this code should work. \n\nNow, the Fortran code's entire structure is correct. \n\nThe sorting functions are properly called, and the logic follows exactly as the Java code. \n\nTherefore this should be the correct translation."
