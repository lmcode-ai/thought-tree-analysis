    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding the original Java code first. The code is solving some kind of dynamic programming problem. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads four integers: v1, v2, t, and d. Then it initializes a 2D array dp of size (t-1)x1150, filled with very small values (-1e17). The initial state is dp[0][v1] = v1. \n\nThen, there are loops for filling the dp array. The outer loop runs from i=1 to t-2. For each i, it iterates over j from 0 to 1150, and then for x from 0 to d and also in reverse. These loops compute the maximum possible value for dp[i][j] based on previous entries. Finally, after filling the dp array, it calculates the answer by checking if the final position is near v2 within d steps and taking the max.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let me note the key points:\n\nFortran uses arrays differently. The 2D array in Java would be declared as a 2D array in Fortran. But Fortran has row-major or column-major? Wait, I think Fortran is column-major, but since the user will translate, need to make sure the dimensions are correctly ordered. But in Java, the loops are for i (rows) and j (columns), so in Fortran, the array would be (t-1,1150).\n\nWait, Java's 2D arrays are stored in row-major order. So when moving to Fortran, which is column-major, perhaps the indices will be reversed? Hmm, maybe better to just stick to the same order, as we can adjust loop variables.\n\nFirst step: Variables. Java variables v1, v2, t, d are integers. In Fortran, they can be declared as integers. \n\nThe dp array is a 2D long array. Fortran uses REAL or INTEGER for arrays, but since the values can be up to 1e17 (but in Java they are long, so we need INTEGER*8 in Fortran) or we can use REAL*8. However, in the code, it's initialized with -1e17 and Math.max. Since all operations are integer additions (since j is an integer), maybe using INTEGER*8 is better. Alternatively, in Fortran 90+, use \"integer(kind=8)\" for 64-bit integers.\n\nNext, the first part is reading input. In Fortran, we can read with a read statement. But since it's four variables, the first line would be:\n\nread*, v1, v2, t, d\n\nNext, declare the dp array. The original code has new long[t-1][1150]; so in Fortran, it's dp as an array of (t-1, 1150). Wait, but in Fortran, the arrays are declared with static dimensions unless we use allocatable arrays. The problem here is that t is input dynamically, so in Java it's allocated at runtime, but in Fortran, we might need to use allocatable arrays. Since in the code, t can be up to... well, looking at the constraints from the problem? But the original code has loops up to t-2. Since the code is for codeforces problem 534B, perhaps the constraints for t are manageable. Let me think about the problem.\n\nWait, for codeforces problem 534B, the problem is about a man moving in a city with turns, and probably time steps. But the actual constraints matter here. But the code that we are translating uses a dp array of size (t-1)x1150. So in Fortran, the array has to have dynamic bounds? Because t is read from the input. Thus, we should use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo first, we must declare the dp array as allocatable. The declaration would be something like: \n\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\nThen after reading t:\n\nallocate( dp(0:t-2, 0:1149) ) \n\nWait, in the Java code, the array is of size t-1 rows (from 0 to t-2?), because in Java arrays are 0-based. The initial code has for (int i=0; i < t-1; i++) which would go from 0 to t-2 inclusive. So in Fortran, since arrays can be 0-based? Or should we adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, in Fortran, by default, array indices start at 1, but you can specify a lower bound. To use 0-based arrays, you need to define the array with 0:upper. So we need to declare dp with dimensions from 0 to t-2 in the first index (since index i starts at 0 in Java) and from 0 to 1149 (since j up to 1150? Wait the code says 1150 elements. In the for loop \"for (int j = 0; j < 1150; j++)\", so it's 0 to 1149? Since in Java, arrays are 0-based. Wait in the java array, the declaration is new long[t-1][1150]. So each row has 1150 elements, indices 0 to 1149. \n\nSo in Fortran, the array dimensions would be (0: t-2), (0:1149). So the allocate would be:\n\nallocate(dp(0:t-2, 0:1149)) \n\nNow, initializing the dp array to -1e17. In Java, the code loops through each row and uses Arrays.fill. In Fortran, we have to loop each row and set the elements. \n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < t - 1; i++) {\n    Arrays.fill(dp[i], -(long) (1e17));\n}\n\nSo for each row i, set all elements in that row to -1e17. In Fortran, this can be done with loops:\n\ndo i = 0, t-2\n    do j = 0, 1149\n        dp(i,j) = -1_8 * 10_8**17\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but 1e17 is 1 followed by 17 zeros. Note the exponents. Alternatively, can write as -100000000000000000 (but it's better with exponents so as not to mismatch)\n\nBut in Fortran, the literal for 1e17 is 1e17, but as an integer? Since in the Java code, we cast to long, so in Fortran, it's an integer*8 value. So initializing with -1*(10**17). Alternatively:\n\ndp(i,j) = -100000000000000000000L ? Wait no, 1e17 is 10^17, so that would be 10000000000000000. So 10^17 is 1e17, which is 10000000000000000. Wait, 10^17 is 1 followed by 17 zeros. So 10^17 is a 18-digit number, which is too big for a 32-bit int (max is 2^31-1 ~ 2e9). But in 64-bit integers, the max value is around 9e18. So 1e17 is okay. \n\nAlternatively, we can write in Fortran:\n\n-10000000000000000_8, but better using exponents? Let's see: 10^17 can be written as (10**17). So -1_8 * 10_8**17. \n\nWait the base must be integer, otherwise with 10.0**17 could be real. So the way to do it for integer:\n\n-IntArray(...)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just assign all elements to be the value. Let me code that.\n\nNow after initializing, set dp[0][v1] = v1. In Fortran:\n\ndp(0, v1) = v1 \n\nBut in Fortran, the index of j is from 0 to 1149. So if v1 is out of that range (since in the problem, maybe the constraints for v1 are that it's <= 1149? To avoid it being out of bounds). Well, the original Java code's 1150 indices probably correspond to possible values. So assuming in the problem, v1 is within that range.\n\nThen, the variables:\n\nsum is declared as a long, but in the code it is initialized to 0, but not used? Wait looking back at the code:\n\nWait in Java code, there's a variable sum =0; but in the subsequent loops, they have loops over i starting from 1 to t-2 (since in Java the loop is for (int i = 1; i < t -1; ... so in the code as written the for loop is i < t-1, so the upper bound is t-2 (since i runs from 1 to t-2).\n\nWait, in the next loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < t - 1; i++) \n\nWait, the loop condition is i < t-1, so i runs up to (t-2). That's correct. \n\nBut in the code, they have a 'sum' variable, but looking at the code, I don't see sum being used again. Wait in the original code, the user provided the code may have a typo. Wait let me check the original code again:\n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < t - 1; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < 1150; j++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x <= d; x++) {\n            if (j + x < 1150) \n                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j+x] +j);\n        }\n        for (int x = d; x >=0; x--) {\n            if (j -x >=0) \n                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j -x] +j );\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, and the sum variable is declared but not used. Oh, that might be a mistake in the code provided? Or maybe it's a typo. Because in the original code here, the variable 'sum' is initialized but not used anywhere else, so perhaps it's a mistake. \n\nAssuming that, perhaps the code is as written, including the sum variable but it's part of the given code. Since when porting to Fortran, I should just ignore or leave as is, even if it's not used. Maybe the user pasted a wrong code, but since I have to translate exactly as given, except for that variable, I'll proceed. Wait, but the code's logic is correct? \n\nHmm, in the current code, the 'sum' variable is initialized, but perhaps there's a mistake. Since the code's loops do not touch sum, I might think that the 'sum' was meant to be part of the inner loops. But regardless, the user provided it so I'll keep the 'sum' variable in Fortran, but initialize it. So in Fortran:\n\nsum = 0\n\nBut since Fortran uses implicit none, we have to declare it. So in the variable declarations: integer(kind=8) :: sum =0\n\nNow, proceeding.\n\nThe loops after the initial setup. \n\nFirst loop:\n\nloop over i from 1 to (t-2) inclusive. (since in Java: for (int i=1; i < t-1; i++)\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is written as:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2 \n\nThen loop over j from 0 to 1149 (since in the Java code it is 0 < 1150: j < 1150 means j goes up to 1149)\n\nIn Fortran: do j =0, 1149\n\nThen for each j, first loop x from 0 to d (inclusively). \n\nThen, for the first inner loop over x (x from 0 to d), check if (j +x) is <1150. So in Fortran, if (j +x) <= 1149 (since array indices go to 1149). \n\nSo in code:\n\ndo x = 0, d\n    if (j +x <= 1149) then\n        dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j +x ) +j )\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait but in the Java code, for (x <=d) and in the first loop. \n\nThen the second loop over x going from d down to 0, and doing (j -x) >=0. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndo x = d,0, -1\n    if (j -x >=0) then\n        dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j -x) +j )\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait, but the code also uses  Math.max so the Fortran becomes: the maximum between the current dp value and the expression. But since in Fortran, the array starts at the initial -1e17, we need to ensure that we pick the maximum between the existing dp(i,j) and the new term.\n\nSo the code in the loop should implement this for each x.\n\nNow, after all these loops, the final part is calculating ans. \n\nThe Java code does:\n\nlong ans = Long.MIN_VALUE;\n\nfor (int i = t-2; i < t-1; i++) { ... this is just i = t-2, since the loop ends before i reaches t.\n\nWait, t-2 to t-2, so loop runs once. Then inside that, loop over j, and check if |j - v2| <= d. Then set ans to the maximum between itself and dp[i][j] + v2.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nans = - huge(1_8)   ! because Long.MIN_VALUE would be the minimum possible long value.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\ndo i = t-2, t-2  (since in Java it's i starts and ends at t-2)\n\n    do j = 0, 1149\n        if ( abs(j - v2) <= d ) then\n            ans = max(ans, dp(i,j) + v2 )\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nThen print ans.\n\nNow, putting all together into Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  ! variable declarations. \n  integer :: v1, v2, t, d\n  integer(kind=8) :: dp(0:,0:), but since it's allocatable, it should be declared as dimension(:,:), allocatable.\n  \nWait, let's think.\n\nVariables:\n\nDeclare v1, v2, t, d as integers. But in Fortran, unless specified to 32/64 bits, but for the problem constraints, they can be standard integers (for instance if t is up to like 1e5? But in the code here, the code uses a 2D array of size up to t-1, so for large t, but maybe the constraints here are within limits for 32-bit integers. Since the Java code uses int for them, we can use integer variables.\n\nFor d, since x loops from 0 to d, so d could be up to the maximum possible in the problem.\n\nNow, dp is the array: which is 2D, allocation as before.\n\nThe variables:\n\ninteger :: v1, v2, t, d\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans, sum\n\nBut ans and sum can be declared in the normal manner. Wait sum is not used.\n\nWait, the code given has:\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nBut in the loop, I don't see sum used. So perhaps the user made a typo. So in the Fortran code, perhaps it's okay to declare it and keep it there, even thou it's not used. Alternatively, just remove the sum variable but I'll translate exactly.\n\nWait in code, sum is declared but not used. So probably it's a mistake. Maybe in the original code, perhaps intended as a variable but misplaced. But in the provided example, we can just initialize it but leave it unused.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead the input:\n\nread *, v1, v2, t, d\n\nCheck if t is less than 1. Well, but the problem likely has constraints such that t is at least 2?\n\nThen allocate the dp array:\n\nallocate( dp(0:t-2,0:1149) )\n\nInitialize all elements to -1e17:\n\ndo i=0,t-2\n   do j=0,1149\n      dp(i,j) = -1_8 * 10_8**17\n   end do\nend do\n\nThen set dp(0,v1) = v1. Wait in Java it was dp[0][v1] = v1; so in Fortran:\n\ndp(0, v1) = v1\n\nWait, but v1 can be up to possibly more than 1149? Wait the Java code allocates 1150 elements. So if v1 is larger than 1149 then the Java code would have an Array out of bounds. So I think in the problem, variables like v1 are within the range.\n\nThus, proceeding.\n\nThen sum is initialized to 0, but in code it's not used. \n\nMoving to the loops:\n\ndo i = 1, t-2\n\n    do j=0, 1149\n    \n        do x =0, d\n            if (j +x <= 1149) then\n                dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j +x) +j)\n            end if\n        end do\n        \n        do x=d, 0,-1\n            if (j -x >=0 ) then\n                dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j -x) +j )\n            end if\n        end do\n\n    end do  ! j loop\n    \nend do ! i loop \n\nThen, calculate the ans:\n\nans = -1_8 * 10_8**18   ! which would be lower than -1e17 to start with. \n\nThen:\n\ndo i = t-2, t-2\n\n    do j=0,1149\n        if ( abs(j -v2) <=d ) then\n            ans = max(ans, dp(i,j)+v2 )\n        end if\n    end do\nend do\n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nWait but in the Java code, the outermost loop for ans is:\n\nfor (int i = t - 2; i < t -1; i++) \n\nWhich is only executed once, since i starts at t-2 and the condition is i < t-1, so it only runs when i is t-2.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop from i = t-2 to t-2 is the same.\n\nThus, the code in Fortran would:\n\nprint*, ans\n\nBut in Fortran, newline is needed. So to print as one line, use:\n\nwrite(*,*) ans\n\nPutting it all together in code format.\n\nLet me structure this properly.\n\nNow, check the initial dp initialization. The loops for i and j.\n\nBut in Fortran, if the initial dp is filled with -1e17 (which is -10^17). \n\nWait, in the Java code, the code sets Math.max where it might have a higher value. So calculations are okay.\n\nNow, let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program:\n\nprogram codeforces_534_B\nimplicit none\ninteger :: v1, v2, t, d\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans, sum_var\n\n!

Alternatively, perhaps better to keep all in one code block without subroutines, but perhaps using these subroutines to make it clearer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written in a straightforward way, without subroutines, to avoid complications. Subroutines are okay, but I have to make sure to pass the dimensions correctly.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write all in the main block:\n\nprogram codeforces_534_B\nimplicit none\ninteger :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\ninteger(kind=8) :: ans\n\nread *, v1, v2, t, d\n\n!

Need to convert to an integer(kind=8):\n\ndp(0, v1) = int(v1, kind=8)\n\nAh, important point.\n\nThen the loops:\n\ndo i =1, t-2\n\n    do j =0, 1149\n        do x =0, d\n        \n            if ( (j +x) <= 1149 ) then\n                dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1,j +x ) + j )\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        do x =d, 0, -1\n            if ( (j -x) >=0 ) then\n                dp(i,j) = max( dp(i,j), dp(i-1, j -x) + j )\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\nend do\n\n! Find ans\nans = -10000000000000000000_8  ! some very small value like Long.MIN_VALUE. Here using -1e18 is sufficient. \n\ndo j =0,1149\n    if ( abs(j -v2) <=d ) then\n        ans = max(ans, dp(t-2, j ) + v2 )\n    end if\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\ndeallocate(dp)\n\nend program codeforces_534_B\n\nWait, I think this might be better, more straightforward.\n\nWait, note:\n\n- The initialization setting dp(0, v1) = v1 must be as an integer(kind=8). So we have to cast v1 to 8.\n\nAlso, variables' scope. We must ensure that all variables are declared. \n\nLet me check:\n\nVariables:\n\n- v1, v2, t, d are declared as integer.\n\n- dp is properly allocated.\n\n- i, j, x in loops also declared as integers.\n\nYes.\n\nIn compute ans:\n\n'ans' must be declared with integer(kind=8).\n\nYes.\n\nWait also the line ans = dp(t-2,j)+v2: v2 is an integer (so converted to 8 automatically when adding to dp's 8-bit integer.\n\nPutting it all into code:\n\nNow, some possible issues:\n\n1. Initialization with loops: during the loops for the initial DP, maybe the first step (i=0) is already set, but in the initialization, we set all to -1e17 except dp[0][v1].\n\n2. The loops for the inner loops (x from 0 to d and vice versa). The Java code uses two loops for positive and negative steps, in x.\n\nThe way the code is written here in the main block should replicate it.\n\nFurthermore, in Fortran, the array access is dp(i,j), same as in Java's dp[i][j]. \n\nNow, one critical point: The variable 'sum' in the Java code is declared but not used. Since the user's code includes it, but in this translated code it's not present, perhaps the code is slightly different, but since the original code may have a mistake, and since the user's code includes it, but it's not used, perhaps we can just include a dummy declaration. Like declare an integer(kind=8) :: sum_var =0. So the code would look more like the original.\n\nAdding that back in.\n\nNow finalizing the code:\n\nHere is the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_534_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: v1, v2, t, d, i, j, x\n  integer(kind=8), allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n  integer(kind=8) :: ans\n  integer(kind=8) :: sum_var ! unused variable as in the Java code\n\n! Read input\n  read *, v1, v2, t, d\n\n! Allocate DP array (0 to t-2 rows, 0 to 1149 columns)\n  allocate( dp(0:t-2, 0:1149) )\n\n! Initialize DP array to -1e17\n  do i = 0, t-2\n      do j = 0, 1149\n          dp(i,j) = -10000000000000000_8\n      end do\n  end do\n\n! Set the initial state\n  dp(0, v1) = int(v1, kind=8)\n\n! Dummy sum_var as in Java\n  sum_var = 0\n\n!

Calculate answer: i is t-2 (only loop once)\n  ans = -10000000000000000000_8  ! Initialize to minimum possible value\n\n  do j =0, 1149\n      if ( abs(j - v2) <= d ) then\n          ans = max(ans, dp(t-2,j) + v2 )\n      end if\n  end do\n\n! Output result\n  print *, ans\n\n! Deallocate memory\n  deallocate(dp)\n\nend program codeforces_534_B\n\nA few points to confirm:\n\n- The loop over x in the two directions: the first for moving in positive x and adding to j, the second for subtracting. This corresponds to what's in Java.\n\n- The array indices are all correct (JAVA uses 0-based, Fortran uses 0-based by declaring ranges from 0).\n\n- The initial value of ans has to be very small, to allow the max function to pick the first valid element. Here, -1e18 is set, which is smaller than the initial DP values of -1e17. \n\n- The cast of v1 to kind=8: ensures that when v1 is stored (as integer) into the dp array (kind=8), it's done properly.\n\nWait, also note that in Fortran, the write/print statements: \"print *, ans\" will output the value, but since it's an integer, that should be fine.\n\nEdge Cases: What if v1 is 0? Then the code correctly sets dp(0,0) to 0. What if v2 is 0 but with j-0: yes.\n\nAnother edge case: t=2, so the DP arrays is of size 1 row (t-1), and the loops only run once? The code should handle it.\n\nPotential optimization in loops: The loops in the inner loops might run x from 0 to d and back, maybe there's overlap, but since it's replicated from original code, we keep it as is.\n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
