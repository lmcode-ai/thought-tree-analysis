Then in the code, after the loops, when n is 1, the code 'if (n==1)' part forces the output to be 0 or 1 instead of the max stored, which I don't understand. Wait this is conflicting: For n=1, according to the code:\n\nThe max after loops would be the result of flipping (so if original was 0: count is 1 \u2192 max becomes 1; if original was 1 \u2192 count is 0 \u2192 max becomes 0). But in the code's special case, when n==1, the output is:\n\nif arr[0] is 1 \u2192 output 0, else 1. Wait but that exactly matches the max from the loops. So why does this code have an exception for n==1? Because perhaps when n=1, in the code's loops runs once and hit the flip, setting max to that, but what if original array is better? Wait perhaps not.",

The code's loops run once for n=1, thus flipping gives a count of 0 or 1. So for the case arr[0] is 1 (original count is 1, but flipping makes it 0. So the max would be 0. But then, the overall best is to not flip? Wait but in the problem's logic, flipping must occur. So in this case, the maximum count would indeed be 0 or 1, but the code's logic does that correctly. Wait then why does the code have the exception for n ==1? Wait in the code's code after the loops (not inside the n==1 case), it says:\n\nif (n ==1) { ... }\n\nelse { printf(max); }. So the code is assuming that for n==1, the loops may have not captured the consideration that flipping is optional? But according to the problem, the flip is mandatory?",

Original was 1 \u2192 count is 0. So max variable is set to that. Then, in the output part, the code does:\n\nif n is 1 then:\n\n   if arr[0] ==1 \u2192 print 0 (which is the max), else \u2192 print 1 (also max), so this is the same as just printing max.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. The Java program reads an array of integers, then tries to find the maximum number of 1's possible by flipping all the elements in a subarray (from index i to j) and counting the number of 1s. The maximum count is then printed. \n\nHmm, the code has a main method that uses a Scanner to input the data, then loops through all possible i and j to determine the best subarray to flip. The helper function 'checKNo' checks the number of 1's in the modified array. Oh wait, that function's name is misspelled as 'checKNo' instead of 'checkNo'? Well, maybe a typo but in Fortran, the function name can be written correctly anyway.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of Fortran compared to Java. Fortran uses modules or program units. Since the code is a single file, I can write a program that includes both the main part and the subroutine for checking the count. Subroutines in Fortran are like methods, but they need to be declared properly. \n\nIn the Java code, there's a Scanner, so in Fortran, I should use READ statements. The array in Java is of size n, and variables like max are initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE. In Fortran, integers can go up to certain sizes. But here, the maximum possible value for the array isn't clear, but since it reads integers as 0 or 1 (probably), but original values can be 0 or 1? Wait, looking at the code: in the inner loops, they check if brr[k] is 0 and flip it to 1, or else flip to 0. Wait, the 'arr' array elements must be 0 or 1 because flipping 0 gives 1 and vice versa. Because the code is designed that way. Oh, but in the problem statement (since the user didn't provide) it's possible this code is for Codeforces problem 327A. Let me recall, problem 327A is about maximizing consecutive ones, but perhaps flipping a subarray. Wait, maybe the problem is where you can flip any subarray once, to get maximum 1s. That seems to fit.\n\nThe code's approach is exhaustive search: try all possible subarrays (i to j) and flip them, then compute the total 1's and track the maximum. Since this is O(n^3), which could be okay if n is small (like <= 100). For n up to say 100, that's 1,000,000 iterations, but per iteration there's a loop of n for copying and flipping. Wait, actually in the code's loops: the outer loop is for i and j (up to n). The inner loop for the k in the flipping is O(n), but then each time they make a copy of the entire array. Hmm, this is probably O(n^3) time. But since in the problem's array size might be small enough, but in Fortran, we can maybe optimize, but for the translation, we'll stick to the same algorithm.\n\nNow in the code, the main steps are:\n\n1. Read n and n elements from input.\n2. For each possible i and j (with i \u2264 j), make a copy of the array, flip the elements from i to j (indices in Java are 0-based), and count the total 1s in the modified array.\n3. Keep track of the maximum count.\n4. Output the max, but for n ==1, there's a special case. If the single element is 1, it becomes 0 by flipping, but maybe flip is optional? Wait, let me think. For n=1, the code does if arr[0] is 1, prints 0, else 1. Because flipping gives 0 or 1? Wait, if the input is 1, flipping gives 0. So the maximum would be 0? but flipping might not be necessary. Wait the original count is 1, but if you choose to flip, you get 0. So maximum possible is either 1 (without flipping) or 0 (if you flip). Wait, but the code's logic in this case is to choose the best between those possibilities. Wait, in the code, when n=1, it's not part of the loops? Wait let's see:\n\nThe loops over i and j. For i=0 and j=0 (since array is 1-based in Fortran?), but perhaps in the current code, the loops would include flipping the single element, so when you flip, the value becomes 1 if it was 0, or 0. The maximum between all possible subarrays.\n\nWait, the code initializes max to Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is a very small number, so even if flipping that element would give something worse, it might get overwritten. Wait the code is structured such that for each possible i, j, flip that interval, compute count, and if it's bigger, update max. \n\nHowever, when n is 1, the possible subarrays are only the first element. The maximum count would be either 1 (original value) or whatever after flipping. But because in the code, for n=1, they do that 'if (n ==1)' check, and then output the better of flipping versus not flipping?\n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that you must flip a subarray exactly once? Because the code's approach is that for every possible subarray, you flip it once. Wait, but in the problem's statement (I assume), flipping a subarray exactly once would choose the best one. However, in the Java code, they consider all possible subarrays (so flipping that one), and then pick the maximum count.\n\nWait the code's algorithm is to try every possible subarray from i to j, flip those elements (toggle each between 0 and 1), compute the total 1's, and track the maximum. Then output the maximum.\n\nHowever note that in the original array, the best scenario could be not doing any flip, but the code requires you to choose any subarray (including one with length 0?) No, since in loops i from 0 to n-1 and j from i to n-1. So the only possibility of not flipping is if the original array has the maximum already. Wait no: the code is considering that you must flip exactly one subarray (any), so the non-flip option is not considered. Is that correct?\n\nWait that's a problem. For example, if the array is all 1s already, you have to perform a flip, which would reduce it. So then the best is not to choose a subarray and leave it as is? But the code doesn't consider that case. Wait, in the original code, for every subarray, it flips it, so if the initial array has max 1s, you might be forced to choose the worst option. But maybe the problem requires that you must flip exactly one subarray?\n\nWait maybe I should check what problem 327A asks. Let me remember: The problem is \"Flipping Game\". The statement is: You are given a sequence of integers (all 0 or 1?), and you can choose any consecutive subsequence [l, r], and flip all the bits in there (0 to 1, 1 to 0). You can do this only once. You need to choose the subsequence [l, r] such that the total number of 1's in the array is as large as possible after flipping.\n\nAh right, so you have to choose to flip exactly one subarray (could be of length 0? No, but maybe minimum 1 element). Thus the original array's count could be higher than any of the flipped options. Wait, if array is already all 1s: flipping any subarray would set some to 0s, so the best is not to choose any flip? But according to problem's statement, you have to choose the subarray, so the problem is to choose the best possible subarray, even if it reduces the count. But the problem is actually to find the maximum after any possible flip. Which may include flipping a subarray which gives you higher.\n\nWait, for example, if initial array is all 1s, then flipping any subarray will decrease the total. So the optimal is the original array (without flipping?), but according to problem's rules, the flip must be done. Or maybe the problem allows to choose a zero-length? Not sure. Maybe the original problem allows choosing the subarray as nothing, but in the code's approach, that is not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires choosing a subarray of at least length 1. Then the optimal must be when the subarray is the best possible even if it's worse than the original. Hmm but that can't be.\n\nWait I need to check the problem's exact requirements. Since I'm translating the code, perhaps it's more important to stick to the code's logic. Looking at the code: \n\nThe max is initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE, and then for each i to j (i starts at 0 to n-1, j starts at i to n-1). So it's considering all subarrays of the array. Each of these is a possible target for flipping, so the code is flipping every possible such subarray, and then calculating the maximum. \n\nSo the maximum could indeed be worse than the original array? So in the code, if the original array had all 1's, the maximum among all flips would be n-1, which is worse than n, so then the code would output n-1. But perhaps the problem requires the maximum between the original and the chosen flip. But perhaps according to the problem's rules that you have to choose a subarray to flip. \n\nIn any case, the code as given must be translated to Fortran, so I need to make sure the Fortran version does exactly the same. \n\nNow, translating step by step.\n\nFirst, the main program:\n\nIn Fortran, the main program is a program block. So:\n\nprogram codeforces_327_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, arr(1000), i, j, k, max_val, x\n  parameter(n_max=100)  ? or a different size?\n\nWait, but the problem's constraints might have a maximum n? Since the original code uses java's int arrays which can be large, but when translating, assuming the maximum size can be, say, 1000, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, to use dynamic arrays. But in Fortran, one can use allocatable arrays. Let me think. Since Java allows variable length arrays, so in Fortran, the first thing to do is read n, then allocate an array of that size. Hmm.\n\nThe code first reads n, then reads n elements. So:\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\n  integer :: n\n  integer,allocatable :: arr(:)\n  integer :: ... variables\n\nRead n:\n\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(arr(n))\n\nThen read n integers:\n\nread(*,*) (arr(i), i=1, n) ? Since in Fortran, arrays are 1-based.\n\nWait, in Java, the array is 0-based. So in Fortran, which starts at 1, the code may need to adjust indices. That's important. Because the loops in Java are from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran with 1-based, it'll be 1 to n. So the code must be adjusted to handle the indices properly.\n\nWait the Java code for the array:\n\nfor (int k : arr) brr[x++] = k; \n\nIn Java, arr starts at 0, and in Fortran, arr starts at 1. So the code loops from i = 0 to n-1, but those will be 1-based in Fortran.\n\nHmm, need to be careful with the indices. Let me get back. Let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_327_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, j, k, max_val, x, m\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), temp(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  if (n == 0) then  ! but maybe n can't be zero?\n    stop\n  endif\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  read(*,*)(arr(i),i=1,n)\n  \n  max_val = -2147483647 ! Equivalent to Integer.MIN_VALUE (abs value). But in Fortran, need a very negative number. \n\nWait, but maybe Fortran integers can hold that value? Maybe using kind=4. Alternatively, perhaps initializing to zero, but we need to verify.\n\nThe code in Java starts max as the smallest integer so that any count found will overwrite it. So the maximum is set to MIN, and the initial value would update to the first flip's count, then proceed.\n\nWait in the original code, the first loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i< n; i++) \n\nso loops over the original array indices, which in Fortran would run from 1 to n. The same with all loops.\n\nWait in the Java code, i in the first loop is from 0 to n-1. Then j starts at i, so also from 0. So in Fortran, the indices are shifted by 1.\n\nHence, all loops in Fortran need to start from 1 to n, and the for example, the code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n   for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {});\n\nIn Fortran, this would translate as:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n   do j = i, n\n       ... \n   end do\nend do\n\nThe main loop.\n\nThen, in each iteration, we create a copy of the array (brr in Java). Since in Java, the code does:\n\nint brr[] = new int[n];\nfor (int k : arr) brr[x++] =k; \n\nBut since Java's for loops are element-wise, that is, each element of arr is copied into brr in order. So in Fortran, this could be written with a loop or array assignment.\n\n temp(1:n) = arr  ?; but assuming temp is allocated.\n\nWait in Java, they first create a new array, then copy the elements one by one. So in Fortran, we can just do temp = arr. However, the 'x' in the Java code was for the indices? Maybe not, since the for-each loop does x from 0 to n automatically. So in Fortran, to copy the array, it's straightforward:\n\nallocate(temp(n))\ntemp = arr\n\nBut then, the flipping: for the subarray from i to j inclusive? Wait in the Java code, for each k in i to j (since k starts at i, the loop 'for (int k = i; k <= j; k++)'). So in the Fortran code, after the i (of the first loops) variable, but we have to make sure that the indices are 1-based.\n\nWait let me look at relevant part:\n\nInside the loops:\n\nfor (int k = i; k <= j; k++) { ... }\n\nIn the outer loops, 'i' ranges from 0 to n-1 (Java's 0-based). So in the Java code, the indices of arr are from 0-based, so the first loop is over i (JAVA's i is from 0 to n-1) and j starts at i, so ranges from i to n-1. The flipping loop includes indices from i to j (inclusive). \n\nBut in Fortran:\n\nOriginal i and j would be 1 up to n. To replicate that, the flipping indices from i to j inclusive. So in Fortran:\n\ntemp is the array copy.\n\n do k = i,j  ! i is the loop variable from 1 to n, j goes from i to n\n     if (temp(k) ==0 ) then\n        temp(k) =1\n     else\n        temp(k) =0\n     end if\n end do \n\nWait but in Java, the loop is :\n\nfor (int k=i; k <=j; k++). So it's inclusive. So in Fortran, yes, the same.\n\nThen, after flipping, count the number of 1's. Wait, what is 'x' in the Java code? Wait in the code:\n\nint x =0;\nfor (int k : arr) brr[x++] =k;\n\nWait that's a bit redundant, but the equivalent would be in Fortran to copy the array. But wait in the code's logic, when they do \"for (int k :arr) brr[x++]=k\", which is just a copy of the array. So the temp array in Fortran is a copy of the original array.\n\nWait perhaps in Fortran we can avoid using the 'x' counter because we can use array copies directly.\n\nSo the process in the inner loops would be:\n\nfor each i and j from the loops:\n\nMake a copy of the array into temp.\n\nThen flip all elements from i to j in temp.\n\nThen, compute the count of 1s in temp. If it's larger than current max, set max.\n\nSo steps in Fortran:\n\nInside the loops over i and j (the outer loops), we do:\n\nallocate a copy array of arr, call it temp. Alternatively, better to make a temporary array inside the loop. Since in Fortran, array operations are straightforward.\n\nWait but for the variables in Fortran:\n\nWe need to have variables outside:\n\nREAD the input n, and arr.\n\nThen, in the double loops (i and j):\n\nallocate temp array? no, it's better to declare it with fixed size.\n\nSince n is a variable, perhaps we can make a temp array of size n:\n\nBut in Fortran, since arr is an allocatable array of size n, so the temp can be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps before the loops, declare temp as a similarly sized array.\n\nHence, since n is read first, we can have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), temp(:)\n\nThen after reading n, allocate both:\n\nallocate(arr(n)), then allocate(temp(n))\n\nWait but maybe in a loop, better to have temp's allocation outside loops, to avoid repeated allocations inside loops which can be slow. Let's see.\n\nNot sure, but for the code, perhaps declaring temp as size n.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate(arr(n), temp(n))\n\nBut since in Fortran variables are declared before, maybe better to:\n\nAfter reading n:\n\n  allocate(arr(n), temp(n))\n\nThen, in each loop iteration, set temp = arr. \n\nWait, each time in the Java code's loops over i and j, we do a new copy of the original array (arr). So in Fortran, in each i,j loop:\n\ntemp = arr  ! copies the current arr into temp\n\nThen flip the elements between i and j.\n\nThen compute the count.\n\nWait, in Java, in the inner loops (i,j), the code does:\n\nbrr is a new copy each time, yes. In Fortran, same.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter the loops (i=1 to n; j =i to n)\n\ntemp = arr   ! this is to make a copy. \n\nthen loop over k from i to j:\n\n   if ( temp(k) ==0 ) then temp(k) =1 else temp(k)=0 end if\n\nthen count the number of 1's in temp. \n\nSo the count function is 'checKNo', which is a method in Java, returning the number of 1's. In Fortran, this can be a function. Let me note.\n\nSo to compute count = sum(temp(1:n) == 1 ? 1 : 0 ), but in Fortran terms.\n\nThe function 'checKNo' can be rewritten as a function:\n\ninteger function count_ones(brr, n)\n  integer, intent(in) :: brr(:)\n  integer, intent(in):: n\n  count_ones = 0\n  integer:: i\n  do i = 1, n\n    if (brr(i) ==1) then\n      count_ones = count_ones +1\n    end if\n  end do\nend function count_ones\n\nAlternatively, using intrinsic procedures. \n\nFortran has a count function:\n\ncount_ones = count( brr ==1 )\n\nYes, that's better. So the count can be trivially written as count(brr ==1).\n\nHence, replacing the helper function in Java with intrinsics.\n\nThat would simplify the code.\n\nHence, the count can be written inline as count(temp ==1), but to avoid inlining, maybe better write as a function to replicate the Java helper.\n\nAlternatively, in the loops, just compute the count.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\ncount = count( temp ==1 )\n\nSo, in the Java code, the function 'checKNo' is a simple count.\n\nThus in the loops, after flipping the array in temp:\n\ncount_val = count( temp ==1 )\n\nthen, if count_val > max_val, update max_val.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nInitialization:\n\nRead n, then read the array.\n\nInitialize max_val to a very low number. The equivalent of Integer.MIN_VALUE. In Fortran, but if integers are 4 bytes, the min is -2^31, so setting max_val = -huge(1) or -2147483647.\n\nWait the code in the initialization in Java is:\n\nint max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\nHence in Fortran, using 4-byte integers, that would be -2147483648. Because 2^31 is 2147483648, so to get the most negative, the code in Fortran can set max_val = -2147483648.\n\nAlternatively, using the intrinsic:\n\nmax_val = -huge(0)\n\nBecause in Fortran, huge returns the maximum value for the int, so -huge(0) would be the minimum negative. However, in some cases, huge(0) might depend on the kind. If compiling with INT32, then this is correct. Let's proceed with:\n\nmax_val = -2147483648\n\nThen:\n\nAfter all loops, if n ==1, then handle that case.\n\nWait the code's final part after loops:\n\nif (n ==1) then\n\n    if (arr(1) ==1) then print 0 (since flipping it makes it 0, so the maximum between 1 and 0 is 1? Wait in the original code, the decision is:\n\nWait for n=1, the code says:\n\nif (n ==1) { \n\n   if (arr[0] ==1) System.out.println(0); \n\n   else System.out.println(1); \n\n}\n\nWait, why? Because when n=1, the code's outer loops would have considered i and j from 0 to 0 (Java's 0-based). So flipping that element would give the count of 0 if original was 1, else 1. But the code in Java's loops took the maximum of all those subarrays. So in that case, flipping gives count of 0 or 1, but what is the max between the flipped counts and possibly the original?\n\nWait no\u2014the code for n=1 may not have considered the case of not flipping. The code requires flipping some subarray, but according to the problem description, maybe you have to flip (so the max could be min(flat count, ...). Hmm, but according to the code's logic, the original is not considered. So for n=1, the max is between the possible flipping (either 0 or 1). When n is 1:\n\nThe code's outer loops runs i=0 to 0 (Java's index 0), j from 0 to 0. So they flip the first element, so the resulting array's count is:\n\nif original was 1, then after flipping, 0 \u2192 the count is 0. \n\nIf it was 0 \u2192 after flip \u21921. \n\nThe code's max variable would capture that value. Because in the loop for n=1, the loop runs once, so temp after flipping is the flipped value, and to count it. Then the max will be 0 or 1, depending on the original. Then in the code, after the loops, when n is 1, the code 'if (n==1)' part forces the output to be 0 or 1 instead of the max stored, which I don't understand.\n\nWait this is conflicting: For n=1, according to the code:\n\nThe max after loops would be the result of flipping (so if original was 0: count is 1 \u2192 max becomes 1; if original was 1 \u2192 count is 0 \u2192 max becomes 0).\n\nBut in the code's special case, when n==1, the output is:\n\nif arr[0] is 1 \u2192 output 0, else 1.\n\nWait but that exactly matches the max from the loops. So why does this code have an exception for n==1? Because perhaps when n=1, in the code's loops runs once and hit the flip, setting max to that, but what if original array is better?\n\nWait perhaps not. The max is initialized to the minimum integer. The code's loops run once for n=1, thus flipping gives a count of 0 or 1. So for the case arr[0] is 1 (original count is 1, but flipping makes it 0. So the max would be 0. But then, the overall best is to not flip? Wait but in the problem's logic, flipping must occur. So in this case, the maximum count would indeed be 0 or 1, but the code's logic does that correctly. \n\nWait then why does the code have the exception for n ==1? \n\nWait in the code's code after the loops (not inside the n==1 case), it says:\n\nif (n ==1) { ... }\n\nelse { printf(max); }.\n\nSo the code is assuming that for n==1, the loops may have not captured the consideration that flipping is optional? But according to the problem, the flip is mandatory? Hence the code logic may be wrong for the problem's question. Alternatively, there's some mistake in the code. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that you can choose not to flip, then the maximum is the max between all possible flipting scenarios, and the original array? \n\nAh, yes! The code's loops consider only the flip options, but not the option of not flipping. Therefore, if the original array has more 1's than any possible flip can achieve, then the optimal answer is original array count. But in the code's loops, the max is initialized to MIN and the code is only taking the maximum over flipped versions. Thus, the code is wrong. \n\nIn the original problem, flipping a subarray is optional, meaning you can choose any subarray to flip, including zero elements (like flip a length zero), but in the code, it's forced to flip some subarray. So the code is wrong. \n\nHowever, given that the user provided this Java code, I just have to translate it. Therefore, the special n==1 case is necessary because if the code runs normally, when n is 1, the maximum would be either 0 or 1 after flipping. But, let's see:\n\nLet me consider the code for the n ==1 case:\n\nThe loops run only once (i=0, j=0). The flipped count is ( original arr[0] was 0 \u2192 count 1, so max =1. Original was 1 \u2192 count is 0. So max variable is set to that. \n\nThen, in the output part, the code does:\n\nif n is 1 then:\n\n   if arr[0] ==1 \u2192 print 0 (which is the max), else \u2192 print 1 (also max), so this is the same as just printing max. \n\nBut why have this code? Because maybe when n=1, their loops do not compute the correct max. Let me check:\n\nLet me see. For n=1:\n\nThe code first initializes max to Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is -2e9.\n\nThe loops iterate once, so the flipped value's count is 1 - arr[0]. \n\nWait if original arr[0] is 0 \u2192 flipped gives 1 \u2192 count is 1, which is larger than min, so max becomes 1.\n\nYes, so the max after processing is 1. So then in the code's output, the n==1 case says to check and print accordingly. But in that case, it is redundant since printing max would do the same. \n\nSo perhaps the code in the n==1 case is redundant. But perhaps in the original code, maybe when the code computes the original max, which indeed it does, but for n==1, why the special case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an error in their code.\n\nWait the problem says that you must choose a subarray to flip. So in that case, the maximum must indeed be chosen between all possible flips. Then for n=1, flipping gives the only available option, hence code is correct. \n\nIn this case, in the else clause, they can just print max. The code's part for n==1 is therefore not needed but wrote anyway. \n\nSo the code's output for n=1 is correct via the loops, but maybe in the code, to the user it was neccssary to handle n==1. \n\nBut why not remove that? Let me see:\n\nIf the code's loop is correct, then in n==1 the max would already hold the correct value (the flipped count, which is the only option). \n\nIn the code provided:\n\nAfter all the loops, it says :\n\nif (n ==1) {\n\n   if (original is 1 \u2192 output 0\n\n else \u2192 1\n\n} else {\n\n   system.out.println(max);\n\n}\n\nThus, for n==1, the code doesn't output 'max', but reevaluates. Which might mean the code is incorrect? \n\nAh! Oh! Because in the code's loops, it flips the subarray and the maximum is computed as the maximum after that flip. \n\nBut in the Java code, the 'arr' is the original array, but when they create a brr as a copy, the original array is never considered. \n\nWait the problem requires that you can choose whether to flip some subarray, but in the code's approach, it only considers flipping subarrays and the maximum of all those (which would include flipping a zero-length subarray, which perhaps the code does not). \n\nWait in the code, the i and j can be from 0 to n-1. But for j >=i, including when i=j. So for flipping a subarray that includes all the array, but how is the option of not flipping? \n\nWait to not flip anything, you'd have to not flip any elements. To do that, you can choose a subarray of length zero (like, indexes i >j, but the loops require j >=i). Hence, the code's approach doesn't account for that, so the original array's count is never considered. \n\nHence the code is wrong. \n\nIn the problem statement, if the user needs to choose any subarray (could be none?), then the original array's count should be considered. \n\nBut given that the code is provided and the user wants translation, without fixing the problem, perhaps the code is correct according to its own logic. \n\nAssuming that according to the code, for the n==1 case, after the loops the max is set to the flipped count (the only possibility), so they can just output 'max' after the loops. But why handle it specially?\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the code where when n is 1, and the original array's count is 1, the code's loops give max=0 (but the original count is better). But to choose the maximum between flipping and not flipping, but the code doesn't do that. Hence the developer added the n==1 special case. \n\nWait to prevent this error the 'n==1' case, perhaps with some mistake. Let's think:\n\nSuppose n=1, original value is 1 (the coin is head?), then flipping it gives tail (count 0). The maximum is 0 (from the flipped subarray). But the coin's original is also 1 (count 1) option. But the problem requires that you flip a subarray. So the best is 0 (since flipping is mandatory).\n\nSo the code's resulting max is correct. Thus the 'n==1' case is not needed. \n\nHmm. So maybe the code in the user's code has an unnecessary part. But according to the given code I have to translate it as is. \n\nThus: \n\nIn the Fortran code, after the loops, there is a check. So including the 'if (n == 1)' part. \n\nThus, now proceeding to code.\n\nPutting all together in Fortran:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nThe code must have:\n\nProgram with variable declarations, read n, arr, then loops. \n\nHere's the structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_327_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n,i,j,k, max_val, count_val\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), temp(:)\n  \n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  if (n == 0) then  ! Edge case, maybe not?\n    print *, \"0\"\n    stop\n  end if\n  allocate(arr(n))\n  read(*,*) (arr(i), i=1,n)\n  \n  ! Initialize max to a negative\n  max_val = -2147483648  ! Integer.MIN_VALUE equivalent.\n  \n  allocate(temp(n))\n  \n  ! Outer loops over i and j\n  do i =1, n\n     do j =i, n\n        ! Make a copy of arr\n        temp = arr\n        ! flip the subarray i..j\n        do k =i, j\n           if (temp(k) ==0) then\n              temp(k) = 1\n           else\n              temp(k) =0\n           end if\n        end do\n        count_val = count(temp ==1)\n        ! Update max\n        if (count_val > max_val) then\n           max_val = count_val\n        end if\n     end do\n  end do\n \n  ! Handle n==1 case\n  if (n ==1) then\n     if (arr(1) ==1 ) then\n        print *,0\n     else\n        print *,1\n     end if\n  else\n     print *, max_val\n  end if\n  \n  deallocate(arr, temp)\n  \nend program codeforces_327_A\n\nWait but some checks: In Fortran, the 'temp' array is allocated only once, before the loops. So inside each loop, we need to reset it to the original array. Assigning 'temp = arr' will overwrite temp's previous values, so that's okay. \n\nThe loops will multiply: for each i and j, temp is set, modified, then the count is done. \n\nThe count uses the COUNT intrinsic function on the array where temp is 1. \n\nNow, test case for n=1 when Arr(1)=1?\n\nThen the loop:\n\ni=1 to1 and j from1 to1.\n\nloop runs once:\n\ntemp = arr \u2192 temp(1) =1 \n\nthen flip temp(1): becomes 0. \n\nSo count_val =0 \u2192 max_val is initially -2e9 \u2192 becomes 0.\n\nThen after loops, n==1: so the code checks the current value of arr(1). If it's 1, then output 0 \u2192 which matches, since max_val is 0, so else case would do it. But the code goes to the if (n==1) block and outputs 0. So it's the same.\n\nFor the case Arr(1)=0 \u2192 the count after flipping is 1 \u2192 max_val =1, so the special case outputs 1. So it works.\n\nSo yes, it behaves the same as Java code.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput \"2 0 0\" \u2192 \n\nThen all possible subarrays:\n\nsubarrays are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nFor each:\n\nFlipping (1,1):\n\ntemp becomes [1, 0] \u2192 count is 1.\n\nFlipping (1,2): both become 1 \u2192 count 2 \u2192 max_val2.\n\nFlipping (2,2): becomes [0,1] count 1. \n\nThus max_val is2 \u2192 the output is 2. In Fortran's code, it will not enter the n==1 block, so output 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nHence, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the code above, I assumed that the array starts at 1. Also, the 'temp' is allocated once before loops, which may save memory and computations. \n\nNow, in the code above, after loops, it's possible that the code could have a mistake in array indices. Let me ensure:\n\nYes, the loops are in 1..n indices, and the flipping is done correctly. Also the count is computed properly.\n\nI also need to ensure that in Fortran, arrays arr and temp are of the correct size, but since we read n first and allocate arr(n), that's okay.\n\nTesting another edge case where n=1 array with 0.\n\nJava code would have output 1, Fortran code after loops max_val is1, and the n==1 case would print1.\n\nHence, it's same.\n\nNow, correct the function 'count(temp==1)' is equivalent to Java's method.\n\nYes, because the count returns the number of elements equal to 1.\n\nThus the code should work."
