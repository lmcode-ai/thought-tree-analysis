    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's go through the code step by step. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads n integers, counts the frequency of each, and then finds the maximum frequency and the number of unique values. Finally, it prints the concatenation of max and the count of unique elements.\n\nFortran doesn't have a direct equivalent to Java's HashMap. Hmm, so maybe I can use arrays or a derived type with counters. Since the values can be any integer, but in practice, perhaps the input has a limited range, but the code might not know that. Alternatively, since the problem might be about the actual values, but since we just need counts per value, I can use a hash-like approach with a list of key-value pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe tracking the counts by storing each unique number and their count. Since Fortran arrays are fixed in size, perhaps using a derived type array where each element holds a value and its count, dynamically adding when new values are found. Wait, but Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays or hash maps. So maybe we can collect all the values in an array, then sort them, then count the frequencies.\n\nThat's probably a better approach for Fortran. Let's think:\n\n1. Read n, then read n integers. Store them in an array.\n\n2. Sort that array so duplicates are adjacent.\n\n3. Iterate through sorted array to count frequency of each unique value.\n\n4. Find the maximum frequency and the number of unique elements (which would be the number of groups after sorting and grouping).\n\nSo this approach can be done with arrays in Fortran. Let me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read an array of n integers.\n\nThen, sort the array.\n\nInitialize variables: unique count, current value, current count, max count.\n\nStart with the first element. Current count = 1. Then for each next element:\n\nif equal to current value: increment current count.\n\nelse:\n\ncompare current count to max to update if necessary.\n\nThen, unique count increases by 1, then set current value to the new one, set current count to 1.\n\nAt the end, after the loop, have to do one last comparison with max, because the last group wasn't considered after the loop ends.\n\nThen the max would be the maximum between the last count and previous max.\n\nAlternatively, maybe track max during iteration.\n\nWait, need to plan that properly.\n\nAlternatively, after sorting, go through all elements, track the current value and count. Each time the value changes, record the count, increment the unique count, and reset count. Then after processing all elements, check again if current count is higher than previous max.\n\nThis way, storing all the counts in an array might not be necessary except for tracking the max and the count. \n\nLet's see the steps:\n\nStep by step in Fortran:\n\n- The main program should read n.\n\nWait here's the plan:\n\nDeclare an array of size n. Read the input into this array.\n\nSort the array in ascending order.\n\nInitialize variables:\n\ninteger :: max_freq = 0, unique = 0, current_val, current_count\n\nStart processing elements:\n\nset current_val to the first element, current_count=1. \n\nThen loop from the second element to the end:\n\nfor i in 2 to n:\n\n    if arr(i) == arr(i-1):\n\n        current_count +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        compare current_count with max_freq. if current_count > max_freq then max_freq=current_count\n\n        unique = unique +1\n\n        current_val= arr(i)\n\n        current_count=1\n\n    end if\n\nnext\n\nAfter loop ends, need to account for the last group:\n\nunique +=1\n\ncompare current_count with max_freq again to see if it's a new maximum.\n\nOnce that's done, then the unique count is correct (since it's the number of groups).\n\nWait but in the loop after a change, when a new element comes, after the 'else', the current_count is 1 for the new element.\n\nWait for example, in the first elements:\n\nSuppose the array is [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5]. \n\nAfter first element (3), current_count=1. \n\nSecond element also 3: count increases to 2, etc. When next element is 2:\n\nThen, in the else clause:\n\ncompare current_count (3) with max (initial 0) \u2192 becomes 3. unique becomes 1.\n\nSet current_val=2, count=1. However, the next elements 2 and then 5:\n\nFor third element (the second 2):\n\nLoop continues, next 2 is equal, count becomes 2.\n\nThen compare when moving to 5: then 2 vs max (3) \u2192 no change. Then unique increases to 2, and current val set to 5, count 1.\n\nAfter finishing all elements, the last group (5) hasn't been considered. So after loop, do:\n\nif current_count > max_freq \u2192 then set it.\n\nAlso, the unique count needs to be incremented when the previous (before the loop) groups ended, but let's see.\n\nWait initial unique is zero. Wait let's say the first element is processed with current_val and count=1. \n\nIn the loop:\n\nstarting from i=2:\n\nfor the first i (element 2, which is a 3), arr(2) == arr(1), so same, skip else. \n\nWait let me code it step by step.\n\nWait, the first step after initialization (current_val is arr(1), current_count=1, unique=0. )\n\nThen for i from 2 to n do:\n\ncurrent element is arr(i). Compare with previous element (which is arr(i-1)).\n\nSo if arr(i) == arr(i-1):\n\ncurrent_count +=1\n\nElse:\n\nWe've finished a group. The previous group's count is current_count (the count up to i-1), so that must be compared to max.\n\nSo, max_freq = maximum between max_freq and current_count.\n\nThen unique +=1\n\nThen reset current_val to arr(i), and current_count=1.\n\nProceed.\n\nWait but the first time, after the first element, when the loop starts at i=2, the first group (the first element's value) might be ending before i=2? Wait not exactly.\n\nWait in the first iteration, when i=2, if it's the same as previous (arr(1)), then same group.\n\nAlternatively, the first element initial variables are current_val=arr(1), current_count=1.\n\nEach time that the current element is different from previous:\n\nthen, the current group (before the else) ended at previous element. So before incrementing current_count, we have to process the previous group.\n\nWait I think the logic works. After looping through all elements, upon exiting the loop, the current_count of the last group is still in current_count, so after the loop, you need to compare against max_freq and also increment the unique count by 1, since that last group hasn't been counted yet.\n\nYes. Because in the loop when we hit a different element, we process the previous group, but the new group's count is started at 1. But when we get to the end, the last group hasn't been accounted for in the unique count or its count in max. Thus after the loop, we have to:\n\nUnique is initially 0.\n\nWait let's trace the example:\n\nExample: [3, 3, 2].\n\nInitial variables:\n\ncurrent_val = 3, current_count=1. unique is 0.\n\nLoop on i=2 (3):\n\nSame as previous \u2192 count becomes 2. (max remains 0?)\n\nWait that's not correct. Max could be wrong?\n\nWait in the loop's else clause, when a new group starts (except the first one), we compare the old count (which was the current_count before the else), so when a new group is detected, then the old group's count is compared to max.\n\nWait the first element's initial variables: starting with current_count=1, then in the first iteration (i=2), since same, count is 2. \n\nSecond element (i=3 is 2):\n\nHere, new group, so in the else clause, we do:\n\nmax_freq is 2 (the previous count) which is bigger than initial 0 \u2192 now max is 2.\n\nunique becomes 1 (from 0), then current_val is set to 2, count=1.\n\nLoop ends. Then, after the loop, the last group (2 with count 1) hasn't been processed in the max and its unique hasn't been counted.\n\nThus, after loop, the unique count needs to be incremented by 1 (the final current group is not yet accounted for) and the current_count (1) must be considered for max.\n\nSo after the loop:\n\nunique = unique + 1 \u2192 in this case, after the loop it was 1, now 2.\n\nThen, max_freq is the maximum between current max (2) and current_count (1). Still 2.\n\nThus overall unique is 2, max 2 \u2192 then the output would be max (2) and unique (2). Concatenate as 22. Wait code says \"max + \"\" + map.size()\" which in this case max is 2 and map.size is 2 \u2192 so yes. \n\nThus the logic of adding the last group's count after the loop is essential.\n\nThus the steps are:\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_val = arr(1)\n\ncurrent_count = 1\n\nunique = 0\n\nmax_freq = 0\n\nThen loop over i from 2 to n:\n\n   if arr(i) == arr(i-1):\n\n       current_count +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       if current_count > max_freq:\n\n           max_freq = current_count\n\n       unique += 1\n\n       current_val = arr(i)\n\n       current_count = 1\n\n   end if\n\nNext\n\nAfter loop:\n\ncomplete the final group.\n\nunique +=1 \n\nif current_count > max_freq then max_freq = current_count\n\nThen, output max_freq // unique \u2192 so like, in the example, 2 and 2 \u2192 output 22.\n\nWait but in Fortran, printing two numbers concatenated would be, for example, writing them as a string, but in Fortran, you can concatenate numbers by converting to strings.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the output is the maximum frequency (as integer) multiplied by 1 as a string and then the count of unique? No, no. Wait the code in Java is System.out.println( max + \"\" + map.size() ). Which is effectively converting max and the size to strings and concatenating them. For example, max is 5 and size 3 \u2192 then \"53\".\n\nSo in Fortran, the output is the integer max followed by the integer unique count, with no space between them, as a single number, treated as a concatenated string. So for example max is 5, unique 3, it should print \"53\".\n\nSo in Fortran, we can write:\n\nprint *, trim(adjustl( max_freq ) ) // trim(adjustl( unique_count ) )\n\nWait but in Fortran integer to string conversion can be done with edit descriptors, perhaps by using write statements with edit descriptors.\n\nAlternatively, use internal writes to convert numbers to strings, then concatenate them.\n\nHmm, the approach would be to:\n\nLet me see. Let me structure the code.\n\nFirst, the program:\n\nThe user needs to read n, then n integers, store in array. Then sort them, then process as above.\n\nFirst, Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_37a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\ninteger :: current_val, current_count, max_freq = 0, unique = 0\n\n! Read n:\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate ( arr(n) )\n\n! Read the array:\n\nread *, arr\n\ncall quicksort( arr, 1, n ) ! Need to implement sorting.\n\ncurrent_val = arr(1)\n\ncurrent_count = 1\n\nunique =0\n\nmax_freq =0\n\n! Loop from 2 to n:\n\ndo i=2, n\n\n    if ( arr(i) == arr(i-1) ) then\n\n        current_count = current_count +1 \n\n    else \n\n        ! End of previous group.\n\n        if ( current_count > max_freq ) then\n\n            max_freq = current_count\n\n        end if\n\n        unique = unique +1 \n\n        current_val=arr(i)\n\n        current_count =1 \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\n! process the last group \n\nunique = unique + 1 \n\nif ( current_count > max_freq ) then \n\n   max_freq = current_count \n\nend if \n\n! Now, output:\n\nprint *, max_freq, unique ! no, Need to concatenate. \n\nWait so the printed output should be the concatenation of the two numbers. \n\nFor example, if max is 3 and unique is 5 \u2192 \"35\".\n\nIn Fortran, this requires writing as a string. One way is to write to a character variable.\n\nfor that, can do:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: out_str\n\nwrite(out_str, '(i0,i0)') max_freq, unique\n\nprint *, trim(adjustl(out_str))\n\nAlternatively, we can use print *, trim(adjustl( str1 )) // trim(adjustl( str2 )) after converting each number to strings.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s1, s2\n\nwrite(s1,*) max_freq \n\nwrite(s2,*) unique \n\ns1 = adjustl(s1)\n\ns2 = adjustl(s2)\n\nprint *, s1//s2\n\nHmm, that's possible. Let me structure all that.\n\nAlternatively, using internally:\n\nprint '(i0,i0)', max_freq, unique\n\nWait how does that work?\n\nThe 'i0' format specifier writes the number without leading spaces, with minimum digits required, so it should write both numbers concatenated properly. \n\nWait let me check: \n\nif max_freq=12, unique= 3 \u2192 the format (i0,i0) would output '123' ?\n\nTesting in mind, the first output is 12, then the second 3, so concatenated yes. So the edit descriptor '(i0, i0)' would print them together. \n\nYes, because each I0 consumes the number and writes in minimal space.\n\nTherefore the print statement could be:\n\nprint '(i0, i0)', max_freq, unique\n\nAlternatively, a free-form write:\n\nprint *, max_freq, unique \n\nbut that would separate them with a space, but the problem requires concatenation without spaces.\n\nSo the format is essential here. Either use a format like '(i0,i0)' or '(a,a)' after converting each number.\n\nThus using the edit descriptors is simplest.\n\nNow, the sorting is required. \n\nFortran's intrinsic array sort is available since F90 with the function merge, but perhaps we can use the sort routine from the library. Alternatively, I can write a quicksort function, or use the intrinsic.\n\nWait, the statement is: \n\ncall sort(arr)\n\nUnfortunately, the intrinsic function is 'sort' ? I think in Fortran 90, you can sort arrays with:\n\ncall Mergesort(arr), but perhaps need to specify which method.\n\nAlternatively, to be portable, better to implement a sort function.\n\nWait for code submission, probably need to include sorting code, because some compilers might not support built-in functions.\n\nAlternatively, the simplest way here, since we can assume n is not too big (since problem likely from Codeforces 37A problem, which requires reading a small array, like up to 1e5?), but in Fortran code for that, perhaps use a bubble sort? No, perhaps better to use a quicksort.\n\nHmm, perhaps allowing the use of the built-in function in a way.\n\nAlternatively, use the intrinsic sort which is available in many F95+ compilers.\n\nWait in Fortran 90 you can use the built-in sort:\n\ncall merge_sort(arr) or something.\n\nWait no. Wait:\n\nWait, in Fortran the correct way to sort an array is to use the \"sort\" intrinsic:\n\ninteger :: arr(10)\n\ncall sort(arr)\n\nWait the standard sort would have to be done with the generic procedure. Since F2003 introduced the 'sort' intrinsic.\n\nWait, I'm a bit unsure.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps use the Fortran90 way: by using the 'INSTALL' method? Or perhaps it's better to just write a simple sorting routine.\n\nLet me think:\n\nImplement a Bubble Sort for simplicity even if less efficient. But for code submission, perhaps the array size isn't too big.\n\nWait but since codeforces problem 37A: let me check problem 37A.\n\nWait actually, problem 37A was a problem about voting for favorite number. So the input can be up to 1e5 numbers? Not sure, but even then Bubble sort would be O(n^2) which for n=1e5 is a problem. Thus better to implement Quicksort.\n\nHmm. Implementing Quicksort in Fortran. Alternatively, using the built-in sort. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively in Fortran95, you can sort by using the following:\n\ncall sort(arr)\n\nBut according to the standard, the subroutine sort is available in ISO_C_BINDING, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait I'm a bit confused about standard functions. Let me check:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should use a Qsort-like function, but in Fortran, that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the code can sort the array using a simple loop with the built-in sort:\n\narray = sort(array([, ]))\n\nWait, looking it up quickly, some sources mention that the intrinsic SORT is actually a module procedure from the ISO module? Wait perhaps that is available in gfortran. Let's assume that for the problem, the code can sort the array using the intrinsic.\n\nWait here's the way in Fortran:\n\nTo sort an array in ascending order, the line would be:\n\ncall sort( arr )\n\nBut the exact syntax may vary. However, perhaps for code compatibility, it's better to implement a sort function.\n\nHmm. Let me look up the Fortran 90 intrinsic for sorting.\n\nHmm, the sort function is actually part of the ISO Fortran environment? Wait here's an option: according to some references, the sort is available via the intrinsic function.\n\nWait the function is called 'sort' and requires the array. The syntax would be:\n\ncall sort(arr, 1, n)\n\nWait no. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, here's a sample code for using the Fortran built-in sort function:\n\nprogram test_sort\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, dimension(5) :: a = [3,1,4,1,5]\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nprint *, a\n\nend program test_sort\n\nThis should sort the array, but does this work?\n\nTesting with gfortran: I think in gfortran 8.x, this is available, but perhaps under a different name.\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran 2018, the subroutine 'sort' is part of the ISO standard, but perhaps in practice, the code may need to use the intrinsic properly.\n\nAlternatively, the code could use:\n\narray = merge( [array], [array] ) ?\n\nNo, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the array can be sorted using a do loop with selection sort if the problem constraints are small.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the problem statement for the original code, in the original problem, let's recall that problem codeforces 37A 'Inna and Physics Contradictions' requires to calculate the maximum frequency and the number of distinct numbers, which could be done with O(n) space and no sorting (using a frequency map). However in Fortran without a hashmap, resorting to sorting is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even with hash in Fortran: since as of Fortran 2003, there is a hash_table module in some implementations, but probably not portable.\n\nThus, the easiest way is to sort the array, so assuming that the code can implement a sort function.\n\nLet's proceed to write a Quicksort.\n\nImplementing quicksort in Fortran:\n\nI can write a recursive function to sort the array between indices. \n\nHere's an outline for the Quicksort routine:\n\nrecursive subroutine qsort( a, first, last )\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: first, last\n\n    integer :: pivot, i, j, temp\n\n    if( first >= last ) return\n\n    pivot = a( (first+last)/2 )\n\n    i=first\n\n    j=last\n\n    do\n\n        do while( a(i) < pivot )\n\n            i = i +1 \n\n        end do \n\n        do while( a(j) > pivot )\n\n            j = j -1 \n\n        end do \n\n        if (i <=j ) then \n\n            temp = a(i)\n\n            a(i) = a(j)\n\n            a(j) = temp \n\n            i = i +1 \n\n            j = j -1 \n\n        else \n\n            exit \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    call qsort( a, first, j )\n\n    call qsort( a, i, last )\n\nend subroutine qsort\n\nThen, in the main program, the sort is called with:\n\ncall qsort(arr, 1, n)\n\nThus this would work.\n\nOkay, putting it all together:\n\nSo the Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_37a\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\n    integer :: current_val, current_count, max_freq, unique\n\n    read *, n \n\n    allocate( arr(n) )\n\n    read *, arr \n\n    call qsort(arr, 1, n)  ! Assuming qsort is declared\n\n    if (n ==0 ) then \n\n        print *, 0 0 \n\n        stop \n\n    end if \n\n    current_val = arr(1)\n\n    current_count =1 \n\n    max_freq =0 \n\n    unique =0 \n\n    do i=2, n \n\n        if ( arr(i) == arr(i-1) ) then \n\n            current_count = current_count +1 \n\n        else \n\n            if( current_count > max_freq ) then \n\n                max_freq = current_count \n\n            end if \n\n            unique = unique +1 \n\n            current_val = arr(i)\n\n            current_count =1 \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    unique = unique +1 \n\n    if ( current_count > max_freq ) then \n\n        max_freq = current_count \n\n    end if \n\n    print '(i0,i0)', max_freq, unique \n\ncontains \n\n    recursive subroutine qsort( a, first, last )\n\n        implicit none\n\n        integer, intent(inout) :: a(:)\n\n        integer, intent(in) :: first, last \n\n        integer :: pivot, i_temp, j_temp, temp \n\n        if( first >= last ) return \n\n        pivot = a( (first + last)/2 )\n\n        i_temp = first \n\n        j_temp = last \n\n        do \n\n            do while ( a(i_temp) < pivot )\n\n                i_temp = i_temp +1 \n\n            end do \n\n            do while ( a(j_temp) > pivot )\n\n                j_temp = j_temp -1 \n\n            end do \n\n            if( i_temp <= j_temp ) then \n\n                temp = a(i_temp)\n\n                a(i_temp) = a(j_temp)\n\n                a(j_temp) = temp \n\n                i_temp = i_temp +1 \n\n                j_temp = j_temp -1 \n\n            else \n\n                exit \n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n        call qsort(a, first, j_temp )\n\n        call qsort(a, i_temp, last )\n\n    end subroutine qsort \n\nend program codeforces_37a \n\nWait, I should check the initialization steps. Let me step through variables:\n\nInitially:\n\ncurrent_count is set to 1 for the first element. \n\nmax_freq is initialized to zero. \n\nAt the end of the loop after processing all elements, before the do...end do loop, after the loop, the code does:\n\nunique is incremented by 1 because the last group hasn't been counted yet. Because each time a new group starts (except first), the previous group's count is added to unique.\n\nWait when the loop ends, the last iteration handled the previous element. But the group that ends with the last element hasn't been accounted for.\n\nFor example, when processing the i= 2 to n elements, every time a new element is a different group the previous group is counted, but the last group only is added when a new group starts, which doesn't happen after the last element. Thus, the final increment of unique ensures that the last group is counted.\n\nThen, the current_count of the last group is considered for max_freq. \n\nThus the code should work correctly.\n\nEdge cases to check:\n\nTest case 1: n=1.\n\nInput: 1 followed by [5]\n\nAfter sorting, arr is [5]\n\nThe loop doesn't execute (since i runs from 2 to 1).\n\nHence, current_count=1, unique is 0.\n\nAfter loop, unique +=1 \u2192 unique=1, current_count is 1. So max_freq is max(0,1) \u2192 1.\n\nThus, output is 11 \u2192 which is correct (max frequency 1, unique 1).\n\nAnother test case: n=0?\n\nWait according to the problem, n is read from input, probably n is positive. But in code, if n is zero, the read would fail, but assuming the problem's constraints prevent n=0. So the code could have that edge check but maybe it's unnecessary.\n\nAnother test case: All elements same.\n\nn=3, elements 2,2,2.\n\nsorted array remains same.\n\nIn code:\n\ncurrent_count starts at 1.\n\ni=2: check same \u2192 current_count becomes 2 \u2192 loop proceeds.\n\ni=3: same, current_count becomes 3.\n\nloop ends.\n\nNow after loop, unique is 0 (since no else clause was executed). Adding 1 gives unique 1.\n\nmax_freq is compared with current_count 3 \u2192 becomes 3.\n\nSo output is 31 \u2192 since 3 (max) followed by 1 (number of unique groups). \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: elements in increasing order with all unique. Like 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nn=5.\n\nsorted array is same. \n\nLoop runs from 2 to5.\n\nAt each step (i=2) initial variables:\n\ncurrent_val=1, count=1.\n\nFor i=2 (element 2):\n\nnot same as previous:\n\nso:\n\nprevious count is 1, compared to max (0) \u2192 max becomes 1.\n\nunique becomes 1.\n\ncurrent_val sets to 2, count 1.\n\nThen next step i=3 (3), compared to previous (2):\n\nso again else clause:\n\ncurrent_count (1) is compared to previous max (1 \u2192 equal, so no change).\n\nunique becomes 2, etc.\n\nAfter all iterations, each element triggers an else clause, so for 5 elements, there are 4 'else's, each time increasing the unique by 1, so unique before loop end is 4 (for each of the 4 times new groups started). After the loop adds one, so unique=5.\n\nMax_freq is 1 (since all groups have count 1).\n\nThus output 1 followed by 5 \u2192 15.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code looks correct.\n\nThe only thing I need to make sure is that the function qsort is correctly placed. Since it's 'contained' in the main program via the 'contains' statement. \n\nI think this should work.\n\nThus the translation is correct."
