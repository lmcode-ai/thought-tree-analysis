    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe program reads an integer num, which is the size of a square grid. Then it reads num strings, each of length num, storing them in an ArrayList. Then it calculates a 'fine' which is the sum of combinations of 'C's in each row and each column. The formula used is n*(n-1)/2 for each row and column where n is the count of 'C's.\n\nHmm. So in Fortran, how to approach this? Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, reading input. The Java code uses a Scanner. In Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements. Since the input is a grid of characters, perhaps we can read each line as a string and store it in a 2D array.\n\nWait, Fortran arrays are declared with dimensions. The grid is num x num. So declare a 2D character array of size num x num.\n\nThe next part is processing each column and row. The Java code loops over each column index, then for each row, checks the character at that column. Then calculates the combination for each column. Similarly for rows.\n\nWait, let's look at the loops again. In the first loop over columns (i is the column index):\n\nFor each column i, it counts how many 'C's are in that column (by looping through rows k), then adds the combination to the fine. Then reset counter.\n\nThen the same for rows: for each row i, count the Cs in that row, compute combination, add to fine.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe'll need to:\n\n1. Read the size 'num'.\n2. Read 'num' lines, each of 'num' characters, storing into a 2D array.\n3. Initialize counters and fine.\n4. First loop over columns:\n   For each column index (from 1 to num in Fortran, since indices start at 1 unless specified):\n      count how many 'C's are in that column (loop over rows)\n      compute combination and add to fine\n      reset count.\n5. Then loop over rows (each row index from 1 to num):\n      count the Cs in row i\n      same formula\n      add to fine\n6. Print the fine.\n\nNow, some details. Fortran uses 1-based indices by default, so the loops should start at 1. The input strings in Java are read via sc.next(), but in Fortran, perhaps we can read each line into a character array of length num.\n\nWait, the strings are each of length num, as per the problem's constraints presumably. So when reading each line, the length is exact.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a string of length n, we can declare a character array of length n. Alternatively, read each line as a string, and then copy to the 2D array.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the inner loops for column processing loop from 0 to num-1 (k from 0 to num-1), since it's using ArrayList indices. So in Fortran, the loops will be from 1 to num, so that's straightforward with adjustments.\n\nLet me start drafting the code.\n\nFirst, declare variables.\n\nWe need an integer for num, fine, and counters. The character array. Let's see:\n\ninteger:: num, i, j, counter, fine\ncharacter(len=num) :: arr(num)\n\nWait, can I have a 2D array? Or perhaps a 1D array of strings each of length num. Wait, because in Fortran, a 2D character array might be a bit more complex. Alternatively, each row is a string, so maybe easier to have arr(1:num) as strings of length num. So that would work. So:\n\ncharacter(len=num) :: arr(num)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can't declare a character array with length depending on a variable unless you use a PARAMETER, but here num is read at runtime. Oh right, this is a problem. Because in Fortran, the declaration must know the length at compile time, unless you are using a variable-length string. Wait, but in Fortran 90+, you can have character arrays with a length specified by a variable if it's a variable declared with PARAMETER. But here, num is input, so it's a runtime variable. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can read each line as a string, store in a 1D array of characters. Wait, maybe better to read the entire 2D array as a 2D array of characters.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: when reading each line, read each character individually.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is:\n\nRead the number N first, then read N lines, each with N characters, and store them in a 2D array.\n\nBut in Fortran, for variable length arrays. So maybe using allocatable arrays.\n\nFirst, code outline:\n\nRead num.\n\nAllocate a 2D array (size num x num).\n\nThen read num lines, each with num characters.\n\nvariable:\n\ninteger:: num\ninteger:: i,j, counter, fine =0\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: grid\n\n...\n\nAllocate(grid(num, num))\n\nThen read each row as a string of length num, and then read each character?\n\nAlternatively, to read the characters, you can read the entire line:\n\ndo i = 1, num\n    read(*,'(A)') line\n    do j = 1, num\n        grid(i,j) = line(j:j)\n    end do\nend do\n\nThis way, the line is a temporary character variable of length num. So for this, we need to have a temporary line of length num, but how?\n\nWait, for the input line, for line length of exactly num characters, read them all as a string, then loop over each character.\n\nSo here's how to structure this part:\n\ndeclare a character variable line to hold each line. Since num can be variable, we need to make line a suitable length. But in Fortran, variables sized to a variable length can be tricky. Alternatively, assuming that the input lines have exactly num characters with no whitespace, perhaps we can read each line as a string of length num. To handle that:\n\nAt runtime, the program can first read num, then declare a line variable of length num. Wait, but in Fortran, variables declared inside the code can't have lengths dependent on variables read later, unless using ALLOCATABLE.\n\nAh right. So declare line as a character array ALLOCATABLE:\n\nallocate(line(num))\n\nBut then after reading num, do the allocation:\n\nAfter reading num:\n\nallocate( line(num) )\n\nThen:\n\ndo i =1 to num:\n\nread the line into line variable, then loop over j to set grid(i,j) = line(j:j)\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nYes:\n\nprogram codeforces_629_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: num, i, j, counter, fine = 0\n    character(len=1), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: grid\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: line\n\n    read(*,*) num\n\n    allocate( grid(num, num) )\n    allocate( line(num) )\n\n    do i = 1, num\n        read(*, '(A)') line\n        do j = 1, num\n            grid(i,j) = line(j:j)\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! Process the grid\n    ! First process columns (j is column index)\n    do j = 1, num\n        counter = 0\n        do i = 1, num\n            if (grid(i,j) == 'C') then\n                counter = counter + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\n    end do\n\n    ! Now process rows (i is row index)\n    do i = 1, num\n        counter = 0\n        do j = 1, num\n            if (grid(i,j) == 'C') then\n                counter = counter + 1\n            end if\n        end do\n        fine = fine + (counter * (counter -1)) / 2\n    end do\n\n    print*, fine \n\n    deallocate(grid)\n    deallocate(line)\nend program codeforces_629_A\n\nHmm, that's the structure. Wait, let's check the loops:\n\nThe first loop over columns comes first. For each column j, loop over rows i (row 1 to num), count the C's in that column. Then compute combination. So the first part of the code is correct.\n\nThen the same for the rows: for each row i, loop columns j from1 to num, count Cs in that row, then add to fine.\n\nThis seems right.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n1. The line reading: Using '(A)' format to read a string up to the end of line. But if there is trailing whitespace, but the problem states that each line is exactly num characters. So assuming that the input is correct.\n\n2. Character comparison: 'C' is uppercase. So in Fortran, 'C' is correct.\n\nAnother point: In Fortran, integer division: the expression (counter * (counter-1))/2. Since in Fortran, if counter is integer, then this is an integer division, which is correct as the expression is always even (since for two C's, it's 2C2, etc.)\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nIf a row has exactly 2 Cs, adds 1. So code should handle that.\n\nAnother thing: variables: the variables need to be declared properly. I've declared them as integers. Fine starts at 0.\n\nThe variables line and grid are allocatable and must be deallocated at the end.\n\nWait, in the code above, after deallocating grid and line?\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: Since Fortran's default integer is 4-byte, but if the problem requires larger numbers, but the constraints are small (since it's Codeforces problem, probably okay).\n\nNow, check the code again for syntax.\n\nWait, in the first loop over columns, it's j loop for the columns (from 1 to num). Then for each column, looping over the rows i (1 to num). The code is correct.\n\nYes. So I think this should work. Let me write the final code."
