Wait the code's continue condition is when (busDeparture >= simArrival OR simDeparture >= busArrival \u2192.\n\nIf bus departs at 300 \u2192 time is same as sim departure. Then first part (bus dep >= sim arrival \u2192 sim arrival is 300+ tA, so if the bus is departing at 300, this is true only if tA is zero, but tA is given as part of input. Wait in the previous example, tA is 5, so sim arrives at 305.\n\nbus departs at 300, so busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 300 <305 \u2192 false. So the first part of condition is false. Second part: simDeparture (300) >= busArrival (300 + tB \u2192 for the example with tB=2 \u2192 302 \u2192 300 <302, so the second condition (simDepart >= bus arrival?) \u2192 300 >=302 \u2192 no.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me read through the Java code first to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe Java code is for a problem where we have two types of transportation: a simulation and a bus. The goal is to count how many buses depart after the simulation's departure time but before its arrival time.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads input from standard input. The first line has two integers a and tA, the second line has b and tB. Then a time in \"HH:MM\" format is read, which is the simulation's departure time. They convert this time into minutes since midnight as simDeparture, and compute the arrival time as simDeparture + tA.\n\nThen, they loop over possible bus departures. The buses depart every b minutes starting from 300 (5 AM, since 5*60=300). The loop runs from 300 up to 1440 (which is 24*60, representing the next day's midnight). For each bus departure time i:\n\n- The bus departure is i, arrival is i + tB.\n- They check if the bus is either departing after the sim has arrived (busDeparture >= simArrival) or if the sim departed after the bus arrives (simDeparture >= busArrival). If either is true, the bus doesn't count.\n- If not, increment the counter.\n\nFinally, output the counter.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the input. Java uses BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. In Fortran, we can read from the standard input using read(*,*) statements, and parse strings using functions.\n\nThe first two lines of input: the first line has a and tA, the second line has b and tB. So in Fortran:\n\nRead the first line as two integers. Then the second line as two integers again. Let's declare variables for a, tA, b, tB.\n\nThen the timing is read as a string, which is in \"HH:MM\" format. To split this into hours and minutes, in Fortran, perhaps read into a character variable, then parse the substring. Let's see: the string would be like \"05:30\", so the first two characters are hours (chars 1:2), and the next two (after the colon) are minutes (chars 4:5?\n\nWait, the timing is like \"HH:MM\", so the third character is the colon. Therefore, the hours are characters 1-2, and minutes are 4-5. So in Fortran, we can do something like:\n\nRead the time string, then:\n\nRead the first two characters as hours, then the next two after the colon as minutes. Like, assuming the string is stored in time_str:\n\nhrs = read(time_str(1:2),*) or use string functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the FORTRAN intrinsic functions.\n\nHmm. Fortran might have functions like index to find the colon. Let's see:\n\nLet me think: split the string into hours and minutes.\n\nSuppose the variable time_str is the input:\n\nThe hour part is from 1 to position of colon -1, and the minutes from the position after colon until end.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nFirst, find the position of the colon:\n\npos = index(time_str, ':', back=.false.)\n\nThen, hours = char to integer of time_str(1:pos-1)\n\nminutes = char to integer of time_str(pos+1:)\n\nYes. So in code:\n\ninteger :: pos, hrs, mins\ncharacter(len=8) :: time_str\nread(*,'(a)') time_str  ! Read the input line into a string. Need to make sure the length is sufficient.\n\npos = index(time_str, ':' )\nhrs = convert(time_str(1:pos-1)) to integer\nmins = convert(time_str(pos+1:)) to integer.\n\nWait, converting to integer in Fortran can be done using internal reads. So like:\n\nread(time_str(1:pos-1), '(i2)') hrs\nread(time_str(pos+1:), '(i2)') mins\n\nYes, assuming that the time is in two-digit format with leading zeros.\n\nOnce we have hrs and mins, then sim_departure (or simDeparture) is hrs*60 + mins, sim_arrival is sim_departure + tA.\n\nThen the loop for buses: for each i from 300 to 1440, stepping by b.\n\nWait, the loop in Java is \"for (int i = 300; i < 1440; i += b)\" so the bus departures are every b minutes starting at 300, and go up to but not exceeding 1440.\n\nWait, 1440 is midnight, so the loop runs i starting at 300 and increments by b each time, as long as i remains less than 1440.\n\nWait in the Java code, the bus departure times are i, so the loop condition is i < 1440, so i stops at 1439? Since 1440 is excluded. So the last value is the largest i less than 1440.\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent loop:\n\ndo i = 300, 1440 - 1, b\n\nWait, 1440 is inclusive? Wait the original loop is i < 1440. So in Fortran, the loop can be written as from 300 to 1439, step b. But steps might not land exactly. Need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, in the loop, do i = 300, 1439, b. But if b isn't a divisor, the end might be less. Or perhaps better to write it as while loop. But let's see with Fortran's do loop.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\ninteger :: i\ni = 300\ndo while (i < 1440)\n    ... statements...\n    i = i + b\nend do\n\nHmm, perhaps that's better. Because in Fortran, the standard do loop can sometimes be tricky if the steps cross over. Let me think: if step is b, but suppose 300 + b*N exceeds 1440, so we need to stop before that.\n\nAlternatively, the do loop:\n\ndo i = 300, 1439, b\n    (process i)\nend do\n\nWait the upper limit is 1439, so all i steps below 1440. But the problem is that the step may go beyond 1439 if adding b to a lower i would get over 1439, but the step may just not reach it.\n\nAlternatively, the do while loop is more straightforward. Let's code that to avoid confusion.\n\nIn any case, the logic is: each bus departs at time i (in minutes since midnight). The bus arrival is i + tB.\n\nThen, check if the bus departure is >= simArrival \u2192 then bus is after simulation's arrival, so not counted.\n\nOr if simDeparture >= busArrival \u2192 bus arrives before simulation departs, so also not counted.\n\nElse, count +=1.\n\nSo in Fortran code: count is initialized as 0. For each i in the loop:\n\nbus_departure = i\nbus_arrival = i + tB\n\nif (bus_departure >= sim_arrival .or. sim_departure >= bus_arrival) then \n    continue \nelse \n    count = count +1 \nend if\n\nWait, the Java code uses continue to skip, so in Fortran, if the condition is true (so either of the cases), do nothing. Else, add to counter. So, if the condition is false (i.e., not (busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival ) \u2192 ) which is equivalent to the bus's departure is before sim arrival, and the bus arrival is after sim departure. So in Fortran, the logic is the same.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared at the start of a program or subroutine. Since this is a main program, variables are declared in the main program.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step.\n\nProgram codeforces_665_A\n\nimplicit none ! always use this to enforce declarations.\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: a, tA, b, tB\ncharacter(len=8) :: time_str\ninteger :: hrs, mins, pos, sim_departure, sim_arrival\ninteger :: counter = 0, i\n\nThen the code:\n\nRead a and tA: first line:\n\nread(*, *) a, tA\n\nWait, but in Java, the first line's token is read by a StringTokenizer. The Java line:\n\nStringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); \u2192 then tokens are a and tA.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first line has exactly two integers, so the read(*,*) is okay.\n\nSecond line: read into b and tB: read(*,*) b, tB\n\nThird line: read(time_str). Need to read full line, so perhaps using something like read(*, '(A)') time_str\n\nBut in Fortran, if you just write:\n\nread(*,*) time_str \u2192 but this may read only up to the first blank, but the time is in format like \"HH:MM\", which has a colon, not a blank. However, the previous lines may have been read with read(*,*). Hmm, so perhaps better to read all input lines with read(*, '(A)') to explicitly read the strings.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure all the input reads:\n\nRead first line: \n\nread(*, '(A)', advance='no') \u2192 but perhaps better:\n\nFirst read first line as two integers:\n\nread(*,*) a, tA\n\nBecause the first line's input is two integers. Then second line:\n\nread(*,*) b, tB\n\nThen third line: read the time_str as a character string (variable, maybe 10 is enough length).\n\nread(*, '(A)') time_str \u2192 but note that in Fortran, the format '(A)' reads until end-of-record, which for a line is the end of the line.\n\nThen parse time_str into hours and minutes.\n\nSo:\n\npos = index(time_str, ':')\n\nif pos ==0 \u2192 error (maybe, but input is correct).\n\nhours and minutes:\n\nread(time_str(1:pos-1), '(I2)') hrs \u2192 but Fortran has no I2 format, but the format can be something like '(I2)'?\n\nWait:\n\nhm, reading an integer with max two digits.\n\nAlternatively, since the time is in \"HH:MM\", the hours part is up to two digits (like 05, or 12, etc), so:\n\nread( time_str(1:pos-1), '(I2)' ) hrs\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using list-directed reads, maybe 'I2' is the format for fixed length.\n\nWait, the correct way to read into an integer might be something like:\n\nread(time_str(1:pos-1), *) hrs \u2192 would read it as a number.\n\nYes, list-directed read (using *) will interpret the substring as a number. Similarly for the minutes.\n\nSo:\n\nhrs = 0\nmins =0\n\nread(time_str(1:pos-1), *) hrs\n\nread(time_str(pos+1:), *) mins\n\nThat's probably simpler and works as long as the input is in the right format.\n\nOnce we compute sim_departure and sim_arrival.\n\nsim_departure = hrs *60 + mins\n\nsim_arrival = sim_departure + tA\n\nThen loop over the buses.\n\nInitialize counter =0\n\ni starts at 300, increments by b each step, but as long as i remains <1440.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = 300, 1440-1 \u00b7 step is b?\n\nWait: the Java loop is \"i += b\".\n\nWait perhaps starting at 300, then next is 300 +b, then 300+2b, etc, as long as i remains <1440.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop can be written as:\n\ni = 300\n\ndo while (i < 1440)\n\n    process this i\n\n    i = i + b\n\nend do\n\nYes, that way, it's straightforward.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nbus_departure is i.\n\nbus_arrival = i + tB\n\nThe condition to count:\n\nif ( (bus_departure < sim_arrival) .and. (sim_departure < bus_arrival) ) then \u2192 that's the inverse of the Java condition.\n\nBecause:\n\nJava's condition was:\n\nif (busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival) \u2192 continue, so count when it's false.\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition to increment is:\n\nif (bus_departure < sim_arrival .AND. sim_departure < bus_arrival )\n\nthen, counter +=1.\n\nWait, let me compare:\n\nOriginal Java condition:\n\nif (busDeparture >= simArrival || simDeparture >= busArrival) \u2192 then Skip (continue)\n\nSo only count when neither of those conditions are true. So:\n\n! (A or B) is equivalent to !A and !B \u2192 so (bus_departure < simArrival and simDeparture < busArrival )\n\nYes. So the code inside the loop is:\n\nbus_departure = i\n\nbus_arrival = i + tB\n\nif ( (bus_departure < sim_arrival) .and. (sim_departure < bus_arrival) ) then \n\n    counter = counter +1 \n\nend if \n\nSo that's the condition.\n\nOnce the loop is done, print counter to the output.\n\nSo the program would do:\n\nprint *, counter\n\nWait but in Java, PrintWriter is used for output, but in Fortran, we can directly print with print statement.\n\nWait in the Java code, the PrintWriter is flushed and closed, but in Fortran, the * unit is automatically flushed. So, the code can be straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nWait but in Fortran, variables are declared at the beginning.\n\nNow, putting all the code.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nProgram codeforces665a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, tA, b, tB\n\ncharacter(len=8 ) :: time_str \n\ninteger :: hrs, mins, pos\n\ninteger :: sim_departure, sim_arrival\n\ninteger :: counter = 0\n\ninteger :: i, bus_departure, bus_arrival\n\n! Read first line: a and tA\n\nread(*,*) a, tA\n\n! Read second line: b, tB\n\nread(*,*) b, tB\n\n! Read third line into time_str\n\nread(*, '(A)') time_str\n\n! parse time_str:\n\npos = index(time_str, ':')\n\nif (pos == 0) then \n\n    ! error, but assuming input is correct \n\n    print*, 'Error: No colon found' \n\n    stop \n\nend if \n\n! read hrs and mins:\n\nread(time_str(1:pos-1), *) hrs \n\nread(time_str(pos+1:), *) mins \n\nsim_departure = hrs * 60 + mins\n\nsim_arrival = sim_departure + tA\n\ncounter = 0\n\ni = 300 \n\ndo while (i < 1440 ) \n\n    bus_departure = i \n\n    bus_arrival = i + tB \n\n    if ( (bus_departure < sim_arrival) .AND. (sim_departure < bus_arrival ) ) then \n\n        counter = counter + 1 \n\n    end if \n\n    i = i + b \n\nend do \n\nprint*, counter \n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the loop, variables 'bus_departure' and 'bus_arrival' may not be needed as separate variables. They can be computed inline. Alternatively, just compute the condition directly.\n\nBut the code as above should work.\n\nWait variables: 'bus_departure' and 'bus_arrival' can be declared as temps inside loop. Alternatively, we can compute directly.\n\nWait current code uses variables even when not needed. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, inside the loop:\n\nbus_arrival = i + tB \n\nthen the condition can be (i < sim_arrival) and (sim_departure < (i + tB) )\n\nSo the variables are not necessary, but I wrote the code with them for clarity, but the code would be okay as above.\n\nAnother possible issue: the time_str length may be less than the pos+something, for example if the string is \"5:04\", but FORTRAN will handle it because read(*,'(A)') reads the entire line. The variables time_str is length 8, which can hold up to 8 chars. Suppose the input is \"23:59\", then length is 5 which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, to make it flexible, use a larger length, like 12?\n\nBut for CodeForces problems, time is given in the format \"HH:MM\" so 5 characters (e.g. \"23:59\"), so len=8 is sufficient.\n\nWait the format like \"9:9\" would be 3 characters but leading zeros aren't required? The problem says \"HH:MM\" so with two digits each. So safely, 5 characters. So the variable len=5 would also work. But safer to set larger, like 20.\n\nAlternatively, use len=20.\n\nBut in any case, the code should work.\n\nTesting for edge cases.\n\nWhat if the bus departure is exactly equal to sim_arrival? Because in the condition it's strict less than, so yes.\n\nWait the java code's condition is \"busDeparture >= simArrival\", so if it's equal, the bus is after so not counted. Because in Javas condition, if bus departure is >= (equal) to sim arrival \u2192 then continue.\n\nSo the Fortran condition is (bus_departure < sim_arrival).\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition: sim_departure >= bus_arrival \u2192 the bus arrives earlier than sim departing \u2192 the bus is not counted.\n\nWait in Fortran code's condition, the second part is sim_departure < bus_arrival \u2192 if sim depart is exactly equal \u2192 no count.\n\nSame as original code.\n\nThus, the logic is exactly mirroring.\n\nNow, another point: the loop is until i <1440. Since buses can depart at 1439, but their next one would be 1439 + b. But the do-while exits.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nWait in variables: in the code, in variables:\n\nWait the variable 'a' from the first line is not used. The code.ignore a and b? Because in the Java code, the a and b are read, but in the problem, probably a and b are periods between bus departures? Wait the problem's explanation on codeforces might be: A person is taking a simulation that departs at the given time, takes tA minutes. The buses depart every b minutes starting at i=300 (fixed). The buses are the other transport, tB is their travel time.\n\nWait in the Java code, variables a and b are read, but I think that in the problem, a is the period between simulation departures? But since the code's problem's problem is about counting buses that depart after the simulation's departure, but arrive before the simulation's arrival. So the a and b might be parameters but not used in the calculation. For example, in the problem statement (assuming it's problem CF665A), let me think.\n\nLooking at the problem title (since the user provided the code as codeforces_665_A, so perhaps problem A from contest 665.\n\nLooking up the problem quickly: Let me assume that the problem is:\n\nProblem statement (as per code):\n\nTwo people take either a simulation or bus.\n\nThe simulation departs at time T, which takes tA minutes.\n\nThe bus departs at times: starts 5 AM (300 mins?), every b minutes. Each bus trip takes tB minutes.\n\nCount the number of buses departing after simulation's departure but arrive before the simulation arrives.\n\nThe variables a and b in the code are probably irrelevant (maybe in original code, but in code they are read but unused). Wait in the Java code, the variables a and b are read, but in the code they are not used except for reading. So perhaps in the problem statement, the first line has a tA, but a is not used. Maybe a is the departure interval for the simulation, but the simulation is a single departure time as given in input.\n\nWait in the code, the code's first line contains a and tA:\n\nso the first line is a and tA, and the second line is b and tB.\n\nBut in the Java code, a and b are not used elsewhere except for reading. So in code, a and b are not used. That might be a mistake?\n\nWait looking at the code. The code's loop is the buses departing every b minutes. So in the code variables:\n\nb is the period between buses: since the loop is stepping i by b each time, the bus departure times are at 300, 300 +b, 300 +2b etc.\n\nThus variable b is used in the loop's step, which the code uses. So the b variable is read from the second int (from the second line).\n\nWait the first line's first int is a, but in code that is read, but not used. Therefore, maybe the problem's a is not required?\n\nPossible error?\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nFirst line tokens: a and tA: the problem's first line may have a tA pair, but the a perhaps is a dummy variable?\n\nFor example, perhaps problem 665A is as follows: Each simulation departs every 'a' minutes, but we only consider a particular departure. Or perhaps code as written has a and b that are not used but part of the problem's input? Or perhaps a typo?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the a and b in the first and second lines are not used. Indeed, looking at the Java code:\n\nThe code's variables a and b are read but not used. The problem's input might have them in the problem, but perhaps the actual solution only uses tA and tB and the timing.\n\nTherefore, the variables a and b in the input are just read and ignored, so I have to keep them in the Fortran code as well.\n\nThus in the Fortran code, variables a and b are just read, but not used, which is correct per the Java code.\n\nSo code proceeds as above.\n\nNow, check possible issues.\n\nAnother thing: in the Fortran code, the variables for bus_departure and bus_arrival are inside the loop. But why not just compute inline?\n\nIn the fortran code above, the loop is:\n\ndo while (i < 1440)\n\n    bus_depart is i.\n\n    bus_arrival is i + tB \n\n    check conditions.\n\n    increment counter.\n\n    i +=b \n\nEnd do.\n\nWait wait, in the code I have written:\n\nbusDeparture =i, busArrival =i + tB, then the condition is checked, then i is incremented.\n\nWait that's correct. Yes.\n\nWait the loop:\n\ni starts at 300.\n\nloop continues while i <1440.\n\nThus, in each step:\n\nthe current i is checked,\n\nthen after that, i is increases by b.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thought: in Fortran, the assignment is made with the = operator.\n\nYes.\n\nNow testing edge cases.\n\nExample: Let's take a small case where sim departs at 5 AM, which is 300 mins.\n\nSuppose simulation's arrival is 300 + tA = say 303.\n\nThen buses depart at 300, then 300 +b. Let's say b=1 (so buses every minute). But need to see the schedule.\n\nWait let's make an example where:\n\nSample input:\n\nSuppose first line a= anything, tA= 5,\n\nSecond line b= 1, tB= 2 (bus duration 2 mins).\n\nThird line timing is \"05:00\" \u2192 sim departs at 300 mins, arrival at 305.\n\nBuses departure every 1 minute since 300, so they are at 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, ... until below 1440. Wait but we need buses departing between 300 and 304 (since the last bus that departs after sim's departure (300) but before sim arrival (305) is bus at 304:\n\nBus departs at 300: arrival is 302 \u2192 sim's departure is same as bus departure (300). So the bus's arrival is at 302 < sim arrival 305 \u2192 but the condition:\n\nbus_depart (300) < sim arrival (305 \u2192 which is true,\n\nand sim dep (300) < bus_arrival (302 \u2192 yes: so count +=1.\n\nBut the first bus departing at 300:\n\nbus departure is at exactly sim departure. The problem condition:\n\nSo original code's condition: if bus dep < sim arrival \u2192 yes (300 < 305 true),\n\nand sim_depart < bus_arrival (300 <302 \u2192 yes \u2192 count is counted. So yes, the first bus counts?\n\nIn that case, the code should count it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where bus departs exactly when sim arrives.\n\nSuppose sim arrives at i + tB.\n\nNo, let's see:\n\nE.g. if the bus departs at sim's arrival:\n\nbus_departure = sim_arrival: then the condition bus_depart < sim_arrival is false \u2192 so excluded.\n\nThus the code does not count it.\n\nNow, in code's logic.\n\nWhat about if the bus departure is at 300, then its arrival is 300 + tB. The simulation's dep is 300.\n\nTo count, we need the bus must depart after sim's departure time: 300 >= sim depart, yes. Wait no, the first bus departs at 300, which is the same time as sim's departure. The problem's requirement?\n\nThe problem says \"buses that depart after the simulation leaves but arrive before the simulation arrives.\" Hmm but simulation leaves at 300. So departure at exactly the same time? The problem may require \"after\" but the current code?\n\nThe problem's code uses 'busDeparture >= simArrival' \u2192 if bus departure is equal to the sim's departure, that's okay? Let me see code's condition.\n\nWait the code's continue condition is when (busDeparture >= simArrival OR simDeparture >= busArrival \u2192.\n\nIf bus departs at 300 \u2192 time is same as sim departure.\n\nThen first part (bus dep >= sim arrival \u2192 sim arrival is 300+ tA, so if the bus is departing at 300, this is true only if tA is zero, but tA is given as part of input.\n\nWait in the previous example, tA is 5, so sim arrives at 305.\n\nbus departs at 300, so busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 300 <305 \u2192 false.\n\nSo the first part of condition is false.\n\nSecond part: simDeparture (300) >= busArrival (300 + tB \u2192 for the example with tB=2 \u2192 302 \u2192 300 <302, so the second condition (simDepart >= bus arrival?) \u2192 300 >=302 \u2192 no. So the second condition is simDepart < bus arrival.\n\nSo both are false, so the bus is counted.\n\nThus, the bus departing at exactly the same time as simulation is counted. Because the bus departs at the same time, but the arrival is after simulation departure. So the code counts it. So that is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: if the bus departs just before the sim arrives, but arrives after the sim's arrival.\n\nWait sim dep time is X, so arrival is X + tA.\n\nSuppose bus dep at X + tA -1 \u2192 departure before arrival time.\n\nBus arrival is X + tA -1 + tB.\n\nIf that arrival time is after X +tA: then the bus arrives after sim arrives, so the bus doesn't count?\n\nBecause we want buses that arrive before simulation's arrival.\n\nWait, the simulation arrives at X +tA. So the bus must arrive before X + tA.\n\nIn the code, the condition is simulation's departure < bus arrival.\n\nSo if bus arrives after sim arrival \u2192 bus arrival is greater than X+tA \u2192 so the condition is ok, but the bus would have departed before the sim arrives (bus departed at X + tA -1 < X +tA \u2192 so first condition is met (bus departure is before sim arrival?), yes, but second condition: sim departure (X) < bus arrival (X + tA -1 + tB). If that arrival is greater than X +tA, then yes, so counted. But the bus's arrival is after the sim arrives \u2192 so that bus is not wanted. Hmm, so this shows the condition is incorrect?\n\nWait wait no, let's see the code:\n\nThe condition is:\n\nbus departed < sim arrival \u2192 yes,\n\nAND\n\nsim Departure < bus arrival \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the bus is counted only if its departure is before sim arrival, and its arrival after sim's departure.\n\nWait, but the problem wants buses whose arrival is before sim's arrival time?\n\nWait the problem: buses that depart after the sim leaves (i.e., bus departure is after sim's departure) and arrive before the sim arrives (bus arrival is before sim's arrival time)?\n\nWait that's probably the actual condition. But in the code, the problem's condition.\n\nOriginal Java code code says:\n\nIf busDeparture >= simArrival \u2192 then continue \u2192 meaning not counted. So:\n\nNo count if the bus departs after sim has arrived.\n\nSimilarly, if sim departs after the bus's arrival \u2192 the bus arrived before sim even left. So that bus can't count either.\n\nThus, the inverted conditions (not counted in either case).\n\nTo count when the bus departs before sim's arrival and arrives after sim's dep.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires buses that depart after sim's departure: the simulation departs at time T, so buses departing at times between T (exclusive?) or inclusive?\n\nLooking back to code's condition.\n\nIn code: the condition for not counting is:\n\n (busDeparture >= simArrival) OR (simDeparture >= busArrival) \n\nThe code counts when it's false \u2192 so,\n\n(busDeparture < simArrival) AND (simDeparture < busArrival)\n\nSo the buses must depart *before* the simulation arrives, and their arrival is after the simulation departed.\n\nWhich implies the entire time of the bus is between simulation's departure and arrival. Thus, their departure must be after simulation's departure (since buses departing before simulation dep time can't interfere) \u2192 wait no: sim departure is at time T. The bus can depart before T but arrive after?\n\nWait, suppose bus departs at T-1, arrives at T + 5 \u2192 then it is a bus that was before the simulation departed. The simulation is still making its trip. Does such a bus count?\n\nThe problem's description is unclear. But according to the Java code's condition, such a bus (depart before T (sim dep time) arrives after T and before T + tA \u2192 sim is going from T to T + tA. So the bus departs before sim departs, arrives after departure but before arrival. Is that counted?\n\nThe code's condition says count it. Because bus dep is (T-1 < T + tA (yes), sim dep(T) < bus arrival (T+5 \u2192 yes, if 5 is less than tA.\n\nSuppose the sim's tA is 6. Then, the bus arrival at T+5 is less than T +6 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus code counts this bus.\n\nBut according to problem description, maybe the buses need to depart after the simulation departs. So why would we count buses that depart before? Unless the problem counts any buses overlapping with the simulation's time, regardless of when they depart.\n\nLooking back to the problem's likely description (assuming it's codeforces problem 665A: the problem is \"Tolls\". Wait, problem 665A is called \"Anna, Rise Up!\". Maybe the problem is:\n\nThe problem's narrative might involve events overlapping in time during the contest dates. Alternatively, the problem asks how many buses are en route (i.e., departed after the simulation starts, and arrive before the simulation ends).\n\nThus, the code's condition counts that.\n\nIn any case, the code is as given and must be translated.\n\nThe Fortran code is as above.\n\nNow, testing for possible errors.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran is case-insensitive, but in the code variables have lower-case letters. Probably no problem.\n\nNow, writing the final code.\n\nWait the Fortran code I had above uses:\n\nIn the read for the time_str:\n\nread(*, '(A)') time_str\n\nWait in fortran, the format '(A)' will read until end of line. But in the Java code, the third line is read as the entire line (br.readLine()) so same for fortran. So this is correct.\n\nNow codewise, the program:\n\nProgram codeforces_665_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, tA, b, tB\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: time_str ! Safer larger string\n\ninteger :: pos, hrs, mins\n\ninteger :: sim_departure, sim_arrival\n\ninteger :: counter = 0 ! Initialize to 0\n\ninteger :: i \n\nread(*,*) a, tA \n\nread(*,*) b, tB \n\nread(*, '(A)') time_str \n\n! Parse time_str into hours and minutes:\n\npos = index( time_str, ':' )\n\n! Check if pos found (assuming the problem ensures colon exists)\n\nread( time_str(1:pos-1), * ) hrs \n\nread( time_str(pos+1:), * ) mins \n\nsim_departure = hrs * 60 + mins \n\nsim_arrival = sim_departure + tA \n\ni = 300 ! Start time \n\ncounter = 0 \n\ndo while (i < 1440) \n\n    ! Compute current bus departure i, arrival is i + tB \n\n    if ( (i < sim_arrival ) .and. &\n\n         ( sim_departure < (i + tB) ) ) then \n\n        counter = counter +1 \n\n    end if \n\n    i = i + b \n\nend do \n\nprint*, counter \n\nend program\n\nWait I removed the intermediate variables for bus_departure and bus_arrival, as they are just i and i +tB. Thus code simplifies.\n\nThis is better and correct.\n\nWait in the first read statements:\n\nAfter read(*, '(A)') time_str\n\nThe string may include trailing characters, like newline, but the index() function would still work as long as the colon is present.\n\nAlso, in case of leading or trailing spaces? But the problem's input says the timings would be given as correct \"HH:MM\" strings. So input is safe.\n\nNow testing this code.\n\nTest case:\n\nIf a bus's departure is exactly at 300 (5AM), and the sim departs at 300, and the sim takes 2 mins (tA=2).\n\nThen sim arrival is 302.\n\nThe bus's arrival would be 300 + tB. Let tB be 1.\n\nThen bus arrival is 301 < 302 \u2192 the bus's arrival is within the simulation's trip. The code then counts it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test:\n\nSample code where input is:\n\nFirst line: 0 3 \u2192 a is ignored, tA is 3.\n\nSecond line: 1 5 \u2192 tB is 5, b=1.\n\nThird line is 5:00 \u2192 05:00 \u2192 time_str is '5:00'?\n\nWell, if written as \"5:00\", and the program reads the hour part as 1 or 5.\n\nWait \"5:00\" will be read with pos = index of :, so:\n\ntime_str(1:pos-1) is'5' \u2192 read as integer 5.\n\nmins will be from '00' \u2192 0 \u2192 sim depart is 5*60 +0 =300.\n\nThen sim arrives is 300+3=303.\n\nb=1 \u2192 buses depart every 1 min starting at 300:\n\nEach bus departure i from 300, 301, ..., until 1439.\n\nFor each i:\n\nThe condition is:\n\ni < 303 \u2192 bus departed before simulation ends.\n\nAND (300 < (i +5) \u2192 sim departamento 300 must be < i+5 \u2192 i+5 > 300 \u2192 i>295 \u2192 which it always is since i >=300.\n\nThus the first condition is i < 303.\n\nThus, the valid i's are 300 (300 <303? yes, so counts. 300+5 is 305 >300 \u2192 yes.\n\ncount = number of i from 300 up to 302 (since 302 <303 \u2192 yes)\n\nSo 300, 301, 302 \u2192 three buses?\n\nLet me see the numbers:\n\ni=300 \u2192 yes both conditions: yes \u2192 counted \u2192 count 1.\n\ni=301: yes \u2192 count 2.\n\ni=302 \u2192 yes \u2192 count 3.\n\ni=303 \u2192 not counted (since 303 is not <303).\n\nThus total of 3?\n\nBut counter should be 3.\n\nThe code gives 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus code works.\n\nThus the Fortran code is correct.\n\nThus the final code is as above. The variables a and b are read from the inputs but unused, but the code follows the java's logic accurately."
