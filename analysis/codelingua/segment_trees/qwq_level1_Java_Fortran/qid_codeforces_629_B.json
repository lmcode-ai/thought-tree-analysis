So better to remove the temp_min and use an inline expression, like:\n\ntemp_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) ) But if we need to compute that, perhaps do without the temporary variable but evaluate min inline. Wait the if statement can be:\n\nif (min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j)) > answer) then \n\n      answer = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n\n end if\n\nAlternatively, compute into a local variable:\n\ninteger :: current_min\n\nthen inside the j loop:\n\ncurrent_min = min(...)\n\nThen the if condition.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads some number of intervals from the user, each marked as 'M' or 'F'. For each interval from day a to day b, it increments a count for either M or F for each day in that interval. Then, for each day, it checks which count is lower between M and F. But wait, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me see the condition again: \n\nif (MfriendPerDay[j] < FfriendPerDay[j]) { \n    if (MfriendPerDay[j] > answer) answer = MfriendPerDay[j]; \n} else { \n    if (FfriendPerDay[j] > answer) answer = FfriendPerDay[j];\n}\n\nHmm, so when M is less than F, it takes the M count, else it takes F. So the maximum of the minimum between M and F on each day. The final answer is the maximum of min(M, F) over all days, multiplied by 2. \n\nWait, no, actually, it's taking whichever is smaller, and keeping track of the maximum of that smaller value. Because if M < F, then take M's value; otherwise, take F's value. Then the maximum of all those minima is stored, and finally multiplied by 2. So the output is the maximum of the minimum between M and F for any day, times 2. \n\nNow, how to translate this Java code into Fortran. \n\nFirst step: The input handling. The Java code uses a Scanner, reads n, then for n lines, each line starts with a character (either M or F), then two integers a and b. \n\nIn Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements. So maybe we can read each line by first reading the character (as a string of length 1?), then the two integers. \n\nBut in Fortran, the way to read a character and numbers might require a format specification. Like, for each line, the input might be something like 'M 1 2' so the first token is a character, followed by two numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps read with a list-directed input. So for reading each line, we can read a string (variable c being a character*1) and then the two integers a and b. \n\nWait, variables in Fortran. Let me think about the variables. \n\nThe Java code has an array of size 367 for both M and F, since Java arrays are 0-based but the days probably run up to 366 (like days from 1 to 366 inclusive?), but the size is 367 (indices 0 to 366?), but in the Java code, the array is initialized to size 367, and in the for loop for j from a to b, assuming a and b can be up to 366? So in Fortran, perhaps we can use arrays from 1 to 367 to make it easier, but maybe better to start from 1, so perhaps shift the indices.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the arrays are from 0 to 366 (since 367 elements). The days from 1 to 366 maybe, so the loops could be for j from 1 to 366, but in the code, for each (a and b) it increments the days from a to b. So the a and b in Java could be 1-based days. \n\nSo in Fortran code, the arrays can be declared as integers dimension 0:367, but in Fortran arrays start at 1 unless specified. \n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions, for example:\n\ninteger :: FfriendPerDay(367)\n\nThen indexes 1 to 367. But in Java, the array runs from 0 to 366 (since size 367). So to make it match, perhaps in Fortran, declare them from 0 to 366 by setting:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:366) :: MfriendPerDay, FfriendPerDay\n\nWait, Fortran allows specifying lower and upper bounds. So for 367 elements (indices 0 to 366 inclusive), the declaration would be dimension(0:366).\n\nAlternatively, use the syntax with (/ 367 /) but without specifying lower bound, but that would start from 1. Hmm, better to make explicit.\n\nSo, first, the variables:\n\nn is an integer. In Fortran, variables need to be declared. We can use IMPLICIT NONE to enforce explicit declarations.\n\nThe for loops: in code, for the main loop over n entries. The first loop in Java is for (int i=0;... which translates to a do loop in Fortran.\n\nThen, for the interval a to b, the loop for (int j=a; j<=b ; j++) in Java. In Fortran, do j = a, b. \n\nThe logic inside: increment the appropriate array (M or F) based on the input c. \n\nThen after each increment, check which one (M or F) is smaller at that day j, then compare that value to the current maximum answer.\n\nWait, but the code in Java does this check after each increment for each day in the interval. That's different. Because the for loop for j from a to b does each day in sequence, and each day's count is updated, then the if condition is checked right away. \n\nWait in Java code, inside the day loop (j loop):\n\nFor each day j between a and b:\n\n1. update the appropriate array (M or F)\n\n2. then check whether M < F on that day, then take either M's count or F's.\n\nBut since we just updated that array, that is, after incrementing either the M or F for the day j, we immediately compare the current counts for that day and update the answer variable. \n\nWait, so for each day in the interval, after adding either M or F, the code updates the answer based on the current counts of M and F for that day. \n\nThus, the logic is for every day j, after the increment, we take the minimum between MfriendPerDay[j] and FfriendPerDay[j], and check whether that minimum is larger than the current answer. If yes, then update answer to that value. \n\nHmm, in the code logic, the answer is tracking the maximum of the min(M, F) over all days, across all days. So each day, every time after increment, the min is considered and if it's bigger than the stored answer, it's stored. \n\nAh, so the code's for loop does for each day in a to b, and loops over all days in all intervals. \n\nSo the answer variable is initialized to zero, and for every j day, after any increment (either M or F), the code checks the min between the two arrays at j and updates answer if necessary. \n\nThus, the Fortran code needs to do the same.\n\nSo translating the loops:\n\nIn Fortran, the main steps would be:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Initialize FfriendPerDay and MfriendPerDay arrays (size 366 +1? The arrays go from 0 to 366?)\n\nWait, let me check the Java code's loop:\n\nWhen input a and b, it's days starting from a, up to b inclusive. But Java has arrays from 0 to 366, so the a and b could be from 1 to 366, so the indices are properly accessed. \n\nSo in Fortran, the arrays should be of size 367 elements (a vector from 1 to 367?), but perhaps declared as (0:366).\n\nWait, better to represent as 0-based arrays like in Java to match indices. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, a, b, answer=0\ninteger :: FfriendPerDay(0:366), MfriendPerDay(0:366)\n\nThe loop over each of the n entries would read c, a, b. Then loop over the days from a to b.\n\nWait the variables a and b are integers from the input, so in Fortran, those are read as integers.\n\nThe first part: reading each line's initial character and two integers. \n\nIn Fortran, to read the inputs, each line would start with a string of length 1 (the character c) followed by two integers. \n\nHmm, using the read statement with a format that reads the character then integers. \n\nPossibly:\n\nRead the character as a string of length 1. So declare c as a character(len=1):\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: c\n\nThen, for each iteration of the loop:\n\nread(*,*) c, a, b\n\nBut if the input uses a space-separated format, that should work with list-directed input. \n\nNow, the loops:\n\nLoop over the intervals (the first loop in the Java code - for i=0 to n-1).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\nBut the original Java code starts from 0 but goes through n iterations, so in Fortran just loop n times, like from 1 ton:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\nThen, read the variables and proceed. \n\nThe inner loop over days from a to b:\n\ndo j=a, b\n\nThen inside the loop:\n\nif (c == 'M') then\n\n   MfriendPerDay(j) = MfriendPerDay(j) +1\n\nelse\n\n   FfriendPerDay(j) = FfriendPerDay(j) +1\n\nendif\n\nWait, in fortran the variable c is a character; so comparing should be ok. Now, after incrementing, the next step is:\n\nCompute the minimum between MfriendPerDay (j) and FfriendPerDay (j). \n\nWait, but how to do the test. \n\nAfter incrementing, the code checks:\n\nif (MfriendPerDay[j] < FfriendPerDay[j]) then\n\n    current_min = MfriendPerDay[j]\n\nelse\n\n    current_min = FfriendPerDay[j]\n\nend if\n\nthen, if current_min > answer, set answer=current_min.\n\nAlternatively, can directly compute the min and check (without using a variable):\n\nSo in code:\n\ntemp_m = MfriendPerDay(j)\n\ntemp_f = FfriendPerDay(j)\n\nif (temp_m < temp_f) then\n\n   temp_min = temp_m\n\nelse \n\n    temp_min = temp_f\n\nend if\n\nif (temp_min > answer) then \n\n   answer = temp_min\n\nend if\n\nAlternatively, using min(temp_m, temp_f), but in Fortran, the intrinsic function min is for integers. So:\n\ntemp_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) )\n\nthen check if temp_min is greater than answer. \n\nThus, saving a conditional. \n\nBut in the original code, perhaps there was an old way, but here using the min function is better. \n\nWait, in the original Java code: \n\nThey have:\n\nif (c == 'M') MfriendPerDay[j]++;\nelse FfriendPerDay[j]++;\nif (MfriendPerDay[j] < FfriendPerDay[j]) {\n    if (MfriendPerDay[j] > answer) answer = MfriendPerDay[j];\n} else {\n    if (FfriendPerDay[j] > answer) answer = FfriendPerDay[j];\n}\n\nAh wait a minute, I see that the original code, after incrementing, does NOT compute the min(M,F) but rather picks between M and F's counts in that day, but only the one that is smaller? Wait the first condition:\n\nIf M < F, then it takes M (since if M is smaller, then the minimum is M, so the code is doing exactly that: choosing whichever is smaller and then see if that value is bigger than current max.\n\nWait, but the code does not take the minimum of the two. Instead, it does exactly that. \n\nWait the code: If M is less than F, then the current min is M, so check if M's value is the new answer. Else (so F <= M), the min is F, so check if F's value is bigger.\n\nThus, the code's logic can be rewritten as:\n\ncurrent_min = min(M, F)\n\nif (current_min > answer) then answer = current_min end if.\n\nHence, the code is correct, and in Fortran, to compute the minimum, we can use the min function. \n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better to write this part as:\n\n       temp_min = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n\n       if (temp_min > answer) answer = temp_min\n\nThis would be more straightforward than the original conditional way. \n\nBut since the original code uses an if-else structure, but the min approach is equivalent, so better to code the Fortran with the min function. \n\nThus, the code can be more efficient, and perhaps avoids some code repetition. \n\nSo, in the inner loop (the day loop), after the increment, we do:\n\ncompute min of the two counts for that day, and if that's bigger than current answer, set it.\n\nNow, translating all that, putting the variables:\n\nThe Fortran code structure would look like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_629_B\n\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, answer=0\n    integer, dimension(0:366) :: MfriendPerDay, FfriendPerDay\n    character(len=1) :: c\n    integer :: i, j\n    \n    ! Initialize the arrays to zero?\n    MfriendPerDay = 0\n    FfriendPerDay = 0\n    \n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n    \n    do i=1, n\n        read(*,*) c, a, b\n        do j = a, b\n            if (c == 'M') then\n                MfriendPerDay(j) = MfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            else\n                FfriendPerDay(j) = FfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            end if\n            \n            ! After increment, compute the current_min\n            integer :: temp_min\n            temp_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) )\n            if (temp_min > answer) then\n                answer = temp_min\n            end if\n        end do ! j\n    end do ! i\n    \n    ! Finally, print answer *2\n    print*, answer * 2\n    \nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables need to be declared before use. Let me check:\n\nThe variables MfriendPerDay and FfriendPerDay are declared with dimension(0:366), which is correct.\n\nNow, in the do loops:\n\nWait, but what if the variables a, b are read as, say, lower than 0 or higher than 366?\n\nWell, the problem specifies the constraints of the input. The Java code probably expects a and b to fit within the array's indices, so the problem must ensure that. So in the translation, there is no problem.\n\nAnother point: the arrays are initialized to zero. In Fortran, the default initialization is undefined (if not set). So, in the code above, after declaring the arrays, setting them to zero is necessary. The line:\n\nMfriendPerDay = 0\n\ndoes that for all elements. Similarly for FfriendPerDay. So the initialization is done correctly.\n\nWait in the code I wrote, MfriendPerDay and FfriendPerDay are initialized to zero after their declaration but before going into the loop processing the intervals. That is necessary, otherwise their initial values could be anything. \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing the data types. The variables a and b are integers, which is fine. \n\nNow check the loops. The 'do i=1,n' loop is correct, but in Java the loop was from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran it's 1 to n which gives the same result.\n\nThe character c must be read as lowercase or uppercase? The original code in Java is checking for 'M' (uppercase?), the problem might require that. \n\nWait the code uses sc.next().charAt(0), so assuming the input is 'M' or 'F', with uppercase letters. The Fortran code must treat them as uppercase. So in the code, when read, the character is stored as uppercase, which relies on the input being in uppercase. Otherwise, need to convert, but since the problem probably provides correct inputs, as per the original code, we can proceed as is.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the character comparison is case-sensitive? I think so, as in most languages. \n\nThus, in the code 'c == 'M'' will only be true if the first character is capital M. Need to assume that the input for 'c' is properly capitalized as per problem's test cases. \n\nNow, code structure:\n\nThe above program is structure correctly. \n\nWait, in the code, temp_min is declared inside the loop. Wait, in the code I wrote above, inside the j loop, we have:\n\n            integer :: temp_min\n\nBut in Fortran, variable declarations have to be before any executable statements in a block. Since that is inside a loop, which is part of a block, that would not be allowed. Oh right, declarations have to be at the beginning of a scope. So to fix that, need to declare temp_min at the top, outside loops.\n\nSo better to remove the temp_min and use an inline expression, like:\n\ntemp_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) )\n\nBut if we need to compute that, perhaps do without the temporary variable but evaluate min inline.\n\nWait the if statement can be:\n\nif (min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j)) > answer) then \n\n      answer = min(MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j))\n\n end if\n\nAlternatively, compute into a local variable:\n\ninteger :: current_min\n\nthen inside the j loop:\n\ncurrent_min = min(...)\n\nThen the if condition. But to do that, the variable current_min must be declared at the start, outside of loops.\n\nIn the above structure, variables a, b, c are declared in the main program scope. Let me revise the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_629_B\n\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, answer=0\n    integer, dimension(0:366) :: MfriendPerDay, FfriendPerDay\n    character(len=1) :: c\n    integer :: i, j\n    integer :: current_min  ! declare here\n    \n    ! Initialize\n    MfriendPerDay = 0\n    FfriendPerDay = 0\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    \n    do i=1, n\n        read(*,*) c, a, b\n        do j = a, b\n            if (c == 'M') then\n                MfriendPerDay(j) = MfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            else\n                FfriendPerDay(j) = FfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            end if\n            \n            current_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) )\n            if (current_min < 0 ) then  ! shouldn't happen, but as a sanity \n               print*, 'Error negative min'\n            else\n                if (current_min > answer) then\n                    answer = current_min\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    print*, answer*2\n    \nend program codeforces_629_B\n\nWait, but since min cannot be negative if the variables are >=0. But that's okay. Maybe remove the check for negative.\n\nAlternatively, probably not needed.\n\nAlternatively, instead, let me code it with the if condition inline without the temporary variable:\n\n         temp = min( ... )\n\nthen condition. But that requires a variable declared earlier.\n\nAlternatively, just code:\n\nif (min( mval, fval ) > answer ) then\n\n   answer = min( mval, fval )\n\nend if\n\nBut recomputing min twice. However, it's not an issue for performance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to have a variable.\n\nBut regardless, the code needs to have the variables declared correctly.\n\nAnother possible mistake: the indices a and b might be beyond 0 to 366. For example, if a day is 367, then when j=367, the array entries would be out of bounds. \n\nWait, the arrays are dimensioned as 0:366, so indices from 0 to 366 (367 elements). Thus, if a or b is outside that range, accessing it would be bad. The problem likely specifies that the intervals are between days 1 and 366 inclusive (assuming some 1-based days?), so maybe the problem expects the input a and b to be between 1 and 366.\n\nWait the Java code initializes the arrays to 367 elements, initialized as indices from 0 to 366, and when the for loop is over days a to b, so the a and b can be the first and last days (like 1 to 366), so in Fortran code, that's okay.\n\nThus, we don't have to worry, as per the problem's constraints.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, checking the print statement: the original code prints System.out.println(answer *2); so in Fortran, print*, answer*2. \n\nThus, that's correct. \n\nWait, in the variables: \"answer\" starts at 0. Whenever the temp_min is larger than the current answer, it updates it. So if all days have 0 counts, the answer remains 0. \n\nTesting a possible example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\nM 2 5\n\nF 3 7\n\nM 4 6\n\nLet me compute manually:\n\nInitialization:\n\narrays all zero.\n\nFirst interval M from 2-5. For days j=2,3,4,5.\n\nAdding M for each of those days:\n\nEach increment to those M array. \n\nAt each day, after the increment, compute M and F's counts, then take the min between them.\n\nFor example on day 2: after first step (M), M is 1 and F is 0. min(1,0)=0. So answer remains 0 or 0. Since previously answer is 0, so min is 0, so no change. \n\nWait no:\n\nWait the first step is M2's case.\n\nDay2:\n\nM was 0 before increment. After adding 1, becomes 1. F is 0. The min(1,0) is 0, which is not higher than the current answer (0). So no change.\n\nSimilarly for all days until after adding first M's. \n\nThen second interval F from3-7: \n\nEach day 3-7:\n\nAdd to F array.\n\nFor example, day3:\n\nFirst (from first M's, M becomes1) then now add F: F becomes 1, so min(1,1) =1. Since answer was initially 0, this will update answer to 1.\n\nThen day4, after adding F:\n\nM was 1, now F becomes1. min(1,1)=1 again.\n\nEtc. \n\nSo after the second interval, when processing each day from3-7.\n\nLet me see step-by-step:\n\nFirst input is:\n\n3\n\nM 2 5: adds M to 2-5.\n\nThen F 3-7.\n\nThen M 4-6.\n\nLet's see how the counts progress.\n\nAfter the first interval:\n\nDays 2: M=1\n\ndays3:M=1, days4: same, 5: same.\n\nThe F's counts are 0 in all these days.\n\nThe min for day2 after first interval: M=1 and F=0: min 0. \n\nAfter second interval (F3-7):\n\nFor j=3:\n\nF is increased by1. So now F is 1 at day3. \n\nM(3) is 1, F(3) is 1: min is 1. So answer becomes 1.\n\nThen j=4: day4: F becomes 1. The M was previously 1 (from first interval). So now F is 1, same as M. So min is 1. So answer remains 1.\n\nj=5: same as above, min is still 1 or 1. \n\nj=6: now, day6 was M's first interval? Since the first interval was up to day5. day6 wasn't touched in the first interval. Since first interval is from 2-5: day5 is the upper bound. \n\nWait, first interval is days 2 to5, so day5 is included. \n\nSecond interval is days 3-7. \n\nSo for day6, in second interval step:\n\nFirst, for that interval (F), day6's F is increased by1. Since day6 had initially 0 for M and F, now M=0, F=1. The min is 0, so no change unless the current answer is higher.\n\nWait, let me see for each day:\n\nProcessing the second interval's day6 (j=6):\n\nSince it's part of F's interval.\n\nday6: \n\nAt second interval step, before increment: \n\nM_day6 is 0 (never been incremented before, since first interval was up to day5), F_day6 is 0.\n\nThen adding F gives F_day6=1.\n\nThe min is min(0,1)=0, which is less than current answer (1), so no change. \n\nThen days after:\n\nj=7:\n\nj=7, first time, so M is0, F becomes1 (because now adding this interval's F). min(0,1)=0.\n\nThe second interval's processing.\n\nThen, after the second interval:\n\nthe days 3:\n\nM=1, F=1 \u2192 min=1\n\nday4: same, etc. \n\nThe answer is now 1. \n\nThird interval is M 4-6:\n\nStarting to update M's 4-6.\n\nProcessing day4:\n\nPrevious M was1, now adding 1 \u2192 2. F was1. Now min(2 vs 1 is 1. So min is 1, which is less than current answer (1). \n\nWait, for day4 after third interval first iteration (when adding M? Let's see:\n\nFor third interval (M's 4-6):\n\nProcessing day4:\n\nBefore increment, M(4) was 1 (from first interval's M), F(4) is 1 (from second interval's F). \n\nAdding M: M becomes 2. \n\nNow M=2 and F=1. The min is1. Which is same as current answer (1). So not updated. \n\nWait, but the min would be F's 1 here, so 1. \n\nProceeding to day5 in third interval (day5 is in M's 4-6, so yes):\n\nProcessing day5:\n\nprevious M value was 1 (from first interval) plus this adds 1 \u2192 2. F was 1 (second interval). \n\nSo min(2,1)=1. Still no change. \n\nDay6:\n\nAdd M:\n\nM was 0 (since first interval was up to 5?), so first iteration over first interval's 2-5 includes day5 but not day6. So before adding M's current third interval:\n\nM's initial added on day6 was none, so initially, before third interval:\n\nat day6:\n\nfrom second F's interval, F is1.\n\nM was0 (from original, since first interval didn't reach it). \n\nSo for third interval, processing day6:\n\nAdding M \u2192 M becomes1, F is1. The min is1, so same as current answer.\n\nThus, answer remains 1.\n\nWait, but:\n\nLet me see day4 after the third interval. Let me go through in more details:\n\nThird interval (M's from4-6):\n\nProcessing j=4:\n\nAdding M: previous M was1 (from first interval), now 2.\n\nF is 1 (from second interval).\n\nThe min is min(2,1)=1. Since answer is 1. So no change.\n\nj=5:\n\nOriginal M from first interval was1, now adding 1 (total 2). F from second interval is1. Min is1 \u2192 same.\n\nj=6:\n\nM was0 before third interval; now adding 1 (since it's in the third interval's interval). \n\nF on day6 from second interval was1 \u2192 adding nothing here for F: so F remains at 1.\n\nmin(1,1)=1 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the answer remains 1.\n\nSo the final answer is 1, so the code would output 2. But is there a case where it can get a higher value?\n\nWait let's see another example: suppose on day3 after third interval:\n\nWait third interval is M4-6, so day3 is not in it. So the first interval was M2-5, so day3 is included in first and second. \n\nThen after second interval, on day3, it's M(1) and F(1). \n\nThird interval doesn't affect day3. So the maximum min so far is 1. \n\nIs there any day where min is larger than 1? Let me think of another example where you have overlapping M and F.\n\nSuppose in another test case with two intervals:\n\n1\n\nF 1-300 and\n\n another interval M 1-300: \n\nthen each day's M and F counts would be 2. So the min is 2. So answer would be 2, output 4. \n\nSo the code would compute that.\n\nIn code:\n\nAfter processing both intervals, e.g. for M 1-300 added after F's:\n\nAt the first interval is F, then M's:\n\nBut increments would turn each day's M and F counts to 1 each? Wait let me see:\n\nWait first interval: F 1-300: \n\neach of days 1-300 gets +1 to F. \n\nSecond interval (M, same dates):\n\neach day gets +1 to M. \n\nSo M day1 is 1, F day1 is 1 \u2192 min 1.\n\nAfter first interval (F), each day's F is 1 and M 0. \n\nThen in second interval (M), day1 gets M=1, F was1, so min(1,1)=1, which is the same as before. \n\nWait but in the first step (F), then in the second step (M). For day1:\n\nAfter F interval, F is1, M is0 \u2192 min 0 (so answer 0).\n\nThen, when adding M to day1:\n\nnow M becomes1, so min(1,1) is 1. Which would set answer to1. \n\nThus after all intervals, the answer is2 (since M and F are each 1). Wait, no. Each interval contributes: \n\nFirst F: F=1, M=0. So the min is 0 \u2192 current answer is 0 (from this day?) \n\nBut then, when adding the second interval (M), so M becomes1, and the current min is1, so that becomes the new answer. \n\nThus overall, the minimum is 1, for each day and code would return 2 (1*2). But in that case, the desired answer should be M and F are 1 each (count per day is 2 in each, the counts are equal, so the min is1 per day. Hence the maximum is1, so output is2.\n\nWhich matches. So the code works. \n\nTherefore, the code correctly does what the original Java does. \n\nNow, in the Fortran code, that logic is captured properly. \n\nAnother possible error: Since in Fortran, array indices must not be out of bound. \n\nBut the code initializes arrays from 0 to 366 and expects a and b being within that range. \n\nAssuming the problem ensures that. \n\nTesting for input a=0? Well, if someone inputs a 0, it's beyond the arrays. But since according to problem constraints, the input should be valid.\n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nWait, in the first line of the Java code's main:\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\nSo it's using the Scanner class. But that's not needed in the Fortran code. \n\nThus, the Fortran code as written should work. \n\nHence, the final code would be the one as above. \n\nWait but in code, I had variables declared with 'integer :: current_min'. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the original code I wrote after thinking:\n\nprogram codeforces_629_B\n\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, a, b, answer=0\n    integer, dimension(0:366) :: MfriendPerDay, FfriendPerDay\n    character(len=1) :: c\n    integer :: i, j\n    integer :: current_min  ! declare here\n    \n    MfriendPerDay = 0\n    FfriendPerDay = 0\n    \n    read(*,*) n\n    \n    do i=1, n\n        read(*,*) c, a, b\n        do j = a, b\n            if (c == 'M') then\n                MfriendPerDay(j) = MfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            else\n                FfriendPerDay(j) = FfriendPerDay(j) + 1\n            end if\n            \n            current_min = min( MfriendPerDay(j), FfriendPerDay(j) )\n            if (current_min > answer) then\n                answer = current_min\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    print*, answer*2\n    \nend program codeforces_629_B\n\nYes, that's the code. So I think this is correct."
