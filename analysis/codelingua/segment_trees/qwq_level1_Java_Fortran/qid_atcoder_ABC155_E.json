So in Fortran:\n\nfor each i from 0 to (num_length-1), the corresponding character index is (num_length - i). Wait let's calculate for our example:\n\ni=0 -> 3-0=3? But that would give the third character (the third position). Wait 3-0 is 3, which is \"3\" in \"123\" ? Wait no. Because in the example:\n\nfor i=0 (Java): the char index is 3-1 -0 = 2, so character at index2 (third char, '3')? Hmm, so in Fortran, to get the same:\n\nDesired character index (in java) is 'pos = number.length()-1 -i'\n\nin Fortran, since the string starts at 1, that is the same as pos_in_F = (number.length())",

Wait that might be a problem in the original code. Let's think: At the code's first step (the array is allocated with size number_length+1 in Java, but the digits array is [0 ... L ), when processing i= L (the index last element) then digits[i] is in the array, but digits[i+1] is not. This is a bug. So perhaps in Java, it will produce an array index out of bounds error when i is the last index? Wait maybe the original problem statement has constraints on input. Wait maybe the problem is in code that the digits[i+1] can only be accessed when that is necessary but in an event that isn't possible in that loop?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads a number as a string, processes its digits from least to most significant, and calculates some bills based on each digit's value. The main steps are:\n\n1. Read the input number.\n2. Convert each character of the string to digits, reversing them (since the first character is the least significant digit).\n3. Process each digit to compute the bills, considering carry-over when digits exceed certain values.\n\nHmm, in Java, they used an array of size number.length +1. Because in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, I'll need to adjust for that or explicitly declare them as 0-based. Maybe I can use an integer array with a size of length+1 starting at 0.\n\nFirst, let's handle the input. In Fortran, reading a string is straightforward. So I'll start with:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_e\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, parameter :: INF = 1e15   ! Wait, but 1e15 is a real in Fortran. The original uses a long, but in Java it's 1e15 as a long. However in the code, the INF isn't used. Wait, looking back: in the Java code, the INF is declared but never used? Because in the loops and computations, it's not referenced. Oh right, so I can omit that part.\n\nSo first, read the input string:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: number\nread(*,'(A)') number\n\nWait, but in Fortran, allocatable variables might need to be read with some attention. Alternatively, perhaps read into a fixed-length string first. Let me see another approach: Suppose the string is up to, say, 1e5 digits, but maybe even length 100000. Alternatively, since we can't know the length in advance, perhaps read until the end of line. Using list-directed input, the read statement can directly take a string, but maybe the following:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: number\ninteger :: num_length\nread(*,*) number\n\nThen, num_length would be the actual length? But getting the actual length of a Fortran string: use len_trim. So:\n\nnum_length = len_trim(number)\n\nThen, digits array. The original Java code uses an int array of length n+1. Let me see:\n\noriginal code initializes digits with new int[number.length() + 1], so in Fortran, perhaps declare it as a integer array starting from 0, but in Fortran arrays can be from 0 if declared as 0:n.\n\ndigits(0:num_length)\n\nWait, let's start coding the variables. Wait variables needed: digits array, bills variable, variables for loops.\n\nSo initializing digits. Also, processing the digits from the original string in reverse. \n\nLoop over each character in the string. Since the string is stored as number, and in Fortran, number(i:i) gets the ith character. The original loops over i from 0 to number.length-1 in Java, and for each position, digits[i] = the digit from the end. \n\nWait in Java code, for (int i =0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\ndigits[i] = (number.charAt(number.length() -1 -i) - '0');\n\nThe string in Java is processed from the end. So for the first character (i=0 in the digit array) is the least significant digit. So in Fortran terms, for the input string number (length num_length):\n\ndo i = 0, num_length-1\n\n   position = num_length - i \n\n   character at position 'position' is the ith digit?\n\nWait need to think:\n\nSuppose the string is \"123\"\n\nnumber.length() in Java is 3. The indices are 0,1,2.\n\nJava's loop for i from 0 to 2:\n\ndigits[0] = number.charAt(2) - '0' (the third character '3'? yes, because 3 -1 -0 = 2. So it reverses the string, so the digits array holds digits from least to most significant.\n\nWait the code first iterates from i=0 to the end length-1:\n\ndigits[i] = number.charAt( (number.length() -1 -i) ) - '0'\n\nso the first character in the array is the last character of the string (the ones place), next the tens place, etc. So digits are stored in reversed order.\n\nSo in Fortran, to read the reversed digits:\n\nFor each i from 0 to num_length-1,\n\ndigit = number( (num_length - i):(num_length -i) ) ) ?\n\nWait let me see for \"123\", the string length is 3.\n\nFor i=0: position is 3-1 -0? Wait wait in Java's code, the code uses number.length() -1 -i. \n\nWait let me see:\n\nnumber.length() gives 3 in the example.\n\nnumber.length() -1 -i: for i starting at 0 to 2 (assuming length is 3)\n\nSo for i=0, get index 2 (last character), for i=1, 1 (mid), then 0. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nthe loop would be i from 1 to num_length? Or perhaps:\n\nWait in Fortran, strings are stored with indices from 1 to len_trim(number). So let me see in Fortran, for the digit array's index 0 to num_length (since digits has length +1 in Java? Wait original code:\n\nJava declares the digits array to have length number.length()+1. So the digits in Java go up to digits[i], and the loop in the second part is from i=0 to <=number.length().\n\nWait the second loop (for bills calculation) is for i from 0 to number.length().\n\nWait in the original code, they have a digits array of length number.length()+1; so in Fortran, an array with indices from 0 to num_length (since the original is 0-based with n+1 elements). So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:num_length) :: digits = 0\n\nSo initializing:\n\ndigits(:) = 0\n\nThen, fill the first part (digits[0 to num_length-1], except for the last digit? Let's see.\n\nWait back to the first part of processing digits. \n\nLoop over the string's length:\n\ndo i=0, index limit?\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < number.length(); i++) {\n\ndigits[i] = the requested character.\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, converting into similar logic:\n\ndo i = 0, num_length -1  ! num_length is len_trim(number)\n\nchar_pos = num_length - i \n\nso the string's (char_pos) position? Or let's think:\n\nOriginal in Java: for each i from 0 to num_length-1,\n\nthe character position is number.length() -1 -i. \n\nIn Fortran, since the string's indices start at 1, the equivalent is starting at (num_length - i) ?\n\nWait let me test with an example:\n\nIf the input is 3 digits (length 3), then for i=0: \n\nposition = 3-1 -0 = 2 (java's string index, which is 'third' character if the string is \"123\")\n\nWait no, for example when the string is \"123\", Java's code's number is a String of length 3. So the first character '1' is index 0, '2' is index1, '3' is 2. \n\nFor i=0 in Java:\n\nnumber.length() -1 -i is 3-1 -0 = 2, which is '3'\n\nfor i=1: 3-1 -1 =1, so '2'\n\nfor i=2: 3-1 -2 =0, so '1'\n\nSo each 'i' is the position in the 'digits' array, starting from 0, which corresponds to the reversed digits.\n\nSo in Fortran, to do the same, given the string is stored as characters from 1 to num_length.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nfor each i from 0 to (num_length-1), the corresponding character index is (num_length - i). \n\nWait let's calculate for our example:\n\ni=0 -> 3-0=3? But that would give the third character (the third position). Wait 3-0 is 3, which is \"3\" in \"123\" ?\n\nWait no. Because in the example:\n\nfor i=0 (Java): the char index is 3-1 -0 = 2, so character at index2 (third char, '3')?\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, to get the same:\n\nDesired character index (in java) is 'pos = number.length()-1 -i'\n\nin Fortran, since the string starts at 1, that is the same as pos_in_F = (number.length()) -i \n\nsince:\n\nJava's 'number.length() -1 -i' is the string index (0-based), which converts to Fortran's equivalent (1-based) as (number.length() - i)\n\nBecause (original java char index is (length-1 -i), which is 1 less than (number.length() -i).\n\nWait let's see:\n\njava code's char index (for 'string[0] is '1', etc.\n\njava_char_index = length -1 - i\n\nSo in Fortran string, the position is java_char_index +1 ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nJava index is 0-based, Fortran is 1-based. So to get the same character:\n\nFposition = java_char_index +1\n\nSo for Java's pos: (num_length-1 -i):\n\nFposition is (num_length -1 -i) + 1 = num_length -i \n\nYes, exactly. So in Fortran, the character position is num_length -i.\n\nTherefore:\n\ndigits(i) = ichar(number(num_length -i : num_length -i) ) - ichar('0')\n\nSo in Fortran, ichar converts the character to its ASCII code. So for the character '3', its ASCII is 51, so '0' is 48, so 51-48=3, correct.\n\nSo that's the way to get each digit.\n\nNow, the digits array has 0 to num_length (since Java code uses length+1), so after initialization, the first num_length digits are set, and the rest (digits(num_length) is 0 initially, but processing may add to it.\n\nNext step: processing each digit for the bills computation.\n\nThe original code:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++) {\n\nprocess each digit at position i.\n\n}\n\nThe loop runs from 0 to number.length() inclusive. So in Fortran, we need to loop i from 0 to num_length (inclusive, since digits array can have up to digits(num_length)).\n\nWait, the loop in Java is over i from 0 to len. So in Fortran, the loop would be:\n\ndo i =0, num_length:\n\n ... compute...\n\nend do\n\nNow inside the loop:\n\nCheck digit[i]. The code has:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10):\n\nBut how does digits[i] become 10 in the first case? Looking back, the code first reads the digits and initializes them from the string. Those digits would be 0..9. However, during processing, there could be carry-over leading to digits greater than 10? Not sure, because in the first loop (the initial processing), digits are initialized correctly. But perhaps during the second loop, when processing digits, they can accumulate over 10?\n\nWait the first loop is for reading the digits, then next loop (for bills) starts handling the digits and might carry over digits.\n\nWait let's see the first case:\n\nif the current digit is 10:\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nFirst, during the initial setup of the digits array, all elements except up to the number of digits would be 0. So digits[i] can only be from 0 to9 in the initial digits. But in the second loop, which processes, perhaps during processing, digits are modified. \n\nIn the first line of the inner loop (bills processing):\n\nCheck if the current digit[i] is 10:\n\ndigits[i+1] +=1; and set digit[i]=0 ?\n\nBut how can it be 10? Wait that must be due to the processing steps. Let's think:\n\nWait the processing steps in the code are as follows:\n\nEach digit is processed, and:\n\nif the current digit[i] was set higher? \n\nPerhaps after a carry: for example, when it is over 9, you carry to the next digit.\n\nWait looking at the code, perhaps the 'if (digit[i] ==10 )' case could happen from a previous carry-over from the next digit?\n\nWait the digits are being processed in order. Not sure, but let's continue.\n\nThe first condition: if (digits[i] ==10), then the code does:\n\ndigits[i+1]++; digits[i] =0; \n\nThen adds 0 to the bills? Because if the digit is 10 (as per the first case?), but then maybe it's a carry-over.\n\nSo in the loop processing each digit, for each step:\n\nThe code first looks to see if the current digit is exactly 10. Since digits can only be in 0-10 (maybe?), because when a digit overflows (say 10 comes from an addition to it), then it's handled here.\n\nWait perhaps during processing previous digits, a digit could be incremented beyond 10?\n\nLike when adding 1 to digit[i+1], but not sure. Hmm. The code may need careful translation.\n\nBut in the first case, when the digit is 10, that's a clue that we have to handle overflows.\n\nIn Fortran, the logic can be translated as:\n\nif (digits(i) == 10) then\n\n    digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n\n    digits(i) = 0\n\nend if\n\nThen, proceed to check the value of digit[i], which is now 0.\n\nWait, then, after that, the code checks if digits[i] <5, handles else if ==5, else (greater or equal 5?), but wait let's look at the code.\n\nOriginal code after handling 10:\n\nif (digits[i] <5) then \n\n    bills += digits[i]\n\nelif digits[i] ==5:\n\n    if (digits[i+1] >=5):\n\n        digits[i+1] +=1\n\n    bills +=5\n\nelse (digits[i] >=6?):\n\n    digits[i+1] +=1\n\n    bills += (10 - digits[i])\n\nWait the un-indented code after that.\n\nWait the original code:\n\nIn the loop over i from 0 to len (number.length()):\n\nWait let's step through:\n\nthe code's branches in pseudo-code:\n\nfor i in 0 to L (L is number length):\n\n    if digits[i] = 10 \n\n        carry over to i+1, set to 0.\n\n    now check digits[i]:\n\n    if <5 \u2192 add to bills \n\n    elif 5:\n\n        if next digit (i+1) >=5 \u2192 increment it, then add 5 \n\n    else: \n\n        (digit[i] is 6-9, so perhaps need to do that 10 - digit[i] as coins?)\n\n        add 10 - digit[i] \u2192 perhaps quarters?\n\nWait I'm not entirely sure about the algorithm, but translating the code line by line is the key now.\n\nSo for the Fortran code, variables:\n\ninteger :: bills =0 \n\ndigits array (size 0...n) initialized with digits from the reversed string. \n\nWait let's set up the variables:\n\nFirst, declare the variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_e\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: num_length\ncharacter(len=100000) :: number\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\ninteger :: i, pos\ninteger :: bills\n\n! Read input\nread(*, '(A)') number\nnum_length = len_trim(number)\n\n! Allocate digits array from 0 to num_length (size num_length+1)\nallocate(digits(0:num_length))\n\n! Initialize digits to 0\ndigits = 0\n\n! Fill the digits with reversed digits\ndo i =0, num_length-1\n    pos = num_length -i \n    digits(i) = ichar(number(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\nend do\n\n! Now process each digit for bills\nbills =0\n\ndo i =0, num_length\n    if (digits(i) ==10 ) then\n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n        digits(i) =0\n    end if\n\n! Now check the current digit[i] value\n\n    if (digits(i) <5 ) then\n        bills = bills + digits(i)\n    else if (digits(i) ==5 ) then\n        if (digits(i+1) >=5 ) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n        end if\n        bills = bills +5\n    else \n        ! digits(i) >=6 \n        digits(i+1) = digits(i+1)+1\n        bills = bills + (10 - digits(i))\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) bills\nend program atcoder_abc155_e\n\nWait, but there's an issue in the first part.\n\nWait the loop to read digits: for i from 0 to num_length-1:\n\ndigits(i) are set. But the digits array is up to num_length (the digit(num_length) is initialized as 0. So the rest (digit[i] for i beyond the digits in the input would be zero.\n\nWait that's fine. \n\nAnother thing: The second loop is from i=0 to num_length (inclusive). Because the digits array has size 0 to num_length. The digits(i) for i from 0 up to num_length (the loop goes to num_length).\n\nBut when i is num_length (the last element in the array), the case when we check 'digits[i+1]' (digits(num_length+1)), which is out of bounds. Because the array is allocated up to num_length. \n\nAh! This is a problem. \n\nIn the original Java code, the array has length number.length() +1, so digits[number.length()] is available.\n\nIn Fortran, the digits arrays is zero based, and the java's digits array has size n+1 (java's number.length()+1), so in Fortran, allocated from 0 to num_length (so size num_length+1 elements, which matches). \n\nHowever, in the bills processing loop when i reaches num_length (the final index), then digits(i+1) refers to digits(num_length+1), which is one beyond the array's upper limit (since it's allocated up to num_length).\n\nThat's an off-by-one error.\n\nAh, so what's the maximum i?\n\nIn the original Java code, loop runs till number.length()\n\nThe java array is [0... number.length()], so when i is number.length(), then digits[i+1] would reference digits[number.length()+1], but that's beyond the array (number.length()+1 elements?), so that would be an error. Wait that can't be right. Wait perhaps the original code has an error here?\n\nWait original java code:\n\narray size is number.length() +1 \u2192 indices 0 to number.length(), which is the right size.\n\nIn the loop for i from 0 to number.length(), since the array has that size, the maximum i is the length (so digits[i+1] would be digits[number.length()+1], which is out of bound. Wait that can't be. So perhaps the original Java code has an error?\n\nLooking at the original Java code again:\n\ndigits is declared as:\n\nint[] digits = new int[number.length() + 1];\n\nso the size is length+1, so indices 0 to length, inclusive.\n\nThe loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0; i <= number.length(); i++)\n\nso i runs from 0 to the number.length() (included), which is exactly the upper bound of the array.\n\nThen, in their loop:\n\nif (digits[i] == 10 \u2192 digits[i+1]++\n\nWait when i is length (the last index of the array), then i+1 is length+1 which is beyond the array's size. So that would be an error in the original code?\n\nWait is this a mistake?\n\nLooking at the code details:\n\nWait, when i reaches number.length(), since digits has a size of number.length()+1, so when i is number.length(), digits[i] is valid, but digits[i+1] is gone. \n\nTherefore, the original code is wrong here. Or maybe in the original logic, it is assumed that when i equals the last index, digits[i+1] would not be accessed?\n\nLooking deeper into the code:\n\nPerhaps the code is designed for:\n\nThe loop runs to number.length(), but I think the digits[i+1] for the last i could be over the array?\n\nHmm, this must be a bug.\n\nWait let's see the code step by step. Let's consider when i is the last element (i = L where number.length() = L). \n\nAt that iteration of the loop:\n\ndigits[i] is digits[L] (the last element of the array). \n\nIf we are in a case where, for example, we are processing a carry over, the 'digits[L] =10' case?\n\nWait suppose:\n\ndigits[L] is 10 (how?), then the code will add digits[L+1], but L+1 is beyond the array. So this is a bug in Java code?\n\nWait this suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the original Java code, and thus in the translation, the same bug could lead to an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is functional because in some cases the array is sufficiently long?\n\nWait perhaps the problem is that the code is meant to process, and the loop over the first L+1 elements.\n\nWait perhaps the original code in Java might not actually reach those problematic cases, maybe due to the way digits are updated.\n\nWait, let's think about the purpose of the code. Maybe the problem is to compute the minimal number of coins for some denomination system. The algorithm may be handling digits through base 10, with some rounding?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's check for digits[i]==10 is only possible if i reaches a point before i = maximum.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's possible that in processing earlier digits, digits[i+1] may have carried over but not gone beyond the array. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when i reaches the last digit (index number.length(), then digits[i] can never be 10 except when there was a carry from the previous step?\n\nWait, in any case, the code is susceptible to an index out of bounds here, but since the user is asking to translate the code, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that it works.\n\nSo in Fortran, the array has indices from 0 to num_length (inclusive), so size of (num_length+1). Thus, the loop runs from 0 to num_length, and for i=num_length, digits(i+1) would be digits(num_length+1) which is out of bounds. That is not allowed in Fortran.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the digits array needs to be one larger? Or perhaps the loop in the bills processing should run up to num_length -1 ?\n\nWait that might be a problem in the original code. Let's think:\n\nAt the code's first step (the array is allocated with size number_length+1 in Java, but the digits array is [0 ... L ), when processing i= L (the index last element) then digits[i] is in the array, but digits[i+1] is not.\n\nThis is a bug. So perhaps in Java, it will produce an array index out of bounds error when i is the last index?\n\nWait maybe the original problem statement has constraints on input.\n\nWait maybe the problem is in code that the digits[i+1] can only be accessed when that is necessary but in an event that isn't possible in that loop?\n\nHmm, this is difficult to tell. Perhaps I'll need to proceed, but handle the case in Fortran to prevent accessing the array beyond its upper bound.\n\nWait in the loop for i =0 to num_length:\n\nif when we check digits[i+1], it's possible only when i+1 < size. So in Fortran, to handle that:\n\ndigits(i+1) = ... \n\nwhen i = number_length, it would be digits(number_length +1) which is beyond the allocated array (allocated to number_length indices).\n\nThus, the array must be of size 0 to number_length +1.\n\nWait wait, perhaps in Fortran we should allocate digits(0:num_length +1), making it size number_length +2.\n\nWait then the maximum i would be number_length, so i+1 would be up to (number_length +1), allowed if array is up to there.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose in Java the code's digits array has size L +1 (so from 0 to L including), but after processing the loop, which can have a carry from index L to L+1 which is out of bound.\n\nThus, it is incorrect.\n\nHence to resolve, in Fortran, the digits array should be allocated as 0 to number_length +1 (so num_length +2 elements), to allow in the loop when i is L ( the initial upper limit):\n\ndigits(i+1) will be okay.\n\nWait perhaps the original code has a off-by-one mistake, but this is what needs to be translated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop in bills is supposed to iterate from i=0 to num_length-1:\n\nSo the code can be fixed here. For example:\n\nLooking at the code, maybe the initial loop in Java runs until <= number.length(), but the code in the problem is actually correct?\n\nWait maybe there is an error here, and thus the code cannot be correctly translated unless we adjust the array size.\n\nIn Fortran, to prevent an out-of-bounds issue, to have digits(0 to num_length +1), so:\n\nnum_length = len_trim(number)\n\nallocate(digits(0:num_length+1)) \u2192 but this is more than Java's original size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to make the digits array one unit larger than the input length plus 1, but that depends on the algorithm.\n\nBut given that we need to translate exactly the Java code structure, perhaps we will increase the digits array by adding another element.\n\nWait changing the code:\n\nIn the Java code, digits[L+1] is accessed when i=L (since L is number.length()), which is the upper bound. Thus the array is so that digits[0...L], so to access digits[L+1], we must have space.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the digits array must be of size 0...L+1. So, need:\n\nnum_length_plus1 = num_length\n\nallocate( digits(0: num_length +1) )\n\nthen in the loop, i can go up to num_length \u2192 so digits(i+1) will go to num_length+1 which is within the array.\n\nWait in that case, the Fortran code should read:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_e\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: num_length\ninteger :: num_length_plus\ncharacter(len=100000) :: number\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: digits\ninteger :: i, pos\ninteger :: bills, L, max_i\n\nread(*, '(A)') number\nnum_length = len_trim(number)\n\n! Need digits from 0 to num_length +1 (since in the Java code, digits needs to go one past)\n! So size 0 to num_LENGTH +1 \u2192  (num_length +2 elements)\n\nallocate( digits(0:num_length+1) )\ndigits = 0\n\ndo i =0, num_length-1\n    pos = num_length -i \n    digits(i) = ichar(number(pos:pos)) - ichar('0')\nend do\n\nbills = 0\n\nmax_i = num_length +1 \u2192 no, the loop over i is 0 to num_length? Wait, in Java it was 0 to number.length(), which is the initial L. So in Fortran:\n\nthe loop still runs from i=0 to num_length (because that was the original limit, but the array can now hold i ranges beyond):\n\ndo i =0, num_length\n\nThen, for i up to num_length, so i+1 can reach up to num_length +1, which is okay.\n\nTherefore, this way the digits will not go out of bounds.\n\nThus, fixing the array size.\n\nHence in the Fortran code, the digits array must be size 0 to num_length+1 (so with an extra element). Thus, the initial code needs this.\n\nAlso, need to adjust the loop to fill the digits array. Since the original for loop filled the digits[0..num_length-1], but in Fortran, the initial loop remains the same as before (the num_length-1 is still okay because that is the original input length's digits.\n\nSo the code needs to adjust the allocation and array limits:\n\nNow rework the Fortran code step by step.\n\nRewriting all:\n\n1) Read the number into a character array. Let's choose a big length, say 100000:\n\n2) num_length is the trimmed length.\n\n3) Allocate digits as (0:num_length+1). So digits can hold the original digits plus one digit.\n\nThen processing steps.\n\nTherefore:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_e\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: number\n    integer :: num_length, i, pos\n    integer, allocatable :: digits(:) \n    integer :: bills\n\n! Read input\n    read(*, '(A)') number\n    num_length = len_trim(number)\n\n! Allocate digits from 0 to num_length+1 (so including one higher than input length)\n    allocate( digits(0: num_length+1) )\n    digits = 0\n\n! Fill the digits array from reversed string\n    do i=0, num_length-1\n        pos = num_length -i \n        digits(i) = ichar( number(pos:pos) ) - ichar('0')\n    end do\n\n! Compute the bills\n    bills =0\n\n    do i=0, num_length\n\n        if (digits(i) == 10) then\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) + 1\n            digits(i) = 0\n        end if\n\n        if (digits(i) <5 ) then\n            bills = bills + digits(i)\n        else if (digits(i) ==5 ) then\n            if( digits(i+1) >=5 ) then\n                digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n            end if\n            bills = bills +5\n        else\n            ! digits(i)>=6\n            digits(i+1) = digits(i+1) +1\n            bills = bills + 10 - digits(i)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*,'(i0)') bills\n\nend program atcoder_abc155_e\n\nWait this way, since the array is now up to num_length+1, then when i runs up to num_length:\n\ndigits(i+1) when i is num_length would be digits(num_length +1), which is allowed because the array has that index.\n\nThus the out-of-bounds issue is fixed.\n\nAdditionally, I must ensure that the first part of filling the digits array correctly. So when i =0 to num_length-1 in the do loop, which for the input digits (which are num_length long), they are stored in digits(0) to digits(num_length-1). The rest (digits(num_length), digits(num_length+1) are 0 (initialized to zero).\n\nThe loop to fill the digits array is correct.\n\nAnother consideration: in Fortran strings, if the length is longer than the allocated string's length, read may truncate. But using a large enough size (100,000) should suffice.\n\nWait, the input might be up to like 1e5 digits (as common in programming contest problems), so using a 100000 length is okay.\n\nNow the code might work.\n\nBut let me check a simple input example.\n\nTest Case 1:\n\nInput \"0\".\n\nJava code:\n\nnum_length =1 \n\ndigits array from 0 to 2 (since in fortan the allocation becomes 0 to1+1 \u21922).\n\nProcessing digits[0] = 0 (since position 1 (num_length -0 =1), then other digits are 0.\n\nThe loop for i from 0 to 1:\n\nFirst iteration, i=0:\n\ndigits(0) is 0. not 10 \u2192 check next conditions.\n\ndigits(0) is 0 <5 \u2192 add 0 to bills. bills now 0.\n\nThen i=1 (original num_length =1):\n\ndigits(1) is 0. check:\n\ndigits(1) not 10 \u2192 <5 \u2192 add 0. bills stay 0.\n\nTotal bills:0 \u2192 correct?\n\nHmm. The original problem requires computing bills. Looking at the problem's logic, I think the input \"0\" would give 0 bills. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"5\"\n\nIn Java:\n\ndigits (for length 1+1 =2).\n\ndigits[0] =5 (Reversed: the first character is '5', so i=0 \u2192 pos =1-0 =1 \u2192 the first character is '5' \u2192 correct.\n\nLoop runs from i=0 to 1 (num_length=1):\n\ni=0:\n\ndigits[0] is5 \u2192 so code enters '==5' condition.\n\ndigits[i+1] is digits[1], which is 0. which is <5 \u2192 so no increment. So we add 5 to bills \u2192 5.\n\nThen i=1:\n\ndigits[1] is0 \u2192 bills +=0 \u2192 total 5.\n\nWhich would be correct.\n\nHmm that seems right.\n\nWait the Java code's answer for input '5' is 5?\n\nWait looking at the other condition:\n\nIf the digit is 5, then:\n\nif the next digit is >=5 \u2192 increment next digit?\n\nBut in this case, the next digit is 0 \u2192 the conditional is false, so we add bills +=5 \u2192 total 5.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother example: input \"14\"\n\nOriginal code:\n\nnumber length is 2 \u2192 digits array 0..3.\n\ndigits[0] =4 (from second char '4'), digits[1] =1 (from first char '1'), digits[2]=digits[3]=0.\n\nProcessing:\n\nLoop i from0,1,2 (num_length is 2, so loop up to 2 (since it runs up to i=num_length which is 2):\n\ni=0:\n\ndigit[0] is4. <5 \u2192 add 4 \u2192 bills=4.\n\nNext i=1:\n\ndigit[1] is1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 5.\n\ni=2 (digits[2] is0 \u2192 add 0. \n\nTotal 5.\n\nWait wait the example input \"14\" should be calculated as:\n\nThe number is 14.\n\nProcessing each digit in reverse: 4 (1s place, digit[0]), 1 (digit[1}.\n\nProcessing:\n\nfor i=0:\n\ndigit[0] is4 \u2192 add 4 \u2192 bills=4.\n\ni=1: digit(1) 1 \u2192 add1 \u2192 total 5.\n\nThe total bills is5.\n\nSo correct.\n\nNow, if input is '15':\n\nWhich is '15' reversing as 5,1.\n\ndigits[0] is5, digit[1]=1, digit[2] is0.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: digit is5 \u2192 check next digit (digit[1] =1 which is <5 \u2192 so add 5 \u2192 bills=5.\n\ni=1: digit is1 \u2192 add 1 \u2192 total=6. \n\nTotal is6.\n\nBut what is the correct answer?\n\nHmm what is the intended algorithm calculating?\n\nThe problem might be the minimal number of coins for some denomination system. For example, maybe the coins are for 1 divider (maybe the problem is like the competition problem, but since the user did not explain, it's hard to say. \n\nBut regardless, the Java code is translatable.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as above should be correct.\n\nAnother possible error is with the loops and array lengths. But I think with the array allocation fixed, the code should work."
