    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to translate this Java code to Fortran. Hmm, starting with the structure of the code. The main function is reading some inputs and then doing some loops. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, in Java they're using Scanner to get input. In Fortran, I should use a read statement, probably in a loop. The code is inside a while loop that continues while there's input, but in Fortran, it might be better to handle this as a loop that breaks if the read fails, maybe using end=file?\n\nThe variables are declared: n is an integer, then arrays a and b each of length n. In Fortran arrays are declared as dimension(n), so that's straightforward.\n\nThe code initializes b to 0, which in Fortran can be done with a loop or an assignment. The variable s starts at -1. \n\nThen there's a while loop that continues until q equals n. Inside, the main part is alternating between processing from the beginning or end of the array, toggling the direction with 'tem'. \n\nWait, in Java, 'tem' is a flag (1 and 0) to determine the direction. In Fortran, since 1 is true and 0 false, maybe it's better to use a logical variable here. But integers can work too. So when tem is 1, iterate from first element, else backwards.\n\nThe loops check for elements where a[i] is <= q and b[i] is 0. If so, they set b[i] to 1 and increment q. Each pass through the direction-based loop contributes to q, and once q reaches n, the loop stops.\n\nLet me structure the equivalent Fortran code.\n\nFirst, declare the main variables. Maybe like:\n\ninteger :: n, a(n), b(n)\ninteger :: s, tem, q\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays must be dimensioned with a fixed size unless we use allocatable arrays. But since the code loops until all elements are read, which depends on n given first, perhaps we need to read n first each time. But in Java, they read n first in the loop. Wait, the Java code is inside a loop: while (in.hasNext()), so it might loop for multiple test cases? Or maybe it reads once and the next inputs form part of the single test case? Let me check the problem context.\n\nProblem 583B from Codeforces? Let me think. The problem says you have a sequence a and want to determine the number of steps to sort, somehow. Anyway, in the given code, the outer loop is while in.hasNext(), implying that it processes multiple test cases. However, in Codeforces problems, sometimes each test case is a single input, so the code is probably processing each test case each iteration of the loop.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the outer loop is while(in.hasNext()). Each time it reads n, then reads n elements for a. When the end of input comes, hasNext() returns false, so the loop exits. So in Fortran, we need to read until end of file.\n\nHmm, Fortran doesn't have a direct hasNext(), but you can read into an array and check for end of file.\n\nSo in Fortran, the structure would be something like:\n\ndo\n    read *, n\n    if (n == 0) exit  ! Not sure, but need to handle EOF.\n    allocate(a(n), b(n))\n    read *, a(1:n)\n    ... do processing ...\n    print*, s\n    deallocate a,b\nend do\n\nWait, but in Codeforces, input is usually all at once. So maybe, for the problem's sake, each test case is a single line with n followed by n numbers. So in the Fortran code, we can loop reading the inputs until end of file.\n\nBut Fortran arrays can be tricky because their dimensions are fixed, so using allocatable arrays is better here.\n\nSo in Fortran the variables are declared as allocatable, after reading n, we can allocate arrays of size n.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nThe variables needed:\n\n- integer :: n, a(:), b(:), s, tem, q\n\nInside the loop:\n\nRead n, then read the array a elements.\n\nInitialize b to 0, except maybe all elements set to 0 with a loop.\n\nWait, Fortran has an intrinsic way to set arrays. Maybe b = 0.\n\nThen initialize q =0, s = -1, tem =1.\n\nThen loop while q < n:\n\n   increment s.\n\n   If tem is 1 (then we go forward):\n\n        loop i from 1 to n\n\n            if a(i) <= q and b(i) ==0, set b(i)=1 and q +=1\n\n        then tem =0\n\n    else (tem is 0, so backward direction):\n\n        loop i from n downto 1\n\n            if same condition, set b(i)=1, q +=1\n\n        then tem =1\n\nWait the code in Java checks for 'a[i] <= q' but when you process an element, you set it as processed and add to q (the count?), so the idea is that you mark elements that can be taken.\n\nWait in Java's code, q starts at 0, and for each element found in a cycle, the q increments, but in each direction pass, each found element increases q.\n\nWait the Java code's loop steps are:\n\nInitially, q is 0. s increments each full pass (both directions?), but until q reaches n.\n\nThe code in each step (each s iteration) alternates between left to right and right to left, and in each direction, processes the elements that meet a[i]<= current q and unmarked.\n\nOnce all are processed, the steps (s) count how many passes it took.\n\nHmm, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nNow in Fortran code translation:\n\nWe need a loop that continues until q equals n.\n\nThe tem is toggled between 1 and 0. The loops:\n\nWhen direction is 1 (first step is forward, then backward and so on)\n\nWait, in code tem starts at 1.\n\nFirst loop runs, if tem is 1 (then direction is forward) then iterate from 1 to n:\n\nCheck for each i, if a(i) <= current q and not marked (b(i)=0), then mark and add to q.\n\nAfter that, set tem to 0.\n\nThen next s cycle: else branch is taken (since tem is 0), loop from n downto 1, same condition, etc.\n\nWait in Fortran loops:\n\nfor forward direction:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    if ( ...  ) then\n\nso this would be the equivalent of the java loops.\n\nBut in Java, in each direction, the code checks each element and marks as many as possible, adding to q.\n\nWait, in each direction loop (left-right or right-left), all eligible elements are processed and incremented q.\n\nThe for loops in Java are not exiting early, so they process all elements in order, setting any eligible elements. The q increases each time a candidate is found, and in each step of the loop the q is the previous value.\n\nWait, this is crucial. Because q is being updated in the same loop as when it is being checked.\n\nWait for example: in the forward loop:\n\nInitially q is, say, 5. Then, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nif a[i] <= q (the earlier value of 5), then we can process and increment q to 6,7 etc.\n\nSince q is updated in the loop, the same a[i] that was eligible becomes even more eligible?\n\nWait the code's logic here is that the eligible is a[i] <= q (before checking the step), so the increments cause subsequent elements in the loop to be considered with the updated q?\n\nNo: Because in the for loop over i, regardless of q changes, when the condition a[i] <= q is checked, the q is the current value as of that iteration.\n\nHmm, but in the Java loops, for example in the forward direction:\n\nFirst, set q to the initial value. Then, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    if (a[i] <= current q) { process; q becomes new value, but in the next element of the for loop for that i+1, the new q is considered}\n\nSo the elements are processed in left to right or right to left order, each time during that pass, the maximum a[i] that can contribute.\n\nWait this actually makes sense in the problem's logic.\n\nFor the problem, the a array represents required previous elements counts?\n\nSo in each step of the big loop (each s increment):\n\nFirst, direction is forward or backward. The process is to scan through the array according to direction, and select any elements which have a value <= the current total q. Those can be marked and added (so their a is taken into account, so when the next steps run, their a[i] allows higher q).\n\nWait the problem must be something like building a sequence where the current element a[i] must be less than or equal to number taken before. And we process in rounds, alternating direction, taking the first eligible in each direction.\n\nHmm but now back to code.\n\nIn Fortran, need to ensure the same conditions:\n\nEach time in a direction pass (say, forward), the loop goes through each element in order, checking if a(i) <= q (current q before processing the loop). Wait no, in each element's check, the current q could have been updated by earlier elements in the same loop run. \n\nBecause in Java, in the same for loop in the direction, each element's processing can increase q, so the next iterations in the same direction's loop check with the updated q?\n\nYes, that's correct. So the Java code in one loop run (forward direction), iterates elements in order, and checks each a[i] against the current q. For that element, if yes, then they increase q before moving on. \n\nThis matters because what can happen in the next elements in the direction loop.\n\nIn Fortran, this logic is preserved.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran loops:\n\nThe first thing is to replicate the inner loops correctly.\n\nLet me outline the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the structure:\n\nDo while loop to process each test case (until EOF):\n\nRead n:\n\nallocate arrays a and b.\n\nread a's elements.\n\ninitialize variables.\n\nStart processing:\n\n    q = 0\n\n    s = -1\n\n    tem = 1\n\n    do while ( q /= n )\n\n         s = s +1\n\n         if ( tem == 1 ) then\n\n             'forward' loop:\n\n             do i = 1, n\n\n                   if ( a(i) <= q ) then\n\n                       if ( b(i) ==0 ) then\n\n                           b(i) = 1\n\n                           q = q + 1\n\n                       end if\n\n                   end if\n\n             end do\n\n             tem = 0\n\n         else\n\n             'backward' loop:\n\n             do i = n, 1, -1\n\n                   if (a(i) <= q) then\n\n                       if (b(i) ==0 ) then\n\n                           b(i) =1\n\n                           q = q +1\n\n                       end if\n\n                   end if\n\n             end do\n\n             tem =1\n\n         end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print the s.\n\n    deallocate arrays.\n\nEnd loop.\n\nWait but the condition in the Java code for the while loop is while (q != n). So in Fortran, the loop is:\n\ndo while ( q .ne. n )\n\nInside, after each direction loop.\n\nWait the loop structure could have the s increment at the top.\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nwhile(q !=n):\n\n   s++;\n\n   if(tem ==1) then process forward.\n\nSo that's same as:\n\ninitial s is -1. When you enter while loop, first s increments to 0.\n\nThe code structure in fortran:\n\n    q =0; s= -1; tem =1;\n\n    do while ( q .ne. n )\n\n        s = s +1\n\n        .. direction loop halves\n\n    end do\n\nWait the loop condition breaks when q == n.\n\nYes, so the code structure is correct.\n\nNow, the variables and allocation in Fortran need allocatable arrays, or using arrays with proper dynamic memory.\n\nIn Fortran, you can have allocatable arrays. Let me structure the code accordingly.\n\nStarting with the main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_583_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, s, q, tem, i, ierr\n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n\n    logical ok\n\n    ! Read multiple test cases until end of file.\n\n    ok = .true.\n\n    do\n\n        read(*,*, iostat= ierr) n\n\n        if(ierr <0 ) exit  ! Assuming EOF.\n\n        allocate(a(n), b(n))\n\n        read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n)\n\n        b =0\n\n        s = -1\n\n        q =0\n\n        tem =1\n\n        do while (q <n )\n\n            s = s +1\n\n            if(tem ==1 ) then\n\n                ! forward loop.\n\n                do i=1, n\n\n                    if( a(i) <= q .and. b(i)==0 ) then\n\n                        b(i)=1\n\n                        q = q +1\n\n                    end if\n\n                end do\n\n                tem =0\n\n            else\n\n                ! backward\n\n                do i =n,1, -1\n\n                    if( a(i) <= q .and. b(i)==0 ) then\n\n                        b(i)=1\n\n                        q = q +1\n\n                    end if\n\n                end do\n\n                tem =1\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        print*, s\n\n        deallocate( a, b )\n\n    end do\n\nend program codeforces_583_B\n\nHmm, let's check for necessary parts.\n\nWait, the 'and' operator in Fortran uses the .and. operator for logicals. The condition a(i) <=q and b(i)==0 is correct as written.\n\nWait in Fortran, to set the entire array b to 0, the line 'b=0' works because it is an allocatable array of integers.\n\nBut we have to make sure that after allocation, the array is initialized to zero.\n\nAlternatively, using a loop to set each element to zero, but array assignment is better.\n\nYes, b=0 is fine.\n\nThe loop over the test cases uses read with iostat to detect end-of-file. The code reads n, and if that read is EOF (iostat error, but negative) then exit.\n\nWait, in the initial read for n: if there's input available, it will read, else the EOF error will have ierr <0. The loop then will terminate. Otherwise continue.\n\nThe reads for a's array need to read n integers into a. Then processing.\n\nThe code after processing will print s once per test case.\n\nI think this should be the correct code. Need to test for any off-by-one errors since indices in Fortran are 1-based.\n\nIn Java, arrays were 0-based, so the loops in Java were from i=0 to n-1. In Fortran, it's from 1 to n, so the indices line up.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nLet me see edge cases. Suppose n=1.\n\nThen q starts as 0. The first iteration:\n\ns becomes 0. Since tem is 1 (first time), loop forward.\n\ni=1, check a(1) <=0.\n\nAssuming a(1)=0: then set to 1, q becomes 1, so loop exits, s=0, correct.\n\nWait in the code, if the a is [0], then:\n\nFirst, in first pass (tem=1, s increments from -1 to 0). Within forward loop, a(1)=0 <= q (0), so set b=1, q becomes 1. So after first iteration, q equals n=1, so loop ends.\n\nThus S is 0, correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=2 and the a array is [1,0].\n\nSo first pass: tem is 1 (forward direction):\n\nCheck each:\n\nfirst element (a(1)=1 <= 0? no. So skip.\n\nSecond element (a=0 <=0 ? yes: set b to 1, q becomes 1.\n\nThus after first iteration (s=0), q is now 1. Then the next iteration of the do-while loop (since q is not 2 yet).\n\nNext, s increments to 1. tem was set to 0 (after first loop was forward direction, so tem is now 0. So the next iteration is backward loop.\n\nLoop from i=2 down to 1.\n\nFirst i=2: already processed (b=1), so skip.\n\ni=1: a(1) is 1 <=1 (current q is 1). So check, b is 0. So mark it, q becomes 2.\n\nThen after the backward loop's processing, q becomes 2, so the do-while loop ends.\n\nThus s =1. Which would be the correct result.\n\nThe code's S after two cycles (from s=0 and up to s=1) is correct.\n\nThus seems the code works. The variables are correctly initialized, and logic follows.\n\nNow, putting it all together with proper Fortran syntax.\n\nOne thing: in Fortran, when you read a(1:n) with the code above, the line 'read (*, *) (a(i), i=1,n)' reads all elements in sequential order.\n\nAlternatively, we could do 'read (*,*) a' since once allocated to n elements, it can read directly into the array. So 'read(*,*) a' instead of using a loop. That might be simpler.\n\nYes, better:\n\nAfter allocate(a(n), b(n)), then:\n\nread(*,*) a\n\nThen all elements read in a(1) to a(n).\n\nSo replacing that would make the code shorter.\n\nThus the code becomes:\n\nprogram codeforces_583_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, s, q, tem, i, ierr\n\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:), b(:)\n\n    do\n\n        read(*,*, iostat= ierr) n\n\n        if(ierr <0 ) exit\n\n        allocate(a(n), b(n))\n\n        read(*,*) a\n\n        b =0\n\n        s = -1\n\n        q =0\n\n        tem =1\n\n        do while (q /= n)\n\n            s = s +1\n\n            if(tem ==1 ) then\n\n                do i=1, n\n\n                    if( a(i) <= q .and. b(i)==0 ) then\n\n                        b(i)=1; q = q +1\n\n                    end if\n\n                end do\n\n                tem =0\n\n            else\n\n                do i =n,1, -1\n\n                    if( a(i) <= q .and. b(i)==0 ) then\n\n                        b(i)=1; q = q +1\n\n                    end if\n\n                end do\n\n                tem =1\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        print*, s\n\n        deallocate(a,b)\n\n    end do\n\nend program codeforces_583_B\n\nThis should be a correct translation."
