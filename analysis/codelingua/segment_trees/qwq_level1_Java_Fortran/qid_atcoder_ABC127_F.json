So the pqmin's elements are all the smaller elements, and the current min is kept as that top, so inserting when the in is greater than this min would go into the upper heap.

So the command can be of form \"1 x b\", where x is the integer 'in' and then s[2] is the 'b' value added to sumb. Then the 'in' parameter is used for the heaps. Wait the problem may be that the code in Java has variables sumb (which is a long variable), which is accumulating the s[2] parts when processing a \"1\" command. But the sumMin and sumMax are also accumulating the in (the s[1] part).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the code does. The main thing is that it's handling some kind of priority queue operations. The Java code uses two PriorityQueues: pqmax and pqmin. Wait, but in Java, the default for PriorityQueue is min-heap. Oh right, pqmin uses a comparator to reverse it, making it act like a max-heap.\n\nWait no, actually, the pqmax is a normal min-heap and pqmin is a max-heap because of the comparator. So the structure is similar to a max-heap and a min-heap arrangement, but arranged so that the elements are partitioned such that all elements in the max-heap (pqmin) are less than or equal to the elements in the pqmax, maybe? Wait, actually, looking at the code logic, it's keeping the elements in such a way that the min (the top of pqmin) is the median or something. Because min is assigned to the peek of pqmin, so that's the smallest in the pqmin? Wait, since pqmin is a max-heap, because of the comparator that's comparing y - x. Wait, for comparison in a heap, a comparator that returns y - x would sort them in reverse. So the pqmin is actually acting as a max-heap.\n\nAh right. So the two heaps are managing the upper part and lower part, but the pqmin (max-heap) holds the smaller half, and pqmax (min-heap) holds the upper half? Because in the Java code's initializer of pqmin, the comparator is new Comparator where compare is y - x, meaning that the elements are stored in reverse order. So inserting an element into pqmin would put the largest elements at the top. Where's the median being tracked here?\n\nThe variable min is actually the current minimum of the all elements? Because it's set to pqmin.peek(). Wait, pqmin is a max-heap, so the top of pqmin is the largest element in the lower half, so if the heaps are balanced, that would be the median. Or perhaps not exactly. The code's variable 'min' is being tracked as the top of pqmin, which is the largest of the lower half.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, the min variable is being updated to be the peek of pqmin. Since pqmin is a max-heap, the top is the maximum of the min elements (lower half), so that would be the median's lower part? So 'min' variable tracks the current minimum of all? No, that can't be right. Maybe the 'min' variable is actually the median? Hmm, this might require a bit deeper look into the code's functionality.\n\nThe code processes each of the test cases (t times), and for each line, if the first character starts with '2', it calculates some value. Let me see: \n\nIn the '2' case, the code computes an answer using min multiplied by the size of pqmin minus sumMin, then analogously for the other heap and the sumb. The reason why they need to track sumMin and sumMax might be to track the total of all elements in each heap. \n\nThe code for '1' cases (adding elements) does something like inserting into one of the heaps, and then balancing them so they are equal in size or differing by at most one. The elements are being partitioned so that pqmin's elements are all <= those in pqmax? Because when an element is added, they decide based on the current min's value whether to add to pqmax or pqmin. If in > min, then pqmax (the upper) gets it; else, to the lower. \n\nSo whenever adding a new element, they check if it's greater than the current min (which is the top of pqmin, which is the largest in the lower heap). So if the element is larger than that min, it goes to pqmax (upper), else into pqmin (lower). But since pqmin is a max-heap, the smallest of its elements would be at the bottom, but the top is the largest in the lower. \n\nThe balancing step after insertion ensures that the two heaps are kept balanced. When one becomes more than the other, they move elements between heaps. The condition after inserting checks if pqmin size is larger than pqmax's; if so, a transfer from pqmin to pqmax. Then, if it's smaller, transferring other way.\n\nThe purpose is to maintain the heaps in such a way that the top of the lower (max-heap) is the current minimum of the combined elements? Or the median, perhaps. But in any case, in the '2' operation, they calculate using the current min (the top of pqmin, which is the median?), and then compute some total.\n\nNow translating this into Fortran. The main challenge here is that Fortran doesn't have built-in priority queues. I'll need to implement a heap structure manually.\n\nFirst, I'll need to plan how to replace the Java priority queues. Since both are priority queues with different behaviors, for pqmax (the one that's a min-heap), and pqmin (which is a max-heap). So I need two heaps:\n\n- The pqmax is a min-heap (since natural order for integers is min-heap)\n- The pqmin is a max-heap. \n\nTherefore, need two arrays and manually manage them with heap operations.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based but I can choose to use them as 0-based as needed. Need to implement the heap functions.\n\nBut this is a lot of work. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the elements in the two heaps (pqmax and pqmin) need to be stored in arrays, along with their sizes.\n\nAlso, the variables sumMin and sumMax track the total of elements in each heap. The min is the top of the pqmin (max-heap's top is the maximum element in the lower heap, which is the 'min' here. Wait, but why is that the current min? Hmm. Because the pqmin contains all elements less than or equal to the current min? Because before adding, they check if the element is bigger than the current min, then it goes to the upper pqmax. Wait, no. Wait, when adding an element in step '1', the code does:\n\nif (in > min) { add to pqmax else to pqmin }\n\nso the elements going to pqmin are all elements that are <= the current min before the insertion. Then after inserting, they balance heaps. \n\nWait I'm not sure. So the current min is set as the top (peek) of the pqmin (which is the max of the lower heap). So the pqmin's elements are all the smaller elements, and the current min is kept as that top, so inserting when the in is greater than this min would go into the upper heap. So the lower heapq, pqmin via max-heap, actually holds the lower elements, but the current min (the median?) is the top of that heap. So the 'min' variable is the median? Because the two heaps are kept balanced such that the median is the top of the lower heap when their sizes are balanced.\n\nThus, the code is probably maintaining a dynamic median, and upon certain commands, outputs that. \n\nNow the code's Fortran translation requires the following structures:\n\n- The two heaps (pqmax, pqmin as max and min heaps)\n\nImplementing these heaps in Fortran requires arrays for each heap's data. So let's plan the data structures:\n\nThe arrays for the heaps:\n\n- The pqmax array holds integers (since Java uses Integer). Since Fortran variables are fixed size, and the problem size isn't specified but assuming 32-bit integers is enough.\n\nSimilarly for the pqmin array.\n\nWe'll also need arrays to store the elements of each heap, and variables tracking their current size, capacities, sum, etc. But since reallocating arrays in Fortran can be tricky, perhaps use a large enough initial size. Or dynamically grow, but that's a pain. Alternatively, use an initial guess of the maximum required size, say the problem allows 1e5 elements (but in code golfing might not know). Since this is an online judge problem, perhaps read input incrementally but the original code uses queues, so their size can vary. The initial problem uses Java, which uses arrays backed with Array implementations for PriorityQueues, but each heap may need to be implemented with a dynamic array. Alternatively, maybe we can use a fixed array of a large enough size (like 1e6 or so) to avoid dynamic expansion. Let's pick that.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can do dynamic arrays with allocatable. So let's start by defining:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: max_heap, min_heap\nand similarly for other variables.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, you can have dynamic arrays. Let's consider.\n\nFirst, let's plan variables:\n\nWe have two heaps, each implemented as arrays, with their current size. So for each heap, we can have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: qmax(:), qmin(:) \n\nintegers to track their current sizes, say, size_max and size_min.\n\nThe initial heap can be allocated with some maximum size, say 10^6.\n\nBut when pushed to exceeding that, realloc. Hmm, perhaps do it incrementally with reallocation when necessary. Not sure. Alternatively, just declare a sufficiently large size to handle all test cases. Well, there are coding competition constraints, but assuming that the maximum number of elements in the heaps over all test cases is manageable. Let's set an initial capacity, say 1e5 elements, and use allocatable arrays that can grow as needed. But in practice, it's easier to allocate a large enough array once. Let me think.\n\nThe core of the heaps is their array storage. Let's proceed.\n\nImplement the heap with the following functions:\n\nFor the max_heap (pqmin's behavior):\n\n- insert into max_heap: (add element to heap and heapify-up)\n- extract_max: (remove top, replace with last element, heapify down)\n\nWait right. Both heaps need to support the following operations:\n\nFor pqmax (min-heap):\n\nFunctions:\n\npush( element )\n\npop_min (extract the smallest element)\n\npeek_min (get the smallest element)\n\nFor pqmin (max-heap):\n\npush( element )\n\npop_max (extract the largest element (since it's a max-heap))\n\npeek_max (get the largest element)\n\nSo, to implement this in Fortran, the heaps will be arrays, and then the heap operations need to be written as subroutines or functions.\n\nAlternatively, given time constraints, perhaps we can code all the required heaping functions inline, but that's quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the list storage with another approach. Let's tackle the code structure first. The code structure in Fortran will need to have the main program and the heap arrays.\n\nWait, the Java code has two PriorityQueues. The two heaps will be stored as arrays, and their respective heaps need to be maintained with their indices.\n\nFirst, initial plan:\n\nVariables to be used in Fortran:\n\n- Input variables: the test cases t, and for each line, the command, in and b (assuming command 1 has two nums, command 2 has none? Wait the Java code in line 'else' (command starts with '1'), they parse s[1] and s[2]. Because each command is either \"2\" (doesn't have parameters, but in the Java code's 'else' clause, s has elements from splitting by spaces. So commands '1' would have parameters. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the Java code's 'else' case (when not '2'), they do:\n\nint in = Integer.parseInt(s[1]);\n\nsumb += Long.parseLong(s[2]);\n\nWait the s array would be split from a line, which is for the add case. So the command can be of form \"1 x b\", where x is the integer 'in' and then s[2] is the 'b' value added to sumb. Then the 'in' parameter is used for the heaps.\n\nWait the problem may be that the code in Java has variables sumb (which is a long variable), which is accumulating the s[2] parts when processing a \"1\" command. But the sumMin and sumMax are also accumulating the in (the s[1] part). The final output in the '2' case is the current min (the median?) plus some calculation involving the total of the elements in the heaps minus some other calculations.\n\nWait, the 'else' branch handles adding a new element with 'in' being the \"x\" for that command (s[1]), and sumb is a accumulated value of the second parameter in the \"1\" commands, since sumb starts at 0 and each \"1\" command adds Long of s[2]. So sumb is the sum of those s[2] parameters. So in Fortran, variables would need to track all these.\n\nBut back to heaps.\n\nSo for the two heaps:\n\n- The max Heap (pqmin in Java, which is the one with comparator reversed to make it max) --> max_heap. So the root element is the maximum of the lower elements.\n\n- The min Heap (pqmax in Java which is a normal min heap). The root is the minimum of the upper elements.\n\nThus, the Fortran code will need heap structures for these.\n\nFirst, plan for each heap.\n\nThe max-heap (min_heap in Java's pqmin is now our max_heap array):\n\nImplementation:\n\nThe array for max_heap, say, M array, and its current size.\n\nThe functions would be:\n\npush: inserts the new element into the array and then performs bubble-up (swaps with parent as long as element is larger than parent)\n\npop_max: Remove the root, replace it with the last element, then heapify down by comparing with children.\n\nSimilarly, for the min-heap (pqmax, which will be a min-heap) will have:\n\npush: inserts, then bubble up, comparing to parent.\n\npop_min: remove root, replace with last element, heapify down (swap with children whichever is smaller).\n\nAdditionally, in Fortran, due to arrays starting at 1, the heap can be implemented with the root at index 1, and children at 2*i and 2*i+1.\n\nBut care must be taken with indices.\n\nNow, to handle the two heaps, I'll write functions for each heap.\n\nFirst, I will need to start with the declarations in the Fortran program:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n    integer, allocatable :: max_heap(:)  ! for the max heap (the lower partition)\n    integer :: size_max = 0\n    integer, allocatable :: min_heap(:)  ! for the min heap (the upper partition)\n    integer :: size_min = 0\n    integer :: t\n    integer :: in, min_val\n    integer :: current_root\n    integer :: command\n    integer :: x, b_val\n    integer :: i\n    integer(8) :: sum_min = 0, sum_max =0, sumb=0\n    character(100) :: line\n    character(10) :: parts(3)\n    integer :: num_parts\n    logical :: reached_eof = .false.\n    ! other variables...\n\n    ! Initialize the heaps to some size\n    allocate( max_heap(100000) )\n    allocate( min_heap(100000) )\n\n    ! read t from input\n    read(*, *, end=100) t\n    ! process each test case.\n    do while ( t > 0 ) \n        line = ' '\n        read(*,\"(A)\", end=100) line\n        parts = split(line)\n        num_parts = number of parts (using split routine?)\n        command = ichar(parts(1)(1:1)) - ichar('0')  ! get the first character of first token's ascii as first digit\n          ! The following depends on how to parse input parts effectively.\n        ! Need a function to split the line into parts (part1, part2, ...)\n        ! So require a helper function split to split a line into array\n        if ( command == 2 ) then\n            ! Compute the output\n            min_val = max_heap(1)  ! peek max_heap (the root)\n                ! Wait, max_heap contains the lower elements, so the root is their maximum (i.e., the median?)\n            ! Then ans = min * size_max \n            ! (Wait original code's code:)\n            ! ans *= pqmin.size();\n            ! ans -= sumMin;\n            ! So in Fortran code variables: size_max is the size of max_heap (equivalent to pqmin.size())\n            ! So ans is min_val * (size_max (number of elements in the max heap (since the max_heap is the lower)))\n            ! (because the Java code's PQmin is the lower half, stored in a MAX heap, so its size is size_max)\n            ans_val = min_val * size_max\n            ans_val = ans_val - sum_min\n            ! ans1 is similar for the pqmax (min-heap upper) elements. In Java: ans1 *= pqmax.size; ans1 is sumMax - ( min * ... )\n            ans1_val = 1 * size_min * (sum_max - ( min_val * size_min ) )\n            ! Wait original code:\n            ! long ans1 = min;\n            ! ans1 *= pqmax.size();\n            ! ans1 = sumMax - ans1;\n            So it's (min* pqmax.size - ...)\n            Wait, let me re-look Java code block:\n            long ans1 = min;\n            ans1 *= pqmax.size();\n            ans1 = sumMax - ans1;\n            So ans1 is sum_max - (min * pqmax.size)\n            So in Fortran:\n            ans1_val = sum_max - ( min_val * size_min )\n            total = ans_val + ans1_val + sumb\n            output min_val, and the total.\n            write(*,*) min_val, total\n            ! then decrement t, etc.\n        else if ( command ==1 ) then\n            ! The line has 3 parts (command, in (s[1], the first parameter?), and s(2) for b)\n            x = stringtoi(parts(2) )\n            b_val = stringtoi(parts(3))  ! but parts(3) is a string for a number, but stored as integer (but actually in Java sumb uses Long though, but perhaps the problem requires 64-bit numbers? )\n\n            sumb = sumb + b_val  ! assuming that's an integer (but perhaps in the problem, it's okay)\n            \n            if ( x > min_val ) then\n                ! add to the min-heap (the upper) (pqmax in java is min-heap)\n                call push_min_heap(x)\n                sum_max = sum_max + x\n            else\n                ! add to the max-heap (lower)\n                call push_max_heap(x)\n                sum_min = sum_min + x\n            end if\n\n            ! Now balance the heaps after inserting\n            ! check sizes. The code in JAVA first checks:\n            if ( size_max > size_min ) then\n                ! move top of max_heap to min_heap\n                current_root = max_heap(1)\n                call extract_max() ! remove the max (current root)\n                ! then add to the min_heap\n                call push_min_heap(current_root)\n                ! also adjust the sums:\n                sum_max = sum_max + current_root\n                sum_min = sum_min - current_root\n\n                ! But also, size_max is size_max -1, and size_min +=1\n                \n          else if ( size_max < size_min ) then:\n                ! need to balance to the other way.\n                current_root = min_heap(1)\n                call extract_min()\n                call push_max_heap(current_root)\n                sum_max = sum_max - current_root\n                sum_min = sum_min + current_root\n            end if\n\n            ! After balancing, set min_val to the root of max_heap (since that's the smaller)\n            min_val = max_heap(1)\n        else\n            ! other command?

There are several steps here. First, the split routine, the handling of strings, etc., which is not straightforward in Fortran, especially older versions. Fortran 2003 and above allows some string handling, but perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, read the lines as strings, then parse them manually. For example, the command is the first character of the line, so:\n\nThe input lines after the first line (t) will be lines where the first token is either \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nSo for each line:\n\n- The first token: we need to get its first character. So perhaps read each line as a string, then look at the first character. E.g.:\n\nRead the entire line into a string (e.g., in Fortran, using read(*, '(A)') line), then parse:\n\nIf the line is for command 2, then process that. Else, split the tokens to get the parameters.\n\nBut splitting the line into parts. Since in Fortran, string manipulation is a bit limited, perhaps use a function or intrinsic function to split the string. However, up to 2003, Fortran doesn't have a built-in split function, but we can write a simple one.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nHere is an idea for splitting a string into components:\n\nSuppose line is a character variable (fixed length, say 200).\n\nFunction Split can take the line, and split on spaces, returning an array.\n\nBut implementing that could be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps use list-directed reading.\n\nWait another approach:\n\nAfter reading the line into a string variable, read the tokens using list directed input with a parenthesis. Since in Fortran:\n\nSomething like:\n\nread(line, *, err=1000) values...\n\nBut I think we can use:\n\nSomething like:\n\nSuppose the line is stored in 'line_str'\n\nread(line_str, *, iostat=stat) command, in_value, b_value ? Not sure but for example.\n\nSuppose for example for a line like \"1 3 5\" (the command where in is 3 and b is 5):\n\nread(line, *) command_int, in_value, b_value\n\nBut to do that, have to first concatenate into it or use the list form. Alternatively, the variables can be read directly from the record:\n\nBut when reading from a string, one can do:\n\nBut in modern Fortran, we can do:\n\nread( line_str, *, iostat = stat) vals(1:), ... ?\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan for parsing each line:\n\nAfter reading line into a variable line_str (e.g. of length 1000):\n\nread(line_str, *, err=...) the first number to get the command (digit), then the two parameters (if applicable). For command 2, there are no more parameters. For command 1, there are two integers.\n\nSo in code:\n\n    line = read_line... then:\n\n    read(line_str, *, err=100) val1, val2, val3 etc.\n\n    if (command is 2) then, there is only one value: val1 = 2, and no more.\n\n    else if command is 1, then there are three values: 1, x, b.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, input line reading may ignore leading or trailing spaces etc. So it's manageable.\n\nThis approach is better. Let me try to structure it.\n\nSuppose that after reading the line into line_str, we read the first element (the command):\n\nread(line_str, *, err=100) command, rest_of_data...\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nThe full approach is:\n\n    The code for each line may look like this:\n\n    ! After reading the line_str as a string:\n\n    ! Read the first (only) value for command '2'\n\n    if (command == 2) then\n\n        ! process as case 2\n\n    else if (command == 1):\n\n        read the first number as 1, then in, and b.\n\n    So step:\n\nFirst determine command. Since command's first character is '1' or '2' (the line starts with \"2\" or \"1\").\n\n    ! To parse the first character:\n\n    command_char = line_str(1:1)\n    command = ichar( command_char ) - ichar('0') ! if '1' becomes 1 etc.\n\nBut what about leading spaces? Since per problem constraints (like in algorithm competition), input lines are well-formed, so there will be no leading spaces before the command.\n\nThus:\n\ncommand = ichar( line_str(1:1) ) - ichar('0')\n\nThen, for command 2, the line has no more elements, so proceed.\n\nElse, for command 1:\n\n    The remaining line after the first token can be read as the two numbers: 'in' and 'b'.\n\n    So after extracting command (first character):\n\n    We can process the rest:\n\n    What I can do is:\n\n    Read into a variable the rest of the line after the first character. For example, starting from position 3 (after space?), but this is getting a bit involved.\n\nAlternative code:\n\nAfter obtaining command (1 or 2), we can read the rest of the line with multiple variables.\n\n    For command 2:\n\n        ! no more parameters\n\n    else command 1:\n\n        read (line_str, *, err=1000) command_int, x, b_val \n\n        but since line_str has the line as a string, this works.\n\nWait the first record will be 1, then x, then b_val. But Fortran's READ function will handle that.\n\nThus, the parsing can proceed as follows:\n\n    Once the command is extracted as command_char, then check its value.\n\n    Then read the entire line into variables:\n\n    If the command is 1, the data line has three components (command 1 and two integers):\n\n        read(line_str, *) val1, val2, val3\n\n        command_int = val1 (1)\n\n        in = val2 \n\n        b_val = val3\n\n    else:\n\n        If command is 2, the line will just have 2, so the rest of the line can be ignored.\n\n    Perhaps, better:\n\n    We can try to read all data components into some array, which can handle variable numbers of parameters:\n\n    Declare a variable like, for the line:\n\n    integer, dimension(3) :: params\n\n    Then:\n\n    read(line_str, *, err=...) params(1), params(2), params(3)\n\n    Then, command is params(1):\n\n    if command is 2, then params(2) and params(3) may be unassigned, but that's okay.\n\n    If the command is 1, the params(2) is in, and params(3) is the number to add to sumb (as a double?).\n\n    However, in the problem, the sumb is a long in Java, but in Fortran, using integer(8) (int64) variables.\n\n    So for the 'b' parameter:\n\n    In the code, sumb is declared as a integer(8), and b_val should also be stored in integer(8).\n\n    Therefore in Fortran code:\n\n    Read the third part as:\n\n    integer(8) :: b_val\n\n    etc.\n\n    This suggests:\n\n    Now, to translate into code:\n\nFirst, variables must be properly declared with their types. Let me sketch this.\n\nMain variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: sum_min, sum_max, sumb \n\nThese store the totals of the elements in each heap.\n\ninteger :: size_max ! size of max_heap (the lower heap, stored as a max-heap array)\n\ninteger :: size_min\n\nThe heaps are arrays. Let's use allocatable arrays with, say, 1,000,000 elements each initially. But since the problem size may vary, we need to preallocate or dynamically expand when necessary.\n\nWait, but for the problem's online judge, perhaps the commands can be up to 1e5 steps. So if each step adds at most one element, then each heap can have up to 1e5 elements. Thus, starting with a capacity of 1e5 should suffice, but maybe 2e5 to be safe. Or better, initialize with a buffer size.\n\nFor simplicity, let's initialize the heaps with a dimension of 100000 each.\n\nSo in the program's start:\n\nallocate( max_heap( 10**5 ) )\n\nallocate( min_heap(10**5) )\n\nNow the key functions:\n\nThe heap operations.\n\nFirst, let's implement a max-heap for the lower elements (max_heap array):\n\nThe max-heap functions needed are:\n\n1. push: add to the heap, increasing size_max, then move it up (bubble up) to restore the heap property.\n\n2. extract_max: remove and return the root, replace with last element, then heapify down.\n\nThus, let's code them as subroutines.\n\nFirst, the push subroutine:\n\nSUBROUTINE push_max_heap( x )\n\n    integer :: x\n\n    ! first check if the current array exceeds its size\n\n    ! current size is size_max.\n\n    size_max = size_max + 1\n\n    if ( size_max > size( max_heap ) ) then\n\n        ! Need to resize the array.\n\n        ! But in Fortran, with allocatable arrays, can be done with realloc:\n\n        allocate( temp_array ( 2*size_max ) )\n        temp_array(1:size_max) = max_heap(1:size_max)\n\n        deallocate( max_heap )\n\n        max_heap = temp_array\n\n        deallocate( temp_array ) \n\n    ! not sure of the syntax. Alternatively, perhaps better to just use initial preallocation .\n\nWait, this adds complication. Maybe it's better to preallocate the arrays to 1e5. Since, worst case, the total elements won't exceed 2e5 (thinking of t steps of adding elements to either heap).\n\nLet's suppose each heap has capacity 2e5. But perhaps the initial allocation is 1e5, but when exceeding, increase the size.\n\nAlternatively, just set the initial size to 1e6 elements, which should be enough for online judging problems.\n\nSo initial code:\n\nallocate(max_heap(1000000) )\nallocate( min_heap(1000000) )\n\nAssuming the problem allows for up to 1e6 steps, which is reasonable.\n\nThen:\n\nSubroutine push_max_heap(x)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer :: i, parent\n\n    size_max = size_max +1\n    i=size_max\n    max_heap(i) =x\n\n    do while (i >1)\n        parent = i/2\n        if (max_heap(i) > max_heap(parent)) then\n            ! swap\n            temp = max_heap(i)\n            max_heap(i) = max_heap(parent)\n            max_heap(parent) = temp\n            i=parent\n        else\n            exit\n        end if\n    enddo\nend subroutine\n\nSimilarly for extracting the max:\n\nsubroutine extract_max_heap()\n\n    integer :: last, i, child\n\n    if( size_max ==0 ) then\n        ! error, no elements to extract\n        error stop\n    end if\n\n    ! get the root\n    extracted_val = max_heap(1)\n\n    ! move the last element to root\n    last = max_heap(size_max)\n    max_heap(1) = last\n    size_max = size_max -1\n\n    i=1\n    do while ( 2*i <=size_max )\n        child=2*i\n        if ( 2*i +1 <= size_max ) then\n            if ( max_heap(2*i+1) > max_heap(child)) child=2*i+1\n        end if\n\n        if ( last > max_heap(child) ) then\n            ! swap\n            temp = max_heap(child)\n            max_heap(child) = last\n            last = temp\n            i=child\n        else\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n   ! the extracted_val is the root now, but unless stored, we can't return it.\n\nWait, but the functions in Fortran can't return arrays or variables unless using result or variables passed by reference.\n\nHmm, this requires slight modifications. Alternatively, the extract functions must modify the heap and return the original root.\n\nThus, the function should return the extracted value.\n\nTo return this, perhaps using a function:\n\ninteger function extract_max_heap()\n    integer :: last, i, child, temp\n\n    if (size_max ==0) then; stop; endif\n\n    extract_max_heap = max_heap(1)\n\n    last= max_heap( size_max )\n\n    size_max = size_max -1\n\n    max_heap(1) = last\n\n    i=1\n\n    do while( 2*i <= size_max )\n        child = 2*i\n            if (child+1 <= size_max .and. max_heap(child+1) .gt. max_heap(child)) then\n            child=child+1\n        end if\n\n        if (last .gt. max_heap(child)) exit\n\n        max_heap(i) = max_heap(child)\n        i = child\n    end do\n\n    max_heap(i) = last\n\nend function\n\nWait sorry, the logic is a bit more involved. Let me code the heap extraction properly.\n\nAlternatively, for the extract functions, perhaps design as:\n\nSubroutine pop_max_heap( x ) that will store into x the root, then extract it.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps coding the functions as to perform their operations and track the root properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to code the functions using procedures.\n\nAlternatively, for the main logic:\n\nWhen we want to transfer an element from the max heap to the min heap:\n\nafter adding, for example, to balance the heaps, when size_max > size_min, the root of the max_heap (max value there) is popped, then that element is pushed to the min heap (the upper).\n\nThe min_heap is a min-heap, so pushing there.\n\nWait the function calls would be: \n\ncurrent_root_val = extract_max_heap()\n\ncall push_min_heap(current_root_val)\n\nThus, the extract functions need to remove and return the root.\n\nSimilarly, for the min_heap:\n\nthe push_min_heap(x) adds to the min-heap:\n\nsimilar to the max heap, but comparing in the opposite way.\n\nsubroutine push_min_heap( x )\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: x\n    integer :: i, parent\n\n    size_min = size_min +1\n    i = size_min\n    min_heap(i) =x\n\n    do while( i>1 )\n         parent = i/2\n         if ( min_heap(i) < min_heap(parent) ) then\n            ! swap\n            temp = min_heap(i)\n            min_heap(i) = min_heap(parent)\n            min_heap(parent) = temp\n            i= parent\n         else\n            exit\n         end if\n    end do\nend subroutine\n\nThe extract_min function:\n\ninteger function extract_min_heap()\n\n    integer :: last, i, child, temp\n\n    if ( size_min ==0 ) stop\n\n    extract_min_heap = min_heap(1)\n\n    last = min_heap(size_min)\n\n    size_min = size_min -1\n\n    min_heap(1) = last\n    i =1\n\n    do while( 2*i <= size_min )\n\n        child = 2*i\n        if( (child +1 <= size_min ) .AND. ( min_heap(child+1) < min_heap(child) ) ) child = child+1\n\n        if ( last <= min_heap(child)) exit\n\n        min_heap(i) = min_heap(child)\n        i = child\n    end do\n\n    min_heap(i) = last\n\nend function\n\nOkay.\n\nPutting this all together into the main code.\n\nNow, the main program must have the two heap arrays as allocatables, and include the functions (as either internal or external).\n\nBut in Fortran, the functions can't be nested in the program unless using module, which complicates.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, code the heap procedures as contained in the program.\n\nAlternatively, declare them as subroutines within the program entry.\n\nProcedures inside the main program can be done in newer versions (Fortran 2003) using CONTAIN.\n\nThus the code structure could be:\n\nprogram main\n    ! ... variables declarations\n\n    ! ... initial allocations ...\n    \n    ! main loop here:\n    read t...\n\n    do ...\n    end do ...\n\n    contains\n\n    ! declared functions here\n\nend program.\n\nTherefore, the code can be structured with contain certain functions.\n\nThus, below is an outline of the full code.\n\nNow, handling the command parsing:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, after reading the command's first character, the rest can be parsed via list-directed read, which should handle the three tokens for case '1'.\n\nThe full code steps:\n\n1. Read the number of test cases (t).\n2. Read each test case line by line:\n   a. Read each line into a string (line_str).\n   b. Extract the command (first character).\n   c. Parse the parameters depending on the command.\n3. For each case, execute code based on command 1 or 2.\n\nProblems to solve:\n\nParsing the line may have leading or trailing spaces or tabs, but algorithmic problems usually have no white space other needed, so the initial characters can be read with the first character.\n\nFor command '2', the parameters can be ignored as they are expected to have no numbers after the '2'.\n\nProcessing command '2' involves calculating sums and output.\n\nNow, start coding:\n\nThe full program:\n\nFirst variables:\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n    integer, allocatable :: max_heap(:)  ! for the max heap (the lower partition as a max heap)\n    integer, allocatable :: min_heap(:)  ! for the min heap (the upper partition)\n    integer :: size_max =0, size_min=0\n    integer :: t, x, command_char, am \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e:\n    integer(8) :: sum_min =0, sum_max=0, sumb=0\n    integer(8) :: ans_val, ans1_val, total\n    character(256) :: line\n    integer :: root_val\n    integer(8) :: b_val, in_val\n\n    ! Initialize the heaps with sufficient capacity\n    allocate( max_heap(1000000) ), min_heap(1000000) )\n\nWait, but in Fortran, I can't have two allocate in one line. Also, syntax correction.\n\nallocate( max_heap( 10**6 ) )\nallocate( min_heap(10**6 ) )\n\n    read(*,*) t\n    ! or read(*,*, end=100) t\n\n    !
