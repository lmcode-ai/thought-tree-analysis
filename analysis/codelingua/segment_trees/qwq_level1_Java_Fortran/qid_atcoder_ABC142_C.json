    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I should understand what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe Java code reads an integer N, then reads N numbers A into a map called idorder, where the key is A and the value is the index i. Then it loops from 1 to N and prints the value associated with key i in the map, which would be the original index where that number was found. The output is the indices in the order of the sorted A values. \n\nWait, right. So for example, if the input is like N=3 and the A's are 2, 3, 1, then the map would have keys 2:1, 3:2, 1:3. Then when we loop from 1 to 3, we check each key (1 is first, then 2, then3) and get the corresponding values which would be 3,1,2. So the output would be 3 1 2. That makes sense. \n\nSo the task is to replicate this logic in Fortran.\n\nNow, Fortran doesn't have a built-in hash map like Java's HashMap. So I need to find an alternative way. Since the keys are the numbers A (which are integers from 1 to N presumably?), but actually in the problem statement, I'm not sure but the A can be from 1 to N, because the problem might be such that when sorted, they form a permutation. Because the code loops from 1 to N and accesses the map with key i, which implies that all numbers from 1 to N are present in A's. \n\nTherefore, maybe in Fortran we can use an array instead. Since the keys are numbers from 1 to N, which are the values of A. Wait, actually the code is storing the position where each A (the input number at position i) is stored. Then, for each number from 1 to N, the map contains where that number was located. \n\nWait, let me recheck. Let's see, the Java code loops i from 1 to N, and for each, it reads A, then adds to the map: the key is A (the value read), and the value is i (the current index). So for each A (the value), we are storing its original position. Then, to output, we loop through 1 to N in order, and get the position stored for each key i (from 1 to N). So the output would be the list of the positions where 1,2,...N were found in the input array. \n\nSo the Fortran approach would be to read the array A into an array, then create an array where for each value in A, we store its index. Then, to output, for each number from 1 to N, find its index in A. \n\nWait, but how to do that? Because for each value in A, you need to know which index it's in. So perhaps, first, the input array is A(1) to A(N), which are the numbers provided. Then we create an array, let's say pos(1:N) that is such that pos(A(i)) = i. \n\nWait exactly. Because for example, in the Java code, when you have A (the value) as a key, the value is i. So the array pos can be created where for all i in 1..N, pos(A(i)) = i. That way, when we need to find the position of the number k (from 1..N) in the original array, we can just access pos(k). Because A(i) is the key, so pos(k) is the i where A was equal to k. \n\nTherefore in Fortran, the steps are:\n\n1. Read N.\n2. Read the N integers into an array A of size N. (Indices 1 to N)\n3. Create an array pos of size N, where for each element in A, pos(A(i)) = i. \n4. Then print the elements of pos from 1 to N. \n\nWait exactly, so the code would look like this:\n\nRead N\nAllocate arrays, then for each i (1 to N), read A(i). Then, loop through each i again and set pos(A(i)) = i. \n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead the input into array A(1:N). Then pos is initialized, and for each i, pos(A(i)) is set to i. Then print the array pos elements from 1 to N. \n\nSo steps:\n\nFirst, I need to declare an integer N.\n\nThen read N from input. \n\nThen, declare an array A of length N, and read the N elements into it. \n\nThen, declare pos array of size N, initially perhaps not initialized. \n\nThen loop over each element i from 1 to N. For each A(i), which will be between 1 and N, pos(A(i)) = i. \n\nWait but we have to assume that the input A contains all numbers 1 to N once. So that there is exactly one occurrence for each. So that the A array is a permutation? Well, the problem (since it's an AtCoder problem like ABC142C) likely assumes that, as otherwise there might be errors when trying to access pos(k) where k isn't present, but in the code given, the problem in Java would throw a null pointer if the key wasn't present, but the problem probably requires the input to be a permutation. \n\nAssuming that, then in Fortran, the code can proceed as:\n\nDeclare pos as an array of integers of size N. \n\nThen, loop for i = 1 to N:\n\npos(A(i)) = i\n\nThen, loop from 1 to N and print pos(i), with a space.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be something like this:\n\nprogram abc142c\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, a, i\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, pos\n\n  read*, n\n  allocate(a(n), pos(n))\n\n  do i=1, n\n    read*, a(i)\n  end do\n\n  do i=1, n\n    pos(a(i)) = i\n  end do\n\n  do i=1, n\n    write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') pos(i)\n  end do\n  write(*,*)\nend program abc142c\n\nWait, but let me check variable declarations.\n\nWait in the code above, the variables should be dimensioned. Wait, in the code written, the first variables are declared as:\n\ninteger :: n, a, i\n\nWait, but the array A is declared as dimension(:), but named a? Wait that's conflicting with the variable a. Oh right that's a problem. Because in the code I wrote, the variable 'a' is declared as an integer, but also an array. So perhaps that's an error. \n\nOh right, better to use better variable names. So to fix:\n\nFirst, the array should be named A rather than a. Wait in Fortran, variable names are case-insensitive, so case doesn't matter. But let's use proper names to avoid confusion.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, pos\n\nWait, so variables n is an integer for the size, and i is a loop index. \n\nWait in my initial code, I had:\n\ninteger :: n, a, i\n\nBut then 'a' is a variable, but I also have an array A. That would be a problem. So need to correct the variables. So it's a mistake in my previous code. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the corrected code would look like:\n\nprogram abc142c\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, pos\n\n  read*, n\n  allocate(A(n), pos(n))\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read*, A(i)\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    pos(A(i)) = i\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') pos(i)\n  end do\n  write(*,*)\nend program abc142c\n\nYes, that's better. \n\nNow checking each part. \n\nRead n, allocate arrays A and pos. Then read each A(i), then for each i from 1 to n, set pos(A(i)) to i. \n\nThen loop through each element of pos from 1 to n, and print them with a space, and at the end a new line.\n\nThis should work. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default if not specified. Since we have allocatable arrays, and we allocate them to size n, and initialize them? Or does the allocation initialize them to zero? Or maybe garbage?\n\nIn Fortran, when you allocate an array, the elements have undefined values unless they are initialized. So when we allocate pos, we need to ensure that the positions not set are ignored. But in our approach, since the input is a permutation (so for each A(i) from 1 to n, each exactly once), then every index in pos(1) to pos(n) will be set exactly once. Because each A(i) covers each key once. So the array pos will have all elements assigned. \n\nSo no problem. \n\nWait let me check the case. Suppose for example N=3 and the input A is 2,3,1. Then:\n\npos(2)=1 from i=1 (A(1)=2, so pos(2) =1\n\npos(3)=2 from i=2 (A=3)\n\npos(1)=3 from i=3 (A=1, so pos(1)=3\n\nso pos is [3,1, 2]. \n\nSo when we print pos(1), pos(2), pos(3), we get 3 1 2, which is correct. \n\nTherefore code is correct. \n\nNow, in the print statements. The output in Java is:\n\nfor each i from 1 to N:\n\nSystem.out.print(idorder.get(i))\n\nThen space. So all printed in one line, separated by spaces. \n\nIn Fortran, the code uses a loop with a format '(i0,1x)' each time. The advance='no' is to prevent new line after each, and then a final write command to end with newline. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a single write with a format that outputs all in one line. \n\nAnother approach could be:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000i0, 1x)') pos(1:n)\n\nBut this has a fixed number. Alternatively, let's think of using the * notation. \n\nWait Fortran allows formatted output with variable length:\n\nMaybe something like:\n\nwrite (*, '(i0, 1x, i0, 1x,... ) etc. but that is not feasible for variable n. \n\nAlternatively, using the * in the format statement.\n\nLike:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000i0)') (pos(i), i = 1, n), \n\nWait no, perhaps, the following:\n\nWe can do:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (i < n) then\n        write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') pos(i)\n    else\n        write(*, '(i0)') pos(i)\n    end if\nend do\n\nBut that's more code. Alternatively, the initial approach uses continuous print with the advance=no and then a new line. \n\nAlternatively, the format '(i0,1x)' for each and then a comma at the end except last? But that's hard. \n\nAlternatively, in the code given, doing the first loop, with advance='no', and after all elements, a write with a new line. \n\nYes, that is manageable. The code as:\n\ndo i =1, n\n    write(*,\u2019(i0,1x)\u2019, advance=\u2019no\u2019) pos(i)\nend do\nwrite(*, *)\n\nThe latter line writes a blank line? Wait, no, \"write(*,*)\" implicitly a new line. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last line can be a write(*,\u2019(a)\u2019) \" \" but probably better to close the loop. \n\nWait the initial code seems okay. \n\nAnother point: in Java, the elements are printed with space-separated, ending with a space. In the Fortran code, each element is printed with a space after, so the last element will have an extra space at the end. But in programming contest problems, trailing spaces are usually allowed. \n\nHowever, in some cases, they are not, so maybe the last write would omit the space. But perhaps in this problem it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, using the longest format and output all in one statement:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000i0,1x)') (pos(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut that would add an extra space at the end. \n\nAlternatively, write:\n\nwrite(*, '( (i0, 1x), & - after n items...)')\n\nAlternatively, the way in the code I wrote is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, the 'advance=no' for all except last element. But that requires knowing the count. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, can I do:\n\nwrite(*,'(1000i0)') (pos(i), i=1, n)\n\nBut this would output them without space. \n\nSo maybe better to do:\n\nwrite(*,'(1x,i0)', advance='yes') ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of the following. \n\nThe correct way to print N numbers separated by spaces, without a trailing space is to loop from 1 to N, and for each except the first, write with a leading space?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the write format can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, for each element except the last, write with a space after, and the last has no. \n\nIn Fortran, to do that, in a loop:\n\ndo i=1, n\n  if (i == 1) then\n    write(*,'(i0)', advance=\"no\") pos(i)\n  else\n    write(*,'(x,i0)', advance=\"no\") pos(i)\n  end if\nend do\nwrite(*,*)\n\nThe first element is written without leading space, the others are written with leading space. This would avoid a trailing space. However, for N=0? But N>=1 presumably.\n\nAlternatively the first element can have leading space, but no, the first shouldn't. \n\nAlternatively, the first write can use advance='no' and the rest can also, with a space.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, they use 'System.out.print(\" \")' after each element. So the code in Java always appends a space, even after the last element. \n\nSo in the problem's point of view, that's acceptable, because in some contest problems, trailing space is okay. \n\nThus, perhaps the initial code's way is fine. \n\nSo the code as follows:\n\nprogram abc142c\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: A, pos\n\n  read*, n\n  allocate(A(n), pos(n))\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read*, A(i)\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    pos(A(i)) = i\n  end do\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    write(*, '(i0, 1x)', advance='no') pos(i)\n  end do\n  write(*,*)\nend program abc142c\n\nThis should work. \n\nNow checking variables:\n\nThe arrays A and pos are both of size N. \n\nWhen we read A(i) for i from 1 to n. \n\nThen the second loop assigns pos(A(i)) = i for each i. \n\nTherefore, pos array is correctly built. \n\nYes, the code should work. \n\nLet me check another test case.\n\nSuppose N=5, and input A as 3,5,4,2,1. \n\nThen pos would be:\n\npos(3)=1 (since A(1)=3 \u2192 pos(3)=1\n\npos(5)=2 (A(2)=5 \u2192 pos(5)=2\n\npos(4)=3 (A(3)=4 \u2192 pos(4)=3\n\npos(2)=4 (A(4)=2 \u2192 pos(2)=4\n\npos(1)=5 (A(5)=1 \u2192 pos(1)=5\n\nTherefore the pos array elements:\n\npos(1)=5, pos(2)=4, pos(3)=1, pos(4)=3, pos(5)=2.\n\nSo when printed 1 to 5: 5 4 1 3 2. So that is correct because the positions for 1 to5 are as above. \n\nTherefore the code does the correct thing. \n\nSo the Fortran code should be as written. \n\nNow the code might need include 'implicit none', which it does. \n\nAnother point: the arrays are allocatable, which is okay for newer Fortran versions (Fortran 90 or later). \n\nThe code should be compatible with F90 or later standards. \n\nSo I think that's the correct translation."
