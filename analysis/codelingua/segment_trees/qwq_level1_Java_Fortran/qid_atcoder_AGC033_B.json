    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by going through the Java code and understanding what it's doing step by step. \n\nThe problem is looking at some movement in a grid, right? There are variables h, w for height and width, n steps, starting position sr, sc, then two strings s and t. The goal seems to be determining if the starting position remains safe after all moves. \n\nLet me look at the structure of the Java code. The main method reads inputs and then does two loops, one for the vertical movement (usafe, dsafe) and another for horizontal (lsafe, rsafe). Then it checks if the starting position is within those safe zones. \n\nFirst thing's first, variables: in Java, the Scanner is used, but in Fortran, we can read inputs line by line, maybe using read(*,*) for the integers. Let me note the variables: h, w, n, sr, sc. Then s and t are strings, so in Fortran, since Fortran doesn't have string types like Java, I need to read them as character arrays perhaps.\n\nWait, but in Java, Strings are used with charAt(i) to get individual characters. In Fortran, strings can be handled as character arrays with length. So the variables s and t can be declared as character arrays. So I should declare s and t as strings of length n, maybe? Because each of them has n characters probably. Wait, actually in the Java code, since they are passed as Strings from the input, and n is the next value. Looking back, the variables are read as h, w, n, sr, sc, then s and t. So s and t are two strings, each probably of length n? Because the loop uses n-1 indices. Let me check. The for loops are iterating from n-1 downto 0. The s is indexed with those i's, so s must be length at least n... Wait, the for loop for the first part starts with i from (n-1) downto 0, so s has characters for all those indices. So s is a string of length n, right? Similarly for t, since in the first loop, i-1 goes down to t(i-1), but when i=0, i-1 would be -1, but that can't be. Wait, no, in the first loop, in the 'if (i>0)' clause, then they check t(i-1). The first loop starts from i down to 0 (n-1 to 0). So when i is 0, the if (i>0) won't run. So that suggests that the t is length n? Wait, maybe n is the total number of pairs? Maybe n is the number of steps for s and t? Wait, looking at the code: the problem is named AGC033 B, which is probably related to some problem's constraints. But I need to focus on the variables. Let me think the variables in terms of the code:\n\nThe first scanner inputs h, w, n, and then sr, sc. Then the next two strings s and t. So s and t are two strings with at least n characters each? Or exactly n? Because the for loop is over n steps. It's safer to assume both s and t are of length n.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, I can declare s and t as character arrays of length n. \n\nVariables are next:\n\nThe booleans (like end) in Java become logical in Fortran. The integers (usafe, dsafe, ... ) stay as integers.\n\nSo the outline in Fortran would be something like:\n\nprogram agc033b\nimplicit none\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc\ninteger :: usafe, dsafe\nlogical :: end \n\n... (more variables)\n\nread the inputs. Then loops.\n\nNow, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the code's first loop:\n\nThe first loop processes the 'U' and 'D' directions for vertical safety. Let me see:\n\nInitially, usafe=1 and dsafe=h. Then, starting from the end of the s string backwards (since the loop starts at i = n-1 downto 0):\n\nfor each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\nif s[i] is 'U', then usafe +=1.\n\nIf it's 'D', dsafe -=1.\n\nThen check if usafe>dsafe, set end to true and break.\n\nThen, if i>0, check the previous character of t (t[i-1]). Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nWait: When processing the i-th step (starting from the end), what does the loop mean?\n\nWait the original Java code's loop variables and indices might need close attention. For the first loop (vertical):\n\nLoop runs for i from n-1 down to 0 (i = n-1 downto 0 in reverse). So first i = n-1, then i = n-2, down to 0.\n\nThe code then checks s.charAt(i) - e.g., for the largest i first, in the opposite direction of the steps. \n\nWait the problem might be about moving through N steps. Each step is determined by s's commands, but then the t commands are used in certain updates. This needs closer examination.\n\nWait in the first loop (vertical):\n\nThe first step of the code:\n\nStarting with initial usafe=1 and dsafe = h. Then for each i from end down to start:\n\nfor each step i (starting from last step):\n\nincrement/decrement accordingly based on s's ith character.\n\nWait the s represents some direction commands, and while processing these starting from the end, they track the safe zones.\n\nWait the way the code works is to process the movements backwards. The variables usafe and dsafe are tracking the safe vertical positions after all steps up to a certain point. \n\nHmm. It's getting a bit complicated. Let me just try to translate the code as much as I can, paying attention to the_STRUCTURAL similarities.\n\nBy the way, the code has two separate loops: one handles vertical (up/down), and the other horizontal (left/right). So now, the code first does vertical, then horizontal.\n\nFirst Loop (Vertical):\n\nInitialize usafe=1, dsafe=h.\n\nLoop over i from n-1 down to 0 (in Java 0-based index).\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif s's character at i is 'U':\n\n    usafe = usafe +1\n\nelse if 'D':\n\n    dsafe = dsafe -1\n\nthen check if usafe > dsafe: if so, end = true (the end condition is flagging impossible), break (exit the loop).\n\nThen, the next part: if i is not zero, then (since i>0):\n\n   and process t's character at i-1 (since t is 1-based or 0-based? In Java, it's 0-based).\n\nWait the code has an 'if (i>0)' to check t(i-1). So when i is down from n-1 downto 0, then the first time when i is 0, that part is skipped. Else, when i is, say, 2, then i-1 is 1, so it's accessing the previous step's T character.\n\nThis might be part of undoing something? Because the processing is done in reverse order. Because this is a backward processing over steps, so the t's i-1 step might be affecting the movement in some way?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's part of the problem's logic where the commands in s and t interact. Not sure, but for the purposes of the code translation, I just need to translate exactly the logic.\n\nNow, the code, after processing the current step's command in s, then if there is a previous step (since i is not zero), then it processes the t's command from i-1.\n\nWait: t is the next? Like, for each step i in reverse, we are also considering the previous step's T. \n\nI think the exact details of the problem might be that the movement goes through N steps where s is the person moving's commands, and t is some kind of obstacle commands? So that the obstacles are moving?\n\nBut regardless, the Fortran code needs to mirror the loops and conditions.\n\nSo in Fortran for the first loop:\n\nWe can loop over i from n-1 down to 0. So in Fortran, loops are written as:\n\ndo i = n_start, n_end, step\n\nSo for the loop from n-1 down to 0 (assuming n is 0-based steps), but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default. Wait, this is a crucial point.\n\nIn Java, arrays and Strings are 0-based. But in Fortran, the default is 1-based. Therefore, when translating the Strings s and t, which in Java are 0-based (i from 0 to n-1), in Fortran, we can either:\n\n1) Decide that in Fortran, s and t are 1-based arrays. Then when the code in Java does:\n\nfor (int i =n-1; i >=0; i--)\n\nIn Fortran, that becomes loop from (n downto 1), since in Java's i is 0-based until n-1, which corresponds to Fortran's 1 to n. So n-1 in Java becomes the equivalent of n in Fortran. \n\nWait: \n\nWait the length of strings s and t must match the n steps. Since n is the 3rd input, s and t should each have exactly n characters. \n\nSo in Fortran, when reading the strings s and t, perhaps we can read them as characters of length n. \n\nSo declaring s as a character array:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: s(n), t(n)\n\nor using C interoperability, but it's more straightforward to use native way here.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you read a string, you can read s for example as a character array. So maybe read a line for s and fill it into s(1:n). \n\nWait, perhaps the variables for the strings should be declared as character(len=:), allocatable or not? Hmm, but perhaps let's see.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nRead the strings s and t as strings of adequate length (like n+1, but since n is in the input, perhaps better to have a maximum expected length first). Alternatively, perhaps read the entire input.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran, the input can be read as:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n\nThen read s:\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut when reading, we need to read a character array. Or, perhaps read s as a record-length string. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, use the ISO C module for treating strings as arrays.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in the Java code the s and t are read as next tokens, so each is exactly the next String, which in Fortran may be read with read(*, '(A)') to get each string as a line.\n\nWait the code in Java uses scanner.next() twice (after s and t), so each is a token. Assuming each is exactly of length n.\n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran we can read it into a character variable of size n. Let's say:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_char = 100000   ! Sufficiently big\n\ncharacter(len=max_char) :: s_input, t_input\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n\nread(*,'(A)') s_input   ! reads the next token, which is s (but in Fortran's read, maybe it's needed as a whole string)\n\nread(*,'(A)') t_input\n\nThen, s and t would be character arrays of size n, taken as:\n\ncharacter :: s(n), t(n)\n\ns = [ character(len=1) :: (s_input(i:i),i=1,n) ]\n\nSimilarly for t. \n\nAlternatively, since in Java it's s a String, each character s.charAt(i) where i ranges 0..n-1. In Fortran, s would be an array 1..n where s(i) is the i-th character of input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using pointers or functions.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran, string are arrays of 1-based indices. So perhaps:\n\nRead s and t into variables, then process each character as per their position.\n\nSo first variables declarations:\n\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc\n\ninteger :: usafe, dsafe, lsafe, rsafe\n\nlogical :: end = .false.\n\ncharacter (len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nRead h, w, n, sr, sc:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n\n! Read the two strings s and t:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: line_s, line_t\n\nread(*, '(A)') line_s ! need to properly read, but if input is s is a whole string, maybe spaces?\n\nWait perhaps the input is provided in a single line, so assuming standard input as per Java:\n\nJava reads all the numbers first via nextInt, then next() is the s string, then next() is the t string.\n\nAssuming that after the 5 integers, there are two more strings, possibly with spaces? Hmm, but then in Fortran, better use list-directed input.\n\nWait let me think. \n\nIn Java code:\n\nThe first scanner call reads the first line: h, w, n, sr, sc,\n\nbut how are the following s and t given? Probably, the lines are the next tokens; so for example, the input could be like:\n\n3 3 5 1 1 UUDDL RLLRR\n\nSo in that case, after the 5 integers (h=3,w=3,n=5 etc), then next() gets \"UUDDL\", and next() gets \"RLLRR\".\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the reader can do something like:\n\nAfter reading the 5 integers, then read s and t as the next two words.\n\nFortran's list-directed input reads whitespace separated tokens, so perhaps:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc, s_str, t_str\n\nwhere s_str and t_str are character variables.\n\nThen, since s and t are strings of length n, we can then convert them into the character arrays:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s_str, t_str\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nallocate(s(n), t(n))\n\ns = transfer(s_str, s)  ??\n\nHmm, not sure. Another way is:\n\ns_str holds the string of length n. To get each character:\n\ndo i =1 to n\n\n   s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nSame for t.\n\nHence, perhaps:\n\nRead the two strings as lines (wait depending on input). Alternatively:\n\nread(*,*, err=100) h,w,n,sr,sc, s_str, t_str\n\nor to be safer:\n\nFirst read the scalars:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n\nthen read s_str and t_str as the next two strings, possibly using a100 or similar for length.\n\nAlternatively, using:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s_str\n\nBut this might read the entire line for s_str. But in the testcases, after the numbers, the s and t are separated by a space, so perhaps:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 5 1 1 UUDDL RLLRR\n\nSo after reading h,w,n,sr,sc, the next available data on the same line is \"UUDDL\" and then \"RLLRR\".\n\nTherefore, the rest can be read as:\n\nreal\n\nRead s_str and t_str as characters of sufficient length:\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: s_str, t_str\n\nread(*,*) h,w,n,sr,sc   ! reads the first 5 integers.\n\nthen read the next two strings as s_str and t_str separated by spaces:\n\nThe rest of the line (since maybe they are on the same line) can be read with a format that reads the next two strings.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(*,*) h,w,n,sr,sc, s_str, t_str  \n\nBut then you have to write the data as all on one line, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the s_str is read as the next string:\n\nActually, when using list-directed input (using * in format) in Fortran, after reading the integers, the compiler will read the next word as the string.\n\nWait in Fortran, a string in list-directed input is treated as a multiple blanks delimiting fields, so the following should work:\n\nvariable declarations:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s_str, t_str\n\nthen:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc, s_str, t_str\n\nthe s_str and t_str can be up to 1000 characters, but the problem constraints probably limit their lengths to n. Since n is given, perhaps the code can use dynamic variables. However, in Fortran, the length of the string needs to be known at compile time, unless we use allocatable arrays or other methods.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps dynamic sizing.\n\nWait in Fortran 2003, there are features for adjustable-length character arrays. But maybe proceeding without allocatables for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, since n is known, use a parameter.\n\nWait, in the Java code's logic, s and t have exactly n characters each, because the loops go up to i = n-1 (0-based), so in Fortran, we can first read n, then allocate arrays of size n.\n\nTherefore perhaps declaring s and t as:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: ... not needed here.\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nAfter reading h, w, n, sr, sc:\n\nallocate( s(n), t(n) )\n\nthen read s_str and t_str as the next two words:\n\nSo:\n\ncontinue with after reading the first five variables:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc, s_str, t_str\n\nThen, to fill s and t arrays (1-based?):\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\n   t(i) = t_str(i:i)\n\nend do\n\nThis way, s and t would be properly indexed from 1 to n, corresponding to the Java's 0-based i (since in Java, i runs from n-1 down to 0). So in the loop in Fortran, the first loop would be:\n\ndo i =n,1,-1\n\nwhich loops i from n downto 1, same as Java's i from n-1 downto 0 (since in Java, the last character of the string is at position n-1 (0-based), but in Fortran it's at n (1-based). So the Fortran loop's i will correspond to the Java i plus 1.\n\nWait, that's critical! \n\nLet me think: \n\nJava's s is a string of length n, with characters from index 0 (first) to n-1 (last). \n\nFortran's s array is of size n, where s(1) is the first character, s(n) is the last.\n\nTherefore, in code looping from i=n-1 downto 0 in Java corresponds to i= n downto 1 in Fortran, because Java's i+1 = the Fortran's i.\n\nWait exactly: If Java loops i from (n-1) downto 0, then in Fortran, the equivalent loop would be from i =n downto 1, as the index (i_java +1 = i_fortran) where s(i_fortran) corresponds to the Java s.charAt(i_java).\n\nTherefore:\n\nwhen in Java, for i in 0 to n-1, in Fortran the loop index i_f would be 1-based where i_f = i_java +1.\n\nHence, in the first loop:\n\nJava:\n\nfor (int i = n-1; i >=0; i--)\n\nIn Fortran: \n\ndo i = n, 1, -1 \n\nSimilarly for all loops that iterate over the strings.\n\nNow, proceeding with the code.\n\nFirst loop's processing:\n\ninitial values:\n\nusafe =1\n\ndsafe = h\n\nend = .false.\n\ndo i =n,1,-1:\n\n    c = s(i)  'U','D', etc.\n\n    if c == 'U' then usafe = usafe +1\n\n    else if c == 'D', then dsafe = dsafe -1\n\n    check if usafe > dsafe : if yes, set end = .true.  exit loop?\n\nWait the loop in Java breaks out of the loop via 'break', so in Fortran, exiting the loop early can be done with an 'exit' statement inside a conditional.\n\nSo in the loop:\n\n    if ( usafe > dsafe ) then \n\n        end = .true.\n\n        exit   ! exit the loop (exit the do loop)\n\n    end if\n\nThen, the next part is the i>0 check.\n\nWait in Java: \n\nif (i>0) {\n\n    check the previous t's character (since in Java's code, in this part, the next command is t.charAt(i-1). But in Java's i here is the example variable.\n\nWait in Java's code, where the loop variable is i_java from n-1 downto 0:\n\nin the Java loop, for each i_java, the t's index is t.charAt(i_java -1)\n\nwhich in Fortran's terms, since Java's i_java was from 0 to n-1, Fortran's i_f is 1 to n, so i_java = i_f -1.\n\nTherefore, the code checking for i_java > 0 is equivalent to i_f >1 (since i_f=1 corresponds to i_java=0).\n\nWait Java's i>0 condition:\n\nJava's code segment:\n\nif (i > 0) {\n\n    if (t.charAt(i-1) == 'U') {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n    etc.\n\n}\n\nIn terms of Fortran variables:\n\nsince Java's i is from 0 (the original i) to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran's loop variable is i_f from n down to 1.\n\nSince in Fortran's loop variable i_f corresponds to Java's i_java = i_f - 1.\n\nWait, because: For example, when the Java code processes the first step (i= n-1 in Java's terms), which is the last character of s, but looping from the end backward, that's the first step being processed. \n\nWait, perhaps confusion arises. \n\nBut for the condition checking:\n\nIn Java's inner if: \"if (i>0)\" \n\nthen the code is checking whether the current Java iteration's index is >0. \n\nTranslating that to Fortran:\n\ni_java is (i_f -1)\n\nso i_java >0 => i_f-1>0 \u2192 i_f>1 \n\nHence, in Fortran the condition is: if (i_f >1).\n\nTherefore, the following code inside in Fortran would be :\n\nif (i > 1) then   since i_f runs from n downto 1\n\nWait, wait: For example, in the first iteration of Fortran (i= n, which corresponds to Java's i_java= n-1 (max value). So the condition i>1 is true (if n>1).\n\nBut in Java's code i can be n-1 which is definitely greater than 0 (since n is given as an input; but could n be 0? Unlikely since the problem... Wait n is the number of steps, so probably n\u22651. \n\nBut the code needs to consider all cases.\n\nContinuing:\n\nif (i >1) then \n\n    t_char = t(i-1) \n\n    because in Java, the previous i-1 is in terms of t. \n\nWait the original Java code has:\n\nif i>0:\n\n    process the previous character of t: t.charAt(i-1) (since the i in Java is the current step's s, while the t's preceding step is i-1?)\n\nSo in Fortran, because t is 1-based, then when in code:\n\nJava's i_java is the current loop index.\n\nso the t's previous (in terms of steps?) is t at i_java -1 (for the preceding step). \n\nWait since for a given step i_java (Java index), there's a t in the previous step's t? Not sure, but the code is doing:\n\nAfter processing s's current i, then check the t's previous step (i-1 in the indices).\n\nBut in Fortran, in terms of variables:\n\nthe t array is from 1 to n, so the current loop's i_f (which is the index into s array) \u2192 the s's current character is s(i_f). The t's previous step (i_java-1) is in Java terms, so in Fortran it would be:\n\nthe corresponding Java's (i-1), which is (i_f-1 -1) ? No, no: Because:\n\nJava's i_java (current) is equal to (i_f (Fortran's s array loop) -1)\n\nso the previous step in Java is i_prev_j= i_java -1 \u2192 and the t's index for that step is t.charAt(i_prev_j) = t \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c .......... ..\n\nNo, actually the code in Java for that line is:\n\nthe T that is processed is \n\nt.charAt( i -1 ), where I is the current Java loop variable (i from n-1 to 0)\n\nSo for example, if i is 5 in Java's loop, then looking back to t[4].\n\nIn Fortran terms, when i_f is 6 (since i_f starts at n down, and Java's i=5 is s(6) in Fortran's array), then the relevant T's index would be t(5).\n\nSo when in Fortran's code, during the processing of s(i_f), and needing to have t at (i_f -1)?\n\nWait yes. Because for the current Java iteration (i.Java) we are processing, the code uses T[i-1], which in Fortran terms is:\n\nJava's i (current) \u2192 T's index is i -1 (prev) which in Fortran is \u2192 (i_f-1) - 1 = i_f -2 ?\n\nWait wait, let me think.\n\nStrive for clarity:\n\nSuppose in the Java code:\n\ni_java is the current loop variable. So in Java, the T index they are accessing is:\n\nInside the (i>0) block, check t's (i-1).\n\nSo the T index used is (i_java -1) \u2192 since T is 0-based. \n\nIn Fortran, T is 1-based, so that T index in Java is equivalent to Fortran T's (i_java) \u2192 no, wait: \n\nOriginal T in Java is stored as a 0-based array with characters 0 to n-1. So T[i_java -1] is the desired index. \n\nIn Fortran's terms:\n\nThe Java index for the T array is i_prev = i-java -1 \u2192 \n\nthis is a Java index of the previous step's T.\n\n To find where the T array (Fortran's 1-based) is at the same position, the Fortran index is \n\n T ( i_prev +1 ) \n\nbecause Java index for T is 0-based:\n\ni_prev = i_java -1 \u2192 Fortran index is i_prev+1 = (i_java -1 +1) = i_java.\n\nWait no:\n\nWait the Fortran's array for T is 1-based. Thus, a Java T[i] corresponds to Fortran T(i+1).\n\nWait, in Fortran, T is a string of length n, with T(1) holding the first character (Java index 0).\n\nSo Java's tcuracy (i_minus_1) = T[ i-java -1 ]\n\n\u2192 corresponds to Fortran array's position ( (i_java -1) +1 ) \u2192 i_java.\n\nThus, the corresponding Fortran's T(i-Java's previous) \u2192 T (i_java) \n\nWait so in Fortran terms, the 't(i-j-1)' would be in the 1-based array as:\n\nFortran T(i_java) is the same as Java's T[i_j -1]\n\nWait let me see: \n\nFor example, Java's i_java = 3:\n\nWe want T[i_java -1] \u2192 Java index 2 \u2192 which is stored in Fortran's T array at position 2+1=3? No \u2192 wait, Java's T[0] is Fortran T(1). T[i_java-1] where i-java is 3 \u2192 T[2] \u2192 which is Fortran T(3). \n\nWait that's exactly what would be: T's Fortran index at (i_java) corresponds to T[ i-java -1 ]?\n\nWait no, no:\n\nWait T in Java is 0-based, T[ k ] is the (k+1)th in Fortran (array starts at 1) so when you have a Java's T index of (i_java -1), then in Fortran it is (i_java -1) +1 = (i_java).\n\nThus, the T character at Java's previous step is T[i_java -1] which is stored at Fortran T(i_java \u2013 prev?) \n\nThus, in the code:\n\nIn Fortran, the current loop's i_f is the s array index \u2192 s(i_f) is the character currently being processed.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe part of code that would correspond to:\n\nif (i>0) { \n\n    c_t = t[i-1]\n\n...\n\n}\n\ntranslates to:\n\nif (i_f > 1) then  \u2192 because when i_f is 2, that corresponds to i_j (Java i) =1 (since i_j = i_f -1, so the previous iteration's i_j is 1 -1 =0 (but not important).\n\nWait, no: i_f is 1 corresponds to i_java=0.\n\ni_f=2 \u2192 i_java =1 \u2192 the 'i>0' (Java) evaluates to true (i_java=1>0 \u2192 true). \n\nThus, the condition i_f>1 is equivalent.\n\nSo the code in Fortran:\n\ninside the loop over i_f from n downto 1:\n\n if (i_f>1) then\n\n    current_T_char = t(i_f -1 ) \u2192 wait: \n\nWait, when in Java, when i_java is being processed (i_f = i_java +1), then T[i_java -1] in java is equivalent to the Fortran character at:\n\nJava's T[i_j_minus1] equals T[java_index], where T's Fortran array index = T[java's index +1]\n\nSo to get T[i_j -1], which is the character corresponding to the previous step.\n\nIn this Java scenario, T's java index is (i_j -1)\n\n\u2192 so the Fortran location is (i_j -1 + 1 ) = i_j \n\n\u2192 since i_j = (i_f -1).\n\nThus:\n\nT's character in Fortran for the previous step is at T( (i_j -1)+1 ) = T(i_j) \n\nwhere i_j is (i_f -1).\n\nThus, the Fortran code needs to access T( [i_j] )\n\nBut i_j = (i_f -1). \n\nWait substituting,\n\njava's T[i_j -1] = Java_T [ (i_j -1) ] \u2192 which is stored at Fortran_T( (i_j -1 +1) ) \u2192 T(i_j )\n\nSo in Fortran's loop variable, the current T's index is i_j: \n\ni_j = i_f - 1 \u2192 T's index is i_j \u2192 T(i_f -1).\n\nWait that's right. So so the T's access for the current iteration's previous is T( i_j ), which in terms of i_f's current value is T( i_f - 1 ).\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nthe current T's index is (i_f -1), yes! Because i_f is s's index (from n downto 1). \n\nTherefore:\n\nin the code inside the \"if(i_f>1) then\" block:\n\nchar_t = t( i_f -1 )\n\nSo for example:\n\nfor i_f=2:\n\ni_f-1=1 \u2192 which is appropriate for accessing T[1] (in 1-based), which corresponds to Java T[0].\n\nSo the code in that block would be:\n\nif ( char_t == 'U' ) then \n\n    dsafe = min( dsafe + 1 , h )\n\nelse if ( char_t == 'D' )\n\n    usafe = max( usafe -1, 1 )\n\nThe original Java code has:\n\nif (t.charAt(i-1) == 'U') {\n\n    dsafe = Math.min(dsafe +1, h);\n\n} else if ( == 'D') \u2192 then:\n\nusafe = Math.max... \n\nSo yes.\n\nHence, in code:\n\nif ( c_t == 'U' ) \u21d2 then:\n\n    dsafe = min( dsafe+1, h )\n\nBut Fortran uses the min() function for integers. So it's possible to write:\n\ndsafe = min(dsafe + 1, h)\n\nSame approach for the other cases.\n\nNow, proceed to translate first loop.\n\nNow, the loop for vertical processing:\n\nusafe = 1\n\ndsafe = h\n\nend = .false.\n\ndo i_f = n,1,-1 \u2192 loop reads from the last character to first in s array.\n\nloop:\n\n    c = s( i_f )\n\n    if (c == 'U' ) then \u2192 then usafe += 1 \n\n    usafe = usafe +1\n\n    elif ( c == 'D' \u2192 then dsafe -=1 \n\n    dsafe = dsafe -1 \n\n    end select (since in Fortran)\n\n    \u2192 So using a case way, perhaps a series of if-then.\n\n    then check if usafe > dsafe: \n\n    if ( usafe > dsafe ) \u2192 set end = true and exit\n\n    if( usafe > dsafe ) then\n\n        end = .true.\n\n        exit  \u2192 the loop is exited, the do loop exits.\n\n    end if\n\n    now check if i_f>1 \u2192 if yes:\n\n        char_T = t( i_f -1 )\n\n        process the cases.\n\n        if char_T == 'U' then \u2192 \n\n            dsafe = min(dsafe +1, h )\n\n        else if ( 'D' )\n\n            usafe = max( usafe -1, 1 )\n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nThen similarly for the second loop processing the horizontal ( 'L' and 'R' )\n\nSame approach for the horizontal loop:\n\nSimilarly, lsafe=1, rsafe =w.\n\ndo i_f = n downto 1 \n\nthen the same structure.\n\nNow, for the horizontal loop variables:\n\nl_safe =1 \n\nr_safe =w \n\nthen processing similarly.\n\nfor characters in s (L or R):\n\nfor each s(i_f) being 'L' then l_safe increases, 'R' then r_safe decreases.\n\nand after each, check if lsafe>rsafe, thus setting end true and exiting.\n\nThen if i_f>1 \u2192 take the t's (i_f-1)th character, and modifying l/r safe accordingly:\n\nif T char is 'L' \u2192 then need to see the adjustments. \n\nWait in Java's code for horizontal part:\n\nAfter processing s's i (current character) for horizontal:\n\nthen for the t's i-1 (previous step):\n\nif t's char is 'L', then:\n\nsimilar to:\n\n    rsafe =  Math.min(rsafe +1, w); \n\nWait the opposite of in the vertical?\n\n Let's look:\n\nIn the Java code horizontal loop:\n\nThe code says:\n\n                if (t.charAt(i - 1) == 'L') {\n\n                    rsafe = Math.min(rsafe + 1, w);\n\n                } else if (t.charAt(i - 1) == 'R') {\n\n                    lsafe = Math.max(lsafe - 1, 1);\n\n                }\n\nWait for the horizontal:\n\nFirst handling the s's commands (L/R):\n\nLike, in the horizontal loop part:\n\nfor (int i = n-1... ):\n\n    if s is L \u2192 lsafe +=1 \n\n    else if R \u2192 rsafe -=1 \n\n    then check if l >r \u2192 the range is invalid.\n\nThen, the t's command (i-1) in Java:\n\nif T is 'L' \u2192 then :\n\n    rsafe increases by 1 (to min with w), so the safe area on the right expands.\n\nBy applying T's command, perhaps when T has a command to move left, it's expanding the safe region on the right.\n\nThe exact reason is part of the algorithm, but the code's logic is the same in Fortran, translating the conditionals.\n\nSo in the code for the horizontal loop:\n\nif (char_t (t[i_f-1]) is 'L' \u2192 then set rsafe = min( rsafe +1, w )\n\nelse if 'R' \u2192 lsafe = max( lsafe-1,1). \n\nHence, the Fortran code for horizontal loop is accordingly.\n\nNow, after both loops are processed, the main code checks the conditions: \n\nif ( the starting sr is between usafe and dsafe, and sc between l and r, and end is NOT set to true \u2192 then print yes else no ). \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nif ( sr >= usafe and ... etc. ) \u2192 and .not. end \n\n\u2192 in code: \n\nif ( (sr >= usafe) .and. (sr <= dsafe) .and. (sc >= l_safe ) .and. (sc <= r_safe ) .and. .not. end ) then \n\n    print * , 'YES'\n\nelse \n\n    print * , 'NO'\n\nend if \n\nNow, putting all together, the first task is setting up the variables correctly. \n\nNow, also, in the code, when you exit the first loop (vertical) via break (exit in Fortran), the variables still retain their values, and the second loop runs as well? \n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nAfter processing vertical loop, the 'end' flag is set if it's impossible. \n\nHowever, both loops are separate. So even if the vertical loop exited early (i.e., end becomes true), the horizontal loop may still run? But in the Java code the code proceeds to run the horizontal loop regardless. The 'end' is ORed between the two loops, thus if either of the loops ends early (vertical or horizontal), the end would be set. \n\nWait in the code, the loops are separate, so for the vertical part, end is computed and can be set. The horizontal loop then may also set 'end'. So in my translation, I must note that:\n\nthe end is a flag that is set in vertical loop (if the vertical breaks early) and/or can also be set by the horizontal loop later.\n\nThus in code: the vertical loop can set it to true; the horizontal loop can also set it to true (overwriting if needed).\n\nTherefore, during the vertical loop execution, if we encounter break (exiting the loop because usafe > dsafe ), then after that the variable end is true, then moving into the horizontal loop which can also set it to true or not.\n\nNow, implementing:\n\nNow, in Fortran, first handle variable declaration:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc033b\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc\n\nlogical :: end = .false.\n\ninteger :: usafe, dsafe, l_safe, r_safe\n\n! declare the character arrays for s and t, with dimension n\n\ninteger :: i\n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t\n\n! read the inputs\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc\n\n! allocate arrays s and t each of n elements.\n\nallocate(s(n), t(n)) ! check for allocation, but for the purpose of this code, assume no error.\n\n! Read the strings s and t (each exactly n characters)\n\n! Now to read the s_str and t_str variables\n\ncharacter(len=10000) :: s_str, t_str ! length arbitrary big enough.\n\nREAD(*, '(A)', err=100 ) s_str \n\nREAD(*, '(A)', err=100) t_str \n\n! Note that the format '(A)' reads until end of line, so need to ensure the strings are separated properly.\n\n! then unpack the strings into the arrays:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n    s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\n    t(i) = t_str(i:i)\n\nenddo\n\n! Now, process the vertical:\n\nusafe = 1 \n\ndsafe = h \n\nend = .false. ! initialize end again each time?\n\nWait, no, the end is set in vertical loop and may be reused for horizontal loop.\n\nWait in Java:\n\nInitially end is set to false.\n\nThe vertical loop may set it to true (if breaks early)\n\nThen, after the loop completes (regardless), the code moves to the next loop (horizontal). \n\nTherefore, in the horizontal loop, if another condition is met, it can set end back to true.\n\n Therefore, the variable end should be initialized to false only at the beginning, so we have to set it in vertical loop (reset to false before each loop? No, because initial value is false. Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the code:\n\nVariables declared once, the code does:\n\ninitially end = false \n\nvertical loop can set to true or remain false \n\nHorizontal loop starts after vertical. If after vertical loop's end is true, then during horizontal, it will be processed but perhaps after setting to so or not.\n\nThus the code's order:\n\nInitially end is false.\n\nVertical loop processes and sets end to true if needed.\n\nThen, horizontal loop is run: if vertical set end to true, but during horizontal it can also set to... \n\nWait no. Let me see the Java code:\n\nThe horizontal loop also have their own 'if ( ... > ... ) ... end = true; break;'\n\nso the horizontal loop has to check its own ranges (lsafe and rsafe )\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor ( some loop ):\n\n    ... \n\n    if (lsafe>rsafe) \u2192 set end to true, break.\n\n Hence, if during vertical processing, the end was already true (before horizontal), the horizontal loop still must run its own tests. Wait no, no: because end will be set in all the loops, and each loop can set it. \n\nThus the initial value is false, but after vertical loop may set to true. Then, during the horizontal loop, if any of their conditions are met during its processing, it can also set end to true.\n\n Thus the end's final status is a logical OR between any check triggered in any loop.\n\n So in the Fortran code, after both loops are done, we can proceed to check if end is true, etc. \n\nNow, in the code for the vertical loop:\n\nThen proceed to code for vertical:\n\ndo i_f = n,1,-1\n\n...\n\nend do \n\nIf during the loop, the loop was exited early (via exit), then the loop stops, but the variables are adjusted. \n\nNow, the first loop:\n\nNow, the loop for vertical processing:\n\nusafe = 1 \n\n dsafe = h \n\nend = .false. \n\nAnd then loop do i_f = n downto 1:\n\nthen the code for the loop.\n\nBut before starting vertical loop, set end = false \n\nYes, because in Java the initial for the vertical loop was:\n\nend = false \n\nWait no:\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nThe variables end is initialized to false before entering vertical processing:\n\nboolean end = false; \n\n in the Java code, the variable end is initialized at beginning to false.\n\nThe variables for each dimension are computed sequentially, using a single end flag. \n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nInitialization of end is before both loops. Then, in first loop, if the loop breaks (processes and set end to true), then the code would go to the next loop (so the horizontal loop is executed after). \n\n Even if during the vertical loop the 'end' was set to true, the code proceeds regardless to run the horizontal loop, but the end flag would remain true. Or, perhaps in Java, after the vertical loop, the end's value is either true ( if vertical processing failed) or false otherwise. \n\nHence, in the horizontal loop, the 'end' variable is still there, so if the horizontal loop additionally triggers a condition, it sets end to true again. \n\n Thus in Fortran code the code is okay with once set, it's true. \n\nSo in code:\n\nInitially, the variable 'end' is set to false. The vertical loop runs, possibly setting end to true ( if the vertical condition is met). Then the code goes into the horizontal loop, the end remains whatever (but needs to be checked for re-setting if in horizontal). \n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nprogram agc...\n\n...\n\nread the variables.\n\ns and t arrays.\n\nNow process vertical:\n\nusafe = 1 \n\ndsafe = h \n\nend is still false.\n\nthen the loop.\n\nthen comes the horizontal processing:\n\nl_safe and r_safe.\n\nBefore the horizontal loop, set l_safe, r_safe to initial values (1 and w), and whatever the current value of end is (could be set from vertical loop):\n\nSo:\n\nl_safe =1 \n\nr_safe = w \n\n then do the loop:\n\ndo i_f =n downto 1 \n\n   process the current s(i_f)'s L or R \u2192 l_safe increases if L, else r_safe decreases.\n\n   check if l_safe > r_safe \u2192 then set end \u2192 true, exit.\n\n   then, if i_f>1 \u2192 then get t's char \u2192 adjust the variables.\n\nend do\n\nThis is correct. \n\nThus, the variable 'end' is a global flag which can be set true by either loops, and after both loops, if it remained false, and the test conditions on the starting positions, then the answer is yes, else no.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nThus the full code.\n\nNow, putting all steps:\n\nFirst variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc033b\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc\n\nlogical :: end \n\ninteger :: usafe, dsafe, l_safe, r_safe \n\ninteger :: i \n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t \n\nallocate (s(n), t(n)) \u2192 but n is needed first!\n\nWait order of declarations: \n\nWe have to read n before allocating the arrays. Therefore:\n\nprogram body:\n\nread h,w,n,sr,sc into variables, then read s_str and t_str.\n\nSo, the variables need to be properly initialized. \n\n Wait the code in Fortran would be:\n\nprogram agc033b\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: h, w, n, sr, sc \n\ninteger :: usafe, dsafe, l_safe, r_safe \n\ninteger :: i \n\nlogical :: end \n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s, t \n\n! read input:\n\n! Read the first line:\n\nread(*,*) h, w, n, sr, sc \n\n! allocate arrays \n\nallocate(s(n), t(n))\n\n! Read s and t strings:\n\ncharacter(len=200000) :: s_str, t_str ! assuming input strings can be very long \n\nread(*,'(A)',end=999,err=999) s_str \n\nread(*,'(A)') t_str \n\ndo i=1,n \n\n    s(i) = s_str(i:i)\n\n    t(i) = t_str(i:i) \n\nenddo \n\nend \n\nWait, but if input s_str or t_str have less or more than n characters?\n\nIn the problem statement, it must be exactly n. Since the loop is using i=1 to n. So code expects exactly n characters. \n\nThus, this would work. \n\nNow, proceed to the logic.\n\nNow, writing code:\n\n First, process vertical:\n\n usafe = 1 \n\n dsafe = h \n\n end = .false. \n\n do i =n,1,-1 \n\n     char = s(i) \n\n     if (char == 'U') then \n\n         usafe = usafe +1 \n\n     else if ( char == 'D' ) then \n\n         dsafe = dsafe -1 \n\n     end if \n\n     ! check if ranges gone \n\n     if ( usafe > dsafe ) then \n\n         end = .true. \n\n         exit \n\n     end if \n\n     ! check if i >1 (Java's i>0 \u2192 because if i is the current Fortran index. i starts from n downto 1.\n\n     if (i >1 ) then \n\n         char_t = t(i-1) \n\n         if ( char_t == 'U' ) then \n\n             ! do the math_MIN( dsafe +1, h )\n\n             dsafe = min( dsafe +1, h ) \n\n         else if ( char_t == 'D' ) then \n\n             usafe = max( usafe -1, 1 )\n\n         end if \n\n     end if \n\n end do \n\n! then, horizontal \n\n l_safe = 1 \n\n r_safe = w \n\nend remains as set in vertical loop.\n\nNow process horizontal:\n\ndo i= n, 1, -1 \n\n    char = s(i)\n\n    if ( char == 'L') then \n\n        l_safe = l_safe +1 \n\n    else if ( char == 'R') then \n\n        r_safe = r_safe -1\n\n    end if \n\n    ! check if the horizontal is invalid \n\n    if ( l_safe > r_safe ) then \n\n        end = .true. \n\n        exit \n\n    end if \n\n    ! process if you can, so t's i-1 \n\n    if ( i>1 ) then \n\n        char_t = t(i-1) \n\n        if ( char_t == 'L' ) then \n\n            r_safe = min( r_safe+1, w )\n\n        else if ( char_t == 'R' ) then \n\n            l_safe = max( l_safe -1 , 1 )\n\n        end if \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\n! After all loops, check condition \n\nif ( (.not. end) .and. ( sr >= usafe ) .and. (sr <= dsafe ) .and. (sc >= l_safe ) .and. (sc <= r_safe ) ) then \n\n    print *,'YES' \n\nelse \n\n    print *,'NO' \n\nend if \n\nend program \n\nNow, I need to check the various loops and conditions:\n\nWait in the horizontal calculation's loop:\n\nThe first part: the s current character is processed:\n\nIf 'L', then l increases.\n\nElse if 'R', r decreases.\n\nThen, check if l_safe> r_safe \u2192 sets end to true. \n\nYes.\n\n And then for T part:\n\n char_t is T(i_F -1) , which is correct.\n\nTesting for \"L\" or \"R\":\n\nThe logic mirrors the Java code.\n\nIn code, the critical parts are the variables' assignments and condition checking. \n\nNow, some possible edge cases:\n\nTest case where the starting position is inside the safe zone and no blocks.\n\nExample:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 3 5 1 1 UUDDL RLLRR\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\nn=5. \n\nBut proceeding through the loops may be complicated. \n\nAssuming the code above correctly convert the loops down.\n\nThe final print is after all.\n\nNow, Fortran's intrinsic functions used are min, max, which are intrinsic integer functions.\n\nAlso, checking for the conditions in the loops: 'exit' leaves the loop early. \n\nNow, logical variable 'end' is a global flag, initialized to .false.\n\nNow, possible forbidden characters in s and t need not be checked, as per the problem constraints.\n\nThus, the translated code should be correct.\n\nNow, coding all variables into code.\n\nNow, making sure that the loops have all the steps.\n\nFinal program code in Fortran:\n\nPossible code:\n\nHere's the complete Fortran code considering all the steps:\n\n```fortran\nprogram agc033b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: h, w, n, sr, sc, usafe, dsafe, l_safe, r_safe\n  logical :: end\n  integer :: i, stat\n  character(len=1), allocatable :: s(:), t(:)\n  character(len=200000) :: s_str, t_str\n\n  !
