So this approach is correct. Wait but in the original Java code, the way to sum over unique characters in s2 ensures that for each unique character, you add the total min between the counts. Which is exactly what this code does here, since each c (character in s2's possible set) with count2(c) tells how many times in s2, and for unique, we count each occurrence as per the min.\n\nWait no, because in the code here, when the loop for c=0 to 255, if count2(c) is non-zero, then the min is added, but for example: if the character 'a' is present multiple times in s2, the unique in the java code processes 'a' once, and does min(s1's a count, s2's a count).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what it does first. The problem is probably from Codeforces problem 408B, which I think involves checking two strings and finding some kind of common occurrence. Let me recap the Java code step by step.\n\nThe Java code starts with a class and main method. The main function reads two strings s1 and s2. Then it checks if they are valid using the isValid method. If not valid, output -1. Otherwise, it counts the common characters between the two strings but in a specific way. \n\nThe isValid function checks that every character in s2 is present in s1. If any character in s2 isn't in s1, it's invalid. So in the main, if invalid, return -1, else proceed.\n\nThe main logic involves creating two maps (like dictionaries) for each string counting the frequency of each character. Then, for each unique character in s2, they take the minimum of the counts in both maps and sum those minimums. So the answer is the sum of the minimum counts for each character present in both strings.\n\nSo, translating this into Fortran. Fortran is an older language, so the approach will be more about arrays and loops rather than higher-level data structures like maps and hashmaps. Hmm.\n\nFirst step: Handling input. In Java, Scanner reads from stdin. In Fortran, we can use something like reading into character variables. Since the input is two strings without spaces, we can read them using a read statement. For example, something like:\n\nread*, s1, s2\n\nWait, but in Fortran, strings can be handled with CHARACTER variables. Need to declare their maximum size. But the problem probably has a constraint. The Codeforces problem 408B: I recall that the strings are up to 1e5 characters, but for Fortran, maybe assuming a fixed size for simplicity here? Like 1e5 is too big for arrays, but perhaps the problem allows input of two lines? Or perhaps we'll need to read them correctly. Let me see: the Java code uses s.next(), which would be two tokens separated by whitespace. Wait, no: in the Java code, the code is using next() which gets next token. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput is two strings. Wait, perhaps it's two words separated by whitespace? For example, two strings split by spaces, but not containing whitespace themselves. So in Fortran, when using read*, it would split by whitespace, correct. So that's manageable.\n\nFor the strings, in Fortran we can declare them as CHARACTER arrays.\n\nNext, the isValid function. Let me look again. It checks that all characters in s2 are present in s1. So in Fortran, perhaps first, create an array of characters present in s1, then check each character in s2 against that.\n\nAlternatively, for each character in s2, see if it exists in s1. Hmm. One approach is to create an array or logical flags for each possible character. For example, in Fortran characters are typically between ASCII values. Let's say the code is case-sensitive? The code uses 'containsKey(c), so likely yes, but the problem statement (since it's 408B) probably specifies case. For example, the problem might be about lowercase letters. Alternatively, maybe any printable ASCII. Well, the Java code uses 'char', which is 16 bits, but assuming in the problem it's just standard characters, perhaps using the Fortran ASCII.\n\nSo for the isValid function in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nFunction isValid(s1, s2) result(is_v)\n   logical :: is_v\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s1, s2\n   logical, dimension(256) :: present\n   integer :: i, c\n \n   present = .false.\n   do i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n      c = ichar(s1(i:i))\n      present(c) = .true.\n   end do\n \n   do i =1, len_trim(s2)\n      c = ichar(s2(i:i))\n      if (.not. present(c)) then\n         is_v = .false.\n         return\n      end if\n   end do\n \n   is_v = .true.\nend function isValid\n\nWait, but in Fortran, characters are 1 byte? Or maybe 4 bytes? Not sure. Using ichar to get the ASCII code. So assuming characters are ASCII.\n\nIf that function returns whether all s2's characters are in s1, then in the main program, after reading the strings, first call this function, if not, output -1.\n\nNow the main part is counting the common occurrences.\n\nThe Java code then uses two HashMaps to count frequencies. In Fortran, perhaps arrays to count the frequency. Let's see.\n\nWe can create two integer arrays, say count1 and count2 of size 256 (assuming ASCII), where each element corresponds to the ASCII code. For each character in s1, increment count1(ascii_code). Similarly for s2.\n\nWait, that's a good approach, since it's generally more efficient than hashmaps (and easier to code in Fortran).\n\nWait, in Fortran, declaring the arrays would be straightforward.\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize count1 and count2 arrays, dimension 0 to 255 (since the ASCII is 0-255 for extended ASCII, but maybe 256 elements). Then loop over each character.\n\nSimilarly, in the main:\n\nAfter valid check:\n\nInitialize count1 and count2 arrays to 0.\n\nloop over all characters in s1:\n\ninteger :: c\n\nc = ichar(s1(i:i))\n\ncount1(c) = count1(c) +1\n\nSame for s2.\n\nThen, for the answer, compute the minimum of count1(c) and count2(c) for all c present in s2. The sum of those minima.\n\nWait, in the Java code, it loops through each character in s2 and uses a hashset to process each unique character once. Wait, perhaps the code is making sure that for each character in s2, it only takes the min once. Because in the Java code loops over the s2 characters, but adds the min only once per unique c in s2.\n\nWait, let's read the Java code again:\n\nThey have a HashSet hs to track unique chars in s2. For each c in s2.toCharArray():\n\nif !hs.contains(c), then add to hs, and process it. So this loop is for iterating each unique character in s2. Therefore, for each unique character in s2, get min(m1.get(c), m2.get(c))? Wait, but m2 is the count from s2's mapping?\n\nWait in the code, m1 is counts from s1, m2 from s2.\n\nWait no. Wait the loops:\n\nfor (char c : s1) counts in m1.\n\nfor (char c : s2) counts in m2.\n\nThen for each unique char in s2 (because they are in s2, the loop is going through s2's characters, but using a hashset to track uniqueness), then get x1 = m1.get(c) and x2 = m2.get(c). Then take x1 = min(x1, x2). Then add to ans.\n\nWait, why? Because for each such character, the minimum of the counts in s1 and s2? So that if s1 has more of c, the max that can be contributed is the count in s2, but if the count in s2 is more, but then min?\n\nWait the code is:\n\nans += min(x1, x2). \n\nWait but why? Like, For example, if s1 has 5 Cs and s2 has 3 Cs, then min is 3, meaning you can take 3 Cs from both. But why? Maybe the problem requires the minimum for matching? Like, the maximum possible number of characters that can be formed using the minimum of each character's count between the two? Because the problem was to find the maximum number of times the second string can be formed from the first string, but perhaps with the sum being the total? Not sure what problem 408B is, but perhaps the code's approach is correct given the problem.\n\nWait in codeforces 408B, the problem says: after making two equal strings from s1 and s2 by deleting some characters, such that their lengths are equal and are >=1, what is the maximum possible length of such a string? (Wait or maybe it's similar.) Wait actually, problem B says: two strings s1 and s2. We can delete some characters (any number) from s1 and s2 such that they become equal (order matters?) but any equal strings in terms of multiset?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum total number of common characters between the two, where for each character, we take as many as possible but at most the minimum between the two counts. Because the code does sum the min of each character's count in s1 and in s2? Wait no, the code loops over the unique characters in s2, and takes for each the min between their m1 and m2 counts. \n\nWait m1 is the count from s1, m2 is from s2, so the min between s1's count of c and s2's count of c? Then the total of such mins would be the total number of characters possible where you can have as many as the min between the two counts for each character. But the problem perhaps is to find the maximum number of characters in a common multiset between the two strings, which is exactly the sum over each character of the min counts in each.\n\nYes, in that case, that sum is correct. So the code is calculating exactly that.\n\nSo the problem is probably as I thought: to compute the sum, so in Fortran, the way to compute this is:\n\nWe can first count per-character in s1 and s2, then for each character present in both (since s2 is allowed if all its characters are in s1), the min of the counts.\n\nWait, but in the code, they loop over the characters in s2, and for each unique character (tracked by the hash set). So that for each unique character c in s2, we take min(count1(c), count2(c)), and add that to the sum.\n\nSince all characters in s2 are present in s1 (due to validity check), so for any c in s2, count1(c) is >=1. But in this case, their sum would be the same as sum over all c, min(count1(c), count2(c)), but only over c that are present both in s1 and s2.\n\nBut the code in Java does use the set of characters in s2 (since we process each unique character in s2). So in Fortran, how can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, since the validity check already ensures that for any c in s2, it exists in s1, so count1(c) is at least 1, so we can just iterate over all unique characters in s2, and add min(count1(c), count2(c)).\n\nAlternatively, since count1 and count2 arrays can hold the counts, perhaps we can iterate through all possible characters (0-255?), and for each c, if count2(c) is non-zero (since c is present in s2), then add the min.\n\nThat might be easier than tracking the unique characters in s2.\n\nBecause in Fortran, looping over 256 possible ASCII values is acceptable, since it's a small loop.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me think:\n\nFor each c in 0 to 255:\n\nif count2(c) >0 then\n\nsum = sum + min( count1(c), count2(c) )\n\nBut the check of whether the character exists in s2 is done via count2(c) >0. Since s2's count2 counts how many times it occurs. So this would sum for all characters present in s2 (since count2(c) =0 else), and the min between count1 and count2.\n\nThis would be easier and perhaps more efficient than tracking the unique characters in s2.\n\nBut then in the code, maybe that's the approach to take. So the loops over the arrays can avoid the need for the HashSet.\n\nIn the original Java code, the hashset is to avoid redundant processing for multiple occurrences of the same character in s2. So for each character in s2, when processed again, we ignore it. But doing this with a hashset may be okay.\n\nIn Fortran, just looping through all characters in the count arrays where count2(c) is positive is easier, because you can loop through 0-255.\n\nHence perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst step: read the two strings. But in Fortran, reading strings correctly can be a bit tricky. Because the strings can be any length, but Fortran 90 allows character arrays of adjustable length (if using len=*). \n\nWait the read statement can be:\n\nread*, s1, s2\n\nBut that requires that s1 and s2 are declared as sufficiently long. Alternatively, in Fortran, you can read them as dynamically lengthed. Wait in Fortran 90, you can have variables with allocated length. Let me see:\n\nIn the program, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s1, s2\n\nBut maybe okay to set a maximum length, like 1e5. Since codeforces problem might have constraints up to that size. Alternatively, I'll take s1 and s2 as length 100000 each, or something. Let me say.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nProgram codeforces_408B\n  implicit none\n  character(len=100000) :: s1, s2\n  logical :: valid\n  integer, dimension(0:255) :: count1, count2\n  integer :: ans, i, c\n\n  read*, s1, s2\n  valid = isValid(s1, s2)\n\n  if (.not. valid) then\n    print*, -1\n    stop\n  end if\n\n  ! Initialize counts to zero\n  count1 = 0\n  count2 = 0\n\n  ! Count each character in s1\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s1)\n     c = ichar(s1(i:i))\n     count1(c) = count1(c) +1\n  end do\n\n  ! Count each character in s2\n  do i = 1, len_trim(s2)\n     c = ichar(s2(i:i))\n     count2(c) = count2(c) +1\n  end do\n\n  ans = 0\n\n  ! Iterate over all possible ASCII codes\n  do c = 0, 255\n     if (count2(c) >0) then\n        ans = ans + min(count1(c), count2(c))\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  print*, ans\n\ncontains\n\nlogical function isValid(s1, s2)\n   character(len=*), intent(in) :: s1, s2\n   logical, dimension(0:255) :: present\n   integer :: i, c, len_s1, len_s2\n\n   present = .false.\n\n   len_s1 = len_trim(s1)\n   do i=1, len_s1\n      c = ichar(s1(i:i))\n      present(c) = .true.  ! mark that this character is present in s1\n   end do\n\n   len_s2 = len_trim(s2)\n   do i=1, len_s2\n      c = ichar(s2(i:i))\n      if (.not. present(c)) then\n         isValid = .false.\n         return\n      end if\n   end do\n\n   isValid = .true.\nend function isValid\n\nend program codeforces_408B\n\nHmm, let's check.\n\nBut wait, do we need to use 0-255 or is it 0-256? The array is dimension 0:255, so 256 elements, which covers all 8-bit ASCII codes (from 0 to 255). That's correct.\n\nNow, the variables count1 and count2 must be initialized to zero, which in Fortran can be done with count1=0 and count2=0.\n\nThen, processing each character in s1 and s2, getting their ASCII codes via ichar. Yes.\n\nThen, for the sum, simply loop through all c in the count arrays where count2(c) is non-zero. Since the validity check ensures all characters in s2 are present in s1, there's no need to check for count1(c) being zero. Wait but even if count2(c) is non-zero and count1(c) is zero? No, because validity check ensures that if s2 contains c, then count1(c) is at least 1 (since present(c) was marked). But in the code of the validity function, it loops through all chars in s1 once, and marks present(c) as true. So in the validity function, if any char in s2 is not present in s1, it returns false. Therefore, after the validity, for any c in s2, present(c) was true, which means in the counts for s1, count1(c) must be at least one (since it is present in s1). Thus count1(c) is at least 1, but then in case count1(c)=0? No, because in s1's count, for example, if a character exists in s1, then the count would be non-zero.\n\nWait, suppose s1 contains a character 'a', but in s2 it also has 'a's. Then count1('a') would be equal to the number in s1, which is at least one, and count2('a') would be >=1.\n\nThus, the minimum of count1(c) and count2(c) would be at least 1, and when adding to the ans, that's okay. So this approach is correct.\n\nWait but in the original Java code, the way to sum over unique characters in s2 ensures that for each unique character, you add the total min between the counts. Which is exactly what this code does here, since each c (character in s2's possible set) with count2(c) tells how many times in s2, and for unique, we count each occurrence as per the min.\n\nWait no, because in the code here, when the loop for c=0 to 255, if count2(c) is non-zero, then the min is added, but for example: if the character 'a' is present multiple times in s2, the unique in the java code processes 'a' once, and does min(s1's a count, s2's a count). Which is the same as doing min(count1(c), count2(c)), so it's exactly the same.\n\nThus, this approach is correct and avoids needing a hashset.\n\nSo this Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, check for any possible syntax errors.\n\n- Are the variables initialized correctly? count1 and count2 are dimensioned as 0:255, which should be okay in Fortran.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are dimensioned with the lower bound, so the code says dimension(0:255), which is correct. The first index is 0, then up to 255. Each array should have 256 elements.\n\nIn the read, it's read*, s1, s2. The strings can be read provided they are correctly entered. In Fortran, the read statement will read until the end of the line for each, but perhaps if entered with space-separated, that's okay.\n\nAlso, using ichar: that function returns the ASCII code of the character. s1(i:i) is the substring starting at i, length 1, which is the ith character.\n\nThe len_trim function gives the trailing space-free length of the string, so the loop runs correctly over the characters.\n\nThe function isValid returns true if all s2's characters were present in s1's characters.\n\nNow, the use of the 'contains' keyword to include the function inside the program. Yes, in Fortran, you can have internal procedures.\n\nWait, in the program codeforces_408B, the function isValid is within contain, so it's an internal function. Need to ensure that the code compiles.\n\nAnother possible issue is integer overflow. The problem is that if the strings are large, the counts could be up to 1e5. But in Fortran integers are usually 4 bytes, which can hold up to 2e9, so that's okay.\n\nSo this should be the code.\n\nTesting Edge Cases:\n\nTest case where s2 is entirely in s1. For example:\n\ns1 = \"aabbc\", s2 = \"abc\": the counts for 'a' (2 vs 1) min 1, 'b' 2 vs1 min1, 'c' 1 vs1. So total 3.\n\nAnother case where s2 has more counts, like s1 has 3 'a's and s2 has 5 'a's. Then min is 3. So sum would be 3. So code adds min(3,5)=3.\n\nEdge case where all characters in s2 are in s1. Then the code works.\n\nInvalid case: s1 has \"abc\", s2 has \"abd\". Then 'd' not in s1: output -1.\n\nAnother case where s2 is empty? Probably not according to problem statement, but according to code, if s2 is empty, the code may crash? Wait in Java code, s2.next() would get the second string, so empty input would be caught, but perhaps in the code as written, if s2 is empty (but length 0), the loop in validity function will be zero and returns true. Does the problem require s2 not empty?\n\nThe problem (assuming Codeforces 408B):\n\nThe problem requires that after deletion, the resulting strings have length at least 1. So if s2 is empty, the code will have validity check pass (since s2 has no characters, so they are all present in s1's alphabet), then proceed to compute sum of min(count1(c), count2(c)). However, s2 is empty, so count2 for all c is zero. Therefore, the total sum is zero, so it can't form a non-empty string. Hence, the code would return 0, which would be invalid. But the problem says if you can't form such strings, output -1. Thus, the code's logic needs to be adjusted for this case.\n\nWait, let me check the code's current logic:\n\nIf the validity is passed (because every character in s2 is in s1), then proceed to calculate sum. But if s2 is empty, then s2 is valid, but sum would be 0, so would print 0, but the correct answer would be -1. Because 0 is not allowed.\n\nLooking at the original Java code: in the main method, after the validity check, the code proceeds to compute. If s2 is empty, then the sum would be zero, and the code would print 0, but the problem requires to print -1 if it's not possible. Thus, the code as written in Java is incorrect in that case? Or perhaps the problem has constraints that s2 is non-empty.\n\nWait the problem statement for problem 408B: Let me think. The problem was: \"You are given two string s and t consisting of lowercase letters...\"\n\nThen the problem says that after deletion, the strings must be non-empty and equal. So if one of the strings is empty, then output -1.\n\nWait the original code in Java has the following validity check:\n\nboolean isValid() checks that every character in s2 is present in s1. But if s2 is empty, then it is valid. Because s2 has zero characters, all of which are present? So the code would proceed and compute ans. But in that case, the sum is zero, leading to print 0. Which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the original Java code may have a bug here.\n\nBut the problem expects that the sum must be at least 1, so whenever the total sum is zero (like in case s2 is empty, or even when sum is zero but s2 is non-empty but only has characters that have zero in s1? No, but the validity requires that s2 characters are present in s1, so s1 has at least one count for each. Therefore, if all in s2 are present in s1, then their individual min is at least one?\n\nWait, no: suppose s1 has 'a' once, and s2 has 'a' also once. So sum is 1: okay. But if s2 has only one character but in s1 count is zero? But validity requires that s2's character must be present in s1. So s1 has at least one occurrence of the character. Therefore, the min would be at least 1, so sum is at least 1. So the case of s2 is empty is the only case where sum is zero. Hence, the Java code would erroneously output 0 when s2 is empty. Because the code's validity check allows an empty s2, because all characters (zero) are in s1.\n\nThus, the code has a bug.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to add a check: that s2 is not empty. But the problem's constraints: looking at the problem 408B (from Codeforces), the problem says \"two non-empty strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters\". So the inputs are guaranteed to be non-empty. So perhaps the Java code is okay.\n\nHence, in the Fortran code, perhaps we don't have to worry about empty strings because the problem's input will have non-empty strings. Hence, the code would be okay.\n\nOther tests: maybe characters only in s2 not in s1: returns -1. Correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nHence the final code.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, the variables s1 and s2 are declared as 100000 characters, but perhaps max length is needed. However, using len=100000 is arbitrary. In modern Fortrans, there is an intrinsic function len_trim to get the actual length, which the codes use. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the default for integers is usually 4 bytes, but if the counts exceed 2^31, then it would overflow. However, since the max length per problem is probably up to 1e5, 4 bytes is sufficient (as 1e5 is much less than 2e9).\n\nThus, this should be correct."
