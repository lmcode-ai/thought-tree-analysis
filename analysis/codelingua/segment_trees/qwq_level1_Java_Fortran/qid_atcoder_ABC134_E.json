Thus in initial steps, allocate keys array say:\n\n          input n = input number. then allocate(keys (n), counts(n)), then we can always expand up to size n.\n\n          But when removing keys, the current_size is updated but reusable.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's look through the code step by step and see what it does and how I can translate those steps into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer N from input, then for N times, it reads a number and processes it using a TreeMap. Finally, it sums up all the values in the TreeMap and prints the result.\n\nThe key part here is the TreeMap, which in Java is a sorted map implementation. It allows efficient operations to find the floor key (lowerKey) which is the greatest key less than a given number. Since Fortran doesn't have a built-in TreeMap equivalent, I need to find an alternative approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use an array or a list sorted in order. Since a TreeMap is sorted naturally, in Fortran perhaps an array where elements are kept in sorted order.\n\nThe process for each number:\nFor each number (num):\n- Check if there's a key in the map that's lower than num. That's the lowerKey.\n- If there isn't any such key (so the first element?), then count the occurrence of num and increment its count.\n- Else, take the lowerKey (key) and check its count:\n   - If the count is 1, remove that key.\n   - Else, decrement its count.\n   - Then, for the current num, increment its count (itself).\n\nWait, the process here is a bit tricky. Let's see:\n\nThe main operations are adding to counts and handling the step when the lower key exists. Maybe we can manage the keys and counts in arrays, keeping them sorted so we can perform binary search to find the lower key efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nEach time a new number is added, first find the largest number in the array that is lower than the current number (like binary search). \n\nThen, depending on whether this exists do the following steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a list that's maintained in sorted order. The list would have pairs of (key, count). The steps would be:\n\nFor each number 'num' read:\n\n1. Find the index of the largest element less than num. Let's call that index 'foundIndex'.\n   - If no such element exists (foundIndex is not found), then:\n\n      a. Check if 'num' is already in the list.\n\n      b. If it is, increment its count by 1.\n\n      c. If not, add it as a new entry with count 1.\n\n   - Else (foundIndex exists):\n\n      a. Take that element at foundIndex (key and count).\n\n      b. If the count is 1:\n\n          - Remove the element from the list (since decrement would make count 0).\n\n      c. Else:\n\n          - Decrement the count of that element.\n\n      d. Now for the current 'num':\n\n          - Look if 'num' exists in the list. If present, increment its count, else add it with count 1.\n\nBut how to implement this in Fortran? Since arrays are fixed in size, maybe using dynamic arrays would be better, but in Fortran up to 2003, we have to use allocatable arrays. The user might be using F2008 or later though.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two arrays, one for keys and one for counts. And keeping them sorted at all times.\n\nThe key data structure would be an ordered list of keys, along with their counts. The list must stay sorted, so that when we insert new keys, we can use binary search.\n\nLet's outline possible data structures:\n\nLet\u2019s have an integer array for the keys and an integer array for the counts. Both will be kept in order (sorted order). \n\nWait but inserting elements into the middle of an array is going to be tricky - you have to shift elements, which can be inefficient, but given the constraints. Alternatively, perhaps using linked lists? Probably not in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, for the problem's constraints, perhaps the N is manageable. Not sure, but the problem's constraints may be up to say 1e5 or something? Well, assuming that, then even if using arrays with shifting elements, it might be acceptable.\n\nFirst, the structure:\n\nInitialize keys array (sorted) and counts array (same size as keys).\n\nProcessing steps for each num:\n\nStep 1: find the largest key less than num. Let's call this the lower key. \n\nTo find this key, since the keys are sorted in order, we can use binary search.\n\nLet me structure the keys as an array in ascending order.\n\nNow, binary search for the insertion point of num. The insertion point would be the index where it should be inserted (the first element greater than or equal to num). Then the element before that is the largest key smaller than num. \n\nWait, if insertion point is 'i', then keys(1) ... keys(i-1) are less than num, keys(i) is >= num.\n\nThus, the lower key would be key at position i-1, provided that i>1. \n\nWait, but if the insertion point is zero (num is smaller than first element), then there is no lower key.\n\nWait, so to find the lower key, the insertion point can be found via binary search. Let's see:\n\nsuppose the keys are in an array keys(0 to size-1), but in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. Let's assume keys(1:count), sorted in increasing order.\n\nWe can perform a binary search between low=1 and high= count to find the insertion position of num.\n\nWait, let's write steps for binary search to find the insertion position:\n\nInitialize low = 1, high = n (current number of keys)\n\nSet insertion position (index) to a value such that num < keys[(index)] but >= keys[index-1], if exists. \n\nAlternatively, the algorithm to find the insertion index:\n\nstart with low=1, high= n.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)/2\n\n   if keys(mid) < num then:\n\n       insert_pos = mid+1 \u2192 but need to loop again to find next?\n\n    Hmm perhaps better to outline the binary search steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of code where:\n\ninsert_pos = 1\n\nDo while (insert_pos <= current size and keys(insert_pos) < num) \n\n   We need to track when?\n\nActually, the insertion position is the first index where keys[i] >= num.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nlow =1, high= current size\n\ninsert_pos = current size+1 \u2192 default.\n\nWait another approach.\n\nInitialize insert_pos = 0\n\nSet low =1\n\nhigh = current_size\n\nwhile low <= high\n\nmid = (low+high)/2\n\nif keys(mid) < num:\n\n   low = mid+1\n\n   insert_pos = mid+1\n\nelse:\n\n   high = mid-1\n\nWait, perhaps after the loop, the insert_pos holds the index where num should be inserted. Let me think of some examples.\n\nSuppose keys are 1,3,5,7\n\nLooking for num=4, the mid steps:\n\nFirst, low=1, high=4 \u2192 mid=2 (key 3 <4 \u2192 so set low=3, insert_pos to 3?\n\nWait, maybe a better way. Alternatively, when you have a condition, set insert_pos correctly.\n\nAlternatively, after loop, insert_pos is the first element >= num. \n\nAh yes, the common implementation.\n\nWait here's a standard algorithm:\n\ndef insertion_point(a, x):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(a)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if a[mid] < x:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\nIn this code, 'a' is a list sorted in ascending order. 'x' is the target.\n\nAfter this loop, 'low' will be such that all elements before are less than x, elements from insert_pos onwards are >= x. \n\nThus, in this approach, the insertion position is 'low'. The first index where the key is >= x.\n\nSo, if we use this approach for the keys array, then the lower key is:\n\nif low is greater than 1, then the lower key is keys(low -1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in code, in fortran:\n\nSo for a given num, we can compute the insertion position (low) via binary search.\n\nThus, lowerKey exists if low > 1?\n\nWait, actually, for the keys array, if insertion position is zero (when num is before all elements?), but in Fortran arrays start at 1, so perhaps the positions start at 1.\n\nWait, in the pseudo-code above, when keys array is empty (current keys size 0), the insertion position would be 0.\n\nBut that would be for a new array. Let me think through some examples.\n\nExample 1: The keys array is [1,3,5,7]\n\nLooking for num=4:\n\nbinary search step:\n\nlow=0 (but perhaps in Fortran low=1? Wait in fortran array indices start at 1).\n\nAh right, in fortran, assuming keys(1), keys(2)...keys(current_size).\n\nSo need to adjust indices accordingly.\n\nMaybe initial low =1, initial high = size. \n\nThen the algorithm is similar but adjusted for the fortran indexes.\n\nLet me adjust the algorithm:\n\nlow=1, high=current_size.\n\ninitial insert_pos = something?\n\nWait the code from above would be:\n\nlow = 1\n\nhigh = size\n\nwhile (low <= high):\n\nmid=(low+high)/2\n\nif keys(mid) < num \u2192 then,\n\nthe insertion point is mid+1?\n\nWait better to code it as:\n\n     while ( low <= high )\n\n        mid = ( low + high ) / 2\n\n        if ( keys(mid) < num ) then\n\n          low = mid +1\n\n        else\n\n          high = mid -1\n\n     end do\n\n insert_pos = low  ! After loop, low is first element >= num.\n\nThus, the insertion position is insert_pos. To find the biggest key less than num:\n\nif insert_pos ==1 \u2192 then no element before, since keys(1) is >= num \u2192 so no lower key.\n\nElse if insert_pos is 0 \u2192 but since starting at low=1? Not sure, need to.\n\nWait let's see examples.\n\nExample:\n\nKeys [1,3,5,7]\n\nfor num 0:\n\ninsert_pos would be going through:\n\nInitially, low=1, high=4.\n\nFirst mid=2: keys(2)=3 >0 \u2192 high =1.\n\nmid=(1+1)/2 =1 \u2192 keys(1)=1>0 \u2192 high=0.\n\nloop ends. insert_pos is low=1.\n\nWait but the num is smaller than all elements. So the insertion point would be 1 (since all elements are after), but the lower key would not exist.\n\nWait so if insert_pos is 1 \u2192 then the \"previous\" would be before first element \u2192 no key exists. Correct.\n\nAh okay.\n\nAnother example, num=4.\n\nThe insertion_pos is at 3, since keys(2)=3 <4, so it would go mid steps.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart low=1 high=4.\n\nmid= (1+4)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 \u2192 keys(2)=3 <4 \u2192 low=3, new low=3.\n\nmid=(3+4)/2=3.5 \u21923 \u2192 keys(3)=5 \u22654 \u2192 set high=3-1=2. so new high=2.\n\nNow low=3 and high=2 \u2192 loop ends. insert_pos is low=3.\n\nSo the keys before are keys(1) to keys(2) (3 and 5, no since insert_pos is 3? Wait the keys up to 2? Wait the keys prior to insert_pos (3) are keys(1) to keys(2) since insert_pos is first element >=4. (the keys at position 2 was 3 which is less than, but the key at 3 is 5 which is >=4. So insertion at 3. The key before that (position2) is 3, which is the largest less than 4. \n\nThus, lowerKey = keys(insert_pos-1) \u2192 as long as insert_pos >1.\n\nSo in code, after finding insert_pos, the candidate lower_key is at position (insert_pos-1), if insert_pos >1 \u2192 then exists.\n\nOtherwise (insert_pos=1 \u2192 no key <num.\n\nThus, in Fortran, can implement this.\n\nOnce we find the lower_key, the next steps are:\n\nIf lower_key exists (insert_pos >1):\n\n    key = keys(insert_pos-1)\n\n    val = counts(insert_pos-1)\n\n    if val ==1 then:\n\n        delete the entry at (insert_pos-1)\n\n    else:\n\n        counts(insert_pos-1) = val-1\n\n    then, for the current num, have to add to it's count.\n\n    So then, we need to find where 'num' is in the keys array.\n\nWait the current num may not be in the keys. \n\nAlternatively, after handling the lower_key, we need to increment the count for num.\n\nThe increment could be done by finding in the keys array if num exists. \n\nBecause we are adding to num, since even if it's not present before.\n\nHmm, perhaps:\n\nAfter processing the lower_key, the num needs to be added to the keys and counts with incremented count. But since the keys are sorted, when we add it to the current keys array, we need to insert at the correct position.\n\nThus:\n\nif lower_key exists:\n\n   - adjust the lower entry (if val=1, remove. else decrease count. then,\n\nthen:\n\nNow, dealing with num:\n\nwe have to check whether num is in the current keys array.\n\nWait maybe to find it again, or perhaps since the insertion_pos for the num was holding the first entry equal or larger than num (the lower key's next is the insertion position for num). Hmm, perhaps it's better to do another binary search for num's location.\n\nAlternatively, since insertion_pos found the first element >= num, so if that element is exactly equal to num, then it is already present in the array.\n\nSo:\n\nSuppose after processing the lower key, the current num can be either existing in the array (if insertion_pos's shown a key equal to it, or between elements?)\n\nWait let me see:\n\nAfter the first pass (processing lower_key):\n\nNow, the insertion_pos for the original num is where we'd\n\nWait the step after processing lower key: now need to add the num's count.\n\nTo add the current num's count, need to see if it's already in the keys array.\n\nThus, when the insertion_pos has kurs(LLM) or keys(insert_pos) == num?\n\nWait there are three cases:\n\n1) insertion_pos == 1 and keys(1) == num \u2192 yes, exists.\n\n2) else: the insertion_pos could indicate the first element >= num. To see if any element at insertion_pos equals num.\n\nWait if insertion_pos exceeds current array size, then the num is not present.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe insertion_pos is position (index) where the element is the first one >=num. If that position is at current size+1, then the last element was smaller (so insertion point after array). Or within array.\n\nThe existence of the num is when: if insertion position (index) is <= current array size and keys(index) == num.\n\nSo, to check if num is present: \n\nLet me say:\n\nindex = insertion_pos \u2192 see:\n\nWait:\n\n   check if the index is within array and keys(index) ==num.\n\n   if yes, then we can increment counts at that index. \n\n   else, insert new element at a certain position with count 1.\n\nWait perhaps the following steps:\n\ndesired index is either insertion_pos or insertion_pos-1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps doing a final check\n\nFirst:\n\nif num is in the array:\n\n   increment its count.\n\nElse:\n\n   add it at the insertion_pos position, with count 1.\n\nThus to figure that, we can check:\n\nif (insert_pos <= current_size) then:\n\n   if keys(insert_pos) == num \u2192 yes. \n\nElse \u2192 no.\n\nElse \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, the existence is when exists and key = num.\n\nThus, the code steps can be:\n\nfor the current num:\n\n   find insertion_pos (using binary search on keys array)\n\n   if insertion_pos is 1:\n\n       check if keys(1) == num \u2192 if yes, that's the spot.\n\n   else:\n\n       check if ( keys(insert_pos) == num) \u2192 or keys insert_pos-1 ?\n\nWait perhaps the following:\n\nif insertion_pos is 1:\n\n   first element is keys(1). So, if keys(1) == num \u2192 exist.\n\nelse if insertion_pos <= current_size and keys(insert_pos) == num \u2192 then yes (since that's the first element >= num, so could be equal.\n\nAlternatively perhaps, the correct way to check for the existence:\n\nLoop could be better?\n\nAlternatively, to check existence: the binary search for exactly the number.\n\nAlternatively, just search through the array between insert_pos and get the possible equality.\n\nAlternatively do another search for being equal to num. \n\nAlternatively, the following code could handle that.\n\nOnce the insertion position is found via the loop above:\n\nif (insert_pos > current_size):\n\n   the num is larger than all elements in keys \u2192 doesn't exist.\n\nElse if (keys(insert_pos) == num \u2192 yes:\n\n   then current entry's position is insert_pos.\n\nElse \u2192 no, num isn't present.\n\nBecause insert_pos is the first value >= num, and if keys(insert_pos)!=num, then the element at insert_pos is larger, so the num is not in the keys array.\n\nThus, code steps for checking:\n\nboolean present = false;\n\nint index_in_target =0\n\nif ( insertion_pos <= current_size) then:\n\n   if ( keys(insert_pos) == num ) then\n\n      present = .true.\n\n      index_in_target = insert_pos\n\n   else:\n\n      present = .false.\n\nElse:\n\n   present = .false.\n\nThus, if present \u2192 increment counts at that index.\n\nElse \u2192 need to insert at insertion_pos with count 1. \n\nSo, putting this together, the full process is:\n\nfor each num:\n\n1. Find insertion position in the keys array. (done using binary search)\n\n2. Check if a lower key exists (insertion_pos >1):\n\n   a. if it does:\n\n      i. take the element at position insert_pos-1 (key = keys[insert_pos -1], val = counts[insert_pos -1])\n\n      ii. if val ==1 \u2192 remove that key (i.e., we delete entry insert_pos -1)\n\n          \u2192 so keys and counts array elements shift afterwards. But in arrays, need to handle it.\n\n          \u2192 need to decrement the count and shift elements? or pop it?\n\n          Hmm, in an array, deletion is O(n) time.\n\n      else:\n\n          counts[insert_pos -1] = val -1.\n\n3. Now, the current num will be recorded \u2192 so handle the count for it.\n\n   a. check via insertion position again (maybe the insertion_pos may have changed due to previous deletion?)\n\nWait: The step 2 could modify the keys array. Thus the previous insertion_pos is not valid anymore, unless we recompute it again. But this could complicate.\n\nAh yes here's a problem. Since after handling the lower key (which may delete an entry in the keys array), the array structure changes, so the current insertion position for num is not valid anymore. \n\nSo after step 2, when the keys array was modified, we need to redo the binary search for num's position.\n\nWait but that complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key step is that after handling the lower key, we need to then handle the addition of num's count, which could be done via an insertion into the array.\n\nAlternatively perhaps to re-calculate the insertion position for num?\n\nWait if after deleting an entry, the keys array size decreases, so we can't use the previous insertion_pos.\n\nSo that breaks that approach. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after handling the lower key element, the insertion_pos for num should can be re-computed?\n\nWait but the insertion_pos is needed to process the lower key.\n\nHmm, maybe need to separate the insertions and deletions into steps where the array is handled properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to handle the process in steps that do not modify the arrays between checking where to add\n\nAlternative approach step-wise for each number:\n\n   Let me rephrase the steps algorithm for clarity:\n\nStep 0: Read num.\n\nStep1: Find the floor key (the largest key < num)\n\n   \u2192 this can be found via the insertion position, being the first one >= num. \n\n   So insertion_pos is as before.\n\n   The floor key's index is (insert_pos -1).\n\n   exists = (insert_pos >1 \u2192 if insert_pos >1, then (index = insert_pos-1). \n\nStep2: If floor key exists:\n\n   \u2192 current key is floor_key: \n\n   a. get count: val = counts[index]\n\n   b. if val ==1:\n\n        remove floor_key (so delete index from the array)\n\n    else:\n\n        counts[index] = counts[index] - 1\n\nStep3: Now, add num's count. \n\n   \u2192 Now, we have to find where to put or increase the count for num.\n\n   Thus, we need to\n\n   a. find the insertion position for num again (because the array may have changed in step2 when we removed something?)\n\n   \u2192 So need to perform a new binary search for insertion position.\n\n   OR perhaps? \n\n   Because in step2, if we removed an element before inserting there.\n\n   So if we removed an element from the left of the num's insertion region, then the insertion position might not have changed. Hmm, but could be.\n\nThis complicates things, as rechecking would take time.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that the array is always kept in order, perhaps do the processing in a way that avoids having to re-search:\n\nPerhaps the processing steps can be done after the initial insertion position without modifying the array again except after the step 2.\n\nHmm, but the step2 might involve removing an element, which changes the array's keys and their order.\n\nSo in order to proceed, whenever the array is altered (step2) by deleting an element at position 'index', then the array shifts elements to fill that spot. So the keys insertion position is no longer known.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better:\n\nWhen processing the lower key (index = insert_pos-1):\n\nSuppose we have to delete that key (counts were 1):\n\n   then: \n\n      the array keys and counts will be updated:\n\n      - move elements after the 'index' to left by 1.\n\n      - new count of keys is current_count -1.\n\n   Therefore, when doing step 3 for the num, the keys array has changed.\n\nHence, the insertion position for the num must be recomputed.\n\nAlternatively, to handle all steps in one pass where applicable.\n\nHmm, this could be quite complex in Fortran.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the algorithm can be restructured?\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nWe can represent the keys in a sorted list, but use modular arrays.\n\nIn Fortran, let's use two dynamic arrays keys and counts, which are kept sorted. \n\nStart with two arrays : keys and counts, dynamic arrays that can be extended and shrunk.\n\nBut with fortran's allocatable and pointers, this can be managed but would involve some handling.\n\nAlternatively, a possible approach:\n\nInitialize keys as an empty array.\n\nfor each num in the input:\n\n   compute insert_pos as above (for keys array)\n\n   process the floor key (if exists) as before.\n\n   modifying keys and counts arrays as necessary (including possible deletions):\n\n   then, once that is done, add the current num to the counts.\n\n   To add the num:\n\n      perform insertion into the array at the insertion position (recalculated if needed?)\n\nWait, but perhaps this is manageable if we only process modifications step by step, and then compute the insertion position each time as needed.\n\nAlternatively, let me think:\n\nThe processing is as follows:\n\n1. For the current number, find the floor key (as before).\n\n   \u2192 via insertion_pos.\n\n   If such a key exists:\n\n   a. process its count.\n\n   Now, this may have removed the key from the array (if the count was 1).\n\n   The keys array is now changed.\n\n   So the insertion_pos for adding the current num needs to be re-computed.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can proceed as following steps for each num:\n\nDefine current_old_keys and current_old_counts.\n\nThen perform floor key processing as follows:\n\nFirst, find the insertion_pos based on current_old_keys.\n\nProceed to update the keys and counts arrays there.\n\nBut when you remove the key, the array length decreases by one.\n\nThus, the keys array is now new_keys and new_counts (with one element removed).\n\nOnce that's done, need to add the current num.\n\nNow for adding the current num:\n\n   perform a new insertion_pos on the new (\u53ef\u80fd\u662f changed) keys array.\n\n   then:\n\n   check if it exists in the new keys array via that position.\n\n   if present \u2192 increment count.\n\n   else \u2192 insert at the insertion position.\n\nThus, the steps would need multiple binary searches and handling the array after each change.\n\nBut in code, this is feasible. \n\nSo in Fortran, here's how we could outline the code:\n\nFirst, setup:\n\nWe need two arrays keys and counts. These are allocatable.\n\nIt's easier if they are dimensioned as, say, keys( '*', 1:* ), but in fortran, we must allocate them as Arrays.\n\nLet me plan in pseudocode structure:\n\nInitialize keys array as empty.\n\nWe can start by allocating the array with certain sizes (initial size say 0) or dynamically expanding.\n\nWait Fortran:\n\nWe can use, for example, two integer arrays: keys and counts. \n\nInitially, with a size of say 0 (using allocatable arrays, but need to allocate at least 1).\n\nWait better to allocate with default initial size 0, but handle dynamically.\n\nAlternatively, we can allocate with increments.\n\nAs a starter:\n\nallocate (keys(0), counts(0)), meaning the size is zero, then as we go, resize as needed.\n\nNow for each num (i = 1 to N):\n\nRead num\n\nThen do the following steps:\n\nFind the insertion_pos in the current keys array.\n\n\u2026 need to implement binary search here.\n\nThen:\n\nfloor exists = (insert_pos >1). Because the floor is the element at insert_pos-1.\n\nIf floor exists:\n\n   k = keys(insert_pos-1)\n\n   val = counts(insert_pos-1)\n\n   if val > 1:\n\n       count_k = val-1\n\n       counts(insert_pos-1) = count_k\n\n   else:\n\n       // remove the element at insert_pos-1:\n\n       // shift elements to the left starting at position (insert_pos).\n\n       do j = insert_pos, size(keys)-1\n\n            keys(j-1) = keys(j)\n\n            counts(j-1) = counts(j)\n\n       end do\n\n      // then reduce size by 1.\n\n      size \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0439 can be tracked via variable:\n\n      current_size = current_size - 1\n\n       // now also reallocate the arrays to new size if needed?\n\n      perhaps the arrays are kept as minimum size... but in fortran allocatable arrays can be changed size with reallocation.\n\n      (better to keep track of current_size and limit the array use to current_size)\n\n       // after removing the element, current_size is already decreased.\n\nThus after processing floor key, the keys array and counts have been updated.\n\nNow, need to process addition of current num.\n\nfor the current num:\n\n   // now, need to recompute the insertion_pos based on the current keys array (after possibly removing floor's key)\n\n   compute insertion_pos again using new keys and current_size.\n\n   proceed to see if num exists in array.\n\n   then either increment count or add new.\n\nHmm, but having to call the binary search twice per num is a bit time consuming, but may be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the first operations, when the keys array is tiny?\n\nHmm, but with the possible steps this is necessary.\n\nThus, for the numbers, the outline would be:\n\nfor each num in input:\n\n   // step1: handle floor key:\n\n   // first compute initial insertion_pos (on previous array):\n\n   insertion_pos = compute_insertion_pos(keys(1:current_size), num)\n\n   exists_floor = insertion_pos > 1\n\n   if exists_floor then:\n\n      index_floor = insertion_pos-1\n\n      key_floor = keys(index_floor)\n\n      count = counts(index_floor)\n\n      if count ==1 then:\n\n          // remove it:\n\n          // shift the elements after index_floor left:\n\n          do i=index_floor, current_size-1\n\n             keys(i) = keys(i+1)\n\n             counts(i) = counts(i+1)\n\n          end do\n\n          current_size = current_size -1\n\n      else:\n\n          counts(index_floor) = count -1\n\n   end if\n\n   // Step2: now add the current num:\n\n   // now need to find insertion_pos again\n\n   // but after possible removal of an element:\n\n   compute_insertion_pos again:\n\n   compute insertion_pos2 with the new current array.\n\n   now check insertion_pos2 and:\n\n   // check existence:\n\n   exists_in = false\n\n   if insertion_pos2 <= current_size then:\n\n      if keys(insertion_pos2) == num then:\n\n          index_num = insertion_pos2\n\n          exists_in = true\n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\n   if not exists_in then:\n\n      // not found: so new entry, at insertion_pos2, with count 1.\n\n      // need to insert.\n\n      current_size = current_size +1\n\n      // make room:\n\n      if current_size > size(keys) then:\n\n          // need to reallocate: double size\n\n          new_size = max(current_size, 2_size_type previous_size)\n\n          ! temp_key being a temporary array, but need to copy:\n\n          allocate temp_key( new_size )\n\n          temp_count( new_size )\n\n          temp_key(1:current_size-1) = keys(1:current_size -1)\n\n          temp_count(1:current_size-1)= counts(1:current_size -1)\n\n          deallocate keys, counts\n\n          keys = temp_...\n\n      else:\n\n          // shift elements from insertion_pos2's index forward\n\n          do i= current_size -1, insertion_pos2, -1\n\n              if (i > insertion_pos2) then\n\n                   keys(i) = keys(i-1)\n\n                   counts(i) = counts(i-1)\n\n              end if\n\n          end do\n\n      end if\n\n      // insert at insertion_pos2\n\n      keys(insertion_pos2) = num\n\n      counts(insertion_pos2) = 1\n\n   else:\n\n      // found \u2192 increment count:\n\n      counts( index_num ) = counts( index_num ) +1\n\n   end if\n\nWait but this is all very complex.\n\nThe dynamic resizing with reallocating arrays in Fortran might be error prone, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a linked list structure, but in Fortran that can be difficult.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Fortran approach where the arrays are kept large enough from the beginning?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a different data structure approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of hash tables for counts, but the TreeMap's inherent ordering is important here.\n\nWait considering the problem's functionality, shown in the code, maybe the problem can be modeled in a different way?\n\nThe code in Java is constructing a frequency map (TreeMap), where for each incoming number, we look for\n\nthe previous number (the lower key), then adjust its count, then increase the current number's count.\n\nWait, what exactly is happening? The code might be computing some specific statistics?\n\nWait the problem's problem statement probably requires this logic, perhaps a problem from a competitive programming task. Since it's from AtCoder problem ABC134_E, I should think what that problem is about.\n\nAssuming it is the problem: when processing the sequence of numbers, for each new number, we take the previous number (floor), and take one from its count (until 0). So this may be managing the grouping of consecutive numbers or something?\n\nThe net effect is like constructing intervals, and the final answer is the total counts in the map where if after each step:\n\nFor num, we first take one from the largest key less than num (if possible), then add one to num's count.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of all frequencies.\n\nPossibly the problem is counting the number of elements remaining without being \"taken\" by their next?\n\nNot sure, but regardless the code is performing the steps above.\n\nIn any case, the required translation must do exactly what the Java does.\n\nConsidering time constraints for the solution, given that the Java code uses TreeMap which is O(logn) for insert and find.\n\nThe Fortran implementation must do similar steps but in a way that maintaining a sorted array allows us to do binary search.\n\nThus, after the initial insertion position check:\n\nThe steps can be coded with the arrays being kept sorted and dynamically manageable.\n\nThus, to handle the dynamic arrays:\n\nIn Fortran 90 and later, arrays can be allocatable and resized. So here's the plan:\n\nDefine two arrays: keys and counts.\n\nInitialize allocatable arrays with enough space (initially maybe size 0, then Grow as needed). Or start with some initial capacity (like 1024).\n\nBut in initial phase, we need a size we can modify.\n\nSample steps for the code in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read 'n' from input.\n\nInitialize the arrays:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:)\n\ninteger, allocatable :: counts(:)\n\nallocate(keys(0))\n\nallocate(counts(0))\n\ncurrent_size = 0\n\nThen, read n as suppose variable n = read from scanner.\n\nwend, but in code:\n\nThen read n numbers:\n\ndo i = 1 to N:\n\n   read *, num (using whatever method)\n\n   handle the processing:\n\nthen finally, sum all counts.\n\nWait in Fortran, the input should can be read using read(*,*) statements.\n\nAlright.\n\nThus, steps within the main loop:\n\nFor each num:\n\n   compute insertion_pos for the current keys.\n\n   to compute that:\n\n   need to perform binary search on the keys(1:current_size).\n\n   so implementing that:\n\n   low =1, high = current_size\n\n   insertion_pos = current_size +1  ! Default if all are less.\n\n   do:\n\n      while (low <= high):\n\n          mid = (low + high) /2\n\n          if (keys(mid) < num) then:\n\n              low = mid +1\n\n          else:\n\n              high= mid-1\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\n   insertion_pos = low\n\nAh, so the binary search loop is:\n\n   low = 1\n\n   high = current_size\n\n   do while ( low <= high )\n\n      mid = (low + high)/2\n\n      if ( keys(mid) < num) then \n\n          low= mid+1\n\n      else\n\n          high= mid -1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   insertion_pos = low\n\nThus, after this loop, insertion_pos.\n\nNow proceed with processing floor key.\n\nIf insertion_pos >1 \u2192 suppose it is.\n\nSo if:\n\n   exists_floor = (insertion_pos>1)\n\n   then:\n\n      index_floor = insertion_pos-1\n\n      current_key_floor = keys( index_floor )\n\n      count = counts( index_floor )\n\n      if count ==1 then:\n\n          // remove this key.\n\n          // need to shift elements from index_floor+1 onward to the left.\n\n          // but after shown insert_pos >1.\n\n          do i = index_floor, current_size-1:\n\n              keys(i) = keys(i+1)\n\n              counts(i) = counts(i+1)\n\n          end do\n\n          current_size = current_size -1\n\n      else:\n\n          counts(index_floor) = count -1\n\n   end if\n\nThen, after handling the floor, the array may have changed (current_size could be -1 or remain).\n\n   Now need to process the num.\n\n   Back to keys and counts arrays (at current_size may be updated).\n\n   need to re-find insertion_pos for num in the current state.\n\n   So recompute insertion_p2:\n\n   re-determine insertion position.\n\nNow the steps:\n\n   // new computation:\n\n   low =1, high=current_size\n\n   insertion_p2 = current_size +1\n\n   do while ( low <= high )\n\n      mid = (low+high)/2\n\n      if ( keys(mid) <num ) then\n\n          low = mid+1\n\n      else\n\n          high = mid-1\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   insertion_p2 = low\n\nNow check whether the insertion_p2 points to a key equal to num.\n\n   present = .false.\n\n   if ( insertion_p2 <= current_size) then:\n\n      if ( keys(insertion_p2) == num) then\n\n          present = .true.\n\n          // increment the count.\n\n          counts(insertion_p2) = counts(insertion_p2) + 1\n\n      else:\n\n          // not present: need to insert here.\n\n          present =.false.\n\n      end if\n\n   else:\n\n      // insertion_p2 is beyond current_size \u2192 need to place there.\n\n      present = .false.\n\n   end if\n\n   if ( present ) then:\n\n       ! done, count increased.\n\n   else:\n\n       // insert at insertion_p2.\n\n       // Need to make space for new element.\n\n       // first: increase the current_size by 1.\n\n       current_size = current_size +1\n\n       // if the current array can't hold this:\n\n       // assuming we dynamically can reallocate.\n\n       ! Need to check that.\n\n       ! first check if current count is within the array size.\n\n      if ( current_size > size( keys ) ) then:\n\n          // Need to reallocate.\n\n          ! prolong the array.\n\n          Allocate temporary array with double size (or add 1).\n\n          allocate temp_keys(1: 2*size(keys) or something?)\n\n          Hmm, alternatively, suppose initial allocation was 1:\n\n          \u81f3\u5c11 need to grow.\n\n          ! Let me see:\n\n          ! Maybe grow to current_size + some increment (e.g. twicing):\n\n          new_size = current_size * 2\n\n          ! or just current_size +1 can be better.\n\n          new_size = current_size\n\n          if ( current_size > size( keys ) ) then\n\n              new_size = current_size *2\n\n          else:\n\n              new_size = size(keys) + 1000? or current_size +10 ?\n\n          \u7adf\u53ef\u80fd this\n\n          allocate( temp_keys( new_size ), temp_counts( new_size ) )\n\n          ! copy the current keys_old arrays to new.\n\n          ! copying the current elements:\n\n          do i=1, current_size-1:\n\n              temp_keys(i)=keys(i)\n\n              temp_counts(i)=counts(i)\n\n          end do\n\n          ! \u91ca\u653e\u539f\u6765\u7684 keys and counts.\n\n          deallocate(keys, counts)\n\n          keys = temp_keys\n\n          counts = temp_counts\n\n          ! \u8fd9 is just one way, but possibly handling it with realloc may need better management.\n\n          However, in practice, when-testing code, perhaps just check that the arrays are sufficiently large. But since the initial after shrinking may have keys size less than current_size, this is error-prone.\n\n          Alternatively, use move_alloc.\n\n          Fortran has move_alloc subroutine.\n\n          Since reallocating the dynamic arrays is possible, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\n          Alternatively, preallocate the arrays to a large maximum size. (e.g. 10**6)\n\n          Since the problem's constraints could be up to 1e5 steps, but with each step potentially requiring array insertion up to that.\n\n          So maximum possible keys is N (if all numbers are unique then each a new key). So preallocating to N may be sufficient.\n\n          Thus in initial steps, allocate keys array say:\n\n          input n = input number.\n\n          then allocate(keys (n), counts(n)), then we can always expand up to size n.\n\n          But when removing keys, the current_size is updated but reusable.\n\n          Thus this may a better approach for contest coding.\n\n          So perhaps the following:\n\n          first read N.\n\n          Then allocate the arrays with size N (maximum possible).\n\n          then set current_size =0.\n\n          Then in the loop:\n\n          Proceed normally.\n\n          Every time we need to extend current_size up to size N.\n\n          Thus the insertion to the current array would be possible.\n\n          Because the maximum possible size of keys is N, since each number added can possibly there.\n\n          So initial allocation with size N is viable.\n\n          This can avoid resizing with allocations and possible errors.\n\n          This is perhaps the way to go.\n\n          Thus, in code:\n\n          read *, n\n\n          allocate(keys(n), counts(n))\n\n          current_size =0\n\n          then in the main loop:.\n\n          Thus, with this setup, no array resizes are needed.\n\n          So when the current_size reaches n, but can this occur?\n\n          Since inserting num can at most increase current_size to n.\n\n          because each of the n steps can add at most one new key.\n\n          Thus maximum number of elements is n.\n\n          So this should can.\n\n          Thus following this approach.\n\n          So, the code can be structured with arrays of size n. Bypass reusable.\n\n          Now returning to the algorithm.\n\n          After having computed insertion_p2 where to insert:\n\n          if not present, then we need to:\n\n          shift the elements from insertion_p2 to current_size:\n\n          do i = current_size, insertion_p2, -1:\n\n               keys(i+1)=keys(i)\n\n               counts(i+1)=counts(i)\n\n           end do\n\n           keys( insertion_p2 ) = num\n\n           counts( insertion_p2 ) = 1\n\n           current_size = current_size +1\n\n          else if present \u2192 we do the increment.\n\n            counts( insertion_p2 ) = counts(insertion_p2) +1\n\n          end.\n\n          So this loops.\n\nNow handling the steps including the array shifts:\n\nThus, the pseudo-code for the processing phase:\n\nAfter first part (floor key gestion):\n\nre-compute the insertion position for after the possible changes:\n\ninsertion_pos_final = compute_insertion_pos again.\n\nCheck if the number exists at that position.\n\nIf not exist:\n\n   - We have to insert new key at pos2.\n\n    \u8fd9 needs inserting:\n\n    - Move elements from pos2 to current_size -1 \u2192 to \u53f3 by one.\n\nThus copy back.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncurrent_size was S, then current array has elements from 1 to S.\n\n\u65b0\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u4e8e pos2\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 \u7a7a\u95f4 must make room.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = S down to pos2:\n\n   keys(i+1) = keys(i)\n\n   counts(i+1)= counts(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen insert the new keys(pos2)=num, count\u662f1.\n\nand current_size increases by 1.\n\nSo the loop moves elements from current_size down to pos2, but current_size is increased after insertion? Hmm.\n\nWait initial current_size is the count before insertion.\n\ncurrent_size is first S.\n\nAfter insertion, \n\nthe code would increment current_size by 1, so new size is S+1.\n\nThus, when moving:\n\nFor each index from current_size down to pos2 (inclusive):\n\nthe indices \u81f3 current_size (index) +1\u9700 be shifted.\n\nWait \u9700 to shift from current_size downwards first.\n\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\n\n\u5982\u679c we have current array size S, we are inserting at pos2 (new insertion point).\n\nThe loop should range from current_size to insertion_p2 \u7684 starting point.\n\nWait\uff1a\n\nThe inserted position is \u81f3 position = insertion_p2.\n\nThe code can be implemented as:\n\nif not present:\n\n   current_size_before = current_size\n\n   // we need to insert at position 'insertion_p2'\n\n   // so make space:\n\n   do i = current_size_before, insertion_p2, -1:\n\n          if (i >= insertion_p2) then:\n\n             keys( i+1 ) = keys( i )\n\n             counts( i+1 ) = counts( i )\n\n          end if\n\n   end do\n\n   // now set the inserted\n\n   keys( insertion_p2 ) = num\n\n   counts( insertion_p2 ) = 1\n\n   current_size = current_size_before +1 \n\nThis would shift the elements from position 'insertion_p2' onwards to the right by one, then inserting the new entry.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, all possible shifts and adjustments can be managed.\n\nThus, this is doable in Fortran with arrays allocated of size N (since maximum possible keys is N).\n\nIn code:\n\nNow, putting everything together step by step.\n\nThus, here's the plan:\n\nRead N.\n\nallocate(keys and counts arrays of size N.\n\ncurrent_size initialized to 0.\n\nloop N times:\n\n   read num.\n\n   compute insertion_pos:\n\n   call binary_search sub-sub with the current keys array up to current_size.\n\n   process the floor key:\n\n   - check existance: if insertion_pos>1.\n\n    then proceed as per:\n\n    - \u83b7\u53d6 index_floor = insertion_pos-1.\n\n    - get count.\n\n    -\u5982\u679c count\u662f1:\n\n       // remove it:\n\n       loop from index_floor to current_size-1:\n\n           keys(i) = keys(i+1)\n\n           counts(i) = counts(i+1)\n\n       end loop.\n\n       current_size -=1\n\n    else:\n\n       counts(index_floor) = count-1\n\n  \u7136\u540e compute \u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684 inserting position for adding the num (after possible array\u66f4\u6539\u4e86)\n\n  Now:\n\n   recompute insertion_p2 using the current array (current_size new) to see if the num exists.\n\n  proceed to insert.\n\n  \u8fd9\u662f\uff1a\n\n  compute insertion_p2 via the same binary search.\n\n  determine whether the num is present there \n\n  then decide increment or insert.\n\nThe code would thus \u8981\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u6b21 binary search per num.\n\nThis is complex but doable.\n\nNow let's code this.\n\nFirst, the binary search function.\n\nBut in Fortran 90:\n\ncan we make a function or subroutine to perform this?\n\nYes.\n\nFor example:\n\nsubroutine find_insertion_pos(keys, size_keys, target, insertion_pos_out)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: keys(:), size_keys, target\n\ninteger, intent(out) :: insertion_pos_out\n\ninteger :: low, high, mid\n\nlow =1\n\nhigh = size_keys\n\ninsertion_pos_out = size_keys +1\n\ndo while (low <= high)\n\n   mid = (low + high)/2\n\n   if (mid > size_keys) then\n\n   \u7b49 ect checks cause array out of bounds?\n\n AH need to ensure that mid is within_size.\n\n \u5bf9\u7684 in the loop.\n\n but being a in subroutine, it should be handled correctly.\n\nThus:\n\n      mid = (low+high)/2\n\n      if ( keys(mid) < target ) then \n\n          low = mid +1\n\n      else\n\n          high = mid -1\n\n      end if\n\nend do\n\ninsertion_pos_out = low\n\nend subroutine\n\nThus, the subroutine can be called to find the insertion position.\n\nBut in Fortran, subroutines need explicit argument passing.\n\nSo in code\uff1a\n\ncall this subroutine when need compute insertion positions.\n\n put  it inside the main code.\n\n.\n\n \n\nNow the main block:\n\n program atcoder_ABC134_E\n\n implicit none\n\n integer :: n, i, num, current_size\n\n integer, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\n integer :: insertion_pos\n\n integer :: insertion_pos_final, index_floor, count_val\uff0c found\n\n begin:\n\n read*, n\n\n allocate(keys(n), counts(n))\n\n current_size =0\n\n do i=1,n\n\n     read*, num\n\n    !
