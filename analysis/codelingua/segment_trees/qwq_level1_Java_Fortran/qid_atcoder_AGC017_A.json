    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I should look through what the Java code does. Let me see.\n\nSo, the Java program calculates some combinatorial numbers and outputs the result based on even and odd numbers. The main steps:\n\nIt has a method C(n, m) which computes combinations, similar to \"m choose n\". Then in main, it reads n and p, then the next numbers to find counts of even (k0) and odd (k1) elements. Then compute the answer as follows:\n\nThe answer is initialized to 1, multiplied by 2^k0. Then depending on p being 0 or 1, it adds up certain combinations for the k1 terms:\n\nIf p is 0: sum over even i (from 0 to k1, step 2) of C(k1, i), multiply to ans.\n\nIf p is 1: sum over odd i (from 1 to k1 step 2) of C(k1, i), multiply to ans.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loops were for adding terms. The sum is over all i with parity matching p mod 2 (since p can be 0 or not). So the code mainly uses combination formulae multiplied by 2^k0, and summed over certain terms for the odd counts.\n\nSo, translating this code to Fortran:\n\nFirst, Fortran is a bit different. Functions need to be declared. Also, integer variables are declared differently. The combination function C(n, m) will need to be a function.\n\nStarting with the combination part. The Java C(n,m) returns a big integer, which means we need to handle arbitrary precision. Hmm, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in bignum library. Wait, does it? Well, Fortran has some modules for large numbers, perhaps through the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module or perhaps using external libraries? Alternatively, since the problem might have constraints that make the numbers manageable with integers. Wait, in the original problem statement, AGC017's question, I should think what constraints are there. Wait, I might not have the problem statement, but the code uses java.math.BigInteger, so the values could be extremely large. \n\nHmm, problem here is that Fortran doesn't natively handle arbitrary precision arithmetic as easily as Java. So maybe this requires using some external modules or perhaps the problem actually fits within Fortran's integer limits?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using 64-bit integers? Let me see. Let's look at the problem. Suppose the code is for a programming contest problem, AGC017 A. So let me recall that contest. \n\nAGC017 A: Parity is simple. The problem was: You have some dice (indices from 1 to n), each die has some numbers. When rolled, each die gives a number x_i (which is even or odd). The total product's parity must be P (0 for even, 1 for odd). The question is the number of ways the dice can be rolled so that the product's parity equals P mod 2. \n\nWait, according to that problem, perhaps the numbers can be up to a certain size, but according to the approach, the code seems to calculate the number of subsets of dice such that the product's parity is P. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The problem statement's solution:\n\nEach dice is considered to contribute its parity (0 if even, 1 if odd). The product's parity is the product mod 2 of all these parities. But that's equivalent to the XOR of 0 and 1's parity (no, product mod 2 is the sum of the exponents of 2 mod 2, but actually, the product of numbers with even parities will be even unless all are odd. Since if there's an even number, the product is even. Wait, so the product is even if at least one even term? No, no: any even multiplicative term makes the product even. Or rather, the product is even if any number is even, because once any even number is multiplied in, the product is even. But the product's parity is 1 (odd) if and only if all terms are odd. \n\nWait that can't be right. Let me clarify. Let me think: product of numbers mod 2 is 0 if any of the numbers is even. It's 1 mod 2 only if all numbers are odd. So the total number of ways where the parity is 0 (even product) is total ways minus the ways all are odd. \n\nWait, but in the AGC problem, each die can have some sides. The product's parity is determined by the product of the parities of the numbers rolled on each die. \n\nWait, the example from the problem's solution approach in the code: the code is separating the dice into k0 (even x's) and k1 (odd x's). \n\nFor k0, since their parity is even (since x_i is even), but the product's parity is determined by how many of the odd (k1) terms are multiplied. Because all the even terms contribute 0 parity, but their selection (or value) doesn't affect the parity of the product except through the odd terms. Wait no, actually, no. Wait the product's parity is equal to the product of the parities of each x_i chosen. Since any x_i even contributes 0 to that product (since the product will be even). So if any x is even (i.e., in k0), then the product's parity is 0. So the only way to have the product be odd (parity=1) is to have *NO* dice from k0 chosen, and all chosen dice from k1 must be chosen such that the count of their odd dice's terms is odd? \n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused. Let me see the code again. Looking at the Java code:\n\nWait the code counts k0 and k1.\n\nThen the answer starts as 1 * 2^k0 ? Wait, 2 to the k0. So for each of the k0 even numbers, you have two possible choices (for each even element which is even, perhaps in the problem, each can choose between some options). Wait, the code's variables names are a bit unclear without the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the problem requires choosing some subset of the elements where the product's parity matches P. So for each even x (k0), their contribution will make the entire product even if selected, but if you have to choose none of them? Or maybe there's a different condition.\n\nWait I think the problem is that each dice has several options, and you choose one per dice, and the product is even or odd. So the count is the total number of ways to choose such that the product's parity is P.\n\nIn such a scenario: \n\nThe problem is:\n\nWe have N dice. Each die has some results when rolled (probably with different counts, but the given code's approach suggests that the input is a list of the parities (even or odd) of the possible outcomes for each die?)\n\nWait, looking at the code, the user inputs N and then a list of N numbers, then counts the number of entities. Wait, no. The code's for loop: it reads the list of x integers (for input numbers). But in the code's main function:\n\nn is the number of elements in the list, p is the target parity (0 or 1).\n\nThey are counting the number of ways to choose a subset of numbers (or perhaps all dice are rolled, and which way? Oh wait, perhaps it's about flipping signs or something else? Hmm perhaps I should look at the code's logic again.\n\nIn the code:\n\nThe k0 is the count of even x's and k1 count of odd x's. \n\nThen, the following steps:\n\nans starts as 1 and is multiplied by 2^k0. Hmm. 2^k0 could be because each of the even dice has two possible options that are not affecting the parity (but since they're even, selecting any of their options (assuming even options?) would make the product even. But the code is trying to calculate cases where the parity is P. \n\nWait, perhaps for each even die (k0), the selection can be either chosen or not, but since that even die's contribution to parity is even (if at least one chosen, product is even), but I'm getting confused here. Wait maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let's see the code logic again. The code computes ans as 2^k0 multiplied by (some combination terms for the odd dice).\n\nThe combination terms are like, for the odd dice (which have x's odd), the count of selecting subsets with an even or odd number of them, depending on p. Because the product's parity is the product of their choices. Because all odd numbers multiplied will be odd only if an even number of them are chosen? Wait, no, actually the parity is the product of all the choices' parities. Since each odd die, when selected, contributes a number which is odd. So the parity of the product of the selected elements is determined as follows:\n\nThe total parity is the product of all the selected elements mod 2. \n\nSince even elements (those in k0) contribute to parity as 0 (even * something is even). So any element from k0 in the chosen subset will make the overall parity even. So to reach parity 1 (odd), we cannot have any elements from k0 in the chosen subset. Therefore, the only way to have the product's parity be 1 is to choose none of the k0 elements. Hence, the 2^{k0} factor is when considering parity 0, since each of them can be included or not. Wait, but the code multiplies 2^k0 regardless of p?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires choosing exactly one option from each die, not a subset? Maybe the problem's actual setup is different. Let me try to think: if each die i has some numbers, and you pick exactly one number per die, and the product's parity must be P. \n\nAh that's probably it. Because when you have to pick one per die, the product's parity is sum of the factors mod 2. \n\nIn that case, for each even die (k0), choosing any of their numbers will contribute an even term; but since even times anything is even, so the presence of any even (non-odd) die numbers in any chosen will make the overall product even. Wait no, that's not right. Wait if you have even one even die chosen, the product is even.\n\nSo to have overall parity 1 (odd), we must choose only odd elements from all the dice. That requires all chosen numbers must be odd (so that their product is odd).\n\nThus, the total number of such possibilities where product is odd is the product for each die_i: the number of odd options available on die i. \n\nIf any of the dice has an even number (so the die's options include at least an even number, so choosing it would ruin the oddness), then that particular die's contribution must choose an odd number. Otherwise (if the die has no odd options), then if P is odd, then it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that for each dice, you can choose to include or exclude its contribution? \n\nThe code in the Java seems to multiply 2^k0. So when k0 is the number of even-source elements: for each even element, perhaps each can be chosen or not, but only affects the parity. Wait, for example, if you have an even number, then including it into the product will automatically make the total even. So the choices of the even dice contribute a factor depending on whether including them affects the total parity. However, the original problem's structure may not be similar, but perhaps a subset is chosen from all the dice elements (i.e., selecting a subset S, and the product is over all elements in S). Then the parity is based on the product of all selected elements.\n\nIn that case, to have parity 0 (i.e., even product), any subset with at least one even element is counted. Or subsets where the sum's parity is 0, etc. But it's difficult to parse the problem without its exact description, but the code's logic is clear.\n\nIn the code's case:\n\nAfter counting k0 (number of even numbers x_i, since when they are even, perhaps the choice of x_i contributes to parity).\n\nWait let's see: the initial ans is 2^k0, meaning that each of the even elements can be either selected or not, but since any selection of an even's x would contribute to making the product even, so perhaps the code's logic is considering the even elements as independent (each contributes a factor of 2, so choosing to include or not). \n\nThen, for the odd elements (k1 of them), which contribute to the parity only when their count is even or odd.\n\nAh, okay, so in total, the even elements can be chosen to be in or not (so count as factor 2^k0). Then for the odd elements, the product's parity depends on the selection of the odd elements. Each odd element's inclusion gives a multiplier of their own parity (odd) which is 1 mod 2. So the product of all selected odd elements will have a parity of 1 iff the number of selected odd elements is odd. If even, then the product's contribution would be even? Wait no, the product of an even number of odds is odd squared, so 1 mod 2. Wait no, any number of odds multiplied: each odd number is 1 mod 2, so the product of multiple odds is 1*1*... =1 mod 2. Wait, no, if you multiply two odd numbers, their product is odd (1*1=1 mod2). Similarly, any number of odd terms multiplied together will give odd (parity 1). So the product of selected \"odd\u8bdcumbers will be odd (so overall total parity 1 mod2) if and only if there are an odd number of them selected?\n\nWait no: if you select m odd\u8bdcumbers, each of which is odd (1 mod2), then the total product modulo 2 is 1 mod2, regardless of m. Because 1*1*... (m times) is still 1 mod2. Unless you have even or zero, but still. So this can't be. \n\nAh, this indicates a misunderstanding. Hmm so if I'm considering that the subset is selected, then the parity of the product is:\n\nIf any even number is selected, then the product is even (0 mod2). If no even numbers are selected, the product's parity is (number of odd selected elements mod 2: that doesn't matter. Wait because multiplying 1's any number of times: even or odd counts would give 1 mod2. So, in that case, the parity would be 1. Wait, so, if you don't include any even numbers and select any subset of the odd numbers, then the product's parity is 1 (odd). So the total answer is:\n\nWait let me think through the problem:\n\nThe problem may be as follows: given N numbers, choose a non-empty subset of them such that their product's parity is equal to P. Wait but the original code counts the number of subsets where the product's parity is 0 or 1. \n\nAlternatively, considering exactly choosing a subset S: product of elements in S's parity is P mod 2.\n\nThen:\n\nCase1: P=1 (product is odd). Then S must contain no even numbers, and can contain any subset of the odd numbers (including subsets of size 0? but maybe non-empty). Wait, but subset must be non-empty?\n\nAlternatively, assuming subset can be empty? The problem statement probably requires non-empty subset, but the code might have something different.\n\nWait looking at the code's calculations:\n\nThe answer is initialized as 1, then 2^k0. The 2^k0 comes from the even \"k0\" can be either included or not. But if P is set to the desired parity, how do these contribute.\n\nWait the code's calculation for the part of the product with even elements:\n\nIf any subset includes any even number, then the product is even. So, to get parity P:\n\n- For P=1: we must not choose any elements from the even numbers (k0's elements must all be excluded), so for k0 elements, you can't choose any. So the 2^k0 in the code's ans_hint would suggest otherwise. Hmm, so perhaps my assumption is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each even element has two choices (maybe whether to select it or not), but since including it would contribute to an even product. The code constructs an answer as follows:\n\nans = 2^{k0} * Sum, where Sum is over possible selections of the odd elements.\n\nWait the Sum depends on whether P is 0 or 1.\n\nLet me think step-by-step.\n\nSuppose the total number of subsets with product parity P is computed as follows:\n\nThe product's parity is even (P=0) if:\n\nEither,\n\n- At least one even number is selected (then product is even),\n\nOR,\n\n- All selected numbers are odd, but any subset of them will have a product that is odd (1 mod2), so those subsets contribute to P=1 only.\n\nSo the total subsets with even parity are:\n\n(number of subsets where at least one even is selected) +\n\n(number of even selections exclude all evens, and the subset of odds has an even count?)\n\nWait that's getting too confusing. Let me think in terms of complementary counts.\n\nThe code's approach in the Java:\n\nans starts as product of (for each even: can choose to include or not, but such selections contribute to the count)\n\nWait the ans is first multiplied by 2^k0. which would be the total subsets, if there were no constraints except the parity. Or maybe it's the exponent part:\n\nThe problem is perhaps each element can either be chosen or not, except considering that when you choose a subset, the parity must be P. So total subsets:\n\nFor even and the odd elements:\n\nThe even elements (k0) contribute 2^k0 subsets (either included or not in the subset), but if even any of them are included, then the parity of the product is 0 (even). The thing is, these even elements can be included or not, but their inclusion affects the parity.\n\nHence, to compute the total subsets where the product is P:\n\nCase 1: P =0:\nThe subset can include any combination, unless they are all odds and their count is even (so product is odd). No, actually, any subset containing at least one even gives parity 0, so:\n\nTotal subsets with parity 0: total subsets without restriction minus those subsets that are all-odd and have parities P=1 (so only the all-odd subsets with the required parity).\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is as follows:\n\nThe total for subsets with parity P can be computed as:\n\nans = (sum over all possible choices of including or excluding even elements * the sum over subsets of odd elements with certain parities).\n\nAlternatively, the even elements can be included in any way (multiply by 2^k0), and the odd elements need to be selected in a way such that their inclusion contributes the correct parity.\n\nWait let's break it down:\n\nThe total is:\n\nFor parity 0: total subsets where either they contain an even element, or they don't contain any even and the number of chosen odd elements is even (since the product's parity of all odd elements must be 1 mod2, but that's for parity 1, so for parity to be 0, either one even is selected, or an even number of odd elements are chosen. Wait, no: The all-odd subsets with even count of elements: the product would be (1)^even =1 mod2, but P is 0. So that would require an odd count of odd elements for parity to be 1 mod2, but for zero parity, if you have all-odd, you want the total to be even?\n\nWait this is a bit tangled. The key idea from the code logic is that the even elements can be included or not (so 2^k0 options), and for the odd elements, you need to choose a subset whose count of elements has the right parity. \n\nWait according to the code's calculation:\n\nWhen p is 0 (target even):\n\nThe total is 2^k0 multiplied by the sum over even i (0 to k1 step 2) of C(k1, i). Here, the \"i\" is the number of odd elements chosen. So for each selection of even or odd numbers in the odd elements (i even) when combined with any choice of even elements (so if any even elements are chosen, the total parity is already even (so counted here as well?). That's conflicting: the even elements contribute to even.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the code is considering that the selection of even elements is free (so multiplied by 2^k0), but when even elements are included, their contribution to the parity is 0. \n\nWait maybe the parity is exactly the product of the parities. So:\n\nThe product's parity is (product of all chosen elements mod2). The elements have certain parities (1 if odd, 0 if even).\n\nThe product mod2 is 0 if any even element is chosen. Otherwise (only odds chosen), the product mod2 is the sum over their parities (mod2?) Or maybe the product is multiplied: but the product of bits is just the AND. Since each even is 0 mod2, so if any is included, the entire product is 0 mod2.\n\nThus, the total subsets with product parity P equals 1 will be only the subsets that are entirely composed of odd elements, and the number of elements selected among those odds is such that the product's parity is P.\n\nThe number of such subsets is the sum_{i with (-1 evenness as per P)} C(k1, i). \n\nBut when P ==1, then:\n\nThe product of all the odd elements' selected must be odd (which they are, any number of odds, since multiplying odds gives odd). So the Parity of their product is 1 regardless of how many are selected (as long as it's at least one?). Wait, no:\n\nIf you select an odd-count number of odds, their product is still 1 mod2. Same for even count. Because multiplying 1s any number of times gives 1. So actually, the product's parity of any subset of only odds is 1 mod2 (unless no elements are selected). \n\nThus, the only way to have parity P ==1 is to select non-empty subsets of the odd elements. \n\nWait, this is conflicting with the code's approach, which uses:\n\nWhen P ==0, the sum over even i, and when 1, the odd i terms, etc. So maybe the code's logic is different. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nFor p ==0:\n\nadd is sum of C(i,k1) for i even (0, 2, ...) up to k1.\n\nWait, C(i,k1) is the number of ways to choose i odds elements. \n\nThus, for the case when you have to choose a subset of exactly i odds and any combination of evens (excluding any even elements to avoid 0 parity). Wait no. Alternatively:\n\nThe code's logic is that the even elements can be chosen in any way (so 2^k0), but the odds are constrained so that either (the subset has no evens and the sum of odds gives a certain parity), or whatever.\n\nWait, the code's ans is:\n\nThe product of 2^k0 multiplied by (sum for i terms of combinations of choosing i odds -- when p is 0, even numbers of odds, so that the total product is odd (the odds only) with even count, leading to parity 1, but then multiplied by the even's selection which?\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach in code is considering:\n\nThe subsets that have even parity are the (all subsets that have at least one even OR selections of all odds with an even count. \n\nWait, but the logic of the code's computation is:\n\nThe ans is 2^k0 (so the even elements can be chosen freely: either or not. Wait 2^k0 is the product when considering that each even can be included or excluded in any way. Then, multiplied by the sum for odds:\n\nFor p=0: the add variable is the sum of C(k1 choose i) where i is even. Thus, when adding these to the ans, it represents:\n\nThe combinations of choosing an even number of the odd elements, so that their product is (even count) leading to parity 1 (mod2) from the odds (if they are selected). However, if any evens are selected, that would set the parity to 0. So this approach might not align well because there's an OR between two scenarios.\n\nWait the code could instead calculate the number of subsets where the total product parity is P. The total is:\n\ntotal = (ways with at least 1 even) * 1 (since they automatically parity 0) if P is 0, plus or multiplied with the ways where 0 evens and the odds count has the right parity for P.\n\nBut the code's ans:\n\nIt is 2^k0 (total ways of selecting even subsets any way: that is, any subset for the evens but must count something?) Wait perhaps the code's logic is that the even elements' terms don't affect since whatever chosen (including none):\n\nThe count for the even elements is 2^k0 (since each even can be selected or not). Then for the odds:\n\nTo achieve P target parity, the odds must form a subset that when multiplied gives P mod2. But since multiplying odds gives 1 mod2 unless selected none.\n\nThus:\n\nIf P is 0: then either:\n\n- there is at least one even chosen (so the subset includes evens), contributing all subsets where even is chosen (sum over even selections with at least 1) and any subset of odds multiplied by that. \n\nOR:\n\n- no evens are chosen, but the product of odds is 0 mod2 (so they have an even count? not possible \u2014 product is 1 except when 0 elements. \n\nWait this is getting tangled. Maybe it's better to trust the code's approach.\n\nIn any case, assuming that the code is correct and I need to translate it into Fortran, focusing on the code's structure.\n\nStructure of code: \n\nFirst, the combination function C(n, m):\n\nIn Java: public static BigInteger C(int n, int m) which calculates the combination m \"choose\" n. Wait wait, perhaps the function is called as C(n, m) returns C(m, n) where n <= m? Because the loops are from (m -n +1) to m for multiplying, divided by n!.\n\nWait yes, that's exactly the definition of \"m choose n\".\n\nThe code's C(n, m) is computing C(m, n) as: \n\nC(m, n) = product_{i=1 to n} (m -n + i) / n! \n\nWait the first for loop in the function is for the product in the numerator: for (int i = m -n +1; i <= m; i++) so starting from m -n+1 up to m, inclusive, which is exactly m choose n's numerator term.\n\nThe numerator is (m)*(m-1)* ... down to (m -n +1) --> the product over i from (m-n+1 to m), so yes. The denominator is n!.\n\nTherefore the C() function returns binomial coefficient \"m choose n\".\n\nNow translating that function into Fortran:\n\nFortran functions can be written with allocate-ability for big integers? Since the Java code uses BigInteger, but fortran implicit types may not be sufficient. So assuming that the problem is to use Fortran's 64-bit integers (since 64-bit integers can handle very large numbers, but given the constraints, must the binomial coefficients stay within 32 or 64 bits?)\n\nAlternatively maybe using bignum or relying on the problem constraints.\n\nAssuming the problem's constraints are small enough to fit in 64bit integers. Let's see, in an AGC problem (AtCoder Grand Contest), typically the constraints can be large, but given the problem is labeled A, perhaps n is up to 1e5? No, probably C(m, n), where m and n are numbers that their coefficients can be up to 1e18 or so (since 20 choose 10 is ~184K, 40 choose 20 ~ 1e12, 50 choose25 ~ 1e13. Oh, wait Java's BigInteger is necessary because for m like 2e5 or so, it would be huge.\n\nWait the original code uses the variables n and m, but the input n (number of elements) can be up to, say 2e5? Then the combination C(k1, i) could be very large, so using Fortran's integer(8) would not be sufficient. Thus, perhaps for this problem, using bignum is required, but Fortran doesn't natively support this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased to have modulo 1e9+7 or something, but the code doesn't have modulo; the problem requires output as the exact number. \n\nHmm, this might be an issue. So in Fortran, perhaps using 64-bit integers is insufficient for large combinations. Also, coding the combination function in Fortran would require a recursive or iterative approach with bignum libraries. Since the user hasn't specified a particular Fortran module, maybe I have to assume using 64-bit integers, but that might risk overflow. Alternatively, maybe I should use Fortran's intrinsic functions where possible, but there's no built-in combinatorial functions.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The original code used Java's Bigint to avoid overflow. So perhaps I have to implement the combination function using integers with limited precision, but perhaps in the problem's constraints it's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem's case, the binomial coefficients C(k1, i) can be summed over the required terms (i even or odd), but I'm not sure. Let's proceed, but note that in the Fortran code, we'll have to use some big integer implementation.\n\nIn standard Fortran libraries, perhaps we can use a module like ISO_FORTRAN_ENV to get integer limits, but for the purposes of this question, perhaps the user expects the same approach as Java's, using OOP isn't there, so this would require a functional programming approach.\n\nSo step by step translation:\n\nFirst, function C(n, m) in Fortran.\n\nAssuming that it returns a big integer via a module. Alternatively, since Fortran doesn't have built-in big integers, maybe we can use double precision floats, but that loses precision. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows precise handling with 64-bit integers. \n\nWait let me see:\n\nThe code is written for the online judge, which may have constraints on N (like N up to 20 for example) but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps within the problem's context, the combination's summation can be calculated modulo some number?\n\nBut given the problem outputs the exact value, this is unsure. \n\nAssuming the user is okay with implementing the combination function which may overflow in practice but is required here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binomial coefficients can be computed as per the code, using integer division.\n\nThus, proceed by writing the combination as a function that multiplies and divides with integer variables. \n\nIn Fortran, functions can be made using recursive or iterative methods. Since the combination function is straightforward for integers, even without bignum, but we have to consider the integer size.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop to compute the binomial coefficient using an efficient prime factorization method to keep numbers manageable?\n\nBut this is getting complex.\n\nGiven that the original code is written with the combination function that might handle this, perhaps the code should be implemented with the same approach, even if the numbers might overflow, but the problem might have constraints allowing this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's constraints are small. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the problem is AtCoder Grand Contest 017 A (problem A), so that the online problem probably has constraints that the combination numbers are manageable.\n\nLet me see the problem statement (from memory, since I can't see it): \n\nAGC017_A problem: \u300cParity\u300d. The problem states:\n\nYou are given N numbers and a target P. Each number is either even or odd. You can choose any subset of the numbers (non-empty?), perhaps each number is a certain option's parity? The problem wants the number of subset whose product has parity P (0 for even, 1 for odd).\n\nWait, according to the sample input:\n\nSuppose the first example is like:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 0\n\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 7.\n\nExplanation: The subsets can be any subset except the three odds (1,3) would give parity 1?\n\nHmm, the sample input has two even numbers? So in this case, the code's logic may compute:\n\nk0 is count of even (2 is even, so one element, so k0=1, and k1 = 2 (the 1 and 3 are odd). P is 0.\n\nThe ans starts at 2^k0 =2.\n\nAdd is sum over i even from 0 to 2 steps. \n\nThus, for i=0: C(2,0)=1\n\ni=2: C(2,2)=1\n\nThus add is 1+1=2. Total ans is 2*2=4? Hmm but the sample output is 7. Hmm, that doesn't match. Hmm perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nThe sample output for input 3,0 and elements 1,2,3 would be: the target parity is even (0).\n\nSo the subsets where the product is even are all subsets except the subsets consisting of both odds (but no even). The total subsets: 2^3=8 (since each of 3 numbers can be chosen or not; minus the empty set? wait no, perhaps non-empty.\n\nWait the problem statement might require non-empty. Let me see:\n\nSuppose N=3, the subsets are 8 total (including empty). So for parity 0 (even):\n\nThe subsets which have an even product are:\n\nAll subsets that include the even number (2), plus the subsets of the two odd numbers excluding the case where both are selected. Wait:\n\nIncluding even number: any subset containing 2. That's 3 non-empty as subsets are 2, and entries with 2 plus any combination of 1 and 3.\n\nThe number of subsets containing 2 (including just {2}) equals (2^2)*1? Wait subsets with containing 2 can be formed by 2 plus any combination of the other two (excluding the empty combination). Or, considering the non-empty requirement, the count where subset includes 2 (non-empty):\n\nThe number is (2^(number of elements excluding 2)) which is 3?\n\nWait perhaps it's better to compute via the code's approach.\n\nLet me calculate via the code's code for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 0 \u2192 n=3, p=0\n\nThe next numbers are 1,2,3 \u2192 which are two odd (1 and3) and one even (2).\n\nTherefore:\n\nk0=1 even elements, k1=2 odd elements.\n\nThe code's calculation steps:\n\nans is initialized as 1, multiplied by 2^k0 \u2192 1*2 =2\n\nThen, since p=0, the add is the sum of C(i, 2) where i is even: i=0 and i=2\n\nC(0,2)=1 (choose 0 out of 2 is 1)\n\nC(2,2)=1.\n\nAdding gives add=2. \n\nThen multiply 2 * 2 \u2192 4, and print it. But the correct answer is 7. So this contradicts.\n\n\u663e\u7136 the code is no correct? Or the problem's parameters are different.\n\nWait, so my initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the number of subsets (including empty) where the product's parity equals P. However, the sample input's result is 7:\n\n total subsets: 8. The empty subset's product is undefined (or treated as 1?), but assuming the problem requires non-empty subsets:\n\nThe even product subsets are:\n\nAll subsets containing the even element 2 (3 elements can combine with 2 in various ways):\n\nHow many subsets include 2?\n\nTotal subsets with 2: each subset has 2 selected, and can choose 0/1 or both of the other two (1 and3). So the count is 2^2 =4 subsets (the two elements plus 2).\n\nThese are all acceptable (they are non-empty and include 2, thus product even).\n\nNon-empty subsets not including 2 are the subsets composed only of 1 and/or 3:\n\nThese are: {1}, {3}, {1,3}.\n\nOf these, the products are:\n\n1: product's parity 1 (odd), \n\n3: same,\n\n{1,3}: 3 \u2192 multiplicative parity is (1 *1) =1. \n\nThus, these three have parity 1. Since the target is P=0, they are excluded.\n\nThus total is 4 + (how many all-odd selections with even count)?\n\nWait, all-odd subsets with even count: two odds selected (i=2) would give product 1 *3=3 (parity 1 for P=0 \u2192 not selected). \n\nWait this is conflicting again. \n\nHmm Sample Input1's output is 7 according to the problem. So the correct total is 7.\n\nThus when P=0, the code's calculation must get 7.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation for the example, it would return 4. \n\nHence the code must be incorrect, or my analysis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively maybe the code assumed that the even elements' factors are multiplied by the choose terms, but the add computes including the possibility to choose none of the evens.\n\n\u518d later \u770b the code's ans is multiplied by (2^k0):\n\nIn the code's example: 2^1=2 multiplied by add(2) gives 4. But the correct answer is7. So something's wrong.\n\nWait the code could have a mistake. Alternatively my understanding is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the problem considers \"choosing a subset\" where each element can be 0 or 1 choices (if any even element is present, product is even).\n\n Thus, all subsets that contain at least one even are good for P=0. The number of subsets with at least one even:\n\nThe number of non-empty subsets that include at least one even:\n\nTotal subsets (non-empty) is 2^3 -1 =7.\n\n The even number is 2. All subsets except those that are subsets of {1,3} and are non-empty: the non-even subsets are {1}, {3}, and {1,3}, totaling 3.\n\n Thus total subsets passing P=0 would be 7-3=4. Which matches the code's output. But sample input's correct answer is7. Thus no.\n\nTherefore there's a mistake, but it\u2019s clear that without the problem statement it's hard to deduce. Perhaps the code treats the answer as including empty subsets, which are counted.\n\nThus in the first example, the empty subset has parity (1\uff1f product of nothing is 1?), so for P=0 the should not count it. If including empty subset:\n\nTotal subsets with even parity are 4 (subsets with even element) + (how many all evens with chosen elements where some are even: the subset is empty or has evens? Not sure.)\n\nAlternatively perhaps the code is correct and the sample output is different? \n\nAlternatively, maybe my analysis is incorrect.\n\nIn any case, the code given apparently uses the combination function C(i, k1). \n\nThe main issue is translating that into Fortran, even if there is an overflow problem. I have to proceed.\n\nNow, for the Fortran translation:\n\nStart with the combination function.\n\nIn Fortran, function procedures can return big integers, but without a bignum library, that's hard. So perhaps the problem requires it to, even though there's overflow risk.\n\nAlternatively, assuming variables can handle it.\n\nAssuming that the combination function can be written as:\n\nFUNCTION C(n, m) RESULT(res)\n  INTEGER(8) :: C\n  ! Wait, but even 64-bit may be insufficient for large combinations like 1000 choose 500 requires around 1e299).\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires using the combination calculations with factors cancelling early.\n\nThe original code's combination is implemented as:\n\nBigInteger res = 1;\n\nLoop from (m -n +1) to m. Multiply each into res. Then divide by 1 to n.\n\nSo for C(n,m), it\u2019s binomial coefficient m choose n.\n\nIn Fortran, with integer arithmetic, we can do the same.\n\nFUNCTION bin(y, n) RESULT (res)\nINTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: y, n ! computes m choose y, where n is m? \n\nWait, perhaps variables need to be renamed. The original function C(n, m) is 'n' is the k, m is the total.

But let's suppose the problem allows it.\n\nNow the main function:\n\nIn Fortran, the main program is usually starts with implicit none and reads inputs.\n\nThe code:\n\nprogram main\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, p, x, k0, k1, i\ninteger(8) :: ans, add, res\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\n\nread*, n, p\n\nk0=0\n\nk1=0\n\ndo i=1, n\n   read*,x\n   if (mod(x,2) ==1) then\n      k1=k1+1\n   else\n      k0=k0+1\n   end if\nend do\n\nans = 1\ndo i=1,k0\n   ans = ans *2\nend do\n\n!* \n\nif (p ==0) then\n    add =0\n    do i=0, k1,2\n       add = add + bin(i, k1)\n    end do\nelse\n    add =0\n    do i=1, k1,2\n       add = add + bin(i, k1)\n    end do\nendif\n\nans = ans * add\n\nprint*, ans\n\ncontains\n\nFUNCTION bin(k, m) \n  * see above\n\nend program\n\nWait, but need to declare the function inside, or in a module.\n\nIn Fortran 90, the function can be placed inside with contains.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, writing this step by step.\n\nFirst, the binomial function inside the contains section.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nans starts as 1, then multiplied by 2^k0 \u2192 equivalently ans = 2**k0.\n\n instead of a loop multiplying 2 each time.\n\nThus ans = (2**k0) \u2192 which can also be done as ans = 2**int(k0, 8)).\n\nSimilarly, maybe writing the loops for adding the bin terms.\n\nAlso note that in the code's C() function in Java, when the code loops over 'i' up to k1, etc.\n\nIn Fortran code, the loops should be from 0 to k1 in step 2 for p=0, etc.\n\nWait in the Fortran code in the p=0 branch:\n\nwe start at i=0 with a loop up to k1. But in the code, the steps were for loops like:\n\nfor (i=0; i<=k1; i+=2):\n\nso in Fortran, do i=0, k1, 2.\n\nSimilarly for the additions.\n\nNow, the code may have issues with integer overflow, but given the user wants the code translated, proceed.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\nprogram main\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, p, k0, k1, i\ninteger(8) :: ans, add\n\nread(*,*) n, p\n\nk0 = 0\nk1 = 0\ndo i = 1, n\n    integer :: x\n    read(*,*) x\n    if (mod(x,2) == 1) then\n        k1 = k1 +1\n    else\n        k0 = k0 +1\n    end if\nend do\n\nans = 1\nans = ans * (2_8**k0)\n\nif (p == 0) then\n    add = 0\n    do i = 0, k1, 2\n        add = add + bin(i, k1)\n    end do\nelse\n    add = 0\n    do i = 1, k1, 2\n        add = add + bin(i, k1)\n    end do\nend if\n\nans = ans * add\n\nprint*, ans\n\ncontains\n\n    !

Hmm, possible discrepancies here.\n\nWait the user's problem maybe the sample's output isn't 7? \u82e5 the code works as per the user's question's requirement to have correct code, then perhaps the problem is present, but perhaps there's a mistake in the code\u3002\n\n\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001 perhaps the code is correct. For the first example, the code gives 4, but the wanted output is7, which suggests a mismatch, but perhaps the problem requires including the empty set?\n\nIn the initial problem's sample, the output is 7 (the user claims the code's code is correct?), so there's a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps my analysis is off.\n\n_AVAILABLE table elucidate the problem\n\nIn the sample input 1:\n\n3 0\n\n1 2 3 \u2192 the even count is 1 (number 2), k0=1, odd count k1=2 (1 and3).\n\nthe code:\n\nans starts as 2^1 =2.\n\nthen, the add was sum over even i of C(i, 2):\n\ni=0 \u2192 C(0,2)=1\n\ni=2 \u2192 C(2,2) =1. \n\nadd =2 \u2192 2*2 =4\u662f the code's output.\n\n but the correct answer per the \u6559\u5e2b's sample is7.\n\n\u8fd9 suggests the code is wrong. \n\n perhaps the code is counting something else.\n\n perhaps the problem is to count the total number of subsequences (including all having product\u2019s parity) with the following.\n\n the problem's correct calculation for the sample:\n\n target P=0 even product: all subsets that have at least one even.\n\n the number of such subsets is 2^3-1 (non-empty) subsets containing the even element?\n\n The total subsets that include at least one even:\n\n the even is number two. How many subsets have it?\n\n total subsets with two are 2^2 *1 ( the elements other than two can be chosen or not) \u2192 total is (2+1)^2 or 2^2=4? Including the subset {2} itself, yeah 2^(number of others elements) \u2192 2^2=4 subsets that contains 2 (including the other elements chosen\u4efb\u610f).\n\n However these subsets can also be non-empty. The total non-empty subsets containing the even:\n\n the number is (2^3 - 2 ^2) \u2192 no, \u4e0d\u3002 \n\n total non-empty subsets containing at least one even:\n\n total non-empty subsets:7.\n\n the non-empty subsets that do not include any even numbers are the non-empty subsets of the two odds. \u8fd9 is 3: {1}, {3}, {1,3}.\n\n thus the total subsets that have at least one even is 7 -3 =4 \u2192 the code's result\uff0c so if the problem is to count the subsets, including empty\u3002\uff0c then the empty subset has parity 1. Thus for P=0 the code includes the subset of even elements chosen but perhaps other conditions.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the empty subset as parity 1 (product 1), thus the desired output would count the empty in the zero parity case only if the parity is zero? No, because 1 is not even.\n\n thus\uff0c total for the sample input:\n\n P=0 requires the subsets with even product:\n\n all subsets (including empty) with any even element: \n\n \u603b subsets with at least one even:\n\n total subsets with \u54ea 2 is included: 2^(\u6570\u91cf of other elements) \u21922^2 =4 subsets including\u5df2\u88ab 2 (including the empty subset? \u4e0d\uff0c maybe the empty subset isn\u2019t in. \n\n this is confusing. \n\n perhaps the'd the code is correct but the sample input's correct output is 4\uff0c but perhaps the user assumeded a different problem. \n\n since the user's code might be correct according to the intended solution, I just need to translate it.\n\n therefore proceed with the translation.\n\n thus, the Fortran code should follow the above logic, so the code above is correct even if my test case analysis is off. \n\n So the final Fortran code should look like:"
