Wait the code's logic is, for each position i (starting from 1):\n\nif current character (s[i]) is equal to the previous (s[i-1]), then the current position contributes +1 to the cumulative count, and the cumulative up to this point is previous +1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, the problem is translating the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads a string, then calculates a cumulative array where each entry counts the number of consecutive duplicates up to that position. Then, for each query, it outputs the difference between the cumulative values at positions r and l-1.\n\nAlright, Fortran might have some differences in handling strings and arrays. Let me think about each part step by step.\n\nThe main class and Fast class: Since Fortran doesn't have classes like Java, I'll need to convert this into a program with subroutines. The main part in Java reads input and processes with the Fast class's sol method. So in Fortran, we'll have a program that does all that.\n\nStarting with the Fast's sol method. The first part reads a string. In Java, StringTokenizer is used, but in Fortran, perhaps reading a line and then parsing it with internal reads would be better. Wait, but the input here is a single line where the first token is the string s. So first line is read, split into tokens, and s is the first token. In Fortran, maybe just read the entire line, then split into tokens? Or just read the first string directly?\n\nWait, the first line contains the string followed possibly by other things? No, the problem description probably needs to be considered. Let me see: the first input line is the string, then queries follow. Because looking at the Java code: the first line is read, then the first token is s (the string). The next line is the number of queries q, then q lines. Wait, in the Fast sol method:\n\nFirst line is read via StringTokenizer, nextToken gives the string s.\n\nThen the next line is read for q (Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken())).\n\nWait, no, actually in the code, after the first line (the String s), the second line is read to get the number of queries. Because:\n\nAfter initializing the cum array, the code does:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); // this reads the next line, which is the q.\n\nWait, no, wait the code steps:\n\nIn sol():\n\n- Read first line (probably the string s and maybe some other stuff, but according to problem statement, perhaps the first line is just the string. The problem for codeforces 313 B might require s as the input string, then q queries. So the first line is s, the second line is q, then q lines with l and r.\n\nTherefore in Java, after reading the first line, the first token is s. The rest of the tokens (if any) may not matter, but probably the first line is just the string. So in Fortran, the program would read first line, extract the string, then read the next line to get the number of queries, then read each query line.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nThe program would read the first line into a variable s. Then read the number q from the next line. Then read q more lines, each with l and r.\n\nNow for processing the string s to compute the cumulative array.\n\nIn Java, the array cum is of length s.length()+1. But in Fortran, arrays start at 1? Or can start at 0? Not sure, but Fortran arrays can start at any index but by default start at 1. Wait, in Fortran you have to declare the size and the start point.\n\nWait, for the array cum in Java, it's [s.length()+1] elements, initialized cum[0] = 0, and cum[s.length()] = 0. The loop is from i=1 to s.length() - 1. Because: the loop in Java says for (int i=1; i < s.length(); i++). Wait wait: the Java loop is from i=1 to s.length() - 1? Because the end condition is 'i < s.length();', so the maximum i is s.length()-1. Because the initial i=1, increments by 1 until i is less than s.length().\n\nWait the loop is for (int i =1 ; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\nSo i runs up to s.length()-1? Let me check. Let's say s is of length N. Then loop runs when i less than N. So i runs 1 to N-1. Because when N is the length, then when i=N-1, it's less than N but next increment would go to N, which is the end. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose s.length() is 5, then i starts at 1, increments until i reaches 4: because 4 <5 is true, so yes, up to 4.\n\nSo the loop covers i=1 to i= N-1, where N is the string length. The code in that loop: if the current character (i) and previous character (i-1) are the same, then cum[i] = cum[i-1] +1, else same as before.\n\nThe array cum is size s.length() +1 (so indices 0 to N in Java), but in the code, after initializing cum[0] and cum[N] (original code has cum[s.length()] =0; which is the index N where N is s.length(). So when building cum[1] to cum[N-1], the initial values? Because the array is initialized with cum[0] and cum[s.length()] (N) set to zero. The rest may have been zeroed by default?\n\nWait Java's Integer array is initialized to zero by default (since it's an object, but auto-initialized to null?) Wait Integer is a class, so new Integer[] will have nulls. Oh wait that's a problem. Wait, the code in Java initializes cum as Integer array. So in Java, for an array of Integer (which is an object type), the elements are initialized to null. The code then sets cum[0] and cum[s.length()]. \n\nBut then the loop is filling from i=1 to s.length()-1, so the other entries (like cum[N], which is the last one, but that's at s.length()=N) would have been set. The rest (e.g., cum[N-1], which is before) are set by the loop.\n\nWait but in the code above, the way the array is declared is:\n\nInteger cum[] = new Integer[s.length() + 1];\n\nSo in Java, this creates an array of s.length()+1 elements, all of which are null by default. Then the code does:\n\ncum[0] = cum[s.length()] =0;\n\nWait, but that sets cum[0] and cum[s.length()] (the last index) to zero. The other cum elements (those not indices 0 and N) are null. Then the loop: for i from 1 to s.length()-1 (so up to N-1):\n\nThe code uses cum[i-1], which for i=1 is cum[0], then cum[i]. So when i=1, cum[i] is initially null (except for cum[0] is set to zero). Wait this would be a problem. \n\nWait, hold on! In Java, if you have a new Integer array, all elements are null. Then cum[0] and cum[N] are set to 0. The rest are null. But in the loop, when building the cum[i], it depends on cum[i-1], which could be null. Wait that would be a bug.\n\nWait, the initial code must have a mistake here. Are the other elements properly initialized?\n\nWait looking back at the code:\n\nThe Java:\n\npublic void sol(BufferedReader br, PrintWriter pw) throws IOException {\n    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n    String s = st.nextToken();\n    Integer cum[] = new Integer[s.length() + 1];\n    cum[0] = cum[s.length()] = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {\n        if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) cum[i] = cum[i - 1] + 1;\n        else cum[i] = cum[i - 1];\n    }\n    ... // the rest\n}\n\nBut wait, the array's indices run from 0 to s.length() (since length+1 elements?), so for a string of length n, the indices are 0,1...n.\n\nWait the loop runs i from 1 to s.length() -1. So for i =1 to N-1 where N is s.length().\n\nWait then, for instance for i = N-1 (which is largest i in the loop), then:\n\ncum[N-1] = cum[N-2] + something (or not).\n\nWait but when N is the length of the string, the loop doesn't iterate to i = N. \n\nWait but the array's cumulative up to the end may be needed. Because when processing a query from l to r, they use cum[r] - cum[l-1], where r can be up to the string length. Maybe in the problem description, the queries are 1-based?\n\nHmm, this is a bit of confusion. Let's think of possible test case. Let me take a simple example. For example, if s is \"01\", then N is 2. \n\nSo cum array is size 3 (indices 0,1,2). cum[0] =0, cum[2] =0.\n\nThe loop runs i=1:\n\nCheck s[1] and s[0] (since i was 1). Suppose \"01\": characters 0 and 1 are '0' and '1', so they are different. So cum[1] = cum[0] (0), so cum[1] becomes 0. cum[2] is 0.\n\nThen for a query l=1 (assuming l starts at 1?), r=2, then cum[2-1] is cum[1], which is 0? Wait, but the code says 'r is parsed as st.nextToken())-1; so r is decremented? Wait in the code:\n\nIn the loop over each query:\n\n            Integer l = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()), r = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()) - 1;\n            pw.println(cum[r] - cum[l - 1]);\n\nAh, so the r is parsed from the second value then subtracted 1. Let me see:\n\nSuppose a query line is \"1 2\" (so l=1, r=2 in original indexing?), but then r becomes 1 in the code's variable r (since we do r = r -1).\n\nThen the formula is cum[r] - cumulative[l-1].\n\nBut the way the code is set up, the cumulative array's initial 0 and then Nth index is 0. Let me think the logic: the cumulative array is supposed to count the number of consecutive duplicates up to a certain point.\n\nWait maybe I'm missing the exact problem statement, but perhaps the original problem requires to compute the number of pairs in the substring [l, r], where l and r are 1-based, inclusive? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is that for a substring from position a to b (in 1-based indices?), the number of times same consecutive letters would be the difference between cumulative at position b and one before a.\n\nWait regardless, perhaps the code's cum array is built in such a way that it counts the number of same Adjacents up to each position. So for each i, cum[i] is the number of consecutive duplicates in positions 0..i-1 ?\n\nWait thinking again:\n\nAt position i (0-based? Because s.charAt(i)), in the loop (i from 1 to s.length()-1). The condition:\n\nif s[i] == s[i-1], then the current one is a consecutive duplicate, so cum[i] = cum[i-1] +1.\n\nBut then the cum array accumulates the count of consecutive pairs up to index i-1?\n\nWait for example, if the string is 'aa', then:\n\ns has length 2. The cum array is size 3 (indices 0-2).\n\ncum[0] =0, cum[2]=0.\n\nLoop for i=1 (first 'a' and previous 0 is also a (since index 0 and 1? So at i=1, the characters are s[1] and s[0]: if they are 'a' and 'a', then cum[1] = cum[0] +1 (0 +1=1). Since cum[0] was 0.\n\nThen for i=2? Oh wait no, the loop goes up to s.length() (which is 2) minus 1? So loop runs until i < s.length().\n\ns.length() in the two 'a's case is 2. So the loop runs for i=1 (since 1 <2). The code's loop stops there. Then cum[1] would be 1, and the cum array is then [0,1,0]. \n\nSo a query with l=1 and r=2 (the entire string), then r is parsed and subtract 1: r becomes 1. So the formula is cum[1] - cum[0], which is 1-0=1. Which is correct, since between 1 and 2 (the two a's) there is 1 pair. So that seems correct. \n\nAnother example: s is 'aba', length 3, indices 0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'a'. The loop runs i=1 and 2.\n\nFor i=1 (characters 0 and1 : 'a' vs 'b', so no addition. cum[1] = cum[0] =0.\n\ni=2 (char2 is 'a' vs previous b. Not same. So cum[2] remains cum[1] (0). \n\nThe cum array is [0,0,0,0] (since length is 3, so cum[3] is 0. So for a query l=1 to 3 (which r is 3, so after subtraction 2, so position 2?), then cum[2] - cum[0] would be 0, which is correct (since only 'ab' and 'ba' which have no consecutive same pairs).\n\nOKAY, so the logic works.\n\nNow to translate this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, the structure:\n\nThe main program will read the string, then process.\n\nFortran has fixed arrays, and variables are declared at the beginning. Let's think about variables.\n\nWe need to read the input string. In Fortran, reading a character string can be done with a line:\n\nread(*,'(a)') s\n\nBut the length of 's' is needed. Alternatively, use a character array of fixed size.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to read the first line as a string, then get its length.\n\nBut first, in Fortran:\n\nWe can start by reading the entire first line into a character variable. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s ! assuming max size is 1e5? The problem constraints may dictate a size, but for now, a large enough.\n\nThen the first line is read:\n\nread(*, '(a)', advance='no') s \n\nWait, in Fortran, the default can read until end of line, but I might need to use a fixed length. Hmm. Alternatively, use a list-directed read where you read a string, but it might ignore leading blanks. Alternatively, read the line as a string. \n\nWait in Fortran, you can read a line with a specified format, like:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s_line\nread(*, '(a)') s_line \n\nBut this would read the entire line, up to new line. Then get the actual string, e.g., the first token. Because the original Java code's first line is read with StringTokenizer which splits on any whitespace. But the first line is probably the string s. So perhaps the first line contains nothing else, so the entire line is s.\n\nWait the problem says that in the first input line is the string s, so I can read the entire first line into s.\n\nThen the next line is the integer q (the number of queries). Then each subsequent line has the parameters l and r.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, start with:\n\nprogram codeforces_313_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: q, i, L, R, n\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: cum\n\n    ! Read the string s from the first line\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n    n = len_trim(s) ! get the actual length without trailing blanks\n\n    allocate(cum(n+1)) ! cum has indices from 1 to n+1 ? Or is it 0-based?\n\nWait in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless specified otherwise. Wait, no, you can use any bounds. So let me decide the array indices.\n\nWait the original code's array cum in java was 0-based (indices from 0 to s.length()), i.e., size s.length() +1.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can make cum(0:n) where n is the length. But fortran requires declaration with the upper bound.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn Java: \n\ncum.length is s.length() +1. So for index 0 to N (N = s.length())\n\nSo to replicate this in Fortran, perhaps declare cum as an array of size n+1 (since indices 0 to N need to fit.)\n\nBut in Fortran arrays can be declared from 0 to N:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n) :: cum\n\nWait but 'n' is a variable, so we need an allocatable array. Alternatively, since in Fortran:\n\n   etcetera...\n\nAlternatively, first read the string s, determine n = len_trim(s). Then allocate cum(0:n)\n\n    n = len_trim(s)\n    allocate(cum(n))\n\nWait no, indices 0 to n, which is n+1 elements. So:\n\nallocate(cum(0:n))\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, initialize cum(0) = 0, cum(n)=0.\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to n-1 (since in java the loop was from 1 to s.length() -1). Wait no, the loop in Java was:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < s.length(); i++) {\n\ns.length() in Java is N (n here in the code) . So the comparison is i < N \u2192 i goes up to N-1 (max i value is N-1).\n\nSo in fortran, loop from 1 to n-1.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nif s(i) == s(i-1) then cum(i) = cum(i-1)+1 else cum(i)=cum(i-1)\n\nWait wait, wait in Fortran, the characters are s(1) to s(n), since the string is 1-based. Initially, when I read the string s via read('*'), the first character is s(1), etc.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when using the string s, the characters are accessed via s(1:s_len).\n\nWait in the Fortran code example:\n\nSuppose s is stored as a 1-based array of characters. So, the first character is at s(1), second s(2), ..., up to s(n), where n = len_trim(s).\n\nSo in the loop for i from 1 to n-1 (since s's last character is s(n)):\n\nCheck s(i) and s(i+1)? Or s(i) vs s(i-1)? \n\nWait the code in Java checks s(i) and s(i-1).  \nWait, in Java's code, in the for loop, for each i from 1 to N-1 (indexes in the string s as 0-based?), yes. So s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(i-1) are the i-th and (i-1)th character. So the question is, in the Java code, the string is 0-based, so the i-th character in the string is s[i] (from 0 to N-1).\n\nBut in Fortran, the string s is stored as a character array starting at index 1. So s(1) is the first character. So to translate, for each i from 1 ton-1 (Fortran's i corresponds to the Java's i).\n\nIn Java, the character at position i is s.charAt(i). In Fortran, it would be s(i).\n\nWait NO. Let me think: Let's say the first character in the string in Java is at index 0. In the Java code:\n\nfor (int i =1 to ...):\n\nthe loop variable is i (from 1 to N-1). The previous character is at i-1, and current is i.\n\nIn Fortran's s is 1-based, so for s with length n, s(i) corresponds to the (i)th character.\n\nThus, in fortran:\n\nfor each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncheck s(i) and s(i-1)? No, because s is 1-based, the previous character is s(i-1). Wait:\n\nWait s is s is read as a string where the first char is s(1). So:\n\nFor i =1 in the loop (first iteration):\n\nJava's Previous character is i-1 (0) and Java's current is 1. However, in Fortran, the first pair (characters 1 and 0? Wait no, that's a problem. Wait in Fortran, trying to access s(0) would be an error.\n\nHold on, in Fortran, the string is 1-based. So the first element is s(1). Therefore the characters are s(1) to s(n). \n\nSo to get Java's i corresponds to Fortran's i+1? Or no, perhaps:\n\nWait let's re-examine.\n\nJava's code's cum array has length s.length() +1, with indices from 0 to n (n is s.length()).\n\nThe for loop runs i from 1 to n-1 (because i <n, so stop at n-1). \n\nIn each iteration i runs:\n\nCum[i] = ... based on s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(i-1)\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nThe corresponding index in the string s is:\n\nfor i in [1..n-1], characters are s(i) (Java's i) and s(i-1) (Java's i-1). Thus, in Fortran, yes, s(i) and s(i-1) are exactly that, provided that in Fortran the first character is s(1). So to access s(0) would be out of bounds. Which would be a problem for i=1's previous character (s(0))? \n\nWait hold on:\n\nWait for i=1 in Java:\n\ni runs from 1 up, so i-1 becomes 0. So in that case, s's previous character is at index 0 (Java's original position).\n\nSo in Fortran, when i=1 (corresponds to Java's i=1), that would access s(1) and s(0), but s(0) is invalid.\n\nSo there is an error here in the translation. That means that my assumption of the fortran string being 1-based is incorrect (or perhaps I should read it 0-based? )\n\nHmm, perhaps in Fortran I can arrange the string to be 0-based. Let me see:\n\nTo get the characters starting at 0. \n\nTo do that, when reading the string, maybe using an explicit array starting at 0?\n\nAlternatively:\n\nLet's read the string into an array starting at 0. So for example, declare a character array with the first index 0.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=1) s(0:99999)\n\nThen when reading the string, read the characters from the first character (offset 0) to the appropriate length.\n\nWait perhaps this is more convienient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nFirst, store the string as a character array starting at index 1, then for each i in 1 to n-1, the previous character is s(i-1), which is 1-based okay. \n\nWait but in the loop, when i is 1, s(0) is not present.\n\nAh yes! here's the problem. In the original code's Java loop, when i is 1, the previous index is 0.\n\nBut in Fortran, the first character is at 1. So this corresponds to the Java's 0 index.\n\nThus, in Fortran, all indices are shifted by 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the index in the fortran loop for the string is i (1 to n), but then for the problem, let me make a mapping.\n\nLet me try to adjust variables so that the characters in Fortran can be accessed correctly.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nLet me define the string character array to be 1-based (s(1) is first character, s(2) the second, etc.), and the cum array will be 0-based in fortran? Or perhaps, just adjust the indices.\n\nWait let me think of cum as an array from 0 to n (Java's original indices). Since java 'cum' has indices from 0 to n, where n is the length (s.length() \u2192 let's call it n here).\n\nThus, in Fortran, the cum array will be declared from 0 to n.\n\nThe initializations are:\n\ncum(0) =0\n\ncum(n) =0\n\nThe loop in Fortran is from i=1 to n-1 (Java's original loop variables up to n-1 steps).\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (s(i) .eq. s(i-1)) then\n\nbecause for Java's i: \n\nJava's s.charAt(i) \u2192 s(i) in 1-based.\n\nWait, the code:\n\nJava's line:\n\ns.charAt(i) (Java's i runs from 1 to n-1, since n is s.length() \u2192 the characters are from 0 to n-1 in Java's string).\n\nWait in Java's string:\n\nthe indices 0..n-1 are the characters.\n\nThus the i in the loop is from 1 to n-1 (since i <n). Then, for those i, the code checks if s[i] == s[i-1].\n\nIn Fortran's 1-based array:\n\nThe characters are stored as s(1) to s(n):\n\nSo for a particular Java's i: Java's character at i \u2192 corresponds to Fortran's s(i+1)? No, no.\n\nWait let me make a table.\n\nJava index (0-based): 0 1 2 ... (n-1)\n\nJava's characters: s[0] s[1] s[2] ... s[n-1]\n\nFortran's s array (1-based):\n\ns(1) \u2194 s[0]\n\ns(2) \u2194 s[1]\n\netc.\n\nThus Fortran's element s(i+1) corresponds to Java's s[i].\n\nTherefore, in the loop fortran has an iteration variable i (which runs from 1 to n-1)\n\nWait in fortran loop:\n\ni runs from 1 to n-1 (since Java's i was 1 to n-1, but n =Java's s.length})\n\nWait no: wait Java's loop is for i from 1 to (s.length() -1), i is up to (n-1 -1)? Wait, no:\n\nWait if n is s.length(), then in Java the loop is runs while i <n (n is n = s.length())\n\nThus, i goes from 1 to n-1 (since starting at 1, and stops when i is no longer less than n \u2192 when i is n, so last iteration is i = n-1.\n\nThus in fortran, the loop is:\n\ninteger i\n\ndo i = 1, n-1\n\n   ...\n\nend do\n\n Now, for each i in 1 ton-1:\n\nIn Java: compare s(i) and s(i-1) and compare them.\n\nBut in Fortran, the characters are s(1) \u2194 Java's s[0], s(2) \u2194 Java's s[1], ..., s(n) \u2194 Java's s[n-1].\n\nTherefore, in fortran's current 'i' corresponds to Java's 'i'.\n\nSo:\n\nJava's s[i] \u2192 Fortran's s(i+1) ?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait, for Java's i =1 (the first iteration):\n\nJava's character (i=1) is Java's s[1], which is Fortran's s(2). \n\nThe previous character (i-1 =0) is s[0], which is Fortran's s(1).\n\nSo in fortran's i's loop variable:\n\nwhen fortran's i is 1, the current character in the pair is s( i +1 - (as no) instead, wait:\n\nWait, no, to check the current Java's (i) vs previous (i-1):\n\nJava's i is the current index (0-based).\n\nIn fortran terms, for current position Java's i:\n\ncharacter is s(JS) where JS =i \u2192 Fortran's s(JS+1).\n\nBut the current Java's i and i-1 correspond to Fortran's (i+1) and (i).\n\nThus Fortran's code:\n\nif (s( i +1 ) .eq. s(i) ) ?\n\nWait no: let me think again:\n\nJava: s[i] and s[i-1]\n\nWhich in Fortran terms are (i) being Java's index:\n\ni =1 (Java):\n\ns[i] \u2192 Fortran's s(2) (since i is 1 \u2192 Java's 0-based: 0,1,2 ... \u2192 Fortran is 1,2,3 ... for s(1), etc.\n\nWait wait:\n\nJava's s[0] is fortran's s(1).\n\nJava's s[1] is fortran's s(2).\n\nJava's s[2] \u2192 Fortran s(3).\n\nSo, for a given Java index js:\n\n Fortran_s = js +1.\n\nSo,\n\nin Java's code, in the loop for i (Java's variable):\n\ncurrent character is s[i], which is Fortran's s(i+1).\n\nPrevious character is s[i-1], which is fortran's s(i).\n\nThus, the comparison in fortran is s(i+1) == s(i).\n\nAh! Got it.\n\nWait, in Fortran: the comparison is between s(i+1) and s(i).\n\nWait because the current i in fortran corresponds to Java's i variable in the loop, so that the pair is between the current and previous character in the FORTRAN's indices.\n\nWait, in the first iteration (i=1 in fortran loop), that's the first loop iteration corresponds to Java's i=1, where they compare index 1 vs 0. Which in fortran is s(2) and s(1). Thus the condition is whether s( i+1 ) is equal to s(i).\n\nTherefore the condition is:\n\nif ( s(i+1) == s(i) )\n\nWait but that's reversed?\n\nWait in code's Fortran:\n\nIf we are comparing s[i+1] (current) and s[i] (previous) \u2192 the condition for Java's s[i] == s[i-1] \u2192 requires that in Fortran's viewpoint, s[i] and s[i+1] (i.e. For i's position in Fortran):\n\nWait this is getting confusing. Wait sorry, trying again.\n\nJava i is running from 1 to N-1, which is s.length() -1 \u2192 because s.length is N (length). \n\nIn Java, for each iteration: check s[i] (current character) versus s[i-1] (previous).\n\nIn fortran's representation, this is s (i+1) vs s(i), because of Fortran's indexes being offset by 1.\n\nSo, the condition in FORTRAN is:\n\nif ( s(i) == s(i-1) ) ... ?\n\nWait no. Wait:\n\nWait Java i loops from 1 ton-1 (because <N), and in each step,\n\nJava's 'i' and 'i-1' \u2192 For example when i is 1: \n\nJava's current: i=1's char is s[1], and previous is s[0].\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ns[0] \u2192 s(1).\n\ns[1] \u2192 s(2).\n\nSo these would be s(1) and s(2) in Fortran. Thus comparing s[1] (Java's) and s[0], since the Java's indices are 1 and 0 \u2192 the fortran s indices are 2 and 1, so the equivalent is s[1+1] and s[1].\n\nWait the condition is:\n\nif ( s(2) == s(1), in first iteration \u2192 then we are increasing the cumulative. So for fortran, the code should be:\n\nin fortran loop (i from 1 to n-1):\n\nif ( s(i+1) == s(i) ) then \n\nthen cum(i) = ...\n\nWait no wait, because in the FORTRAN array, the next character after i (java's i+1) is s(i+1)? Because, for Java's i being 1 \u2192 s[1] \u2192 corresponds to fortran's s(2). What is that character's next?\n\nWait perhaps I'm making a mistake, the problem is that in JAVA\u2019s code, for each i in loop, it\u2019s checking current (i) vs previous (i-1), which in FORTRAN terms is:\n\nfor FORTRAN variables i from 1 ton-1 (since N is JAVA's N):\n\nFORTRAN\u2019s s(i) and s(i-1): Wait, no, for fortran's variable i:\n\nJava's current index (i) is fortran's i+1?\n\nWait maybe it's less error-prone to instead:\n\nforget the indexes and calculate how the loops and conditions work.\n\nAlternatively, let's define in FORTRAN code:\n\nthe character array S has length N, and is 1-based. S(1) is first character, S(N) last.\n\nthe code must compare the i-th and (i+1)th characters (in terms of loops). Or perhaps loops from i=2 to ... etc.\n\nWait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should write the algorithm in words.\n\nWe need to compute a cumulative array where cum[i] is the value from cum[i-1], plus one if the ith and (i-1)th characters in the original string are same. Wait no that's the opposite. Wait in the cumulative array:\n\ncum[i] = cum[i-1] +1 if current and previous character (i and i-1) are the same.\n\nThus in the loop over each character from position 2 to end (if 1-based).\n\nFor example, if FORTRAN's string is 1-based, then the cumulative array is initialized as:\n\ncum(0)=0\n\nFor each step from 1 ton:\n\nWait the way the code's loop is written is for i starting at 1 and up to N-1 (Java's).\n\nWait perhaps forget correspondence and directly model what needs to be done.\n\nThe cumulative array is supposed to compute the number of consecutive duplicates up to position i (where i is in 1-based?).\n\nWait let's think in terms of 1-based FORTRAN arrays:\n\nInitialize cum(0) to zero.\n\nThe FORTRAN array S is length n (1 to n).\n\nWe'll compute cum up to index n (to match Java's N -> FORTRAN's n).\n\nWait to keep it consistent with JAVA's cum[n], which was set to 0.\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nallocate an array cum(0:n) \u2192 indices 0,1,\u2026,n.\n\nCum(0)=0\n\ncum(n)=0.\n\nThen we loop over i from 1 to n-1:\n\nfor the position i (1-based?), check S(i) and S(i+1) \u2192 no. Wait, no:\n\nBecause for the position I, the characters are S(i) and S(i-1). Wait this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of the initial FORTRAN 'cum' array being 1-based:\n\nWait in FORTRAN, the cum array should be from 0 to n (0-based). \n\nWait perhaps it's better to implement the FORTRAN code with cum(0 : n), with n being the length of the string.\n\nThe loop:\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1.\n\nThen the condition is:\n\nif (S(i) == S(i+1)), then that means between positions i and i+1, so the cumulative array's cum[i] would increase?\n\nWait I think I need a different approach. Let's try to re-express the algorithm steps clearly.\n\nThe problem:\n\nThe cumulative array cum is supposed to store the number of consecutive duplicates ending at each position, summed up from the start. \n\nWait no, more precisely: cum[i] in JAVA is the number of pairs within the first i characters where s[j] == s[j-1]. So for each occurrence of a pair of adjacent same characters, each counts.\n\nWait the code's logic is, for each position i (starting from 1):\n\nif current character (s[i]) is equal to the previous (s[i-1]), then the current position contributes +1 to the cumulative count, and the cumulative up to this point is previous +1. Otherwise the cumulative is the same as previous.\n\nThus, the sources of the +1 are whenever current and previous match.\n\nThe total number up to position i is the number of such pairs before or including that point.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIn the string \"aaab\", the cum array would be:\n\nindices 0,1,2,3,4 (since length is4).\n\nCum[0] =0.\n\ni=1 \u2192 chars 0 and 1 (both a \u2192 yes \u2192 cum[1]=1.\n\ni=2 \u2192 chars1 and2 (both a \u2192 yes \u2192 cum[2] = 2.\n\ni=3 \u2192 chars 2 and3 (a versus b \u2192 no \u2192 cum[3] remains 2.\n\nSo the cum array is:\n\n0 1 2 2 0.\n\nThen, for a query l=1 to r=4 (in the problem's terms), if the query is from l to r in 1-based indices, but the code's variables are treated such that when parsed:\n\nr is parsed from the second token in the query, then subtracted 1 \u2192 so it is the end position in JAVA's terms (0-based up to r-1 (original input l is included? )).\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps in the FORTRAN code, as long as the indexing in cum is consistent with how the problem is parsed.\n\nPerhaps the main thing is:\n\nThe code needs to compute a cum array where for each position from 1 to N-1 (N being the length), the value is the number of consecutive pairs along the way.\n\nThus:\n\nFORTRAN's cum array is from 0 to N (indices for cum(0) to cum(n)) .\n\nWe can initialize cum(0) =0 etc.\n\nLoop from i=1 to n-1 (since in FORTRAN the string is 1-based):\n\nThe condition is: if (s(i) == s(i+1)), THEN cum(i) = cum(i-1)+1.\n\nElse, cum(i)=cum(i-1).\n\nWait no, wait that would be the case if we're comparing between i and next position.\n\nWait if the characters at position i and i+1 are the same: then they form a pair. So this contributes an increment to the cumulative count at position i.\n\nWait in that case, cum(i) = cum(i-1)+1 ?\n\nWait let me see. \n\nSuppose the current pair (i, i+1) is same \u2192 the cumulative up to i+1 would be previous plus 1. \n\nWait but perhaps the cumulative array is tracking the number of pairs up to position i (the right end of the pair). Let's think of the string as first:\n\nIndices (1-based) 1, 2, 3, ..., N.\n\nThe pairs are between 1&2, 2&3,..., N-1 & N.\n\nEach pair that is same contributes to the cumulative count.\n\nThus for the cumulative array up to position i (the end of the pair being i+1?), perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s think: the FORTRAN\u2019s cum array is 0-based up to n. \n\nWait in JAVA, the code's cum[i] (where n is JAVA's length) holds the cumulative number of pairs in the first i positions (JAVA's 0-based indices up to i-1?)\n\nAlternatively, the FORTRAN code's cum array: to match JAVA's, the index i in the loop runs 1 ton-1 in FORTRAN (if N is the length), and the condition being if s[i] equals s[i+1], then the count at i increases by +1, as they form a pair.\n\nWait perhaps the FORTRAN loop should be:\n\n    cum(0) =0 \n\n    do i=1,N-1\n\n        if (s(i) == s(i+1)) then\n\n            cum(i) = cum(i-1) +1\n\n        else \n\n            cum(i)= cum(i-1)\n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\ncum(N) = cum(N-1)  ? \n\nWait but the original code in JAVA sets cum[n] (the final) to zero. \n\nWait in JAVA:\n\ncum is initialized with cum[0] = cum[s.length()] =0;\n\nthe loop runs up to i < s.length (i up to N-1 where N =s.length).\n\nThus the cum array after the loop has values filled up to i = N-1 (JAVA's index). The cum array's last element (JAVA's cum[N]) remains 0?\n\nYes. So in JAVA\u2019s cum array, the array's last element (JAVA's cum[N]) is zero. The cum array's end after loop is:\n\ncum[0] =0\n\ncum[1] = ... \n\nuntil cum[N-1]. Then cum[N] =0.\n\nThus, in FORTRAN's code, after the loop, cum(N) should be set to 0.\n\nSo in FORTRAN, after computing the loop:\n\n cum(0) =0\n\n do loop.\n\nthen cum(N) =0\n\nWait but that might overwrite the value computed to the N-1 index.\n\nWait, no: The loop is up to i = N-1 (which in fortran's N is equivalent to JAVA's s.length). \n\nWait let me get this straight:\n\nLet N = length of string (JAVA's s.length() \u2192 in FORTRAN, this is 'n', set by len_trim(s)).\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\n   cum(0) =0\n\n   cum(n) =0 \n\n   do i = 1, N-1 :\n\n    if (s(i) == s(i+1)) then \n\n        cum(i) = cum(i-1)+1 \n\n    else \n\n        cum(i)=cum(i-1)\n\n    end if \n\nloop ends \n\n this way, the cum array is built correctly. \n\nBecause even though after this, cum(N-1) may be same as cum(N-2) + addition, etc.\n\nSo in this case, the code is correct.\n\nThus this loop is correct.\n\nNow the queries:\n\n for each query line:\n\n read l and r.\n\nThe code in JAVA parses the l and r, then subtracts 1 from r (so r is now r-1 from the user's input).\n\nThen produces the answer as cum[r] - cum[l-1].\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\n the variables are:\n\n the input l and r.\n\n For each query:\n\n read l and r \u2192 but note in JAVA, the query's r is parsed and then subtracted 1, to get FORTRAN's r. Or in FORTRAN's terms?\n\n Wait let's see:\n\n The JAVA code has:\n\n  Integer l = parse(st.nextToken()), r = parse(st.nextToken()) -1;\n\n So the R in JAVA is user's input minus 1.\n\nSo the user inputs '5' \u2192 becomes 4 in R.\n\n The formula is:\n\n the output is cum[R] - cum[L-1]\n\nwhere the query's L and R in JAVA are 1-based for the string? Since JAVA's indices are 0-based for the string.\n\n Wait the user\u2019s input is for l and r as 1-based indices for the string?\n\nYes, because the problem statement requires range from [L to R], and since in JAVA the array uses 0-based, the user inputs 1-based so that when converted to JAVA's 0-based, they use:\n\nuser\u2019s R becomes R-1 in code (JAVA's index). \n\nSimilarly, L is user's L (so JAVA's L-1? Or JAVA's L-1 is the index.)\n\nSo in FORTRAN:\n\nafter reading the query line's two numbers l and r, \n\n compute the answer as cum(r-1) - cum(l-1)\n\nWait:\n\nJAVA's code:\n\n   l and r are the input values.\n\n   then the answer uses cum[r-1] - cum[ l-1 -1 ]?\n\n or wait,:\n\nJAVA's variables:\n\nl is user\u2019s first number \u2192 that\u2019s the start of the interval (problem's 1-based), which translates to the start index l in JAVA (0-based is l-1).\n\nr is user's second number \u2192 which is then stored in r as (r_user-1), so in JAVA it's the end index (JAVA's 0-based) as r_user-1.\n\nThen answer is cum[r] - cum[l-1]\n\nWait:\n\nbecause cum[r] is the cumulative up to position r in JAVA (0-based), and cum[l-1] is the cumulative before the starting position (so the difference gives the number of pairs between l and r in JAVA's indices).\n\nBut the problem requires the number of pairs between l and r in 1-based, so that when user queries 1 to length, it's the full array.\n\nSo in FORTRAN, the variables:\n\nthe user's query has l and r (1-based for the problem's input).\n\nThus, in FORTRAN code:\n\nread l and r (from each query line), then compute the answer as cum(r-1) - cum(l-1).\n\nWait because cum in FORTRAN is 0-based (so if the JAVA's R is r_user-1, the FORTRAN's R is also r_user-1? Or because FORTRAN's indices for cum are 0 to N (where N is length).\n\nSuppose as in JAVA's calculation: the output is 'cum [r] - cum [l-1].\n\nIn FORTRAN's indices:\n\nJAVA's r (of the variable) is (user r -1).\n\nSo if user\u2019s input is 1 (JAVA r_user is 1) \u2192 JAVA's R would be 0. \n\n Then:\n\nJAVA's cum[R] \u2192 FORTRAN's cum (0) \u2192 because the FORTRAN cum's index is same as JAVA's cum[R].\n\nThus in FORTRAN code:\n\nanswer is cum( r_user -1 ) - cum( l_user -1 )\n\nBecause the l variable in query is l_user's original value needed to get JAVA's l-1 (JAVA's cum index l_user -1).\n\nThus code:\n\n for each query:\n\n read (l, r)\n\n answer = cum(r-1) - cum(l-1)\n\nThus in FORTRAN, for each query line:\n\n read(*,*) L, R \n\n write(*,*) cum(R-1) - cum(L-1)\n\nThus all variables are 1-based user inputs, and the indices into the cum array are converted correctly.\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nFull program:\n\nBegin by reading the first line.\n\nWait but in FORTRAN, the first read may have issues with trailing spaces etc., but assuming that the first line is just the string, then len_trim(s) gets its length.\n\nThus code steps:\n\nRead string:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\ufffd\n\nIt isn't valid in FORTRAN yet. Let me write the full code outline:\n\nHere\u2019s the full code:\n\nprogram codeforces_313_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: q, n, L, R, i\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: cum\n\n    ! Read the string s\n    read(*, '(a)', end=10) s    \n10  n = len_trim(s)\n    ! n is the length of s (number of characters)\n\n    ! Determine extent for cum array (indices 0 to n)\n    allocate(cum(0:n))\n    cum(0) = 0\n    cum(n) = 0\n\n    ! Compute the cumulative array\n    do i = 1, n -1\n        if (s(i:i) == s(i+1:i+1)) then\n            cum(i) = cum(i-1) + 1\n        else\n            cum(i) = cum(i-1)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now process the queries\n    read(*,*) q\n\n    do i = 1, q\n        read(*,*) L, R\n        write(*,*) cum(R -1) - cum(L -1)\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(cum)\n    stop\nend program codeforces_313_B\n\nWait, and let me check some parts.\n\nIn the first read statement, I had:\n\n10 n= len_trim(s). But the first read might have an end=10 clause to avoid triplet \u30a2 other errors? Or use list-directed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just read the first line with list-directed read.\n\nWait read(*,*) s \u2014 but that might fail since * reads up to newlin, but the default for a character variable reads until the first blank space. So this is a problem.\n\nOh right! FORTRAN's list-directed reads for a character variable would stop at any white-space. So if the first line has multiple words, e.g. like \"abcd\" is fine, but any space would break it.\n\nBut the problem's first line is just the string s, without spaces. So we can use a different read.\n\nAssuming that the first line is read correctly as the first line, maybe better to read until the line terminator. So using the '(a) format.\n\nSo:\n\nread*, format with a to read any length:\n\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n\nBut Fortran can have varying requirements. Alternatively use advance='no' etc, but perhaps the simplest is:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\n\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nThen the s array has the characters correctly from s(1) to s(n).\n\nThen in loops:\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo i=1 to n-1.\n\nTesting s(i) versus s(i+1).\n\nThe code for that is:\n\nif (s(i:i) == s(i+1:i+1)) \u2192 this is checking the i'th character. But in fortran's default, s is a character string, so s(i) is s(i:i) (a length 1 substring).\n\nThus the comparison is correct.\n\nThe cumulative array is built.\n\nThen reading q:\n\n read(*,*) q\n\nThen q queries:\n\n for each:\n\n   read(*,*) L, R \u2192 assuming lists are correct.\n\n then compute the result.\n\nWait, what about the Fortran integers? They \n\nYes, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting edge case:\n\nTest with s being length 0? Probably not needed as per problem constraints.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTest case when s is \"aaa\".\n\nN=3.\n\nthe cum array (indices 0 to 3):\n\ncum[0] =0.\n\ni=1: check s(1) vs s(2). both a \u2192 yes \u2192 cum[1] = 1.\n\ni=2: s(2) vs s(3): a and a \u2192 yes \u2192 cum[2]=2.\n\ncum[3]=0 per initialization.\n\nqueries:\n\nquery from L=1 to R =3 (0-based ends at 2 \u2192 in code's after subtraction, cum(3-1)= cum(2) is 2, minus cum(1-1) (cum(0=0.\n\nOutput 2), which is correct as three 'a's have two pairs: between 1-2,2-3 \u2192 two pairs \u2192 2.\n\nAnother test: s= \"a\", length 1:\n\nn=1.\n\nThen the loop (n-1)=0 \u2192 so the loop doesn't execute.\n\ncum(n)=0 \u2192 \n\nqueries for 1<= l=1, R=1 \u2192 (r-1=0) \u2192 cum(0) - cum(L-1=cum(0) \u2192 0-0=0 \u2192 correct (no pairs).\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nI think this should work."
