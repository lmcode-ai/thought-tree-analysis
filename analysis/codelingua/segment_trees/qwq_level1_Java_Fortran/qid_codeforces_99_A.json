So the first condition (if before dot -1 is 9) overrides and you print GOTO. Therefore in the else part, the code is not dealing with situations where the previous digit is 9, so in that else clause, when adding 1 to the integer part, the max possible is something like 999...8 +1 would become 999...9 which is okay as a string, but as long as the program can handle it with integer, then perhaps no problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads a string from the input, which is a number with a decimal point. It finds the position of the dot. Then it checks the digit before the dot and the one after. \n\nIf the digit before the dot is '9', it prints \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" \n\nElse, if the digit after the dot is greater than 4, it takes the part before the dot, converts it to an integer, adds 1, and prints that. \n\nOtherwise, it just prints the part before the dot without any change.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's see step by step.\n\nFirst, in Java, they read the input with a Scanner. In Fortran, I can use a read statement. Since it's reading a line, maybe read(*,*) but that might read until the first whitespace. Hmm, better to read the entire line as a string. Fortran's read(*,'(A)') line would get the whole line as a string.\n\nThen, finding the index of the '.' in the string. So I need to loop through each character. In Fortran, strings can be indexed with line(i:i). Wait, Fortran strings are arrays, so in Fortran 90, a character variable is an array. So if the input is a string, let's say line of length len_trim(line). I can loop from 1 to len_trim(line) checking each character. Once found, store the index.\n\nWait the Java code uses a for loop from 0 to length -1. But in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so the indices start from 1. I'll adjust accordingly.\n\nThen, check the character before the dot (dotIndex -1). The Java code does str[dotIndex -1], which would be zero-based. So in Fortran, if the dot is at position i (starting from 1), then the previous character is i-1 (since it's 1-based), so that should be okay.\n\nNext, the first condition is: if the character before '.' is '9', then print the first message. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond condition: the character after '.' (dotIndex +1) converted to integer. But in Java, the code takes str[dotIndex+1], which is a char, then converts it to a String by using \"\" + that char (so it becomes a String) and then parsed as integer. So in Fortran, need to convert that character to an integer. The code checks if that digit is greater than 4.\n\nIf yes, then take the part before the dot (from 1 to dotIndex -1), convert that part to a number, add 1, then print.\n\nElse, just print the part before the dot.\n\nWait, in Java, for the else, they loop through the characters before the dot and print them, then a newline. So in Fortran, just output that substring.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nFirst, read the input line into a character variable.\n\nLoop through each character to find the '.'.\n\nOnce found, check the previous character. \n\nDepending on the conditions, proceed accordingly.\n\nFor the part where adding 1 to the integer part:\n\nThe integer part is the substring before the dot. In Fortran, extracting substrings can be done using line(1:dotIndex-1).\n\nConvert that substring to an integer, add 1, then convert back to a string for output.\n\nBut if the number before the dot is very long (like a big integer), we may need to handle large integers. In Java they used BigInteger, which handles arbitrarily large numbers. \n\nHmm, in Fortran, integers have sizes limited by the kind. But the problem description from Codeforces (since the original Java code's class name mentions codeforces_99_A) probably expects us to handle big integers. Fortran has SELECTED_INT_KIND to get appropriate kind parameters. But even then, if the number is too big to fit into any integer kind, then... Well, maybe the problem expects that the input doesn't have such cases, or perhaps in the problem's constraints the number can be stored as a string and just incremented digit by digit.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's input has numbers where adding 1 doesn't cause a bunch of carry overs, but maybe I have to handle that manually?\n\nAlternatively, in Java's code, using BigInteger avoids that because it can handle arbitrarily large numbers, but in Fortran, unless we use something like string manipulation with character processing, perhaps we have to represent the integer part as a string and process it as such.\n\nSo, perhaps in Fortran, instead of converting to an integer, which might overflow, process the string directly by incrementing each digit from the end?\n\nHmm, but that's more complicated. Let's see what the original code does.\n\nOriginal Java code does:\n\n_str = the substring before the dot, converts to BigInteger, adds 1, and outputs the string. So this approach is to handle arbitrary length.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nIf we can read the entire substring before the dot as an integer, then adding 1 is okay. But for a very large number, like '1234567890123456789045', which may exceed even the 8-byte integer limit (typically up to 1e18 for 64-bit), then we can't directly convert that into an integer.\n\nTherefore, the same approach might not work unless we have a way to handle big integers in Fortran. Since Fortran does not have an intrinsic big integer type, like Java does, perhaps the problem expects that the inputs are such that the integer part can be handled in 32 or 64 bits, so the code can proceed with standard integers.\n\nAlternatively, I might have to process the string manually, incrementing and carrying over digits. \n\nLooking back at the problem, the original problem might be Codeforces problem 99A, which is called \"Vasya and Numbers\".\n\nChecking the problem statement (assuming I can recall or think about it), but if the problem is to round a decimal number (like truncate after 666.0 or etc?), perhaps the integer part is not too big. Maybe the constraints ensure that the integer part is within the limits.\n\nIn that case, proceed with converting the string to an integer, add one, then print.\n\nBut in Fortran, when converting a string to an integer, for cases where it may be too large, it will cause an error. So perhaps the problem expects that the input is small enough, so the code can proceed with native integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended that the code can be written without handling big numbers because the problem's test case numbers are manageable.\n\nAssuming that, proceed.\n\nSo steps in Fortran code:\n\n1. Read the input line as a string.\n\n2. Find the position of the dot ( '.', ASCII 46?)\n\n3. Check characters before and after:\n\n   a. If the previous character to the dot is '9', output \"GOTO Vasilisa.\"\n\n   b. Else, check the first digit after the dot. If greater than 4, then add 1 to the part before the dot.\n\n   c. Else, print the part before the dot.\n\nNow, for reading the input, in Fortran:\n\nWe'll need to use a character array. Perhaps declare line as a sufficiently large array, e.g.:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: line\n\nbut preferably, since we can read until the end, use a variable length string. Wait in Fortran 90/95, for variable length strings can be handled with the 'allocatable' or pointers, but perhaps better to read the entire line as a string with a delimiters.\n\nAlternatively, the code can read the entire line with an input statement like:\n\nread(*, '(A)') line\n\nbut variable-length strings can be handled with character arrays. So let's proceed.\n\nFirst, reading the input:\n\nprogram codeforces_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=100) :: input_line\n    integer :: i, dot_pos\n    character :: before_last, after_first\n    character(len=100) :: integer_part\n    integer (kind=8) :: num ! Use 8-byte (64-bit) integer to prevent overflow for larger numbers.\n\n    read(*, '(A)') input_line\n\n    ! find the position of the dot\n    dot_pos = 0\n    do i = 1, len_trim(input_line)\n        if (input_line(i:i) == '.') then\n            dot_pos = i\n            exit\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Now check the characters before and after.\n\n    ! Check the character before the dot. Since in Fortran, index is 1-based:\n    if ( dot_pos ==0 ) then  ! No dot found? Probably shouldn't happen per problem constraints, but handle if needed\n        write(*,*) 'Unexpected input'\n        stop\n    end if\n\n    before_last = input_line(dot_pos-1:dot_pos-1)\n    if ( before_last == '9' ) then\n        print *, 'GOTO Vasilisa.'\n    else\n        ! check after dot:\n        after_first = input_line(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1)  ! assuming the next character exists (problem states input is valid)\n        integer_part = input_line(1:dot_pos-1)\n        ! Need to convert after_first to integer\n        ! Assume after_first is a digit (problem constraints)\n        read(after_first,*) after_value\n        if ( after_value >4 ) then\n            read(integer_part, '(I10)') num\n\n            num = num + 1\n\n            write(*, '(I0)') num\n        else\n            write(*, '(A)') integer_part\n        end if\n    end if\nend program codeforces_A\n\nWait but a problem here is, when converting the integer_part to a number. For very large numbers, even 8 byte integers can overflow. But perhaps in the problem's constraints, the integer part can be up to, say, 1e200, which is way beyond 8-byte limit.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct way is to process the string directly, like adding 1 to the digits, handling carryover.\n\nAlternatively, the original Java code uses BigInteger, so maybe the problem expects that the input numbers can be arbitrarily large, so we need to handle that in Fortran without converting to integer.\n\nHmm. So I need to process the digits of the integer_part string and increment it by 1 manually.\n\nLet me think: suppose integer_part is \"12349\", then adding 1 gives 12350. \"9999\": becomes 10000.\n\nTo handle this with string operations in Fortran.\n\nSo here's how to do that:\n\nTake the integer_part string, convert each character to a digit, then start from the end (rightmost), add 1, then handle carry over.\n\nBut Fortran strings can be manipulated in such a way. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, reverse the digits so that the least significant digit is first, then add 1 and handle the carry, then reverse again.\n\nAlternatively, process from the end of the string.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nLet's have integer_part as a character array, each element representing a digit (as a character from '0' to '9').\n\nProcessing:\n\n1. Convert the string to an array of characters or just index from the end.\n\n2. Start from the end (the last digit), add 1. If the digit becomes more than 9, set to 0 and carry over 1.\n\nContinue until there is no carry.\n\n3. If there's a carry left after the first digit, add a new digit at the beginning (e.g., 9999 becomes 10000).\n\nIn code:\n\nFor example, in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: s=\"12349\"\ncharacter(len=200) :: result\ninteger :: i, len_s, carry, current_num, carry\n\nBut this might be a bit involved.\n\nFirst step: create the integer_part string.\n\nThen construct the result:\n\ninteger_part is the string to increment.\n\nWe have to process it as a string.\n\nLet me try to code that.\n\nSuppose integer_part is stored in the variable s, and we want to add 1 to it.\n\nTo add 1:\n\nFirst, reverse the string to process from least significant digit.\n\nAlternatively, proceed step by step:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncarry =1\n\ns_reverse = reverse(s)\n\nresult is also initialized as s.\n\nthen, for each position in s_reverse (from 1 to len_s):\n\ndigit = ichar(s_reverse(i:i)) - ichar('0')\n\nnew_digit = digit + carry\n\nif (new_digit >9) then\n\n    carry =1\n\n    new_digit = new_digit -10\n\nelse\n\n    carry = 0\n\nend if\n\nresult_reverse(i:i) = achar(ichar('0') + new_digit)\n\nafter processing all digits, if there is a carry remaining:\n\nadd a new digit at the end.\n\nthen reverse back the result_reverse to get the final number as a string.\n\nHmm, maybe a bit complex, but necessary.\n\nAlternatively, let's write code for incrementing a string as a number:\n\nCreate a subroutine that takes a character string and returns the incremented one.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nSubroutine increment_num_str(s, out_s)\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\ncharacter(len=*), intent(out) :: out_s\n\ninteger :: len_s, i, carry, digit, new_len\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ncarry = 1\n\nout_s = s\n\ndo i = len_s, 1, -1\n\n    digit = ichar( out_s(i:i) ) - ichar('0')\n\n    digit = digit + carry\n\n    if (digit >=10) then\n\n        carry =1\n\n        digit = digit -10\n\n    else\n\n        carry =0\n\n    end if\n\n    out_s(i:i) = achar(ichar('0') + digit)\n\n    if (carry ==0 ) exit\n\nend do\n\n! After processing, check if carry is still 1\n\nif (carry ==1 ) then\n\n    ! Prepend '1'\n\n    new_len = len_s +1\n\n    out_s = '1' // out_s(1:new_len-1) ! Wait, but the out_s might need sufficient length.\n\n    ! But this could cause a problem of variable length. Maybe the length of out_s should be sufficient.\n\nEnd if\n\nend subroutine\n\nBut in Fortran, strings have fixed lengths, so perhaps the \"out_s\" must be long enough.\n\nThus, in the main code:\n\nassuming input integer_part is stored as a string, which will be part of processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way considering code size is to just use integers for small numbers and assume the problem constraints allow it.\n\nAssuming the problem's input has the integer part within the 64-bit range, proceed with that.\n\nBut let me think: the original problem may allow numbers with very long integer parts. For example, suppose the input is \"99999999999999999.5\", then adding 1 would require handling that as a string.\n\nBut without a big integer type, perhaps the problem on Codeforces had a constraint where the digit before the decimal is not 9, and the number after doesn't require large addition?\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the original Java code's logic: the code does check if the previous character to '.' is '9', in which case it outputs the GOTO statement. So the case when the integer part is 999...9. something isn't processed to add 1 because that scenario would have started with the '9' before the dot.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, in Java's code, first, if the character before the dot (i.e., the first decimal digit) is '9' (before the dot?), wait the code checks:\n\nif (str[dotIndex -1] == '9') {\n\nSo in the Java code, if the integer part is ending with 9, then it can't increment the integer part like 99.5 becomes 100 (which would need to add 1 to 99, resulting 100). However, in the else clause, the code will check the first decimal digit (the one after the '.'), and if it's over 4, then increments the integer part by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the case when the integer part ends with 9 is handled by the first condition.\n\nWait, let me see: for example, suppose input is '9.5'. \n\nThe character before the dot is '9', so the first condition is true, so it outputs \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" , meaning adding 1 would result in 10.0; but in their code, if the first part ends with 9, they choose not to just increment\u2014 but perhaps the problem's rules are such that when the tenth's digit is >=5, you should round, but if the units digit is 9, it can't be-rounded and instead output that message.\n\nSo the first condition (if before dot -1 is 9) overrides and you print GOTO.\n\nTherefore in the else part, the code is not dealing with situations where the previous digit is 9, so in that else clause, when adding 1 to the integer part, the max possible is something like 999...8 +1 would become 999...9 which is okay as a string, but as long as the program can handle it with integer, then perhaps no problem.\n\nAssuming the inputs are manageable, then the integer approach is okay.\n\nThus, in Fortran code, I can proceed with this.\n\nAdjusting the code accordingly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nIn Fortran, strings are fixed length, so when using GOTO, the printed message must have appropriate spacing. But Java's code only has \"GOTO Vasilisa.\", so Fortran should print that exactly.\n\nSecond, reading until the next character after the dot. The next character might be a leading zero? But since the problem says the fractional part is single digit (since the code checks str[dotIndex+1], which is first character after the dot), the input after the dot is only one character digit.\n\nSo in the Java code, the input's decimal is like 123.4 so the part after the dot is the single digit.\n\nHence in Fortran, after_dot = input_line(dot_pos+1:dot_pos+1)\n\nif (ichar(after_first) - ichar('0') >4 ), then proceed.\n\nWait, converting to integer:\n\nin the else clause:\n\nafter_val = char to number: can do:\n\nread( after_first, '(I1)') ivalue.\n\nso in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: after_val\n\nread( after_first, * ) after_val\n\nif (after_val >4) then...\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe code steps are clear now.\n\nTesting possible inputs.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 12.5\n\ndot is at position 3 (in characters 1-based). dot_pos=3.\n\nbefore_digit is '2', which is not 9.\n\nthe after_val is 5>4: so add 1 to 12: 13 \u2192 output 13.\n\nthe code after:\n\ninteger_part is first 2 chars \"12\", converted to 12, add 1\u219213. output 13.\n\nTest case 2: 123.4 \u2192 after_val is 4 \u2192 not greater, so output 123.\n\nTest case3: 9.9 \u2192 before_dot is 9 \u2192 output GOTO.\n\nTest case4: 249.5 \u2192 after_val 5 >4 \u2192 249+1=250 \u2192 output 250.\n\nSo code should work with these cases.\n\nNow code in Fortran:\n\nImplementing:\n\nprogram codeforcesA\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=100) :: input_line\n    integer :: dot_pos, i, after_value\n    character(len=100) :: integer_part\n    integer(kind=8) :: num\n    logical :: ok\n\n    !

So instead of using trim(adjustl), the correct way is:\n\nWhen printing num as an integer, simply use:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0)') num\n\nBut in the code above, 'print *' automatically converts it, so perhaps:\n\nIf num is of integer(kind=8), then do:\n\nprint *, num\n\nBut for numbers with leading zeros? Well, probably not needed, since the input didn't have leading zeros. For example, if input integer part is '012', adding 1 would give '13'? Well, the problem may consider such input as just '012, but when adding 1 it would become 13 ?\n\nThe problem says it's a number, so leading zeros would be part of the string, but converted to integer, leading zeros are ignored, so when adding 1, the leading 0's would disappear.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAlternative:\n\nInstead of using print *, which might have fancy formatting, use write(*,'(I0)'), but the same effect.\n\nTesting in the Fortran code:\n\nIn the part where after_value is greater than 4:\n\nAfter converting integer_part to num, adding 1, then output as:\n\nprint *, num\n\nWhich is okay.\n\nIn the else case (else clause after after_value check), using:\n\nprint *, input_line(1:dot_pos-1)\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you have a string like input_line(1:dot_pos-1), which is a substring, but if the original has leading spaces or trailing spaces? Probably not according to problem constraints, input is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the substring could have leading zeros? Not sure, but problem might treat it correctly.\n\nWait, the input is entered as a line, so the input_line's first character is the first of the number, so leading zeros are okay.\n\nFor example, input '000.5' would have the first part '000', then adding would be 1, output '1'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus the code should handle that.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Handling very large integer parts that exceed integer_8's range.\n\nThe problem says codeforces_99A; I think problem 99 on codeforces is called \"Vasya and Password\", but perhaps this is a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has constraints on the input, ensuring the integer part is within 64-bit range; so with the given problem's constraints, this code should work.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as written."
