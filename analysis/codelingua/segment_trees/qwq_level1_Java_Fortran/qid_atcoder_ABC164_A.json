    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at what the Java code does first. The code reads input lines until there's an exception, which probably means until end of input. Then it splits the first line into two integers, Sheep and Wolve. If Wolve is greater or equal to Sheep, it prints \"unsafe\", else \"safe\".\n\nHmm, in Fortran, reading from standard input is a bit different. Since Fortran typically reads from files, but I can use unit=5 which is standard input. But how do I read lines until end of file?\n\nThe Java code uses a loop that runs while i >=0, which is always true, but breaks on exception. In Fortran, I can just read until the end of file. So probably a loop that reads lines until EOF. But in the Java code, they are collecting all lines into an ArrayList. Then the first line is split into parts.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem only needs the first line? Let me check the Java code again. The code reads all lines into scList, then takes the first element (index 0), splits by space. So Sheep and Wolf come from the first line's two numbers. So, actually, maybe the rest of the lines are unused. Maybe in the problem, the input is just a single line with two integers? Because why read multiple lines otherwise, but in the code it's not using the other lines. Wait, maybe that code is from a problem where sometimes multiple lines are input but here only the first line matters? Probably, the problem requires reading two numbers from the first line. So in Fortran, I just need to read the first line's two integers. So perhaps the loop in Java is overkill, but in Fortran, I can just read the two numbers directly.\n\nWait, but in Java, they are using a Scanner and nextLine each time. If the input is a single line, then the code would have scList only contain one element. Then the rest of the code works. So in Fortran, perhaps we just need to read two integers from the first line. So maybe in Fortran, read the first line, split into two integers.\n\nIn Fortran, to read from the first line, maybe just read two integers:\n\nread*, sheep, wolverine (but check variable names, since in Java it's Wolve, perhaps variable name in Fortran is wolf? but variable names in fortran can't have uppercase probably, so lower case.)\n\nWait, in the Java code, the variables are called Sheep and Wolve. But in Fortran, variable names are usually uppercase, but in newer versions, case-insensitive. Wait, actually, in Fortran, variable names are case-insensitive, and by default, the case isn't preserved. But to be safe, just use lowercase.\n\nSo variables could be sheep and wolf.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read two integers from the input. Since the input is one line, probably split by space.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc164_a\n    implicit none\n    integer :: sheep, wolf\n\n    read*, sheep, wolf\n    if (wolf >= sheep) then\n        print*, \"unsafe\"\n    else\n        print*, \"safe\"\n    end if\nend program\n\nWait, that's much simpler. But what if the input has more lines? Since the original Java code reads all lines but only uses the first. But the problem may have only one line of input, so in Fortran this would work. But maybe the problem expects more lines, but in the Java code, only first is considered. So probably, the problem's input is just two integers on one line. So this code should work.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the problem's case where the input has more than one line, the Java code indeed reads all lines but only uses the first line. But in Fortran, reading with read*, will just read the first two numbers from the first line. If there are more numbers, the remaining would be a problem? Well, perhaps the problem's input is exactly two integers on a single line, so the code should be okay.\n\nTherefore, the translated Fortran code is as above. But let me check if there's any possible mistake.\n\nThe Java code first splits the first line into parts using split(\" \"), so it's splitting on any whitespace. In Fortran, the read * will read free-format, which also ignores whitespace, so it's equivalent. So the code should work.\n\nAnother thing: in Java, the class name is atcoder_ABC164_A, which might be the program name in Fortran. So in Fortran the program is named 'atcoder_abc164_a'. The underscores and lowercase should be okay.\n\nSo the final code would be as I wrote. I think that's the correct translation."
