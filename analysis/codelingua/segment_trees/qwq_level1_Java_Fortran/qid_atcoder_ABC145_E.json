First, in the loops inside the main DP loops:\n\nThe code currently inside the i and time_after_eat loops has variables referenced inside time_after_eat loop, which involves:\n\ncurrent_row= indices(i)\na_time and a_value are set for each time_after_eat, but actually, those values only depend on i, not the time_after_eat. So this computation can move out of the nested loops. So, correction:\n\nThe initial step is for each i iteration:\n\ncurrent_row= indices(i)\na_time= ...\na_value= ... Then the loop over time_after_eat can use a_time and a_value. So the code would be better written as:\n\n  do i=1, N\n    current_row = indices(i)\n    a_time = AB(current_row,1)\n    a_value = AB(current_row,2) do time_after_eat =0, 6000\n        ... the dp steps inside here can use a_time and a_value outside the loop. This reduces computation since a_time and a_value are only calculated once per item i.\n\nNow in the code:\n\n do i=1, N\n    current_row = indices(i)\n    a_time = AB(current_row,1)\n    a_value = AB(current_row,2)\n    \n    do time_after_eat =0,6000\n        ! first set dp current to previous row (without taking item)\n        dp(i, time_after_eat) = max( dp(i, time_after_eat), dp(i-1, time_after_eat) )\n\n        if ( time_after_eat >= a_time ) then\n           if( (time_after_eat - a_time ) < T ) then\n               ! can take the item\n               possible_val = dp(i-1, time_after_eat - a_time) + a_value\n               dp(i, time_after_eat) = max( dp(i, time_after_eat), possible_val )\n           end if\n        end if\n\n    end do\n end do\n\nThis would be better in terms of code and efficiency.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the code does. From the Java code's structure, it looks like a dynamic programming solution for a problem, probably similar to the knapsack problem. The problem must involve selecting items (maybe \"points\" or \"items\") with certain time and value, such that the total time when selecting them stays under a certain threshold T or something. \n\nAlright, first step is to parse the input. The Java code reads N and T, then N pairs of integers AB, then sorts them based on the first element of each pair. Then there's a DP array, and loops setting up transitions for each item. Finally, it finds the maximum value in the last row of the DP array.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Fortran has different syntax and array handling compared to Java. Let me note key points to consider:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: Java uses Scanner; in Fortran, I need to read from the standard input using read statements. The size N can be read first, then T. Then we need an array for AB. Since arrays in Fortran are static, we need to predefine their dimensions. Wait, but since we read N at runtime, dynamic allocation might be needed. Oh right, in Fortran 90+ you can use allocatable arrays.\n\n2. **Sorting**: The Java code sorts the AB array based on the first element. In Fortran, sorting can be done with the `sort` intrinsic or a custom function. Since we can use the built-in sort, but the key is the first element of each pair. So we need to sort the rows of the AB array based on their first column. I think the best way is to create an index array and then sort that array based on the first element of AB. Alternatively, use the `mergesort` subroutine or similar.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The DP is a 2D array of N+1 rows and 6001 columns. Since N could be up to 10^5? Wait, the original code initializes N as input, but in Java the AB array is N elements. The DP is of size (N+1) x 6001, so if N is large, but given that they iterate up to N and 6001, maybe N is manageable here. Anyway, in Fortran, we need to declare this properly. However, 6001 columns with 5000 or 10000 N might get memory-heavy, but perhaps the problem constraints allow it.\n\n4. **Loops**: The loops in Java are translated directly, but in Fortran loops are a bit different. The main loops are over i (from 1 to N) and for each, iterating over timeAfterEat from 0 to 6000. The DP transitions are copying previous max.\n\n5. **Max Function**: The Math.max is straightforward, equivalent to assignment with maximum in Fortran.\n\nAlright, let's try to tackle each part step by step.\n\n**Reading Input:**\nFirst, in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. So:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC145_E\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, T\n  integer, allocatable :: AB(:,:), dp(:,:)\n  ... stuff here ...\n\n  ! Read N and T\n  read(*,*) N, T\n\n  ! Allocate AB array of size N x 2\n  allocate(AB(N, 2))\n  allocate(dp(N+1, 6001))  ! Wait, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, so this is okay?\n\nThen read the AB array:\n\n  do i = 1, N\n    read(*,*) AB(i,1), AB(i,2)\n  end do\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop uses `sc.nextInt()` twice in each iteration. Yes. So in Fortran, that's straightforward.\n\n**Sorting the AB array by first column:**\nTo sort the AB array, rows should be sorted based on their 1st column. The easiest way in Fortran is to create a permutation array. Let me think:\n\n! Create index array and sort by AB(k,1)\ninteger, allocatable :: indices(:)\nallocate(indices(N))\ndo i = 1, N\n  indices(i) = i\nend do\ncall sort(indices, key=AB(:,1)) ?\n\nWait, no. Fortran's sort can sort an array, but not directly by multiple keys. Hmm. Need a proper sorting function that takes a comparator like in Java.\n\nWait maybe better to use the 'sort' intrinsic where the key is the first element. Oh, perhaps using the `merge` function with a key array? Alternatively, use the `isort` function or other.\n\nActually, a common approach is to sort the indices. Let me write a small loop for the bubble sort? Well, for big N that could be slow, but given that in programming competitions, better use available subroutines. Alternatively, maybe the standard way in Fortran to sort an array with user-defined comparator is via a helper array.\n\nWait perhaps the best is to use the FORTRAN standard subroutine. Let's look.\n\nWait in Fortran intrinsic there is `SORT`, but it can sort an array, but when you need to sort rows of an array based on a column, perhaps the easiest way is to use the `MATH` ifort library has a sort function, but if I stick to standard Fortran, can I do it?\n\nAlternatively, here's the method: sort an array of indices such that the first elements are in order.\n\nI can create an array of integers from 1 to N and then sort them according to AB's first element. The permutation array.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: i\ninteger :: temp\n\nDo this with a bubble sort for simplicity? It might be better to use a stable algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, here's an implementation of the comparison in a sort using, say, a bubble sort.\n\nAlternatively, here's code example for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the `sort` function from the fortran 2003 standard which allows a user-defined comparison function.\n\nWait, but that's available in modern Fortran. Let me see.\n\nActually, the F2003 introduced the concept of pointers and more functions, but the `sort` intrinsic is not standard. Wait, in fortran, the `sort` intrinsic is part of the library (but iir is not standard in fortran until maybe 2008 or?)\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe using the Lapack functions? Probably not for this.\n\nWait, given the problem statement, it's more about the code structure, and not about the efficiency. Let me just code a quick sort for the indices.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the following steps.\n\nCreate an array of indices, then for each element, compare the first column of the given rows, and sort the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nFirst, create an array indices(1:N) = / (i, i=1,N) / \n\nThen, a bubble sort on indices array, but for each comparison between indices array element 'i' and 'j', compare AB(i,1) and AB(j,1).\n\nWait here is a bubble sort code for indices.\n\nallocate(indices(N))\ndo i = 1,N\n indices(i) = i\nend do\n\n logic, parameter :: ascending = .true.\n\n do i = 1, N-1\n   do j = i + 1, N\n     if (ascending) then\n       if (AB(indices(i),1) > AB(indices(j),1)) then\n         temp = indices(i)\n         indices(i) = indices(j)\n         indices(j) = temp\n       end if\n     end if\n   end do\n end do\n\nWait wait, but this is O(N^2) which is okay only for small N. But perhaps in the problem constraints of this question, N is up to say, 1e4 or 5e4, then bubble sort would be too slow but the code may still be acceptable? Not sure, but if the original code's bubble sort isn't an issue, perhaps the problem expects it.\n\nAlternatively, better to use a proper quicksort. However, coding that in Fortran would take more code.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the actual constraints of AB are manageable with N up to say 1e4, so bubble sort may not be suitable. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code uses the inbuilt sort which is O(N log N). Since translating to Fortran for the purpose of code translation, perhaps it's better to note that I'm using a sort, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can skip the sort. Wait, no, the Java code does sort the AB array, so the Fortran code must do the same.\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires the AB array to be sorted by a[0], so we have to sort. Let me look for a quick sort implementation in Fortran for the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that the original code uses:\n\nArrays.sort(AB, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));\n\nTherefore in Fortran, we need to sort the AB array in place, in the first column.\n\nAlternatively, if Fortran allows:\n\ncall merge_sort(AB, 1) \n\nbut unless the compiler has such a function, which is non-standard. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'heapq' module? No, probably not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to include a sort function. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic from the _fjmod1 module. Wait but that is compiler dependent (gfortran). \n\nAlternatively, use the following code for sorting the indices:\n\nWait maybe it's better to proceed, assuming that I will include a function to sort the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem's case, the order might not be essential, but according to the code, the sorting is required so we can't skip.\n\nHmm. Let's move on and tackle the rest first, but maybe come back.\n\nProceeding:\n\nAfter sorting AB based on the first column, the next part is setting up the DP array.\n\n**The DP loops:**\nJava code has:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) { ... }\n\nThe loops in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, N\n   do timeAfterEat = 0, 6000\n      ... \n   end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the outer i is from 1 to N, and for each i, iterate over timeAfterEat from 0 to 6000, right? \n\nThe DP is a 2D array here. The initialization:\n\nIn Fortran, when declaring DP as allocatable, need to allocate before use. The code would be:\n\nallocate(dp(0:N, 0:6000))    ! Because Java uses i from 1 to N, but the DP array is 1-based or 0?\n\nWait, looking back to Java code:\n\nint[][] dp = new int[N + 1][6001]; \n\nSo in Java, it is dp[i][time], where the first dimension is N+1 (indices 0..N) and the second is 6001 (indices 0..6000).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be declared with up to (N, 6000) with indices starting at 1. Wait, but in Fortran indices start at 1 by default. So, for DP array to have the first dimension as 1-based up to N+1 elements and the second dimension up to 6001 elements:\n\nallocate( dp(N+1,6001) )\n\nNo, because the array in Fortran is stored as 'rows' and 'columns'. So the first index is row, second is column. So the Java's [i][timeAfterEat], where i from 0 to N (0..N is N+1 entries), so in Fortran:\n\nThe first dimension can be arranged to:\n\nallocate( dp(0:N, 0:6000) ) \n\nWait, in fortran, an array declared as 'myarray(0:10,0:100)' has those ranges. So yes, but the array must be allocated with those bounds. To do so:\n\nallocate( dp(0:N, 0:6000) )\n\nBut when using allocatable arrays in Fortran, you can specify the bounds as N+1 (since N is known) but maybe best to define the allocations as per:\n\n allocate( dp( 0: N, 0: 6000 ) )\n\nYes that way. \n\nSo the initialization of the dp array?\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nThe dp array is initialized as a new array of 0s. Since Fortran's allocatable arrays are initialized to 0 when allocated? Wait no, in Fortran, you have to allocate and set them to 0. So after allocation:\n\n dp(:,:) = 0 \n\nThat would set all elements to zero. Alternatively, in code:\n\nallocate( dp(N+1,6001) ) \ndp = 0 \n\nWait but depends, if allocated with 0:N, then the first dimension is N+1 elements.\n\nWait, going back:\n\nWait the Java initializes dp as new int[N+1][6001], with all elements 0 initially. So in Fortran, after allocating the dp (either by the necessary indices), set it to zero.\n\nNow the loops:\n\nThe DP[i][timeAfterEat] = max( itself, dp[i-1][timeAfterEat] )\n\nSo in the loops:\n\n for each i from 1 to N:\n   for each timeAfterEat in 0..6000:\n\n       first, the code takes the max between dp[i-1][timeAfterEat] and existing dp[i][timeAfterEat].\n\nIn Fortran, since dp is updated for each step:\n\ndp(i, t_ae) = max( dp(i, t_ae), dp(i-1, t_ae) ) \n\nBut the first step here?\n\nInitially, dp is zero. \n\nThe original code's inner loop is:\n\n for (int timeAfterEat =0; ... 6000; ):\n\nIn Java, since array is 0-based, in Fortran, if our dp is 0-based, then that's okay.\n\nAssuming indices for DP are from 0 to N in first dimension and 0 to 6000 in the second.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nThe loop in Java is:\n\nfor the first loop over i from 1 to N.\n\nIn Fortran, same.\n\nNow the code in the loop:\n\nThe first line is setting the current dp[i][timeAfterEat] to be maximum between itself and the previous row (i-1), same time.\n\nThen, there is a condition check: timeAfterEat - time >=0, and less than T.\n\nWait the code has:\n\nif (0 <= timeAfterEat - time && timeAfterEat - time < T) {\n\nWait these can be rewritten as \"timeAfterEat - time >=0 and < T\".\n\nIn Java, \"time\" is AB[i-1][0], because AB is a java array, so 0-based.\n\nWait in Java code, AB is filled as for i (0-based?) the first element is AB[i][0], so in the loop, when Java does for (int i: 0 to N-1), the AB[i][0] etc. Then, in the loop for the DP, i starts at 1 to N (1-based in the DP), and accesses:\n\nAB[i-1][0] (so 0-based, so in fortran, since AB is 1-based, the element would be AB(i,1) since first column is time?\n\nWait, let me see the code again.\n\nWait in the Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { \n     AB[i][0] = sc.nextInt(); \n     AB[i][1] = sc.nextInt(); \n}\n\nSo the first element of each row is stored in the 0th index (since AB is 2D array in Java, 0-based), so in Java the i-loop runs from 0 to N-1, and in fortran the same loop will store from 1 to N, so in fortran code, the first element of row I is AB(i,1).\n\nWait no, sorry, in Fortran, the first dimension is the row number. For the code:\n\nin Fortran:\n\n      allocate(AB(N, 2))\n\nIn the loop:\n\n do i=1,N\n    read *, AB(i,1), AB(i,2)\n end do\n\nSo AB has rows 1-N, and each row has elements (1 and 2).\n\nTherefore, when in Java, the loop over AB in the DP section is AB[i-1][0] which corresponds to i starting at 1 in the FORTRAN's code. Wait:\n\nIn the java code:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <=N; i++) {\n\nthe AB refers to AB[i-1][0]). \n\nWhich in Fortran, if the rows are 1-based, that would be AB(i,1).\n\nSo in the code for the DP loop:\n\n   time is AB(i,1), value is AB(i,2). Because in Java's i-1 becomes i in Fortran's AB array.\n\nWait, for example, when in java i is 1 (the first item in the first iteration), i-1 is 0, so AB[0][0] and [0][1], while in Fortran, the first row is i=1.\n\nTherefore, in FORTRAN, when the loop variable in the DP is i from 1 to N, the corresponding row is AB(i, 1).\n\nSo the variables:\n\ntime = AB(i,1)\n\nvalue = AB(i,2)\n\nNow the condition:\n\nif ( 0 <= (timeAfterEat - time) && (timeAfterEat - time ) < T )\n\nIn FORTRAN, the timeAfterEat is the loop variable, which loops from 0 to 6000 (since Fortran's second array is from 0 to 6000). The variables are:\n\ntime_after_eat is 'time_after_eat'\n\nWait variable names:\n\ntimeAfterEat in java is a variable name. In fortran, variables cannot have underscores? No, Fortran allows underscores, but different variable naming rules.\n\nActually, in Fortran, variable names can include underscores, but they are case-insensitive (by default), but some compilers require uppercase only. However, in modern Fortran (f90+) you can use lowercase and uppercase, but variable names are still case-insensitive unless the compiler option is set. \n\nBut to avoid issues, perhaps use variables without underscores.\n\nLet me denote 'time_after_eat' as 'tae', 'time' as 'a_time' to comply.\n\nSo the condition in Fortran: if ( (tae - time) >=0 ) and (tae - time < T ) then...\n\nSo putting it all together in code.\n\nNow, when the condition is met, then:\n\ndp(i, tae) = max( dp(i, tae), dp(i-1, tae - time) + value )\n\nNow, the loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1,N\n   do tae =0, 6000\n\n      ! first set dp(i,tae) to the max between current and previous row's same time.\n\n      if ( dp(i,tae) < dp(i-1, tae ) ) then\n          dp(i, tae) = dp(i-1, tae)\n      end if\n\n      time = AB(i,1)\n      value = AB(i,2)\n\n      ! condition check\n      if ( (tae - time >=0 ) .and. (tae - time < T ) ) then\n         temp_val = dp(i-1, tae - time) + value\n         if ( dp(i, tae) < temp_val ) then\n             dp(i,tae) = temp_val\n         end if\n      end if\n\n   end do  ! tae loop\nend do      ! i loop\n\nWait but in Fortran, it's better to use the max function:\n\ndp(i,tae) = max( dp(i,tae), dp( i-1 , tae ) )\n\nSimilarly for the other line:\n\ntmp = dp(i-1, tae - time) + value\n\ndp(i,tae) = max(dp(i,tae), tmp )\n\nThis may be more efficient.\n\nNow, initial conditions as well. Before the main loops, the initial DP(0, :) is zero, because initialized to zero. The DP starts at index 0 for i=0.\n\nWait, the loops start at i=1, and the first step when i=1:\n\ndp(1, tae) is initialized (from allocation) to zero, then compared to dp(0, tae). So the first step would set dp(1,tae) to maximum between 0 and dp[0][tae], which is zero. Except when the previous row (i-1=0) has any value.\n\nWait the DP initialization: I must check that.\n\nThe DP array was initialized to 0, so all dp[i][j] start at zero.\n\nSo for each i, first, the code updates dp[i][tae] to be at least as big as the previous row's dp[i-1][tae], so that propagates the maximum when not taking the current item.\n\nYes. So the first line is necessary, after the first line of the inner loop.\n\nNow, what about indexes when T is large? Well, in the Java code, the second dimension is 6001 (since T is up to that?), so 6000 can cover up to T=6000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the original problem T can be up to say 5999, but the DP is built for up to 6000.\n\nWait the condition in the code is that the \"timeAfterEat - time\" needs to be less than T. That T is given as input.\n\nWait, so the maximum T can be large? For example T=3e5? But in the code, the DP is only tracking up to 6000. Therefore there's a possible error here.\n\nWait, no, looking at the original code, if T is very large, like over 6000, then the condition (tae - time < T) would always be true for tae which are less than 6000 (since time is non-negative). Wait but that might not be the case.\n\nWait let me think. The code's DP is for each item, tracks time_after_eat as the current time plus whatever. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to track whether adding this item doesn't make the time pass T. Wait let me see.\n\nWait, original problem must be: \n\nYou have items with time [a] and value [b], select a subset so that the sum of a_i' (times) that are not exceeding T in a certain way?\n\nWait no, perhaps the problem is that each item takes a certain time (a_i), and when you eat it, its timing must be such that its a_i (maybe start time?) but the problem is unclear. Alternatively, the problem is to choose some items where the time taken to consume them plus some time ?\n\nWait, this code looks similar to the \"maximum value of items you can pick such that the sum of a_i minus some function is under T\".\n\nWait, since in the code for the DP step, the check is that (tae - time) < T. \n\nWait, the code's logic is as follows:\n\nwhen considering the i-th item, which has time 'time' and value 'value' (AB[i][1] in java's 0-based array). The timeAfterEat is the current total time. Wait the DP[i][tae] is the maximum value attainable with the first i items and end time \"tae\".\n\nWait the transition is: To have a total time of tae, you can choose whether to include this current item or not.\n\nCase 1: Do not include it: So DP[i][tae] remains max between previous value and DP[i-1][tae].\n\nCase 2: Include the item. But when you take this item:\n\nThe new time would be 'tae' equals (previous timeBeforeEat) + (time). Wait, maybe the problem requires that the \"timeAfterEat\" must be such that (timeBeforeEat) < T, when adding the current time.\n\nWait the formula in the code's condition is:\n(timeAfterEat - time) must be >=0, and less than T.\n\nWait that is:\n\nprevious_timeAfterEat (the timeBefore this item is taken) is (tae - time), must be between [0, T-1]. \n\nSo the previous time was before this item, so that previous_time (before eating item i) must be less than T.\n\nWhen taking the item, you add the item's time. So the new time is (previous_time + time) = previous_time + time must be <= T-1 + time? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the logic is that the time taken to \"take\" this item must leave the meals in such a way that the \"current time\" after addition can be over but the condition for the cumulated time before choosing it must be less than T.\n\nHmm. Regardless, the code's condition must remain as per the original Java, so it's important to translate the condition exactly.\n\nNow, the T in the code must be input from the user, and the DP loops over up to 6000.\n\nSo regardless of input T, the code allows tae up to 6000. So if T >6000, the DP might not track correctly. Wait perhaps in the problem the constraints are small, for example T up to 6000 ?\n\nThe problem might have been, say, T up to 6000, so the DP works. Maybe the problem statement requires T up to 6000.\n\nWell, given the original code uses 6001 columns, the T must be <= 6000? Or maybe the code is intended for T up to 1e4 but uses a higher value?\n\nWell, the Java code must be correct as per the problem. Assuming that, so the code's translation must be precise.\n\nContinuing with the DP part:\n\nNow, the loop variables are correctly transformed.\n\nNow the final step:\n\nAfter filling up the DP table, the answer is the maximum value in DP[N][0 ... 6000]\n\nIn Java, that is done with Arrays.stream(dp[N]).max().getAsInt();\n\nIn Fortran, to find the maximum over all elements in the last row (row N) of the DP array:\n\nmax_value = maxval( dp(N, 0:6000) )\n\nThen print that value.\n\nNow putting all together.\n\nNow, the critical part is sorting. The code in Fortran must sort AB's rows based on the first column.\n\nLet me code a sort for the AB's first column.\n\nApproach: using bubble sort for the indices, but since it's N^2, perhaps it's manageable if N is up to say, 100 or 1000, and T is up to 6000.\n\nThe problem may have small constraints. \n\nWait the original Java problem's code has a DP loop with 6000 iterations for each N items. So N is typically up to around 1e4 to 1e5? Let's check the DP steps.\n\nWait the code's DP's loops:\n\nThe first loop runs N times. The inner loop runs 6001 times (for each i). Thus the total operations are 6000*N. So even if N is 1e5, that would be 6e7 operations, which is acceptable? Not sure, but in programming contests, perhaps this is acceptable for the problem's constraints.\n\nBack to the sort code:\n\nHere's code for the indices' bubble sort:\n\n   integer :: i,j, temp_i\n   real :: temp_ab1\n   logical :: swapped\n\n   ! Initialize index array\n   do i = 1,N\n     indices(i) = i\n   end do\n\n   do\n     swapped = .false.\n     do i=1,N-1\n        if ( AB( indices(i), 1 ) > AB( indices(i+1), 1 ) ) then\n            temp_i = indices(i)\n            indices(i) = indices(i+1)\n            indices(i+1) = temp_i\n            swapped = .true.\n        end if\n     end do\n     if( .not. swapped ) exit\n   end do\n\nThis is a bubble sort with a flag to terminate when no swaps are needed. This is O(N^2) time. For N up to 3e4 that could be like ( (3e4)^2 )= 9e8 operations, but that's way too slow.\n\nWait, that would be problematic. \n\nSo, the problem must have a smaller N. But in programming contest codes, perhaps the original code's sort is not the most efficient, but passes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the sort to be in place on the AB array.\n\nWait since we have to sort the AB's rows based on the first element, the Fortran code could instead sort the AB array in-place.\n\nHmm, here's an alternative approach using a helper function (but for brevity, in programming contests, we need something manageable.\n\nAlternatively, a quicksort routine is better.\n\nAlternatively, since I need to ship functional code, I can use the `result = minloc` and selection sort? But that would take O(N^2) time again.\n\nAlternatively, here's a quicksort algorithm in fortran for an array.\n\nWriting quicksort for Fortran could be a bit time-consuming.\n\nBut given that the user wants a translation, perhaps better to proceed in the following way, assuming that even for the problem constraints, the N is such that bubble sort is acceptable.\n\nWait wait perhaps the problem has a note saying N is up to 1000 or something. Without knowing the problem is hard to proceed, but given that the code works.\n\nAlternatively, I can use fortran's intrinsic sort to sort the first column.\n\nAh, here's a way:\n\nin fortran, the following code sorts the first column, and then the rows are moved accordingly.\n\nBut Fortran's sort only operates on ranks.\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nDo not sort AB, but use the indices array sorted, then in the DP loops can refer to AB in the sorted order.\n\nWait, in the DP loops, when you need to process each item in sorted order (after the AB array has been sorted), the items are considered in the order sorted. So, if AB is not sorted but we can reference via indices, then for i from 1 to N:\n\nitem is AB( indices(i), 1), etc.\n\nWait yes! So we can sort the indices array as above, and then in the loops, instead of accessing AB(i,1), it becomes AB( indices(i) ), so in code, when building the DP loops:\n\nreplace AB(i,1) with AB( indices(i),1 )\n\nWait this would allow us to sort the indices, and then iterate over the indices' order. The DP loops would then use the sorted items. \n\nAh, that's a good approach. So we don't have to sort the AB array itself, just keep track of the indices which give the sorted order.\n\nThis avoids moving the data in AB and for the DP loops, just use O(1) to get the current item's values via the indices array.\n\nTherefore, in code:\n\nAfter generating the indices array as outlined (sorted), the loops proceed as:\n\ndo i=1,N\n   current_row = indices(i)\n   time = AB(current_row,1)\n   value = AB(current_row,2)\n   ... \nend do\n\nTherefore in the code above, in the DP loops, the i (loop variable in the outer loop) corresponds to the indices array's elements in order.\n\nThus, the code can perform as required.\n\nTherefore, for the code, the sorting part is handled via indices, using the indices array.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_e\n  implicit none\n  integer :: i,j,t\n  integer :: N, T\n  integer, allocatable :: AB(:,:), dp(:,:), indices(:)\n  integer :: max_value\n\n  ! Read N and T\n  read*, N, T\n\n  ! Allocate AB array [1..N][1..2]\n  allocate(AB(N,2))\n  do i =1, N\n    read*, AB(i, 1), AB(i,2)\n  end do\n\n  !

Also, the AND in FORTRAN is .AND.\n\nThus, the condition:\n\nif ( (time_after_eat >= a_time) .and. ( (time_after_eat - a_time) < T ) ) then\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, the initial max assignment can be replaced with:\n\ndp(i, ta) = max( dp(i,ta), dp(i-1,ta) )\n\nSince all are integers, using the max function directly is better.\n\nThus the full loop rewritten would be:\n\n  ! DP main loop:\n  do i=1,N\n    current_row = indices(i)\n    a_time = AB(current_row,1)\n    a_value = AB(current_row,2)\n\n    do time_after_eat =0,6000\n       ! set maximum between current and previous row\n       dp(i, time_after_eat) = max( dp(i,time_after_eat), dp(i-1, time_after_eat) )\n\n       ! check if possible to take this item\n       if ( time_after_eat >=a_time .and. (time_after_eat - a_time) < T ) then\n           possible_val = dp(i-1, time_after_eat - a_time ) + a_value\n           dp(i, time_after_eat) = max(dp(i, time_after_eat), possible_val )\n       end if\n    end do   \n  end do\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, now, the DP array indices:\n\nThe initial allocation for the dp array is:\n\nallocate( dp(0:N, 0:6000) )\n\nThus in the code:\n\ndp(i-1,...) is valid, as i starts at 1, and dp(0, ...) is available.\n\nNow, also, initializing dp to zero is okay because that is the starting state (no items selected).\n\nNow, the sort subroutine: note that the indices are N in size, and after the sort, they are ordered by AB's first column.\n\nThe Bubble Sort Subroutine:\n\nThe sort_indices subroutine does what is described. It uses a sequential bubble sort until no more swaps. This has O(N^2) time complexity. If N is up to say 2000, it's ~4,000,000 comparisons, which should be manageable in Fortran. If N is larger, the problem must not be intended this way.\n\nAlternatively, a better sort function like QuickSort would be better, but coding a full QuickSort inside the subroutine would take more effort.\n\nAssuming the problem's constraints allow this bubble sort.\n\nNow, compiling and testing.\n\nLet me also check array allocations. For the AB array of N rows and 2 columns, all correct.\n\nTesting for potential off-by-one errors: for the indices array.\n\nNow, final code adjustments."
