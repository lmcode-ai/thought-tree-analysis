Then for i to pass the condition, the only bits set in i must be in the third bit (but that would have to be exactly 4?) so the indexes would be 0 or 4?

So all indices that are such that in binary, they only have bits set in the bits where m has them. Wait no\u2014the bits set in i must be a subset of those in m.

So the j is equal to i_f -1. Wait the mask in Java was using the variable 'i' (the 0-based index), so in Fortran's the mask condition should be calculated using j (the java's index). So the mask condition is ( m .AND. j ) ==j ?\n\nBecause in Java the condition is \" ( (m & i) == i )\" where m is (n-1) and i the 0-based index.",

Suppose the difference is \"diff\", we can write this as:\n\nstring_part = TEXT(diff) But Fortran does not have a built-in function like that. Wait, perhaps using a character variable, e.g.:\n\ninteger :: diff\ncharacter(len=4) :: temp_char\n\nwrite(temp_char, *) diff But this might have some space characters, so better to use a FORMATTED read. Alternatively using an internal write:\n\ninteger diff\ncharacter(10) :: temp_char\nwrite(temp_char, *) diff\ntemp_char = adjustl(temp_char)  ' to remove leading spaces\n\nBut maybe this is safer.

So that when the partial s_diff has trailing spaces from previous steps, which would turn into blanks instead of considering as parts of the string. So the code should use:\n\ns_diff = trim( s_diff ) // trim( temp_char ) But in the case where temp_char is ' 12 ', after adjustl and trim, it's '12', but when converting via a write, perhaps the temp_char is just written with enough space.",

Thus, this is a mistake. This is a big issue. Thus, the code for the n=2 case must build the difference correctly, like the general code. Thus the code's the n==2 path must compute the difference string as the string representation of the difference, which may be over a single character. Thus, fix this.\n\n instead of assuming a single character:\n\n the case when n==2:\n\n difference_val = abs( ichar(s_initial(2:2)) - ichar(s_initial(1:1))\n\n write(temp_char, '(I0)' ) difference_val\n\n temp_trimmed = trim( temp_char )\n\n s_diff = temp_trimmed \n\n (then print the s_diff which may be '10' for example, and the length is 2, so outputting the first character is wrong, because the '1' is first character and '0' second? Wait wait the problem code says \"if n ==2 {\n\n    out.println( sb.charAt(0) ); return;}\n\nThus the difference string has length (n-1)=1 (since Java's n was the length of the original string. So in the case, if the input is original length 2, the difference is one value, which would be a one-character string. Thus the difference must be between 0 - 255 (ASCII differences), but coding it as a character with ASCII code may be wrong because differences >9 give non-digit characters, but the code in the problem's java code uses the original method of appending the Math.abs(...) as an integer.",

The difference is stored as \"32\", then the sb will have length 2 in this case; thus the code then writes sb.charAt(0)",

Ah, the problem's conditions must have the input such that for n==2, the difference is a single digit?\n\nUnlikely. So perhaps the original code has a bug here, but maybe not, because the code in the problem may have a different treatment. Alternatively perhaps the loop for the difference string is not allowed for 2: but in code, for n=2, the difference string's length is 1, but when waiting for two characters. wait I'm getting confused. Wait the code when n is 2:\n\nThe generator loop:\n\n    for (int i=1; i <n; i++) { // loops once (i=1 when n=2).",

Thus the String is built as one character if the difference is single-digit, but for differences over 9, it's two characters (but then the length would be 2?). But the code in Java says:\n\n    if(n==2) {\n\n        out.println(sb.charAt(0));\n\n    } so, for difference of 10, the sb would be \"10\", and the code prints the first character '1'.\n\n which is wrong.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main parts are the `cal` method and the `solve` method which does some string manipulation and calculations. Let's break down the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the `cal` function takes a string `s` and a character `c`. It loops through each character in the string. For each position `i`, if the character at that index equals `c` and if the bitwise AND of `m` and `i` equals `i` (so that means `i` is a subset of set bits in m?), then it toggles the `ans` with XOR 1. The output is the final ans (0 or 1).\n\nWait, m here is n-1 where n is the length of the string. So for a given string of length n, m is a bitmask with bits set up to n-1's bits. The condition `(m & i) == i` means that i is a subset of the bits set in m. Since m is n-1, its binary representation is all 1's up to the bit where n is. So, for example, if n is 5, m is 4 (since 5-1=4?), wait wait, wait, no: n is the original string length? Wait, let's see: in the Java code, `n = s.length()`, then `m = n-1`. Wait, n is length, which is an integer. But m is the length minus 1, so for example, if the string is \"abc\", n would be 3 and m is 2. So the mask is m (like binary 10), then for each `i` (indices 0,1,2), we check (2 & i) == i?\n\nWait when i is 0: (2 & 0) =0 ==0 \u2192 true. \n\ni=1: 2 &1 is 0, so no. \n\ni=2: 2 &2 = 2 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, for a string of length 3, indices 0 and 2 are considered. Hmm. \n\nThe condition checks whether the number i has all bits set in i that m has? Wait, I think that if m & i =i, then i is a subset of the bits in m, meaning i is less than or equal to m? Wait, m is n-1. For example, if n=4, then m is 3, so binary 11, which means any i between 0-3 (since indexes go up to 3). Then for any i, (m &i) = i \u2192 yes, but because m is exactly n-1, which is the maximum index. Actually, since m is n-1, the bitwise condition (m AND i) equals i effectively means that all set bits in i are within the bits set in m. Since m is n-1, which has all lower bits set up to the one just below n's bit, the condition is always true. Wait, no, wait because m's value is exactly (n-1), which in binary, is the number with bits all 1 up to the n's position. For example, if n is 4, then m is 3 (binary 11), so for i from 0 to 3, m is 3 and any i less than or equal to that will have their bits within m's bits. So in that case, the condition holds for all i? That seems odd. Wait, for n=2, m is 1. So for i=0 and 1. For i=1, m=1, so 1 &1 =1 ==1 so that's true. But if n is 3, m is 2 (binary 10), so for i=3? Wait, no, n is 3, indices go up to 2 (i<3). Let's see for i=1, which is 01 in binary. Then m is 10 in binary. So 10 AND 01 is 00, which is not equal to 1's value(01). So that's false. Wait wait, this is conflicting. So when m=2 (binary 10), then for i=1 (01), 10 &01 =0 and that's different from 01, so the condition only holds when the i's bits are within the bits set in m. So in the case, if i can be represented as subset of bits of m, then the condition holds.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is equivalent to \"i is a subset of bits of m\", meaning that all bits set in i are set in m. That would be the case when m AND i == i. For example, m being (n-1) would have all the bits from 0 to (n-1's bit). So if the current index i is such that its binary is a subset of m's bits. Wait, but m is n-1, so any i less than m is allowed?\n\nWait, let's think of m being n-1. For i in 0..n-1 (since n is length). So for example, if n=3 (so m=2, which is 10 in binary), then when i=1 (binary 01), m AND i is 0 \u2192 not equal to i=1. Hence, the condition fails. So for m=2 and i=1, the condition doesn't hold, so that i is ignored.\n\nAh, so the condition is \"i must be a power of two?\" Because when n is, say, 4, then m=3 (0b11), so any i which is a power of two like 1, 2, and 4 (wait but 4 is beyond), so in 0-3, 1 (binary 01) and 0 (00), 2 (10) would be bits set in n-1?\n\nWait, like for m = n-1, the set bits in m are exactly those bits of n-1. So for i to satisfy (m &i) ==i, it must be that when we do the AND, all bits set in i are also set in m. Hence, any i that has bits only in the positions where m has them. Since m is n-1, it's the maximum index allowed (since indices are up to n-1). The bits of m are exactly the bits up to the floor(log2(n))? Not exactly. Let's think numerically. For example:\n\nIf n=5 (so m =4 (100)), then the bits in m are just the third bit (since 4 in binary is 100). Then for i to pass the condition, the only bits set in i must be in the third bit (but that would have to be exactly 4?) so the indexes would be 0 or 4?\n\nSo for m=4 (so n=5), the i=4: the AND of 4 &4 =4 \u2192 which matches.\n\nIf the index is 0 (000), 4 &0 is 0, which is equal to i=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo all indices that are such that in binary, they only have bits set in the bits where m has them. Wait no\u2014the bits set in i must be a subset of those in m. Since m is n-1, which is exactly one less than n, perhaps m is all bits set to 1 except the highest bit needed for n.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should not dwell too much on the conditions but just translate the code as-is into Fortran. Maybe I can keep the same logic in Fortran.\n\nNow, the `cal` method returns 0 or 1. The solve function seems to process the input string, then build a new string from the differences between consecutive characters. Those differences are absolute, probably the ASCII difference. So for a string 'a','c' (like 'ac'), the difference would be 2 (c is 99, a is 97, abs 2).\n\nWait in Java, `s.charAt(i)` returns the char, and the difference computes the numerical difference between the two chars, and then take absolute value. Then that is converted to a character? Because appending to a string. \n\nWait in `solve`:\n\nThe code starts by reading n as an integer, then the string s. Then it creates a new string builder, and loops from 1 to n-1 (Java's for(int i=1; i < n; i++) where n is the initial 'n' variable). So the first character is s.charAt(1), subtract previous. The loop appends the absolute differences between the i-th and (i-1)-th char as a single character? Wait wait: the code does:\n\nsb.append(Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1)));\n\nThat Math.abs returns an int, but then appending to a string would convert it to a string? Or is it taking the numeric value as the character's ASCII code? For example, if the difference is 2, then the ASCII character for 50 is '2' (since '0' is 48). Wait, no\u2014Wait, in Java, when you append an int to a String, it converts it to a string representation. So 2 becomes '2' because that's the character '2'? Wait no, no. Let's see:\n\nThe Java method `StringBuilder.append(int)` appends the string representation of the integer. So for Math.abs(result), which is the absolute difference between the two characters (which gives an integer), so if the difference is 3, it's converted to the string \"3\" and appended. Therefore, the resulting string after the loop would have characters like '2', '3', or '1' as digits.\n\nWait so the first for loop in solve builds a new string where each character is the absolute difference between consecutive characters of the input string, stored as their string digits. So, the first part is creating a new string by those digits converted to strings.\n\nBut wait `s` in this code is the original string. Wait, after the loop, they do `s = sb.toString()`; Which overwrites the original s with the new string made of these digits. Then, check if the original n was 2. If so, they just print the first character of this new string (since for n=2, the new string has one character). Otherwise, proceed.\n\nThen, after that, they check if the new s contains '1'. If so, print the cal(s, '1') result, else print twice cal(s,'2').\n\nWait, but in Java, the `String.contains(\"1\")` is equivalent to checking if '1' is present anywhere in the string s. So the function reads whether any of the previous differences was 1.\n\nSo the main goal here is to compute this cal function on the digit-strings of the differences, depending on whether there's a '1' in there.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran:\n\nFortran does not have built-in functions like Java's StringTokenizer or things like that. So I will need to handle input differently. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the variables. Let's see:\n\nIn the solve function, first step:\n\nn = sc.nextInt()\n\nThen the string s = sc.next()\n\nWait, in Java, sc.next() takes the next token, so the input is probably given as a string consisting of n characters possibly, or maybe the string is a n-length input and the nextInt reads n. For example:\n\nLike input is:\n\n3\n\nabc\n\nSo n is 3, s is \"abc\".\n\nBut I need to read n first, then read the next token as the string s. In Fortran, we can read input using read statements. \n\nFirst, for the MyScanner class, since in Java sc is the scanner. In Fortran, probably, we have to read from stdin using read(*,*) or something similar. So first, for ingestion:\n\nThe main function in Fortran will handle input.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, to declare variables. \n\nBut first, the `cal` function will have to be a Subroutine or a function. Since it's returning an integer, it can be a function.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed:\n\nImplementing the `cal` function in Fortran. Let's think.\n\nIn Java's `cal` function, parameters are a string and a char. In Fortran, strings are a little different. We can represent s as a character array. The character c can be a char (Fortran's character type).\n\nThe function cal(s, c) in Fortran would be something like:\n\nFUNCTION cal(s,c)\n  character(len=*), intent(in)    :: s\n  character(len=1), intent(in)    :: c\n  integer                         :: cal, n, m, i, ans, m_bit\n \n  n = len_trim(s)\n  m = n - 1\n  ans = 0\n  do i=1, n !Wait wait, indices in fortran are from 1 to len_trim(s). Wait, but in Java the indices start at 0. Wait, in Java's s.charAt(i) is from 0 (first char) to n-1.\n\nOh right: in the loop, in Java:\n\nfor(int i=0; i< n; i++){ so the indices go up to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, strings are indexed from 1 to n. So the first character is s(1), the last is s(n) when n is length.\n\nHence, in code:\n\ns in the input would have length n_str (the length of the string s).\n\nBut in the cal function:\n\nThe Java code's 'n' is the length of the string (so len(s)), then m is n-1. So in Fortran, the same.\n\nWait in the loop over i from 0 to n-1 in Java:\n\nloop variable ranges from 0 to n-1, inclusive (i <n). So in fortran the loop indices would need to go from 0 to n-1? But Fortran starts at 1. So to index correctly, perhaps in the cal function, we loop i from 1 to n (number of the characters).\n\nWait, no. Let's think:\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let me take the cal function first.\n\nThe cal function in code:\n\nString s. n = s.length()\n\nm=n-1\n\nans=0\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1 (loop over each character):\n\nif (s.charAt(i) == c) and ( (m &i) ==i ) then ans ^=1\n\nThus, for each position i (starting at 0?), the code checks the character and the bitmask.\n\nSo in fortran, the string's indices start at 1. So when in java, i is zero-based (0 to n-1), in Fortran, the indices are 1-based (1 to n). Thus, when we loop in Fortran over each character, variable i runs from 1 to n, and the Java counter i is equal to (i_in_fortran-1).\n\nSo in code:\n\nin Fortran code:\n\ndo i =1, n\n    j = i -1   ' the java's i (0 to n-1)\n    if (s(i) == c) then\n       m_j= m .AND. j  ' because m is n-1 (Fortran's n is len). Wait.\n\nWait, the 'm' in Java code is n_java-1 where n_java is the original length. So in fortran, m would be (n-1), since n is the length.\n\nWait when in Fortran, code:\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nm = n -1 \n\nso m is same as Java.\n\nthe mask condition is (m &i ) ==i\n\nWait but i in fortran's loop is from 1 to n, but the Java loop uses i from 0 to n-1. So the j is equal to i_f -1.\n\nWait the mask in Java was using the variable 'i' (the 0-based index), so in Fortran's the mask condition should be calculated using j (the java's index). So the mask condition is ( m .AND. j ) ==j ?\n\nBecause in Java the condition is \" ( (m & i) == i )\" where m is (n-1) and i the 0-based index.\n\nThus, in fortran, we compute j = i_f -1 (because when i_f is 1, that's the first character (0 in Java)), and then we check if ( m .AND. j ) ==j.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the fortran cal function would need to loop over each character in s (for i from 1 to length of s), compute j (i-1), check if the ith character equals c, then compute the mask condition: (m .AND. j) == j. \n\nWe need bitwise AND in Fortran. Fortran does have bit operations.\n\nBut for negative numbers, but here variables will be integers (j is from 0 to length-1 (0-based), and m is n-1, which is also >=0.\n\nThus, the expression (m .AND. j) == j ?\n\nSo the Fortran code for the cal function would be something like:\n\nFUNCTION cal(s, c) RESULT(result)\n  CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN) :: s\n  CHARACTER(LEN=1), INTENT(IN) :: c\n  INTEGER :: result, i, n, m, j, ans, temp\n  n = LEN(s)  ! assuming that the trailing blanks matter? Probably, since in Fortran strings are fixed length and have trailing spaces unless we use LEN_TRIM. Wait but the strings in Java would be like the input string s, so the length is the actual string length, so perhaps we should use LEN_TRIM( s ) ?\n\nWait, because when passing a string parameter in Fortran with (len=*), the LEN() of the variable will include the allocated length. So perhaps better to use LEN_TRIM() to get the actual length.\n\nWait, the 's' parameter in cal would be passed as a Fortran string. Let me check:\n\nSuppose the string is 'abc', then in fortran's s is stored with length computed via substrings or functions. Hmm, better to take the length as LEN_TRIM(s), so to get the length properly. So maybe the code should be:\n\nn = LEN_TRIM( s )\n\nOtherwise, if the string is padded with spaces, the LEN would count those, which might not be desired.\n\nBut since the code is processing the String s as in Java (which doesn't have trailing spaces?), So the input would have non-space characters.\n\nAssuming that, so n = LEN_TRIM( s ). Thus, m = n -1.\n\nans =0\n\nThen loop over each character of s.\n\nSo in the loop, for i from 1 to n:\n\nj = i -1 \n\nif s(i:i) == c then check the bitwise condition.\n\nm is n-1 (an integer), j is i-1 (the 0-based java index).\n\nCompute bitwise AND between m and j.\n\nIn Fortran, the logical operation for bit AND is IAND(m, j).\n\nWait yes: IAND is the intrinsic function that does the bitwise AND on two integers.\n\nThen check if IAND(m,j) == j. That is equivalent to (m & j) ==j.\n\nIf so, then ans is XORed with 1. (ans = ans XOR 1 \u2192 basically toggles between 0 and1).\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nDO i = 1, n\n    j = i-1\n    IF ( s(i:i) .eq. c ) THEN\n       IF ( IAND( m,j ) == j ) THEN\n          ans = IEOR( ans, 1 )\n       ENDIF\n    ENDIF\n END DO\n\nThe function returns ans. So cal would return this ans.\n\nTherefore, the cal function is written.\n\nNext, the main part: the solve function.\n\nFirst, in the solve function:\n\nRead an integer n (the input length of the first string, but perhaps in this problem's context, the string s is of length n. Like the problem's input is n and then a string of length n.\n\nSo in Java code:\n\nThe code reads n with sc.nextInt();\n\nthen reads s with sc.next() (which would read the entire line, but in online judges, the next() would read until space, but perhaps in the problem, the second argument is the string, so perhaps each number is given with the string separated. Maybe the input is n followed by the string in the same line. Like if n is 3 and the string is 'abc', the input would be something like 3 abc.\n\nHence, in fortran, the code can proceed by first reading the input.\n\nImplementing the solving.\n\nFirst, read n from stdin.\n\nThen read the second String which is the s. But in fortran, handling this requires some steps. Let's see:\n\nThe solve routine is called, in Java, from main. So in Fortran, perhaps the main program will call a solve subroutine, which handles the input/output.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, variables: s_initial (the original input string) and then converting to a new string.\n\nWait the Java code's solve function first reads n (the number), then s (the string input). Then it constructs a new string based on the differences between consecutive characters.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst the variables needed:\n\nIn solving:\n\nn = integer read.\n\ns is the initial input.\n\nthen create a new string (in Java, a String built using the StringBuilder).\n\nThe new string is built by appending the absolute difference between s[i] and s[i-1], for i from 1 to n-1 (Java indices start at 0, so the loop in the code's for (int i=1; i <n; i++)). Since the input is the 's' of length n, so indices 0 to n-1.\n\nEach term added is the absolute value of (char at position i minus char's previous), converted to a string digit.\n\nSo in code, for each i from 1 to i <n (in total n-1 iterations). \n\nThus, the resulting string has length n-1.\n\nWait in Fortran, for a string:\n\nThe loop in Fortran would be:\n\ninitialized differences string is empty first. \n\nfor each character from position 2 to n (since in a 1-based string, the indices for 2 to n:\n\noriginal s has characters from s(1) to s(n).\n\nfor i from 2 to n:\n\ndiff = ABS( ICHAR(s(i)) - ICHAR(s(i-1) ) )\n\nWe need to convert this diff (the numeric difference) to a character. The ASCII for the digits are 48 (for '0'), so like for diff=5, the char is '5' (ASCII 53).\n\nIn Fortran, to get the numeric value, use ICHAR.\n\nBut then, to make the string, we need to append the character representation of the difference's value. \n\nWait in Java's code:\n\nMath.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i-1)) returns an int (like 1,2, etc.) which is then appended to the string, which appends the string representation (so 1\u2192\"1\", etc.)\n\nThus, in Fortran, we can create this difference string by constructing a character string where each digit is the numeric value's character.\n\nFor each difference:\n\nCompute the difference between the current and previous characters (their ASCII codes' absolute difference).\n\nThen, the digit is \"0\" + difference.\n\nThus, in Fortran, for each diff, we can convert it to character with ACHAR(48 + diff).\n\nWait wait: Let's suppose the difference is 1 \u2192 ASCII 48 +1 =49 \u2192 '1'.\n\nIf the difference is 3, that's 51, which is '3'.\n\nThus, possible.\n\nWait but what if the difference was a two-digit number? Because  in the problem's setup, the input characters could be any characters, so the difference might be more than 9. Wait, in the problem?\n\nAGC043 problem B. Looking at the problem, maybe this is a specific problem but maybe the difference is between consecutive letters in a string, which could be any. Wait, but the code as provided in Java appends the absolute difference as integer to the string. So for example, if the difference is 10, then the code would append the string \"10\".\n\nWait wait, no. Because in Java, when you do Math.abs( ... ), you get an integer, say 10, then append (int) which appends \"10\" as the string \"10\". So the resulting string after the loop would have the digits as strings each. For example, differences of 1 and 10 would make the string \"110\".\n\nWait but in the code:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n-1 (0-based or 1-based? Wait in Java the first loop is for i starting at 1. the code's loop is for Java's for (i=1; i <n ; i++ ), so for n=3, that would be i=1 and 2 ( indices 1 and 2 in Java's 0-based? Wait no. Wait the loop in Java is \"for(int i=1; i <n ; i++)\". The initial argument is i=1 (Java increment starts at 1), then the condition is i <n. So when n is 3, loop runs i=1 and 2 (since those are less than 3). So the indices in the first string are from 1 to n-1 (Java's i:0-based indices up to n-1? Wait no, no.\n\nWait, if n is the length of s (s is length 3), then loop over i from 1 to 2 (since i starts at 1 and increments until less than 3). So the next character in s is s[i] where in Java, that is the i-th character (counting from zero? Wait no, wait:\n\nIn the first loop in Java:\n\nfor(int i=1; i <n; ...) \n\nJava's string's length is n, so the indices go from 0 to n-1. The loop starts at i=1 (i.e. first character s[1], and compares to s[i-1] (i-1=0).\n\nThus, the loop is doing N\u22121 \u22121 + something? Anyway, in Fortran, for a 1-based string, it would be:\n\nstarting at 2 to n (because for a string of length n). Thus, for each i from 2 to n:\n\nthe current character is s(i), previous is s(i-1).\n\nThus the differences between i and i-1 for 2..n:\n\neach term is ABS( ICHAR(s(i)) - ICHAR(s(i-1)) ).\n\nThus, the difference is stored as an integer, then converting to a character by taking its string representation.\n\nWait in Fortran, how to convert an integer to a character string?\n\nSuppose the difference is \"diff\", we can write this as:\n\nstring_part = TEXT(diff)\n\nBut Fortran does not have a built-in function like that.\n\nWait, perhaps using a character variable, e.g.:\n\ninteger :: diff\ncharacter(len=4) :: temp_char\n\nwrite(temp_char, *) diff\n\nBut this might have some space characters, so better to use a FORMATTED read.\n\nAlternatively using an internal write:\n\ninteger diff\ncharacter(10) :: temp_char\nwrite(temp_char, *) diff\ntemp_char = adjustl(temp_char)  ' to remove leading spaces\n\nBut maybe this is safer.\n\nWait but in Fortran, to pass to a string, perhaps the length should be allocated.\n\nAlternatively, since we are building a character string:\n\nThe loop could:\n\ndefine a string variable, and sequentially build it.\n\nLet's think step by step:\n\n1. Read n and the original string s_initial (character*(*) variable).\n\nSuppose s_initial is declared as character(len=your_max) and read. \n\nBut in fortran, reading the original string after the integer:\n\nThe main program will read n, then read the rest of the line (or until the next whitespace) as s_initial. \n\nFor instance, using list-directed input:\n\nread(*,*) n, s_initial\n\nIf s_initial could have white-space, this may not work. But assuming the input is like: first the integer, then the string without spaces.\n\nAlternatively, to read the string as a separate input, perhaps first read n with read(*,*) n, then read the next entire line except the leading space.\n\nAlternatively, the input the string with the maximum length, waiting for it. But this can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, using a character with enough length.\n\nSuppose:\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: s_initial, temp_str, s_diff\n\nThus:\n\nread(*,*) n, s_initial  ' tries to read two inputs: the n and the next as s_initial. But if s_initial has multiple words, it may not work. However, in the problem, perhaps each line contain n and the string s, separated (like n is 3, s is \"abc\", so the input line is \"3 abc\").\n\nThus, with that assumption, this should be okay.\n\nSo once n and s_initial are read, we can process s_initial into the difference string.\n\nThe differences string is built first by looping over each character from 2 to len(s_initial) (the original s_initial has length n).\n\nBut we can check with:\n\noriginal_length = len_trim(s_initial)\n\nin case the stored character had more space characters, but when we read via *, then the input may be limited, or perhaps the length is kept. Assume that it's correct.\n\nProceeding:\n\nthe difference string is:\n\nwe can pre-allocate s_diff to have length n-1 (since for n characters, there are n-1 differences).\n\ns_diff= '          '  (fill with space, then build step by step)\n\nor, use an array.\n\nBut in code:\n\nallocate an array of integers (or characters) for the differences, then convert to string.\n\nAlternatively, build a character string by appending each time.\n\nAlternatively, using a character variable initialized to space, and then a loop.\n\nThus:\n\ninteger :: k\ninteger :: initial_length\ninitial_length = len_trim(s_initial)\ns_diff = ' '(len = initial_length -1, since for i from 2 to initial_length, n terms?\n\nWait let me get:\n\nfor each position from 2 to initial_length (since s_initial is 1-based) there are (initial_length -1) terms.\n\nThus, the length s_diff must be at least (n-1).\n\nNow, starting building s_diff:\n\ndo i = 2, initial_length\n\n    diff_value = ICHAR(s_initial(i:i)) - ICHAR(s_initial(i-1:i-1))\n\n    diff_value_abs = ABS(diff_value)\n\n    ! convert diff_value_abs to a string?\n\n    ! temp_char holds the string representation\n\n    ! perhaps using an internal write:\n\n    write(temp_char, '(I10)') diff_value_abs \n\n    ! then trim it to get only the digits\n\n    temp_char_trimmed = adjustl(temp_char)\n\n    ! then append it to s_diff.\n\n    s_diff = s_diff(1:k-1) // temp_char_trimmed\n\n    k = k + ... but wait, need a counter.\n\nAlternatively, initialize a character array:\n\ninteger, parameter :: MAXDIFF_LEN = 1000\n\ncharacter(len=MAXDIFF_LEN) :: s_diff = ''\n\nlen_sdiff=0\n\ndo i=2,initial_length\n\n    ...\n\n    write(temp_char, '(I10)') diff_val_abs\n\n    temp_char_trimmed = trim( adjustl(temp_char ))  ! gets the digits as string\n\n    s_diff(len_sdiff +1: len_sdiff + len_trim(temp_char_trimmed) ) = trim(temp_char_trimmed)\n\n    len_sdiff = len_sdiff + len_trim(temp_char_trimmed)\n\nend do\n\nThus this builds the s_diff string.\n\nAlternatively, a better way, but for now proceed in mind.\n\nOnce s_diff is built.\n\nThen check: if the original n was 2 (from input). Wait, n was read as input. So the code says:\n\nif (n ==2 )\n\nthen print s_diff(1:1). Because when n=2, the difference string has length 1. So the first character of s_diff is directly printed.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, check whether s_diff contains at least one '1' character. \n\nIn Fortran, to check if a given character exists in a string.\n\nWe can loop through each character of s_diff and see if any is '1'.\n\nSo:\n\nlogical :: found_1 = .false.\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s_diff)\n\n    if ( s_diff(i:i) == '1' ) then\n\n        found_1 =.true.\n\n        exit\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, proceed:\n\nif (found_1) then\n\n    result_val = cal(s_diff, '1')\n\nelse\n\n    result_val = cal(s_diff, '2') *2 \n\nend if \n\nthen print result_val.\n\nWait, in the Java code the second case is cal('2') *2. So in Java, cal(s, '2') returns an integer (0 or1) and *2.\n\nThus the output would be 0 or 2.\n\nWait possible?\n\nFor example, in the second case, the code says to print cal(...) multiplied by 2.\n\nThus in Fortran code, the equivalent would be called as result = cal(s_diff, '2') *2.\n\nNow, translating the entire process.\n\nNow, compiling all this into code.\n\nBut first, the Fortran function cal must be a user-defined function which takes two arguments: a string and a character, returns an integer.\n\nThe main steps in code flow:\n\nMain program:\n\nread n and the input string.\n\nif n ==2:\n\n    build the one-character difference string and print its first character (the single one).\n\nElse:\n\n    build the difference string.\n\n    check if '1' exists in it.\n\n    call cal and decide.\n\nThen, output the required value.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nProgram AGC043_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=200) :: s_initial, s_diff\n\ninteger :: n, initial_length, i,diff_val_abs\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: temp_char\n\nlogical :: found_1\n\n!

In the loop for building s_diff, the code tries to initialize s_diff as a space or empty. In fortran, when you assign s_diff=' ', it has spaces. But when building by appending, the first character can be added via substrings, but need to make sure.\n\nWait code:\n\nInitially s_diff is set to ' ', then s_diff = trim(s_diff). \n\nWait, maybe the loop should be:\n\nstart with s_diff as a zero-length string.\n\ns_diff = ''\n\nthen for each difference:\n\ntemp_part = string version of the difference.\n\ns_diff = s_diff // temp_part\n\nThus in code:\n\ninitial_length=len_trim(s_initial)\n\ns_diff = ''\n\ndo i=2, initial_length\n\n    ... \n\n    temp_char is the string of the diff_val_abs, which after trimming is 1 to ... characters.\n\n    s_diff= s_diff // trim(adjustl(temp_char)) \n\nend do\n\nThus, the s_diff will be the concatenation of the differences' string representations.\n\nWait also in the loop for the differences, in the fortran code.\n\nWait also, in the example where the difference is 2, the write statement writes '2' followed by spaces (since it's wide). Using adjustl removes the leading spaces, so a number like 0 would be '0', but numbers like 12 would be '12' etc. That should work.\n\nHence, that part should work.\n\nChecking another point: in the cal function:\n\nthe bitwise `iand(m,j) ==j` is the condition. So, in fortran's calculated j=i-1 (where i is loop index from1 to n).\n\nYes.\n\nNow testing edge cases like when n=2.\n\nFor example input 2 and s = \"ac\", the difference is '2' (chr(99)-chr(97) is 2?), so the output is '2'\n\nAnother case with no '1's: suppose the difference string is \"2\", then it would return cal(s_diff, '2') *2.\n\ncal(\"2\", '2') mean:\n\nThe string length is 1. n is 1, m=0 (since n=1, m=0).\n\nfor i from 1 to 1:\n\ni=1 \u2192j=0.\n\ncheck s(1:1) == '2'? yes.\n\nThen check if iand(m=0, j=0) =0 ==0 \u2192 yes.\n\nTherefore ans starts as 0 \u2192 after XOR with 1 becomes 1.\n\nSo cal returns 1 \u2192 multiplied by 2 gives 2.\n\nThus output is 2.\n\nAnother case, for input having \"10\", the code may work?\n\nNow, compiling possible fixes or errors:\n\nIn the main program, the variables declarations.\n\nReads n and s_initial. The s_initial may be up to n length, but declared as len=200.\n\nThe s_diff is also len=200. But since the differences can be multi-digit, the s_diff length could be up to (n-1)*some_max (differences up to 255 (like 'a' to 'z', etc.)), but with fortran strings being fixed length variables, using the 'adjustl' would leave space in the variable. Thus using a large enough buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps initial_length for s_diff may not be concise, but with a large enough declared length, it should work.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, when concatenating strings:\n\n' ' // a string would contain prior space? No, if trimming.\n\nWait in code:\n\ns_diff starts with ''\n\nthen first iteration:\n\ns_diff is ''\n\ntemp_char is the difference's value (e.g. \"5\"), after trimming, becomes \"5\", then s_diff = '' // \"5\" \u2192 '5'.\n\nSecond iteration, the new value is s_diff (now \"5\") concatenated with the next part, like \"3\" becomes \"53\", etc.\n\nThus, this should be okay.\n\nThe loop where checking for '1' is in the s_diff, and loop i from 1 to len_trim( s_diff ) to check each character.\n\nPotential issue:\n\nThe use of `IAND` and `IEOR` requires that j and m are integers. Since j is defined as integer, which they are when declared in the loop.\n\nThe function cal is defined within the program unit, via the 'contains' clause, so it can be called.\n\nNow, code syntactic issues.\n\nIn the cal function's code:\n\nThe 'function cal' is defined with 'intent(in)' for parameters, and returns the function value via cal variable.\n\nWait in fortran, the syntax is:\n\nFUNCTION cal(s,c) RESULT(result)\n\nOR,\n\nFUNCTION cal(s,c)\n\n but proceed to assign to the function name.\n\nThe given code uses 'integer FUNCTION cal(s,c)' which in the code above:\n\n  integer FUNCTION cal(s,c)\n\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: s\n\n    character(len=1), intent(in) :: c\n\n    integer :: i,j, ans, n, m\n\n    n = len_trim(s) \n\n    m =n-1 \n\n    ans =0\n\n    do i=1,n\n\n      j= i-1\n\n      if ( (s(i:i) ==c ) .and. ( iand(m,j) == j ) ) then \n\n         ans = ieor(ans,1)\n\n      end if\n\n    end do\n\n    cal=ans\n\n  end function cal\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nPotential issues left:\n\nWhen appending the temp_char parts, to ensure that we properly assign to s_diff.\n\nWait in the loop:\n\ns_diff = trim(s_diff) // trim(temp_char)\n\nBut using 'trim' the strings ensures that leading blanks are removed from both parts. So that when the partial s_diff has trailing spaces from previous steps, which would turn into blanks instead of considering as parts of the string.\n\nSo the code should use:\n\ns_diff = trim( s_diff ) // trim( temp_char )\n\nBut in the case where temp_char is ' 12 ', after adjustl and trim, it's '12', but when converting via a write, perhaps the temp_char is just written with enough space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to first take the trim of the temp_char. \n\nAlternatively, in the code block for building differences:\n\nUpon computing diff_val_abs, and writing to temp_char, for a number such as 10, the write with '(I10)' would give '           10' (leading spaces before 10?), then adjustl would make it '10          ', not:\n\nWait no: The write to temp_char with format '(I10)' will write as right-justified. So for 10, in I10: it writes as '         10' (leading spaces, then '10'). The adjustl moves the non-blank parts to the left, so trim(adjustl(temp_char)) would give '10'.\n\nWait adjustl(temp_char) would place the non-space part at the left, so for example '     10' becomes '10     ', but then trim removes trailing? Wait no, TRIM removes trailing blank characters, not leading.\n\nAh yes: adjustl packs leading blanks. For example, if temp_char was '     10', then adjustl( temp_char ) becomes '10     ' (with trailing blanks). Trim would take out the trailing blanks after the '10' ?\n\nNo, trim only trims trailing blanks (characters after the last non-blank in the string).\n\nThus trimming adjustl(temp_char) is redundant. Because adjustl has already moved the data to the left.\n\nThus:\n\ntemp_part = trim( adjustl( temp_char ) )\n\nbecause if the write has leading spaces, adjustl pushes them before.\n\nAlternatively, no. Wait, if the write outputs a field filled with blanks except the number, like for number 5: the write would be \"          5\", so adjusting left becomes \"5         \", then trim would give '5'.\n\nThus, to convert any number to its string version without leading or trailing spaces, use:\n\nwrite(temp_char, '(I0)') diff_val_abs.\n\nWait I0 is an intrinsic format which does not pad.\n\nThus, in write (temp_char, '(I0)') diff_val_abs \u2192 writes the number as its shortest string, without leading spaces.\n\nYes, it's better to do that.\n\nThus, changing the code:\n\nreplace '(I10)' with '(I0)'.\n\nThen, temp_char would have the numeric string, so trim( adjustl ... ) is not needed. Just:\n\nwrite(temp_char, '(I0)' ) diff_val_abs\n\nthen s_diff = s_diff // temp_char.\n\nWait waiting for possible overwriting.\n\nWait temp_char is a variable of length 20, so after writing, the rest of the characters are spaces, but the '//' operator picks only the characters without the trailing spaces?\n\nWait no: in Fortran, when you do cat = 'a' // 'b   c'\n\nthen cat is 'ab   c'.\n\nThe Write statement:\n\nwrite(temp_char, '(I0)') will place the characters starting at the first character, but the rest may have spaces. Hence to avoid it, we need to take the trim of temp_char ?\n\nAlternatively assign temp_str the trimmed form.\n\nWait no, the write statement using (I0) will write the exact digits without leading blanks. The temp_char is size 20, so the numbers like 12 would take 2 characters. So the trailing spaces after would remain, so:\n\nFor diff_val_abs=12 \u2192 the temp_char becomes '12 followed by 18 spaces. \n\nWhen concating to s_diff:\n\ns_diff is '5' (from first iteration) \u2192 then becomes '512       ...' which is 3 chars. So the rest is spaces, but when concatenated, the s_diff will have these. However, when processing s_diff for checking the '1's, it is done using len_trim(s_diff), so the trailing blanks are ignored. Thus the code is okay.\n\nTherefore, in writing to temp_char (20-length), after writing with (I0), the rest are spaces, but when appending, those spaces are not part of the string because the next use of 'trim(s_diff)' is not done. Wait, no:\n\nIn the code the 's_diff = s_diff // temp_char' appends all 20 chars? No, in fortran when you concatenate a string, the resulting's length is min, but not sure.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you have s_diff declared as len=200, and you do s_diff = s_diff // temp_char, then the resulting s_diff variable will have the concatenation up to its length.\n\nThus, to be precise, we should use trim first. Or use only the part that is significant.\n\nAlternatively to store temp_part as the numeric string without the trailing blanks.\n\nAlternatively to store:\n\ntemp_str = trim( adjustl( temp_char ) ) \u2192 which for the write with I0, the temp_char doesn't have leading blanks except in case of...\n\nWait write to temp_char (20 chars) with I0: the digits are placed starting at the first character, so the value 12 will have '12' in the first two characters, followed by 18 spaces. Thus trim on the temp_char is needed?\n\nNo, trim only looks for trailing blanks. So the trim(temp_char) would give '12          ...' (since leading blanks are not considered). Wait: trim() removes trailing blanks (trailings spaces after last non-space) but leading spaces stay.\n\nThus, in this case '12' with trailing spaces: TRIM(temp_char) would be '12          ...', which still has leading spaces? No:\n\nTRIM removes only the trailing blanks. So the actual data '12' is in the first two positions, trailing spaces remain. Wait, for example:\n\ntemp_char is '12       ' (first two characters are '12', then spaces, etc), so trim would truncate the string at the first non-trailing space? Yes: trim leaves the leading spaces but removes trailing ones.\n\nAh, that's not good. So the temp_char has leading non-spaces followed by spaces.\n\nWait the TRIM function removes trailing blanks.\n\nThus, after writing using (I0), temp_char is '12 segu\u00cddos por espacios', so trim(temp_char) is the same as temp_char, since the 12 are the first two chars followed by spaces, which are trailing after 12.\n\nWait thus TRIM would remove those trailing, so for 12: it would leave '12', because the trailing blanks are after the '2'.\n\nYes, so TRIM( temp_char ) would give a string with the digits followed by no spaces. Thus, the length would be the length of the numeric string.\n\nThus:\n\ntemp_str= trim( write_result )\n\nThus the code needs to do:\n\nwrite(temp_char, '(I0)' ) diff_val_abs\n\ntemp_char_trimmed = trim(temp_char)\n\nthen append s_diff using:\n\ns_diff = s_diff // temp_char_trimmed\n\nThis would avoid trailing spaces.\n\nThus, in code:\n\n in the loop:\n\n  write(temp_char, '(I0)' ) diff_val_abs \n\n  temp_char_trimmed = trim(temp_char)\n\n  s_diff = s_diff // temp_char_trimmed \n\nThus this appends the correct textual representation of the difference.\n\nNow coding this.\n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow, also note that in the case when n is 1? Well, according to the problem constraints, but in the code it's written that in the Java code, the loop is from i=1 to i < n. If n is 1, that loop won't process anything, so the string builder is empty. Then, if n ==1, the code would have s being the empty string, which can't be processed. But perhaps the problem's constraints requires n>=2.\n\nThus, assuming the problem constraints ensure n\u22652. Hence, the code should be okay.\n\nNow putting all that into the final code.\n\nFinal note: the original Java code uses sb.toString(). which in fortran s_diff will be the concatenated string.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nNow introducing the full Fortran code with corrections.\n\nAlso, in the case when n=2, the computation:\n\ndiff_val_abs is computed as abs(ichar(s_initial(2:2)) - ichar(s_initial(1:1))).\n\nThen converting to char with 48 + value.\n\nWait that approach is the 'short path' for single-digit differences.\n\nBut when the difference could be two digits? For example:\n\ns_initial is 'aA' \u2192 the difference's ASCII is 32 \u2192 need to make '32'.\n\nIn the n==2 branch:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\ns_diff(1:1)=CHAR( IABS(...) +48)\n\nBut if the difference is 32 \u2192 ASCII of 80 (48 +32 =80 \u2192 'P'), which is wrong.\n\nAh, this is an error in the code.\n\nOh right! A big mistake there.\n\nWhen n==2, the code's path is:\n\n    s_diff(1:1) = char( iabs(ichar(s_initial(2:2)) -ichar(s_initial(1:1)) ) +48 ) \n\nThus, the ASCII of the difference plus 48 is stored as a single character. If the difference is >9, the code is wrong. because 10 would give 58 (ASCII 58 is ':'), but the correct value is '10', but stored as a single character, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, this is a mistake.\n\nThis is a big issue.\n\nThus, the code for the n=2 case must build the difference correctly, like the general code.\n\nThus the code's the n==2 path must compute the difference string as the string representation of the difference, which may be over a single character.\n\nThus, fix this.\n\n instead of assuming a single character:\n\n the case when n==2:\n\n difference_val = abs( ichar(s_initial(2:2)) - ichar(s_initial(1:1))\n\n write(temp_char, '(I0)' ) difference_val\n\n temp_trimmed = trim( temp_char )\n\n s_diff = temp_trimmed \n\n (then print the s_diff which may be '10' for example, and the length is 2, so outputting the first character is wrong, because the '1' is first character and '0' second?\n\n Wait wait the problem code says \"if n ==2 {\n\n    out.println( sb.charAt(0) ); return;}\n\nThus the difference string has length (n-1)=1 (since Java's n was the length of the original string. So in the case, if the input is original length 2, the difference is one value, which would be a one-character string. Thus the difference must be between 0 - 255 (ASCII differences), but coding it as a character with ASCII code may be wrong because differences >9 give non-digit characters, but the code in the problem's java code uses the original method of appending the Math.abs(...) as an integer.\n\n Ah, the 'append' in the code appends the string form of that integer.\n\nHence, in Java:\n\nwhen n is 2, the sb will have one character - which is the string representation of ( difference val ).\n\n thus, the first character is it.\n\nBut for difference_val of 32 \u2192 the string is \"32\", so its length is 2, which is different from what the code currently suggests?.\n\nWait no:\n\nn is the original string length.\n\nIf the input is original length 2 (n=2):\n\nthe initial loop will make:\n\ni runs from 1 to 1 (since for(i=1; i <2; ... \u2192 loops once.\n\n for i=1, it appends Math.abs(s[1] -s[0]), which is the difference between the two characters. The difference is stored as \"32\", then the sb will have length 2 in this case; thus the code then writes sb.charAt(0) (the first character '3'), which is wrong?\n\n Wait bug in the Java code? Or my assumption?\n\nWait no: in code when n=2, the loop runs for i=1 to (2) -1, since the loop is i <n \u2192 for n=2: 1 <2 \u2192 yes \u2192 the loop runs once.\n\nThus the String is built as one character if the difference is single-digit, but for differences over 9, it's two characters (but then the length would be 2?).\n\nBut the code in Java says:\n\n    if(n==2) {\n\n        out.println(sb.charAt(0));\n\n    }\n\nso, for difference of 10, the sb would be \"10\", and the code prints the first character '1'.\n\n which is wrong. \n\nBut this is possible that the problem's code is wrong? Or is there an error in my understanding.\n\nAh, the problem's conditions must have the input such that for n==2, the difference is a single digit?\n\nUnlikely. So perhaps the original code has a bug here, but maybe not, because the code in the problem may have a different treatment.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the loop for the difference string is not allowed for 2: but in code, for n=2, the difference string's length is 1, but when waiting for two characters. wait I'm getting confused.\n\nWait the code when n is 2:\n\nThe generator loop:\n\n    for (int i=1; i <n; i++) { // loops once (i=1 when n=2). \n\nEach iteration appends ' Math.abs( ... ) as an int. which leads to 1 numerical value. Thus, the resulting string has length equal to the # of digits in the difference's absolute value.\n\nThus when difference is 32, the string is \"32\", length 2. \n\nThus in the case when n=2 the code writes s_diff(0), which would be the first character (O), and effectively giving an incorrect result. \n\nThis suggests a bug in the Java code.\n\nTherefore there must be a mistake in the problem code?\n\nOR my entire misunderstanding.\n\nWait but the original Java code says: the code is given for problem AGC043_B. I may be misapproched the code.\n\nLooking directly, the user provied this code. So assuming that the code is correct as per the problem, then perhaps when n is 2, the code prints the first character of the string, which is OK when it is length 1 or more.\n\nBut that could be an error. For example:\n\n Sample test case: Input \"3\" and \"a a\", which would have differences between 'a'(97) and (space)(32) \u2192 65, then between (space)(32) and the third character. But no, n=3 characters: let's pick \"az\", so n=2:\n\nn=2, s is \"az\".\n\nThe difference between 'a' (97) and 'z' (122) is 25 \u2192 difference string '25'. The code's output will be the first character ( '2' ), \n\nthen when the code proceeds (because 2\u22601?), then runs cal on \"25\", which does not contain '1', thus it computes cal(\"25\",'2')*2.\n\nBut in the problem solution, that's what the code does. \n\nThe code's approach is correct?\n\nWell, since I must translate the given JAVA code, including this potential bug (if it is), into Fortran.\n\n Thus, in the Fortran code for n=2, the code must build a string correctly.\n\nTherefore in the case when n is 2:\n\n the code should build the difference string as the textual representation of the difference. Thus:\n\nThus the correction is:\n\nin the case of n==2, the code can compute like the other paths, then proceed:\n\n   difference:\n\n compute the difference between the two characters, create the string as per the build process (so the difference string has the proper text representation of the difference value.\n\n Then, as the code would print the first character of the difference string (which may be longer than 1), which may not be the desired.\n\nAs in the Java code, the code for n==2 is to print the first character of the difference string, which is wrong if the difference is two digits.\n\nThis is a flaw in the Java code, but as part of code translation, translate it as-is.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, when n is 2:\n\n the code must compute the difference's string (e.g. 32 \u2192 \"32\"), and print its first character.\n\n Thus:\n\nThe original approach is not correct for multi-digit values, but in the Fortran code must replicate the same mistake.\n\nThus, code:\n\nif (n ==2) then\uff1a\n\n    compute the difference value:\n\n    diff_val_abs = abs( ICHAR(s_initial(2:2) - ICHAR(s_initial(1:1)))\n\n    write this integer to a string:\n\n    write(temp_char, '(I0)') diff_val_abs \n\n    trimmed_str = trim(temp_char)\n\n    s_diff_val = trimmed_str \n\n    then write the first character: \n\n    write(*,*) trimmed_str(1:1)\n\n thus, in fortran code:\n\n    compute difference_val_abs.\n\n    temp_char = '           '\n\n    write(temp_char, '(I0)') diff_val_abs \n\n    s_diff_str = trim( temp_char )\n\n    print '(A1)', s_diff_str(1:1)\n\n thus:\n\nthis will show the first character of the string, such as '3' in the 32 case.\n\nThus, this is as per the Java code.\n\nThus code's fortran for n=2 is:\n\n        diff_val_abs = abs( ichar(s_initial(2:2)) - ichar(s_initial(1:1)) )\n\n        write(temp_char, '(I0)') diff_val_abs \n\n        temp_char = trim(adjustl(temp_char)) ! to clean spaces\n\n        s_part = temp_char  ! the string of the difference characters\n\n         \n\n        write(*, '(A)') s_part(1:1) \n\nThus corrected.\n\nSimilarly, in the Fortran code.\n\nThus, that's the correction.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as follows:\n\n Now compiling all these fixes\u3002"
