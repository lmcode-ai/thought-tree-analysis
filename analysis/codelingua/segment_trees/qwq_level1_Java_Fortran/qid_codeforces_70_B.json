Hmm tricky. Wait in Fortran 90, when allocating, you can set lb=0 if you want 0-based arrays. But perhaps better to use 1-based. Wait the Java code's 'msgLength' is created with length input.length() /2. So the maximum possible elements in the array is half the input length. But the actual number of messages may be up to that, but idx variable keeps track of how many messages are actually stored. So in Fortran, we can use a dynamically allocated array with the initial size being max possible (half the input length), and track the idx variable similarly. Next, variables:\n\nint max = -1 \u2192 integer :: max = -1\n\ncount is initially 0 \u2192 integer count = 0, idx =0. Then the loop over each character in the input string.",

However in Fortran, since the loop is constructed as a while loop, perhaps we can handle the increments manually. Let's re-express the original for loop logic in pseudocode:\n\n       for (i from 0 ...):\n\n       for (i = 0 ; i < len; i++):\n\n         process char at i.\n\n         if ...:\n\n             do things that may increment i +=1 But in this case, the condition i++ is executed inside the loop. Wait no, in the code, the 'i' variable is the loop control variable.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. The Java program reads an integer n and a string. Then it processes the string to calculate something related to message lengths, and decides if it's possible to fit those messages into lines of maximum length n. If possible, it computes the minimum number of lines needed, otherwise outputs \"Impossible\".\n\nFirst step: parse the input. In Java, they use BufferedReader. In Fortran, I'll need to read from standard input. The first input is an integer n. The second is a string, which I'll need to read as a character array or a string. Since Fortran strings can have fixed lengths, maybe a character array is better. Let me think about that.\n\nNext, the variables. The array msgLength is of size input.length() / 2. The Java code initializes it as an array with length half the input length. Since in Fortran arrays are fixed at compile time, but maybe in this case the input's length can be determined at runtime. Wait, no. Fortran has array declarations that can sometimes be variable-length. Alternatively, perhaps I can allocate the array dynamically. However, in Fortran 90 and later, you can use allocatable arrays. So the plan is to first read the input string's length, then allocate the msgLength array accordingly as length divided by 2.\n\nWait, the code in Java first gets the input string, then sets msgLength's size to input.length() / 2. So in Fortran, after reading the input string, I need to compute the length of the string (using len_trim perhaps, if it's a character string), and then allocate msgLength as (len_trim(input_str)/2). Let me note that.\n\nLet me look at the loop in the Java code. The loop is over each character of the input string. The code tracks count, which is the number of characters before a punctuation. When it hits a punctuation (., ?, !), it increments count and stores it into msgLength. Then, it skips the next character (since after i++, which might be an increment beyond the punctuation?), So in the loop, after processing a punctuation, i is increased again, so the next iteration of the loop increments i again. Wait, maybe that's what's happening here. Let me see the loop step.\n\nIn the Java code's for loop, the loop runs for each i from 0 to input.length()-1. The iteration is controlled by the for(;;) structure. Now, inside the loop, when they hit a punctuation character, they do 'i++' after processing, perhaps to skip the punctuation? Or maybe to skip ahead? Let's look.\n\nSo the code:\n\nSuppose current character is a punctuation. So first they do:\n\nmsgLength[idx] = ++count; (Increasing count first, then storing). So count starts at 0, then increments to 1 if first?\n\nWait, the initial count is 0. So when a punctuation is found here:\n\nWait, the code starts with count =0. The code at that point, when it encounters a punctuation (., ? or !), then first increments count (before assignment?), since it's ++count.\n\nWait let's see the code line:\n\nmsgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\nSo ++count first increments count by 1, then assigns that to the array. So that implies that the count variable is the number of characters before the punctuation. Or perhaps this code is counting the characters before the punctuation?\n\nWait, the flow is: the code is going through each character. When the character is a punctuation, then the messages are separated by these punctuation marks. Let me think through the algorithm.\n\nI think the code is trying to parse the input into messages separated by punctuation marks. For example, if the input is like \"abcd.efg??h!\", then each message is between the punctuations. The first message is \"abcd\" with length 4, then after \".\", then between .? (maybe the next message?), or perhaps each punctuation is a separator between messages. Maybe each punctuation ends a message. So each time a punctuation is found, that signifies the end of a message. Each message's length is the count of characters before it (excluding the punctuation?), and then after processing that, they move to the next character because the punctuation is part of the message? Or perhaps the punctuation is considered as terminating the message, so the message length is count (before the punctuation is encountered). \n\nWait in the code, when a punctuation is found, then they first increment count (because it's ++count here) then store to msgLength. Let me see:\n\nSuppose before hitting the punctuation, the count is 5 (for example). The code says msgLength[idx] = ++count. That becomes:\n\ncount becomes 6, then set to the array. So that would be counting the punctuation as part of the message? Or not. \n\nHmm maybe the code is counting the characters before the punctuation. Let's walk through an example.\n\nSuppose the input has \"abc.\", then the code would:\n\nAt i=0, it's a, so count increments to 1.\n\ni=1: b same: count 2.\n\ni=2: c same: count3.\n\ni=3: character '.', which is a punctuation. So in this case, the code would do ++count (count becomes4) stored? \n\nWait, that would mean the message \"abc.\" has length stored as 4. Which includes the punctuation? Then that's probably not right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed to count the characters between the punctuations. Let me think of another example. Let's say input is \".a!bb.\", so:\n\nThe first position 0 is '.', so when the code is on i=0, it's a punctuation. Then count is initially 0. So ++count gives count 1. msgLength[idx] is 1. So that's the first message length ?\n\nHmm, this part is a bit unclear. Maybe the logic is that messages are separated by punctuation marks, and the length is the number of non-punctuation characters between the previous punctuation and the current one. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of the code's variables:\n\nInitially, count =0, max=-1, idx=0.\n\nFor each character in input:\n\nif c is . ? or !, then:\n\nIncrement count (so count was tracking previous characters since last punctuation), then store that count into msgLength[idx], then increment max if needed, then i is increased by 1? Wait, because of the 'i++'? \n\nWait, the loop is for each i, but after detecting a punctuation, the code does i++ again, so that next iteration skips the next character?\n\nWait no, the loop variable is controlled by the 'for (int i =0...' loop. So the loop increments i by 1 at each iteration normally. But inside the loop after detecting the punctuation, the code does an i++ which would jump to the next i.\n\nWait, the code is structured as:\n\nfor(int i=0...; i<...; i++){\n\n   ... code here.\n\n}\n\nInside, when a punctuation is found, the code does an i++. So the next time the loop runs the i will be incremented again, leading to effectively skipping a character.\n\nWait no, because inside the loop, after doing i++, the i variable is now i+1. Then when the for loop's step increments i by 1 again, that's an extra.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is looking for sequences where a punctuation is followed by another character?\n\nWait maybe this is a way to skip parsing the punctuation once it is found, to prevent it from being counted again. For example, when you encounter a punctuation, it marks the end of a message. But since the next character after the punctuation is part of the next message, you skip the punctuation in some way. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is processing the string as tokens separated not by just a single punctuation, but maybe two or something? Not sure yet. Maybe the original problem has a specific setup which the code addresses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the punctuation serves as a delimiter between messages, but the message is the preceding non-punctuation characters, and the delimiter itself is consumed and not part of any message.\n\nThus, each time a punctuation is found, the current count is added to the message length array. Then, after processing, we increment i to skip the punctuation, so the loop will process the next character in the next iteration.\n\nWait, let's see the loop steps again. \n\nOriginal code in Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {\n    char c = input.charAt(i);\n    if (c == '.' || c == '?' || c == '!') {\n        msgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n        if (count > max) max = count;\n        i++;\n        count = 0;\n    } else {\n        count++;\n    }\n}\nWait, wait. Let me recheck the code structure. In the code:\n\nInside the for loop, the code checks if c is a punctuation. If yes, then it first increments count (so count is increased), stores that into msgLength. Then, after storing, set max.\n\nWait: \n\nmsgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\nWhich increments (count by 1) and then stores that to the array. \n\nWait, the count was previous, so if before this was at some value, the count is first increased and then stored. Wait, that's a pre-increment.\n\nWait, in this case, before the 'if' clause, the count is only incremented if the character is not punctuation (else block's count++).\n\nWait no. Let me see: the code starts with count=0. Well, before the loop. Then, in the loop:\n\nFor each character:\n\nif it is a punctuation -> we process the current count:\n\nYes. Let's see:\n\nInside the 'if' (when a punctuation is found):\n\nFirst, they do: msgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\nSo the ++ is a pre-increment. So count is increased by 1 before being stored. Then, we do:\n\ni++; // increment i for skipping the punctuation?\n\nWait, the code may be trying to parse two characters, perhaps a message ends with two punctuations? Or perhaps the message is between two punctuation symbols, but I'm confused.\n\nWait the 'i++' is done right after the above statements. So after the i-th position (the punctuation), the code explicitly adds i++, thereby moving the loop's variable forward. \n\nSo when the loop proceeds, the next iteration's i will be i+1 again. \n\nWait, the loop's automatically increments i by 1 at each iteration as part of the for loop. So after processing a punctuation at i, the code is incrementing i by an extra one here, making that after the next loop iteration, i increases twice. \n\nWait let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the string is \"abc.\"\n\ni starts at 0 (position 0 is 'a' not punctuation). count becomes 1.\n\ni increments to 1 (for the next loop iteration?).\n\nWait:\n\nWait let's track step by step:\n\nFirst iteration i=0: character 'a'. Not punctuation, so count becomes 1. loop's 'i' becomes 1 in next iteration.\n\nNext iteration i=1: 'b' not punctuation, so count to 2. i becomes 2.\n\nNext i=2: 'c' not punctuation \u2192 count to 3. i becomes3.\n\nNow i=3, character '.' \u2192 the punctuation \u2192 entered the if clause:\n\nFirst step: \n\nmsgLength[idx] = ++count. count was 3 \u2192 here becomes 4, so that is stored. \n\nThen, check if max <4 \u2192 max becomes4. \n\nThen, i++ \u2192 so i becomes4. \n\nThen, count is set to 0. \n\nNow, the for loop's next step is to check if 4 is less than input.length (which in this example is 4), since the string is \"abc.\" which length 4. So 4<4 is false \u2192 loop ends.\n\nBut the idx increments by 1, so the msgLength array has this 4 (though that's odd?), because the message is three letters, then the punctuation.\n\nHmm this shows that the code is storing count+1 or something. Wait perhaps the messages here are being split based on punctuation, but each punctuation is part of the message's closing. So the initial message is \"abc\" with length 3, but the code here stores 4? That's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps there is an off-by-one error here. Wait, maybe the code is counting the punctuation as part of the message? Or perhaps the messages are being split between two puncuations?\n\nThis needs to be clarified. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nSuppose input is \"a.b\", length 3. Suppose n is 2.\n\nProcessing:\n\nWhen i=0 \u2192 'a': count becomes 1.\n\ni=1 \u2192 '.' \u2192 punctuation \u2192 then:\n\n++count (count becomes 2). stored in msgLength[0] \u2192 msgLength[0] =2 (assuming idx=0)\n\nidx becomes 1.\n\nincrease i to 2 (the +1 of the code's statement).\n\ncount set to 0.\n\nThe loop then checks i=2: then loop proceeds.\n\nNow character is b (i=2). It's not punctuation \u2192 count becomes 1.\n\nThe loop's next i is 3, so exit loop.\n\nThen, the msgLength array elements up to idx (1) are used. So first element 2, second (idx=1) perhaps? Wait idx was incremented in the code with ++idx when the index was 0 \u2192 so first increment makes it 1, so the next would be in the msgLength[1]?\n\nWait in this example, the message after the '.' is 'b', so the second message length is 1. But the code's loop may not have captured that?\n\nWait in the example \"a.b\", the loop steps after the first punctuation:\n\nAfter the first punctuation step (i=1), the code's 'i' is set to 2 (since the 'i++' added). \n\nThen the next loop iteration starts with i=2, enters the else clause, so count increments to 1 (from initial zero in the burglary after punctuation. Wait, after the punctuation processing, the code does count=0. So in that else case, count is incremented from 0 to 1.\n\nThen, next iteration, i becomes 3, so loop terminates.\n\nThus, the next message after the '.' got counted as 1 (the 'b'), so the code stored 2 for the first message (the 'a' + '?'), but that may be wrong. Let's see, the code does:\n\nInitially count was 1 (from 'a'), then when '.' is found, the code does:\n\nmsgLength takes count +1? Because ++count before storing. So the count was 1 (the 'a' characters), then the ++ makes it 2, so stored as length of the first message 'a' followed by '.' \u2192 which would be merged into 2? Like the message includes the punctuation? That seems possibly incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the messages are split between two punctuations, so messages are the letters between punctuation and the next punctuation. For instance, in the input \"a.b\", the first message is \"a\", and the second is \"b\". So lengths 1 and 1, which would correspond to:\n\nIn that scenario, when the first \".\", the current count (for the first message) was 1 (from a), so the code's storing ++count (so 2?), which is incorrect. Therefore, this suggests that the code is perhaps incorrect, but since the user provided it, I need to translate it correctly.\n\nHmm maybe it's a problem in how the code counts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that each message's length is the number of characters between two punctuation marks, with the punctuation itself not counted. In the example, \"a.b\", the messages are \"a\" (length 1) and \"b\" (length 1). So in the code's code, first, after the '.' at index 1, it increments count which was 1 to 2, stores that. Wait no, but then the second message would not be stored. Wait in that example, the loop after the '.' would then set i to 2. The next step is to process i=2 (the 'b'), which is not punctuation \u2192 count is 0 when starts, so count becomes 1. Then the loop proceeds to i=3 (end), then exits. There's no punctuation after that, so the second message's count (1) is never stored. \n\nHmm, so in the example \"a.b\", the code's output messages would be only one message of length 2 (a '.') but another message 'b' not recorded. Which would be wrong. There's clearly a flaw here. Alternatively, maybe my analysis is wrong. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the punctuation must be followed by another punctuation? Like two in a row? Or not sure. This code may have some logic I can't deduce in time. Since I need to translate the code correctly, I have to follow it as given.\n\nIn any case, I have to proceed with the translation.\n\nLet me start with the variable declarations.\n\nFirst, the Java program uses:\n\nint n = ... (from input). So in Fortran, I can read that as an integer variable. \n\nSecond, the input string is read. In Java, it's stored in a String input. In Fortran, I can read it as a character array or a dynamically-sized string. But for simplicity, perhaps declare a character string with a sufficiently large length, but the actual length can be determined using len_trim.\n\nWait in Fortran, to read a line, the intrinsic function 'input_line' can be used. Alternatively, using the read statement with an asterisk.\n\nLike:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=100000) :: input_str\n\nREAD *, n\n\nREAD *, input_str\n\nBut how to get the real length of the input_str? Maybe using 'len_trim'.\n\nAlternatively, in some versions, we can read until newline, but the second line is already read by the second read statement.\n\nAlternatively, use the 'g' format to read until end of line.\n\nWait perhaps in Fortran:\n\nAn alternative is to first read the value of n from user input, and then read the next line (the input string) as a string. We can do:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nread(*,'(a)') input_str\n\nBut need to handle the newline properly.\n\nAlternatively, read the second line with the maximum possible length.\n\nThe code will process the input_str's characters.\n\nNow, the array 'msgLength' in Java is initialized as new int[input.length() /2].\n\nIn Fortran, we can calculate the length of the input string as 'length = len_trim(input_str)'.\n\nThen, allocate the array:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: msgLength\n\nallocate( msgLength((length/2) ) )\n\nBut since in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, or may be 0-based with spec. Probably 0-based can be done by using 'dimension(0 : ...)'.\n\nAlternatively, we can make it 1-based, as Fortran arrays are 0-based unless specified.\n\nHmm tricky.\n\nWait in Fortran 90, when allocating, you can set lb=0 if you want 0-based arrays. But perhaps better to use 1-based.\n\nWait the Java code's 'msgLength' is created with length input.length() /2. So the maximum possible elements in the array is half the input length. But the actual number of messages may be up to that, but idx variable keeps track of how many messages are actually stored. So in Fortran, we can use a dynamically allocated array with the initial size being max possible (half the input length), and track the idx variable similarly.\n\nNext, variables:\n\nint max = -1 \u2192 integer :: max = -1\n\ncount is initially 0 \u2192 integer count = 0, idx =0.\n\nThen the loop over each character in the input string. The java for loop runs from 0 to input.length()-1, but in Fortran, the indices are different.\n\nIn Java, the characters are input.charAt(i) for i from 0 to length-1.\n\nIn Fortran, assuming the input_str is of length 'length': the characters are input_str(1 : length). So index from 1 to length.\n\nBut in the code, the equivalent loop in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(input_str)\n\n   ... process input_str(i:i) ...\n\nend do\n\nNow, need to track 'i' similarly to Java, but note that in the oracle's code, after a punctuation, the code does i++. So the same thing must be handled in Fortran.\n\nWait in the Java code, the loop is controlled by the for loop variable, but when it encounters a punctuation, it explicitly adds another increment. So in Fortran, this needs careful handling.\n\nPossible approach: The loop is step by step, but must manage the incrementing.\n\nOne way is to make the loop over each character, but with early exits for when you have to skip steps.\n\nAlternatively, track the loop variable i as an integer, and loop while (i <= len_trim(input_str)), but manually step through.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables:\n\nWe will have variable i starting at 1, initially.\n\nLoop (without using for loop):\n\ninteger i=1, ... other variables.\n\ndo while (i <= length)\n\n   c = input_str(i:i)\n\n   if (c is in {., ?, !}) then\n\n       process that:\n\n       msgLength(idx+1) = count+1 (since in Java it does ++count)\n\n       wait let me see:\n\n       In Java code:\n\n       msgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\n       So ++count \u2192 increases count first, then stores the value. The count before the increment is the previous count, so the new count is (count) is previous +1. Then this value is stored.\n\n       Also, after that, we set max to maximum if needed.\n\n       Then, the code does an i = i+1 (the i++ in java adds 1 to the loop's variable)\n\n       Because the loop's next increment is also going to add 1. So in effect, the code in java is moving i twice: once by the extra increment here, and once by the loop's step.\n\n       Thus, after processing the punctuation at i, the loop will move to i+2 (since the next loop step adds another iinc of 1 \u2192 1 + previous +1 \u2192 so combining the two steps leads to i being now that value.\n\n       However in Fortran, since the loop is constructed as a while loop, perhaps we can handle the increments manually.\n\n       Let's re-express the original for loop logic in pseudocode:\n\n       for (i from 0 ...):\n\n       for (i = 0; i < len; i++):\n\n         process char at i.\n\n         if ...:\n\n             do things that may increment i +=1\n\n       But in this case, the condition i++ is executed inside the loop. Wait no, in the code, the 'i' variable is the loop control variable.\n\n       Let me re-do the pseudocode for this part. The pseudo-code inside the for loop of the Java program:\n\n       on reaching a punctuation:\n\n          msgLength[idx] = ... increment count before storing.\n\n          max updated.\n\n          i = i +1 \u2192 this will skip the next character? But since the for loop's step will increase it again. So after processing, the variable i will effectively be incremented by two steps.\n\n       So, when a punctuation is found at position i (Java's 0-based), the code goes to i+1 (retroactively), then after the for loop's next step, it becomes i+2.\n\n       That effectively the next char i+2 is the next location.\n\n       Thus, in Fortran, to replicate that, when a punctuation is detected at i (Fortran 1-based), after processing, we must set i = i +1 (so that next iteration starts at i+1 +1 (the step ?)\n\n       Alternatively, since in a while loop:\n\n       So here's an approach:\n\n       Initialize i=1.\n\n       while (i <= length):\n\n          c = input_str(i:i)\n\n          if ( ... punctuation ) then:\n\n              ... do the count and increment, storing into msgLength and max.\n\n              then i = i+1\n\n              then: count=0\n\n              and in the loop, we have to also have the step here: since after the above, the next step is the next loop iteration.\n\n          else:\n\n              count = count +1\n\n          end if\n\n          i = i +1\n\n       end while\n\nWait perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait the Java loop does:\n\nfor (i = 0 ...){\n\n    ... code...\n\n    // if the punctuation case, set i +=1\n\n}\n\nthen, end of loop.\n\nSo after processing (i increases by 0 or +1), then the loop adds another i increment.\n\nSo the total increment per loop step can be 1 or 2.\n\nTo replicate that in Fortran:\n\nWe can write a while loop where each step:\n\nInitially i is 1.\n\nloop:\n\nc = input_str(i:i)\n\nprocess:\n\nif processing for punctuation, then i +=1 (because the ++ in code). \n\nthen, after processing, i is increased by another 1, regardless (because the 'i++' is the 'step' of the for loop).\n\nWait no. Let me see:\n\nIn the Java loop:\n\nInside the for loop body, after the code (including possible additional increments on i), after the body, the for loop executes the step of increasing i by 1.\n\nSo the detailed steps for each iteration:\n\n- set variables (only on first use)\n- check the condition (if i < ...)\n- if not, exit\n- execute body:\n   process\n   the code may add to i (i++)\n- then step: i = i +1\n\nThus, the net result of an i increment during the body is an extra increment, so total of i increases by 2.\n\nHence in fortran:\n\nloop i = 1, length (using a while loop):\n\ninitialize i to 1.\n\ndo while ( i <= length )\n\n   char = ... \n\n   if punctuation found:\n\n       msgLength, max handled.\n\n       i = i +1 \u2192 this is the code's i++ \n\n   else:\n\n       count +=1\n\n   end if \n\n   i = i+1 (the step)\n\nend do \n\nWait no, that would over-increment. Wait let me think again.\n\nWait, in Java's code, the loop step increases i by 1 each time. But in the body of the loop, after an 'i++' in the punctuation case, so:\n\nEach time the loop runs the code:\n\nbody runs then i +=1 (step)\n\nSo if in the body, i was already increased once, the step's increment by 1 causes i to have increased twice.\n\nHence, in order to replicate this logic, in Fortran's while loop:\n\ni starts at 1.\n\ncurrent i is the code processing.\n\nAfter processing:\n\nif it's punctuation case \u2192 we do i +=1 (in code)\n\nthen, after the loop's step (i +=1 again):\n\nbut since it's a while loop, we have to simulate the step ourselves.\n\nHmm. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in the while loop, we must simulate the step after processing.\n\nLet me try:\n\ninitialize i =1\n\nloop: do while (i <= total_length)\n\n  process the character at i.\n\n  if it was punctuation:\n\n    then, we have:\n\n      count = count +1 (if it's punctuation? wait, no \u2192 see in code.\n\n      Wait, let's analyze code again.\n\n   Wait in code:\n\n   inside the inner 'if c is punctuation: ':\n\n       first, the code does:\n\n       msgLength[idx] = ++count \u2192 count is increased by 1 first, the new value is stored. \n\n       So before this case, 'count' had the previous value (number of accumulated before punctuation). the message length is count (previous) +1, so the stored value is count+1.\n\n       then, after that, the code does:\n\n        max is set to max of max and count (which is now increased)\n\n        then, i is incremented by 1 (i++).\n\n        count is set to 0. \n\n   Then, after that, the for loop's step of i increment is done.\n\n   So in Fortran, after we handle the punctuation case, we should first do:\n\n   count = count +1 (because of ++count before storing?)\n\n   Wait, no:\n\nWait in java:\n\nmsgLength[idx] = ++count \u2192 first increases count by 1, then assigns that to the array.\n\nSo previous count is current value \u2192 which is how many characters were accumulated before the punctuation.\n\nThen, after this, adding count +1 (since the count was increased before storing).\n\nWait. Let me think:\n\nSuppose before encountering punctuation, count was 3 (from processing previous characters). the code does:\n\nmsgLength[...] = ++count \u2192 count becomes 4, stored. \n\nso the message length is 4, which is the count value (the count before increment was the previous accumulated sum of letters before the punctuation, but the code's logic here counts it as 4.\n\nHence, it counts the punctuation's count as one character. \n\nBut I'm getting confused again. But since I can't change the algorithm, I have to replicate the logic exactly.\n\nBack to the code step-by-step in the Java program:\n\nDuring punctuation case:\n\n- the previous count is the number of letters before that punctuation.\n\nthen the code does:\n\nmsgLength gets (count) increases by 1, then stored (so prev count+1).\n\nthe code requires that the previous count is the number of characters before the punctuation.\n\nThat's odd. So the message length includes the punctuation character?\n\nPossibly, but I have to proceed with accurate translation.\n\nNow, back to Fortran:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ni is current position.\n\nc is current character.\n\nif it's punctuation (., !, ?):\n\n   count has been accumulating letters before; so the message length is count+1? (because the code does ++count first, so previous count is stored as count+1.\n\nWait in the code's line: msgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\nThe value stored is count+1 (before increment). So the previous count was (let's say K \u2192 becomes K+1 stored).\n\nBut how did count get to its current value? Let see, the code's earlier steps:\n\nuntil hitting the punctuation:\n\nEach non-punctuation character increments count by 1. \n\nSo before a punctuation is hit, count counts the number of non-punctuation, sequence of characters leading to the punctuation.\n\nWait, but in the code's logic, count is incremented for each char that's not punctuation, and when a punctuation is hit, the count (after increment?) is added.\n\nWait:\n\nSuppose prior to punctuation, say the previous chars were all non-punct.\n\nFor example: three chars (abc), then a punctuation (.)\n\nCount would have been 0 \u2192 then each a,b,c increment it to 3. \n\nAt the punctuation's detection, ++count makes count 4, which is stored as the message length of that message.\n\nThus the message \"abc\" has a stored length of 4? That doesn't make sense. So there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count is counting the message length plus something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the message length is the number of non-punctuation characters between previous punctuation and current.\n\nThen when the code finds a punctuation:\n\nmessage length is count (the accumulated non-punctuation count). because we store ++count \u2192 but count was being incremented for non-punctuations. \n\nWait in that case, the count before incrementing would be the length of the message. So if the code has \n\nmsgLength[idx] = count +1 \u2192 that is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is storing the count+1 in the array, and I should read this with the current logic.\n\nThis is getting too tangled, but for code translation, it's necessary to transfer the code's steps exactly.\n\nIn any case, we proceed:\n\nInside the for (in Fortran's loop):\n\nWe have:\n\nif (character is punctuation):\n\n   then:\n\n      count = count + 1 \u2192 because the increment is pre, so it's equivalent to ++count \n\n      store this new count in msgLength array at position corresponding to the current index (idx).\n\n      then, compare to max and update\n\n      then, set max to max of the max and this count.\n\n      then, the Java code executes i++; \u2192 so in Fortran, increment i by 1 now. \n\n      Then, the count is set to zero \u2192 count =0.\n\n   else:\n\n      count +=1 \u2192 count = count+1\n\nThe loop variable i is then incremented as per the for loop steps.\n\nThus, in Fortran's code after handling that, the next steps are to increment i by an additional one when necessary.\n\nTo handle this in a while loop, I could do this:\n\nSet i =1\n\n loop:\n\n   character c = input_str(i:i)\n\n   if it's a punctuation:\n\n      count = count + 1 \u2192 equivalent to ++count.\n\n      msgLength element at idx is count \n\n      then msgLength( idx ) = count \n\n      then idx = idx +1 \n\n      if count>max \u2192 update max.\n\n      i = i +1 \u2192 so that we skip the next position (the one after the punctuation?)\n\n      count =0 \n\n   else \n\n      count = count +1 \n\n   end if \n\n   then, i = i +1 \u2192 this handles the loop step.\n\nend do \n\nWait no, but in this approach, the count could be correct in this logic?\n\nWait let me map through the example:\n\nTake the \"a.b\" example again with length3:\n\nThe steps would be:\n\ni=1: char is 'a'\n\nnot punctuation \u2192 count becomes 1.\n\ni becomes 2.\n\nNext step:\n\ni=2, char '.' (punctuation). \n\ncount is currently 1 (not yet added)\n\nInside punctuation case:\n\ncount is increment by ( ) \u2192 count becomes 2 (since it's doing ++count? \n\nWait no:\n\nWait in the code's case, in the code's code:\n\nthe code for the if clause:\n\nmsgLength got ++count stored in their code \u2192 so in Fortran code, it's count +=1 first (equivalent to ++count).\n\nso in the example at this point, previous count is 1 (from the 'a'), so first the count becomes 2.\n\nStore that to msgLength( idx).\n\nThen index idx is starting at 0? Or in Fortran arrays are 1-based.\n\nSo need to clarify.\n\nAh, in the Java code, the variables:\n\nInitially, count is initialized as 0.\n\nidx is initialized as 0.\n\nSo msgLength array is 0-based in Java, with an initial capacity of input.length/2.\n\nSo in Fortran, arrays can be 1-based, but to map index correctly, the Fortran code's array should be created with indices 1-based up to length/2, or use an offset.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, declare the msgLength array as starting from 0? Using:\n\nallocate( msgLength(0 : (length/2 )) )\n\nYes, perhaps this is the way to do it.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension( : ) :: msgLength\n\nallocate( msgLength(0 : (length/2) ) )\n\nThen, the idx variable is initially 0.\n\nThus, in the above example's calculation:\n\nAt punctuation case (i=2 in Fortran's 1-based index), the count before the increment was 1 \u2192 the code does count = count+1 \u2192 count=2.\n\nstore msgLength[idx] (where idx starts at 0) to 2. \n\nThen, idx becomes 1.\n\nSet i +=1 (from 2 \u2192 to 3, then the loops adds i +=1 to get 4, which exceeds the length.\n\nWait but next loop step:\n\nAfter the punctuation handling:\n\ni is set to 2 +1 (from the 'i = i+1') \u2192 i becomes 3. Then, after that, the loop does: i +=1 \u2192 becomes 4.\n\nThus, the next iteration won't process anything.\n\nThe message length array has first element as 2 (at index 0).\n\nNow, the next segment after the '.' is a 'b':\n\nBut i is at 3, which is beyond the input length.\n\nThus, the second message (the 'b') is not counted. \n\nThe code has a defect here, but the original code may have such an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java example, 'a.b' (length 3):\n\nJava code loop processing:\n\nAt i=0 (char 'a'): not punctuation \u2192count=1.\n\ni increments to 1.\n\nnext is i=1 (char '.'):\n\nprocesses it:\n\ncount is increased by 1 (from 1 \u2192 2), stored in msgLength[0], then:\n\ni is set to2 (because i++ \u2192 becomes 1+1=2, then the for loop step would add 1 again, making i 3 next step. \n\nso in next step, the loop checks i<3 (since length is 3 \u2192 i=2 <3 \u2192 yes.\n\nenter loop for i=2: char is 'b'.\n\nthis is a non punctuation.\n\ncount is 0 (after the previous set to 0).\n\nso, count becomes 1 (initial 0+1).\n\nthen code loops, increments i to 3. \n\nThe loop ends when i reaches 3 ? not less than 3 \u2192 loop stops.\n\nThus, the second message of length 1 is counted?\n\nWait now with this corrected.\n\nWait in Java's code, the when the code is in the punctuation case ( i=1 as per Java 0-based):\n\nthe code does i++ \u2192 incrementing to 2.\n\nAfter which, the for's step adds another i \u2192 making total of increment to 3.\n\nThus, after that, when we get to i=2 (Java's index 2 is 'b').\n\nAt i=2 (Java's 'b' character):\n\nsince it's not punctuation, increment count to 1 (previously set to 0 after processing the punctuation).\n\nThus, after loop completion, msgLength array entries are:\n\n[2 (for first message after the '.' is hit), and another at idx where?\n\nthe idx was 0 initially, after first message it is 1. but in this case, the second character is b, but since there was no punctuation after, its count is not stored.\n\nHence, the message length array has first element 2, but second not.\n\nThus in the 'a.b' example, msgLength has first element 2 (from the first message 'ab.?), and that may not be intended.\n\nBut assuming this is how the code works, I have to proceed.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the key points are:\n\nloop over characters, handle increments properly, and track count, idx, max.\n\n++\n\nSo for Fortran:\n\nStructure outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_70_B \n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n \n\n    character(len=100000) :: input_str\n\n    integer :: length, max, count, idx, i \n\n    integer, allocatable, dimension( : ) :: msgLength\n\n    real :: dummy \n\n    !

For each, it tries to merge as many consecutive messages as possible into a single line.\n\nFor example, current message is at position i. Then, we check if adding the next message's length (plus a space of 1?) can fit into n without exceeding. if yes, merge them and increment i, then check again with next.\n\nThus, each step merges consecutive messages as much as possible, and increments ans by 1 for each merged group.\n\nTo translate this into Fortran:\n\nIn Fortran, the loop is written as follows:\n\n            integer :: current, current_l \n\n            ans=0 \n\n            integer :: j =0 \n\n            do while ( j < idx ) \n\n                current = msgLength(j) \n\n                do \n\n                    if ( j+1 >= idx .or. current + msgLength(j+1) +1 >n ) then \n\n                        exit \n\n                    end if \n\n                    current = current + msgLength(j+1) +1 \n\n                    j = j+1 \n\n                end do \n\n                ans = ans +1 \n\n                j =j+1 \n\n            end do \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach:\n\nIn Java: \n\nint j =0;\n\nwhile (j < idx){\n\n    current_length = msgLength[j]\n\n    while( next is possible to merge)\n\n    then increment ans, skip to j until now.\n\nSo, the loop in Fortran can be:\n\n            do j = 0, idx-1,  increment variable?:\n\n                but have to loop step.\n\nWait, alternatively:\n\n        integer :: i \n\n        ans =0 \n\n        integer :: current_pos \n\n        i =0 \n\n        do while (i < idx) \n\n            current_pos = msgLength(i)\n\n            ans = ans +1 \n\n            !\n\n            ! try to merge with the next messages \n\n            do while (i < idx-1 ) \n\n                if ( current_pos + msgLength(i+1) +1 <=n) then \n\n                    current_pos = current_pos + msgLength(i+1) +1 \n\n                    i =i +1 \n\n                else \n\n                    exit \n\n                end if \n\n            end do \n\n            i =i+1 \n\n        end do \n\nWait, but I think in the initial setup, the first inner loop may better:\n\n            i =0 \n\n            do while (i < idx )\n\n                current = msgLength(i)\n\n                temp = current \n\n                while ( i < idx-1 )\n\n                        if( temp + msgLength(i+1)+1 <=n ) then \n\n                        temp = temp + msgLength(i+1)+1 \n\n                        i +=1 \n\n                        else \n\n                        exit \n\n                        end if \n\n                end do \n\n                ans +=1 \n\n                i =i +1 \n\n            end do \n\nHmm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me take the Java code and write it as:\n\nIn Java's code:\n\n for (int i=0; i < idx; i++) {\n\n    l=msgLength[i]\n\n    while (i < idx-1 and l+msgLength[i+1]+1 <=n )\n\n    \u2192 then l becomes l+msgLength[i+1]+1 and i is incremented \n\n    then ans increases by one \n\n}\n\nWait the loop does: \n\nfor (i=0... < idx) \n\nthen in each iteration, i may be advanced inside the inner loop. \n\nThe loop's condition is checked after each iteration, so when the inner loop causes i to be increased \n\nThus, the i in the for starts at current value, and may be increasing via inner loop steps.\n\nThus, it's a bit tricky in Fortran.\n\nPerhaps the equivalent approach is:\n\ninteger :: i=0 \n\nans =0 \n\ndo \n\n    if( i >= idx ) exit \n\n    current = msgLength(i)\n\n    ! then loop while can merge next \n\n    do \n\n        if( ( i < idx -1 ).and.( current + msgLength(i+1)+1 <=n ) ) then \n\n            current = current + ... \n\n            i =i+1 \n\n        else \n\n            exit \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    ans = ans +1 \n\n    i = i+1 \n\nend do \n\nWait:\n\nWait the outer loop progresses by i increments:\n\n Initially, i=0 \n\n check if can merge next message when possible.\n\n Then after merging the max messages possible, ans is increased once for each merged group.\n\n Thus, this seems similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the Java code:\n\nIn each iteration, the initial message is msgLength[i], and the inner loop keep adding next messages till their total plus 1 fits within n.\n\nThus, ans increases by one for each group formed.\n\nTo implement this flow:\n\nWe can initialize i to 0.\n\n then:\n\nans =0\n\ndo while (i < idx )\n\n   start = msgLength(i)\n\n   current = start \n\n   while( (i < idx-1) and ( current + msgLength(i+1)+1 <=n )) \n\n       current = current + msgLength(i+1) +1 \n\n       i =i+1 \n\n   end do \n\n   ans +=1 \n\n   i++\n\nend do \n\nWait but after the while loop inside, the i has been advanced.\n\nWait let me think:\n\nSample sequence:\n\nmessages [3,2,5]\n\nn is 5.\n\n First group:\n\n msg 3 \u2192 current is 3. Check next: 3+2+1 <=5 \u21923+3=6>5. So can\u2019t. thus, ans increases by 1, and i advances to 1.\n\nNext, i=1:\n\n message is 2. Check if adding next (if idx is 3).Suppose next is 5: 2+5+1=8? which exceeds n=5. Thus no, so ans increments to 2. i becomes 2.\n\n Then i=2 (last message 5>5? 5>5? no, 5 is equal.\n\n So groups are [3], [2], [5]. Total ans is 3.\n\nHmm but in this case:\n\nOriginal group:\n\n3 is the first message. Can it merge? No. \n\n3 and 2 \u2192 total 3+2+1 =6>5 \u2192 no. \n\nThus the total groups are 3 messages, so ans 3.\n\nSo in the code logic:\n\nthe first iteration (i=0):\n\ncurrent =3 \u2192 then check whether merged with 2:\n\n3+2+1 =6 > n \u2192 no. So the inner loop doesn't run \u2192 so I remains 0 \u2192 the code does ans increment and then set i =0+1 \u21921. Hmm, the ans becomes 1, then i increments to 1.\n\nSecond iteration starts with i=1. \n\nThe process same way \u2192 ans becomes 2 \u2192 and i increments to2.\n\n next iteration starts with i=2, and ans becomes 3 (ans=3), and i=3 steps to exit.\n\nThus code works.\n\nThus, in fortran:\n\nThe code for the ans would look like:\n\n    ans =0 \n\n    integer :: i \n\n    integer :: current \n\n    i =0 \n\n    do while (i < idx )\n\n        current = msgLength( i ) \n\n        do while ( (i < idx -1) .and. ( current + msgLength(i+1) +1 <=n ) )\n\n            current = current + msgLength( i+1 ) +1 \n\n            i =i+1 \n\n        end do \n\n        ans = ans +1 \n\n        i = i +1 \n\n    end do \n\nBut in this inner loop:\n\nafter merging, the i is being increased by each step. \n\nBut after the loop, we have to i +=1 to get out of the loop, so that the inner loop's merged messages are not counted again.\n\nThus this code seems correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, need to carefully track the code:\n\nNow putting all together:\n\nThe program's outline is:\n\n1. Read a n ? not a problem. \n\nBut care with fixed length.\n\nWait the initial read of the line after n?\n\nJava uses readLine twice.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nThe first line is the n value (integer). \n\nThen the second line is the input string. \n\nIn Fortran, the 'read' statements can be:\n\nAfter reading n (first line), then the second line is read for the string.\n\nThe following code should work:\n\nprogram codeforces_70_B \n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger :: n \n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: input_str \n\ninteger :: length \n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension( : ) :: msgLength \n\ninteger :: max, count=0, idx=0 \n\ninteger i, ans \n\nmax = -1 \n\n!\n\nread(*,*) n \n\nread(*, '(a)') input_str \n\nlength = len_trim( input_str ) \n\nif( length ==0 ) then \n\n    write(*,*) 'Impossible'\n\n    stop \n\nelse \n\n    allocate ( msgLength(0 : (length)/2) )\n\nend if \n\ni =1 \n\ndo while ( i <= length )\n\n    character(1) :: c \n\n    c = input_str( i:i )\n\n    if ( c == '.' .or. c == '?' .or. c == '!' ) then \n\n        count = count +1 \n\n        msgLength( idx ) = count \n\n        if( count > max ) max = count \n\n        i = i +1!++\n\n        count =0 \n\n    else \n\n        count = count +1 \n\n    end if \n\n    i =i +1 \n\nend do \n\nif( max >n ) then \n\n    write( *, * ) \"Impossible\"\n\nelse \n\n    ans =0 \n\n    i =0 \n\n    do while ( i < idx ) \n\n        integer :: current \n\n        current = msgLength( i ) \n\n        do while( (i < idx -1 ) .and.

Oh right. Oops. In the java code:\n\nit does msgLength[idx] = ... then idx++. \n\nAh, this is my mistake in the code.\n\nIn Java's code:\n\nwhen processing the punctuation case:\n\n msgLength[idx] = ... \n\nthen idx is increased by ++idx (i.e., the code does an increment of idx)\n\nThus in Fortran's code, current code is storing msgLength( idx ), then increasing idx by 1?:\n\nWait in the current code above:\n\nin the case a punctuation ?:\n\n msgLength( idx ) = count \u2192 then \n\nwithout increasing idx. \n\nThus, after processing that,_idx remains same.\n\nThus there's an error here. \n\nThis is critical. \n\nOriginal code:\n\nIn java's code:\n\nmsgLength[idx++] = ++count;\n\nSo in Java, the assignment is first stored to the current idx, then idx becomes incremented.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nWe must first store to msgLength(idx) , then increment idx by 1.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\n    msgLength( idx ) = count \n\n    ! Then, increment idx :\n\n    idx = idx +1 \n\nthen proceeds.\n\nSo, in the code's original when processing a punctuation:\n\nThe code does:\n\ncount = count+1 \u2192 the count is updated first \n\nthen store msgLength[idx] (current idx) as count.\n\nthen increment idx by 1.\n\nThus, the code needed this step.\n\nIn my previous code draft above, I missed incrementing idx. \n\nThis is an error I made.\n\nThus, in Fortran's loop for punctuation sections:\n\n        count = count +1 \n\n        msgLength( idx ) = count \n\n        idx = idx +1 \n\n        if( count>max ) then \n\n            max = count \n\n        end if \n\n        i =i +1 \n\n        count =0 \n\nThus, this corrects the increment of idx. \n\nWithout that, the idx will stay at 0 ever, and the message is not properly stored.\n\nThus the code's fixed++\n\nSo revising the Fortran code section for the punctuation case:\n\n          if ( c == '.' .or. c == '?' .or. c == '!' ) then \n\n            count = count +1 \n\n            msgLength( idx ) = count \n\n            idx = idx +1 \n\n            if( count > max ) then \n\n                max = count \n\n            end if \n\n            i =i +1 \n\n            count =0 \n\n        else \n\n            count =count +1 \n\n        end if \n\n        i =i +1 \n\n    end do (after loop)\n\nWith that fix, let's test the example \"abc!\":\n\nProcessing the '!' at i=4 (Fortran 1-based):\n\ncount was 3 (the previous chars are got to 3)\n\nthen count is 4 \u2192 stored into msgLength(0)\n\nidx becomes 1.\n\n then i is increased by 1 \u2192 at 4, then the loop's step does i=4 +1 =5. \n\n thus, the idx now is 1 (from initial 0 \u2192 now 1. So the first entry is written ot index0, then idx goes to 1.\n\n.\n\nAnother test:\n\n\u201ca.b\u201d\n\nchar 1: a \u2192 count=1\n\ni=2 \u2192 after increment.\n\nCheck at i=2 \u2192  '.' is punctuation.\n\n count was 1, after increment is 2 (count becomes 2). \n\n stored at msgLength(0 \u2192 since idx was 0), and then idx becomes 1.\n\n max now 2.\n\n then count resets to0.\n\n i is set to 2+1=3, then the loop increments to 4.\n\nLoop ends.\n\n i=4 which exceeds string length of 3 (if a.b is length 3: a . b \u2192 yes).\n\nThe count is0.\n\nThus, what about the 'b' after the '.'?\n\nWhen i was 3 (third character):\n\nthe character is 'b'? \n\nWait:\n\nInput_str was read with \"a.b\".\n\ninput_str(1:3) \u2192 positions 1:a, 2:., 3: b.\n\n inside loop:\n\nafter first iteration (i=1) \u2192 okay.\n\nAt i=2 (position2 is '.', triggers punctuation case.\n\nthe i becomes 3 (due to the first line's i=i+1 inside the punctuation clause.\n\n then, the loop's i +=1 leads to 3+1=4 \u2192 next step loops.\n\nBut at i=3 (the new i after the first processing steps?):\n\nWait let me re-step:\n\nProcessing the first punctuation:\n\n We are at i=2.\n\nAfter the code inside the punctuation:\n\n the 'i =i+1' sets it to 3, then loop's i +=1 sets it to 4.\n\n thus, next step: the loop's condition evaluates whether i <=3 (since length is3 \u2192 no.\n\n so the loop will not process i=3.\n\n thus, the 'b' at position 3 is not processed.\n\nThus the code will miss that.\n\nThus the message length is stored as 2 (count=2), so the first message thinks that includes the .\n\nThus the second 'b' would not be accumulated.\n\nHence, this is a bug in the code's logic. \n\nBut since this is the original code's behavior, We must proceed.\n\nOverall, with this correction in the fortran code's punctuation case (updating the idx variable), the code should be translated correctly.\n\nThus the final Fortran code:\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\nprogram codeforces_70_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    character(len=100000) :: input_str\n    integer :: length, max, count = 0, idx = 0\n    integer :: i\n    integer, allocatable, dimension(:) :: msgLength\n    integer :: ans\n\n    !

' \u2192 punctuation.\n\ncount is 0 before entering the punctuation case? (because previous count was 0? no, count was 1 from previous steps.)\n\nWait:\n\nRight after processing the previous non-punctuation:\n\nfor i=1 case:\n\n' a ' \u2192 count increases to 1.\n\nthe loop's increment sets i to 2.\n\nThus\uff0c proceduing to i=2 (\u2235 _.\n\nAt punctuation inside branch:\n\n count is 1 \u2192 count +=1 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\n stored as msgLength[0] =2 \u2192 _idx increases to1.\n\n max is set to 2.\n\n i is set to 2+1 =3, and then the i +=1 leads to 4.\n\n Thus loop ends.\n\n the character 'b' at position3 is not processed because i=3 is now 3 before the check.\n\nThus, the 'b' is never counted.\n\nThus, that\u2019s the same behavior as the java code.\n\nThis seems to be part of the original code's logic, which may have a flaw but it\u2019s just translation.\n\nAt this point, this should be the correct translation.\n\nThe remaining part is to handle the printing of 'Impossible' and the calculation of ans.\n\nIn the ans loop:\n\nThe loop for the ans calculation:\n\n i starts at0\n\n while i < idx:\n\n    current is msgLength[i], then merge with nexts.\n\n The current is msgLength's value for the i-th.\n\nThus the loop should be correctly walked.\n\nAnother example: with input of \"ab! cd? ef\"`\n\nSuppose the messages:\n\nThe punctuation are '!' and '?\u2019, separated by spaces? Or the messages are separated by each punctuation.\n\nThe code counts the messages between the punctuations.\n\nAnyway, the fortran is now corrected for the idx increment.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as written above."
