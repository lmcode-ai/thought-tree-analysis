For example, for columnsCount =3 \u2192 12/3=4 rows. So the columns have 4 characters each. But in the problem's case, perhaps the code just assumes the string is 12 characters which can be divided into columns of columnsCount when 12 mod columnsCount is zero. Wait since the loop in Java processes the problem when you call isSolution, then the \"solutions\" in the Java code only check when columnsCount is factors of 12? Because the problem requires. Wait the code's logic is for the codeforces problem, so the possible column counts are 12,6,4,3,2,1 as these are the factors of 12. Thus the code is correct.

But in the Java code, the solutions string starts with a space (so like \" 1x12 2x6...\" ), so the output in Java would be \"3  1x12 2x6 6x2\" (for example), where the first 3 is the count, then the space from the string starts. Wait that would be 3 followed by the entire string. Wait the Java code's print line:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);  // prints the count\n\nthen pw.println(solutions); Thus, the output is two lines? Wait no! Wait in Java code's loops:\n\ninside the loop:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\npw.println(solutions); So for each test case, output is first: the count (printed with print), then the newline after solutions is printed.

Wait if the three \"columnsCount=3\", then one column is good, then it returns true for that 3 case, so label '4x3' (since the count when columnsCount=3, then the \"4x3\" is printed.

Thus the code should be working. Thus the Fortran version of the code is as described.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. The main function is isSolution which checks if all possible columns in a certain configuration (with a given number of columns) have all 'X's in a string. The main program reads test cases and for each string, determines which of the possible configurations are solutions and outputs the count and the configurations.\n\nFirst, I should handle the isSolution method. Let's see. The Java method takes columnsCount and a string x. Then, it creates a boolean array allXs of size columnsCount, initializing all to true. Then, for each of the 12 characters in x (since the loop is 12 iterations), if the character is not 'X', it sets the corresponding column's flag to false. Finally, it checks if any column is all X's, which means any of the allXs is still true. Returns true if any is, else false.\n\nTranslating this to Fortran: functions as functions. Since Fortran doesn't have the same String handling, I'll have to think about how to represent the string. In Java, the string x is being processed as a 12-character string, probably because the problem mentions something about a 12-character input? Let's see the Java code uses x.length() after 12 iterations, so the input must be exactly 12 characters.\n\nFortran uses character arrays/strings, so in the function, perhaps I can pass a character(12) argument. The array allXs would be a logical array of size columnsCount, initialized to true. Hmm, initializing arrays in Fortran can be done via the (/ logical constants /) syntax, but maybe better to set each element with a loop, or using the SPREAD function? Wait, in Fortran, we can initialize all entries with logical parameters when declaring the array: maybe declare as logical allXs(columnsCount), and then set all to .true. with a loop? Although columnsCount is variable here.\n\nWait, functions in Fortran can accept an integer argument (columnsCount) and a character string (x which is length 12). The function would return a logical.\n\nSo first, writing the equivalent of isSolution as a function in Fortran:\n\nFUNCTION is_solution(columnsCount, x) RESULT(res)\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: columnsCount\n  CHARACTER(LEN=12), INTENT(IN) :: x\n  LOGICAL :: allXs(0:columnsCount-1) ! wait, in Java it's from 0 up to columnsCount-1?\n  \n  allXs = .TRUE.  ! Initialize all to true. Maybe using array syntax: allXs(:) = .TRUE.\n  \n  ! Loop over each character in the string (12 characters), index from 0 to 11? Wait, in Java the indexes are 0-based, but in Fortran strings, if you have x(1:12).\n  \n  ! The loop in Java runs for (int i =0; i <12; i++). So in Fortran, the characters are 1 to 12. So for i in 1 to 12:\n  ! Then, for each i in 1 to 12:\n  DO i = 1, 12\n     IF (x(i:i) /= 'X') THEN\n        ! The column is (i mod columnsCount). Wait, in FORTRAN, the modulo can return different values? Java uses i%columnsCount which is zero-based. For example, in Java, for i=0, the mod would be 0, columnsCount 12 would have 0 to 11? Wait in Java, the array allXs is 0-based with size columnsCount, so indices 0 to columnsCount-1. The columns are arranged in columnsCount columns? The x is arranged as columns. Maybe for Java's columnsCount=12, each column is a single cell. \n\nWait in the original code, the column is chosen as (i modulo columnsCount). Because in Java, for each character in x, it checks its position and seeing which column it belongs to. The loop then for each character, if that character is NOT X, then that column's flag is set to false. The end condition is checking if any column has all X's (so their flag is still set to true). \n\nWait but in the Fortran code, for the loop, the index variable i in the loop (over the string x) starts at 1 to 12. So in the fortran code, for each character's index, say i_char (1-based), then column is (i_char -1) mod columnsCount. Because in Java, i was 0-based, so i% columnsCount.\n\nWait let me see: in Java, for a given i (0 to 11), column index is i%columnsCount. So in Fortran, i_char is from 1 to 12, so the offset (i_char -1) would give 0-based index.\n\nThus, for Fortran, the column is MOD( (i_char -1) , columnsCount) \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the mod function might behave differently for negative numbers. Since (i_char-1) is 0 to 11, and columnsCount is always positive here (since it's passed as an argument from 1, 2, 3, etc.), MOD( (i_char-1), columnsCount ) will give the equivalent as Java modulo.\n\nAlternatively, using (i_char -1) // columnsCount ... The remainder would be the same as mod.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, for each character in the string (loop i=1 to 12):\n\nIF (x(i:i) /= 'X') THEN\n    column = mod( i-1, columnsCount )\n    allXs( column ) = .FALSE.\nEND IF\n\nWait, the allXs array in Fortran can be 1-based? Or declared from 0? The original Java has columnsCount as the size (0..columnsCount-1), so perhaps in the Fortran code, allXs is a 1-based array with size columnsCount, columnsCount elements from 1 to columnsCount. So when mod( (i_char-1), columnsCount ) gives a zero-based? That would give a possible mod value between 0 and columnsCount-1. Since 0-based column in Java's indices. So, the column index for Fortran would be mod( (i_char-1), columnsCount ) + 1. Because in Java it's 0-based, but in Fortran, the array for allXs is 1-based. Wait, confusing.\n\nWait let's think. Let's say columnsCount=12. Then the first character (i_char=1) becomes (0 mod 12) \u2192 0. So in Java that's column 0. But in Fortran, if allXs is 1-based (so indices 1 to columnsCount), then should the column be 0 +1?\n\nWait for the Fortran code, if allXs has bounds 0:columnsCount -1? No, Fortran arrays default to starting at 1, so to have 0 as the first element, they have to explicitly set the lower bound. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use 1-based. Let me see: Let's see the Java code's allXs is a boolean array of columnsCount elements, initialized to true. Then, for each char i (0-based up to 11):\n\n if (x.charAt(i) != 'X') then, allXs[i%columnsCount] = false.\n\nSo for columnsCount = 2:\n\nx has 12 characters, which are placed in two columns of 6 each (since 12/2 is 6 rows each). So each row has 2 columns, so first char is column 0, second column1, third column0, etc.\n\nWait for rows of 2 columns each?\n\nActually it might be that the characters are arranged in columnsCount columns, so the row progression is column-wise? Well, whatever the orientation, the code is checking whether any column has all its characters as X.\n\nSo each column's position is c = i mod columnsCount (Java's code). For i from 0 to 11, and c is between 0 and columnsCount-1.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, when we do (i_char -1) mod columnsCount (since i_char is 1-based, so subtract 1 to get 0-based), that gives a 0-based column. So in Fortran's terms, need to make sure the allXs array uses that 0-based, but arrays in Fortran start at 1 by default. So perhaps the code can have an allXs array of size columnsCount, starting at 0. Wait, but in Fortran, arrays can have arbitrary bounds. For example, dimension allXs(0: cnt-1), columnsCount is cnt. Let me think:\n\ncolumnsCount is known when we enter the function, so perhaps I can do this:\n\ninteger :: columnsCount\nLOGICAL allXs(0:columnsCount-1)\n\nWait but in Fortran, local arrays can be declared dynamic? Or do I have to pass columnsCount in the function and create a local array with the necessary bounds. Since in the function, when it's called, the columnsCount is given. So for example, in the function:\n\nFUNCTION is_solution(columnsCount, x) RESULT(res)\n  LOGICAL :: res\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: columnsCount\n  CHARACTER(LEN=12), INTENT(IN) :: x\n\n  INTEGER :: i, column_index\n  LOGICAL :: allXs(0:columnsCount-1)\n  \n  allXs = .TRUE.   ! Initialize all to true.\n\n  DO i = 1, 12\n     IF (x(i:i) /= 'X') THEN\n        column_index = (i-1) MOD columnsCount   ! (since (i-1) is 0-based index, mod by columnsCount)\n        allXs(column_index) = .FALSE.  ! Mark this column cannot be all X\n     END IF\n  END DO\n\n  ! Now check if any column is still all true:\n  res = any(allXs)\n  \nEND FUNCTION is_solution\n\nWait in the then-library function 'any' returns .true. if any element is true. So that works.\n\nWait that seems right. Then the Java function returns whether any of the columns are all X, which is exactly whether any element in the allXs array is still true, which is exactly what 'any(allXs)' returns.\n\nOkay, so the function translates pretty well.\n\nNow the main program.\n\nFirst, in Java, the main reads T test cases, for each, builds a string s, and checks solutions for each possible columnsCount.\n\nThe Java code does:\n\nSo the Fortran main needs to read T, then loop T times, and for each string s (12 characters), check the 6 possible configurations (12,6,4,3,2,1).\n\nThe problem for Fortran is to read the input. Let's consider: In Java, the code uses input lines. So for each test case, the line is a 12-character string (probably without any spaces? The problem says the input contains a single line with 12 characters). So in Fortran:\n\nFirst, we can read T using an integer, then read T lines of 12 characters.\n\nFortran uses read(*,*) for input. So what we can do is, read T with a read(*,*), then loop T times. For each line, read into a character variable s(12). Since each line is exactly 12 characters.\n\nWait in Fortran, reading a line of characters with a fixed length: So, for the string s, it's a character string of length 12, and can be read by:\n\nread(*,'(a12)') s\n\nAssuming that the line has exactly 12 characters. Or if there are trailing spaces or anything, but in coding competition setups, inputs are generally properly formatted.\n\nSo the main program steps:\n\nRead T.\n\nLoop T times:\n\n   Read a string s of 12 characters.\n\n   Determine which configurations (the 6 options) are solutions, building a string of the possibilities.\n\n   Then output the count followed by the formatted strings.\n\nThe Java code builds a string 'solutions' as a String, appending the possibilities in order 1x12, 2x6, etc., each preceded by a space. The order is checked sequentially, appending if the isSolution returns true for each case.\n\nFinally, it prints possibleSolutions++, but wait, the code in Java has:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\nAh, that's a bug in the Java code. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the Java code's main:\n\nThey have:\n\nint possibleSolutions =0;\n\nthen, for each checking of isSolution, if it is true, they append the string and increment possibleSolutions by 1.\n\nThen at the end, it does:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\nWait, the print is (possibleSolutions++\n\nWait that's a post-increment, So:\n\npossibleSolutions is printed first as its current value, then incremented by 1. But possibleSolutions already counts each time a solution is found. So that's a mistake here, because after all the checks, possibleSolutions is the actual count, but here by doing possibleSolutions++, they print, then add one more. So the output is incorrect in Java.\n\nWait wait, looking back at Java code:\n\nAfter all the if-statements, they do:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\nand then\n\npw.println(solutions);\n\nWait that's definitely wrong. Let me see the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\n...\nint possibleSolutions =0;\n...\nif (isSolution(...)) then increment possibleSolutions and append\n...\nfinally: \npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\npw.println(solutions);\n\nAh! The print of possibleSolutions is using post-increment meaning the value is printed first, then possibleSolutions becomes the value +1, but since that line is after the print, it would still be incorrect. Because possibleSolutions had already the count, so the printed value is possibleSolutions before increment. But the post-increment after the increment is done after the value is used. So let me think:\n\nSuppose possibleSolutions is 3 before the line.\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\nThis line will print 3 (the current value), then add 1 to possibleSolutions (to 4). \n\nWait, that's the problem. Because the count should be correct, but the code is adding an extra. Because when they do possibleSolutions++ inside print, the printed value is original, then possible gets increased again. But that's the code's mistake. Wait looking back to the Java code given:\n\nLooking at the Java code provided:\n\nfor the loop line:\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {\n            //...\n            if (isSolution(...))\n            //...\n            pw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n            pw.println(solutions);\n        }\n\nThe prints are within each iteration. The line is pw.print(possibleSolutions++); then the print line.\n\nAh, this is a bug. Because the ++ would add one. PossibleSolutions is 0, then, after checking conditions, possibleSolutions will hold the correct count, but then the print is possibleSolutions++, so the value printed is the original. Wait, no, considering possibleSolutions is an int set to zero. Let's suppose for a test case, possibleSolutions ends up as 2, because 2 conditions were true. Then the line:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++)\n\nthe ++ is a post-increment, so the value that gets printed is 2, then increments to 3.\n\nThen, the next line (pw.println(solutions)) will append as needed. So the count is correct? Wait yes. So possibleSolutions was whatever (2). Then the print statement prints possibleSolutions (2) Then the possibleSolutions becomes 3. But that's okay, since after the print, the variable is irrelevant. The bug is not there? Wait perhaps the code has that possibleSolutions is incremented by an extra? Wait no. For example, if all six are solutions, possibleSolutions is 6 after checks. Then the print is 6, and then it gets 7. But possibleSolutions is printed correctly because the post-increment happens after the use. So the code is okay? Wait maybe that's intended.\n\nWait the code is correct?\n\nWait in Java:\n\nint x = 5;\n\nSystem.out.println(x++);  \n//Prints 5. Then x becomes 6.\n\nThus in the Java code above, possibleSolutions is printed as the current value, then increases by 1. But that's unnecessary. Because after that line there is no use of possibleSolutions except in other test cases. So perhaps that is correct? Because the print statement (pw.print(...)) is correct because we just want to output possibleSolutions which is the current value before the increment. The ++ doesn't affect it here because the variable won't be needed again except in the next test cases. So even though Java's code is adding an extra ++ at the end, it's only affecting the variable (which is reinitialized in the next test case). So it's okay? Or was the code wrong?\n\nWait, the Java code's pw.println(solutions) must be printed, which is the string of solutions separated by spaces, like \" 1x12 2x6 ...\" which is built with the order they are checked. Which is correct, the possibleSolutions is accurate, the print of possibleSolutions is correct.\n\nWait so perhaps that was just a code style thing, but the code works. So for the Fortran code, I need to replicate the same logic.\n\nBack to main program:\n\nIn Fortran, input is read, but no cases for \"pbcopy the code\". Let me plan the steps.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- T: integer. To be read first.\n\nLoop T times:\n\n- Read s as a 12-character string.\n\n- Check for each of the possible configurations (columnsCount in [12,6,4,3,2,1 ]). Wait, the checks are in that order, but the order in the code is 12,6,4,3,2,1, so in Fortran code must check the same order.\n\nWait, in the Java main:\n\nThe code checks possibleSolutions as follows:\n\n- Check 12 (so isSolution(12, s)), if true adds \" 1x12\".\n\n- Then checks 6, \" 2x6\".\n\n- Then 4: \" 3x4\"\n\n- then 3: \"4x3\".\n\n- then 2: \"6x2\".\n\n- finally 1: \"12x1\".\n\nWait each of those checks has the columnsCount, but the label's first component is the number of columns? or rows?\n\n Wait the user probably for a columnCount of 12, the arrangement is 1x12 (like a single row of 12 columns, meaning the whole row's columns must be all x), but that is possible since a column here is length 1.\n\n So the possible solutions for each columnsCount c are:\n\ncolumnsCount is the number of columns. The possible formats are listed as \"a x b\" where a is rows?\n\nWait in the Java code, the label is for example, 12 columns \u2192 '1x12', meaning maybe arranged as 1 row of 12 columns. So it's row count multiplied by column. The row count would be total characters divided by columns?\n\n Since there are 12 characters, 12 divided by columnsCount must be exact? Because otherwise the columns would not form a rectangle.\n\n For example, for columnsCount =3 \u2192 12/3=4 rows. So the columns have 4 characters each. \n\n But in the problem's case, perhaps the code just assumes the string is 12 characters which can be divided into columns of columnsCount when 12 mod columnsCount is zero.\n\n Wait since the loop in Java processes the problem when you call isSolution, then the \"solutions\" in the Java code only check when columnsCount is factors of 12? Because the problem requires. Wait the code's logic is for the codeforces problem, so the possible column counts are 12,6,4,3,2,1 as these are the factors of 12.\n\n Thus the code is correct.\n\nSo for each columnsCount in those factors, the code checks if it is a solution.\n\nThus translating that to Fortran's code.\n\nIn the Fortran program, First, declare necessary variables.\n\nIn Fortran 90/95:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=12) :: s\n\ninteger :: possibleSolutions\ncharacter(len=100) :: solutions\n\nexternal is_solution\n\nread(*,*) t\n\ndo i = 1, t\n   read(*, '(a12)') s\n\n   solutions = ''\n   possibleSolutions = 0\n\n   if ( is_solution(12, s) ) then\n       write(solutions, '(\" \",A)') \"1x12\"\n       solutions = adjustl( trim(solutions) // \"1x12\" )?\n       \u2014 Hmm, how to append to the string.\n\n       \u2014 Alternatively, build a string with all the found solutions.\n\n       Wait, how to handle strings appends in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, strings can be concatenated with //.\n\nHowever, for dynamic appends, since the order is known, perhaps we can pre-allocate a string of sufficient length, and track where to append each part.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible number of solutions is 6, we can pre-allocate a character array of say 100 characters and build it step by step.\n\nBut let's think of code:\n\nInitialize solutions as an empty string.\n\n Then for each test, first set possibleSolutions to 0 and solutions to empty.\n\n Then loop through each of the 6 cases (columns in 6 possible values with their labels):\n\n Let's list them:\n\n The cases in order:\n\n- columns 12 \u2192 \"1x12\"\n\n- 6 \u2192 \"2x6\"\n\n-4 \u21923x4\n\n-3 \u21924x3\n\n-2 \u21926x2\n\n-1 \u219212x1\n\nSo for each of these in the code.\n\n For each case (columnsCount, label):\n\n    if is_solution then\n\n       add \" \" followed by the label to solutions.\n\n       increment possibleSolutions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndo ... \n\n   possibleSolutions = 0\n\n   solutions = ''\n\n   if ( is_solution(12, s) ) then\n\n       solutions = ' ' // '1x12'\n\n       possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1\n\n   end if\n\n   if ( is_solution(6,s) ) then\n\n       solutions = solutions // ' 2x6'\n\n       possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1\n\n   end if\n\n   and so on for 4,3,2,1. \n\nWait but initially, solutions is empty. The first case, if hit, will prepend with space? But first time, could be better to check if solution is not empty and add space.\n\nAlternatively, start solutions with a space, so that when adding the first label, it is spaced. Wait, for the first case:\n\nif the first condition (columnsCount=12) is true, solutions would be initially '1x12' with a leading space? Not sure. Alternatively, build the label strings properly.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsolutions starts as empty. Then, first time:\n\nif the test passes, add '1x12' to solutions (without leading space?), but the Java code's code had appended \" 1x12\".\n\nWait in Java code, the first append is \" 1x12\"\u2014 with a space before. So the solutions string starts with a leading space. Which in Java code seems okay, since in the output, the first character after the count will start with the space.\n\nSimilarly for each append here: each successful check appends a ' 1x12', ' 2x6', etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, the code would do, for example:\n\nif succeeded for 12:\n\n   solutions = ' 1x12' \n\nthen, for next test (6):\n\n   if yes, then solutions = solutions//' 2x6'\n\nand so on.\n\nSo in code:\n\npossibleSolutions =0\nsolutions = \"\" \n\nif (is_solution(12, s)) then\n   solutions = '12 1x12' \n   Oh, no. Wait the first would be:\n\n   solutions = \" 1x12\" -> with a leading space.\n\n so:\n\n   solutions = ' 1x12'\n   possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1\n\nelse if (others...)\n\nsimilarly, for each case, the code appends the labeled string with their own space first.\n\n Thus, the next iteration (checking columnsCount=6) would do:\n\n   if ( is_... ... then solutions = solutions // \" 2x6\" , etc.\n\nThus this way, each added string starts with a space and the label, so that when all are appended, they form \" 1x12 2x6...\" etc., as per the Java code.\n\nSo the Fortran code for each condition:\n\nsolutions starts as empty, then each successful check appends a ' label', starting with a space, followed by the label.\n\nThe final print would be first the possibleSolutions count, followed by the solutions string.\n\nBut in the Java code, after all checks are done, the code does:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\npw.println(solutions);\n\nWait but the Fortran code must output the count and the solutions.\n\nSo first write the count, then the solutions.\n\nHowever, possibleSolutions must equal the count (so no increment needed). The Java's code has the possibleSolutions incremented by the postfix, but in Fortran, just print possibleSolutions as is.\n\n Wait in Fortran, the code would be:\n\nwrite(*,*) possibleSolutions, solutions\n\nWait unless the solutions string includes a leading space. Which it does, so outputting the count followed by the string (possibly starting with space) would be okay.\n\nBut in the Java code, the solutions string starts with a space (so like \" 1x12 2x6...\" ), so the output in Java would be \"3  1x12 2x6 6x2\" (for example), where the first 3 is the count, then the space from the string starts. \n\n Wait that would be 3 followed by the entire string. \n\nWait the Java code's print line:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);  // prints the count\n\nthen pw.println(solutions); \n\nThus, the output is two lines? Wait no! Wait in Java code's loops:\n\ninside the loop:\n\npw.print(possibleSolutions++);\n\npw.println(solutions);\n\nSo for each test case, output is first: the count (printed with print), then the newline after solutions is printed. So the count is on the same line as the solutions string. \n\nThus, the total output line would be: count [solutions contents]. \n\nSo in Java, the code is:\n\npossibleSolutions is printed via print, then the solutions's string (which starts with a space) is printed via println (so adding a trailing newline). \n\nThus, the output line is the count followed by the spaces and the labels, with a final newline.\n\nIn Fortran, to replicate this, inside the loop over test cases:\n\n   after computing possibleSolutions and solutions, output as:\n\n   write(*, '(i0, a)') possibleSolutions, solutions\n\nWhich will write the count, followed by the solutions string (starting with space), and then newline with the format.\n\nThus the format is correct.\n\nThus in code.\n\nNow variables in Fortran:\n\nNeed to declare the variables.\n\nFirst, in the main program:\n\n declare t as integer\n\na loop variable i from 1 to t.\n\ns the string of 12 chars.\n\npossibleSolutions is an integer for each test case.\n\nsolutions: a character string variable. Since the maximum number of options is 6, each with say 4 chars plus space. 6 *5 characters (including space), plus a leading space: say ' 12x1' (5 chars with space). So max length 6*5=30 chars.\n\nSo declare as solutions(1:100) ? Perhaps 100 is enough.\n\nWait, Fortran strings \u2014 to allocate it as character(len=80) :: solutions ?\n\nBecause in the code:\n\nINPUT:\n\nThe main code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=12) :: s\n\ninteger :: possibleSolutions\ncharacter(len=80) :: solutions\n\ninteger :: columnsCounts(6)\ncharacter(len=14) :: labels(6)  ??? \n\nAlternatively, maybe hardcode the labels and columns in an order:\n\nWe need for each case:\n\ncolumnsCountarray: [12,6,4,3,2,1 ]\n\nand labels: [\"1x12\", \"2x6\", \"3x4\", \"4x3\", \"6x2\", \"12x1\"]\n\nThus, perhaps arrange everything as loops or inline:\n\nAlternatively, loop over all the cases:\n\n maybe:\n\ndo i_case = 1, 6\n\n   columnsCount = 12,6,... as per the order.\n\n   label = ??? corresponds.\n\n but in Fortran, using arrays:\n\n columnsCounts = [12,6,4,3,2,1]\n\n labels = (/\"1x12\", \"2x6\", \"3x4\", \"4x3\", \"6x2\", \"12x1\"/)\n\n Then loop over the indexes 1 to 6.\n\n But in Fortran 90, how to declare arrays:\n\ninteger, parameter :: ncases =6\n\ninteger, dimension(ncases) :: counts = [12,6,4,3,2,1]\n\ncharacter(len=5), dimension(ncases) :: labels\n\ndata labels / '1x12', '2x6', '3x4', '4x3', '6x2', '12x1' /\n\nAlternatively, with assignment inside:\n\n labels = [character(len=5) :: '1x12', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use an array for the counts and labels.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, handle each case individually. \n\nIn the code:\n\nInside the loop over each test case, do the following:\n\n possibleSolutions =0\n\n solutions = '' \n\n then:\n\n if is_solution(12, s) ... then\n\n solutions = ' 1x12', etc.\n\n so code like:\n\n if (is_solution(12,s)) then \n\n   solutions = ' 1x12'\n\n   possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions + 1\n\n end if\n\n then:\n\n if (is_solution(6,s)) then \n\n   solutions = solutions // ' 2x6'\n\n   possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1\n\n end if \n\n and so on.\n\n This might be the easiest approach.\n\nAlternatively, the loop approach:\n\n define arrays:\n\ninteger, dimension(6) :: cc = [12,6,4,3,2,1]\n\ncharacter(len=5), dimension(6) :: ll\n\nll(1) = '1x12'\n\nll(2) = '2x6'\n\nll(3) = '3x4'\n\nll(4) = '4x3'\n\nll(5) = '6x2'\n\nll(6) = '12x1'\n\nthen loop over 1 to 6:\n\ndo i=1,6\n\n   if (is_solution( cc(i), s) ) then\n\n      solutions = trim(solutions) // ' ' // ll(i)\n\n      possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nWait this would work, but perhaps the trimming after appending is necessary. Wait for the first case:\n\nInitially, solutions is an empty string. So for first addition, if the first case is true:\n\nsolutions = trim(\" \") // ' label'? Wait no, original solutions is \"\", trimming does nothing.\n\ntrim(solutions)//' ' // ll(i) \u2192 \"\" + ' ' + '1x12' \u2192 gives ' 1x12'.\n\nYes. Second time, for example, the next case, if that's true, the code would do: \n\ntrim(solutions) ( existing \" 1x12\") then add ' ' and '2x6' \u2192 \" 1x12\" + \" 2x6\"?\n\n No, trim(solutions) is \" 1x12\" (since no trailing spaces), so adding ' ' gives an extra space?\n\n Wait, the code appends a leading space every time, but when combining with existing strings?\n\n For example, when the first one is:\n\nSolutions is empty \u2192 trim(solu) is empty, added ' ' and the label.\n\nSecond one, when added, it becomes the previous string (now 5 chars) plus a space and label:\n\n\" 1x12\" followed by \" 2x6\" \u2192 \" 1x12 2x6\".\n\nThus, each new addition adds a space + label. So perhaps the first should be handled as prefixing the space. But this way, all cases are handled with the loop, so less code.\n\nSo that's perhaps better.\n\nThus code in main:\n\ninitialize cc and ll arrays for the counts and the labels.\n\nwithin each case loop:\n\n so code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: t\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=12) :: s\n\ninteger :: possibleSolutions\ncharacter(len=100) :: solutions\n\ninteger :: cc(6), icase\ncharacter(len=5) :: labels(6)\n\ninteger :: columnsCount\n\ncc = [12,6,4,3,2,1]\n\nlabels(1) = '1x12' \n\nlabels(2) = '2x6'\n\nlabels(3)= '3x4'\n\nlabels(4)= '4x3'\n\nlabels(5)= '6x2'\n\nlabels(6)= '12x1' \n\n...\n\nread(*,*) t\n\ndo i=1,t\n\n  read(*, '(A12)') s\n\n  solutions = ''\n\n  possibleSolutions =0 \n\n  do icase =1,6 \n\n     columnsCount = cc( icase ) \n\n     if ( is_solution(columnCount, s) ) then \n\n        solutions = trim(solutions) // ' ' // labels( icase )\n\n        possibleSolutions=possibleSolutions +1 \n\n     end if \n\n  end do\n\n  ! Remove leading space? Wait no, because the labels start with a space each. Wait wait\n\nWait in the loop, the first successful case would do:\n\nsolutions = \"\" // ' ' // '1x12' \u2192 \" 1x12\".\n\nThen next case would do (if any):\n\ntrim(\" 1x12\") is \" 1x12\", then append \" \" and \" next label\".\n\nso it's alright, the label is added with a space.\n\n Thus the solutions string has the correct starting space.\n\n Then, when possibleSolutions is 0, then solutions is empty string (since all cases are false).\n\n Thus, then:\n\n Write the output as the possibleSolutions followed by the solutions string (if it's non-empty). \n\n So the output line is:\n\n   if possibleSolutions>0:\n\n      write(*, '(i0,a)', advance='no') possibleSolutions, trim(solutions)\n\n   else:\n\n      write(*, *) 0 \n\n because then the solutionsis empty, so the solutions string is empty. But if there's zero solutions, then solutions is empty, so the line would print \"0 \" or?\n\nWait need to think.\n\nWait possibleSolutions is zero, then the write statement:\n\nwrite( *, '(i0, a)', advance='no') possibleSolutions, solutions\n\n would write 0 followed by the empty string, then without the newline (using advance). Then, we need to add a new line.\n\nAlternatively, the format should include a new line.\n\n Wait, perhaps this:\n\nwrite(*, '(i0, a)') possibleSolutions, trim(solutions)\n\nbut when possibleSolutions is 0 and solutions is empty, then it writes \"0\".\n\n When solutions is non-empty, the 0 and the following string. \n\n Wait, but let's think in code:\n\nThe format '(i0,a)' will first print the number as integer (with no leading padding), then the string.\n\nIf the string is empty (if possibleSolutions =0 and no cases passed), then the 'a' is printed as an empty string. So the output would be '0' followed by any newline.\n\nThe format for write will terminate with a new line.\n\nBecause by default, a write with a format outputs a new line.\n\n Yes.\n\nThus the code:\n\nwrite(*, '(i0,a)') possibleSolutions, trim(solutions)\n\nwould handle the cases correctly:\n\n * If possibleSolutions is 2, and solutions is ' 1x12 2x6', then the output is 2, followed by ' 1x12 2x6' \u2192 2 1x12 2x6 \u2014 but with a leading space between.\n\nWait wait, wait: the trailing space after '2' is followed by a leading space from the solution string? \n\nThe output would be \"possibleSolutions(space)answers\" \u2014 but that may result in two spaces between the number and the words? For example, if there are solutions.\n\nWait for example, possibleSolutions = 1, and the solutions string is ' 1x12'.\n\nThe format is first to print the integer, then the string. So the output would be like '1 1x12' (with a space between them). \n\nBut in the Java code, the solutions string includes the leading space. So when the possibleSolutions is printed (as the first element in the print statement), and then the solution string is added, the output would have the number followed by the entire solutions string (which starts with space). So the total would be 1 followed by a blank, then the labels. \n\nWait, in that case, the actual output would have a space between the count and the first label:\n\ne.g. \"1 3x4 6x2\" when the count is 2 and the solutions are 3x4 and 6x2.\n\nWhich is what the Java code does.\n\nBecause the first character after the count is the leading space. \n\nSo this is okay.\n\nThus the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, ensuring that the function is written correctly.\n\nWait, in the is_solution function, does the function work with Fortran's string handling?\n\nYes. But the function needs to be declared as a function returning logical, with the two arguments: columnsCount and the string s of length 12.\n\n Thus, in the code:\n\n FUNCTION is_solution(columnsCount, x) \n\nand the declarations, etc.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nThe code should be:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninclude the function is_solution\n\nBut in Fortran, the function must be either in an contains block within the program, or external.\n\nThus, here's a possible structure:\n\nprogram codeforces\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: t, i\n\n   character(len=12) :: s\n\n   integer :: possibleSolutions\n\n   character(len=100) :: solutions\n\n   integer :: cc(6), icase \n\n   character(len=5), dimension(6) :: labels\n\n   cc = [12,6,4,3,2,1]\n\n   labels(1) = '1x12'\n\n   labels(2) = '2x6'\n\n   labels(3) = '3x4'\n\n   labels(4) = '4x3'\n\n   labels(5) = '6x2'\n\n   labels(6) = '12x1'\n\n   read(*,*) t\n\n   do i = 1,t\n\n      read(*,'(a12)') s\n\n      solutions = ''\n\n      possibleSolutions=0\n\n      do icase=1,6 \n\n          if ( is_solution(cc(icase), s) ) then \n\n              solutions = trim(solutions) // ' ' // labels(icase) \n\n              possibleSolutions = possibleSolutions +1 \n\n          end if\n\n      end do \n\n      write(*, '(i0,a)') possibleSolutions, trim(solutions)\n\n   end do \n\nend program codeforces \n\nFUNCTION is_solution(columnsCount, x) \n\n   implicit none \n\n   integer, intent(in) :: columnsCount\n\n   character(len=12), intent(in) :: x\n\n   logical :: is_solution\n\n   integer :: i, column_index\n\n   logical, dimension(0:columnsCount-1) :: allXs\n\n   allXs = .true.\n\n   do i = 1,12 \n\n      if (x(i:i)/='X') then \n\n          column_index = mod(i-1, columnsCount )\n\n          allXs( column_index ) = .false. \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   is_solution = any( allXs )\n\nend function is_solution \n\nWait that should work.\n\nWait need to check the allXs. \n\nThe allXs array is declared as 0 to columnsCount-1? So for the size, columnsCount-0 +1 elements (using Fortran's 0:3 array has 4 elements, but columnsCount may be 1 \u2192 0:0 => 1 element. \n\nYes, that's okay.\n\nIn the loop, for i=1 (Java's 0) \u2192 i-1=0 \u2192 column 0 mod columnsCount.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the code looks okay.\n\nWait also, the labels have to be assigned correctly.\n\nLabels(1) is '1x12' for columnsCount=12. The meaning of the label.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: all 12 are X.\n\nIn that case, all columnsCount possibilities should be solutions.\n\nSo the possible solutions would be ' 1x12 2x6 3x4 4x3 6x2 12x1' so count 6. \n\nIn is_solution for columnsCount= whatever, allXs will be all true, so any(allXs) is true -> all condition pass.\n\nEdge case: all characters are '.' except one column.\n\nFor example, if columnsCount=3: so 4 rows per column.\n\n Suppose the first3 characters are X:\n\ne.g. the first column in columnsCount=3: (i=1, i=4, i=7, i=10 have X for column 0? Or what?\n\n Wait, let me take an example:\n\n say s is a string where the first column (using columnsCount=3) is all X.\n\n So the X positions would be positions 1,4,7,10 (assumingcolumnsCount=3, so mod by 3:\n\n for i from 1 to 12.\n\n For i=1 \u2192 mod 3 \u2192 (0 mod3)=0 \u2192 column0\n\n then, next positions adding 3 (step 4 =1+3 \u2192 Column0 mod3. So yes.\n\nThus, the first column (column0) would include indexes 1 (i=1), 4 (i=4), 7 (i=7), 10 (i=10). If all of these are X, and others non-X.\n\n For columnCount=3: isSolution would return true.\n\nThe other columns may not be good.\n\nThus, such a case would have possibleSolutions include 3,4, etc.? Wait if the three \"columnsCount=3\", then one column is good, then it returns true for that 3 case, so label '4x3' (since the count when columnsCount=3, then the \"4x3\" is printed. So in the code, it's correct.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nPossible issues: in Fortran, the mod function's sign, but since all terms are non-negative, it's okay.\n\nAnother possible thing: In Fortran, strings are fixed length. So when we append to the solutions variable, the initial length may require it to be large enough. So the solutions is declared as 100 char, which should be sufficient.\n\nThus the code should be working.\n\n Thus the Fortran version of the code is as described."
