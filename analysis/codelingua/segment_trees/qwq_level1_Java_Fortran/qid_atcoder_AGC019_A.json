The price for two units would be 5, so better to buy two units as 2 pairs (4 units) costing 2 *5=10 and the last unit at 3 \u2192 total 13, which is better than 5 *3 =15. So correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main goal is to calculate the minimum cost for buying N units of something, considering different pricing options. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads five long integers: Q, H, S, D, and N. These represent the prices for different quantities. The code then computes the cheapest price per unit (onePrice) by comparing Q multiplied by 4, H multiplied by 2, and S directly. That makes sense because, for example, if Q is the price for a quarter unit, then 4 quarters make a unit. Similarly, H might be for half units, so two of them make a unit. The cheapest of these three gives the best per-unit price.\n\nNext, there's a condition checking if the onePrice is less than or equal to half of D. If true, it's cheaper to buy all units at the onePrice rate. Otherwise, it's better to buy as many pairs as possible using D (since D is the price for two units) and then the remaining unit (if N is odd) at onePrice. The result is then printed.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps required:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** Java uses Scanner to read inputs. Fortran typically uses read(*,*) statements. Since all variables are integers (or rather, 64-bit integers in Java), in Fortran I'll use INTEGER*8 (or INT64 depending on the compiler, but perhaps just INTEGER for simplicity unless required otherwise) to hold the values. Wait, the problem probably works with regular integers? Wait, the problem says \"long\" in Java, which is 64-bit. In Fortran, if the numbers are large, we should use 64-bit integers. However, in some Fortran compilers, the default INTEGER is 4 bytes, so to get 8 bytes, perhaps need to declare them as INTEGER*8 or use the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module for selected_int_kind.\n\nHmm, perhaps using SELECTED_INT_KIND would be better. Let me think, but for simplicity, maybe just use INTEGER(8) if that's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's input values won't exceed 2^31 so regular 32-bit integers would suffice? Wait, the problem is from AtCoder, which sometimes uses up to 1e18. Wait, in the Java code, variables are long (64-bit), so in Fortran, the numbers need to be able to handle up to 1e18. So Fortran's 64-bit integers are necessary. The way to handle that might be using INTEGER(8).\n\nBut first, I'll start writing the code structure.\n\nThe program has a main program. Let's name it similarly, perhaps 'atcoder_agc019_a' as in Java.\n\nFirst step: declare variables with proper data types.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger*8 :: Q, H, S, D, N\ninteger*8 :: onePrice, temp\n\nWait, maybe the calculations can be done in 8-byte integers. So variables like Q to D and N need to be 8-byte.\n\nThen, read them.\n\nThe input would be read via read(*,*) Q, H, S, D, N\n\nNext, compute onePrice, which is the minimum of Q*4, H*2, and S. \n\nIn Java, they do Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c)), so in Fortran, I can do:\n\nonePrice = min( min(Q*4, H*2), S )\n\nBut need to make sure the order of operations and parentheses.\n\nWait, the min function in Fortran can take multiple arguments but for versions before Fortran95? Wait Fortran 90 introduced generic functions where min with multiple arguments is allowed. So if using F90, can use min(Q*4, H*2, S). Alternatively, the original code in Java does it as three min calls. Let me see: min(Q*4, H*2) gives the minimum of the first two, then take that against S. The same as min( min(Q*4, H*2), S )\n\nBut in Fortran's min with three arguments would work the same. Let me confirm: yes, the Min/Max functions can take multiple arguments. So perhaps it's better to code it as onePrice = min( Q*4, H*2, S )\n\nWait wait, originally, in Java code they have:\n\nonePrice = Math.min( Math.min(Q * 4, H * 2), S );\n\nSo the same as min of Q*4, H*2, S. So in Fortran, the code can be written as:\n\nonePrice = min(Q*4, H*2, S)\n\nThat's simpler.\n\nNext, the conditional: \n\nif (onePrice <= D / 2) then\n\nWait, in Java it's written as (double) onePrice <= (double) D / 2. Casting to double is to ensure that division is floating point. In Java, integer division would have D/2 truncating, but casting to double would do the division as a floating point.\n\nWait but D is given as a long in Java. So when cast to double, D /2 is exact?\n\nWait, let me see the condition again: \n\nThe question is, is onePrice <= D/2 ?\n\nBecause if that is true, then it's better to buy all units at onePrice (so total N * onePrice). Else, it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible (so (N/2)*D plus one if N is odd).\n\nThe key is determining whether onePrice is less than or equal to D divided by 2 (where D is the price for 2 units, so per unit D/2). So if onePrice is <= D/2, then buying in the per-unit is better, else buy D per two units and use onePrice for leftover.\n\nTherefore, in the condition, must compute whether onePrice is <= D / 2. Since in integer division, if done naively, D/2 could be the floor, but in the Java code casts everything to doubles to compute that, so that the division is exact. \n\nIn Fortran, how should we compare this? The question is whether onePrice * 2 <= D. Because doing that avoids any division and uses integer arithmetic. So 1 <= D/2 is equivalent to 2*1 <= D. Since D is an integer. \n\nAh, yes! That's a better approach. Instead of dividing D by 2 (which could be an integer division issue), multiply onePrice by 2 and compare to D.\n\nBecause D is the price for two units. So D/2 is the per-unit cost if you buy two. Therefore, comparing onePrice < D/2 would mean that buying at the single unit price is better. But in integers, to avoid fractional issues, we can rearrange as 2*onePrice <= D ?\n\nWait, yes:\n\nThe condition in the Java code uses (double) onePrice <= (double) D / 2 \n\nWhich is equivalent to onePrice <= D/2 \n\nBut in arithmetic terms, this is the same as 2*onePrice <= D.\n\nSo to avoid dealing with division and possible fractional parts, just compute 2*onePrice <= D.\n\nThis is better to do in Fortran so as not to have to worry about floating points. So replacing the condition.\n\nTherefore, in the condition: \n\nif ( 2 * onePrice <= D ) then \n\n    output N * onePrice\n\nelse:\n\n   compute (N / 2)* D + (mod(N,2) ) * onePrice\n\nThis way, we can use integer arithmetic entirely.\n\nThus, this logic should be safer and avoid any issues. \n\nSo the condition is rewritten to avoid division, thus eliminating the need for real numbers here.\n\nThis is important as Fortran's integer arithmetic may have different division rules, but the condition can safely be rewritten as an integer comparison. So that's the way to go.\n\nSo now, putting it all together.\n\nVariables need to be declared with 8 byte integers (or appropriate length). Let's structure the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc019_a\n\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: Q, H, S, D, N\n    integer(8) :: onePrice, total\n\n    read(*,*) Q, H, S, D, N\n\n    onePrice = min( Q * 4, H * 2, S )\n\n    if ( 2 * onePrice <= D ) then\n        total = N * onePrice\n    else\n        total = (N / 2) * D + mod(N, 2) * onePrice\n    end if\n\n    write(*,*) total\n\nend program atcoder_agc019_a\n\nWait let me check each part:\n\n- The variable declarations: integer(8) are 64-bit integers, sufficient for up to 9e18 or so, which is what Java's long can handle.\n\nThe calculation of onePrice is as before.\n\nThe condition is now correctly using integer comparison.\n\nThe computation of total when else:\n\nIn Fortran, the integer division is done with N/2, which truncates (e.g. N=5 would give 2). mod(N, 2) gives 1 for odd, 0 for even, so (N mod 2)*onePrice adds the remainder unit.\n\nYes, that's accurate.\n\nThen, the write statement outputs the total. \n\nWait, in Java's code, there's a System.out.println, which in Fortran is write(*, *) with the value.\n\nThis should be okay.\n\nSo, this should do it. Let me think if there's any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, let me test with an example. Suppose Q=1, H=2, S=3, D=7, N=5\n\nThen onePrice would be min(4, 4, 3) => 3 (since 1*4=4; H*2 is 2*2=4. So the minimum is S=3.\n\nThen the condition is 2*3 <=7? 6 <=7: yes. Then total is 5*3=15.\n\nAlternatively if D was say 5, then 2*3 is 6 which is greater than 5. Then, the else case would apply.\n\nFor N=5:\n\n5/2 = 2 (integer division), mod(5,2)=1.\n\nSo 2 * 5 (D=5) gives 10, plus 1*3=3 \u2192 total 13. \n\nYes that seems correct. The price for two units would be 5, so better to buy two units as 2 pairs (4 units) costing 2 *5=10 and the last unit at 3 \u2192 total 13, which is better than 5 *3 =15. So correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: N is even.\n\nIf N=4 and D case:\n\nSuppose D=6, and the onePrice's 2 *1*4 is 8 (if Q=2, so Q*4 is 8. H and S are higher. So onePrice would be 8, but D=6. So 2 *8 =16, which is larger than 6. So the condition 2*8 <=6 \u2192 16<=6? No, so use else.\n\nThen for N=4, 4/2=2 \u2192 2 *6 \u2192 12. mod(4,2)=0 \u2192 so 12 +0 \u219212. Which is better than 4 *8=32.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAnother test case where D is better even for even N but:\n\nIf the else case is when onePrice is more expensive than D/2.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay, looks like the code should be correct.\n\nSo the Fortran version of the code is as I wrote above."
