So maybe instead of a map, since in Fortran arrays are straightforward, we can just read them as arrays and just use indices 1 to n. Because the Java code's map is just to get the i-th element by index. So in Fortran, the array indexes are 1-based, so perhaps we can adjust the loop in Fortran to run from 1 to n, and subtract 1 from the index when accessing.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look through the Java code first to understand what it does.\n\nThe Java program reads two lists of integers, v and c, each of length n. Then it calculates the maximum profit by summing all the positive differences between corresponding elements of v and c. So for each index i from 0 to n-1, if v[i] - c[i] is positive, add that to the total.\n\nFirst, I need to see how the data is handled in Java. The Scanner is used to read input. The str2List function splits a string into an array and maps the values with their indices as keys. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but Java uses 0-based here. I need to check whether the Fortran code will have arrays starting at 1, but adjust for the indices.\n\nWait, the Java code uses i starting from 0, so the elements are 0-based. But in Fortran, arrays can be declared with a starting index. Maybe it's better to set the first element to index 1 here? Wait, the problem might require the indices to start at 0? Probably not in Fortran, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indexes don't matter since we just loop through each element. The problem says n elements, so in Fortran, arrays can have indices from 1 to n, so I can read them as such and loop from 1 to n.\n\nLooking at the str2List method: it converts a string like \"5 3 8\" into a map where key 0 maps to 5, key 1 to 3, key2 to8 etc. But since in the loop, the keys are accessed with i from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, it's arrays starting at 1. So maybe instead of a map, since in Fortran arrays are straightforward, we can just read them as arrays and just use indices 1 to n. Because the Java code's map is just to get the i-th element by index. So in Fortran, the array indexes are 1-based, so perhaps we can adjust the loop in Fortran to run from 1 to n, and subtract 1 from the index when accessing. Wait, no, in the Java code, the key is sequential. So maybe the arrays can just be directly stored as one-indexed, and the loop from 1 to n.\n\nThe Java code reads the first input line as n, then next lines as v and c strings. Then converts those to a list. So in Fortran, I can read n first, then read two lines of space-separated integers, each of length n, then proceed.\n\nLet me think about how the variables would be structured in Fortran. The variables:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- v and c are arrays of integers with dimension n.\n- The loop will iterate from 1 to n, each time take v(i) - c(i), if positive, add to max.\n\nThe Java code's str2List is redundant in Fortran because arrays are straightforward. So first steps: read n, then read two lines, each with n integers.\n\nThe Fortran program steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read next line, split into n integers for v array.\n3. Read the following line into n integers for c array.\n4. Initialize max as 0.\n5. Loop over each index from 1 to n:\n   a. compute profit = v(i) - c(i)\n   b. if profit >0, add to max.\n6. Print max.\n\nNow, how do I read the input lines? In Fortran, to read from standard input, can use read(*,*) statements.\n\nWait, let me think of input:\n\nAfter n is read, the next line will be the v elements separated by spaces, and the next line is c.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n\n5 3 8\n\n3 5 2\n\nThe n is 3, then v is [5,3,8], c is [3,5,2].\n\nThen for each i, their differences. i=1: 5-3=2 (add to max), i=2: 3-5=-2 (no), i=3:8-2=6 (total becomes 8).\n\nSo total is 8.\n\nSo in the code, how to structure that.\n\nNow, Fortran code structure.\n\nFortran uses modules and program structures. Since the Java code is in a class with main, here in Fortran, the main program will be a program block.\n\nFirst, the declaration of variables:\n\ninteger :: n, i, max, profit\n\nBut also arrays. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: v, c\n\nFirst, read n, then allocate v and c arrays of size n.\n\nWait, but how to read the values?\n\nWait, in Fortran, when reading a line of space-separated integers, you can read directly into the array.\n\nSo step by step.\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc125_b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, max, profit\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: v, c\n\n  read(*,*) n\n  allocate(v(n))\n  allocate(c(n))\n\n  read(*,*) v\n  read(*,*) c\n\n  max = 0\n  do i = 1, n\n    profit = v(i) - c(i)\n    if (profit > 0) then\n      max = max + profit\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  print*, max\n\n  deallocate(v)\n  deallocate(c)\n\nend program atcoder_abc125_b\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the arrays are read directly from the input line. For example, after allocating the v array of size n, the read statement read(*,*) v will read the next line's numbers into the array.\n\nBut wait, need to make sure that the lines have exactly n numbers.\n\nBut the problem states that the input is correct as per the constraints.\n\nSo the code above should work. Now, let me check for details.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the str2List splits on spaces, and creates a map with key 0 starting. But when stored in arrays in Fortran starting at 1, the elements are correctly stored. So the indices just shift, but the calculation remains the same except for starting at 1, which the loop takes care of.\n\nYes. So the Fortran code seems correct.\n\nWait, in Java, the for loop is from 0 to n-1, (since i < n). In Fortran's do loop is from 1 to n. So since arrays are 1-based, the elements 1 to n correspond to Java's 0 to n-1 in the indices. The elements themselves are the same as read in order, so the loop is correct.\n\nTherefore, this code should work correctly.\n\nWait, but the variables: profit is an integer, and max is initialized to 0. That is okay.\n\nTesting edge cases. For example, n=1 where v(1)=3 and c=5. Then difference is -2, so max remains 0.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nSo this translation should work. Let me check for syntax and possible issues.\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared before use. In the code above, the declarations are all at the top of the program block, which should be okay.\n\nAlso, the deallocate is good practice but might not be necessary here as the program will exit, but adding it is safe.\n\nThe allocate statements are necessary because the arrays are of size n which is read at runtime.\n\nYes.\n\nThe rest should work.\n\nThus, the Fortran code is as above."
