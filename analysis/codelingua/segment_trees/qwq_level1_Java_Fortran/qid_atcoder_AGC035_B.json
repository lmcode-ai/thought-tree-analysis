    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. The problem seems to involve a graph, probably related to some tree or connected structure since they're using DFS. \n\nLooking at the main function, it starts by reading the number of nodes and edges, then builds an adjacency list for each node. The edges are stored bidirectionally because every edge a-b is added to both connect[a] and connect[b]. Then there's a check if the number of edges is odd, which causes the program to print -1 and exit. Otherwise, it performs a DFS starting at node 0, keeping track of visited nodes and some 'odd' boolean flags. The output is a series of pairs formed through the DFS process but maybe related to some parity condition.\n\nHmm, the DFS function's logic is a bit tricky. The 'visited' array has states: 0 (unvisited?), 1 (visiting), 2 (visited). The 'odd' array probably tracks whether the number of edges traversed up to that node is odd? Or maybe some other parity check.\n\nFirst, I'll need to structure this in Fortran. The main points are:\n\n- Declare the adjacency list. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays like Java's ArrayList, I'll need to handle that. Maybe use linked lists or a 2D array with fixed size? Wait, but maybe the edges can be stored as a list. Since the nodes are up to the number provided, perhaps using an array of lists. But Fortran's array handling for variable-sized elements is limited. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since Java uses static arrays for 'connect', which are initialized in a loop, perhaps in Fortran I can pre-allocate an array of maximum possible size, assuming the number of edges is limited. But the problem statement might not have given a limit. Alternatively, use the number of edges from user input to size them. Wait, but for adjacency lists, each connect list can have varying sizes. So maybe I can represent it as a list of lists with dynamic sizing, but in Fortran, that's not straightforward. Maybe using arrays with the maximum possible capacity known at compile time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem constraints have a known upper limit for numNode and numEdge. Since the original code uses an ArrayList which dynamically resizes. In the Java code, since each edge connects two nodes, the adjacency list for each node might have up to (numNode - 1) edges, but maybe in practice it's manageable. Wait, but in a dense graph, each node could have many edges.\n\nHmm, the first step in Fortran is to figure out how to represent the adjacency list. Since Fortran isn't great for dynamic data structures, perhaps I'll process the input and build an adjacency list using a 2D array with a size sufficient for the worst case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using linked lists. But that's more complicated. Let me think:\n\nWait, the original Java code uses an array of ArrayLists. Each ArrayList holds the neighbors of a node. So for each node a, connect[a] contains all b nodes connected to a.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps I can use a linked list structure, but that's a bit more complex. Alternatively, considering that in the problem, maybe the nodes are numbered from 0 to numNode-1, and the adjacency array can be built using a list of lists.\n\nWait, in Fortran, maybe the easiest way is to use an array of dynamic arrays, but I need to see what data structures are available in Fortran. Since Fortran can use subroutines and allocate arrays at runtime with ALLOCATE, perhaps each node's connections can be stored in a dynamic array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of edges is the same as the number of elements in all the adjacency lists. Since each edge is stored twice (once for a and once for b), the total elements across all adjacency lists will be 2*numEdge. So perhaps first read all the edges into an array, then build adjacency lists from that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan:\n\n1. Read the number of nodes (numNode) and edges (numEdge).\n\n2. Since for each edge, it's stored in both directions, the adjacency lists will have two entries per edge.\n\n3. First, create an array to store all edges, then for each node, keep track of its adjacency list. However, to do that efficiently, maybe preallocate the arrays:\n\n- First, read all edges into a ,for example, an array of integers of size (2*numEdge), but that might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me think: perhaps create an adjacency list for each node as a dynamic array. Since Fortran allows pointers or dynamic arrays, maybe use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, here's an approach for Fortran:\n\n- For the adjacency lists, since each can have a variable length, perhaps for each node i, have a dynamic list stored in an array, with a counter for the size. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, to manage a dynamic list for each node, you can do the following:\n\nHave an array of pointers to 1D arrays. For each node, when an edge is added, allocate a new array or expand the existing one. \n\nBut that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, first collect all edges, and then for each node, count how many edges they have, and allocate arrays of the right size.\n\nBut maybe in this problem's case, since the graph is processed once when the edges are read, maybe we can pre-allocate the adjacency lists:\n\nFirst, before reading edges, maybe create for each node an array of (numNode) to hold their neighbors? But that would be sparse. Alternatively, perhaps in Fortran, since the number of edges is known, we can compute for each node the number of edges they have, then allocate the adjacency lists accordingly.\n\nSo step-by-step plan for adjacency lists:\n\n1. Read all edges first.\n\n   - Create an array (or two arrays) to store all a and b pairs.\n\n   Let me think. The steps could be:\n\n   - Read the edges (a and b), store them in temporary arrays (e.g. edges(1:numEdge,2)), where edges(i,1) is a, edges(i,2) is b.\n\n   Then compute for each node the degree (number of edges in connect[i]).\n\n   After computing, for each i from 1 to numNode (since in Fortran, nodes are likely 1-based unless specified?), then allocate the adjacency lists:\n\n   Let's say nodes are 1-based (assuming the input uses 1-based indices?), then for each node, count the number of occurrences in the edges.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the input is read as a and b and then stored as a-1 and b-1 since in Java it's 0-based. So in Fortran, perhaps all nodes are 0-based (like in Java). Wait, in the code, the input 'a' and 'b' are subtracted by 1 (a-1 and b-1) to make them 0-based in Java. So in Fortran, perhaps we should treat them as 0-based if we want to port the code accurately, but Fortran typically has 1-based arrays. Hmm, this needs to be considered.\n\nWait, this could be a source of confusion. The Java code uses 0-based indices (nodes 0-based), so in Fortran, the node indices in the adjacency list should be 0-based as well. But Fortran's default is 1-based, so to avoid confusion, perhaps the code will be 1-based in Fortran, but we need to convert the input to 0-based? Or perhaps we can just use 1-based and adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's make things 1-based here. Suppose in Fortran we have nodes numbered from 1 to numNode. Then when we read a and b, they are as per user input (probably 1-based?), but the original code subtracts 1 to make them 0-based. Wait, the original code says:\n\n    int a = sc.nextInt() - 1;\n    int b = sc.nextInt() - 1;\n\nSo the user inputs are 1-based (e.g., if the user inputs 1 and 2 for a node 1, then the Java code stores them as 0 and 1), and thus the adjacency list is 0-based.\n\nHmm, so perhaps in Fortran we can choose to use 1-based arrays. Wait, but then in the code, maybe I need to adjust them. Alternatively, to keep things the same as the original code, use 0-based in Fortran as well. Since in Fortran we can use 0 as a lower bound if we set the array indices accordingly.\n\nWait, Fortran arrays can be declared with arbitrary bounds. For example, an array can be declared as node 0:numNode-1.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, just keep the nodes as 0-based and use arrays with appropriate indices.\n\nFor example:\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: connect\n   integer :: numNode, numEdge, i, a, b\n\n   read(*,*) numNode, numEdge\n\n   allocate( connect(0:numNode-1, 0: numEdge) ) ! Not sure yet. Hmm maybe this is a wrong approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency lists can be stored in a 2D array where each row (for each node) expands as needed. However, Fortran doesn't support dynamic 2D arrays easily unless using pointers.\n\nHmm, this seems getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another way. Since in Fortran, dynamic arrays can be allocated with allocate.\n\nAn alternative approach for adjacency lists:\n\n- First, create for each node an array. Since Fortran doesn't support arrays of pointers to arrays (unless using derived types and pointers), maybe the easiest way is to precompute all the required lengths first.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the edges once, count for each node how many neighbors it has.\n\n   - read all edges into a temporary storage, perhaps a 2D array with numEdge rows and 2 columns.\n\n   - for each row (i, a, b), count for a and b's adjacency lists.\n\n   - then allocate, for each node, an array of the count. Then loop again to fill the adjacency lists.\n\nBut this may be manageable. So here's a detailed plan:\n\nFirst, after reading the number of nodes and edges:\n\n   - Read all the edges into temporary arrays (edgeA and edgeB). Since in Java the code subtracts 1, in Fortran, the input a and b will be stored as (input value -1) to be 0-based.\n\n   Let me note that in the Java code, the a and b are read and then decremented. So in Fortran:\n\n   Read the a and b, then set a = a_in -1, b = b_in -1.\n\n   Then, first, read all edges into arrays:\n\n   Initialize a temporary array, say tmp_edges, with two columns, and as many rows as numEdge.\n\n   Then for each edge, store tmp_edges(i,1) = a and tmp_edges(i,2) = b.\n\nThen, we need to find the adjacency list for each node:\n\nInitialize an array 'counts(0:numNode-1)' to 0.\n\nFor each i in 1..numEdge\n\n    counts(tmp_edges(i,1)) = counts(tmp_edges(i,1)) +1\n\n    counts(tmp_edges(i,2)) = counts(tmp_edges(i,2)) +1\n\nThen, allocate an array of pointers for each node's connections. Since in Fortran we can't have arrays of pointers easily, maybe instead create a 2D array where for each node, we have a list. However, a separate array is needed.\n\nAlternatively, create an array of dynamic lists.\n\nWait, here's another way:\n\nThe rows in a array for all adjacency elements. Let:\n\nmax_neighbors is the total counts.\n\nBut actually, each node has a certain number of neighbors. Let me think of an edge-wise storage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency lists can be stored in a single large array with pointers to each node's start and end.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Since this is a programming competition style code, maybe the constraints are such that the maximum nodes and edges are small enough to handle with any method.\n\nAnother approach is to make a list for each node, represented by an array of nodes, using linked lists. But that would use pointers, which may complicate.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, to mimic the Java's ArrayList, we can use dynamic array methods.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran:\n\nUse a derived type for the adjacency nodes. For example, a type that has an array and a count.\n\nFor example:\n\ntype adjacency_type\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\n   integer :: count = 0\nend type\n\nand then create an array of adjacency_type:\n\ntype(adjacency_type), dimension(0:numNode-1) :: connect\n\nThen for each edge addition:\n\nWhen adding a to b's list and vice versa, we can append to each's list.\n\nThus, for each edge a and b (in 0-based indices):\n\nallocate the list if needed, and append.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, appending requires reallocation and copying. Since each edge is processed sequentially, perhaps we can first compute the size each list needs, then allocate and fill in the data in a second pass.\n\nLet me see the steps again:\n\n1. Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n2. Read all edges into a temporary array (each edge has a pair (a, b), 0-based).\n\n3. For each edge, count how much each node's adjacency list will need.\n\n   - Initialize counts(0:numNode-1) = 0\n\n   Over all edges do:\n\n   a = ... , b = ...\n\n   counts(a) +=1\n\n   counts(b) +=1\n\n4. Then Allocates lists. For each node, allocate its array with size counts(node):\n\n  do i = 0, size(connect)-1\n\n     allocate (connect(i)%list(1:counts(i)))\n\n     connect(i)%count = 0 \n\n   but we need to reset counts.\n\nWait, perhaps that should be:\n\nAfter connecting counts, we need to reset the counts to zero?\n\nHmm perhaps not. Wait, in the counts array, counts holds the length. We need to, for each node, allocate an array of size counts(node). Then, go through the edges again and add the edges to each node's list.\n\nAlternatively, let me detail the steps:\n\nAfter obtaining counts array.\n\nThen go through each node and allocate an array size of counts(node):\n\nallocate (connect(i)%list(0:counts(i)-1))\n\nor, with 1-based indices.\n\nWait, this requires that the indices are managed properly. Perhaps:\n\nallocate (connect(i)%list( (upper_bound) )\n\nThen, reset the counts to zero to use as insertion pointers.\n\nThen, loop through all edges again, and for each edge (a, b)\n\nadd b to a's list (current counter of a, then increment a's counter)\n\nadd a to b's list (current counter of b, then increment b's counter)\n\nThus:\n\nallocate the lists according to counts then go through edges again:\n\ninitialize for each node:\n\n    connect(i)%count = 1 ! assuming 1-based, or 0 if zero-based.\n\nWait, initializing to 0, and then for each entry, write to list(connect(i)%count), and then count +=1.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step-by-step:\n\nInitialize the adjacency lists:\n\nAfter the counts array is computed:\n\ndo i = 0, numNode-1\n\n   allocate( connect(i)%list( 1: counts(i) ) )\n\n   connect(i)%count=0 \n\nenddo\n\nThen loop over each edge:\n\nfor each edge has a (d,1) = a and b (d,2)=b as original edge (already 0-based)\n\n    a = edges(d,1)\n\n    b = edges(d,2)\n\n    connect(a)%count = connect(a)%count +1\n\n    connect(a)%list( connect(a)%count ) = b\n\n    connect(b)%count = connect(b)%count +1\n\n    connect(b)%list( connect(b)%count ) = a\n\nBut since I initially allocated to the correct length, need to ensure that both a and b get their entries filled in the correct positions.\n\nAlternatively, another way. Let me think:\n\nMaybe it's easier to read the edges, then for each edge, first add to each's list.\n\nBut for each edge (a, b), you need to append to a's list the b.\n\nSo, whenever adding to a list, if it's full (i.e., at present count reaching allocated array's size?), but since the counts array was properly computed, that should not happen.\n\nHmm, this approach may work. But maybe this requires using dynamic allocation for each list, where the list is stored as an allocatable array. Since initial count is known, first allocate once at the correct size.\n\nSo the count (as a variable) is the current length, starting at 0. Then, for each of the two edges (a and b), for each edge in tmp_edges:\n\n      current a is edges(d,1), current b edges(d,2)\n\n      connect(a)%list( connect(a)%count ) = b\n\n      connect(a)%count = connect(a)%count +1\n\n      and similarly for b.\n\nWait, but arrays in fortran are 1-based. So perhaps:\n\nWhen allocating to the count(a) is counts(a), and using indices from 1 to counts(a).\n\nSo when first setting up:\n\ndo i =0, numNode-1\n\n   allocate( connect(i)%list( counts(i) ) )\n\n   connect(i)%count =0\n\nend do \n\nWait then the first entry is connect(i)%list(1). Hmm, perhaps setting connect(i)%count to zero, and when adding, we do connect(a)%list( connect(a)%count +1 ) = b and then count +=1. So when count is 0, it gets 1, etc.\n\nAh, that would make:\n\nfor each a and b in the edge:\n\n    connect(a)%count = connect(a)%count +1\n\n    connect(a)%list( connect(a)%count ) = b\n\n    Similarly for b.\n\nWait no, the count starts at 0. So:\n\nfor an edge:\n\na and b are nodes.\n\nWe need to add b to a's list, so:\n\nconnect(a)%count = connect(a)%count +1\n\nthen connect(a)%list( connect(a)%count ) = b. \n\nBut since the count's limit is exactly the counts(a) computed earlier, this should work. The same for b.\n\nThis step can be done in the first pass of edges.\n\nThus, step by step code:\n\n1. Declare the type:\n\ntype adjacency_list\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n   integer :: count\nend type\n\ntype (adjacency_list), dimension(0:*) :: connect ! Not sure about dimensions. Need to declare array correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the adjacency_list is declared as:\n\n   type adjacency_node\n       integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: list\n       integer :: nelem\n   end type adjacency_node\n\n   type(adjacency_node), dimension(0:numNode-1) :: connect\n\nSo when after reading the input edges:\n\n- Read all edges into a temp array edgeA(1:numEdge), edgeB(1:numEdge)\n\nthen compute counts.\n\n counts(0:numNode-1) = 0\n\n then do i=1 to numEdge:\n\n     a = edgeA(i) -1\n\n     b = edgeB(i) -1\n\nWait wait no, in Java the code does:\n\na = sc.nextInt() -1, since the input is 1-based, so in fortran, the input is read as:\n\nReading a from user as a_in, so a is a_in - 1 (0-based). \n\n Wait in the Java code:\n\n Original code reads a and b which are 1-based in user's input (since it's subtracting 1). So in fortran:\n\nEach edge is read with, for example:\n\n   read(*,*) a_in, b_in\n\n   a = a_in -1\n\n   b = b_in -1\n\n   then then the code stores them in the edges lists and counts.\n\nBut in our first step for creating counts:\n\n   for all edges:\n\n      counts(a) +=1\n\n      counts(b) +=1\n\nSo once we have the counts, we can loop through the edges again (or process each edge as we come), to build up the adjacency lists.\n\nWait perhaps the first step is to read all edges into a temporary list.\n\nBut first approach's steps (temporarily storing all edges):\n\nRead all edges first. We'll need a way to store them all.\n\nLet's see in Fortran code:\n\nprogram name\n\n   implicit none\n\n   type adjacency_node\n       integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n       integer :: nelem\n   end type adjacency_node\n\n   integer :: numNode, numEdge, i, a_in, b_in, al, bl\n\n   ! Read numNode and numEdge.\n\n   read(*,*) numNode, numEdge\n\n   ! Allocate the adjacency array (connect)\n\n   ! Need dimension 0 ... numNode-1, so check if we can declare that.\n\n   type(adjacency_node), allocatable,dimension(0:numNode-1) :: connect\n\n   allocate( connect )\n\n   ! Now, first we need to read all the edges and count.\n\n   integer, allocatable :: edge_list(:,:), tempcounts(0:numNode-1)\n\n   ! Allocate edge_list as (numEdge,2). \n\n   allocate(edge_list( numEdge, 2 ) )\n\n   tempcounts = 0\n\n   do i=1, numEdge\n      read(*,*) a_in, b_in\n\n      a = a_in-1\n      b = b_in-1\n\n      edge_list(i,1) = a\n      edge_list(i,2) = b\n\n      tempcounts(a) = tempcounts(a) +1\n      tempcounts(b) = tempcounts(b) +1\n   end do\n\n   ! Now, for each adjacency node, allocate the list.\n\n   do i = 0, numNode-1\n       allocate( connect(i)%list( 1: tempcounts(i) ) ) \n       connect(i)%nelem = 0  ! init elements count.\n   enddo\n\n   ! Now, go over edges again to fill the adjacency lists.\n\n   do i=1, numEdge\n       a = edge_list(i,1)\n       b = edge_list(i,2)\n       ! Fill in a's list with b\n       connect(a)%nelem = connect(a)%nelem +1\n       connect(a)%list( connect(a)%nelem ) = b\n       ! Fill in b's list with a\n       connect(b)%nelem = connect(b)%nelem +1\n       connect(b)%list( connect(b)%nelem ) = a\n   enddo\n\n   ! Now the adjacency lists are built.\n\n   ! Continue processing with the rest of the code...\n\nThat seems feasible.\n\nNow, proceeding further with the code, the next step is the visited array and the odd boolean array, and the stringbuilder for output.\n\nBut in Fortran, instead of StringBuilder (which appends strings), we can build an array or use a dynamic array of strings.\n\nThe Java code uses a static StringBuilder named 'print', which is built in the DFS calls.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can to collect the output lines in an array of lines, and then write them all at the end.\n\nThus, the 'print' is represented as an array in Fortran, where each line is a string.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran does have output streams, but since in the code, it's appending each line during the DFS, we could just write each line immediately, but need to track the accumulated output correctly.\n\nAlternatively, since in the code, the 'print' order is important, and the lines are being built via appending during the DFS recursive function, it would be easiest to output as soon as the lines are being constructed, or store them in an array and later print all entries.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran code, each time a line is appended, write it to a unit, say to unit 8. But since the code in Java ends by printing print.toString(), we can output all lines in the same order.\n\nBut let me think of variables:\n\nIn Java, after the initial setup:\n\nThe code proceeds with checking whether numEdge is even:\n\nif (numEdge %2 !=0)\n\n   print -1 and exit.\n\nElse, proceed with the rest.\n\nSo in Fortran, compute if mod(numEdge, 2) ==0; else print -1 and exit.\n\nThen, proceed to call the DFS.\n\nNow, variables needed:\n\nvisited array:(init to 0)\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n   integer, allocatable :: visited(:)\n\n   logical, allocatable :: odd(:)\n\n   allocate( visited(0:numNode-1) )\n\n   allocate( odd(0:numNode-1) )\n\n   visited = 0\n\n   odd = .false.\n\nThen call dfs(0, -1) (since in Java, the root is 0, parent -1 ( indicating no parent)).\n\nNow the DFS function: static void dfs(int crt, int parent)\n\nIn Fortran, function can be a subroutine. So the DFS is a recursive subroutine.\n\nThe parameters would be crt (current node, 0-based) and parent (0-based or -1?).\n\nSo in Fortran, the parameters would need to be integers.\n\nThe code in DFS:\n\n   mark visited as 1 (state 1: visiting)\n\n   then for each child in connect[crt]'s list.\n\n   So the adjacency list's current node's children are in the list. For each, check if it's parent or not.\n\nWait, in Java, the code loops over each in connect[crt]. Each child in the adjacency list:\n\n   for (int child : crtConnect) {\n\n      if (parent == child) skip?\n\n      else if Visited[child] is 1, then cycle\n\n      else: process.\n\nWait the code in the Java DFS loop is:\n\nFor each neighbor node in the current node's adjacency list:\n\n    if child is parent or visited is 1 (visited state 1?), skip.\n\n    else if visited is 2, then which action?\n\nNeed to see each line.\n\nWait extracts from the DFS:\n\nstatic void dfs(int crt, int parent) {\n\n    visited[crt] = 1;\n\n    ArrayList<Integer> crtConnect = connect[crt];\n\n    for (int child : crtConnect) {\n\n        if (child == parent || visited[child] == 1) {\n\n            continue;\n\n        } else if (visited[child] == 2) {\n\n            print.append( ... )\n\n            odd[crt] = !odd[crt];\n\n        } else {\n\n            dfs(child, crt);\n\n            if (odd[child]) { do some appending }\n\n            else { append other }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    visited[crt] = 2;\n\n}\n\nHmm, this logic needs careful translation.\n\nFirst, for each neighbor (child) in the adjacency list of crt:\n\nIf child is parent or (child already visited ==1 (still visiting)), then continue.\n\nElse: check if child is visited[2], which is 'processed'?\n\nWait, when visited is 2, it's after being fully processed (when we have exited the for loop and set To 2 done with the abc.\n\nWait, for the case when the child is visited 2, then it's already processed, so perhaps that means it is the ancestor or already part of a backtracking step.\n\nWait the logic is a bit confusing. Let me try to understand the algorithm's logic here.\n\nThe DFS in the Java code seems to be part of some parity adjustment.\n\nThe main variables are visited (three states 0,1,2; the standard possible states except maybe using 2 for completed).\n\nAlso odd[crt] is either true or false, which is flipped when certain edges are printed.\n\nThe printing appends pairs of nodes according to certain conditions.\n\nThe 'print' collects the pairs of nodes to print.\n\nNow, in terms of traversing the graph, but also with some logic around parity.\n\nThe key part is when in the loop over children:\n\nWhen reaching a child that is parent - skip (since it's the parent, so after processing children coming back).\n\nIf child is in state 1 (visited but not finished), that's part of the current path and so maybe cycle indicator? So in that case, that would form a cycle? But the original code might be assuming the graph is a tree?\n\nWait the problem's original code is from a coding competition problem AGC035_B. Looking at the problem possibly requires that the graph is a tree? The code has edges being stored as a bidirectional list, but perhaps the graph is a tree? Because otherwise the logic of DFS may have issues.\n\nWait in the problem's name, it's AGC035_B, which could be any graph. The check for even edges may be part of the solution. \n\nThe code starts by checking if the edges count is even, otherwise -1.\n\nWhich suggests that when the number of edges is odd, the solution is impossible. Therefore the problem probably requires an Euler trail-like condition, which is when in an undirected graph, all vertices have even degree (for Euler tour) else exactly two with odd degree (start and end points).\n\n But in this program, if edges is odd, it returns -1, suggesting that even numbers of edges are required? So perhaps the problem is about path?\n\nThe rest of the DFS is handling the parity.\n\nNow, the easiest way to port the algorithm correctly is to precisely transcribe the logic.\n\nNow in the for loop over children (each child in the adjacency list):\n\nWe have to loop through all the children in the adjacency list of the current node.\n\nIn Fortran, each adjacency list for node 'crt' is stored in the type's list array.\n\nSo in the for loop:\n\nSo in the DFS:\n\nsubroutine dfs(crt, parent)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: crt, parent\n\ninteger :: child, i, child_count\n\n ! statements...\n\nend subroutine dfs\n\nInside:\n\nfirst set visited(crt) to 1.\n\nthen:\n\nchild_count = connect(crt)%nelem\n\nloop over each entry in the adjacency list's list array.\n\nWait, for all indices from 1 to child_count:\n\n   do i =1, connect(crt)%nelem\n\n       child = connect(crt)%list(i)\n\n       if ( ... )\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but all the neighbors of 'crt' are in the list (so, including the parent)\n\nThus, for each child in connect(crt).list(1..connect(crt)%nelem)\n\n   then the conditions:\n\nif (child == parent) then \u2192 skip\n\nor if (visited(child) == 1 \u2192 since it's been visited, and still in visiting, so implies part of the current path \u2192 so skip.\n\nElse if visited(child) ==2 \u2192 then that's back edge, indicating the child is an ancestor.\n\nIn that case, the code:\n\nprint.append( (crt , child) \u2192 but then in Fortran, append the line.\n\n then set odd[crt] flipped.\n\nElse (child is unvisited (0), so proceed to visit it via recursion:\n\nthen, after returning from dfs(child, crt),\n\nthen, if (odd(child)) was set, then output (child, crt) \u2192 and flip its odd state.\n\n else, output (crt, child) \u2192 flips the odd state of crt.\n\nHmm, the code seems to count the number of operations or track some parity?\n\nThe code's purpose in the problem is probably to generate edges in such a way that we have a path that \"adjusts\" the cycle (even edges)\n\nPerhaps this part is best to handle how Fortran's loop can capture the children.\n\nThus, in Fortran's DFS subroutine:\n\nInside the loop for each child:\n\n   child = connect(crt)%list(i)\n\n   if ( child == parent or visited(child) ==1 ) then \n\n       continue\n\n   else if (visited(child) == 2) then \n\n       ! case when child has been fully processed. (ancestor?)\n\n       write a line (crt+1, child+1)\n\n       odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n\n       continue\n\n   else\n\n       call dfs(child, crt)\n\n       if ( odd(child) ) then \n\n           write the line (child +1, crt+1)\n\n           odd(child) = .not. odd(child) \n\n       else\n\n           write the line (crt +1, child +1)\n\n           odd(crt) = .not. odd(crt)\n\n       end if\n\n   end if\n\nWait but writing to output isn't straightforward.\n\nThe Java code appends to a stringbuffer, so in Fortran, perhaps the approach is to build up an array of strings (each line is a string), and append each new line to this array. Alternatively, output immediately to a file-unit. Let me see.\n\nPossibly make an array of strings, and each time a line should be added to the output, append to that array. But since in Fortran, strings have fixed length in arrays, perhaps we can use character arrays with a maximum length.\n\nAlternatively, we can build an array of index and format the elements when needed.\n\nAlternatively, just output directly to stdout when the lines are generated. \n\nBut in the code, the main 'print' is built through the DFS calls, so during DFS, when a line is appended, we can immediately write to a filehandle.\n\nHowever, note that in Java's code the print is a global variable, defined as static so accessible within the DFS function. \n\nIn Fortran, perhaps use a global array of strings or a global variable structure.\n\nBut to make it manageable, here's one approach:\n\nUse a character array to collect each line, stored in a dynamically allocated array. Also track the number of lines added.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ndeclare:\n\ninteger :: line_count =0 \n\ncharacter(len=100), allocatable :: printed_lines(:)\n\nallocate( printed_lines(1:numEdge) ), maybe, since the maximum lines is the number of edges? Or more precisely, since the algorithm may output a path or the required steps, but maybe the total lines are the number of edges?\n\nWait in Java's code, the output is generated by appending each edge pair exactly once? \n\n Looking at the code:\n\nEach edge is processed exactly once? Well, in the DFS, the path through the tree may require using edges in different directions depending on the logic.\n\nHowever, total printed lines could be up to the total edges? But perhaps not. Since the problem's stdout ends with the print's content as the main code does: \"print.print()\".\n\nBut in any case, the lines can be accumulated in an array, and then at the end, do a loop to print all.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nallocate printed_lines(1:numEdge)\n\nthen counter line_count =0\n\nat each point where a line is generated:\n\nline_count = line_count+1\n\nprint_str = ...\n\nprinted_lines(line_count) = trim(adjustl(print_str))\n\nthen after the function, output all lines.\n\nAlternatively, during code compilation, it might be better to preallocate for sometimes, perhaps double the edges? But perhaps taking the edge count as max lines.\n\nBut in the code's original Java code, prints can occur in both branches, so the total lines may be similar to the number of edges.\n\nThus, let me proceed to code outline.\n\nFirst, declare necessary variables globally:\n\n   integer :: line_count =0\n   character(len=13) , allocatable :: printed_lines(:)\n   ! (Length for numbers: assuming node numbers up to 1e5 could need 1 + ... let's see 6 digits? so two numbers with 6 digits plus ' ' and '\\n' \u2192 maybe 13 is enough?)\n\nInside main:\n\nallocate( printed_lines( 1: numEdge*2 ) )\n\nthen, in the dfs function, appending to it:\n\n   call append_line( str )\n\nwhere append_line adds to printed_lines(line_count) etc.\n\nAlternatively, have a function to append.\n\nBut in the DFS, whenever they make a print append, in Fortran, one can write:\n\ncharacter(len=20) :: s\n\nwrite(s,*) (crt+1), (child +1)\n\ntrim(s), and stored in printed_lines.\n\nBut in Fortran, to format:\n\nwrite(s,'(I0, A, I0)') crt+1, \" \", (child+1)\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\ninside the line generation, want to do something like:\n\ninteger :: a, b\n\na = crt +1 \n\nb = child +1 \n\nwrite(s, '(I0,A0,I0)' ) a, ' ', b \n\nWait but to ensure proper string formation.\n\nThus, in the code for lines to print:\n\nWhen the line needs to be added as (a) and (child):\n\n   a = crt +1; b= child+1\n\n   write(s, '(I0, 1x, I0)') a, b \n\n   ! Add the new line character?\n\n   ! Java uses \\n, which is LF. In Fortran, newlines can be handled with \\n in the format ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when outputting, concatenate with new lines, or just let each entry in the array represent a line, and then write them separated with newlines.\n\nWait, perhaps between each print, the line is printed with a new line at the end.\n\nThe Java code appends the line with \"\\n\".\n\nThus, in the Fortran, the corresponding code should be:\n\n    s = trim(str) // char(10) \n\nBut not sure, since Fortran end statement in write.\n\nAlternatively, when outputting all lines, after the DFS, loop through each and write.\n\nIn the 'print.print()' at the end of Java's main':\n\nIn Fortran, that would be a loop like:\n\ndo i=1, line_count\n\n    write(*, '(A)' ) trim(printed_lines(i))\n\nend do\n\nThus, returning to the DFS code:\n\nSo inside each append part of the code:\n\nfor example, first case: visited(child) ==2 \n\nthen:\n\n    a = crt +1 \n\n    b = child +1\n\n    write(formatted_str, '(I0,1X,I0)') a, b \n\n    line_count = line_count +1 \n\n    printed_lines(line_count) = formatted_str\n\n    odd(crt) = .NOT. odd(crt) \n\nSimilarly for the other cases.\n\nThus, the main variables to pass around are line_count and the printed_lines array. But since Fortran does not have pointers for multidimensional arrays, perhaps this will be easier to keep them as global variables.\n\nWait, in Fortran, derived types and procedures can have access to variables in the outer scope.\n\nAlternatively, have the main program's variables (printed_lines and line_count) declared in the interface, but this may require modules.\n\nAlternatively, declare all variables in the main program and have the dfs subroutine as internal.\n\nAlternatively, using save attributes or global variables.\n\nPerhaps in this case, the easiest way is to have main program have the variables, and the DFS as an internal subroutine.\n\nIn Fortran, an internal procedure can access variables of the surrounding scope.\n\nSo, in code outline:\n\nprogram name\n\nimplicit none\n\ntype adjacency_node\n\n   ... \n\nend type\n\n... declarations for variables ...\n\ninteger, allocatable :: printed_lines(:)\n\ninteger :: line_count=0\n\nsubroutine dfs(crt, parent)\n\n  ... code inside, accessing the printed_lines, line_count variables....\n\n ! but must be declared as implicit none, so need to make sure variables are accessible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the DFS and other procedures are modules.\n\nBut perhaps to make it manageable, the code is written as an internal subroutine.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC035_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ntype adjacency_node\n\n   integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n\n   integer :: nelem\n\nend type adjacency_node\n\ninteger :: numNode, numEdge\n\nlogical, allocatable :: odd(:)\n\ninteger, allocatable :: visited(:)\n\n! ... other declarations...\n\ntype(adjacency_node), dimension(:), allocatable :: connect\n\n...\n\nallocate the variables as above.\n\n... proceeding with the code:\n\nthen the DFS as an internal subroutine:\n\n   contains \n\n   recursive subroutine dfs ( crt, parent )\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: crt, parent\n\n      integer :: i, child \n\n      integer :: maxIndex \n\n      maxIndex = connect(crt)%nelem\n\n      visited(crt) = 1 \n\n      do i=1, maxIndex\n\n          child = connect(crt)%list(i)\n\n          if( child == parent .OR. visited(child)==1 ) then \n\n              cycle \n\n          else if ( visited(child) ==2 ) then \n\n              ! append to output\n\n              character(len=20) :: s\n\n              write(s, '(I0, 1X, I0, A1)') (crt+1), (child +1), achar(10) ? Not sure.\n\n              Wait, no. The Java code does: print.append(s + \"\\n\") \u2192 but the equivalent in Fortran is to build the string then append.\n\n              However, for the lines stored, we can format as:\n\n              integer a,b\n\n              a = crt +1 \n\n              b = child +1 \n\n              line_count = line_count +1 \n\n              write( printed_lines(line_count) , '(I0,1X,I0)') a, b \n\n              odd(crt) = .NOT. odd(crt)\n\n          else \n\n              call dfs( child, crt )\n\n              if ( odd(child) ) then \n\n                  ! append (child+1, crt+1) \n\n                  line_count = line_count+1\n\n                  write( printed_lines(line_count), '(I0,1X,I0)') child +1, crt+1 \n\n                  odd(child) = .NOT. odd(child)\n\n              else \n\n                  line_count = line_count+1 \n\n                  write( printed_lines(line_count), '(I0,1X, I0)') crt +1, child+1 \n\n                  odd(crt) = .NOT. odd(crt)\n\n              end if \n\n          end if \n\n      end do \n\n      visited(crt) = 2 \n\n   end subroutine \n\nEnd program...\n\nWait, but in the first case (when child is visited 2), we must also append the line and flip the odd.\n\nSo that case:\n\nthe else if clause...\n\nIn code:\n\n \n\n else if (visited(child) == 2 ) then \n\n   ! appending the line of (crt, child):\n\n   a = crt+1 \n\n   b = child+1 \n\n   line_count ... etc\n\n   odd(crt) = not.\n\nWe have to add:\n\nSo in the else if: \n\n      else if ( visited(child) ==2 ) then \n\n          integer :: a, b \n\n          a = crt +1 \n\n          b = child +1 \n\n          line_count = line_count +1 \n\n          write( printed_lines(line_count), '(I0,1X,I0)' ) a, b \n\n          odd(crt) = .NOT. odd(crt) \n\nThus, this is the code for that part.\n\nFinally, when the main program exits, after the initial DFS call, then before printing to stdout, ensure to write the lines.\n\nAlso, the original code's initial if (numEdge mod 2) < 0 --> if the edges are odd, return -1. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nmain:\n\nread numNode and Edge.\n\nbuild adjacency lists.\n\nif mod(numEdge,2) /=0 \n\n   print *, -1 \n\n   stop \n\nelse \n\n call dfs(0, -1 )\n\nthen :\n\n print all the printed_lines.\n\nWait though in fs:\n\nprint all lines:\n\ndo i=1, line_count \n\n   write(*, '(A)') printed_lines(i) \n\nend do\n\nBut in the code, the first dimensions of printed_lines must be at least line_count.\n\nWe allocated in the main program:\n\nnumEdge times 2? Or?\n\nAlternatively, at the beginning:\n\nallocate( printed_lines( 0:numEdge ) )\n\nWait, supposing the lines can't exceed numEdge?\n\nThe original code may possibly have each edge visited once, producing one line per edge? Not sure but maybe.\n\nAnyway, at allocation:\n\nallocate( printed_lines(1 : 2*numNode ) )\n\nor perhaps double the edges ...\n\nBut as a conservative estimate, allocating numEdge lines.\n\nThus code for the main:\n\nallocate( printed_lines( 1: numEdge * 2 ) )\n\nthen, after the call to DFS, write:\n\ndo i=1, line_count\n\n    write(*, '(A)') trim( adjustl( printed_lines(i) ) )\n\nend do\n\nThus, putting all these together.\n\nBut now, dealing with some edge cases:\n\n- For the 'parent' variable in Fortran, which in Java is -1.\n\nBecause the nodes are 0-based, parent can be -1, but in Fortran, arrays start from 0. But in the code's adjacency lists, the 'child' and 'parent' are in the same node numbers (0-based).\n\nThus, for the first call to dfs(0, -1 ).\n\nHowever, in Fortran, the parent can be set to -1 indicating no parent.\n\n When checking in the if statement, (child == parent) \u2192 if child is the 'parent' node (which would be -1), but how?\n\nWait, since the child comes from the adjacency list. The starting node\u2019s parent is set to -1 (which is node outside the node list).\n\nThus in the code's first loop for the root node (crt=0) and parent =-1:\n\n for each neighbour (child), thus, any child in connect(0)%list which is not == -1 (since nodes are 0-based):\n\nso no ,for them all will not be. So the condition \"child == parent\" will <= since node cannot have parent as -1's neighbor.\n\nBut perhaps the condition is okay.\n\nThus, the DFS call is okay.\n\nPotential issues to check:\n\n- For node numbers:0-based vs 1-based. The code's output is node indices +1, because the problem requires 1-based output.\n\nThe code in Java uses a+1 and b+1 in print statements when adding to the stringbuilder. Thus, in Fortran the same is done.\n\n Additionally, during the check for parent: for example, when moving back from child to parent, but the parent is not counted as child.\n\nNow, handling the allocation:\n\nRegarding the adjacency_node's list:\n\nIt's allocated with size tempcounts( node ), and that should equal exactly the number of edges per node. The do loops fills the array in order, so this should be okay.\n\nPotential issue in code: in Fortran's loop over edge_list, when reading edges:\n\nCurrently when the code does:\n\n      a = edge_list(i,1)\n\n      b = edge_list(i,2)\n\nthen for each edge adds b to a's list, and a to b's list.\n\nThus the adjacency lists will have both entries.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, let me try to outline the Fortran code:\n\nThe final steps in code writing:\n\nThe code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_AGC035_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    type adjacency_node\n        integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n        integer :: nelem! count of filled in list.\n    end type adjacency_node\n\n    integer :: numNode, numEdge, i, a_in, b_in, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: visited(:), odd(:)\n    character(len=20), allocatable :: printed_lines(:)\n    integer :: line_count ! in main program scope.\n\n    logical :: valid\n    type(adjacency_node), allocatable :: connect(:)\n\n    !

Mark as processed\n    visited(crt) =2\n end subroutine dfs\n\nend program atcoder_AGC035_B\n\nHmm, but I need to check the line_count in the main program.\n\nWait, when the subroutine is called, due to being inside the main program, it can access \u2019line_count' which is in the main's scope.\n\nSimilarly, the printed_lines array is in the main scope.\n\nFurthermore, odd and visited are also accessible.\n\nThus, that's okay.\n\nBut in Fortran90 and above, this is possible.\n\nNow possible issues:\n\n1. In Fortran, the print lines must not exceed the allocated array.\n\nThe allocation in main code is for 2*numEdge elements. Since each line is adding lines based on traversal, which in the worst case may be O(n), but with edges as high as 1e5, but the allocated size may be double that but acceptable.\n\n2. The \u2019visited\u2019 and 'odd' arrays are being accessed via the DFS.\n\nThe visited array is initialized to 0 before the DF< call.\n\nThe third point:\n\nThe condition when visited(child)==2: the code appends the line (crt, child) then flips the odd[crt].\n\nWhich corresponds to the Java's case.\n\nIn the last part of the 'else' clause (when visited(child) is 0):\n\nAfter calling dfs and returning:\n\nif (oddd(child)), then the path is being adjusted (since it requires to flip the edge direction? The logic of this part requires the code matches the original Java.\n\nI think the code mirrors the Java's algorithm.\n\nNow, possible issues in Fortran code:\n\n- The 'parent' can be -1, and child= parent \u2192 implying comparing -1 and connected\u2019s list elements. Since the adj lists contain node indices (0-based), so the nodes cannot be -1, so this condition can only be true if the child is exactly -1, which is not possible. Hence, thus, the 'if statement' is okay, leading to cycle.\n\nThus the 'child' == -1 will not occur, ,for the first call's parent. So the condition is safe.\n\nThus, this translation should work.\n\n**Final Fortran Code**"
