So maybe make the cnt array as integer(8) or some kind parameter. Alternatively, declaring kind=8. But in the code:\n\nInteger arrays need to have each element as integer. So better to declare the array and res as 64-bit integers. So in the code above:\n\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(0:20) :: cnt\n\nand res also as integer(8). But in the code above, I think the variables n and i and x are integers, but when multiplying counts, since the counts can be up to n (like if n=1e5, then cnt(10) could be 1e5, so (1e5 * 1e5) would be 1e10 which is bigger than 2e9, so using integer(kind=8) is required.",

Thus total first sum is 1 (i=0) + ... + 1 (i=5) \u2192 total of 2 so far. Then the 5 and -5 (i=5 and the other is 15?), but their contributions are already counted in the 5 loop's terms.

The two terms: 5+15 give 20, so their sum would be (5-10) + (15-10)= (-5)+(5)=0. Correct. So their pair is included in the loop i=5. So the first part gives 1 (i=0) + 1 (i=5) + 0 in the other indices. So first sum is 2, then plus the other terms (only if there are 0 counts):\n\ncnt(10) is 0 here. So total 2, which is correct (the pairs are (-10,10), (-5,5) \u2192 2 pairs). So yes. The code works. Thus the Fortran code seems correct. But let me check edge case when n is 0. N is read.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Alright, I'll start by understanding what the Java code does first.\n\nThe Java program is solving a problem where it reads a bunch of integers, probably between -10 and 10, since they add 10 to the input numbers to store them in an array cnt. The purpose seems to count how many pairs of numbers sum up in certain ways, maybe? Let me look more closely.\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nIt imports Scanner, which in Java is used for reading input. The main method starts. The user inputs 'n', the number of integers. Then there's an array cnt of length 21, since they cast 1e5+5 to int, but wait, that N variable is not used elsewhere except maybe for defining the array size. Wait, maybe that's a typo or something? Let me check: the array cnt is initialized as new long[21], so the N is actually not necessary except perhaps maybe a variable not used. Oh, the code as written has N as (1e5+5), but the array is of 21 elements. So maybe that's a mistake, but the code doesn't use N anywhere else.\n\nContinuing, in Java, they loop n times, each time adding 10 to the number input, and incrementing count there. Because the input numbers can be negative, adding 10 shifts them into 0-20. For example, if the input is -10, adding 10 gives 0, so index 0. If input is +10, then adds 10 to become index 20.\n\nThen the code calculates res by adding cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i] for i from 0 to 9 (loop runs 9 times starting at 0?), since 10 terms? Wait no, for (i=0; i <10; i++), so from 0 to 9, total 10 terms. For each i, that's counting pairs whose indices add up to 20. But since the indices are offset, since the input number plus 10 is the index, then the real numbers would be index -10.\n\nWait, let's see: the current element is i = (num +10) so num = (i-10). Similarly the 20 -i would correspond to (20 -i) -10 =10 -i. The product would be for when (i-10) + ( (20 -i) -10 ) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe two numbers in the pair have their original value shifted by +10 each. So the first number is (x) = input number +10, which is their index. The second is (y) = other number +10.\n\nThe original numbers are (x-10) and (y-10), so their sum is (x-10)+(y-10) = (x + y) -20.\n\nSo the condition for the first part of the code (the first for loop) is adding cnt[i] * cnt[20 -i]. Let's see when that would apply.\n\ncnt[i] and cnt[20 -i], so x is i and y is (20 -i). The sum would then be (i -10) + (20 -i -10) = (i-10)+(10 -i) =0. \n\nAh, so that part is counting the number of pairs that sum to 0. So when the sum of the two numbers is zero, their indices would need to add up to 20 (since (x= a +10 and y = b +10, and a + b =0 => x + y = (a+b) +20 =20). Therefore, for each i from 0 to9, pairing with 20 -i gives each pair once (since i <10, so 20 -i is more than 10). Wait but when i=10, we have 20-10=10, so we have 10 +10 =20. That case is treated in the next part of code (the addition of cnt[10]*(cnt[10]-1)/2. That adds combinations where two elements are at index 10, i.e., the original number is 0 each. Because 10 is index 10: since 0 +10 is 10, so numbers of 0 contribute to cnt[10]. So choosing two of them gives a pair that sums to 0.\n\nTherefore the code counts all pairs of numbers that add to zero, considering all possible pairs (but avoids duplicates). Because the first loop is doing i from 0 to 9 (i <10) so that each pair (i, 20 -i) is counted once, and the second term handles the 10 case where it's the same index twice.\n\nTherefore, the code is counting the total number of unordered pairs of distinct elements (since in the first part, each pair (a, b) where a is in i and b in 20-i is counted once, but since (a,b) and (b,a) would both be covered, but in this case, since i goes only up to 9, the 20- i (10 -i) is greater than 10, so the pairs are counted once. Wait no, when i is 0, the other index is 20, so (0,20) (which corresponds to -10 and +10). So each possible pair where the sum is 0 is only considered once, avoiding duplicates, except when both numbers are 0, which needs to account for combinations of two zeros.\n\nOkay, so the code's main purpose is to read n numbers, count their frequency shifted into a 21-element array (indices 0-20), then compute the total number of pairs that sum to zero. So when translating to Fortran, need to maintain the same logic.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran:\n\nFirst, Fortran uses array indices that start at 1 by default, but can be declared to start at 0. The Java code's cnt is from index 0 to 20.\n\nIn Fortran, you need to dimension the array with a starting and ending index. But by default, arrays are 1-based, but you can set it with the LBound and UBound. To make it compatible, perhaps declared as cnt(0:20).\n\nNext, getting the input. The Java code uses a Scanner. In Fortran, we can use read *, to get input. So:\n\nRead the first integer as n.\n\nThen, read n integers, each time, adding 10, and increment the corresponding element in cnt array.\n\nThen, calculate res as per the loops.\n\nWait, but Fortran doesn't have a Scanner, so input is more straightforward.\n\nSteps:\n\nProgram outline:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nInitialize cnt array (dimension 0 to 20) as 0.\n\nLoop n times:\n\n   Read an integer x.\n\n   idx = x + 10\n\n   if idx is between 0 and 20, increment cnt(idx).\n\nWait, but in Java, inputs could have numbers from, say, -10 to 10? Assuming that, so adding 10 gives 0 to 20.\n\nIf the inputs are outside that range (but in the problem probably within), then the code would have a bug, but the problem might ensure that.\n\nSo assuming all numbers are between -10 and 10. So each x+10 is between 0 and 20.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThen compute the res:\n\nFirst loop from i=0 to 9 (inclusive):\n\nres = res + cnt(i) * cnt(20 -i).\n\nThen add ( cnt(10) * (cnt(10) -1) ) / 2.\n\nThe last term accounts for choosing two zeros (the ones at index 10, corresponding to original 0).\n\nThen output res.\n\nNow, writing this in Fortran:\n\nNote: In Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared otherwise. So to use 0-based indices, we need to declare like integer, dimension(0:20) :: cnt.\n\nAlso, in loops, the equivalent of for (int i=0; i <10; i++ ) in Fortran would be a do loop from 0 to 9, increment.\n\nThe first part:\n\nres = 0\n\ndo i =0,9\n\n   res = res + cnt(i)*cnt(20 -i)\n\nend do\n\nThen adding ( cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1)/2 ) because 10 is the 0-based index.\n\nThus the whole code:\n\nPossible code steps:\n\nprogram codeforces_131_b\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, x\n  integer, dimension(0:20) :: cnt\n  integer(kind=8) :: res\n\n  !

Java uses long, but in Fortran, the equivalent would be perhaps integer(kind=8) for 64-bit integers. But if the problem constraints are small, maybe even regular integers could work. The original uses long, so better to use 64-bit.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nThe cnt array is declared as an integer (assuming default), but if they can have large counts (e.g., n is up to 1e5?), which in the Java code comment, the N variable is set to 1e5 +5. The problem name codeforces_131_B suggests it might be from codeforces. Let me see problem B. \n\nLooking up problem 131B? Hmm, perhaps problem 131B is \"Catalan Square\" but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires counts as large as n elements, which can be up to perhaps the N given, but since the code uses long arrays, counts could get big. So better to use 64-bit integers.\n\nIn Fortran, to use 64-bit integers, perhaps using integer(8).\n\nSo maybe make the cnt array as integer(8) or some kind parameter.\n\nAlternatively, declaring kind=8.\n\nBut in the code:\n\nInteger arrays need to have each element as integer. So better to declare the array and res as 64-bit integers.\n\nSo in the code above:\n\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(0:20) :: cnt\n\nand res also as integer(8).\n\nBut in the code above, I think the variables n and i and x are integers, but when multiplying counts, since the counts can be up to n (like if n=1e5, then cnt(10) could be 1e5, so (1e5 * 1e5) would be 1e10 which is bigger than 2e9, so using integer(kind=8) is required.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran code:\n\ndeclared as:\n\ninteger(8) :: cnt(0:20) \n\nand res.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables are declared with types. The program structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_131_b\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, x\n  integer(8), dimension(0:20) :: cnt ! Array to hold counts. Starts 0\n  integer(8) :: res\n\n  cnt = 0  ! Initialize all to zero\n\n  read *, n\n\n  ! Read each number and count them\n  do i = 1, n\n      read *, x\n      ! Calculate the index\n      cnt(x+10) = cnt(x+10) + 1\n  enddo\n\n  ! Compute the result\n  res = 0\n  ! first loop from i=0 to 9 (inclusive)\n  do i = 0,9\n    res = res + cnt(i)*cnt(20 -i)\n  enddo\n\n  ! add cases where the number x is 0 (counted in index 10)\n  res = res + ( cnt(10)*(cnt(10)-1) )/2\n\n  print *, res\n\nend program codeforces_131_b\n\nWait, but indexes in Fortran arrays must be in declared bounds. Since it's 0:20, so 20-i where i is from 0 to 9 is okay, because 20-0 is 20 (valid), 20-9=11 also valid.\n\nNow, variables n, i, x can be declared as regular integers since n is up to 1e5 (assuming from the code's N value, but probably the problem allows n up to 1e5 which is within 32-bit integer). So that's okay.\n\nWait but when storing the counts in cnt, which are each elements stored in 64-bit integers. The increment is okay.\n\nWhat about the loop over i from 1 to n in the do loop. The loop variable i is declared as integer, which is okay as long as n doesn't exceed 2e9.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest with small input. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose input is:\n\n3\n\n-1 0 1\n\nWhich adds to the counts:\n\nFor -1 +10 =9 \u2192 cnt(9)=1\n\n0 \u2192 10 \u2192 cnt(10)=1\n\n1\u219211 \u2192 cnt(11) =1\n\nNow computing:\n\nThe first loop (i from 0 to 9):\n\nFor i=0: 20 -0 = 20. cnt(0)*cnt(20)? zeros for 0 and 20 here, so 0.\n\ni=\u2026 until i=9 (the input's -1 is 9 in cnt).\n\nThen when i=9:\n\ncnt(9)*cnt(20 -9)= cnt(9)*cnt(11). cnt(9)=1, cnt(11)=1 \u2192 adds 1*1 =1.\n\nOther terms are zero except this. So contribution from this is 1.\n\nThen the second term for index 10 has count 1 \u2192 (1*0)/2 =0. So total res is 1. Let's see pairs.\n\nThe pairs:\n\nThe numbers are -1,0,1. Pairs that sum to zero are (-1 and 1), which is one pair. 0 and 0: not here. So total 1, which matches.\n\nThe code would give 1 +0=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 2 0's. n=2, numbers 0 and 0.\n\nThen cnt(10)=2.\n\nThe first loop: since i runs up to 9, so those terms will have 0 contribution. Then add (2*1)/2 =1. So total 1 which is correct (the pair formed by the two zeros).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=4, with 10, -10, 5, -5.\n\nThen their counts:\n\n10 added 10 becomes 20 \u2192 cnt(20)=1.\n\n-10 +10 \u2192 0 \u2192 cnt(0)=1.\n\n5 \u219215, -5 \u21925.\n\nSo cnt(15) +=1, cnt(5) +=1.\n\nNow for first loop:\n\ni=0 \u2192 cnt(0)*20-0=20 \u2192 cnt(0)*cnt(20) =1 *1 \u21921.\n\ni=5: cnt(5) * cnt(15). 1 each, so adds 1*1=1. So first part sum is 1 (i=0) + ... when i=5, adding 1. Any other terms?\n\nChecking other terms:\n\nAt i=5, yes, but what about i=15? No, since the loop is up to 9. So the i=5 case is included (since 20 -5 =15, which is in the array). The first loop includes all i from 0 to9, so the pair between 5 and 15 is considered at i=5 (since 15=20-5).\n\nThus total first sum is 1 (i=0) + ... + 1 (i=5) \u2192 total of 2 so far. Then the 5 and -5 (i=5 and the other is 15?), but their contributions are already counted in the 5 loop's terms.\n\nWait for the first part sum:\n\nThe total from all i from 0 to9 would include 1 (0 and 20 terms: -10 and 10) and 5 to 15 (their indices are 5 and15, which is 5+ (15's number is 5, since index is 5's input is -5. The two terms: 5+15 give 20, so their sum would be (5-10) + (15-10)= (-5)+(5)=0. Correct. So their pair is included in the loop i=5. So the first part gives 1 (i=0) + 1 (i=5) + 0 in the other indices.\n\nSo first sum is 2, then plus the other terms (only if there are 0 counts):\n\ncnt(10) is 0 here. So total 2, which is correct (the pairs are (-10,10), (-5,5) \u2192 2 pairs).\n\nSo yes.\n\nThe code works.\n\nThus the Fortran code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check edge case when n is 0. N is read. But in the problem probably n is given between 1 and ?\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, the \"res\" variable must be initialized to zero. In the code above, yes, it's set to 0.\n\nPossible typos or issues:\n\n- Index from 0 to 20 requires the array to be declared from 0 to 20. So in the code, \"dimension(0:20)\" is important.\n\n- Calculate x +10, which is stored as the index. So if x is -10, gives 0.\n\nFortran uses 1-based index as default, so array starts at 0 only when declared. The code is okay.\n\nIn Fortran, the default integer in the code may be different, but if the variable res is declared as integer(8) (64-bit) then it's okay.\n\nSo I think the code is correct as written above."
