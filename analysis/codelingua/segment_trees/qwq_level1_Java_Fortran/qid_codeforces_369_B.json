Wait in the Java code, the while loop controlling sk >0, and the inner loop decrements idx until reaches n-k? Wait, no. Let me look again:\n\nWait in Java:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {\n\n   int idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk>0 && idx>= n -k) {\n\n       ans[idx]++ \n\n       sk--;\n\n       idx--;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait no, sorry my mistake. The code in the original first loop is:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {  // Loop 1\n\n   int idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk >0 && idx >= n-k) {  // Loop 2\n\n      ans[idx]++; \n\n      sk--;\n\n      idx -=1;\n\n   }\n\n} Wait, each time Loop1 repeats, it re-sets 'idx' to n-1, and then moves backward from the end, until idx reaches n-k (exclusive?), adding 1 to ans[idx] each time, but stopping if idx is less than n-k or sk is zero. But that might not be the most efficient, because after the first iteration of Loop1, you go all the way from n-1 down to n-k, then repeat. Wait actually, the outer loop (while sk>0) is being run once for each increment in any position.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what each part of the Java code does so I can accurately convert it. \n\nThe Java code is for a class called codeforces_369_B, which has a main method and a helper method called getPoints. From looking at the main method, it reads six integers from the user: n, k, l, r, sAll, and sk. It then calls getPoints and prints the resulting array.\n\nNow, the getPoints method initializes an array ans of size n filled with l. Then, it adjusts sAll and sk by subtracting the sum of the initial values. Then there are a couple of loops that adjust the values in the array. The first while loop increases the last k elements (since idx starts from n-1 and goes backward only for the last k positions?) until sk is zero. The second loop increases the first elements until sAll is used up.\n\nHmm, the indices in Java are zero-based. In Fortran, arrays are typically 1-based by default unless declared otherwise. So that's something important to note. The translation needs to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's tackle translating the main method. In Fortran, there isn't a direct equivalent of Java's Scanner (Scanner is for reading input). So, in Fortran, we usually read inputs using read and write statements. Let's sketch the main program part.\n\nThe main function in Fortran would read the integers from standard input. The variables n, k, l, r, sAll, sk would be declared. Then call the getPoints subroutine or function, which in Fortran is a function that returns an array.\n\nWait, functions in Fortran can return arrays. Let me note that. The getPoints function in Java returns an integer array. In Fortran, I can define a function that takes the parameters and returns an array. But need to specify the dimensions.\n\nFirst, I'll need to structure the code. Let me start writing the outline.\n\nFirst, the module or the program structure. Suppose the Fortran program is structured as a main program. Let me write:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_369_B\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n   INTEGER :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n   INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: ans(:)\n\n   ! Read inputs\n   READ(*,*) n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   ! Call function\n   ans = getPoints(n, k, l, r, sAll, sk)\n\n   ! Write output\n   WRITE(*,*) ans\n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nHowever, wait, functions with allocatable return types might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the getPoints function will receive the array through an argument and fill it in. But functions returning arrays are possible in Fortran, but I need to see.\n\nAlternatively, make getPoints a subroutine that takes the array as an output parameter.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can have procedures returning arrays. Let's check the function approach.\n\nAnother thing: the original Java's getPoints has parameters n, k, l, r, sAll and sk. Let me check parameters passed. Since the code uses l and r, but in the code as presented, variables r isn't being used? Wait in the Java code, the variable 'r' is not used in the getPoints function? Wait, looking at the Java code, in method getPoints, variables r, l are perhaps constraints. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, in Java's getPoints method:\n\nThey initialize ans to all l. Then sAll is reduced by sk (but that's confusing because sk is the first input, but let me retrace.\n\nWait the first part of getPoints:\n\nans filled with l.\n\nsAll -= sk + (n - k)* l\n\nWaits, original sk is input (but the lines could have typos?), the variables names may differ. Let me see the Java variables:\n\nWait, in the Java code, the parameters are (int n, int k, int l, int r, int sAll, int sk). So sk is a parameter given. Then, the code does:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n-k)*l ?\n\nWait, no. Let me read:\n\nOriginal line:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k) *l ?\n\nWait the first line:\n\nint sk = scan.nextInt(); \n\nWait, and then in getPoints, the parameters after sAll, sk. The variables inside the method are:\n\nsk is the parameter passed in. \n\nWait, then the lines are:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)* l ?\n\nWait the code actually says:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l; \n\nWait, but that seems like maybe a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps the code has an error here? Let me check.\n\nWait, the initial array ans is filled with l's. Thus, the current total is (sum ans) = n*l. Then they say:\n\nsAll starts as the input sAll. Then the first subtraction is sAll = sAll - sk (wait, but let me see the original code:\n\nWait, the first step is sAll -= sk + (n -k)*l ?\n\nWait that would be sAll = sAll - [ sk + (n-k)*l ]? That doesn't seem right. Wait perhaps the code has a typo, perhaps meant (sk passed to the method's value?), but looking back.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThe first part is:\n\nint[] ans = new int[n];\n\nArrays.fill(ans, l); \n\nSo all elements in ans are l. The total sum is (n)* l.\n\nThen the sAll is decreased by sk plus something? Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nCompute initial sum of ans array: all elements starting at l.\n\nThe current total is n*l.\n\nBut then the code subtracts sk plus (n -k)* l from sAll.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe there is a formula here I need to get right.\n\nThe code then subtracts from sAll an expression: sk + (n -k) * l ?\n\nWait sAll is the total required points. The initial array's sum is n * l.\n\nThe code seems to be trying to compute some remaining variables but let me see the steps.\n\nWait the original code:\n\nsAll is the desired total.\n\nThe initial array starts with all l. So the initial sum is n*l.\n\nThe code does sAll -= (sk + (n -k)* l) ?\n\nWait that would be: \n\nremaining sAll after initial setup is sAll minus the sum of (sk + (n -k)* l). Wait that can't be right. Maybe it's a typo in the code?\n\nWait perhaps there is more here. Let me re-examine the Java code:\n\nWait the code:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)* l;\n\nWait, perhaps that line is supposed to be:\n\nsAll = sAll - sk - (n -k)*l ?\n\nBut that would be sAll minus sk minus the term. But in the code, the '-' minus operator applies to the entire expression. Like sAll = sAll minus [sk + (n-k)*l]. Because the operator is subtraction of the entire term. So let's proceed with the code as written.\n\nAfter that they subtract sk (again here):\n\nsk -= k * l;\n\nWait, the original sk variable is a parameter passed in, so initializing this code:\n\nWait sk is initialized to the input parameter? Probably so.\n\nPerhaps the algorithm is distributing the points.\n\nLet me try to see the logic again:\n\nThe problem is likely as follows from Codeforces problem B Div.2 contest 369? Let me try to think the code's purpose.\n\nProbably the code is creating an array of n elements where k elements are at least l and at most r. The total sum is sAll, and sk is the sum of those k elements.\n\nThe process starts by setting all elements to l. Then, \n\nthe first step: \n\nThe initial total is n*l. The desired total is sAll, so the remaining points to allocate after initial are sAll - n*l. Not sure about the intermediate steps but looking at the code.\n\nWait in the code, after setting ans to all l:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)*l \n\nHmm, that might mean that after initial setup, the current total of the first part (the sk part?), but I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just proceed step by step, translating the code as is, even if not understanding it.\n\nThe first step is to create an array ans of length n, filled with l.\n\nThen sAll is subtracted by sk plus (n-k)* l.\n\nsk is subtracted by k * l.\n\nThen, while sk is positive, distribute the remaining to the last k elements (since we start from the end?)\n\nWait:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nsk -= k*l, since after that sk is the remaining after subtracting the initial k elements times l. Wait, initially sk was the input, and then after subtracting k*l, maybe it represents the remaining points to allocate beyond l in the k elements?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\nEach of the k elements must contribute at least 'l', and up to 'r' points. The total of the k elements must be exactly sk.\n\nWait that's likely. Because in the first step:\n\nWe set all elements to l, then:\n\nThe total for the k elements would be (since the first k elements are part of them?) Or maybe the last k elements?\n\nWait the first part adjusts sk.\n\nWait, the first part: the initial sum of the k elements (if we consider the array is being modified between the first k and others?) Not sure, but let's just proceed.\n\nThe process is to have certain constraints on the elements. Let's think the array has to have k elements with each between l and r (or something). The code first initializes all to l, then some steps to adjust.\n\nBut regardless of the algorithm, I have to translate the code as it is.\n\nProceeding.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code:\n\nNeed to replicate the same steps. Let's first write the function.\n\nFirst, the variables in Fortran should be in the function's interface. Since the function returns an array of integer values of size n, which is one of the parameters.\n\nBut in Fortran, when you define a function that returns an array, the kind of interface must be explicit.\n\nAlternatively, use a subroutine that modifies an array.\n\nLet me think a possible structure.\n\nMaybe the getPoints function in Fortran would be written as a function with an intent(out) array.\n\nWait, to make it easy, perhaps define the getPoints as a subroutine. So the main program could call it with an array to fill.\n\nAlternatively, the function could return an array. Let's see:\n\nIn Fortran, you can do something like:\n\nFUNCTION getPoints(n, k, l, r, sAll, sk) RESULT(ans)\n\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n   INTEGER, DIMENSION(n) :: ans\n\nThen proceed to fill ans.\n\nSo let me think that approach.\n\nThen, the steps in the Java function getPoints would translate as:\n\nInitialize the ans array with l for all elements.\n\nThen:\n\nsAll = sAll - ( sk + (n -k)* l ) \n\nWait but variables here: in the Java code, the variables are sAll and sk are parameters. Wait, but in the Java code, inside the getPoints method, the code is modifying these variables. However, in the function, these variables are passed by value, so their values in the main program are not changed.\n\nWait the Java code's parameters sAll and sk are input parameters. So inside the method, when they subtract values from them, it's creating local copies. So in the function, variables will be local copies, which is handled correctly.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the function can do similar steps.\n\nNow, handling arrays in Fortran:\n\nThe first step is:\n\nans = [ l, l, ..., l ]\n\nIn Fortran, this can be done with ans = l. Since the array is initialized with l for each element.\n\nThen:\n\nsAll = sAll - (sk + (n - k)* l )\n\nWait sAll is an input parameter. Wait in the Java code, in the getPoints method, they are local variables, not parameters. Let me check:\n\nWait in Java, inside getPoints method, the variables sAll and sk are parameters passed in. So in the code's first lines, \n\nYes, inside getPoints, sAll and sk are parameters of the method. So in their local scope, the code subtracts from these variables.\n\nSo in the code's steps:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)* l \n\nWait, that is taking the sAll parameter (input) and subtracting the term to get a new sAll.\n\nWait, perhaps that's an error. Wait the current sum of the ans array is all l, so the total is n*l. But then, the code subtracts an expression that includes the parameter sk (the input) plus the sum of (n -k)*l.\n\nWait that seems like a mistake. Let me think:\n\nWait perhaps the parameter sk is the sum that those k elements must reach. Let me suppose that the problem requires that the sum of k elements is exactly sk. The code's algorithm first sets all elements to l, so the initial sum for the k elements would be k * l. The difference between sk and k*l is what we have to distribute to those elements. Then, similarly for sAll which is the total of all elements.\n\nHmm, perhaps it is better not to get bogged down in the meaning and focus on the code translation, assuming correctness.\n\nThe first step:\n\nans = l for all elements.\n\nThen:\n\nm6 = sAll - ( sk + (n - k)*l ) \n\nWait, sAll is the desired total. The current total after setting all elements to l is n*l. So the remaining required is (sAll - n*l). \n\nBut the line in the code is sAll = sAll - ( sk + (n -k)* l ), so perhaps that is part of distributing sk as the required sum for the k elements?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula represents the following: the first part requires that the k elements must sum to exactly sk. So, initially, the k elements (the last k elements?) have been set to l each, so their sum is k * l. To reach sk, the difference (sk - k*l) must be distributed into those k elements. But also, the other (n-k) elements contribute their initial l's.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is handling the required sum for the k elements (sk) and the overall sAll. Let me see:\n\nThe code first initializes the array to l's. The total is n * l.\n\nBut the sAll is desired to be sAll. Yet the code then modifies sAll by sAll -= ( sk + (n-k)*l ). This seems odd. Wait maybe it's a miscalculation.\n\nLet me parse the first line:\n\nsAll -= ( sk + (n - k)* l )\n\nWhich would result in new sAll value is: sAll = sAll_initial - sk - (n -k)*l\n\nWait, but the current total after initialization is n*l. \n\nWhy subtract ( sk + (n -k)*l ) from sAll? The goal is to maybe have the difference between desired sAll and initial n*l must be equal to (sAll_initial - n*l). \n\nWait, perhaps it's a way to compute remaining points. Let me not get stuck here. Let's just proceed. The code is correct (assuming the problem's constraints are met), and we need to translate it.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nStart with ans = l\n\nCompute sAll and sk (variables local to the function).\n\nsAll = sAll_param - sk_param - (n - k)*l\n\nWait, the parameter sk is being subtracted here.\n\nWait that's the same as in Java.\n\nWait the first line of variables in getPoints (Java) are:\n\nint sAll = the parameter sAll passed in. \n\nWait no, looking at the code again. In Java's getPoints's parameter list:\n\npublic static int[] getPoints(int n, int k, int l, int r, int sAll, int sk) \n\nThen inside:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)* l \n\nWait, so sAll (the parameter's value) is used here. So the line is:\n\nsAll = sAll - (sk + (n -k)*l); \n\nWait, the sk in this is the passed-in parameter (the 6th parameter). Wait not the initial sk variable before. Because the method's parameters are n,k,l,r,sAll,sk. So sk is the 6th parameter. \n\nWait the parameters here mean:\n\nOriginal arguments passed into getPoints are n, k, l, r, sAll (the overall desired sum), sk (the desired sum for some subset of elements). \n\nWait, perhaps sk is the desired sum for the k elements which are supposed to have scores between l and r, and the rest can be adjusted up to r? Not sure, but proceeding.\n\nContinuing the translation.\n\nAfter the first sAll deduction, the code then does:\n\nsk -= k*l \n\nWait, again in Java. So the parameter sk is being modified here.\n\nWait, sk in the method is the variable initialized from the passed parameter (the sk input to the function). So for example, if the sk parameter is the required sum for the k elements:\n\nThe code first sets all elements to l, so the k elements (maybe the first k? Or last?) have each l. \n\nThe total for the k elements is k * l. \n\nThe difference between the desired sk (parameter) and that initial value is (sk (parameter) - k*l). So in the code sk = sk (parameter) - (k * l) is the amount we have to distribute among the k elements. \n\nThen, the while loop increments the last k elements (starting from the end) until sk is zero.\n\nWait, in the first loop:\n\nThe code starts from the end (idx = n -1 [since in Java zero-based, the last index is n-1]), and increments ans[idx] and idx-- and sk--, until sk reaches zero. \n\nThis effectively distributes the sk (remaining after initializing to l) to the last k elements. Each time the index is in n -1, n-2, etc., adding 1 to each until sk=0.\n\nBut the code is written as \"idx >= n -k\" so:\n\nWait, because in the loop condition \"while (sk >0 && idx >= n -k) \".\n\nWait the first loop's while (sk > 0) loops over { increase index from n-1 down, and per step, decrease sk until sk is zero }\n\nWait n -k is for the starting point: the k elements are to be updated (since starting from the last element, which is the first of the k elements in the last positions). \n\nWait n -k gives the first index of the k elements if considering the last k elements.\n\nBecause in Java (zero-based), if we have n elements, and k of them are the last elements, then their indices are from (n -k) to n-1. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So for the first index of the k elements in the last k, would be n -k + 1 ?\n\nWait, maybe. So in the loop, the condition in Fortran must be adjusted for 1-based.\n\nTherefore, need to adjust the indices.\n\nNow, step by step translating the loops.\n\nFirst, for the first loop: distributing sk to the last k elements.\n\nIn Java:\n\nint idx = n - 1;\n\nwhile (sk>0 && idx >= n - k) {\n\n ans[idx]++;\n\n sk--;\n\n idx--;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran, arrays start at 1, so the indices would be 1 to n.\n\nThe first element of the last 'k' elements is located at position (n -k + 1). The initial idx is n (since in Fortran, it's 1-based: last index is n).\n\nSo the loop in Fortran would be something like:\n\nidx = n\n\ndo while ( sk > 0 )\n\n   do while ( idx >= (n-k+1) .AND. sk > 0 )\n\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1\n\n      sk = sk -1\n\n      idx = idx -1\n\n   end do\n\n   ... ?\n\nWait no, the original has the outer loop and inner loop structure. Wait in the Java code, the while loop controlling sk >0, and the inner loop decrements idx until reaches n-k?\n\nWait, no. Let me look again:\n\nWait in Java:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {\n\n   int idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk>0 && idx>= n -k) {\n\n       ans[idx]++ \n\n       sk--;\n\n       idx--;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait no, sorry my mistake. The code in the original first loop is:\n\nwhile (sk >0) {  // Loop 1\n\n   int idx = n-1;\n\n   while (sk >0 && idx >= n-k) {  // Loop 2\n\n      ans[idx]++; \n\n      sk--;\n\n      idx -=1;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, each time Loop1 repeats, it re-sets 'idx' to n-1, and then moves backward from the end, until idx reaches n-k (exclusive?), adding 1 to ans[idx] each time, but stopping if idx is less than n-k or sk is zero. But that might not be the most efficient, because after the first iteration of Loop1, you go all the way from n-1 down to n-k, then repeat. \n\nWait actually, the outer loop (while sk>0) is being run once for each increment in any position. Wait, perhaps it's more efficient to just have a loop over each needed index and distribute the sk over the last k elements in reverse order. But perhaps the code does exactly that.\n\nWait the way it works is in the first loop:\n\nWhenever sk is positive, you start from the end (last element of the array) and go backward, increasing the value of the element until either sk is zero or you've gone through all k elements.\n\nThis might be repeating until sk is exhausted. But if sk can't be distributed entirely in the first iteration.\n\nAlternatively, the code may distribute sk into the elements in reverse order (starting from the last) as much as possible. \n\nBut the translation to Fortran needs to reflect that.\n\nSo in Fortran, loop variables:\n\nIn the outer \"while sk > 0\" loop:\n\nBut in Fortran, we can have do loops or while style. We can use a DO loop with an IF to exit.\n\nAlternatively, use a DO WHILE loop.\n\nThe code in Fortran's getPoints function would have:\n\n   ... after setting initial ans = l\n\n   sAll = sAll_input - ( sk_input + (n -k)* l )\n\n   sk_local = sk_input - k*l \n\n   // Wait, the Java code does:\n\n   sk -= k*l \n\n   so in the code:\n\n   The variable sk in the method is indeed the parameter. So in the java code:\n\n   they first subtract (sk + (n -k)*l ) from sAll.\n\n   Then the next line: \n\n   sk -= k*l \u2192 which is sk = sk (input) - k * l.\n\nBecause, the k elements (the last k if the last variable being adjusted) were initially set to l, so their initial contribution to the sum is k*l. Hence, sk (the desired total for these elements) must be at least k*l, so this sk adjustment gives the remainder to distribute.\n\nThus, sk = desired_k_sum - k*l.\n\nSo in Fortran, need to handle that:\n\n   sk = sk - (k*l) \n\n   where sk here is the sk parameter passed in.\n\nWait no, in Fortran, since the parameters can be named similarly, perhaps:\n\nWithin the function:\n\nsAll = sAll - ( sk + (n -k)*l )\n\nWait variables like sAll and sk here will be local variables initialized as the parameters. Wait in Java, inside the getPoints method, the parameters are passed, but in the code as written, they are reassigning the parameters. Which is allowed, but in Java parameters are passed by value, so any modification inside the method isn't visible outside.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nInside the method:\n\npublic static int[] getPoints(int n, int k, int l, int r, int sAll, int sk)\n\nSo the local variables n, k, l, etc are parameters. Then:\n\nint sAll = sAll - ... ?\n\nWait no, no. Wait inside the method:\n\nThe variables are the parameters. So sAll here refers to the parameter variable, which holds the value passed into the function. So the code:\n\nsAll -= ... \u2192 this changes sAll.\n\nSimilarly for sk subtraction.\n\nSo the parameters are shadowing their values, but since they are just local copies, it's okay.\n\nIn Fortran, functions have parameters declared in their interfaces. Since we can have local variables with the same name, perhaps the code can do the same.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, use parameter names and temporary variables.\n\nWait, in the function's declaration:\n\nFUNCTION getPoints(n_in, k_in, l_in, r_in, sAll_in, sk_in) RESULT(ans)\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n_in, k_in, l_in, r_in, sAll_in, sk_in\n   INTEGER :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n   ...\n END FUNCTION\n\nBut better to just use the parameters:\n\nBut let me restate, in Fortran, the code can:\n\nstart with:\n\nFUNCTION getPointsF(n, k, l_val, r, sAll_val, sk_val) RESULT(ans)\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n, k, l_val, r, sAll_val, sk_val\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(n) :: ans\n  INTEGER :: i, idx, sAll, sk\n\n  ans = l_val\n  sAll = sAll_val - sk_val - (n - k)* l_val \n  sk = sk_val - k * l_val \n\n  idx = n\n  DO WHILE ( sk > 0 )\n     idx = n\n     DO \n        IF ( idx < (n -k + 1) ) EXIT  ! since 1-based, last elements are n -k +1 to n\n        IF ( sk <= 0 ) EXIT\n        ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n        sk = sk -1\n        idx = idx -1\n     END DO\n  END DO\n\nWait wait, the loop structure? Let me think again.\n\nThe original Java code has while (sk >0) loop, and inside:\n\n   set idx to end (n-1 in Java = n in Fortran?), wait no, in Java's code, the idx is starting at n-1 (Java array is zero-based). Converting to 1-based: the first element is 1, so the last element is n. So starting at idx =n in Fortran.\n\nWait let's translate the Java code part by part.\n\nJava code's first loop after initial setup:\n\nwhile (sk > 0) {\n\n   int idx = n - 1;\n\n   while ( sk>0 && idx >= (n -k) ) {\n\n       ans[ idx ]++;\n\n        sk--;\n\n        idx--;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, so inside the outer loop, each iteration starts at the next element?\n\nBecause each outer iteration starts from the end again, moving backward. So this way, you may distribute the sk increment up to sk times in the least possible elements (the last ones).\n\nWait but it's a bit inefficient way to distribute sk into the last k elements. \n\nAnother way: The inner loop runs while sk>0 and within the last k elements. Each iteration of the outer loop makes a pass over the last k elements, adding 1 to each element and subtract 1 from sk per step.\n\nWait, but if in the inner loop we adjust from the end, but then the outer loop might be repeating passes over them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that code is trying to increment each element one step at a time in reverse order until sk runs out.\n\nThe code's approach is to start with the indices in reverse (from the last element) and distribute each needed increment to each position as you step backward until sk is gone.\n\nWait each step of the inner loop (sk, idx...)\n\nIf you have sk=5, then:\n\nFirst iteration of outer loop:\n\nset idx = n-1 (Java) \u2192 (Fortran n).\n\ninside the inner loop:\n\ncheck if sk>0 (yes, 5) and idx >= (n -k).\n\nSince we're starting at n.\n\nso ans[idx] +=1 \u2192 sk decreases by1 (now 4, then idx n-1 (Fortran index)\n\nThen repeat, check again:\n\nidx is now n-1, is it >= n-k?\n\n(n-1) >= (n -k) \u21d2 which is (when )> n -k would be (n-1 >= n -k \u2192 -1 >= -k \u2192 k-1>=0, which is true if k> 0, which it is.\n\nSo next iteration: ans(idx)=n-1 is increased, sk becomes 3, and idx becomes n-2.\n\nrepeat this until idx is lower than n-k?\n\nThe inner loop will increment each position once, starting from the end, moving backward until sk is exhausted.\n\nWait, with sk=5, and k=3:\n\nSuppose n=5, k=3: last three elements (elements 3,4,5? Wait no n=5's Last 3 indices in java (0-based) are 2,3,4 (indices). \n\nWait perhaps the code is distributing the sk value incrementing the last k elements in reverse order (from the last to first of the k elements), adding 1 per each step until sk runs out.\n\nSo in total, each of the last k elements can be increased as much as sk allows in a circular way? Not sure, but the original code in Java does this.\n\nNow, translating this loop into Fortran:\n\nFirst:\n\nIn the inner loop in Fortran:\n\noriginal Java's code:\n\nn is the original array length. \n\nJava's idx is set initially to n-1 (the last element in 0-based array).\n\nThe condition is while (sk>0) && idx >= (n-k)\n\n(n is the array length; (n -k) in Java would be the first index of the last k elements: because n-k to n-1 (zero-based) correspond to the last k elements).\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are 1-based:\n\nSuppose the array is from 1 to n.\n\nThe first index of the last k elements is (n -k + 1). The last is n.\n\nThus, the condition in Fortran would be:\n\n(idx >= n -k + 1) instead of (n -k).\n\nThus, in the inner loop condition:\n\nIn Java: idx >= (n -k) (zero-based, because (n -k to n -1): the first element of the last k elements).\n\nIn Fortran's terms, the last k elements start at n -k + 1:\n\nFor example, n=5, k=3 \u2192 elements 3,4,5?\n\nWait yes: n=5, k=3:\n\nn-k +1 =5-3 +1 =3 \u2192 indices 3,4,5. Correct.\n\nThus:\n\nThe condition should be (idx >= (n -k +1)) in Fortran.\n\nThus, in the inner loop:\n\nThe Java code's loop condition is:\n\nwhile (sk>0 && idx >= (n -k)) \u2192 but Fortran has to use (n -k +1).\n\nThus, the Fortran code would:\n\n   DO WHILE ( sk > 0 ) \n      idx = n  ! last element\n      ! loop until the first of the last k elements\n      DO \n         IF ( idx < (n -k +1 ) ) EXIT\n         IF ( sk <=0 ) EXIT\n         ans( idx ) = ans( idx ) +1\n         sk = sk -1\n         idx = idx -1\n      END DO\n   END DO\n\nWait the indices are moving backward from n down to (n -k +1). Each iteration of the inner loop process one element: decrement idx each step.\n\nWait the loop is structured as a DO loop that has to exit under two conditions:\n\nEither sk becomes zero or the index reaches n -k + 1.\n\nBut in the structure here, the first condition in code is checked and we exit when either is true.\n\nWait but in the code above, in the DO loop:\n\nEach time, processed:\n\nDecrement the sk and add 1 to ans(idx), then subtract one from idx (so moving left).\n\nWait, but the structure is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, unroll it as:\n\n   DO WHILE ( sk > 0 ):\n\n      idx = n\n\n      DO WHILE ( (idx >= (n -k + 1)) .AND. (sk > 0) ) \n\n          ans(idx) = ans(idx) + 1\n\n          sk = sk -1\n\n          idx = idx -1 \n\n      END DO \n\n   END DO \n\nWait, but the outer loop is to repeat until sk is 0. The inner loop performs any increments possible. Wait, but in the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will keep going until either the sk runs out, or idx reaches n -k.\n\nWait, but in the first inner loop iteration (outer loop has sk>0), you process the last k elements, increasing each one by one as much as possible.\n\nWait, but maybe one full pass of the last k elements. \n\nWait for example, if sk is 5 and there are 3 elements in the last group:\n\nThe inner loop would:\n\nans(5) +=1 (sk=4), then idx 4, then 3: each increases. So by step through idx 5 down to 3 (since n-k+1=3 (for k=3, n=5). So after first inner loop pass, sk reduces by 3 (total steps 5?). \n\nWait suppose sk is 5:\n\nFirst iteration of outer loop: the inner loop runs while idx>=3 and sk>0.\n\nStarts at idx=5:\n\nsk 5 \u2192 decrease to 4, idx4.\n\nidx4 >=3 \u2192 yes:\n\nDecrease sk to 3 \u2192 idx3.\n\nidx3 ==3 \u2192 yes:\n\nDecrease to 2, idx2.\n\nNow index is 2, which is <3 \u2192 exit inner loop.\n\nThus, in this pass, sk has decreased by 3 (1 each for elements5, 4,3). Thus sk is now 2.\n\nThen, we loop again: outer loop continues as sk>0? yes.\n\nReset idx to n=5 again, now do inner loop again:\n\nsk is 2.\n\nAt first step, ans(5) again becomes +1 (now 3?), sk becomes 1.\n\nThen decrement to idx4 \u2192 sk 1 decreased to 0. Then idx3.\n\nNow, the loop condition sk is now 0 \u2192 exit inner loop.\n\nThus, after 2nd pass:\n\nThe last three elements:\n\nelements5: +2 (in first pass +1, second pass +1 \u2192 total +2)\n\nelements4: +1 (first pass) +1 ( second pas no, because after first increment on 5, sk is 5-3 (first pass) then added back, no \u2192 wait let's see step precisely:\n\nWait after first inner loop pass:\n\nFirst inner loop step (first outer iteration):\n\nsk starts at sk, after first pass it becomes sk -3.\n\nSecond outer iteration:\n\nOuter loop's sk value is 5 \u2192 first pass's sk reduced to 5-3 = 2.\n\nWait sorry, initial total sk is 5. after first pass:\n\n5\u21925-3=2 (after adding 5th,4th,3rd elements). \n\nThen outer loop continues, sk =2>0 \u2192 so inner loop again:\n\nidx =5 (starting new iteration), and then:\n\nans(5) increments again \u2192 sk=1.\n\nthen idx4:\n\nans(4) increases \u2192 sk=0.\n\nthen the loop condition sk becomes 0 \u2192 break.\n\nSo sk is 0, loop stops. \n\nThus, final distribution for the k elements (3) has been:\n\nANS[5] +=2 (the last element), ans[4] +=2 (since in first pass got +1, then again +1), and ans[3] +=1. (only once). Wait no:\n\nWait let's track:\n\nFirst iteration of inner loop in outer loop first run:\n\nelements5,4,3 each get +1. sk becomes5-3=2.\n\nSecond iteration of outer loop:\n\nthen inner loop starts:\n\nidx=5 \u2192 ans5+1 \u2192 sk is now 1.\n\nidx4 \u2192 ans4+1 \u2192 sk=0.\n\nthen idx3 \u2192 check: sk is 0 \u2192 loop exits here.\n\nSo the third element (3) doesn't get another increment. \n\nBut element4 did get an additional increment. \n\nHence, the next element after the first pass:\n\nelements 5: 2 increments \n\nelement4: 2 increments\n\nelement3: 1 increment.\n\nTotal sk= 3 in first pass (reducing from 5 to 2), then second pass took 2 more (from 2 \u21920). So total of 5.\n\nThus the code's loops distribute the sk in a way that the last elements get first increments on each pass until sk is exhausted. So it's like adding 1 to each element in reverse order per pass until done.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the first loop should be written as such.\n\nThen the second loop (after distributing the k elements), then the remaining sAll is distributed to the non-k elements? \n\nLooking at the java code after the first loop comes the:\n\nwhile (sAll >0) { \n\n   int idx=0; \n\n   while ( sAll>0 && idx < (n -k) )\n\n      ans[idx]++;\n\n      sAll--;\n\n      idx++;\n\n}\n\nThe code here seems to distribute the remaining sAll to the elements before the last k elements (the first n-k elements), incrementing them as long as there is sAll left.\n\nTranslating to Fortran:\n\nThe java loop starts from index 0 (the first element), and the condition is to process elements with index < (n -k)), which is the first (n -k) elements in 0-based terms. \n\nIn Fortran, the first element is 1. The indices to process are 1 to (n -k) (since n -k is the count, so indices up to (n -k) ).\n\nWait in Java:\n\n(n -k) is the first part: the non-k elements are the first (n -k) elements (indices 0 to n-k-1).\n\nSo in Fortran, the first part elements are indices 1 downto (n-k).\n\nWait no, the number of non-k elements is (n -k), so their indices are from 1 to (n -k).\n\nThus the Fortran loop would start at idx =1, and go up to (n -k).\n\nWait in the Java second loop: the while loop:\n\nidx starts at 0 (Java) \u2192 first element (Fortran 1).\n\nIncrements while sAll is >0, and idx < (n-k).\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition is (idx <= (n-k) )\n\nBecause:\n\noriginal java's index is < (n-k), meaning indices [0, n-k-1].\n\nIn Fortran, we need to loop for idx from 1 to (n -k).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nDO WHILE ( sAll > 0 )\n   idx = 1\n   DO\n      IF ( idx > (n -k) ) EXIT\n      IF (sAll <=0 ) EXIT\n      ans(idx) = ans(idx) +1 \n      sAll = sAll -1\n      idx = idx +1\n   END DO\nEND DO \n\nWait the loop structure is similar to the first loop.\n\nWait, but the same reasoning:\n\nStarting at the first element (1) and moving forward.\n\nEach outer loop run fills the first (n-k) elements increments one each as much as possible.\n\nWait let me take an example. Suppose sAll remaining after the previous steps is 5:\n\nn is 5. n-k=2 (so non-k elements are 2, indices 1 and 2).\n\nThen, first inner loop:\n\nidx starts at 1. Until (idx <=2 and sAll >0).\n\nFirst step:\n\nans[1] gets +1 (sAll now4 \u2192 5-1).\n\nidx becomes2 \u2192 sAll 4-1=3.\n\nidx increments to 3, which is beyond 2 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nThis inner loop contributed 2 increments (to idx1 and 2).\n\nNow sAll is 3.\n\nThen the loop repeats:\n\nThe outer loop again (while sAll>0):\n\nreset idx to1.\n\nans[1] +1 \u2192 sAll=2.\n\nans[2] +1 \u2192 sAll=1.\n\nNow idx becomes3 \u2192 exit.\n\n sAll is 1.\n\nLoop again:\n\nStart at1 \u2192 ans[1] +=1 (sAll becomes0).\n\n Then, remaining sAll is zero. \n\nExit outer loop.\n\nSo the total increments are 3 added to ans[1], 2 to ans[2].\n\nHence distributing all 5 in two passes (initial pass of 2 each, then one more on first element). \n\nThis makes sense.\n\nThus, the code is correct in the way it loops.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nThe second loop's code is the above.\n\nNow, structuring the code:\n\nNow, putting it all together in Fortran function.\n\nFirst the function definition.\n\nWait need to account for parameter passing and result.\n\nFUNCTION getPoints(n, k, l, r, sAll, sk)RESULT(ans) ! a that returns the array\n\nOkay, building the code step by step.\n\nAlso, note variables:\n\nJava variables:\n\n- The array ans is filled with l's.\n\n- sAll is the parameter sAll (input), then adjusted with the first line.\n\nWait:\n\nIn Java, after initializing the array to l, the first line in getPoints:\n\nsAll -= sk + (n -k)* l \n\nWait the variables here are:\n\nThe passed parameters sAll and sk. \n\nAssuming the function is given:\n\nParameters: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\nLocal variables:\n\ninside the function:\n\n   - ans array initialized to all l's.\n\n   - sAll is modified here.\n\n   - sk is modified.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we'll need to have local variables for sAll and sk.\n\nLike:\n\nFUNCTION getPoints(n, k, l, r, sAll_total, sk_param)RESULT(ans)\n\n   ... variables with names like sAll_local and sk_local ?\n\nWait to avoid confusion between the input parameters and the modified variables.\n\nAlternatively, use parameters and shadow the names. Or use different names.\n\nWait perhaps rename the parameters to avoid conflict. Let me think.\n\nThus, the Fortran function:\n\nFUNCTION getPointsF(n_p, k_p, l_p, r_p, sAll_p, sk_p)RESULT(ans)\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n_p, k_p, l_p, r_p, sAll_p, sk_p\n    INTEGER :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n    INTEGER, DIMENSION(n_p) :: ans\n    ! body\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait better to re-assign parameters to local variables to keep the same naming. Let's see:\n\nBut actually:\n\nInside the function:\n\nans = l_p (all elements set to l_p)\n\nsAll = sAll_p - sk_p - (n_p - k_p)* l_p \n\nsk = sk_p - k_p*l_p \n\nThen proceed with the loops.\n\nThus, variables 'sAll' and 'sk' here are local variables, initialized from the parameters.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the function can have:\n\nFUNCTION getPointsF(n_in, k_in, l_in, r_in, sAll_in, sk_in)RESULT(ans)\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n_in, k_in, l_in, r_in, sAll_in, sk_in\n   INTEGER, DIMENSION(n_in) :: ans\n   INTEGER :: sAll, sk, idx ! sAll and sk are local variables initialized from parameters.\n\n   !

The java code has an 'r' parameter but it's unused in the code. But the function in the java code has 'r' as a parameter. Perhaps the code is incomplete. Or in the code provided, the 'r' is not used in any of the steps, so perhaps a mistake in the code?\n\nLooking back at the original question's Java code:\n\nThe Java method's signature is:\n\npublic static int[] getPoints(int n, int k, int l, int r, int sAll, int sk) \n\nThe parameters include r (int r = scan.nextInt()), but it's not used in the code of getPoints.\n\nThus in the provided code, the variables 'r' is present but not used. That's might be an error, but since the code is given, we have to include it. However, the Fortran code can just include it as a parameter, even though it's not used. The user's question requires to translate the given code, whether it's correct or not.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, we have to accept the r parameter, but not use it.\n\nThus, the function's formal parameter list includes r_in but it's not used.\n\nNow, testing:\n\nWait, but what about the constraints?\n\nThe Java code doesn't use r. So perhaps it's a mistake, but the problem statement might require the r.\n\nBut since we have to translate as per the provided Java code, which doesn't use r, then the Fortran code will have r as a parameter but it won't be used.\n\nNow, checking the print statement in the main function.\n\nJava's main method does:\n\nfor (int num : ans) \u2192 System.out.print(num + \" \");\n\nIn Fortran, after calling the function to get the array ans, the main program can write the array directly:\n\nwrite(*,*) (ans, i=1, n)\n\nor the format may need a space between elements. Alternatively:\n\nDo i =1, n\n\n   write (unit=*, fmt=*, advance='no') ans(i), ' '\n\nWait, but using write(*,*) for the array will do space-separated values.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the syntax for printing is:\n\nwrite(*,*) (ans, i=1, n)\n\nWait, ans is the array, but in array form. So writing like:\n\nwrite(*,*) ans \n\nWill print all elements separated by spaces.\n\nWhich the Java code does. (Though note that the Java code's for loop adds a space after each element, including last; but the print will have a trailing space, which is allowed.)\n\nThus, the main program in Fortran would be:\n\nPROGRAM CF369B\n\n   ! declarations\n\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n\n   INTEGER :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   INTEGER, DIMENSION( : ), ALLOCATABLE :: ans \n\n   ! read inputs\n   READ(*,*) n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n\n   ! call the function\n   ans = getPointsF(n, k, l, r, sAll, sk)\n\n   ! print the array\n   WRITE(*,*) ans \n\nEND PROGRAM\n\nWait but the function's return is an array of size n, pass via the function. \n\nWait in Fortran, when we write ans = getPointsF(...) the function must return the array of size n. Thus, the function's declaration must have the proper interface for the main program to have a compatible definition.\n\nThus, the main program and the function need to have the function's interface visible.\n\nThus, the way to do this properly is to either use a module that contains the function, or to have the function defined in the same file as the main program.\n\nThus, consolidating the code, perhaps define the function in the main program's scope.\n\nAlternatively, as an internal function in the program.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nMODULE mymodule \nCONTAINS \n\nFUNCTION getPointsF(n_in, k_in, l_in, r_in, sAll_in, sk_in)RESULT(ans) \n! etc.\nEND FUNCTION\n\nEND MODULE \n\nThen the main program uses the module.\n\nAlternatively, place the function inside the main program as an internal function.\n\nThus, this would allow the code to be in a single file.\n\nLet me proceed to use the internal function structure.\n\nThus, the Fortran code:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_369_B\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n\n   INTEGER :: n, k, l, r, sAll, sk\n   INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: ans(:)\n   !

Since in Fortran, when you assign a scalar to an array, it sets each element to the scalar. That's correct.\n\nTesting the code in an example.\n\nLet me take a simple test case.\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n3 1 1 10 6 2 \n\nSo:\n\nn=3, k=1 (only one element in the k group. For example, the focus is to have that one element, say the last one, sum to sk=2 (the desired sum for k elements).\n\nl =1, so initial array is [1,1,1]\n\nThen step:\n\nCompute:\n\nsAll =6 (input sAll_total) - sk_p (2) - (3-1)*1 \u2192 (6-2- (2)) = 6-4=2 \n\nThe first step for sk assignment: \n\nsk initial = sk_p =2\n\nsk = 2 - 1*1 \u21922-1=1 ?\n\nWait wait.\n\nWait the code in the Java function's line:\n\n sk = sk_p (input parameter) - k_p*l_p \n\n wait the code in java has:\n\n sk -= k*l; \n\nSo sk is the parameter passed (sk_in is the 6th parameter). For the parameters listed here, when the sk parameter comes in, the code does sk -=k*l.\n\nIn the example, sk is 2 (the input).\n\nk is 1, l is 1 \u2192 sk becomes 2 -1*1 \u2192 1.\n\nThus the first part after initialization is:\n\nans array is [1,1,1]. \n\nThen sAll (local variable) is computed as (6) - 2 (the sk parameter is 2?) Wait let me recheck:\n\nWait variables:\n\nIn the function's sAll computation in the example:\n\nthe parameters for getPointF are:\n\nsAll_p is the sAll input variable which here is 6.\n\nThus:\n\nsAll = sAll_p (6) - sk_p (2) - (n_p -k_p)*l_p \n\n(3-1)*1 =2 \u2192 so total is 6 -2 -2 \u2192 2.\n\nThe sk becomes:\n\nsk parameter (2) -1*1 \u21921.\n\nSo the first loop distributes sk=1 to the last k_p =1 element (the third element).\n\nRunning the first loop:\n\nsk is 1.\n\nThe first while (sk>0) is yes.\n\nThe loop sets idx=3 (the last element, as n_p is 3).\n\nin the inner loop:\n\nidx 3 >= (3 -1 +1) \u2192 (3-1+1) is 3 \u2192 yes.\n\n thus, ans(3) is increased by 1 (now 2). Subtract sk to zero.\n\nso after inner loop, sk is 0 \u2192 outer loop exits.\n\nThe remaining in the second loop is sAll is 2.\n\nThen:\n\nthe second loop, distributing sAll to the first n-k elements (3-1=2 elements, indices1 and 2).\n\nThe DO WHILE(sAll>0). Initially sAll is 2>0.\n\nFirst outer pass:\n\nidx begins at 1.\n\ninner loop:\n\nidx=1 <=2 (since n-k=2, thus 2.\n\n process:\n\nans(1) +=1 \u2192 becomes 2.\n\nsAll is now 1.\n\nThen idx becomes2:\n\nans(2) +=1 becomes2.\n\nsAll=0.\n\n idx\u21923, which exceeds 2 \u2192 exit the inner loop.\n\n Thus after first pass of outer loop, sAll is now 0. \n\nThus, the final array is: [2,2,2].\n\n total array sum is 2+2+2=6, sAll_total was6.\n\nThe sAll started as 2, and after allocation:\n\nThe first two elements gained 1 each (adding 2 to total: initial 3, plus 2 gives 5, plus the last element's +1 \u2192 sum is 6.\n\nThe k elements (the third) has a total value of 2, which matches sk. \n\nThus the coded function works.\n\nHence this code should be correct.\n\nNow, checking the allocation of ans in the main program.\n\nThe function returns an array of size n_p (passed parameter).\n\nIn the main program, ans is declared as allocatable but when we call ans = getPointsF(...), Fortran allows the array to be automatically allocated. Since the function's return array has a size of n_p, which is an input parameter. \n\nHowever, the function returns the array as per the dimensions. But in the function, the array is stored in an array with dimension (n_p), and the result is an array of n_p elements, hence ans in the main program can be initialized this way.\n\nThus the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for possible off-by-one errors.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nExample: \n\nInput:\n\n3 2 1 10 6 4\n\nHere's what happens:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\nThus, the last 2 elements are the focus (k elements).\n\nInitial array: [1,1,1]\n\nsAll = input 6 -4 (the sk parameter) - (3-2)*1 \u21926-4 -1 \u21921?\n\nWait let's compute:\n\nWait the first part:\n\nsAll = sAll_p (6) - sk_p (4) - (n_p -k_p)*l_p \u2192 (3-2)*1 =1 \u2192 6-4=2 \u2192 2-1=1 ?\n\nYes: 6-4=2, minus 1 gives 1.\n\nsk is the sk parameter (4) minus k*l (2*1=2 \u21924-2= 2.\n\nThus, sk is 2.\n\nThese 2 need to be allocated to the last two elements (indices 2 and 3).\n\nFirst loop:\n\nDistribute sk=2.\n\nThe loop:\n\nidx starts at 3 (last element)\n\nFirst iteration: \n\nidx\u22652 (n-k_p+1 =3-2+1= 2 \u2192 yes. \n\n ans(3) increases by1 \u2192 to 2. sk now 1.\n\n idx becomes2 \u2192 which is >=2 \u2192 ans[2]=2 \u2192 sk 0. \n\n Thus sk is now zero. \n\n Thus, ans now is [1,2,2]. \n\nThen remaining sAll is 1.\n\nThe second loop:\n\ndistributing sAll =1 to the first n-k_p =1 elements (indices 1).\n\nstarting with loop outer: sAll is 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nindex=1 \u2192 within 1 (n-k_p=1).\n\n ans(1) increments to 2. \n\n sAll now to zero.\n\n Thus, the final array is [2,2,2].\n\n their sum is 6, as desired.\n\n The last two elements (indices 2 and3) sum to 4 (2+2) \u2192 which matches sk=4. \n\nThus the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, write the Fortran code properly.\n\nFinal notes: The \"ans\" in the print statement must also be 1-based, but that's handled automatically in Fortran.\n\nThe code for the Fortran program should look like this:"
