Wait in the Java code, the first revpos is called with p = position[0], q = position[1]. So in Fortran, position(0,:) and position(1,:), yes. Therefore, position(2,:) = revpos(position(0,:), position(1,:))\n\nWait but in Fortran, array sections are done with the : operator. But functions can accept arrays as arguments, so the function would have to take in the entire array (or part of it) correctly. Wait so in Fortran, the function revpos is declared as taking arrays of 0:1. So when passing position(0,:), the array is from 0 to 1 indices, so that should work. Wait the function's argument is p, which is an array(0:1, intent(in)), so that must be passed correctly. So the calls:\n\nposition(2,:) = revpos(position(0,:), position(1,:))\n\nWait in Fortran, assigning an array section like that works if the function returns an array. But assigning to position(2,:) where that's part of a 2D array with 0:3 rows and 0:1 columns, then that would require the right-hand side being a rank 1 array. Yes, that should work. Then position(3,:) = revpos(position(1,:), position(2,:))\n\nThen comes the check: if (position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3])), which in Java compares references?",

    "original_reasoning": "Alright, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the code does first. \n\nThe Java code has a method called revpos which takes two integer arrays, calculates some transformations between them, and returns a new array. The main method reads four integers from input, sets up positions, uses revpos to compute new positions, checks a condition, then outputs some numbers.\n\nTranslating this to Fortran requires understanding how to handle arrays, functions, and input/output in Fortran compared to Java.\n\nFirst, looking at the revpos function. In Java, it takes p and q, computes their difference into vec, then swaps the components and negates one, then adds to q to get newpos. In Fortran, functions can return arrays, so I need a function that takes two integer arrays (of size 2 each) and returns an array of integers of size 2. The arrays in Fortran are 1-based or can be 0-based, but Java uses 0-based, so maybe I'll keep it 0-based for consistency?\n\nWait, Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, but you can set lower bounds. Hmm, but maybe the indices in the code are better done 0-based? Let me see. Alternatively, since arrays in the Java code are 0-based, I can define the Fortran arrays with indices from 0 to 1. But in Fortran, array indices start at 1 unless declared otherwise, so perhaps I'll adjust them to 1-based? Or maybe stick to 0-based to avoid confusion. Alternatively, since the problem's variables p and q are used in positions like [0], [1], I'll have to use 0-based arrays for consistency. Therefore, I should declare arrays with dimension 0:1. For example, integer, dimension(0:1) :: vec. That way, the indices will match the Java code's usage.\n\nThen, the function revpos in Fortran will be a function returning an array 0:1. The first thing: subtract the elements of q from p. That would be vec(0) = p(0) - q(0), etc. Then, swap and negate. The step \"vec[0] = vec[1]; vec[1] = -tmp\" in Java translates to tmp = vec(0); vec(0) = vec(1); vec(1) = -tmp; Wait no, in Java's code:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nvec[0] = p[0] - q[0];\nvec[1] = p[1] - q[1];\ntmp = vec[0];\nvec[0] = vec[1];\nvec[1] = -tmp;\n\nWait, that 2nd part is temporary code. Let's re-express:\n\nAfter subtraction, original vec's elements are (vec0_old, vec1_old). Then, the code swaps them and negates the first:\n\nWait let's retrace:\n\nOriginal:\n\nint tmp = vec[0]\nvec[0] = vec[1]\nvec[1] = -tmp\n\nSo after the swap and negation, the new vec is (vec1_old, -vec0_old). That is, the vector is rotated 90 degrees perhaps? Because this transformation is part of the calculation here.\n\nThen newpos[i] = q[i] + vec[i], so the resulting newpos is q plus this transformed vector.\n\nHmm, okay, so in Fortran code:\n\nFUNCTION revpos(p, q) RESULT(newpos)\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:1), INTENT(IN) :: p, q\n  INTEGER :: tmp\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:1) :: newpos\n  INTEGER :: vec(0:1)\n  vec(0) = p(0) - q(0)\n  vec(1) = p(1) - q(1)\n  tmp = vec(0)\n  vec(0) = vec(1)\n  vec(1) = -tmp\n  newpos(0) = q(0) + vec(0)\n  newpos(1) = q(1) + vec(1)\nEND FUNCTION revpos\n\nWait that's probably the right way to structure it.\n\nNow, the Main program in Java. Let's parse step by step.\n\nThe main reads four numbers into input. The input is stored as [0,0] (input[0], input[1]) then [2][3] as position[0] and [1], then computes position 2 and 3 via the revpos function.\n\nThe array position in Java is 2x2 array. In Fortran, position can be a 2x2 array with dimensions (4,2) maybe? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nJava's position is declared as int[4][2], with each element being a 2-element array. In Fortran, I need a two-dimensional array of shape (4,2). But perhaps using 0-based indexing again.\n\nBut in Fortran, if using 0-based, we can declare the array as dimension(0:3,0:1). Then the elements are position(0,0), position(0,1), position(1,0), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe translate as Fortran's natural 1-based.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the code has position[0] which is initialized with input[0] and [1], position[1] with input [2], [3], whereas the array is:\n\nposition[0] is {input[0], input[1]}\n\nposition[1] is {input[2], input[3]}\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, if I use 1D arrays:\n\nWait perhaps it's better to use indices 0 to 3 for the four positions, each with 2 components. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3, 0:1) :: position\n\nThen:\n\nposition(0,0) = input(0)\n\nposition(0,1) = input(1)\n\nposition(1,0) = input(2)\n\nposition(1,1) = input(3)\n\nBut in Fortran arrays, the first index is the row, second is the column. Hmm, not a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions can be stored as an array with first dimension for the position index (0 to 3) and second for coordinates (0 and 1). So that would work.\n\nNow, how to read the input. In Fortran, to read from standard input using an array, perhaps read as variables.\n\nThe Java code does:\n\ninput = new int[4], then loops 4 times. So in Fortran:\n\nINTEGER :: input(0:3)\n\nread(*,*) input(0), input(1), input(2), input(3)\n\nWait, but input is 0-based? Let me see.\n\nWait the variables: input in Java is size 4 (indices 0-3). So the input is four integers. So in Fortran:\n\nread(*,*) input(0), input(1), input(2), input(3)\n\nAlternatively, if the first input item is stored in input(1), Fortran's default 1-based, but for consistency, perhaps use 0-based. But since arrays in Fortran can be declared with dimension, maybe that's better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use 1-based for coordinates, but arrange it so that the indices match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code can be written with 1-based arrays except for when the indices in java are 0-based.\n\nHmm, perhaps using 1-based arrays but adjusting variables accordingly, but that could lead to confusion. Alternatively just go for 0-based arrays in Fortran with the syntax:\n\ndimension(0:3) for the input array, and 0:1 for coordinates.\n\nSo, in the program:\n\nINTEGER, DIMENSION(0:3) :: input\n\nBut the code needs 4 elements, which that would cover.\n\nNow, the program flow:\n\nRead 4 numbers into input.\n\nInitialize position array:\n\nposition(0,0) = input(0)\n\nposition(0,1) = input(1)\n\nposition(1,0) = input(2)\n\nposition(1,1) = input(3)\n\nThen position(2) is set to revpos(position(0), position(1)). Here, position(0) and (1) are arrays, so when passing them to the function revpos, that's okay.\n\nWait in Fortran, the function revpos takes two arrays of dimension 0:1. So the arguments to revpos will be position(0,:) and position(1,:) ?\n\nWait in the Java code, the first revpos is called with p = position[0], q = position[1]. So in Fortran, position(0,:) and position(1,:), yes.\n\nTherefore, position(2,:) = revpos(position(0,:), position(1,:))\n\nWait but in Fortran, array sections are done with the : operator. But functions can accept arrays as arguments, so the function would have to take in the entire array (or part of it) correctly.\n\nWait so in Fortran, the function revpos is declared as taking arrays of 0:1. So when passing position(0,:), the array is from 0 to 1 indices, so that should work.\n\nWait the function's argument is p, which is an array(0:1, intent(in)), so that must be passed correctly.\n\nSo the calls:\n\nposition(2,:) = revpos(position(0,:), position(1,:))\n\nWait in Fortran, assigning an array section like that works if the function returns an array. But assigning to position(2,:) where that's part of a 2D array with 0:3 rows and 0:1 columns, then that would require the right-hand side being a rank 1 array.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThen position(3,:) = revpos(position(1,:), position(2,:))\n\nThen comes the check: if (position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3])), which in Java compares references? Or is it checking the array elements? Wait the code in Java does:\n\nif ( position[0] == revpos(position[2], position[3]) )\n\nBut in java, the == operator for objects (including arrays) checks if they refer to the same object, not the elements. Wait that must be wrong?\n\nWait in the code, revpos returns an array. So in that if condition in Java, comparing array references via == would not be correct. Because the newpos returned by revpos is a new array, so it can't be equal to position[0], unless position[0] is pointing to that array somehow. But in the code structure, perhaps the user made a mistake here?\n\nWait the problem's code might have a logic error. Maybe it's supposed to be checking whether position[0] is equal to revpos(position[2],position[3]), meaning their elements are the same?\n\nIn Fortran, arrays cannot be compared with a single .eq., so that comparison in the Java code might be wrong, but perhaps in the problem's context we have to translate it directly. Wait but the code's logic must be designed this way. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait the code's if statement in Java is checking whether position[0], which is an object array, is the same as the result of revpos(position[2], position[3]). This would always evaluate to false because revpos creates a new array instance. Unless somehow position[0] and the return are identical arrays, but in the code's logic, that seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps this is a mistake in the original code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem, there's a different approach. Perhaps in the condition, it should be checking equality of the elements. But in Java, you can't do array comparisons, so maybe the code is incorrect. That might be a flaw in the given code, but since we have to translate as per the user instruction, perhaps proceed as if it's correct as written.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to have (position[0] is the same as revpos(...)), but that is not possible unless through some specific conditions. The program's print(\"OK\") depends on that. However, this might be an error in the original code. But since I need to translate it as is, maybe I should replicate this condition.\n\nWait in the code, after setting position[2] = revpos(0,1), position[3] = revpos(1,2). \n\nThen, the calculation revpos(2,3) is computed as revpos(position[2], position[3]). Let's see:\n\nBut in any case, the code's if statement is \n\nif (position[0] == revpos( position[2], position[3] ) {\n\nThis comparison would likely fail in Java, because it's comparing array references.\n\nHence, the code may have an error here, but since the user is asking for a translation, I need to translate it as it is, even if it might be incorrect. However, in Fortran, arrays are not compared via pointers, so how should I handle this condition?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intention is to check whether the array elements are equal. The code may have a logic error here.\n\nWait maybe let's re-examine the Java code:\n\nposition[2] = revpos(position[0], position[1]);\n\nposition[3] = revpos(position[1], position[2]);\n\nThen, revpos(position[2], position[3]) would be a new array.\n\nThen, position[0].equals(revpos( position[2], position[3] )) ?\n\nIn Java, because you can't compare arrays with ==, but the code does use ==, so maybe that would always be false. Hence maybe the program never outputs 'OK', but perhaps it's intentional?\n\nHmm, but the code may have a different intention. Maybe the code should check whether the result of revpos(2,3) is equal to position[0] (elements-wise). If that's the case, then in Java, the correct way would be to loop through each element, but perhaps in the code given, it's written as ==, which is an error. So maybe the problem code is wrong, but the user wants it translated as is.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's logic is different, and I should follow exactly what's given.\n\nTranslating the condition as written, but in Fortran, since there's no object references in arrays, perhaps the comparison would be a different approach. Wait, perhaps in Fortran, the programmer can compare the contents of two arrays using .eq. for each element? \n\nWait in Fortran, testing equality of entire arrays in a scalar context is not possible. But to do so, you need to use all() function combined with .eq. element-wise.\n\nTherefore, the comparison would become:\n\nif (all( position(0,:) == revpos(position(2,:), position(3,:) ) then ...\n\nWait but in the Java code's comparison, the condition is if (position[0] == revpos(...)), which would in correct operation compare references, but as that's not possible in Fortran, perhaps the intended is element-wise compare, so we have to do that.\n\nWas there a misunderstanding in the code's logic? Well, perhaps the code is intended to do array comparisons, so the user might have intended that the returned array from revpos(position[2],position[3]) should be exactly position[0]. Hence, in the Fortran code, I can write this comparision using element-wise equality.\n\nAlternatively, the user may have intended to cast the pointers, but that's impossible. So perhaps the correct way to translate is to compare the vectors' entries.\n\nHence, perhaps the original code has a flaw and the user wants a valid code, but the translation should be accurate to the Java code's structure. So in that case, even if in Java the comparison is a reference, in Fortran, since arrays are not first-class objects, that comparison can't exist, so perhaps the code needs to implement the condition as element-wise equality.\n\nSo I'll proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nThe condition would be:\n\nif( position(0,0) == (revious( position(2,:), position(3,:) ))(0) and position(0,1) == ... )\n\nAlternatively, compute the result and check each component.\n\nSo here's the approach:\n\nLet me compute the temporary variable temp = revpos(position(2,:), position(3,:))\n\nThen, check if position(0,0) == temp(0) and position(0,1) == temp(1)\n\nThen, the 'OK' is printed only if both are true.\n\nHence, in Fortran code:\n\nINTEGER :: temp(0:1)\ntemp = revpos( position(2,:), position(3,:) )\nif( position(0,0) == temp(0) .and. position(0,1) == temp(1) ) then\n    print *, \"OK\"\nend if\n\nOkay, that's how to do that part.\n\nNow, the output part. The output array is created with:\n\noutput[0] = position[2][0], then position[2][1], then position[3][0], position[3][1], then printing each element.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\noutput is an array of 4 elements. So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3) :: output\n\noutput(0) = position(2,0)\n\noutput(1) = position(2,1)\n\noutput(2) = position(3,0)\n\noutput(3) = position(3,1)\n\nThen loop through each element and print.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ndo i = 0, 3\n\n    print *, output(i)\n\nend do\n\nOr use a do loop.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, structuring the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the FUNCTION revpos has to be inside a program or a module. Since it's a helper function, putting it before the main program.\n\nBut in Fortran, the function can be a function inside the program.\n\nAlternatively, use a module.\n\nAlternatively, define the function before main.\n\nBut in standard Fortran, we can have FUNCTION within the main program.\n\nWait in Fortran 90, you can put internal functions inside the program.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC108_B\n\nimplicit none\n\n! declare variables\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3) :: input\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3, 0:1) :: position\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3) :: output\n\n! ... declare inside variables\n\n...\n\n! then read the input:\n\nread(*,*) input\n\nBut since input is 0-based, but read with 4 integers. So perhaps:\n\nreal; read(*,*) (input(i), i=0,3)\n\nIn explicit code:\n\ndo i=0,3\n\n   read (*,*) input(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait but that would read one number each time. Alternatively, read all at once.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(*,*) input(0), input(1), input(2), input(3)\n\nYes.\n\nThen set position first two rows:\n\nposition(0,0) = input(0)\n\nposition(0,1) = input(1)\n\nposition(1,0) = input(2)\n\nposition(1,1) = input(3)\n\nThen compute position(2):\n\nposition(2,0:1) = revpos( position(0,0:1), position(1,0:1) )\n\nWait, or more directly:\n\nposition(2,:) = revpos( position(0,:), position(1,:) )\n\nSame with position(3,:) = revpos(position(1,:), position(2,:) )\n\nThen compute the condition:\n\ncompute temp = revpos( position(2,:), position(3,:) )\n\nthen compare to position(0,:), etc.\n\nWait let's write the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function revpos:\n\nFUNCTION revpos(p, q) RESULT( newpos )\n\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:1), INTENT(IN) :: p, q\n\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:1) :: newpos\n\n  INTEGER :: tmp, vec(0:1)\n\n  vec(0) = p(0) - q(0)\n\n  vec(1) = p(1) - q(1)\n\n  tmp = vec(0)\n\n  vec(0) = vec(1)\n\n  vec(1) = -tmp\n\n  newpos(0) = q(0) + vec(0)\n\n  newpos(1) = q(1) + vec(1)\n\nEND FUNCTION revpos\n\nWait the function returns newpos which is an array. To make this an internal function, place it inside the program.\n\nNow, in the program:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC108_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3) :: input\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3,0:1) :: position\n\ninteger, dimension(0:3) :: output\n\ninteger :: temp(0:1)\n\n! Function revpos defined here\n\ncontains\n\n  FUNCTION revpos(p, q) RESULT( newpos )\n\n    integer, dimension(0:1), intent(in) :: p, q\n\n    integer, dimension(0:1) :: newpos\n\n    integer, dimension(0:1) :: vec\n\n    integer :: tmp\n\n    vec = p - q  ! Subtraction\n\n    tmp = vec(0)\n\n    newpos(0) = vec(1)  ! moved to new variable for clarity?\n\n    vec(0) = vec(1)\n\n    vec(1) = -tmp\n\n    newpos = q + vec\n\n    ! or step-by-step:\n\n    ! But let me see:\n\n    vec(0) = p(0) - q(0)\n\n    vec(1) = p(1) - q(1)\n\n    tmp = vec(0)\n\n    vec(0) = vec(1)\n\n    vec(1) = -tmp\n\n    newpos(0) = q(0) + vec(0)\n\n    newpos(1) = q(1) + vec(1)\n\n  END FUNCTION revpos\n\n  \n\n! Start of main code\n\n  read(*,*) input(0), input(1), input(2), input(3)\n\n  ! Initialize position\n\n  position(0,0) = input(0)\n\n  position(0,1) = input(1)\n\n  position(1,0) = input(2)\n\n  position(1,1) = input(3)\n\n  ! compute positions 2 and 3:\n\n  position(2,:) = revpos( position(0,:), position(1,:) )\n\n  position(3,:) = revpos( position(1,:), position(2,:) )\n\n  ! check condition:\n\n  temp = revpos( position(2,:), position(3,:) )\n\n  if( position(0,0) == temp(0) .AND. position(0,1) == temp(1) ) then\n\n      print *, \"OK\"\n\n  end if\n\n  ! set output array\n\n  output(0) = position(2,0)\n\n  output(1) = position(2,1)\n\n  output(2) = position(3,0)\n\n  output(3) = position(3,1)\n\n  ! print output\n\n  print *, output(0)\n\n  print *, output(1)\n\n  print *, output(2)\n\n  print *, output(3)\n\nend program atcoder_ABC108_B\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, after the OK check, the output is printed regardless? Otherwise the 'OK' is not part of the output? Wait:\n\nLooking back to the Java code's main:\n\nAfter the if statement, the OK is printed if condition met. But then the output is set, and the four numbers are printed.\n\nSo regardless of the if condition, the code always prints the four numbers in output. So the translation is correct here.\n\nNow checking for the revpos function's implementation.\n\nWait in the function, the difference p - q is computed for vec. Then the code swaps the first and second elements, but flips the first? Wait let's see.\n\nVector vec starts as (p0 - q0, p1 - q1).\n\nThen:\n\ntmp = vec[0], so that's (p0-q0).\n\nThen:\n\nvec[0] = vec[1] \u2192 so the first element becomes p1 - q1.\n\nvec[1] = -tmp \u2192 so second element becomes -(p0 - q0).\n\nThus, the new vec is (p1 - q1, -(p0 - q0)).\n\nWait no:\n\nWait in the code above:\n\nvec(0)= p(0)-q(0)\n\nvec(1)= p(1)-q(1)\n\ntmp = vec(0)\n\nvec(0) = vec(1) \u2192 now vec(0) is p1 - q1\n\nvec(1)= -tmp \u2192 now vec(1) is -(p0 - q0)\n\nThen newpos is q + vec \u2192 so newpos(0)= q[0] + (p1 - q1), newpos(1)= q[1] + (- (p0 - q0)) \n\nWhich is equivalent to (q0 + (p1 - q1)) and q1 - (p0 - q0)\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's better to code as stated in the code structure.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, variables:\n\nThe program seems to match the Java code's flow.\n\nTesting this code might be needed. For example, with some test cases.\n\nBut since the user wants the Fortran code, proceed to write it.\n\nPossible corrections:\n\nWait in the function revpos, perhaps the calculation is better done step by step to ensure correctness, as I had in the first version. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait the function body in the code above:\n\nvec is initialized to p - q \u2192 yes.\n\nThen, tmp = vec(0)\n\nvec(0) is set to vec(1)\n\nvec(1) is set to -tmp \u2192 which holds vec(1) as -(vec(0 original)).\n\nThen the newpos is q + this new vec.\n\nThus yes, that's correct.\n\nOther possible issues: in Fortran, the function is contained within the program's contains section, which is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the arrays are 0-based, as declared with 0:3 and 0:1 dimensions.\n\nThe output is printed with each element on a separate line.\n\nNow, compiling and executing this should match the Java code's behavior except for the initial if condition, which was in Java a reference comparison but in Fortran a content-based.\n\nWait, no. The original code's condition may have been incorrect. The user wrote the code, we have to translate verbatim.\n\nBut given the correct approach would be element-wise comparison, that's what we did. Therefore, the code should be as above.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would look like this."
