    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main class is atcoder_ABC158_A, which reads input and uses a solver class to solve the problem. The solver class checks if the input string contains both 'A' and 'B' and prints \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure. In Fortran, there are no classes or objects like Java, so I'll have to rewrite this using subroutines and functions instead.\n\nThe main program in Java starts by creating a Scanner and PrintWriter to handle input and output. In Fortran, input and output are typically done via read and write statements. So, the main program will need to read a string from standard input, process it, and write the result.\n\nNext, the solve method checks if the string contains both 'A' and 'B'. In Fortran, strings are handled as arrays of characters. I'll need to check each character in the string for the presence of 'A' and 'B' at least once each.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string from stdin.\n2. Check if both 'A' and 'B' are present in the string.\n3. Output \"Yes\" if both are present, else \"No\".\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part.\n\nFor reading the input: The string can be read using a character array. Since the problem's constraints aren't given, I'll assume the input isn't too long. Maybe 100 characters should be enough. Alternatively, using an unformatted read statement.\n\nWait, in Fortran, reading a string can be done with a read(*,*) statement. But if the string has spaces, but the problem states it's probably a single word? Let me check the original problem (even though I can't see it, but given the code, the Java uses in.next(), which reads the next token. So maybe the input is a single token, like a single word, so reading as a string should be fine.\n\nSo first step in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\nread(*,*) s\n\nWait, but this might read until a space. Hmm. Alternatively, if the problem expects the entire line, but the problem isn't given. Since in Java it's in.next(), that reads the next token (separated by whitespace), presumably the string is just until the end of line, but perhaps not. Well, I'll proceed assuming that the input is a single line without spaces, so reading with read(*,'(A)') s?\n\nAlternatively, to read an entire line, perhaps:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nBut the exact length may matter. Let's set s to a sufficient length like 1000, which is common in contest programming. Let's do:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nThis reads a line.\n\nNow, checking for presence of 'A' and 'B'?\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string, set a flag for A and B.\n\nInitialize two logical variables, hasa and hasb to .false., then loop over each character in s:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n   if(s(i:i) == 'A') hasa = .true.\n   if(s(i:i) == 'B') hasb = .true.\nend do\n\nThen, if both are true, print Yes, else No.\n\nPutting it all together in a program.\n\nWait, also, Fortran code structure. The original Java has a main method, but in Fortran, the MAIN program is just a program block.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram main\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n    logical :: hasa, hasb\n    integer :: i\n\n    read(*, '(A)') s\n\n    hasa = .false.\n    hasb = .false.\n\n    do i = 1, len_trim(s)\n        if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n            hasa = .true.\n        elseif (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n            hasb = .true.\n        endif\n    end do\n\n    if (hasa .and. hasb) then\n        write(*, '(A)') 'Yes'\n    else\n        write(*, '(A)') 'No'\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait a second. Wait, that loop: The 'elseif' might miss cases where a character is both? Well, 'A' and 'B' are different characters, so each if can be separate. Because the 'A' check is separate from 'B', so better to have two separate if statements. The way I have in my code above, the second if is else if, so once the first is true, the second is not checked. That's a mistake.\n\nAh right. Because in each character, it could be A but not B, and I want to check for each character whether it is A (setting hasa), and whether it's B (setting hasb). So the two should be separate ifs, not in an else if.\n\nBecause else if (if A is true, then the B isn't checked for that character. So code should have:\n\n   if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n       hasa = .true.\n   endif\n   if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n       hasb = .true.\n   endif\n\nAlternatively, since each character can be only one character, but the flags are cumulative over all the letters, so each character's A will trigger the flag for A, no matter what else it is. Similarly for B.\n\nSo, in the code, the loop should have two if statements.\n\nElse if would be incorrect here. So I need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the correct loop part:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(s)\n    if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n        hasa = .true.\n    end if\n    if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n        hasb = .true.\n    end if\nend do\n\nAlternatively, use an 'or' in the condition, but it's easier with two separate ifs.\n\nThat should set both flags properly.\n\nAlso, note that Fortran is case-sensitive. The original problem requires checking for uppercase 'A' and 'B'? The Java code uses .contains(\"A\") and .contains(\"B\"), so yes, uppercase. So any lowercase letters won't count. So the code as written is correct, checking for exactly 'A' and 'B'.\n\nThus, the Fortran code's condition is correct.\n\nAnother point: Do I need to trim the input to ignore trailing spaces? Well, since the problem probably expects the input as given (the Java code uses next(), which reads until next whitespace, perhaps. So the code in Java reads the next token, which in Fortran, how does that work?\n\nWait, the original Java reads the next token, which is a single whitespace-separated word. The Fortran code above with read(*,'(A)') would read the entire line (until newline). So that's different.\n\nWait a minute. The problem may have different requirements. Since the code in Java uses in.next(), which takes the next token (split by white space) so the input is one word. So in Fortran, when using '(A)' format, it reads until the end of the line. Which would be equivalent to in.nextLine() in Java, but wait, no, maybe not exactly. Need to make sure.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is probably such that the input line is just the string, like \"AB\", \"ABC\", etc., and thus, in Fortran, reading the entire line is okay, because even if there are spaces after, but len_trim would ignore trailing spaces (assuming that the input is given as a single line; but the problem isn't specific).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the character is read as a single token (with an implicit read of all non-whitespace characters). Because in Fortran's list-directed input (using read(*,*)), if the variable is a character, it reads until a whitespace. So the correct way to do that (as in Java's next()), which takes the next token, would be:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nBecause in list-directed input, read(*,*) would read the next string without spaces, so same as in.next().\n\nWait that may be better. Let's check.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the code uses in.next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So, the input could be \"ABC BCD\" but the first token is \"ABC\".\n\nIn that case, the Fortran code using read(*,*) s would read only \"ABC\", as a token, which is exactly what the Java code does. That is important.\n\nHowever, in my initial approach, using read(*,'(A)') s, would read the entire line (up to newline). That would give a wrong result when there are other tokens on the same line.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to read the first token. So adjust the Fortran code's read statement to read as a list-directed input.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if I have:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nread(*,*) s\n\nThis will read the next token (a string of non-whitespace characters), which matches in.next(). So that's correct.\n\nThus, changing the read statement to:\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nThis is better because if the input contains more tokens in the same line, it would still read only the first, matching the Java's behavior.\n\nAh, so that's a mistake in my earlier thinking. So, the read statement needs to be list-directed so that it reads a single token, like the Java's in.next();.\n\nTherefore, correcting that part.\n\nSo revised code:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n    logical :: hasa = .false., hasb = .false.\n    integer :: i, n\n\n    read(*,*) s\n\n    ! Determine the length of s. Use len_trim?\n    ! Since read(*,*) stops on whitespace, the length of s as stored will be exactly the character count (with trailing spaces if the read is not in A form?), wait.\n\n    ! Wait, no. In list-directed input for a character variable, trailing spaces are not stored. Hmm, but in Fortran, when using list-directed input, the value is stored as the characters (without any leading or trailing space). So the actual value is the string as read, so len_trim is okay to use.\n\n    n = len_trim(s)\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (s(i:i) == 'A') then\n            hasa = .true.\n        end if\n        if (s(i:i) == 'B') then\n            hasb = .true.\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (hasa .and. hasb) then\n        write(*,*) 'Yes'\n    else\n        write(*,*) 'No'\n    end if\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but wait, the indices in s may not be correct. Because in Fortran, the string is of length 1000, but only the first n (n= len_trim(s)) are characters. The rest are spaces. So s(i:i) for i beyond n would be space, but since we loop up to n, that's okay.\n\nWait, len_trim gives the length of the string excluding trailing blanks. So yes, so n is correct.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nIn Fortran, when you read a character variable with list-directed input (using read(*,*)). So for example, if the user inputs 'ABC', then s will have 'ABC' followed by spaces to the length of 1000? Or is it just stored as 'ABC'? Hmm.\n\nActually, no. The length is fixed to 1000, so the actual value of s is padded with spaces. For example, if you have s as length 1000 and read 'AB', then s will be 'AB' followed by 998 spaces.\n\nThus, the first n = len_trim(s) is the correct characters to process. So looping from 1 to n is correct.\n\nAnother note: Fortran strings are 1-based indices. Yes.\n\nNow, check the case if the string is empty? Well, in contest problems, probably inputs are valid, but the code should still handle it.\n\nTesting sample cases:\n\nIf the input is 'AB', the code reads it as 'AB' and both flags are set, so output 'Yes'.\n\nIf the input is 'A', then hasa is true but hasb false, so 'No'.\n\nIf 'B' \u2192 same.\n\nIf 'AXB' \u2192 both present \u2192 'Yes'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: Fortran's .AND. is same as .and., but using .and. in the condition.\n\nWait in Fortran logical expressions, you can write .AND. (uppercase) but it's also lowercase .and., and case doesn't matter. So \"hasa .and. hasb\" is correct.\n\nThe write statements: Using write(*,*) should work here, as it will just output 'Yes' or 'No' followed by a newline. In Fortran, the * format specifier in the output will format according to the kind of variable, so for a string, it will output the string, and add a newline.\n\nAlternatively, to match exactly the output (possibly without any trailing spaces?), but that's okay. The problem requires just the word Yes or No followed by new line, which this should do.\n\nAlso, the program doesn't need to close the output stream since Fortran exits.\n\nThus, this code should translate the Java code correctly.\n\nWait but in the original Java code, they create a PrintWriter and then call out.close(). But in Fortran, you don't need to close manually. So no problem.\n\nNow, coming back to the code structure again:\n\nVariables are declared with IMPLICIT NONE for good practice. The code above includes that.\n\nWait in the code I wrote:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n    logical :: hasa = .false., hasb = .false.\n    integer :: i, n\n\n    read(*,*) s\n\n    ... rest continues...\n\nYes, but in Fortran, when initializing variables at declaration, the syntax is allowed? Wait, in Fortran 90 or newer, you can do initialization at declaration. So yes, but in older versions, perhaps not. Assuming the code is F90.\n\nThe variable declarations are okay.\n\nWait also, the variables n, i, hasa, hasb.\n\nWait, the 's' variable is properly declared, yes.\n\nAnother thing: the initial values for hasa and hasb. In the code, I set hasa = .false., hasb = .false. But in the code above, in the variable declaration line, that is:\n\nlogical :: hasa = .false., hasb = .false.\n\nWhich is okay. Or, alternatively, we can initialize them to false in code.\n\nAlternatively, since they are set to false initially, and then set to true if present, so even initializing to false is okay, but in Fortran variables of type logical if not initialized have undefined values, so initialization is needed.\n\nHence the code is correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran code should be the one above."
