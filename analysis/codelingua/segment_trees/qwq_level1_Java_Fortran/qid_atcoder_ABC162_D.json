    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. I need to start by understanding what the Java code does. Let's look at the problem. The code is solving the AtCoder problem ABC162_D, I think it's about counting valid triplet combinations of R, G, B in a string, then subtracting invalid triplets that form an equidistant triplet. \n\nSo first, the Java code reads an integer n and a string s. Then it counts the number of R, G, and B characters. The initial result is rc * gc * bc, which is all possible triplets. Then there's a loop to subtract the invalid cases where the three characters form an arithmetic sequence (equidistant points) with all different colors. \n\nNow translating this to Fortran. Let's start with the variables. In Fortran, variables need to be declared with types. The main variables are n, s (the string), rc, gc, bc as long integers, but in Fortran, integers can have kinds, maybe use integer*8 or selected_int_kind. Alternatively, since n can be up to probably 1e5, maybe just use 8-byte integers? Or perhaps in AtCoder, the problem constraints aren't that big? Wait, the problem's original constraints for ABC162_D: the string length is up to 800, so maybe integers can be 4 bytes. Wait, 800^3 is 5.1e8, which is under 2^30 (~1e9), so 4 bytes (integer*4) can handle it. But to be safe, let's use integer*8.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Read n and the string s. In Fortran, reading from stdin can be done with read(*,*) for n, but the string is a bit tricky. In Fortran, strings are typically handled with CHARACTER arrays. Since Java's Scanner's next() reads the entire next token (without whitespace), which in this case is the string representing the colors. So in Fortran, to read a line as characters, we can read into a character array. So declare s as a character array of length n. Wait, in the problem, the input is one string of length n, so in Fortran, we'll need to read a string of length n.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are fixed length, so perhaps something like:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s\n\nBut n is variable here, so that might not work. Alternatively, declaring s as a character array of length, say, 1000 (since for n up to 800?), but better is to find the correct way. Alternatively, since in the java code it reads next(), so the string is input as a single token without whitespace. So in Fortran, read the string as a character array. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's have the string as a character array of length n, so in the code, we can do:\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_n = 1000  ! since n is up to 800 in the problem\ncharacter(len=max_n) :: s\nBut read the first n characters. Alternatively, use a allocatable array. Hmm. Alternatively, use list-directed input. \n\nWait, in Fortran, if we do read(*,*) s, the string is read until a whitespace. So maybe:\n\nread(*,'(a)') s\n\nBut then we have to declare s as a sufficiently large array. Since n is given first, perhaps first read n, then read the string into a character of length n. \n\nIn Fortran, maybe like this:\n\nRead the first n value, then read the next string exactly n characters. Perhaps:\n\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\nBut allocatable characters may be more recent. Assuming that's manageable. Alternatively:\n\nRead the first line to get n, then read the next line into a character array. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nAfter reading n, allocate s with length n:\n\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(character(len=n) :: s)\nread(*, '(a)') s\n\nWait, but in Fortran, allocation syntax is a bit different. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a fixed-length character array. Since n can be up to 800, maybe just 1000 is enough. Let me see:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nread(*,*) n\nread(*,'(a)') s\n\nThen the characters are taken from s(1:n). \n\nOkay, so processing the counts:\n\nInitialize rc=0, gc=0, bc=0. Then loop over each character in the string. For each character at position i (from 1 to n), check if it's 'R', 'G', or 'B' and increment the counts accordingly. \n\nIn Fortran, loops are from 1 to n:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    c = s(i:i)  ! the character at position i\n    if (c .eq. 'R') then\n        rc = rc + 1\n    else if (c .eq. 'G') then\n        gc = gc + 1\n    else\n        bc = bc + 1\n    endif\nend do\n\nThen compute result = rc * gc * bc. \n\nNext part is the double loop over i and k. The code loops for i from 1 to n and k from i+1 to n. Wait, the original Java code loops for int i = 1; i <=n; i++ and then k loops from i+1 to n? Wait, in Java code:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <=n; i++) since 'i' is used as in(s.charAt(i-1)), because in Java string indices start at 0. Wait, original java code for loops:\n\nThe java code's first loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0 to length-1; ...\n\nAnd in the second loop:\n\nfor (int i =1; i <= n; i++) and then k starts at i+1. Wait looking again:\n\nWait the original code's outer loop (for the subtraction part):\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    for (int k = i+1; k <= n; k++) {\n\nThen checks if (i +k) is even, so (i+k)/2 is integer, so the middle index. \n\nWait in Fortran, indices start at 1, so similar to Java's 1-based? The original Java code has for i from 0-based, but when accessing the characters, the code uses i-1 (because array starts at 0). \n\nWait the variable 'result' is calculated correctly in Java. \n\nWait in the Java loop for the subtraction part:\n\nThe loops are i from 1 to n, and k from i+1 to n. \n\nFor each i and k, if (i +k) is even:\n\nthen the character at (i-1), (k-1), and the middle position ((i+k)/2 -1)?\n\nWait in Fortran, the string is stored as s(1:n). So the indices would be 1-based. So when Java does s.charAt(i-1) and s.charAt(k-1), in Fortran the equivalent would be s(i) and s(k).\n\nWait need to think in indices correctly. Let me think through the loops and indices again:\n\nIn Java, the outer loop for the second part is over 'i' from 1 up to n, and 'k' from i+1 to n. Then, if (i +k) is even, then the middle position is (i +k)/2. \n\nBut in Java's string (0-based indices), so:\n\nThe positions being considered are at i-1, k-1, and the middle (m-1 where m is (i+k)/2.\n\nWait because in the Java code, the indexes are:\n\ni: from 1 to n (inclusive), so when i=1, it's looking at the original index 0 of the string. \n\nThe variables is = s.charAt(i-1) (the character at the original position i-1 in the Java string);\n\nsimilar for ks and js. \n\nSo in Fortran, the indices are 1-based, so to get the characters:\n\ns(i) corresponds to s at 1-based index i (which would be i-th character). \n\nSimilarly, for middle position:\n\nthe position would be (i +k)/2. But since in Java's case, they have to subtract 1 again because the string is 0-based, but in Fortran the string is stored as 1-based. \n\nWait:\n\nIn the Fortran code, for i and k (1-based), the middle is (i +k)/2. \n\nSo the three characters would be:\n\nis = s(i)\n\nks = s(k)\n\njs is s(mid), where mid = (i +k)/2.\n\nThe condition is that the three characters are all different (since is != ks, and ks != js, and js != is. That's equivalent to all three being different). \n\nSo whenever you have three positions i, mid, k forming an arithmetic sequence, and their colors are all R, G, B in some order (so they form a distinct triplet, which would have been counted in the initial rc*gc*bc but are invalid as per the problem's condition). So the code subtracts 1 for each such triplet. \n\nSo the loop over i and k in Fortran would be:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   do k = i+1, n\n\n       if mod( i +k, 2 ) == 0 then \n\n           mid = (i+k)/2 \n\n           is = s(i)\n\n           ks = s(k)\n\n           js = s( mid )\n\n           if (is .ne. ks) and (ks .ne. js) and (js .ne. is) then \n\n              result = result -1 \n\n           end if \n\n       end if \n\n   end do \n\nend do \n\nSo this loops over all pairs (i,k) where k>i, then checks if the three positions form an arithmetic sequence, and if all three are different. \n\nAnother thing to note is that in the Java code, the loops for i to n, and k starting at i+1. That's correct. \n\nNow, translating variables:\n\nJava uses 'long' variables. In Fortran, we can use integer*8 variables. \n\nDeclaration:\n\ninteger*8 :: rc, gc, bc, result \n\nBut in the loop variables, integers can be regular 4-byte integers (if n is small, like 800), so integer i, k.\n\nSo here's the steps to structure the Fortran code:\n\nStart with reading n. Then read the string s (of n characters), then compute the counts. Then compute initial result. Then the double loops to subtract invalid triplets. \n\nAlso, in Fortran, the main program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   ! declarations \n\n   integer :: n\n\n   character(len=1000) :: s\n\n   integer*8 :: rc, gc, bc, result\n\n   ... \n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   read(*, '(a)') s \n\n   rc = 0\n\n   gc = 0\n\n   bc = 0\n\n   loop over i from 1 to n:\n\nthen after counts, result = rc*gc*bc\n\nThen the loops for i and k.\n\nWait, but the string s may have trailing characters beyond n, because it is stored as len=1000. So in the code: the actual characters used are s(1:n). \n\nWait, in the loop where we read s, after reading a line as s, the rest is okay because Fortran will ignore any length beyond the variable. Wait no, actually, the read statement '(a)' will read until end of line, so if the string input has exactly n characters, then the first n are okay. \n\nNow the loops. Let me code the loops:\n\nthe outer loop for i=1 to n.\n\nInner loop from k =i+1 to n. \n\nCorrect ordering. \n\nThen in the condition if (i +k) is even.\n\nIf yes, compute mid = (i +k)/2 \n\nCheck the three characters: s(i), s(k), s(mid). \n\nThen, check if all three characters are different and all distinct in the way that they form R, G, B? Wait the condition in Java is:\n\nif (is != ks && ks != js && js != is) \n\nWhich is equivalent to all three different. Because, if is != ks, ks != js, and js != is -> all three are distinct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif ( is .ne. ks ) then \n\n   if (ks .ne. js) then \n\n       if (js .ne. is) then \n\n          ... \n\n        end if \n\n    end if \n\nend if \n\nAlternatively, can write it as a single line:\n\nif ( (is /= ks) .and. ( (ks /= js) .and. (js /= is) ) ) then \n\n       result = result -1 \n\nBut in Fortran logical operators are .AND., .OR., so:\n\nif( (is /= ks) .AND. (ks /= js) .AND. (js /= is) ) then \n\n    result = result -1 \n\nend if \n\nWait in Fortran, the inequality uses /= instead of .NE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the following is better. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the .NE. and other operators are options. So if writing in fixed format, but I think the code is using free form. \n\nProceeding.\n\nNow, the code in steps.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe entire program would look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC162_D\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, i, k\n    character(len=1000) :: s\n    integer(8) :: rc, gc, bc, result\n    integer :: mid\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    read(*,'(a)') s\n\n    rc = 0\n    gc = 0\n    bc = 0\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        select case ( s(i:i) )\n            case ('R')\n                rc = rc +1\n            case ('G')\n                gc = gc +1\n            case ('B')\n                bc = bc +1\n            case default\n                ! should not happen as per problem statement\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    result = rc * gc * bc\n\n    do i =1, n\n        do k = i+1, n\n            if ( mod(i +k,2) == 0 ) then\n                mid = (i +k) / 2\n                if ( mid >=1 .and. mid <=n ) then \n                     ! to make sure mid is within 1 to n (which it should be because i and k are in 1..n and k>i)\n                     ! but if i and k are such that (i+k) is even...\n                    ! always true because if i and k are of the same parity, then sum is even \n                     ! so mid is integer as per even sum. \n                    ! the mid is between i and k?\n\n                    character(len=1) :: is, ks, js\n                    is = s(i:i)\n                    ks = s(k:k)\n                    js = s(mid:mid)\n\n                    if (is /= ks) then\n                        if (ks /= js) then\n                            if (js /= is) then\n                                result = result -1\n                            end if\n                        end if\n                     end if\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print*, result\n\nend program atcoder_ABC162_D\n\nWait, but in the loops for i and k, since k starts at i+1, then since i and k are positive and k>i, the mid between them is between i and k. So mid must be between that. But since both i and k are in 1<=i<k<=n, mid = (i+k)/2 will be between i and k (since (i+k)/2 is the average). For example, i=1, k=3: mid is 2, which is between them. \n\nTherefore, mid will always be between 1 and n as well. So in Fortran the if (mid is within bounds) can be omitted? Well, perhaps it's safer to have it, but actually the problem ensures i and k are within 1..n. \n\nWait, but when i and k are 1 and n, the mid would be (1 +n)/2, which is within the range. \n\nTherefore, the first part (if mid is between... ) might be redundant. But perhaps in some cases, like when (i + k) even but adds to 0? but i starts at 1. \n\nThus the check on 'mid' is not necessary, but it doesn't hurt. \n\nIn the code above, in the middle part, the mid is computed correctly. \n\nWait another thing: in Fortran string slices s(i:i) gives one character. So that's correct. \n\nAlso, the select case statement might be better than else if chains. \n\nWait in the first loop, for counting R, G, B:\n\nThe code uses a select case on s(i:i). \n\nAlternatively, could use if-else, but select case is better. \n\nNow, the code's inner loops are i from1 to n:\n\nfor each i, k from i+1 to n. \n\nWithin the loops, the variables is, ks, js are each one character. \n\nWait in Fortran, variables can be declared in the loop? \n\nIn the code above, I did:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: is, ks, js\n\nDeclaring inside the if (mod...) block. Wait, in Fortran, variable declarations can be anywhere in free form. So perhaps placing them inside the if block is okay, but some compilers may have issues. Alternatively, declare them before the loops. \n\nAlternatively, just reference the characters directly without variables:\n\nif ( s(i:i)/=s(k:k) .and. s(k:k) /= s(mid:mid) .and. s(mid:mid)/= s(i:i) ) then \n\nBut that would require accessing the string three times for comparison, but it avoids intermediate variables. Perhaps that's better for readability.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nThe condition can be written as:\n\nif ( ( s(i:i) /= s(k: k) ) .and. ( s(k:k) /= s(mid:mid) ) .and. ( s(mid:mid) /= s(i:i) ) ) then \n    result = result -1 \nend if \n\nSo this way, no variables needed for intermediate steps. \n\nWhich would make the code shorter.\n\nSo modifying the inner loop code:\n\nmid = ... \n\nif ( mod(i +k, 2) ==0 ) then \n\n    mid = (i+k)/2\n\n    c1 = s(i:i)\n    c2 = s(k:k)\n    c3 = s(mid:mid)\n\n    if ( c1 /= c2 .and. c2 /= c3 .and. c3 /= c1 ) then\n\n        result = result -1\n\n    end if \n\nend if \n\nAlternatively without using variables:\n\nBut let's try the inline approach.\n\nSo, replacing all variables:\n\nInside the if mod:\n\nmid = (i+k)/2\n\nThen check:\n\nif ( ( s(i:i) /= s(k:k) ) .and. ( s(k:k) /= s( mid : mid ) ) .and. ( s( mid : mid ) /= s(i:i) ) ) then \n\n    result = result -1 \n\nend if \n\nThat should work.\n\nWhich may be more efficient in this context. \n\nThis would reduce the lines needed. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\n...\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        do k = i+1, n\n            if ( mod( i + k, 2 ) == 0 ) then\n                mid = (i +k)/2\n                if ( ( s(i:i)/= s(k:k) ) .and. ( s(k:k)/=s(mid:mid)) .and. ( s(mid:mid)/=s(i:i) ) ) then\n                    result = result -1\n                end if\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    print *, result \n\nend program atcoder_ABC162_D\n\nWait, but do I need to check mid bounds again?\n\nMid is (i +k)/2. Since i <=k, the maximum mid would be when i=k (but k starts at i+1, so the maximum case when i =n-1 and k =n)\n\nWait for i and k when i =n-1 and k =n, mid = (2n-1)/2, but since i and k must have even sum, so n-1 +n = 2n-1 which is odd, so this pair is skipped. \n\nThe i and k must have i+k even. So when i and k are both even or both odd. \n\nThus as long as i and k are between 1 and n, then mid will be an integer between 1 and n (because (i+k) even, so when i and k are within 1..n, their average (mid) is within 1 and n. \n\nSo the check for mid's position is redundant, so I can remove the if statement. \n\nThus code can be simplified as above.\n\nNow, what's the maximum length of s?\n\nThe first read reads the input string. But since the first line is n, the second line is the string of length n. The code reads s as a len=1000 buffer. So if n is up to say 800, which it is as per the problem (since the problem would have constraints like n up to 800, perhaps?), then 1000 is okay. \n\nWait the problem link isn't given but ABC162 D is the problem. Looking it up:\n\nProblem statement: \n\nYou are given a string S of length N. Each character in S is 'R', 'G', or 'B'. \n\nCompute the number of triples (i,j,k) such that:\n\n- All of i,j,k are different,\n\n- The three characters at these positions are all different,\n\n- And the three positions form an arithmetic sequence. \n\nThe condition for being an arithmetic sequence can be written as (i - a) = (j - i) = (b - j) or something? Or the three positions are in arithmetic progression. So i < j < k, and j-i = k -j \u2192 2j = i +k \u2192 i +k must be even, j is the average. \n\nWait in the code's subtraction, the problem's invalid triple is exactly those triples where the three form an arithmetic sequence and all three colors are different. Because the initial result counts all R*G*B, but those triplets that are in arithmetic progression with all different colors must be subtracted. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. \n\nTherefore the code in Fortran is as above. \n\nNow, one more edge case: For three consecutive letters. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the string is \"RGB\" with n=3. Then all three are R, G, B. The arithmetic triplet would be positions 1, 2, 3 where 2 is the midpoint. Since all three are R, G, B, they form an arithmetic triplet (their indices are in arithmetic progression with common difference 1). Thus the code would subtract one. \n\nInitial count is 1*1*1 =1. Then subtract 1 \u2192 result 0. \n\nYes, correct, since the only triplet is counted but is invalid.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2. Then there are no such triplets, so the loops would not count anything. \n\nSo code should be okay.\n\nAnother check: in the loops, the code checks for i from 1 to n and k from i+1. \n\nWait in the Java code, the outer loop was from i=1 to n. But original Java had:\n\nfor (int k = i+1; k <=n; k++). All correct. \n\nIn Fortran, the loops are similar.\n\nSo the code looks correct. \n\nBut need to ensure in the first loop (counting) that all characters are processed. \n\nNow, possible problem in Fortran: the line to read the string. Sometimes, when reading with read(*,'(a)') s, leading or trailing spaces might be an issue. But the problem states that the input is a single string without leading/trailing spaces, so as per problem's input, the read should work. \n\nAdditionally, in Fortran, character variables are initialized with spaces or whatever, but if the input is shorter than the buffer (n <1000), the remaining characters are filled with spaces. But since the code only uses s(1:n), it should be okay.\n\nSo wrapping up, the code would be as written."
