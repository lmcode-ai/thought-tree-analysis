Wait the problem probably requires that x is achieved at some time up to t steps (i and j are from 0 to t-1 each). Wait but for the case x equals 0, the problem might require that being acceptable regardless of other factors. So the Java code correctly includes x==0 in the condition. But in the condition, it's part of the if-statement that is executed during the loops. But if the loops aren't run (t=0), then the check for x ==0 would never happen. So if x is zero, but t is zero, the answer is YES according to the problem's logic but the code would give 'NO'.",

So the check for x=0 will not be done in the loop. So, even if x=0, and the required a' + b' is x, but in that case, even if a and b's initial values (without any steps) sum to x, but if t=0 then the loop won't run, so when x is 0, which is part of the condition, but only if during some time up to t steps. Wait the code uses in the condition:\n\n(second + first ==x || second==x || first ==x || x ==0) So even if x is 0, but the sum, or either alone do not equate to x (which is zero), but x is zero, then the condition will still trigger. Wait if x is zero, then the condition will hit and set ok to True regardless of other variables, but the loop only runs when there's iterations where t is non-zero. Wait but suppose x=0, and t is zero: then the loops aren't entered, so the code does not check x==0 so the ok remains false, so the code prints 'NO', which is wrong. Ah, so the problem is that even when t=0, if x is zero, the code should return yes, but the code does not handle that since the loop is not entered, so the x ==0 condition can only be triggered if a loop iteration occurs (since it's part of the condition in the loop's inner check). So the original java code is incorrect. Wait the original code's condition includes x ==0 as a condition in the loop, but when there are no loops, this condition won't be checked. Thus, the code is buggy. To fix this, perhaps the code should handle the x==0 case outside the loops. But perhaps the problem's constraints say that t is at least 1?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a way to set time t =0, but Then the condition must be checked regardless.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main method creates an instance of codeforces_203_A and runs the solve method. The solve method reads several integers: x, t, a, b, da, db. Then it has a loop that runs t times for i and j, calculates first and second, checks if any combination equals x, and prints YES or NO based on that.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the steps in the Java code:\n\n1. Read inputs x, t, a, b, da, db. \n2. Initialize variables first, second, ok as false.\n3. Loop i from 0 to t-1:\n   a. Compute first = a - da*i\n   b. Loop j from 0 to t-1:\n       i. Compute second = b - db*j\n       ii. Check if (first + second) equals x, or if either is equal to x, or x is 0. If any condition met, set ok=true and break loops.\n4. After loops, print \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on ok.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about variables and structure.\n\nFortran uses modules and doesn't have classes like Java. Since the problem is a single program, perhaps it's better to structure this as a standalone program without objects. The main procedure would handle the logic.\n\nInputs: Need to read 6 integers. In Fortran, that's done via read(*,*) variables.\n\nThe loops: in Fortran, loops can be done with do loops. The outer loop over i from 0 to t-1, inner over j similarly. The break is a bit tricky. In Java, when it breaks the inner loop, then checks if ok is set. In Fortran, using a flag (like ok) that once set can exit loops early, perhaps with a labeled exit.\n\nVariables:\n\nVariables x, t, a, b, da, db are all integers.\n\nThe first and second variables are also integers.\n\nThe flag ok is a logical.\n\nThe code in Fortran should:\n\n- Declare variables at the top of the program.\n\nPossible steps in code:\n\nRead the inputs first.\n\nInitialize ok as .false.\n\nThen, loops:\n\ndo i=0, t-1\n   first = a - da*i\n   do j=0, t-1\n       second = b - db*j\n       if ( (first + second) == x .or. first == x .or. second == x .or. x ==0 ) then\n           ok = .true.\n           exit inner_loop\n       end if\n   end do j loop\n   if(ok) exit outer_loop\nend do i loop\n\nWait, but for each i, the inner loop runs all j's until it finds a match, then breaks and exits outer loop if ok is set.\n\nAlternatively, after setting ok to true, need to exit both loops. So perhaps in Fortran, once ok is set, we can have a labeled exit to the outer loop to break both loops.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe inner loop could be labeled, then when inside, if ok becomes true, exit inner loop, then check if ok and exit the outer.\n\nAlternatively, use loop labels and exit.\n\nAlternatively, once ok is true, set a flag and then loop until end, but that's inefficient but acceptable.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nWe can have the loops as:\n\nouter: do i=0, t-1\n   first = a - da*i\n   do j=0, t-1\n       second = b - db*j\n       if ( (first + second == x) .or. (first ==x) .or. (second==x) .or. (x ==0) ) then\n           ok = .true.\n            exit outer  ! exits the outer loop, hence both loops\n       end if\n   end do\n   if (ok) exit outer\nend do outer\n\nWait, but the outer loop is labeled \"outer\", so when we hit the if condition, the exit outer would exit the loop entirely. That would work. Because once any condition is met, we can exit both loops immediately.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested loop structure with the exit inner and then outer.\n\nHmm, in the inner loop, if the condition is met, then set ok to true, exit the j loop, then within the i loop, check if ok and then exit.\n\nLike:\n\nouter_loop: do i=0,t-1\n    compute first\n    inner_loop: do j=0,t-1\n        compute second\n        if (conditions) then\n            ok = .true.\n            exit inner_loop\n        end if\n    end do inner_loop\n    if (ok) then\n        exit outer_loop\n    end if \nend do outer_loop\n\nThis way, when the condition is met in the inner loop, we exit inner and then exit outer.\n\nBut in the original Java code, once the break is encountered in the inner loop (for j), the outer loop (i) proceeds until i reaches t, but only if the ok was not yet set. Wait, in Java, when you break the inner loop, you continue to the next i. Only when you set ok to true do you break and stop. Wait the java code's inner loops are both going up to t? Or up to t-1? Let me check the Java code's for loops.\n\nThe Java code uses 'for (int i=0; i < t; i++)' which means i goes from 0 to t-1. Similarly for j. So in Fortran, same: loops from 0 to t-1.\n\nSo the structure would be as above.\n\nNow, for handling the input. Since the code is in a program, let's see.\n\nThe code begins with a program block. Let me structure it as follows:\n\nprogram codeforces_203A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n    integer :: i, j, first, second\n    logical :: ok\n\n    read(*,*) x, t, a, b, da, db\n    ok = .false.\n\n    do i = 0, t-1\n        first = a - da*i\n        do j = 0, t-1\n            second = b - db*j\n            if ( (first + second == x) .or. (first == x) .or. (second ==x) .or. (x==0) ) then\n                ok = .true.\n                exit 2  ! Exits both loops (since exit n takes you n levels up)\n            end if\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    if (ok) then\n        write(*,*) 'YES'\n    else\n        write(*,*) 'NO'\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_203A\n\nWait, in Fortran, using exit 2 would exit two loops up. But in the code, the loops are nested, so the first \"do i\" is the outer, the inner is \"do j\". Thus, the two loop levels. The exit 2 inside the inner loop would exit both the do j and do i loops. Alternatively, but in Fortran exit can be labeled, but perhaps the numbered exit works here.\n\nAlternatively, use an outer loop label. Let's see:\n\nouterloop: do i = 0, t-1\n    first = a - da*i\n    do j =0, t-1\n        second = ...\n        if (conditions) then\n            ok = .true.\n            exit outerloop\n        end if\n    end do\nend do outerloop\n\nWait, but the exit outerloop would exit only the outerloop, but the inner loop may have already been exited. Hmm. Alternatively, when inside the inner loop, exit outerloop would jump out to after the outerloop.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be structured with the labels.\n\nBut perhaps the exit 2 is better, but in some Fortran versions exit can only exit the immediate loop unless using goto, which isn't good here.\n\nAlternatively, when inside the inner loop, once the condition is met, set the flag and exit the inner loop, then check in the outer loop and exit if needed.\n\nWait, the condition is sufficient as soon as any of the cases are true. So once a condition is met, the answer is YES. So as soon as that happens, the rest of the loops don't need to run.\n\nThus, when the condition is met, we can break out of both loops. So in the inner loop, after the condition, we can exit both loops. Otherwise the loops will continue until all possibilities are checked.\n\nTo accomplish this in Fortran, one way is to use labeled loops and an exit to the outer loop.\n\nLike:\n\nouter_loop: do i=...\n    first = ...\n    inner_loop: do j=...\n        second=...\n        if (condition) then\n            ok = .true.\n            exit outer_loop\n        end if\n    end do inner_loop\nend do outer_loop\n\nThat way, if the condition is met, it exits the outer_loop directly, even from inside the inner loop.\n\nYes, this is feasible. So the structure would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_203A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n    integer :: first, second\n    logical :: ok\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) x, t, a, b, da, db\n\n    ok = .false.\n\n    outer: do i=0,t-1\n        first = a - da*i\n        inner: do j=0,t-1\n            second = b - db *j\n            if ( ( first + second ==x ) .or. (first ==x) .or. (second ==x) .or. (x ==0) ) then\n                ok = .true.\n                exit outer\n            end if\n        end do inner\n    end do outer\n\n    if (ok) then\n        print*, 'YES'\n    else\n        print*, 'NO'\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_203A\n\nWait, but the exit outer will exit the outer loop, which is labeled outer. But in the exit statement inside the inner loop (labeled inner), exiting to outer. Will that work?\n\nYes, because in Fortran you can exit to an outer labeled loop even if you are inside an inner loop.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the outer loop label.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to have the outer loop as labeled with 'outer:', and then in the if condition, do 'exit outer' which would exit both loops (since outer is the outer loop), even if you're in the inner. Because the inner loop is part of the outer's body, so exiting outer will exit everything inside it.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the condition, x could be 0. So even if the others don't add up, but x is zero, then it's yes. So the code includes x ==0 as a condition. So even if both first and second are non-zero, but x is zero, then it's a YES.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the check is: if (second + first == x || second == x || first == x || x == 0). So, for example, if x is zero, it's automatically YES. So even if a and b's positions after any steps, the condition becomes true because x is zero, so even if the other terms are anything, the answer is yes.\n\nWait, but the code is checking in a loop over i and j up to t seconds? Because the problem probably describes a scenario where t is the number of steps, or the maximum time? Need to confirm the problem's logic, but perhaps the code's logic is such that if x can be obtained at any step (after 0 steps up to t steps?), but perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the time.\n\nWait, the original code runs the loops for i from 0 to t-1 (since it's i < t). It's doing this for both i and j. So each step counts from 0 up to t-1, meaning i and j can each go up to t steps? Wait, no, the loops are i < t and j < t, so both are from 0 to t-1.\n\nBut in codeforces problems, often there's a problem statement where after t steps or something, so perhaps the problem here requires that within t seconds, which corresponds to the indices up to t-1 steps.\n\nAssuming that the loops are correct as per original problem's logic, the Fortran code should replicate that.\n\nAnother point: in Java's code, the variables a and b are the starting positions, and da is the step change for a each iteration. So in each step i, after i steps, a's position is a - da*i. Because in the first step (i=0), it's the original position a, then each step subtracts da. (assuming that's how the Java code is handling it).\n\nSame for b and db.\n\nThus the variables are computed correctly in the Fortran code as well.\n\nNow, let's consider handling input in Fortran. The code reads 6 integers in one line, using read(*,*) which should work if the inputs are space-separated.\n\nAlso, Fortran uses print to print, or write statements. The program uses print*, which is acceptable for simple outputs.\n\nWhat about integer overflows? Not sure, but the problem likely is intended to use integers fitting in standard types, so the code should be okay.\n\nThus, the above Fortran code should be correct. Let's review again.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. The variables are declared at the start of the program.\n\nConfirming variable declarations:\n\ninteger :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n\nYes.\n\nFirst and second are integers.\n\nok is logical.\n\ni and j are loop variables.\n\nThus, the code seems okay.\n\nPotential mistake points:\n\nThe condition in Fortran uses .or. with parentheses around each clause to prevent operator precedence issues. For example:\n\nif ( (first + second == x) .or. (first == x) .or. (second == x) .or. (x == 0) ) then\n\nYes. Without parentheses, the standard precedence might be different, so it's better to have them.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the logical operators have precedence: .and. is higher than .or., so to make sure that each comparison is grouped correctly, the parentheses around the terms are necessary. So the code's parentheses are correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when x is 0: the code returns YES immediately regardless of anything else, so that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case when t is zero? But according to the loop condition, t=0 means the loop doesn't run, and ok remains false, but only if x is 0 would it be YES. Wait:\n\nIf t is 0, then the value of i starts from 0 but less than t=0, so no loops run.\n\nIn that case, the loops are skipped, so the code checks if ok is false, so it outputs 'NO' unless x is zero (since when t=0, but x is 0, we have to check if the condition x==0 is met, which would trigger ok to be true. Wait, but in the code:\n\nThe loops do not run when t=0. The variables a, b, etc. are not used, but the condition x==0 would automatically set ok?\n\nWait, in that scenario:\n\nAt the start, ok is false. The loops are skipped entirely. Then, after loops, check if x is zero. Because if x is zero, the condition in the first part of the code's logic ( even in the loops) would have had checked?\n\nWait, no. If t is zero, then the code never entered any loop. Thus, in the case that x is zero, the code will return NO? But that's wrong because when x is zero, the problem's condition is always YES.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The code as written would not account for that.\n\nWait the original Java code has the condition including x==0. So even outside the loops, the code checks x==0.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the Java code, during loops, they check if any of the conditions, including x ==0. So even in the first iteration, if x is zero, then the code sets ok to true. But when t is zero (so the loops won't execute), then the loops are not entered, so the check for x==0 is never done.\n\nIn that case, if x is zero, but t=0 (and other parameters could be anything), the code would have ok as false (since the loops weren't entered), thus outputting 'NO', which is wrong.\n\nThus, this is a bug in the Java code? Or perhaps the problem conditions?\n\nWait the problem probably requires that x is achieved at some time up to t steps (i and j are from 0 to t-1 each). Wait but for the case x equals 0, the problem might require that being acceptable regardless of other factors. So the Java code correctly includes x==0 in the condition. But in the condition, it's part of the if-statement that is executed during the loops. But if the loops aren't run (t=0), then the check for x ==0 would never happen. So if x is zero, but t is zero, the answer is YES according to the problem's logic but the code would give 'NO'.\n\nAh, that's a critical bug in the original Java code. Therefore, the Fortran code must also face the same issue. So to fix this, the code should account for when x ==0 separately.\n\nWait wait the problem's logic probably has the problem: the code must determine whether there exists a combination a' and b' such that (a' + b') = x, but each of a' and b' are their values after some time steps. However, the initial positions (after 0 steps) count as well. Oh wait the loops start with i and j from 0 (meaning that for i=0, it's the initial position, because the first iteration subtracts da *0. So starting positions are considered.\n\nTherefore, when t is 0, no steps can be taken. Thus the only possible positions are a and b at time 0 but the loop would not run, so if t=0, then it's only allowed to take steps i=0 and j=0? Because the loop runs for i < t=0? No, loops won't execute. So if t is zero, the code cannot check anything except via the x==0 clause.\n\nWait, this suggests a possible flaw. Let me look at the Java code again:\n\nThe loop is for (int i =0; i <t ; ... )\n\nIf t is 0, the loop doesn't run. So the check for x=0 will not be done in the loop. So, even if x=0, and the required a' + b' is x, but in that case, even if a and b's initial values (without any steps) sum to x, but if t=0 then the loop won't run, so when x is 0, which is part of the condition, but only if during some time up to t steps.\n\nWait the code uses in the condition:\n\n(second + first ==x || second==x || first ==x || x ==0)\n\nSo even if x is 0, but the sum, or either alone do not equate to x (which is zero), but x is zero, then the condition will still trigger.\n\nWait if x is zero, then the condition will hit and set ok to True regardless of other variables, but the loop only runs when there's iterations where t is non-zero.\n\nWait but suppose x=0, and t is zero: then the loops aren't entered, so the code does not check x==0 so the ok remains false, so the code prints 'NO', which is wrong.\n\nAh, so the problem is that even when t=0, if x is zero, the code should return yes, but the code does not handle that since the loop is not entered, so the x ==0 condition can only be triggered if a loop iteration occurs (since it's part of the condition in the loop's inner check). So the original java code is incorrect.\n\nWait the original code's condition includes x ==0 as a condition in the loop, but when there are no loops, this condition won't be checked.\n\nThus, the code is buggy. To fix this, perhaps the code should handle the x==0 case outside the loops. But perhaps the problem's constraints say that t is at least 1?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a way to set time t =0, but Then the condition must be checked regardless.\n\nTherefore, this is a problem with the Java code which the Fortran code would also inherit. Thus, in our translation, we must also fix this problem or carry it forward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that x is either non-zero, or that t is always at least 1, so this is acceptable, but the code may have a bug.\n\nAssuming the problem expects us to mirror the flawed code, but perhaps not. Let's see:\n\nThe user wants a direct translation of the given code, not to fix any bugs present in the original code, unless instructed otherwise. So in that case, the Fortran must replicate the same bug.\n\nThus, even if the code has this problem, the Fortran code should mimic it.\n\nTherefore, the current Fortran code is correct in replicating the original code's logic, including this flaw.\n\nAnother point: In the loops, for the j loop, it's the 0 to t-1, but the code's syntax may have to check for that correctly.\n\nNow, the code as I wrote earlier:\n\nprogram codeforces_203A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: x, t, a, b, da, db\n    integer :: first, second\n    logical :: ok\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) x, t, a, b, da, db\n\n    ok = .false.\n\n    outer_loop: do i =0, t-1\n        first = a - da*i\n        inner_loop: do j = 0, t-1\n            second = b - db * j\n            if ( (first + second ==x ) .or. (first == x) .or. (second ==x) .or. (x ==0)) then\n                ok = .true.\n                exit outer_loop\n            end if\n        end do inner_loop\n    end do outer_loop\n\n    if (ok) then\n        print*, 'YES'\n    else\n        print*, 'NO'\n    end if\n\nend program codeforces_203A\n\nYes. I think this should work.\n\nOther items to check:\n\nParentheses in the condition? Yes, they're there.\n\nLoop variables declared: i and j are declared as integers.\n\nThe exit uses the loop label properly. So when inside inner_loop, the exit outer_loop will escape both loops, which is correct.\n\nThus this should be the correct code. Let me go through an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nSample input: Let's say x=5, t=3, a=4, b=3, da=1, db=2.\n\nFirst loop i runs 0 (iter 0), 1, 2.\n\nFor i=0: first =4-0*1 =4.\n\nThen j loops 0 to 2:\n\nj=0 \u2192 second=3-0=3. First+second=7 vs 5: no. first (4) and second (3) not equal to 5. x is not 0. so no.\n\nj=1 \u2192 second = 3-2*1 =1. 4+1=5 \u2192 yes \u2192 ok becomes true. exit.\n\nHence code outputs YES.\n\nThe Fortran code should do that.\n\nAnother test case when t=0 and x=0:\n\nIf x=0, t=0, others any. Then loops not executed, and ok remains false \u2192 output is 'NO' which is wrong. So the code's bug remains, but the problem states to translate the code as is, so this is acceptable.\n\nHence, the code is correct as per the original code's functionality."
