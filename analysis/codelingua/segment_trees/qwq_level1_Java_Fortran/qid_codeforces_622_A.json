Wait no, wait the block for index k is the sequence of numbers from GetValue(k) to GetValue(k+1) -1. Wait perhaps each index corresponds to the start of a block, which the block length is that index. Wait the function getValueAtIndex(k) returns the first element of the k-th block? Or the start of the block. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the Java code's getValueAtIndex function:\n\npublic static long getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n        return 1 + ((index - 1) * index / 2);\n} So for index=1, 1 + (0 * 1)/2 =1.\n\nIndex=2: 1 + (1*2)/2 =1+1=2. index3: 1+ (2*3)/2 =1+3=4.\n\nindex4: 1+ (3*4)/2 =1 +6=7. So the blocks:\n\nk=1: the first element is 1, and the block length is 1. So numbers:1.\n\nk=2: starts at 2, length 2: 2,3. k=3: starts at 4, length 3:4,5,6.\n\nk=4: starts at7, length4:7-10 (since starts at 7 and 4 numbers?)\n\nWait the length for block k is k. So the starting index of the block sequence is the value from this function. For example, position=3 is in the block of index2, so the answer would be (3 - 2)+1 = 2.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code is doing. \n\nThe code is for solving a problem where given a position, it calculates the sequence and finds the starting index of the block that contains that position, then determines the answer based on that. The main functions are the solve method and the getValueAtIndex method. \n\nFirst, I see the class structures, like codeforces_622_A, but in Fortran, we don't have classes. So everything here will have to be moved into subroutines or functions outside of any objects. Also, input/output handling in Java uses Scanner and PrintWriter with buffered streams. For that in Fortran, probably using standard input and output with some buffering if necessary, but Fortran's default I/O might be sufficient unless I need large buffer handling. Since the user provided a buffer size of 512000, maybe in Fortran we can ignore that or find a way to set a buffer, but I'm not sure. Maybe just use read(*,*) and write(*,*) since buffer size might not matter here, or perhaps use some file handling?\n\nMain steps:\n\n1. The solve routine reads the position from input, processes it with some loops, then writes the result.\n\nNow, variables like position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex are all numeric. The getValueAtIndex function returns a long (integer in Fortran, maybe integer*8 if necessary, but check for overflow). The getValueAtIndex formula is 1 + (index-1)*index/2.\n\nIn Fortran functions:\n\n- Need to write a function equivalent to getValueAtIndex. Let me note that formula.\n\n- The loops in the solve() function.\n\nLooking at the loops:\n\nThe first loop runs while getValueAtIndex(2 * nrstSeqStartIndx) < position:\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nInitially, nrstSeqStartIndx starts at 1. It doubles each iteration until getValue at twice that index is less than position. Wait, actually the condition is while getValue of (nrst *2) < position. So it's growing the index until it's too big.\n\nThen the second loop increments nrstSeqStartIndx while getValue of (nrst+1) <= position. So that narrows down the index to the upper bound of the current block containing the position?\n\nFinal step is computing the position - start of the block and add 1, then print it.\n\nNow, translating this logic into Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables: in Fortran, variables need to be declared with types. Since the Java uses long (64-bit integers), in Fortran, we can use integer(8) or kind=8 to use 64-bit integers to avoid overflow. So variables position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex should be of integer(kind=8).\n\nThe function getValueAtIndex needs to take a integer(kind=8) parameter and return the formula: 1 + (index-1)*index / 2. Since the values can get large, using integers for the computation is okay because Fortran does integer division.\n\nIn Fortran functions, functions can be written as:\n\nFUNCTION getValueAtIndex(index) RESULT(res)\n    integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(kind=8) :: res\n    res = 1 + (index -1)*index / 2\nEND FUNCTION\n\nNow, the main program structure:\n\nThe main in Java calls solve() and closes the output. So in Fortran, the main program would handle the solve logic. Also, the input reading is in a special class 'in' which uses a tokenizer. That part needs to be adapted.\n\nWait, in the original Java code's class 'in' handles the input methods. But in the solve() function, it uses sc.nextLong() which comes from the static Scanner associated with it. But in the Java code's main, it says in.init(System.in)... Wait, looking at the code again:\n\nWait the main method has in.init(System.in). But the in class's static method init takes an InputStream. But in the define of sc, the Scanner is constructed with a BufferedReader. Maybe there's some static initialization overlapping here. Maybe the 'sc' static variable is already initialized with the BufferedReader. But the code may have an error, but since this is the code to translate into Fortran, perhaps I can just focus on the logic and ignore the static variable initialization.\n\nWait, maybe sc is a Scanner that uses a BufferedReader with a large buffer. In Fortran, we can just read as usual since buffer handling is automated. So perhaps, the input is straightforward.\n\nThe solve routine in Fortran would start by reading from stdin a long (8-byte integer), which in Fortran is read as an integer(kind=8).\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nFortran code will have the main program as follows:\n\nprogram codeforces_622_A\n    implicit none\n    integer(kind=8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n    ! ... more variables as needed\n    ! Read position\n    read(*,*) position\n    ! Initialize nrst to 1\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n    ! First loop until getValue(2*nrst) < position:\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(2*nrs... t) < position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n    end do\n    ! Then second loop\n    do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n        nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n    end do\n    ! Now compute startIndex as Value at nrstSeqStartIndx\n    startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n    ! The answer is (position - start) +1\n    write(*,*) position - startIndex +1\ncontains\n\n! function getValueAtIndex\nFUNCTION ... as above\n\nEND program\n\nWait, the function is inside the program via contains.\n\nAlternatively, all functions can be defined before the main program. Since functions need to be declared before use.\n\nWait in Fortran, if the function is in a separate module, but here it can be an internal function or contained in the program via a contains block.\n\nSo the main program structure:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: position, ...\n\n    ! declarations\n\n    ! Read position\n    read(*,*) position\n\n    ...\n\ncontains\n    function getvalueatindex(index) result (res)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: index \n        integer(8) :: res\n        res = 1 + (index-1)*index / 2\n    end function getvalueatindex\nend program main\n\nNow the first loop:\n\nThe condition in Java:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx * 2) < position) {\n\nIn Fortran, it's a do while loop:\n\nnrstSeqStartIndx = 1\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx *2) < position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrst *2\nend do\n\nWait the variable names must be correct. Let's make sure in code:\n\nThe first loop: while the value of the getIndex of twice the current nrst is less than position, multiply by 2.\n\nThen the second loop: while the value of (nrst +1) is less or equal to position, increment nrst.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nThe second loop in Java:\n\nwhile (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx + 1) <= position) nrstSeqStartIndx++;\n\nWhich in Fortran:\n\ndo while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n    nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\nend do\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem with loops in Fortran is how they handle loop conditions. Since the loop is do while, the condition is checked first, so if it's initially false, the loop doesn't run.\n\nNow possible test case. For example:\n\nSuppose position is 3.\n\nThe actual sequence for index 1: GetValue(1) =1, index2:GetValue(2) =1 + (1*2)/2= 2. index3 is 1 + (2*3)/2 =4. So for position 3, the sequence's \"blocks\" are:\n\nThe first block up to index1: starts at 1 and ends at 1? The second block for index2 is 2, then the next block starts at index3's start is 4?\n\nWait the blocks are such that the block corresponding to index n starts at GetValueAtIndex(n), and each block is of length n. For instance, index 1 has length 1 (just 1), index2 has length 2 (values 2 and 3?), the index3 block would be from 4 to 5 (since 4 +2 (the length?) Wait no, wait the block for index k is the sequence of numbers from GetValue(k) to GetValue(k+1) -1. Wait perhaps each index corresponds to the start of a block, which the block length is that index.\n\nWait the function getValueAtIndex(k) returns the first element of the k-th block? Or the start of the block. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the Java code's getValueAtIndex function:\n\npublic static long getValueAtIndex(long index) {\n        return 1 + ((index - 1) * index / 2);\n}\n\nSo for index=1, 1 + (0 * 1)/2 =1.\n\nIndex=2: 1 + (1*2)/2 =1+1=2.\n\nindex3: 1+ (2*3)/2 =1+3=4.\n\nindex4: 1+ (3*4)/2 =1 +6=7.\n\nSo the blocks:\n\nk=1: the first element is 1, and the block length is 1.\n\nSo numbers:1.\n\nk=2: starts at 2, length 2: 2,3.\n\nk=3: starts at 4, length 3:4,5,6.\n\nk=4: starts at7, length4:7-10 (since starts at 7 and 4 numbers?)\n\nWait the length for block k is k.\n\nSo the starting index of the block sequence is the value from this function. For example, position=3 is in the block of index2, so the answer would be (3 - 2)+1 = 2. Which makes sense as the second position in the block (values 2 and 3).\n\nSo in that example, with position=3, the correct answer is 2. So the code should work.\n\nNow in Fortran code, after computing startIndex =getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqIndex), which in this case would be the index that includes the position. \n\nSo the algorithm works as follows:\n\nFirst, find the largest power of 2 such that the block's start is less than the position. Then, adjust upwards by incrementing to find the exact block.\n\nWait the first loop is doubling each time until we can't double anymore without exceeding the desired position. This helps to quickly reach a vicinity.\n\nThen the second loop increments to approach exactly the correct block.\n\nThis seems like a binary search? Not sure, perhaps it's an optimisation.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, variables need to be declared with integer(8). Let me write code structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_622_A\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: position, nrstSeqStartIndx, startIndex\n\n  read(*,*) position\n\n  nrstSeqStartIndx = 1\n  do while (getValueAtIndex(2 * nrstSeqStartIndx) < position)\n     nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx * 2\n  end do\n\n  do while (getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx +1) <= position)\n     nrstSeqStartIndx = nrstSeqStartIndx +1\n  end do\n\n  startIndex = getValueAtIndex(nrstSeqStartIndx)\n  write(*,'(i0)') position - startIndex +1\n\ncontains\n  function getValueAtIndex(index) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: index\n    integer(8) :: res\n    res = 1 + (index -1) * index /2\n  end function getValueAtIndex\n\nend program codeforces_622_A\n\nThis should be the code. Now check for possible issues:\n\n- In the loops, what if the position equals exactly the value at (nrst +1). The second loop would still increment, so the condition must allow for stopping correctly.\n\nTesting position=4:\n\ngetValue(3) is 4, so the block of index3 starts at 4. The block's length is 3, so 4 to 6. If position is 4, the answer is (4-4)+1=1.\n\nposition=4 would be in first position of the 3rd block.\n\nAnother test: position=7. Which is the start of index4. The first block (index4's value is 7. So the first part: let's see.\n\nnrst starts as 1:\n\nCheck 2*1 (2) \u2192 value is 2, then multiply by 2. \n\nnow 1*2=2. Now check if 2*2=4 gives value of GetValue(4) is7. So if position is > 7, but in this example position=7 is the start. Let's see.\n\nOriginal code in first loop:\n\nSuppose position is 7. Let's track steps:\n\n\u521d\u59cb nrst=1.\n\nCheck if GetValue(2*1)= GetValue(2)=2 <7 \u2192 yes. So multiply by 2. nrst=2.\n\nNow check GetValue(4)=7 <7? 7 is not less than 7 \u2192 no. So loop exits.\n\nSo then in the second loop:\n\nCheck GetValue(3)=4 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to 3.\n\nCheck GetValue(4)=7 <=7 \u2192 yes. So increment to 4.\n\nCheck GetValue(5)=1+ (4)(5)/2 =1 +10 =11? Wait no: index=5 \u2192 (5-1)*5/2 is 4*5/2=10 \u2192 total res 11. So 11 is larger than 7. So the loop stops because next value (nrst +1 =5) isGetValue(5)=11>7. \n\nThus, the loop runs when nrst is 4?\n\nWait in the second loop:\n\nInitially after first loop, nrst is 2. Wait wait let me track the first loop again with position=7.\n\nWait initial 1: the first loop condition: while GetValue(2*n) < position. \n\nFirst iteration:\n\nnrst=1 \u2192 2*1=2 \u2192 value 2 <7 \u2192 yes. So nrst becomes 2.\n\nCheck again 2*2=4 \u2192 GetValue(4) is 7. The value is 7?\n\nWait GetValue(2 * nrst =4) values 7 is exactly equal to position? No, since the loop's condition is <, so GetValue(2*current) <7 ?\n\nIf current is 2 \u2192 2*2 is 4 \u2192 getValue(4) is7. 7 <7 \u2192 no. So the condition (GetValue(4) <7 \u2192 false) so loop stops. \n\nThen, nrst is 2. Then the second loop starts at nrst=2.\n\nWait no, the first loop after nrst was 1 is multiply to 2, then check again:\n\nthe next check is when nrst is 2 \u2192 2*2 =4 \u2192 GetValue(4) is7. Since 7 <7 \u2192 no. So the inner loop stops. Then the second loop starts with nrst=2.\n\nWait wait, now the second loop:\n\nthe nrst is 2. \n\nNRST_SEQ_STARTINDX is 2.\n\nInside the second loop: while GetValue(2+1=3) is GetValue(3) =4. \n\n4 is less than or equal to 7 \u2192 yes, so add 1 to nrst \u2192 becomes 3.\n\nNow, we check again: check GetValue(3+1)= GetValue(4) is7, which is <=7 \u2192 yes \u2192 increment to 4.\n\nNow check GetValue(4+1)=5 \u2192 getValue(5)= (5-1)*5/2 \u21924*5/2=10 \u2192 res=1+10=11. \n\nNow, 11 >7 \u2192 loop condition is 11 <=7 \u2192 no. So exit the loop.\n\nNow nrst is 4. \n\nThe startIndex is GetValue(4)=7. The position is7 \u2192 (7-7)+1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nYes, so code works.\n\nAnother test with position=6. \n\nWhich block is this? \n\nindex3 starts at4. 4,5,6 are in it. \n\nSo for position6:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nStarts with nrst=1.\n\nCheck 2*1 \u21922 \u2192 GetValue is2 <6 \u2192 yes \u2192 nrst becomes 2.\n\nNow check 2*2 \u2192 value 7 >6. Wait no:\n\n GetValue(4)=7. Therefore 7 is >6 \u2192 the condition 7<6\u2192 no. \n\nThus, first loop stops with nrst =2.\n\nSecond loop: \n\nCheck GetValue(3)=4. \n\n4 \u22646 \u2192 true \u2192 increment to3.\n\nCheck nrst is now 3 \u2192 GetValue(3+1)=GetValue(4)=7 \u22646? No. So loop stops. So nrst is3.\n\nstartIndex =getValue(3)=4.\n\nPosition =6 \u2192 6-4 +1 = 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus the code seems correct.\n\nNow checking for Fortran specifics:\n\nIn Fortran, integer division. Since (index-1)*index is multiplied and then divided by 2.\n\nIn Fortran, if using integer variables, division is integer division. So (index-1)*index /2 is same as Java. Because in Java, using longs (integers), and that division would also be integer. So same in Fortran as long as index is integer.\n\nTherefore the getValueAtIndex function is correct.\n\nAnother possible point is variable declaration.\n\nVariables like nrstSeqStartIndx and others need to be properly declared as 8-byte integers.\n\nAlso, the Fortran code uses the 'contains' block to include the function.\n\nNow, the input in Fortran may have an issue if the input is read as an integer. But given that the Java code is using nextLong(), which is correct, in Fortran if the number is very big, but since using integer(8), which can handle up to ~10^18 approximately (depends on the system, but for the given problem, that should be enough).\n\nNow, the code should be translated as above. \n\nWait another minute: In the original Java code, in the main method, after the static Scanner and PrintWriter definitions, there's a call to in.init()?\n\nLooking again at the Java code's main method:\n\npublic static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n    in.init(System.in);\n    solve();\n    out.close();\n}\n\nThe 'in' class's init method is being called with System.in. However, the 'sc' static scanner is already initialized with Scanner(new BufferedReader(... BUFFERSIZE)). Maybe that in.init is redundant? Because in the code's 'in' class, the static init method initializes the reader and tokenizer, but the Scanner outside probably uses its own reader.\n\nHowever, the code may have an error here, but since the problem is to translate the code into Fortran, I can ignore the in.init() part because Fortran does not require this buffer handling (or maybe it does? Not sure about Fortran's read() command handling large integers. But I think that the standard read is sufficient for the problem's constraints.)\n\nIn any case, the Fortran code will have to read the position as a single integer from the first line of input, which is straightforward with read(*,*) position. So that's covered.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code should look like the code I wrote earlier."
