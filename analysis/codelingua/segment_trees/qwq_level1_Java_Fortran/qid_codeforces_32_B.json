Wait no, in newer Fortran versions like Fortran 90 and later, it's okay. Wait in the read statement, '(A)' is the format, but in F90, must be enclosed in apostrophes? Wait in Fortran 90, the read statement is written as:\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_string \n\nYes, the format must be enclosed in apostrophes ('). Wait no, no, actually, the edit descriptor in the format has to be inside quote marks.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program takes a string input, processes each character, and outputs numbers based on certain conditions.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses a Scanner to read input. In Fortran, I can read from the standard input using a read statement. But since the input might be a string ( likely a string like \"a.b.c...\" etc.), I should declare a character variable to hold it. The length might be an issue here. Maybe I can read it into a string with a sufficiently large length to hold any input line.\n\nWait, in the code, the input is read as a single token, which in Java uses next(), so it should be a single line without spaces. So in Fortran, I can use read(*,'(A)') to read a line.\n\nNext, the Java code converts the string to a char array. In Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so I can work with the string directly by indexing each character.\n\nThe variable 's' is a boolean. Fortran doesn't have a boolean type, but uses logicals. So I'll use a logical variable, say 's', which can be .true. or .false.\n\nNow, looping over each character. The loop in Java starts at 0, but in Fortran strings are 1-based by default. Wait, in Fortran, when you declare a character variable, let's say n(1:M), each element is a char. However, if I read the string as a single variable, like \"character(len=1000) :: s_in\", then each character can be accessed as s_in(i:i), right?\n\nWait, perhaps better to read the input as a string, say 'n', and then loop from 1 to len_trim(n) since trailing blanks may exist. Wait, but the input is from the user. Let's see: in the Java code, the input is a single string and gets converted into a char array, so maybe the input is a single token. In Fortran, using \"read(*,*) n\" could be problematic because it may not read exactly one word or might require a particular format. Alternatively, using \"read(*,'(A)') n\" reads up to a newline, so any whitespace included in the input would be part of it. But the problem probably expects spaces aren't there, so the input is a continuous string.\n\nSo, maybe first read the input into a sufficiently long string, say character(len=1000) :: s. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code in Java is processing each character in the string. So translating that loop:\n\nInitialize s as false. Then for each i from 0 to n.length -1 (in Java). In Fortran, it would be from 1 to n_length (since the length function gives the length here). Note that the string length can be found with len_trim() if there are trailing spaces, but if the input was read with a fixed-length string, then len_trim(n) gives the actual length. Alternatively, perhaps better to read into a variable with sufficient length and trim it.\n\nWait, in Java's code, the input is obtained by in.next(), which takes the next token. So in the Java code, the input is a single token (split at whitespace like spaces). But in the Fortran translation here, to replicate that, we probably need to read the entire line without parsing, perhaps the equivalent is to read a string, but now, how to handle that. Maybe the problem is designed so that the entire input is a single string without space, like in codeforces problems. So maybe just read the entire line into a string variable, and then work with each character until the end.\n\nAlternatively, the user enters a line, and the string is exactly the input. So in Fortran, using read(*,'(A)') s would work, where s is a character array long enough, say, length 1000.\n\nSo, in Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nlogical :: s_flag = .false.\ninteger :: i, len_s\n\nread(*,'(A)') s ! read the whole line into s\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i = 1, len_s\n   if (s(i:i) == '.') then\n      ! process the '.' case\n      if (s_flag) then\n          write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 1\n          s_flag = .false.\n      else\n          write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 0\n      end if\n   else\n      ! process other characters\n      if (s_flag) then\n          write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 2\n          s_flag = .false.\n      else\n          s_flag = .true.\n      end if\n   end if\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) ! to flush with a new line? Not sure if needed.\n\nend program\n\nHmm. Let me check the details here.\n\nFirst, the 'advance' argument in the write statement is necessary to keep output on the same line. If we don't have that, each write might start a new line, but in Fortran by default, the write statements may flush and so the output would come all in same line naturally?\n\nAlternatively, using the edit descriptor (I1) and setting advance='no' ensures that after each write, the cursor is not moved to the next line, so all outputs are on the same line.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if you do write(*,'(A)',advance='no'), that's for preventing the new line. Since in the Java code, everything is printed with System.out.print which does not add a new line. So in Fortran, each write statement that uses (I1) would print a number. So using advance='no' in all these write statements would be essential so that they come on same line.\n\nWait, in the code above, for example, in the first case: if s_flag is false, then write 0. So in the loop, each iteration appends its number.\n\nAlso, the loop over each character in s. The length of the input string is obtained via len_trim(s), so that it doesn't process leading or trailing spaces in case the user had some.\n\nWait, but the original code in Java uses the char array so it processes all characters, including any '.' and others. But if the user enters a string with leading or trailing spaces, the Java code would process those as well, but maybe in the problem's context, that's not the case. But since the problem is from codeforces, perhaps it's intended to process all the characters in the given input, so in Fortran using len_trim is okay.\n\nWait, but the Java code's next() function would read until whitespace, but the given Java code uses in.next(), so it would read a single token, so the Fortran approach of reading the entire line might not work. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the Java code uses a Scanner and next() which reads the next token. So, the input is a sequence of characters without spaces. Therefore, in Fortran, the same would be achieved by reading up to the first space, but maybe using \"read(*,*) s\" would require a sufficiently long string but that can be tricky. Alternatively, likely the problem is the input is a single token, and the user just enters a string like \"....a..\" or similar, so in Fortran, to read a single token, maybe using a list-directed read with \"read(*,*) s\", but Fortran strings need to be an array or a specific length.\n\nAlternatively, using list-directed input (the default read format):\n\nSay,\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: s\nread(*,*) s\n\nBut this may only read up to the first blank, but since the input line likely won't have any, it should work.\n\nHowever, for multi-line or when the input is part of other lines, it's better to read the entire line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code works correctly if the user enters the full string without any leading or trailing whitespace, so len_trim(s) would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to read the entire line regardless of any trailing characters except newline. Let me think: in the original Java code, next() will read the next token, so in the codeforces problem, the test input would be given as a single token. Hence, in Fortran, reading the entire line is okay, since any whitespace after the token may not be considered (or the problem ensures that the input is a single token). To make it precise, maybe using read(*, '(A)') s would read all characters until EOL, and s has exactly the input except for the EOL character. So the len_trim(s) will give the actual length of the input, unless trailing spaces were given which is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the code outline.\n\nNow, code in Fortran:\n\nNow, for the variables:\n\ns is a character array (or string) of sufficient length, say 1000 characters.\n\ns_flag is a logical variable, initially false.\n\nThe loop is over each character in s from 1 to len_trim(s).\n\nIn Fortran 90, you can index each character as s(i:i).\n\nThe logic:\n\nWhen the character is a '.' :\n\nIf s_flag is true:\n\n   write 1, then set s_flag to false.\n\nElse:\n\n   write 0.\n\nElse (the character is not a '.'):\n\nIf s_flag is true:\n\n   write 2, and set s_flag to false.\n\nElse:\n\n   set s_flag to true.\n\nAfter the loop, perhaps a newline must be written. In Java, the output is from System.out.print, so no new line at end. In Fortran, each write with '(I1)' would just write the number, so all together on same line. However, after the loop, the program ends and maybe a new line is needed. But in the Java code, after the main, it closes the scanner, but the output is all in one line.\n\nHence, in the Fortran code, after all the writes, since they are using advance='no', they should stay on the same line, and not a trailing newline. To confirm, in some cases, maybe the Fortran program just outputs everything and if the output is at the end of stream, perhaps the test cases just accept it.\n\nWait, but in some environments, if the last character is not a newline, it might be an issue. Let me see: the Java code uses System.out.print, so maybe the output is exactly what the problem expects, with no final new line. So in Fortran, it's better not to add any new line after the loop.\n\nWait in the Fortran code, after the last 'write' statement, the user is at some position in the line. If all the writes happened without newlines, then the total output would be correct.\n\nThe code as written in the loop has all writes with advance='no', so each is staying same line. So after the loop, the output is all correct.\n\nNow, regarding the actual write statements:\n\nThe Java code does System.out.print(1), so it outputs a single digit. In Fortran, using the '(I1)' format does that. The write statement with (I1) will write one character, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together.\n\nWait, testing some cases:\n\nFor example, let's say input is \"a.b\".\n\nThe first character is 'a': not '.', since s_flag initially .false., then in the else clause, because it's not a '.', so we set s_flag to true.\n\nSecond character is '.' : so s_flag is true (set in first step), so we write 1, set s_flag false.\n\nThird character 'b': checking s_flag is false, since after previous step, so else clause, set s_flag to true again?\n\nWait let's walk through Java code:\n\nFirst, the first character is 'a', not '.', so:\n\nElse clause: if s is false (since initially false), then set s = true.\n\nSecond character '.' (i=1 in Java? Since it starts at 0. Wait the original code has \"for (int i=0; i < n.length; i++) so the first character is n[0].\n\nWait the translation in Fortran uses 1-based indexes here.\n\nWait in this example, first character (index 1 in Fortran) is 'a', so it's not '.'.\n\nThen the code's else block:\n\nif (s_flag) then: s_flag was .false. (initially?), so else block: set s_flag = true.\n\nWait the initial s_flag is .false.\n\nYes, so after first character (a):\n\nelse: the else clause (char is not '.':\n\nSince s_flag is .false. (so else part), set s_flag = true.\n\nSecond character is '.' so enter if block (because, char is '.'). \n\nAt this point, s_flag is true. \n\nThen the code inside the '.' case: \n\nif (s) (which is true), so output 1, set s to false.\n\nThird character 'b' again not '.':\n\nThen in the else clause (not '.'):\n\nCheck if s_flag is true (now false?), because in previous step it was set to false after the 1 was printed.\n\nWait sorry after the second step (dot):\n\nThe code after processing '.' when s was true: \n\nso after the first step (a was processed, s_flag set to true). \n\nSecond step '.':\n\nsince s_flag is true, so we print 1 and set s_flag to false. \n\nThird character 'b': \n\nenter the else block (not '.') \n\nnow, since s_flag is false, so the else clause becomes true: set s_flag to true?\n\nWait in the code (Java):\n\nIn the else clause (the character is not '.'), the code:\n\nelse {\n\nif (s is true)\n\nthen output 2 and set s to false.\n\nelse set s = true.\n\nSo in the third character (b) which is not '.'.\n\nThen, s is false (after previous step).\n\nSo execute: s = true.\n\nSo for the three characters \"a.b\":\n\nThe output should be after each character:\n\nProcessing 'a' (not ., s was false) \u2192 s becomes true, no output.\n\nThen '.' (the second character):\n\nSince s was true, so print 1, set s to false.\n\nThen the third character is 'b', not '.', and s is now false \u2192 so set s to true. \n\nNo print in that step.\n\nThus the total output is \"1\".\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait the steps:\n\nInitially, s is false.\n\n1. char a (not '.'):\n\nElse block (not '.') \n\nif s (false) \u2192 else \u2192 set s to true.\n\n2. char '.' :\n\nif part (is '.'), so since s is true (from first step), then print 1, set s to false.\n\n3. char 'b' (not '.'):\n\nelse part (not '.'), \n\nthe s is false \u2192 so execute 's = true' \u2192 no print. \n\nTotal output only '1'.\n\nWait the input 'a.b' gives output 1. Let's see the Java code's steps:\n\nProcessing each character in the string (Java's n.toCharArray() -> the array has 'a', '.', 'b'.\n\nLoop starts from i=0:\n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\nchar is 'a', so else clause (not '.')\n\ns is false \u2192 set s to true.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\nchar is '.', so if case:\n\ns was true \u2192 print 1, set s to false.\n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\nchar is 'b', else clause:\n\nsince s is now false \u2192 set s to true \u2192 no output. \n\nSo the printed is 1. \n\nSo all steps correct.\n\nIn the Fortran code, in the third character, processing 'b' (char count is 3):\n\nsince the dot was processed, the 'b' triggers setting s_flag back to true, but there is no output for that character. \n\nThus the example would work. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, another test case: input 'a.'\n\nProcessing the first character 'a' (non.), s is initially false \u2192 set to true.\n\nSecond character '.' \u2192 s is true \u2192 print 1 and set s to false. \n\nTotal output is '1'.\n\nAnother case: input '.' (only '.')\n\nFirst iteration, the character '.' \u2192 s is false \u2192 print 0, s remains false? \n\nInside the '.' case when s is false, the else branch \u2192 print 0. \n\nBecause in the '.' case:\n\nif s is false (initial state) \u2192 then print 0. \n\nSo the code would output '0'.\n\nAnother case: input \"..\"\n\nFirst character '.' \u2192 s is false \u2192 print 0, s remains false.\n\nSecond character '.' \u2192 again s is false \u2192 print 0, s stays false.\n\nTotal output '00'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow back to Fortran code. Now, in the Fortran code, when writing the same code structure, I need to translate each of the Java conditionals correctly.\n\nLet me draft the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst the variables:\n\n! Declarations:\n\nimplicit none ! required because implicit is default, but better to declare all.\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_string\ninteger :: i\ninteger :: len_input\nlogical :: flag = .false.\n\n!\n\n! Read input:\n\n   read(*,'(A)',advance='no') input_string  ! Wait no: the advance is part of the format\n\nWait, no, the read is just a standard input. The edit descriptor for reading a string as a whole can be:\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_string\n\nThis reads until the next newline. Let me check.\n\nYes, in Fortran, read(*, '(A)') reads the entire line (including leading and trailing whitespace) except for the newline.\n\nlen_input = len_trim(input_string)\n\nThen loop over i from 1 to len_input.\n\nThen in each iteration:\n\nIf input_string(i:i) == '.' Then\n\n   check flag:\n\n      if flag is true \u2192 output '1', set flag to false.\n\n      else \u2192 output '0'\n\nElse \u2192 not '.' :\n\n   check flag:\n\n      if flag \u2192 output '2', set flag to false.\n\n      else \u2192 set flag to true.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n   do i = 1, len_input\n      if (input_string(i:i) == '.') then\n         if (flag) then\n            write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 1\n            flag = .false.\n         else\n            write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 0\n         end if\n      else\n         if (flag) then\n            write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 2\n            flag = .false.\n         else\n            flag = .true.\n         end if\n      end if\n   end do\n\nAfter the loop, since all the writes are using advance='no', the cursor is at the end of the output line, so we can just end the program without any further writes.\n\nWait, but after the last write, is there a need to flush? Fortran standard I/O should handle that, but in some test cases, maybe printing everything in one go may be better. However, this approach is correct.\n\nNow, some syntax points to check.\n\nThe declaration statements need to be in the program's declaration section.\n\nThe program could look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_32_B\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=1000) :: input_string\n  integer :: i, len_input\n  logical :: flag = .false.\n\n  read(*, '(A)' ) input_string\n  len_input = len_trim( input_string )\n\n  do i = 1, len_input\n\n      if (input_string(i:i) == '.' ) then\n\n          if (flag ) then\n              write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 1\n              flag = .false.\n          else\n              write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 0\n          end if\n\n      else\n\n          if (flag ) then\n              write(*,'(I1)', advance='no') 2\n              flag = .false.\n          else\n              flag = .true.\n          end if\n\n      end if\n\n  end do\n\nend program codeforces_32_B\n\nWait, but for the read statement, in some Fortran versions, the edit descriptors may require double quotes in the format? Wait no, in newer Fortran versions like Fortran 90 and later, it's okay.\n\nWait in the read statement, '(A)' is the format, but in F90, must be enclosed in apostrophes?\n\nWait in Fortran 90, the read statement is written as:\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_string \n\nYes, the format must be enclosed in apostrophes ('). \n\nWait no, no, actually, the edit descriptor in the format has to be inside quote marks. Wait the correct syntax is:\n\nread(*, '(A)') input_string \n\nWait actually, the syntax is read(*, '(A)') variable \u2014 that's correct.\n\nTesting this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using list-directed read with:\n\nread(*,*) input_string \n\nBut that requires that the input is given as a quoted string? Otherwise, leading whitespace can be ignored etc. Probably using the '(A)' format is better for reading the entire line.\n\nNow, the initialize of 'flag' is .false. At each step, the processing is correct.\n\nNow, testing some edge cases.\n\nTesting input empty: but the problem possibly has n as a non-empty string. \n\nAnother case: input \".........\".\n\nEach '.' character:\n\nFirst character '.' :\n\nflag is .false. \u2192 output '0', flag remains .false.?\n\nWait processing each '.' in sequence:\n\nFirst '.' (i=1):\n\nflag is .false. \u2192 write '0', flag remains .false.\n\nSecond ('.'):\nstill flag is false \u2192 write '0'.\nAnd so on for all characters.\n\nThe output is '000000...' as many dots.\n\nThat is correct, because for each . when flag is false, outputs '0', and flag is not set.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcd' \u2014 non '.' characters, all.\n\nInitially flag is false.\n\nFirst 'a':\n\nnot . \u2192 check flag (false) \u2192 set flag to true.\n\nThen second 'a': not '.' \u2192 flag is true: then write '2' and set to false.\n\nWait third character 'a' again. \n\nProcessing each character step by step:\n\nFirst character 'a':\n\nflag is false \u2192 set flag to true.\n\nSecond 'a' (i=2):\n\nnot . \u2192 flag is true \u2192 write '2', set to false.\n\nThird 'a' (i=3):\n\nnow flag is false again \u2192 set to true (no output).\n\nFourth 'b' (i=4): \n\nflag was set to true in previous step \u2192 so when processing this character, flag is true \u2192 write 2 and set to false?\n\nWait let's think:\n\nIn the third character (i=3 \u2192 third in the 'aabcd' is third 'a'):\n\nafter i=2 (second char 'a'), flag is set to false when processing the second character (outputting 2, so set to false).\n\nSo after second character:\n\nflag set to false.\n\nThird character (third 'a'):\n\nnot '.' \u2192 check flag (which is false). \u2192 then set flag to true.\n\nSo third step: no write, just setting flag.\n\nFourth character (fourth 'b'):\n\nnot '.' \u2192 check flag (true now?), because flag was set by third character's processing.\n\nWait after third character:\n\nthe third character's processing was 'a' (not '.'):\n\nflag was false (after second character processing), so enter else clause of the if (flag):\n\n \u2192 'set flag to true' \u2192 so after third character, flag is true.\n\nThen fourth character (fourth, 'b'):\n\nsince it is not '.', and flag is true (because of third step):\n\nso \u2192 in the else part (not '.'), then:\n\nif (flag .eqv .true), then:\n\nwrite '2' and set flag to false. \n\nSo for the fourth character: outputs 2.\n\nSo the outputs for the sequence 'a a a b ...' (aabcd):\n\nFirst 'a': no output, flag is true.\n\nSecond 'a': outputs 2 (because flag was true), sets flag to false.\n\nThird 'a': \u2192 flag was false \u2192 set to true, no output.\n\nFourth 'b' \u2192 flag true \u2192 output 2 again, flag set to false.\n\nThe fifth character (d) \u2192 similar.\n\nThus the total output for aabcd (5 chars): \n\nOutput would be 2 (from second 'a') and 2 (from 'b'), etc.\n\nHmm, but the initial sequence's first character 'a' has output 0? Or no output? Let me see.\n\nThe first 'a' is the first character.\n\nProcessing first character 'a':\n\n\u2192 not '.', so:\n\ns_flag (flag) is initially .false \u2192 else clause \u2192 set to true.\n\nSo no output here.\n\nSecond character 'a':\n\nnow, s_flag is true \u2192 thus, execute the first clause (if flag):\n\nso write '2', sets flag to false.\n\nThird character 'a':\n\nso, not '.' and flag was false (from second step): set to true \u2192 no output.\n\nFourth character (fourth, 'b'):\n\nflag is true \u2192 write '2', set to false.\n\nFifth character 'd':\n\nflag is false \u2192 set to true \u2192 no output.\n\nThus the output is '22' (from 2nd an 4th characters):\n\nSo input \"aabcd\" (5 letters) would output '22'\n\nYes.\n\nIn Fortran code, this should be handled correctly.\n\nAnother example with 'ab' \u2192 the first character triggers flag to true, second character (b) is non '.' when s_flag is true, so writes 2, then flag is set to false. \n\nThus the code for 'ab' would produce '2'.\n\nAll right, so the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the translated Fortran code would be as outlined above. Now, code for Fortran."
