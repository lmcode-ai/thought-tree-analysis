Let me see n=6:\n\nInitial output is 6 and space. m=6 Then loop from i=5, down to 1:\n\ni=5: 6 mod5 is 1, so no.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2, so no.\n\ni=3: 6 mod3=0 \u2192 print 3, then m=3.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads an integer n from the user, then prints n followed by a space. Then it initializes m with the value of n. It loops from i = n-1 down to 1. For each i, if m is divisible by i (meaning m mod i is zero), it prints i and a space, then updates m to be i. So essentially, it's outputting n followed by the largest possible sequence of numbers in decreasing order where each divides the previous one.\n\nHmm. Now I need to do the same in Fortran. Let's think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have a Scanner class like Java. In Fortran, I/O is done with read and write statements. So for input, I'll need to read an integer n from the user. \n\nThe main steps would be:\n\n1. Read n from stdin.\n2. Print n followed by a space.\n3. Initialize m as n.\n4. Loop from i = n-1 down to 1:\n   a. Check if m mod i is zero.\n   b. If yes, print i and space, then set m = i.\n5. End loop and program.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, loops can be structured with do loops. The for loop in Java is straightforward, so translating that to a do loop should be manageable.\n\nFirst, I need to declare variables. In Fortran, variables must be declared. So something like:\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\n\nThen, read the input. The Fortran read statement would be:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen print n with a space. In Fortran, the write statement can be used. To print without a newline, maybe we can control the format. By default, write adds a newline unless told otherwise. So perhaps:\n\nwrite(*,*) n, ' '\n\nWait, but the Java code uses System.out.println which adds a newline at the end, but in the Java code, the first System.out.println(n + \" \") would print the number followed by a space and then a new line. So maybe the output would have a space and then a new line. Let me check the Java code again. The code has:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nWhich appends the space before the new line. So in Fortran, I need to output similarly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the Fortran code, each number is printed followed by a space, so that all the numbers are on the same line. Therefore, using write with an asterisk and a comma-separated list might automatically handle spaces, but it would end with a new line. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the Fortran code should print all the numbers in one line. Let me see:\n\nThe Java code does:\n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \"); \n\nfollowed by a loop that prints each i with System.out.println(i + \" \");\n\nWait, that's actually incorrect. Wait, in the Java code, the first print is a System.out.println which adds a new line. Then, in the for loop, each iteration also uses System.out.println, which adds a new line each time, so the actual output is each number on a separate line. Wait, but the problem says that the code should be translated to Fortran. Let me look again at the Java original code:\n\nWait, the first line is \n\nSystem.out.println(n + \" \");\n\nThat would print the number n followed by a space, then a new line, because println ends with a new line. The next line is in the loop, and that also uses System.out.println, so every i is printed with a space and new line. Which would result in each number being on its own line, with a space at the end of each line. \n\nHmm, but maybe that's a formatting mistake. Is the intended output a single line with all numbers separated by spaces? Because the Java code as written would generate multiple lines. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement's Java code. Let me double-check. The original code:\n\npublic class codeforces_58_B {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int n = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(n + \" \"); // first line: n followed by a space, then new line.\n        int m = n;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n            if (m % i == 0) {\n                System.out.println(i + \" \"); \n                m = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYes, this will print each number on a separate line, with a space at the end. That's not standard. But maybe the problem expects that. So when translating to Fortran, we have to replicate that output exactly. So first print n plus space and a new line. Then each line in the loop will have i plus space and new line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake, but according to the problem, to translate exactly, must replicate the output.\n\nSo each number is printed on separate lines with a trailing space and newline. So that's the target output.\n\nNow, in Fortran:\n\nFirst, after reading n, the program needs to print n followed by a space, then new line.\n\nThen for each i in the loop where the condition is met, print the same.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\n\nStart with reading:\n\nread (*,*) n\n\nThen printing n followed by space and new line.\n\nBut in Fortran, each write(*) statement typically adds a new line. So:\n\nwrite(*,\"(i0,1x)\") n --> this would print n, then a space.\n\nWait, but the format \"(i0,1x)\" would print the number with no leading spaces, then a space. Then the write statement would proceed to a new line. So that would fulfill the first line as in Java.\n\nThen in the loop:\n\nThe loop in Java is for (i = n-1 downto 1):\n\ndo i = n-1,1,-1\n\nThen inside, check if mod(m,i) == 0\n\nIf yes: then print i with a space and new line. So similar to first write statement.\n\nm = i\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variables are declared at the start, which they are here.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nStarting with a program:\n\nprogram codeforces_b\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\n\nread(*,*)n\n\nwrite(*,*) n, ' ' \n\nWait no. Wait, using write(*, '(a)') ... but maybe better to control the formatting.\n\nWait in the first write statement: I want to output the number n followed by a space, and then a new line. Using write with *( comma) will add a space between the number and the space, which we don't want. Hmm.\n\nWait in Fortran, when using write(*,*) n,\" \" that would print n followed by a space. Since the comma in the argument list will separate the outputs with a separator (default space?), so that would be okay. So n and \" \" written with a space in between? Wait, no: writing a number followed by a string.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nwrite(*,*) n, ' ' \n\nThis would first write the integer n, and then a character(' '). The comma in the list uses default formatting, so each item is separated by space. But e.g., to print an integer followed by a space, the number is printed and then the literal character ' ' is written as a space. Wait, but writing a literal character like that as a separate element would make two elements: n (as a number) and then the character string ' ' (which is a literal space). The separator between the two elements would also be a space, so it would write the value, then space, then space. Wait that might not be right. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you use:\n\nwrite(*, *) n, ' ' \n\nThe first variable is n (integer), so it is printed as default integer format. Then the next is the string ' ', so a character. The comma between them means that the first item is written with a separator (space), then the next. So the output would be for example, if n is 5: \n\n\"5  \" followed space. Hmm, so that would be two spaces. Because n is written, followed by the default separator (space), then the character string which is also a space, so total three characters: 5 followed by two spaces?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is overcomplicating. In Java, the code does System.out.println(n + \" \"); which converts n to a string, appends a space, then appends a newline. So in Fortran, perhaps write(*, '(A)') trim(adjustl(str(n))) // \" \" \n\nWait, but converting integers to strings can be done via edit descriptors. Alternatively, we can use the formatting to avoid separators.\n\nAlternatively, better to use format specification to ensure exactly the desired output.\n\nLet me think of the first write as: write the integer, then a single space, then a new line.\n\nTo do that:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, 1X)') n\n\nWait 1X is a single space. Wait but I0 will print the integer, then a comma separates, which the 1X adds space? Hmm maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nThe format is I0 followed by a space. So:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A)') n, ' '; then a new line.\n\nWait, I need to send the entire first write to be the value, then space. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, 1X)') n\n\nBecause I0 writes the number, and then followed by 1X adds a single space. But then, does that add a new line? Yes, because the default for write is to advance to the next line. So that would output the number, space, then new line. So that's exactly what Java does. \n\nThen in the loop, for each valid i, the same format:\n\nwrite(*,'(I0,1X)') i\n\nWait, that would print the number followed by a space and then new line. That would match the Java code's output.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nInitialize m as n:\n\nm = n \n\nLoop from i =n-1 downto 1.\n\nThen inside:\n\nif mod(m,i)==0 then:\n\nprint via the format above, then m =i.\n\nWait, but in Fortran the block structure uses loops and conditionals with keywords like do and end do, if followed by then and end if.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nread in n\n\nwrite the first line as n followed by space and newline.\n\nm = n\n\ndo i = n-1, 1, -1\n\n    if mod(m,i) ==0 then:\n\n        write output i with space and new line\n\n        m =i\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait but in Fortran, 'mod' is a function. So mod(m, i) equals zero.\n\nSo the code.\n\nNow, variables need to be declared as integer.\n\nProgram codeforces_b\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, m, i\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  write(*, '(I0,1X)') n\n\n  m = n\n\n  do i = n-1,1,-1:\n\n    if (mod(m, i) ==0) then\n\n       write(*, '(I0,1X)') i\n\n       m =i\n\n    end if\n\n  end do\n\nend program codeforces_b\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop is from n-1 down to 1, decrementing by 1. So the syntax is: do i = n-1, 1, -1. \n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nWait, but what about the loop: in Fortran, the loop will run for i from n-1 down to 1. So that's correct.\n\nTesting this code for n=5.\n\nLet me walk through.\n\nSuppose n=5.\n\nFirst, output is 5 followed by a space and new line.\n\nThen m is 5.\n\nLoop starts with i=4 down to 1.\n\ni=4: check 5 mod 4? 5 divided by 4 is 1, remainder 1. So mod(5,4)=1\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\ni=3: 5 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 no.\n\ni=2: 5 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: 5 mod1 is 0. So yes, print 1 followed by space and new line. Then m is set to 1.\n\nThe next i would be 0 (no, since down to 1, so after 1, it stops).\n\nTherefore outputs:\n\n5\n\n1\n\nWait but wait, in the loop:\n\nWait, starting from 4, the loop steps down by 1 until i reaches1. So for 5, the loop iterations are i=4,3,2,1. \n\nWhen i=1, since mod(5,1) is 0, then it will print 1, then m becomes 1. But in the next steps, but after that the loop continues until the loop has finished. \n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nLet me see n=6:\n\nInitial output is 6 and space. m=6\n\nThen loop from i=5, down to 1:\n\ni=5: 6 mod5 is 1, so no.\n\ni=4: 6 mod4 is 2, so no.\n\ni=3: 6 mod3=0 \u2192 print 3, then m=3.\n\nThen i=2: check m=3 \u2192 mod(3,2)=1 \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: mod(3,1)=0 \u2192 print 1, m=1.\n\nThus the output lines are:\n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\nSo the numbers are 6 3 1 each on their own line with a space (and then newline). Which satisfies the code's functionality.\n\nLooking back at Java code. The Java code uses System.out.println(n + \" \"); which after the number adds a space, but the next lines are same, so each number (after the first) is on their own line, with a space at end (so each line has a space, then newline). \n\nSo the Fortran code uses the same format, which matches exactly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the write statement's format (I0, 1X) should correctly display the number with no leading spaces (as I0 is variable width), followed by a space, then advance to the next line.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code as outlined should be correct.\n\nI think that's the solution."
