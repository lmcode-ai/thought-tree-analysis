But if ai is mod_val (e.g. mod_val=7, and ai=7), then LCM would include 7 (assuming 7 is part of the array). Then modLcm will be LCM mod mod_val \u2192 LCM= multiple of 7, so modLcm mod 7 is 0. Then modDiv(0,7, 7) will require inverse of7 mod 7 \u2192 which is undefined. But here, the numerator is zero, so 0 /7 mod mod_val would be 0.

So probably safe. Thus, the code in mod_div should have:\n\n     mod_div = mod(a, modul) * mod_inv(b, modul) \n     mod_div = mod(mod_div, modul)\n\nWait, but the function returns the product modulo mod_val. So, yes. But in code written earlier:\n\nIn mod_div: mod_inv is called as mod_inv( modulo(b, mod_val ), modul ) Wait mod_val is 1e9+7, which is mod_val (parameter in main). So modulo(b, mod_val) is equivalent to mod(b, mod_val). But in mod_inv function, the second parameter is modul, which is also mod_val. So whether it needs to be passed or not. But in code in the previous attempt, the code had:\n\nmod_inv is written as:\n\ninteger(8) function mod_inv(x, modul) mod_inv = mod_pow(x, modul-2, modul)\nend function mod_inv Yes, that's correct. So in the mod_div function, mod_inv is passed (b, modul) as arguments. Wait the mistake in the code as written earlier: when writing mod_inv in mod_div, I mistakenly used mod_val instead of modul. Ah! That's a critical error. So in mod_div function:\n\ninstead of:\n\nmod_inv( modulo(b, mod_val), modul )\n\nit should be:\n\nmod_inv( b, modul )\n\nBecause the modular inverses are mod modul (the third parameter to mod_div).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle translating this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I need to understand what the Java code is doing. Let's see. The main goal is to compute some answer involving the least common multiple (LCM) of an array of integers, then perform modular arithmetic with that LCM.\n\nLooking at the Java code, the steps are:\n\n1. Read N and the array A.\n2. Compute the LCM of all elements in A using BigInteger.\n3. Compute modLcm which is LCM mod 1e9+7 (since mod is 1000000007).\n4. For each element ai in A, compute (modLcm / ai) mod mod, then sum all those values, mod mod again.\n5. The helper functions handle modular division, inverse, and exponentiation.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Since Fortran has different constructs, I need to think about:\n\n- How to read inputs.\n- Handling large numbers for LCM (since Fortran might need modules for big integers, but maybe there's another approach? Wait the Java code uses BigInteger, which can handle arbitrary precision. Fortran doesn't natively have that. Hmm, this could be a problem. Because multiplying large integers might cause overflow, but maybe in the given problem constraints, the LCM can be represented as a 64-bit integer? Probably not for large N and big numbers. Wait but the problem here must have constraints. Let me check the problem's constraints for AtCoder ABC152 E.\n\nWait, I don't have the problem statement, but since the Java code uses BigInteger, perhaps the LCM could be huge, so using integers might not work. Hmm, this is an issue. Fortran doesn't have built-in arbitrary precision integers like Java's BigInteger. This might be tricky. How does the code use the LCM? It first mod it by mod (1e9+7) to get modLcm, which is then used in the sum.\n\nWait the modLcm is the LCM mod mod. So the actual LCM is modulo 1e9+7. So maybe the problem requires calculating LCM mod 1e9+7? Or do we need to first compute the LCM, then mod it by mod? Because in the code, they compute lcm using BigInteger and then take mod mod.\n\nBut in Fortran, if we can't handle big integers for LCM, then perhaps the problem's constraints are not too strict. Let me think; maybe the problem allows N to be small enough such that the LCM can be represented as a 64-bit integer? Otherwise, this would be a blocker. Looking at the problem name \"atcoder_ABC152_E\", which is in a contest. Assuming the constraints of that problem allow the LCM to be within 2^64, which is possible for programming contest problems. So maybe we can compute LCM as an integer64 and proceed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\n- Read N and array A.\n- Compute LCM of all A's elements using integer kind(8) (64 bits)\n- Compute modLcm = lcm mod mod_val (mod_val is 1e9+7).\n- Then, compute the sum over all ai of (modLcm / ai) mod mod_val, but using modular inverse.\n\nWait, the modDiv function in Java does a/(b mod mod), but actually, the modular division is done by multiplying a * inv(b mod mod) mod mod. Wait the Java's modDiv function seems to take a mod mod first, then multiply by inverse of b mod mod. Because (a mod p) * inv(b) mod p is equivalent to (a / b) mod p, provided b divides a modulo p?\n\nHmm, but the math here is such that modDiv is supposed to compute a divided by b modulo mod.\n\nWait in the problem, since the LCM of the array is divisible by each ai (since LCM is a multiple of each term). Therefore, LCM mod mod is congruent to a multiple of ai mod mod, so a division here is permitted. So modDiv(a, b, mod) is (Lcm mod mod) divided by (ai) mod mod.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nans += modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod); \n\nwhich is (modLcm / ai) mod mod. But modLcm is LCM mod mod. Since LCM is divisible by ai, modLcm mod ai (the denominator) might not be zero but due to mod, perhaps causing issues. Wait no, because LCM is a multiple of ai, so LCM = k*ai. Then modLcm is LCM mod mod. So modLcm = LCM - mod * m = ai*(k - mod*m/ai). So modLcm mod ai will be LCM mod ai mod ai. Since LCM is divisible by ai, LCM mod ai is zero, so modLcm mod ai = (Lcm mod mod) mod ai. Hmm. However, when mod is less than ai, this might not hold. So maybe in this problem, mod is a prime number? mod is 1e9+7 which is a prime. So the inverse exists for ai only if ai and mod are coprime. Wait, but if ai divides LCM, and mod is a prime, then LCM mod ai mod mod is not necessarily zero. Hmm. Wait the problem's approach may require that a / b mod mod is possible only if b and mod are coprime, but in this problem, since mod is prime, but if ai is a multiple of mod, then inverse would not exist. But in the problem, the input numbers might be constrained such that mod is prime and none of the a_i contain mod as a factor (since mod is 1e9+7, which is a big prime, so unless the input includes that number, which would be a stretch), so perhaps the code is correct.\n\nHowever, in any case, for the code translation, I need to replicate the computation steps as is.\n\nNow, putting all this into Fortran steps:\n\nProblem Steps in Fortran:\n\nRead N and array A.\n\nCompute LCM of all elements.\n\nFor the LCM in Fortran, need to compute LCM using integers. The LCM for two numbers a and b is (a*b)/gcd(a,b). So for the iterative approach:\n\nInitialize LCM as 1.\n\nFor each ai in A:\n\n   compute tmp_gcd = gcd(lcm_current, ai)\n\n   new_lcm = lcm_current * (ai/tmp_gcd)\n\n   to prevent overflow, perhaps do it as lcm = (lcm / d) * ai, where d is gcd(lcm, ai). But must ensure that lcm is divisible by d, which it is.\n\nBut how to avoid overflow? Suppose N is small, say up to 1e5? But for coding contests, the constraints may be up to 1e5 numbers, but then LCM can be enormous. But in Fortran using 64-bit integers, even 2^63 is about 9e18, so for say 20 numbers of size 1e5, LCM can go beyond 64 bits. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait maybe for the problem AtCoder ABC152 E, the LCM is handled mod mod early?\n\nWait in the original code, after calculating the LCM, they immediately mod it by mod to get modLcm? But no, the code: modLcm is lcm.mod mod. Because the LCM could be huge, and thus can't be computed otherwise with big integers. Since the problem requires modLcm mod mod, the final answer is computed using modLcm mod mod. Therefore, even if the actual LCM is very large, the modLcm can be computed on the fly mod mod, which might be possible without calculating the full LCM?\n\nHmm, the code in Java is just computing LCM, then doing mod mod. But in Fortran, if we can't hold the LCM's value, perhaps there is a way to track lcm mod mod during computation, while still keeping track of the actual lcm necessary for the subsequent part? Not sure. Or perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the LCM fits into a 64-bit integer? Let me think, for example, suppose all a_i are up to 1e9 and N up to 20, then LCM could be no more than 1e18, which is manageable. Maybe the constraints there are like that, so that it's feasible.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nImplementing LCM in Fortran:\n\nFortran has a function for GCD: it uses the GCD intrinsic function in Fortran 2008, but maybe I should write my own because not all compilers support it. Alternatively, I can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nWait, GCD is easy to implement:\n\nFUNCTION gcd(a, b) RESULT(g)\n   INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a, b\n   INTEGER(8) :: g, x, y\n   x = a\n   y = b\n   DO WHILE (y /= 0)\n      g = MOD(x, y)\n      x = y\n      y = g\n   END DO\n   g = x\nEND FUNCTION gcd\n\nWait, but for negative numbers? Probably not necessary here since problem inputs are positive.\n\nSo, LCM function can be written as:\n\nFUNCTION lcm(a, b) RESULT(l)\n   INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a, b\n   INTEGER(8) :: l\n   l = (a / gcd(a,b)) * b\nEND FUNCTION\n\nWait, but when multiplying, there might be temporary overflow. However, as long as the final product fits in the integer8 (64-bit) type, it's okay. So assuming that the product (a*b) would fit divided by GCD? Because LCM(a,b)= a*b / gcd(a,b), so it's safe mathematically, but computationally, as long as a/gcd(a,b) multiplied by b is <= 2^63-1.\n\nSo proceeding under those constraints. So compute LCM for all elements in array A iteratively.\n\nNow, for the array A, in Fortran:\n\nWe can read it into an array of integer(8).\n\nNow, the algorithm for the LCM:\n\nlcm_val = 1\n\ndo i =1 to N\n\n   lcm_val = lcm(lcm_val, A(i))\n\nend do\n\nThus, this gives us the LCM in LCM_val of type integer(8), provided it doesn't overflow.\n\nThen, compute mod_val = 1000000007. So mod_val is set as an integer constant.\n\nmodLCM = lcm_val MOD mod_val\n\nWait but lcm_val can be 64-bit. mod_val is 1e9+7 is about 1e9 which is 30 bits. Thus MOD can be done with 64-bit number mod 1e9+7, which is fine. Because 64-bit modulus a 30-bit modulus would be manageable.\n\nNext, compute ans as the sum over all ai of modDiv(modLCM, ai, mod_val), mod mod_val.\n\nNow, modDiv(a,b,mod) is (a % mod) * inv(b mod mod, mod) mod mod.\n\nWait, in the original code, modDiv is defined as (a%mod) * modInv(b, mod) mod mod.\n\nWait the first line is (a mod mod) * inv(b) mod mod. But since the inputs are a and b here. Let's see.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nmodDiv(a,b,mod): returns (a%mod * modInv(b,mod)) mod mod.\n\nThe modInv function computes the modular inverse of b mod mod, using Fermat's little theorem since mod is prime.\n\nThus modInv(b, mod) is pow(b, mod-2, mod).\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nImplement modInv via modPow via the exponent mod-2.\n\nSo need to write modPow which is exponentiation by squaring mod mod.\n\nNow for functions in Fortran:\n\nThe Fortran code will have functions for modDiv, modInv, modPow.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can be placed in modules, but for simplicity, since this is an executable program, perhaps they can be included as internal functions or at the end.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran requires that functions are declared before they are used, or in modules. Let me arrange the code structure as follows:\n\nThe main program reads the inputs, computes LCM, then modLcm.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nThe helper functions:\n\nFUNCTION mod_inv(x, mod_val) RESULT(inv)\n...\n\nFUNCTION mod_pow(b, e, mod_val) RESULT(pow_result)\n...\n\nFUNCTION mod_div(a, b, mod_val) ... etc.\n\nWait functions in Fortran can be placed after program statements as long as they are after the program. Wait no, you can have all the function definitions at the end of the program.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to structure the code with all functions first.\n\nSo the steps for Fortran:\n\nProgram outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC152_E\n   implicit none\n   integer, parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007\n   integer(8) :: N\n   integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n   integer(8) :: lcm_val, modLcm\n   integer(8) :: ans\n   integer(8) :: i, ai\n   !

Wait, better to write LCM via function?\n      ! rhs = LCM(lcm_val, ai)\n      ! So create a function.\n   end do\n   modLcm = lcm_val MOD mod_val\n   ans = 0\n   do i =1,N\n      ai = A(i)\n      ans = mod(ans + modDiv(modLcm, ai, mod_val), mod_val)\n   end do\n   write(*,*) ans\n\ncontains\n\n   integer(8) function gcd(a, b)\n      implicit none\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n      integer(8) :: x, y, g\n      x = a\n      y = b\n      do while(y /=0)\n          g = mod(x,y)\n          x = y\n          y = g\n      end do\n      gcd = x\n   end function gcd\n\n   integer(8) function lcm(a,b)\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n      lcm = (a * b) / gcd(a,b)\n   end function lcm\n\n   integer(8) function mod_inv(x, modul)\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: x, modul\n      mod_inv = mod_pow(x, modul -2, modul)\n   end function mod_inv\n\n   integer(8) function mod_div(a,b, modul)\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b, modul\n      mod_div = mod(a, modul) * mod_inv(modulo(b, mod_val), modul) \n      mod_div = mod(mod_div, modul)\n   end function mod_div\n\n   integer(8) function mod_pow(b,e,modul)\n      integer(8), intent(in) :: b, e, modul\n      integer(8) :: base, exponent\n      integer(8) :: result\n      base = mod(b, modul)\n      result = 1\n      exponent = e\n      do while (exponent >0)\n         if (btest(exponent,0)) then\n            result = mod(result * base, modul)\n         end if\n         base = mod(base * base, modul)\n         exponent = rshift(exponent,1)\n      end do\n      mod_pow = result\n   end function mod_pow\n\nend program atcoder_ABC152_E\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait, the mod_div is written as (a mod modul) * inv(mod(b, modul)) mod modul?\n\nWait, in the original code's modDiv, the first argument is a, and the second is b. So modDiv computes (a % mod) * inv(b) mod mod. But modInv is the inverse of b mod mod.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nYes, in the code:\n\nJava:\n\nmodDiv(a,b,mod) = (a%mod) * modInv(b, mod) % mod.\n\nBut in the problem context, since LCM is divisible by ai, so a = LCM mod mod might not be divisible by ai mod mod, but because LCM is divisible by ai, but when mod is applied, it may not be.\n\nWait, but in the problem's logic, it's possible that when mod is applied, the division isn't valid, which would imply an error. But the original code must be correct so probably there's a guarantee that the inverse exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps because mod is prime and b and mod are coprimes (since mod is big, and ai comes from the input data which may not have a factor of mod. Since 1e9+7 is a large prime, and the input numbers are probably within a different range, such as up to 1e9.\n\nThus, using Fermat's theorem to compute inverse is okay.\n\nBut in the above code, mod_inv's parameter is x and modul, but in mod_div function, when calling mod_inv, which is required for b?\n\nSo in mod_div, the code has mod_inv(modulo(b, mod_val), modul). Wait the mod_inv function's first argument is b, but the second argument here is mod_val, but in the parameters of mod_div the modul is already equal to mod_val. Alternatively, perhaps the parameters are inconsistent. Let me check:\n\nLooking back.\n\nThe mod_inv function is in mod_pow, which uses modul as the parameter. In mod_div, the modul is passed as \"modul\".\n\nWait, the modDiv function's code:\n\nThe function mod_div function takes a, b, modul as parameters and returns (a mod modul)*inverse(b mod modul) mod modul.\n\nYes. So the function mod_inv is passed (b mod modul) as first argument? Wait no, in the parameter:\n\nThe mod_inv(x, modul) is correct, where x is b's value mod modul?\n\nWait, actually in modDiv(a/b) mod p:\n\nWe want (a / b mod p), which is a * b^{p-2} mod p.\n\nSo yes, the inverse of b mod p is modInv(b, p).\n\nThus, in mod_div:\n\nthe inv should be mod_inv(b, modul), not mod_inv(b mod modul). Because if b mod mod is coprime, then mod_inv(b, modul) is same as mod_inv(b mod modul, modul), which is better for the function's logic.\n\nThus, the code as currently written in mod_div would have:\n\nmod_inv( b, modul)\n\nSo why the modulo? Because b could be negative? Not necessary. Since we're working mod modul, but since we're taking the inverse, it's better to take the mod first to ensure we are working modulo modul. So, perhaps it's better to write:\n\nmod_inv( modulo(b, modul), modul). Since b could be negative, but in problem's context it's positive. Hmm, but in original code, the b is ai which is read from input. So it's positive.\n\nThus, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nBut in the code above, in mod_div function:\n\nmod_inv is called with b as its first parameter but modul as second. Wait, no, the mod_inv function is called as mod_inv(modulo(b, mod_val), modul). Wait but the second parameter modul is the same as mod_val? Because mod_div parameters include modul. Wait in the code above:\n\nWait, in the mod_div function, code:\n\nmod_div = mod(a, modul) * mod_inv(modulo(b, mod_val), modul)\n\nBut mod_val is defined as a parameter in the main program. But mod_div is called with the same mod_val.\n\nWait the mod_div is written as part of the program's \"contains\" section, so mod_val is in scope here.\n\nWait the function mod_div is inside main's contains, right? The code as written would have mod_inv called with mod_val as second parameter? Probably yes.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a mistake. Since mod_div's third parameter is modul, which is the mod for that call. Which in the context of our problem, the modul is mod_val, but if called elsewhere, that's not the case. But in our case, mod_val is fixed as 1e9+7, so perhaps everything is okay.\n\nWait the code:\n\nmod_div's parameters are a,b,modul. So when we call modDiv in the main code, the modul is mod_val. Hence, inside mod_div, when calculating the mod_inv of b, need to pass b mod modul as a parameter? Or is it correctly passing modul as the mod.\n\nWait, perhaps the line should be:\n\nmod_inv(x = b, modul) \u2192 no, better:\n\nmod_inv(b, modul). Because:\n\nIn the mod_inv function the second parameter is modul (the modulo value), so to find the inverse of b mod modul.\n\nThus, perhaps the code in mod_div should be:\n\nmod_inv(b, modul), NOT modulo(b, modul).\n\nWait but in the case where b is 0 mod modul, but then the inverse doesn't exist. But since the original code uses ai as the denominator, and since LCM is divisible by ai, then LCM mod mod must be divisible by ai mod mod (no, maybe not: the LCM is LCM = m * ai, so LCM mod mod_val is (ai * m mod mod_val), so (LCM) mod mod_val divided by ai mod mod_val is m mod (mod_val / gcd(ai, mod_val))).\n\nBut even when ai and mod_val are coprime (since mod_val is prime and not in input ai), then the inverse exists.\n\nThus, in code: the inverse of b (ai) is computed mod mod_val, and it's valid.\n\nHence the mod_inv should be called with (b, modul):\n\nIn mod_div:\n\nmod_inv(b, modul)\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nmod_inv(b, modul).\n\nWait but then, if b is negative? Not an issue here since we're dealing with inputs which are positive. So probably safe.\n\nThus, the code in mod_div should have:\n\n     mod_div = mod(a, modul) * mod_inv(b, modul) \n     mod_div = mod(mod_div, modul)\n\nWait, but the function returns the product modulo mod_val.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nBut in code written earlier:\n\nIn mod_div: mod_inv is called as mod_inv( modulo(b, mod_val ), modul )\n\nWait mod_val is 1e9+7, which is mod_val (parameter in main). So modulo(b, mod_val) is equivalent to mod(b, mod_val). But in mod_inv function, the second parameter is modul, which is also mod_val. So whether it needs to be passed or not.\n\nBut in code in the previous attempt, the code had:\n\nmod_inv is written as:\n\ninteger(8) function mod_inv(x, modul)\n  mod_inv = mod_pow(x, modul-2, modul)\nend function mod_inv\n\nYes, that's correct. So in the mod_div function, mod_inv is passed (b, modul) as arguments.\n\nWait the mistake in the code as written earlier: when writing mod_inv in mod_div, I mistakenly used mod_val instead of modul.\n\nAh! That's a critical error.\n\nSo in mod_div function:\n\ninstead of:\n\nmod_inv( modulo(b, mod_val), modul )\n\nit should be:\n\nmod_inv( b, modul )\n\nBecause the modular inverses are mod modul (the third parameter to mod_div).\n\nYes, so a correction is needed here for the mod_inv's parameters.\n\nThus, the line:\n\nmod_div = mod(a, modul) * mod_inv( b, modul ) \n\nmod_div = mod( mod_div, modul )\n\nThus, the mod_inv is correctly passed with modul as the second parameter.\n\nThus, in code correction, in mod_div function:\n\nAfter that fix.\n\nAnother point: in the modDiv function, in the code, the original Java's modDiv is written as:\n\nprivate static long modDiv(long a, long b, long mod) {\n        return (a % mod) * modInv(b, mod) % mod;\n    }\n\nSo the correct version: a is first mod mod, multiplied by inverse, then mod mod again. Which the code above does.\n\nNow moving on to Function modPow.\n\nOriginal Java code's modPow uses modular exponentiation.\n\nIn the code above, the mod_pow function is:\n\nFunction mod_pow(b,e,modul)\n\nThe algorithm: it's similar to the Java code's loop.\n\nThe code computes exponentiation by squaring.\n\nWait in Java:\n\n    private static long modPow(long b, long e, long mod) {\n        long ans = 1;\n        long x = b % mod;\n        for (long y = e; y != 0; y >>= 1) {\n            if ((y & 1) == 1) ans = (ans * x) % mod;\n            x = (x * x) % mod;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\nIn Fortran's mod_pow:\n\nThe code:\n\ninteger(8) function mod_pow(b,e,modul)\n   ...\n   base = mod(b, modul)\n   result = 1\n   exponent = e\n   do while ( exponent >0 )\n     if ( btest(exponent,0) ) then\n        result = mod( result * base, modul )\n     end if\n     base = mod( base * base, modul )\n     exponent = rshift(exponent,1)\n   end do\n\nSo yes, that loops over each bit of exponent starting from LSB.\n\nWait exponent is initialized as e.\n\nSo when e is 0, returns 1? but then mod_pow(x,0) should return 1 mod mod.\n\nYes, which is okay.\n\nThis should be okay.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nNow putting all together, we need to ensure all functions are correctly coded.\n\nAnother possible issue is that in computing LCM in main:\n\nThe loop does:\n\nlcm_val is initialized to 1.\n\nThen for each ai:\n\nlcm_val = lcm_val * ai / gcd(lcm_val, ai)\n\nBut in Fortran, the order matters. The GCD is of lcm_val and ai. The function gcd is inside the code's contains section.\n\nWait also, 30 again, in the loop in LCM:\n\nInitial code as written in Fortran main program:\n\nlcm_val = 1\n\ndo i =1,N\n   ai = A(i)\n   lcm_val = (lcm_val * ai) / gcd(lcm_val, ai)\nend do\n\nYes. That's handled via implicit call to the gcd function.\n\nWait but perhaps in the code above, instead of using the lcm function, the user used a loop using the formula above. Let me see:\n\nIn main, the loop is:\n\nlcm_val = 1\n\ndo i = 1,N\n\n   ai = A(i)\n   lcm_val = lcm_val * ai / gcd(lcm_val, ai)\n\nend do\n\nWait wait, alternatively the code using the lcm function would be:\n\nlcm_val = LCM(lcm_val, ai)\n\nBut in the code I wrote earlier, I see:\n\nWait in my previous code outline, in the pseudocode loop, but in the first code sketch, in the main loop, I wrote:\n\n   lcm_val = lcm_val * ai / gcd(lcm_val, ai)\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe LCM function would be:\n\nlcm(a,b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b)\n\nThus, yes.\n\nSo that loop computes the LCM correctly.\n\nAnother thing is that when multiplying lcm_val by ai, it could cause overflow beyond 64 bits. But in contest programming, assuming that this is manageable.\n\nFinally, when summing:\n\nans starts at zero. Then, for each ai:\n\nans = mod( ans + modDiv(modLCM, ai, mod_val), mod_val )\n\nWait in Fortran, mod(a + b,mod_val) is mod(a + b, mod_val), but since integers can wrap around, better to use mod function.\n\nSo the line is:\n\nans = mod(ans + mod_div(modLCM, ai, mod_val), mod_val )\n\nBut modLCM is an integer(8). mod_val is integer(8).\n\nmod_div function returns an integer(8).\n\nThus, the sum is done modulo mod_val.\n\nNow check for possible mistakes:\n\nWait in the modDiv function, the mod_div's mod(a, modul) is fine.\n\nWait overall code:\n\nNow, compile-time problems?\n\nIn Fortran, when using functions inside the loop:\n\nSince all functions are in the contains section of the program, so they are available.\n\nNow possible issues with data types:\n\nAre all variables appropriately declared integer(8)?\n\nLook:\n\nmod_val is set as parameter with value 1e9+7 (integer). Wait 1000000007 is within integer(4)'s limit (since ~2e9 is the limit, but mod_val is 1e9+7 which is okay as integer(4). However, the LCM calculation may have a product of up to 2^64, thus variables must be declared as integer(8), so mod_val must be an 8-byte integer.\n\nAh, right! So in the parameter declaration:\n\nThe initial set of mod_val is as an integer(8).\n\nWait in the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC152_E\n   implicit none\n   integer(8), parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007\n   ... \n\nThus, this is correct.\n\nThen variables like a, b, e, modul in the functions will also be 8 bytes via intent(in) parameters.\n\nNow, the mod_div function returns integer(8), which is stored as ans (integer(8)), but when we do mod(ans + ... mod_val), everything is fine.\n\nAnother thing to check:\n\nIn Fortran, the order of operations in arithmetic may have precision issues, but as long everything is kept as 8-byte integers mod will be okay.\n\nNow, possible test cases.\n\nTest case 1: N=2, A=[2,3]\n\nThe LCM is 6, mod mod_val (1e9+7, but modLCM would be 6 mod 1e9+7 \u21926.\n\nThen, for each ai, compute LCM/ai mod mod:\n\nFor 2: 6/2 =3 mod mod_val \u21923\n\nFor 3: 6/3=2 mod mod_val \u21922\n\nSum is 3+2=5 mod mod_val \u21925.\n\nThus, code should print 5.\n\nLet me see what the Fortran code would do.\n\nTesting in code:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead N=2, then the array [2,3 ].\n\nCompute LCM:\n\nInitial lcm_val=1.\n\nFirst iteration: a_i=2 \u2192 lcm_val*2 / gcd(1,2) \u21921*2 /1 \u21922.\n\nSecond iteration: a_i=3 \u2192 LCM is 2*3 / gcd(2,3)=1 \u21926. So LCM_val becomes6.\n\nmodLCM mod 1e9+7 is 6.\n\nThen for each ai:\n\nFirst ai=2 \u2192 modDiv(6,2,mod_val). mod_div returns (6 mod mod_val) * inv(2 mod mod_val) mod mod_val \u2192 6 * inverse(2) mod mod_val. inverse(2 mod mod_val) mod mod_val is (2^(1e9+7 -2)) mod mod_val. Since mod_val is prime, inverse is 500000004 (since 2*500000004 mod 1e9+7 is 1). 6 * 500000004 mod mod_val is 3.\n\nSecond ai=3: modDiv(6,3, mod_val) \u21926 /3 \u2192 mod 1e9+7 \u21922. The inverse of 3 is (3^(mod_val-2)) mod mod_val. 3^(mod_val-2) mod mod_val is a huge number but using the function, we can compute it. 6 * inverse(3) mod mod_val \u21926*(366666668) mod mod_val. 3*366666668 is 1e9+1 \u2192 mod_val is 1e9+7, so 1e9+1 mod mod_val \u2192-6 mod mod_val \u2192 thus, 3 * inverse(3) = 1 mod mod_val. So 6 * 366666668 mod mod_val \u2192 2.\n\nSum 3+2=5 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, code should work for that test case.\n\nAnother test case where ai is equal to mod_val. But in that case, mod_inv( mod_val, mod_val ) would be inv(0), which is error. But if mod_val divides ai, then the inverse is not possible, but the problem's LCM is divisible by ai, but mod_val here is the input's modulo.\n\nHmm. But if ai is mod_val (e.g. mod_val=7, and ai=7), then LCM would include 7 (assuming 7 is part of the array). Then modLcm will be LCM mod mod_val \u2192 LCM= multiple of 7, so modLcm mod 7 is 0. Then modDiv(0,7, 7) will require inverse of7 mod 7 \u2192 which is undefined. But here, the numerator is zero, so 0 /7 mod mod_val would be 0.\n\nWait in code, modDiv would compute (0 mod mod_val) * inv(7 mod mod_val, mod_val).\n\nThe denominator is 7, so modul is 7, thus 7 mod 7 is 0 \u2192 attempting to compute inv(0 mod 7, mod_val 7) would be incorrect. But in the problem's context, if ai = mod_val, the code would have a problem, because the inverse is not computable.\n\nBut given that the problem's constraints probably do not allow ai to reach mod_val (since AtCoder problems often have constraints like 1 \u2264 A_i \u2264 1e9), then mod_val (1e9+7) is bigger than A_i.\n\nSo in that scenario, the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nAnother edge case: N=1.\n\nThen LCM is the a[0], mod mod_val.\n\nThen the sum is modLCM / a mod mod.\n\nSo for A = [5], modLcm is 5 mod mod_val.\n\nso modDiv(5,5, mod_val) \u2192 (5 mod mod_val)*inv(5 mod mod_val) mod mod_val.\n\nWhich is 5 /5 \u21921 mod mod_val \u2192 1.\n\n Thus, the code will return 1, which is correct. So the code might handle that.\n\nTherefore, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, writing the code properly with corrected mod_inv in mod_div.\n\nThus, the complete Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC152_E\n    implicit none\n    integer(8), parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007\n    integer(8) :: N, lcm_val, modLCM, ans = 0\n    integer(8), allocatable :: A(:)\n    integer(8) :: i, ai\n\n    !

Also, initializing the array A as integer(8).\n\nThus, the code should be correct."
