The Java code reads two integers from the input, h and a, then calculates how many times you need to subtract a from h until it's zero or below. The loop increments num each time. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how to read input in Fortran. In Java, they used BufferedReader, but Fortran has its own way. Probably using read(*,*) to read from standard input. So the variables h and a can be read directly.\n\nWait, the code starts with h and subtracts a each loop. But the loop in Java is a for loop with h >0. The loop increments i, but actually, the num counts the number of steps. Wait, the loop in Java is written as for (int i=1; h>0; i++), so the loop runs while h is positive. Each iteration subtracts a from h and increments num. So the number of steps is essentially ceiling(h/a), but since it's integer division, maybe?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose h=5, a=2: first step h becomes 3 (num 1), then 1 (num 2), then -1 (num 3). So 3 steps. So 5/2 is 2.5, so ceiling would be 3, so that works. So maybe the code can be rewritten with integer division with ceiling. But the loop approach is straightforward, so translating that to Fortran.\n\nNow, variables: in Fortran, variables need to be declared. So I'll need integer variables h, a, num. Probably best to use integer variables.\n\nThe loop in Java is a for loop, but in Fortran, a do loop would be better. Since the loop continues until h <=0, I can use a do loop with a condition. But Fortran can have do while loops or do until. Let me see: the loop runs while h >0. So in Fortran, the do loop would have a loop counter, but here the loop is indefinite. So perhaps do-while style. Like:\n\ndo\n  ... code ...\n  if (h <=0) exit\nend do\n\nAlternatively, we can use a do loop with a condition. \n\nWait, in Fortran, a do loop without an end is possible? Not sure. Maybe better to structure it with a loop that runs indefinitely until the condition is met. \n\nLet me think of the steps. Initialize h and a. Then set num=0. Then loop: subtract a from h, increment num each time until h <=0.\n\nWait, the original loop in Java starts with i=1, but the loop condition is h>0. The loop runs as long as h is positive. Each iteration subtracts a and increments num. Because in the loop, h decreases by a each time. So even if h becomes negative after the subtraction, it's counted as a step.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nRead h and a.\n\nnum = 0\n\ndo while (h > 0)\n    h = h - a\n    num = num +1\nend do\n\nthen print num.\n\nWait, that's simpler. The Java code uses a for loop, but the do while loop in Fortran would do the same. \n\nWait, the initial code's loop's condition is checked at the start, so when h is positive. So the first iteration runs, subtract a, then check again. Which is exactly how do while works, except the condition is after the loop body. Wait no, do while in Fortran would be like the C++ do-while, where the condition is after. Wait, no, maybe in Fortran the do while is at the end? Let me check.\n\nActually, in Fortran 90 and later, you can have do while loops where you can put the condition at the beginning or end. Wait the syntax is: \n\ndo while (condition)\n   ... loop body ...\nend do\n\nWhich is equivalent to a while loop: do the condition check before the loop. \n\nAlternatively, for a do-while (post-test) in Fortran you can use:\n\ndo\n   ... loop body ...\n   if (condition) cycle\n   exit\nend do\n\nWait, but need to be careful. Alternatively, perhaps structuring the loop as:\n\ninitialise h and a.\n\nnum =0\n\n loop:\n h = h -a\n num = num +1\n if ( h >0 ) go to loop\n\nBut goto is generally not preferred. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively using a do loop that runs indefinitely until the condition is met.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The original loop in Java runs as long as h >0. Let me re-express the code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i=1; h>0; i++) {  // the i isn't used, so can ignore that\n    h -=a;\n    num++;\n}\n\nSo the loop condition is h>0. So the loop continues while h is positive. So the do while loop in Fortran that checks the condition before entering the loop body would be the same as the Java for loop's condition. Wait, no. Wait the for loop in Java is written as for( init; condition; increment ), and the body is executed if condition is true. So the check before entering the loop body, then execute body, then do the increment.\n\nBut the loop here is written as:\n\nThe init is i=1 (but unused), then condition is h>0, then execute body (h -=a, num++?), Wait, no: in the Java code's loop, the body is:\n\nh = h - a;\n\nnum++;\n\nSo each iteration subtracts a from h, then increments num. The loop's condition is checked each time before the iteration. So for example, h starts positive. Then each time, check h>0, if yes, do the iteration.\n\nWait, the loop in the Java code is a \"for\" loop where the 'increment' part is i++, but i isn't used. The loop condition is h>0, so it's equivalent to:\n\nwhile (h>0) {\n    h -= a;\n    num ++;\n}\n\nWait yes, exactly. Because the for loop's test is h>0, so while loop. But the loop's body.\n\nWait wait, the for loop in Java is:\n\nfor (init; condition; update) { statements }\n\nThe steps of the for loop are:\n\n1. init (i=1 here)\n2. evaluate condition, if true: do body, then update, then loop again.\nSo the loop body is executed only if condition is true before entering.\n\nTherefore, the Java code's loop is equivalent to:\n\nwhile (h > 0) {\n    h -=a;\n    num++;\n}\n\nBut the original code's 'i' variable is unused except for the increment which is never used again, so it's irrelevant. Thus, the loop can be written as a while loop, which is easier to translate into Fortran.\n\nSo in Fortran, that would be:\n\nread *, h, a\nnum = 0\ndo while (h > 0)\n    h = h - a\n    num = num + 1\nend do\nprint *, num\n\nWait, but wait\u2014it's important whether the decrement happens before or after checking the condition again. Let's see:\n\nTake h=1, a=1. Then first iteration: the condition is h=1>0 yes. Then h becomes 0, num is 1. Then loop ends. Which is correct (num is 1).\n\nAnother example, h=2, a=1: first loop, h=1, num 1, next iteration. Next check h>0? h is 1 yes, so do the loop again. h becomes 0, num 2. Then loop ends. Correct. That works.\n\nAnother case h=0 to start: loop is not entered, num remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes, this seems correct. So the Fortran code would be as above.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in Fortran, the variables are properly declared. So in free-form Fortran (using Fortran 90+), we can have:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: h, a, num\n  read *, h, a\n  num = 0\n  do while (h > 0)\n    h = h - a\n    num = num + 1\n  end do\n  print *, num\nend program main\n\nThis should do it.\n\nWait, maybe check another example. Let's say h=5, a=2. Then the steps are:\n\nAfter first iteration: 5-2=3, num=1\nSecond iteration: 3-2=1, num=2\nThird iteration: 1-2 =-1, num=3. Then condition check: -1>0? No. So exit. So correct.\n\nYes, so that code would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial variables should be read with a different method. Since in Java they are reading via BufferedReader, but in Fortran, reading from standard input with read*,h,a should work. The code uses integers.\n\nAnother edge case: a=0? Wait, if a is zero, then the loop will run indefinitely. But the problem might assume that a is a positive number. Since the problem likely comes from a programming contest, probably a is given as positive. So no need to handle division by zero here. So in that case, the code is okay.\n\nThus the Fortran code should be as written."
