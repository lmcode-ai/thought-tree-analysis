Then, if 0 <i (i.e. when not the first node?), he, the if (0 <i ) -> so when i is not the first node, add to the parent's list. Wait when i starts at 0, so the first node (i=0) can't trigger the first condition (0 < i) since 0 <0 is false. So in that case, the else if (0<j) is checked. Wait so in the case of i=0, and j = as.get(0), then if j >0 (so parent is not null?), then increment answer. Else (if j is 0, then root?) then nothing.",

Alternatively, the root is the node which has no parent: so in fortran nodes where node_parent = their own node_num? Not sure. Wait maybe the root is the node j where as(root) is '0'? Wait perhaps more importantly, in the Java code, the calculate function is called, which then calls dfs(0,0). Wait in the original code, the calculate() method calls dfs(0,0):\n\nLooking at the original code's calculate function:\n\nint calculate() {\n\n    if (!this.isCalculate) {\n\n        this.dfs(0, 0);\n\n        this.isCalculate = true;\n\n    }\n\n    return this.answer;\n\n} Ah, so in Java's code, the initial call is dfs starting at node '0' (the 0-based, corresponding to Fortran's first node (1)), with pre=0. In Fortran terms, since node numbers are 1-based, the first node is 1 (Java 0), so the starting node is 1 (Java 0's node) \u2192 a=1, pre =0 (but in the Fortran code, the nodes start at 1, so why pre is 0?) Wait perhaps in the original code, the pre is the parent node.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. It looks like it's a problem-solving algorithm from AtCoder, possibly dealing with some kind of tree structure based on the loops and recursion in the Calculator's dfs method.\n\nFirst, let's break down the Java code. The main class runs a thread with a MyRunnable. The MyRunnable reads input: n, k, then a list of integers. Then it creates a Calculator object and prints the result of calculate().\n\nThe Calculator class initializes lists, processes the input array into lists, and has a recursive dfs function. The answer is incremented under certain conditions related to the depth (h) reaching k-1, which suggests it's counting nodes or paths in a tree.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran 90/95 since older versions lack some needed features. Let's think about data structures. The Lists in Java are ArrayLists. In Fortran, we can use dynamic arrays or linked lists. Since Fortran doesn\u2019t support objects as Java does, especially generics, I'll need to manage this with arrays.\n\nThe main structure: The Java code uses classes and objects. For the translation, perhaps use modules, subroutines, and functions. Since the main logic is in Calculator's methods, let's map those into subroutines and functions.\n\nStarting with the MyRunnable's run method. It reads n, k, and the list as. But in Fortran, we can just have variables read in main. The thread thing might be redundant here, so perhaps Fortran's main program can handle the input directly.\n\nThe Calculator class would need to be represented with derived types or variables. Since the Calculator has member variables like lists, answer, etc., a type definition might be appropriate. The dfs function is a recursive function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, recursion is allowed but need to make sure that the functions are properly declared. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the data structures. The \"lists\" in the Calculator are a list of lists (adjacency list representation, likely). In Fortran, perhaps using an array of arrays. However, since the size of each sublist can vary, we can use a 2D array where each row corresponds to a root, and store the indices in a list. Alternatively, use a list of dynamic arrays.\n\nAlternatively, the adjacency list can be represented with an array for each node's children. Since the original Java code has 'lists' which are lists of integers for each list in lists. So perhaps in Fortran, for each node (indexed a), the list at a is an array of integers (the children). To handle dynamic size, this can be an array of pointers or using linked lists, but that's more complex. Maybe better to pre-allocate based on n. Wait, in the Java code, lists is initialized with n elements (for each i from 0 to n-1, add an empty list). Then for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nThe j value is as.get(i) - 1. Wait, wait, look at the code:\n\nOriginal code in Calculator constructor:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <n; i++) lists.add(new ArrayList<>()); So each element corresponds to a node (starting from 0 to n-1).\n\nThen for each i from 0 to n-1, j = as.get(i), but wait, original code says as.get(i) minus 1? Wait, original code says:\n\nIn MyRunnable's try block: as.add(sc.nextInt() -1); so the elements of as are the input numbers minus 1, so their indices are from 0 to n-1 perhaps. So each element as[i] is the parent of node i? Let me think. Wait, in the code:\n\nIn Calculator constructor:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1, we have j = as.get(i) -1 ?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait no. Looking at the code:\n\nIn the MyRunnable's try block, the code does \"as.add(sc.nextInt() - 1);\". So each number added to 'as' is (input value -1). Since the inputs are probably 1-based, leading to 0-based in the array.\n\nIn the Calculator's constructor, after initializing the lists (for 0 to n-1), there's a loop over i from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn this loop:\n\nj = as.get(i); Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, no, sorry. Let me look at the code again:\n\nIn Calculator's constructor:\n\n for (int i = 0; i <n; i++) { \n    this.lists.get(j).add(i);\n } Wait no, let me recheck:\n\nWait, in the for loop:\n\nWait, after initializing the lists, for each i from 0 to n-1, \n\n        int j = as.get(i); (Wait, no. The code says:\n\nWait, the code is under Calculator's constructor:\n\nWait the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n            int j = as.get(i); // Wait no, the integer in as is already (original input value -1). So j = as.get(i);\n\n            if (0 <i) {\n\n                this.lists.get(j).add(i);\n\n            } else if (0 <j) {\n\n                this.answer++;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\nWait, original code says as.add(sc.nextInt() -1). So each element in 'as' is (input -1). The input could be from 1 to n, making each element from 0 to n-1. So the code in the constructor:\n\nThis loop iterates over each node i (from 0 to n-1). For each i:\n\nj is the value of as.get(i), the original (input-1), so the original input value minus one is j, so j represents the parent of the current node i?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is building a tree where each node i has parent j. Therefore, the lists structure represents a list for each node where their children are stored. For example, if node j has a child i, then i is added to the list at j. \n\nTherefore, the lists is the adjacency list of children for each node. So for each node j, lists[j] contains the children nodes connected to it (the i's whose parent is j). \n\nSo to represent this in Fortran: Since n can be up to say, maybe 1e5? Well, in coding contests like AtCoder, constraints might be up to 2e5, but without knowing, maybe use dynamic arrays or allocating based on input.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, since we can read n first, we can allocate arrays according to that.\n\nHmm. For a list of lists, perhaps we can have a list of child nodes for each node, stored as an array. Since we can first read all the nodes, then for each j, collect the indices (i) and store them in an array for each j. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps using a 2D array but that requires knowing the maximum number of children per node. Alternatively, using dynamic arrays (allocatable arrays) grouped into an array of lists.\n\nIn Fortran 2003+, coarrays are not exactly needed here. Instead, perhaps using an array of linked-list structures. Alternatively, the easiest way would be to precompute all the children for each node. \n\nAn alternative approach:\n\n- Let's assume that for each node j (from 0 to n-1), there is a list of its children (i's where as[i] = j).\n\nThus, to build this structure:\n\nFirst, read n and k, then read the as array (element 0 to n-1, values are the parents of node i, but original input via subtract 1).\n\nThen build an array for each j, which is the list of children.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the lists can be represented as an array of dynamic arrays. To do this, maybe an array of indices.\n\nAlternatively, for each node j, we can have an array of children for j, stored in a 2D array. However, the size is variable, so maybe using an array of pointers? But that's complex.\n\nAlternatively, use two arrays: one for the starting index in a linear array, and the other as the list. This is common in graph representations. \n\nLet me think of the approach:\n\nFirst, read n, then read the as array. \n\nThen, for each node i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- The parent is j = as(i)\n\n- So, we add the child i to the list at j.\n\nTo collect the lists, we can first count the number of children per j.\n\nThen, create a linear array 'children' where all the children are stored in order, and an array 'offset' such that offset[j] is the starting index in 'children' for node j's children, and then store the counts to know the next index. \n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize an array counts of size n with zeros.\n\nLoop over all i, and increment counts[j] where j = as(i).\n\nThen allocate children array of total size = sum(counts), which is n (since each i is in exactly one list). \n\nThen allocate an array offsets, such that offsets[0] =1, and for each j, offsets(j+1) = offsets(j) + counts(j-1). Not sure, perhaps need to precompute the prefix sums.\n\nAlternatively, first, for each j, the counts are known. Create an array for each node, but perhaps better with a list representation.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, you can do that with an array for each child. Let me think.\n\nAlternative idea: \n\nLet me precompute for each node j:\n\nChildren(j,1) is the first child, etc.\n\nBut the problem is the variable size.\n\nAlternatively, for Fortran, create a structure (a derived type) that can hold the adjacency list as a variable-size array. Using the following: \n\ntype :: node_children\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type node_children\n\nThen declare an array of node_children:\n\ntype(node_children), dimension(:) :: lists\n\nThen, for each node j, we can allocate the children array for node j's list to the appropriate size, collect the children into it. But need to first pass through the data to count the number of children each node has, so that each array can be allocated to the correct size. \n\nYes, this seems manageable. Let's proceed with this plan.\n\nThus, steps for preprocessing lists in Fortran:\n\nRead n, k, and the array as of length n (each element as(i) is the parent of node i, 0-based).\n\nInitialize for each j from 0 to n-1, an empty list (we can do this via a counts array first):\n\nfirst pass over all nodes i, count for each j how many children they have. \n\ncounts array of size n. \n\nThen, for each j, the array lists(j)%children will have size counts(j).\n\nThen: second pass, go through each i from 0 to n-1, j = as(i), add i to the list of j's children.\n\nWait, but in the code, when building lists for each j's children:\n\nWait in the Java code, in the constructor for Calculator:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        int j = as.get(i);  // wait no, in the Java code, as stores 'input -1', so this j is the parent.\n\n        if (0 <i) {\n            this.lists.get(j).add(i);\n            // means node i's parent is j: so j's children include i.\n        } else if (0 <j) {\n            // handle the root case?\n            this.answer++;\n        }\n    }\n\nWait, the code in the constructor: \n\nWait the code loops over all nodes i (from 0 to n-1), and j is their parent. \n\nWait for each node i, determine whether to add it to its parent's list.\n\nThe condition:\n\nWait, the if (0 <i ) ... \n\nWait the code says if 0 <i (i has a value greater than zero?), so i not zero? Then add it to list[j].\n\nWait that code is confusing. Wait the code says:\n\nif (0 <i) { then add i to list[j].\n} else if (0 <j) { then answer++.\n\nSo this code is handling the root. Because when i is 0 (the first possible node?), and if its parent j is not zero, then that implies that the root (node 0) has a parent, which may damage the tree's structure? Maybe that's an error.\n\nWait the problem explanation might be related to a tree structure. The as array elements are the parent nodes.\n\nWait perhaps the initial conditions are such that the parent pointers form a tree? So each node (except the root) has exactly one parent, and the root's parent is itself or some indication, but the problem requires that the structure is a tree. But assuming the input forms a valid tree, except for the root which has no parent (parent is -1? Not here.\n\nWait in the code, when initializing 'as':\n\nas.add(sc.nextInt() -1); so each as[i] is (input number -1). If the input number for i=0 (the first node) was 0, then as[0] becomes -1? But that's not possible since input numbers are likely 1-based. Wait, if the input number for the first node is 1, then subtracting 1 gives 0, which would make it have parent 0? Or maybe the problem's input is such that the parents are 1-based except the root's parent is 0.\n\nHmm, but the code seems to have a check for when i is 0 (i=0 is the first node. Then, if 0 <i (i.e. when not the first node?), he, the if (0 <i ) -> so when i is not the first node, add to the parent's list.\n\nWait when i starts at 0, so the first node (i=0) can't trigger the first condition (0 < i) since 0 <0 is false. So in that case, the else if (0<j) is checked.\n\nWait so in the case of i=0, and j = as.get(0), then if j >0 (so parent is not null?), then increment answer. Else (if j is 0, then root?) then nothing.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused here. Perhaps the problem counts the number of nodes with a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the number of nodes at depth k, but I'm not sure. The main point is, in the translation to Fortran, we must replicate the logic correctly.\n\nBack to the structure. Let's think about the data layout.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the as array of integers (0-based indices).\n\nNow, create the lists data structure.\n\nFirst, create a list of children for each node.\n\nTo do this, we need an array counts where counts(j) is the number of children node j has. So initialize all counts to zero.\n\nThen loop over each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nj = as(i)\n\nif 0 <i then:\n\n  counts(j) += 1\n\nelse (i=0):\n\n  if (j >0) then: answer = answer +1 ?\n\nWait but the code's constructor has in the loop:\n\nfor each i:\n\n   j = as(i) \n\n   if (0 <i):\n\n       add i to lists[j]\n\n   else if (0 <j):\n\n       answer +=1\n\nSo the first condition is \"i is not 0 (since 0 <i), meaning, except root node, add i into its parent.\n\nFor the else case (when i is 0), check if j>0 (the current root's parent has to be non-zero?), but then that's invalid, so we increment the answer. \n\nPossibly the answer counts nodes under some conditions, perhaps leaves or roots at certain depths?\n\nAnyway, in any case for building the lists in Fortran, the counts can be computed via first pass.\n\nOnce counts are computed, we can allocate each lists(j)%children array with length counts(j). \n\nWait but counts is for children except in i=0 case?\n\nWait no, because the loop for the constructor is for all the nodes:\n\nWait the code in the Java's constructor's loop:\n\nfor (int i =0 ;i <n; i++){\n\n   j = as[i]\n\n   if (0 <i) {\n\n       add to list[j] the node i (child)\n\n   } else if ( 0 < j) {\n\n      answer++\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo for i=0 (the first node):\n\n   if (0 <i is false), so check else if (0 <j) (the j is as[0], which is the parent of node0.\n\n   If node 0's parent is non-zero (so node0 has parent), that suggests that node 0 is a non-root, which would imply that the tree has cycles? Unless the parent is part of a tree. Wait maybe in the problem, the as array is such that each node's parent is set except one root node. So this else clause checks for node0's parent: if node has a parent (j>0), then that's invalid for it to be root, so perhaps this is a marker for some condition? Maybe the problem counts certain conditions where the root's parent exists, but the code seems to count that case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is actually a tree, so exactly one node (the root) has no parent (its parent is -1?), but in code, when node0 is the root, j would be, e.g., 0? Not sure. Maybe the problem's original code was intended to count cases where node 0 has a parent, which might indicate it's not the root?\n\nThe code's answer is initialized as 0; and in the constructor, for the first node (i=0), if its parent is non-zero (j>0), then answer is ++, so that's adding one. Perhaps this is the base case for counting?\n\nAnyway, in terms of moving forward, I can proceed with the following data structures:\n\n- The as array (nodes 0 to n-1)\n\n- counts array (for children per node j)\n\n- children arrays for each node j.\n\nSo first, in Fortran code:\n\nprogram agc004_d\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, k\n\n   integer, allocatable :: as(:)\n\n   integer :: i, j, answer, iscalculate\n\n   ... and lists structure, etc.\n\nWait perhaps it's better to use modules to handle the calculator logic. Let me think of steps.\n\nAlternatively, proceed step by step.\n\nBut perhaps first, the code in Fortran would be structured as:\n\nRead n and k from stdin, then read the as array (size n).\n\nThen, construct the lists (children per node as an array).\n\nThen perform a DFS to calculate the answer using recursive function.\n\nWait, Fortran 90 can have recursive functions, but we need to be careful with parameters.\n\nThe original dfs function is this:\n\nprivate int dfs(int a, int pre) \n\nIn Java, it returns an int h which is the height?\n\nThe logic is:\n\nh starts at 0.\n\nLoop over each children of a:\n\n   h = max(h, dfs(child, a))\n\nthen, if pre !=0 (i.e. not the root?), and h == k-1:\n\n   then h is set to 0 (since it's been counted?), and answer increases.\n\nelse, h +=1\n\nWait in code:\n\nif (0 < pre) (which is same as pre !=0; because 0 <pre means pre has been initialized to non 0?)\n\nThen, when that condition is true (pre is root?), and h is exactly k-1:\n\nThen h is reset to 0 and the answer is incremented.\n\nElse, h is incremented.\n\nSo, the function returns h.\n\nWait, the function computes the depth. When the current path's depth (h) reaches k, then a root or something is counted?\n\nPossibly this dfs is calculating for each node a, the height up from a, and when a's parent's required condition is met, then the count increases.\n\nHmm.\n\nNow, to translate this into a recursive function in Fortran.\n\nLet me think of the modules:\n\nFirst, the Calculator's parameters:\n\n- The answer (integer)\n\n- isCalculate (logical)\n\n- The lists (which are the adjacency lists). \n\nPerhaps use a module to handle the Calculator's variables, or encapsulate the data in a derived type.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran doesn't have classes, perhaps pass the adjacency lists as arrays and variables as parameters to the subroutines.\n\nAlternatively, a module with the arrays and variables needed for the calculation.\n\nThis might be the way.\n\nLet me sketch a plan:\n\nDefine a several arrays:\n\n- adj: an array of child lists for each node.\n\nProbably using derived type with this.\n\nBut first:\n\nFirst, build the adjacency lists for each node.\n\nThen, the dfs function is recursive, which takes parameters a (current node), pre (parent node?), and passes state variables like answer.\n\nWait the original Calculator's answer is a member variable, so in Fortran, we can have a global variable or have it passed through function parameters.\n\nTo minimize variables, perhaps create a derived type \"Calculator_t\" which includes the k, answer, isCalculate, and the adj lists.\n\nWait:\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have objects, so perhaps pass all the necessary data through function parameters or via a global block.\n\nAlternatively, use a type to group the variables.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nUse a type for the Calculator:\n\ntype :: Calculator_t\n\n   integer :: k\n\n   integer :: answer\n\n   logical :: isCalculate = .false.\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: child_counts\n\n   integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: children  ! Not sure, but can have an array of dynamically sized arrays via user-defined types.\n\nWait this is tricky. Alternatively, in the type, have a list of children arrays. Since in Fortran we might need to handle each list as a separate array, perhaps:\n\nMake childcounts array (size n) counted for each node:\n\nBut perhaps using the following approach:\n\nDefine a type for each node's children:\n\ntype, public :: NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\nThen have the Calculator type:\n\ntype Calculator_t\n\n    integer :: k\n    integer :: answer\n    logical :: isCalculate\n    type(NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists\n\nend type Calculator_t\n\nBut in order to do this, when building the lists:\n\nWe allocate an array of NodeList for each node. For each node j, we have to precompute the number of children (count), then allocate the children array of that size for lists(j)%children, then populate it with the children nodes (i's).\n\nThis requires two passes over the as array to count and collect the children.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using NodeList type, since the counts are known per node after first pass, we can have the children stored in a 1D array with offsets. But perhaps the first approach with the type is manageable.\n\nLet me proceed with this.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nread the array as (input numbers minus 1).\n\nBuild the adjacency list for each node.\n\nThen, construct the Calculator_t object.\n\nThen compute the result via the dfs.\n\nSo, for the code structure:\n\nFirst, the code starts by getting the n and k, reads the as array.\n\nThen, build the adjacency lists via the first method (count counts per node, then preallocate, then collect with a second pass).\n\nLet's think:\n\nFirst, temp counts:\n\nallocate an integer array counts(n) = 0.\n\nloop over i from 1 to n? Wait wait, in java, the as list is 0-based, with indices from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, perhaps 1-based indices? Since array indices start at 1 unless specified otherwise via \"integer, dimension(n_start:n_end)\". So to mirror exactly 0-based, we can have Fortran arrays going from 0 to n-1, but first we need to specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to use 1-based indices in Fortran, so node indices 0..n-1 can be represented as 1-based by adding 1 to them. \n\nWait this is error-prone. Alternatively, let me use C-like 0-based indices in the program variables, but Fortran array indices must start at 1 normally, so for variables, perhaps shift them, or explicitly set the lower bound when allocating. \n\nAlternatively, proceed with 1-based for Fortran but adjust variables as needed. Let me see:\n\nSuppose as is 1-based, so as(1) is the first element, corresponding to node 0 in Java. Hmm, maybe this will be confusing. Let me see.\n\nLet me set:\n\nn is read in Fortran, then:\n\nallocate the as array as (n) integers.\n\nThen, when looping over nodes, nodes will be 1-based (indices 1..n) corresponding to Java's 0..n-1.\n\nThen the first element as(1) corresponds to Java's as[0].\n\nThen, for building adjacency lists, for each node (Fortran's i is from 1 to n):\n\nj = as(i)  ... but it's the parent as per Java.\n\nThen, seeing if (i > 1), since for the first node (i=1), we check the else if (j >0) ?\n\nWait, so in the Java code's first condition 0 <i becomes here (node in 1-based terms: (i_in_Java is 0 \u2192 i_Fortran =1, then 0 <0 \u2192 false).\n\nWait, the Java code's first condition is \"if 0 <i\" \u2192 i >0, i.e., in Fortran's i (which is 1-based node number from 1 to n), converted to node index (i in Java terms is node_num-1 in Fortran). So 0 < Java_i \u2192 node_num-1 >0 \u2192 node_num>1?\n\nWait, for Java_i = node_num -1 (since node_num=1 corresponds to 0 in Java's terms).\n\nThus, in the condition:\n\nif(0 <i):\n\nThen Java_i = i (Fortran node_num) minus 1, so if Java_i>0 \u2192 node_num>1.\n\nSo in Fortran's terms, the condition becomes: if (node_num >1).\n\nThus in the code:\n\nIn building the adjacency lists:\n\nloop over node_num from 1 to n:\n\n    j = as(node_num)\n\n    if ( node_num >1 ) then:\n\n        add this node_num to the children of node j.\n\n    else: ( node_num=1 \u2192 the first node )\n\n        if (j >0 ) then: then we increment the answer?\n\nHowever, in Fortran, the j is as(node_num). But the as array is stored as (input number -1).\n\nWait the as array was filled in as:\n\nas is read from the input, each element is sc.nextInt() -1. So in Fortran:\n\n    as(node_num) = input_read() -1 (assuming node_num from 1 to n corresponds to Java's 0 to n-1).\n\nWait yes.\n\nThus, the code proceeds as such.\n\nNow, back to the adjacency lists.\n\nSo, for each i (Fortran's node_num) from 1 to n:\n\nj = as(i)\n\nThen, if ( node_num >1 ) then:\n\n   add i to lists[j] % children\n\nElse if ( node_num ==1 ) and j >0 \u2192 then the first node (the original Java 0th node) has a parent, which implies it's not a root, so increment answer.\n\nSo building the adjacency lists for each j (0-based parent which is stored in as as 0 to n-1, but in Fortran's j here is 0-based, so when storing in children lists, for the Fortran their node numbers are 1-based (Java's indexes +1).\n\nWait, but the parent j in this scenario is stored as as(i) = (input -1). For example, if the input for the first node was 1, then as(1)=0 (since input -1 =0). So in Fortran, the j is stored as 0 to n-1 (the original as values). But the nodes actually exist from 1 to n in the Fortran's terms.\n\nTo map the j (parent's 0-based index from as(i)) to the Fortran's node_num, which is j_Fortran = j_0based +1.\n\nWait yes. Because if a node has parent's original 0-based index j (0-based), then the Fortran node_num for that parent is j+1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnode_parent_0based = as(node_num)\n\nnode_parent_fortran_num = as(node_num) +1\n\nSo, to add the current node (node_num) as a child of the parent's Fortran number node_parent_fortran_num.\n\nWait no: the node is i (node_num), and the parent's as[i] (in Java was j = as.get(i)), but here in Fortran node_num, as(i) is the 0-based parent. So the actual node number of that parent is (node_parent_0based +1).\n\nTherefore, when building the adjacency lists for the code:\n\nWe have to handle the parents correctly.\n\nThus, for each node_num in 1..n:\n\nj_0based = as(node_num)\n\nnode_parent_fortran = j_0based +1\n\nthen, if node_num >1 \u2192 add the current node_num to the children list of node_parent_fortran.\n\nElse (node_num is 1):\n\n   if (j_0based >0) \u2192 increment answer.\n\nNow, the problem is building the children lists.\n\nLet me define the type structure again:\n\ntype NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\ntype Calculator_t\n    integer :: k\n    integer :: answer\n    logical :: isCalculated\n    type(NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists\n    ! ... any other variables\n    ! Also, we can include the n parameter if needed.\nend type Calculator_t\n\nWait the Calculator_t needs to have the 'lists' as an array of NodesList. The NodesList for each node's children are stored. \n\nFirst, we need to allocate 'lists' to length n_0based +1 (since the Fortran's node_num is from 1 to n, which are the same as all the possible parents and nodes).\n\nWait the j_0based can be from 0 to n-1 (so node_parent can be up to n).\n\nWait, if a node's as(i) is n-1, then node_parent_fortran_num is (n-1)+1 = n, so nodes go from 1 to n, which is okay. So the lists array would need to have size n. Because the parents' node numbers go up to n (from 1 to n), so the lists can be of size n. \n\nWait, in the Calculator_t, we can allocate lists(1:n).\n\nThen, for each list j (Fortran node 1 ...) the NodeList children are stored.\n\nThus, to build the lists:\n\nFirst step 1: count the number of children for each node Parent_num (1-based).\n\nInitialize an integer array counts(1:n) =0.\n\nloop over node_num =1 to n:\n\n   j_0based = as(node_num)\n\n   node_parent = j_0based +1\n\n   if (node_num >1 ):\n\n       counts( node_parent ) = counts( node_parent ) +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, allocate the lists array:\n\nallocate( lists%children(1:counts(j))... per node. \n\nWait in the Calculator_t, I need to first allocate the lists array with size n.\n\nallocate(calculator%lists(1:n))\n\nThen for each parent_node in 1 ...n:\n\n   size_needed = counts(parent_node)\n\n   allocate( calculator%lists(parent_node)%children, dimension(size_needed) )\n\nthen, a second pass over each node_num:\n\nInitialize a \"current_index\" array to track the next index in each children array.\n\nallocate(current_index(1:n), source=0)\n\nloop:\n\nloop node_num =1 to n:\n\n    if ( node_num ==1 ):\n\n        if ( j_0based >0 ): \n\n            answer +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        j_0based = as(node_num)\n\n        node_parent = j_0based+1\n\n        ! Now add this node_num to the parent's children list:\n\n        current_index( node_parent ) = current_index(node_parent)+1\n        cal%lists( node_parent )%children( current_index(node_parent) ) = node_num\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nWait this way, in the second loop, each node, when it's not node1, is added to their parent's children list.\n\nThus, with this, the lists are built.\n\nOnce the structure is in place, the next step is implementing the DFS.\n\nNow the dfs function's logic:\n\nprivate int dfs(int a, int pre) {\n\n   int h =0;\n\n   for (int i : lists.get(a)) {  // loop over children of a\n\n      h = Math.max( h, dfs(i, a) );\n\n   }\n\n   if ( 0 < pre && h ==k-1 ) {\n\n      h =0\n\n      answer++;\n\n   } else {\n\n      h +=1\n\n   }\n\n   return h;\n\n}\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe need to pass the current a and pre (parent node).\n\nThe answer is a variable in the Calculator_t. The 'k' is a member as well.\n\nThe function will be recursive.\n\nThe 'isCalculated' is a flag to prevent recalculation, so in the calculate function:\n\n   if not isCalculated:\n\n      call dfs with (a= root_node, pre =0?), then mark isCalculated =true.\n\nSo first, what is the root node?\n\nWait, in the Java code, maybe the root is the node with j=0? Because if we have a tree structure, the root is the one with parent not existing.\n\nIn the code's constructor, the else clause after 0 <i:\n\n   for node_num1 (node1, the first node):\n\n   j = as(1) (which is input's first value -1). \n\n   Then, if j>0, this node has a parent, so it's not the root. \n\n   The root would be the node whose parent is ... Perhaps where their parent is not in the list ?\n\nAlternatively, the root is the node which has no parent: so in fortran nodes where node_parent = their own node_num? Not sure. \n\nWait maybe the root is the node j where as(root) is '0'? \n\nWait perhaps more importantly, in the Java code, the calculate function is called, which then calls dfs(0,0).\n\nWait in the original code, the calculate() method calls dfs(0,0):\n\nLooking at the original code's calculate function:\n\nint calculate() {\n\n    if (!this.isCalculate) {\n\n        this.dfs(0, 0);\n\n        this.isCalculate = true;\n\n    }\n\n    return this.answer;\n\n}\n\nAh, so in Java's code, the initial call is dfs starting at node '0' (the 0-based, corresponding to Fortran's first node (1)), with pre=0.\n\nIn Fortran terms, since node numbers are 1-based, the first node is 1 (Java 0), so the starting node is 1 (Java 0's node) \u2192 a=1, pre =0 (but in the Fortran code, the nodes start at 1, so why pre is 0?)\n\nWait perhaps in the original code, the pre is the parent node. For the initial call, pre is set to 0, which is outside the normal node numbers (since all nodes in 0..n-1, but 0 is a possible parent when j_0based is 0.\n\nBut in the Fortran code, pre being 0 would be possible here even though nodes start at 1.\n\nThus,the initial call is:\n\ncall dfs( a =1, pre=0)\n\nNow, in the parameters of the recursive function.\n\nNow the input to the dfs:\n\n- a is the current node (1-based)\n\n- pre is the parent node (could be 0 to indicate no parent)\n\nSo, in Fortran, the function definition would be recursive function.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, functions cannot return a variable (integer here) unless they are function definitions. \n\nWait, the original dfs returns an integer h, which is needed for the maximum.\n\nThus, the recursive function in Fortran needs to return h.\n\nThus:\n\nrecursive function f_dfs(a, pre) result(h)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: a, pre\n\ninteger :: h, current_child\n\n   h =0\n\n   do i =1, size(cal%lists(a)%children)\n\n       current_child = cal%lists(a)%children(i)\n\n       tmp = f_dfs(current_child, a)\n\n       if (tmp > h) h = tmp\n\n   end do\n\n   if (pre >0 ) then\n\n      if ( h == k-1 ) then \n\n           h=0\n\n           cal%answer = cal%answer +1\n\n      else\n\n           h = h+1\n\n      end if\n\n   else\n\n      h = h+1\n\n   end if\n\nend function \n\nWait but how to refer to the parameters (cal's k, and the data). Since in functions, you can't have variables in other structures unless passed in arguments or accessible via modules.\n\nThus the recursion is dependent on the Calculator_t data structure. Thus perhaps pass the Calculator as a parameter to the function.\n\nBut recursive functions can't have modifiable variables as arguments. This adds complexity.\n\nAlternatively, all variables are global. But better to encapsulate.\n\nThis is getting complicated; perhaps proceed with a module approach.\n\nMaybe define all variables as part of the Calculator_t, and pass it as an argument to the recursive functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, define the derived types:\n\nmodule tree_utils\n\ntype :: NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\ntype :: Calculator_t\n    integer :: k\n    integer :: answer\n    logical :: isCalculated\n    type(NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists\n    integer :: n_nodes\nend type Calculator_t\n\ncontains \n\nrecursive function dfs(a, pre, cal) result(h)\n integer, intent(in) :: a, pre\n type(Calculator_t), target :: cal  !! Or pass by reference\n integer :: h\n integer :: i, current_child\n integer :: max_h =0\n integer :: child_list_size\n\n child_list_size = size( cal%lists(a)%children )\n\n if ( child_list_size >0 ) then\n     do i=1, child_list_size\n         current_child = cal%lists(a)%children(i)\n         h_temp = dfs(current_child, a, cal)\n         if ( h_temp > max_h ) max_h = h_temp\n     end do\n end if\n\n h = max_h\n\n if ( pre >0 ) then\n     if ( h == cal%k-1 ) then\n         h=0\n         cal%answer = cal%answer +1\n     else \n         h = h+1 \n     end if\n else\n     h = h+1\n end if\n\n return h\n\nend function dfs\n\nsubroutine calculate( cal )\n   type(Calculator_t) :: cal\n\n   if (.not. cal%isCalculated) then\n       call dfs( a=1, pre=0, cal )\n       cal%isCalculated = .true.\n   end if\nend subroutine\n\nend module tree_utils\n\nWait but functions in Fortran can't modify variables except if they are intent(out) or in a module. Since pass-by-reference is possible here. But in this function, when cal is passed as an argument, even though the function is recursive, it can modify cal%answer and other variables?\n\nWait in Fortran function with the types passed as arguments, whether they are passed by reference or by intent. Since cal is a derived type with allocatable variables, perhaps it needs to be passed as a pointer?\n\nAlternatively, using a wrapper with pointer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Calculator_t should have the n_nodes field to store the total nodes, as needed.\n\nBut to handle the recursive function properly, perhaps making 'cal' a pointer.\n\nHmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, make the Calculator_t a module variable:\n\nmodule calculator_mod\n\ntype :: NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\ntype :: Calculator_t\n   integer :: k\n   integer :: answer\n   logical :: isCalculated\n   integer :: n_nodes\n   type (NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists\nend type Calculator_t\n\ntype(Calculator_t), target :: calculator\n\ncontains\n\nrecursive function dfs(a, pre) result(h)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, pre\n    integer :: h, i, current_child, max_h, child_count\n    type (NodeList), pointer :: node_list_ptr\n\n    node_list_ptr => calculator%lists(a)\n\n    child_count = size(node_list_ptr%children)\n\n    max_h =0\n    if ( child_count >0 ) then\n        do i =1, child_count\n            current_child = node_list_ptr%children(i)\n            h_temp = dfs( current_child, a )\n            if ( h_temp > max_h ) max_h = h_temp\n        end do\n    end if\n\n    h = max_h\n\n    if (pre >0 ) then\n        if ( max_h == calculator%k -1 ) then\n            h =0\n            calculator%answer = calculator%answer +1\n        else\n            h = h +1\n        end if\n    else\n        h = h+1\n    end if\n\nend function dfs\n\nend module calculator_mod\n\nThen, in the main program:\n\nprogram agc004_d\n\nuse calculator_mod\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k\ninteger, allocatable :: as(:)\ninteger :: i, node_parent, j_0based\n\n!

The calculate subroutine (if I have one) would need to call dfs.\n\n Wait in the earlier module plan, I wrote:\n\n contains \n\n subroutine calculate( ... ) \n\n But in the current approach, the 'calculator' is a modifiable module variable. So the main program needs to call the dfs function directly once.\n\n Wait the original java code's calculate() function does:\n\n if not isCalculated:\n\n   dfs starts, and sets isCalculated = true.\n\n So in the program:\n\n if ( .not. calculator%isCalculated ) then \n\n    call dfs(1, 0)\n\n    calculator%isCalculated = .true.\n\n end if\n\n So in the program:\n\n ...\n\n print*, calculator%answer\n\nend program.\n\n \n\nWait, but in my module setup above, the DNS function was inside the module and could be called via calculator_mod.\n\nWait in code:\n\nmodule calculator_mod:\n\nThe dfs function returns an integer h.\n\nThus, the main program:\n\n actually, calling dfs with a=1 and pre=0 will start the recursive process.\n\nBut the initial call to dfs is just for side effects (modifying the calculator's answer and isCalculated is irrelevant?).\n\nWait the calculation needs to trigger the dfs once, and it's the byproduct of that function's calls which modify the answer variable.\n\n So in the main program after building the calculator:\n\n if ( calculator%isCalculated ) then ! initially it's .false.\n\n but to be safe, just call it regardless, then isCalculated flag can be set.\n\n Thus:\n\n call dfs( 1, 0 )\n\n But how to capture the functionality of checking isCalculated?\n\n Ah, perhaps the isCalculated is redundant here, since in the problem statement, the code is only calculated once. Or is the calculate method intended to be used multiple times? Probably irrelevant here.\n\n Thus, in program:\n\n after setup, the calculator is initialized, then:\n\n call dfs(1,0) \n\n which does the processing and mutates the calculator%ans.\n\nBut wait, the dfs function has the isCalculated flag, but in code, the call to dfs should trigger the process.\n\nLooking into the DFS function:\n\nWait in the current draft's dfs function in the module, the 'answer' is being modified via the module's calculator%ans.\n\nThus, the recursive calls do their work, and once done, the calculator%ans has the correct value.\n\nThus, in the main program flow:\n\nprogram agc004_d\n\n  use calculator_mod\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer::n,k\n\n  integer::i\n\n  integer, allocatable::as(:)\n\n  ... Reading n and as, building the calculator.\n\n  call dfs(1,0)\n\n  print*, calculator%answer\n\nend program \n\nWait but we have to ensure the calculator structure has been properly initialized.\n\nMoreover, when the dfs is called, the initial call might also need to be wrapped with a call that checks is calculated?\n\nLooking back to the original Java code:\n\nThe initial calculate function computes only once because of is calculated flag, but in the Fortran code, perhaps the isCalculated can be skipped, assuming that the first run is sufficient.\n\nThus, the main program after building the calculator can just call dfs(1,0).\n\nSo putting it all together: the main program must:\n\n- declare the as array.\n\n- read the input: n and k,\n\n- read as array (adjusted to be 0-based input minus 1 \u2192 as becomes the 0-based indices).\n\nThen, count the children for each node.\n\nThen, build the calculator structure's lists.\n\nFill the children lists accordingly.\n\nCall the dfs(1, 0) subrouitne.\n\nThen output the calculator's answer.\n\nBut let's see potential pitfalls:\n\n1. Initial answer is initialized incorrectly. In the original code, the Calculator's answer starts at 0, then in the constructor, during the loop over nodes:\n\nFor the first node (i==1?), the condition:\n\nif (0 <i (in Java i is 0 for first node ? No).\n\n Wait in Java's code for the first node (i=0):\n\nj = as.get(0)\n\nif (i ==0 \u2192 0 <i is false) \u2192 thus else if (0 <j \u2192j>0: then answer +=1.\n\nThus in the Fortran code's initial loop when setting up the calculator's answer:\n\n for i_node =1 to n (Fortran node_num):\n\n    if i_node ==1 (first node):\n\n        j_0based = as(1)\n\n        ! check if j_0based >0:\n\n        if (j_0based >0) then \n\n            calculator%answer = calculator%answer +1 \n\nso initial answer is set correctly according to that.\n\nInitially, the answer should be initialized to zero. \n\nIn the module's calculator variable, perhaps on declaration:\n\ntype(Calculator_t), target :: calculator = Calculator_t( k=0,answer=0, isCalculated = .false. , ... ) ?\n\nBut in Fortran, initialization of derived types can be done with a constructor.\n\nBut perhaps need to explicitly set the answer to zero in the program before anything else.\n\nFor example:\n\nin the main:\n\ncall calculator% answer =0\n\nBut in the code:\n\nthe calculator module variable's fields can be initialized when built.\n\nWait the code steps in the program after module:\n\n  ... Reads input.\n\n  allocate( as...)\n\n  initialize_radius:\n\n     cal answer to zero.\n\n  ...\n\nBut in the module variable, perhaps it starts at zero.\n\nBut to be safe, after allocation, in the main program, set:\n\ncalculator% answer =0 \n\n calculator%kg= k \n\n etc.\n\nThus, perhaps better to have an initialization routine in the module.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Now, moving on to code.\n\nNow, some code:\n\nFirst, the module:\n\nmodule calculator_mod\n\ntype :: NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\ntype :: Calculator_t\n    integer :: k\n    integer :: answer\n    logical :: isCalculated\n    integer :: n_nodes ! total nodes\n    type(NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists \nend type Calculator_t\n\ntype(Calculator_t), save, target :: calculator\n\ncontains\n\nrecursive function compute_height(a, pre) result(h)\n !! calculates the height during DFS and modifies the answer if conditions are met.\n integer, intent(in) :: a, pre\n integer :: h, h_child, i_child, child_count\n type (NodeList) :: node_list \n\n node_list => calculator%lists(a)\n\n child_count = size( node_list%children )\n\n h =0 \n\n do i_child =1, child_count\n     h_child = compute_height( node_list%children(i_child), a )\n     if ( h_child > h ) h = h_child\n end do \n\n if (pre >0 ) then \n    if ( h == (calculator%k -1) ) then \n        h =0 \n        calculator%answer = calculator%answer +1\n    else \n        h = h +1 \n    end if\n else \n     h = h+1\n end if\n\n return h\n\nend function compute_height\n\nend module calculator_mod\n\nThen in the main program:\n\nprogram agc004_d \n\nuse calculator_mod\n\nimplicit none \n\ninteger :: n, k\ninteger, allocatable :: as(:)\ninteger :: i, node_parent_0based, pn\n\nread(*,*)n, k \n\nallocate( as(n) )\n\ndo i =1, n \n    read(*,*) as(i)\n    as(i) = as(i) -1  ! stored as node's parent in 0-based\nend do \n\n!

But in this call, the only effect are the side effects on the calculator%ans, which is the desired outcome.\n\nThus, the call can be done just to trigger the side-effect.\n\nThus the line:\n\n call compute_height(1,0)\n\nBut in Fortran, you have to have the value computed, but not used. So perhaps:\n\n integer :: dummy \n\n dummy = compute_height(1,0)\n\nThis would trigger the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the function's side effects are sufficient, and ignore the result.\n\nThus, changing the sub after setup:\n\ncall compute_height(1,0) \n\nBut the function returns an integer, so the call must occur in a context that expects it.\n\nTo work around this, do:\n\n dummy = compute_height(1,0)\n\nend program\n\nSo with that, the program would process.\n\nBut let me also check the initial answer:\n\nIn the initial setup of calculator%answer =0.\n\nThe first node (i_node=1):\n\nnode_parent_0based = as(1). \n\nIf that is larger than 0 \u2192 then the root node has a parent (as(1) is not 0-based 0 \u2192 meaning it would increment the answer.\n\nThis is correct per Java code's code in the constructor.\n\nTesting this code with sample inputs is needed.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nVariable declarations:\n\nIn the counts, in the main program:\n\ncounts is declared as counts(0:n), but the nodes are from 1 to n. The initial code in the main has counts initialized as counts(:)=0.\n\nWait in counts(0) is of size 0? No, declared as (0 to n). Thus, 0 is a valid index, but when the code loops for a_node =1, etc.\n\n, the code should be okay as the first and last element is not used.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use 1:n.\n\nChanging in main's counts declaration:\n\ninteger, dimension(1:n) counts \n\nBut the loop over i_node =1 to n:\n\n node_parent_0based is as(i_node).\n\n pn = node_parent_0based +1 \u2192 which could be up to n (since as can be n-1, so +1 is n.\n\nThus the array counts(1:n) can indeed.\n\nSo changing counts declaration to:\n\ninteger(1:n), allocatable::counts.\n\nWait better to use allocated arrays:\n\nallocate( counts( 1: n ), source=0 )\n\ninstead of static array.\n\nTo avoid possible issues:\n\nIn main program:\n\n...\n\ninteger, allocatable :: counts(:) \n\nallocate( counts(1:n) )\n\ncounts =0 \n\n...\n\nThen in compute the counts.\n\nThus correcting that in code.\n\nAnother possible issue: the current_idx array:\n\nin main:\n\ninteger current_idx(n)\n\nallocatable? No, declared as automatic array in main program.\n\nBut in stack, for big n it could exceed: well, in coding contests, n can be up to e.g., 2e5 or more, but in any case, the code must use allocated arrays in that case.\n\nSo declare current_idx as an allocated array:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: current_indices(:)\n\nallocate( current_indices(1:n) )\n\n current_indices =0 \n\nThen loop:\n\ndo i_node =1, n \n\n...\n\n    pn_node = node_parent_0based +1 \n\n    current_indices(pn_node) = current_indices(pn_node)+1\n\n    ! etc.\n\nend do \n\nThis would avoid static array size limit issues.\n\nPutting all together with these corrections:\n\nmodule calculator_mod\n\ntype :: NodeList\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: children\nend type NodeList\n\ntype :: Calculator_t\n    integer :: k\n    integer :: answer\n    logical :: isCalculated\n    integer :: n_nodes\n    type(NodeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: lists \nend type Calculator_t\n\ntype(Calculator_t), save, target :: calculator\n\ncontains\n\nrecursive integer function compute_height(a, pre)\n implicit none\n integer, intent(in) :: a, pre\n integer :: i_child, child_count, h, h_child\n type (NodeList), pointer :: current_list\n\n current_list => calculator%lists(a)\n child_count = size(current_list%children)\n\n h =0\n\n do i_child=1, child_count\n   h_child = compute_height(current_list%children( i_child ), a )\n   if ( h_child > h ) h = h_child\n end do \n\n ! decide based on pre\n\n if (pre >0 ) then \n   if (h == calculator%k -1) then \n      h =0\n      calculator%answer = calculator%answer +1\n   else \n      h = h +1\n   end if\n else \n   h = h +1\n end if\n\n compute_height = h \n\nend function compute_height\n\nend module calculator_mod\n\nprogram agc004_D\n\nuse calculator_mod\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, k, i, node_parent_0based, pn_node, cnt\ninteger, allocatable :: as(:), counts(:), current_idx(:)\ntype (NodeList), pointer :: node_list_ptr\n\nread(*,*) n, k\n\nallocate( as(n) )\nallocate( counts(1:n), current_idx(1:n) ) \n\n!
