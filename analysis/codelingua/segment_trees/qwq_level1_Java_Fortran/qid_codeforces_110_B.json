    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program takes an integer input n from the user, then creates a character array of size n. It's doing some kind of pattern with the characters using a nested loop. The outer loop runs from i=0 to 3, because the condition is i <4. The inner loop starts at j=i and increments by 4 each time. For each of those indices j in the array, it assigns the character value corresponding to the current p, which starts at 97 (which is 'a'). Then p increments by 1 each time the outer loop iterates.\n\nSo the main idea here is to fill the array such that each 'block' of 4 elements starting at positions 0, 1, 2, 3 (mod 4) gets a starting letter and cycles through. For example, if n was 12, the first block (indices 0,4,8) would be 'a', then next (1,5,9) 'b', etc., wrapping around correctly.\n\nNow translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's think about the variables. In Java, variables are declared at the top. In Fortran, variables can be declared anywhere but typically at the start. The main program structure: Since it's a simple program, I can make it a Fortran program with a main program without needing modules.\n\nThe input part: In Fortran, to read from stdin, you can use read(*,*) variable. So n is an integer. The array 'c' in Java is a char array. In Fortran, characters are a bit different, since each is a string. Wait, but maybe using a character array of length 1 each would be better. The character array in Fortran can be declared as character(:), dimension(:) or just character*1 since each element is a single character. Alternatively, a character*1 array.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes an array of chars. In Fortran, characters have length, but if you have a character*1 array, each element is a single character. So maybe declaring c as a character array of length 1 and size n. \n\nVariables: The Java code has int n, i, j, p. In Fortran, variables need declaration. Let's think about loops. The loops in Java are for (i=0; i <4; i++) and inner for(j = i; j <n; j +=4). \n\nFortran uses OPENMP or DO loops. The loops will need to be converted accordingly. \n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nAt the beginning:\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, p \n\nBut in Fortran, declarations are best placed at the start of the program. \n\nMain steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then, set p=97, which is the ASCII for 'a'. In Fortran, characters can be represented by their ASCII codes. Char values can be stored as integers (ASCII values) and then converted to characters when needed, or maybe handled via the ichar and char functions.\n\nWait, in Fortran, to convert from ASCII code to character, we can use the char function. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97. So in the loops, we can set the array elements as characters corresponding to p. \n\nWait in Java, they do (char)p, so in Fortran, we can do char(p) (assuming that function exists). The CHAR intrinsic function in Fortran converts an integer to character; CHAR(97) would give 'a'. \n\nSo the array 'c' in Fortran can be a character array of len 1, and each element is assigned as CHAR(p). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, then initialize the array.\n\nThe array declaration in Fortran: Let's see. In the Java code, the array is length n. So in Fortran, we can have a character array of length n, each element being a character of length 1. So declared as something like character(1) :: c(n). \n\nHowever, in older Fortran versions, you needed to specify the length before initializing, but in modern Fortran (90+), you can use allocatable arrays. Wait, but since n is read from input, maybe we have to use an allocatable array. So perhaps:\n\ncharacter(1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c\n\nBut in the main program, the allocation prograams would read n first, then allocate c(n). \n\nBut let's structure the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program starts by reading n.\n\nSo, code steps in Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_110_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, p\ncharacter(1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c \n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate( c(n) )\n\np = 97\n\n! the loops:\n\ndo i=0,3  ! since outer loop i from 0 to 3 (4 times). Wait, in Java it's for (i=0; i<4; i++) so i runs 0,1,2,3? Wait when i=3, then the loop will run when condition i<4 holds. So in Fortran, the loop would be do i = 0,3\n\nWait, in Fortran, the loop structure is do i = start, end, step. So do i =0,3 would run for 0,1,2,3. \n\nThen inside, the inner loop.\n\nThe inner loop is for (j =i ; j < n ; j +=4 )\n\nIn Fortran, that would be do j = i, n-1, 4 \n\nWait, because in Java the loop condition is j <n, so in Fortran terms, the upper limit is n-1, since in the loop, j starts at i, and increments by 4 each time, as long as less than n. \n\nWait, in Java, the loop counts j up from i to less than n, stepping by 4 each time. \n\nSo in Fortran, to have j starting at i, and step 4 until <n. So the limit would be at the last step where j is less than n. In Fortran's do loops, the end is inclusive, so the loop will run for j-values starting at I to (n-1) step4 ?\n\nWait, perhaps in the inner loop, the upper limit is n-1, but since the step is 4, maybe better to write j from i to n-1 with a step of 4. \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use loops:\n\ndo j = i, n-1, 4\n\nthen, set c(j+1) = char(p)\n\nWait, but indexing in Fortran is 1-based by default. Wait, this is crucial! Oh right! Java uses 0-based arrays, so the original code's loops start at j =i (0 in the first iteration). But in Fortran arrays default to 1-based. So this will require some adjustment.\n\nAh yes, that's a key point. The array in Java is 0-based; in Fortran, arrays are 1-based unless declared otherwise. \n\nSo in the Fortran code, the array c is of size n, with indices 1..n. \n\nTherefore, when translating the loops, need to adjust the indices to account for 1-based numbering. Let's see:\n\nOriginal Java code's loops:\n\nfor (i =0; i<4; i++)\n   for (j =i; j <n; j +=4 )\n      c[j] = (char)p; \n   p++;\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWe need to loop over i from 0 to 3 (but arrays are 1-based, so but the indices in the loop need to be 1-based?\n\nWait, the first loop variable i in Java starts at 0, which was used for starting the j. Since the Fortran array starts at 1, the j= i will have to be adjusted. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst loop in Fortran: outer i. Since the original loop had i from 0 to 3 (4 values), but in Fortran, to get the same sequence of 0,1,2,3, we can do:\n\ninteger i in 0 to 3. \n\nWait, that's okay in Fortran: declare i as integer, loop from 0 to3 inclusive. \n\nThe inner loop: in Java, j starts at i (which can be 0,1,2,3), then steps by 4 until j < n. \n\nIn Fortran, j in the array needs to be 1-based. So to map the Java j into the Fortran's index (starting at 1), perhaps the array index is (Java index +1) since in Java it starts at 0?\n\nWait no: Let's think:\n\nJava's c[j] where j starts at 0 in first loop. So element c[0] is accessed first.\n\nIn Fortran, the first element is at 1. \n\nTherefore, the Java's j corresponds to Fortran's j+1. \n\nWait, yes: To get the same position as Java's array, for example Java's c[0], in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, that would have to be stored as the first element (index 1). \n\nWait, this is a problem. Because the loops in Java start at j=0 (for the first iteration of i=0), but in Fortran's array the first element is 1. \n\nHmm, so this would cause an error, because when initializing 'j' in the inner loop starting at Java's j=i (could be 0), the Fortran array c has indexes starting at 1. Therefore, we need to adjust all the indices.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps in Fortran, we can declare the array to be 0-based. In modern Fortran, arrays can be declared with any lower bound.\n\nWait, in Fortran90+, we can do that. For example:\n\ncharacter(1), dimension(0:n-1) :: c \n\nThis way, the array has indices from 0 to n-1, like in Java.\n\nSo the first step: \n\nread(n), allocate as 0-based?\n\nWait, but to allocate as 0-based:\n\nBut in Fortran, allocatable arrays can have their bounds set when allocated.\n\nWait, allocation can have the deferred shape but then you can assign the lower and upper indexes.\n\nWait, for allocatable arrays, you can allocate with bounds:\n\nallocate( c(0:n-1) )\n\nYes. So if I do that, then the array indexes match the Java code, which uses 0-based.\n\nTherefore, better approach is to declare the array as 0-based (indexes 0 to n-1), so loops can remain as per Java.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c \n\nallocate( c(0:n-1) )\n\nThen the loops can proceed similarly:\n\ndo i=0, 3  ! from 0 to 3, inclusive\n\n   do j = i, n-1, 4  ! since the upper limit for j is n-1 (because array is 0-based, max is n-1)\n\n      c(j) = char(p)  ! char(p) converts the integer p (ASCII code) to character\n\n   end do\n   p = p +1  ! after completing the inner loop for this i, increase p.\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the p variable is initialized at 97 (start). Then for each iteration of the outer loop (i=0 to 3), the inner loop is filled with current p, then p increments by 1. \n\nWait looking back at Java code's logic: \n\np is initialized to 97, and before the inner loop (for j), they set each element in the current iteration, then p increases after the inner loop. \n\nYes, so in Fortran, after the inner do loop, p increments.\n\nNow, the outer loop variables:\n\nThe i in Java starts at 0 up to 3 (i increments from 0 to 3). The loops in Fortran can do the same with a DO loop.\n\nAlso, the initial p=97.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nNow, the print part:\n\nIn Java, the code loops over each element and prints it without spaces, so System.out.print(c[i]).\n\nIn Fortran, one can do something like write(*,*) trim( adjustr( c ) ), but that might not work. Alternatively, write(*,'(a)') (c(j), j=0, n-1 )\n\nWait, let me think: To write all the elements in order, each as character, without spaces, Fortran can use a loop, but better use an implied do loop in the write statement.\n\nThe correct way is:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no' ) c(j)\n\nBut alternative approach for all elements:\n\nAlternatively, if the c array is of length n (0-based), then the elements are from 0 to n-1. The Fortran code can do:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000a1)') c\n\nWait, no. But the array can be considered as a character string. Alternatively, to write all elements:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') ( c(j), j = 0, n-1 )\n\nWait, but Fortran's write statements have formatting that might add spaces, unless specified correctly. So perhaps:\n\nThe syntax would be write(*, \"(a)\") c, but only if the array can be interpreted as a string. \n\nAlternatively, since each element is a character of length 1, the entire array from j=0 to n-1 can be written as a sequence. \n\nAlternatively, using a loop:\n\ndo j = 0, n-1\n\n   write(*, '(a1)', advance='no') trim( c(j) )\n\nend do\n\nBut the trim might not be needed here if the character is 1-length. Hmm, perhaps better to use an implied do loop with a format that writes all characters.\n\nAlternatively, the best way is to use the implied do loop in the write statement with a format that handles each character.\n\nThe code can use:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000a1)') ( c(j), j =0, n-1 )\n\nBut the 1000 is a place holder to account for n elements (if n is large, but we can leave as sufficient number, or just let the format take care of it, perhaps as:\n\nwrite(*, '(a)') [ c(j), j=0, n-1 ]\n\nBut I need to check the correct syntax. \n\nWait, in Fortran, to construct a character string from an array of single-character strings, perhaps the reshape approach is needed. Alternatively, since each element is a single character, the entire array can be addressed as a single string if the array has the correct storage.\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran, when you have a 1D array of characters of length 1, the whole array can be treated as a single string of length n by specifying it's \"contiguous\" in memory. But perhaps a better way is to do:\n\nwrite( *, \"(a)\", advance=\"no\") ( c(j), j=0, n-1 )\n\nWait, the \"(a)\" format specifier will treat the subsequent list as a string? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, using an explicit format to write each character.\n\nAlternatively, use a loop:\n\ndo j=0, n-1\n\n   write( *, '(a1)', advance='no' ) c(j)\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*),\"\"\n\nBut this loop would print each character without newlines, as required.\n\nAlternatively, the format 1000a1 may be seen as a format, but in this case, the number of a1 elements should exactly be n. That may be tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a character variable to build the string. For example, making a character(n) string s, then:\n\ndo j=0, n-1\n\n   s(j+1:j+1) = c(j)\n\nend do\n\nbut might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Implied do loop in write with * in the format. Wait, the format * can handle variable column lengths. Like:\n\nwrite(*,*) ( c(j), j=0, n-1 )\n\nBut this will output them each as a separate field with spaces. So that's not desired.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best way is the loop:\n\ndo j =0, n-1\n\n   write(*, '(a)', advance='no') c(j)\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*) \"\"  ! To add a newline at end?\n\nWait, because in Java, after printing all, there is no new line. But the problem didn't specify that, but maybe to match exactly, we can leave out the newline. Of course the problem says \"print the result\", so probably output all the characters, no spaces, no newlines.\n\nSo in Fortran, to omit the trailing new line, or handle it.\n\nAlternatively, write(*, '(a)') trim( adjustr( c ) )\n\nNo, not sure.\n\nWait another approach: the entire array can be considered as a character array of length n, so using a character string variable:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: str = ''\n\ndo j =0, n-1\n\n   str(j+1:j+1)=c(j)\n\nenddo\n\nThen write(*,'(a)') str\n\nThis way, you build the string into a character(n) variable. \n\nBut initializing the array and then setting each position.\n\nThis might work. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is already contiguous characters, perhaps can be interpreted as a string. For example,\n\nwrite( *, '(a)') c\n\nBut the problem is that c is a rank 1 array. To reinterpret it as a scalar contiguous string, you can type pun? Not sure, but Fortran needs characters of exact length.\n\nAlternatively, try:\n\nUsing the '//' operator to concatenate. But that's tedious.\n\nAlternatively, the following approach.\n\nAnother idea: in Fortran, the character array can be written as a string by looping through each index. The above method is perhaps the simplest.\n\nLet me try this:\n\ncharacter(1) :: temp\n\ndo j =0, n-1\n\n   temp = c(j)\n\n   write(*,'(a1)', advance='no') temp\n\nenddo\n\nBut may not be necessary. Alternatively, the following write statement:\n\nwrite(*, '(1000a1)') ( c(j), j=0,n-1 )\n\nHere 1000 is just a large number. Since the first number says how many instances. The a1 is the format for each character. The total needed is n, so if it is bigger than n, the extra characters are ignored? or maybe I should use '*' but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, to write exactly the needed number. The value n can be used to format.\n\nWait, the write statement can have a format with an edit descriptor that can be calculated.\n\nSo:\n\nwrite(*, '(100(a1))') (c(j), j=0,n-1)\n\nBut 100 may be arbitrary. Wait, better to use:\n\nwrite(*, \"(a1)\") (c(j), j=0,n-1)\n\nBut then each character is written with a new line? Or each in column 1.\n\nAlternatively, to write all in the same line, without spaces, the correct way is to set the format so all are written with no space.\n\nThe syntax:\n\nwrite(*,999) (c(j), j=0,n-1)\n\n999 format(1000a1)\n\nBut if n exceeds 1000, it might be a problem. But the problem may assume n is not that big, or we can just choose a bigger number. Alternatively, use * in the format? Wait, the Fortran standard allows us to use a single a with a length? \n\nAlternatively, using list-directed to write, but that might space them:\n\nwrite(*,*) c(0:n-1)\n\nBut when you write a character array with list-directed, each element might be separated by spaces, so that would not be desired.\n\nHmm, this is a bit of a snag. Maybe the loop is safer.\n\nProceeding with a loop:\n\ndo j =0, n-1\n\n   write(*, '(a1)', advance='no') c(j)\n\nend do\n\nAnd to get down a new line, but in Java's code, the output is done with system.out.print, which doesn't add a newline. However, the Fortran standard might output the print without a new line, but in some cases, maybe necessary, but per the problem's required output, perhaps the newline is fine. Wait, but the problem didn't specify that the output requires no newline. The original code probably ends without a newline. So to make it exact, use advance='no', then perhaps after looping, do a new line to be safe? Not sure. Alternatively, take the risk, but given it's code submission, perhaps the loop with advance=no is better.\n\nAlternatively, the Fortran code can do the loop, using advance='no', and then write a new line, but that would end with a new line character, which the original code does not print. However, in many coding platforms, trailing newlines are allowed. So to avoid having an extra space, perhaps better to omit the final new line.\n\nAlternatively, the loop.\n\nPutting all together, the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_110_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, i, j, p\n\ncharacter(1), dimension(:), allocatable :: c\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate( c(0:n-1) )\n\np=97\n\ndo i=0,3\n\n   do j=i, n-1,4\n\n       c(j) = char(p)\n\n   end do\n\n   p = p +1\n\nend do\n\ndo j=0, n-1\n\n    write(*,'(a1)', advance='no') c(j)\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(c)\n\nend program\n\nHmm, but check variables:\n\nWait, the outer loop i is from 0 to 3 (since in Fortran, do i=0,3, which gives i values 0,1,2,3). \n\nThe j runs from j =i, then steps of4 until <n? Wait in Java, the j starts at i and increments by 4 until j <n. Let's think.\n\nIn Fortran, the j loop is from i up to n-1, stepping 4 each time. That's correct, since for the 0-based array with max index n-1. Therefore, j will go from i to n-1 in steps of4. \n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nCheck initial p is 97. So first loop i=0:\n\nthe j runs as 0,4,8,... etc.\n\nThen i=1: 1,5,9 etc.\n\nYes, this should generate the same pattern as the Java code.\n\nThe write loop goes from 0 to n-1, writing each character.\n\nTesting with n=5, in Java would produce a, b, c, d, a?\n\nWait let me see the original code with n=5.\n\nJava:\n\nn=5, loops:\n\nFor i=0:\n\nj=0 (assign to 'a' (p=97). Then j +4: 4 <5 (4).\n\nSo indexes 0 and4 are set to 'a', then p becomes 98.\n\nThen i=1: j starts at1. 1,5 (but 5>=5 (since <n) so stops at 1. So index1 set to 'b'.\n\nThen p becomes99.\n\ni=2: j starts at2, then next 6>5. So only index2 set to 'c', p becomes100.\n\ni=3: j starts at3: 3<5. So index3 is 'd', p becomes101.\n\nThen the array is indexes 0:a, 1: b, 2:c,3:d,4:a \u2192 so the string is 'a b c d a '? Wait no, wait when you print the array as per the code. The loop after p increments.\n\nWait after i=0, j runs 0,4 \u2192so c[0] and c[4] are 'a', then p becomes 98.\n\nThen i=1:\n\nLoop j from1 to4 steps of4: next is 1+4=5, which is >=5 \u2192 stops at j=1. So c[1] is 'b' (p=98). \n\ni=2: j starts at2 \u2192 c[2] =99 ('c'), Next j=6 exceeds, so no more.\n\ni=3: j starts at3, so c[3]=d. Then p becomes 100.\n\nSo array elements [0:a, 4:a? So the full array for n=5 would be: indices0:a,1:b, 2:c,3:d, 4:a \u2192 so the output is a b c d a (without spaces), so \"abcda\".\n\nIn the Fortran code, the same steps would work, so the code should be correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAlso, note that in the Fortran code, after the allocatable array is used, it's a good practice to deallocate, so the 'deallocate(c)' is included.\n\nAnother possible issue: the char function in Fortran expects an integer, so char(p) is correct here. Since p is an integer initialized to 97 and increased, so correct.\n\nTherefore the Fortran code I suggested should be the correct translation."
