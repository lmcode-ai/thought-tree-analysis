But m is set to m=0 again, so in the loop m is incremented, which overwrites the original m. That's bad. So that's a bug. So that code has a problem. Ah right! So in the original code, after computing m = count..., then for the allocation, but then, in the loop for filling the arr array, the code reuses m as a counter, which would overwrite the original m.

Wait the loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < arr.size(); i++) result *= arr.get(i) - arr.get(i - 1); In Java arr.size() is the number of elements. So the loop iterates from i=1 to arr.size()-1. So for the indices 0-based, the differences between each element except the first one with the previous. In Fortran, the loop would also be from i=2 to m, since arr(2) minus arr(1), up to arr(m) minus arr(m-1). So the length of arr is m elements, so the number of terms multiplied is m-1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n, then reads n integers. It collects the indices where the value is 1 into a list called arr. Then, if there are no 1s, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the product of the differences between consecutive indices in arr and prints that product.\n\nHmm, translating that to Fortran. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst step is reading the input. In Java, they use a Scanner. In Fortran, I'll probably read from standard input using read(*,*) statements. \n\nThe array of positions where the input is 1. In Java it's an ArrayList. In Fortran, since the size isn't known upfront, maybe I need to use an allocatable array. But how do I collect the indices? Let's see:\n\nThe main steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n integers, and for each, check if it's 1. If so, record the index (starting at 0? Since Java uses 0-based here, but Fortran is 1-based typically. Wait, in the Java code, the loop starts at 0, so the first element is i=0, then added to arr. So when they compute differences, like for a list [a, b, c], they do b - a, c - b, etc. So in Fortran, if we are using 1-based indices, the positions stored would be from 1 to n. But to match the original calculation, when they have indices starting at 0, then maybe in Fortran we need to subtract 1 from each position? Or perhaps not, since the difference would just be between the stored indices? Let me check the code:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) if (input.nextInt() ==1 ) arr.add(i).\n\nSo the indices stored in arr are the 0-based indices starting at 0. So for example, the first element is i=0, the second is 1, etc.\n\nTherefore, the differences in Java between elements are (i_j - i_{j-1}), which would be the same as between the stored indexes. \n\nIn Fortran, when we process each element, the first element is at 1-based index, but we want 0-based. To do that: when we read the elements, for each element at fortran index i (1-based), the actual 0-based is i-1. So when we collect the indices, we need to store (i-1) for each position.\n\nSo that first step: read n, then for each of the next n numbers, check if it is 1. If yes, store (position-1), where the position is 1-based in Fortran.\n\nNow how do we store these indices in Fortran? Since the number is unknown, we can collect them into a dynamically sized array. In Fortran 90 and later, we can use an allocatable array, but it requires resizing. Alternatively, maybe we can first count the number of 1s, then allocate an array of that size. That's more efficient, perhaps.\n\nLet me see the steps:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, loop through each element (1 to n), count the number of 1s. Then, allocate an array of that size. Then, loop again, and write the indices into the array. But that requires two passes over the data. Which may be okay if the input is manageable, but maybe the data can be read in one pass by first counting the size.\n\nAlternatively, in the first pass, just count the number of 1s (call it m), then allocate an array of size m, and on a second pass, fill in the array. \n\nIn Java, the ArrayList grows dynamically, so that's handled automatically. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, can I append onto the array as I go? Since I can't dynamically extend an array on the fly without using a vector or something. Hmm, maybe better to make a first pass to count m.\n\nLet me consider this approach:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = some big number? But that might not be a good idea for big n. Alternatively, first pass:\n\nInitialize m =0, then read n elements, and each time a 1 is found, m increments. Then, allocate the array arr of size m. Then, loop again to get the indices into arr.\n\nBut then the problem is that when you read the input twice, how do you read the data again? Unless the input is read all into an array first. \n\nYes, perhaps we need to first read all the numbers into an array, then make one pass through that array to collect the indices. \n\nSo the steps in Fortran would be:\n\nRead n. \n\nThen, create an array of n integers. Read them all into this array. \n\nThen process the array to collect the indices where the value is 1. \n\nSo that's better. Because then in one pass, we can do the first read. \n\nSo let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables:\n\ninteger         :: n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: data(:), arr(:)\ninteger             :: i, m=0, result=1\n\nBut wait in the Java code, the result is a \"long\", so if n is large, the product can be very big. In Fortran, integers can be kind 8 or 16 depending on the compiler. We'll have to use a larger kind. Let's think about that.\n\nThe Java code's result is initialized as a \"long\", which is 64-bit. So in Fortran, perhaps we need to use integer(8). So let's make sure that variable is of kind 8.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger(8) :: result = 1. But in Fortran, initializing it as 1 is okay.\n\nAlternatively declare as integer*8 or select_int_kind. Hmm. Maybe using SELECTED_INT_KIND but perhaps getting into that is overcomplicating. Let's just use integer(8).\n\nSo, back to steps.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read all the elements into an array called data. Then, loop through the data array to record the indices (0-based i-1) where the value is 1 into arr. \n\nWait, since data is 1-based, the first element is data(1), which would correspond to index 0 in the original code.\n\nSo storing arr(1) = 0, if data(1) is 1.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nallocate( data(n) )\n\nread(*,*) data\n\nthen m is the count of elements in data equal to one.\n\nso:\n\nm = count( data == 1 )\n\nif m ==0, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nallocate( arr(m) )\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   if ( data(i) ==1 ) then\n\n      m_idx = ...the next m positions?\n\nWait, since we need to collect the indices where the value is 1. To first size arr as m, then loop through, and fill up arr.\n\nAlternatively, better to have a counter. Loop over data elements, when data(i) is 1, then:\n\ncount keeps track and we can write that.\n\nInitialize counter as zero:\n\ncounter =0\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   if ( data(i) ==1 ) then\n\n        counter = counter +1\n\n        arr(counter) = i-1 ! since original indices were 0-based\n\n   end if\n\nenddo\n\nSince m is equal to counter, but since we've already allocated arr(m), that's okay.\n\nWait but m was computed as count(data ==1), which is equivalent. So the loop will fill arr(1) to arr(m).\n\nThen, if m is zero, then print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nresult =1\n\ndo i=2 to m:\n\n    result = result * (arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n\nthen print the result.\n\nWait the original Java calculates between consecutive elements in the list. For example, if arr has elements [a0,a1,...,am] (starting at 0 in Java's zero-based, which in Fortran is a1, a2... starting at i=1 up to m).\n\nWait the loop in Java is:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < arr.size(); i++) result *= arr.get(i) - arr.get(i - 1);\n\nIn Java arr.size() is the number of elements. So the loop iterates from i=1 to arr.size()-1. So for the indices 0-based, the differences between each element except the first one with the previous.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop would also be from i=2 to m, since arr(2) minus arr(1), up to arr(m) minus arr(m-1). So the length of arr is m elements, so the number of terms multiplied is m-1. So in the loop:\n\ndo i=2, m\n\n    result = result * (arr(i) - arr(i-1))\n\nenddo\n\nThus, the code logic is the same.\n\nNow, handling possible potential overflows.\n\nThe Java code uses long which can handle up to 2^63, so perhaps in Fortran 64-bit integers would be sufficient. So we'll need to use integer(8).\n\nTherefore, steps in Fortran:\n\nFirst code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_617_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, m\n    integer, allocatable :: data(:), arr(:)\n    integer(8) :: result\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate( data(n) )\n    read(*,*) data   ! read all n elements into data.\n    ! Now find the count m.\n    m = count( data == 1 )\n    if ( m == 0 ) then\n        print*, 0\n    else\n        allocate( arr(m) )\n        m =0 ! reset counter, better to use another variable?\n        do i=1, n\n            if ( data(i) == 1 ) then\n                m = m +1\n                arr(m) = i-1  ! since it's 0-based\n            end if\n        enddo\n        ! Now calculate the product.\n        result = 1\n        do i=2, m\n            result = result * ( arr(i) - arr(i-1) )\n        enddo\n        print*, result\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(data)\n    if ( allocated(arr) ) deallocate(arr)\nend program codeforces_617_B\n\nWait, but when calculating m, initially I used m = count(data==1) which is correct. But then when filling the array, the loop again counts?\n\nWait, no. The count is m (from the count). So the allocate(arr(m)) can be done directly. Then a counter variable needs to be used to track the current position in arr. But in the current code, I reuse m. But m is set to m=0 again, so in the loop m is incremented, which overwrites the original m. That's bad. So that's a bug. So that code has a problem.\n\nAh right! So in the original code, after computing m = count..., then for the allocation, but then, in the loop for filling the arr array, the code reuses m as a counter, which would overwrite the original m. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo need to do that again with a different variable. So:\n\nInstead of reusing m, let's use a different counter variable, say, cnt =0.\n\nLet me correct that part:\n\nAfter allocating arr(m):\n\nThen, set cnt =0. Then in the loop over data elements:\n\ncnt is initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\n  allocate( arr(m) )\n\n  cnt =0\n\n  do i=1, n\n\n     if ( data(i) == 1 ) then\n\n         cnt = cnt +1\n\n         arr(cnt) = i-1\n\n     end if\n\n  enddo\n\nYes, because m is the size of arr, so cnt will go from 1 to m. So that way m remains the size, and cnt is the counter.\n\nBut this requires using a different variable cnt. \n\nAlternatively, can just use a loop over the data array again, but that would require another pass. However, in the current code approach, since the data array was needed anyway, it's better to do it in one loop, but with separate variables.\n\nAt any rate, the code above needs that correction.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, the syntax for reading arrays is straightforward.\n\nAnother thing: when the n is the first input, but in fortran, when you read an array, you can read it with read( *, * ) something. However, the read statement for reading the array after n. \n\nWait, the first read is:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nThen the second is read(*,*) data. So that will read the next n integers from the input. But the second read statement must read exactly n integers. Which it should since the first read got n.\n\nBut in cases where input is not exactly n elements. But code is assuming that the input is correct. For the problem statement, that's acceptable.\n\nAnother thing is the way to handle the input. Let me see in the Java code, they use nextInt() each time. So all numbers are separated by whitespace, and the data array in fortran would read them all.\n\nOkay, so the corrected code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_617_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, m, cnt\n    integer, allocatable :: data(:), arr(:)\n    integer(8) :: result = 1 ! Initialize to 1?\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate( data(n) )\n\n    read(*,*) data  ! Read all data elements.\n\n    m = count( data == 1 )\n\n    if ( m ==0 ) then\n        print*, 0\n    else\n\n        allocate( arr(m) )\n\n        cnt =0\n        do i =1, n\n            if ( data(i) ==1 ) then\n                cnt = cnt +1\n                arr(cnt) = i-1\n            endif\n        enddo\n\n        result = 1\n        do i=2, m\n            result = result * ( arr(i) - arr(i-1) )\n        enddo\n\n        print*, result\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Deallocate. Though not strictly necessary at end, but good practice.\n\n    deallocate( data )\n    if( allocated(arr) ) deallocate( arr )\n\nend program codeforces_617_B\n\nWait but I also initialized result as 1. Yes.\n\nWait in the first else block, after allocating, we can safely assume that m is at least 1 (since m !=0 from the if (m==0) condition. So the loop from 2 to m will only execute if m >=2. For m=1, the loop doesn't run, so result stays 1. Which is correct, because the product of zero differences (since only one element exists) is 1.\n\nLet me test with an example. \n\nSuppose n=3 and the input is 1 1 1. Then the indices (0-based) are 0,1,2. The differences are 1-0=1, 2-1=1. So product is 1*1=1. The code will have m=3, so loop from i=2 to 3 (i=2 and 3? Wait no, when m=3, the loop is from 2 to m, i.e., 2 and 3? Wait m=3, so:\n\nloop runs i=2, 3?\n\nWait no, in Fortran the range is inclusive. So when m=3, 2 to m is 2,3. Wait but for 3 elements, the differences between consecutive are two steps. Let's see: the indices are [0,1,2]. so arr(2) - arr(1) =1, and arr(3)-arr(2)=1. So two differences. product is 1*1.\n\nThe loop in fortran for i from 2 to 3 (since m is 3):\n\ni=2: difference between arr(2)-arr(1) \u2192 1 -0 =1 \u2192 result =1 *1 \u21921.\n\ni=3: arr(3) -arr(2) \u21921 \u21921*1=1.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother example n=1 and the input is 1. The array arr has one element (the index 0). So the product is over nothing. So the result remains 1, so the code will output 1. Which matches the logic.\n\nBut according to the problem description, what is the correct answer when there are exactly 1 one?\n\nLooking back at the problem (though user just gave code, but maybe the problem expects that when n=1 and one is 1, the answer is 1 (product of zero terms is 1? Though perhaps the problem requires different. Wait maybe I need to think: in the code, for when the list is of size 1, the code does the loop from 1 to arr.size()-1? Let's look at the java code.\n\nIn java, the loop is for (int i=1; i < arr.size(); ...), so when arr's size is 1, the loop doesn't run. So the result remains 1. So the output is 1. Hence, the code in the problem's java code does that, so the Fortran code is correct.\n\nAnother test case. \n\nExample in the problem's code: \n\nSuppose n=5, and input is 1 0 1 0 1. The indices are 0,2,4.\n\nSo differences are 2-0=2, 4-2=2 \u21922 \u00d72=4. So output 4. The code should compute arr(2)-arr(1)=2, arr(3)-arr(2)=2 \u2192 multiply 2*2=4. Correct.\n\nSo in the code, this would be handled correctly.\n\nNow, about the variables in the Fortran code. Are all variables properly declared and used?\n\nLooking at variables:\n\nn is declared as integer. reads the first input fine.\n\ndata is an allocatable array with size n. Then allocation and read.\n\nm is computed as the count of 1's.\n\nIf m=0 \u2192 output 0. Else, the rest.\n\nAfter allocating arr(m), then using a cntvariable.\n\nWait another minor issue: the code uses 'result = 1 ' before the loop, so that's okay. \n\nThe initial value is set correctly. \n\nWait in Fortran, the code is initialized outside of the first if block. So yes. \n\nNow, what about when m=0? Then the code does if-else, so the else is skipped. \n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, integers assigned are 4-byte (depending on the compiler), but when n is up to 1e5 or such, and the product is very large? Well, the problem may have constraints, but in the code the problem's required product is handled as a 'long' in Java, which is 64 bits. So using integer(8) in Fortran should be sufficient.\n\nBut when m is large, the product can be very big. For example, if there are many 1's with large gaps between them, their product may exceed even 64-bit. But in programming contest problems, such cases would have test cases that are manageable, or the code is correct as required. The problem's code uses 'long' so probably that's the required precision. \n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, let me write the final code carefully:\n\nAlso note in Fortran's print, making sure the result is printed as an integer. The result is integer(8), so in the print statement, using *, will format it as an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's safer to use the I0 format:\n\nprint*, result \u2192 OK.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_617_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, m, cnt\n    integer, allocatable :: data(:), arr(:)\n    integer(8) :: result =1 ! Initialize to 1\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    allocate( data(n) )\n    read(*,*) (data(i), i=1,n)  ! alternative read statement to read the array? Or just read(*,*) data.\n\n    m = count(data ==1 )\n\n    if ( m == 0 ) then\n        print*, 0\n    else\n        allocate( arr(m) )\n        cnt=0\n        do i=1, n\n            if ( data(i) ==1 ) then\n                cnt=cnt +1\n                arr(cnt) = i-1\n            end if\n        end do\n        result =1\n        do i=2, m\n            result = result * ( arr(i) - arr(i-1) )\n        end do\n        print*, result\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(data)\n    if ( allocated(arr) ) deallocate(arr)\nend program codeforces_617_B\n\nWait in the read statement, using read(*,*) data \u2014 the array data is of size n. The read will read exactly n values. So that's correct. Alternatively, the second read could be read( *,* ) ( data ), but the syntax without parentheses is read(*,*) data, which is correct. \n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: the stdio in fortran may require the brackets?\n\nWait no, infortran you can read the entire array with read(*,*) data, where data is an array. The parentheses are only needed when using list-directed formatting. Wait the read statement for an array can be done as read( *,* ) data, but in standard Fortran, the explicit do loops are not needed unless you are reading row-wise with for 2D arrays, etc.\n\nSo the read(*,*) data is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me double-check the loops:\n\nIn the code, when the arr is filled with the indices (0-based), yes.\n\nThe differences between elements are correctly calculated.\n\nThus, this should be the correct Fortran translation of the provided Java code."
