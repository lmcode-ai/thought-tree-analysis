Wait the order is:\n\ni = i+1 \u2192 becomes 0, then process the condition (checking indexes for 0 and 1?), then the next loop check. But for each uy, the inner loop variable in Fortran will be similar: starting at -1 \u2192 i becomes 0 after the initial increment, etc. Hmm.",

Yes, that logic works. Thus the code above's structure is okay. But in the code written earlier, the inner loop is called inner_loop:\n\nInside the condition, after setting yes, you must exist the inner loop to allow the outer loop to check. Thankfully, when you set yes, then the outer loop's 'if (yes ==1 ) ' will trigger an exit outer_loop. Thus the code as outlined should work. But note the possible out-of-bounds errors in character accesses. For example, column =1 (i=1).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nSo the Java program reads four strings, each of which is presumably a two-character string since the loops later reference i up to 2. Wait, in Java, the code uses a Scanner to input four strings, stored in an array of size 4. Then there are some nested loops checking for some conditions between adjacent rows (u and u+1?) and columns (i and i+1?) to print YES or NO.\n\nBreaking down the Java code step by step might help. Let's walk through it.\n\nFirst, the main method initializes a Scanner to read input. Then it declares str as an array of four Strings. Then there's a loop that increments i from -1 up to 3, actually filling the array with four elements via sc.next(). So each element of str is a token read from input, probably four 2-character strings? Because when checking characters later, they go up to i=2, which would be the third index, but maybe each string is two characters. Wait, in Java, strings are of variable length, but looking at the loops in the conditions:\n\nThe condition variables u starts at -1, so when u increments, it first becomes 0? The loop runs while u is not 2. Let me see:\n\nThe outer loop u starts at -1 and increments. The first time u becomes 0, then the internal i loop goes up to 2? Because i starts at -1 and increments until i !=2. So i will go to 0, 1, then 2 when it breaks? Wait, in the inner loop, i starts at -1, then increments to 0, checks i !=2, which is true, increments to 1, check, then increments to 2, which would not be, so exits? So the inner loop runs i =0 and 1? Because when i reaches 2, the loop exits. Because the loop condition is while(i !=2), so when i reaches 2, the loop stops. So the inner loop runs i=0, 1, and 2 is the last step? Wait maybe I should track:\n\nInitially, i is set to -1 each time the outer loop runs. Let's see in the outer loop:\n\nThe first time, u is -1. Then u increments to 0, then check while u !=2? Wait original code:\n\nThe code says \"while (u != 2)\", so the loop continues as long as u isn't 2. So u starts at -1, so it goes until u=2 stops? So u goes from 0 to 2? Wait let's think:\n\nStart: u starts as -1. The outer loop is a while loop: while (u !=2). So first, while (-1 !=2): true, so enter loop. Then inside, u is first incremented? Or the step is first?\n\nWait the loop's condition continues. The code:\n\nu = -1;\n\nthe loop is:\n\nwhile (u != 2) { \n\n    u = u +1; \n\n    i = -1; \n\n    while( i !=2 ) { i +1; ...} \n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nWait the way it's written: in the u loop, we first add 1 to u. So first iteration:\n\nAfter the loop condition check (u is -1: so in the loop), then inside, u becomes 0. \n\nThen the inner loop:\n\nEach time the inner i loop does i starts at -1, then increments. So:\n\nOuter loop for u:\n\nStarting u=-1: enters loop. \n\nThen u +=1 (so becomes 0). Then process the i loop. \n\nThe i loop is:\n\ni = -1;\n\nwhile (i !=2) { \n\n    i +=1 \n\n    ... \n\n}\n\nThus, i goes to 0, then 1, then 2, but the loop's condition is while (i !=2), so when i is 2, the loop stops. So the inner loop runs for i = 0, 1. \n\nWait:\n\nIn the inner loop:\n\nStart with i = -1.\n\nThen first iteration of the inner while:\n\ni is -1, so enter loop. Then add 1 to i (i becomes 0). So the first code step is i becomes 0. Then the condition is still checked after the loop block.\n\nWait, the structure of a while loop in Java is: the condition is checked before entry. So, in the inner loop, after setting i to -1, the first check is: i !=2 \u2192 yes, so enter loop. Then inside, first you do i +=1 (so i becomes 0), then the rest of the code (condition checks) so.\n\nWait, the code inside the inner loop is:\n\ni increments to 0, then the condition part. So the body of the loop is the block. So each iteration of the inner loop:\n\n1. Enter the loop if (i !=2) is true before entering.\n\n2. First, i is incremented by 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the code inside the while loop's body is all that's executed. Let me look again.\n\nWait the code inside the inner while loop (which is the body of the while condition) is:\n\ni = i +1;\n\nWait no\u2014the original Java code for the inner loop:\n\nThe code says inside the inner while loop: \n\ni becomes i+1. \n\nWait, in the code:\n\nThe inner loop is:\n\nwhile (i != 2) {\n\n    i = i +1;\n\n    ... the rest of the code?\n\nWait looking back, in the Java code:\n\nThe inner loop is while (i != 2) { \n\n    i = i +1;\n\n    // then some condition checks\n\n}\n\nWait that's not the standard way. So that code's structure may not be correct, but let's parse exactly:\n\nOriginal Java code for the inner loop (the part after u is incremented and set to...):\n\nThe code:\n\nwhile (i != 2) { \n\n    i = i +1; \n\n    // then the if statement and the conditions\n\n}\n\nWait, so the first step is to check if i is not 2. Suppose at first iteration, i is -1. Then it is not 2, so enter loop. Then, inside the loop, i gets incremented by +1, so becomes 0. Then, the next lines are about checking the characters.\n\nWait that makes the code's logic:\n\nThe inner loop steps:\n\nInitially, i is set to -1.\n\nThen while (i !=2), the body is run. But the body starts with i++ to 0, then some checks. \n\nWait so for each iteration of the inner loop:\n\nLet me walk through the steps with i starting at -1:\n\nFirst pass:\n\nCheck while (i !=2 \u2192 -1 != 2 \u2192 true).\n\nInside the loop body:\n\ni becomes -1 +1 \u21920\n\nthen the rest: \n\nif ( ... )\n\nthen check the condition. \n\nThe next pass starts by looping again: Check i is now 0, which is not 2. So loop runs again. \n\nProceeding:\n\nSecond iteration of inner loop:\n\ni is currently 0 (after first loop increment). \n\nWait, no, the loop steps:\n\nWait the inner loop variable i is being increased at the beginning of each loop iteration. So the order is:\n\nloop:\n\ncheck condition (i !=2 \u2192 yes, so continue)\n\nthen i = i +1 \u2192 so i becomes 0 after the first step, then proceed.\n\nThe rest of the loop body (the if condition and else...)\n\nWait then, after the first iteration (i was -1 \u2192 increments to 0), then next loop check is for i (now 0), so it is entered again.\n\nSecond loop iteration:\n\nchecks i was 0 before the test? Wait I think I need to track:\n\nThe loop structure is:\n\nloop (while (i !=2)) {\n\n   i = i +1;\n\n   ... other code ...\n\n}\n\nSo the first iteration:\n\nAfter entering the loop (because i was -1 before this iteration, and -1 !=2):\n\nThen in the loop body:\n\ni becomes -1+1 =0.\n\nThen, the rest is the condition checks.\n\nNow, the next loop iteration will start again at the top:\n\nCheck (i is now 0 !=2 \u2192 yes). So next iteration.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\ni is 0 (current value) \u2192 i becomes 1 (i+1). \n\nThen check conditions again (with i=1).\n\nNext loop, third iteration:\n\nCheck: i is 1, so yes.\n\nbody:\n\ni becomes 1+1 =2. \n\n then checks for condition.\n\nNow after the loop body runs, the next loop iteration will check: i is now 2 \u2192 so the loop stops.\n\nWait but in that case, in the third iteration:\n\nAfter i becomes 2, the next check (loop condition) will check (i !=2 \u2192 2 !=2 \u2192 false, so exit loop.\n\nTherefore, the inner loop runs for i=0,1, and in the third pass, the i is incremented to 2, then the loop exits. \n\nBut the key is that the condition is tested before entering the loop body each time. Wait the process is:\n\nThe initial i value before first loop execution is -1. \n\nLoop iteration 1:\n\ni starts as -1.\n\nCheck (i !=2 \u2192 yes)\n\nenter loop:\n\ni +=1 \u2192 becomes 0 \u2192 then check the rest.\n\n Then after the loop body, goes back to the loop condition.\n\nSo in this way, the loop will iterate three times:\n\n- i incremented to 0, then 1, then 2. So loop body will run three times? Wait the first time, i becomes 0; the second time, 0 is not 2 \u2192 increment to 1; third iteration, i was 1 \u2192 increments to 2, then the checks, but then the next loop check is after that.\n\nWait perhaps the inner loop's body runs three times (for i=0,1,2?), but the code's check may stop early.\n\nHmm, the primary variables here are that the main comparison in the code is between str[u] and str[u+1]. The strings [u] must be adjacent since u is from 0 up to 1 (since u starts at 0, and the outer loop runs until u is not 2 \u2192 so u can be 0 and 1? Let me check the outer loop again:\n\nThe outer loop is while (u !=2). \n\nStarting with u =-1:\n\nfirst loop entry: u becomes 0 \u2192 then check again.\n\nLoop continues until u reaches 2 (since when u is 2, the while (2 !=2 \u2192 false, so exit). \n\nThus u can take values 0, 1, 2? But since the code is looking at u and u+1, then u can only be 0 and 1, because when u is 2, then u+1 becomes 3. Since the rows are 0-based (since the input has 4 strings, indices 0-3). So when u=2, the rows compared are 2 and 3. So the outer loop runs for u from 0 up to 2, which means 3 values (0,1,2), allowing u+1 to go up to 3.\n\nWait because in Java, the array is zero-based, so str has elements 0 to 3 (since the first loop uses i up to 3). The outer loop (u loop) goes from -1 through u becomes 2. So u+1 can reach 3. \n\nSo the outer loop runs for u from 0, 1, 2. Each time, the comparison is between string u and u+1 (because, for example, when u=0, compares row 0 and 1; when u=1, rows 1&2; when u=2, rows 2&3). \n\nNow, the code's condition checks for each u and the columns i where the pair's adjacent squares might form a square? Not sure of the problem's context. \n\nRegardless, the key is to translate this Java code into Fortran.\n\nNow, for the Fortran translation:\n\nFirst, note that Fortran uses arrays from 1-based indices by default (unless declared otherwise). So need to handle the indices.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed for the translation:\n\n1. Read four strings from input. Each string is of length 2 (since the Java code accesses i+1, which is up to 2. But really, in Java, the strings are accessed by charAt(i), and since the inner loop process i up to 2, but the maximum i is 2 (as per the loop hitting i=2 stops, but in the code, the check for str[u].charAt(i) and i+1 \u2013 so the characters must exist at least up to index 1. Wait perhaps the code expects the input strings to be exactly two characters each?\n\nYes, because in Java, for the inner loops, when i reaches 1 (the first run where i is 1), then i+1 would be 2. So in a two-character string (indexes 0 and 1), that's an error. Wait, wait a minute. Oh! This is a possible problem here.\n\nWait in Java, if a string has two characters, then str[i].charAt(1) is valid, but str[i].charAt(2) would be an error. In the code's current setup. Let me check:\n\nThe inner loop is for i being 0, 1. Because when the inner loop processes, i starts at -1, each iteration adds i by 1. \n\nWait:\n\nLooking at Java code's inner loop:\n\nInside the loop body, first i is being added 1 (e.g., first iteration i becomes 0, then next 1, then 2).\n\nThen, in the condition:\n\nThey check:\n\nstr[u].charAt(i) equals str[u].charAt(i+1)\n\nBut wait when i is 1, i+1 would be 2. If the string has only two characters (indices 0 and 1), then accessing index 2 would cause an exception. That's a problem, so maybe the input requires each string to be two characters each. Because only then, when i is 1, i+1 is 2 which would be out of bounds. \n\nWait no, perhaps the code is actually designed for the strings to be two characters (so index 0 and 1). Then in the inner loop, when i reaches 1, then i+1 is 2 (out of bounds). That would be an error. \n\nHmm. That's a possible bug in the original code. Unless the code is structured differently. Let me check the loops again.\n\nWait in the inner loop's conditions, the loop runs until i reaches 2. So when i becomes 2, the code would be accessing i+1, which would be 3. So this can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the loops.\n\nWait maybe the original code's loops aren't properly structured.\n\nWait perhaps there's a \"break\" that could exit early?\n\nLet me check the full condition:\n\nIn the Java code, the check is:\n\nif ( (str[u].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i+1) && ( ... ))...\n\nWait, but when i is 1, that's the second character's index in the string (assuming length 2). Then i+1 =2 is out of bounds. So perhaps the original code expects each string to be three characters long? Because i goes up to 2 (the third index, assuming zero-based). So maybe the code is based on 3-character strings, but that's unclear. Or perhaps the problem had a specific setup.\n\nWait this might be important, because in Fortran, handling strings with specific lengths is essential. \n\nWait perhaps the problem this Java code is solving is Codeforces problem 287A? I recall Codeforces problem 287A is \"Haybale Stacking,\" but maybe I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps this problem is from a history or variation where there are four rows of two cells each, arranged in a grid. The logical structure is that the code checks if any pair of consecutive rows has a matching condition across their columns.\n\nWait looking at the problem's name, the code class is \"codeforces_287_A\" \u2014 so possibly this is solution for 287 A, but I need recall what the problem requires. \n\nCodeforces problem 287A: Understanding it might help. Let me think: 287A is probably \"Counterexample\" or another problem. Wait, problem 287 on , yes?\n\nLet me think quickly: The problem might be about checking for a 2x2 square in a 2x4 grid? The code seems to check for two adjacent rows (u and u+1) across columns (i and i+1) for a certain condition.\n\nThe condition in the code is:\n\nIf either of the following is true between row u and row u+1:\n\nEither:\n\na. The current row has two same characters in column i and i+1 (i.e., same horizontally), and the lower row has that same character in either column i (same x position) or column i+1 (same as current's i+1's position)?\n\nWait the condition is structured as:\n\n(str[u][i] == str[u][i+1] \u2192 current row has a horizontal line.\n\nAnd then (str[u+1][i] == str[u][i] (same as current's top-left) OR str[u+1][i+1] == str[u][i] \u2192 so the lower row's right is the same as current's left.\n\nOR\n\nThe same for the other direction: the lower row has a horizontal pair (u+1's i ==i+1) and then comparing upwards. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is checking whether either the pair of horizontal same cells in row u has a corresponding in the next row. \n\nRegardless, even without knowing the problem's exact condition, the Java code needs to be translated as is, assuming that the code is correct.\n\nAssuming that each of the four input strings are two characters each (so length 2), but in the code's access to i=1, the i+1 would be 2, which is out of bounds. Wait perhaps in the Java code the strings are actually length 2, so the loop has an off-by-one error?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a different dimension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires four strings of two characters each, forming a 2x4 grid (each row has 2 chars?), and the code is looking for a 2x2 square where either columns are adjacent. For instance, in the code's condition, check each possible pair of adjacent rows (there are 3 pairs: rows 1-2, 2-3, 3-4?), wait but the indexes are 0-based. So the four rows are 0,1,2,3, so adjacent pairs are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 \u2192 three comparisons. \n\nThe inner loops for i. For columns, perhaps each row has two characters. So the columns are 0 and 1. So checking i from 0 to 0 (only first column index?), since the loop in the code's inner part might have an off-by-one. Wait this is getting confusing. \n\nWait the inner loop in the Java code:\n\nWhen the outer loop variable u is, say, 0 (so first row and second row are being evaluated), the inner i loop starts with i=-1, goes up to 2. \n\nSo for i=0, the code checks str[u].charAt(0) vs str[u].charAt(1). That works if the row's string is of length at least 2. \n\nBut when i is 1, then i+1 would be 2, which would be out of bounds if the string length is 2. So that could be a bug. \n\nHmm, perhaps each of the strings should be three characters long? Or maybe the code is okay because the loop is only 0 and 1? Wait let's recalculate:\n\nIn the inner loop, after i increments to 0: then when the code does the check.\n\nNext loop iteration (i becomes 1 after increment):\n\nit's allowed (0 is allowed, then becomes 1, which allows indices up to 1. The i+1 would then be 2. \n\nSo if the string is two characters, that would be an error. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code may have a bug, but since the problem asks to translate the code, not fix it, perhaps I'll proceed as per the Java code's logic. \n\nIn the Fortran code:\n\nBecause Fortran uses 1-based indices by default, I'll need to adjust the indices. The four strings would be stored in an array with indices 1 to 4. \n\nEach string in Fortran can be handled as a character array of length at least 2 (or more?). \n\nSo first, need to read four two-character strings. So in Fortran:\n\nRead four strings of length 2? So perhaps using a character array with dimensions (4, 2).\n\nWait perhaps in Fortran, declaring as:\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: str(4)\n\nThen read each line with read(*,*) str(1), str(2), etc. But maybe better to read each line as:\n\nSuppose the input is four strings each of two characters, each given on separate lines, or separated by spaces. In Java, it's using the Scanner's next(), which reads tokens, so the input is probably providing four tokens each of two characters. We'll need to read the four strings as tokens. \n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps read them as four strings using a format, like:\n\nread(*,*) str\n\nor using list-directed input (free form), but Fortran's handling of strings can be a bit fiddly.\n\nWait perhaps better to set up an array of four strings of length 2, and read each one in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, let me sketch the plan for the Fortran code:\n\n1. Declare an array of 4 strings, each with length 2 (since each is a 2-character string).\n\n   character(len=2) :: str(4)\n\n2. Read the input. Assuming the input consists of four tokens (each two characters), can read them in a loop:\n\n   do i = 1,4\n      read *, str(i)\n   end do\n\n   Wait but in Fortran, the read statement can accept multiple items in a list, but if it's user input, perhaps each string is entered on a separate line. But for the sake of the problem, perhaps it's four tokens. Maybe you need to read them in sequence. \n\nWait in the Java code, the scanner is reading each next token, so in Fortran, if given the input via spaces, then the following would be okay. \n\nNext, translate the loops and conditions:\n\nVariables i and u in Fortran: \n\nOriginally:\n\nJava's loops:\n\nvariables i and u start at -1 each time, but Fortran typically uses integers. Since Fortran variables can be initialized in do loops, but loops here are handled with while loops, which translates to do-while structures? \n\nWait in the Java code, the loops are while loops. To translate the outer loop for u:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nu starts at -1.\n\nwhile (u !=2):\n\n   u +=1 \u2192 becomes next value (0, 1, 2)\n\n   then process inner loops.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent would need to be a loop with counter:\n\nu =-1\n\ndo while (u /= 2)\n\n   u = u +1\n\n   ... process\n\n   then check for break via an exit statement.\n\nBut in the code, there's a 'break' inside the inner loop that may exit the outer loop early. \n\nWait the Java code structure has:\n\nIn the outer loop (u loop), after processing, if yes is set to 1 (found), then the inner loop breaks and the outer loop also breaks (because after the inner loop, there is an:\n\nif (yes==1) break.\n\nThus in the outer loop, once a valid case is found, it exits early.\n\nThe same has to be done in Fortran, possibly using flags (like Yes =0/1) and then exiting loops using GOTO or with proper loop control.\n\nHmm, the inner logic in Java is about checking for any of the u (row pairs) and any of the i (columns) positions. Once a condition is met, it prints YES and breaks out. Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, prints NO.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to:\n\n- Read the 4 strings, each of 2 characters.\n\n- Loop for u starting at 0 (since the rows to check are pairs 0-1,1-2,2-3 \u2192 in Fortran, 0 could be index 1, perhaps?)\n\nWait indices in Fortran are 1-based unless specified. So the first string is str(1), which corresponds to Java's str[0]. So the code's variables related to rows u have to be shifted from 0-based in Java to 1-based in Fortran. \n\nWait this is key! So in Java, the rows are indexed from 0-3. In Fortran, it must be 1-4. So when the code refers to str[u], where u in Java is 0, it's position 0 in Java corresponds to 1 in Fortran's array.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nThe rows being compared are:\n\nOriginal Java's (0 and 1) \u2192 Fortran 1 and 2.\n\nWait Java's u starts at 0 and can go up to 2 (total of three loops), so in Fortran, the equivalent variable yu = u +1?\n\nSo when the code in Java has:\n\nu is 0 \u2192 in Fortran, the first and second rows (indices 1 and 2)\n\nJava u is 1 \u2192 Fortran rows 2 and 3\n\nJava u=2 \u2192 rows 3 and 4\n\nSimilarly, for the columns i: the Java code's i starts at 0, and can be up to 2 (but that would go beyond if strings are two characters long). So if the strings have 2 characters (indices 0 and1 in Java), then:\n\nIn Java, i is allowed to be 0 and 1. The i+1 is 1 and 2. \n\nWait, this is a confusion. So in Java strings are of length 2, then i can only go up to 0, because when i=1, i+1=2 would be out of bounds. \n\nTherefore, perhaps there's an error in the original code's logic, but since it's given, we have to translate it as is. \n\nWait perhaps the strings are each of length 3? But the problem likely states they are 2x2, so perhaps the variables were meant to be up to i=0, but misprogrammed as 1. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is of 2x4 grid? \n\nWait, the problem might be from Codeforces 287A, the problem statement for which could be critical. Let me think: 287A is called \"Yes, it's 287th!\" \u2014 a tennis points problem. Alternatively, maybe another problem. But perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nBack to the Fortran translation.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nDeclare the strings. Let's do:\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: str(4)\n\nLet me think that each str contains two characters (input as two-character strings).\n\nRead loop:\n\ndo i=1,4\n   read(*,*) str(i)\nenddo\n\nNext: the outer loop.\n\nJava initializes u =-1, but in Fortran, since we need to start similarly, since u in Java starts at -1 and loops until it reaches 2 (the loop runs when u !=2), which in Fortran variables we can do:\n\ninteger :: uy\n\nuy = -1 \n\ndo while (uy /= 2) \n\n   uy = uy +1 \n\n   ... the inner loop \n\n   ... etc. \n\nBut since arrays are 1-based, we need:\n\nThe current row pair is uy and uy+1.\n\nThus for u=0 (Java) \u2192 uy is 0 \u2192 but in Fortran rows start at 1, so str(u+1) and str(u+2)?\n\nWait in Java's first iteration, u starts at -1, then u becomes 0. Then it compares rows 0 and1 (Java indices). Therefore, in Fortran, the same would be str(1) and str(2). So for uy values 0 corresponds to Fortran's 1, so we can have:\n\nrow1 = uy +1 \n\nrow2 = row1+1 \u2192 or row1 is uy's respective increment.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nInside the do while loop (on uy):\n\n   uy is 0 \u2192 then row1 =1, row2=2\n\n   uy=1\u2192 rows 2 and 3;\n\n   uy=2\u2192 rows 3 and4.\n\nThus the outer loop in Fortran must run for uy from 0 to 2 (Java's original), but initialized from start uy=-1 \u2192 becomes uy=0 in first iteration, etc. The condition checked is uy !=2, so it will run three times (uy=0,1,2). \n\nNow, the inner loop is over i, which in Java:\n\nStarts at i=-1, but inside the loop increments first, then process.\n\nWait, the inner loop code in Java is:\n\ni starts at -1\n\nwhile (i != 2):\n\n   i +=1 \n\n   if condition then... \n\nWait this is structured so that the first time the loop is entered, they increment i, so:\n\nIn Java, the code for the inner loop has the structure where after starting with i =-1, the loop runs when i !=2.\n\nInside the loop: i is increased by 1 before processing.\n\nWait the order is:\n\ni = i+1 \u2192 becomes 0, then process the condition (checking indexes for 0 and 1?), then the next loop check.\n\nBut for each uy, the inner loop variable in Fortran will be similar: starting at -1 \u2192 i becomes 0 after the initial increment, etc. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the inner loop variable.\n\nThe inner loop in Java is:\n\ni =-1\n\nwhile (i !=2):\n\n   i +=1\n\n   condition checks...\n\nSo the loop runs for i values 0,1,2. But with the condition to break in case of a hit (to exit all loops)\n\nWait the code inside the body must check for the conditions and break.\n\nThe condition checks for each i. The i+1 is part of the character access. \n\nThus, in Java, the code's condition is:\n\nif ( ( ( str[u][i] == str[u][i+1] ) and ( either str[u+1][i] equals str's current i's char, or str[u+1][i+1] equals str[u][i] )\n\nOR \n\na similar condition for the other row first being equal.\n\nWait the code's condition is:\n\nif ( \n\n(str[u].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i+1) && \n\n( \n\nstr[u+1].charAt(i) == str[u].charAt(i) \u2192 same as top-left?\n\nOR str[u+1].charAt(i+1) == str[u].charAt(i) \n\n)\n\n)\n\n||\n\n(str[u +1].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i+1) && \n\n(\n\nstr[u].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i) \u2192 top matches left \n\nOR str[u].charAt(i+1) == str[u+1].charAt(i)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\nthen yes is set and breaks. \n\nThis condition is checking two possibilities:\n\n1. The current row (row u) has a horizontal pair (i and i+1 are equal). So the current row has two same chars in adjacent columns. Then, in the next row (u+1), the left or right char matches this row\u2019s char. That could form a 2x2 square? \n\nOR:\n\n2. The next row (u+1) has the two same adjacent chars, and the current row's chars match in some way. \n\nThe code checks each potential i (columns) for these conditions, and if found, outputs YES.\n\nIn Fortran, the same logic must be applied. \n\nHandling the strings in Fortran: Each str(i,j) will be access as str(row%index, column%char). Wait, but in Fortran, the strings are stored as the first dimension is the row, and each element of the array has two characters. So for a string str(1), the first character is str(1)(1:1) and second is str(1)(2:2).\n\nThus the characters are accessed as str(row, col), but in Fortran:\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=2) :: str(4)\n\nThus, str(1)(1) is the first character of the first string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Fortran, strings are contiguous. So str(1) is the first string (two characters). To get the first character of the first string, you use str(1)(1:1), since the string is a length 2. So to get the characters:\n\nstr(row)(char_pos) where char_pos can be 1 or 2. \n\nTherefore, the code can use (str(uy +1)(i+1) for the character at position i+1 of the row uy.\n\nBut variables in Fortran:\n\nThe inner loop is over i (column indices). The inner loop in Java's variable is i starts at -1 (Fortran's variable starts at i = -1, but since in Fortran arrays are 1-based for the columns: so the first character is 1, so perhaps in Java's i=0 is Fortran's column 1, and for the code's inner loop variables, we can set a variable \"col\" for the Fortran version.\n\nBut perhaps in the Fortran code, variables retain being 0-based but with adjustments, but need to be handled with care.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the loop variables can also be 0-based. To avoid array subscript issues, we can just use integer variables starting at 0, but in Fortran 90+, array indices can also be declared with bounds. \n\nWait perhaps better to make arrays with dimensions that start at 0. But to do that, you have to use the bind(c) attribute for integers?\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to translate the loops directly by shifting indices.\n\nBut let me attempt the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code variables:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: str(4)\n\ninteger :: uy, i, yes=0\n\nThen, read in the four strings:\n\ndo i =1,4\n\n    read *, str(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen the outer loop:\n\nuy = -1\n\ndo while (uy .ne. 2)\n\n    uy = uy + 1\n\n    ! so uy is 0 in first loop, up to 2.\n\n    ! Now for the current row pair: row u and u+1 (Java terms) \u2192 Fortran rows are uy+1 and uy+2 ?\n\n    ! Yes.

So in this loop, i starts at 0, then 1, then 2.\n\n        integer :: c = i \n\n        ! wait, but in the code's conditions, two chars are at position c and c+1.\n\n        ! thus, c needs to be 0 up to 1 (since in Java's two-character string, c+1 is 1 \u2192 max 1.\n\n        ! So in the case where c=1, then c+1 is 2 (which is beyond the two-char string, but that's how the code works )\n\n        ! Thus in Fortran, with two-character strings, accessing c+1 may be wrong.\n\n        ! So variables here are c (column in Java's counts). In Fortran, the characters are 1 and 2 for a two-character string, \n\n        ! thus position 0 in Java is 1 here.\n\n        ! So since in Java, column indices are 0 and 1 (for two chars), but in Fortran, it's 1 and 2.\n\n        ! So in Fortran, the columns to check are c_col = c +1 (the Java's c).\n\n        ! Thus for c=0 \u2192 1, c+1=2 (the second char)\n\n        ! For c=1 \u2192 column 2 (Java's c=1, then c+1 is2 (3 in Fortran), which exceeds. \n\n        ! Thus, the code has a problem here, but since we are transiting as per the original Java code, we'll go ahead.\n\n        ! Proceeding.\n\n        !

Now, the condition is complicated. Let me parse the condition again.\n\n        !

Wait let me check the original Java line:\n\n        The second condition is:\n\n        (str[u+1].charAt(i) == str[u+1].charAt(i+1) \u2192 v's chars equal) \n\n        AND \n\n        ( (str[u][i] == str[u+1][i] \u2192 a[i] == v[i] \n\n           OR str[u][i+1] == str[u+1][i] \u2192 a's i+1 == v's i) )\n\n        So the second part is:\n\n        condition2 (v's chars equal) and ( (a_char_1 == v_char1) or (a_char_2 == v_char1) )\n\n        Thus:\n\n        cond2_a = condition2 .AND.

So, after checking, if yes is 1, break it.\n\n    ! Need to structure breaks properly.\n\n    ! Once the condition is met, the code breaks out with 'break' in Java, which exits the closest loop, and then the outer loop has a 'break' condition after that.\n\n    ! In the Java code, the inner 'break' exits the inner loop and then checks if yes is set.\n\n    ! Thus, after the inner loop's if condition is true, it prints YES, sets yes=1, then breaks. \n\n    ! Then, the code has: \n\n    'break; ' \u2192 exits the inner loop, and after, the outer loop checks if yes is set \u2192 if so it breaks the outer loop.\n\n    ! Thus in Fortran, after any case entering the if (big_cond), we set yes and then need to exit all loops, perhaps.\n\n    ! But loops are nested, so to exit all, need to use a GOTO or check after the loops.\n\n    However, in the current loop (the inner loop over i):\n\n    After encountering the big_cond is true, we can do:\n\n    if (big_cond) then \n\n        write(*,*)\"YES\"\n\n        yes =1 \n\n        exit \n\n    ! exit the inner do while loop. \n\n    !

After the inner loop, check:\n\n    if (yes ==1) then\n\n        exit \n\n    end if \n\nend do ! outer uy loop.\n\n! Then finally, if yes is still zero, print NO.\n\nif (yes ==0) then\n\n    write(*,*) \"NO\"\n\nend if \n\nWait but in the above breakdown, I need to reconstruct the logic step by step.\n\nThe inner loop's body in Fortran would have:\n\nInside the do while:\n\ni =i+1 (Java's step)\n\nThen calculate the characters for rows u and v at position i (Java's i \u2192 c =i).\n\nChecking all conditions.\n\nIf it satisfies, set yes to 1 and print \"YES\", then exit the inner i loop.\n\nBut in the loop structure of the inner loop:\n\nIn Fortran, it's tricky because the inner loop is while-style.

So accessing (3) would cause an error. \n\nBut in the Java code, that's the case too (Java's code would crash). So that suggests the inputs probably have three-character strings, but given that the code tries to access characters beyond their length, perhaps it's better to stick to it. However, proceeding under the assumption that in the Fortran code, the reads are correctly of two characters, then accessing the third position will be past bounds. \n\nHowever, given that the code is to be translated as is, I'll proceed. \n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared at the top of the program. \n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nprogram codeforces287\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=2) :: str(4)\n\n    integer :: uy, i, yes = 0\n\n    integer :: row1, row2, column \n\n    !

The 'exit' inside the inner loop can only exit the inner loop. To exit the outer loop also, the program needs to be handled by the outer loop's check.\n\nAlternatively, after the ' exit inner_loop', then the code proceeds to the after-wrapper, and in the outer loop, the if (yes ==1) then exit.\n\nThus, using the structure:\n\nOnce inside the inner loop's condition, set yes and exit the inner loop. \n\nThen, after the inner loop completes, we check if yes is set \u2192 and if yes, then the outer loop can exit on its next iteration.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nWait let me think:\n\nInside the inner loop, after the condition block, when it's triggered, we can:\n\n- print \"YES\"\n\n- yes=1\n\n- exit the inner loop \n\nThen proceeding to the outer loop, which after the inner loop is done, will check if yes is set. Yes is 1 \u2192 so exit the outer loop. \n\nYes, that logic works.\n\nThus the code above's structure is okay.\n\nBut in the code written earlier, the inner loop is called inner_loop:\n\nInside the condition, after setting yes, you must exist the inner loop to allow the outer loop to check. \n\nThankfully, when you set yes, then the outer loop's 'if (yes ==1 ) ' will trigger an exit outer_loop.\n\nThus the code as outlined should work.\n\nBut note the possible out-of-bounds errors in character accesses.\n\nFor example, column =1 (i=1). column+2 is 3 \u2192 which for a length 2 string will go beyond the string's length. \n\nIn Fortran, accessing beyond the string's length would give undefined results (since no array subscripts are checks). For a string of length 2, (3) would be out of bounds. \n\nThis suggests that the input strings are of length 3?\n\nWait the original Java code must have strings of length 3 to have i+1 be within. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input strings are three-character strings. Thus, in Fortran, the declaration should be:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: str(4) \n\nThus the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nAssuming that each input string is three characters long (truthful for the code to not crash), but in the given code's problem, perhaps each row (the strings) is a string of two characters, but the Java code is erroneous. \n\nThis could be a problem.\n\nBut since the problem asks to translate the Java code to Fortran, the Fortran code must replicate , including any bugs. Hence, the strings length should allow for the same conditionals. SO in the Fortran code, the strings must actually have length of 3 (to allow access to column+2 when i=1 \u2192 column+2 =3 \u2192 3rd character of the string.\n\nThus, to make the code work as per the Java logic, the strings in Fortran must have length 3.\n\nTherefore, modifying the Fortran code to read strings of length 3.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is different. The Java code's strings are of length 3? Maybe each row is three characters?\n\nAlternatively, the loop in the Java code's inner loops may be scaffold to run i from 0 to 1:\n\nBecause when the inner loop runs:\n\ni starts at -1, increments to 0 \u2192 i=0, then check if i !=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 loop continues.\n\ni=0 \u2192 then i increments next time to 1 \u2192 check i\u22602 \u2192 yes \u2192 loop proceeds.\n\nthen i=1 \u2192 then next increments to 2 \u2192 since condition becomes (2 !=2 \u2192 false \u2192 exit.\n\nThus the inner loop runs for i=0 and 1.\n\nWait hold on:\n\nWait for i in inner loop:\n\nThe loop condition is 'while (i !=2): \n\nSo initial steps: i starts at -1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nCheck if ( -1 !=2 \u2192 true. Enter \u2192 inside, loop performs i +=1 \u2192 becomes 0. Execute steps. , including checking.\n\nNext iteration: Now i is 0. \n\nLoop condition: 0 !=2 \u2192 yes. \n\nNext step:\n\ni becomes 0+1 \u21921 \n\n process \n\n Next loop: i=1 !=2 \u2192 yes. \n\n inside:\n\n i becomes 1+1 \u21922.\n\n Evaluate code.\n\n The loop exits because when checking the loop condition again (after this), the i is 2 now. \n\n Thus the loop runs for i=0 and 1. \n\nWait thus i runs for values 0 and 1 (since the increment leaves i becoming 2, but the next loop check stops.\n\n Therefore each iteration inside will be for i=0 and i=1:\n\n the i variable after increment:\n\nfirst loop:\n\ni after increment is 0 \u2192 processing.\n\nsecond loop:\n\ni is 1 (after increment to1 \u2192 yes.\n\nthird loop:\n\nthe increment makes it 2 \u2192 then the loop condition check after that \u2192 2 !=2 is false \u2192 loop exits.\n\n Thus the inner loop's i is 0 and 1. \n\nThus the strings must have length 2 (so in code, accessing i+1 as 1+1=2, which is within the second character . \n\n So for Java's strings of length 2:\n\n when i is 1 \u2192 i+1 is 2 \u2192 charAt(2) \u2192 which is out of bounds (array index 1 only). Thus the code is erroneous. \n\n Wait this is a fundamental problem in the code. \n\n But since I'm to translate the given code, regardless of its possibly error, \n\n thus in the Fortran code, it must have strings length 3 to allow for the (i+1) up to 3 when i=1 (i=1 \u2192 +1 is 2 <3.\n\nAlternatively, the code must have string length 2, but the code will access position 2 (third character).\n\nThus in Fortran, the strings should be length 2.\n\nBut then, accessing third element would be out of bounds. The Fortran program would then throw an error.\n\nBut how can this be handled?\n\nPerhaps the problem requires the string inputs to be of length 3 and the Java code is designed for that.\n\nAssuming that the code as given in Java is correct for the problem it's solving, we must follow it. \n\nSo if the strings are of length 3, Fortran's array must be of length 3.\n\nThus the corrected code would be:\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: str(4)\n\nThen accesses:\n\nIn column is event's i (0,1). \n\nFor instance i=1 \u2192 column+1 is 2, column+2 is3 \u2192 okay. \n\n thus in the code:\n\nReplacing declarations to string length 3:\n\nSo that is part of the correct translation.\n\nThus the final code\uff0c must have the array of 3-character strings.\n\nThus the fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces287\n\n    implicit none\n\n    character(len=3) :: str(4)\n\n    integer :: uy, i, yes = 0\n\n    integer :: row1, row2, col \n\n    !
