Then, current size is 0. So yes, size <=b, so ans is t+d, then set q(1)=ans, and tail becomes 1. Next iteration, read next t and d.\n\nProcessing while loop: check head (which is 1), tail is1. So that first element is q(1). Check if q(1) <= current T. So this is the check. Proceeding. Wait yes, this seems correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads some input, processes it according to some logic involving queues, and then prints the results. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the Java code uses a Scanner to get inputs for n and b. Then, there's an array ans of long integers (so in Fortran, probably 8-byte integers or something similar). The LinkedList q is implemented as a deque here, since they use pollFirst and add to the end. \n\nThe main loop reads t and d for each of the n elements. Then there's a while loop removing elements from the front of the queue as long as they are <= t. Then, if the queue's size is less than or equal to b, the current ans[i] is set based on the last element of the queue plus d, or if the queue is empty, just t plus d. Then the new ans[i] is added to the queue. If the queue is already larger than b, then ans[i] gets -1.\n\nSo the first thing is figuring out how to implement a queue in Fortran. Since Java's LinkedList is a deque here, but in Fortran we need to manage it manually. Maybe use an array or a linked list structure? But Fortran isn't as flexible with dynamic structures. Alternatively, use a dynamic array approach where the front and end are tracked. Since the elements are added in order and removed from the front when expired, using an array with two indices: front and back? Or maybe a list that we can append to and check from the beginning when necessary. Wait, but for checking if the first elements are <= t, each time when processing a new t, you have to pop elements from the front until that's not true anymore.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to do it is to have an array that holds the queue elements. Since in Fortran arrays are static but we can use dynamic allocations or MODULE variables. Alternatively, I can track the elements of the queue in an array with a pointer to the current head and tail.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum size of the queue can't exceed n (since each element is added once and removed zero or once), maybe we can use an array of sufficient size, and track the current elements with a start and end pointer (like circular buffer approach?), or just track the elements in a linear array with a size variable.\n\nWait, in Java the queue starts empty and grows. The maximum size would be up to b+1? Because if the queue has exactly b, then adding another would make it b+1, so ans would be -1 in the else case. Wait, the condition is if q.size() <= b. So when the current queue size is less than or equal to b, you can add it. But when you add, the size increases to (previous size +1). So the maximum queue size can be up to b? Wait, wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, in the code, when we enter the if (q.size() <= b) block, then ans[i] is calculated and added to the queue, which increases the size. But if q is empty, then q.size() is 0, so adding it. The next element could check again whether q.size() is within the limit. But the logic used here must account correctly.\n\nWait, the code's logic is: when the current size is less than or equal to b, then we can add the new element. So the maximum allowed size after adding is b+1? Wait, no. Let's see: The condition says, if the queue size is (currently) <=b, then proceed to add. So after adding, the size becomes (current+1). Since 'current' was <= b, after adding becomes <=b+1. Wait, but if the current size is exactly b, then adding makes it b+1. So the maximum possible queue size after the addition is b+1? That could be a problem.\n\nWait the code's condition is written as if (q.size() <= b). So when the queue is size b, adding the new element will make it b+1? So the maximum queue size can be b+1. Wait but in that case, the problem statement might have some constraints such as b is sufficient. Maybe in the problem's context, the code is managing it correctly but I need to check the problem's description?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that there's a restriction that you cannot add if the queue is already at capacity of b. Like, if the queue size is equal to b, then you cannot add a new element, hence the else -1. Wait no, the code says 'if size <= b' then proceed. So, if size is already b, then adding is allowed, and then the queue becomes b+1, which is over the threshold?\n\nHmm that might be a mistake in the code logic or perhaps it's intended. Well, the task is to translate the code, not necessarily to fix it.\n\nAnyway, moving on. For the queue in Fortran, perhaps use an array. Let's see.\n\nIn Fortran, allocated arrays can be dynamic. So maybe we can use an allocatable array for the queue, with pointers indicating the current front and back? Or perhaps use a list approach with add and remove operations.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations are O(1) for first and last, perhaps we can implement a deque via an array, tracking start and end, along with the current size. For example:\n\nInitialize the array with some initial size (e.g., starting with 0 or n in size), and track the head and tail indices.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\n- The queue is a LinkedList, which is used as a deque. The operations used are offer (add to the end?), but in Java's LinkedList, add() adds to the end, and pollFirst removes from the front. getFirst and getLast get the elements at the front and end respectively.\n\nIn the code, the queue starts empty.\n\nProcessing each element:\n\nFirst, the while loop removes all elements <= t from the front. So the queue is processed from the front, removing until the first element is > t.\n\nThen, if the current size (after trimming and removing, but after the while loop) is <=b, then we compute ans[i] as either (last element +d) or (t +d) if empty, then add to the queue. Else, it can't be added so ans is -1.\n\nSo for the queue in Fortran, perhaps we need to use an array, and track the current elements with an array, with the current elements in the array, and the start index for the head.\n\nLet me think of an approach. Let me think of starting by declaring an array, say, q(1:n), to hold the elements. Since the maximum possible elements in the queue is n (since each element is added once). But perhaps we can use an array of size up to n.\n\nInitialize the queue's head and tail indices. Let start from head=1, tail=0 (empty). Then:\n\nTo check if empty, head > tail.\n\nAdding an element would be:\n\ntail = tail +1; q(tail) = new_val.\n\nRemoving the first element would set head= head +1 (the index moves forward, but perhaps manage elements more carefully).\n\nWait, but with this approach, the elements are stored in the array sequentially, and when we remove from the front (head moves forward), elements before are discarded, but remain in the array, but next elements are added after.\n\nWait, but that's only applicable if we process elements in order. So when the while loop is supposed to remove elements from the front (i.e., the first element in the current queue), that's exactly the first element of the current stored ones.\n\nHmm. For example:\n\nSuppose the queue's elements are stored in q with indices from head to tail.\n\nSo when we pollFirst (the front element is q(head)). So when removing, we can advance head by 1. The available elements will be from next head onward up to tail.\n\nSimilarly, adding adds to the end (tail = tail+1 and q(tail) is the new element. \n\nSo yes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo with this structure, the queue can be represented by the q array, and the head and tail pointers. When the queue is empty, head > tail.\n\nThe first element is q(head), last is q(tail). The size is tail-head+1. Because (tail - head + 1) is the count.\n\nWait, for example, if head =1, tail =3, then the elements are at 1,2,3, so 3 elements. 3-1+1 =3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's a way. So let me set up that. Let me think how to implement the Java code in Fortran.\n\nFirst, read n and b. The answer array is of size n, each an 8-byte integer (since Java uses long, in Fortran we can use integer(8)).\n\nThe queue is stored in an array, let's say called queue, of size n. Amax possible size is n, perhaps. Then the head and tail indices are variables, say head=1, tail=0 to start.\n\nThe steps in each iteration:\n\nFirst, read t and d.\n\nThen process the while loop:\n\nWhile the queue is not empty, and the first element <= t:\n\n   remove the first element: we increment head until the first element is > t.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, how?\n\nWait, the first element is q(head). To remove, advance head by one (so head = head+1 now points to the next first element).\n\nWait, the while loop would keep doing this as long as there are elements (head <= tail) and the current head's element is <= t.\n\nSo in pseudocode for the loop:\n\nwhile (head <= tail) and (q(head) <= t):\n\n   head = head +1\n\nWait, that's exactly what the code was doing in Java. So that would handle the while loop.\n\nOnce that loop is done, then check the current size (tail - head +1) <= b ?\n\nWait in Java, after trimming, the queue's size is checked. Then, if that's <=b, then process.\n\nWait the current size after the while loop is (tail - head +1).\n\nSo if ( (tail - head +1) ) <= b \u2192 can proceed to add.\n\nWait, but in the original code:\n\nAfter trimming, the existing elements are all > t. Then, the new element's ans[i] is computed.\n\nSo the new ans[i] is either (q.getLast() +d) if queue is not empty, otherwise t +d.\n\nThen, the new ans[i] is added to the queue, so tail will be incremented and the element stored at tail.\n\nWait, so adding that element would increase the size by 1 (so the new size is (tail - head +1) +1. Wait, because when we add, tail becomes tail +1, and then it's stored at that index.\n\nWait in this array system, when we add, tail is increased by one, and then we write there. So the current size (tail - head +1) plus one?\n\nWait let me think again: current size is tail - head +1. \n\nIf the current size is <= b, then the new element can be added. After adding, size will be (current size +1). So if before adding size was exactly b, then after becomes b+1, but the condition was based on the size before adding. So the code allows adding when current size before adding is \u2264 b. The new size can go over b, but the next iteration will check again.\n\nWait perhaps the code had a mistake here, but since we have to translate it, that's part of the translation.\n\nProceeding.\n\nSo in Fortran code steps:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nDeclaration:\n\n  - declare variables. Like variables n, b:\n\n      integer :: n, b\n\n  - For the answer array, in Java it's long, so:\n\n      integer(8) :: ans(n)\n\n  - Queue array of size n:\n\n      integer(8), allocatable :: q(:)\n\n  But wait since we can preallocate. Let's say allocate it to n elements (since maximum elements can't exceed n, right? Each t comes in, and each is processed):\n\nso allocate(q(n))\n\nAlternatively, hardcoded as a fixed size array. Let's use an array dimensioned as n, since the problem input is 'n' elements.\n\nSo declare:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:), allocatable, target :: q ! but do we need pointer?\n\nWait, let's start by dimension.\n\nIt's easier perhaps with:\n\ninteger(8) :: q(n)\n\nBut in Fortran the dimensions have to be fixed at compile time, but since n is read from input, maybe we need to read n first.\n\nHmm. Hmm, so in Fortran, we can have arrays allocated dynamically, so perhaps allocate after reading n.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the code structure.\n\nThe program:\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Read n and b.\n\n- Allocate the queue array to size n.\n\n- Initialize head =1, tail=0.\n\n- Read the next elements: in a loop over i from 1 to n:\n\n        read t and d.\n\n        process the queue: remove elements from front until first element > t (the while loop).\n\n        compute size = tail - head +1\n\n        if size <= b:\n\n            if queue is empty (head > tail):\n\n                the previous would be t\n\n            else:\n\n                previous = q(tail)\n\n            ans(i) = previous + d\n\n            set tail to tail+1 and q(tail)=ans(i)\n\n        else:\n\n            ans(i) = -1\n\nWait, not exactly. Wait the ans[i] is set to (if empty: t+d; else, the last element (q(tail)) +d. Because the current queue's last element is q(tail).\n\nWait yes. Because when we added the previous element, the tail is at the position where that element is stored.\n\nSo for the ans calculation:\n\ncompute:\n\nif (head > tail) then:\n\n    ans(i) = t +d\n\nelse:\n\n    ans(i) = q(tail) + d\n\nthen, proceed to add this new ans(i):\n\n   tail = tail +1\n\n   q(tail)=ans(i)\n\nthe problem is that in FORTRAN, arrays are 1-based.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, the head starts at 1 and tail at 0, so when the first element is added, tail becomes 1. When the queue is emptied (head moves past tail), head becomes 2, tail is 0, or is that?\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nInitially, head=1, tail=0. So the first element's insertion:\n\nAfter reading t and d, after processing the while loop (which does not run because queue is empty). Then, since the size is 0 (so 0 <=b), proceed.\n\nThus, ans(1)=t+d. Then tail becomes 1. Then the queue is from head=1 to 1, so first is at 1.\n\nYes, works.\n\nNow, implementing in Fortran.\n\nSo here's how:\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: n, b, i\n\ninteger(8) :: ans(n)\n\ninteger(8) :: q(n)\n\nAlso, we need head and tail variables:\n\ninteger :: head=1, tail=0\n\nWait since they have to be integers. Start with head=1 and tail=0.\n\nThe main loop:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n    read *, t, d  ! But variables...\n\nWait, in Fortran declare the variables.\n\nWait let me structure the code.\n\nWe need to have variables for t and d per loop step.\n\nHave variables for t and d.\n\nSo declaring t and d as variables.\n\nSo top:\n\nprogram codeforces_644_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, b\n\ninteger :: head=1, tail=0\n\ninteger(8), dimension( : ), allocatable :: q\n\ninteger(8) :: ans( : ), temp Ans?\n\n\nWait no, perhaps better to have t & d as temporary variables inside the loop. Wait in Java, t and d are declared in the loop, but in Fortran they can be declared in the top part.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, b\n\ninteger :: i, head, tail\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: q(:), ans(:)\n\ninteger(8) :: t, d, current_q_size\n\n!

Main loop.\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n    read *, t, d\n\n    ! remove from front as long as first element <= t\n\n    ! first, check while head<=tail AND q(head) <=t:\n\n    do while( head <= tail .and. q(head) <= t )\n\n        head = head +1\n\n    end do\n\n    ! check if the current size after this <= b.\n\n    current_q_size = tail - head +1  ! yes, (tail - head +1)\n\n    if ( current_q_size <= b ) then\n\n        if ( current_q_size ==0 ) then\n\n            ! queue empty, previous is -1, so t +d.\n\n            ans(i) = t +d\n\n        else\n\n            ans(i) = q( tail ) +d\n\n        endif\n\n        ! add to queue.\n\n        tail = tail +1\n\n        q(tail) = ans(i)\n\n    else \n\n        ans(i) = -1\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\n! Output results\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n    write(*, '(I0,X)', advance='no') ans(i)\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*)  ! new line.\n\ndeallocate(q, ans)\n\nend program\n\nWait but I see an issue here. The q array is being modified every time. Because initially, the program processes all the elements step by step, but for each i, we need to read the next t, d and process the queue.\n\nWait this code should work, but wait in the first iteration, the queue is initialized as head=1, tail=0.\n\nFirst read t and d.\n\nThen the while loop checks for (head<=tail (0) etc.), which is false. Then, current size is 0.\n\nSo yes, size <=b, so ans is t+d, then set q(1)=ans, and tail becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration, read next t and d.\n\nProcessing while loop: check head (which is 1), tail is1. So that first element is q(1). Check if q(1) <= current T. So this is the check.\n\nProceeding.\n\nWait yes, this seems correct.\n\nWait but in Fortran arrays are 1-based, so q is dimensioned as size n, so the first element is q(1). Yes.\n\nWait the only problem is, when the queue becomes full, but when adding to the tail would exceed the array dimension? For example, the q array is n in size, so as long as the number of elements in the queue never exceeds n, it's okay. However, in the original code, since each time an element is added, it's pushed into the queue, and each arrival has exactly one element added (or not, if not -1). So the number of elements in the queue can be up to the total number of arrivals, but maybe there are cases where the elements are not all added: for instance, when the current queue size exceeds b, so ans is set to -1 and not added to the queue. Thus, the queue can have up to n elements (if all were allowed and didn't get removed). Wait, but in the worst case, even every element is added, so the size could be n. Which fits the array size.\n\nThus, the allocation of size N is correct.\n\nWait, that might be okay.\n\nWait but perhaps when the queue has too many elements, but the WHILE loop removes some from the front. So maximum elements is n? Even so, the queue array of size N is okay.\n\nThus, this code should be okay.\n\nWait let me check variable declarations:\n\nThe variables:\n\n- main variables: n, b, i, head, tail are declared as integers.\n\n- q is allocated as 8-byte integers with n elements.\n\nWait, I think so.\n\nWait the code declares:\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: q(:), ans(:)\n\nWait in the code above, I see the code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, b\n\ninteger :: i, head, tail\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: q(:), ans(:)\n\ninteger(8) :: t, d, current_q_size\n\nread *, n, b\n\nallocate(q(n), ans(n))\n\nThen proceed.\n\nWait the variables are correct.\n\nWait wait the current_q_size is an integer (needs to be integer, since it's the size).\n\nYes, it's okay.\n\nWait I think this code should work.\n\nTesting cases.\n\nLet me test a small example.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nLet\u2019s say n=1, b=0.\n\nInput will be t and d.\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\nn=1, b=0\n\nThen the first (and only) test case:\n\nt=5, d=3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitial head=1, tail=0.\n\nAfter reading t=5, d=3.\n\nCheck while loop: head is 1, which is > tail (0). Skip.\n\nCurrent_q size is 0.\n\n0 <=0 (since b=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nAdd: since current size 0 is empty:\n\nans(1)=5+3=8.\n\nAdd to queue: tail becomes 1, q(1)=8.\n\nThen, the output will be 8 \u2192 printed.\n\nAnother test case: if b is sufficient.\n\nSuppose n=2, b=1:\n\nSuppose input is n=2, b=1.\n\nFirst process for i=1:\n\nt=3, d=2.\n\nAfter processing, the q has head=1, tail=1. ans is 5.\n\nSize after is 1.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nLet\u2019s say t=4, d=1.\n\nProcessing while loop. Check first element is q(1)=5.\n\nIs 5 <= 4? No. So loop not entered.\n\ncurrent_q_size is 1-1+1=1 <=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nans(2)=q(1)=5 +1 =6 \u2192 add to queue. tail becomes 2.\n\nSize now becomes 2. \n\nWait, but then if the next line would check, but since it\u2019s allowed, yes?\n\nWait the next step, if adding, the current size was 1 (before adding) which is <=b of 1.\n\nThus, adding is allowed.\n\nThus, after adding, the queue now has 1 (5) and 2 (6). \n\nWhen the queue increases to 2 (size is 2), for the next iteration.\n\nWait but for that next i=2, it's all correct.\n\nOkay, seems okay.\n\nAnother test case where the queue exceeds capacity.\n\nSuppose n=3, b=0.\n\nThe first entry is added, but maybe the second cannot.\n\nExample:\n\nn=3, b=0.\n\nCase:\n\nInput lines after n and b:\n\n1 2 \u2192 t=1, d=2 \u2192 ans is 3. queue has 3. size=1? no wait.\n\nWait after first iteration:\n\nQueue: q(1)=3 (since head=1, tail=1). \n\nNow for the second entry:\n\nsuppose t=2, d=5.\n\nThe first while loop: check q(1)=3 is head <= tail? yes, 1<=1. The first's value 3 is > current t=2 \u2192 so the while condition (q(head) <= t) ?\n\nYes, 3 <=2? No. Thus, loop doesn\u2019t execute.\n\nSo current_q_size is 1 (head=1, tail=1 \u2192 1).\n\nThe b is 0. So 1 (current_q_size) is >0 \u2192 so ans is -1.\n\nThus that second element would have ans[i]=-1.\n\nThus, third element can maybe add again? The queue can have only one element.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the second element's answer is -1.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nThus, translating code the fortran code I wrote should work.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nWait need to make sure variables are properly declared.\n\nWait variables like t and d are needed inside the loop. I think in the code above, they should be declared outside, like in the main block.\n\nThe code is okay.\n\nProbably the code written is correct.\n\nWait but I also need to note that the 'while' loop in the Java was a loop to remove until firstElement exceeds t. The Fortran code uses a do while loop, which should have the same effect.\n\nWait the Java code loops while ( !q.isEmpty() && q.getFirst() <=t ) , removing the first element.\n\nIn the fortran code:\n\nWe keep a head pointer. The while loop is while ( head <= tail ) (which is checking if not empty) AND q(head) <=t --> do the loop.\n\nInside the loop, head is incremented, moving past the first element.\n\nThus, the same as removing the first element.\n\nYes.\n\nHence, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the Fortran code, after the computation of ans(i), when adding to 'q' in the tail, must ensure that the queue is filled correctly.\n\nThe tail is initially 0, so when we add first element, tail becomes 1, and q(1)=ans(1).\n\nYes.\n\nThus I think this code will work.\n\nNow converting all that into Fortran code properly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the write statement for the answer must print space separated numbers, with a trailing space, but the problem might expect a space at the end.\n\nThe loop can be written as:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n    write (unit=*, fmt='(I0, 1X)', advance='no') ans(i)\n\nend do\n\nwrite(*,*)  \n\nThat way, after the first loop, each number is written with a space, and the final write ends the line. Alternatively, use 'advance' to keep on the same line. Alternatively, in the loop, use '(I0, \" \")', but might vary in format.\n\nAlternatively, in some Fortran versions, you can write all in one call:\n\nwrite(*,'(100000(I0,1X))') ans(1:n)\n\nBut that might not be better.\n\nAlternatively, see that in the code, after the loop is done, you can:\n\ndo i =1,n\n\n    print *, ans(i)\n\nend do\n\nBut that would print each on separate lines. So the proper way is to print all in a single line with spaces between.\n\nA standard way is to use:\n\nwrite(*, '(10000(I0,1X)/)') (ans(i), i=1,n)\n\nThe format 10000 items, each I0 followed by a space, and then a new line.\n\nAlternatively, a loop with no advance, then a new line.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n   do i=1,n\n\n       write(*,'(I0, X)', advance='no') ans(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   write(*,*)  ! to move to next line.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran 2008, the 'advance' option is allowed.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWait need to make sure the code properly allocates q and the ans array. Since we read n first. The code above allocates q and ans to size n. In Fortran, allocate(q(n)), which is okay as n is read first.\n\nSo here is the code:\n\nNote that in the original Java code the elements are 1-based, but the arrays in for do match that.\n\nWait note that in Fortran, loop variables are from 1 to n.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThus the fortran code would be as given above:\n\nHere's the code:\n\nprogram codeforces_644_B\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, b, i, head, tail\n  integer(8), allocatable :: ans(:), q(:)\n  integer(8) :: t, d, current_q_size\n\n  ! Read n and b\n  read(*,*) n, b\n\n  ! Allocate arrays\n  allocate(q(n), ans(n))\n\n  head = 1\n  tail = 0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) t, d\n\n    ! Remove elements from front until the first element > t\n    do while (head <= tail .and. q(head) <= t)\n      head = head + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Compute current queue size\n    current_q_size = tail - head + 1\n\n    if (current_q_size <= b) then\n      ! Can add the current element to the queue\n      if (current_q_size == 0) then\n        ans(i) = t + d\n      else\n        ans(i) = q(tail) + d\n      end if\n      ! Add to queue\n      tail = tail + 1\n      q(tail) = ans(i)\n    else\n      ans(i) = -1\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Print results with space separation\n  do i = 1, n\n    write(*, \"(I0, 1X)\", advance='no') ans(i)\n  end do\n  write(*, *)  ! Add a newline at the end\n  deallocate(q, ans)\n\nend program\n\n\nWait this should be the correct fortran code.\n\nNow check some syntax details.\n\n- The 'do while' loops in Fortran can be written as:\n\ndo while (condition)\n\n  ...\n\nend do\n\nYes.\n\n- The head and tail are of type integer. The 'current_q_size' should also be integer because it's (tail-head +1), which could be up to n.\n\n- The arrays q and ans are properly allocated.\n\n- The read statement uses 'read(*,*)', which is fine.\n\n- The writing: in the do loop over i from 1 to n for the output, each element is written with 'I0' and '1X' spacing. 'I0' prints the number without leading spaces, but in some cases maybe using '(g0)' but I0 is okay for integers. The advance='no' keeps the output on the same line.\n\n- The final 'write(*, *)' prints a new line.\n\nWait the trailing space is preserved because the last element is printed with a space. The judge might accept it. In Java code, the original code also does System.out.print(ans[i] + \" \"), which adds a space at the end. So the Fortran code would do the same.\n\nYes. \n\nThus, this should be the correct translation."
