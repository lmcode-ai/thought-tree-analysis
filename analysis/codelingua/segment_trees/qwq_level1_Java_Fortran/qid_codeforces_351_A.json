    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads an integer n, then reads 2n numbers. It calculates some values based on those numbers and outputs a result with three decimal places.\n\nFirst, let's parse the structure. The main method reads input using a BufferedReader, then processes the numbers. The variables include a count of non-integer numbers (non_int), the sum_before which is the actual sum of all numbers, and the sum which is the sum of the floor of each number. Then they compute max_sum and min_sum, and finally determine the answer based on the sum_before versus those sums.\n\nNow, converting this to Fortran. Fortran uses different syntax and data types. For instance, arrays in Fortran are declared with dimensions, and input is usually handled via read statements.\n\nThe first thing to note is getting input. In Java, they read using a BufferedReader, but in Fortran we can use read(*,*) to read from standard input. For the first line, n is read as an integer. The second line has 2n numbers, but since 2*n might be big, we need to declare an array of that size.\n\nWait, in Java, the size is 2 * n, which is stored as an array called arr. In Fortran, the array declaration should be for 2*n elements, but since Fortran's arrays are fixed size at compile time, perhaps n needs to be read before the array is declared. However, in modern Fortran we can use allocatable arrays. So maybe using an allocatable array is better here.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nRead n first. Then allocate an array of size 2*n. Then read the next elements into the array.\n\nWait, but the input for the array comes in a single line. So in Fortran, we need to read a line with 2n numbers separated by whitespace. Alternatively, the input can be read token by token. Since in Java StringTokenizer is used, perhaps in Fortran each number can be read in a loop. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using list-directed input. For example, read an array of 2*n elements from the next line.\n\nHmm, perhaps:\n\nRead n. Then read the rest of the line? Or next line. The problem with Java code is that the first read is br.readLine() for n, then another readLine for the next numbers (tokenized via StringTokenizer).\n\nSo in Fortran, the first integer is read via read(*,*) n. Then, for the next line, need to read 2*n numbers. But how? Since Fortran can handle reading a line. Alternatively, read all the numbers in one line.\n\nWait, the second line is the tokens, which StringTokenizer splits. So in Fortran:\n\nAfter getting n, allocate an array of size 2*n.\n\nThen, read that many numbers from the next line. Maybe do:\n\nallocate(arr(1:2*n))\n\nThen, read a line and then read the elements into the array. Or, just directly read using read(*,*) arr.\n\nYes, probably the latter is easier. Because in Fortran, if you have an array arr(2*n), you can read all elements in one read statement.\n\nWait, but when n is known after being read, then perhaps using an allocatable array is necessary because the size depends on n.\n\nSo pseudo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate an array of size 2*n as double precision (or real numbers)\n\nThen, read the next 2*n numbers into the array.\n\nProceed with variables.\n\nWait, converting all the variables:\n\nnon_int is an integer, since it's counting how many numbers are not integers.\n\nsum_before is real (double in Java, but Fortran real can be double precision with kind parameters, but for transliteration, perhaps just use real.\n\nIn Fortran, the floor function is floor() and returns an integer, but since we are dealing with real numbers, maybe floor for real (like floor(3.2) would give 3.0, so in Fortran we'd cast to integer or use the proper function.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the floor function for reals can be used, and the intrinsic function is floor(). Its return is a real kind, but maybe not. Let me check. Wait, in Fortran, floor(a) returns the largest integer <= a as a real number of the same kind as a. So for example, floor(3.2) is 3.0, which is a real. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, they use Math.floor(num) which returns a double. So sum += Math.floor(num) which is a double. So in Fortran, if sum is real, adding the floor which is real is fine.\n\nWait, in Java sum is declared as double sum = 0. So in Fortran, variables like sum can be declared as real.\n\nNon_int is an integer. sum_before is a real (double in Java), same as Java's sum.\n\nThen the code proceeds as follows.\n\nSo steps after initial variables:\n\nLoop over all the elements in the array:\n\nfor each element i from 1 to 2*n:\n\nread the number (actually, they are already in the array). Wait, the loop in Java is for (int i=0 to 2n-1)\n\nWait in Java the loop is 0-based, but in Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based ( unless declared with 0). So, the loop in Fortran will iterate from 1 to 2*n.\n\nWait, but in the code, the Java arr is in 0-based, so 2n elements. In Fortran, if the array is declared with allocate(arr(2*n)), it's 1-based or 1 to 2*n? No, in Fortran when you allocate an array, you can set the lower bound. By default, Fortran uses 1-based indices.\n\nHmm, so for loops in Fortran would be from 1 to 2*n.\n\nNow, in the loop:\n\nsum_before += arr(i)\n\nthen check if num (arr(i)) is not equal to floor(arr(i)). Since Math.floor(num) in java returns a double, so if the number is an integer, like 5.0, then it's equal. If it has a fractional part, then not. Non-int variables are those numbers that are not integers.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (arr(i) .ne. floor(arr(i))) then\n\nnon_int = non_int +1\n\nend if\n\nThen sum += floor(arr(i)), so sum = sum + floor(arr(i)) ?\n\nYes.\n\nThen after the loop:\n\nCompute max_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n\nWait in Java: max_sum is the minimum between n and non_int, then added to sum.\n\nWait the min function here is between n and non_int?\n\nThe code says: max_sum = Math.min(n, non_int) + sum;\n\nWait why? Let me see what the logic is. The comment might help, but not provided, so need to see.\n\nThe code may be trying to determine some upper and lower sums. Let me run through an example.\n\nSuppose n =2, 2n elements (say 4 elements). Then non_int counts how many of those are non-integer. The max_sum would be sum of all the floored numbers, plus the maximum number of non-integer (but limited to n). Maybe it's for the maximum possible rounding? Not sure, but in code, the expressions are direct.\n\nSo in Fortran, using min(n, non_int). Since min in Java is a function, in Fortran it's min(a,b).\n\nThen the assignment is straightforward. Similarly for min_sum: Math.max(0, non_int -n) + sum. That's max(0, ...). So in Fortran: max(0, non_int -n).\n\nThese are standard functions.\n\nThen, the if-else logic:\n\nif min_sum > sum_before: then ans = min_sum - sum_before.\n\nElse if max_sum < sum_before: ans is sum_before - max_sum.\n\nElse compute x = fractional part of sum_before and take the minimal of x and 1-x.\n\nWait, sum_before is the actual sum, and we're comparing with the possible range between min_sum and max_sum? So if the actual sum is outside of those extremes, the answer is how much it differs. If it's in between, then maybe the minimal fractional part?\n\nHmm, but the code proceeds to compute the fractional part. Let me see.\n\nThe fractional part x is sum_before - floor(sum_before). So that x is between [0,1). For example, if sum_before is 5.3, x is 0.3. Then the minimal between 0.3 (that's x) or 0.7 (1 -0.3). So the answer is 0.3, which would be the minimal distance to the nearest integer?\n\nYes. So the code computes the difference between the actual sum_before and the closest integer, but only when it's within the allowed range.\n\nNow, in Fortran:\n\nx = sum_before - floor(sum_before)\n\nans = min(1.0 - x, x)\n\nSo, in code, the equivalent statements.\n\nNow, the output. The printf with 3 decimals: in Fortran, using print statement with format specifier. For example:\n\nprint '(F8.3)', ans\n\nWait but maybe precise formatting. Original Java uses \"%.3f\". So in Fortran, the format descriptor would be something like F5.3, but with enough places. Alternatively, just using the format 'F10.3' to have three decimal digits.\n\nAlternatively, using a format like '(G0.3F)', but maybe the best is F12.3 or similar to ensure 3 decimals.\n\nNow let me structure all of this in Fortran.\n\nFirst, declare variables. Since Fortran variables need to be declared before using.\n\nProgramsto declare variables:\n\nprogram codeforces_351A\n\nImplicit None\n\nInteger :: n, non_int, i\nReal(kind=8) :: sum_before, sum, max_sum, min_sum, ans, x\nReal(kind=8), Dimension(:), Allocatable :: arr\n\nThen, reading n:\n\nRead(*,*) n\n\nAllocate(arr(2*n))  -- but here in Fortran, 2*n is computed, and since it's an array of size 2*n\n\nThen, read the next line's elements into arr. The reading is done via a single read statement?\n\nAssuming the next line has exactly 2*n numbers, separated by spaces. So read *, arr(1:2*n)\n\nWait, when you do read *, arr, it will read all the numbers until it has enough for the array. So after n is read, and the array is allocated, the next read statement would read 2n numbers from standard input.\n\nWait, but Java has two separate readLines: one for n and another for the token. So in Fortran:\n\nFirst line: read *, n\n\nSecond line: read *, (arr(i), i = 1, 2*n)\n\nAlternatively, read * into arr.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nAfter allocating arr, then:\n\nRead(*,*) (arr(i),i=1, 2*n)\n\nYes, that should read all elements into arr.\n\nThen, initialize variables:\n\nnon_int = 0\n\nsum_before = 0.0d0\n\nsum = 0.0d0\n\nLoop over all elements:\n\nDo i = 1, 2*n\n\n   num = arr(i)\n\n   sum_before = sum_before + num\n\n   if (num .ne. floor(num) ) then\n\n      non_int = non_int +1\n\n   end if\n\n   sum = sum + floor(num)\n\nEnd do\n\nWait, but in Java, they stored the num in a variable for each step. Since in Fortran, we can directly use arr(i) each time.\n\nWait, but in the code we'll need to use each element of arr. So the loop is straightforward.\n\nThen:\n\nmax_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n\nWait, here in Fortran, min between integer n and integer non_int.\n\nWait in Fortran, \"min\" is a function: min(n, non_int)\n\nBut in the code above, sum is of type real. Wait, the left side (max_sum) must be real. Because min(n, non_int) will be an integer, but adding to sum (real) would give a real. Since Fortran will automatically type conversion?\n\nWait no, in Fortran, mixing integers and real in an expression will coerce to real, but need to be cautious. So perhaps better to cast the min and max expressions to real.\n\nAlternatively, just let the compiler handle it. So:\n\nmax_sum = real( min(n, non_int) ) + sum\n\nWait to ensure min is treated as integer. Alternatively, is better to compute min_val as integer: maybe split the steps:\n\ninteger :: min_val, max_val\n\nmin_val = min(n, non_int)\n\nmax_sum = real(min_val) + sum\n\nSimilarly for the max in the min_sum calculation:\n\nthe non_int - n can be negative, so taking max(0, ... ), so:\n\nmax_val = max(0, non_int -n )\n\nthen min_sum = real(max_val) + sum\n\nAlternatively, directly compute in expressions.\n\nWait, let me see the code again:\n\nmax_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n\nBut the sum is a real. min(n, non_int) is integer, so the integer added to real gives a real.\n\nSimilarly, in min_sum: (non_int - n) could be negative. The max between 0 and (non_int -n) is integer, so converted to real.\n\nHmm, but in Fortran:\n\nIf (non_int -n) is negative, then max(0, non_int -n) is 0.\n\nSo:\n\nmin_sum = max(0, non_int -n) + sum\n\nThus, in code:\n\nmax_sum = real( min( n, non_int ) ) + sum\n\nmin_sum = real( max(0, non_int -n) ) + sum\n\nHm, but in the code, in Java it's:\n\nmax_sum is Math.min(n, non_int) (which is integer) + sum (sum is a double, so the addition is double.)\n\nIn Fortran, min(n, non_int) returns an integer. Adding an integer to a real, the integer is promoted to real, so okay.\n\nSo no need to cast explicitly. So code can be written as:\n\nmax_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n\nSimilarly for min_sum = max(0, non_int - n) + sum\n\nNow proceed.\n\nThen the if conditions:\n\nIf ( min_sum > sum_before ) then\n\n   ans = min_sum - sum_before\n\nelse if (max_sum < sum_before) then\n\n   ans = sum_before - max_sum\n\nElse\n\n   x = sum_before - floor( sum_before )\n\n   ans = min( 1.0d0 - x, x )\n\nendif\n\nFinally, printing with three decimal places.\n\nFortran requires knowing how many digits in the field. The format should be of the form F12.3 or similar. Using a format:\n\nprint '(F12.3)', ans\n\nWait, but the Java code uses printf with 3 decimals, so any width. So maybe using F9.3 or sufficient. Let's choose a width of 6 or 10 to avoid truncating.\n\nWait:\n\nTesting if ans can be up to maybe 1.0? Because the else clause is when the sum is between min_sum and max_sum. Then x is between 0 and 1, so ans is between 0 and 0.5.\n\nIn the first two cases, answer is the difference between sum and min_sum (could be up to min_sum - sum_before, but not sure). For example, if min_sum is 10.0 and sum_before is 8.0, then ans is 2.0, which would be printed as 2.000. So taking 6 digits with 3 decimals: F6.3 requires values up to 99.999. If holding 2, then 2.000 is 5 characters (including decimal). Using F9.3 would allow more.\n\nAlternatively, use the format F12.3 which should accommodate any possible number. Alternatively, use G option or let the compiler decide with a generic format. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the code uses .3 digits, so using something like:\n\nprint *, ans\n\nBut that would print 2.0 as 2.000? No, because the print *, will default to whatever, but perhaps we need to format to 3 decimal places.\n\nAlternatively using D or E notation but not sure. The safest is to use a format:\n\nwrite(*, '(F10.3)') ans\n\nSo in code:\n\nwrite(*, '(f10.3)') ans\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nWait also note that in Fortran real(numbers) are double precision here, because of kind=8. So when declaring variables with Real(kind=8) then that should be okay. Make sure floor is applied properly.\n\nWait, but in Fortran the floor function for real(kind=8) is fine.\n\nWait, testing:\n\nExample:\n\nWhen arr is 1.2, floor(1.2) would be 1.0d0 (double precision).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting the code together.\n\nPossible program:\n\nprogram codeforces_351A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, non_int, i\n  real(kind=8) :: sum_before, sum, max_sum, min_sum, ans, x\n  real(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  allocate(arr(2*n))\n\n  read(*,*) (arr(i), i=1, 2*n)\n\n  non_int = 0\n  sum_before = 0.0d0\n  sum = 0.0d0\n\n  do i = 1, 2*n\n     sum_before = sum_before + arr(i)\n     if (arr(i) /= floor(arr(i))) non_int = non_int + 1\n     sum = sum + floor(arr(i))\n  end do\n\n  max_sum = min(n, non_int) + sum\n  min_sum = max(0, non_int - n) + sum\n\n  if (min_sum > sum_before) then\n     ans = min_sum - sum_before\n  else if (max_sum < sum_before) then\n     ans = sum_before - max_sum\n  else\n     x = sum_before - floor(sum_before)\n     ans = min(1.0d0 - x, x)\n  end if\n\n  write(*, '(f10.3)') ans\n\n  deallocate(arr)\nend program\n\nWait, need to make sure that all variables are properly declared, all steps included, and the deallocation.\n\nWait, also, in the else clause for the x, the floor of sum_before is correct?\n\nYes, because the floor function is applied again there. For example, sum_before could be 3.1, then floor is 3. subtract gives 0.1, so x is 0.1, the minimal between that and 0.9.\n\nWait but the formula is correct.\n\nTesting for example case:\n\nSuppose n=1, and the numbers are 0.5,0.5, 0.5, 0.5.\n\n2n is 4 elements here. Then non_int is 4, because each is 0.5.\n\nsum is floor(0.5)*4 = 4*0 =0? Each term floor is 0. So sum is 0.\n\nmax_sum = min(1, 4) + 0 \u2192 1 + 0 =1.\n\nmin_sum is max(0, 4-1) =3 \u2192 3 +0 =3. But sum_before is the actual sum: 0.5 *4 = 2.0.\n\nCompare min_sum (3) and max_sum(1). The actual sum is 2, which is between 1 and3. So enter else clause.\n\nThen x = 2.0 - floor(2.0) \u2192 0.0 (since 2.0 is integer). Thus, the minimal between 1.0-0.0 and 0.0 \u2192 0.0. So the answer would be 0.000.\n\nWhich is correct, because the sum is exactly 2, which can be achieved by choosing the right number of non-integers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps my example is simple. But code should handle this.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nIf the sum is beyond the min_sum. For example, suppose n=2, the numbers are all 2.0. Then non_int=0. So maxsum would be min(2,0) + sum_of_floor (each is 2.0, so 4 elements, sum becomes 8? Wait 2*2 elements (assuming n=2, 2n is 4.\n\nWait let me take n=1 (so 2 elements):\n\nExample n is 1 (and 2n elements). Suppose two numbers are 0.7 and 0.7. So:\n\nsum_before is 1.4.\n\nnon_int = 2 (both are non-integer).\n\nsum would be floor(0.7) + floor(0.7) \u2192 0 each. So sum =0.\n\nmax_sum is min(1,2) \u21921 \u2192 so 0+1 =1.\n\nmin_sum is max(0, 2-1) \u21921 \u21920+1=1.\n\nSum_before (1.4) is between 1 and 1? No, min_sum and max_sum are same here. Wait, sum of 1.4. The min and max are both 1?\n\nWait min_sum = max(0, 2-1)=1 \u2192 1 + sum (0 \u2192 1).\n\nmax_sum = min(1,2) is1, so 1 +0 is1. So min_sum and max_sum are both 1, and sum_before is 1.4. So min_sum is 1 < 1.4, so it would go to the else case.\n\nWait but in this case, since 1.4 is between 1 (min(max_sum)) and 1 (max), but since min_sum was 1 and max_sum was 1 (because non_int > n in the maximum?), no.\n\nWait in this case, when non_int is 2 and n is 1:\n\nmax_sum is min(1,2) \u21921 added to sum (which is 0) \u2192total 1.\n\nmin_sum is max(0, 2 -1) \u21921 added to sum (0) \u21921.\n\nSo their values are equal (1). The sum_before is 1.4, which is greater than max_sum (1) \u2192 entering the second condition (else if):\n\nsince max_sum < sum? yes (1 <1.4). Thus ans is 1.4-1 =0.4 \u2192 answer is 0.4.\n\nWait, but according to the code, it would use the second condition. That's the correct approach here.\n\nHence the code handles that.\n\nThus the Fortran code must correctly handle all those variables.\n\nAnother thing to check: the array allocation and deallocation. The allocate(arr(2*n)), and then after processing, deallocate to free memory. Good practice.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote, yes there is a deallocate(arr) before the end program.\n\nSo that should be okay.\n\nNow, in Fortran, array indices are 1-based so the code should work.\n\nAnother possible bug: in the initial loop in Java, the loop is for (int i=0 to 2*n-1), but in Fortran it loops from 1 to 2*n: same count, just different starting index. That's okay.\n\nThe rest of code follows.\n\nThus the translated code should work.\n\nTesting edge case like when non_int equals n, or other situations.\n\nThus I think the code is correct.\n\nThe final Fortran code should look like this."
