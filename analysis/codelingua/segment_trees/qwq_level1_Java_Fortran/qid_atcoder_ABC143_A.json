    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code does. The main thing it does is read two integers from the user, compute c as a - b*2, then set c to 0 if it's negative, and print c.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, how do I read input? Oh right, usually with read(*,*) statement. But since the input is from standard input, maybe using something like read(*,*) a, b would be straightforward. Wait, but in Java they split the input line by spaces, so the user enters something like \"5 3\" and splits into two parts. So in Fortran, the same approach would be to read two integers from the same line.\n\nWait, the Java code uses BufferedReader to read a line, then splits into an array, then parses each part. So the Fortran code should read a line with two integers, probably using list-directed input. So the Fortran code can just read a and b directly from the input line. So the input would be like: user enters two numbers separated by space, and the Fortran program reads them into variables a and b.\n\nThen compute c as a - 2*b. Then check if c is less than zero, set it to zero. Then print c.\n\nNow, considering variable types: in Java, a and b are integers. In Fortran, I'll declare them as integers. Let's see the steps:\n\nStart by declaring integers a, b, c.\n\nRead a and b: read(*,*) a, b ?\n\nWait, in Fortran, if the input is given properly, that should work.\n\nThen compute c = a - 2*b.\n\nThen if c < 0 then c = 0. Because if it's negative, set to zero.\n\nThen print c. So write(*,*) c.\n\nWait but in Fortran, the output might have extra spaces or newlines. But the problem probably just wants the number. Using write(*,*) should be okay.\n\nNow, let me think about possible corner cases. For example, if the user inputs non-integer values, but in the problem context, the inputs are probably valid integers. Since the Java code has a try-catch but we're translating, maybe we can omit error handling unless specified, as Fortran might just error out anyway.\n\nSo the Fortran code structure would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: a, b, c\n  read(*,*) a, b\n  c = a - 2*b\n  if (c < 0) then\n    c = 0\n  end if\n  write(*,*) c\nend program main\n\nWait, let me check the variable names. The Java class is called atcoder_ABC143_A, but in Fortran, the program name can be anything, perhaps the same? Or maybe just main? Probably name it similarly, but in Fortran the program can have any name. Maybe the user just wants a Fortran program that does the task.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the program name is optional. But it's better to have a program statement. Let me see the standard.\n\nYes, using:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC143_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: a, b, c\n  read(*, *) a, b\n  c = a - 2 * b\n  if (c < 0) then\n     c = 0\n  end if\n  write(*, *) c\nend program atcoder_ABC143_A\n\nThat should do it. Let me double-check each step.\n\nReading the input: the Java code reads a line, splits by space, so two numbers. The Fortran code reads two integers from input. Same thing.\n\nThe calculation is the same: c = a -2b.\n\nCheck if c is negative: if yes, set to zero. Exactly the same logic.\n\nThen outputting c. Correct.\n\nI think that's the correct translation. The only thing is that in Fortran, the multiplication is *, and the syntax for if statements uses 'then' and 'end if'. Also, in Fortran, variables have to be declared. The 'implicit none' ensures that all variables are explicitly declared.\n\nYes, this should work."
