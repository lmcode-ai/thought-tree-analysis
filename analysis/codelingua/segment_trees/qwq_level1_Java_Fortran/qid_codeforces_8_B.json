Wait wait in the outer loop's condition:\n\nThe upper limit for i is k-4 \u2192 3-4 = -1 \u2192 since the loop's lower limit is 0, the loop variable i=0 can't be less then or equal to -1, so the outer loop will not run. So that's okay. Thus the program should handle that.",

So the k is the next step. Wait in the Java code, after moving (e.g., move causing x change):\n\nco[0][k] = new x, etc. then k is increased. Thus in Fortran:\n\nafter moving direction,\n\nco(1,k) = x, co(2,k) =y,\n\nthen k +=1. But in the code's setup above:\n\nWait in the loop I have above:\n\nWe moved the x/y, then write into co(1,k) (current k?), then increment k.\n\nWait yes.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem here is from Codeforces problem 8 B, maybe? Let me think through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads a string from input. Then, it processes each character in the string, updating coordinates x and y based on the direction (L, R, U, D). It records each position in a 2D array co (which is co[0][i] for x and co[1][i] for y). Then, there's a check: it loops through all pairs of points (i and j) separated by at least 3 steps? Or maybe checking some condition over the points stored in the array. The condition is that between points i and j, the distance can't be too small. The problem seems to check if there are any overlapping or near positions that would cause a \"BUG\", otherwise \"OK\".\n\nHmm, so the goal is to ensure that any two points in the path (coordinates) are not too close within some conditions. Let's see how that's done in Java.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran.\n\nFirst step is akin in Fortran to read the input. Instead of a Scanner, we can read from stdin using read(*,*) or list-directed input, but since it's a string, maybe a character array. Wait, in Fortran strings are easy, but we have to note that Fortran strings (prior to Fortran 2003) are fixed-length. Maybe the user has to specify the length, but let's see.\n\nFirst in the Java code, the string s is obtained via scan.next(). That gets the next token as a string. But since it's probably a single line, perhaps the entire line is the input. Wait, actually, the scanner's next() skips whitespaces and reads until the next whitespace. But in CodeForces problems, the input might be just a single word, so next() is acceptable here. In Fortran, we can use a read statement maybe.\n\nSo first, in Fortran:\n\nWe might define a character variable to hold the string, say, s, with enough length, like 100.\n\nIn Java, the character array ch is created with length 100, but in reality, the size is adjusted based on the string's length.\n\nWait, in Java code: ch = s.toCharArray() so that ch gets the correct length. In Fortran, if the string's length is N, then the array should be of size N. But in Java, it's redundant, as they first initialized a 100 char array, then replaced with the toCharArray. But probably safer to just take the string and process each character in a loop.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the input string, then loop over its characters.\n\nNow, the array co is a 2x101 array. The Java code does:\n\nco[0][k] = x; co[1][k] = y. The initial k starts at 0, so array indices go up to k steps. The maximum needed is like for a string of length N, which would require up to N+1 points (each step adds a new point). The array dimensions are 2 rows and 101 columns, which in Fortran has to be declared with that size. Since 100 steps (since 100 is the max allowed?), perhaps they're using a fixed-length array.\n\nWait, the original code's char array is 100 elements, but s.toCharArray() may actually give a longer array if the string is longer. Wait, but in Java, if the string is longer than 100, ch was initialized with 100 but they reassign. Wait actually, the code first initializes ch as new char[100]; but then reassigns to s.toCharArray(). So the initial size doesn't really matter. So in the program, the input can be up to probably 100 characters? Not sure, but for the purposes of translation, we can use a array with length 100 in Fortran as it's probably sufficient.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so perhaps they need adjustment. Wait, the Java code indices for the array co are 0-based, so the first element is co[0][0], etc. Hmm, but Fortran arrays can be declared with lower bounds. Alternatively, maybe using 0 to n, but in Fortran it's better to adjust indices.\n\nWait Java uses 0-based indices. Let me look into each part:\n\nJava code starts by setting co[0][k] = x, initially k=0, so that's 0. Then after each step in the loop, after moving, increment k. Wait, the for loop runs over each character, and each iteration adds a new position into the array. The for loop is from 0 to s.length()-1. After every iteration, the new coordinates are stored.\n\nThe co array has dimensions 2 by 101 columns (since co is set as new int[2][101]). So the k can go up to at least the length of s +1, but 100 columns would be sufficient for up to 100 steps.\n\nSo in Fortran, declare the array as something like integer, dimension(2, 101) :: co.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\nJava:\n\nint i, j, x = 0, y = 0, k = 0, dx, dy;\n\nBoolean flag = true.\n\nIn Fortran, variables must be declared before any executable code. So the code structure will be structured accordingly. We can declare variables at the start.\n\nAlso in the loop over the string, in Java that is for (i=0 to s.length(); ++i).\n\nWait, s.length() in Java is the length of the string, so the for loop iterates from 0 to s.length()-1, since loop condition is i < s.length.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) { ... }\n\nYes.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read the length as len_trim(s) if we read the string as a fixed-size character variable, for example.\n\nNow steps to translate:\n\nStart Fortran main program.\n\nRead the input string. Let's assume the user inputs a string without any trailing space. Let's declare s as a character array of length say 100.\n\nVariables: x, y, k (integers), set initial x=0, y=0, k=0 (k starts at 0?), then co array.\n\nWait, in the Java code, co is initialized as co[0][0] =0 and co[1][0] =0. Then k is 0, then after increment k becomes 1?\n\nLooking at the Java code:\n\nInitially:\n\nx =0, y=0, co[0][k] (co[0][0] =x) and co[1][0]=y. Then k is incremented to 1.\n\nThen for each character in the string (length n):\n\nafter processing step, get new x,y, then store in co[0][k], co[1][k], then k is incremented. So after the loop, the number of stored points is s.length +1. So for a string of length L, there are L+1 points.\n\nHence in Fortran, we need arrays to hold column indices from 0 up to, say, 100. But Fortran arrays typically start at 1. So perhaps we can shift the indices by 1, so co(1 to 2, 1 to 101). Then when in Java it's co[0][k], in Fortran it's co(1, k+1). Hmm, but that might complicate. Alternatively, use 1-based indices but adjust all code.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Fortran code, we can have i starting at 1, etc., but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, use 0-based arrays in Fortran. Wait, to use 0-based arrays, in Fortran we can declare arrays with lower bound. For example:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:100) :: x, y is possible, but maybe for co, it's:\n\ninteger, dimension(2, 0:100) :: co\n\nAh yes, so defining the second (column) dimension from 0 to 100 would allow using 0-based indices like in Java.\n\nThat's probably better. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: co(2, 0:100)\n\nThen, when initialing, the first index (co(1,0)), etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nAllocate the characters.\n\nThen the main variables:\n\nWe have x, y initialized to 0. co(1,0) and co(2,0) set to 0. Then k starts at 0, then increments. Wait in Java:\n\nco[0][0] =x (initial 0), then k is incremented to 1, etc.\n\nYes, in Fortran, set co(1,0)=x, co(2,0) = y. Then k increments.\n\nThe first loop processes each character of the input. For that, in Fortran, the string is a character array with length say 100.\n\nSo the steps for Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_8_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\n\ninteger :: i,j,x,y,k,dx,dy\n\ninteger :: co(2,0:100)\n\nlogical :: flag = .true.\n\nBut first, read the input string. The s is read as a character variable. But to get each character, s(1:i) where i is the length.\n\nIn fortran, the length can be known with len_trim(s).\n\nSo first:\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nBut we have to make sure that the string is not too long. The problem may state that the input length is <=100, so 100 length is enough.\n\nThen, the initial values:\n\nx =0\n\ny=0\n\nk =0\n\nco(1,0) =x\n\nco(2,0)=y\n\nk=1 ?\n\nWait wait in the Java code, after setting co[0][0], then k is incremented (since ++k; )\n\nWait:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nco[0][k] =x;\n\nco[1][k]=y;\n\n++k;\n\nWait:\n\nInitial:\n\nx and y are 0, k starts at 0.\n\nFirst:\n\nco[0][k] =x (0)\n\nco[1][k] =y (0)\n\nthen k increments to 1.\n\nSo after the first assignment, k is 1.\n\nThen, for each character in the string, the code processes it, then adds a new point.\n\nFor example, each character causes x and y to be changed, then stores into new k, then increments k. So after each iteration of the loop over each character, we add a new point.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose the string is of length 3.\n\nThen:\n\nLoop over 0,1,2 (since i <s.length() )\n\nAfter the first character (i=0):\n\n- process direction (update x and y),\n\nthen:\n\nco[0][k] = newx,\n\nco[1][k] = newy,\n\nthen k is incremented (k=2).\n\nSimilarly, after second character, k becomes 3, etc.\n\nAt the end of all characters, the total k is s.length +1.\n\nThus the array is filled from indices 0 up to k-1 (since after the loop, the final increments adjust?)\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nStart with k =0,\n\nSet co[ x,y at 0th index]\n\nthen increment k to 1.\n\nThen, after each character:\n\nalter x and y.\n\nthen set co[0][k] =x, co[1][k] = y,\n\nthen increment k (to next index).\n\nThus the total number of points stored when processing s.length() characters would be s.length() +1 (initial point plus each step's addition).\n\nSo in fortran:\n\nAfter reading the string:\n\nx =0; y=0; k=0. Wait, wait no:\n\nWait, original Java:\n\ninitial:\n\nint k=0;\n\nco[0][k] = x (0)\n\nco[1][k] = y (0)\n\nthen ++k (now k=1)\n\nThen, the loop starts.\n\nWait the code is:\n\nco[0][k]=x;\n\nco[1][k]=y;\n\nk increments.\n\nWait, so that first assignment is the initial position, then after that, each loop iteration adds a new position after moving.\n\nThus in the code's first step, after initialization, k becomes 1, which is the next index to add after moving.\n\nNow, the loop over i from 0 to s_length-1:\n\nfor each character, move (update x and y), then set co[0][k], etc. and increment k accordingly.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nAfter initializing, we set co(1,0)=x, co(2,0)=y, then k is set to 1. Then, in the loop over each character (from 1 to n?), perhaps:\n\nWait the loop's index in Java is from 0 to s.length()-1.\n\nIn fortran, after s has length len_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i=1, len_trim(s) or is it starting at 0? Let's see.\n\nWait in the Java for loop, when i is 0, that's the first character (first element of ch array). So in Fortran, for the first character: s(1:1). So the fortran index would be i going from 1 to len_s.\n\nWait but the Java's ch array is initialized as s.toCharArray(), so ch[i] is the ith character of the string (starting from 0). So for the first character:\n\nin Fortran, the equivalent is s(1) (assuming that s is a chracter(len=100) variable).\n\nTherefore, the loop in fortran will run from i=1 to len_trim(s).\n\nFor each step i=1 to len_s:\n\n- get the character s(i:i)\n\n- process direction.\n\n- Update x,y\n\n- store into co's current k, set co(1,k) =x, etc. then increment k.\n\nWait but also, after each step, the code adds the new position to the array, so the loop steps:\n\nfor each character in the string (which is of length N)\n\nsteps:\n\nchar is s(i:i), process to x/y,\n\nthen:\n\nco(1, k) =x\n\nco(2, k)=y\n\nthen k +=1.\n\nWait the first iteration (i=1), current k is 1. Wait, the first character will cause the next position. Let me think:\n\nOriginal code in Java:\n\nAfter initial steps, after setting k=1 (the first increment after initializing co[0][0], co[1][0]), then the loop runs over each character and processes it.\n\nFirst character (i=0 in Java):\n\nprocess direction (e.g., 'R' would make x=1).\n\nThen, after processing direction, set co[0][k] (which is 1), set co array to current x and y, then k becomes 2. So next time, for the next character's steps, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, the first step (i=1 corresponding to first character):\n\nThe code will process, then insert into the current k's spot, then increment k.\n\nYes.\n\nNow after all the characters are processed, the k has the value N+1 (since initial k was 1 before first step, then for N steps, k goes up by 1 each time, so N+1 after processing).\n\nWait initial k is 1, then for each of the N characters, the loop runs N times. So initial k is 1, after each run of the loop:\n\nafter inserting:\n\nco(1,k) is set, and then k increments to k+1. So after N times, k is 1 + N steps, so final k = N+1?\n\nWait the starting value:\n\nInitially:\n\nAfter the first assignment (the initial position), k is 1.\n\nFor the loop over N characters (each step is a move):\n\neach step runs through the loop and for each, in the body, after moving, we set co(k) and increment k. So after 1 iteration, k becomes 2, after N steps, k becomes 1 + N. So the total stored points are from k=0 to k = N (since up to but not including k's post-increment? Wait no, no:\n\nWait, when inside the loop body, they do:\n\nco[0][k] =x;\n\nco[1][k] =y;\n\nthen ++k.\n\nWait, the order is: first storing into current k (the current value of k before increment), and then increment k. So the next time, it's k+1.\n\nSo starting with k=1:\n\nLoop runs N times, after each step:\n\nk increases by 1.\n\nSo after N steps, K is 1 + N. Thus the stored positions are indices from 0 up to N.\n\nThus the maximum index used for co is k = N steps? Wait:\n\nWait the initial stored k=0 (the start position) is at position 0. The first step's stored k=1 (from before incrementing when adding first step). Then after N steps, K will be 1 + N. Therefore the array indices occupied up to k=N, since the last execution is storing into co's N-th index (since k is starting at 1, and after each loop step we increment after storing).\n\nWait, let's track with N =3 (three characters):\n\nInitial steps: k starts at 1, but wait. Wait in initial steps:\n\nJava code:\n\nAfter initializing x,y,k=0:\n\nco[0][k] = x (so index 0 x is stored). Then, co[0][0] and co[1][0] set to 0.\n\nThen they call ++k; so now k is 1.\n\nThen, the loop starts at i=0 (for the first character) up to N-1.\n\nIn first iteration (i=0):\n\nThe process the character and move, then store in co[0][k] (which is 1):\n\nthen k becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration (i=1):\n\nProcess, store into co[0][2], then get k=3.\n\nThird iteration (i=2):\n\nprocess, store into co[0][3], then k=4.\n\nOverall, after N=3 characters, the stored entries are indices 0,1,2,3 (i.e., four positions) since N=3 steps added three more points (positions 1,2,3), plus the initial 0.\n\nWait the first step (i=0):\n\nthe stored position is 1, so after the first step, the stored points are 0 and 1.\n\nSecond step adds 2, third step adds 3.\n\nTotal 4 points (0,1,2,3).\n\nThus for length N=3, the final k is 4 (initially 1, then after first step 2, second 3, third 4). Thus, the stored entries go up to k= N?\n\nWait, for three characters, the last storing location is k=3 (since in third step, k starts at 3 (before the K is incremented in the loop step. Wait, in third iteration, the initial K is 3 before the loop processes the third character?\n\nWait let me track for N=3.\n\nInitially K is 1 after the initial step.\n\nFirst loop iteration (i=0):\n\nstore into K=1 (co[1][1], etc.)\n\nthen K becomes 2.\n\nSecond loop: K starts at 2.\n\nstore into K=2. K becomes 3.\n\nThird loop (i=2? Since i goes up till N-1):\n\nloop variable i runs up to 2 (since N=3: indices 0,1,2).\n\nthird iteration comes next:\n\ni=2, processing the third character (the third character in the string).\n\nIn the loop body:\n\nprocess direction, which updates x and y,\n\nthen store into co[0][3], co[1][3]\n\nthen K becomes 4.\n\nThus the locations stored are 0,1,2,3.\n\nThus k after loop has value 4 (which is N + 1).\n\nSo for N characters, there are N+1 points stored (indices 0..N).\n\nThus the code's second loop:\n\nfor (i=0; i < k -3; ++i) {\n\nthe 'k' value here is N+1?\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the for loops are:\n\nthe outer loop goes from i=0 to (k-3-1) because in Java for (i < k-3: in Java loop runs while i < k -3. Because in Java, the for loop increments until the condition is met.\n\nWait the loop is written as:\n\nfor(i=0; i <k-3;++i) {\n\nSo when k is 4 (like N=3), the loop runs when 0 <4-3 \u2192 i <1? So i can be 0 only?\n\nWait 4-3 =1, so i <1 \u2192 i=0.\n\nWait let me see, with N=3:\n\nthe outer loop runs i from 0 up to (k-3) minus 1? Or until i < (k-3). Wait k is 4, so k-3 is 1.\n\nThus, the outer loop runs for i from 0 to less than 1, which is 0 only.\n\nThe inner loop is:\n\nfor(j = i +3; j <k; ++j) {\n\nIn this case, with i=0, j starts at 3 (0+3=3), and j <4 \u2192 up to 3.\n\nThus, the pairs would be i=0, j=3.\n\nCheck if those two points are too close.\n\nThe purpose of this code is checking whether any two points (i and j) in the path are within one step apart, but with j at least 3 indices apart from i.\n\nWait because the indices i and j being at least 3 steps apart (since j is i+3 or more). Because the loop for j starts at i+3, so the distance in the array is at least 3 steps between them, so two points that are far apart in the path can't be overlapping. Wait, but the code is looking for any two points, even though they are far apart in the sequence, but close in coordinates, which would indicate a 'loop' or something leading to collision.\n\nWait the problem is from Codeforces 8B; it's called \"Sereja and Lamps\" which requires checking if any two positions in the path, except those 2 steps apart, are close?\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires to make sure that in the path movement, you never step into or adjacent to (in Manhattan distance 1) any previous position except the next or two steps prior. Wait perhaps this check ensures that there are no positions in the path separated by at least 3 steps that are next to each other.\n\nWait the condition:\n\ndx is distance in x, dy distance in y.\n\nThe code calculates dx as absolute value of (co[0][i] - co[0][j]), similar for dy. The condition is if (dx <=1 and dy is zero) or (dy <=1 and dx is zero) \u2192 flags as false.\n\nSo if two points i and j (more than two steps apart) are on the same line (either along x or y axis) and only 1 unit apart, then it's a bug.\n\nThe loops scan all pairs where their indices are at least 3 apart and see if any of these pairs are too close (distance less or equal to 1 along one direction).\n\nThus the code is checking for any two positions that are at least three steps apart in the sequence, but are within 1 unit in either x or y direction (i.e., adjacent or the same along one axis and immediate.\n\nThus the flag is set to true unless such pairs are found.\n\nTranslating the loops:\n\nIn Fortran, loops are written with do loops.\n\nThe outer loop in Java would be written in Fortran as:\n\ndo i=0, k-4 ! because i <k-3 \u2192 i's max is k-3-1 \u2192 (k-3-1)=k-4.\n\nWait in Java: for (i=0; i < (k-3); i++ ){\n\nThe maximum i is (k-3 -1 )= k-4.\n\nThus, in Fortran: do i=0, (k - 3 -1)\n\nBut since the loop variable in Fortran runs up to and including the upper limit (unlike Java loops that loop while <).\n\nWait in for loops in Fortran:\n\nfor i =a to b step c: do i = a, b, c.\n\nIn this case, the loop must go from i=0 to i_max = (k-3 -1). Since the condition in Java is i < (k-3).\n\nAlternatively, compute the upper limit as i_upper = k-4, but if (k-3 <=0), then the loop doesn't run at all. So the code in Fortran:\n\nif (k-3 <=0), then loop not entered.\n\nOtherwise:\n\ndo i =0, k-4\n\n:\n\nenddo.\n\nThen the inner loop:\n\nfor (j= i+3; j <k ; ++j )\n\nSimilarly, j runs from i+3 to (k-1) (since j <k \u2192 j can be up to k-1 )\n\nThus in Fortran, do j = i+3, (k-1)\n\nInside the loops, compute dx and dy.\n\ndx = co(1,i) - co(1,j)\n\nAgain, in Fortran, we can compute the absolute difference, then check:\n\ndx is abs( dx), etc.\n\nWait code in Java:\n\ndx = co[0][i] - co[0][j];\n\nif (dx <0) dx *= (-1);\n\nWhich is equivalent to the absolute value of dx.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\ndx = co(1,i) - co(1,j)\n\ndx = abs(dx)\n\nsimilar for dy.\n\nThus:\n\ndy = co(2,i) - co(2,j)\n\ndy = abs(dy)\n\nthen check: (dx <=1 .and. dy ==0) .or. ( dy <=1 .and. dx ==0 )\n\nIf this condition is true, then set flag =.false. and break.\n\nThe loops have a break; statements. In Java, the inner loop breaks and the outer also if detected.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nafter computing dx, dy, then:\n\nif ( ( dx <=1 .and. dy ==0 ) .or. ( dy <=1 .and. dx ==0 ) ) then\n\nflag = .false.\n\nexit do (the inner loop)\n\nend if\n\nBut in Fortran, loops can have their own labels to exit to, but perhaps the code can be nested with appropriate loop controls.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nOnce the condition is true, you need to exit the inner loop, then exit the outer loop.\n\nAlternatively, set a flag, exit loops.\n\nAlternatively, the code: after the inner loop, check whether the flag is still true before proceeding.\n\nWait in the Java code after computing the condition, it is possible that once the flag is set to false, we break the inner loop and then break the outer.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, once within the inner do loop, if the condition is true, set flag to false, and then exit the inner loop and also the outer loop.\n\nWait how to handle this in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran90+, you can use a block label or the CYCLE and EXIT statements.\n\nAlternatively, In the inner do loop, after setting the flag, we can exit immediately out of the inner loop. Then, after the inner loop, check if flag is set and then exit the outer loop.\n\nHere's a draft code scheme for the loops:\n\ndo i =0, ... \n\n   do j= i+3 ...\n\n      compute dx, dy\n\n      if (condition) ...\n\n         flag = .false.\n\n         exit innerloop\n\n   enddo innerloop\n\n   if (flag == .false.) exit outerloop\n\nenddo outerloop\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a labeled exit:\n\nouter_loop: do i=0 ....\n\n   inner_loop: do j= i+3 ...\n\n      ... \n\n      if (condition) then\n\n         flag = .false.\n\n         exit outer_loop\n\n         exit inner_loop\n\n      end if\n\n   end do inner_loop\n\nend do outer_loop\n\nBut need to have the label to exit to both loops.\n\nAlternatively, after determining that flag is false, you can break the outer loop. But in Fortran, the loop doesn't have break, so can use an EXIT statement to exit the outer loop.\n\nBut how to exit both loops.\n\nAlternatively, set a flag and after each inner loop, check and exit outer loop.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, after the inner loop, after the do j, exit condition if flag is set.\n\nSo something like:\n\nouter: do i =0, (k-4)\n\n   do j= i+3, (k-1)\n\n      ... compute dx dy\n\n      if (condition) then\n\n         flag = .false.\n\n         exit outer ! this would exit the entire loop\n\n      endif\n\n  end do\n\n  if (.not. flag) exit outer ! Not needed, but perhaps correct structure.\n\n end do outer\n\nWait, no, in this case, \"exit outer\" is possible.\n\nThe loop is labeled outer, so when exiting with that, the inner loop is also exited.\n\nYes, the structure above would work.\n\nOnce the inner finds the condition, it sets flag to false and exits the outer loop, hence skipping further iterations.\n\nTherefore, the loops can be structured as:\n\n outerloop: do i = 0, (k -4)\n\n    do j = i +3, (k-1)\n\n        dx = co(1,i) - co(1,j)\n\n        dx = abs(dx)\n\n        dy = co(2,i) - co(2,j)\n\n        dy = abs(dy)\n\n        if ( (dx <=1 .and. dy ==0) .or. ( dy <=1 .and. dx ==0 )) then\n\n            flag = .false.\n\n            exit outerloop\n\n        endif\n\n    end do\n\n end do outerloop\n\nThus this way, if any pair meets the condition, the loops stop and flag is set to false.\n\nNow once all loops are done, then check flag and print \"OK\" or \"BUG\".\n\nAt last, in Fortan, printing is done via write statements.\n\nThus, after loops:\n\nif (flag) then\n\n   write(*,*) 'OK'\n\nelse \n\n   write(*,*) 'BUG'\n\nendif \n\nPutting all together.\n\nNow variables:\n\nWe need to note:\n\nIn Fortran, all variables must be declared before the executable code.\n\nTo declare the variables:\n\nprogram codeforces_8_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\n\ninteger :: x, y, k, i, j, dx, dy, len_s\n\ninteger, dimension(2,0:100) :: co\n\nlogical :: flag \n\ninitialization:\n\nx =0\n\ny=0\n\nk=0\n\nco(1,k)=x\n\nco(2,k)=y\n\n! K is initialized to 0, then we do:\n\nk =k +1\n\n! now k is 1.\n\nThen, read the string.\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nso:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s\n\nthen:\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\nthen loop over characters:\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n    ! process character s(i:i)\n\n    select case (s(i:i))\n\n    case ('L')\n\n        x = x -1\n\n    case ('R')\n\n        x = x +1\n\n    case ('U')\n\n        y = y +1\n\n    case ('D')\n\n        y = y -1\n\n    case default\n\n        ! probably not needed as per problem constraints.\n\n    end select\n\n    ! save the new position to co:\n\n    co(1,k) =x\n\n    co(2,k) = y\n\n    k = k +1\n\nend do\n\nWait here in the loop, after moving, we save to the current k (without prior increment). Because in Java:\n\nafter moving, they set co[0][k] = x (the current k's value is unchanged before increment).\n\nWait in Java: the code does the move, then set co[0][k], then increment k. So the k is the next step.\n\nWait in the Java code, after moving (e.g., move causing x change):\n\nco[0][k] = new x, etc. then k is increased.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nafter moving direction,\n\nco(1,k) = x, co(2,k) =y,\n\nthen k +=1.\n\nBut in the code's setup above:\n\nWait in the loop I have above:\n\nWe moved the x/y, then write into co(1,k) (current k?), then increment k.\n\nWait yes.\n\nAt start of the loop, k has previous value, then we set co(1,k) = new x and y, then k is incremented.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the code after processing movement:\n\nco(1,k) = x\n\nco(2,k) =y\n\nthen k =k +1.\n\nWait but in Fortran code above:\n\nthe loop would have after moving:\n\nco(1,k) =x\n\nco(2,k)=y\n\nthen k +=1 (since in Java it added one after storing)\n\nHence correct.\n\nNow after this loop, the array is filled correctly.\n\nThen the loops for checking i and j.\n\nThen comes the loops for checking.\n\nThus the program outline is:\n\nprogram codeforces_8_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=100) :: s\n\ninteger :: x=0, y=0, k=0, len_s, dx=0, dy=0, i,j \n\ninteger, dimension(2,0:100) :: co\n\nlogical :: flag = .true.\n\n! Initialize the starting position\n\nco(1,0) =0\n\nco(2,0) =0\n\nk=1  ! initial k after first increment in java (previously, in Java initial was 0 then k becomes 1)\n\nread(*,'(A)') s\n\nlen_s = len_trim(s)\n\ndo i =1, len_s\n\n    select case ( s(i:i) )\n\n    case ('L')\n\n        x = x -1\n\n    case ('R')\n\n        x = x +1\n\n    case ('U')\n\n        y = y +1\n\n    case ('D')\n\n        y = y -1\n\n    end select\n\n    co(1,k) = x\n\n    co(2,k) = y\n\n    k = k + 1\n\nend do\n\n! Now check for any i and j with distance >=3 indices and close coordinates.\n\nouterloop : do i =0, k-4\n\n    do j =i +3, k-1\n\n        dx = co(1,i) - co(1,j)\n\n        dx = abs(dx)\n\n        dy = co(2,i) - co(2,j)\n\n        dy = abs(dy)\n\n        if ( ( (dx <=1 .and. dy ==0) .or. &\n\n             (dy <=1 .and. dx ==0) ) ) then\n\n            flag = .false.\n\n            exit outerloop\n\n        endif\n\n    end do\n\nend do outerloop\n\nif (flag) then\n\n    print *, 'OK'\n\nelse\n\n    print *, 'BUG'\n\nend if\n\nend program codeforces_8_B\n\nWait, but checking some corner cases.\n\nWait the initialization:\n\nInitially in Fortran, we set:\n\nco(1,0)=0, co(2,0)=0. Then k=1 (initial step after first step in Java).\n\nIn the first step of the loop over characters (i=1 in Fortran, first character):\n\nafter processing, then set into position k=1, then increase to 2 (so k becomes 2).\n\nSo after iteration with i=1, the next positions are stored correctly.\n\nAnother corner case: if the string is very short?\n\nFor example, if the length is less than 3, then k will be N+1.\n\nThus k-3 could be negative, then the loop for i would be from 0 to (k-4).\n\nIf k is 2 (string length 1), then k-4 is 2-4= -2 \u2192 since i starts at 0, the upper bound is negative so the loop doesn't run.\n\nWhich is correct, since there are no pairs with indices 3 apart.\n\nAnother test case: if k=3 (3 1-length string? no: let's see string of 2 chars:\n\n2 chars: the initial k=1 before processing.\n\nloop runs i=1 and 2?\n\nWait N=2:\n\nAfter the loop processing:\n\nk would be 1 (initial) then:\n\nfirst character (i=1):\n\nprocess it \u2192 save at position 1, k becomes 2.\n\nsecond character (i=2):\n\nprocess \u2192 save at pos2, then k becomes3.\n\nThus the total k after loop is 3.\n\nSo for N=2:\n\nk-3 =3-3= 0 \u2192 the outer loop runs up to 0 (i=0) to 3-4 \u21920-1 ?\n\nWait wait in the outer loop's condition:\n\nThe upper limit for i is k-4 \u2192 3-4 = -1 \u2192 since the loop's lower limit is 0, the loop variable i=0 can't be less then or equal to -1, so the outer loop will not run. So that's okay.\n\nThus the program should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran, the loops are 0-based for the indices. But arrays are allowed to have lower bound 0.\n\nAnother possible error: in the loops for the indices.\n\nWait in the loops where j starts at i+3:\n\nfor example, when i=0, and i+3 could be up to k-1.\n\nIn cases where i+3 <= k-1 \u2192 j is allowed.\n\nElse the loop over j doesn't run.\n\nTherefore that's okay.\n\nI think this code should work.\n\nTesting with Edge Cases:\n\nTest Case 1: The empty string. Wait, but according to the problem, maybe the input is at least length 1?\n\nIn any case, let's see if Java handles an empty string:\n\nSuppose s.length() is zero (the empty string). Then the loop is not run, and the array has just the (0,0).\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nlen_s =0, so the loop skips.\n\nThus the check loops:\n\nk would be 1 (since initially k=1 before processing any characters, and since no characters, the loops of processing are not entered \u2192 thus k remains 1.\n\nthen the loops in check will check if \"i <k -3\" \u2013 since k is 1, outer loop upper limit is 1-4 =-3 \u2192 loops skipped.\n\nThen flag is true, output is 'OK'.\n\nSimilarly in the Java code?\n\nIn Java, for empty string:\n\nThe code would have k=1.\n\nThen, in the outer loop for (i=0; i < (k-3) \u2192 k-3 is -2 \u2192 condition false \u2192 no loop executed \u2192 flag remains true \u2192 'OK'.\n\nAnother Test Case: a minimal bug.\n\nSuppose the path is L then R then L \u2192 so the steps:\n\nInitial (0,0)\n\nAfter L \u2192 (-1,0) \u2192 saved at k=1 (so that's first new step)\n\nThen R \u2192 back to 0,0 (position k=2)\n\nThen L \u2192 (-1, 0) (position k=3).\n\nThus, stored positions are:\n\n0: (0,0)\n\n1: (-1,0)\n\n2: (0,0)\n\n3: (-1, 0)\n\nThen, check for any i and j where j is at distance at least 3 from i (i.e., j >=i+3).\n\nPossible pairs that may match:\n\nChecking between i=0 and j=3: those two have (0,0) and (-1,0). The dx is absolute difference of 0 - (-1)? Wait:\n\nco(0,i) co(1,0) is the stored array:\n\nWait confusion here: in stored array, for this example:\n\nco(0,0) is the x-coordinate, but in the code's declaration, '2 rows', so in the array:\n\nco(1,j) is the x, co(2,j) the y.\n\nWait let me see.\n\nOriginal Java code's co array: it's initialized as new int[2][101], so the first dimension (row) is 0 or 1 (in 0-based indices), and co[0][k] is x.\n\nThus in Fortran code, the array is:\n\nco(1,k) =x (for 1-based row 1). Because when in declaration co is dimension(2,0:100), then co(1,i) is the x-coordinate for the position i steps in the sequence.\n\nIn the example, the position 0: x is 0.\n\nposition 1 (k=1, after L) has x =-1, y=0.\n\nposition2 (k=2) comes from after R: x is 0.\n\nposition3: k=3: after L again: x-1.\n\nso the set of points:\n\npoints are indices 0,1,2,3.\n\nThen testing for pairs i and j where they are at distance 3 apart (like i=0 and j=3).\n\ni=0's position is (0,0), j=3 is x=-1, y=0.\n\ndx = 0 - (-1) \u2192 1.\n\ndy is 0. So dx <=1, dy 0 \u2192 condition is true.\n\nThus the program would set flag to false.\n\nTherefore, it would output 'BUG'.\n\nAnother example: a three-length path that loops.\n\nBut that's a minimal case.\n\nAnother thing to note in the code is that dx=1 and dy=0 is allowed only if their separation in steps is less than 3?\n\nThe code's check ensures that if two positions that are '3 steps apart' have a distance of (dx <=1 or dy) \u2192 ,then it's invalid.\n\nThis should translate correctly.\n\nThus the Fortran code should be as above."
