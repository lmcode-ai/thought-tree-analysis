    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to convert this Java code into Fortran. Let me look through the Java code first. The problem is about checking if a certain condition is met with some arrays and counts. \n\nFirst, the Java code starts by reading two integers, n and levels. Then, it reads an array of size levels. Then, it reads another input level2, calculates level3 as levels + level2. Then it creates an array arr2 of size level3. The first part of arr2 is filled with the elements from the original array, and the remaining elements are read from input. \n\nWait, let me trace each step:\n\nOriginal Java variables:\n- Scanner sc to read input.\n- n is the number of levels needed?\n- levels is the initial number of levels.\n- Then arr is an array of levels elements, each read via sc.nextInt().\n- Then level2 is another input, so level3 = levels + level2.\n- Then arr2 has size level3. The first levels elements come from arr, then the rest (level2 elements) are read from input.\n\nWait, in the code, after copying arr into arr2 (for i from 0 to arr.length, which is levels-1?), then the remaining elements from i = arr.length (which is levels) up to level3 -1 (since it's 0-based in Java). \n\nThen they loop through arr2, but empty. Maybe just initializing?\n\nThen arr3 is an array of n elements starting from 1 to n. So for arr3[i] = j++? Wait in Java the code uses arr3[i] = ++j, and then i goes from 0 to n-1. So when j starts at 0, incrementing first, so the first element is 1, second 2 up to n. \n\nThen they check all elements of arr3 (1..n) against arr2. For each element in arr3, they loop through arr2 to see if it exists. If it does, count increments and break. So count will be the number of elements present. \n\nThen, if count ==n, print the success message, else the failure.\n\nHmm, okay. Now translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses module with subroutines rather than classes and main functions. Since the Java example has a main method, probably the Fortran code will be a program.\n\nFortran variables need to be declared with types, likely using integers.\n\nFirst step: Read n and levels. Then read levels numbers into an array.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can't be dynamically sized without pointers, so perhaps declare the arrays with an upper limit? Or use allocatable arrays.\n\nSo maybe the code should use allocatable arrays. \n\nThe Java code uses three arrays: arr (size levels), arr2 (size level3), and arr3 (size n). So in Fortran, we can declare them as allocatable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and levels from stdin.\n\n2. Read 'levels' integers into an array arr.\n\n3. Read level2 (the next input after level?), so in Java:\n\nAfter reading arr, it reads level2 = sc.nextInt().\n\nWait in the Java code, after the first for loop over arr (for (int i=0; i < levels; i++) arr[i] = sc.nextInt();), the next lines are:\n\nint level2 = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen level3 is levels + level2.\n\nThen the rest of the code. So the order is:\n\nInput sequence:\n\nFirst n, then levels,\n\nthen levels integers for arr,\n\nthen level2,\n\nthen level3 = levels + level2,\n\nthen (level3 - levels) more integers, since arr2 is filled first with the original levels elements (copied from arr) and then the remaining (level2 elements?) via sc.nextInt() ?\n\nWait in the code for filling arr2:\n\nThe code does:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) arr2[i] = arr[i]; \n\nThen, for the rest (from i=arr.length up to level3 -1), they assign via sc.nextInt(). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So for the arr2 array, the first part is filled with arr, then the next level2 elements (since level3 - levels = level2) are read.\n\nSo in Fortran, we need to read the inputs in the same order.\n\nFirst, the ordering of inputs is:\n\nn\n\nlevels\n\nthen levels numbers for arr\n\nthen level2 (next int after levels numbers)\n\nthen, level2 numbers (because after that total of levels + level2 (level3) elements are needed, so first levels elements are copied from arr (so the first levels elements are the initial arr), then the next level2 elements are read. \n\nSo for Fortran array arr2, which is size level3 (levels + level2), the first levels elements are from arr, then the remaining level2 elements are read as next inputs.\n\nNow, in Fortran, let me plan variables.\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_469_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, levels, level2, level3, count, j, i, x\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), arr2(:), arr3(:)\n\n! read n and levels\n\nread (*,*) n, levels\n\nallocate(arr(levels))\n\nread (*,*) arr(1:levels)\n\n! then read level2\n\nread (*,*) level2\n\nlevel3 = levels + level2\n\nallocate(arr2(level3))\n\n! fill the first part with arr's elements:\n\narr2(1:levels) = arr\n\n! then, the remaining elements in level3 - levels = level2 elements.\n\n! Next, read level2 numbers. The current pointer is after reading level2.\n\n! So the next line would be read (*,*) (arr2(levels+1:level3))\n\nread (*,*) (arr2(levels+1:level3))\n\nWait, but the way to read? Because in Java, each of those is an individual sc.nextInt().\n\nIn Fortran, if I have a block like:\n\nread (*,*) (arr2(levels+1:level3))\n\nBut each element should be read sequentially. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers after level2 is how many. The next inputs would be exactly level2 numbers, so the total after arr2 is filled with the first levels elements, need to read the remaining (level3 - levels) elements (exactly level2 numbers).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after that, it can be done as:\n\nread *, (arr2(i), i=levels+1, level3)\n\nWait yes, that's better. So the loop to fill the remaining part would be using that syntax.\n\nWait but in the java code, the loop is:\n\nfor(int i=levels; i < level3 (since in Java indices start at 0?) or wait in Fortran arrays start at 1?\n\nWait, Java arrays are zero-based, so the code loops from i starting at arr.length (which is levels), i going up to level3 -1 inclusive. So in the Java code, the second loop runs from i = levels (0-based) to level3-1, thus (level3 - levels) elements, which is exactly level2, since level3 = levels + level2. \n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are 1-based, after copying the first levels elements from 1 to levels, the second part is from levels+1 up to level3 (since level3 is the total size). So to read (level3 - levels) = level2 items, one by one.\n\nThe code in Java reads each in a sequential for loop. In Fortran, that can be done by initializing an index from levels+1 to level3 and reading the elements in one line statement. \n\nSo the code after allocating arr2 would be:\n\ndo i = levels+1, level3\n\n  read *, arr2(i)\n\nend do\n\nHmm, but that would require a loop. Alternatively using the implied-do in read can also work.\n\nWait, but there's a gotcha here. When reading with a list-directed read, if we have multiple integers on a single line, it might read the correct amount. But the problem's input structure is not known. The Java code reads the level2 elements one after another. So perhaps in the input, after the level2 variable, there's exactly level2 numbers to read.\n\nTherefore, to read the remaining elements, we can use:\n\nread *, (arr2(i), i = levels+1, level3)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, since the remaining elements are exactly level2 items, maybe they are all part of the next input line. \n\nWait in any case, the way the code is written in Java, the code loops from i = levels up (Java's indexes start at 0). \n\nWait in Fortran's case, the loop would go for each element from levels+1 to level3 (the upper limit is inclusive).\n\nThus in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nallocate(arr2(level3))\n\narr2(1:levels) = arr\n\ndo i = levels+1, level3\n\n   read *, arr2(i)\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, but for reading a sequence, the compiler can be told to read sequentially. \n\nHmm, this part is a bit tricky. Maybe doing it with a loop is safe.\n\nNow, after arr2 is filled, the next step is creating arr3, which is the array 1 to n.\n\nSo in Fortran, arr3 can be allocated as (n elements), and then populated as:\n\nallocate (arr3(n))\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   arr3(i) = i\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran 90+, using array constructors.\n\narr3 = [(i, i=1,n)]\n\nThat's probably better.\n\nThen the loop to check for each element in arr3 whether it exists in arr2:\n\nInitialize count = 0\n\nloop over each element in arr3:\n\n   for each element val in arr3(i)\n\n      check if val exists in arr2.\n\n      if yes, increment count and break (to move to next val).\n\nSo in Fortran, how to do this? Here, for each element in arr3 (which is 1 to n), we need to check if it is present in arr2 array.\n\nThus, loops:\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   val = arr3(i)          ! since arr3(i) =i?\n\nWait wait, arr3 is 1..n. So directly the value is i. So perhaps even better: loop over i=1 to n, then val is i.\n\nWait, in the code, arr3 is exactly [1,2,...n]. So, for each i in 1 to n:\n\n   set val =i.\n\n   then check if val is present in arr2.\n\nSo in this case, perhaps even better:\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (any(arr2 == i)) then\n\n       count=count+1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nYes, that's better. So the 'any' intrinsic function can be used here. So we can eliminate the inner loop.\n\nBut in the original code, they loop through all elements of arr2 until a match is found. So it's O(n*m), but with the any function, it's also O(n*m), but code is cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, in older Fortran which may not have 'any', but I think even F90 has it.\n\nTherefore, the code can do:\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i =1, n\n\n   if (any( arr2 == i )) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nThen, compare count to n. If equal, output message.\n\nAfter that, deallocate arrays if needed. Not strictly necessary for a program that exits, but better practice.\n\nWait in Fortran, when using allocatable arrays, they are deallocated automatically upon exit. But better to do it manually for clarity.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nPossible steps:\n\nprogram codeforces_469_A\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, levels, level2, level3, count, i, val\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), arr2(:), arr3(:)\n\n! Read N and levels\nread(*,*) n, levels\n\n! Read the 'levels' elements into arr\nallocate(arr(levels))\nread(*,*) arr(1:levels)\n\n! Read level2\nread(*,*) level2\n\n! Compute level3\nlevel3 = levels + level2\n\n! Allocate arr2\nallocate( arr2(level3) )\n\n! Copy the arr elements into first part of arr2\narr2(1:levels) = arr(1:levels)\n\n! Read next level2 elements into the rest of arr2\n! Now, these are read from input: next line(s). Let me think:\n\n! The next inputs after level2 are a line with level2 integers, right?\n\n! So to read them, for the elements from level+1 to level3 (total level2 elements)\n\ndo i = levels+1, level3\n   read(*,*) arr2(i)\nenddo\n\n! Alternatively, if all are on one line, perhaps use:\n! read(*,*) (arr2(i), i = levels+1, level3 )\n\n! But which approach is correct? Let me think:\n\nIn the original Java code:\n\nfor(int i=arr.length; i < level3 ; i++) {\n\n   arr2[i] = sc.nextInt();\n\n}\n\narr.length is levels, so i from levels (0-based) up to level3-1. \n\nThus, the number of elements to read is level3 - arr.length = level3 - levels = level2. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran we need to read level2 elements.\n\nThus the do loop from levels+1 to level3 (since from 1-based, it's the same count). \n\nThus, the 'do loop' version may be better because if the user inputs the next elements across different lines, it will work. Although standard input's format isn't specified, but in programming challenges usually all elements are on the same line.\n\nAlternatively using a single read with the implied loop.\n\nAssuming that after the 'level2' variable, the next line contains exactly 'level2' integers, so:\n\nread(*,*) (arr2(i),i=levels+1, level3 )\n\nbut then:\n\nWait, after reading 'level2', the next read is (arr2(...) which is level2 elements. The read statement would expect exactly 'level2' elements. \n\nBut maybe that's okay. Let me think: suppose the line after the 'level2' input has exactly level2 numbers separated by spaces, then yes. So in that case, the read would be okay. \n\nWhich approach is better? \n\nPerhaps better to put the second line into a single read statement, as in the code line I mentioned.\n\nSo changing the loop to: \n\nread(*,*) ( arr2(i), i=levels+1, level3 )\n\nThat's more concise. \n\nNow the rest.\n\nThe arr3 array? Well, the values are 1..n. So instead of creating it as an array, perhaps just iterate over 1 to n.\n\nAlternatively, we can just do:\n\ncount =0\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   if( any(arr2 ==i )) then\n\n      count = count +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nSo we don't even need arr3. Because arr3 is just the numbers 1 to n. So saving memory and steps.\n\nThat's better. \n\nThen, after checking count, output the correct message.\n\nSo the steps are simplified here.\n\nSo code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, handle the messages.\n\nIn Fortran, the output can be written with print statements.\n\nif (count ==n) then\n\n   print *, 'I become the guy.'\n\nelse\n\n   print *, 'Oh, my keyboard!'\n\nend if\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait let me verify.\n\nNow, the variables:\n\n- We can declare variables: n, levels, level2, level3 as integers.\n\n- The arrays are arr, arr2 (allocatable).\n\nWait, in the code, arr is an array of levels numbers. \n\nNow the problem in Fortran is that in the initial read, after reading n and levels, then the next read for the arr array may have multiple values on one line.\n\nYes, the 'read (*,*) arr(1:levels)' will read however the input is provided (e.g., all on one line or split across lines).\n\nNow, possible code:\n\nprogram codeforces_469_A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, levels, level2, level3, count, i\n  integer, allocatable :: arr(:), arr2(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n, levels\n  allocate(arr(levels))\n  read(*,*) (arr(i),i=1,levels)\n\n  read(*,*) level2\n  level3 = levels + level2\n  allocate(arr2(level3))\n\n  arr2(1:levels) = arr(1:levels)\n  read(*,*) (arr2(i),i=levels+1,level3)\n\n  count =0\n  do i =1,n\n     if (any(arr2 ==i )) count = count +1\n  end do\n\n  if (count == n) then\n     print *, 'I become the guy.'\n  else\n     print *, 'Oh, my keyboard!'\n  end if\n\n  deallocate(arr)\n  deallocate(arr2)\nend program codeforces_469_A\n\nWait let me check this step by step.\n\nAt first, read n and levels.\n\nThen, read arr's elements: since arr is length levels, so the read is using '(arr(i),i=1,levels)' which would read exactly levels numbers.\n\nThen, level2 is next input. \n\nThen arr2 is allocated to level3.\n\nCopy first levels elements from arr, correct.\n\nThen the next read is filling arr2 from level+1 to level3. That is exactly level2 elements, so the read statement should get exactly level2 numbers.\n\nThen, checking each i from 1 ton. So, for each i, check if any element in arr2 equals i. \n\nYes.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- What if arr2 has duplicates? Doesn't matter, because 'any' just checks existence. \n\n- For n=0? Probably not, since in the problem constraints, but perhaps not relevant here.\n\nAnother possible issue in Fortran: the comparison arr2 ==i. Since arr2 is an array of integers, the comparison is element-wise, resulting in a logical array, which is then checked by 'any'.\n\nYes, that's okay.\n\nTesting in mind: suppose an example.\n\nSuppose n=2, levels=1, the first array is [1]. Then level2=1, so level3=2. Then the next input is 2. \n\narr2 will be [1,2], so all numbers 1 and 2 are present. So count should be 2, output correct message.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, levels=1 with [1], level2=1, next input is 3. \n\nThen arr2 is [1,3]. So need to check 1 and 2. 1 is present but 2 is not. count=1, so output keyboard. That's correct.\n\nNow, in the original Java code, the code uses an explicit loop breaking, but in Fortran's 'any(arr2 ==i)' it's the same as checking all elements until finds one.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat about the order of the elements in arr2? It doesn't matter, as we only check 'any' occurrence.\n\nNow, for large arrays, using 'any' could be slow? But in a programming competition with time constraints, but perhaps acceptable since the problem's constraints are manageable.\n\nNow, the code uses allocate and deallocate. The deallocate is not strictly required, but good practice.\n\nWait, also, in the original Java code, the array arr3 was initialized as from 1 to n, but in the Fortran version, it's not needed. Good.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in the loop for filling arr2's last part. Suppose the read is expecting a single line. In Fortran, list-directed input can read from multiple lines. But in competition settings, the inputs are usually given as each line corresponds to the input as per the problem. So perhaps it's okay.\n\nNow the code's array sizes: the arr2 is allocated as level3.\n\nThe code's syntax:\n\nYes, in Fortran 90+ this should be okay.\n\nAnother point: the original Java code uses three integers (sum, sum2, sum3), but in the code they are set to zero but not used. So they are artifacts in the Java code provided, perhaps leftover code. But in the code provided, those are just initialized but not used. So the Fortran code should ignore them.\n\nOther variables: sum3, sum2, etc., in Java are set to zero and not used, so in Fortran, we can omit them.\n\nThus, the final code should work as intended.\n\nNow, the possible mistakes I could have made.\n\nLet me check the read statements again.\n\nAfter reading 'level2', the code does the array copy and reads the remaining elements. The next read is:\n\nread(*,*) (arr2(i),i=levels+1,level3 )\n\nSo if the next line has exactly level2 numbers, then that's okay.\n\nExample:\n\nLet me say level3 is 5 (levels=3, level2=2). Then the indices for the second read are 4 and 5. The read statement would expect 2 numbers, so if the input has those on the next line, it's correct.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nSo I think the code is correct."
