    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate the given Java code to Fortran. Hmm, the Java code reads a line from standard input, replaces any commas with spaces, and then prints it out. Alright, so in Fortran, how do I handle that?\n\nFirst, the Java code uses BufferedReader to read input. In Fortran, reading from standard input is straightforward with a read statement. But how do I handle strings here. The variable 'a' in Java is a String that holds the input line. In Fortran, I'll need a character variable to store the input. Since the input line might be of varying length, maybe I can use a character array with sufficient length or use a character variable with allocatable length? Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe a fixed length like 1000 would be okay.\n\nThen, replacing commas with spaces. So, in Java's String there's a replace method. In Fortran, I need to loop through each character, check if it's a comma, and replace it with a space. Alternatively, is there a function that can do this replacement? I think in Fortran, you can use the scan function to find commas and then replace each occurrence. Or maybe the edit descriptor or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, a loop approach:\n\nRead the input string into a character array. Iterate over each character:\n\nDo i = 1, len_trim(str)\n   if (str(i:i) == ',') then\n       str(i:i) = ' '\n   end if \nend do \n\nThen output the modified string. That might work.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you read a line, trailing spaces are kept? Or does the read statement trim it? Hmm. Let me check.\n\nThe read statement in Fortran with an asterisk format reads until end of line, I think, but in old-style FORTRAN, but in modern Fortran, maybe with a read(*,*) would read until whitespace, but perhaps using an implied do loop or using a proper format specifier would be better.\n\nAlternatively, the best way to read an entire line is using a character variable with a fixed length and then using the get edit descriptor. Wait, perhaps using the NEW UNIT io methods? Wait, no, in Fortran, perhaps using an intrinsic function:\n\nWait, Fortran 2003 has a get_line for reading from a unit. Oh right, Fortran 90/95 allows using the GET_EDIT from iso_fortran_env module?\n\nWait, maybe better to use read(*, '(A)') to read a line, so that any commas in the line are preserved. Let me think.\n\nFor Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC051_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=1000) :: a\n  integer :: i, n\n\n  read(*, '(A)') a\n\n  n = len_trim(a)\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (a(i:i) == ',') a(i:i) = ' '\n  end do\n\n  print *, trim(a)\n\nend program\n\nWait, but the print *, might add a space or something? Because 'print *, trim(a)' would trim but when using print *, it might add a leading space? Hmm, maybe better to use write statement.\n\nAlternatively: write(*,'(A)') trim(a)\n\nYes. Because 'print *' adds a space, 'write(*,*)' also pads, but using the '(A)' format descriptor would write the string without any modifications except for the actual content.\n\nAlso, the input needs to be read as a line. The format '(A)' in the read statement allows reading the entire line, including whitespace, up to the end of the line. So the first line should read the line into the character variable a. \n\nWait, but the character variable a has a length of 1000. What if the input is longer than that? Then it would be truncated. But the problem might not require handling very long lines. Maybe in the problem constraints, the input is within some limit.\n\nAlternatively, to be safer, we can use an allocatable character array. Wait, in Fortran, to have an unlimited length, perhaps using the kind=1 for Fortran strings?\n\nHmm, assuming the input is okay in 1000, let's proceed. \n\nWait another thing: when using read(*, '(A)'), the variable a must be long enough to hold the input line. So if a is 1000, but the input is longer, it would be an issue. So maybe better to read in a line by line. Maybe Fortran's read statement already handles that, or maybe there is another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the get statement via unit numbers. Or perhaps using the intrinsic functions for reading lines. \n\nWait, maybe using a better way to handle the input. For Fortran, the best method to read a line (from stdin) up to the new line character is to use an allocated string. But for simplicity here, maybe use the fixed length variable.\n\nLet me proceed with the code.\n\nWait in the original code, after replacing commas with spaces, it prints the entire input string with the replacements. So any commas are turned to spaces, but the rest remains.\n\nSo maybe my code:\n\nRead the line into a string, iterate over each character, replacing commas with spaces, then output.\n\nThus the code in Fortran would look like:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: input_line\ninteger :: i, len_line\n\n! Read the line\nread(*, \"(A)\", advance='yes') input_line\n\n! Trim any trailing spaces but not sure\n! Or get the actual length?\nlen_line = len_trim(input_line)\n\ndo i = 1, len_line\n   if (input_line(i:i) == ',') then\n       input_line(i:i) = ' '\n   end if\nend do\n\n! Now print the modified string\nprint *, input_line(1:len_line)\n\n! Or using write to avoid possible leading space from print *\nwrite(*, '(A)') input_line(1:len_line)\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when you use print *, it adds a space before the string? Or just outputs it? Hmm, the print statement with * automatically decides the formatting. To avoid leading spaces, better to use 'write'. \n\nMoreover, the original Java code uses System.out.println, which adds a newline. The Fortran write statement with '(A)' should handle the string properly, and if the string ends with a newline, it would be okay.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the input_line is read via '(A)', which includes everything up to the newline. So the stored input_line would have the newline at the end?\n\nHmm, no, the actual newline is typically not part of the character data. The read statement with format (A) reads until end of record (which is the newline), and the newline character is not included in the string. Wait, in Fortran, the newline is the end of the record, so when you read with (A), the variable is filled with the characters up to but not including the newline.\n\nTherefore, len_trim(input_line) gives the actual number of characters read.\n\nSo when the write happens, it will output the modified string up to the final character, including any trailing spaces if present in the original input (like if the input line ended with a comma).\n\nSo that code should work.\n\nWait, but the original code in Java uses replace(\",\", \" \"), which replaces all commas with spaces, and includes even trailing spaces? For example, if the input is \"a,b,\", it would output \"a b \". The Fortran code here does the same: replaces each comma with a space, which will lead to spaces in those positions. So that's the same.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting:\n\nSample input: \"hello,world\" \u2192 should become \"hello world\".\n\nTesting code: the first 'o,' \u2192 replaced to 'o ', so yes.\n\nEdge cases: input with all commas \u2192 becomes all spaces. Also if there's no commas, the original string is printed.\n\nSo I think this code should work.\n\nWait for the Fortran code's write statement\u2014the 'write' uses '(A)' so it outputs the string as is. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, the write statement with '(A)' for the format automatically outputs the leading and trailing characters properly, so using the substring input_line(1:len_line) will output exactly the characters up to the last non-blank character (since len_trim gives the length of the string as stored), but the substring input_line(1:len_line) will include trailing blanks if the input had any. Wait, but the comma replacement might create trailing spaces. For example, if the input was \"abc,def,ghi\", then after replacement, \"abc def ghi\"\u2014so the len_trim would be the same as original because commas are replaced with spaces but those spaces are part of the string. \n\nWait len_trim returns the length up to the last non-space character in the original string?\n\nWait, len_trim does NOT ignore trailing spaces. Let me check. \n\nThe len_trim function returns the length of the string up to the last non-space. Wait no, wait. len_trim returns the length without trailing spaces. Let me recall.\n\nYes, len_trim(a) gives the length of a without trailing spaces. Wait, is that correct? For example, if a is \"abc \", then len_trim(a) is 3? Or 4? Let me confirm.\n\nTesting in mind:\n\nOriginal variable a has length 4, and contains 'abc ' (with space at 4th char). The len_trim(a) would return 4? Or is the space considered a character?\n\nAh no, len_trim returns the first position from the end which is not a space. Wait no, it's the first non-blank from the end. So for \"abc \", the last character is a space, so len_trim would return 3 because the trailing spaces are considered trailing and are excluded.\n\nWait, no: len_trim is for the length of the string, trimming the trailing spaces.\n\nWait according to Fortran standards, len_trim is the length of the string excluding trailing blanks. But this is only for the trailing blanks after the last non-blank character. \n\nSo in example:\n\nIf the input_line is \" a b  \" (with leading and trailing spaces), len_trim(input_line) would return 3 (the 'a b') if there are two trailing spaces. \n\nTherefore, in our problem, when we replace commas with spaces, that space remains, and when using len_trim, those inserted spaces are not considered trailing unless they are.\n\nBut in the input line, suppose the input was \"a,,b\", which becomes \"a  b\" (with two spaces between a and b). Then len_trim would give the length of \"a  b\" which is 4 (positions 1-4, with two spaces in between), but leading and trailing?\n\nWait, if the string is \"a  b\", then there's no trailing blanks unless the last character is a space. In that example, the last character of the modified string would be 'b', so len_trim would include all.\n\nWait in any case, the code uses the len_trim to process all characters up to the last non-space character of the original line (before replacement). Wait no\u2014 no, after the replacement, the len_trim will be applied to the modified string?\n\nWait, no, in the code:\n\nAfter reading the input line, len_line is the length of the input before any replacement (len_trim(input_line))?\n\nWait the first line is reading into input_line, then len_line is stored as the length before processing, but the code loops over 1 to len_line, then after processing, the modified string's length up to the last character (original's len_line), which may include trailing spaces added by replacement.\n\nWait, here is a potential issue. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the input is \"abc,\" (comma at the end). Then, the original len_trim before processing is 4 (since 'a','b','c',',', and then maybe spaces up to 1000). When we process, the last character (the comma) is replaced with a space, giving \"abc \" as the first 4 characters, but when printed, len_trim(input_line) is now 4 (since the last character is a space). wait no:\n\nWait the original input length is 4 (characters: a, b, c, ,). Wait the comma is the fourth character. So after replacement, that becomes a space, so the input_line(1:4) is \"abc \".\n\nThen the len_trim of input_line would be 4 because the first three characters are non-blank, and the fourth is a space. Wait, but len_trim counts until last non-blank. Wait, the string up to 4 characters is \"abc \" (the fourth character is space). So the last non-blank is position 3. so lenTrim would be 3.\n\nWait, so when I output input_line(1:len_line)... the len_line was the original length (including the comma). So in this example, len_line is 4, so the output would print input_line(1:4), which includes the trailing space. \n\nBut the original problem's Java code uses:\n\nsb.append(a.replace(...)). Then prints that. The original Java code's input \"abc,\" will become \"abc \", and that's what it outputs. So in the Java code, the trailing space is part of the output, which is correct. \n\nBut in Fortran code that uses the original length (the original line's non-trailing space characters length):\n\nBecause the original line (before replacing), the input_line(1:4) would have the comma as the 4th character. Its original len_trim(input_line) (before replacing) can be 4 (assuming after 'abc,' the rest are spaces in the 1000-length string). Then, after replacing comma, the 4th character is a space. So when the code outputs using len_line (which was original 4), so the substring 1:4 is \"abc \" (4 characters including the space). So that should be correct.\n\nBut if the original input was \"abcd\", (without any commas), then len_trim is 4, and the code loops 4 times (checking each character), finding no commas, so the output is \"abcd\", correct.\n\nAnother test case: input \"a,,b\". the original len_trim would be the length of the actual input. Assuming the input is exactly 5 (since \"a,,b\" has 4 characters?), wait \"a,,b\" has four characters: a, comma, comma, b. So original line length is 4. So len_line = 4. The replacements turn the two commas into spaces, so the result is \"a  b\". The loop runs for i=1-4, so all characters. Output is 4 characters, which is \"a b\" with two spaces between.\n\nBecause the first comma (position 2) becomes a space, the second comma (position 3) also becomes a space. Thus, the substring 1-4 is \"a  b\", which is 4 characters, so when written, that is exactly the desired output. And the len_trim of the input after replacement would be 4, but that's not needed because len_line still holds the original length (4).\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nAnother case where the input is \" , \" (whitespace, a comma, whitespace), the original line may have len_trim of 3 (assuming it's read as three characters: space, comma, space). After replacing the comma with space, the string becomes \"   \" (three spaces). So the output is three spaces. The len_line is 3, so it outputs those three spaces. Which is correct, as the Java code would replace the comma with space and keep the others.\n\nAnother case where the input is \"a,b,c\" \u2192 replaced to \"a b c\", printed with spaces as expected.\n\nTherefore the code works.\n\nSo the Fortran code is:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC051_A\n  implicit none\n  character(len=1000) :: str\n  integer :: i, len_str\n\n  ! Read the entire line.\n  read(*, '(A)') str\n  len_str = len_trim(str)\n\n  ! Loop through each character and replace commas with spaces.\n  do i = 1, len_str\n     if (str(i:i) == ',') then\n        str(i:i) = ' '\n     end if\n  end do\n \n  ! Print the modified string, using the actual length to avoid trailing spaces beyond original length.\n  write(*, '(A)') str(1:len_str)\nend program atcoder_ABC051_A\n\nWait, the write statement uses '(A)', which should output exactly the substring we send. The substring is 1 to len_str (original line's trimmed length), so even if the input had trailing spaces, those were not considered in len_str (since len_trim ignores trailing spaces before processing). Wait, here is an edge case. If the original input had a trailing comma, like \"abc, \", then the comma is replaced, and the trailing space is part of the original input.\n\nWait, in the original input, if the input is \"abc, def,\" (with a space after comma at end), then after replacement the comma becomes a space, resulting in \"abc  def \" (the final comma becomes a space, so the last character is a space? Wait:\n\nSuppose the input was \"abc, def,\" (without the quotes). Then the len_trim would be up to the last non-space. If the original ends with a comma followed by spaces, then len_trim(str) would give the position of the last non-space character. Wait, for example, input \"abc, def, \" (with a space after the comma):\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\"abc, def, \" \u2014 assuming that after the comma, there's a space, then another comma, another space? Maybe the input is \"abc, def,\" which is \" a\",\"b\",\"c\",\",\", space, \"d\",\"e\",\"f\",\",\" \u2014 but perhaps an example where the last character is a comma:\n\n input_line(1:9) is a b c , space d e f , space (if it had a comma at end then):\n\nThen len_trim would take the last non-space is the comma (position 9?), but after replacing that comma to space, the last character (position 9) becomes a space, making the total content now having trailing space, which would reduce len_trim?\n\nBut in the Fortran code, we are using the original length (len_str) to output. So the code outputs 9 characters (assuming that the original len_trim was 9), even if after replacing, the trailing becomes space. This is correct, because the Java version replaces all commas with spaces, including trailing commas, so the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nAnother potential issue: What if the input is longer than 1000 characters?\n\nWell, in that case, the variable str is only 1000 characters, so it will be truncated. But perhaps the problem constraints ensure that the input is within that limit, so it's okay for the problem's context.\n\nThus, I believe this code is correct."
