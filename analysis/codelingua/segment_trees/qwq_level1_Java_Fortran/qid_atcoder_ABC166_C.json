    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me see what the code does first. The problem seems to be about counting how many towers (or maybe peaks) are the highest in their connected components? Let me parse through the code step by step.\n\nThe Java code starts by reading N and M. Then it reads an array H of N long integers. It initializes a boolean array ans, all set to true initially. Then for each of M lines, it reads two integers temp1 and temp2. It compares the H values of those two (indices adjusted by -1 because Java is 0-based). Depending on which is taller, it sets the corresponding ans entry to false. If they're equal, both get set to false. Finally, it counts the number of true entries in ans and prints that count.\n\nThe task is to translate this into Fortran. Let me recall Fortran's syntax, especially for input/output, arrays, loops, and logical operations.\n\nFirst, variables: In Java, they have types like int and long, but in Fortran, variables are declared with types like integer and integer*8 for 64-bit. Wait, but in Fortran 90 and later, we can use SELECTED_INT_KIND to specify the kind. However, for simplicity, assuming that the input is within 32-bit or 64-bit, perhaps using INTEGER*8 for H and everything else as integers. But since M can be up to 1e18? Wait, looking at the Java code, M is a long, which is 64-bit. But in the code, M is the number of test cases? Wait no: in the code, N is the first input, M is the next input. Wait, in the problem statement (since it's from an AtCoder contest), but since the code is given as Java, let's stick to the code structure. The code reads N as an integer and then M as a long. So in Fortran, variables for N and M would be of different types? Wait, in Fortran, perhaps we can use integers with appropriate kind parameters.\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\nJava variables:\n\n- N is an int (so 32-bit)\n\n- M is a long (64-bit, since M can be up to 1e18?)\n\n- H is an array of longs.\n\n- ans is a boolean array.\n\nIn Fortran, integer variables can be of different kinds. Let's choose to use INTEGER*8 for M and H array. N can be an integer (since in Java, N is 32-bit, but perhaps it's constrained by the problem to something manageable, so even 32-bit is okay? Probably okay).\n\nLet me start outlining the code structure in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the program should read N and M, then the H array, then process each of the M pairs, then count.\n\nFortran doesn't have built-in Scanner class, but we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements.\n\nBooleans in Fortran can be LOGICAL variables. So the 'ans' array should be a LOGICAL array of size N, initialized to .TRUE. (all true).\n\nLet me plan the steps:\n\n1. Declare variables:\n\n- Declare N as integer (or an integer with sufficient kind, but probably just default integer is fine since N can be up to ... well, the problem constraints probably limit N to say 1e5? Wait the code might not have such a problem here, but given that in Java the array size is N, which in Fortran will be declared after reading N. Hmm, in Fortran, we can't have arrays with sizes known only at runtime unless using allocatable arrays. So H and ans arrays need to be allocatable.\n\nYes, so in Fortran, the H and ans arrays must be declared as allocatable, and their sizes set after reading N.\n\nSo, first, read N and M.\n\nWait, the order:\n\nThe code starts by reading N, then M, then the H array, then the M pairs.\n\nSo structure:\n\nPROGRAM problem\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nINTEGER :: N\nINTEGER(KIND=8) :: M\nINTEGER(KIND=8), DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: H\nLOGICAL, DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: ans\nINTEGER :: i, j, temp1, temp2\nINTEGER :: ans2 = 0\n\n! Read N and M\n\nREAD(*,*) N\nREAD(*,*) M\n\nALLOCATE(H(N))\nALLOCATE(ans(N))\n\n! Then, read H values and initialize ans.\n\nDO i = 1, N\n   READ(*,*) H(i)\n   ans(i) = .TRUE.\nEND DO\n\n! Then process each of the M pairs:\n\nDO j = 1, M\n   READ(*,*) temp1, temp2\n   ! Now compare H(temp1-1), H(temp2-1) in Java's 0-based, but here, since Fortran uses 1-based arrays, need to adjust.\n\nWait, in Java, the temp1 and temp2 are 1-based? Because in the code, they subtract 1 from each to get 0-based indices. So in Fortran, since arrays are 1-based by default, then if the input is 1-based, then we can directly use them, but we still have to subtract 1? Or wait, let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the user inputs temp1 and temp2, which are 1-based indices (assuming the input is 1-based). Because the code in the loops does temp1-1 and temp2-1 to get the indices into the arrays (since arrays in Java are 0-based).\n\nIn the Fortran code, arrays are 1-based, so when you have temp1 and temp2 from the input (which are 1-based?), you can use them directly. Wait but the Java code subtracts 1 from them to make them 0-based, but in Fortran's 1-based arrays, the indices would just be the same as the input numbers.\n\nSo in this case, for the indices in Fortran, we don't need to adjust (since in the code, the user's input for the path is 1-based, which maps directly to Fortran's array indices).\n\nWait, but in the problem's context, the nodes (towers) are probably numbered starting from 1, so the user inputs temp1 and temp2 which are 1-based indices into the H array. So in Fortran, we can use temp1 and temp2 directly as indices (since arrays are 1-based). So no need to subtract.\n\nSo proceeding:\n\nInside the loop for M pairs:\n\ntemp1 and temp2 are integers (since M is the count of these, which is a long, but temp1 and temp2 are the indices)\n\nWait, the inputs for temp1 and temp2 are integers? Yes, since in Java, they are read via nextInt().\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nInside the loop over j from 1 to M:\n\nRead temp1 and temp2.\n\nThen compare H(temp1) versus H(temp2) ?\n\nWait, let me recheck the Java code:\n\nIn Java, for each \"temp1, temp2\" pair:\n\nif (H[temp1 - 1] < H[temp2 - 1]) then ans[temp1 - 1] = false;\n\nElse if H[temp1-1] > ... set the temp2-1 ans to false.\n\nElse set both to false.\n\nSo in Fortran's 1-based array, H(temp1) corresponds to H[temp1-1] in Java.\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, temp1 and temp2 are indices into the H array.\n\nSo comparing H(temp1) and H(temp2):\n\nIf H(temp1) < H(temp2), then set ans(temp1) = .FALSE.\n\nElse if H(temp1) > H(temp2), set ans(temp2) = .FALSE.\n\nElse, set both to .FALSE.\n\nWait, but in the else (equality case), in the Java code, both are set to false. So same in Fortran.\n\nSo the code for this is:\n\nIF (H(temp1) < H(temp2)) THEN\n\nans(temp1) = .FALSE.\n\nELSE IF (H(temp1) > H(temp2)) THEN\n\nans(temp2) = .FALSE.\n\nELSE \n\nans(temp1) = .FALSE.\n\nans(temp2) = .FALSE.\n\nEND IF\n\nWait, but in the Java code, in the else clause ((equal heights), both are set to false. So that's the same here.\n\nThen, after all M pairs are processed, we count the number of ans(i) that are .TRUE.\n\nInitialize ans2 as 0, then loop over each i from 1 to N, add to ans2 when ans(i).\n\nFinally, print ans2.\n\nNow, the main points to consider in Fortran:\n\n- Arrays are allocated after reading N.\n\n- Using proper I/O.\n\n- Dealing with possible large M and N. Let's see, the H array is of size N, and each element is a long (in Java), so in Fortran I'll use 8-byte integers (INTEGER*8 or SELECTED_INT_KIND(18)), but for this code, simply using INTEGER*8 for H may be sufficient.\n\nVariables:\n\ntemp1 and temp2 are integers. Since they are indices, they can be 32-bit, so just INTEGER in Fortran (typically 4 bytes, but maybe the problem constraints allow it).\n\nNow, possible code outline:\n\nPROGRAM main\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: N, i, j, temp1, temp2, ans2 = 0\n  INTEGER(KIND=8) :: M\n  INTEGER(KIND=8), ALLOCATABLE :: H(:)\n  LOGICAL, ALLOCATABLE :: ans(:)\n\n  READ(*,*) N\n  READ(*,*) M\n  ALLOCATE(H(N), ans(N))\n  \n  DO i = 1, N\n     READ(*,*) H(i)\n     ans(i) = .TRUE.\n  END DO\n\n  DO j = 1, M\n     READ(*,*) temp1, temp2\n     IF (H(temp1) < H(temp2)) THEN\n        ans(temp1) = .FALSE.\n     ELSE IF (H(temp1) > H(temp2)) THEN\n        ans(temp2) = .FALSE.\n     ELSE\n        ans(temp1) = .FALSE.\n        ans(temp2) = .FALSE.\n     END IF\n  END DO\n\n  ans2 = 0\n  DO i = 1, N\n     IF (ans(i)) ans2 = ans2 + 1\n  END DO\n\n  PRINT*, ans2\n\n  DEALLOCATE(H, ans)\n\nEND PROGRAM main\n\nHmm, that looks okay.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the input for temp1 and temp2 is read with READ(*,*), which expects those to be on the same line as two integers. Since in Java's Scanner, sc.nextInt() reads tokens, so the same in Fortran: the input for each line of the M pairs should be two integers separated by whitespace.\n\nPotential issues?\n\n- What if the inputs for temp1 or temp2 are beyond the array size? Well, the problem constraints probably ensure that, so the code doesn't need handling that.\n\n- Indexing: The problem input's nodes are numbered starting at 1, so in Fortran's 1-based arrays, the indices will be correct.\n\nWait the Java code uses temp1-1 and temp2-1 because the arrays are 0-based, so in Fortran's 1-based arrays, no need to subtract, which matches above code.\n\nAnother consideration: in the equality case, both ans(temp1) and ans(temp2) are set to false. That must be done correctly in the ELSE block.\n\nTesting possible scenarios: Suppose H(temp1) equals H(temp2). Then both are set to false, so even if another pair later includes one of them, etc.\n\nAnother thing: the counting loop. The code initializes ans2 as 0, then counts the .TRUE. entries.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when M is a big number, like up to 1e5 or 1e6? Well, Fortran can handle this.\n\nNow, is there any chance that in some versions of Fortran, the READ statement requires a format? For example, when reading N, if N is an integer, using a list-directed read (the * in the read statement) should be okay.\n\nIn modern Fortran (90/95), the list-directed input with (*) is standard.\n\nWhat about possible typos, like ans2 starting at zero? Yes, yes.\n\nWait in the code, in the loops, the DO loops:\n\nIn the M loop, variables temp1 and temp2 are read each iteration.\n\nWhat about deallocating H and ans array? That's done at the end.\n\nBut the program will exit after printing, so perhaps not necessary, but it's good practice.\n\nAnother thing: variable declarations.\n\nMake sure all variables are declared before use.\n\nIn the code outline above, variables are N (integer), M (8-byte), H (array of 8-byte integers, allocatable), ans (allocatable logical array), temp variables temp1, temp2 (integers), and ans2 (integer, initialized to zero?).\n\nWait, in Fortran, initial values: for ans2, initializing with =0 is okay as in:\n\nINTEGER :: ans2 = 0\n\nYes.\n\nPutting it all together, the code seems correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran translation is as outlined."
