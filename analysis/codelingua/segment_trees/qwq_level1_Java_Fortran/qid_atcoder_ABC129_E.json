Wait maybe confusion between the indices. Let me think. Let me reindex variables. Java loop: for (int i=0; i < n; i++)\n\neach i corresponds to s[i], which is character at position i in the input string (Java's string is 0-based). In Fortran, the input_str(1) is first character, so when we loop over Fortran's i from 1 to n, that corresponds to Java's i = i_f - 1, where i_f is the Fortran's loop variable (starting at 1).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main thing here is a dynamic programming (DP) solution. The code reads a string of characters, then uses a DP array to track some states. The variables are dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], probably indicating different states. The modulus M is 1e9+7, which is common in competitive programming to handle large numbers.\n\nLooking at the code's structure: the Java program has a main method, reads input with Scanner, processes the string, sets up DP tables, loops through each character, updates the DP tables based on whether the current character is '0' or '1', and finally outputs the sum of the two states modulo M.\n\nNow converting this to Fortran. First, Fortran uses modules and subroutines. Variables are declared with specific types, and array indices start at 1 unless specified. Let's note the differences:\n\nIn the Java code:\n- The Scanner is used to read from input. In Fortran, I can use read(*,*) for input. The string will be read as a character array. Since Fortran strings can be handled with character arrays, I need to read a line from stdin and store it as a character array.\n- The DP array is 2D: dp[n][2], but in Fortran, arrays are declared with upper and lower bounds. Since Java uses 0-based indices, the Fortran array might need to be declared from 0 to n (but Fortran can also use 1-based). Wait, but the current setup: the method initializes dp[0][0] =1, so perhaps the first dimension is from 0 to n (inclusive), and the second is 0 to 1.\n\nWait, in the original code, int dp[][] is of size (n+1)x2. So dp(0, 0) is initialized as 1. The loop runs for each i from 0 to n-1, processing each character. For Fortran, perhaps declaring the DP as a 2D array with dimensions (0:n, 0:1) would be better. But Fortran by default starts at 1, so need to adjust the declaration with the lower bounds. Let me note that variables in Fortran arrays can have ranges. \n\nNext step: setting up the modules and program structure. \n\nThe Java code uses System.out.println. In Fortran, printing is done via write statements. Also, modulus operations can be handled with mod function.\n\n\nPotential steps:\n\n1. Read input: The input is a single string, which can be stored as a character array. In Fortran, the string can be read as a character array (allocatable?) or with fixed size. The length can be determined by the input.\n\nHowever, note that in Fortran, to read a line (including possible spaces if any, but here the input is a single string with no spaces between characters), perhaps using a character variable with asterisks. Wait: to read the entire line, read *, s(1:n). But if the input might have leading or trailing whitespaces, but in coding contest problems, generally input is exactly the string required. \n\nWait the Java code uses sc.nextLine().toCharArray(). So the Fortran code should read the entire line as a string, then convert each character into an array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran:\n\nread(*,'(a)') string\nn = len_trim(string)\n\nthen allocate s(n), or declare as a fixed size. Alternatively, since the problem may have a maximum input length (assuming the problem constraints are not given, but in coding contests, the input is read normally), we can read the line into a character variable, then process each character.\n\nSo first:\n\nImplicit None (required for proper declarations)\n\nThen variables:\n\ninteger, parameter :: M = 1000000007\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\ninteger, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: dp\netc.\n\nWait, but the DP array size depends on n. So first we need to read the string, get its length, then allocate the DP array. \n\nSo perhaps the structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc129_e\n  implicit none\n  integer, parameter                      :: M = 1000000007\n  character(len=:), allocatable           :: s\n  integer                                 :: n\n  integer, allocatable, dimension(:,:)    :: dp\n  integer                                 :: i, c, left, right, etc? Wait need to think.\n\nWait let's think in code steps.\n\nFirst read the string:\n\nread(*,'(a)',advance='no') s\n\nNo, 'advance' might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps using a fixed length buffer that's sufficient. Since in coding contests the input is typically one line, and the character length isn't more than n where n can be up to maybe 1e5 or sth. But since the problem's code uses n as s.length which is up to maybe 1e5, but the problem's parameters aren't specified here. Anyway, to read the whole line, in Fortran 2003 (but maybe using earlier standard) can do:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread(*,'(a)') s\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nThat's a safer way.\n\nThus code:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread(*, '(a)') s\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nThen, allocate the dp array. The dp array in Java is size [n+1][2], so in Fortran, the dimensions would be (n+1,2), and indices would be from 1 to n+1 in the first dimension (since it's n+1 elements starting at 0 in Java). Wait but the original code in Java uses dp[0][0] =1, so maybe it's easier to align that.\n\nWait in Java, the dp array is initialized as new int[n+1][2]. So in Fortran, to have similar indices, we can have the first dimension as 0:n, but Fortran arrays are by default 1-based, so we need to adjust:\n\ndimension(n+1, 2) :: dp \u2192 but then dp(1,:) corresponds to dp[0] in Java. Alternatively, when using allocatable arrays, can set the lower bounds via ALLOCATE with the bounds. \n\nAlternatively, to use 1-based, perhaps the code needs to adjust the indices accordingly. \n\nHmm, here is a problem. Let me see the loop structure:\n\nThe loop in Java is for (int i = 0; i <n; i++).\n\nThe dp is processed up to i+1, because for each character in the string (s[i]), which is index 0 to n-1 in Java. So the DP array in Fortran would have first dimension from 0 to n, but in Fortran, if we have to use 1-based, then:\n\nInitialize dp(1,1) =1 (since dp[0][0] is the first element). But maybe it's better to use 0-based array indices. \n\nWait, in Fortran you can declare arrays with lower bounds. For example:\n\ninteger :: dp(0:n, 0:1)\n\nBut how to do that when n is determined at runtime. So for that, allocatable arrays with specified bounds:\n\nallocate(dp(0:n,0:1))\n\nYes, so in Fortran:\n\nAfter computing n from the input length, then:\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:, :) :: dp \n\nthen allocate( dp(0:n, 0:1) )\n\nThat could work. \n\nSo proceeding:\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc129_e\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n    character(len=100000), dimension(:), allocatable :: s ! Wait, no. Alternatively, use a character array of length n. Wait:\n\nAlternatively, read into a character array. Wait perhaps better:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: input_str ! say, to hold the input string up to 1e5 chars or so.\n\nRead the input into it as:\n\nread(*,'(a)') input_str\nn = len_trim(input_str)\ninteger, allocatable :: dp(:,:) \n\nallocate( dp(0:n, 0:1) ) \u2192 that's 0-based indexing.\n\nInitialize dp(0,0) =1, others to zero?\n\nIn java, dp is initialized to all zeros, except dp[0][0]=1. So in fortran, first set all elements to zero then set dp(0,0)=1. \n\nWait in Java, the dp array is created as new int[n+1][2], so all elements 0 except as set.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nAfter allocation, we can initialize dp to zero, then set dp(0,0)=1. \n\nBut maybe the allocation would set them to zero? Not sure. Better to be explicit.\n\nEither:\n\ndo i=0, n\n\n   dp(i, 0) =0\n\n   dp(i,1) =0\n\nend do\n\nthen dp(0,0)=1.\n\nBut in Java, that array is initialized to zeros except dp[0][0]. So the same in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran allocation may initialize to zero, but better to set all to zero and then set the initial value.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\ndp = 0\n\ndp(0,0) =1\n\nYes, in fortran, if dp is an array, dp =0 sets all elements to zero.\n\nWait in fortran, after allocation, variables are not initialized, so need to set them to zero first. \n\nThus:\n\nallocate(dp(0:n, 0:1))\n\ndp =0\n\ndp(0,0)=1\n\nSo that's good.\n\nThen, loop over the characters. The string stored in input_str, so we need to read each character.\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: s_str \u2192 wait. The input_str contains the entire string. The actual string's characters can be accessed via input_str(1:n).\n\nWait, yes. For each character in the string:\n\ndo i =0,n-1\n\n   c_char = input_str(i+1:i+1)\n\n   (process that character)\n\nBecause the Java code's loop is \"for (int i = 0; i <n; i++)\", so i goes from 0 to n-1. The j loop variables move from i to i+1 in the DP.\n\nBut the Fortran uses a similar loop. So in the loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n \n\n   (processing the i-th character in input_str(1:n))\n\nWait, but the indices in Java's for loop variable i is from 0 (Java's string starts at 0), so in Fortran, since the string is from 1 to n, in the loop variable for the Fortran code, the current character at step i (1-based in Fortran) would correspond to the Java's i-1. Wait maybe confusion between the indices. Let me think.\n\nLet me reindex variables.\n\nJava loop: for (int i=0; i < n; i++)\n\neach i corresponds to s[i], which is character at position i in the input string (Java's string is 0-based).\n\nIn Fortran, the input_str(1) is first character, so when we loop over Fortran's i from 1 to n, that corresponds to Java's i = i_f - 1, where i_f is the Fortran's loop variable (starting at 1).\n\nHence, in the Fortran code's loop over the characters, a loop from i_f =1 to n:\n\ncharacter c = input_str(i_f). \n\nThen, for each step, processing this character, and updating the DP.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i_f =1, n\n\n   c_char = input_str(i_f)\n\n   ... \n\nthen processing. \n\nNow, now in the code, the loop variables correspond between Java's i (0-based) and Fortran's i_f (1-based).\n\nInside each iteration, need to process based on c_char being '0' or '1'.\n\nLet me see the transitions in the Java code:\n\nThe code for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif s[i] == '0':\n\n    compute dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nthen there is an if-else block again? Wait, looking into the code after the first if:\n\nWait in the original code:\n\nAfter the first check of if (s[i] == '0'), there is another block. Wait the code:\n\nfor each i:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n    dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\n} else {\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1}) % M;\n\n}\n\nthen, after that, there\u2019s another if-else block (the original code has a second set of ifs?)\n\nLooking at the original code's Java code:\n\nWait here is the code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0];\n        dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1];\n    } else {\n        dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1]) % M;\n    }\n\n    if (s[i] == '0') {\n        // Changes to dp[i+1][1]\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n    } else {\n        dp[i+1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n        dp[i+1][0] %= M;\n        dp[i+1][1] %= M;\n    }\n}\n\nWait that's a bit tricky. The first part sets certain dp entries, then the second part does adjustments. Both conditions depend on the character's value, but the code uses two separate if blocks for the same condition (s[i] is '0'.\n\nWait, that looks like there are some redundant checks. Let me see the logic.\n\nFirst, check if the current character is '0', then set the next's 0 and 1 states to be the current's. If not, then the next's 1 state (only?) is the sum of previous 0 and 1 mod M.\n\nThen, another conditional (again on the character being 0) adds some multiplier terms to the current dp. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nSo perhaps the code could be reorganized, but for translation, need to follow it exactly.\n\nFirst part:\n\nif (char is '0')\n\nthen set dp[i+1][0] = current\u2019s 0 and dp[i+1][1] = current\u2019s 1.\n\nElse:\n\nset the current's 0+1 to the next's 1.\n\nThen, separately check if the char is '0' again. Then:\n\nIf the char is '0':\n\n   (the first part has already set the next's 1, now we do additions to the next 1: add dp[i][1] * 2 mod M, then mod M again.\n\nElse:\n\n   add (2 * current 0) to next's 0, and add (2 * current 1) to next's 1 (with mod applies)\n\nBut all with mod M.\n\nWait the first block might have initialized part of the dp[i+1], and the second block appends additional terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining the conditions:\n\nSo in summary, during the loop for each i:\n\nfirst part:\n\nif the current character (s[i]) is '0':\n\n   first:\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse:\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1}) mod M.\n\nThen, second part:\n\nif this character is '0', then:\n\n    d1 = (dp[i][1] * 2)\n\n    sum1 = (d1 + dp[i+1][1]) mod M\n\n    dp[i+1][1] = sum1 mod M (but already mod is applied)\n\nWait second part steps:\n\nIn the second if block (if '0'):\n\nthe code says:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1]*2 %M) \u2192 the value is added mod M, then mod again.\n\nWait the code:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += ( (dp[i][1] *2 ) mod M )\n\nthen mod again.\n\nThis is equivalent to dp_new = (current_val + (term mod M)) mod M. Which is the same as adding the term and then mod M again.\n\nAlternatively, the order of operations may have to be precise.\n\nNow, for each loop in Fortran, we need to:\n\n- get the current character (input_str(i_f)), say 'c'\n\n- compute the first part (the first if-else):\n\nif c is '0' (character comparison in Fortran: using ICHAR or comparing as characters)\n\nElse, compute the second path.\n\nThen compute the second block of if-else again based on c.\n\nWait, perhaps code outline for the loop:\n\nLoop i_f from 1 to n:\n\n   c = input_str(i_f)\n\n   temp0 = dp[i_f-1][0]\n\n   temp1 = dp[i_f-1][1]\n\n   then compute next_dp0 and next_dp1 based on first part.\n\n   Then, when first/if conditions, assign next_dp0 and next_dp1 accordingly.\n\n   So let me code variables for first and second blocks:\n\n   For the first part:\n\n   if (c == '0') then\n\n       next_dp0 = temp0\n\n       next_dp1 = temp1\n\n   else\n\n       next_dp1 = mod(temp0 + temp1, M)\n\n       next_dp0 = 0? Or keep what it was? Wait in the first code block's else clause: only the next_dp1 is set?\n\nBecause in the first block (the first if-else), the else case (character is 1?), then the first part of the code only sets the next_dp1 to the sum, but next_dp0 is not set here. Wait wait:\n\nIn Java:\n\nelse {\n    dp[i+1][1] = ( ... )%M;\n}\n\nThat's, the first block sets next_dp[1] based on whether the current character is 0 or 1.\n\nThus, the first block leaves dp[i+1][0] unchanged? No. Because in Java, if the first condition (c is 1), then the first block's else clause only affects dp[i+1][1], leaving dp[i+1][0] as zero (initially if the first block didn't set, but in Java earlier steps: before this part of the code, had we set anything?\n\nAh right! The DP array is initially all zeros, except dp[0][0]=1.\n\nEarlier in the loop, when the first block (for first if condition):\n\nif (c is '0', then they set dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] = current values. So the first block is setting both entries.\n\nBut if c is '1', then the first else clause only sets dp[i+1][1] to the sum, keeping dp[i+1][0] as current?\n\nWait, no, because the else clause doesn't mention dp[i+1][0], but since everything else is initialized as 0, so if the first code's else clause is run, then the next_dp0 (dp[i+1][0]) remains as 0 (from dp allocation initial)?\n\nWait no. Wait, actually, the first code is written as:\n\nThe first code's first block (if s[i] is '0') sets both dp[i+1][0] and [1] to the current's. But the else (s[i] not zero) block only explicitly sets dp[i+1][1], but leaves dp[i+1][0] as whatever? \n\nWait in Java, the variables are initialized to zero. So in the first part of code: else block, since only dp[i+1][1] is set here, the next_dp0 remains what?\n\nAssume that the first block leaves the non-set parameters to the original zero (as per the prior steps? Wait, but before the first if clause, the dp[i+1] was all zero. Because in the iteration:\n\nWe start processing i, then in each step, the first part is handling the first assignment (either via if-0 block, else, or nothing. Wait let me think:\n\nThe structure is for each i,\n\n- First, check s[i] and do the first assignments\n\n- Then, check again s[i] and do additions.\n\nThus for the first part (the first if block):\n\nIf it's '0', then dp[i+1][0] is set to dp[i][0], dp[i+1][1] is set to dp[i][1].\n\nElse, only dp[1] is set. The 0 remains as 0 (since we didn't overwrite it). Because the first part of code didn't set dp[i+1][0], then later steps may overwrite.\n\nWait yes: in the case where s[i] is '1' (else clause):\n\nafter the first block, the first part of code:\n\nonly dp[1] is set. The dp[0] (source is dp[i][0]?) no. Wait:\n\nThe first else clause\u2019s line in the first block:\n\nsets dp[i+1][1] to (0+1\u2019s current) sum. And the rest (db[i+1][0] remains 0 (previously it's all 0). Because these variables were not set.\n\nThen, in the second part of the code: the next if-else.\n\nWait the second part (the second if block):\n\nAssume first, for the second part, if c is '0':\n\nthen, the code adds (2 * current 1) to dp[1] (the next's). \n\nBut perhaps the variables after the first part might not be set in a certain way.\n\nWait perhaps to handle the first block and second block properly, the best way is to represent each step as variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran code, for each iteration, I can represent both chunks as first and second parts.\n\nAlternatively, I'll need to track the intermediate values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to break down the code into variables for better understanding.\n\nBut perhaps let me try to map the code logic step by step.\n\nFirst part (the first if block):\n\nif (c is '0'):\n\n   next_dp0 = current 0\n\n   next_dp1 = current 1\n\nelse:\n\n   next_dp1 = (current 0 + current 1) mod M\n\n   next_dp0 remains 0 (but it was not set here, but the prior was 0. Or Not? The next_dp0 is an accumulation from previous.\n\nWait, perhaps variables next_dp0 and next_dp1 are initialized based on first part. But if the first part\u2019s block (else) sets only next_dp1, then the next_dp0 would be zero (original zeroes).\n\nThen in the second part of the code, the code may add values to those variables.\n\nWait for example, second part (third and fourth blocks ):\n\nSecond part (second if block):\n\nif (c is 0):\n\n   The code adds (2 * current 1 ) mod M to dp[i+1][1]. \n\n   Because:\n\n      dp[i+1][1] += ( (dp[i][1] * 2) mod M )\n\n   then mod again.\n\nElse:\n\n   add (2 * current 0) to dp[i+1][0]\n\n   add (2 * current 1) to dp[i+1][1]\n\nSo in code terms, for the second part:\n\nthe code has an if (c='0') block or else:\n\nThus, combining both the first and second parts:\n\nfor each character c:\n\nFirst, compute first block, which may set next_dp values.\n\nSecond, add to these values via the second block's condition.\n\nThe order is important here: first set the next values via the first block, then add the delta based on second block.\n\nThus, the steps can be modeled as:\n\nfirst, compute first_part_dp:\n\nthen compute delta based on second block, and add to first_part_dp.\n\nThe initial assignment from first part is then added (or the additions) based on the second.\n\nWait no, in the code, the first block 'sets' the initial value (e.g., for first part's else (char = '1'), only the next_dp[1] gets the sum of previous, and next_dp[0] remains at zero (since before anything was set, that's the initial value).\n\nWait but in Java:\n\nSuppose previous was initialized to zero. For the first block (if part):\n\nE.g., if character is '0', the dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] are set to previous's 0 and 1.\n\nThen, in the second block (if the character is 0's condition again), dp[i+1][1] gets += 2 * previous's1 (current DP[i][1} ?\n\nWait in code:\n\n       dp[i+1][1] += ( dp[i][1] * 2 ) mod M; \n\nThus, the code modifies the value set by first_block.\n\nSo combining first and second parts for '0':\n\nif first part was set because '0':\n\nthen first part already had dp[i+1][1] = previous's 1.\n\nIn the second block's this '0' case, we add 2* previous's 1 mod M. \n\nHence the new value (before adding):\n\nprevious's1 (from first block) + (2* previous's1 mod M). \n\nWait but first part's first assignment was to dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]. Then, in second block, adding (2*dp[i][1] mod M), so total would be dp[i+1][1] becomes:\n\n( dp[i][1] + 2 * dp[i][1] ) mod M \u2192 but since mod is applied before each addition, but the order matters.\n\nWait how exactly is this done:\n\nThe code in Java does:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += ( (dp[i][1] *2) % M )\n\nthen:\n\ndp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst, compute temp = (dp[i][1]*2 ) % M\n\nthen, the current value of dp[i+1][1] (from first block's assignment) added to temp \u2192 new value.\n\nthen mod again.\n\nHence the final value would be (previous assignment + temp) mod M.\n\nSo overall, it's:\n\nvalue = ((assignment from first part) + temp) % M.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nthe logic is:\n\nFor each character c in the string:\n\n   temp0_prev = dp[i][0]\n\n   temp1_prev = dp[i][1]\n\n   then, first block:\n\n   if (c == '0') then:\n\n       next_dp0 = temp0_prev\n\n       next_dp1 = temp1_prev\n\n   else:\n\n       next_dp1 = (temp0_prev + temp1_prev) mod M\n\n       next_dp0 = 0.\n\n   end if\n\n   But actually, if else block (for '1'), then next_dp0 remains potentially 0 (if not set in first step). Wait since the first block only sets some variables.\n\nWait, in the first block's else clause (c is '1'), the code sets next_dp1 to sum mod M, but leaves next_dp0 to whatever it was (probably the first 0). Thus, the next_dp0 for '1' is zero.\n\nBut in that case, then in the second part of codes, if '1', then adds to the next_dp0 (which is 0) the 2 * temp0_prev mod M, so in that case, next_dp0 becomes (0 + (2 * temp0_prev mod M)) mod M.\n\nBut in Fortran to do that it's better to compute first the first step variables, then compute the second step variables adding or using previous.\n\nAlternatively, compute for the entire first block and mid-block processing.\n\nWait, considering that:\n\nThe variables next_dp0 and next_dp1 are temporarily stored, then their modifications in the second block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps best to separate the processing steps.\n\nLet me think through the code for the two code parts.\n\nFirst, for first block part, store temporary variables for the first assignments.\n\nThen, handle the second block part.\n\nAlternatively, code flow for each character:\n\nInitialize first_dp0 and first_dp1 as the first part's computation.\n\nthen:\n\nthen apply the second part's modification based on the character, adding to first_dp0 and first_dp1, then mod with M.\n\nWait no: the first_dp is the value after first block.\n\nThe second block of code (second condition) adds some values *after* the first block's computation.\n\nHence:\n\nthe code actually:\n\nfor each i_f (current character):\n\nfirst compute first_dp0 and first_dp1 via first block.\n\nthen compute the second block's delta:\n\n   if (char is '0'):\n\n      delta0 =0, delta1 = (2 * temp_prev1) mod M \u2192 to add to first_dp1.\n\n   else:\n\n      delta0 = (2 * temp_prev0 mod M) \u2192 adds to first_dp0.\n\n      delta1 = (2 * temp_prev1 mod M \u2192 add to first_dp1.\n\n   then:\n\n   first_dp0 += delta0\n\n   first_dp1 += delta1\n\n   then mod both by M.\n\nHence after both steps, the final values of the current DP would be:\n\n   final_dp0 = (first_dp0 + delta0) mod M,\n\n   final_dp1 = (first_dp1 + delta1) mod M.\n\nWait perhaps that's a better way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute first the first block's assignments to next0 and next1 (first_dp0 and first_dp1), then applying the second part's deltas:\n\nSo, for each iteration, the steps are:\n\ntemp0 = dp_prev[0]\n\ntemp1 = dp_prev[1]\n\n// first block processing:\n\nif (char is '0'):\n\n    first_dp0 = temp0\n\n    first_dp1 = temp1\n\nelse:\n\n    first_dp0 = 0  (or previous may be zero?)\n\nNo. Wait first block's:\n\nIn first block 'else' (char is '1'), first_dp1 is (temp0 + temp1) mod M.\n\nfirst_dp0 remains? Or is it set to 0 or whatever?\n\nWait the first block in the 'else' clause only sets first_dp1 to the sum. The first_dp0 is not set here. Wait no, the code in the Java first block else clause only sets dp[i+1][1], so the first0 is set in the previous step or ?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the Java code.\n\nJava's first block:\n\nif else of the first condition:\n\nif (s[i] == '0') {\n\n   dp[i+1][0] = dp[i][0]\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][1]\n\nelse {\n\n   dp[i+1][1] = (dp[i][0] + dp[i][1}) % M;\n\n}\n\nIn the first case (s[i] is '0'), both are set. In the else case (s[i is '1'), only dp[i+1][1] is being set, the dp[i+1][0] (for next index) remains whatever it was before.\n\nWait but in the code's initial setup, the dp array starts as all zero. So before that:\n\nAt the next step (before the first part), the dp[i+1] is 0,0. The first block's else clause only sets the first_dp[1] to the value of (sum), and leaves dp[0] (the first of the new step) at 0? So the first_dp0 for the next step (first block computation), would be zero (as set in the else case)?\n\nWaitYes. Thus after first_block:\n\nif character is '0', first_dp0 is temp0, first_dp1 is temp1.\n\nelse: first_dp0 is 0 (since it was not set during else), and first_dp1 is sum.\n\nThen, the second part (second section of code) will compute whether to add deltas.\n\nWait perhaps the first_dp0 and first_dp1 are set based on first block's code, then in the second block's code (the second if block):\n\nThe delta terms are computed, then added to the first_dp terms.\n\nLet me recast the logic with variables for first_dp:\n\nLet first_dp0 and first_dp1 be the values after first block.\n\nSecond block is:\n\nif (char == '0):\n\n    first_dp1 = (first_dp1 + (2 * temp1) mod M) mod M\n\nelse:\n\n    first_dp0 += (2* temp0 mod M mod M ?\n\nWait the code:\n\n       if (s[i] == '0') {\n\n            dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n            dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n\n        } else {\n\n            dp[i + 1][0] += (dp[i][0] * 2) % M;\n\n            dp[i + 1][1] += (dp[i][1] * 2) % M;\n\n            dp[i + 1][0] %= M;\n\n            dp[i + 1][1] %= M;\n\n        }\n\nSo the first block's first_dp components are as described. Then the second section's code adds either a term to the first_dp1 (if char is 0), or adds deltas to both first_dp0 and first_dp1.\n\nThus, after the second part block (the second if-else):\n\nIf char is '0':\n\n    delta1 = (temp_prev *2) mod M (where temp_prev is the original temp1 from before first block? Or is it temp1 is current dp[i][1} or the previous previous's? \n\nWait the code for '0' in the second block:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (dp[i][1] *2 ) mod M \u2192 the dp[i][1] is from previous steps.\n\nSo even if in the first block, dp[i+1][1] was set to dp[i][1], adding 2 * dp[i][1], the total would now be:\n\ncurrent d1 (first_dp1) plus this term mod M, then mod again (but it\u2019s written as += ( ... ) then mod.\n\nWait code:\n\ndp[i+1][1] += (term)\n\nthen mod.\n\nThus, the final delta for second block is as such:\n\nIn the second block for '0':\n\ndelta1 = (2 * temp_prev1) mod M \u2192 added to the existing first_dp1 (original temp_prev1).\n\nWait yes, because temp_prev1 is the original dp[i][1], which is the previous step's stored.\n\nThus, after first block, first_dp1 is temp_prev1.\n\nThen, the second part adds 2 * temp_prev1.\n\nThus new_dp1 = (first_dp1 + 2 * temp_prev1 ) mod M.\n\nNow for the second block else (char is '1'):\n\nThen, for first_dp0 (which was zero if char is '1'):\n\nadd 2 * temp0_prev mod M. \n\nSo new_dp0 = (0 + 2*temp_prev0) mod M.\n\nAnd similarly, new_dp1 (which is first_dp1 is temp0 + temp1 (from first block's else clause) \u2192 then add (2 * temp_prev1 mod M):\n\ntotal new_dp1 = (first_dp1 + 2*temp_prev1 mod M) \u2192 mod M.\n\nAdditionally, the code also mod both after adding.\n\nSo putting this together, it can be represented by calculating the first_dp and delta based on the character and current temp0, temp1, then.\n\nSo returning to Fortran:\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ntemp0 = dp[i][0]\n\ntemp1 = dp[i][1]\n\n(i is in Fortran the current index? Let me clarify.\n\nIn the Fortran code, for each i_f (from 1 to n):\n\nprocessing the i_f-th character.\n\nThe current dp values are from the previous step's (i_f-1)-th index.\n\nTherefore, for iteration i_f:\n\nthe previous state (i == current step's i_f-1) has:\n\ntemp0 = dp( i_f-1, 0 )\n\ntemp1 = dp( i_f-1, 1 )\n\nNow:\n\nFirst processing block (first condition):\n\nif (c == '0') \n\nthen:\n\n first_dp0 = temp0\n\n first_dp1 = temp1\n\nelse:\n\n first_dp0 = 0 (or not? No, first_dp0 is undefined, but in original code's else branch:\n\n in first else block for \"1\", first_dp0 is just 0 (since no assignment.\n\n first_dp1 = mod( temp0 + temp1, M )\n\nSo first_dp0 remains the default 0. \n\nElse clause sets first_dp1 to sum.\n\nThen the second block (if again c ==0):\n\nNow, for character '0' (scenario 1):\n\nsecond_block:\n\nadd to first_dp1 the value 2 * temp1 mod M.\n\nso new_dp1 = (first_dp1 + 2*temp1) mod M.\n\nno changes to first_dp0 (which was the same as temp0 already).\n\nThus, after second block's processing (for c ==0), the new values for dp(i_f) are:\n\ndp(i_f,0) = first_dp0 (temp0)\n\ndp(i_f,1)= (first_dp1 ( == temp1) + 2* temp1 ) mod Mod \n\nWait?\n\nWait first_dp1 was temp1 (first_dp1 = temp1), then adding (2 * temp1 mod M), so.\n\nSimilarly, in the '0' case:\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nScenario 2: character is '1' in second block (so the second part's else clause):\n\nSecond block's else:\n\ndelta0 = 2* temp0 mod M \u2192 added to first_dp0 (which was 0) \u2192 now delta0.\n\nnew_dp0 = (0 + 2*temp0) mod M \n\ndelta1 = 2 * temp1 mod M \u2192 adding to first_dp1 (which is temp0+temp1, because first_dp1 was set in first block to their sum).\n\nWait first_dp1 for the first block's else was:\n\ntemp0 + temp1.\n\nSo first_dp1 is sum.\n\nAdding delta1 (2* temp1) \u2192 new_dp1 = (temp0+temp1 + 2 * temp1) mod M \u2192 temp0 +3*temp1 mod M.\n\nBut the code says:\n\n     else {\n\n            dp[i + 1][0] = (dp[i+1][0] + (dp[i][0]*2 ) mod M) mod M\n\n            etc.\n\nWait the code first adds, then mods.\n\nSo, for dp[i+1][0] in else (second block), it's:\n\n prior value (from first block, first_dp0 =0 \n\n0 + 2*temp0 \n\nthen mod M \u2192 (0 + 2*temp0) mod M \u2192 that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for new_dp1:\n\n first_dp1 + (2 * temp1 mod M) \n\nthen mod M.\n\nWait first_dp1 is the first block's value of (temp0+ temp1). So:\n\ntotal to add is 2*temp1 mod M).\n\nHence the total new_dp1 = (temp0 + temp1 + 2 temp1) mod Mod \u2192 temp0 + 3 temp_1 mod Mod.\n\nSo all:\n\nNow, let's put this in code.\n\nThe current Fortran code, in each loop over i_f (from 1 to n):\n\nread i_f from 1 to n:\n\ncharacter c = input_str(i_f)\n\ncurrent index is i =i_f-1 (0-based) ?\n\n temp0 = dp( i, 0 )\n\n temp1 = dp( i, 1 )\n\n first_dp0 and first_dp1 variables:\n\nif c == '0'c = '0' then:\n\n first_dp0 = temp0\n\n first_dp1 = temp1\n\nelse:\n\n first_dp0 = 0   ' cause first part's else only sets first_dp1 \n\n first_dp1 = mod( temp0 + temp1, M )\n\nthen compute the second parts.\n\nThen, handle second block: if (c==0 again):\n\nif yes (c is 0):\n\n delta0_2 =0 \n\n delta1_2 = mod( 2 * temp1, M )\n\nthen total_dp0 is first_dp0 (which is temp0)\n\n total_dp1 = first_dp1 + delta1_2 \u2192 mod M.\n\nelse (c is '1):\n\n delta0_2 = mod( 2 * temp0, M )\n\n delta1_2 = mod( 2 * temp1, M )\n\n total_dp0 = first_dp0 + delta0_2 \u2192 mod M \n\n total_dp1 = first_dp1 + delta1_2 \u2192 mod M \n\nThus, the final values for the current (i_f) iteration are:\n\ndp( i_f, 0 ) = mod( total_dp0, M )\n\ndp( i_f, 1 ) = mod( total_dp1, M )\n\nHence, the steps can be encoded in Fortran.\n\nNow, coding this step by step.\n\nIn Fortran, character comparison can be done using .eq. with single quotes.\n\nWe can have variables:\n\ninteger :: temp0, temp1, f_dp0, f_dp1, delta0, delta1, new_dp0, new_dp1.\n\nInside the loop:\n\ndo i_f = 1, n\n\n    c = input_str(i_f:i_f) ! since input_str(1) is first char.\n\n    temp0 = dp(i_f-1, 0)\n\n    temp1 = dp(i_f-1, 1)\n\n    ! first block compute first_dp0 and first_dp1.\n\n    if ( c == '0' ) then\n\n        first_dp0 = temp0\n\n        first_dp1 = temp1\n\n    else\n\n        first_dp0 = 0\n\n        first_dp1 = modulo( temp0 + temp1, M )\n\n    endif\n\n    !

But in code the problem's input characters are '0' or '1'.\n\nAssuming the code is correct for uppercase or lowercase, but probably just '0' and '1' uppercase as in the Java code.\n\nWait the problem's code expects the input as characters '0' and '1', so the Fortran code must read them exactly.\n\nSo in the comparison:\n\nif (c .eq. '0') \u2192 assuming that the input is given as '0', '1' characters. If case is different (e.g., uppercase), but in the problem context likely it's lowercase if required, but since the problem's java code uses '0' and '1' as constants, the fortran code uses same.\n\nNow, finally, output:\n\nresult = ( dp(n,0) + dp(n,1) ) MOD M\n\nprint *, result\n\nThus the program can be written.\n\nAnother thing to note: Fortran's arrays are of fixed size, but in Fortran 90/95, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nCompiling step-by-step variables.\n\nNow code.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the proposed Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc129_e\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: n\n    integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n    integer :: i_f, i_prev\n    character(len=1) :: c\n    integer :: temp0, temp1\n    integer :: first_dp0, first_dp1\n    integer :: delta_dp0, delta_dp1\n    integer :: new_dp0, new_dp1\n    integer :: MOD = M  ! convenient\n\n    !

However, mod is similar but with the same sign as b. I think MOD(a,M) will handle positive results.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nmodulo(a,b) is the same as mod in other languages: returns a mod b in [0,b)\n\nBut the function mod(a,b) in Fortran returns the same sign as a, but modulo has same sign as b. \n\nWait did a quick check: in Fortran:\n\nmod(x, y) has the same sign as x.\n\nmodulo(x,y) has the same sign to y.\n\nThus, when we need to ensure mod(b, M) is between 0 and M-1, so use modulo function rather than mod function.\n\nWait, the variable names delta_dp0 and delta_dp1 variables have been computed with mod(2* temp1, M) \u2192 in code:\n\ndelta_dp1 = mod(2 * temp1, M). \n\nBut if I use 'mod' function here, but perhaps we must use 'modulo'?\n\nHmm yes, because in the Java code, it's using ( ... % M ), ensuring the remainder is positive.\n\nIn Fortran, modulo did the job because modulo with positive M will give between 0 and M-1.\n\nThus, the code must use modulo function.\n\nWait Variables like delta_dp1 = mod( ...) is actually using the wrong function.\n\n Thus in the calculation of delta_dps:\n\nFor example:\n\ndelta_d0 = modulo( 2*temp0, M )\n\nSimilarly, delta_dp1 = modulo( ... )\n\nThe code above uses 'mod' in the if blocks. This is a mistake. \n\nAh, this is an error: in Fortran, to use modulo:\n\n       delta_dp1 = modulo( 2*temp1, M )\n\nOtherwise, if temp1 is 0, then mod is 0, but if temp1 would give something, making sure.\n\nHence need to replace all instances of 'mod' with 'modulo'.\n\n Thus the code has the error there. \n\nReviewing the sections:\n\nFirst block else:\n\nfirst_dp1 = mod(temp0 + temp1, M ) \u2192 should be modulo(),\n\nsecond block:\n\ndelta_dp1 = mod( 2 * temp1, M )\n\ndelta_dp0: mod(2*temp0, M).\n\nSo all 'mod's in this code are incorrect, and should be modulo().\n\nThus the code should be rewritten replacing all mod with modulo.\n\nThus corrected code segments:\n\n    first_dp1 = modulo(temp0 + temp1, M)\n\n    delta_dp1 = modulo(2 * temp1, M )\n\n    delta_dp0 = ...\n\n etc.\n\nSecond stage:\n\n if (c == '0') then:\n\n new_dp1 = modulo( first_dp1 + delta_dp1, M )\n\n else:\n\n new_dp0 = modulo(... )\n\n etc.\n\nYes, the code has to use 'modulo' in the first and second steps.\n\nThus, correcting those parts.\n\nThus here's the corrected version:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc129_e\n    implicit none\n    integer, parameter :: M = 1000000007\n    character(len=100000) :: s\n    integer :: n\n    integer, allocatable :: dp(:,:)\n    integer :: i_f, i_prev\n    character(len=1) :: c\n    integer :: temp0, temp1\n    integer :: first_dp0, first_dp1\n    integer :: delta_dp0, delta_dp1\n    integer :: new_dp0, new_dp1\n    integer :: MOD\n\n    !

But given the problem's constraints, fixed-length array is enough.\n\nAnother possible problem: the first character is accessed via s(1:1), yes.\n\nThe loop from 1 to n will cover all characters.\n\nFinal check, the print statement uses the functions properly.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct Fortran translation."
