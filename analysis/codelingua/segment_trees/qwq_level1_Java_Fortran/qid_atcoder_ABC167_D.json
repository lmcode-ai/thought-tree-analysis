So when K is 2: it's in the pre-cycle? Wait, in the code's terms, the 'b' =0, so cycle starts at b=0. So if K is larger than 0, the formula applies. Thus the code's formulas will work.

Testing that. Now, edge case where K <b ? Say, suppose N=1 (A[0]=0, then the cycle is 0 \u21920. So a and b:\n\nLoop runs with next=0 \u2192 unused, set used[0]=.T., idx(0)=0. next =A(0)=0, then cur increments to 1. Then loop condition (used(0) is .T. \u2192 so loop stops). Thus cur is 1. a=1-0=1, b=0, if K is 0 (assuming allowed?), but K is read as a long, perhaps the problem requires K>=1? Thus, if K=0 (which may not be allowed), then:\n\nif b>K \u2192 0>0 is false? 0 equals. Wait, for K=0:\n\nb=0 \u2192 not greater than 0 \u2192 proceed to else:\n\nremainder = mod( (0-0) + 10000*1 ,1 ) = mod(10000,1)=0 ?\n\nthen ans_index =0 +0 \u21920 \u2192 result is pos(0) +1 =0+1=1, which is correct. Alternatively, if someone enters N=1, K=1.\n\nThen ans:\n\na=1, b=0.\n\n1 is \u2265b (0)\n\nans: mod(10000*1 + (1-0), 1 ) \u2192 mod(10001,1)=0 \u2192 remainder +0 \u21920, so pos(0)+1 is 1. So seems correct. Another test case. Another example:\n\nN=2. A[0]=1, A[1]=0 \u2192 the path is 0 \u21921\u21920\u21921\u2026\n\nThe first loop: Start next=0, used(0)=T, pos(0)=0. cur becomes 1. next is A[0]=1 (not used). Then next =1, which is not used. cur increments to 2. Loop again:\n\nused(1)=T \u2192 idx(1)=1, pos(1)=1. next=A(1)=0 \u2192 yes, now next is 0 \u2192 which is used. Exit loop. cur is 2. \n\n a = cur - idx(next). next is 0.\n\n idx(0) =0 (from first iteration). a =2 -0 =2 \u2192 cycle length 2.\n\n b = idx(next)=0 \u2192 pre cycle length is 0. Thus, for K=3. K is 3 \u22650. So:\n\n10000*a + (3-0) \u219220000+3=20003 \u2192 mod 2 \u2192 20003 mod2 =1.\n\n ans_index =1 +0 =1 \u2192 pos(1) +1 \u21921+1=2? Wait pos[1]",

So position for K=3 is step( 0 (cycle_start?) Wait the cycle starts at 0, so step index for K=3:\n\nsince pre-cycle is 0 steps \u2192 so 3 -0=3, mod 2 \u21921. adds to b (0) \u2192 1: pos(1)=1 \u2192 +1 \u2192 2. Which is correct. The third step (K=3):\n\ntotal steps:\n\nstep0:0 (index0),\n\nstep1:1 (index1),\n\nstep2:0 again (index 2 \u2192 but the loop was cur incremented to 2, so the loop stored up to cur=2 \u2192 pos has indices 0,1,2? Wait in the first example:\n\n cur is set to 2, and the loop exited immediately. Thus the pos(0)=0, pos(1)=1, and pos(2)=0. Then the loop: after A(1)=0 becomes next, which is used (step0 is previously marked), so the loop exits. Thus the pos array goes up to 2. Thus in the K=3:\n\nans_index=1 (the remainder is (3 mod2 \u21921). so 1+0=1 \u2192 which is pos(1)=1, so output 2. Wait but the next step after step1 is 0 ( step2), so step3 would be step2+1 = step3 is position1 \u2192 yes. So correct. Thus code seems correct.",

Let me see example earlier when N=3:\n\nThe path is 0\u21921\u21922\u21920 (cycle of 3). The loop runs until next is 0 again, ending after cur=3. The a = cur - idx[next]. next is 0, so idx[next] =0. So a=3-0=3 \u2192 cycle of 3 steps. b = idx[next] =0, so for K steps beyond b:\n\nthe ans_index is (K -0 mod3)+0 \u2192So K mod3. Thus, for K=5, ans_index is 5 mod3= 2 \u2192 position 2 (which is node 2) \u2192 that's correct. Thus in pos array, indices go up to cur-1 =2, so okay. So answer is pos(ans_index).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's see. First, I'll start by understanding the Java code's structure and what it's doing. \n\nThe Java program is solving some problem, probably from AtCoder's contest. The code takes input values for N and K, then an array A of size N. The main part seems to be tracking a path through the array A, detecting a cycle to compute the answer efficiently, especially since K could be very large.\n\nLooking at the Java code's doIt() method. It uses a Scanner which in Fortran will need to be handled via input statements. The variables MOD, MAX, LMAX, and len are constants. I'll need to define those with appropriate Fortran types. \n\nThe variables declared in the Java class as part of the instance: Scanner sc, MOD, MAX, LMAX, len. Since in Fortran we don't have classes, those constants will need to be module variables or just hard-coded where necessary. But the code only uses the class for that doIt method (since in Java, it's called via main), so maybe in Fortran we can just have everything in a single program block.\n\nThe code starts by reading N and K. Then the A array, which in Java is zero-based. In Fortran, arrays are usually 1-based unless declared otherwise, but here, the code has A starting at 0, so maybe need to either use 1-based with adjustment, or set the array to start at 0. Wait, in Fortran, the default is 1-based, but you can specify with a second dimension parameter. For example, DIMENSION(0: N-1). But Fortran 77 and 90+ have different syntax. Since the user wants the translation to be Fortran, probably using Fortran 90+ syntax.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you declare an array like A(N), it's 1-based from 1 to N. So perhaps when reading elements, they have to be adjusted from the input. The Java code does A[i] = sc.nextInt() -1 because the problem may be 1-based in the input? Not sure, but let me check. The Java code subtracts 1 from the input so that the array A uses 0-based indices. Since the array in Java is 0-based. So in Fortran, maybe it's better to have A as 0-based. So the array declarations need to be with lower bound 0. For example:\n\nINTEGER :: A(0: N-1)\n\nBut in Fortran, when declaring a parameter that depends on N, which is read from input, that requires allocation. Wait, but in Fortran, you can use ALLOCATABLE arrays.\n\nHmm, so maybe the initial approach is:\n\nRead N first, then allocate the arrays as needed. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe Java code reads N, then allocates an array A of N elements. So in Fortran, to handle that:\n\nWe can do something like:\n\nINTEGER :: N\nREAD(*,*) N\nALLOCATE(A(0:N-1))  ! because in Java it's [N] array with indices 0 to N-1\nand so on. \n\nThe next variables are: used (a Set of integers in Java), so in Fortran, that's a flag array, since we can track which positions are used. So used could be an array of LOGICAL or a bitmask. Since N could be large (the original len was 1e6), in Fortran a 1e6-length array may be manageable but needs to be allocated dynamically.\n\nWait, the Java code initializes a Set called used, which presumably tracks visited nodes in the traversal. The arrays idx and pos must be of length N as well, but I need to check the Java variables:\n\nThe variables:\n\nSet<Integer> used; \u2192 a hash set storing which indices have been visited in the path.\n\nint idx[] = new int[N]; \u2192 array of size N.\n\nint pos[] = new int[N]; \u2192 array of size N.\n\nint next = 0, cur =0;\n\nSo in Fortran, I can use:\n\nLOGICAL, ALLOCATABLE :: used(:)\n\nSetting the size to N because the indices can go up to N-1 (since Java's array is size N, and the elements are in 0-based). So the maximum next possible is N-1. Wait, but in the Java code, when you read N elements into A, the next is assigned as A[next], so it can loop through the values in A. However, all elements in A are zero-based (since they are stored as (input -1), hence elements are in the range 0 to N-1). Therefore, the next can only be in that range. So the used array can be declared as DIMENSION(N_max) except that here N is known. So in Fortran:\n\nallocated with N in length (the indices 0 to N-1 would require that the total size is N.\n\nWait, but in Fortran arrays, if the indices are 0-based, then the array needs to be of size 0:N-1. So let me note:\n\nThe array used can be dimensioned from 0 to N-1. So perhaps:\n\nallocate(used(0:N-1)), where N is read and allocated after.\n\nSame for idx and pos arrays.\n\nNow, translating the loop that tracks the path until a cycle is detected.\n\nThe loop is: while used does not contain 'next', so loop adds the next to used. Then:\n\nused.add(next);\nidx(next) = cur;\npos(cur) = next;\nnext = A[next];\ncur++;\n\nThis loop continues until next is already in used. So the path is stored step by step. The idx array records the starting index of the path? Because idx[next] here is set to the current cur (which increments each step). Let me think:\n\nInitially, next is 0. We add it to used, set idx(0) to 0, pos(0)=0. Then next becomes A[0], maybe large? So the loop proceeds until a repeat occurs.\n\nWait, the problem seems like finding the K-th term in a path that loops at some point. \n\nSo the code is following the path starting at 0 (since next was initialized to 0), then jumps to A[0], then A[A[0]], etc. Once the path enters a cycle, it can compute how many steps are in the pre-cycle and cycle lengths to compute where K is in the path.\n\nAfter the loop, the code determines that after reaching the first repeated location (which is stored via the next variable), the cycle length is (current step - idx[next]). Here a and b are computed.\n\nWait, the variables in the Java code:\n\nlong a = (long) cur - idx[next]; \u2192 that's the cycle length.\n\nlong b = (long) idx[next]; \u2192 the length of the pre-cycle part.\n\nThen, ans is computed using (10000 *a + K - b) mod a + b. Wait, why 10000? Maybe that's a placeholder value. Looking back: the problem from AtCoder's ABC167 D is \"problem number ...\" since the class is named \"atcoder_ABC167_D\". Wait, not entirely sure, but perhaps the code is correct, so we just need to translate the code as is. \n\nBut the calculation in the Java code:\n\nans = (int)((10000 *a +K - b) %a +b); \n\nWait, perhaps that was a typo during programming, but the code is given, so need to preserve it.\n\nWait, let's look closer. Original lines:\n\nlong a = (long) cur - idx[next]; \u2192 cycle length is a.\n\nlong b = (long) idx[next]; \u2192 the \"pre-cycle\" length is b?\n\nWait, because when the loop finishes, the next has been encountered before. When we exit the loop, the current 'next' is the first repeated node. The value idx[next] gives the position where this node was first encountered (the loop stored the 'cur' value in idx array each time). So the total steps taken before looping is cur variable, but the cycle starts at idx[next], so the path before the cycle is b = idx[next], then the cycle is from idx[next] to current cur-1, so cycle length is a = cur - idx[next].\n\nHence, the formula for K steps: \n\nIf K is before the cycle, then just take that step.\n\nOtherwise, subtract b (pre-cycle steps), compute the remainder in the cycle and add to the cycle start point.\n\nSo the code uses (K - b) mod a to find the offset from the cycle start, but the (10000*a) might be to handle negative numbers (since mod can be negative if K - b is negative, but since K is the input, if the problem requires K >=1, then that may not be needed. Wait, but what if K is smaller than b? Then the code checks:\n\nif (b > K) then ans is K. So else, the formula is applied.\n\nHence, the ans becomes (K - b) mod a + b. Wait but Java's modulo can give negative results if a is positive and (K -b) is negative, but since the condition is b > K, that is handled, so that part is only calculated when K >= b. But modulo in Fortran is also tricky, but perhaps in Fortran we can write modulo or adjust to have it positive.\n\nAlternatively, the Java code uses 10000 *a + (K -b). That way, when (K -b) is negative, adding 10000*a will make it positive before mod, which then the remainder comes out positive. So that's a way to handle cases where (K -b) could be negative but the mod has negative?\n\nWait, but if K < b, the code just takes ans = K, so the formula is only when K >= b. So maybe the code is incorrect? Or perhaps in the problem's constraints, K is large enough that it's beyond the pre-cycle part. Maybe the problem statement is such that K can be anything, and the code handles all cases. The formula with the 10000*a may be aiming to prevent negative mod.\n\nIn any case, translating that formula directly is needed.\n\nMoving to Fortran variables and logic:\n\nNow, I need to code all of this in Fortran, considering the steps:\n\nStart by reading N and K.\n\nThen read N integers into an array A of size N (0-based indices).\n\nInitialize the used array as logical, indices 0 to N-1, initialized to .false. by default, then when adding to \"used\", set that index to true. Since in the loop, the while !used.contains(next), the Fortran equivalent would be while (.not. used(next)), so initializations need to be false.\n\nThe loop:\n\nInitialize next =0.cur =0. \n\nWait in code:\n\nstart:\n\nnext =0, cur =0.\n\nThe loop proceeds:\n\nwhile next is not in used:\n\n   add to used (set used(next) = .true.)\n\n   set idx(next) = cur.\n\n   set pos(cur) = next.\n\n   next = A(next).\n\n   cur = cur +1.\n\nWait the code starts by setting next to 0, cur to 0, and then the first steps are inside the loop.\n\nWait, looking at the Java loop's initial code:\n\nAt the start of the while loop:\n\nused.add(next)\n\nSo in the first iteration, next is 0. So used(0) becomes .true., then next advances each step, until it hits a previously used one.\n\nThus, the pos array records all the steps from 0 to cur-1 (since pos is assigned as pos[cur] = next, then cur increments).\n\nSo after the loop, the total steps counted so far is 'cur', but 'cur' would have been the current step before termination?\n\nWait, here's the loop step-by-step:\n\nInitial next is 0, cur = 0. Enter loop because used is empty, so 'used does not contain next (0 is not in used yet).\n\nInside the loop: \n\nMark used[next] (0) as true.\n\nSet idx(0) = cur (which is 0).\n\nSet pos[0] = next (0).\n\nThen next is set to A[0], then cur increments to 1. So the new next is A[0], and cur is 1.\n\nThen the loop condition is checked again. \n\nSo after the loop ends, 'cur' is the current value that won't be used. Because when we exit the loop, the next had been encountered before. The steps in the loop have executed exactly (cur) times? Let's see.\n\nWait the first time through (cur starts at 0, but then increments to 1).\n\nWait the loop runs until 'while (!used.contains(next))'? Wait no, that's the condition: entry condition.\n\nSo each time next is the next index, but before doing the loop, it checks whether that new 'next' is already in used. The loop escapes if it was already in used. \n\nWait the exact steps:\n\nFirst, initial next is 0. \n\nCheck if next not in used? Since used(0) is now added in the first iteration. \n\nWait, the order is:\n\nThe loop continues while the new next (after calculation?) no, the condition is checked before the iteration.\n\nLet me see: \n\nThe while loop is: while(!used.contains(next)). \n\nSo before each iteration's code runs, the check occurs. \n\nWait the first time, in the loop starts: \n\nThe first step is: add next to used (so setting that element in used array to true). \n\nWait no, the code inside the loop is adding next to used before doing the next steps. Wait the code inside the loop:\n\nused.add(next); \u2192 that's the first step.\n\nWait: the ordering is, so that even the next is checked before the loop runs, so the code ensures the new next is not present, and includes next in the current step's processing. Wew, code loops as long as the chosen next (prior) hasn't been used yet. \n\nWait perhaps I'm getting confused, but the key is that for the code, in Fortran, the steps are:\n\nused(next) = .true.\n\nidx(next) = cur\n\npos (cur) = next \n\nThen, next is set to A(next)\n\ncur is incremented.\n\nThus, the loop condition is checked again with the new next, and the next is checked if in used. Because after the next = A(next), we loop back to check if the new next is in used. But original Java code checks whether the next (prior to adding) is in used before allowing the loop's iteration. Wait the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration before doing the loop's code.\n\nSo the loop is entered as long as 'next' is not in used. So in the loop body, first thing added to used is next. So essentially, it can't be in used before the loop's body: The loop runs as follows:\n\nAs long as next is not in used, do the loop body. \n\nInside the loop body, first, you add next to used, so getting marked. Thus, invariants are that the next is not in used before the start of the loop iteration, and after, it is.\n\nThus, the loop will process each next until the moment that the next is already in used. \n\nThus, the loop appropriately tracks the path steps until the first cycle.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the same logic applies.\n\nNow, the arrays:\n\nDefine:\n\nINTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:), idx(:), pos(:)\n\nLOGICAL, ALLOCATABLE :: used(:)\n\nBut their sizes are N. Let's plan:\n\nRead N first, then allocate arrays:\n\nRead(N)\n\nallocate( A(0:N-1), used(0:N-1), idx(0:N-1), pos(0:cur_max)). Wait, Hmm. \n\nWait what is the maximum needed for pos? Since cur can be up to N steps? Because in the worst case, the path goes through all N indices before looping.\n\nThus, the pos array would need to be allocated to at least size \"cur\" after loop. Since cur can be as big as N, we can pre-allocate pos with N elements. \n\nWait in the Java code, the pos array is of size N. So when we run the loop up to N steps, but probably in at most N+1 steps (then it must repeat). So in Fortran:\n\nThe variables next and cur are integers.\n\nInitialize next to 0, cur to 0.\n\nThe used array is initialized to .false., except as modified in the loop. How?\n\nIn Fortran, default values for allocatable variables are undefined. Thus, when the code begins, the used array must be initialized to .false. for all elements. So:\n\nallocate(used(0:N-1)) \u2192 then use used = .false.\n\nSimilarly for idx and pos arrays.\n\nWait in Fortran, how to initialize the arrays:\n\n   used = .false.\n\n   Allocate A(0:N-1), but those can be read from input. \n\n[idx and pos]\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N, K.\n\nRead(*,*) N, K\n\nBut let me see. Wait in the Java code, first N = sc.nextInt(); then K = sc.nextLong(); so in Fortran: read *, N, K \u2192 but since in Fortran, the variables need to be declared.\n\nWait the code is:\n\nDeclare variables at the top of the program.\n\nWe'll need to to have everything in a program block.\n\nSo, the program steps would be:\n\nprogram abc167d\n\nimplicit none\n\n! declare variables\n\ninteger :: N, next, cur, i, MOD, A, ... \n\nWait let me think.\n\nFirst step is to translate the variables from the Java class into Fortran's variables. The constants:\n\npublic class has these variables:\n\nfinal int MOD = 1000000007 \u2192 in Fortran, define as parameter.\n\nfinal int MAX = Integer.MAX_VALUE \u2192 which is 2^31-1. In Fortran, integers can be up to 2^31-1 on 32-bit systems, but we don't need to use them here; perhaps the code does not actually use MAX so maybe can ignore it.\n\nfinal long LMAX = Long.MAX_VALUE \u2192 similar. Also perhaps unused.\n\nlen = (int) 1e6 +1 \u2192 also perhaps unused. So maybe in the Fortran code, we can ignore these constants unless they are used in the code.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe variables MOD, MAX, LMAX, and len are declared in the Java class but not used in the method doIt except for MOD might be part of the problem. However, in the provided Java code, the doIt() method doesn't have any code involving MOD. So the program is not computing modulo MOD, so those constants are likely unused here.\n\nTherefore, perhaps just proceed without declaring those, but perhaps they were part of the template. So in the Fortran code, we can just ignore them except for MOD if needed. Let's look at the code given.\n\nLooking at the Java code: the only variables that matter are N, K, A, used, idx, pos, etc. The final section has variables a, b, ans, etc. So in the code's doIt method, there's no operation (like mod) with the MOD variable. Therefore, likely not present in the problem, so we can skip those constants.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, variables:\n\n- N is integer.\n\n- K is a 64-bit integer (long in java) \u2192 in Fortran, use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18). So better to use integer(8) :: K.\n\n- A is an integer array of size N (0-based), so read N elements, then subtract 1 (since Java code does A[i]= sc.nextInt() -1 \u2192 in Fortran, each element is read as input, then A(i) = input -1.\n\n- The used array is of logical type (0:N-1).\n\n- idx and pos: both are integer arrays of size N (0 to N-1 for idx, and pos needs to be up to cur. Since cur can up to N steps, the pos array can be size cur_max = N.\n\nThus:\n\nLet me outline the variables:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc167d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, next, cur, i, answer\ninteger(8) :: K ! because in Java: long K\n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:), idx(:), pos(:)\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\n\n! Read N and K first.\n\nread(*,*) N, K\n\nallocate( A(0:N-1), idx(0:N-1), pos(0:N-1), used(0:N-1) )\n\n! Initialize A (read next N integers, subtract 1 from each):\n\ndo i=0, N-1\n read(*,*) A(i)\n A(i) = A(i) -1\nend do\n\n! Initialize the used array to .false., others to zero?\n\nused = .false.\n\n! Initialize them:\n\nidx = 0 ! maybe need to set to some default. Probably zero is okay but perhaps not used.\n\n! The idx array may need to be initialized to some default like -1, but since in Java they are set in the loop, and possibly the unused elements would be 0.\n\nAlternatively, in the loop, the first references are setting to cur which is 0, so maybe it's okay.\n\nNow proceed with variables next = 0, cur =0.\n\nnext =0\n\ncur =0\n\ndo \n\n ! The loop condition! in Java: while (!used.contains(next)) \u2192 while (.not. used(next) )\n\n if ( used(next) ) exit loop\n\nWe have to make a loop structure in Fortran. In fortran, the WHILE loop can be 'do while...end do'. The code inside the loop must:\n\nused(next) = .true.\n\n idx(next) = cur\n\n pos(cur) = next\n\n next = A(next)\n\n cur = cur +1 \n\nSo, the loop can be written as:\n\ndo while (.not. used(next) )\n\n   used(next) = .true.\n\n   idx(next) = cur \n\n   pos(cur) = next \n\n   next = A(next)\n\n   cur = cur +1 \n\nend do\n\nWait, wait \u2014 the do while part is tricky. The condition here is checking if next is not yet used, and if so, do the loop.\n\nThe way the loop is structured in the original code is that it needs to enter the loop only if 'next' is not in used, which in the current check.\n\nWait the do while loop in Fortran evaluates the condition at the start. Therefore, the code above is equivalent to the Java's while loop:\n\nLoop continues as long as the condition (not used(next)) holds.\n\nWait but the initial 'next' and 'cur' values are set to 0 and 0 respectively. Let's step through.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nnext is 0. The condition is not used(next) \u2192 initially, used(0) was false, so enter the loop.\n\nProcess:\n\nSet used(0) to true. \n\nidx(next)=0 is zero. \n\npos(0) = next (0).\n\nThen next becomes A(0).\n\ncur becomes 1. \n\nThen, the 'do while' checks.\n\nNext iteration: \n\nChecking if next's value (which is A(0)) hasn't been used yet.\n\nSuppose that's the case, repeat.\n\nThis seems correct. \n\nWait but the loop in Fortran will check the condition after every iteration, which is necessary.\n\nWait the do while loop in Fortran is structured as:\n\nDo while (condition)\n   ...body\nend do \u2192 evaluates condition before each iteration.\n\nThus, this is the same as the Java version: the loop runs only when condition is true.\n\nWait, no, the loop's condition is that the next wasn't in used before.\n\nWait, after processing next, the 'next' becomes A(next), and then the exit is determined by 'used(next)' before the next entry. \n\nHmm, but in the Java code:\n\nInside the loop, the 'next' is updated at the end inside the loop (i.e. after the current processing). \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nProceeding.\n\nNow after loop, the variables a and b:\n\na = cur - idx(next)\n\n a is cycle length. \n\nBut in large numbers, so in FORTRAN, cur is integer (presumably up to N) so integer(4) is okay.\n\nWait 'cur' can be up to N, but in Java it is an int (so for N up to 1e6, but no, N could be up to 1e6. Wait the original Java code's 'len' was 1e6 +1, but maybe N can be up to 1e5? Not sure, but variables have to be integers. \n\nSo K is a 8-byte integer.\n\nIn this code:\n\nCompute a and b:\n\na = (cur - idx(next)) see, next is the value that already was in used. Because the loop stops when 'next' was previously visited. \n\nThus, after the loop, 'next' is an element already in the 'used' set, and the loop terminated.\n\nThus, returning to the formula.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\na = cur - idx(next)\n\nb = idx(next)\n\nThen compute:\n\nans = ((10000 *a + (K - b)) ) mod a + b ?\n\nWait, need to be careful with the formula as given in the Java code:\n\nlong expression: (10000 * a + K - b )mod a.\n\nBut in Fortran, mod is a function that returns the remainder with the same sign as the denominator, so for negative numbers. \n\nAlternatively, the Java code uses 10000*a + (K -b). The idea is to ensure that (K -b) + 10000*a is positive, so when you take mod a, it's equivalent to (K - b) mod a. Since adding a multiple of a doesn't change the mod result. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nans = modulo( 10000 * a + (K - b), a ) + b \n\nWait, but no: the formula in Java is ( (10000*a + K - b) % a ) + b. \n\nWait in FORTRAN:\n\nans = mod( (10000 * a + K - b ), a) + b?\n\nWait but the problem is, in FORTRAN, if the remainder is negative, mod would return a negative? Or is it the same as in Java?\n\nWait, in Fortran, modulo(a, p) is the same as in mathematics: (a mod p) gives a result with the same sign as p. Not sure exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute:\n\ninteger(8) :: numerator, rem \n\nnumerator = K - b \n\nrem = mod( numerator, a )\n\nif ( rem < 0 ) rem = rem + a\n\n ans_ = rem + b \n\nBut the code's Java computes it as (10000*a + (K-b)) mod a. Which is the same as (K-b) mod a, but does that work for all cases?\n\nWait adding 10000*a, which is multiple of a, so mod(a) same as K-b mod a. But the code probably doesn't need 10000, it's perhaps a typo. But the code is given so translate as-is.\n\nHence, to replicate exactly:\n\nJava code's expression is:\n\n(long)( ... (10000 *a + K - b) %a )\n\nIn Java, the modulo operation returns a value between -(a-1) and 0 when (K-b) is negative, but when modulus is positive. Wait, depends, in Java, it's remainder. So, to make sure it's positive, adding 10000 *a (which is a large multiple), then mod a.\n\nSo even if (K -b) is negative, numerator = 10000a + (K -b) is large, mod a gives (K-b mod a). \n\nThus:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nans = modulo( 10000 * a + (K - b), a ) + b\n\nThe modulo function will return a number between 0 and a-1, so adding b gives between b and b +a -1, which is the correct position in the cycle.\n\nWait but since modulo is (anything mod a) in [0, a-1], thus adding b gets the index in the path.\n\nBut note that in the code, K could be less than b, and in that case, the code sets ans to K.\n\nIn code:\n\nif (b > K) ans = K.\n\nThus, the code does:\n\nFirst compute the expression.\n\nans = (modulo( 10000*a + K -b ) mod a ) + b.\n\nBut if b>K \u2192 then, it's not in the cycle path, so the path hasn't passed the cycle start.\n\nThus, in that case, ans is K.\n\nBut in FORTRAN:\n\nThe variable ans variable can be computed as:\n\nFirst compute the candidate:\n\ntmp = modulo(10000 * a + (K - b), a) + b\n\n ans = tmp\n\n if (b > K ) then\n\n    ans = K\n\n end if\n\nWait, but in the code, when b>K, (10000a + K -b) may be negative: let's see:\n\nSuppose K=5 and b=10 \u2192 K -b = -5. 10000*a would be big enough, so + ( -5 ) can still make it positive (assuming a positive) \u2192 modulo would give 5 mod a \u2192 ?\n\nWait no, since (K-b) = -5. 10000*a is, say, 1e4 *a (a is the cycle length). \n\nWait in the case of K < b \u2192 b is idx[next], which is the 'pre-loop length' steps before the first cycle.\n\nThus, the path for K steps must be before any cycle. So, if K <b \u2192 then the position is simply pos(K).\n\nThus, the code's condition if (b> K) \u2192 ans = K.\n\nWait but why does the code need that? Because the 'ans' is supposed to be the step number which is counted up to 'b' (the break point). \n\nWait the variables a and b are defined as:\n\na = cur - idx[next] \u2192 cycle length.\n\nb = idx[next] \u2192 steps before the cycle starts (after starting at 0).\n\nSo for K steps < b \u2192 the position is pos(K).\n\nFor K steps >= b \u2192 how much into the cycle: \n\nthe position is pos[ (K -b) mod a + b ] \u2192 since the cycle starts at index b and has length a.\n\nHence, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the code steps for ans are:\n\nif ( current (b) > K \u2192 then the answer is pos(K). \n\nElse \u2192 pos[ans], where ans is the calculated index.\n\nWait in the code, the code has:\n\nans = ((10000*a + K - b) %a ) +b\n\n If (b > K ) ans = K\n\nThen the current answer (position) is pos( ans )\n\nWait but the code's output is:\n\nSystem.out.println(pos[ans] +1 );\n\nWait because the original Java code's pos stores the next (the array's elements are 0-based, but the problem may require 1-based indices. e.g. in input subtraction, the output needs to be displayed as (position in pos +1) ?\n\nBecause the original array A elements were adjusted to 0-based by subtracting 1. So the output must give the 1-based index.\n\nThus, the FORTRAN code must compute the pos( ans ), then ADD 1, and print.\n\nTherefore:\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nAfter a and b are calculated.\n\ncheck:\n\nIf (b > K ) \u2192 then the position is pos( K ) (since before the cycle starts, steps 0-based up to b-1)\n\nElse \u2192 ans is ( (10000*a + (K -b) ) mod a ) +b \u2192 pos( ans ) \u2192 but in the path, the pos stores the index at each step. \n\nThus, the pos array's indices are 0 to (cur -1) (since the loop filled up to cur-1 steps, since it exited when next was in used). \n\nWait but cur is the current value after the loop, which escape when next is in used. The loop's last step was 'cur =cur +1'.\n\nThus, the total number of steps (indices in pos array) is up to cur. But the last pos entry stored is (cur-1). \n\nWait, the code steps during the loop: \n\neach iteration sets pos[cur] = next. \n\nThen next is advanced, then cur is increased. \n\nWait, for example, first iteration: at start, next was 0. After in loop, set pos[0] = next (0). cur becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration (next now is A[0]), the position at 'cur' is current cur (1?), and set pos[1] = next (A[0]) ... etc.\n\nThe loop runs while next isn't in used. So when the loop ends, the final next is the first duplicate.\n\nSo the total number of steps stored in pos is cur \u2192 because the \u2018cur\u2019 was increased after the last step.\n\nWait the pos array holds steps from index 0 to cur-1.\n\nWait when loop enters, the initial 'next is not in used'.\n\nIn the first iteration (before the do-while loop's first run, the condition is true):\n\nInside loop:\n\nmark used -> set idx -> pos => the next and cur are updated.\n\nThe loop continues until next is already used.\n\nThus, after the loop:\n\nThe latest position is pos( cur -1 )?\n\nWait the loop condition is checked again after the changes. So before the loop's termination, the new 'next' is the first encountered again. Let me think with an example:\n\nSuppose the path is 0 \u21921 \u21922 \u21920.\n\nLoop steps:\n\nFirst run (0):\n\n- used(0) set. idx[0] =0. pos[0]=0. next is A(0)=1 \u2192 which is not used, so loop continues.\n\ncur becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration: next is 1 (not used before):\n\n mark used[1], idx[1] =1. pos[1] =1. Then next is A(1)=2. cur 2.\n\n third iteration: next =2 not used.\n\nmark index 2, idx[2]=2. pos[2]=2. next =A(2)=0 (since in this example, A leads back to 0). \n\ncur increments to 3.\n\nNow: check the condition next (0) is in used? \n\nYes! (since we first set used[0]). Thus, loop does not proceed.\n\n At this point, the 'next' is 0, which is in used. \n\n The total steps done (cur) is 3.\n\nThus the pos array has entries for 0,1,2: indices (0-based up) of their steps.\n\n Thus, the length of the path is 3 \u2192 the pos array up to 2 is filled.\n\nWhen the loop ends, cur is 3 (because after setting next to 0, we incremented to 3 before exiting).\n\nThe cycle length a = cur - idx[next], where next is 0 (the first repeated element).\n\nidx[next =0] is 0 \u2192 a = 3-0 =3 \u2192 which is the cycle length (3 steps? Well in this example, the cycle from 0\u21921\u21922\u21920 is length 3.\n\nBut the pre-loop length (b) is idx[next] which is idx[0] =0 \u2192 so pre-cycle steps are 0 \u2192 so the first step is part of the pre-cycle, but the cycle starts immediately here. So when K is 2: it's in the pre-cycle? Wait, in the code's terms, the 'b' =0, so cycle starts at b=0. So if K is larger than 0, the formula applies.\n\nThus the code's formulas will work.\n\nNow back to the Fortran code.\n\nAfter computing a and b, need to calculate ans:\n\nif ( b > K ), then the position is pos(K). So the code's ans variable (for the index) should be K, else the calculation.\n\nSo:\n\nans is computed:\n\nif (b > K) then \n\n   final_index = K\n\nelse\n\n   numerator = 10000000000 * a + (K - b) \n\n   but in code it's 10000 *a but perhaps that's a typo? Wait No, the code uses 10000 *a. Wait in the Java code, the line is:\n\nans = (int) ((10000 *a + K - b) %a) +b;\n\noriginal code: \n\nx = 10000*a + (K -b) \n\nthen mod by a, so x mod a, then add b.\n\nWait, 10000 was perhaps just a large number (to handle negative numbers when mod is applied).\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nTo compute the same formula:\n\ninteger(8) :: temp1, temp2\n\ntemp1 = 10000 * a \n\ntemp2 = temp1 + K -b \n\nans_index = mod( temp2, a ) + b \n\nThus mod is the remainder ( possibly negative?), but with 10000*a term, temp2 is positive even if K -b is negative?\n\nWait for example, let\u2019s say a = 5, K -b = -3 \u2192 10000*5=50000 \u2192 50000 -3=49997 \u2192 mod5 would give (49997 mod5 is 49997=5*9999.4 \u2192 5*9999=49995 \u2192 49997 mod5 is 2 \u2192 adding to b gives (2 +b).\n\nThe formula gives correct modulus.\n\nThus in Fortran:\n\nans_index = mod(10000* a + (K - b ), a ) + b \n\nHowever, the mod function in Fortran returns the sign of the value, but adding 10000*a ensures that even with K-b negative, the argument is positive, so mod is fine.\n\nBut perhaps using modulo instead?\n\nWait, in fortran, the function 'mod(a,mod_value)' returns the result with the sign of the first argument. The 'modulo' function returns result with the sign of the mod_value. \n\nWait but in any case, since the argument is positive, the mod function will return a non-negative remainder between 0 and a-1.\n\nThus, the Fortran formula is okay.\n\nThus, compute this.\n\nBut code needs to have a temporary value (integer(8) ?)\n\nSince a can be up to N which can be 1e6, so 10000 * a could be 1e10, but with K being a 64-bit integer (the K in the problem can be up to 1e18), so 10000*a (assuming a is up to N) can be (for N=1e6, 1e4 *1e6=1e10; but the sum would be way larger than K, but as long as temp2 is a integer variable, it's okay.\n\n But in Fortran, we need to handle 8-byte integers.\n\n Thus variables such as temp1 need be 8-byte.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nFirst compute a and b:\n\n a = cur - idx(next)\n\nb = idx(next)\n\n then:\n\nif (b > K) then\n\n   ans_index = K\n\nelse\n\n   compute the mod stuff.\n\nend if\n\nBut K is an integer(8). So the variables a is an integer as well.\n\nThus in code:\n\nif ( b > K ) then \n\n   ans_index = K\n\n else\n\n   ans_index = mod( int(10000*a,8) + K - b, a ) + b \n\nend if\n\nWait but a is an integer (4-byte perhaps), but a can be up to 1e6 (so within 4-bytes, since 2^31 is larger than that). However, in Fortran, using integers for a and others:\n\nWait variables a and b are computed as 'cur' - idx..., which are integers (the 'cur' and idx(next) are integers, so difference can be up to N steps. So a and b can be stored in default integers (4-byte).\n\nTherefore, the multiplication 10000*a can be an 8-byte integer (since K is 8-byte), so in code:\n\nchange to:\n\nans_index = mod( 10000 * a + K - b, a ) + b \n\nThis expression:\n\nThe terms: K -b is an integer(8), adding 10000*a (which is integer * integer (a being integer)), and the sum is stored as integer(8), mod with a (integer division). Since mod in Fortran can handle integer operands of different lengths? Or need to cast a to integer(8)?\n\nLet me check:\n\nSuppose a is integer (4 bytes), denominator, so when mod( ... , a), the mod is okay because the divisor is same or smaller. So:\n\nThe code of mod: the first argument is integer(8), the second is integer (4). The function mod(a,b) where a is 8 bytes and b (4 bytes) would cast to 8 bytes? Not sure. To avoid issues, maybe better to ensure that variables are compatible.\n\nAlternatively write as:\n\nans_index = mod( int(10000*a, 8) + int(K,8) - int(b,8), int(a,8 ) ) + int(b,8 )\n\nThis way, everything is in 8-byte, but perhaps complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let us ensure that the mod is correct.\n\nAlternatively, compute numerator modulo a using integer(8). For example:\n\nnumerator = 10000 * a  + ( K - b )\n\nremainder = mod( numerator, a )\n\nans_index = remainder + b\n\nBut 'numerator' is (K -b) plus something. But 'mod(..., a)' will give the same result as (K -b) mod a, since adding 10000*a mod a will give remainder=0, so the rest is (K -b mod a).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nnumerator = K - b + 10000 * a \n\nremainder = mod( numerator, a )\n\nans_index = remainder + b \n\nBut this is the same.\n\nThus, the FORTRAN code would write:\n\nif (b > K) then\n\n   ans_index = K\n\nelse \n\n   remainder = mod( (10000 * a + K - b), a )\n\n   ans_index = remainder + b\n\nend if\n\nThis should work.\n\nThen, the final answer is pos( ans_index )\n\nWait pos has to hold indices of steps up to cur-1 (the (cur steps in the loop, but indexes up to cur-1). \n\nThe ans_index is computed to be the position in the array (a number between 0 and cur-1?\n\nbecause if:\n\nWhen K is greater than or equal to b:\n\nremainder is mod( ... , a) \u2192 so between 0 and a-1.\n\nAdding b = idx[next] \u2192 which is the starting index of the cycle.\n\nSo the ans_index ranges from b to b + (a-1). \n\nThus the value is within the pos[] array since the 'b' is the starting index of the cycle (the first index), and adding up to the end. \n\nYes, as the position array has indexes from 0 to cur-1.\n\nBut since the cycle length a = cur - b \u2192 b +a-1 = (b is the starting index, cur is the total length of path taken before getting to the repeated element; so cur = b + a steps?)\n\nWait no:\n\ncur is the final value, which was the new value after the loop ended. \n\nLet me see example earlier when N=3:\n\nThe path is 0\u21921\u21922\u21920 (cycle of 3). \n\nThe loop runs until next is 0 again, ending after cur=3.\n\nThe a = cur - idx[next]. next is 0, so idx[next] =0. So a=3-0=3 \u2192 cycle of 3 steps. \n\nb = idx[next] =0, so for K steps beyond b:\n\nthe ans_index is (K -0 mod3)+0 \u2192So K mod3.\n\nThus, for K=5, ans_index is 5 mod3= 2 \u2192 position 2 (which is node 2) \u2192 that's correct. \n\nThus in pos array, indices go up to cur-1 =2, so okay.\n\nSo answer is pos(ans_index).\n\nThus the code finally writes:\n\nprint *, pos(ans_index) +1\n\nWait in Java code, the output is pos[ans]+1, because the array elements were stored as 0-based indices, but the problem expects 1-based. So yes.\n\nThus the FORTRAN code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc167d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, next, cur, nextfinal, i, a, b, ans_index, idxnext\n\ninteger(8) :: K \n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:), idx(:), pos(:)\n\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\n\nread(*,*) N, K\n\nallocate( used(0:N-1), A(0:N-1), idx(0:N-1), pos(0:N-1) )\n\n!

Get the position.\n\ninteger :: result\n\n result = pos(ans_index) + 1 \n\nprint *, result \n\nend program \n\nWait, need to check variables: \n\nIn the 'else' clause, 'remainder' is a variable needed to store the mod result. So it must be declared as integer.\n\nThus declare vars:\n\n...\n\ninteger :: remainder \n\nAt the top.\n\nWait in Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So in the program above, the variables:\n\nvariables to declare:\n\ninteger :: N, next, cur, i, a, b, ans_index, remainder, idxnext, result\n\nWait result is just an integer to store it.\n\nWait, but the code in the IF block:\n\nWe need to compute remainder when 'else' block is taken. Thus, adding remainder as an integer variable:\n\nYes.\n\nNow, reviewing all variables:\n\nVariables:\n\nN \u2013 integer\n\nK \u2013 integer(8)\n\nA, idx, pos, used \u2013 as allocatables.\n\nVariables next, cur, a, b, ans_index, remainder, result: integers.\n\nThus, adding lines to declare:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc167d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N, next, cur, i, a, b, ans_index, remainder, result \n\ninteger(8) :: K\n\ninteger, allocatable :: A(:), idx(:), pos(:)\n\nlogical, allocatable :: used(:)\n\nThen the rest proceeds.\n\nTesting that.\n\nNow, edge case where K <b ?\n\nSay, suppose N=1 (A[0]=0, then the cycle is 0 \u21920. So a and b:\n\nLoop runs with next=0 \u2192 unused, set used[0]=.T., idx(0)=0. next =A(0)=0, then cur increments to 1. Then loop condition (used(0) is .T. \u2192 so loop stops). \n\nThus cur is 1. a=1-0=1, b=0, if K is 0 (assuming allowed?), but K is read as a long, perhaps the problem requires K>=1?\n\nThus, if K=0 (which may not be allowed), then:\n\nif b>K \u2192 0>0 is false? 0 equals.\n\nWait, for K=0:\n\nb=0 \u2192 not greater than 0 \u2192 proceed to else:\n\nremainder = mod( (0-0) + 10000*1 ,1 )\n\n= mod(10000,1)=0 ?\n\nthen ans_index =0 +0 \u21920 \u2192 result is pos(0) +1 =0+1=1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone enters N=1, K=1.\n\nThen ans:\n\na=1, b=0.\n\n1 is \u2265b (0)\n\nans: mod(10000*1 + (1-0), 1 ) \u2192 mod(10001,1)=0 \u2192 remainder +0 \u21920, so pos(0)+1 is 1.\n\nSo seems correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother example:\n\nN=2. A[0]=1, A[1]=0 \u2192 the path is 0 \u21921\u21920\u21921\u2026\n\nThe first loop:\n\nStart next=0, used(0)=T, pos(0)=0. cur becomes 1. next is A[0]=1 (not used).\n\nThen next =1, which is not used. cur increments to 2.\n\nLoop again:\n\nused(1)=T \u2192 idx(1)=1, pos(1)=1. next=A(1)=0 \u2192 yes, now next is 0 \u2192 which is used.\n\n Exit loop.\n\n cur is 2. \n\n a = cur - idx(next). next is 0.\n\n idx(0) =0 (from first iteration).\n\n a =2 -0 =2 \u2192 cycle length 2.\n\n b = idx(next)=0 \u2192 pre cycle length is 0.\n\n Thus, for K=3.\n\nK is 3 \u22650.\n\nSo:\n\n10000*a + (3-0) \u219220000+3=20003 \u2192 mod 2 \u2192 20003 mod2 =1.\n\n ans_index =1 +0 =1 \u2192 pos(1) +1 \u21921+1=2? Wait pos[1] is 1 (the position at step 1 is index 1), so the answer would be 2 (1+1). But the third step is 0\u2192 step0,1 \u2192 steps 3 is the second cycle step. \n\nSteps:\n\n0 \u21921 \u21920 \u21921 \u2192 step 3 is 1 (position at step 2 (index 2-1=1), step 3 would be step 3 mod 2? So position for K=3 is step( 0 (cycle_start?) \n\nWait the cycle starts at 0, so step index for K=3:\n\nsince pre-cycle is 0 steps \u2192 so 3 -0=3, mod 2 \u21921. \n\n adds to b (0) \u2192 1: pos(1)=1 \u2192 +1 \u2192 2. Which is correct.\n\nThe third step (K=3):\n\ntotal steps:\n\nstep0:0 (index0),\n\nstep1:1 (index1),\n\nstep2:0 again (index 2 \u2192 but the loop was cur incremented to 2, so the loop stored up to cur=2 \u2192 pos has indices 0,1,2? Wait in the first example:\n\n cur is set to 2, and the loop exited immediately.\n\n Thus the pos(0)=0, pos(1)=1, and pos(2)=0.\n\n Then the loop: after A(1)=0 becomes next, which is used (step0 is previously marked), so the loop exits.\n\n Thus the pos array goes up to 2.\n\nThus in the K=3:\n\nans_index=1 (the remainder is (3 mod2 \u21921). so 1+0=1 \u2192 which is pos(1)=1, so output 2. \n\nWait but the next step after step1 is 0 ( step2), so step3 would be step2+1 = step3 is position1 \u2192 yes. So correct.\n\nThus code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible code in Fortran:\n\nAdding all variables and syntax.\n\nAnother possible issue: the pos array in the Java code is size N, because cur can go up to just N (the initial loop stops early?), but in code when N=1e5, and pos array is allocated as 0:N-1. So when for example, the loop runs over iterations that can fill pos up to cur-1 may be larger than N?\n\nWait the maximum possible length of the path before the cycle (pre-cycle plus) is N steps. Since next is between 0 and N-1 \u2192 the loop can\u2019t iterate more than N times as that would require visiting N+1 indices (each time next is different \u2192 until after N steps, it must repeat). So the maximum cur after loop will be up to N +1 ?\n\nSorry, the path starts at 0. Each step increments next, but within indices 0..N-1. The maximum number of steps without cycle is N, since after N steps, one of the indices must have been visited again. So cur can be at worst N +1 ? Or cur will be N when it loops.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe total indices are N. The first step (cur becomes 1) after next=0, used is marked.\n\nEach step increments cur until the next is in used. \n\nThus, after N+1 th step, the next must be in used \u2192 loop will stop. Thus maximum cur is N+1?\n\nBut if N is the size of the A array, then the initial path can take up to N steps before a repeat.\n\nWait, the maximum possible 'cur' after the loop can be N+1? Let's take N=2:\n\nIn previous example:\n\nAfter the first steps (0 and 1), next is 0 which is already used, so cur is 2 \u2192 the loop runs 2 times (steps 0 and1 \u2192 cur reached 2). \n\nThus, for N elements, the maximum possible 'cur' can be N, so the pos array (allocated as (0:N-1) can only hold up to N elements (indices 0.. N-1). However, in the example where N=2, cur reached 2 (so index 1 of the array). Wait when N=2, the pos array is (0:1).\n\nWait the size of the initial allocation of pos is 0:N-1 \u2192 for N=2, the pos has indices 0 and1.\n\n cur before loop exit can be 2 \u2192 the last assignment is in pos(1):\n\nFor step 1: pos(1)= next (A[0] \u21921 \u2192 assume step1.\n\nThen next is set to 0 (indexes 0 is marked.\n\nLoop checked and stopped.\n\n So cur is 2.\n\nThus pos(2) is out of bounds.\n\n Oh this is a problem.\n\nAh! The Fortran code above has allocated pos as (0:N-1), but cur in this case can go up to N steps. So in the loop, the code steps:\n\nNext is assigned after storing the last pos, so the pos is filled as follows:\n\nfor the first loop iteration:\n\ncur starts at 0 \u2192 pos(0) is set. \n\nthen next -> new next \u2192cur is 1.\n\n after loop runs, which exits when next is in used.\n\n The last assignment to pos is pos( cur-1 ).\n\n Wait, in the loop:\n\n - inside the loop:\n\n   pos( cur ) = next \n\n Wait: \n\n Wait carefully: the loop's inside steps:\n\n The first step inside the loop is:\n\n idx( next ) = cur \n\n pos( cur ) = next \n\n Then next is next = A(next), then cur increases by 1.\n\n So in this loop, 'pos' is assigned to position 'cur' \u2192 but after, cur increases. \n\n Thus, the first iteration (when cur=0 at the start inside the loop):\n\n set pos(0) = next (initial 0).\n\n cur is then set to 1.\n\n The next loop continues:\n\n if next's new value is not used, then the next step would assign to pos(1).\n\n So the maximum position in the array is cur.\n\n The loop's condition is checked after.\n\n When the loop condition is false:\n\n the 'cur' has been incremented to (cur+1), but the loop has not executed that step.\n\n Thus, the latest pos array value is set to cur-1 \u2192 which can be up to the previous step.\n\nThe maximum possible 'cur' after the loop? \n\nSuppose there are N elements, all form a chain, so path is 0,1,2,\u2026,N-1, then N is not available (only array size N, so when next is N-1, and after processing, next is A[N-1].\n\nIf A[N-1] is a new element beyond that, but since it must be within N elements.\n\nThus the path can be all N elements, so when the loop ends, cur would have been set to N +1?\n\nWait let's say N=3, and path 0\u21921\u21922\u21923 (wait that can't happen as N=3 array would be 0..2. So next can not be 3.\n\nSo the maximum:\n\nThe length of steps taken is up to N+1? Or N steps before repeating. \n\nWait the maximum steps without repetition is N steps (0-based indices). Thus:\n\nfor N elements, the path can take N+1 steps before looping?\n\nWait if the starting point is the first index, and movement goes through N steps without any cycle, but each step visits a new position.\n\n But with N array elements (indices 0..N-1): that requires N+1 steps to get a repeat.\n\nWait in the case of the longest possible non-cycle path (a straight path), so for N elements forming a straight chain, then the next ends beyond? Impossible.\n\nWait in array of size N, the cycle will occur at step N+1. Because there are N elements, after N steps, the next must revisit an element.\n\nThus the loop can run up to N times \u2192 cur after the loop can be N+1? Let's take N=3:\n\nsuppose the sequence is 0 \u21921 \u21922 \u2192 and then next must point to something, say 3 \u2192 but array size is N=3 \u2192 illegal.\n\nThus in reality, when next can only be between0 and 2, so for example 0\u21921\u21920 \u2192 then the loop will exit.\n\nThus, the maximum steps the loop takes is N steps? For the case of a path visiting all N elements before looping:\n\nExample N=3:\n\n 0\u21921\u21922 \u2192 A[2]=0 (cycle). The path steps:\n\nLoop steps:\n\nAfter 3th element:\n\nHere, after processing 2 (third element?), cur is 3. next = A(2)=0. Is that 0 already used? yes (first step). thus, loop exits. The cur is 3. \n\nThus the next is in used, so the loop stops.\n\nThus the pos array's size was allocated as (0:2) \u2192 size N-1 is 2 (0-based).\n\nBut then in the above case, when assigning to pos(2) (the index cur-2?), sorry: The loop runs steps:\n\nFirst iteration (cur is 0 initially):\n\npos(0) = next (0), cur becomes 1.\n\nSecond iteration (next=1):\n\npos(1)=1; cur becomes 2.\n\nThird iteration (next=2):\n\npos(2) = 2; new next is A(2) =0 (pointed to 0). \n\nNow, checking condition: next is 0 \u2192 which is in used ( marked in first iteration \u2192 now when checking loop's condition, .not. used(next \u21920 \u2192 already true? No \u2192 used(0) is T \u2192 thus the loop condition evaluates to .not. used(0) is F \u2192 exit loop. \n\nThus the loop ran 3 times, and cur is 3 \u2192 so positions 0,1,2 are set \u2192 the array can hold 0-based up to index 2 (N=3 elements okay, as 0:2). \n\nThus the maximum size needed is N-1 \u2192 allocated as pos(0:N-1) is OK.\n\nThe loop runs until the next is inside the used array (current next is the first repeated one). \n\nWhen next is encountered again, the loop stops, so the loop ran (cur) number of loops without checking the last time (the step would have set pos[cur], but large cur?\n\nNo, in the code\u2019s loop:\n\n the loop will process next (before updating) only while before loop:\n\nLet me trace this case with N=3:\n\nInitial next=0, loop condition is T \u2192 enter.\n\n- mark used(0)=T, set idx(0)=0, pos[0]=0 \u2192 next becomes A(0). \uff08say A(0)=1\uff09\n\n cur is incremented to1.\n\nNext loop iteration:\n\nnext=1 \u2192 not used \u2192 proceed.\n\nmark, set idx[1]=1, pos[1]=1 \u2192 next becomes A(1) (say 2).\n\ncur to2.\n\nThird iteration: next=2.\n\n mark used(2)=T, idx[2]=2, pos[2]=2. next becomes A(2) \u21920.\n\n cur incremented to 3.\n\n Check condition: next is0 (which is now marked as used \u2192 thus the loop's condition is .not. used(next is) ?\n\nUsed(next=0) \u2192 is T \u2192 thus not true \u2192 loop exits.\n\nThus, the positions assigned are 0,1,2 \u2192 pos has indices up to 2 (N-1). \n\nThus the array is sufficient.\n\nThus the initial allocation of pos as allocatable 0:N-1 is okay.\n\nWhew.\n\nThus the Fortran code should work.\n\nNow, translating variables and structure correctly.\n\nPossible final code:\n\nHere's the code written properly with variables declared and allocations.\n\nThe program is translated carefully."
