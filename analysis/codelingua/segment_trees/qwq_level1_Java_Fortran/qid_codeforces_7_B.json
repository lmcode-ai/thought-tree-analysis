Then check if len ==n (2). So yes, then the start is i (3) -n (2) +1 = 2. So that's the starting index. So indices 2 and 3 (i=2 and 3) need to be set. Wait but wait, when i is up to 3, then i-n+1 is 2. Then the loop breaks. So the start is 2, and the length is n, so the indices 2 to 2 + n -1 (inclusive) are the allocated space. Therefore, in Fortran, the code needs to loop from i=0 to m-1 (0-based). Wait, note in Java, the loop is for (i from 0 to m-1). So in Fortran, with indices from 0 to m-1, the same logic can be applied.",

Looking back at the 'alloc' code in fortran:\n\nThe variables are initialized as canAlloc = .false and len=0, start_pos =0 or -1, which should be correct. Wait start_pos is initialized to -1 to have a placeholder. In the Java code, during the loop, upon finding that len == n, then start_pos =i-n+1. So in fortran, must set start_pos to that value.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I need to understand what the Java code is doing. The program handles allocation, erasure, and defragmentation of memory blocks. The main thing is that the Java code uses an array called memory to keep track of allocated blocks, where each element is an ID if allocated or 0 if free. \n\nStarting with declarations: The Java code has a Scanner for input, reads t and m as integers, and initializes memory as an integer array of size m. \n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to declare variables. Let's see. The main differences are in loops, arrays, and certain functions like Scanner. \n\nFirst, the input. Java uses Scanner, but in Fortran, I can read from stdin. The main variables are t (number of test cases), m (size of memory array). The memory array in Java is 0-based, so in Fortran, which typically uses 1-based (but can be adjusted), I should make sure to adjust the indices properly. Maybe it's better to use arrays starting at 1 here? Or maybe 0. Wait, since in Java they use 0-based (as the loops start from i=0). So perhaps in Fortran, I can set the lower bound to 0. But Fortran arrays can have arbitrary lower bounds. So I can declare the array as dimension(0: m-1). \n\nLet me note the variables:\n\nint t = s.nextInt();\nint m = s.nextInt();\nint[] memory = new int[m]; --> so size is m elements, from 0 to m-1.\n\nIn Fortran: declare memory as an integer array with m elements (assuming 0-based indices). So:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:m-1) :: memory\nBut in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. So first, we need to read m first. Hmm, but m is input. So maybe use a parameter or read m first. Since variables are needed before use, perhaps the approach is to first read m and t. So that we can declare arrays with m. Wait, but in Fortran, array dimensions can be variables if using allocatable arrays. Oh right! \n\nAlternatively, use allocatable arrays. \n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can declare memory as an integer array with allocatable. Let me plan the steps:\n\n1. Read t and m from input. \n2. Allocate an array memory of size m, initialized to 0. \n\nBut allocation in Fortran is done with allocate(memory(m)), but indices will start at 1? Unless specified otherwise. Hmm. Since Java's code uses 0-based indices, to avoid confusion, maybe we can use the same. \n\nFortran's default is 1-based. However, in the code, it's better to have the same indices as the original code to make it easier. \n\nSo perhaps declare memory as dimension(0:m-1), so indices go 0 to m-1. But this requires the upper bound to be set at definition time, which requires knowing m, which is input. \n\nAlternatively, use allocatable arrays with the lower bound set to 0. So:\n\nallocate (memory(0:m-1)) \n\nThat's possible. So:\n\nallocatable:: memory(:)\n\nafter reading m, allocate as allocate( memory(0:m-1), source=0 ) \n\nOkay.\n\nNow the main loop: for j from 0 to t-1 (since Java uses j=0 to t-1 in the for loop with j < t).\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent loop would be a do loop from 1 to t. Wait, because Java's for (int j=0; j < t; j++) which is 0-based, but in Fortran usually 1-based. However, variable loop indices can start at zero. \n\nWait, variables in Fortran can have any starting point. So perhaps the java loop:\n\nfor (int j =0; j < t; ++j) { ... }\n\nIn Fortran, it can be written as:\n\ninteger :: j\ndo j=0, t-1\n    ...\nend do\n\nBut variables must be declared before loops. So first, make sure j is declared. \n\nThe main point is that in each loop iteration, process the current command.\n\nJava's approach uses a switch on s.next(). In Fortran, there's no switch, but we can read the next token as a string, and then use if-then-else constructs.\n\nSo the first thing in each iteration is to read the command: something like 'alloc', 'erase', 'defragment'.\n\nIn Java, it's s.next(), which reads the next token. But in Fortran, reading a string is a bit more involved. We can use read(*,*) to read a string. \n\nWait, but in Java, the input can be space-separated, and the code uses next() to read tokens sequentially. So in Fortran, the same approach can be taken by using list-directed input. \n\nAt the start of each loop iteration:\n\nRead the command from stdin as a string. \n\nSimilarly, then read any following integers (like in 'alloc n', 'erase x', etc). \n\nSo first, for each case:\n\nCase \"alloc\":\n    Read next integer n\n    Then process\n\nCase \"erase\":\n    Read next integer x, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, for example, code may look like:\n\nread(*,*) command\nif (command == 'alloc') then\n    read(*,*) n\n    ... do allocation\nelse if (command == 'erase') then\n    read(*,*) x\n    ...\nelse if (command == 'defragment') then\n    ... no arguments, so nothing to read.\nelse\n    ... default case (Java prints \"h\" here, so same)\nend if\n\nBut wait, when reading command and n in 'alloc', after reading command, the 'n' is next token. Since list-directed input in Fortran allows that. For example, after reading the command, the read statement for n can simply be read(*,*, iostat=...) to catch possible errors, but perhaps in the problem's case, the inputs are correct? Not sure, but perhaps assuming that inputs are correctly given as per problem statements.\n\nNow, handling each case:\n\nStarting with the 'alloc' command.\n\nalloc code in java:\n\nint n = s.nextInt();\n        int len =0;\n        boolean canAlloc=false;\n        for (int i=0; i <m; i++) {\n            if (memory[i] ==0)  len++;\n            else len=0;\n            if (len ==n) {\n                canAlloc = true;\n                len = i - n +1;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\nThen, if canAlloc, set the memory from len to len +n -1 to allocIdx ( incrementing allocIdx first? Wait no:\n\njava code for 'alloc' has:\n\nallocIdx starts at 0 before first use?\n\nWait, looking at the Java code: \n\nint allocIdx =0;\n\nthen, in alloc case:\n\n                if (canAlloc) {\n                    allocIdx++;\n                    for (int i = len; i < len +n; i++) memory[i] = allocIdx;\n                    System.out.println(allocIdx);\n                } else System.out.println(\"NULL\");\n\n\nWait, the allocIdx is initialized to 0. The first allocation increments it to 1. So in F90, allocIdx should start as an integer initialized to 0. Doesn other parts of the code use allocIdx?\n\nWait the first and all allocations increment it, so when 'alloc' is done, every call to 'alloc' that can allocate gives a new id, starting at 1, 2, etc. If a previous allocation was freed, but in 'erase' the IDs can be reused? Wait no, because erase just sets memory elements to 0. The next allocation uses the current allocIdx. \n\nSo in Fortran, have an integer alloc_id initialized to 0. Then in 'alloc' block: \n\nif (can allocate) then\n    alloc_id = alloc_id +1 \n    write(*,*) alloc_id\n    ... \n    loop and set the memory block to that ID. \n\nWait in the Java code, allocID starts at 0, then increments to 1 first time. Because the code was:\n\nint allocIdx = 0; \n\nand when allocated, it does:\n\nallocIdx++, then uses allocId. So first allocation is 1.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, declare alloc_id starts at 0.\n\nNow, in the 'alloc' processing:\n\nThe algorithm looks for the first contiguous block of n zeros, tracking the current streak. The 'len' variable is the current length of the current zero-streak, and when it reaches n, the starting index is i -n +1 (since the first element is at i -n +1, the next is up to i). \n\nWait the code in Java: \n\nfor (i =0 ...)\n\nif (memory[i] is zero, then len increases by 1. Else reset len to zero. \n\nWhenever the len reaches exactly n, then the start is the starting index where the contiguous streak started. \n\nThe code then sets canAlloc to true. The code records len as (i -n +1), then breaks the loop. \n\nWait let's see: suppose n is 2, and the memory array has positions [0][1][0][0]. So when i=2, memory[i] is 0, len becomes 1 (after previous being 0 at i=1). At i=3, memory[i]=0, len becomes 2. Then check if len ==n (2). So yes, then the start is i (3) -n (2) +1 = 2. \n\nSo that's the starting index. So indices 2 and 3 (i=2 and 3) need to be set. \n\nWait but wait, when i is up to 3, then i-n+1 is 2. Then the loop breaks. So the start is 2, and the length is n, so the indices 2 to 2 + n -1 (inclusive) are the allocated space. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code needs to loop from i=0 to m-1 (0-based). Wait, note in Java, the loop is for (i from 0 to m-1). \n\nSo in Fortran, with indices from 0 to m-1, the same logic can be applied.\n\nNow, translating to Fortran code for 'alloc':\n\nvariables needed:\n\ninteger :: len, n, can_alloc, start_pos, i\n\nlen=0\n\ncan_alloc = 0 (since Fortran uses 0 for .false. and 1 for .true.? Wait, logical variables are better. Wait, Fortran has logicals. Let's see.\n\nRevising variables:\n\nMaybe better to use logicals for canAlloc.\n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nlogical :: canAlloc \n\ncanAlloc = .false.\n\nstart_pos = -1\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=0, m-1\n\n    if (memory(i) == 0 ) then \n\n        len = len +1\n\n    else\n\n        len =0 \n\n    end if\n\n    if ( len ==n ) then \n\n        canAlloc = .true. \n\n        start_pos = i -n +1 \n\n        exit ! similar to break in for loop\n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nThen, if canAlloc is true:\n\nalloc_id = alloc_id +1 \n\ndo k = start_pos, start_pos + n-1 \n\n    memory(k) = alloc_id \n\nend do \n\nwrite(*,*) alloc_id \n\nElse: \n\nwrite(*,*) \"NULL\"\n\nOkay.\n\nNow for the 'erase' case:\n\nJava code:\n\nint x= s.nextInt();\n\nif x <=0, then output \"ILLEGAL...\"\n\nElse, loop through memory and set any elements equal to x to 0, and check if any was found. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nFirst read x via read(*,*) x \n\nif (x <=0) then\n\n    write(*,*) \"ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT\"\n\nelse\n\n    hasErased = .false. (logical)\n\n    do i=0, m-1 \n\n        if (memory(i) == x) then\n\n            memory(i) = 0 \n\n            hasErased = .true. \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    if (.not. hasErased) then \n\n        write(*,*) \"ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT\"\n\n    end if \n\nend if\n\nWait, but in the code, after erasing, if x was not present anywhere, the output happens. So that's the structure. Need to track whether any element was set to 0 (i.e., x was in memory). \n\nNow, the 'defragment' command.\n\nIn Java, the code:\n\n            case \"defragment\":\n\n                int d = 0;\n\n                for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n\n                    if (memory[i] == 0) {\n\n                        d++;\n\n                    } else {\n\n                        memory[i - d] = memory[i];\n\n                    }\n\n                }\n\n                for (int i = m - d; i < m; i++) memory[i] = 0;\n\nThis is moving all non-zero elements to the left, filling the zeros. \n\nLet me think of the logic here.\n\nThe variable 'd' counts the number of zeros encountered so far. For each position i, if memory[i] is 0, increment d. Else, move that element to position i-d, because there are d spaces before i filled with zeros. \n\nThen, after processing all elements, from (m-d) to end (m-1?), set those to 0. \n\nIn Fortran, same approach. The indices can be the same (0-based). \n\nBut in fortran, arrays can be 0-based, so let's see:\n\ninteger :: i, d=0 \n\ndo  i=0, m-1 \n\n    if (memory(i) ==0 ) then \n\n        d = d +1 \n\n    else \n\n        memory( i - d ) = memory(i) \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\n! Now, from (m -d ) up to m-1, set to zero \n\ndo i= m-d, m-1 \n\n    memory(i) =0 \n\nend do \n\nWait but must check that m-d >=0 \n\nWait, m-d can be 0? Let's see if d is the count of zeros up to m-1. \n\nWait the loop over i from 0 to m-1:\n\nAt each i:\n\nFor 0-based indices. So yes, the Fortran code can do the same.\n\nWait wait, when moving the elements:\n\nSuppose that for an element at position i:\n\n if it's non-zero, then the target position is i -d. \n\nBecause for example, if d is the number of zeros encountered before or at i, then all previous zeros would have caused the d to increment, so for the element at i, its proper position is shifted left by d.\n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work as in Java.\n\nNow putting all together. Now the skeleton:\n\nProgram codeforces_7_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id\n\ninteger, allocatable :: memory(:)\n\nlogical :: canAlloc, hasErased \n\ncharacter(len=20) :: command ! to read the command string, since 'defragment' is longer than 8 characters. \n\n! Read t and m \n\nread(*,*) t, m \n\nallocate( memory(0:m-1), source=0 )\n\nalloc_id =0 \n\ndo j=1, t ! starts from 1 to t, since in fortran do loops can start anywhere. \n\n    read(*,*) command \n\n    select case (command)\n\n        case('alloc')\n\n            read(*,*) n \n\n            ... processing alloc \n\n        case('erase')\n\n            read(*,*) x \n\n            ... processing erase \n\n        case('defragment')\n\n            process defrag\n\n        case default\n\n            write(*,*) 'h'\n\n    end select \n\nend do \n\ndeallocate(memory)\n\nend program\n\nWait the variable names and structure need to be properly replaced. \n\nBut the 'defrag' case has no parameters, so after the case selection, read the next input is only for the 'alloc' or 'erase'.\n\nWait, for the 'defragment' command: in the case, there's no further input. So the read of command is sufficient.\n\nNow, let me write each case step by step.\n\nStarting with alloc:\n\nIn 'alloc' case:\n\n  read(*,*) n \n\n  len=0 \n\n  start_pos = -1 \n\n  canAlloc = .false. \n\n  do i=0, m-1 \n\n    if (memory(i) ==0) then \n\n        len = len+1 \n\n    else \n\n        len=0 \n\n    end if \n\n    if ( len ==n) then \n\n        canAlloc =.true.\n\n        start_pos = i -n +1 \n\n        exit \n\n    end if \n\n  end do \n\n  if (canAlloc) then \n\n      alloc_id = alloc_id +1 \n\n      ! fill from start to start_pos + n -1 \n\n      do iii=start_pos, start_pos +n-1 \n\n          memory(iii) = alloc_id \n\n      end do \n\n      write(*,*) alloc_id \n\n  else \n\n      write(*,*) 'NULL'\n\n  end if \n\nWait variable names: variables like len and start_pos are needed. These can be declared in the variables section.\n\nSimilarly in the 'erase' case:\n\nWhen command is 'erase':\n\n    read(*,*) x \n\n    hasErased = .false. \n\n    if (x <1) then \n\n        write(*,*) 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n\n    else \n\n        do i=0, m-1 \n\n            if (memory(i) ==x) then \n\n                memory(i)=0 \n\n                hasErased = .true. \n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n        if (.not. hasErased) then \n\n            write(*,*) 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n\n        end if \n\n    end if \n\nWait the condition in Java was x <=0, so in Fortran x <1 since x is an integer. So yes.\n\nNow the defragment case:\n\n  d=0 \n\n  do i=0, m-1 \n\n    if (memory(i) ==0) then \n\n        d=d+1 \n\n    else \n\n        memory(i-d)= memory(i) \n\n    end if \n\n  end do \n\n  ! after that, set from m-d to m-1 to 0 \n\n  do i=m-d, m-1 \n\n      memory(i)=0 \n\n  end do \n\nWait wait in code: after processing all elements up to m-1, then from m-d to m-1, set zero. \n\nWait original code: for (int i=m-d; i < m; i++ ) memory[i] =0; \n\nWhich in 0-based is the same as Fortran's do i = m-d, m-1. \n\nBut in the for loop, i is up to m-1 (since m is the size). So yes. \n\nNow variables:\n\nWe need to have d as an integer, declared. Need to declare d in variables section.\n\nAll variables must be declared before use. Let me list them:\n\nThe program's variables:\n\ninteger :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id \n\nAlso, the memory array. For logical variables:\n\nlogical canAlloc, hasErased, etc. Wait no, for each case, the variables canAlloc and so on are needed for that case. Since they are inside different scopes, but in Fortran, variables declared in the program can be used. So since the variables canAlloc, start_pos, len are used only in the 'alloc' case, perhaps they can be declared locally within the alloc case section? Or perhaps it's better to have them as variables in the program, reinitialized each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe variables like these can be declared within the subroutine, but in this case, since it's a program, we have to handle them all in the main block.\n\nWait the variables used in the 'alloc' case: canAlloc is a logical variable. len is an integer (counter), start_pos as integer.\n\nSimilarly, for 'erase', hasErased is logical. \n\nSo better to declare these variables at the top. \n\nTherefore, in variables declaration section:\n\ninteger :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id \n\ninteger :: len, start_pos ! for alloc case \n\nlogical :: canAlloc, hasErased \n\nSo variables len and start_pos are declared as integers, canAlloc, hasErased as logicals, even if used conditionally. Their values will be scorable in any case, but in other cases, they can be whatever. Since in loops, these are reinitialized before use, so okay.\n\nWait but even better, to initialize them every time they are needed. \n\nIn the alloc case:\n\n    ... \n\n    read(*,*) n \n\n    len =0 \n\n    canAlloc = .false. \n\n    start_pos = -1 \n\nand others start in each case. \n\nBut variables must be declared, regardless. \n\nOkay, proceeding.\n\nNow, test the variables' initializations.\n\nAlloc_id is initialized to 0 before the loop. So that the first alloc will start at 1, as per Java code's allocIdx.\n\nNow, testing possible edge cases:\n\n- What happens if the first alloc, and no space? Output 'NULL'\n\n- Erasing a number that exists but x>0: okay. If zero: error message.\n\n- Erasing a non-existing number: error.\n\n- Defrag: moving all used blocks to the left, then zeros on the right.\n\nNow the only possible problem may be the bounds and array indexing.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran allocatable arrays are initialized with allocate( memory(0:m-1), source=0 ), which should set all elements to zero as in Java.\n\nAnother possible issue: when processing a command, the next token for n or x may be read correctly. \n\nWait the way inputs are read in the case 'alloc' is a read after the command read. So for 'alloc' command line, the syntax would have \"alloc\" followed by integer n, so in fortran, after reading the command string, the next read is to get n via read(*,*) n. But because list-directed input can have spaces, but the command is a character that is read in a separate read statement. Wait, perhaps the read for the command is using a format which may not advance the record?\n\nWait in Fortran, the default list-directed input is free-format. When reading the command and subsequent numbers, the reads may not be in the same statement. So in the first 'alloc' line, the first read(*,* ) command will read the \"alloc\" string. Then the next read (bare read for the 'alloc n') reads n. \n\nWait but in list-directed input, after reading \"alloc\" as a string, the next read is the next token, which is the n. So that is okay. \n\nYes, because the read for the command reads just that token. Then the next read for \"alloc\" case is read(*,*) n, which will take the next token. \n\nSame for erase: read command as \"erase\", then next read reads x. \n\nTherefore the inputs should be read correctly. \n\nNow putting everything together:\n\nThe full code in Fortran would be as follows:\n\nNow, in code:\n\n```fortran\nprogram codeforces_7_B\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id, len, start_pos\n    integer, allocatable :: memory(:)\n    logical :: canAlloc, hasErased\n    character(len=20) :: command\n\n    read(*,*) t, m\n    allocate(memory(0:m-1), source=0)\n\n    alloc_id = 0\n\n    do j = 1, t\n        read(*,*) command\n\n        select case (command)\n            case ('alloc')\n                read(*,*) n\n                len = 0\n                canAlloc = .false.\n                start_pos = -1\n                do i = 0, m-1\n                    if (memory(i) == 0) then\n                        len = len + 1\n                    else\n                        len = 0\n                    end if\n                    if (len == n) then\n                        canAlloc = .true.\n                        start_pos = i - n + 1\n                        exit\n                    end if\n                end do\n                if (canAlloc) then\n                    alloc_id = alloc_id + 1\n                    do k = start_pos, start_pos + n -1\n                        memory(k) = alloc_id\n                    end do\n                    print *, alloc_id\n                else\n                    print *, 'NULL'\n                end if\n            case ('erase')\n                read(*,*) x\n                hasErased = .false.\n                if (x <= 0) then\n                    print *, 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n                else\n                    do i = 0, m-1\n                        if (memory(i) == x) then\n                            memory(i) = 0\n                            hasErased = .true.\n                        end if\n                    end do\n                    if (.not. hasErased) then\n                        print *, 'ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT'\n                    end if\n                end if\n            case ('defragment')\n                d = 0\n                do i = 0, m-1\n                    if (memory(i) == 0) then\n                        d = d + 1\n                    else\n                        memory(i - d) = memory(i)\n                    end if\n                end do\n                do i = m - d, m-1\n                    memory(i) = 0\n                end do\n            case default\n                print *, 'h'\n        end select\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(memory)\n\nend program codeforces_7_B\n```\n\nBut wait, in the 'defragment' loop:\n\nin the first loop (i from 0 to m-1), when moving elements:\n\nThe elements are being written into memory(i -d). \n\nBut when you are processing elements in sequence, and updating the memory array in place, this can overwrite subsequent memory. \n\nWait the Java code loops through the array once, moving elements. How does this work with the indices?\n\nIn the Java code's 'defragment' case:\n\nd is the number of zeros found so far. When we see a non-zero element, we place it into (i - d). This is possible because all previous elements after (i-d) are non-zero? Not necessarily. Wait maybe since d is the number of zeros found up to current index i, the previous elements (0..i-1) may have some zeros, but we move over them as we go. \n\nThe algorithm here effectively packs all non-zero elements to the left, over the zeros. Due to processing in order, the elements are shifted left as they are encountered (since the initial part is zeros up until some point and then non-zeros). \n\nThis approach requires that when processing i, memory[i-d] isn't in a position that has not been processed yet.\n\nBut let me see with an example: suppose i is at position where d is 2. So when processing the current element (non-zero), it's placed into position i -2. The next elements will have their d count, so for example, perhaps it overwrites some future (i + ...).\n\nWait maybe this is okay, because all positions before (i) have already been handled.\n\nWait here's an example:\n\nOriginal array:\n\n0 0 3 0 4\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3,4 (assuming m=5)\n\nProcess:\n\ni=0: memory[i] is 0. d increments to 1.\n\ni=1: also 0, d becomes 2.\n\ni=2: memory(2)=3. It's non-zero. \n\nwe set memory[2 - 2] = memory[2]. So memory[0] =3. \n\nNow the array is [3,0,3,0,4]\n\nThen d is still 2.\n\ni=3: it's 0 again. d becomes 3.\n\ni=4: 4. \n\nmemory(i-d) is 4-3=1 (since current d is 3. \n\nSet memory[1] =4. \n\ni=4 done. \n\nNow after that first loop, the memory array is [3,4,3, ... etc. ?\n\nWait let's track step by step:\n\nInitialize:\n\nmem[0..4] =0,0,3,0,4 \n\nd=0\n\ni=0:\n\nmem[i] is 0: d becomes 1 \n\ni=1:\n\nmem[1]=0 \u2192d=2\n\ni=2: 3 (non-zero):\n\nmem[2-2 (which is 0)] \u2192 set mem[0]=3. \n\nNow, mem[0:4] is [3, 0, 3, 0,4 ]\n\ni=3 is 0 \u2192d=3\n\ni=4:4 \u2192 mem[4-3] =1 \n\nSo set mem[1] =4. \n\nThe array becomes [3,4,3, 0 (still?), since i=3 was 0 \u2192 d is now 3 up to i=3?\n\nWait at i=3:\n\nd was already 2 at i=2. \n\nWhen i=3, mem[i] (position3) is 0 \u2192d becomes 3. \n\nNow at i=4, which is 4 (non-zero):\n\nthe current d is 3. \n\nSo position is 4-3=1. \n\nThus mem[4-3] is=4 \u2192 mem[1]=4. \n\nAfter first loop:\n\nProcessing all elements:\n\nThe array after first loop will be:\n\nFirst 0 position:\n\nmem[0] was set to 3 (from i=2), then the 3 (mem[2])?\n\nWait perhaps the current step for i=2 reads. \n\nAt step 2, after writing mem[0] =3, but the original value may be overwritten? \n\nIs this a problem?\n\nIt depends on the order of operations. \n\nThis approach of doing the assignments in the first loop overwrites previous positions, but since we've already passed them, it's okay. Because when we move an element to position (i - d), that position was already processed and written (since all previous elements before index (i-d) were handled before processing this i. \n\nWait no. Because when moving to positions i-d, which might be less than the current i. \n\nHmm, but the algorithm works as in Java, so perhaps it's okay. \n\nBut I'll check. \n\nFollowing the example through after the first loop:\n\nAfter first loop, the array is:\n\nmem(0)=3, \n\nmem(1) =4 (after i=4's processing), \n\nmem(2) is still 3 (from the first time? no. \n\nWait let me step through the example step by step:\n\nOriginal: indices 0->4: 0,0,3,0,4 \n\nLoop starts with d=0.\n\ni=0:\n\nmem[0] is 0 \u2192d=1.\n\ni=1:\n\nmem[1] is0 \u2192d=2.\n\ni=2:\n\nmem[2]=3 \u2192non-zero.\n\nSo memory[i-d] = mem[2 -2=0] \u2192 set to 3. \n\nmem[0] now 3. \n\nAlso, the existing 3 is now moved, but the original 3 at m[2] is still there until overwritten?\n\nWait, because the loop runs, but the elements beyond i may still need their original values. So by overwriting it in place, this approach may lose some data.\n\nAh! Here's a problem.\n\nIn the Java code's defragment:\n\nThe Java code's code processes the memory array in place, by shifting non-zero entries to the left, leaving gaps for the zeros. \n\nHowever, in the way this is done in the current Fortran code, when modifying memory(i -d), which may be positions already processed. \n\nWait the key is that the next elements are written later so that the \"left side\" is already filled and the 'right' side is to be filled. \n\nWait but in Java, this works because in the first pass, when moving i from 0 to m-1, the element at position i is only copied to i-d (the new position) if it is non-zero. The non-zero entries are overwritten into the relevant positions, but the source might have already been read before. \n\nThere might be a problem here when sliding blocks. For example, in sequence when copying from the end, but in the current algorithm of overwriting to the left, perhaps it's still possible. Wait, perhaps it's implemented carefully.\n\nFor example, consider the initial array:\n\n0 1 0 2 3 \n\nm=5.\n\nThen d starts 0. \n\ni=0:\n\nIs it 0 \u2192d=1.\n\ni=1: non-zero (1). \n\nSet memory[1-1=0] to 1 \u2192 now array is 1,1,0,2,3 \u2192 but no, original value?\n\nWait no, the array starts as [0,1,0,2,3].\n\nProcessing at i=0:\n\nd increments to1.\n\nNext i=1 (element 1 (non-zero)):\n\nso, set memory(1-1=0) to 1. \n\nso now memory[0] is 1. \n\nThen move to i=2 (element 0). d becomes 2.\n\ni=3: element2 \u2192 is non-zero.\n\nSo set memory(3-2)=1 \u2192 that is 3-2=1 \u2192 set memory[1]=2? \n\nWait let's follow step by step.\n\nLet's retrace with example:\n\nInitial array: [0,1,0,2,3], m=5.\n\nd=0\n\ni=0 \u21920 \u2192d becomes 1.\n\ni=1 \u21921 (non-zero). \n\nSet memory[1-1] = memory[1] \u2192 memory[0] becomes 1 (original was 0).\n\nd remains 1.\n\ni=2 \u21920 \u2192d=2.\n\ni=3 \u21922 (non-zero). \n\nSet memory(3-2)= memory(3)\u2192 position 1. So memory[1] becomes 2 (from the 2 in memory[3]. \n\nThen, the current memory array [1 (0?), 2, 0,2,3] \u2192 not sure.\n\nWait, let's step further.\n\nAfter i=3:\n\nAt i=3, the element is 0? No, it was 2?\n\nWait the original third element (i=3) is 2.\n\nSo setting memory[3-2 =1] to 2. So that position1 now has value 2.\n\ni=3 finished. \n\ni=4 (element 3). \n\nnon-zero. \n\nSet memory(4-2 (d is now 2?) Wait the d at i=4 is:\n\nBefore processing i=4, d is 2 (from i=2 being 0). \n\nProcessing i=4:\n\nsince 4's element is 3 (non-zero), then d remains, memory[4-2=2] (position2) is set to 3. \n\nNow, after first loop, the first elements:\n\npositions 0-4:\n\nAt this point, what are the elements? Let's see.\n\nAfter all steps:\n\nInitial mem:\n\nindexes (0 1 2 3 4)\n\nvalues 0 1 0 2 3 \n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: d=1 \n\ni=1 (element1 is 1 \u2192 non-zero:\n\nso memory[1-1] =1 \u2192 mem[0]=1. Then proceed. \n\ni=2 is 0 \u2192d=2. \n\ni=3 is 2(non-zero):\n\nSet memory[3-2 (1)] to 2 \u2192 memory at 1 becomes 2. \n\ni=4 is 3\u2192 non-zero. \n\nSet mem[4-2(2)] =3 \u2192 mem[2] is set to 3. \n\nSo the array after first pass is:\n\nmem[0] =1 \n\nmem[1]=2 \n\nmem[2] =3 \n\nAnd the positions 3 and4 remain whatever? Because the next elements are not being processed beyond.\n\nWait no, we are processing all elements up to i=4. \n\nWait, let's track all step steps:\n\nAfter i=4 (element 3 is 3):\n\nd is still 2 (because after i=3, 2 wasn't zero, so d remains). \n\nProcessing i=4 (3, value is 3):\n\nSo, non-zero \u2192 set memory[4-2(2)] to 3. \n\nThus, the element at position2 (originally 0) is now 3. \n\nSo after the first loop, the array becomes:\n\nmem[0] =1,\n\nmem[1]=2,\n\nmem[2] =3,\n\nmem[3] remains 2 (because was set when i=3)?\n\nNo, because when processing i=3, the code was modifying memory[3-2], that is index 1. So the original element at i=3 (value 2) is written into memory[1] (overwriting previous value there?), but the original i=3's value was 2, which now is stored in position 1. But what happens to the original i=3's position?\n\nYes, the original array's current memory[i] is left as it is. However, since for i=3, the code did not set memory[3] to zero. But, in the first loop, the code only writes to memory[i-d], but the current location is not handled. \n\nThus, the process is that elements are shifted left over zeros, leaving the following elements to be processed. \n\nThus, in the example:\n\nAfter first loop:\n\n    for the entire array:\n\n        let me apply the loop steps again step by step.\n\n        Let me see after first loop, the final array before doing the second loop that zero-fills:\n\n        The first loop leaves memory that way:\n\n            For each element in 0 to m-1, after processing each i, \n\n            the slots where i is non-zero are set to memory(i-d) \n\n            but the original position (i) remains whatever was there before?\n\n            Because after processing element at i, the element's value is not zeroed yet, but only copied elsewhere.\n\n            Thus, when the second loop runs (after the first loop), it then sets the trailing zeros.\n\n        Wait, no. \n\n        The second loop in the code sets the elements from (m-d) to end to zero. So after the first loop:\n\n            the array will have the non-zero elements packed towards the left, but the original positions may have non-zero. \n\nLet me compute the first loop's end result for the sample array:\n\nThe first loop for the example in Java simulation:\n\n        Let's see:\n\nInitial array: [0,1, 0, 2, 3]\n\nd is initialized as 0.\n\nLoop:\n\ni=0 (0):\n\n    0 \u2192d=1 \u2192 d=1.\n\ni=1 (1):\n\n    not 0 \u2192 set mem[0] to 1 (since i-d is 0). \n\n    The original array now has mem[0]=1, but the current memory[1] is still 1? \n\nNo, because the code doesn't change the original element. It's just that the memory[i-d] is set. \n\nWait in java's code:\n\nmemory is updated during that first loop. \n\nWait in the code, after moving an element, the original spot (i) is left as it was? Or is it overwritten? \n\nWait the code in Java's defragment loop:\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n                if (memory[i] == 0) d++;\n                else memory[i -d] = memory[i];\n            }\n\nSo when it's non-zero, it assigns memory[i-d] = memory[i]. It does not set memory[i] to anything. \n\nTherefore, the memory[i] at the current position (i) remains whatever it was. \n\nTherefore, after the loop, the elements are being copied to their new positions but the original positions still have their data. \n\nThus, in the unprocessed example, after processing the each i:\n\nAfter first loop of defrag, and not the second:\n\nTake the example:\n\nOriginal array:\n\nindices 0 1 2 3 4 \u2192 values:0,1,0,2,3 \n\nProcessing i=0. \n\nvalue is 0 \u2192d becomes 1. \n\nprocessing i=1:\n\nit is 1 \u2192 non-zero. \n\nSet memory[1-1 (0)] \u2192 set mem[0] to1. \n\nNow the array becomes: [1,1,0,2,3]. \n\nmem[1] is still 1 (unchanged), and mem[0]=1 now.\n\ni=2: 0 \u2192 increases d to 2.\n\ni=3 (value 2):\n\n non-zero \u2192 set mem[3 - 2 =1] = 2.\n\nso mem[1] is set to 2. \n\nNow the array is [1,2,0,2,3]\n\ni=3: \n\nNow d is still 2.\n\ni=4: value3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 \n\n mem[4-2 =2 ] \u2192 pointer to 2 (zero becomes 3 \n\n setting memory[2] to 3. \n\nSo after processing this i, the elements become:\n\nmem[2] =3 (original was 0), the original position 4 (3's location) still has 3? \n\nThus the array after first loop's i=4 is:\n\n0:1,1:2,2:3, 3:2 (still from i=3?), 4:3 (still at i=4). \n\nThen the first loop ends, and d=2 (because when processing i=2 and i=0).\n\nThe total number of zeros encountered was 2? (i=0 and i=2). \n\nThen, the second loop sets memory from m-d to ... \n\n m=5, d=2 \u2192 5-2 =3 \u2192 indices 3,4. \n\nThus:\n\nset 3 and4 to zero? \n\nWait:\n\nThus, after first loop, positions 3 and4 have 2 and3, respectively.\n\nThen in second loop (i=3 to4):\n\nSet memory[3] and4 to0. \n\nSo after the second loop, the final array after defrag is:\n\nindices 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:0,4:0.\n\nThus, the final array is [1,2,3,0,0], which is correct. \n\nThe first loop moved all non-zero elements to the earliest possible spots. \n\nTherefore, in that example, it works correctly. \n\nThus, the algorithm in Fortran as translated should work correctly.\n\nAnother thing: in the loops, the variables len, start_pos, etc. must be initialized each time they are needed. \n\nLooking back at the 'alloc' code in fortran:\n\nThe variables are initialized as canAlloc = .false and len=0, start_pos =0 or -1, which should be correct. \n\nWait start_pos is initialized to -1 to have a placeholder. \n\nIn the Java code, during the loop, upon finding that len == n, then start_pos =i-n+1. So in fortran, must set start_pos to that value. \n\nNow let me check for possible off by one errors. \n\nFor e.g., the Java code uses memory[i -n +1] as the start_pos. In 0-based arrays, this is correct to get the starting position. \n\nOther considerations: \n\n- What happens if the loop finishes without finding canAlloc?\n\nYes, then output 'Null'.\n\n- 'alloc' with n=0?\n\nIn the java code, n is read via nextInt(), which can be zero but since the problem likely expects valid input. However, in the code, n could theoretically be zero, but that may lead to len comparing to n=0 (i.e., n is 0, so when len reaches 0? \n\nWait len increments when memory[i] is 0. \n\nWait for n=0: n is 0, so any area with 0 length (i.e., can be allocated with 0 space) but that probably doesn't make sense. But according to problem's input constraints, perhaps n is supposed to be at least 1. \n\nAssuming the input is according to problem specs, and not handle invalid n cases. \n\nOther possible code edge case:\n\nSuppose m is zero. But the problem states m is given, so probably m is positive. \n\nTesting for outputs:\n\nIn the 'erase' case, when x is 1 (existing ID), set all to zero. \n\nAnother possible thing: the variable d in defrag needs to be declared and properly set each loop run.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nd is declared in variables, and initialized to 0 in the defrag case's first line. \n\nYes, correct.\n\nThus, the code should translate correctly. \n\nNow implementing that code in proper Fortran.\n\nWait I forgot the variable 'k' in the allocation loop. The inner loop in alloc uses a loop variable 'k', which should be declared. \n\nAh yes, this was missing.\n\nThe loops in the 'alloc' case have a loop over k from start_pos to start_pos +n-1: \n\ndo k = start_pos, start_pos +n-1 \n\n... \n\nend do \n\nThus, 'k' must be declared. \n\nIn variables section:\n\ninteger :: k, len, start_pos, i\n\n(Also 'i' is used in loops, but in fortran, loop variables are local to the loop. Or do they need to be declared? \n\nWait in fortran:\n\nIn loops:\n\ndo i = 0, m-1\n\n    ... \n\nend do \n\nthe variable 'i' is local to the loop. \n\nWait no, actually in Fortran 90, loop indices are in the scope of the loop construct. \n\nSo in the code above, the variables 'i' and 'k' are used in loops without being globally declared. \n\nWait let me check: in the code currently written, variables:\n\nThe variables declared with the program are:\n\ninteger :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id \n\ninteger :: len, start_pos \n\nlogical :: canAlloc, hasErased \n\nothers are declared in variables? \n\nWait k and i in loops:\n\ni is used in loops in 'alloc', 'erase', 'defrag', and 'defrag's first do. \n\nFortran requires that loop index variables (such as i and k) are either declared or declared implicitly. \n\nWait the code as it was written omitted these declarations, so that's an error. \n\nThis is a critical omission.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe variables i and k (used in loops like for k in 'alloc' block, for 'alloc' and 'erase' and 'defrag') must be declared. \n\nSo adding the variables' declarations. \n\nSimilarly for the variables used in loops. let me see which variables are needed.\n\nLoop variables:\n\n- in alloc:\n\n    loops over i from 0 to m-1. \n\n    Also over 'k' in the allocating the new indices. \n\nSo in code, for the 'alloc' case: \n\n        do i = 0, ... \n\n            (i is variable not previously declared, so local?)\n\n        end do \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, loops with index variables without declaring them require that they are either implicitly integer, but the code declares them as part of program variables. \n\nThus, in variables:\n\nneed to add:\n\ninteger :: i, k \n\nSimilarly, in the 'erase' case loops over i from 0 to m-1.\n\nThus, all loop indices (variables i and k) should be declared in the variables declaration.\n\nCorrecting that:\n\nAdding to variables:\n\ninteger :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id, len, start_pos, i, k \n\nThus:\n\nin program declaration section:\n\nvariables:\n\n    integer :: m, t, j, x, n, d, alloc_id, len, start_pos, i, k \n\n    logical :: canAlloc, hasErased \n\nSo that all needed variables are declared. \n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nFinal code with these corrections."
