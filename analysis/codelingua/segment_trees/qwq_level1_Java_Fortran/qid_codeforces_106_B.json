    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the code does first. \n\nThe Java program starts by reading an integer n, then reads n quadruples of integers. Each of these quadruples has four elements: probably some dimensions and a cost. Then, it finds the \"best\" quadruple that isn't dominated by any other in terms of the first three elements being smaller, and among those non-dominated ones, it picks the one with the lowest price. Finally, it outputs the index of this chosen quadruple (plus one because arrays start at 0 in Java).\n\nNow translating this to Fortran. Hmm, first, variables in Fortran are different. Arrays start at 1 unless specified otherwise, which is important. I'll need to declare an array to hold the quadruples, and then loop through each element.\n\nFirst, let's handle input. Java uses Scanner, but in Fortran, reading is done with standard input. So we might need to use a bunch of read statements. The PrintWriter is for outputting, but in Fortran, printing is done with write.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read n rows each with 4 integers.\n3. Check each row to see if it's not dominated by any other row (i.e., its first three values are >= another row's first three values anywhere else)\n4. Among all the rows not dominated, find the one with the smallest price, then if multiple, the first one? Or wait, the Java code just takes the first occurrence when the price is lower? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the Java code's loop for ansprice: if another entry with the same price comes later, would it replace ans to the new index, so we keep the latest one? But the code says \"if (vec[i][3] < ansprice)\". So only when strictly less it updates. So equal prices won't change the answer, meaning if there are multiple entries with the minimum price, the first encountered (since the update is only when lower) keeps the first. Hmm, need to replicate that.\n\nIn the loops:\n\nThe outer loop is for each i from 0 to n-1. For each i, it checks if any other j (from 0 to n-1) has all three first elements higher. Wait, no: the condition is if (vec[i][0] < vec[j][0] && ...), so that means if any j has higher parameters in all three, then current i is dominated. So that i is skipped from consideration. Thus, if a row is not dominated, then check its price.\n\nWait, the 'fl' is set to 1 at start. For each j, if vec[i] is entirely less than j, then fl is set to 0. Wait, no, the condition is that j's values are higher. Wait, for each j, when vec[i][0]< vec[j][0], and similar for 1 and 2. So if there exists a j where this is the case, then fl becomes 0. That indicates that this i is dominated by that j (because j has larger first three elements). So the i can be skipped. So the i can only qualify if there is no such j. \n\nOnce determined that it's not dominated, then compare its price with current best. If the price is cheaper, it's the new current best, and updates the \"ans\" value (the index+1).\n\nSo the Fortran translation steps:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\n- Declare n as an integer. \n\nThe vector of quadruples. In Java, it's a 2D array vec[n][4]. In Fortran, arrays can be declared as 2D. Since Fortran is 1-based by default, perhaps we can declare an array of size (n,4), where n is the first dimension and 4 is the second. But variables in Fortran need to be declared with precise dimensions. So since n is input, we can't know until runtime, so we'll have to use a dynamic array, or use allocation. Oh right, in Fortran 90+, you can use allocatable arrays. Alternatively, read the n first, then allocate the array.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nRead n from standard input.\n\nThen, allocate an array of size n x4.\n\nRead each row with the four integers.\n\nThen the loops to compute ans.\n\nInitialize ans and ansprice.\n\nans is initially set to 500? Wait in code, Java initializes ans to 500. Let me check the code again: \"int ans =500;\". Wait that's 500? But when n is up to like some limit, but perhaps 500 is a default chosen as out of range. Well, so in Fortran, when declaring variables, if we set initial values properly. Wait, in the code, perhaps they are initializing to some invalid index but setting before processing? Actually, the code's initial ans is set to 500 (maybe arbitrarily) and then if a qualifying case is found with lower price, it's replaced. So, the initial ansprice is set to 20000, which is likely a large number. The code is looking for the minimum, so any actual price will be \u226420000.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nDefine vec(n,4). But for n which is read first.\n\nWe need to read n first. Let me outline the steps:\n\nProgram structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nAllocate the array.\n\nRead n lines of 4 integers.\n\nThen perform processing.\n\nProcessing loop as per the code.\n\nInitialization of variables.\n\nVariables:\n\nRealize that Fortran has module, etc., but perhaps making it a standalone program.\n\nFirst line: integer, parameter is not possible here, but let's see.\n\nThe code would be something like:\n\nPROGRAM CODEFORCES_B\n  implicit none\n ! variables\n integer :: n, i, j, fl, ans, ansprice\n ! and the array\n integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: vec\n\n ! Read n\n read(*,*) n\n ! Allocate array\n allocate(vec(n,4))\n\n ! Read the vectors\n do i=1, n\n    read(*,*) vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n end do\n\n ans = 500\n ansprice = 20000\n do i=1,n\n    fl = 1\n    do j=1, n\n       if (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) .and. vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) .and. vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) then\n          fl =0\n          exit  ! maybe break the loop early?\n       end if\n    end do  ! j loop\n\n    if (fl ==1) then  ! not dominated\n       if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n          ansprice = vec(i,4)\n          ans = i\n       end if\n! else, ignore\n    end if\n end do  ! i loop\n\n write(*,*) ans\n\n END PROGRAM\n\n Wait, but in Java, the ans is initialized to 500, which is the starting value. Maybe in Fortran, if all the alternatives are worse, it might stay at 500? But in the problem, perhaps there's always at least one option that is a candidate. Because in the case where no other vectors dominate, the first vector is considered, etc. So the code expects that some ans would be found.\n\n But perhaps better to set ans=0 initially, but the code in Java uses i+1 since their arrays start at 0. Wait in the Java, ans is initialized to 500, and when it's updated during the loop, they do ans =i+1 (since in Java, i starts from 0; in Fortran, i starts from 1, so in Fortran's loop over i from 1 to n, the correct index is i (but since the final answer is the index starting at 1, because in Java they added +1). Wait, the Java code's ans is set to \"i+1\" which in their code is their array's element's position (0-based), so the output is the 1-based index. So in Fortran's 0-based would not be an issue here since it's stored as 1-based in the code?\n\nIn the Fortran code, the array is 1-based, so the correct index to output is exactly i (the index in the array) since the problem expects the first element to be answer 1, etc. Hence in the Fortran code when we set \"ans =i\", which is correct. \n\nWait the original code in Java is \"ans =i+1\", so yes. For example, for the first element (i=0 Java, i=1 in Fortran), the final answer is 1. So in Fortran, ans will be set to i (the Fortran's element index), which is correct.\n\nHowever in Java the ans starts at 500. Let me see, initially ans is 500. Suppose the first vector is the candidate and has a price less than 20000, then ans becomes 1. But in Fortran, variables are initialized with whatever, so if you set ans=500, which may be a possible index only if there is more than 500 candidates. But since that's an arbitrary code setup, perhaps to start ansprice as very high. However, in Fortran, integers can be initialized using default, but to set it correctly: \n\nWait in Java, the initializations are:\n\nInitially ans =500, ansprice=20000 (a large number). So in Fortran:\n\nans should be initialized to 500, but perhaps that's not necessary. However, maybe better to set ans=0 and ansprice to some large value. However, the code logic requires that the first candidate will overwrite ans and ansprice. \n\nBut let's stick to the same numbers. Since the Java code uses 500 as the initial value of ans, in the code the initial ans in Fortran would be 500. So the code should start as:\n\nans =500\n\nansprice = 20000 \n\nThen during the loop, any candidate that's not dominated and has a price less than 20000 will replace that. \n\nAnother thing: the inner loop over j. The code in Java loops through all j from 0 to n-1. Wait the original code has the inner j loop:\n\nfor (j=0; j <n; j++) { ... }\n\nBut in the code, the condition is vec[i][0] < vec[j][0], so the same as Fortran's code with j from 1 to n.\n\nWait but in Java, j runs from 0...n-1, but in Fortran, from 1 to n. So inside each iteration, all rows (including itself?) Well, when j is equal to i, then for the elements, if i's elements were checked compared to their own, that's only true when 0 <0 (all components), but since they are equal, so no, but the condition is all components of i are less than j's. \n\nWait, for j = i, since the first components would be the same? So in that case, the condition is only true when ALL three elements of i's are strictly less than j's. So in case of j being the same as i, then the comparisons are 0 <0 (if same element) so no. Hence, the inner loop in Java checks all j, including i, but since they won't satisfy the condition when j equals i, that's fine.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the j loop is 1 to n, thereby including when j equals i, so same effect. So that's okay.\n\nNow, the inner loop in Java continues checking for all j. The fl variable is set to 0 if any j makes the condition happen. So in ForTran, the code for the inner loop:\n\nfl = 1\n\nloop over all j from 1 to n:\n\nif (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1) and vec(i,2) < vec(j,2) and vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) \n\nthen set fl=0 and break the loop (maybe using exit).\n\nWait, the original code in Java is:\n\nfor (int j =0; j <n ; j++) {\n\n   if ( ... ) {\n\n      fl =0;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut without any break. So the inner loop runs all j from 0 to n-1, and if any j passes the condition, fl is set to 0, and after all, the fl is 0. Even if found early, it has to check all j's. \n\nAh, so in Fortran, we can't break the loop, but have to continue. Or can we use a tool like continue. Alternatively, if we can break early, that would be better for efficiency. In Fortran, using the CYCLE or EXIT constructs.\n\nWait, if the condition is met (vec(i,1). is less than j's, etc) then, we can immediately set fl=0 and exit the j loop.\n\nYes. Because once we found any j that dominates (in the condition), then this i is irrelevant. So in that case, once any j meets the condition, we can break out of the inner loop and go to the next i.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran's inner loop, can do an early exit. That makes it faster. So:\n\nloop over j:\n\n   if ( (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1)) .and. (vec(i,2) < vec(j,2)) .and. (vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) ) then\n\n     fl=0\n\n     exit   ! leave the j loop. Because we don't need to check others.\n\n   end if \n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the fl would also be set for those conditions, but after all loops. However, in the Java code, the fl can stay as 1 only if none of j's pass. \n\nUsing exit is okay here because once any j causes fl to be 0, even earlier, but the rest of the j's won't change the outcome. So exiting early is better.\n\nSo that's implemented with an exit statement in the loop.\n\nHence, the inner loop in Fortran would be something like:\n\n    fl = 1\n\n    do j = 1, n\n\n      if ( (vec(i,1) < vec(j,1)) .and. (vec(i,2) < vec(j,2)) .and. (vec(i,3) < vec(j,3)) ) then\n\n         fl = 0\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n    end do\n\n   then check if fl is 1.\n\nAlternatively, to use an inline exit on that condition.\n\nThis way, the loop over j can break early, improving efficiency. \n\nSo that's acceptable. So implementing it.\n\nNow, what about variables:\n\nI need to declare all variables before using them.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nPROGRAM CODEFORCES_B\n\n IMPLICIT NONE\n\ninteger :: n, i, j, fl, ans, ansprice\n\ninteger, allocatable :: vec(:,:)\n\nREAD(*,*) n\n\nALLOCATE (vec(n,4))\n\nThen read the data.\n\nThen the main loops as above.\n\nWait the fortran variables are declared before any executable statements, so the code structure would be okay.\n\nCheck if initialization of ans and ansprice is done correctly.\n\nIn the code:\n\nans =500\n\nansprice =20000\n\nThese are variables. Since in Fortran variables are uninitialized before that assignment, this is okay.\n\nNow the loop over i:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   fl =1\n\n   do j=1, n\n\n      if ... then \n\n         fl=0\n\n         exit\n\n    end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (fl ==1) then \n\n      if (vec(i,4) < ansprice) then\n\n         ansprice = vec(i,4)\n\n         ans =i \n\n      end if\n\n   end if\n\nend do \n\nThen finally write(*,*) ans \n\nThe output is correct, as ans is 1-based. \n\nWait one thing: the Java code's loop for j is for j from 0 to n-1 (Java's loop). But in Fortran, the loop is over 1 to n. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: In Java, the array input is filled as vec[i][0], vec[i][1], etc. So in the Java code, the four elements for each row are stored in the row's first four elements. So in Fortran, the read for vec(i,1) to vec(i,4) correspond exactly. \n\nYes. The read statement in Fortran for i:\n\nRead(*,*) vec(i,1), vec(i,2), vec(i,3), vec(i,4)\n\nWhich is the same as what's being done.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code would look like this:\n\nWait also, in the code, after writing the answer, should the program terminate properly. I think the end program will do that. Also, in Fortran, after the write statement for ans, the program ends.\n\nTesting edge cases: Let me see.\n\nSuppose n =1. Then the answer will be 1, since there's no j to compare to except itself which doesn't satisfy the dominated condition. Since vec[i][3] will be <= 20000, the ans will get set to 1, unless the price was higher than 20000, but in Java code the initial ans is set to 500 but then in the loop it would be replaced, but since the price must be entered by the user. \n\nWait the code's initial ansprice is 20000. So if the entry has a cost of say 50000, then ans would not be changed from 500? But that would be an invalid scenario. But perhaps the problem ensures that there's a valid entry with cost less than 20000. Or perhaps the initial value of ansprice should be a higher value.\n\nWait in codeforces problem B of some problem, perhaps the prices are only up to 20000. So initializing to 20000 would work. \n\nIn any case, the code as per Java's structure.\n\nSo I think that's the correct translation. Let me check again.\n\nYes, so putting all together, here's the Fortran code:\n\n! Your Fortran code here."
