Wait in Fortran 90 and later, you can do dp =0 to initialize all elements. So that's fine. Now testing for the example I thought of earlier:\n\nSample input:\n\n5 \u2192 n, then the numbers 3 1 4 2 5. The code would set dp(3)=0, dp(1)=1, dp(4)=2, dp(2)=3, dp(5)=4. The next loop from i=2:\n\nFirst i=2:\n\ndp[2] =3 (from the third element's index (i=3)\n\ndp[1] =1.\n\n3 -1 \u21922, add 2.\n\ni=3 (the loops goes up to n=5):\n\ndp(3)=0 (since the first element was 3 at index 0). dp(3) and dp(2)=3's difference: 0 -3 \u2192-3 \u2192abs is 3 \u2192 now ans 5.\n\ni=4: dp(4)=2 (from index=2), dp(3)=0 \u2192 2-0 \u21922 \u2192 ans =5+2=7. Wait, wait for i=4: The term is dp(4) - dp(3): 2 - 0 \u21922 \u2192 adding to 5 \u2192 7.\n\nThen i=5 \u2192 dp(5)=4 (index 4) and dp(4)=2. difference is 2, so adding 2 gives 9. So the total is 9.

Wait in that example: x values are 1, 3, 3. The input is three numbers. The dp(x):\n\nfor the first input x=1 \u2192 set dp(1) =0 (index i=0). second x=3 \u2192 dp(3) =1 (i=1). third x=3 \u2192 dp(3) =2 (i=2). Thus, dp(1)=0, dp(3)=2, and anything else is 0.\n\nThen, the loop for i=2 to 3.\n\ni=2: dp[2] is 0, dp[1]=0 \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 total 0. i=3: dp(3) - dp(2)= 2 -0 \u21922 \u2192 so total is 2. So the ans is 2. But the correct answer? Wait in this case, the input is the array [1,3,3]. Wait the problem's problem is likely like this: The array a has elements, then compute the total of |pos_i - pos_{i-1}| for each i from 2 to n, where pos_i is the position (index starting from 0 or 1) of the element i in the array. So the problem probably expects to compute the sum for each i from 2 to n the absolute difference between the index where i appears and the index where i-1 appears in the array. So if the input array is [1,3,3], then:\n\npos_1 =0 (the position of 1 is index 0), pos_2 is not present, so maybe it's considered as the last occurrence?",

Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n from the input, then an array of n integers. It uses an array dp of size 200001 to record the index of each number in the input sequence. Wait, no, actually, looking at the loop: for each i from 0 to n-1, it takes the next integer from the input and uses that as the index of dp. So, dp[value] = current index i. So dp[array_value] holds the position where that value occurs.\n\nThen, the main part is calculating the answer by summing the absolute differences between consecutive numbers' positions. For each i from 2 to n (since the loop says i starts at 2 and goes up to n, so... Wait, but the array is from 1 to n? Or is it up to 200000? Wait the array is size 200001, so indexes from 0 to 200000. But the for loop runs i from 2 to n. But what about the elements in dp[i]? Because the input is n numbers, so each of them must be in the range 1 to n? Or not?\n\nWait in the first loop, for each i from 0 to n-1 (since it's s.nextInt() for each i < n). So, the first loop processes each of the inputs, and for each value (the nextInt()), it sets dp[value] = i. So the input array's elements are stored as indices in dp. Wait, but for instance, if the input sequence has a number which is greater than 200000, then that would cause an out-of-bounds error in Java. Because DP's size is 200001. Wait, but according to the problem (since it's codeforces 612B), likely the numbers are in 1..n, but maybe that's given in the problem.\n\nAssuming that the input consists of integers in a range such that they can fit into dp array. The question is, how to translate this into Fortran.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be set to 0-based. Also, since in Java's code, dp is size 200001 (0 to 200000), maybe in Fortran, we can make it 0-based. So I need to set the array indices accordingly.\n\nFirst, read n. Then, set up dp array. The variables in Fortran have to be declared. Let me outline the steps.\n\nStart by declaring variables:\n\nImplicit none is required. Let's structure the program.\n\nThe main program can be called PROGRAM codeforces612b, or something similar. Since the user probably wants the translation, the structure will be:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize the dp array. Since in Java, it's initialized to 0. So in Fortran: dp = 0, but Fortran needs the array to be initialized.\n\nThis part: So first, after reading n, fill dp array.\n\nWait in the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1 (since it's the code 'for ... < n'), we get the next input integer, let's call it x, then dp[x] = i.\n\nWait that's different. So for each of the n elements in the input (after n?), which forms the array a. Let me clarify the input flow. Let's see:\n\nThe Java code reads n first, then reads n integers. So the sequence is: the first input is n, followed by n integers. So the first block of code does:\n\nRead n, then loop n times, each time read a number (= a[i] if it's 0-based or 1-based?) and set dp[a[i]] = i.\n\nWait the input numbers are the values, and for each value (from input), dp[value] = current index (i). So for example, if first number after n is 5, then dp[5] = 0 (since first iteration is i=0). Second input number is 3, so dp[3] = 1. So each element in the input sequence: their value is the key, and the index is stored where their value is the array index.\n\nWait, so the dp array's index is the value from the input array. So if the input array has a value like 1000, then dp(1000) gets set to its position (index in the input sequence).\n\nTherefore, the dp array must be large enough to hold the maximum possible input value. But in the problem's context (612B), what is the constraint on the input values? Looking that up might help, but assuming that the maximum value for an input element is n, but not sure. However, given that the array is initialized to size 200001, perhaps the problem's constraints specify that the a_i are between 1 and n. Because otherwise, it would overflow.\n\nSo, the initial array in Java is 0..200000, which can handle numbers up to 200000. For maximum n's up to 2e5, which might be the case for the problem.\n\nIn Fortran, we need to create an array that can hold indices up to 200000. The index must be an integer, so the array would be dimensioned (from 0 to 200000). Wait but Fortran's arrays need declaration. So:\n\nINTEGER, DIMENSION(0:200000) :: dp\n\nThen, initializing this array to 0's is needed, but in Fortran, you need to set them to zero first, perhaps via dp = 0.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the dp is initialized when it's created (new int[...] initializes to zero). So similarly, in Fortran, we need to set the array to zero before processing.\n\nWait in the Java code, after initializing dp array, the loop runs for i from 0 to n-1. Each time, it reads a number x = s.nextInt(), and sets dp[x] = i. So any index not hit (i.e., values not encountered) would remain 0. Wait but in cases where x might be 0? Suppose the problem allows zero as input? Or maybe the input are positive integers. Hmm. But unless the problem states otherwise, better to assume that the dp array is zero-initialized. So in Fortran, the code will be something like:\n\nFirst, set dp(:) = 0, then fill in the indices.\n\nNow, the second loop, for i from 2 to n:\n\nans += absolute value of (dp[i]-dp[i-1])\n\nWait the loop in Java is for(int i=2; i<=n; i++) which runs from 2 to n inclusive. Because in Java, looping up to and including n. Wait the problem might be 1-based for the elements, so for the array elements from 1 to n.\n\nWait but where comes the n in terms of the input? The problem's actual intention is important here.\n\nBut the Java code, in its second loop is going through each i from 2 through n. So the loop steps over each i from 2 to n inclusive, and computes the difference between dp[i] and dp[i-1], and totals the absolute value.\n\nSo putting this together, the code does the following:\n\n- Read the input sequence, and for each value, store the position it was read in (the index i) into dp at the position equal to the value (since dp[val] = i).\n\n- Then, the answer accumulates the sum of absolute differences between the positions of consecutive numbers. Wait consecutive numbers? Because the loop is over i from 2 to n, and each iteration takes dp[i] and dp[i-1].\n\nAh, right, because for each integer i in 2..n (assuming that the sequence's elements are 1-based?), so the differences are between positions of numbers (i and i-1), but in terms of the indices stored in dp array. Wait perhaps the problem is similar to Codeforces problem 612B, so perhaps I can recall. But perhaps it's better to just proceed.\n\nNow, translating the loops to Fortran:\n\nIn Fortran loops are DO loops. \n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Initialize dp array from 0 to 200000, initialized to zero.\n\n3. Read the n input numbers, for each, get the value and store dp(value) = current 0-based index (i).\n\nWait but in Fortran, the loop indices are a bit different. Let's see:\n\nFirst loop:\n\ndo i = 0, n-1\n\n   read the value (call it x)\n\n   dp(x) = i? Wait but in Fortran, if x is 1-based, but the array is 0-based.\n\nWait but in the Java code, for i starting at zero, and for each x (nextInt()), which could be any number (but the code works as long as it's within the dp's range), sets dp[x] to i.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nThe loop would be:\n\nFirst, after reading n, define a variable x (INTEGER) to read the next integers. \n\nRead n first.\n\nThen, do loop from 1 to n (but Java uses i from 0 to n-1, so here, the loop over the inputs would be i from 1 to n, since Fortran can count from 1. Alternatively, starting from 0. But since Fortran's DO variable can start from 0, but indexes may start at 1, perhaps better to use 0-based for the loop. Wait Fortran arrays can be 0-based if declared as (0:200000). So the first input is n.\n\nThen, need to read n numbers. Let's see:\n\nINTEGER:: n\n\nThen:\n\nread*, n\n\nthen, allocate or declare the array.\n\nSo, array dp: dimension 0:200000, which in code is:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n\nThen:\n\ndp = 0\n\nthen, loop over i from 0 to n-1 (0-based):\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n    read*, x\n\n    dp( x ) =i\n\nend do\n\nWait but in code, this loop will read n numbers. The x is the current value, and stored as the index in dp's x-th position.\n\nWait, but Fortran uses arrays starting at lower bounds, so if x is 0, it's okay, but if x is beyond 200000, then array index is out of bounds. But since the problem probably uses x as 1 to n, but perhaps it's okay because the array is allocated as per.\n\nOnce that's done, then the second loop is for i from 2 to n.\n\nWait in the first loop, the dp array is filled with the indices of each value. So for each possible value (like, say, 1, 2, ... up to n), the dp array holds the index (0-based) where they first appeared? Wait no, not first appeared; the latest index they have. Because each time the value is read, the dp array at that x is overwritten with the current index i. So for example, if the same x is seen multiple times, dp[x] will keep the last occurrence index i.\n\nWait: the first time the code loops through the sequence, for each element (the i being 0-based) and each x is stored into dp(x) = the current index, so each x's dp(x) holds the index i where it appeared latest, because as the loop progresses, the latest index overwrites the previous value in dp[x].\n\nWait but this might not be important for the problem's purpose. Anyway, the code proceeds.\n\nNow the for loop in Java for i from 2 to <= n.\n\nIn the problem, for example, let\u2019s say n=5 and the input sequence is [3,1,4,2,5], then for each x in the array, the dp array:\n\nAt first iteration, i=0, x=3: dp[3] =0\n\ni=1 (second element) is 1 \u2192 dp[1]=1.\n\nThird element (i=2) is 4 \u2192 dp[4] =2.\n\ni=3, element 2 \u2192 dp[2]=3.\n\ni=4 (fourth element?), element 5 \u2192 dp[5]=4.\n\nWait for the loop from i=2 to 5 (wait n=5), so the loop runs for i=2,3,4,5.\n\nWait: in Java, the loop is \"for (int i = 2; i <=n; ...)\".\n\nWait n is 5, so:\n\ni =2: difference between dp[2] (which is 3) and dp[1] (1 \u2192 3-1=2. Abs: 2.\n\ni=3: dp[3] (0) - dp[2] (3 \u2192 0-3 = |-3|=3 \u2192 total so far 2+3=5\n\ni=4: dp[4]=2 - dp(3)=0 \u2192 2 \u2192 sum is 5+2=7, but wait wait.\n\nWait: let's think in the example:\n\ni runs from 2 to n:\n\nSo for each i in 2 to 5, the differences are between dp[i] and dp[i-1].\n\nFor the example:\n\ni=2:\n\ndp[2] =3 (since when i=3, the value was 2?), wait wait in the example I made, for the sequence [3,1,4,2,5]:\n\nThe values are:\n\ni=0 \u21923 \u2192 so dp(3)=0\n\ni=1 \u2192 1 \u2192 dp(1)=1\n\ni=2 \u21924 \u2192 dp(4)=2\n\ni=3 \u2192 2 \u2192 dp(2)=3 (because when x is 2 (fourth element), the index i is 3, so yes.\n\ni=4 \u21925 \u2192 dp(5)=4.\n\nThus, for the loop:\n\ni=2:\n\ndp[2] is 3, dp[1] is 1 \u2192 difference 2 \u2192 contrib 2.\n\ni=3: dp(3)=0 vs dp(2)=3 \u2192 |0\u20133|=3 \u2192 sum 5.\n\ni=4 \u2192 dp(4)=2 vs dp(3)=0 \u2192 |2-0|=2 \u2192 total 5+3 +2 = 10? Wait no, let me recalculate:\n\nWait i is iterating from 2 to n=5:\n\ni=2: |3-1| = 2 \u2192 adds 2.\n\ni=3: |dp(3)=0 minus dp(2)=3: |-3|=3 \u2192 sum now 5.\n\ni=4: dp(4)=2 vs dp(3)=0 \u2192 |2 - 0|=2. So now total 5+2=7? No, wait, 2+3+2 is 7.\n\ni=5: dp(5)=4 vs dp(4)=2 \u2192 |4-2|=2 \u2192 adding the 2 gives total 7+2=9.\n\nWait n=5. So i from 2 to 5 includes i=5, so there are 4 terms (2,3,4,5). The total would be 2 (i=2) + 3 (i=3) + 2 (i=4) +2 (i=5). Wait the last term (i=5):\n\ni=5, dp[5]=4 (from the example) and dp[4]=2 \u2192 difference 4-2=2. Adding that gives 2+3+2+2=9. So total 9.\n\nWait but in the example code's code, the code would have that.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nans =0\n\ndo i =2, n\n\n   ans = ans + ABS( dp(i) - dp(i-1) )\n\nend do\n\nPrint ans. But Fortran uses PRINT *, ans.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nVariables needed:\n\n- n is an integer, read in first.\n\n- Then, the dp array: declared as 0:200000, which in Fortran is accomplished with\n\ninteger, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n\n- x is an integer to hold the input values.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize dp array to zero.\n\nLoop over the n inputs, index starting from 0:\n\nWait in Fortran, for a loop from i=0 to n-1, since n can be up to 2e5, which is a large value. As Fortran allows i starting at 0, but the loop has to be declared correctly.\n\nWait the loop in Java is from i =0 to i < n \u2192 so the same as i from 0 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nTherefore:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n    read *, x\n\n    dp(x) =i\n\nend do\n\nBut need to make sure that when reading the n input numbers after first n, but in the program flow:\n\nRead n first, then loop n times for the next numbers, each stored in x.\n\nYes, that part is okay.\n\nNow, in Fortan, the 200001 elements array is initialized as zero before the loop. So after reading n, do:\n\ndp =0\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThen the loop for i from 2 to n:\n\nBut here, since the elements in the dp array are for i from 1 to n?\n\nWait perhaps the answer is to have the loop in Fortran as:\n\ndo i =2, n\n\nso for i =2 to n inclusive. The variables in dp(i) and dp(i-1) would need to have the appropriate indices.\n\nNow in the Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces612b\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, x, ans, i, j\n  integer, dimension(0:200000) :: dp\n \n  read *, n\n\n  dp = 0  ! Initialize to 0\n\n  do i =0, n-1\n    read *, x\n    dp(x) = i\n  end do\n\n  ans = 0\n  do i =2, n\n    ans = ans + abs( dp(i) - dp(i -1) )\n  end do\n\n  print *, ans\n\nend program\nWait, but wait, the loop over the numbers after n is done with 'read x' n times, but in Fortran, for the first read(n) then the following loop reads the n numbers. So that's okay.\n\nWait, in the code above, the first array dimension is 0:200000. That covers the possible indices up to 200000, which is the maximum possible (since the Java code had 200001 elements). \n\nNow, does Fortran allow an assignment like dp =0? Yes, because arrays can be set to scalar values.\n\nWait in Fortran 90 and later, you can do dp =0 to initialize all elements. So that's fine.\n\nNow testing for the example I thought of earlier:\n\nSample input:\n\n5 \u2192 n, then the numbers 3 1 4 2 5.\n\nThe code would set dp(3)=0, dp(1)=1, dp(4)=2, dp(2)=3, dp(5)=4.\n\nThe next loop from i=2:\n\nFirst i=2:\n\ndp[2] =3 (from the third element's index (i=3)\n\ndp[1] =1.\n\n3 -1 \u21922, add 2.\n\ni=3 (the loops goes up to n=5):\n\ndp(3)=0 (since the first element was 3 at index 0). dp(3) and dp(2)=3's difference: 0 -3 \u2192-3 \u2192abs is 3 \u2192 now ans 5.\n\ni=4: dp(4)=2 (from index=2), dp(3)=0 \u2192 2-0 \u21922 \u2192 ans =5+2=7.\n\nWait, wait for i=4:\n\nThe term is dp(4) - dp(3): 2 - 0 \u21922 \u2192 adding to 5 \u2192 7.\n\nThen i=5 \u2192 dp(5)=4 (index 4) and dp(4)=2. difference is 2, so adding 2 gives 9. So the total is 9. Correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- The first read of n must read it as integer. All the variables declared are integers.\n\n- The array dimension is from 0 to 200000. So if in any case, an x in the input exceeds 200000, dp(x) would be out of bounds. However, assuming the problem constraints ensure that all input values are within 0 to 200000, as the array in Java is that.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem's input values are between 1 and n, and n is up to 2e5, then the array is large enough.\n\nAnother point: In Fortran, when you read data from the standard input, sometimes it may require reading all values in a line, but in code, each read is an individual read. So if the inputs are provided as space-separated integers:\n\nFirst, the first number is n, then the next line (if inputted in one line) may contain the rest. Wait in Java, the Scanner reads them all in one line.\n\nBut in standard programming competition scenarios, the input for such programs is often all given in one line. So in the Read *, x statement, after reading the first n, the subsequent read statements must read the next numbers, one by one. Because in a DO loop that reads n times, each read( *,x ) will read the next value in the input. So I think the code is okay.\n\nAnother thing: when using, in the loop for i=0 to n-1, we must make sure that the loop runs exactly n times. Since Fortran's DO loops are inclusive, yes.\n\nSo, considering that the code should be correct.\n\nWait, another possible discrepancy: in the Java code's first loop, the i runs from 0 to n-1, which is correct, and in each iteration, the current x is read. So the code in Fortran does that with the i from 0 to n-1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Fortran code properly.\n\nAdding the needed declarations, the full code would be:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces612B\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: n, x, ans, i\n  INTEGER, DIMENSION(0:200000) :: dp\n\n  READ(*,*) n\n\n  dp = 0 \n\n  DO i = 0, n-1\n    READ(*,*) x\n    dp(x) = i\n  END DO\n\n  ans = 0\n  DO i = 2, n\n    ans = ans + ABS( dp(i) - dp(i-1) )\n  END DO\n\n  WRITE(*,*) ans\nEND PROGRAM codeforces612B\n\nWait, but in Fortran, I can also use implied do loops, but in this case, the code is straightforward.\n\nIn summary, this should be the correct translation.\n\nWait check for possible errors. For example:\n\nIn the loop DO i =2, n: when n=1, this loop is not executed. But according to the problem, probably n is at least 2, but the code is okay.\n\nAnother possible issue is if some values in the input are not present. For example, suppose the array contains a value that's not between 1 and n, but the problem likely ensures that.\n\nAlternatively, in the fortran code, if a number is not present, like in the sequence, then dp(x) would remain zero. Let me see.\n\nSuppose n is 3, and the input array is [1,3,3].\n\nThen, the dp array for 1 will be set to 0, dp[3] =2.\n\nOther values (like 2), their dp(x) is still 0. \n\nthe loop for i from 2 to 3:\n\ni=2:\n\ndp(2) is 0, so subtract dp(1)=0 \u21920? Wait no, dp[2] is.getIndex is 2's value, which would only be set if 2 appears.\n\nWait in that example:\n\nx values are 1, 3, 3. The input is three numbers.\n\nThe dp(x):\n\nfor the first input x=1 \u2192 set dp(1) =0 (index i=0).\n\nsecond x=3 \u2192 dp(3) =1 (i=1).\n\nthird x=3 \u2192 dp(3) =2 (i=2).\n\nThus, dp(1)=0, dp(3)=2, and anything else is 0.\n\nThen, the loop for i=2 to 3.\n\ni=2: dp[2] is 0, dp[1]=0 \u2192 difference 0 \u2192 total 0.\n\ni=3: dp(3) - dp(2)= 2 -0 \u21922 \u2192 so total is 2.\n\nSo the ans is 2. But the correct answer? Wait in this case, the input is the array [1,3,3].\n\nWait the problem's problem is likely like this: The array a has elements, then compute the total of |pos_i - pos_{i-1}| for each i from 2 to n, where pos_i is the position (index starting from 0 or 1) of the element i in the array.\n\nSo the problem probably expects to compute the sum for each i from 2 to n the absolute difference between the index where i appears and the index where i-1 appears in the array. \n\nSo if the input array is [1,3,3], then:\n\npos_1 =0 (the position of 1 is index 0), pos_2 is not present, so maybe it's considered as the last occurrence? No, in this case the input has no 2, so what is stored in dp[2]? It remains 0.\n\nThus, the code would use dp(2) which was initialized to zero, so pos of 2 is 0. Wait but in the array there is no 2. \n\nWait the problem must have constraints that the array contains all integers from 1 to n exactly? Because otherwise, the difference would be wrong.\n\nAssuming that the input sequence is a permutation of 1..n, then every number from 1 to n is present once, so all dp[i] (for i from 1 to n) will be assigned the index where they appear, so no problem.\n\nAssuming in the problem's constraints, that the input is a permutation of 1..n, then the code is okay.\n\nSo the Fortran code above is correct under that assumption."
