I set it as \"=0\". However in Fortran, the dimension(0:255) tmap = 0 would zero all elements, but does this initialization work inside the array declaration? Yes, in Fortran, you can set the initial values with array declarations: \n\ninteger, dimension (0:255) :: tmap = 0\n\n would initialize all elements to zero. Thus that is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does step by step. \n\nThe Java program reads two strings, s and t. It then processes them to compute two values, ura and opa. The main steps are:\n\nFirst, it counts the frequency of each character in t using a HashMap (tmap). Then, it goes through each character in s. For each character, if it exists in tmap, it decrements the count and marks that character in s as '\u042f' (a Cyrillic character), incrementing ura. \n\nAfter that, it processes s again, checking for the reversed case (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa) of each character. If that reversed character is present in tmap, it uses one count from tmap and increments opa. \n\nFinally, it prints ura and opa. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about each part:\n\n1. Reading input: In Fortran, we can use the `read` statement. However, in Java, Scanner is used, but Fortran's standard input is straightforward. The first input is the string s and the second is t. Since Fortran strings have fixed length unless using the new 2003 features with allocatable strings, but I'll assume we can handle it with character arrays or variables.\n\nWait, but in Java, the code takes two inputs: s is taken via next(), which is the next token. Same for t. So both are separate. In Fortran, using list-directed input, the user can just two strings separated by space. \n\n2. The tmap can be a hash map, but Fortran doesn't have a built-in HashMap like Java. Instead, I think we can use arrays or a dictionary-like structure. Since the characters can be any, but since it's processing the characters of two strings, maybe we can handle the frequency counts with a hash map. Alternatively, since the characters are possibly both cases and the reverse function toggles case, maybe we can use an array indexed by ASCII codes.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps we can use a derived type with some key-value structure, but Fortran before 2008 doesn't have associative arrays, so we need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use an array where index is the ASCII value of each character, so each character's count can be stored in an array of integers with a size of 256 (for ASCII). Since the number of possible characters is known (like small), especially considering reverse involves toggling cases. For Cyrillic characters (like '\u042f'), the Unicode might be different but since the question's code example uses '\u042f' which is in the Windows-1251 encoding, but I'm not sure if Fortran will handle that correctly. \n\nBut let me think, the characters are ASCII? Well in Java, the code uses '\u042f', which is Unicode U+042F. So perhaps in Fortran, the support depends on the compiler and its handling of UTF-8 or other encodings. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's better to assume that all characters are encoded in such a way that their ASCII or code points can be handled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the underlying character codes. So using an array of 256 entries (for ASCII) as frequency counters for t's characters. Since in the code, the '\u042f' is set to s's character, so s is converted, but perhaps '\u042f's ASCII code is treated as a normal value.\n\nAlternatively, this approach might work.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize an array, say, tmap, of size 256 (for all ASCII characters). Initialize all to 0. Then, for each character in t, increment the count in tmap at that character's ASCII code.\n\nWait, but in Java's code, the code is case-insensitive? The reverse function swaps cases. So 'a' becomes 'A', which is different in ASCII (code 97 vs 65). So, the tmap counts characters exactly as they are, but then in the second loop, the code checks for a reversed case character in tmap. Hmm.\n\nWait the first loop in the Java code is scanning s's characters. For each such ch in s, check if it exists in tmap (i.e., exists in the t's original character as per case). If so, use the count. So the first loop is using the literal characters as is. The second loop checks the reversed case (so like, if the character was 'a', reversed becomes 'A', so you look in tmap for 'A's count. Wait but in the second loop, after first loop, some counts may have been used, so perhaps the logic is:\n\nFirst pass: Process s characters as is. If ch is present in tmap (count >0), then take one away, increment ura, and set s's character to '\u042f', which probably removes it from further processing? Wait then in the second loop, the same s's characters that were '\u042f' would be ignored if reverse('\u042f') is still in tmap? Maybe the '\u042f' is just a placeholder but since it's not in tmap, so the second pass can process other chars in s except those turned to '\u042f's?\n\nHmm, also in the second loop, the 's' array (but in Fortran we can have a character string that can be modified).\n\nWait but the code in Java is using a StringBuilder, so characters can be modified. \n\nThus in Fortran, I need a way to modify the characters of s. \n\nSo steps to plan the Fortran translation:\n\nRead s and t as strings input. Wait, in Fortran:\n\nWe can have something like:\n\ncharacter(len=200), dimension(2) :: input_strings\nread(*,*) input_strings(1), input_strings(2)\n\nBut no, perhaps better:\n\nread(*, '(A)') s, t\n\nWait, but that's list-directed. Alternatively, using a GET command.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nREAD(*, *) s, t\n\nBut in Fortran, the strings need to be of sufficient length. Let me note that the problem might have some constraints (in the original problem? perhaps from codeforces problem 518 B? looking up maybe the problem 518B of codeforces to see the constraints.\n\nThe problem 518B's title is \"Graveyard and Crab\" (the code given is for this problem). The problem requires processing two strings, s and t, where each character in t must be matched, either by an exact match from s or its case inverse, and \"\u042f\" probably means matches any character when it's marked as such?\n\nHmm, but perhaps in the problem statement's requirements, but perhaps the code's logic must be followed.\n\nBack to Fortran's translation steps:\n\nFirst: Read s and t. Let me first handle variables:\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nBut Fortran 2003 has allocatable strings, which is probably the way to go here. Alternatively, we can use a fixed size. Let's use allocatable.\n\nSo code structure would be something like:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_518_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n    integer :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n    integer, dimension(256) :: tmap = 0\n    ! read inputs\n    read(*, '(A)') s\n    ! Wait, but need both s and t. The above would read the entire line, but maybe better to split into variables.\n\nWait, in list-directed input, if you have two strings separated by space, you can read with:\n\nread *, s, t\n\nBut then s and t have to be variables with sufficient length.\n\nAlternatively, as in the Java code, s is first taken with next() and then t. In Fortran, using the cooperate_len method:\n\nPROGRAM ...\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    character(len=1000) :: s_in, t_in\n    character(len=1000) :: s, t\n    integer :: slen, tlen\n    slen = len_trim(s_in)\n    s = s_in\n\nWait maybe better:\n\nUsing allocatable strings:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\nBut reading input:\n\nREAD *, s, t\n\nBut that requires that the inputs are in one line, with s and t as the two arguments. So it might work as per Java's input.\n\nBut in Fortran 90+ with allocatable, perhaps we can read as:\n\nREAD(*,'(A)') s\nREAD(*,'(A)') t\n\nSo first read s as the first line, then t as the second line? Or if both are on the same line, with space. The list-directed read would handle as per standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the `get` command?\n\nAlternatively, the code can be structured to read as per line.\n\nAnyway, assuming that we can read them correctly into two strings.\n\nNow, processing:\n\nFirst, compute tmap: an array of 256 elements (for each ASCII character), initialized to zero. For each character in t, we increment the count in tmap at the ASCII code of that character. For that, in Fortran:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: tmap = 0\n\nBut to get the ASCII code, we can use ichar function.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger :: ic, i\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(t)\n   ic = ichar( t(i:i) )\n   tmap( ic ) = tmap( ic ) +1\nend do\n\nWait but note that some systems use 8-bit ASCII, but codes go up to 255, so 0-255.\n\nOk.\n\nThen, the first loop over s:\n\nloop over each character in s (original length), which is up to the original length (since we aren't modifying the length, but switching characters to '\u042f' (maybe with a higher code))\n\nWait in the Java code, the s is a string built with a StringBuilder, of initial length = s input. So in Fortran, the character string s must be mutable. But in Fortran strings are modifiable.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < length; i++)\n\nwhere length is the original length of s (stored in length = s.length() before modifications). The s in Java is a StringBuilder, so characters can be set, but in the loop, the length remains the same as it's fixed (since we only set characters, not adding/removing?). \n\nWait the Java code does s.setCharAt(i, '\u042f'), which replaces the character at position i. The length remains same. \n\nIn Fortran, the code has s as a character string of fixed length (or allocatable but with fixed size). So, in our code, after reading the input s (with s_in), we can have a character array or treat s as an array where each character can be modified.\n\nWait in Fortran, characters are stored as arrays. So, to modify individual characters, like s(i:i) = '\u042f'.\n\nSo, proceeding, the steps:\n\nFirst read s and t. \n\nLength of s is slen = len_trim(s). \n\nLoop for the original length of s, which should be stored in a variable first.\n\nWait, in the original Java code: \n\nint length = s.length(); // which is length before any modifications.\n\nThen, for i from 0 to length-1, \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: slen\n\nslen = len_trim(s)\n\nthen, loop from i=1 to slen: (since in Fortran, indices start at 1)\n\n! initialization of tmap as above.\n\nThen first loop:\n\ndo i = 1, slen\n\n   char_current = s(i:i)\n\n   ich = ichar( char_current )\n\n   current_count = tmap(ich) \n\n   if (current_count ==0) continue\n\n   ura = ura +1 \n\n   ! decrement tmap's count.\n\n   tmap(ich) = tmap(ich) -1 \n\n   ! replace the current character with '\u042f'\n\n   s(i:i) = '\u042f' \n\nend do\n\nWait but then, the next loop is the second part, processing the reversed case letters.\n\nThe second loop is:\n\nfor each i from 1 to slen:\n\n   char_current = s(i:i) \n\n   ! but before, in the first loop, some characters might be already set to '\u042f'; so we have to check.\n\nBut in the second loop, the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int i =0;i < length; i++) {\n\n   char ch = s.charAt(i);\n\n   char rch = reverse(ch);\n\n   Integer num = tmap.get(rch);\n\n   if (num == null) continue;\n\n   ...\n\n}\n\nWait here, the 's' here includes the already replaced characters (set to '\u042f'), so when you do reverse(ch) when ch is '\u042f', you reverse the case (assuming '\u042f' is uppercase, then reversed would be lowercase? Wait '\u042f' in Cyrillic is uppercase. Its lowercase is '\u044f', with code point U+0439.\n\nSo the reverse function converts between lower and upper case.\n\nIn fortran, writing a function to reverse the case:\n\nFUNCTION reverse_char(ch) result (rch)\n\n   character, intent(in) :: ch\n\n   character :: rch\n\n   if ( ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z' ) then \n\n       rch = char(ichar(ch) - 97 + 65)\n\n       ! To uppercase: like a(97) -> A(65), etc.\n\n      ! Or simply achar(iachar(ch)-32)\n\n   else if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then \n\n        rch = char(ichar(ch) + 32 )\n\n   else\n\n       rch = ch\n\n   end if\n\nEND FUNCTION reverse_char\n\nWait there's a problem: the 'reverse' function here only works for English alphabet, not Cyrillic letters. But the problem might only involve English letters according to the problem's original constraints?\n\nLooking back to the problem of Codeforces 518B, the problem says the strings consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, or maybe includes Cyrillic? The code given here uses '\u042f', but perhaps in that problem, when a character is processed with opposite case, and '\u042f's are just part of s after processing.\n\nAlternatively, this code might be translated as follows regardless, but the reverse function would be handled only for the ASCII letters, assuming that reverse only applies to ASCII characters.\n\nSo that function above is for case reversal of English letters.\n\nTherefore in the second loop:\n\nloop over each character again (the original s's length):\n\nfor each character in s (each position 1-slen):\n\n   current_char = s(i:i)\n\n   ! but since in first loop, some have been turned to '\u042f', but that's fine.\n\n   rch = reverse_char( current_char )\n\n   ! get its reversed case version\n\n   id = ichar(rch)\n\n   current_count = tmap( id )\n\n   if ( current_count ==0 ) then \n\n      continue \n\n   else\n\n      ! take one away\n\n      tmap( id ) = tmap(id) -1 \n\n      opa = opa +1 \n\n   end if \n\nend loop.\n\nWait also, the code in Java does:\n\nin the second loop:\n\n    if (num == null) continue\n\nIn fortran's case, since tmap(id) might have been 0. Wait in the initial processing, when the first loop reduces counts, the second loop can take from any remaining counts in tmap. So the logic is:\n\nif the rch's count is at least one, then it's possible. \n\nThus, in the second loop, each time we check if tmap(ich2) >0, then proceed. \n\nWait but in the Java code's second loop: \n\nInteger num = tmap.get(rch); \n\nif (num == null) then the count is zero. \n\nSimilarly, in the array in fortran, tmap(id)=0 means there's nothing. So yes, checking if tmap(id) >0. \n\nWait but there's also the case where the count was zero, but not present in the map? Wait in Java's code's first loop:\n\nif in num (for current ch):\n\nif the count for ch was 1, then after decrementing (now 0), it removes it from the map. \n\nAh! So in the Java code, when the count reaches zero, it removes the key from the map, so that if you try to get it again, you get null. \n\nIn our fortran implementation, we're using an array, which never removes entries. \n\nHmm, this is a difference here. Because the Java code uses the counts to mirror the map's keys. So when the count for a key drops to zero, they remove it from the map. Thus, to mimic that, we need to have for any id where tmap(id) was zero, it would not be present in the \"map\".\n\nThus, in our array approach, the tmap(id) can be zero, but we can check whether tmap(id) is >0 before proceeding. So in the second loop:\n\nIn the Java code's second loop, a num (count) can be null (meaning key not present, which corresponds to zero in the array). \n\nTherefore in Fortran's approach, simulating \"removing\" a key by just letting its count go to zero, we can proceed with checking if the count is positive. \n\nThus, the fortran code can proceed as above. Thus:\n\nThe first loop:\n\nfor each i from 1 to original length (slen):\n\n   current character is s(i)\n\n   get the ASCII code (ich)\n\n   if (tmap(ich) ==0) continue\n\n   take one, so:\n\n   tmap(ich) = tmap(ich) -1 \n\n   ura +=1 \n\n   mark the character as '\u042f'\n\nSecond loop for opa: \n\nfor each i from 1 to slen: \n\n  current_char = s(i)\n\n  rch = reverse_char(current_char)\n\n  ich Rev is ichar(rch)\n\n  if (tmap(ich_rev) ==0) continue \n\n  ! take one, increment opa:\n\n  tmap(ich_rev) = tmap(ich_rev) -1 \n\n  opa +=1 \n\nWait, but in the first pass, when we process a character, we just removed from tmap(ich). So for that ch's count. \n\nWait also in Java's code, in the first loop, after the count in the map decreases, if it reaches zero, the key is removed. So the count can't be minus one. But in our array approach, the count can go down as long as there's a positive count. \n\nWait in Java's code: \n\nfor each character in s (original s), when the current character's count in the tmap is present (not null?), then take one down and if it was 1, then remove from the map else keep.\n\nSo the code: \n\nif (inum ==1) then remove from tmap, else put count-1. \n\nThe array approach just subtracts 1, and doesn't track whether it's zero. But perhaps that is okay because if it reaches zero, future accesses to it would find zero, so won't be used again. \n\nSo the key difference is:\n\nFor Java, once the count reaches zero, any further attempts to take from that key will fail (because it's removed), so that the letter can't be used in the second loop for that key. \n\nWhereas in the array approach, if a count for ch had been zeroed out (but not removed), then in the second loop, if you attempt to get the rev case of it, but only if it wasn't the same letter.\n\nWait, maybe the approach in the fortran code works correctly in the same way as the Java code.\n\nWait let's suppose in the Java code, for a character ch, the first loop uses it until the tmap count is exhausted. \n\nIn first loop:\n\nfor each character in the original s:\n\n   if the count for the char is present (so count_at_least_1), then:\n\n      count -=1. \n\n      if count was 1 (after decrementing it was 0, then removed.\n\nWait no, in Java code:\n\nThe code is:\n\nif (inum == 1) then remove from map else put the new count.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nif (inum ==1) tmap.remove(ch);\n\n else tmap.put(ch, inum -1);\n\nSo, after the operation, if the count was one and is now zero, the key is removed\n\nelse it's decremented.\n\nThus, moving forward, the entries in the map have minimum count 1, except after decremented.\n\nBut when doing this in the first loop, for example, if the count for a char was 3, after subtracting 1, it's 2, so it's kept in the map. \n\nBut if the count was 1, then it's removed.\n\nSo the remaining counts in the map always have counts >=1.\n\nWhereas, in the array approach, once it reaches zero, it stays at zero, so further accesses would respond properly. \n\nThe second loop code in Java does:\n\nsecond loop: for each character in s's original length (the initial length, so even after the '\u0447' are set as '\u042f's, but in s's indices are the same)\n\nThen, we get each character (which may now be '\u042f' or whatever), reverse its case, and see if the reversed character is present in the tmap.\n\nSo in the Java code, after the first loop, the tmap contains characters where their counts are >=1 except those reduced to zero and removed.\n\nTherefore, when looking up in the second loop, the 'r' character's key (rc) must be present in the map for the code to proceed.\n\nIn the array approach, for that reversed key, we check if the array's count is >=1.\n\nThus, the array-based approach would behave the same as Java's code, since the array counts are stepping down normally.\n\nWait but in Java, when a count reaches zero in first loop's prior steps, it is already removed from the map, so in the second loop, if you looked for that same character (but reversed case), the count would be in the map or not?\n\nSuppose for example, in the first loop, 'A' was in the map with a count of 1:\n\nThen, in some iteration, the code takes 'A' from s (so uses it):\n\neither the current character is 'A', then its count would go down to 0, removing it from tmap. \n\nThen, in the second loop, if a character comes along that reversed gives us 'a', but if 'A' was completely removed (count now zero), then when looking for 'a' in the tmap (assuming case-sensitive), \n\nthe 'a' may have their own entry. \n\nHmm, but the problem requires that the code works as in Java, but the array approach may have a discrepancy here.\n\nWait: suppose the Java code leaves some keys in the map that have count 0 and therefore not present.\n\nWait wait: in the first loop:\n\nSuppose for a character ch in s that matches a key in tmap with count 5.\n\nWe decrement once (count to 4). Keep it in the map. \n\nThus, in subsequent steps, it remains in the map.\n\nAnother character in s with the same ch (before replacement to \u042f?) \n\nWe take another decrement until count reaches 1.\n\nThen, in that step: decremented again to 0, and removed from the map. \n\nSo after that, the key is no longer present, so any further takes would not use it. \n\nIn the array approach, the count goes down to 0, but remains in the array as a key. \n\nbut in the second loop, when looking for that key (or another case variation), we check if the count is positive. \n\nTherefore, in the array approach, even after a count is zero, it's treated as not present, so same behavior as Java. \n\nThus the array approach correctly models the Java's hashmap in this scenario.\n\nThus, proceeding with the array-based implementation is acceptable. \n\nNow, back to writing the code.\n\nFirst: the tmap array must be declared. \n\nIn Fortran, array indices are 1-based by default, but here the ASCII codes go from 0 to 255, but as Fortran arrays start at 1, perhaps better to dimension the array from 0:255.\n\nWait Fortran allows array bounds like dimension array(0:255), so the declaration should be:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:255) :: tmap\n\nand we can initialize all elements to zero initially. \n\nSo:\n\ntmap = 0\n\nThen, loop over each character in t:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(t_in)\n\n   char_t = t(i:i)\n\n   ic = ichar(char_t)\n\n   tmap( ic ) = tmap( ic ) +1\n\nend do\n\nWait, assuming t is the input string from before.\n\nThen the first loop over s's characters:\n\noriginal_s is the input s (maybe stored in variable s)\n\ndeclare s as character(len=*) pointer?\n\nWait code steps:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_518_B\n\n   IMPLICIT NONE\n\n   character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\n   integer :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n\n   integer, dimension(0:255) :: tmap\n\n   integer :: i, slen, tlen, ic\n\n   character :: ch, rch\n\n   tmap = 0 ! initialize tmap all to zero\n\n   !

What's the ASCII code for '\u042f'?\n\n      Wait a second! The ASCII code for '\u042f' is not standard. \n\n      Wait '\u042f' is a Cyrillic character, which is ASCII 208, 159? Or in Unicode? \n\n      Maybe I need to check.\n\n      Actually, in Windows-1251 encoding, '\u042f' (uppercase) is coded as 0xDA (235 in hex)\n\n      But in UTF-8 or other encodings, this might vary. However, in Fortran, the ' character literal might depend on the current encoding and compiler.\n\n      Wait, but the Java code is using '\u042f', which is Unicode code point U+042F.\n\n      The problem is that Fortran source files might write this character differently. However, to replicate the code exactly, the replacement character must be the same, but in Fortran code how can we write '\u042f'? \n\n      If the character code is 1103 decimal (Assuming code page?), perhaps in some systems:\n\n      Possibly, in some encodings the code for '\u042f' is 1072? No, 1072 is the ASCII code for lowercase in some extended code pages?\n\n      Wait, this might be a problem. To write the character \u042f in Fortran source code. The escaped version might be necessary, or we can number it via ichar. \n\n      The problem is that '\u042f' is a Unicode character. So in Fortran, perhaps we can find its ASCII value, but in any case, in the Java code it's set as '\u0414'. \n\n      Alternatively maybe the code in the first loop replaces the character with a unique sentinel, so in Fortran we can use a different character, or we can use the ASCII code for '\u042f'. \n\n      Since the problem is a translation of code, perhaps we should use the same character code as Java uses for '\u042f', but how?\n\n      Let's see the code: The java code does:\n\n      s.setCharAt(i, '\u042f');\n\n      which sets the character to '\u042f', whose ASCII code in Java is 042F, which might be outside the standard ASCII 0-255. Wait, but Java's char is 16 bits, but for codepoints above 127 they are Unicode.\n\n      So when using the fortran ichar function which in Fortran reads the ASCII code, but the '\u042f' might have an 8-bit code in ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic: for example, in ISO-8859-5, '\u042f' is represented as 225 (decimal) or 91 in hex.\n\n       Alternatively, in Windows-1251, it's 229 (0xE5), etc. So perhaps the code is using the char's code as the input assumes the environment is such that this character can be handled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem's context the actual character used to mark the replaced characters is irrelevant except to not let it be processed in future loops, but only if that character is not present in the tmap. \n\nWait in the first loop, after replacing to '\u042f', then in the second loop, when we process the character as that, when reversed, perhaps the code would consider its reversed case of \u042f, which is lowercase \u044f (if \u042f is uppercase), but in that case would fetch the count for lowercase \u044f's ASCII code, but unless the '\u044f's letters are in the original t's letters. \n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the '\u042f's are just to prevent s from processing the same character again, because in the code first loop reduces the t's mapped counts for the particular character. Thus, the replacement character must not have been part of tmap to begin with. \n\nThus the chosen character '\u042f' in the Java code is one that tmap has no entries for. Or at least, no entries because after the first loop any existing counts have been exhausted. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement character must not be part of the tmap (characters present in t). Thus, choosing another character not in T's letters.\n\nTo replicate the exact Java code's behavior, the replacement must be with '\u042f', but in Fortran, perhaps the best way is to use the ichar of '\u042f' correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute which value is '\u042f' in Fortran. Alternatively, perhaps the problem does not need the exact character code, but using the replacement allows that s is modified to avoid reuse, so the replacement can be any non-alphabetic character that won't be part of T's characters. \n\nHmm. Well, for the purposes of coding, we can assume that we can represent '\u042f' in Fortran's source code by using a character literal. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can write the character using its ASCII code with 'achar' function.\n\nSo, the code was:\n\ns.setCharAt(i, '\u042f');\n\nwhich in Java, sets character at position i to the '\u042f' which is known (using the char type). \n\nIn Fortran, to set the string's character, you can do:\n\ns(i:i) = achar(ich)\n\nwhere ich is the code point of '\u042f'. \n\nWe need to find the correct ASCII code.\n\nAlternatively, to resolve this, perhaps we can choose a character that is not present in the original T's characters, such as an ASCII 0 (but might not be good). Alternatively, maybe a different sent character like ' ' (space) but that could interfere if T had space. Alternatively, a character beyond standard display like del character? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of \u201c\u042f\u201d in IBM Code page 866: \u2018\u042f\u2019 is 234 or 235? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the code from the problem's perspective. The problem is Codeforces 518B, let's see what exactly it does. \n\nProblem statement: The problem is \"Graveyard and Crab\". \n\nFrom Codeforces 518B description: \n\n\u201cYou are given two strings s and t consisting of only English lowercase letters. The crab can do the following operations: \n\nFirst, it chooses a subset of characters in s (possibly empty) and replaces each chosen character with its opposite case (lowercase becomes uppercase, uppercase becomes lowercase). \n\nAfter that, you can select a subset of characters from s (possibly, empty set) and remove them. \n\nFinally, the resulting multiset of the characters of s must contain all characters of the string t. \n\nWhat is the minimal possible number of operations (switching and removing)?\n\nWait, perhaps the '\u042f' in Java represents \"removed\" characters, which can be ignored. \n\nWait the Java code's first loop seems to process the s string by first conserving 't's characters as they are (case), replacing used characters to \"\u042f\" so they aren't counted in further processing. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the actual replacement character is irrelevant because even if \u042f is part of the t's characters, but the first loop would have taken those into account. \n\nAlternatively, the '\u042f' character isn't even part of the input's characters (problem says lowercase letters). \n\nTherefore, in the code, setting to '\u042f' (which is uppercase Cyrillic) is just a way to mark those characters so they are not considered in the second pass because their reversed characters (if any) won't be present in the t's counts. \n\nThus, if Fortran uses some non-alphabetic character, like '^', as replacement, it would still work as long as that character's count in 't' is zero. \n\nSo, the replacement character's actual ASCII is less important than ensuring it is not present in t's letters. Therefore, perhaps in Fortran we can set the replacement to be a space or some symbol that's not in t's characters. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement character is irrelevant because after using s to look up in the first pass, we just want to ensure that characters in the second pass are the ones not yet processed. \n\nAlternatively, even better, we don't need to modify the s string, since the first loop's processing only looks at its original characters, but the second loop must exclude those already processed in first step. \n\nHmm, but in the Java code, the processing of first loop modifies the s's characters (to '\u042f'). Then in the second loop, when examining the current character which may be '\u042f' (from first loop), the reverse function would convert \u042f to lowercase, but since that character wasn't part of the original 't' (as per the conditions?), \n\nTherefore, the replacement in the first loop can be any character that won't be processed further. Thus, the choice of replacement character is arbitrary as long as it's not one that's in the t's tmap (since after first loop, any count for that replacement character would have been zero). \n\nTherefore, if I use another character like 'A' (but could interfere with actual letters). Alternatively '!' (ASCII 33).\n\nTherefore, modifying the first loop code:\n\ninstead of '\u042f', the code sets s(i:i) = 'X', a placeholder which is not part of t's characters (since all in t are English letters, perhaps). \n\nSo for simplicity, I'll choose a non-alphabet character like '!'. \n\nThus, in the code, in first loop:\n\ns(i:i) = char(33) ! ASCII code 33 is '!'\n\nthen, in the second loop, when processing those characters, the reverse function will be applied. However, for characters set to '!', the reverse has no effect (since it's not alphabetic), so they just stay as '!', which is not a letter in t's pool. \n\nThus, this might work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is simply not needed because we can track which characters been used by using a temporary array (mask) to record the used indices. \n\nWait in the first loop, perhaps we don't need to modify the s string. Instead, for each character in s's original sequence, first see if it can be used for t, then mark in an array whether we've used it. \n\nBut the second loop can't use those characters. So this approach might be better. \n\nLet's think:\n\nIf we track used characters in a logical array of length slen. \n\nBut in the first loop, for each s(i) character that is available in tmap, then we do:\n\ntake it from tmap, increment ura, and mark it as used. \n\nin the second loop, for each character in s's sequence, if it has been marked as used in first pass, skip it. Otherwise, then take its reversed case char.\n\nThis would be more efficient and avoid having to change the s string's characters.\n\nThis would be a more appropriate Fortran way.\n\nPerhaps this modification is better. Let's outline:\n\nVariables needed:\n\nlogical, dimension(slen) :: used = .false.\n\nIn first loop:\n\nloop over i from 1 to slen:\n\n   if ( used(i) ) cycle\n\n   char_s = s(i:i)\n\n   ic = ichar( char_s )\n\n   if ( tmap( ic ) ==0 ) cycle\n\n   then:\n\n      ura +=1\n\n      tmap( ic ) -=1\n\n      used(i) = .true.\n\nend do\n\nsecond loop:\n\nloop over i from 1 to slen:\n\n   if ( used(i) ) cycle\n\n   char_s = s(i:i)\n\n   rch = reverse_char( char_s )\n\n   ic_r = ichar(rch)\n\n   if ( tmap( ic_r ) ==0 ) cycle\n\n   ! can use this\n\n   opa +=1\n\n   tmap( ic_r ) -=1\n\n   used(i) = .true.\n\nend do\n\nThis approach doesn't modify the string. Maybe better.\n\nThus, the replacement is not necessary; instead, track which characters have been used, so first loop\u2019s characters are marked as used with first method, then the second loop takes other characters.\n\nSo this is a better approach and avoids dealing with non-ASCII characters.\n\nAdditionally, this tracks the used characters without altering s's string, which can help. \n\nThus, the previous code can be adapted with logical array.\n\nThis is cleaner and avoids case issues with '\u042f' which may involve non-English encodings. \n\nThus, I will proceed with this approach.\n\nSo now the revised steps:\n\nRead s and t.\n\nInitialize used array of length len_trim(s)'s length.\n\nFirst loop (ura count and consumed chars) \n\nSecond loop (opa count using potential reversed case, but unprocessed chars)\n\nLet me restructure the code accordingly.\n\nNow the code would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_518_B\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n\n  integer :: ura = 0, opa =0\n\n  integer, dimension(0:255) :: tmap =0\n\n  integer :: slen, i\n\n  logical,allocatable :: used(:)\n\n  character :: ch, rch\n\n  !

For uppercase 'A' becomes 'a', etc.\n\nWait, the function:\n\nif lowercase \u2192 uppercase: R=achar(ichar(ch)-32)\n\nsince difference between 'A'and 'a' is 32 in ASCII (ASCII for 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97).\n\nYes. \n\nTesting this function:\n\nch = 'a' \u2192 r = A (65 = 97-32?)\n\nYes, 97-32=65? 97 minus 32 is 65, which is correct.\n\nch = 'A' \u2192 becomes 'a' (65 +32 = 97).\n\nAh, the else if (uppercase) case sets to lowercase. So reverse case is correct.\n\nOther non-letters pass through.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should work. \n\nTesting possible scenarios: for example\n\nSample input 1\u2019s CodeForces problem 518B:\n\nInput: \n\nSample Input 1:\n\ncbaCab\n\n>acb\n\nWait wait, let's think of a sample example.\n\nSuppose test case where s is \"ab\", t is \"AB\".\n\nThen first loop will process 'a' and 'b' which would consume the lowercases in t's \"AB\" \u2018s uppercase letters. No, t is \"A\" and \"B\" (counts are 1 each). The first loop would not find 'a' (which is lowercase), so in first loop for 'a' (lowercase) in s, tmap would have for 'A' (capital) initial 1, but for lowercase 'a' (ASCII 97?), so the counts would be zero. So first loop would not count them. \n\nWait in the first loop, for each char in s (a and b lowers), their codes are 97,98. T is \"AB\" whose codes are 65, 66, so the counts for positions 97 and 98 are zero. Hence, first loop does nothing (ura remains 0). \n\nSecond loop considers: each character in s (a, b, not marked used), then reverse a \u2192 A (code 65). Is tmap(65) =1. So take one, so opa increments by 1 (A become 0). Then for 'b', reverse to B (code 66). So TMAP(66) is 1 \u2192 subtract resulting in 0. opa becomes 2. \n\nThus total is ura=0, opa=2. \n\nWhich may be the correct way as per problem.\n\nThus code should handle.\n\nAnother sample.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, going back to the original code's functions.\n\nAnother possible edge case: letters already in both cases.\n\nLike s = \"A\", t = \"a\". \n\nFirst loop: for char 'A', it is capital. T's a is lowercase (code 97). Thus Tmap for code 65 is zero, and code 97 is 1. \n\nFirst loop can take 'A'? No, because it requires its code (65) with count in tmap. \n\nThus first loop\u2019s 'A' would see tmap(65) as zero (since 'a's count is in 97). Hence first loop can\u2019t use it. \n\nThen in the second loop, char 'A' is not used yet. Its reversed case is 'a' (code 97), which has count 1. \n\nThus opa will be 1. \n\nWhich is correct since reversing cases and then kept.\n\nThus the code works here.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother quirk: the tmap should be initialized to 0 and then counts are only increased via characters from t.\n\nAlso\uff0c note that in Fortran, the 'achar' and 'ichar' functions assume the default encoding, but for ASCII characters this should be ok.\n\nThus the fortran translation would be this program.\n\nNow, writing the full code:\n\nWait:\n\nFunction reverse_char must be defined in a module or CONTAINS within the program?\n\nYes, in the code above, I put it inside the program via a CONTAINS.\n\nYes, in modern Fortran, you can have internal procedures via CONTAINS.\n\nThus the program is as outlined.\n\nThus the final Fortran code is as written.\n\nNow, let me write it properly formated.\n\nThe final code would be:\n\nAlso, need to consider that when you read the strings, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, so len_trim is used.\n\nAnother point: in the read statements, we use '(A)' to read until end of line, or use list-directed.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nread(*, *) s\n\nread(*, *) t\n\nBut if s is read with )dataGridView1.Rows.Add(cost, (;;)\uff0c might have issues. Perhaps using the buffered reads with '(a)'\n\nBut in the code:\n\nUsing read(*,'(A)') is list directed but with format for single string.\n\nAlternatively, the code uses 'allocated strings with read' to read the whole line.\n\nAlternatively, just do:\n\nRead(*,'(a)') s\n\nread(*,*) t\n\nWait no, better:\n\nTo read s as an unlimited length character (if using Fortran 2003 features):\n\ncharacter(len=:),allocatable :: s, t\n\nread(*,*) s\n\nread(*,*) t\n\nBut list-directed reading for character strings will read until blank or until EOL.\n\nBut the two inputs are two tokens, so if entered on same line, first \"input_strings\" should be read (s), then next word is t.\n\nThus using the standard read(*,*) will do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nBut also, the strings s and t must be long enough.\n\nHowever, variable length allocatable strings can be handled using the read - standard Fortran 2003 (when available).\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nTherefore the full code:\n\nHere is the translated Fortran code:\n\nThe above program block.\n\nNow, I think this is correct. But note that in Fortran, strings indices are 1-based.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nThe full code in Fortran would look like:\n\nprogram codeforces_518_B\n    implicit none\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: s, t\n    integer :: ura = 0, opa = 0\n    integer, dimension(0:255) :: tmap = 0\n    integer :: slen, tlen, i\n    logical, allocatable :: used(:)\n    character :: ch, rch\n\n    ! Read the input lines\n    read(*, '(A)') s\n    read(*, '(A)') t\n\n    slen = len_trim(s)\n    tlen = len_trim(t)\n\n    ! Allocate the used array\n    allocate( used(1:slen) )\n    used = .false.\n\n    ! Initialize tmap based on 't' string\n    do i = 1, tlen\n        ch = t(i:i)\n        tmap(ichar(ch)) = tmap(ichar(ch)) + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! First loop to count ura\n    do i = 1, slen\n        if (used(i)) cycle\n        ch = s(i:i)\n        if (tmap(ichar(ch)) > 0) then\n            ura = ura + 1\n            tmap(ichar(ch)) = tmap(ichar(ch)) - 1\n            used(i) = .true.\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Second loop to count opa\n    do i = 1, slen\n        if (used(i)) cycle\n        ch = s(i:i)\n        rch = reverse_char(ch)\n        if (tmap(ichar(rch)) > 0) then\n            opa = opa + 1\n            tmap(ichar(rch)) = tmap(ichar(rch)) - 1\n            used(i) = .true.\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    print *, ura, opa\n\ncontains\n\n    function reverse_char(ch) result(r)\n        character, intent(in) :: ch\n        character :: r\n        if (ch >= 'a' .and. ch <= 'z') then\n            r = achar(ichar(ch) - 32)\n        else if (ch >= 'A' .and. ch <= 'Z') then\n            r = achar(ichar(ch) + 32)\n        else\n            r = ch\n        end if\n    end function reverse_char\n\nend program codeforces_518_B\n\nWait, checking the initialization of tmap. I set it as \"=0\". However in Fortran, the dimension(0:255) tmap = 0 would zero all elements, but does this initialization work inside the array declaration?\n\nYes, in Fortran, you can set the initial values with array declarations: \n\ninteger, dimension (0:255) :: tmap = 0\n\n would initialize all elements to zero.\n\nThus that is correct.\n\nAlso, in first loop's condition:\n\nif (tmap(ichar(ch)) > 0) then \n\nso decrements only if it exists.\n\nIn the second loop, when we call reverse_char, passing the current s character (which hasn't been used yet), then calculate its reversed case, check its count.\n\nThus the logic matches Java's original process.\n\nTherefore this should be the correct translation."
