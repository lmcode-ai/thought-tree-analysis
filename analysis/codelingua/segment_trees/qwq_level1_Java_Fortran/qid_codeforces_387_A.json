Then minus 15 minutes \u2192 22:45. So the result would be 22:45. So the result is effectively x minus ( y's duration ) So to mimic that, in Fortran, the calculation is total = xh*60 + xm - yh*60 - ym,\n\nthen:\n\ntotal = total_minutes,\n\nand then, we need to compute hours and minutes as (total /60 ) and (total mod 60), but when mod is negative, adjust as follows: Wait but actually, total can be any integer, negative or not. We can compute hours as total /60, and minutes as modulo(total,60) \u2192 because this way, for total = -30,\n\nmodulo gives +30,\n\nso hours would be (total - 30)/60 \u2192 ( -60)/60 \u2192 -1 \u2192 thus, -1 hours and 30 minutes.

Ah! Because the result is a time, not a duration, so we must keep it in a valid time (0 <= total <1440). Wait so if the difference is -30 minutes (total= -30), we can add 1440 to get 1410, which corresponds to (1410/60)=23, remainder 30 minutes \u2192 23:30 \u2192 but that's adding a full day's worth of minutes. Wait, -30 mod 1440 is 1410. Wait that would actually give 1410 minutes \u2192 23h30 \u2192 but the example before with total -75 (minutes):\n\n-75 mod 1440 \u2192 1440-75= 1365 \u2192 22h45 which is correct. Ah! So the problem in the code's original calculation is that it's treating the first time as is, and then subtracting y's duration, but the result must be wrapped modulo 1440 so it stays in 0-1440.",

Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nnew_m = modulo( total, 60 )\n\nnew_m is between 0 -59. Then new_h = (total - new_m)/60. Wait that could work. Example total is -30:\n\nnew_m = modulo( -30,60 ) =30,\n\nthen new_h = (-30 -30)/60 = -60 /60 = -1 \u2192 so new_h is -1, new_m is 30. So time would be -1 hour and 30 minutes?",

That is not a proper time. Ah, this is the problem. So Java's LocalTime can handle negative hours in the subtraction? Wait: Using the example above, 1:00 (which is 60 minutes) minus 2 hours and 15 minutes (135 minutes) \u2192 60-135= -75 minutes \u2192 which is -1 hour 15 minutes. But in Java's code, 1:00 minus 2 hours \u2192 ( -1 hour ) \u2192 but LocalTime handles that as a time on the previous day \u2192 so the time would be 23:00 (assuming midnight is 00:00 \u2192 minus 2 hours from 1:00 is 23:00). Wait that's only 59 minutes? Wait let me step back. LocalTime x = LocalTime.of(1,0); \u2192 t is 01:00. y = LocalTime.of(2, 15) \u2192 02:15.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. The Java code reads two times in HH:MM format, converts them into LocalTime objects, then subtracts the hours and minutes of the second time from the first, and prints the result.\n\nFirst, I'll have to think about how to handle input in Fortran. In Java, they used a Scanner, so in Fortran, I probably need to read from the standard input. The times are entered as strings separated by colons. So maybe read two strings, split them into hours and minutes.\n\nWait, but Fortran's string handling isn't as straightforward as Java. Oh right. Maybe read each time as a string, then parse the hours and minutes by splitting on the colon. Let's see.\n\nThe first part: reading the input. The Java code uses sc.next() twice, so probably two inputs separated by spaces? Or maybe the times are given as two separate tokens. Like, if the user inputs \"12:34 15:45\", then the first next() gets \"12:34\" and the second next() gets \"15:45\".\n\nSo in Fortran, I need to read two strings, each representing the time. Let's declare two character variables, say s and t, each maybe 5 characters long (since HH:MM is 5 chars including the colon). Wait, maybe up to 6? But probably 5. Or better to make them long enough. For example, characters(len=8). Hmm.\n\nOnce I have s and t, I need to split them into hours and minutes. In Java they split on \":\", so in Fortran, I can use index to find the colon position, then substring. For example, for s, find the colon at position col, then hours = s(1:col-1), minutes = s(col+1:).\n\nWait, in Fortran, string indices start at 1. So if s is '12:34', the colon is at position 3. So s(1:2) is '12', s(4:5) is '34'.\n\nThen convert those substrings to integers. So using internal reads or the appropriate conversion functions.\n\nOnce I have the hours and minutes for both times x and y (in Java variables x and y are LocalTime objects), then the code subtracts the hours and minutes of y from x. Wait, in the Java code: x.minusHours(y.getHour()).minusMinutes(y.getMinute()). Wait, that's not exactly the same as subtracting both hour and minute parts. Because that would subtract y's hours and then y's minutes from x, which is equivalent to x minus (y's hours + y's minutes) as time?\n\nWait, actually, in Java's LocalTime, minusHours takes an integer and subtracts that number of hours. Similarly minusMinutes subtracts minutes. So the total subtraction would be (y.getHour() * 60 + y.getMinute()) minutes subtracted from x? Or rather, the time x minus the duration of y's time. Wait, but LocalTime represents a time of day, not a duration. Hmm, maybe the Java code is subtracting y's hours and minutes from x.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose x is 12:30, y is 2:45. Then x minusHours(2) gives 10:30, then minusMinutes(45) gives 09:45? But if you consider that the total is 12:30 minus 2 hours and 45 minutes, then that would be correct. So overall, the result is x minus (y's duration). The program is taking the first time and subtracting the hours and minutes of the second time, effectively treating the second time as a duration. Interesting.\n\nSo in Fortran, how do I represent time? There's no direct equivalent of LocalTime. Maybe just track hours and minutes as integers, then do the arithmetic manually.\n\nLet me plan the steps:\n\n1. Read two time strings, s and t.\n\n2. Parse each into hours and minutes:\n\n   For s: parse into xh and xm (hours and minutes of first time)\n\n   For t: parse into yh and ym (hours and minutes of the second time, which are the duration to subtract)\n\n3. Compute new time: original_time (xh,xm) minus hours yh and minutes ym.\n\n   So total minutes for x: totalMinX = xh * 60 + xm\n\n   subtract the total for y: totalY = yh * 60 + ym\n\n   new_total = totalMinX - totalY\n\n   then compute new_hours = new_total /60, new_minutes = new_total mod 60\n\n   but need to handle possible negative results?\n\nWait, but the problem may assume that the first time is larger, so the result is still a valid time. Maybe the problem expects that.\n\nAlternatively, the resulting time should stay as a time of day but potentially negative? Not sure. The Java code does exactly the subtraction, so even if it goes negative, but LocalTime might not handle that?\n\nWait, in Java, LocalTime can't be negative. So if x is, say, 01:00 and y is 02:00, then x minus 2 hours would be 23:00, then minus another 0 minutes, so 23:00. But that would be equivalent to -1 hours, but since LocalTime can't represent negative times, it wraps around? Or perhaps the input ensures that the result is valid?\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that the first time is after the second time's duration?\n\nBut in any case, the code as written in Java would just subtract y's hours and minutes from x, so the same needs to be done in Fortran. So we can compute the total minutes, subtract, then convert back to hours and minutes.\n\nBut in Fortran code, perhaps the steps are:\n\nRead s and t.\n\nsplit s into xh, xm\n\nsplit t into yh, ym\n\ncompute total minutes of x minus total of y:\n\nresult_min = (xh*60 + xm) - (yh*60 + ym)\n\nthen,\n\nresult_h = result_min / 60\n\nresult_min = mod(result_min, 60)\n\nBut wait, if the result is negative, then mod might need to be handled differently?\n\nWait in Fortran, integer division can be tricky with negatives. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects that the difference is positive, so that mod is okay?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute how:\n\nThe result hours is result_min / 60\n\nthen the remainder is modulo.\n\nBut if result_min is negative, then mod(-30,60) would be 30 in Fortran? Or wait, Fortran's modulo is different from remainder. Let me think:\n\nIn Fortran, modulo(a,p) = a - p*(a/p), but with integer division being towards zero?\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe better to use mod(a,p) which might be better here.\n\nWait, maybe to get the correct hours and minutes:\n\nresult_h = result_min / 60\n\nresult_m = result_min - result_h * 60\n\nThat way, regardless of negative, but if result_min is negative, then the hours can be negative, but the minutes will be between -59 and 0? Hmm. However, when the problem expects the result printed as HH:MM as a time, leading zeros maybe? Or perhaps assume that the result is positive.\n\nWait, let me check the original Java code. For example, if x is 1:00 (1 hour), and y is 2 hours, then the code does:\n\nx (1:00) minus 2 hours: -1 hour, then minus minutes (if y's minutes are 0), so -1 hour, which as a LocalTime would be invalid, but Java's LocalTime.minusHours(2) would actually handle that with wrapping?\n\nWait, actually, trying in Java: LocalTime x = LocalTime.of(1, 0); then x.minusHours(2) would throw an exception?\n\nNo, maybe it does allow it, but the resulting time would be adjusted.\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. The code uses LocalTime's minusHours and minusMinutes, so for example:\n\nSuppose x is 1:30 and y is 2:15 (from the example):\n\nx.minusHours(y.getHour()) would be x.minusHours(2) \u2192 1 - 2 = negative hour? Wait, no. LocalTime doesn't support that. Wait, the LocalTime.minusHours would actually subtract the hours, but if it goes below zero, does it wrap?\n\nNo, I think that actually, no. Because LocalTime represents times from 00:00 to 23:59, you can't have negative. So for example, LocalTime.of(1, 0).minusHours(2) would throw an exception? Wait, no, Java's LocalTime's minusHours is designed to handle the arithmetic by adjusting the time correctly. Let me test in mind.\n\nWait, the LocalTime.minusHours() method subtracts that many hours from the time. So if you have 01:00 and minus 2 hours, you get 23:00 of the previous day? But since it's a time, not a date, it wraps around to 23:00?\n\nWait, actually, according to Java 8 documentation, LocalTime.minusHours(long hours) returns a time with the given number of hours subtracted, wrapping around midnight to previous day.\n\nWait but since it's a local time (no date), the result would effectively be computed modulo 24 hours?\n\nWait no, for example:\n\nLocalTime start = LocalTime.MIDNIGHT;\n\nstart.minusHours(1) would be 23:00.\n\nstart.minusHours(25) would be 23:00 -24h \u2192 -1 day? Or wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, actually when dealing with LocalTime:\n\nThe method is:\n\npublic LocalTime minusHours(long hours)\n\nBut how is that computed?\n\nProbably t.minusHours(h) is equivalent to t.minus(Period.ofHours(h)), which would subtract that many hours. So for example, if x is 1:00, and y is 2 hours, then x minus 2 hours is 23:00 (assuming it's on the same day?). But since it's a time without a date, Java will handle it as modular 24 hours, so that it's equivalent to 1:00 minus 2 hours \u2192 (1-2) \u2192 but that would be negative, but treated as 23:00 since 24-1, wait no. 1 - 2 hours is -1 hour, which is 23 hours on the previous day, but as a time it is 23:00.\n\nSo the subtraction wraps around. So the code would allow times like that, even if negative-ish.\n\nSo, when translating this code, in Fortran, need to similarly handle the subtraction, and represent the result as current time minus (hour + minutes of y).\n\nThus, perhaps better to compute total minutes:\n\nx's total minutes = xh * 60 + xm\n\ny's total minutes (to subtract) = yh *60 + ym\n\nthen, the difference is total = x_total - y_total\n\nthen, new_h = total / 60\n\nnew_m = total mod 60 \u2192 but need to ensure that mod works correctly in Fortran.\n\nWait in Fortran, modulo( a,b ) gives the remainder with the same sign as b, so if (a,60) would have:\n\nif a is -60 \u2192 mod(-60,60)=0\n\nif a is -30 \u2192 mod(-30,60) = 30?\n\nWait, no. Let me think in terms of example:\n\nSuppose the difference is -30 minutes. Then total = -30.\n\nnew_h = -30 / 60 \u2192 that's -0.5 \u2192 since it's integer division, so in Fortran, dividing integers truncates toward zero, so that would be -0.\n\nWait in Fortran, integer division 4 / 2 \u2192 2, but 3/2 is 1, 5/2 is 2, -5/2 is -2 (since it truncates towards zero). So for -30 / 60 \u2192 that's 0.5 *(-60), so integer division / gives 0. So:\n\nnew_h = -30 / 60 \u2192 0\n\nthen new_m = -30 mod 60 \u2192 the modulo function:\n\nmodulo is positive?\n\nmod(-30,60) would be -30, but mod is different?\n\nLet me recall that:\n\nFortran's modulo(a,p) is a - p * floor(a/p)\n\nBut mod(a,p) is a - p*int(a/p), where int(a/p) is the integer part towards zero.\n\nSo for a =-30 and p =60,\n\nmodulo: -30 -60*floor(-30/60) \u2192 floor(-0.5) is -1 \u2192 -30 -60*(-1) = 30\n\nmod is -30 -60*0 (since -30/60 is -0.5, int is 0) \u2192 -30 mod 60 \u2192 -30 \u2192 but mod gives a mod p as a - p * n where n is the integer chosen such that the result is between 0 and p-1?\n\nWait I'm getting confused here. Let me check with actual numbers:\n\nIf a = -30 and p =60,\n\nmod(-30,60) in Fortran would be 30?\n\nOr no?\n\nLet me think: For modulo function.\n\nThe problem requires that result of modulo(a,p) should equal to a - p * floor(a/p).\n\nSo, for a = -30, p =60,\n\nfloor(a/p) is floor(-0.5) = -1.\n\nThus, modulo would be -30 -60*(-1) = -30 +60 = 30.\n\nThe mod function is given by a - p * int(a/p), where int(a/p) is the integer part towards zero.\n\nint(-30/60) \u2192 -30/60 is -0.5 \u2192 integer part is 0 \u2192 thus mod(-30,60) would be -30 - (0)*60 \u2192 -30. Wait but mod is different from modulo.\n\nWait the difference is that modulo uses floor division and mod uses division towards zero.\n\nThus, for mod(-30, 60) would be -30, but modulo( -30, 60) is 30.\n\nHmm, which one do we need here?\n\nWe need the remainder such that when you add (new_h *60) + new_m, it equals the original total. So total = new_h *60 + rem.\n\nWe need to do total = new_h *60 + rem, where |rem| < 60.\n\nIn code:\n\nnew_h = total //60\n\nnew_m = total - (new_h * 60)\n\nThat will work for all cases. So new_m is total mod 60?\n\nWait:\n\nIn code, for example:\n\ntotal = -30.\n\nnew_h = -30 /60 \u2192 -0.5 \u2192 in Fortran, integer division truncates towards zero \u2192 -30 /60 \u2192 0 (since 0*60 is 0 which is bigger than -30. Wait, integer division in Fortran of two integers returns it as integer. So -30 /60 would be 0 (since 0*60 is closer to -30 than -1*60 which is -60).\n\nWait, so:\n\nInteger division:\n\n. So in Fortran:\n\nlet total be an integer variable. Let's say total = -30.\n\nthen new_h = total / 60 \u2192 that would be -30/60 = 0.5 \u2192 Rounds toward zero \u2192 0.\n\nnew_m is total modulo 60? Or total mod 60?\n\nWait, the formula:\n\nnew_m = total - new_h*60 \u2192 in this example:\n\n-30 -0 = -30 \u2192 new_m would be -30, which is not between 0-59. But that's not correct for a time.\n\nWait that's the problem. Because the result would be -0 hours plus -30 mins would be -30 minutes (like 12:00 subtracted 30 mins would be 11:30, but here it's negative total).\n\nHmm, so perhaps this is not the way to represent it. Alternatively, the calculation for new_h is (total + 60) /60 ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, need to represent the hours as total /60, and new_m is total mod 60, but if new_m is negative, then adjust hours accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, to handle this properly, just compute the remainder with modulo(,60).\n\nWait let's see:\n\nnew_h = total /60 (integer division towards zero)\n\nthen, remainder = total MOD 60.\n\nWait, in this example with total =-30:\n\nMOD is -30 mod60 \u2192 in Fortran, mod( -30,60) is -30, as explained earlier. But modulo is 30.\n\nHmm, perhaps the modulo function is the one to use here. Because:\n\nmodulo( total,60 ) would give a remainder between 0 and 59?\n\nWait modulo(a,p) is a - p * floor(a/p). So for total =-30 and p=60:\n\nmodulo: -30 -60 * floor(-30/60) \u2192 floor(-0.5)= -1 \u2192 mod result is -30 -60*(-1) = -30+60 = 30.\n\nSo the remainder would be 30, but then the new hours would have to be total//60, but that's computed as floor division?\n\nWait in this example, total is -30, modulo 60 gives 30.\n\nThen, the actual new_h is floor( (-30) / 60 ). Since in integer division in Fortran, it is -30/60 is 0.\n\nBut the total - remainder to get the hours:\n\ntotal = new_h *60 + mod \u2192 but with modulo( total,60 )\n\nWait:\n\nModulo gives remainder such that a = p*floor(a/p) + mod(a,p)\n\nThus, total = 60 * (-1)*(-1?) Hmm perhaps better to see:\n\nFor total of -30, modulo gives:\n\nmod_val = 30,\n\nthen total - mod_val = -60 \u2192 -60 /60 = -1 \u2192 which is the floor total /60 \u2192 -0.5 \u2192 floor is -1.\n\nThus, new_h = (total - mod_val)/60 \u2192 but that's not helpful.\n\nWait perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nnew_h = total / 60 \u2192 gives quotient via division towards zero,\n\nremainder = total - new_h *60,\n\nthen if remainder is negative, adjust hours by subtracting 1 and adding 60 to remainder.\n\nWait, like in:\n\nif (remainder <0 ) then:\n\nremainder = remainder +60\n\nnew_h = new_h -1 \u2192 but in code, difficult to track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nnew_m = modulo( total, 60 )\n\nnew_m is between 0 -59.\n\nThen new_h = (total - new_m)/60.\n\nWait that could work.\n\nExample total is -30:\n\nnew_m = modulo( -30,60 ) =30,\n\nthen new_h = (-30 -30)/60 = -60 /60 = -1 \u2192 so new_h is -1, new_m is 30.\n\nSo time would be -1 hour and 30 minutes? That can't be represented as a time of day, but in terms of time difference, that's equivalent to subtraction.\n\nHmm. So in the Fortran code, the result is new_h = total //60 \u2192 but that would give wrong sign for the case above.\n\nAlternatively, use the mod function, but that leads to negative remainders.\n\nHmm. This part is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, I can use the same logic as the code in Java, assuming the result should be a time as per Java's LocalTime behavior.\n\nIn Java, when you subtract hours and minutes, for example, x=1:00 minus 2 hours and 15 minutes would end up at 22:45. Because 1 hour minus 2 hours is -1 hour, which becomes 23 (since 24-1=23?), and then minus 15 minutes would be 23:45 \u2192 but maybe not? Wait, wait:\n\nWait for the Java code:\n\nx is the time. Let's say x is 1:00,\n\ny is 2:15 (so y.getHour is 2, y.getMinute is 15).\n\nx.minusHours(2) \u2192 1:00 minus 2 hours \u2192 that would become 23:00 (since 1 -2 = -1 hour \u2192 wraps to 23).\n\nThen minus 15 minutes \u2192 22:45. So the result would be 22:45.\n\nSo the result is effectively x minus ( y's duration )\n\nSo to mimic that, in Fortran, the calculation is total = xh*60 + xm - yh*60 - ym,\n\nthen:\n\ntotal = total_minutes,\n\nand then, we need to compute hours and minutes as (total /60 ) and (total mod 60), but when mod is negative, adjust as follows:\n\nWait but actually, total can be any integer, negative or not.\n\nWe can compute hours as total /60, and minutes as modulo(total,60) \u2192 because this way, for total = -30,\n\nmodulo gives +30,\n\nso hours would be (total - 30)/60 \u2192 ( -60)/60 \u2192 -1 \u2192 thus, -1 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nBut how does that become a valid time?\n\nAh, so the time is negative hours? That is not a proper time.\n\nAh, this is the problem. So Java's LocalTime can handle negative hours in the subtraction?\n\nWait:\n\nUsing the example above, 1:00 (which is 60 minutes) minus 2 hours and 15 minutes (135 minutes) \u2192 60-135= -75 minutes \u2192 which is -1 hour 15 minutes.\n\nBut in Java's code, 1:00 minus 2 hours \u2192 ( -1 hour ) \u2192 but LocalTime handles that as a time on the previous day \u2192 so the time would be 23:00 (assuming midnight is 00:00 \u2192 minus 2 hours from 1:00 is 23:00).\n\nWait that's only 59 minutes?\n\nWait let me step back.\n\nLocalTime x = LocalTime.of(1,0); \u2192 t is 01:00.\n\ny = LocalTime.of(2, 15) \u2192 02:15.\n\nThe Java code's calculation: x.minusHours(y.getHour()) \u2192 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 but you can't have -1 hour. So how does minusHours work here?\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake. Java's LocalTime.minusHours does wrap around, so that if you subtract more hours than present, it goes negative? But what's the actual result?\n\nLooking up Java documentation:\n\nJava's LocalTime minusHours:\n\nReturns a copy of this time with the specified number of hours subtracted.\n\nThe time returned is the same as the original time minus the duration of the hours. The calculation wraps around midnight.\n\nSo after subtracting, the time wraps around.\n\nSo in that case, LocalTime.of(1,0).minusHours(2) would result in 23:00 of the previous day.\n\nBut since LocalTime does not store the date, it will just represent the time 23:00.\n\nSimilarly, if we do minus another 15 minutes (the minute part), then:\n\n23:00 minus 15 minutes is 22:45 \u2192 so the total result is 22:45.\n\nThus, treating it as modular 24 hours in the calculation.\n\nSo in terms of total_minutes calculation:\n\nThe desired result must be computed modulo 24*60 (1440) to get the correct time within 24h.\n\nWait because the final time is a valid LocalTime (0:00 to 23:59).\n\nWait, perhaps total_minutes should be adjusted modulo 1440 to bring it into that range.\n\nAh! Because the result is a time, not a duration, so we must keep it in a valid time (0 <= total <1440).\n\nWait so if the difference is -30 minutes (total= -30), we can add 1440 to get 1410, which corresponds to (1410/60)=23, remainder 30 minutes \u2192 23:30 \u2192 but that's adding a full day's worth of minutes. Wait, -30 mod 1440 is 1410.\n\nWait that would actually give 1410 minutes \u2192 23h30 \u2192 but the example before with total -75 (minutes):\n\n-75 mod 1440 \u2192 1440-75= 1365 \u2192 22h45 which is correct.\n\nAh! So the problem in the code's original calculation is that it's treating the first time as is, and then subtracting y's duration, but the result must be wrapped modulo 1440 so it stays in 0-1440. Otherwise, negative minutes would lead to negative time values, which Java's LocalTime can handle via wrapping but in Fortran code, perhaps we have to perform modulo 1440.\n\nWait but the Java code doesn't modulo it. Let's see:\n\nSuppose x is 00:30 (30 minutes) and y is 01:00 (60 minutes). The difference is 30 -60 = -30 minutes \u2192 but according to the code in java, what is the output?\n\nJava: x is 00:30, subtract 1 hour \u2192 -00:30 minus 1 hour gives 23:30, then subtract 0 minutes \u2192 23:30. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is actually treating subtracting y's total minutes from x's.\n\nWait total = x - y \u2192 then total_minutes mod 1440 gives the correct time.\n\nAh, right! Because subtracting a duration from a time, you have to treat it modulo 24 hours (a day).\n\nSo, to represent the resulting time, you need to take the total difference modulo 1440 (24 *60). Because the time is cyclical every 24h.\n\nThus, the code in Fortran should be:\n\nCompute total = (xh*60 + xm) - (yh *60 + ym )\n\nthen total = mod(total, 1440)\n\nif (total <0) total = total + 1440 \u2192 because mod in Fortran gives remainder between -p to p ?\n\nWait, let me figure out how mod works for total.\n\nWait mod( -30, 1440 ) \u2192 in Fortran:\n\nmod(a,p) is a - p*int(a/p).\n\nSo, mod(-30,1440) = -30 - 1440 * int(-30/1440) \u2192 -30/1440= -0.020833 so int is 0 \u2192 mod is -30 + 0 = -30.\n\nBut then modulo( -30,1440) is -30 -1440* floor(-30/1440) \u2192 floor(-0.0208) is -1 \u2192 so modulo gives -30 - ( -1440 *1 ) \u2192 -30+1440= 1410.\n\nAh, so modulo function gives the right result. So total_mod = modulo( total, 1440 )\n\nBut if total is negative, modulo gives a positive remainder between 0 and 1439?\n\nWait:\n\nmodulo(total, 1440) gives the remainder as a value between 0 and p-1 (if p is positive). So yes.\n\nYes:\n\nmodulo(1410, 1440) \u2192 is 1410.\n\nmodulo(-30,1440)= 1410 (since 1440-30).\n\nSo the correct way is to compute total = total mod 1440 with modulo function, so the remainder is in 0<= total_mod <1440.\n\nThus,\n\nIn code:\n\ntotal = (xh *60 + xm) - (y_h *60 + y_m)\n\ntotal = modulo( total, 1440 )\n\nthen,\n\nnew_h = total /60 \u2192 integer division,\n\nnew_m = modulo( total, 60 )\n\nWait, because then total = new_h *60 + new_m\n\nBut when total is 1410 ( from -30 mod 1440 \u2192 1410)\n\nthen:\n\nnew_h=1410 /60 \u2192 23 (23 *60 =1380 \u2192 1410-1380=30 \u2192 new_m=30)\n\nso the time is 23:30 \u2192 correct for the earlier example.\n\nWait but in the example where total was -75 (like the 1:00 minus 2h 15m example), total mod 1440 \u2192 1440-75= 1365.\n\nTotal would be 1365.\n\nWhich divided by 60 \u2192 22*60=1320 \u2192 remainder 45 \u2192 (22,45) \u2192 correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct steps are:\n\n1. Read s and t strings.\n\n2. Parse s into xh, xm.\n\n3. Parse t into yh, ym.\n\n4. Compute total = (xh*60 + xm) - (yh*60 + ym).\n\n5. total = modulo(total, 1440) \u2192 to bring it within 0-1439.\n\n6. new_h = total / 60\n\n   new_m = modulo( total, 60) \u2192 this gives the remainder 0-59.\n\n7. Output as HH:MM with leading zeros as needed.\n\nSo now, handling leading zeros in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, the output for times like 3:1 (3 hours and 1 minute) should be 03:01, so we need to format it with leading zero for single-digit hours and minutes.\n\nThus in Fortran's write statement, use format codes (I2.2 for fixed-width with leading zeros).\n\nNow, putting all that together:\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nWe will need variables for s and t, the time strings. Let's declare them as character*(5), maybe. Since \"HH:MM\" can be up to 5 characters (like \"23:59\" is 5 chars).\n\nBut to be safe, maybe use 6 characters. Or perhaps 5 is sufficient.\n\nDeclare:\n\nCHARACTER (LEN=5) :: s, t\n\nThen read them:\n\nBut in Fortran, reading from stdin, for two strings. Using read(*,*) s, t ?\n\nWait Wait, when using read*, the default is to read with free format. But if the user inputs two strings separated by space, like \"14:30 09:25\", then it would be okay. So:\n\nread(*,*) s, t\n\nYes.\n\nThen parse s:\n\nFind the colon in s:\n\npos = index(s,':')\n\nxh_str = s(1:pos-1)\n\nxm_str = s(pos+1:)\n\nWe can read those as integers.\n\nSame with t.\n\nIn Fortran, converting string to integers can be done with internal reads.\n\nSo for xh = 0:\n\ninteger xh, xm, yh, ym\n\nread(xh_str,*) xh\n\nWait for example:\n\ns is \"09:30\", then xh_str is \"09\" \u2192 read as 9, okay.\n\nBut leading zeros are preserved? Probably, because when you read \"09\", the integer is 9.\n\nThus, proceed:\n\nParsing s:\n\npos = index(s,':')\n\nxh_str = s(1:pos-1)\n\nxm_str = s(pos+1:)\n\nread(xh_str,*) xh\n\nread(xm_str,*) xm\n\nSimilarly for t.\n\nThen compute yh and ym.\n\nNow compute total.\n\ntotal = xh *60 + xm - ( yh *60 + ym )\n\nThen compute total modulo 1440.\n\ntotal = modulo( total,1440 )\n\nthen:\n\nnew_h = total /60 \u2192 integer division.\n\nnew_m = mod( total,60 )\n\nWait but modulo would be better?\n\nYes, to get 0-59 for minutes.\n\nBecause mod(total,60) can give negative?\n\nWait, no, total after modulo(1440) is between 0-1439, so mod( total, 60 ) is same as modulo( total,60 ), and is between 0-59.\n\nBecause total is between 0 and 1439.\n\nSo new_m = total mod 60 \u2192 gives 0\u201359.\n\nThen, output as two digits for hours and minutes.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nwrite(*,'(i2,\":\",i2.2)') new_h, new_m\n\nWait, but i2.2 would format as two digits with leading zeros for numbers <10?\n\nYes, in Fortran, the 'i2' format implies a field width of 2, and the optional .precision is the minimum number of digits (but for integers, the . is often for floating points). Maybe the format should be '(i2.2,\":\",i2.2)'.\n\nAlternatively, using edit descriptors specifying the field width with leading zeros:\n\nThe format 'I2.2' will pad with leading zeros.\n\nFor example:\n\nWrite(6, 100) new_h, new_m\n\n100 format (i2.2,':',i2.2)\n\nWait perhaps:\n\nformat (i2,A,i2)\n\nWait, but the write statement can be like:\n\nwrite(*,'(i2.2,\":\",i2.2)') new_h, new_m\n\nThis should give two digits for hours and two for minutes.\n\nTesting example:\n\ncase where new_h is 3 \u2192 written as \"03\"\n\nnew_m is 5 \u2192 \"05\".\n\nYes.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_387_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=5) :: s,t\n  integer :: xh, xm, yh, ym\n  integer :: total, new_h, new_m\n  integer :: pos, xh_str_length, xm_str_count\n  ! read the two time strings\n  read(*,*) s,t\n\n  ! process first time s\n  pos = index(s,':')\n  if ( pos == 0 ) then\n     write(*,*) \"Invalid input: No colon in first time\"\n     stop\n  end if\n  xh_str_length = pos-1\n  ! read hour part\n  read(s(1:pos-1),*) xh\n  ! read minute part\n  read(s(pos+1:),*) xm\n\n  ! process second time t\n  pos = index(t,':')\n  if ( pos ==0 ) then\n     write(*,*) \"Invalid input: No colon in second time\"\n     stop\n  endif\n  read(t(1:pos-1),*) yh\n  read(t(pos+1:),*) ym\n\n  ! compute total difference\n  total = (xh*60 + xm) - (yh*60 + ym )\n  total = modulo( total, 1440 )\n\n  new_h = total /60\n  new_m = total - new_h *60  ! mod is same as modulo here since it is >=0.\n\n  ! output\n  write(*, '(i2.2,a1,i2.2)') new_h, ':', new_m\n\nend program codeforces_387_a\n\nWait, but in the calculation of new_m, perhaps using mod would be better.\n\nAlternatively, since modulo( total,60 )?\n\nBut since total is already 0-1439, new_h = total//60 \u2192 an integer division.\n\nnew_m = MOD( total, 60 )\n\nYes.\n\nSo the line:\n\nnew_m = mod( total, 60 )\n\nalternatively.\n\nBut the way written as total mod 60 is okay.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 12:30 00:00 \u2192 subtracting 0 mins \u2192 total difference is (12*60+30) \u2192 750 \u2192 mod 1440 is 750 \u2192 12:30 \u2192 output 12:30.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nUsing input \"1:00 2:15\" \u2192 x is 60 +0 =60, y is 2h15\u2192 (2*60+15)=135\u2192 total=60-135= -75 \u2192 mod 1440 \u2192 1440-75= 1365 \u2192 1365/60=22. So 22*60 is 1320 \u2192 1365-1320 =45 \u2192 new_h 22, new_m 45 \u2192 22:45 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"00:30\" and \"01:00\" \u2192 x is 30, y is 60 \u2192 total is -30 \u2192 mod becomes 1410 \u2192 1410/60=23 \u2192 23*60=1380 \u2192 rem 30 \u2192 23:30 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nEdge Case when total is 1440 \u2192 modulo 1440 gives 0 \u2192 00:00.\n\nTest case \"00:00\" and \"0:00\" \u2192 total 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0000 \u2192 00:00.\n\nAnother case: when total is exactly 1440, mod gives 0, so okay.\n\nAnother edge case: total 1439 \u2192 1439 mod1440 \u2192 remains 1439 \u2192 23h59 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, handling the string parsing correctly.\n\nWhat if the input is something like \"1:05\"?\n\nThe first string '1:05' is length 5? '1:05' is 4 characters? 1: has 2, then 05 \u2192 total length is 5? Wait '1:05' is 4 characters?\n\nYes. '1:05' \u2192 '1' : '05 \u2192 total 4 characters. So the len of s and t needs to be at least 4. The previous declarations were len=5. So \"00:00\" is 5 chars. So len=5 is okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, the variable s was declared as len=5. When read from input, if the string is 4 chars, then that's okay.\n\nAnother possibility for input like \"0:00\" \u2192 length 4 (0:00) \u2192 that's acceptable.\n\nThus, this should handle that.\n\nSo, putting all together, the code is as above.\n\nThe code:\n\nprogram codeforces_387_A\n  implicit none\n\n  character(len=5) :: s, t\n  integer :: xh, xm, yh, ym\n  integer :: total, new_h, new_m\n  integer :: pos\n\n  read(*,*) s, t\n\n  ! Process first time (s)\n  pos = index(s, ':')\n  if (pos == 0 .or. pos == 1 .or. pos == len(s)) then\n     write(*,*) \"Invalid input format for first time\"\n     stop\n  end if\n  read(s(1:pos-1),*) xh\n  read(s(pos+1:),*) xm\n\n  ! Process second time (t)\n  pos = index(t, ':')\n  if (pos == 0 .or. pos ==1 .or. pos == len(t)) then\n     write(*,*) \"Invalid input format for second time\"\n     stop\n  end if\n  read(t(1:pos-1),*) yh\n  read(t(pos+1:),*) ym\n\n  ! Compute difference\n  total = (xh *60 + xm) - (yh *60 + ym)\n  total = modulo(total, 1440)\n\n  new_h = total /60\n  new_m = modulo(total, 60)\n\n  ! Output\n  write(*, '(i2.2, \":\", i2.2)') new_h, new_m\n\nend program codeforces_387_A\n\nWait, in the module calculation of new_m can also do MOD(total,60), but with total being 0-1439, MOD would give same as modulo.\n\nWait the modulo would be the same as mod here because total is positive.\n\nThus, 'new_m = mod(total,60) ' is okay. Though modulo is more appropriate but both give 0-59.\n\nAlso, added error checking for cases where the colon is missing or at the end.\n\nLike, if the colon is not present \u2192 pos 0, or after the first character (1 -> '0:', then pos=2, so 0:rest.\n\nBut the check: pos ==0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to not assume but just assume the inputs are correct as per problem's constraints. As in programming competition, input is valid.\n\nThus, perhaps to eliminate error checks unless needed.\n\nBut for code robustness, maybe better to have.\n\nBut in any case, the original Java code didn't have input validation.\n\nSo, the assistant would probably produce the code above (without error checks) if the user just asked the code translation.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as above.\n\nWait the output format uses a space between the i2.2 and the colon?\n\nNo, in the format for the write statement: (i2.2, \":\", i2.2). That would print a colon between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it should be without the space. Wait in Fortran, the edit descriptor:\n\n'(i2.2,:,i2.2)' ?\n\nNo. The write format ' (i2.2, a, i2.2 )' perhaps is better, using a to print the colon.\n\nYes.\n\nThus:\n\n write(*,'(i2.2,a,i2.2)') new_h, ':', new_m\n\nBecause the 'a' is the length of the string in the expression. The colon is length 1.\n\n So:\n\n format (i2.2, a1, i2.2)\n\nThus the code has the write statement as that.\n\nHence the code final code is the one above I wrote earlier."
