Wait the first step (i=0) is the first character in processing (the last of original string). The previous state is i-1 = -1, which is invalid, so the base case is that for i=0, the starting condition is that before any characters, the pre is zero, so the (pre==0 gives 1, else 0). Thus, when building up, when i=0 (processing first character, i=0):\n\nfor the transitions, each new mod is (current_digit * base + pre) mod 13. Wait but the base is initialized as 1 (base=1). Wait let me track base's progression:\n\nbase starts as 1. Then for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So in step k (iteration i), base is (10)^i mod13?\n\nWait in the initial step:\n\nbase is 1. After processing step 0 (the first character, i=0):\n\nAt the end, before moving to next step, base is multiplied by 10 mod13. So after first step, base becomes 10 modulo13 (10). Wait, let's see the base variable is computed:\n\n initially base =1.\n\n for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n after processing, before next step, base= (base *10) mod13\n\nWait yes: the code has:\n\n    base = base *10 %13;\n\n after processing each i iteration. So the first loop runs for i from 0 to n-1. So base after first iteration (i=0) becomes 10. The next iteration's base is 10, then next becomes 100 mod13 which is 9 (since 9*13=117, 100- etc. ? Wait 10*10 mod13 is 100 mod13. Let's compute 13*7=91, 100-91=9 \u21d2 9 mod13. Yes. So the base variable is computed as base = (base *10 mod13) after the ith step. So base is the 10**i modulo13? Wait at step 0 (i=0), the base is 1 (initial value). Then after processing step 0, it becomes 10 (as above), which is like 10^1 mod13. After step 1 (i=1), it will become 10^2 mod13 (which is 9). So that's correct. So the base at each step is 10^(i) mod13?",

This requires that when the previous is the -1 step, i.e., before any digits, the initial condition of (pre =0 gives 1, else zero). So the starting condition is that the very first step must consider this. Hence, in the first step (i=0), when processing that current character and prior is pre, the prior_dp[i-1][pre] is (pre ==0? 1 :0). But how do we handle this in Fortran, given that arrays start at zero? Wait let's think of the first iteration:\n\nAt i=0:\n\nWe are in the first character, so for all pre in 0..12:\n\neach possible previous (pre) can only have come from an empty string, which, when adding a digit, gives previous mod pre. So maybe the base case is that, after adding the current digit's contribution (next or actual), we have a new mod of next_digit * base (since base starts at 1 (for first iteration)), which is (digit) mod13? Wait no, base here is 10^i, which for i=0 is 1. Wait the new mod is (base * digit + previous_mod) mod13. But previous_mod here refers to the mod before adding this digit. Wait, maybe the logic of DP is that, dp[i][new_mod] += num_ways to get to previous_mod then add the current digit's term. Wait let me re-look:\n\nThe transition formula is:\n\nfor each next digit (if ? then all 0-9, else one value):\n\nnew_mod = ( (base * current_digit ) + previous_mod ) mod13. The count is accumulated: dp[i][new_mod] += (previous count) which is the number of ways to have been in previous_mod before adding current step's digit and its contribution. So in the next step, for i=0:\n\nthe previous step (i-1 = -1) is considered as having a \"way count\" of 1 only when previous_mod is 0 (since the empty string's mod is zero), and 0 otherwise.",

The loops are such that for each combination of pre and next, the DP[i][newmod] += ... the contribution. So in Fortran, the same needs to be done. Now the key is to loop over each previous (pre) in 0 to 12, and for each next possible digit (based on current character), accumulate. But to avoid overwriting values in DP[i][newmod] before they are used for that same loop/step, we can:\n\nfor the current i, start with a temporary array for the new DP values.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding the code first. The Java program is solving a problem where you have a string of digits (maybe with '?' as wildcards), and you want to find the number of ways to replace the '?' so that the resulting number modulo 13 is 5. \n\nLooking at the Java code, it uses dynamic programming (DP table called dp) where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways for the first i characters such that the current mod is j. The transitions depend on whether the current character is a digit or a question mark. \n\nFirst, I need to replicate this logic in Fortran. Let's go step by step.\n\nThe variables: The main variables are MOD, cs (the input string), and the DP table. \n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be declared with DIMENSION statements. The DP array is two-dimensional, with indices up to the length of the string and 12 (since it's 13 mod values). However, in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default. Wait, but in the Java code, the indices go from 0 to cs.length-1 for the first dimension and 0 to 12 for the second. Hmm, so maybe in Fortran, I should adjust the indices accordingly or set the starting index to 0? \n\nWait, Fortran doesn't allow non-integer indices, but more importantly, starting indices can be set. Alternatively, maybe shifting all indices by 1? Let me think. For example, if the string has length N, then in Fortran, the DP array's first dimension would be from 0 to N-1, but Fortran arrays are from 1 to N. Wait, perhaps better to adjust everything by adding +1? Or use RE indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to adjust all indices to start at 1 in Fortran. But let's see.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, we can declare the arrays with the appropriate dimensions. The string in Java is a char array. In Fortran, strings are handled as character arrays, so that's manageable.\n\nThe main function here is inside the run method, so in Fortran, since it's a standalone program, we'll have a program block. Let's outline the structure.\n\nThe variables:\n\n- MOD is a constant long, equal to 1e9 +7. In Fortran, since we can have real(8) or integer*8, but for modulus, perhaps integer, but 1e9+7 is manageable as an 8-byte integer. So maybe using integer*8 for the DP arrays and variables. \n\nIn Fortran, variables are declared with types. The function should take input from stdin, so the equivalent of Scanner would be using read statements. \n\nLet me start by outlining the steps:\n\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Initialize the DP array. In Java it's a 2D array initialized as long[cs.length][13]; in Fortran, perhaps declared as integer*8, dimension(:,:), allocatable. The actual dimensions should be (n, 13), where n is the length of the string.\n   Wait but in Java, they use new, but in Fortran, we can compute the length first. Alternatively, in Java, cs.length is the length of the input string, which is read first. Let me think about the steps:\n\nJava code:\n\nIn run(), they do:\n\n- read the string with sc.next(). Well, in Fortran, when reading a string, we can read into a character variable of sufficient size. But we need to get the length first. Perhaps read the entire line, but better to read with a specified length. \n\nWait the Java code uses sc.next() - that is, the next token, but assuming that the input is a single string with no whitespace. So in Fortran: We can read the string as a single line. So something like:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: s\nread*, s\nn = len_trim(s)\nBut actually, Fortran has len_trim(s) which gives the length of the string without trailing spaces. But the user would input exactly the string, so that should work.\n\nAlternatively, using an adjustable-length string. But since Fortran's strings are fixed-length unless using allocatable types. Hmm, maybe better to use a fixed-length array and read the string until null terminator? Not sure. Maybe better to read the entire line and ignore possible trailing spaces. Let me see.\n\nIn any case, the first step is to read the input string s, then get its length n. Then set up the DP array.\n\nThe DP array in Fortran: The Java has dp[i][0..12], so perhaps in Fortran, we can make it 2D array with dimensions (n, 13). Wait, but in Java, the indices start at 0. But in Fortran, the first element is 1 by default, but we can set the bounds. For example:\n\ninteger*8, allocatable, dimension(:,:) :: dp\n\nallocate( dp(0: n-1, 0:12) ) \n\nWait but Fortran allows the dimensions to start at any integer. Maybe better to use 1-based indices? Let me think through the Java:\n\nIn Java, for i from 0 to cs.length-1, each step processes one character from the end (i starts at 0, first step looks at cs[length-1 -0], which is the last character. So the first loop is iterating over characters from the end.\n\nHmm, the code loops through i from 0 to n-1 (n is length of string). At each step, it is processing the character from the end (from right to left), so the order is reversed.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same steps.\n\nWait but in terms of the DP's indices, there are a few things to note. The DP array has dim1 from 0 up to (n-1), so in Fortran, perhaps use indices from 0 to n-1. But in Fortran, to do this, use an array with 0:..., which requires specifying explicit lower bounds. \n\nWait, in Fortran, when declaring an allocatable array, you can specify the bounds:\n\nallocate( dp(0:n-1, 0:12) )\n\nThat should work. Similarly for the loops.\n\nThe base variable is initialized as 1 and gets multiplied by 10 mod 13 each step. Let's see base is declared as a long in Java; in Fortran as integer*8.\n\nNow, for loops: The Java code loops over each character from the end. For the character at position (cs.length() -1 -i), as i increments from 0 to n-1.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ncharacter(len=100000) :: c\n...\ndo i = 0, n-1\n    current_char = s( (n - i): (n - i) )\n    ...\n\nWait, the original code processes the character at position (n-1 -i), since in the code: for each i in 0..n-1, the index is (cs.length-1 -i). The current character is the i-th character from the end. \n\nYes: the current index is:\n\ncs[ cs.length-1 - i ] \n\nBecause when i=0, it is the last character, then i=1, last-1, etc.\n\nSo in Fortran, assuming that s is a 1-based string (Fortran strings are 1-based unless declared otherwise), so first character is s(1), last is s(len)\n\nThen for position in the string, the index for the i-th iteration (0-based) is:\n\n (n-1 - i + 1) ??? Wait confusing.\n\nWait in Java, the string's length is N. The first character of the string is at index 0, the last is at N-1.\n\nIn Fortran, assuming s is stored as a 1-based string (since Fortran typically uses 1 for strings unless specified otherwise), the first character is s(1), and the nth character is s(N).\n\nSo, in Java, the character at position (cs.length -1 -i) is equivalent to the i-th step (starting with 0) for the last, second last, etc.\n\nIn Fortran terms, it's s(n -i) ?\n\nBecause suppose s has length n. i starts at 0, so for the first step (i=0), s(n) is the last character, then i=1, s(n-1), etc. Perfect.\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nNow the DP steps.\n\nFirst, Initialization. In Java, the initial dp[0][...] is for the first character (the end of the string in the first step). \n\nWait in the loops: For the first i (starting at 0), the first element (i=0) is the last character. \n\nThe base starts at 1, so in the first iteration, base is 1, then gets multiplied by 10 mod13 each step.\n\nNow for the DP transitions:\n\nFor each i (processing each step), first, if the current character is '?' then loop over all previous pre (0..12), and next digits (0..9). For each combination:\n\ndp[i][ (base*next + pre) mod 13 ] += (if this is first step (i=0) then 1 only if pre is zero?).\n\nWait, the Java code has:\n\ndp[i][(base * next + pre) %13] += (i>0? dp[i-1][pre] : (pre==0 ? 1 :0 ));\n\nSo, for each next digit (0..9 when '?') or the fixed digit when it's not '?'\n\nThe DP for current i is derived from the previous state (i-1).\n\nWait, in Fortran, since arrays are 0-based for this DP, we can replicate this.\n\nWait in the code, at step i, for each possible pre (previous mod 13), we consider the previous DP[i-1][pre], then compute the next mod value and add to the current DP[i][ new_mod ].\n\nBut in Fortran, the array would need to be allocated starting from 0 to be compatible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using 1-based in the DP arrays but adjusting the logic accordingly.\n\nBut let me think, for the DP array.\n\nInitialize:\n\nInitially, when i=0 (the first step), if the first character is a digit (or question?), the transitions would have i=0:\n\nfor pre in 0..12:\n\nthe initial value comes from the base case.\n\nWait in the Java code, for i=0:\n\nlooking at i>0? No, so check for (pre ==0 ? 1 : 0)\n\nSo the base case for the previous.\n\nWhen i=0, i-1 is -1 which is outside the array, so for the term (i>0 ? ... else ... )\n\nWait the initial state is that the previous step (when i=0, it's the very first character), the previous step would be i-1, but that's -1, which is not in the dp array. Hence the first character's case must be handled.\n\nWait the first step (i=0) is the first character in processing (the last of original string). The previous state is i-1 = -1, which is invalid, so the base case is that for i=0, the starting condition is that before any characters, the pre is zero, so the (pre==0 gives 1, else 0).\n\nThus, when building up, when i=0 (processing first character, i=0):\n\nfor the transitions, each new mod is (current_digit * base + pre) mod 13.\n\nWait but the base is initialized as 1 (base=1). \n\nWait let me track base's progression:\n\nbase starts as 1. Then for each step, it's multiplied by 10 mod 13. So in step k (iteration i), base is (10)^i mod13?\n\nWait in the initial step:\n\nbase is 1. After processing step 0 (the first character, i=0):\n\nAt the end, before moving to next step, base is multiplied by 10 mod13. So after first step, base becomes 10 modulo13 (10).\n\nWait, let's see the base variable is computed:\n\n initially base =1.\n\n for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n after processing, before next step, base= (base *10) mod13\n\nWait yes: the code has:\n\n    base = base *10 %13;\n\n after processing each i iteration.\n\n So the first loop runs for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n So base after first iteration (i=0) becomes 10.\n\nThe next iteration's base is 10, then next becomes 100 mod13 which is 9 (since 9*13=117, 100- etc. ?\n\n Wait 10*10 mod13 is 100 mod13. Let's compute 13*7=91, 100-91=9 \u21d2 9 mod13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the base variable is computed as base = (base *10 mod13) after the ith step. So base is the 10**i modulo13?\n\n Wait at step 0 (i=0), the base is 1 (initial value). Then after processing step 0, it becomes 10 (as above), which is like 10^1 mod13.\n\nAfter step 1 (i=1), it will become 10^2 mod13 (which is 9).\n\nSo that's correct. So the base at each step is 10^(i) mod13? Not exactly, because the step i comes before the multiplication? Wait the order is:\n\nIn the code:\n\nInside the for loop for each i:\n\n    ... compute the DP step using the current base (the original base for this iteration).\n\nThen after processing that step (i's iteration), before proceeding to next i, we set base = base*10 mod13.\n\nTherefore, the base for iteration i is 10^i mod 13?\n\nWait for i=0, the initial base is 1 (10^0), after first iteration i=0, base becomes 10^1=10 mod13. Then when processing i=1, the base is 10 (the previous value). Then after, it becomes 100 mod13 which is 9. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the base is 10^i mod13 at step i before processing.\n\nThat is important because the transition involves multiplying next or a digit, so the formula is:\n\nnext_mod = (base * digit + previous_mod) mod13.\n\nWait let me re-express:\n\nthe current digit contributes digit * (10^{i}) (since that's the place value in base 10). But mod13, so over all digits, the total mod is (d0 *10^{n-1} + d1*10^{n-2} ... ) mod13.\n\nDue to the recursive mod, the base here is the current's contribution's place value part mod13.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is using dynamic programming where each iteration i (processing the digit from the end) contributes the correct coefficient.\n\nNow, in terms of program steps:\n\nThe DP arrays are allocated (n rows (0..n-1), columns 0..12). \n\nBut in Fortran, if we use allocation, the array can be initialized. But in Java, they start with an empty array. In Fortran, when we alloc, the arrays are initialized to zero? Or do we have to initialize them ourselves?\n\nFortran allocatable arrays are initialized to all zero when allocated unless initialized otherwise. Wait, in fortran, when you allocate an array with allocate(array(...)), it is filled with zeros. Wait, is that correct?\n\nYes, from FORTRAN 90 and later, dynamic allocation using allocate(...) initializes elements to zero of their type. So in integer or integer*8, they are zero. \n\nWait but since the DP starts with counts, the initial step (i=0) needs to set some value. For example, when the first digit is '?', we must set previous state.\n\nLet me think through the first iteration:\n\nAt i=0:\n\nSuppose first character is '?', then it loops all next (0-9).\n\nFor each pre (0 to 12), since previous DP is i-1 = -1 (before any digits). The base case (pre ==0 ? 1 :0).\n\nSo for the first step (i=0):\n\nprev_dp = dp[i-1][pre], but since i=0, that's invalid. Therefore:\n\nthe term (pre==0 ?1 :0) is used.\n\nTherefore, for each possible pre in 0..12, we want to consider base * next_digit (where next varies over 0..9) plus the previous_mod (pre) mod13. But the previous_dp is only non-zero when pre is 0? Wait:\n\nWait the term added is for the current pre (previous states are from i-1, which is -1, so the only possible prior counts are when pre was 0 (since base cases? Or maybe initial state is that prior counts are zero except when it's 0 (pre is 0) which gives 1?\n\nThis requires that when the previous is the -1 step, i.e., before any digits, the initial condition of (pre =0 gives 1, else zero). So the starting condition is that the very first step must consider this.\n\nHence, in the first step (i=0), when processing that current character and prior is pre, the prior_dp[i-1][pre] is (pre ==0? 1 :0).\n\nBut how do we handle this in Fortran, given that arrays start at zero? \n\nWait let's think of the first iteration:\n\nAt i=0:\n\nWe are in the first character, so for all pre in 0..12:\n\neach possible previous (pre) can only have come from an empty string, which, when adding a digit, gives previous mod pre. So maybe the base case is that, after adding the current digit's contribution (next or actual), we have a new mod of next_digit * base (since base starts at 1 (for first iteration)), which is (digit) mod13? Wait no, base here is 10^i, which for i=0 is 1.\n\nWait the new mod is (base * digit + previous_mod) mod13. \n\nBut previous_mod here refers to the mod before adding this digit. Wait, maybe the logic of DP is that, dp[i][new_mod] += num_ways to get to previous_mod then add the current digit's term.\n\nWait let me re-look:\n\nThe transition formula is:\n\nfor each next digit (if ? then all 0-9, else one value):\n\nnew_mod = ( (base * current_digit ) + previous_mod ) mod13.\n\nThe count is accumulated: dp[i][new_mod] += (previous count) which is the number of ways to have been in previous_mod before adding current step's digit and its contribution.\n\nSo in the next step, for i=0:\n\nthe previous step (i-1 = -1) is considered as having a \"way count\" of 1 only when previous_mod is 0 (since the empty string's mod is zero), and 0 otherwise.\n\nSo, for the first step, the previous count is 1 only when previous is 0. So for all possible previous_mod (0 to 12), except 0, they contribute 0.\n\nHence, for each current_next_digit:\n\nThe new_mod comes from previous_mod=0 plus (digit * base) mod13.\n\nWait let's think in code:\n\nfor each pre from 0 to 12:\n\nthe previous's count is 1 if (i==0 and pre ==0), else dp[i-1][pre] (if i>0).\n\nSo during the first iteration (i=0), the previous value is 1 only for pre=0 (and zero otherwise).\n\nHence, when the current char is ?, then for each next (0..9), pre is looping all 0..12 but the only contribution is when pre is 0, since other pre values would have previous count zero.\n\nSo the new_mod is (base * next + 0) mod13? Because since previous_mod here was 0 (since only possible pre contributing is 0), then the new mod becomes (base* next) mod13 ?\n\nWait the formula is:\n\nnew_mod = (base * next + pre ) mod13 ?\n\nWait no. Wait:\n\nThe new_mod = ( digit * base + previous_mod ) mod13.\n\nSince base * digit?\n\nYes. So the formula is (current_digit * base) plus previous_mod (mod13) ?\n\nWait, in terms of an example:\n\nLet me think of a first digit (i=0 first step). For example, suppose first character is '5'. The digit is 5. base here is 1. So contribution is (5 *1) mod13. So new_mod = (5) + previous_mod (which was zero before this step). Wait but the previous_mod is the previous mod before adding this digit. Wait the prior steps: before any digits, the mod is 0. So adding this first digit (5 * 1) mod13: so mod is 5. Hence the count for mod 5 should be incremented by 1 (since previous had a count of 1 for 0). \n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nHence the transition makes sense.\n\nNow, back to code.\n\nNow, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\nProgram Structure:\n\nprogram abc135d\n\n implicit none\n\ninteger*8 :: MOD = 1000000007\n\n character(len=200000) :: s  ! Need to read string up to (say) 200k chars, as per problem constraints (assuming 1e5 is needed; but adjust)\n\n integer :: n\n\ninteger :: i, pre, next\n\n integer*8, allocatable, dimension(:,:) :: dp\n\n! Read the string:\n\nread*, s\n\nn = len_trim(s)\n\nallocate( dp(0:n-1, 0:12) )\n\n! Initialize dp to zero.\n\n! Because in Fortran the allocate initializes to zero. \n\n ! Wait but in the DP, initial values depend on prior steps. Since we are building dp for each step, \n\n we need to iterate through i from 0 to n-1.\n\n ! Processing each character (starting from last character of original string, which is first character to process (i=0))\n\n base is initially 1. Need a variable for base as integer*8.\n\n integer*8 :: base = 1\n\n do i =0, n-1\n\n    integer :: current_char_digit = -1\n\n    character(len=1) :: ch = s(n-i) \n\n    if (ch == '?') then\n\n        ! Need to consider all next digits 0..9\n\n        current_char_digit = -1\n\n    else\n\n        current_char_digit = ichar(ch) - ichar('0')\n\n    end if\n\n    ! Now process the transitions:\n\n    ! We'll have to iterate over previous states and compute new states.\n\n    ! For this iteration, the current base is before any change.\n\n    ! When building the dp[i] array, the steps are:\n\n    ! need to loop over previous pre, and compute for new_mod.\n\n    ! But since we are overwriting the current dp[i], we need to make a copy from previous?\n\n    ! Ah, here we have a possible problem.\n\n    ! In Java, they might be using a 2D array, with dp[i] dependent on dp[i-1].\n\n    ! In Fortran, when filling dp[i], we cannot use dp[i][...] values already computed in this step because they might overwrite previous contributions. Hence, since we need to track dp previous (from i-1) and compute dp[i]. So must be careful in overwriting.\n\n    ! To do that, perhaps we need to create a temporary array (a single dimension array) to hold the next state.\n\n    ! So here's the problem: in the Java code, for each digit (or digit in 0-9), we loop through pre, and loop through next, and add to the DP[i].\n\n    Wait in the Java code:\n\n    They start with the new dp row being zero (since initially the 2D array is allocated and filled with 0. So in each step, for the current i, it's initialized to zero.\n\n    Wait no: how?\n\n    In the Java code, the dp array is initialized as a new DP array. For each i, the code resets the current row's values (by adding and initial zeros, but in Fortran's case, since we can't be sure, since each row is a separate array, or perhaps in Fortran, dp[i][all] is zero before processing?\n\nHmm, maybe in Java it's set up such that the dp array starts with all zeros, but when building the next row, you have to loop over the previous row.\n\nIn Java's code, for each current step (processing the current character (i)), the DP array's current row [i] is initially zero. \n\nWait looking at code: in Java:\n\nlong[][] dp = new long[cs.length][13]; \n\n all cells initialized to zero.\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n process:\n\n    if it's ?, then for each pre to 12:\n\n            for next (0..9):\n\n                dp[i][...] += ... \n\nSo all the accesses to DP[i][...] are to zero initially, so the first time they are set, they accumulate.\n\nHence in Fortran, for the current i-th row (the first dimension), each of its entries is initialized to zero before processing. Hence, we can proceed similarly. \n\nWait but in Fortran, the entire array is initialized to zero at Allocate. So when we iterate over each i from 0 to n-1, the DP[i, 1:12] are zero by default. So we can process as:\n\nfor the i-th step:\n\n   compute all transitions using DP[i-1][...] (the previous row). \n\nBut since we are overwriting DP[i][newmod], and not using values from i-th row during computation (except at end), then the approach is okay.\n\nWait but in Java, the way they add is that in a nested loop for pre from 0 to 12, then loop over next (0-9 for ? case) or a single next for fixed. The loops are such that for each combination of pre and next, the DP[i][newmod] += ... the contribution. \n\nSo in Fortran, the same needs to be done. Now the key is to loop over each previous (pre) in 0 to 12, and for each next possible digit (based on current character), accumulate.\n\nBut to avoid overwriting values in DP[i][newmod] before they are used for that same loop/step, we can:\n\nfor the current i, start with a temporary array for the new DP values. \n\nWait better approach:\n\nBecause directly modifying dp(i,:) while simultaneously depending on DP(i) could have problems (if intermediate calculations are overriting values that need to remain for earlier entries in the loops). \n\nInstead the correct way is to create a temporary array storing dp(i) for the current step as the sum. Since the origin is from DP(i-1). \n\nIn Fortran, since arrays are arranged so that you can reference prev (i-1), this is doable.\n\nHence perhaps the proper approach is:\n\nInitialize temp array (if needed), but let's think.\n\nAlternatively, in the code's logic, for each pre (previous mod), and each next_digit (as per ?, then each next is tried), there is a contribution to new_mod: (base * next_digit + pre) mod13 of the previous count. \n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nfor current iteration's DP[i] row, all entries start as zero (allocated earlier).\n\nThen, for each pre (0 to 12):\n\n  prev_count = if (i >0) dp(i-1,pre) else (pre==0 ? 1 :0)\n\n   then for each applicable next_digit (either all 0-9, or one):\n\n      new_mod = mod(base * next_digit + pre, 13)\n\n      dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_count\n\n      dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD) \n\nSo this is possible.\n\nHence, for each current pre/next, adding the contribution to the current dp[i]'s new_mod and doing modulo MOD.\n\nThus, in code.\n\nBut in code, in Fortran loops:\n\nFirst, we need two loops: over pre (0 to 12) and for next digits (depending on current_char).\n\nThe character is either the '?', so next 0 to 9, else just the single digit.\n\nHence, the loops need to be set as follows.\n\nLet me outline code:\n\nIn the do loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    ch = s(n-i: n-i)  ! substring one char.\n\n    if (trim(ch) .eq '?') then \n\n    else\n\n    current_digit = ichar(ch) - ichar('0') \n\n    end if \n\n    then, setup the next_digits to loop over:\n\n    if its ?, then next = 0,1,..9 \n\n    else next only current_digit \n\n         So we have a do loop over those possible next digits.\n\nBut in fortran loops, perhaps better to make a driver loop with an array of possible next_digits:\n\n            ! For the current character:\n\n    if (current is ? then:\n\n        do next =0,9\n\n          ... do the pre loop over this next and add to dp[i]\n\n        end do \n    else:\n\n        next = current_digit \n\n          ... do the pre loop \n\n    wait, no\u2014 because the loops over pre and next need to be:\n\n    For the case of ?, you have to loop over all possible next (digits 0-9), and for each, process all pre.\n\n    Hence:\n\n    So the code for this part is:\n\n    if (it's '?') then \n\n       do next=0,9:\n\n          do pre=0,12\n\n             prev_count = if (i>0) then dp(i-1, pre) else (if pre ==0 then 1 else 0 )\n\n             new_mod = mod( base*next + pre, 13 )\n\n             dp( i, new_mod) = dp(i,new_mod) + prev_count\n\n             dp(i,new_mod) = mod( dp(i,new_mod), MOD )\n\n          end do pre loop \n\n    --> but this is nested loops: pre inside next. \n\nWait, but for, say each next is separate: \n\nWait actually, the way code is written in Java, the next is first, then pre. \n\nActually, maybe in Fortran loops, loops can be written as:\n\nif (it is ?):\n\n    do next=0,9\n\n        do pre =0,12\n\n            ... compute and add \n\n        end do pre\n\n    end do next\n\nBut to optimize, better to loop over pre for each next? Or perhaps in this case, loops will be nested as per code.\n\nAlternatively, code could be:\n\n    if (it's ?) then \n\n        do pre = 0,12\n\n            prev_count = get_prev_count(pre, i)\n\n            do next_upperbound = 9\n\n               next = 0 ...9:\n\n                compute new_mod\n\n                dp(i, newmod) += prev_count\n\n                ... etc.\n\n            end do next \n\n        end do pre \n\n    else:\n\n        similar.\n\nWait, probably the most direct translation is to loop over next (0-9) or the single value, then for each, loop over pre.\n\nHence:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n    loop:\n\n    ! Start with current character, and get next options\n\n    choose next loop variables.\n\n    if ( ch == ? ) then \n\n        do next =0,9\n\n          do pre = 0,12 \n\n            compute prev_count: if (i>0) dp(i-1, pre) else (1 if pre==0 else 0)\n\n            new_mod = mod(base * next + pre,13)\n\n            dp(i, new_mod) = dp(i, new_mod) + prev_count\n\n            dp(i, new_mod) = mod(dp(i, new_mod), MOD)\n\n          end do pre\n\n        end do next\n\n    else\n\n      next = (digit value)\n\n      do pre =0, 12 \n\n        prev_count = if (i>0) ... \n\n        ...\n\n        same code for new_mod and adding \n\n      end do \n\n    end if (ch is ?)\n\nBut wait, how to get prev_count?\n\nHmm. The prev_count depends on 'pre' and 'i'.\n\nThe max(0) thing. \n\nLet me code that.\n\nprev_count =0:\n\n if (i >0) then \n\n    prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n else\n\n    if (pre ==0 ) then \n\n        prev_count =1 \n\n    else \n\n        prev_count =0 \n\n    end if \n\n end if \n\nSo that would compute the previous count.\n\nThus, the code can handle that.\n\nBut in Fortran, to code this:\n\n prev_count = 0\n\n      if (i .gt. 0) then \n\n          prev_count = dp(i-1, pre)\n\n      else \n\n          if (pre .eq.0 ) then \n\n                prev_count =1 \n\n          else \n\n                prev_count =0 \n\n          end if \n\n      end if \n\nYes.\n\nHence the loops can be structured.\n\nNow, the problem here is that for the loops over next and pre, we loop pre first then next? or next first?\n\nLet me think again:\n\nIf it's ?, then for each of the 10 next values, we must loop through all pre, then for each next and each pre, compute the new_mod.\n\nSo yes, Next loop outer.\n\nThus, in code for the '? case:\n\ndo next =0,9\n\n    do pre =0,12\n\n        ... as above.\n\nend do twice.\n\nBut this would loop for each next (10), then 13 pre steps. So total 130 loops.\n\nAlternatively, maybe pre first, then next. But same number.\n\nEither way works.\n\nNow, putting all this into code.\n\nNow, for base.\n\nAfter each iteration of the outer loop (the i loop from 0 to n-1), we need to update base:\n\nbase = mod( base * 10, 13 )\n\nMod function here is mod(a,b). Since it's positive, but in fortran mod(a,b) is a - b*floor(a/b).\n\nSince base is always positive, and 10*base is positive, mod is okay.\n\nNow, putting this together:\n\nthe loops are:\n\ndo i=0, n-1  ! Process each character from the string (starting from the end of original string)\n\n    ch = s( n -i :  )\n\nWait, in Fortran, s is a character array:\n\nso s is like a 1-based string. The current character is at position n -i, because when i=0, it's s(n) (the last character in original string). yes.\n\nThe substring is s(n-i : n-i) gives a single character.\n\n    if ( ch == '?' ) then \n\n        do next =0,9\n\n            do pre=0,12\n\n                prev_count =0\n\n                if (i>0) then \n\n                    prev_count = dp( i-1, pre )\n\n                else \n\n                    if (pre ==0 ) then \n\n                        prev_count =1 \n\n                    else \n\n                        prev_count =0 \n\n                    end if \n\n                end if \n\n                new_mod = mod( base * next + pre , 13 )\n\n                dp( i, new_mod ) = dp(i, new_mod ) + prev_count \n\n                ! now mod it by MOD \n\n                dp( i, new_mod ) = mod( dp(i, new_mod ), MOD )\n\n            end do pre \n\n        end do next \n\n    else \n\n        digit = ichar( ch ) - ichar( '0' ) \n\n        do pre =0,12 \n\n            prev_count =0 \n\n            if (i>0) then \n\n                prev_count = dp( i-1, pre )\n\n            else \n\n                if (pre ==0 ) then \n\n                    prev_count =1 \n\n                else \n\n                    prev_count =0 \n\n                end if \n\n            end if \n\n            new_mod = mod( base * digit + pre,13 )\n\n            dp( i, new_mod ) = dp( i, new_mod ) + prev_count \n\n            dp( i, new_mod ) = mod( dp(i, new_mod ), MOD )\n\n        end do \n\n    end if \n\n    ! Update base after the iteration \n\n    base = mod( base *10, 13 )\n\nend do \n\nYes. \n\nWait but this way has a problem. The loops over pre and next in the case of '? are such that for each next, and each pre, then new_mod is computed, and then the dp arrays are being accumulated. \n\nHowever, in this code fragment, since for each next and pre, we are calculating the new_mod and adding to DP(i,new_mod). \n\nWait, but this is okay, because for each dp, you are adding all possible contributions from all next digits. But each next digit is leading to different pre calculations. \n\nWait, but the code is correct as written? Let me think through: \n\nFor example, for each next digit (0-9):\n\nFor each pre value (0-12):\n\n    the previous count is either from dp[i-1][pre] or the base case.\n\n    So the new_mod for that combination is for that path (pre + next).\n\n    In the next loop, we are adding up across all next digits and all-prev. \n\nThus all the transitions are considered.\n\nSo this should work. \n\nHowever, this approach loops over all next digits and pre's each time, which for next in 0..9 and pre 0..12 would be 10*13 steps per character. Since the input may be large (up to 1e5 characters), this would be 1.3e6 operations per character, which may not be efficient enough. \n\nWait but in the code as written in Java, it also is doing the same thing, so if the problem allows, and the constraints are manageable (since the loops are O(n) time, with O(1) per iteration?), perhaps it's fine. \n\nWait, but for n up to say 1e5 characters:\n\nEach character requires loops of 195 steps (for ? case). So for 1e5 characters, that's 1.95e7 steps? Which may be okay in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way. \n\nBut for the problem, the code needs to be translated as it is, unless the user specifies optimization. \n\nThus, proceeding.\n\nThe final step is outputting dp(n-1][5] in Java (since 5 is the required mod value). Wait:\n\nWait in Java, the dp is for i from 0 to (cs.length-1) which in fortran is n-1 (since n is the length). \n\nSo the final answer is dp( n-1, 5 ), and we need to print that mod MOD? Wait the problem states the answer mod 1e9+7, which is what the code enforces in every step. Therefore, yes.\n\nHence:\n\nprint *, dp(n-1,5 )\n\nWait but the DP in fortran is dimmed as (0:n-1,0:12).\n\nThus, after all steps, at the end, just write:\n\nprint *, dp( n-1,5 )\n\nBut before exiting, deallocate? Hmm, we can just let the code run, but in Fortran it's better practice to deallocate:\n\ndeallocate( dp )\n\nOtherwise, might have allocation issues.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nNow code:\n\nprogram abc135_D\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer*8, parameter :: MOD = 1000000007\n    integer, parameter :: MAX_N = 200000  !

Only once for digit = current_char.\n\nSo, in the code above, the 'else' branch loops over all pre (0-12), and uses digit. That's correct.\n\nIn the ? case, the next runs from 0 to 9. For each next and pre.\n\nNow, the code inside the loops:\n\nThe 'base' variable is a integer*8 variable initialized to 1. The init is before the loop.\n\nWait in the Fortran code:\n\n1. Variables:\n\ninteger*8 :: base =1 \n\ninitialized outside the loop.\n\n2. After processing each i step, the base multiplies by 10 mod13. \n\n3. The 'base' is in effect before computing the transitions for i. \n\nYes, correct.\n\nTesting part: The dp, which each iteration is filling using the i-1 row (when i>0).\n\nThe 'merge' function in Fortran can be used for conditionals, instead of computed goes inside the 'if' for prev_count if possible.\n\nWait in the prev_count calculation:\n\nUsing merge function (1 if (pre==0), else 0):\n\nprev_count = merge(1_8, 0_8, pre ==0 )\n\nwhere 1_8 is integer*8, but the code will need to cast.\n\nAlternatively, to keep code portable, perhaps better to write separate if.\n\nWait in the code I wrote earlier:\n\nin the ? case loops:\n\ninside 'if(i==0)' then do merge(1,0, ... )\n\nWait in the first version of code above, I used:\n\nprev_count is of type integer*8.\n\nif (i==0): prev_count = 1 if pre ==0 else 0.\n\nsince prev_count is integer*8, the 1 becomes integer*8.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for the code:\n\nWe need to compute correctly:\n\nThe initial step (i=0):\n\nbase=1.\n\nfor current_char, whichever it is (suppose it's a '?'):\n\nthen for each next digit (0 to 9), and for each pre (0 to12):\n\nprev_count is 1 only when pre ==0 (for i=0)\n\nthen new_mod is (1* next + 0) mod13 (since pre is the previous mod, which is pre).\n\nWait, no: for pre is 0 the prev_count is 1, and others are zero, so for the first iteration (i=0):\n\nonly pre=0 contributes.\n\nThus, for any pre:\n\nprev_count is 1 when pre is 0, else 0.\n\nThus, in the ? case:\n\nfor each next in 0-9:\n\nthen, for pre=0 (the only one contributing):\n\nprev_count =1.\n\nSo new_mod= (1*next + 0) mod13 \u2192 next mod13.\n\nThus, dp[i][next mod13] += 1.\n\nThus, after i=0 iteration, for each possible next digit (0-9), there is +1 in their mod value.\n\nThus, for example, next=5 (part of 0-9):\n\nmod is5 \u2192 dp[0][5] +=1.\n\nSo the count for mod5 would be 1, if next=5.\n\nWait but, the sum over all applicable next's: for digit 5, it will be 1 in mod5. The next=5 mod13 is 5.\n\nSo for a first character '?', there are 10 possibilities, so all mod values from 0-9 are incremented by1 (since next can go to 0-9; for next= 10 then mod(10) is 10)\n\nWait, for next=10 is not possible since next is up to 9.\n\nThus for first iteration, the DP[0][m] will be equal to the number of digits (0-9) that have mod (base*next mod13). Well not exactly, since 0-9 are next:\n\n1*next mod13 is just next, from 0 to9. So each digit contributes 1 to its own mod value. \n\nSo the first step with '?' will have for each mod0-9, count 1, and mod10-12 zero. \n\nSo yes, that would be correct.\n\nThus the code seems to compute this correctly.\n\nNow, code considerations:\n\n* The DP array is declared as integer(kind=8), since we are using large numbers modulo 1e9+7. \n\n* The initial allocation uses dp =0, but fortran's allocate already sets to zero (so the =0 is redundant, but safe).\n\n* The modulo operation in Fortran must be careful to handle negative numbers. For example, for base and next, adding pre and mod. But base is positive, next is up to 9, and pre is between 0-12. Multiplication (base*next can be negative? No, since base starts at 1 and multiplied by 10 mod13 which is positive. So mod( ... ) will be between 0-12. So no negative mods.\n\n* Each dp step's new value must be modded by MOD after adding via dp = mod(...). Since additions may exceed MOD, and we have to apply mod each time.\n\nWait in the code, the lines are:\n\ndp(...) = mod( dp(...) + prev_count, MOD )\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code given:\n\nWait in my code above, I used:\n\ninteger :: new_mod = mod( base * next + pre, 13)\n\nBut in this code, base is an integer*8. Multiplying with 'next' (integer) and adding pre (integer) will be okay in terms of integer size. The mod13 can be done with integer division.\n\nYes, since base could be as big as 1e(n) mod13, but mod13 won't produce anything outside of 0-12.\n\nWait but in fortran, integers are 4-byte by default. Wait variables next and pre are integers (so 4 bytes). The expression base * next is an integer*8 multiplied by integer 0-9 (4 bytes). The product is integer*8.\n\nThen adding pre (4 bytes to integer*8) \u2192 becoming integer*8, then mod (13) returns a modulo between 0-12.\n\nYes, that is okay.\n\nHence the new_mod variable can be integer (since result is 0-12).\n\nThus, that's okay.\n\nThus, the code should function correctly.\n\nFinal step: To present the complete Fortran code."
