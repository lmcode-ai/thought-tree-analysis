    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by looking through the Java code carefully. \n\nFirst, the Java code uses a Scanner to read inputs: VP, VD, T, F, C. Then there's some calculations based on these inputs. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem is from Codeforces 148 B, probably involves calculating some condition where a police must catch a drunk man. Wait, the main logic is the loop. Let me see the structure.\n\nFirst, check if VD <= VP. If so, print 0 and exit. Else proceed.\n\nThe main loop starts with 'start' initialized to T, then in the loop:\n\n- Compute x as start * VP / (VD - VP)\n- Check if (start + x)*VP >= C. If so, break the loop and output answer.\n- Otherwise, add 2x + F to start and increment answer each iteration.\n\nHmm. The key here is to translate this loop logic into Fortran correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about translating to Fortran. Let's consider the data types. In Java, all variables are declared with double, even though the inputs are integers, because they might do division leading to fractional values. However, in Fortran, variables are typed so need to ensure that variables are declared properly (probably as real numbers).\n\nSo first, the Fortran code would need to read five integers: VP, VD, T, F, C. Wait, in the Java code, even though they read with nextInt(), the variables are stored as doubles. So in Fortran, to mirror that, perhaps declare them as real*8 (double) to hold the values, even if they are input as integers. Wait, but in Fortran, when reading, the input can be read as real types even if they are provided as integers. So the variables might be declared as real variables.\n\nWait, the user's Java inputs are all read via in.nextInt(), so the inputs are integer values but stored as doubles in the Java code. So in Fortran, the variables can be read as integers first, but in code, they are used computationally as real (like with double in Java). Wait, but to make the Fortran code equivalent, we need to use real numbers in their calculations, not integers.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the variables should be declared as real variables (like real*8 for double precision). So code would have variables like vp, vd, t, f, c as real(8). The input stream would read integers, but the variables will be real.\n\nNow, the structure of the code:\n\nThe main block:\n\n1. Read the 5 inputs.\n2. If VD <= VP, then output 0.\n3. Else, initialize variables (start as T, answer as 0), loop until the break condition is met, then output answer.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop structure may be different. Let me think about the loop. The Java has a while(true) loop which breaks when the condition is met. In Fortran, one can use a do loop with a loop counter, but since it's an indefinite loop, perhaps a do while loop where we can exit when needed.\n\nAlternatively, a do loop with a condition check inside.\n\nPseudocode for the loop:\n\nstart = T  \nset answer = 0  \nloop until the condition holds:  \n    compute x = start * VP / (VD - VP)  \n    if ( (start + x) * VP >= C ) : break, so exit the loop  \n    else: start += 2*x + F, increment answer by 1  \n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using a_DO loop without specifying an end, similar to a while loop. The construct can be:\n\nDO  \n   ... compute calculations ...  \n   if (condition) exit  \n   ... else ...  \n   some code here  \n   ... endif  \nENDDO  \n\nWait, yes, in Fortran you can use the EXIT statement to break out of a do loop.\n\nSo the steps for the loop:\n\nInside the IF ( THEN-ELSE, since VD>VP):\n\ninitialize start = T (real from the input)\n\nanswer = 0\n\nthen DO loop:\n\ncompute x = start * vp / (vd -vp)  \n\nthen check (start +x)*vp >= c: if yes, exit loop.\n\nElse: do the adding:\n\nstart = start + 2*x + f  \n\nanswer = answer +1  \n\nand repeat.\n\nSo the code can be written as a DO loop, exit when the condition is met.\n\nNow, let's think about the variables:\n\nFirst, in Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. Let me think of the declarations.\n\nreal(8) :: vp, vd, t_in, f, c\n\nWait, but in Java, the T is read as an int, which is assigned to T (a double). So in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nWe can first read the variables as integers, but then convert to real, but maybe it's better to read them as real. Since the input could be integers but in code we treat them as real numbers.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when using read *, variables, the input can contain integers and real numbers, so if the user inputs an integer, it's okay. Because the variables are declared as real, the read will convert them to real automatically.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if you have variables of type real, then when you read from the keyboard using read *, variables, the numbers input as integers will be converted to real. So the declarations:\n\nreal*8 :: VP, VD, T, F, C  \ninteger :: ans\n\nNote that answer is the variable 'answer' in java which is int, so it's declared as integer.\n\nWait in Java code, answer starts at 0 and increments each loop iteration. So in Fortran ans is an integer, yes.\n\nWait variables:\n\nAfter initialization, start is T, which is a real. So I think variables are:\n\nreal*8 :: VP, VD, T_val, F_val, C_val  \nreal*8 :: start, x\n\ninteger :: ans  \n\nWait, perhaps the variables can be:\n\nprogram codeforces_B  \n   implicit none  \n   real(8) :: VP, VD, T, F, C  \n   integer :: ans = 0  \n   real(8) :: start  \n   ...  \nend program codeforces_B  \n\nWait, the variables:\n\n- VP, VD, T, F, C: real(8)\n- ans is integer\n- in the loop, variables start and x.\n\nNow code steps:\n\nFirst read the inputs:\n\nread *, VP, VD, T, F, C  \n\nThen check if VD <= VP:\n\nIf that's true, print 0 and exit.\n\nElse, set start = T (initial value from input), ans =0, then enter loop.\n\nLet me write this step by step.\n\nThe code outline is:\n\nprogram codeforces_B  \n  implicit none  \n  real(8) :: VP, VD, T, F, C  \n  real(8) :: start, x  \n  integer :: ans  \n\n  ! Read input  \n  read *, VP, VD, T, F, C  \n\n  if (VD <= VP) then  \n    print *, 0  \n    stop  \n  end if  \n\n  ans = 0  \n  start = T  \n\n  do  \n    x = start * VP / (VD - VP)  \n\n    if ( (start + x) * VP >= C ) then  \n      exit  \n    end if  \n\n    start = start + 2.0d0 * x + F  \n    ans = ans + 1  \n  end do  \n\n  print *, ans  \n\nend program codeforces_B  \n\nWait, let me check the loop logic.\n\nWait in the Java code, the while loop was written as while(true), breaking when condition.\n\nIn Fortran, the loop will repeat until the exit, exactly like the Java's structure.\n\nSo the code is translated correctly.\n\nNow, checking for possible issues:\n\n1. The division and multiplication are done in real variables. So since Fortran uses real arithmetic, there are no integer division issues here.\n\n2. The \"2*\" in the code: in Fortran, to compute 2*x, 2 needs to be a real number. Writing 2.0d0 ensures it's treated as double. But actually, in the equation \"start += 2*x + F\", the 2 is a scalar multiplied by x, which is real. So in Fortran, 2 is an integer, but since it's multiplied by a real number, the compiler will automatically convert, but to be precise, maybe better to write 2.0d0 *x or just 2*x. The code as written uses 2*x (as in 2.0d0?) Well, in code above, it's written start = start + 2*x + f_val? Let me recheck.\n\nWait in the Fortran code I proposed above, the line:\n\nstart = start + 2.0d0 * x + F  \n\nWait, no, in the Java code's line is start += 2*x + F. So 2*x is 2 (an integer) multiplied by x (real). So in Fortran, that is 2.0d0*x? Since in Fortran 2 is integer, but when multiplied by real variable x (real*8), it's okay, but to make it explicit, perhaps using 2.0d0 is better. Alternatively, 2 is acceptable. Well, the compiler should handle either. Let me stick to using 2.0_dp where dp is a kind parameter, but in the code above, the code uses real*8 which is double precision. So using integers multiplied by real numbers is okay, but perhaps writing 2.0 for better precision, but since variables are declared as real(8), perhaps 2.0d0 is better. \n\nWait, but in the code I wrote, I used 2.0d0 *x. Is this needed?\n\nWait in the code above, I wrote:\n\nstart = start + 2*x + F  \n\nWait in the Java code, the code is written as \n\nstart += 2 *x + F;\n\nWhich in C-like terms is same as:\n\nstart = start + 2 * x + F;\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nstart = start + 2*x + F \n\nThe 2 is an integer, but when multiplied by a real number (x is real(8)), the 2 is upconverted to real*4? No, because in Fortran, arithmetic operations with a mix of real and integers results in conversions. Since x is real*8, 2 will be converted to the appropriate kind.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, if you have an int multiplied with real(8), the result will be real(8) (since that is the higher precision). So to prevent any potential issues, it's better to have 2.0 as a real*e. But in that case, since variables are real(8), using 2.0d0 may be better.\n\nWait, real*8 is double precision. The literals can be written as, for example 2.0, but if need kind=8, then writing 2.0d0 would make it double. \n\nSo maybe better to use 2.0d0 * x instead of 2 *x.\n\nWait let me see in code:\n\nThe code I wrote earlier used start = start + 2*x + F. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nstart = start + 2.0d0 * x + F\n\nThe 'F' variable is part of the variables which are real*8, so F is already a double.\n\nAlternatively, since 2 is integer, but when multiplied by x (real*8), the result is real*8.\n\nYes, but to ensure that this is clearly treated as real, perhaps better to write 2.d0*x.\n\nThus, in the code, maybe I can use 2.0d0 *x.\n\nI think that would be better.\n\nSimilarly, the initial value of 'start' comes from T (real(8)), so that's fine.\n\nNow, checking variable names:\n\nIn Java, variables are VP, VD, T, etc. In the Fortran code, I can use the same names: VP, VD, T, F, C, as they are all allowed as variable names.\n\nThe 'start' variable is a real*8. \n\nThe variable 'ans' is an integer, which is different from the Java variable 'answer'.\n\nAlmost.\n\nNow for the output:\n\nIn the Java code, the code after the loop does:\n\nSystem.out.println(answer);\n\nIn Fortran, that's print *, ans.\n\nNow, test cases. Let me think of test cases where code might be different.\n\nSuppose if T is 5, but in Java it is a double but stored as an input from an integer.\n\nIn Fortran, since it's stored as a real, it should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: the condition in the Java code:\n\nif ((start + x) * VP >= C) break;\n\nIn Fortran, that's written as:\n\nif( (start + x)*VP >= c ) then; exit; end if.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible mistake: division of two real numbers. The denominator is (VD - VP). VD>VP as per the initial if condition (since otherwise the code would have exited with 0), so no division by zero.\n\nWait: the VD > VP is ensured by the initial if (VD <= VP), so VD minus VP is positive. So that's okay.\n\nNow, is anything else? Let's see:\n\nThe code loops until the (start + x) * VP >= C. \n\nIn Java, the variables VP,VD,T,F,C are doubles (in Java stored as double).\n\nFortran variables are real(8), so same.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the loop count?\n\nThe Java code's answer is an int, so in Fortran ans is integer which is correct.\n\nI think the code should work.\n\nMaybe another test case.\n\nLet's see if in Java when VP=5, VD=10, T=5, F=10, C=50.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, VD =10>VP, so not the initial case.\n\nstart = T =5.\n\nIteration 1:\n\nx=5*(5)/(10-5) =5*5/5=5.\n\nSo x is 5.\n\nCheck if (start +x)*VP >= C ?\n\n(5+5)*5 =10*5=50 >=50. So yes. So break, and ans=0.\n\nSo the output is 0.\n\nWait but in that case, answer's initial value is 0, and since the condition is met immediately, the code would print 0, which is correct.\n\nWait in the code, the loop would compute x, check the condition and exit immediately, so ans is 0. The output would be 0, correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nTake VP=3, VD=5, T=1, F=1, C=10.\n\nThe first step:\n\nstart=1.0\n\nx =1*(3)/(5-3) = 3/2 =1.5\n\nCheck (1+1.5)*3 =2.5 *3 =7.5 < 10? So condition not met.\n\nSo update:\n\nstart becomes 1 + 2*(1.5) +1 = 1 +3 +1=5.\n\nans becomes 1.\n\nSecond loop iteration:\n\nstart is 5. compute x: 5 *3/(5-3)=5*3/2 =7.5.\n\nthen compute start + x is 5+7.5 =12.5. 12.5 *3 =37.5 >=10? Yes. So the loop breaks.\n\nThus ans remains 1.\n\nSo the code will output 1. Let's see in Fortran.\n\nIn the code:\n\nstart =5 (after 1 iteration) and in next loop:\n\nthe condition is met, so ans is 1, which is correct.\n\nThus, code's logic is preserved.\n\nAnother test where multiple iterations are needed:\n\nSuppose VP=2, VD=4, T=2, F=2, C= 20.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nstart is 2.\n\nx = 2*(2)/(4-2)=2*2/2 =2.\n\nCheck (2+2)*2 =4*2=8 <20 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen update:\n\nstart += 2*2 (x is 2) +2 (F). 2 +4+2=8 \u2192 new start is 8. ans becomes 1.\n\nNext iteration: start is 8.\n\nx =8*2/(4-2)= 16/2=8.\n\nCheck (8+8)*2 = 16*2=32 >=20 \u2192 yes. Exit loop. thus ans is 1. So output 1. Which is correct.\n\nWait. Wait in the second iteration, after increment:\n\nWait, first iteration:\n\ninitial start is 2, computes x= (2 *2)/(4-2)=2. So start+x is 2+2=4. 4*2=8 <20 \u2192 yes.\n\nThen, new start becomes 2+2*2 +2 \u2192 2+4 +2 = 8? Wait:\n\nWait in code:\n\nstart = start + 2*x + F \u2192 2 + 2*(2) +2 \u2192 2+4+2 = 8. So that's correct.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nstart is now 8. x is =8*2/(4-2) =16/2=8. So start+x is 8+8=16. 16*2=32 >=20 \u2192 yes. So condition is met and the loop exits with ans=1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo, looks like code is translated correctly.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Floating point precision? Since in Fortran, variables are real*8, which is double precision, so same as Java's double, which is okay.\n\n- Variable types: In Fortran, the reads would work because variables are real, even if input are integers. For example, the code reads \"5\" which is integer as a real. That's okay.\n\nThus the translated code should be correct as per above structure.\n\nFinal code:\n\nNow, writing it step by step:\n\nThe program must start with a program block, declare variables, read inputs, process, and write to output.\n\nProgram codeforces_148_B\n\nWait, but the Fortran program name can be any, but in the code, likely using codeforces_148_B as in Java but with adjustments.\n\nWait in code, the Java class is named \"codeforces_148_B\", but Fortran programs use program blocks. So perhaps the Fortran program can be named similarly:\n\nprogram codeforces_148_B  \nimplicit none  \n! variables declarations  \nreal*8 :: VP, VD, T, F, C  \nreal*8 :: start, x  \ninteger :: ans = 0  \n\n! Read the inputs  \nread*, VP, VD, T, F, C  \n\n! Check VD <= VP first  \nif (VD <= VP) then  \n   print*, 0  \n   stop  \nend if  \n\nstart = T  \nans =0  \n\nDO  \n   x = start * VP / (VD - VP)  \n   if ( (start + x)*VP >= C ) exit  \n   start = start + 2.0d0*x + F  \n   ans = ans +1  \nend do  \n\nprint*, ans  \n\nend program  \n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nWait, in the declare:\n\nShould variables be declared first before their use?\n\nYes, in Fortran the variable declarations must be before any executable statements.\n\nSo the code should have all the variables declared first.\n\nIn the program, all variables are declared in the list after IMPLICIT NONE.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, that code should be correct."
