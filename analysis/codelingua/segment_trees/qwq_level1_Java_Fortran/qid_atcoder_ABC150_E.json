Wait for i =n+1: Java code: n+1 -i \u2192 n+1 - (n+1) =0 \u2192 c[0]. In Fortran, that's c(1). So Fortran's index is exactly the same as the Java's index. Because in Java it's 0-based, but the code in the Java is: the result of n+1 -i can be from when i = 2 \u2192 n+1 -2 (down to i =n+1 gives 0). So the indices go from n-1 down to 0 in java.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by reading through the Java code to understand what it does. \n\nThe code starts by reading input from the user. It reads two lines: the first line is the number n, and the second line has n integers which are stored in an array c. Then, if n is 1, it outputs 2 * c[0] mod 1e9+7 and exits. \n\nOtherwise, it sorts the array c in parallel (but in Fortran, maybe just a regular sort is okay). Then it calculates two exponents: b is 2^n mod mod, and a is 2^(n-2) mod mod. \n\nThe loop starts at i=2 up to n+1, and for each i computes a term val which is multiplied by c[n+1 - i] (which seems like accessing the elements in reverse order?), then accumulates these terms into ans. Finally, ans is multiplied by b, modded again, and printed.\n\nThe pow function uses exponentiation by squaring with mod 1e9+7.\n\nHmm, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps required.\n\nFirst, I/O in Fortran: need to read the input lines. Since Java uses BufferedReader, in Fortran we can open the input as a unit and read lines. \n\nThe first step is to read n from the first line. Then read the next line's integers into an array. Then check if n is 1. \n\nThen sort the array. In Fortran, you can use the `sort` function from the iso_fortran_env module or use a custom sort. To be efficient maybe use qsort? Or just use the built-in sort.\n\nThe next part is the power function. Fortran doesn't have a built-in exponent function with mod, so we'll have to write it similar to the power function in Java. Note that the power in Fortran may require integers or real numbers? Wait, the Java code uses long for all operations, so in Fortran, integers can go up to 1e9+7 but with power of 2^n, which can be big even for modulus. So using integers with mod.\n\nThe main loop: loop i from 2 to n+1, but in Fortran loops start with the start value and end, note that in the Java code, the loop is from 2 to n+1 inclusive, so in Fortran: do i=2, n+1.\n\nAnother point: in the loop, the current i is used to compute a term which involves multiplying a (the power) by i. Then multiply by c[n+1 - i]? Let's see: in Java, c's index goes from 0 to n-1. So n+1 - i would be n+1 - i which for i=2 would give n-1, so the last element. For i= n+1, that would be n+1 - (n+1)=0, so c[0]. So the loop is iterating from the end of the array in reverse. So the array is sorted in increasing order, and the loop traverses the array's elements from the largest to the smallest? Because after sorting, perhaps?\n\nWait, the code in Java uses Arrays.parallelSort, so the array is sorted in ascending order, then when in the loop, for each i, c[n+1 -i], where n+1 -i starts at n-1 (since when i starts at 2, it's n - (2 - (n+1 -i? Wait, wait: the array elements are 0-based. Suppose n is 3. The first iteration i=2: n+1 -i is 3+1-2 = 2. So c[2] which is the third (zero-based) element. That's the third element of the array. Because the array was sorted in ascending order, this would be the largest. Wait, when sorted in ascending order, c[0] is the smallest, so c[n-1] is largest. So for i=2 to n+1, the indices would be from n-1 (i=2) down to 0 (i=n+1). So that loop is accessing the elements from largest to smallest. \n\nWhich means that when computing the terms, each term is a[i] * (the ith term in descending order?), maybe the sum is over some permutation of those elements multiplied by coefficients. \n\nNow, translating into Fortran: \n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Java, the code uses mod 1e9+7. So in Fortran, need to set mod = 1000000007.\n\nFirst, variables: we can have variables n as integer, array c as integer array. Also in Fortran, all variables need to be declared before code starts. So perhaps place at the top.\n\nReading the input:\n\nFirst line: the first integer n. The second line has n numbers.\n\nFortran code structure: perhaps:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_E\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, mod = 1000000007\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: c\n\n! read n\nread(*,*)n\n! allocate the array to size n\nallocate(c(n))\n! next read n integers\nread(*,*)(c(i), i=1,n)\n! proceed... \n\nBut wait, in Java, the second line is read as a line split into strings. In Fortran, when using list-directed input (blank-separated), a read (*,*) will read all the numbers from that line, so this should be okay.\n\nNow, check if n ==1: then the result is c(1)*2 mod mod. Because in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default unless using the index is set to 0. \n\nWait, in the code above, if I declare c as integer array with dimension(1:n), then the elements are c(1) to c(n). So if in Java it's 0-based (like c[0] to c[n-1]), then in Fortran, when converting, the first element in Java (c[0]) is c(1) in Fortran here. Hmm, so need to be careful here.\n\nWait, no, in the code above, in Java, after reading the second line's elements into c[i], for i from 0 to n-1. So the elements in Java are stored from index 0. So in the Fortran array, which is 1-based, the first element (Java's c[0]) becomes c(1) in Fortran. \n\nTherefore when porting the code, we need to adjust the indices accordingly. \n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter reading c, but when the code in Java does Arrays.parallelSort(c); which is an in-place sort in ascending order. The corresponding in Fortran is:\n\ncall merge_sort(c) (if using a sorting routine, or there's an intrinsic function. In Fortran 90, perhaps use the intrinsic sort function:\n\ncall sort(c) ? Wait, the sort function may sort in ascending order. Let's see.\n\nYes, in Fortran 90's intrinsic sort is ascending order. So:\n\ncall sort(c, mask=.true.)\n\nWait, no: The correct syntax is call merge_sort, but for intrinsic function, the syntax is:\n\ncall sort(array) or some such. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe Fortran intrinsic function to sort an array is present in F2008 standard with the 'sort' and 'merge_sort' subroutines. Assuming that the user's compiler supports that.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ncall sort(c)\n\nSo the array c will be sorted in ascending order. So in the Java code after parallelSort, the array is sorted in ascending, which is same as Fortran's sort.\n\nThen the next step: calculating a = 2^(n-2) mod mod, and b = 2^n mod mod.\n\nThen the loop over i from 2 to n+1 inclusive.\n\nWait, in Fortran, loops can be written as:\n\ndo var = first, last, step\n\nHere, first is 2, last is n+1, step is 1 (default). So:\n\ndo i = 2, n+1\n\nInside the loop, in the Java code:\n\nval = a * i % mod;\n\nBut in Fortran, modulo operations can be tricky with negative numbers, but here everything is positive, so okay.\n\nWait, but in Java, it's (a * i mod mod) then multiply by c[ n+1 -i ]\n\nWait, let's parse the expression:\n\nval = a * i % mod;\n\nval *= c[n+1-i];\n\nval %= mod;\n\nSo the sequence is first multiply a * i mod mod, then multiply by the value of c[n+1 -i], again mod mod.\n\nIn Fortran, mod(a*b, mod) would be needed. So:\n\nval = ( (a * i) ) mod mod\n\nval = (val * c(...) ) mod mod\n\nSo in Fortran code, perhaps:\n\nval = mod(a * i, mod)\n\nval = mod( val * c(n+1 -i) , mod )\n\nBut wait, in the indices in Fortran: in java, c[i] is the index, in Fortran, since the array is 1-based, and after sorting, the elements in java are accessed in reverse (from n, down to 1?)\n\nWait, the expression n+1 -i: in Java, when the array is c[0] to c[n-1], then for a Java array, (n+1 -i) would not even make sense if i can get to n+1 (e.g. when n is 3, then n+1 is 4, so if i=4, then Java would have 4-2= n+1 -i = 4-2? Wait, sorry let's do the example with n=3. \n\nSuppose in the loop in Java:\n\nLoop variable is i from 2 to 4 (since n+1 when n=3 is 4). The term c[n+1 -i], so when i=2:\n\nn+1-i is 3+1-2=2. c[2] in Java is the third element, since array is 0-based. \n\nIn Fortran:\n\nAfter sorting, the array is c(1), c(2), c(3), asc order. So the indices in Fortran are 1 to n, so c(3) would correspond to the original c[2].\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the equivalent index for Java's c[n+1 -i] (when i runs from 2 to n+1) would be (n+1 - i). Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me describe:\n\nJava's expression:\n\njava_c_idx = n+1 - i -1 ?\n\nWait because in Java it's 0-based.\n\nWait the Java's array c has elements c[0] to c[n-1].\n\nIn the code, c[n+1 -i] where in the FOR loop, i runs from 2 up to n+1.\n\nWait, when i=2:\n\njava index is n+1 -i = n+1-2 = (n-1) since the minus 2. Wait no. (n+1 -i). Suppose n is say 3, then n+1 is 4. So when i=2 \u2192 4-2=2 \u2192 so c[2], which is the third element (0-based), correct.\n\nSo the Fortran array is 1-based. So for the same element c[n-1 in Java], Fortran has c(n).\n\nTherefore, the equivalent index is (n+1 -i). Because in Java's 0-based:\n\nc[n+1 -i] \u2192 but since n+1 -i gives a value between (since i starts at 2, up to n+1):\n\nThe maximum i is n+1 \u2192 so n+1-i =0 \u2192 which is c[0] in Java.\n\nWait for i =n+1: Java code: n+1 -i \u2192 n+1 - (n+1) =0 \u2192 c[0]. In Fortran, that's c(1).\n\nSo Fortran's index is exactly the same as the Java's index. Because in Java it's 0-based, but the code in the Java is: the result of n+1 -i can be from when i = 2 \u2192 n+1 -2 (down to i =n+1 gives 0). So the indices go from n-1 down to 0 in java.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the corresponding index would be (n +1 -i) +1 formula? No, wait. Let me see.\n\nThe value (n+1 -i) is the java's index. Since in Fortran, that's stored as (n+1 -i +1) ?\n\nWait the original Java's 0-based array (JavaC) and Fortran's 1-based array (FortC):\n\nfortC(j) = JavaC[j-1]\n\nTherefore, if the java index is K, then in Fortran, the element is fortC(K+1).\n\nWait, no, K is Java's index (0 to n-1). So in Fortran, it's K + 1.\n\nSo Java's c[K] is Fortran's c(K+1).\n\nWait, maybe an example helps: Java has c[0], c[1], c[2]. (3 elements, n=3)\n\nFortran's array is c(1) to c(3).\n\nThus, to get the same element as Java's c[0], it's Fortran c(1).\n\nTherefore, Java's c[K] is at Fortran's c(K+1)?\n\nNo, wait that's not. Correct: Fortran's c(1) corresponds to Java's c[0].\n\nTherefore, the Java index K maps to Fortran K +1? No, wait, Java's 0\u21921, 1\u21922, etc.\n\nThus, the index in Fortran for the same element is (Java index) +1.\n\nTherefore, the expression in Java:\n\nc[ (n+1 -i) ]\n\ntranslates to Fortran as c( (n+1 -i) +1 )? No, (n+1 -i) is the Java's index K. So in Fortran, that would be c(K+1) \u2192 c( (n+1 -i) +1 ) = c(n +2 -i)?\n\nWait, let's compute for an example. Take n=3 and i=2:\n\nJava index K: n+1 -i =4-2=2 \u2192 c[2] \u2192 which is element number 3 (0-based).\n\nIn Fortran, that is stored as c(3).\n\nThe formula (Java index +1) gives 2+1=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the Fortran equivalent is c( K +1 ) where K is the Java's index. \n\nSo the Fortran expression is c( (n+1 -i) +1 ) \u2192 (n+1 -i +1) = n -i +2?\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait K =n+1 -i \u2192 Java index. So adding 1 gives K+1 = (n+1 -i) +1 = n -i +2? No, n+1 -i +1 = (n+2 -i). \n\nWait:\n\nJava index is K = (n+1 -i). So in Fortran's 1-based index, it's K +1 \u2192 (n+1 -i) +1 =n+2 -i.\n\nWait so that's (n+2 - i).\n\nHence the correct index in Fortran is (n+2 -i), but let me test with earlier example.\n\nExample: n=3 (Fortran array size 3), i=2 \u2192 K=3+1-2 =2 (Java index 2 \u2192 corresponds to Fortran 3 ).\n\nSo n+2 -i = 3+2-2= 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: i= n+1 =4 \u2192 K=3+1-4 =0, so Java index 0 \u2192 Fortran 1.\n\nn+2 -4= 3+2-4=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the expression in Fortran: c(n+2 - i).\n\nThus, in the loop, the term is:\n\nval = a * (i) mod mod\n\nval = val * c(n+2 -i) mod mod \n\nThen adding this to ans.\n\nWait, but variables in the loop. So we have to declare ans as a long variable, perhaps as integer(8). \n\nVariables in Fortran must be declared. So first, variables in the main code:\n\ninteger :: mod = 1000000007\n\ninteger, dimension (n) :: c\n\ninteger (8 ) :: a, b, ans, val\n\nWait, but the loop variables can be declared as integer.\n\nWait, the code in java:\n\nlong a = power(2, n-2);\n\nlong b = power(2, n);\n\nans starts at 0.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe need integers of 8 bytes (64-bit) perhaps to handle the large exponents. So using integer*8 or in Fortran terms, kind=8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe kind=8 is better. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the power function is implemented as the power function. So we can define a function power similar to the one in Java.\n\nWait, the Java code has a power function with parameters x and n. But in Java, the power function returns a long. \n\nIn Fortran, we can create a function power that takes integers (x and exponent) and returns an integer also. \n\nAlternatively, in the main code, we can call this function.\n\nFunction power in Fortran:\n\nRecursive function power(x, n) result(res)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: x, n\n\ninteger(8) :: res, mod_val\n\nmod_val = 1000000007 \n\nif (n ==0 ) then res =1\n\nelse if (mod(n,2) ==0) then ...\n\nWait, similar logic as in Java.\n\nAlternatively, non-recursive version.\n\nSo, here's how the power function would be written in Fortran:\n\nFUNCTION powmod(x, n) result(res)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: x, n\n\ninteger(8) :: res\n\ninteger(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\ninteger(8) :: temp\n\nif (n ==0) then \n\n    res = 1\n\n    return\n\nendif\n\ntemp = powmod(x, n/2)\n\nres = mod( temp * temp, mod_val )\n\nif (mod(n,2) == 1) then \n\n    res = mod( res * x, mod_val )\n\nendif\n\nend function \n\nWait but this is recursive. But for exponentials, the recursive could have issues with big exponents, but since it halves each time, even for very big n like 1e5, it's okay (log2( n) is manageable).\n\nAlternatively, a non-recursive version:\n\nFUNCTION powmod(x, n) result(res)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger(8), intent(in) :: x, n\n\ninteger(8) :: res\n\ninteger(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\ninteger(8) :: val = 1\n\ninteger(8) :: pow = x\n\ninteger :: bit\n\ndo bit = 0 to ceil( log2(n) ) ... Well, alternatively, iterative way:\n\nres =1\n\ndo while (n >0 )\n\n   if (mod(n,2) ==1) then \n\n      res = mod( res * pow, mod_val)\n\n   end if \n\n   pow = mod( pow * pow, mod_val )\n\n   n = n /2\n\nend do \n\nWait no, that's the standard iterative exponent by squaring.\n\nHmm. Well, in any case, perhaps writing the recursive one first.\n\nLet me outline all variables.\n\nNow, the main program structure.\n\nFull outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_E\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger(8) :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\ninteger, allocatable :: c(:)\n\ninteger(8) :: a, b, ans, val\n\nread(*,*) n \n\nallocate(c(n))\n\nread(*,*) (c(i), i=1, n)\n\nif (n ==1) then \n\n    print *, mod( c(1)*2 , mod_val )\n\n    stop \n\nend if \n\ncall sort(c) --> or some sorting? \n\nWait, but wait, in Fortran 2003, perhaps the sort is intrinsic.\n\nassume that.\n\ncall sort(c)\n\ncompute a: a = powmod(2, n-2)\n\nb = powmod(2, n)\n\nans =0\n\ndo i = 2, n+1 \n\n    val = mod( a * i, mod_val )\n\n    val = mod( val * c(n+2 -i ), mod_val )\n\n    ans = mod( ans + val, mod_val )\n\nend do \n\nans = mod( ans * b, mod_val )\n\nprint *, ans \n\nend program \n\nWait, but need to define the powmod function.\n\nThus, the code would look like this.\n\nWait but Fortran is case-insensitive, but in code, the functions must be declared.\n\nSo putting the powmod function after the end program? Or in a module. Alternatively, the function powmod can be an internal function or external.\n\nAlternatively, here is the full code:\n\nFunction powmod is defined first. Let me write accordingly.\n\nWait the function has to be outside the main program or inside.\n\nLet me structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_E\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: mod_val = 1000000007\n\ninteger, allocatable :: c(:)\n\ninteger(8) :: a, b, ans, val, i\n\ninteger(8) :: powmod\n\n! Read n\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(c(n))\n\nread(*,*) (c(1:n)) ! perhaps read as vector ?\n\n! Check if n ==1\n\nif (n ==1) then \n\n    print*, mod( c(1)*2, mod_val ) \n\n    stop \n\nend if \n\n! Sort the array\n\ncall sort(c)\n\n! Compute a and b\n\na = powmod(2, n-2)\n\nb = powmod(2, n)\n\nans = 0_8\n\ndo i = 2, n+1 \n\n    val = mod( a * i, mod_val )\n\n    val = mod( val * c(n+2 -i), mod_val )\n\n    ans = mod( ans + val, mod_val )\n\nend do \n\nans = mod(ans * b, mod_val )\n\nprint*, ans\n\ncontains \n\nFUNCTION powmod(x, n) RESULT(res)\n\nINTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: x, n\n\nINTEGER(8) :: res, mod_val\n\nmod_val = 1000000007\n\nIF (n == 0) THEN \n\n    res = 1 \n\n    RETURN \n\nELSE \n\n    IF (MOD(n,2) ==0) THEN \n\n        res = powmod(x, n/2 )\n\n        res = MOD(res *res, mod_val )\n\n    ELSE \n\n        res = powmod(x, (n-1)/2 )\n\n        res = MOD( res * res * x, mod_val )\n\n    END IF \n\nEND IF \n\nRETURN \n\nEND FUNCTION powmod \n\nend program \n\nWait, but the powmod function may use recursion. For large exponents, but with log2(n) depth, since each call halves n. So for n up to say 1e5, log2(1e5) is around 17, so okay. (the maximum n can be in the problem? Not sure but maybe okay.)\n\nAlternatively, to make the powmod function iterative.\n\nLet me code the powmod function as iterative:\n\nFUNCTION powmod(x, n) RESULT(res)\n\nINTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: x, n\n\nINTEGER(8) :: res, mod_val, base, exponent\n\nmod_val = 1000000007\n\nres = 1 \n\nbase = x \n\nexponent = n \n\nDO WHILE (exponent >0)\n\n    IF (MOD(exponent,2) ==1) then \n\n        res = MOD( res * base, mod_val )\n\n    end if \n\n    base = MOD( base * base, mod_val )\n\n    exponent = exponent /2 \n\nend do \n\nRETURN \n\nEND FUNCTION \n\nWait, this would also work.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the iterative approach to avoid stack overflow for very large exponents. So the powmod function can be written iteratively.\n\nSo replacing the recursive power function with this iterative one.\n\nNow, checking indices again.\n\nIn the loop:\n\ni runs from 2 to n+1. \n\nIn each iteration, c(n+2 -i).\n\nexample with n=3, i=2 gives c(3+2-2=3) which is the maximum element (correct)\n\ni=4 (max i=3+1) gives n+2 -i = 3+2-4=1 \u2192 c(1), which is first element (minimum in sorted array). correct.\n\nThus this is correct.\n\nAnother check: when n is 2:\n\nSay n=2, the loop runs for i from 2 to 3.\n\nFor i=2: n+2 -i =2+2-2=2 \u2192 c(2) (max element)\n\nFor i=3: n+2 -3 =1 \u2192 c(1) (min). So it loops over maximum to minimum, multiplied by i terms (2 and 3? in that case, for n=2, variables would proceed accordingly).\n\nNow, what about the initial accumulation:\n\nInitially ans is zero.\n\nEach val is added into ans. Then modded.\n\nFinally ans = ans * b mod mod_val \n\nYes.\n\nSo I think the code structure is correct.\n\nNow, let's look at possible edge cases.\n\nWait, in the code for when n is 1, the output is (C(1) *2 mod mod_val). The code after reading n=1 and the array of size 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the a and b calculation:\n\na=powmod(2, n-2)\n\nb=powmod(2, n)\n\nThus, in Java, for n=1, the code after the return. \n\nLet me test n=2 case with an example:\n\nSuppose input: n=2, c has 1 and 2.\n\nSorted array is [1,2] (Java) or in Fortran [1,2].\n\nThen a= pow(2, 0)=1.\n\nb=pow(2,2)=4.\n\nThe loop runs for i=2 and 3.\n\ni=2:\n\nval = (1)*2 mod 1e9+7 \u2192 2.\n\nMultiply by c(2+2-2)=c(2) (the 2 in the array). So 2*2=4.\n\nval =4 mod mod.\n\ni=3 \u2192 c(2+2 -3)=c(1) \u21921. \n\nval = (1 *3)*1 \u21923 \u2192 mod.\n\nThus ans =4 +3 =7 mod mod.\n\n multiplied by b (4 \u2192 total 28 mod mod. Thus output is 28. \n\nLet me see what the java code would produce.\n\nJava code:\n\nfor n=2:\n\nc[0]=1, c[1]=2 (sorted as [1,2].)\n\nloop i from 2 to 3:\n\ni=2:\n\nval =a *i: a is 2^(2-2) =1 \u21921*2=2 mod \u21922.\n\nmult by c[ (2+1) -i \u21923? n+1 is 3, so for n=2, i=2:\n\n(2+1 -2) =1 \u2192c[1] (0-based) which is 2 \u2192 2 *2=4 mod.\n\nthen i=3:\n\na *i \u2192 1*3 =3 mod \u2192 multiplied by c[ (3-3) \u21920 \u2192 c[0] (1) \u2192 3*1=3 mod.\n\ntotal ans=4+3=7 mod. Then multiply by 4 \u21927 *4=28 \u2192 so same as above, so code should get 28. \n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, when c = [5]. Output is 2*5=10 mod mod_val \u219210.\n\nSo in Fortran, if n=1, read the first element, then do 2*1 mod \u2192 yes.\n\nNow, the array in Fortran: read n=1. alloc array (size 1). Read the number, say 5 \u2192c(1)=5. So correct.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nNow, check if in Fortran the powmod function is correctly returning exponents mod mod_val.\n\nTesting powmod(2,10):\n\nThe function, with x=2, exponent =10.\n\nInitial res is 1.\n\nLoop:\n\nexponent=10 is even?\n\nYes.\n\nbase is 2.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nexponent is 10 \u2192even.\n\ncheck exponent modulo 2 is 0.\n\nso res remains 1.\n\nbase squared \u21922*2=4 mod mod.\n\n exponent now 5.\n\nnext loop: exponent=5>0.\n\nExponent is 5 mod2 =1. So multiply res (1) * base \u21921*4 \u2192 res becomes4. \n\nWait step by step:\n\nFirst loop step:\n\nInit res=1, base=2, exponent=10.\n\nFirst step:\n\nexponent >0.\n\nexponent mod2 is 0.\n\nSo do not multiply res by base.\n\nThen set base to (2\u00b2 mod mod_val)=4.\n\nexponent becomes 5 (10/2).\n\nSecond loop: exponent (5>0)\n\n5 mod2 is 1. So multiply res (1)*4 \u21924\n\nres now is 4 mod mod.\n\nbase is (4\u00b2 mod mod_val)=16\n\nexponent becomes 5//2 \u21922\n\nloop again (exponent=2>0). \n\nexponent mod2=0. So do not mod res.\n\nbase becomes (16 squared) 256 mod mod.\n\n exponent 1.\n\nloop again (exponent 1>0). mod2 is 1.\n\nres =4 * 256 mod mod \u21921024 mod mod.\n\n base is then squared (256^2=65536)\n\n exponent becomes 0. \n\nWait let me run step by step.\n\nSecond loop: after first step (exponent=5):\n\nAfter that, next iteration:\n\nexponent=5:\n\nThe first step is to check if exponent odd.\n\nSince it is, multiply res (1) by base (2):\n\nWait initial steps:\n\nWait in the powmod function:\n\nLet me track variables for powmod(2,10):\n\nexponent =10.\n\nres =1.\n\nbase=2.\n\nFirst iteration of DO:\n\nexponent>0\n\nmod(exponent,2)=0 \u2192 do the:\n\nif (mod(...,2) ==1) then \u2192 no \u2192 res remains 1.\n\nthen base = base^2 \u2192 2^2 =4 mod mod.\n\nexponent is halved \u21925.\n\nloop again.\n\nSecond pass:\n\nexponent=5.\n\nmodulo is 1. So:\n\nres =1 * base (4) \u21924 mod mod?\n\nWait wait:\n\nWait the first step is: \n\nif exponent is odd, then res = res * current base (i.e., the x? Wait no.)\n\nWait the base here represents the power. Here the code:\n\nthe powmod function is: \n\nThe algorithm is exponentiation by squaring: initializing res =1, then for each bit of the exponent, we multiply res by base^bit if the bit is set. \n\nWait let me code:\n\nLoop structure:\n\nres is initially 1.\n\nThe exponent is 10. \n\nThe steps are:\n\n- exponent 10 is even \u2192 base squared, exponent is 5.\n\n- exponent 5 \u2192 odd. So multiply res by base (2^ (2^3) ?)\n\nNot sure, but I get lost. But in the end, for exponent=10, 2^10=1024.\n\npowmod(2,10) \u21921024 mod mod is correct. \n\nWait in the code, for x=2 and exponent=10:\n\nres is 1 initially.\n\nAt each step:\n\nFirst iteration (exponent 10):\n\nexponent is even \u2192 no multiply \u2192 base becomes 2\u00b2 mod (1e9+7) \u21924. Exponent is 5.\n\nSecond iteration (exp 5):\n\nsince exp mod2 is 1 \u2192 multiply res (1)* base (4) \u2192 res is now 4.\n\nset base = (4)^2 =16. \n\nexp becomes 5//2 \u21922 (5//2 is 2 in integer division).\n\nThird iteration: exponent = 2 even \u2192 no multiply. \n\nbase \u219216^2 =256; exponent\u21921.\n\nFourth iteration: exponent=1.\n\nmod is 1 \u2192 multiply res by base \u21924*256 =1024. \n\nSet res = 1024 mod mod.\n\nbase becomes 256\u00b2. Exponent now 0.\n\nThus, the function returns 1024. Correct. So powmod(2,10)=1024. \n\nThus the function seems okay.\n\nNow, the only potential problem is the array sorting in ascending order (Fortran's sort is in ascending).\n\nYes, sorted c is ascending. \n\nAnother possible issue is the loop's upper limit:\n\nJava's FOR starts with i=2 up to n+1 (inclusive). So in Fortran, the loop ends at n+1. Yes.\n\nNow, the code's array is 1-based, so when we write c(n+2 -i), the indices are correctly 1-based.\n\nAlso, in the loop variable, in Fortran, in the loop do i = 2, n+1 \u2192 runs from 2,...,n+1.\n\nNow, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i <=n+1; i++)\n\nSo same as Fortran.\n\nThus all indices look okay.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should work.\n\nSome typographical details: In the code, the powmod function is in the right place (contained inside the program via contain clause).\n\nBut code structure may need to have the contains and function placed after the end program.\n\nAlternatively, since the powmod is inside the program via contains, the code should work.\n\nWait, the syntax for using contains is:\n\nprogram ...\n\n... \n\ncontains \n\n  function ... \n\nend function \n\nend program \n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother note is that in Fortran, the kind for mod_val is important. Since 1e9+7 is about 1e9 and so is a 32-bit value, but with multiplied others, we need to set variables (like a,b) as 64-bit integers. Thus, all variables in the code are declared as integer(8) where needed. Like powmod returns 8 bit integer, etc.\n\nThus, the code should work."
