The above approach in Fortran should produce the same permutation order as Java does, provided that the loop in the for loop i starts from 1 to L (the first position first), which matches the Java's for (int i=0; ... which starts with the first character. The loop over i in the for loop starts from i=0 to target.length-1, so for a string of characters in \"123\", it first takes i=0 (the 1st character), creating the remaining string \"23\", then i=1 (the 2nd char '2') \u2192 remaining \"13\", etc. Wait but in the Fortran code, the loop starts from i =1 to len(remaining). So the order is consistent: in the first step, choosing the first character (position 1 in Fortran, position 0 in Java) as the first character of the current, then remaining is without it, so for target \"123\", first call's remaining is \"23\" (Java's case). So the order of permutations would be the same as in the Java code? Perhaps. Therefore assuming this, the permutation list in fortran's array will have the same order as the Java list.",

So for example:\n\n Suppose remaining is the string stored as '123 ', with len_trim( remaining) = 3.\n\n Removing the 2nd position (char '2') gives temp_remaining = '1' + '3' + ' ', gives the string '1'3. The trim(len_remaining') becomes 3-1=2 characters, so the next recursive call's remaining argument would have length_trim of 2 (the length after removal). Thus this approach is correct. Thus the code is okay. Now, edge case when i=1. When i =1 in the loop, temp_remaining = remaining(1:0) // remaining(2:end).",

In the main program's allocation, we have:\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line1, source=' ' ) But in Fortran, when declares an allocatable variable with allocation, it's better to do:\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line1 )\n\nthen initialize, but perhaps the initial value can be done as blanks. But the read_line subroutine will overwrite the characters anyway.\n\n-",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I need to understand what the code is doing. Let me read through the Java code again.\n\nThe main function seems to read two lines of input, each consisting of n numbers. Wait no, actually the input is read in a bit tricky way. The code has two arrays of strings, line[2][1], so each line has a single string. For each of the two lines, it reads n numbers per line? Or wait, maybe the code is expecting the first line to be n, then two lines of numbers. Let's see.\n\nWait the main function starts by reading n as an integer from the input. Then the code has a String array line with dimensions 2x1. It loops over the two lines (i from 0 to 1) and for each, it fills the line's first element with an empty string, then loops j up to n and appends each next token (so, each word in the line?) to the string. Wait, that part is a bit unclear. Let's think.\n\nWait, the code uses scanner.next() each time, so the first loop is for each of the two lines. Since the input after n is two lines, each line is split into tokens. So for each line (second for loop over i), the code is collecting all the tokens from the line, appending them to line[i][0]. Because inside the for j loop (from 0 to n-1, since it runs for j up to j < n), each scanner.next() gets the next token, and adds it to line[i][0]. But Scanner.next() reads the next token, so if the input lines after the initial n are each a bunch of integers separated by spaces or newlines, then this code would read them into a single string, concatenating all the tokens (numbers) of each line into line[0][0] and line[1][0]. For example, if the line is \"1 5 3\", it becomes \"153\".\n\nThen the code forms a \"number\" string by concatenating 1 to n, creating a string like \"1234...n\".\n\nThen it generates all permutations of this number, then searches each permutation to see if it matches the two input strings (the lines stored in line[0][0] and line[1][0]). The sum is calculated as (position of first line's permutation index) minus (position of second line's permutation index). Since sum starts at 0, first when you find the first line's permutation index, you add to sum, then when you find the second line's, you subtract.\n\nFinally, it prints the absolute value of the difference between the two indices.\n\nSo the problem here is to compute the difference between the positions of two permutations in the list of all permutations of \"123...n\".\n\nSo to translate this to Fortran, I need to consider data representation and loops.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses modules and functions. The permutation function is recursive in Java. Hmm, recursion in Fortran can be done but maybe it's easier to write it iteratively, though for code translation, perhaps I should mirror it as close as possible, but Fortran might handle lists differently.\n\nWait, but Fortran doesn't have ArrayList or List structures natively. So the permutation list needs to be handled as an array of strings.\n\nHmm, this may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps compute the list on the fly, but for the problem, we need to generate all permutations of the number string, then find each of the two input strings' indices in that array, and take the absolute difference between those indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the permutation generation can be done with a recursive function, building up an array of all permutations.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps using strings stored in an array.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps for the Fortran version.\n\n1. Read N from standard input.\n2. Read two lines, each containing N numbers (digits?), then concatenate the digits for each line into a single string. For example, if the first line has \"3 2 1\" then the first concatenated string is \"321\".\n3. Create the 'number' string as \"123...n\".\n4. Generate all permutations of 'number', store them in an array in order, so each permutation is a string in the array. The order is the same as generated in the Java code.\n5. Find the indices of the two input strings (the two concatenated lines) in this permutation array.\n6. Compute the difference between these two indices (absolute value).\n\nWait, but the indices in Java are zero-based because listA is an ArrayList. So the first element is at position 0, second at 1, etc.\n\nThe Fortran code needs to:\n\n- Handle permutation generation properly. The recursion in Java uses building all permutations by taking each character in turn and permuting the rest. Each permutation is added to the list. So the order is such that permutations are generated by swapping the first character with every possible position first, then permuting the remainder.\n\nWait, looking at the Java permutation code: the base case adds ans+target, which is the current assembled permutation (ans) with the remaining characters (target). Wait the code for the permutation function: when target's length is 1, it appends ans + target (so building the permutation by taking each next character). The recursive step loops over each character in target, moving the i-th character to the ans and permuting the rest. So each time, the current character becomes part of the ans, then the next characters are arranged. So the order of permutations is such that the first character is fixed as each possible of the original string's characters, and then repeat for the next levels.\n\nThe order depends on the recursion. The first call picks each possible first element, then for each, the remaining characters are permuted. So the order of permutation list in Java is determined by this recursive calling order. For example, \"123\", the permutations would be generated in the order that when you pick the first character, say, loop through each position in the target.\n\nWait let me see: for target \"123\", the first iteration of the for loop in i from 0, then call permutation with target = \"23\" and ans = \"1\". Then the next recursion would consider permutations of \"23\" starting with 1. The first iteration there would be pick the first character (2) as next, leading to \"2\", so the permutation becomes \"123\", then when \"3\" is considered, \"132\" etc. Hmm, but let me step through the Java code for the permutation function.\n\nLet me see an example with n=3. The number string is \"123\".\n\nThe initial call is permutation(list, \"123\", \"\"). Then the for loop runs from i=0 to 2 (indices 0,1,2):\n\nFirst i=0:\nCall permutation with target being substring 0->0 excluded (empty string) + substring 2+1? Wait, no. Wait, Java substring(0, i) where i is 0, so substring(0,0) is empty, plus substring(1 (i+1=1) to end. So target becomes \"23\", and ans is the current character (target.charAt(0)) which is '1'. So now the function is called with ans = \"1\", target = \"23\".\n\nThen in this recursive call, since target's length is 2 >1, loop i from 0 to1:\n\nFirst, i=0:\ncall permutation with target: substring(0,0) + substring(1 to end) \u2192 \"\" + \"3\" \u2192 \"3\", ans is \"12\". Then target.length is 1, so add \"123\" to the list.\n\nThen back to i=1 in the second call (target is \"23\", ans \"1\", i=1):\n\ntarget is substring(0,1) is first character of \"23\" (up to 1, so \"2\"), substring(2 (i+1=2) \u2192 gives rest: the substring from \"23\" starting at 2, which is empty. Wait 23 is two chars, indexes 0 and1. So when i=1: substring(0,1) is first 1 char \u2192 \"2\", substring(2) is from index 2 to end \u2192 nothing. So concatenated, target becomes \"2\" + \"\" = \"2\" \u2192 now new_target is \"2\" (from the first half) plus the part after the 1st (original index 1?) Hmm, perhaps for \"23\", when i is 1 (the second character, which is '3'), then the new target is substring(0,1) \u2192 \"2\", plus substring(1+1=2 to end \u2192 nothing. So the new target is \"2\", and ans becomes \"1\"+\"3\" \u2192 \"13\".\n\nThen the next call to permutation(list, \"2\", ans=\"13\"), so target's length is 1, so add \"132\".\n\nContinuing backtracking. Then the loop over i in the target \"23\" (second call when i=0 was done, now i=1, etc.)\n\nThe permutations will be generated in the order determined by the choice in the recursion. So for \"123\", the first permutations would start with each first character, so the order could be like all permutations with '1' first, then those starting with '2', then '3'.\n\nThus, the entire list would be all permutations generated in this way, and the indices are zero-based.\n\nIn Fortran, since we need an array of permutations, the code must generate this list properly.\n\nNow, for the translation steps.\n\nFirst, read n from input, then read two lines. Each line is n characters, since after n digits are concatenated (without spaces). Wait the Java code is taking all tokens from the line and appending them. So each input line (after reading n) is a sequence of n numbers (digits from 1 to n). So, for example, if the line is \"1 2 3\", the concatenated string becomes \"123\", but if the line is \"3 1 2\", it's \"312\".\n\nSo in Fortran, after reading n, we need to read two lines, each has n tokens (integers?), but we need to read the tokens as strings and concatenate them to form the two line strings.\n\nWait the Java code uses scanner.next() each time, so each token is a single digit? Because the numbers entered for each line are permutations of 1 to n, so each must be a single character. Wait the problem likely assumes the input lines are permutations of the numbers 1 to n, but entered as space-separated individual digits. Hence, each token is a single digit. So concatenating them gives the permutation as a string. So in Fortran, for each of the two lines, read n characters (digits) forming a string.\n\nIn Fortran, to read a line's worth of characters (the digits), perhaps read the entire line as a string, stripping spaces. For example:\n\nRead a line from standard input, then remove any spaces, then take the first n characters (assuming the line contains exactly n digits separated by spaces). Alternatively, read the inputs as separate numbers, then convert each to a string and append. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nMaybe read each input line character by character, ignoring spaces. For instance, using a loop.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, here's how:\n\nWe first need to read two lines from the input. For each line, we can read all characters into a string, ignoring spaces, and getting the required n characters.\n\nWait, for the first line after n, the code will process all the tokens and concatenate them. For example, if the line is \"1 2 5\", the scanner.next() will give \"1\", \"2\", \"5\", each, and line[i][0] becomes \"125\".\n\nIn Fortran, we can read all the tokens as a counted loop. For each of the two lines:\n\nWait, in Fortran, reading space-separated values can be done using a list-directed read. For example:\n\ninteger :: n\nread(*,*) n\nThen, for the two lines:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s1, s2\n\nallocate( s1, s2, source = \"\" )\n\nread( *, fmt = '()' )  ! to skip the newline?\n\nBut maybe better to read the entire line into a string, then process it.\n\nAlternatively, use unformatted or formatted reads:\n\nWait perhaps per line:\n\ndo i = 1,2\n   read(*,*) (c(j), j=1,n)\n   s = \"\"\n   do j=1,n\n      write(temp,*) c(j)\n      s = trim(adjustl(s)) // trim(adjustl(temp))\n   end do\n   store s as one of the lines.\nend do\n\nWait, but variables need declarations. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe first, to get the two lines, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=10) :: line1, line2\n\nread(*,*)n\nread(*,\"(a)\") line1\nread(*,\"(a)\") line2\n\nBut the lines may have leading/trailing blanks, so need to process them.\n\nAlternatively, read line1 as a string, and then extract each token. Alternatively, strip the spaces. For example, for '1 2 3', stripping spaces leaves '123', which is what's needed.\n\nSo perhaps using intrinsic functions:\n\nSo for line1, read an entire line as a string, including spaces:\n\ncharacter(len=256) :: fullLine\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: parsedLine1, parsedLine2\n\nread(nActions) would be handled via:\n\nfullLine = ''\nread(*,'(a)') fullLine\nparsedLine1 = adjustl(replace_spaces(fullLine, ''))\n\nWait but replacing spaces might require a function to strip them.\n\nAlternatively, loop over the characters in fullLine, collect non-space characters until we have n of them.\n\nSimilarly for the second line.\n\nHmm, that's a bit involved. Alternatively, read each line's numbers into an array of characters, then concatenate.\n\nWell, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, for each line (twice), read n numbers (as integers), and concatenate their characters.\n\nWait, the problem states that the lines are permutations, so each input line contains exactly n numbers (each from 1 to n), so each is a single character (since n can be up to 9, but wait n could be up to 9? Wait N is up to what? The problem says \"permutations of 1..N\", but n can be up to 18, but then N=20 might have 2-digit numbers, but the input would be the permutation of numbers like 1 to 20 as their string representations, which would require two digits for numbers above 9. Wait that complicates things! Wait, but the original Java code uses scanner.next(), which reads each token as a String. For example, if the numbers are 10, then the token would be \"10\", which would cause the concatenated string to have two characters. Wait, but that would mean the permutation numbers (1..n) would include numbers with two or more digits. But how then does the Java code handling the permutation of \"123\", etc.?\n\nWait, this depends on the problem's constraints. Wait, maybe the problem has n up to 18 or less? Or perhaps the problem expects that each number is represented as a single digit, so n is at most 9. Hmm, but the problem's name is ABC150_C, which probably refers to a programming contest problem (AtCoder). Let me think of the problem.\n\nAh, this problem is likely from a contest where the problem statement probably says that the permutation strings are strings obtained by writing n distinct integers from 1 to n in some order, with each being a single character? Or perhaps the problem uses single digits, so n is up to 9, otherwise numbers like 10 would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input's numbers are such that each is a single character (digits 1-9), meaning n <=9. So the code uses n's from 1 to 9. Because if n is 17, then some numbers would be two digits (like 10-17), but then the code's way of reading the line would result in lines of length 2n, which would not correspond to permutations of \"123...n\", which for n=17 would require 2-digit numbers and thus different length.\n\nWait this implies there might be a mistake in the Java code's logic if n >9.\n\nHmm, perhaps in the problem's context, each number is written as a single-digit, which requires that n is at most 9. So we can proceed with the assumption that each number is a single character, thus n is between 1 and 9. Hence, each input line after reading n consists of n single-digit integers (so each line can be thought of as n characters).\n\nTherefore in Fortran:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen, read two lines, each has n numbers (each is 1 to n, so single digits).\n\nNow, for each line, collect these numbers and append their characters. So for the string \"1 2 3\", the digits '1','2','3' are concatenated to \"123\".\n\nSo in Fortran, for each of the two lines:\n\nRead into an array, then create the string.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, allocate arrays for the lines.\n\nFor each of the two lines:\n\ninteger, dimension(n) :: numbers(1:n)\n\nread(*,*) (numbers(j), j=1,n)\n\nThen, the string is the concatenation of each character represented by numbers. For example, numbers(1)=3 \u2192 character '3'\n\nSo construct the lineString as follows:\n\ncharacter(len = n) :: line1, line2\n\ndo j = 1, n\n   write(line1(j:j), \"(I1)\") numbers(j)\nend do\n\nSimilarly for line2.\n\nWait, yes, because the number is an integer from 1 to n (single-digit), so I1 format will write each as a single digit.\n\nThus, for two lines:\n\nread first line's numbers, create the string by converting each number to a character.\n\nAlright.\n\nOnce lines are read, proceed.\n\nNow, the 'number' is generated as the string \"123...n\", which can be done as:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: numberString\ndo i = 1, n\n   numberString(i:i) = char(ichar('0') + i)\nenddo\n\nWait, 1 + 48 (ASCII for '1'?) Not quite. Wait the ASCII for '1' is 49. So for integer i, numberString(i) = char(ichar('0') + i). So yes, because '1' is '0' + 1, so:\n\nfor i from 1 to n,\n\nnumberString(i) = ASCII('0' + i)\n\nWait 1 + '0' gives '1', yes. That's correct.\n\nThen permutations need to be generated. The permutation list is generated by permuting all permutations of the numberString. The Java code uses a recursive function, which adds all permutations to a list. The order depends on the recursion pattern.\n\nThe challenge is to generate all permutations of the string '123...n' and store them in an array, then find the index of line1 and line2.\n\nIn fortran, recursion might be tricky, but here's an alternative way: to generate permutations iteratively or via a recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the built-in functions in Fortran for permutations, but I don't recall Fortran having any.\n\nThe permutation function in Java is a recursive backtracking approach. Here's how it works:\n\npermutation(list, target, ans) appends all permutations of target with ans at the front.\n\nEach recursive call with a smaller target (missing the ith character) and ans + that ith character.\n\nThe base case is when target is length 0, then add ans. Wait no, when target is length 1, add ans+target (so when target is a single character).\n\nWait the Java code: when target's length is <=1, it does list.add(ans + target). So base case is target has length 1 or 0, but since it's permutations, the input target should start as length n, each step reduces the target length by 1, so in the base case, when target.length() ==1, the ans is built up by the previous characters, so the full permutation is ans+target.\n\nThe recursion builds permutations by choosing each possible first character at each step.\n\nThus in code, for Java, the permutation is generated in the order determined by choosing the characters in order.\n\nIn Fortran, to mirror this behavior with a recursive function, we can have a subroutine that appends to a list (array of strings).\n\nBut Fortran arrays are fixed-length, so precomputing the size first would be better.\n\nThe number of permutations is n! So perhaps preallocate an array of size n! and fill it.\n\nLet me consider implementing the permutation generation in Fortran.\n\nLet me structure this as a function or subroutine that takes the current string accumulation (partial permutation), the remaining characters (chars_left), and adding to an array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have a recursive function that builds the permutation strings and stores them in an array.\n\nHere's an idea for the recursive permutation approach in Fortran:\n\n- We have a global array (or a variable declared in the main program) to hold all permutations. The size is n!.\n\n- Initialize an index variable to track where we are adding the new permutations.\n\n- The recursive subroutine 'generate_permutations' takes the current permutation string, the remaining characters, and for each character in 'remaining', it prepends the current character, then if remaining is exhausted adds it to the list, else recurses.\n\nWait, here's the outline in pseudocode:\n\ntype permutations_array is an array of strings.\n\ncurrent_perm = current string being built.\n\nremaining = the bits left to choose from.\n\nFunction:\n\nsubroutine generate( current, remaining, output, index )\n   if remaining is empty string:\n      output(index) = current\n      index = index + 1\n   else:\n      for each character c in remaining:\n          new_remaining = remaining without c\n          call generate( current//c, new_remaining, output, index )\n   end if\nend subroutine generate\n\nWait but this would require passing index by reference, or a module with a shared variable.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps the easiest way is to use a global array and a counter.\n\nAlternatively, use a helper recursive function that builds the permutations and accumulates them.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to structure it:\n\nAt the top-level:\n\nFirst, compute n!, then allocate an array of length n!.\n\nWe can compute n! as:\n\ninteger :: factorial_of_n = 1\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   factorial_of_n = factorial_of_n * i\n\nend do\n\nallocate( permutations(factorial_of_n), source= '' )\n\n(Note: in Fortran 90 or later, dynamic allocation is possible, but need to manage lengths.)\n\nWait strings in Fortran can be tricky. Since we need to store permutations of length n characters, each string should be length n.\n\nWe can have permutations as an array of character strings: character(len=n), dimension(:) :: perms.\n\nThus, in Fortran code outline:\n\nprogram main\n\ninteger, parameter :: n = ... (the input read from stdin)\n\ninteger :: n, fact_n, index=1\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: number_str\n\ncharacter(len=n), allocatable :: perms(:)\n\n! Read n, and generate number_str as '123...n'\n\n! compute n!:\n\nfact_n =1\n\ndo i=2, n\n\n   fact_n = fact_n *i\n\nend do\n\nallocate( perms(fact_n) )\n\n! initialize index to 1.\n\ncall generate_permutations( '', number_str, perms, index )\n\n! Now perms is filled from 1 to fact_n.\n\n!\n\nend program.\n\nBut how to code generate_permutations as a recursive subroutine?\n\nHere's an outline for the recursive subroutine:\n\nrecursive subroutine generate_permutations(current, remaining, perms, index)\n\n  character(len=*), intent(in) :: current, remaining\n\n  character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(out) :: perms\n\n  integer, intent(inout) :: index\n\n  \n\n  if(len_trim(remaining) == 0) then\n\n    perms(index) = current\n\n    index = index +1\n\n  else\n\n    integer :: i, len_rem\n\n    len_rem = len_trim(remaining)\n\n    do i=1, len_rem\n\n      character(len=len_trim(remaining)) :: rem_cpy = remaining\n\n      character(len=1) :: c\n\n      c = rem_cpy(i:i)\n\n      rem_cpy = rem_cpy(1:i-1) // rem_cpy(i+1: len_rem)\n\n      call generate_permutations( current // c, rem_cpy, perms, index )\n\n    end do\n\n  end if\n\nend subroutine generate_permutations\n\nWait, but there's some issues here. The remaining string is modified to remove character i, then pass to the recursive call.\n\nWait in the original Java code, target is modified by removing the ith character, so in Fortran, the remaining string must be the original string with the i-th character removed.\n\nWait the variable rem_cpy in the code above is the remaining string minus the ith character.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nthe current remaining string is of length say L = len_trim(remaining)\n\nthen for each position i from 1 to L:\n\noriginal character at position i is kept for current:\n\nnew current is current_str + c (current passed from above was ?, but need to see the starter)\n\nWait in the first call, the current is the empty string, and remaining is the full number_str.\n\nThus each step, the function goes through each possible next character in 'remaining', takes it, and passes the revised remaining (without it) and the current plus it.\n\nThis should generate all permutations.\n\nNow, about the parameters:\n\ncurrent and remaining are character variables (passed as parameters, they can be dummy variables).\n\nThe permutations array must be allocatable and passed in, but in the recursive calls, the perms array may need to be available, but with the index incrementing.\n\nHowever, the index variable is passed by reference (as in Fortran, scalar variables are passed as pointers unless specified otherwise). Wait, variables are passed by value unless they are declared INTENT(INOUT) in the argument.\n\nWait in the subroutine:\n\ninteger, intent(inout) :: index\n\nso any changes to index in the subroutine will affect the calling routine.\n\nThis is crucial here. Thus the index starts at 1. Each time a permutation is added to perms(index), then index is incremented.\n\nHowever, in the recursive calls, the index is in the argument position.\n\nWait the first call:\n\nGeneration starts with current = '', remaining = '123', perms array, index =1.\n\nThe subroutine is called, and begins looping over i from 1 to L (3, say).\n\nEach time, it passes to the recursive call a new current and the shortened remaining.\n\nEach such call will further subdivide, until remaining is empty, then they'll write to perms(index) and update the index.\n\nThus, the first full permutation is stored at perms(1), etc.\n\nThus, the code would collect all permutations in the perms array in the order generated. The order depends on the selection of the characters.\n\nNow, the next problem is that in the Java code, the list is built recursively with the order as per the code's recursion. The above approach in Fortran should produce the same permutation order as Java does, provided that the loop in the for loop i starts from 1 to L (the first position first), which matches the Java's for (int i=0; ... which starts with the first character. The loop over i in the for loop starts from i=0 to target.length-1, so for a string of characters in \"123\", it first takes i=0 (the 1st character), creating the remaining string \"23\", then i=1 (the 2nd char '2') \u2192 remaining \"13\", etc.\n\nWait but in the Fortran code, the loop starts from i =1 to len(remaining). So the order is consistent: in the first step, choosing the first character (position 1 in Fortran, position 0 in Java) as the first character of the current, then remaining is without it, so for target \"123\", first call's remaining is \"23\" (Java's case).\n\nSo the order of permutations would be the same as in the Java code? Perhaps.\n\nTherefore assuming this, the permutation list in fortran's array will have the same order as the Java list.\n\nNext, after storing all permutations in the perms array, the code can search each of the two input strings (line1 and line2) to find their indices in the permutations array.\n\nWait in the Java code, they do two passes: for each of the two lines, the code loops all i until finding the permutation matching it, and adds/subtracts.\n\nWait the loop in the Java's code is:\n\nfor each of the two lines (j =0 and 1 in the two lines):\n\n   for i from 0 to listA.size():\n\n     if(listA.get(i) equals line[j][0], then if sum was 0 (the first occurrence), add i to sum, else subtract.\n\nThus the first line's index is added, the second's index subtracted (because the first if's sum is initially 0, so for the first occurrence, sum becomes i. The second line's first occurrence will set sum = (first's index) - second's index.\n\nSo in fortran, we can:\n\nsum is initialized to zero.\n\nLoop over both lines (first and second):\n\nFor each lineString (line1, line2):\n\n   integer :: current_i = notfound\n\n   loop i from 1 to size(perms):\n\n      if (perms(i) == lineString):\n\n          current_i = i\n\n          exit\n\n   end loop\n\n   if (current_i exists):\n\n     if (sum == 0):\n\n        sum = current_i\n\n     else:\n\n        sum = sum - current_i\n\nSo finally, output the absolute value of sum.\n\nNow, handling the line1 and line2 strings to find their indices in the perms array.\n\nNow, in the initial code, the two lines are read as \"line[0][0]\" and line[1][0], so the two lines are the line1 and line2 variables in Fortran.\n\nPutting all this together.\n\nSteps in Fortran Code:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read two lines, and form the string for each.\n\n3. Generate the number string (123...n).\n\n4. Compute its permutations into permutations array.\n\n5. Find the indices of line1 and line2 in the array.\n\n6. Compute |index1 - index2|.\n\nWait but in Java's logic:\n\nThe first line (j=0 in code) adds its position to sum (if it's the first found), the second line (j=1) subtracts its position. So the initial sum is 0. First, for the first line (j=0), the loop finds that the code adds the found i to the sum (sum is 0 initially: sum += i). The second line's loop, the code check: sum !=0, so subtracts the second's i. So the final sum is (first_index - second_index), so the absolute value is |first - second|.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the interim steps would be to capture first and second indices then take their difference's absolute value.\n\nAlternatively:\n\ninteger :: posA = -1, posB = -1\n\ndo i=1, size(perms)\n\n   if(perms(i) == line1) posA = i\n\nend do\n\ndo i=1, size(perms)\n\n   if(perms(i) == line2) posB = i\n\nend do\n\nthen print abs( posA - posB )\n\nAh, that's exactly the same, so perhaps in the code I can directly find both positions with two loops. That's simpler.\n\nYes, this would give the correct result, and the code would be clearer.\n\nThus, the problem is mainly generating the permutations properly. Now, implementing the permutation generator.\n\nWait, also, in the code above, the permutations array in Fortran must be initialized first. Because when starting the recursive call, we can have `index` starting at 1 and writing to the array in order.\n\nWait, the code steps:\n\nAfter allocating perms:\n\ncurrent is ''\n\nremaining is the number_str.\n\nCalling generate_permutations( current, remaining, perms, index )\n\nInitially, index=1.\n\nbut after the call, perms should have all permutations stored from 1 upwards?\n\nYes, because each time when a remaining is found empty, current is stored into perms(index), then index is increased by 1.\n\nThus the function should work.\n\nNow, issues and corner cases.\n\nEdge case when n=1. Then permutations has only 1 element. The code would work.\n\nNow, implement some Fortran code.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nStarting code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_C\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, factorial\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: number_str\n\ncharacter(len=1), parameter :: delimiter = \" \"   !

Now implement this read_line:\n\n    contains\n\n    subroutine read_line(n, str)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        character(len=*), intent(out) :: str\n\n        integer :: val(n)\n        integer :: i\n\n        read(*,*) val       ! assuming that the line has n integers.\n\n        do i =1, n\n            write(str(i:i), fmt='(i1)') val(i)\n        end do\n    end subroutine read_line\n\nHowever, in this code, if n is not known, but the subroutine can be called with known n.\n\nWait this seems manageable.\n\nThus, the lines are stored in line1 and line2, each as strings of length n.\n\nThen the number_str is made as \"123..n\".\n\nnumber_str = ''\ndo i=1, n\n    write(temp_char, '(i1)') i\n    number_str = trim(number_str)//adjustl(temp_char)\nend do\n\nWait in Fortran, perhaps construct number_str as a character of length n:\n\ninteger :: i\ncharacter(len=n) :: number_str\ndo i=1, n\n    number_str(i:i) = char( ichar('0') +i )\nend do\n\nYes. So:\n\nnumber_str = ' '\n\ndo i=1,n\n   number_str(i:i) = char(ichar('0') + i)\nend do\n\nOkay.\n\nNext, the permutation array.\n\nallocate perms(factorial) as character(len=n), dimension(factorial).\n\nInitialize an index counter.\n\nindex_counter = 1\n\nCall generate_permutations( \"\", number_str, perms, index_counter )\n\nThis requires a recursive function.\n\nNow the recursive subroutine.\n\nHere's the recursive subroutine:\n\nrecursive subroutine generate_permutations( current_str, remaining_str, perms, index )\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: current_str, remaining_str\n    character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(out) :: perms\n    integer, intent(inout) :: index\n    integer :: len_rem, i\n    character(len=len(remaining_str)) :: temp_rem\n\n    if (len_trim(remaining_str) ==0) then\n        perms(index) = current_str\n        index = index +1\n    else\n        len_rem = len_trim(remaining_str)\n        do i =1, len_rem\n            temp_rem = remaining_str\n            ! remove the ith character\n\n            temp_rem = temp_rem(1:i-1) // temp_rem(i+1: len_rem)\n            call generate_permutations( current_str // remaining_str(i:i), temp_rem, perms, index )\n        end do\n    end if\nend subroutine\n\nWait some issues here:\n\nIn line current_str // remaining_str(i:i), but since current_str is 'current', and the next character is remaining_str's ith character.\n\nWait current_str is the accumulated string thus far. So the code is passing current_str concatenated with the chosen character.\n\nThus that is correct.\n\nThe remaining string after removing the ith character.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, the remaining_str has a fixed length (probably n, but in the initial call it's the number_str of length n. But as it's passed in and copied, maybe the length is okay.\n\nWait:\n\nThe initial remaining_str is the number_str (length n) .\n\nIn the first call to the subroutine, current_str is \"\" (len 0?), but in the code above, current_str is passed as the empty string? Or as in the initial call, current_str is an empty string.\n\nWait in the first call: the initial call's current_str is passed as the empty string, which is a character variable with length zero?\n\nThis may cause problems in string concatenation.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, when you do character strings with &=, sometimes you need to handle dummy length variables. But this may be a problem here.\n\nAlternatively, we could pass the current_str and remaining_str as fixed-length strings of n characters each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to make all strings involved have length exactly n, and pass as such.\n\nHmm this may complicate.\n\nAlternatively, use the number_str length to decide.\n\nWait the permuated strings are exactly length n.\n\nThus current_str is a character string that is being built up, and the current_str passed into the subroutines is a substring. However, when remaining_str is being shortened each time, eventually the current_str will be of length (n - remaining_length).\n\nWait this suggests that:\n\ncurrent_str's length is (start_length) = initial length 0 \u2192 then each step adds one character.\n\nThus the current_str will have length (initial length + ... ) until it reaches n when remaining_str is empty.\n\nHence, when the remaining_str is empty, current_str has length n.\n\nThus, the code where:\n\nperms(index) = current_str\n\nis correct.\n\nBut when current_str is passed from smaller lengths into the recursive call, in Fortran, the charactertype variables can have different lengths, but if they are declared as variable length variables, perhaps this will work.\n\nAlternatively, we can make current_str and remaining_str as dimension (n) and fixed-length strings.\n\nWait in this case, in the initial call:\n\ncall generate_permutations( current_str, remaining_str, perms, index )\n\nwith current_str as a string of length n. The first call would have current_str as all blanks except first 0 characters. But it can cause errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use strings of length n.\n\nLet me restructure the variables to use fixed-length strings of length n:\n\nAll subroutine uses fixed-length strings of length n.\n\nThus, the driver code would need to declare variables as length n, and use that.\n\nModified generate_permutations:\n\nrecursive subroutine generate_permutations( current_str, remaining_str, perms, index )\n\n    character(len=n), intent(in) :: current_str, remaining_str\n\n    character(len=n), dimension(:), intent(out) :: perms\n\n    integer, intent(inout) :: index\n\n    ...\n\nHowever, this requires that the subroutine knows n, which is a variable in the main program.\n\nTo handle this, we can pass n as an additional parameter, or make the driver code handle it.\n\nAlternatively, using Fortran's internal parameters.\n\nAlternatively, better to proceed with variable length strings.\n\nWait in the code, if in the main program:\n\ncharacter(len=n) :: current_str, remaining_str\n\navec, then pass those to the routine, then the parameters in the subroutine will have the same length.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAt the top-level:\n\ninteger :: n\n\n...\n\nn is known, so the subroutine can be written with explicit interfaces, allowing len to be inferred.\n\nBut since the function is in the same program unit, we can declare it with the right lengths.\n\nAlternatively, here's a version with calculated lengths.\n\nModified code structure:\n\nsubroutine generate_permutations( current_str, remaining_str, perms, index )\n    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit\n    implicit none\n\n    !

Or perhaps not.\n\n            call generate_permutations( current_str // remaining_str(i:i), temp_rem, perms, index )\n        end do\n    end if\nend subroutine generate_permutations\n\nWait but the handling of removing the i-th character might lead to the remaining_str being passed correctly.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe way remaining_str is built when removing the i-th character:\n\nFor ex, remaining_str is \"123\", len 3.\n\nat i=2: remove '2', becomes '13'\n\nIn fortran, the string is stored as array of characters. To remove the character at position i (1-based), we can create the new temp_rem as:\n\ntemp_rem = remaining_str(1:i-1) // remaining_str(i+1: len(remaining_str))\n\nSo that's better.\n\nThus modifying:\n\ntemp_rem = remaining_str(1:i-1) // remaining_str(i+1:)\n\nwait in Fortran, do not need to specify len.\n\ntemp_rem = remaining_str(1:i-1) // remaining_str(i+1:)\n\nThus, even if the length is fixed, the string can have a new trimmed length.\n\nWait, but remaining_str could be a fixed length string (e.g., length n), then temp_rem is composed by chopping out the ith character. Thus, for example, if remaining_str is of length 3 (chars 1 to3), and i=2, then temp_rem would be 2 characters.\n\nThus, in subsequent recursive calls, the 'remaining_str' passed is the string with i-th character removed, which is shorter.\n\nSo this way, the function should work.\n\nThus, the subroutine would work correctly.\n\nThus finally, in the main program:\n\nAfter reading everything and constructing number_str:\n\ncall generate_permutations( '', number_str, perms, index_counter )\n\nBut wait, in the first call current_str is empty?\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the passed parameters:\n\ncurrent_str (empty string? how to represent?)\n\nIn Fortran, an empty string can be passed as a single blank with length zero, but perhaps this is better handled by constructing empty string as a string with length zero. Hmm.\n\nWait the code that calls the first.\n\nindex_counter = 1\n\n call generate_permutations( '', number_str, perms, index_counter )\n\nBut the current_str is passed as a null string (length 0).\n\nBut inside the routine, the remaining_str is the number_str (length n).\n\nThus, in the first call, the code branches into the 'else' part.\n\nThen len_rem = Len_trim(number_str) \u2192 length n.\n\nthen the do loop over i =1 to len_rem.\n\nAt each iteration, temp_rem is the remaining_str with the ith position removed.\n\nWhile current_str is the empty string plus the ith character: so the first character is added.\n\nThen in the recursive calls, the current_str is length 1, and the remaining_str has length n-1).\n\nThe function should proceed fine.\n\nNow the final part: finding the indices.\n\nonce the perms array is filled:\n\ndo i=1, size(perms)\n\n   if (perms(i) == line1) then; posA = i; cycle\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n similarly for posB.\n\nWait if the lines are stored as line1 and line2 of length n.\n\nThen to compare, for example:\n\n line1 must be the same as perms(i)?\n\nBut the lines are read via the subroutine which constructs the string from the numbers.\n\n Thus line1 must be length n (as n digits are read and concatenated into it).\n\nThe line1 and line2 strings may have leading blanks? Or not? Because when constructing by the subroutine, their length is fixed?\n\nIn the read_line subroutine:\n\nthe str (allocated as fixed length?) Let me re-express:\n\nThe subroutine read_line was declared with str(:):\n\n subroutine read_line(n, str)\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n    character(len=*), intent(out) :: str  ! must be at least length n\n\n    integer :: val(n)\n    integer :: i\n    read(*,*) val\n    do i =1,n\n        write(temp_char, '(i1)') val(i)\n        str(i:i) = temp_char  ! assuming temp_char is a temporary single-character string.\n\nWait temp_char must be a character(len=1) variable.\n\nPerhaps:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: temp_char\ndo i =1, n\n    write(temp_char, '(i1)') val(i)\n    str(i:i) = temp_char\nend do\n\nthis would overwrite each character in the str array.\n\n Assuming that the str is of length n.\n\nThus, the lines (line1, line2) must be allocated properly.\n\nSo in the main program:\n\n declare line1 as character(len= n) ?\n\nYes.\n\n Much better to declare all variables with length n or new_str_length.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nAfter reading n from stdin:\n\n allocate character(len=n) :: line1, line2\n\n Read into them via read_line subroutine\n\n Thus, in the main program:\n\ninteger :: n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: line1, line2\n! read n first.\n\nread*,n\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line1 )\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line2 )\n\ncall read_line(n, line1)\ncall read_line(n, line2)\n\nwhere the read_line subroutine takes a string of length n and fills it.\n\nThe subroutines would look like:\n\nsubroutine read_line(n, str)\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: n\n  character(len=*), intent(out) :: str\n  integer, dimension(n) :: vals\n  integer :: i\n\n  read*, vals\n\n  do i=1, n\n    write(str(i:i), '(i1)') vals(i)\n  end do\nend subroutine\n\nThus, with this setup, the lines and the permutation strings are all length n.\n\nThen searching can be done:\n\nposA = 0\n\ndo I =1, factorial\n\n   if (perm(i) .eq. line1) then\n\n      posA = I\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nsimilarly for posB, until found,\n\nthen:\n\nprint*, abs( posA - posB )\n\nWait in Fortran, string comparisons with .eq. are for the entire array. If the strings are the same length, which they are, then this should work.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHere's the Fortran code:\n\nprogram permutation_distance_calculator\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, factorial, posA, posB, index_cnt\n    integer :: i\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: perms(:)\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: line1, line2\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: number_str\n\n    read(*, *) n\n    \n    !

In the main program's allocation, we have:\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line1, source=' ' )\n\nBut in Fortran, when declares an allocatable variable with allocation, it's better to do:\n\nallocate( character(len=n) :: line1 )\n\nthen initialize, but perhaps the initial value can be done as blanks.\n\n But the read_line subroutine will overwrite the characters anyway.\n\n- The generate_permutations sub sooner's temp_remaining is allocated?\n\nNo, in the generate_permutations subroutine:\n\nThe variable temp_remaining is declared with \n\ncharacter(len=len_trim(remaining)), allocatable :: temp_remaining\n\nWait no, the subroutine as written has:\n\n     character(len= len_trim(remaining)), allocatable :: temp_remaining\n\nBut the remaining is a string being passed in, and the initial allocation may cause problems.\n\n Alternatively, the temp_remaining can be a temporary variable of the same length as remaining.\n\nWait, in the generate_permutations subroutine:\n\ninside the loop over i:\n\n                temp_remaining = remaining(1:i-1) // remaining(i+1:)\n\nthe expression's length is len_remaining-1 characters, and because Fortran strings support such concatenation.\n\nAs temp_remaining is a local variable in the subroutine, can be declared with a length param.\n\nAlternatively, declaring temp_remaining as a character( len=len(remaining) )\n\nSo modify:\n\ncharacter(len=len(remaining)) :: temp_remaining\n\nso that:\n\n    character(len= len(remaining)), intent(in) ) I &\n\nWait the remaining string's length is known?\n\nWait remaining is an assumed length character variable. Thus the length can vary between calls.\n\nThus declaring temp_remaining with the same length as 'remaining':\n\n character(len(len(remaining))) :: temp_remaining\n\nWait:\n\n inside the generate_permutations subroutine:\n\n    recursive subroutine generate_permutations(current, remaining, perms, index_count)\n    implicit none\n    character(len=*), intent(in) :: current, remaining\n    character(len=*), dimension(:), intent(inout) :: perms\n    integer, intent(inout) :: index_count\n    integer :: len_remaining, i\n    character(len(remaining)) :: temp_remaining\n\nthen:\n\ntemp_remaining becomes of same length as 'remaining' string.\n\nthen during:\n\ntemp_remaining = remaining(1:i-1) // remaining(i+1:)\n\nThe resulting string will be shorter (length len_remaining-1), but stored in the variable of length len_remaining.\n\nThe excess characters will be blanks? In Fortran, when you assign a shorter string to a longer character variable, it automatically pads with spaces or truncates?\n\n Wait:\n\nIf remaining has length say 5, then \n\ntemp_remaining = substr1 // substr2 ( total 4 chars )\n\nthen temp_remaining will have those 4 chars followed by a space? Or no, in the Fortran allocation, the entire variable is filled with spaces, but when we assign a shorter string, the preceding characters are assigned, and the rest left?\n\n Or does it truncate?\n\n Actually, the assignment will write the new string starting at position 1, and the remaining spaces will be preserved as trailing spaces.\n\n Thus when we pass temp_remaining to the next recursive call, the 'remaining string' will be considered as temp_remaining, which has leading characters plus trailing spaces.\n\n This can be bad, because remaining string could have trailing spaces which are not desired.\n\nThus, this approach may not work correctly, as trailing spaces would be considered when forming the permutation.\n\nThus, better to make 'temp_remaining' do not have trailing spaces, so represent the string precisely.\n\nThus, perhaps using the LEN_TRIM function:\n\nActually, the remaining string, even if having a length of say 5, is a string of which the trimmed length is what's intended.\n\nFor instance:\n\nremaining_string is '123', stored in a string of length 5 (characters '1','2','3',' ',' '),\n\nthen the actual data is stored correctly.\n\nBut when we create temp_remaining:\n\ntemp_remaining = remaining(1:i-1) // remaining(i+1: len(remaining))\n\nThe concatenated string would use the actual content, but the resulting string would have len_remaining -1 characters, but stored in a character variable of length len_remaining.\n\nHowever, when passing temp_remaining to the recursive call's 'remaining' argument,\n\n the length_trim of temp_remaining will be the Len_remaining -1.\n\n Thus, the code should work, because the length_trim function will give the actual length.\n\n So for example:\n\n Suppose remaining is the string stored as '123 ', with len_trim( remaining) = 3.\n\n Removing the 2nd position (char '2') gives temp_remaining = '1' + '3' + ' ', gives the string '1'3.\n\n The trim(len_remaining') becomes 3-1=2 characters, so the next recursive call's remaining argument would have length_trim of 2 (the length after removal).\n\n Thus this approach is correct.\n\n Thus the code is okay.\n\nNow, edge case when i=1.\n\nWhen i =1 in the loop, temp_remaining = remaining(1:0) // remaining(2:end).\n\nThe first part is an empty string. Thus remaining(2 to end) is the substring starting from i+1 (position 2).\n\nThus, yes.\n\nThus the recursive subroutine should generate all permutations properly.\n\nNow, what about the permutations array's initialization?\n\nThe permutations array is declared in the main program as:\n\nallocate( character(len = n), dimension(factorial) :: perms )\n\nWait:\n\n Wait the code's permutation array allocation could be written as:\n\n     allocate( perms( factorial ), source = ' ' )\n\n or not initialized first?\n\nIn Fortran, when allocating a character array, default initialization fills with space? Or blanks? need not.\n\n Since the permutation array is filled in during recursion, assigning each permutation to perms(index_count) when found.\n\n Thus to ensure all other elements are not garbage, initializing them to empty might be important.\n\n However, when index_cnt increments, only those perm slots up to factorial will be filled.\n\n Thus possibly, it's better to fill them with indefinite values, and during the search, only the first occurrence may be found, but as long as the storage works.\n\n Alternatively allocate to their places properly.\n\n However, the current code should work.\n\nThus, the code should be correct modulo any typos.\n\nNow, some variables declarations:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nperms is declared as:\n\ncharacter(len = n), dimension(factorial) :: perms\n\nWait no, it's an allocatable array:\n\n    allocate( character(len = n), dimension(factorial) :: perms ) \u2014 this syntax might is incorrect.\n\nWait in Fortran, the proper syntax for allocate:\n\nallocate( perms( factorial ), source = char(0)*n )\n\n to allocate an array of factorial elements with length n.\n\n Wait the correct syntax to allocate a character array with length n:\n\n    type(len =n), allocatable, dimension(:) :: perms\n\n Thus, in the code:\n\n declare perms as:\n\n    character(len = n), allocatable, dimension(:) :: perms \n\nand in allocation:\n\n    allocate( perms(factorial) )\n\n This is better.\n\nThus the revised code part:\n\n        character(len =n), allocatable, dimension(:) :: perms\n        \n\n    allocate( perms(factorial) )\n    \n    index_cnt = 1\n    \n    call generate_permutations(\"\", number_str, perms, index_cnt)\n\nNow also, in the generate_permutations subroutine:\n\n the first call current is \"\"\n\nThus:\n\n perm(1) will be recorded when the first permutation is FOUND, current holds the full permutation.\n\n Thus the code should be better structured.\n\nFinally, the program should be bug-free except for syntax.\n\nNow, I'll attempt to write the code with all the corrections."
