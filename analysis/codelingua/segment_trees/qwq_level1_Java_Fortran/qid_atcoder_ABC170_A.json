    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the Java code does first. The program reads input from the user, splits it into an array of strings using spaces as the delimiter, then counts how many elements there are until it hits a \"0\". The count is then printed out.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, handling input like this might be a bit different. Let me think about the steps. First, reading a line from standard input. In Java, they used BufferedReader's readLine, but in Fortran, I can use the standard input unit, probably using a read statement. Wait, but splitting the input into an array of strings... oh right, Fortran has list-directed input which can read multiple values in one line.\n\nWait, the Java code splits the input into strings by spaces, then iterates over each element until it finds a \"0\", incrementing the result each time. The key point is that the input is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces, and we need to count how many are non-zero until the first zero is encountered.\n\nSo translating that into Fortran: The user enters a line with numbers, and we read each number one by one until a zero is found. But how to read them in a loop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe read all the numbers into an array first, then iterate over them until a zero is found. That might be easier.\n\nLet me see the steps again. The Java code does:\n\n1. Read a line from input.\n2. Split into array via space.\n3. Iterate over each element, count steps until \"0\" is found.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps we can read the numbers into an array, then loop through the array until we hit a zero, counting the elements until then.\n\nBut in Fortran, array handling might be a bit more involved. Let me think about the syntax. Let's suppose that the input is read as a list of integers. Let's see:\n\nFirst, declaring an array. Since the input can have up to, say, 10 elements (since problem like ABC170_A is probably small). But how do we know the size? Alternatively, maybe read until end of line. Wait, but the problem here is to read all numbers until a zero is encountered, but if the input doesn't have a zero? But the Java code breaks on \"0\", so in that case, the input must include a zero, otherwise the loop would run through all elements. Wait, the problem might ensure that there's at least one zero.\n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the loop is over each element of input_array. It increments the counter each time, and breaks when the current string is \"0\". So the count includes the elements until the first \"0\", but the \"0\" itself is included? Let's see.\n\nWait in the Java loop: for each string in input_array:\n\nresult += 1, then if the string is \"0\", break. So the zero is counted, but the loop breaks after processing it. So for example, input \"1 2 0 3\" would count 3, because the first three elements (1,2,0) are processed. Because when the third element (0) is processed, it adds 1, then breaks. So the count will include the zero as well. Wait no: Let me step through the code:\n\nSuppose input_array has \"0\" as the first element. Then in the first iteration, the loop runs, adds 1 to result (starting from 0), so result becomes 1, then breaks. So the result is 1. Which is correct? Hmm the problem's intention: the question is probably asking to count the number of non-zero numbers before the first zero. Or including the zero?\n\nWait the problem isn't provided here, but the code's behavior determines. The code counts each element until it hits the first zero, including the zero. So the result is the count of numbers up to and including the first zero. Wait, but the problem title is ABC170_A which might be called \"Digit Number of 3\" or something, but without knowing, better to go with code's logic.\n\nAnyway, in Fortran, how to do this.\n\nFirst, need to read the numbers. Let's say we can read all the numbers into an array. Since Fortran is static in array size, but since in the original code, the input is split into an array via spaces, which can be of variable length. So maybe in Fortran, need to read them into an array of sufficient size. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, use a dynamic approach. But old Fortran doesn't support dynamic arrays unless using allocatable arrays. Let me think of using an array with a large enough size, since for ABC problems, the numbers are small.\n\nAlternatively, read the numbers one by one until a zero is entered, then stop. Hmm that's possible.\n\nWait the code in Java waits for the entire line, splits into the array, which is all the numbers in the line as strings, and iterates until the first \"0\" in that array.\n\nIn Fortran, if I read sequentially from the input, then each number can be read one by one in a loop, until zero is found. Because in this way, the code can terminate as soon as a zero is found, without reading the rest.\n\nYes, perhaps this approach would be better for Fortran. So the logic would be: Initialize count to 0 (as in the code). Then in a loop, read a value N. if N is zero, increment count and break, else increment count and continue. But wait, the loop should stop when N is zero, but after counting it. So the Java code includes the zero in the count.\n\nWait in Java:\n\ninput_array contains the numbers as strings. Then for each element:\n\nresult +=1, then compares the string to \"0\", so if it is, break. So if \"0\" is the element, the count is increased, then the loop exits. So in the end, the first zero is counted, but subsequent elements are not.\n\nFor example, input \"0\" \u2192 count is 1.\n\nInput \"1 0\" \u2192 count 2.\n\nInput \"1 2 0 3\" \u2192 count 3.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should do the same.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can be written as follows:\n\nInitialize count=0.\n\nLoop:\n\nRead a number. Each time, read the next number. The problem is how to read numbers one by one until a zero is found. So in Fortran, perhaps in a loop:\n\ncount = 0\n\ndo while (true)\n\n   read *, n\n\n   count = count + 1\n\n   if (n == 0) exit\n\nend do\n\nthen print count.\n\nWait, but wait - this would read each number until the current n is 0, but after counting. Because once n is 0, the count is increased by 1 (before checking if it's zero). Thus exactly as the Java code.\n\nThis would work. The key is that the loop reads each number from input, one at a time, and stops when a zero is found, but counts that zero as part of the total.\n\nBut the problem is the input is given as a single line with numbers separated by spaces. So in Fortran, when you use read *, it reads the next value from the input. The user enters the entire line, and the Fortran program reads each value in sequence.\n\nThus, for example, if the user inputs \"1 2 0 3\", the program reads 1 (count becomes 1), check it's not zero, continue. Then read 2 (count 2), not zero. Read 0 (count 3, then exit). So the result is 3, which is correct.\n\nThis seems correct. So this approach would be better, and more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written in Fortran with a loop that reads each number until a zero is found, counting each step.\n\nNo need to store all the numbers, just count until the first zero.\n\nThus, the Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram main\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, count = 0\n\n   do\n      read *, n\n\n      count = count +1\n\n      if (n ==0) exit\n\n   end do\n\n   print *, count\n\nend program\n\nWait, but wait in Fortran, how does the read handle multiple values on the same line? In list-directed format, the read automatically moves to the next value when reading, so yes. The user would enter all numbers on a single line, and the reads would process them one by one. \n\nYes, that should work. But in this case, in the code when the first zero is read, count is incremented, then check, and exit. So exactly like the Java code.\n\nTherefore, this seems to work. But let's test the cases.\n\nTest 1: input is \"0\" (entered as a single line)\n\nFirst read, n is 0 \u2192 count becomes 1 \u2192 then exit, prints 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nTest 2: input \"1 0\"\n\nFirst read: 1 \u2192 count becomes 1. Not zero \u2192 loop again.\n\nNext read: 0 \u2192 count 2 \u2192 exit \u2192 correct.\n\nTest 3: \"1 2 0 3\" \u2192 3 \u2192 correct.\n\nEdge case: user inputs a line with multiple zeros. For example \"0 1\", when first is zero \u2192 count is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: \"0 0 0\", then the count would be 1, as after the first zero, the loop exits. That's correct per the Java code's logic.\n\nThus, this Fortran code should correctly replicate the Java's behavior.\n\nBut wait, what if the input has no zeros? Then the loop would continue forever, until the end of file. Hmm, but according to the problem statement for ABC170A, maybe the input does contain a zero. Since it's the original code from a problem, the problem's constraints likely guarantee there is at least one zero. So assuming that the code is correct as per problem constraints.\n\nTherefore, this Fortran code should work. But let me look back at the Java code to see any other details.\n\nWait, the Java code uses a BufferedReader and PrintWriter, but the core functionality is about reading a line and splitting into parts. The Fortran method I have suggested doesn't split into an array but processes each number as it comes, which is more efficient and straightforward here.\n\nThus, that's the way to go. So writing that code.\n\nWait but in Fortran, you can't have read *, n in a loop infinitely. Wait, the loop is 'do' loop, which is an infinite loop unless exited. So inside, each read * would get the next value.\n\nSo the code structure is as follows:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc170a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, count\n\ncount = 0\n\nloop_start:\n\nread(*,*,end=100) n\n\ncount = count +1\n\nif (n == 0) go to 100 ! exit loop when zero is read\n\ngoto loop_start\n\n100 continue\n\nprint*, count\n\nend program\n\nWait, but the loop structure can be better with DO-LOOP syntax. Let me try with a more standard loop structure:\n\nAlternatively, in a do-while style loop:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, count =0\n\n  do\n\n    read(*, *, end=10) n\n\n    count = count + 1\n\n    if (n ==0) exit\n\n  end do\n\n  print*, count\n\n  stop\n\n10 continue\n\n  ! In case EOF before any zero?\n\n  ! Hmm, but the problem says the input has a zero, so maybe not needed. But if input terminates before reading zero, then this would hit end=10.\n\nWait but in the problem's code, the input is supposed to have a zero, so maybe the code can ignore that case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should still handle it. But as per the problem's code, Java's code would process all elements in the array, and if none is zero, it would loop all elements, then print the total count.\n\nWait, let me think: Suppose input is \"1 2 3\". The Java code's code would read the array, then loop over all elements. So since none are \"0\", then the loop runs over all elements, so the result is 3.\n\nIn the above Fortran code, when the input is \"1 2 3\" (no zeros), the read statements would hit end of line, then if the user inputs nothing more... Actually, the Fortran read would continue reading from the next line. Wait, but that might not be the case if the entire input is just \"1 2 3\" followed by EOF. Hmmm, so if the user enters only \"1 2 3\" as input, and then terminates, then in the Fortran program's read after reading 3, the next read would try to read more input, but since EOF is encountered, so the read will be end=10.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the loop would continue reading until EOF:\n\nWait, in the Fortran code as written:\n\nThe program loops forever until it hits a zero. So without a zero in the input, it will loop, and when it hits end of file, the read statement's end=10 would trigger. But in that case, it would exit the loop? Let's see:\n\nWait in the code I wrote before:\n\nIn the do loop:\n\nread(*,*, end=10) n \u2192 here, if end of file is encountered, the control goes to the line 10, which is after the print * count. Then the program would jump to label 10 and execute, then continue to whatever is after that? Wait, perhaps the code's structure is:\n\nWait, let me re-express the code with an exit on zero:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, count\n\ncount =0\n\ndo\n\n   read (*,*, end=999) n\n\n   count = count +1\n\n   if (n ==0) exit\n\nend do\n\nprint *, count\n\nstop\n\n999 continue\n\n! handle end of file without a zero?\n\n! Because in this case, the read hits end-EOF, so ends here, but the exit is not triggered, so the loop continues?\n\nWait no. Let me see:\n\nThe loop is:\n\ndo\n\nread... at first read, if EOF occurs, then transfers to 999, skipping the rest of the statements after read. Wait, no, the end=999 clause means that when end is encountered during the read, execution branches to label 999.\n\nSo the loop is:\n\nloop:\n\ndo\n\n   read (*,*, end=999) n \u2192 suppose it's end \u2192 jump to 999, so the loop will not proceed to count etc.\n\nWait, so the loop is entered, the first read hits end \u2192 jumps to 999. Then control goes to 999. Then after that line (the one at label 999), where is that?\n\nThe code after the do loop would be the print statement. Because the end is 999, so the read transfers control to label 999, which may be after the loop.\n\nWait here's the code structure:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, count\n\n  count =0\n\n  do\n\n     read (*, *, end=999) n\n\n     count = count +1\n\n     if (n ==0) exit\n\n  end do\n\n  print *, count\n\n  stop\n\n999 continue\n\n  ! The user entered an EOF before a zero was found.\n\n  ! So the count hasn't been incremented for the last read?\n\nWait confusion here.\n\nSuppose the input ends before any numbers were read. For example, the user enters nothing and just sends EOF.\n\nThen in first iteration of the loop, the read will try to read n, but immediately hit end=999, so transfers to label 999, skipping the rest of the loop. Then after the 999 line (which is just \"continue\"), the control would go to the next line after the label? Since 999 is just a label, the execution would proceed.\n\nWait in Fortran, labels can be placed anywhere, so after jumping to 999, execution continues with the next statement after the label.\n\nThus, the program would fall through. Let me write out the code structure with labels.\n\nSuppose code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, count\n\ncount =0\n\ndo\n\n   read *, ... end = 999 \u2192 then upon end, jump to label 999.\n\nBut if the loop is written as:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, count\n\ncount =0\n\nloop: do\n\n   read(..., end =999)\n\n   ... computations...\n\n   if (n =0) exit loop\n\nend do loop\n\n...\n\nthen if the read hits end=999, jumps to 999, but other code?\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding an end label.\n\nBut given the problem's context, maybe the code can assume that the input contains a 0, so it's okay.\n\nIn the original Java code, the input is split into an array (all elements of the input line). Thus if there are no zeros, it will process all elements. In that case, the result would be the total number of elements.\n\nIn the Fortran code written with the loop until a zero is found, if the input has no zeros, the program will loop forever because the loop will keep reading until an end of file. Wait, no. Because when you reach the end of the line, Fortran will continue reading from the next line. If the entire input is done (user sends EOF), then the final read will trigger the end=999 which jumps to that label.\n\nSo, in the scenario where the input has no zeros but terminates with EOF:\n\nThe read once it gets to end, skips to label 999, and the loop would not have counted that last input line, but perhaps that depends.\n\nWait let me walk through an example where input is \"1 2 3\" (user typed that then Ctrl-D).\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst iteration of loop:\n\nread is executed. The first input is 1 \u2192 proceeds. count becomes 1. check is 1 is 0? no. next iteration:\n\nread again, now gets 2. count 2, not zero. Next iteration.\n\nRead again: gets 3. count 3, not zero. Next iteration:\n\nNow the next read after the last number (3) would require another number. Since the user entered EOF (no more input), the read now hits end=999 and transfers control to label 999.\n\nThe program then skips the line count = count +1 and the if statement. The read is the first statement in the loop, so after transferring to 999, it proceeds to the code after the loop.\n\nWait the loop is a do block. The 'do' loop is 'do ... end do', so after the read (and branching to label 999), the loop is not exited normally. So after the jump to 999, we go to the label there, and the code after the loop is the print statement. The code after the label would proceed to the print. \n\nWait, no, the code would be like:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, count\n\ncount =0\n\ndo\n\n   read(*,*, end=999) n   ! if end, jump to 999\n\n   count=count +1\n\n   if (n ==0) exit\n\nend do\n\nprint *, count\n\nstop\n\n999 continue \n\nSo if it hits end during read, the rest of the statements in the loop's iteration (i.e., count = count+1, the if, etc.) are skipped, and then the control goes to the line at label 999. So after that label, execution proceeds to the next line after the label, which is the print statement. So the value of count is whatever it was before the last read failed. Wait in the case of \"1 2 3\" input:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nread gets 1 \u2192 count 1, etc.\n\nSecond: read gets 2 \u2192 count 2.\n\nThird: read gets 3 \u2192 count 3.\n\nFourth iteration: read is waiting for more input. Since there's no input, it hits end=999 and transfers control to 999, so the statements count=count +1 and if (n==0) exit are skipped. Then, it proceeds to execute the line after the label, which is the print statement. So count would be 3?\n\nWait no: in fourth iteration, the read in the \"do\" loop's start would read expecting a value but hits EOF. The program branches to 999. So count hasn't been incremented for the missing input. So in the \"1 2 3\" case:\n\nThe loop runs three times (for 1,2,3), each time successfully reads the number, thus:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nread 1 \u2192 then count +=1 (becomes 1), check 1 \u22600 \u2192 loop continues.\n\nSecond: read 2 \u2192 count becomes 2 \u2192 no exit.\n\nThird: read3 \u2192 count becomes3 \u2192 no exit.\n\nFourth iteration of loop:\n\nNow, do loop starts again. \n\nThe code reads the next number. There are none. So read statement hits end=999, transfers control to label 999.\n\nThus, the remaining statements in the loop iteration (count +=1, the if, etc.) are not executed.\n\nTherefore, after the loop, the count is still 3, and the print statement would output 3.\n\nSo that's correct! So in this case, even without a zero, the count adds all the numbers read before EOF is detected. \n\nBecause, the loop would continue indefinitely until the read triggers an end. But the loop starts with reading, then count and if. So in the example, the last read before end is the read of 3, which was handled in the third iteration. The fourth iteration's read doesn't get a number (because EOF), so the loop skips to 999, and the count remains at 3. Which is correct: the array in Java code would have three elements, so the code counts all three (even if none is zero).\n\nTherefore, the code works even if there are no zeros.\n\nSo my initial code with:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, count\n\ncount =0\n\ndo\n\n   read(*,*,end=999) n\n\n   count=count+1\n\n   if (n ==0) exit\n\nend do\n\nprint *, count\n\n999 continue\n\nend program main\n\nWait no, I missed the stop, but I think it's okay because after the loop, the print statement is executed. Then program ends.\n\nWait the 'end program main' at the end will end.\n\nAlternatively, when in the 999 label:\n\nThe code would branch to 999, which is 'continue', and then the remaining statements after the loop would be the print * count.\n\n Wait, in the code structure as written above:\n\nAfter the loop comes the print statement. The loop could either exit via exit (when n is 0), leading to execution of the print, or hit the end=999 which transfer control to label 999. The code at 999 is just a continue, so execution proceeds with the next statement after the label, which is the print statement. Thus, in all cases, the print is executed.\n\nThus, that code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this code should correctly replicate the behavior of the Java code. Thus, the Fortran translation is as above.\n\nTesting the code for different cases:\n\nCase1: \"0\" \u2192 count is 1\n\nCase2: \"1 0\" \u2192 count is 2.\n\nCase3: \"1 2 0 3\" \u2192 count 3.\n\nCase4: \"1 2 3\" \u2192 count 3.\n\nCase5: empty input \u2192 count 0? Let's see: the first read in the loop will cause the end=999 to trigger, so the code goes to label 999, the print * count will print 0 because count was 0 initially.\n\nBut in the Java code, what happens when the input is empty? The input_array would be split into empty strings? Since the line is empty, split by spaces gives an empty array, the loop doesn't run at all \u2192 result is 0. Thus Fortran code would also give 0, which matches.\n\nSo yes, the Fortran code handles that correctly.\n\nGreat, so this seems correct.\n\nNow, the user also asked for the Fortran code, so present it in a boxed manner."
