So replacing:\n\n    read(*,*) (list1(i), i = 1, a)\n\nwith:\n\n    read(*,*) list1\n\nSame for list2: read(*,*) list2. That would be simpler. The entire array is read. So that's better. Therefore the code becomes:\n\nprogram codeforces_421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    read(*,*) list1\n    read(*,*) list2\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        found = .false. do j = 1, a\n            if (list1(j) == i) then\n                found = .true. exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (found) then\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '1 '\n        else\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '2 '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*)\n\nend program codeforces_421A\n\nThis should be better. Also the allocate is correctly done. Now, the 'advance=no' is important so that the writes are on the same line. But the last write(*,*) is to print a new line, so that after the loop that ends with a space, the program ensures that the output is correctly followed by a new line. But actually, the problem expects the output as in the Java code, which prints the numbers followed by a space, but with all on the same line, and the next line is empty? Wait in Java, the System.out.print would just append to the same line. So after the loop, the line would end with a space, but the code doesn't output a new line. So perhaps in Fortran, omit the final write(*, *), but then the program would have the trailing space but not the new line.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Hmm. Alright, first I should understand what the Java code is doing and then think about how to implement the same logic in Fortran.\n\nThe Java code reads inputs n, a, b. Then it reads a list of a integers into list1 and a list of b integers into list2. After that, it loops from 1 to n (since it's using i+1 where i starts at 0). For each number i+1, if it's present in list1, it prints 1, else it checks if it's in list2? Wait, no, looking at the code again. Oh wait, no. Actually, the code just checks if the number is in list1, and if so, prints 1, else 2. Wait, so the list2 is not even used. Wait that's odd. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, the code's for loop for list2 just adds to list2, but the actual check only uses list1. That's strange. Wait, maybe it's a mistake in the code? Because in problem 421A from Codeforces? Maybe. Let me think. Oh maybe the actual problem requires checking if the number is in either list1 or list2 and something else. Wait but the code as given, perhaps the problem is such that for each number from 1 to n, if it's in list1, output 1, else if in list2, output 2, else something else? But in the code, the else is 2 regardless.\n\nWait the code in Java does this: for each integer from 1 to n (since i goes from 0 to n-1, so i+1 gives 1 to n). For each, if it's in list1, print 1, else (regardless of list2) print 2. So, the list2 is not being used. That might mean either it's a mistake in the original code, or perhaps the problem requires a different logic. But since I have to translate the code as is, I must stick to it even if it seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is meant to check both lists? But the code as written only checks the first list. Maybe there's an error here, but maybe I should proceed as per the code given.\n\nSo the task is to translate that exact code's logic into Fortran, regardless of possible logic errors.\n\nAlright, so in Fortran, how do I handle this?\n\nFirst, the Java code uses ArrayLists for list1 and list2. So in Fortran, since arrays have fixed sizes, but the a and b values are known, maybe we can use arrays with size a and b respectively. So list1 will be an array of integers of size a, and similarly list2 of size b, but since in the code, list2 is not used, perhaps that can be ignored?\n\nWait, but the code reads the list2 elements even if not used. But since we need to translate the code precisely, even if the list2 isn't used, we should still read those elements.\n\nIn Fortran, we'll need to read n, a, b first. Then read a integers into an array for list1, then read b integers into another array for list2 (even though they are not used in the output), and then loop from i=1 to n, and check if that number is present in list1. So how do we check if a number is present in the list?\n\nIn Fortran, handling this is a bit tricky because you need to loop through the array. Since the code uses contains in Java, which is O(n), perhaps the same approach is acceptable here.\n\nSo steps for Fortran:\n\n1. Read n, a, b.\n2. Read a elements into an integer array (list1).\n3. Read b elements into another array (list2), but don't need to use it.\n4. For each number from 1 to n:\n   a. Check if this number is present in list1.\n   b. If yes, print 1, else print 2.\n\nWait, but since list2 isn't used, this is what the code does, so perhaps the problem had a different requirement. But again, this is the code to translate, so proceed as per the code.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran:\n\nFirst, variables. Declare n, a, b as integers. Then arrays for list1 and list2. Since a and b can be up to, say, the maximum possible in Codeforces problem? Well, in Fortran, to declare an array, the size has to be known at compile time if using a fixed array. Alternatively, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the length can be determined via variables. Since we can read a first before declaring the array? Wait, Fortran's array sizes are often set at declaration. So for allocatable arrays, we can first read a, then allocate an array of size a.\n\nSo the approach in code will be:\n\nRead n, a, b. Wait no, the first line is Scanner sc = new Scanner... Then n = sc.nextInt(); a = sc.nextInt(); b = sc.nextInt(); So the order is n first, then a, then b.\n\nWait in the code, the order is:\n\nScanner sc = \u2026\n\nn = sc.nextInt();\n\na = sc.nextInt();\n\nb = sc.nextInt();\n\nThen read a elements to list1 and then b elements to list2.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, first the program will need to read n, a, b in that order, then read a numbers into array1, then b numbers into array2.\n\nNow, in Fortran code:\n\nWe can read the inputs as:\n\nread(*,*) n, a, b\n\nThen declare arrays:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: list1, list2\n\nallocate(list1(a)), allocate(list2(b))\n\nBut wait, order of allocation:\n\nWe need to read a first to know the size, so after reading n, a, and b, the sizes are known, so allocate list1(a) and list2(b).\n\nThen read list1: read(*,*) (list1(i), i=1,a)\n\nSimilarly for list2: read(*,*) (list2(i), i=1,b)\n\nThen, loop i from 1 to n:\n\nfor each number = i (since numbers from 1 to n, so when i is 1: check 1, 2: check 2, etc.)\n\nSo the loop would be do i = 1, n\n\nthen check if i is present in list1.\n\nTo check if i is present in list1 (the first array which has a elements):\n\nWe can loop through each element in list1 and see if any is equal to i.\n\nSo the inner part of loop:\n\nflag = .false.\n\ndo j = 1, a\n\n   if (list1(j) == i) then\n\n       flag = .true.\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nif ( flag ) then \n\n    print*, '1', ' '\n\nelse \n\n    print*, '2', ' '\n\nend if\n\nWait, but in Java, it's System.out.print(1 + \" \").\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to print 1 or 2 followed by a space, but with no new line at the end.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the print statements can be done with a write statement. \n\nSo in the loop, for each i, we want to output either \"1 \" or \"2 \" and append a space, but without a trailing space at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's acceptable as per problem requirements if there's an extra space at the end. Because in Java, the code would print N elements each followed by a space, resulting in a trailing space. The problem in codeforces often allows trailing spaces, but sometimes they are strict. \n\nAssuming it's acceptable, the loop would look like:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   flag = .false.\n\n   do j = 1, a\n\n      if (list1(j) == i) then\n\n          flag = .true.\n\n          exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag) then \n\n      write(*,'(a)', advance='no') '1 '\n\n   else\n\n      write(*,'(a)', advance='no') '2 '\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nBut perhaps the advance option may not be necessary. Alternatively, use a format that appends to same line.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n   if (flag) then \n\n      write(*, '(I0, 1X)', advance='no') 1\n\n   else\n\n      write(*, '(I0, 1X)', advance='no') 2\n\n   end if\n\nBut making sure that the last element also has the space. Well, the problem may require exactly N numbers with a space between, so trailing space may be allowed, so perhaps it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the outputs into a string and then write once. But that might be more complex in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, implement the write statements with a comma format that suppresses new line and adds a space.\n\nThe exact formatting would need to be checked.\n\nAlternatively, for simplicity, since in the Java code we are printing '1 ' each time, which is the integer followed by a space. So a single space after each number. So the Fortran code could do:\n\nwrite(*, '(i0, a)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n\nBut for each element, that would be 1 followed by space. The 'a' means a string, so using ' ' as the second term. But perhaps better to use a format that appends to the same line.\n\nAlternatively, using a format that writes the number with a space after, but without comma.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps using a format that for each element, outputs as an integer followed by a space. But to do that, for writing all at once, perhaps:\n\nBut in the loop, the simplest way, perhaps in the loop, for each iteration, write either '1 ' or '2 ', and then after the loop, the next line.\n\nWait, but at the end, the output might have a trailing space. But the Java code also prints a space after the last element, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, maybe using a loop that writes each step with the space.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nWe'll structure the code as follows.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nprogram cf421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n\n    logical :: found\n\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    allocate( list1(a) )\n\n    allocate( list2(b) )\n\n    read(*,*) list1  ! this reads a elements\n\n    read(*,*) list2  ! reads next b elements\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        found = .false.\n\n        do j=1, a\n\n            if ( list1(j) == i ) then\n\n                found = .true.\n\n                exit\n\n            end if\n\n        end do\n\n        if (found) then\n\n            write(*, '(i0, a)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n\n        else\n\n            write(*, '(i0, a)', advance='no') 2, ' '\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    ! After loop, maybe need to add a new line\n\n    write(*,*) ''\n\nend program cf421A\n\nWait, but in the above code, the writing is done via the pairs 1 and 2 followed by a space. The advance='no' is needed so that the next write doesn't start a new line. The first part (i0) is the integer as written, and the second is the single space. However, using this format would require using a format specifier. Alternatively, we can just write a character string \"1 \" etc.\n\nWait, maybe this would work better with write(*, '(a)', advance='no') \"1 \" ?\n\nLike:\n\nFound = etc...\n\nif (found) then\n\n   write(*,'(a)', advance='no') trim(adjustl(\"1 \"))\n\nelse\n\n   write(*,'(a)', advance='no') trim(adjustl(\"2 \"))\n\nend if\n\nWait, but \"1 \" is just a string with two characters, so writing as a character string would probably be easiest.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n   write(*, '(i1,a1)', advance='no') 1, ' '\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to construct the string.\n\nAlternatively, the line could be:\n\nwrite(*,'(a)', advance='no') \"1 \"\n\nSo the write statement would just writing the string \"1 \" without any formatting.\n\nYes, so:\n\nif (found) then\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') \"1 \"\n\nelse\n\nwrite(*, '(a)', advance='no') \"2 \"\n\nend if\n\nWait but that would add \" \" after 1 or 2. So that would be the same as the Java code, which does 1 + \" \" each time. Even the last element would have a space. However, sometimes online judges don't care about trailing space as long as the numbers are correct, so this should be okay.\n\nNow, need to handle the reading correctly.\n\nNow, the allocate list1(a) and then read list1, read as:\n\nread(*,*) list1\n\nThis should read a numbers into the array.\n\nTesting in mind: if a is 3 and the input after n and a,b would be, say, 3 5:\n\nThen 1 2 3 are the numbers for list1, and then 4 5 etc. are for list2. So the read statement for list1 (a elements) will take the next a elements correctly.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, the input is read as free format, so multiple numbers per line are allowed, but the interpreter will read them in sequence. The code expects that all the a numbers for list1 are available after n a b, and then the b numbers for list2.\n\nNow, the main loop over i from 1 to n, and for each, check existence in list1.\n\nNow, for the variables:\n\nMake sure dynamic allocation is correct. The code uses allocatable arrays with allocate after reading a and b. So that part is okay.\n\nNow, for very large a and b? Well, in a programming competition, the constraints are manageable in fortran arrays.\n\nNow, what about the 'list2'? The Java code uses list2 but in the code it's not used. So in Fortran, reading list2 is part of the input. Therefore we must read those b numbers, but not use them. That part is necessary as per the original code.\n\nSo code should correctly read those numbers even if they are not used.\n\nNow, the code is done. Let me check again.\n\nWait: in the loop over i (from 1 to n), we have the inner loop checking each element in list1. So that's O(n*a), which might be acceptable, but for very large n and a (like 1e5 each, but maybe the problem's constraints don't require better). Since this is the equivalent of the original code's contains method, which uses linear search, it should be okay as per the problem's intended.\n\nAnother thing, the code uses list1.contains (i+1 in Java). Wait no, looking back, no: in the java code the loop was for(int i =0; i <n; then uses i+1. So in Java it's iterating i from 0 to n-1, so i+1 is 1 to n. Hence the Fortran equivalent is correct with do i =1 to n, which also covers 1 to n.\n\nAlright, so I think that code is correct. So putting it all together:\n\nThe program section, variables, loops, etc. as above.\n\nWait the code in the answer must be enclosed correctly. Let me write the Fortran code following these steps.\n\nWait also note: need to use 'program' block, with variables properly declared, etc.\n\nNow, the final code would be something like this.\n\nSo the Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    ! Read inputs\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    ! Allocate arrays for list1 and list2\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    ! Read list1 elements\n    read(*,*) (list1(i), i = 1, a)\n\n    ! Read list2 elements\n    read(*,*) (list2(i), i = 1, b)\n\n    ! Loop over each number from 1 to n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        ! Check if the current number is in list1\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, a\n            if (list1(j) == i) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        ! Write the result\n        if (found) then\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '1 '\n        else\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '2 '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Add a new line at the end to finish the output\n    write(*,*)\n\nend program codeforces_421A\n\nHmm, but in the reading part, instead of (list1(i), i=1,a), we could just read with a single read statement like read(*,*) list1. Since list1 is an array, the read will take as many elements as needed. Similarly for list2.\n\nWait, in Fortran, reading an array like read(*,*) list1 will read all its elements in sequence, so the program can use:\n\nread(*,*) list1\n\ninstead of explicit loops.\n\nSo replacing:\n\n    read(*,*) (list1(i), i = 1, a)\n\nwith:\n\n    read(*,*) list1\n\nSame for list2: read(*,*) list2.\n\nThat would be simpler. The entire array is read. So that's better.\n\nTherefore the code becomes:\n\nprogram codeforces_421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    read(*,*) list1\n    read(*,*) list2\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        found = .false.\n        do j = 1, a\n            if (list1(j) == i) then\n                found = .true.\n                exit\n            end if\n        end do\n\n        if (found) then\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '1 '\n        else\n            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') '2 '\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*)\n\nend program codeforces_421A\n\nThis should be better. Also the allocate is correctly done.\n\nNow, the 'advance=no' is important so that the writes are on the same line.\n\nBut the last write(*,*) is to print a new line, so that after the loop that ends with a space, the program ensures that the output is correctly followed by a new line. But actually, the problem expects the output as in the Java code, which prints the numbers followed by a space, but with all on the same line, and the next line is empty? Wait in Java, the System.out.print would just append to the same line. So after the loop, the line would end with a space, but the code doesn't output a new line. So perhaps in Fortran, omit the final write(*, *), but then the program would have the trailing space but not the new line. However, in many online judges, a trailing space is acceptable if the numbers are correct. Alternatively, the Fortran code could write like this:\n\nBut adding the final empty write(*) line might make the output have a trailing new line, which could be better. Because the problem likely expects exactly the N numbers each separated by space, and perhaps no trailing space. But looking back at the Java code:\n\nThe Java code does: \n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) { ... System.out.print( ??? + \" \"); }\n\nso it adds a space after each element, including the last one. So the output line is exactly \"1 2 2 ... 1 \" with the last character a space, and then maybe a newline or not.\n\nThe user's code in Java will print the numbers separated by space, but ends with a space. So in Fortran, if we do not output a new line, it will also just be the numbers followed by a space. The online judge may or may not accept that.\n\nIf the problem's output requires exactly N integers with space in between, then a trailing space is allowed (as it's separated by space). For example, if the required output is '2 2 3', then '2 2 3 ' is incorrect, but may depend on the problem's checker. Alternatively, it may be that the sample outputs have exactly the required numbers separated by space without trailing space, so we must avoid the trailing space.\n\nHmm. To do that, need to avoid emitting the last space. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the outputs and print them in one go with appropriate formatting. But how?\n\nAnother method: for the first element, print without space, then for others add space and the number. But the loop is from i=1 to n. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nLet me think of using a buffer in Fortran to collect the output. Since Fortran strings are a bit tricky, but we can use a character array or dynamic strings, but that might be cumbersome.\n\nAlternatively, output in reverse and build the string, but it's perhaps over complicated.\n\nAlternatively, create an output line as a string with each token separated by a space. Then trim the trailing space.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran we can write all the numbers with a space separator, but that would require a format that does this.\n\nWait, for example, the do loop can be written as:\n\n Instead of a loop that writes each time, perhaps write everything in one write statement.\n\nThe problem is building the array of characters on the fly. Alternatively:\n\n   integer, dimension(n) :: output\n\n   . . .\n\n   do i=1 to n:\n\n      set output(i) to 1 or 2.\n\n   Then write(output, \"(1000i0, 1x)\") but no, the format would need to print each number followed by space except last.\n\n Alternatively:\n\n write(*, \"(i0, 1x, $(n-1 times), i0 )\", but that's not doable programmatically.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach, for each element except last, print \"1 \" or \"2 \", and for the last, just \"1\" or \"2\".\n\nThis would require tracking if it's the last iteration.\n\nSo modifying the loop:\n\ndo i=1 to n\n\n   if the last number?\n\n   then write without space.\n\nElse write with space.\n\ninside:\n\nif (found) then\n\n   if (i ==n) then\n\n       write(... '1')\n\n   else\n\n       write(... '1 ')\n\nElse\n\n   similar.\n\nBut how to find the end.\n\nLike:\n\n if (found) then\n\n    if (i == n) then\n\n        write(*,'(i0)', advance='no') 1\n\n    else\n\n        write(*,'(a)', advance='no') '1 '\n\n    end if\n\n else\n\n    similar for 2.\n\nBut that's a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed with the original code that may have trailing space. Maybe the problem's checker trims the line, so trailing space is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, proceed with code without extra newline, but the initial version with the write(*,*) at the end adds a new line. The initial code's Java code may not end with a new line. Wait, in Java, if it's all System.out.print, no println, then the output doesn't have a new line. So the correct code should not add a new line. So the Fortran code should also not, so removing the final write(*,*).\n\nWait, the trailing space might be an issue, but the problem may expect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just checking the problem's input.\n\nAlternatively, see the code in Java. The code prints \"1 \" for each of the n steps, so there's a trailing space.\n\nFor example, if n is 1 and a is 1, and the list contains [1], the output is \"1 \".\n\nIf the problem expects \"1\" without the space, then this would be wrong, but otherwise if it's allowed, then it's okay.\n\nBut since the user provided the Java code which includes that, then the correct Fortran code should match that.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would:\n\nProgram codeforces_421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    allocate( list1(a) )\n\n    read(*, *) list1 ! list2 is not used\n\n    ! The list2 is read but not used. Wait in the original Java code, the code reads the list2 but does not use it? Wait the code in Java has \n\nWait the Java code was:\n\nAfter reading list1 and list2, the code proceeds to loop and only tests against list1. So in the Fortran code, even if list2 is read into an array, it's not used. So the code above does allocate(list2(b)), but does not have that in variables. Wait wait in the code I wrote earlier I had list2 is an array, but the code after reading it doesn't use it. The code can ignore the array. So the code is okay.\n\nWait in the code above, the allocate list1 and list2. The variables declared include list2 as an allocatable array, but the code after reading list2 doesn't use it. So that's correct, since original Java code does read list2 but doesn't use it. It's part of the input.\n\nThus the code is as above.\n\nWait but in the previous code, after:\n\nallocate(list2(b))\n\nthen read list2, but then list2 is not used.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nSo the code in Fortran is as follows.\n\nBut in the code I had earlier, in the second code block, I forgot to include list2 in the declaration. Because in the first code block I wrote the code with list2 but then in the next example, when I replaced the read loop with read(*,*) list1, but when I moved to the better version I forgot about list2.\n\nWait looking at the code after the first code sections, in the second version I wrote the code as:\n\n program codeforces_421A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, b\n    integer, allocatable :: list1(:), list2(:)\n    logical :: found\n    integer :: i, j\n\n    read(*,*) n, a, b\n\n    allocate(list1(a))\n    allocate(list2(b))\n\n    read(*,*) list1\n    read(*,*) list2\n\n     ... then later code.\n\nSo the list2 is declared as allocatable and read, but not used. That's okay.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final code is as above.\n\nThus I think that's the correct Fortran code for the given Java code."
