    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads an integer K and a string S. If the length of S is less than or equal to K, it prints S as is. Otherwise, it prints the first K characters followed by \"...\".\n\n\nHmm, Fortran's input/output is a bit different. Let me think about how to handle that. The Java uses a Scanner, so in Fortran, I'll probably need to read from standard input using read(*,*) or similar. But strings can be tricky. Also, string operations like getting a substring and concatenation are needed.\n\n\nFirst, I need to declare variables. The integer K and the string S. In Fortran, strings have fixed lengths, so I need to set a maximum size. The problem might not specify a maximum, but since it's similar to programming contest problems, maybe 1000 characters is enough? Let's say S is a character array of length, say, 1000 or something. Alternatively, maybe use a variable length string with the new standard's features like in Fortran 2003/2008. Oh right, but maybe it's better to stick to 2003 or 2008? I'm not sure about compatibility here. Alternatively, for getting the string, perhaps read it as a line? Let me check.\n\n\nWait, in Java's Scanner.next(), it reads the next token, separated by whitespace. So the input is two tokens: first K, then S. So in Fortran, I need to read an integer and then a string, but possibly with spaces. Wait no, in the Java code, the S is obtained via next(), which reads the next token. So the input would be like: first a number K, then a string S (without spaces). So maybe in Fortran, I can read K as an integer first, then read the string S from the same line. Or perhaps they are on separate lines? Hmm, the problem's input specification probably matters here. Well, since in the Java code it's using next(), which reads the next token (split by whitespace). So K is first, then S is the next term. So the input would be something like:\n\n3\nABCDEF\n\nBut perhaps on one line separated by space. Like: 3 ABCDEF.\n\nSo in Fortran, how to read that. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line and split it? Maybe. But maybe it's better in Fortran to read K first as an integer, then read the next word as the string. Let me think. In Fortran, using list-directed input (the * format), you can do:\n\nread(*,*) K, S\n\nBut S has to be a character variable. But how to handle when S has spaces? Probably the problem does not have spaces in S. Let me assume that S is a single token without spaces. So reading K followed by S with list-directed.\n\nBut in Fortran, the length of the character variables must be declared. So for S, maybe declare it as, say, 100 characters? Since in programming contests, usually strings aren't too big. Let me set S to be of length 1000 to be safe.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: K\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: S\n\nThen read K and S with read(*,*) K, S ?\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when using list directed input, if the variables are in a character array, it will read until end of line or until the maximum length? Not quite sure. Maybe it's safer to read the first as K then the rest as S. Alternatively, read the entire line as a string, then split it. Let me consider that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read K first:\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nthen read S. But then, if S is the next token, perhaps the rest of the line minus trailing spaces?\n\nHmm, perhaps the simplest way is to read all the input in two lines. But the problem might have the input given as two numbers, like two tokens, so the first line has K and the next the S?\n\nWait, the Java code uses the next() function which proceeds through tokens. Let me think.\n\nJava code:\n\nScanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\nint K = in.nextInt();\nString S = in.next();\n\nSo the first part is nextInt(), which reads the next integer; then next() reads the next token (the next word, separated by whitespace) as the string S. So the input could be in one line like \"5 ABCDEF\" or multiple lines.\n\nSo in Fortran code, to replicate this, after reading K, the next call reads S as the next \"word\" (without spaces). So in Fortran, maybe using a read with list-directed input for K, then another read for the S.\n\nWait, suppose K is first read with read(*,*) K. That will read the next integer, which is K, and then the rest of the line, and then S can be read as the next part. But perhaps S is on the same line after the integer. So maybe:\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nread(*, '(A)') S\n\nWait no, because then when you read K with list-directed, it reads until the next non-integer (i.e., the next token, but maybe expect the rest of the line for S? Hmm this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, read the entire line into a string buffer, strip the K part, and then parse S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps read as:\n\nread(*,*) K, S\n\nBut that might not work if S's length is too big. Wait list-directed input for strings will read all the remaining characters in that token. But the variable's length in Fortran has to be large enough. So if the S is stored in a variable of length 1000, then this could be okay.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if the length of the string S exceeds the character limit of S (e.g. 1000), then there could be overflow. But assuming the problem's constraints impose that S is within a reasonable length, like in programming contests, this shouldn't be an issue. So the plan is:\n\nDeclare variables, then read K and S using read(*,*) K,S.\n\nThen, check the length of S. If length less than or equal to K, print it. Else, print the first K characters followed by \"...\".\n\n\nNow, how to compute the length of the string. In Fortran, the function LEN_TRIM(S) might be needed because leading or trailing spaces in the storage might be padded. Alternatively, perhaps the TRIM function. Wait, the length can be found with LEN_TRIM(S). Wait, but if S is exactly filled (no trailing spaces), the intrinsic function LEN_TRIM returns the length without trailing blanks. Wait, no, LEN_TRIM is for trailing blanks. So the correct way to get the length of the string S is to use LEN_TRIM(S). Or use the LEN function, but that returns the allocated length (1000 in this case), which isn't right. So LEN_TRIM(S) gives the actual length minus trailing spaces. But in the problem's input, the string S doesn't have trailing spaces; so yes, the length is LEN_TRIM(S). Wait, but when S is read via list-directed input, any leading or trailing spaces would be ignored? Or stored?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should use the LEN_TRIM to get the actual length. Because for example, if S is read as a string of length 1000, then the value stored might have trailing spaces. For example, if the input is \"ABCD\" into a 10-length character variable, then the actual value is 'ABCD      ' (spaces added to the end). So LEN(S) is 10, but LEN_TRIM is 4.\n\nWait, so the actual length of the string is LEN_TRIM, so in the code, the comparison is between LEN_TRIM(S) and K.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nif (LEN_TRIM(S) <= K ) then ...\n\nElse, take first K characters of S, but ensure that there are no leading or trailing blanks. Wait, in the input, the string S is exactly as given, so when stored in S(1:len_trim()), the first K characters (assuming K<= len_trim(S)), but if K is longer than that, but that case is handled by the if.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simply S(1:K) will have spaces if the actual stored length is less than K?\n\nHmm perhaps better to first compute N = LEN_TRIM(S). Then if N <= K, output the entire string. Else, output first K characters plus \"...\".\n\nBut the first K characters would need to be S(1:K), but in the Fortran code, if K exceeds the actual string length, but in the else clause, only when N>K, so first K is okay.\n\nWait if S is stored as S = 'ABCD', but the declared length is 10, then S(5: something) would include spaces. So in the code path where N (LEN_TRIM(S)) is the actual length, so the first K characters will be correct, because up to N is okay.\n\nSo the plan is to compute N = LEN_TRIM(S).\n\nNow, how do I output the substring?\n\nIn Fortran, substrings are done via S(start:length). Wait, the syntax is S(start:end). For example, S(1:K) gives the first K characters.\n\nSo then, to get the first K letters, we can do S(1:K), then append \"...\" .\n\nNow, for the output:\n\nif N <= K:\n\n   write(*,*) trim(S)\n\nWait, but S may have trailing spaces. So trimming it would give the actual string. Alternatively, perhaps not necessary. So:\n\nif (N <= K) then\n\n   write(*,'(A)') S(1:N)\n\nelse\n\n   write(*,'(A,A)') S(1:K), '...'\n\nWait but maybe just S(1:K) which would be the first K characters, even if the rest have spaces, since when N>K, so K is less than N, so the K is within the actual string. Or perhaps middle spaces can be present? Wait the string input via list-directed would have been read as the actual token, so the K first characters are correct.\n\nWait let's think. Suppose the string is 'ABCDEFG', and K is 3, the first 3 characters are 'ABC', which is correct.\n\nBut the stored in the S variable (assuming len 1000) would be 'ABCDEFG   ...' (with trailing spaces after G). So S(1:3) would be 'ABC'.\n\nThus using S(1:K) is okay.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC168_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: K, N\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: S\n\nread(*,*) K, S ! this might be problematic.\n\nWait but perhaps the way of reading K and S with read(*,*) is okay?\n\nWait let me think again. Suppose the input is given on one line like \"3 ABCDEF\", then K will be read as 3, and S as \"ABCDEF\" (without the space).\n\nAlternatively, if the input for S is a string with spaces, like \"hello world\", but according to the problem's input description, since in the Java code it's using next() (the next token), then perhaps in the Fortran input, S does not contain any spaces. So in that case the code should work. So in this problem's context, using read*, K, S is acceptable.\n\nWait but perhaps the S is read with trailing space? Hmm the list-directed read for the S will read until the next whitespace. So for \"5 HIJ\" S will be \"HIJ\". So the first token is K, then S is the rest until the next whitespace (so the next token excluded). So it's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nread(*,*) K, S.\n\nSo then, N = LEN_TRIM(S).\n\nThen, if N<=k, then write S with its trimmed value, but perhaps S(1:N)? Or perhaps just the entire S, and then trim to remove any trailing spaces when writing.\n\nWait the write(*,*) statement automatically trims trailing blanks. So when you do write(*,*) S, any trailing spaces in S are ignored. So in that case, perhaps no need for explicit trimming.\n\nAlternatively, for the first case, when N <= K, the output is just the full string S (without any trailing spaces), which is same as writing the whole S, since trailing spaces would be trimmed.\n\nIn the elif path, when K is smaller than N, we have to write the first K chars of S, plus \"...\" \u2014 but perhaps S(1:K) has no trailing space (since K is within the original string's length).\n\nThus the code:\n\nif (N <= K) then:\n\n   write(*,*) S\n\nelse:\n\n   write(*,'(A,A)') S(1:K), '...' \n\nWait but in Fortran, writing with an internal format. Alternatively, better to write using list-directed output.\n\nWait the list-directed can automatically separate strings, but perhaps to concatenate, using the specific format like A is better, but maybe both can work.\n\nWait when writing S(1:K) and then '...' \u2014 but in list-directed, you can write multiple arguments, separated by spaces, so perhaps:\n\nwrite(*,*) S(1:K), '...' \n\nBut that would put those two strings with a space between? Or may be list-directed aligns correctly?\n\nWait list-directed will be free format. For example, the two arguments in write(*,*) would be written as separate entities \u2014 thus with a space between 'ABC' and '...', forming 'ABC ...' instead of 'ABC...'.\n\nSo to avoid that, need to do a formatted write, like:\n\nwrite(*,'(A,A)') S(1:K), '...'\n\nWhich will write the two together.\n\nAlternatively, concatenate the two using, for example, // operator.\n\nSo S_part = S(1:K)//'...' then write that. But have to manage character lengths.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, string concatenation is allowed.\n\nWait in Fortran 90+, can do // operations between strings. So maybe the write statement can be:\n\nwrite(*,*) S(1:K) // '...' \n\nWait that's possible, but the length of the concatenated string must not exceed the destination. Let's see:\n\nS(1:K) has length K. Then adding 3 more characters gives K+3. The destination is standard output, so it's okay as long as K+3 <= the target's capacity, which it should be given that K is up to the original S length which is 1000.\n\nSo using S(1:K)//'...' as a single argument to write would be better to avoid space between.\n\nThus, the code can have:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC168_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: K\n  character(len=1000) :: S\n  integer :: N\n  read(*,*) K, S\n  N = len_trim(S)\n  if (N <= K) then\n    write(*,*) trim(S) ! Or just S, because when using the write statement, the trailing spaces would be trimmed anyway.\n                       ! Alternatively, maybe S is sufficient.\n  else\n    write(*,*) S(1:K)//'...'\n  end if\nend program\n\nWait, but in the N <= K case, using trim(S) ensures that any trailing spaces after the original string are removed. But when using write(*,*) S, the trailing spaces are automatically omitted in list-directed output, so that's fine. So perhaps writing S is the same as trim(S) in this context. So in the then branch, write(*,*) S will display the correct string.\n\nTesting example: if K is 3 and S is 'ABC', then the code writes it as is, which is correct.\n\nElse, if S is \"ABCDEF\", K is 3, then first 3 'ABC' concatenate with '...' to get 'ABC...'.\n\nSo that code should work.\n\nNow, I should check for edge cases, like when K is exactly the length of S. Then it's printed as is.\n\nAnother edge case: S length exactly K, so output is the string. If K is 0, but according to the problem's constraints, K is probably a positive integer? The code handles that anyway.\n\nAnother consideration: the length of S must be read properly. If the input S is longer than the declared 1000, then we have an problem. But again, in programming contests, usually the input constraints specify that S's length is manageable, so this should suffice.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nNow, in Fortran, the program structure:\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe translated Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC168_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: K\n  character(len=1000) :: S\n  integer :: N\n\n  read(*,*) K, S\n  N = len_trim(S)\n  if (N <= K) then\n    write(*,*) trim(S)  ! Or just S? But trimming is safer to avoid any trailing spaces.\n  else\n    write(*,*) S(1:K) // '...'\n  end if\nend program atcoder_ABC168_B\n\nWait, but when using 'write(*,*) trim(S)'\u2014 but if I just write S, list-directed output will trim automatically, so maybe trim is unneeded here. However, to prevent any possible leading or trailing characters from being read incorrectly, but in the read(*,*) statement, list directed input already takes the actual string without leading/trailing spaces, so S's content is exactly the string. Wait no, the problem is that in the character variable S, the data is stored as the actual token read, but padded with blanks to the right (since the variable is LEN=1000). Thus, when you access S, (say) if the string was 'ABC', then S would have 'ABC' followed by spaces. The LEN_TRIM gives the actual length without the trailing spaces.\n\nSo when reading S, if you then write S, without using LEN_TRIM slicing, the trailing spaces might be omitted in the output due to list-directed, but if using something else, they might not be.\n\nBut the problem requires that the output is exactly the original string if it's short enough, which would be achieved by writing S. For example, if it is length 5, then the write statement will show all 5 characters and skip the rest.\n\nWait in the code above, the program:\n\nSuppose S is 'ABCD' (stored in 1000 length variable as 'ABCD    ...'), then write(*,*) S will output exactly 'ABCD' (without the trailing spaces). So trimming is not needed here, since the output will do that automatically.\n\nSo trimming in the output is redundant here. Thus, to keep it simple, just write(*,*) S is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the code can be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC168_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: K\n  character(len=1000) :: S\n\n  read(*,*) K, S\n  if (len_trim(S) <= K) then\n    write(*,*) S\n  else\n    write(*,*) S(1:K) // '...'\n  end if\nend program atcoder_ABC168_B\n\nWait even simpler, since we don't need to store N.\n\nThat's better, that way, we avoid an N variable.\n\nYes, that's better, as checking len_trim(S) directly.\n\nThus, the code can be written as such.\n\nTesting that.\n\nLet me see.\n\nExample 1: K=2, S= \"abc\", len_trim(S)=3, so else clause:\n\nprints first 2 chars \"ab\" followed by \"...\" \u2192 \"ab...\".\n\nExample2: K=3, S=\"ABC\", so the first case, prints \"ABC\" exactly.\n\nAnother edge case, K=0 is allowed? Maybe not, but the code handles it by printing the full string.\n\nWhat if the string has trailing spaces? Well, according to the read behavior, when using list-directed read, the trailing spaces are NOT part of the string. Because when reading a character variable with list-directed input, it reads the next token, so any trailing spaces in the input are not part of the token? Or are they considered?\n\nWait, let me clarify how list-directed input works for character variables.\n\nIn list-directed input, when reading a character variable, the input record is scanned for the next character string (non-whitespace sequence), which is assigned to the variable. The trailing spaces are NOT part of the character sequence. Hence, if the input has spaces after S, they are not part of S.\n\nTherefore, the LEN_TRIM(S) is exactly the length of the input string S.\n\nThus the code is safe.\n\nTherefore this should work."
