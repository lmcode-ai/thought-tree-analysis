Wait for n=3, mid is 2 which is in allowed range. For n=1, the code may have n mod 2 is 1, so then mid is (1+1)/2=1. But in that case, the loops would count for rows between 2 and 0, not considering bannedRows at 1. So perhaps, but the code would work as per problem constraints. Thus correcting the code to use the COUNT intrinsic would be better. So modifying the code: Substituting the loops:\n\ncount_rows = count( bannedR(2 : n-1) )\n\ncount_cols = count( bannedC(2 : n-1) ) Since BannedR(2) is true etc. So yes.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding the problem first. The Java code is solving a problem where given a grid, some rows and columns are banned. The goal is to calculate the number of valid positions under certain conditions. \n\nFirst, let's go through the Java code step by step to understand what's happening:\n\nThe main part reads n and m. Then it loops m times, reading pairs of r and c. It adds those to sets if r and c are between 1 and n (specifically, not on the edges). Then it calculates the answer as (n-2)*2 minus the sizes of the banned rows and columns. If n is odd, there's an adjustment involving the middle row and column.\n\nHmm. So the Fortran translation needs to do the same. \n\nNow, considering the constraints of Fortran:\n\n- Fortran works with dynamic data structures like sets? Not natively. Oh right! Wait, in Fortran up to 2008, there's no built-in hash sets. So I need to represent banned rows and columns in some other way. Maybe using arrays with a flag indicating presence or not.\n\nAlternatively, since the constraints might be up to a certain n (since the problem comes from Codeforces, perhaps n is up to say 1e5?), but if n is large, we can't allocate a big array. Wait, but the problem's variables: rows and columns go up to n. Wait looking at the Java code, for the banned rows, when they read r and c from input, and check if r>1 and r <n (so they are adding it to banned rows if it's a middle row). Wait the condition is if r is between 2 and n-1 (since >1 and <n), same for column. \n\nWait the actual condition for adding to bannedRows is if r is between 2 and n-1? Wait the code says:\n\nif (r > 1 && r < n) bannedRows.add(r);\n\nWait n is the size of the grid. So rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n (possibly). So, for example, if n=8, a row 4 would be added to banned rows. But edge rows (1 and 8) are not added. Wait that code's logic is correct? Wait because the code wants to track rows and columns that are part of the \"non-edge\" rows, which are the ones contributing to the (n-2) terms. Because the initial answer is (n-2)*2, perhaps.\n\nAnyway, in the Fortran code, the problem is how to store these banned rows and columns. Perhaps we can use an array of booleans where the index represents the row or column number, but since row numbers can be as big as n (could be up to maybe 1e5?), but in practice for Codeforces problems, maybe n can be big. Wait the original problem might be similar to Codeforces problem 333B? Let me think. Since the user's code starts with 'codeforces_333_B', so the problem is problem B from 333 contest. \n\nLooking up problem B of 333, I recall that the actual problem is: you have an n x n grid where certain barriers are placed between squares. You need to count the number of \"holes\", but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem here is about counting certain cells that are not blocked. Wait according to the user's code, the original problem probably involves the need to find how many positions are neither in the banned rows or columns, but within the corners?\n\nWait maybe the code is calculating the number of positions on the perimeter minus the banned ones. \n\nLet me get back to translating the code. \n\nIn Fortran, variables are statically typed. For loops and control structures are a bit different. Let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, the code:\n\nPublic class ... has a FastReader and PrintWriter. The main function reads n and m, then m times reads r and c. For each r and c pair, adds to the sets if r is between 2 and n-1 (and same for c). Then compute answer.\n\nBut in Fortran, standard input and output would be done via read(*,*) and write(*,*) with variables. So, the code can do without the FastReader class (since Fortran has built-in input methods).\n\nFirst, variables: n, m. Then, for banned rows and cols. Since Java uses hash sets, we need an alternative.\n\nOption: Since the rows and columns can be up to n, and n can be large (like 1e5?), maybe an array based approach is better. For example, create arrays (logical arrays) to mark which rows and columns are banned. Since the code adds the row to bannedRows only if 2<=r <=n-1, so the array for rows should be of size at least n. Initially all elements are set to .false., then for each r (after checking if between 2 and n-1), set the corresponding row index to .true. \n\nWait rows and columns are 1-based (as in Java). So for row number 1 to n. The arrays would be from 1 to n. \n\nSo:\n\nFirst, declare arrays (LOGICAL) rows and cols for banned rows and columns. Let's say rows is length n+1 since n can be up to something? Wait the array indices can start at 1 for rows and cols.\n\nWait in Fortran, we can dimension rows(1:n), cols(1:n). But n is determined at runtime. Oh, but in Fortran, you can have allocation with ALLOCATE. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Allocate two logical arrays: bannedRows and bannedCols, each of size n.\n\n- Initialize all entries to .FALSE.\n\n- Then read m pairs (r, c). For each:\n\n   if r is between 2 and (n-1), then set bannedRows(r) to .TRUE.\n\n   same for c and cols array?\n\nWait in the Java code: \n\nThe Java code adds to bannedRows only if (r > 1 and r <n). Wait the code is:\n\nif (r >1 && r <n) bannedRows.add(r)\n\nWait, meaning, only add if r is strictly between 1 and n. So r is 2 to n-1.\n\nYes exactly. Similarly for column c's check. \n\nSo for each r input, if it's between 2 and n-1 (inclusive), then it's a candidate to be banned in the rows array (if not already present). \n\nWait in the Java code, it's stored as a HashSet, which is a set. So if two pairs have the same r within that range, it's only counted once. So the problem is that in Fortran, when we use an array, it's possible to set the same index multiple times. Since the Set adds each element once. \n\nThus in Fortran, each row number between 2 and n-1 must be set to True if it's part of at least one input. Since each occurrence of r in that range would be added once to the set. \n\nSo in the Fortran code, for each r and c read, we can check the condition and set bannedRows(r) to .TRUE., but only if r is in the allowed range. \n\nSo in Fortran code, for each of m steps:\n\nread(r, c)\n\nif (r >=2 .and. r <=n-1) then\n\n    bannedRows(r) = .true.\n\nendif\n\nSimilarly for c.\n\nThen, the size of the set is essentially the number of entries in bannedRows between 2 and n-1 that are set to True. Wait the initial arrays for bannedRows and bannedCols are of size n, and the indices from 2 to n-1 are the ones that matter. \n\nThe Java's bannedRows.size() is counting all elements in the set, which in the Fortran's term is the count of True in bannedRows(2..n-1). \n\nWait, but in Java's code, the bannedRows is a HashSet, so every correct r is added once. Therefore, the number of elements in bannedRows would be exactly the sum over r=2 to r =n-1 of bannedRows(r).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the size can be calculated with a loop counting how many are true between 2 and n-1 in each array.\n\nAlternatively, to optimize, we can pre-count the number of True entries. How?\n\nAlternatively, during the reading phase, we can track the count.\n\nWait, maybe in the Fortran code, during the reading, for each input r and c, \n\nwe can check, for r, if it's in the valid range (2 to n-1), then set the flag and increment the bannedR count.\n\nBut duplicates? \n\nSuppose in Java, if multiple m entries have the same r, like two entries with r=3 (within range), then in the hash set, bannedRows will have r=3 just once, so bannedRows.size would have it as 1. \n\nIn Fortran, if we do:\n\nfor each r:\n\nif it's in the valid range (2 to n-1), \n\n   then if bannedRows(r) is .FALSE., then set it to .TRUE. and add 1 to count (or increment count each time?)\n\nWait perhaps:\n\nInitialize: count_banned_rows = 0 \n\netc.\n\nWait perhaps it's easier to first allocate the arrays, read all the inputs and set the flags. Then count the number of entries set to true in those arrays for the relevant ranges.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Declare and allocate arrays: bannedR (logical: size n), bannedC (logical size n). Initialize all to .false.\n\n3. Initialize variables:\n\n   countR =0, countC =0\n\n4. For i in 1 to m:\n\n   read the r and c.\n\n   if r is between 2 and n-1:\n\n      if bannedR(r) is false before this:\n\n          set to .true. and countR +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          do nothing, it was already counted\n\n   similarly for c.\n\nWait but in the java code adding only r's between 2 and n-1. The check is to add to the set only if the condition is true. \n\nAlternatively, even if same r comes multiple times, the count is the same.\n\nThe problem with Fortran's array approach is that to count the unique entries, we can iterate from 1 to n and count how many in 2 to n-1 are .true.\n\nWait but that would be better. \n\nBecause if we have to count all the banned rows in the range 2<=r <=n-1 that are set to true, we can simply loop over r=2 to n-1 and count the number of true entries.\n\nSame for columns.\n\nTherefore in code:\n\ncompute count_rows = sum(1 for r=2 to n-1 if bannedRows(r))\n\ncount_cols = same for columns.\n\nThen, the 'size' of the set is count_rows and count_cols.\n\nTherefore perhaps the array approach is workable even for large n.\n\nNow, the problem is memory. But with n up to say 1e5, having two arrays of logicals (which take 1 byte each or 1 bit) would be manageble. Let's see for n=1e5, the arrays would be 1e5 elements. Each logical in Fortran is typically 1 byte, so 2e5 bytes ~ 200 KB which is acceptable.\n\nSo proceed with that approach.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m. Then initialize the arrays.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic allocation is required since n is read at runtime.\n\nSo:\n\nallocate arrays of size n.\n\nNow, the code in fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_333_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i, r, c\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: bannedR, bannedC\n\ninteger :: count_rows, count_cols, answer, mid\n\n!\n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\nallocate( bannedR(n) )\n\nallocate( bannedC(n) )\n\nbannedR = .false.\n\nbannedC = .false.\n\ndo i = 1, m\n\n   read(*,*) r, c\n\n   if ( r >=2 .and. r <=n-1 ) then\n\n      bannedR(r) = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   if ( c >=2 .and. c <=n-1 ) then\n\n      bannedC(c) = .true.\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\n! Now count bannedR in 2 to n-1 ?\n\ncount_rows = 0\n\ndo i=2, n-1\n\n   if ( bannedR(i) ) then\n\n      count_rows = count_rows + 1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\ncount_cols =0\n\ndo i=2, n-1\n\n   if ( bannedC(i) ) then\n\n      count_cols = count_cols +1\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nanswer = (n-2)*2\n\nanswer = answer - count_rows\n\nanswer = answer - count_cols\n\n! Then, check if even or odd\n\nif ( mod(n,2) == 1 ) then\n\n   mid = (n +1)/2\n\n   ! check if both bannedR(mid) and bannedC(mid) are not set\n\n   if ( .not.bannedR(mid) .and. .not.bannedC(mid) ) then\n\n      answer = answer -1\n\n   end if\n\nend if\n\nwrite(*,*) answer\n\ndeallocate(bannedR, bannedC)\n\nend program\n\nWait but what about if n is 1? But probably from the code's logic, if n <3 then n-2 is negative, but let's see. The problem constraints might ensure n >= something? Probably in the problem's constraints, n is at least 3 or so? Or the code can handle it?\n\nWell the code as is can be.\n\nNow, checking code for possible issues:\n\nIn the Java code, the for loop starts at i=0 to m-1. Wait in the code, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < m; i++) \n\nwhich runs m times, reading r and c each time. So in the Fortran loop, the same: do i= 1 to m.\n\nSo that's taken care of.\n\nWait the Java's code for each of m entries reads two numbers per iteration. The code's in.nextInt() is incremented. So the Fortran code in each loop iteration reads r and c from input correctly.\n\nAlso, in the Java code, for each iteration:\n\nCode is:\n\nint r = in.nextInt();\n\nif (r >1 && r <n) bannedRows.add(r);\n\nint c = in.nextInt();\n\nif (c>...) ... \n\nWait so in Java, first reads r, then checks (based on r), then reads c?\n\nWait, exactly. The Java code reads r and c in pairs. \n\nTherefore in the Fortran code, each iteration reads r and c (as two integers inputted on a line each?), assuming input is given with pairs on separate lines or on same lines? Well the problem statement probably inputs each line as space-separated pairs.\n\nJava's FastReader's nextInt will split tokens correctly. So the Fortran code must also read two numbers on each iteration. So in Fortran, the read(*,*) r, c in each loop would take both integers correctly.\n\nThen, setting bannedR(r) to true when r is in allowed range, same for columns.\n\nThe logic for the mid point: when n is odd.\n\nMid is (n+1)/2 since in Fortran integer division is truncating. So for even n, the mod will be 0, the block is skipped.\n\nWait in Java, (n+1)/2 when n is odd gives the middle column. \n\nNow, the condition: \n\nif the mid is not in bannedRows (i.e., bannedR(mid) is false) AND mid is not in bannedCols (similar), then the answer is reduced by 1.\n\nWait because in that case, that position would have been subtracted?\n\nWait the original Java code's logic:\n\nIn the code:\n\n if (mid is not in bannedRows and mid is not in bannedCols)\n\n the answer-- ?\n\nWait yes, exactly.\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nif (n %2 !=0):\n\n   mid = (n+1)/2\n\n   if NOT (bannedRows contains mid) AND NOT (bannedCols contains mid):\n\n       then subtract 1 from answer.\n\nWhich translates to what the Fortran code has.\n\nAlso:\n\nThe initial answer is (n-2)*2 minus the counts of the banned rows and columns.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTesting edge cases: For example when n=3. The banned rows 2 can be added if any of the input r is 2.\n\nIf mid is 2. So if (2 is not banned in rows and columns, then subtract 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo looking good. \n\nAnother possible problem: The initial answer is (n-2)*2, which is correct?\n\nYes, since (n-2) is the count of interior rows (since rows and columns from 2 to n-1. But that part is counted twice? Let me think. The initial answer is the total available positions in the perimeter minus the banned regions?\n\nWait in the problem statement (assuming this is problem 333B), perhaps the problem is about counting squares that are \"inside a rectangle created by the edges\".\n\nWait the problem from Codeforces 333B is called \"Greg the Dwarf and Polygon\". Let me think. Alternatively, the problem may be \"Greg and the permutation\" but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the code's logic.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may require to compute the number of \"safe cells\" where when placed certain positions in the grid which are in the borders except corners or ... but perhaps looking at the code's calculation:\n\nThe initial answer is (n-2)*2, so for a 5x5 grid that's 3*2 = 6. Then subtract the number of banned rows (those between 2-4?) subtract and then also banned columns.\n\nWait perhaps the answer is counting the outer layer's cells except the four corners. Let me think, in an n x n grid, the perimeter has 4*(n-1) cells, except the four corners are wrapped. So each side has (n-2) non-corner cells. So total 4*(n-2) = 4n -8?\n\nWait, the original code's answer is starting with (n-2)*2, which is 2n-4. Hmm perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait maybe the code is not counting perimeter cells, but only certain lines?\n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that the number of forbidden positions which are in the \"inner\" positions of the edges? Let me think. Alternatively, the formula (n-2)*2 could be the initial count from two sides? Like for each side (left, top etc.?)\n\nWell, the code seems correct as per the problem's requirements, so even without knowing the problem statement directly, the code is translated properly.\n\nNow, the translation proceeds as above. Now, some coding steps:\n\nNeed to make sure in Fortran that the variables are declared correctly. \n\nAlso, in the code's for loops counting the rows and cols: the loop for rows is i from 2 to n-1, counting all the banned rows in that range.\n\nWait for example, if r was in the banned range? For example, the bannedRows array is set based on whether r is in 2..n-1. The loop for counting is over all possible r in that range. \n\nThus correct.\n\nWhat about when n is 2? Then n-2 is 0, and 2..n-1 would be 2 to 1 which in Fortran the do loop will run only if initial >=final? So the loop for counting will not execute, so count_rows is zero, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if n is less than 2, but according to problem constraints m possibly can be zero?\n\nBut in any case, code is safe.\n\nMid: when n is even, the if condition is skipped. That is correct.\n\nNow, putting all this into Fortran code. \n\nAnother possible optimization: the count can be done with array functions in Fortran, if allowed?\n\nLike sum(bannedR(2:n-1)), assuming that the syntax allows that. However, I think in older standards that might not be possible. \n\nAlternatively, for Fortran 90 and above, we can use count with an array section.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\ncount_rows = count(bannedR(2:n-1) )\n\nso that's shorter. \n\nYes, so that could simplify.\n\nSame for count_cols.\n\nSo in the code, those loops can be replaced with integral_count:\n\ncount_rows = count(bannedR(2 : n-1))\n\n similarly for columns.\n\nThat would be better. Since it's more concise and efficient.\n\nSimilarly, then the last condition:\n\nmid = (n+1)/2\n\nthe check mid being between 2 and n-1? Wait n is odd, so for n >=3, mid will be in that range. So the check is valid.\n\nWait for n=3, mid is 2 which is in allowed range. For n=1, the code may have n mod 2 is 1, so then mid is (1+1)/2=1. But in that case, the loops would count for rows between 2 and 0, not considering bannedRows at 1. So perhaps, but the code would work as per problem constraints.\n\nThus correcting the code to use the COUNT intrinsic would be better.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nSubstituting the loops:\n\ncount_rows = count( bannedR(2 : n-1) )\n\ncount_cols = count( bannedC(2 : n-1) )\n\nSince BannedR(2) is true etc. So yes. \n\nThen in the mid test:\n\nThe code must check whether bannedR(mid) is false and bannedC(mid) is also false.\n\nThus, in Fortran,\n\nif ( .not. bannedR(mid) .and. .not. bannedC(mid) ) then\n\nthis would be the condition.\n\nThus putting the improved code.\n\nNow the complete Fortran code:\n\nAlso, in Fortran variables must be declared before use, so the order matters.\n\nAlso, variables like mid must be declared as integer.\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_333_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, m, i, r, c\n  logical, allocatable :: bannedR(:), bannedC(:)\n  integer :: count_r, count_c, answer, mid\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n\n  allocate(bannedR(n))\n  allocate(bannedC(n))\n\n  bannedR = .false.\n  bannedC = .false.\n\n  do i = 1, m\n    read(*,*) r, c\n    if (r >= 2 .and. r <= n-1) then\n      bannedR(r) = .true.\n    end if\n    if (c >= 2 .and. c <= n-1) then\n      bannedC(c) = .true.\n    end if\n  end do\n\n  count_r = count(bannedR(2 : n-1))\n  count_c = count(bannedC(2 : n-1))\n\n  answer = (n - 2) * 2 - count_r - count_c\n\n  if (mod(n,2) == 1) then\n    mid = (n + 1) / 2\n    if (.not. bannedR(mid) .and. .not. bannedC(mid)) then\n      answer = answer - 1\n    end if\n  end if\n\n  write(*,*) answer\n\n  deallocate(bannedR, bannedC)\nend program\n\nYes, that should be correct. \n\nNow, some possible test cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn = 3, m =1, r=2, c=2. \n\nthen bannedR will have r=2 stored. count_r is 1, count_c 1.\n\nAnswer initially (3-2)*2 = 2. Subtract 1+1 \u2192 0. Then since n is odd, mid is 2. \n\nCheck whether bannedR(2) is true and bannedC(2) is true \u2192 so condition is false. thus answer remains 0 \u2192 output 0.\n\nAlternatively, if r and c were 3 and 3 (invalid for adding to bannedRows), but for m=1 and input r=2, c=3. Then c> (3-1 is 2). c=3 would be beyond n-1=2, so only bannedR's count is 1, bannedC count is 0. Answer is 2-1-0=1. Then, since n is odd, check mid is 2. \n\nbannedR(2) is true (since it was set), so bannedR(2). Thus, the mid's row and column are part of bannedR \u2192 no subtraction. The final answer would be 1.\n\nAnother test case where everything is allowed:\n\nFor n=5, and m=0. So the total is (5-2)*2 =6. Subtract 0+0 \u2192 6. Since n is odd, mid is3. Neither banned so subtract 1 \u2192 total 5?\n\nWait wait wait. Wait let me think again:\n\nIf no banned rows or cols:\n\nanswer is (5-2)*2 \u21923*2=6. subtract 0:6. Then since n is odd, mid=3. Not banned in any, so subtract 1. So final answer is 6-1=5.\n\nWait why?\n\nPossibly the problem counts a certain position at mid as part of the initial count? Hmm. \n\nIn this case, when there are no forbidden places, the final answer is (n-2)*2 minus 0 minus 0, minus 1 if odd.\n\nIn this case, it gives 5. \n\nSo perhaps in the problem, when adding the mid point, it's subtracting because it's counting that position in the initial count as something to exclude? That might be part of the problem details, but that is part of the code's logic and thus the translation correctly replicates that.\n\nThus the Fortran code should work."
