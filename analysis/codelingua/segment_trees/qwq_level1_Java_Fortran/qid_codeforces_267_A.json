    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java program reads an integer n from the user. Then, for each of the next n lines, it reads two integers a and b. For each pair, it calls a method called sub and prints the result.\n\nThe sub method takes two integers a and b and calculates some value. Let me look more closely into the sub function:\n\nInside sub(a, b), it first computes the minimum of a and b as 'min' and the maximum as 'max'. Then, it initializes result to 0. Then, in a while loop that continues while min is greater than 0:\n\nInside the loop, it adds max divided by min to the result. Then, it sets max to max modulo min. Then, it updates min and max by swapping if needed (using Math.min and max again on the new min and max). So, this looks similar to the Euclidean algorithm for GCD, but the result is accumulating the quotient each step. Wait, the Euclidean algorithm computes GCD by repeatedly dividing the larger by the smaller and taking remainder. But here, each step they add the quotient (max/min) to the result. So the result would be the sum of the quotients in each step of the GCD computation?\n\nHmm, but the loop continues until min becomes 0, so the last non-zero max would be the GCD, but the sum of the quotients is tracked. So the function returns this sum plus maybe other terms?\n\nIn any case, I need to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, the main program structure in Fortran.\n\nJava's Scanner is used to read inputs. Fortran typically reads from the standard input using read statements. Since Fortran has no objects, functions can be written as functions outside or inside the program. Let's see.\n\nThe main part can be a program block. The first thing is to read n, then loop n times. In each iteration, read a and b, call the equivalent of the sub function, then print the result.\n\nFirst, the function sub needs to be translated. In Fortran, functions can be written similarly, but the syntax is different.\n\nLooking at the function sub in Java:\n\nIt uses Math.min and Math.max. In Fortran, min and max can be achieved with intrinsic functions. Wait, but in Fortran, there are min and max intrinsics, but we can also use if statements. Since in the code, Math.min(a,b) can be written as min(a,b) in Fortran, but wait: Fortran has the amin1 and amax0 functions in some versions, but actually for integers, the MIN() and MAX() functions are available but can take two arguments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the intrinsic functions. Let me check the syntax:\n\nThe function's variables are integers, a and b. Then min and max.\n\nIn the loop, in each step, the code does:\n\nresult += max / min;\n\nThen:\n\nmax = max % min\n\nWait, in Java, the % operator for integers is the remainder. So in Fortran, the modulo operation can be done with mod(max, min). But wait, the % in Fortran is exponent operator, so modulo is mod(a,b). The remainder can sometimes be different based on negative numbers, but since the problem may only deal with positive integers, I think mod is okay here.\n\nThen, after computing max modulo min, the code sets the new min and max as the min and max of the previous min and the new max (result of mod). But the loop continues until min becomes zero.\n\nWait, the steps inside the loop:\n\nLet me step through an example to see what's happening. Suppose a=2 and b=5.\n\nInitial min =2, max=5.\n\nresult starts at 0.\n\nresult += 5/2 \u2192 2. So result becomes 2. Then max becomes 5 mod 2 =1. Then, the new min and max are min(2,1)=1 and max(2,1)=2. Wait, no. Wait the new max and min after the mod step:\n\nThe new values for min and max would be the previous max mod min (which is 1 here) and the previous min is still 2?\n\nWait let me retrace:\n\nAfter first iteration:\n\nmax was 5, min 2.\n\nAfter max % min \u2192 5 mod 2 is 1. So new max is that mod, but then, we set curr_min as the min of min (2) and the new max (1). So curr_min is 1, curr_max is 2. So now min becomes 1 and max becomes 2.\n\nWait, so now min=1, max=2.\n\nNext iteration: min is still >0.\n\nresult += (2/1) \u2192 2, so total now 2+2=4.\n\nThen, max mod min is 2 mod 1 is 0. Then, new curr_min is min(1,0)=0, and curr_max is max(1,0)=1.\n\nSo after that, min is set to 0. So the next iteration, the while loop (which checks if min is >0) will stop.\n\nWait so the total result is 2 (from first step) +2 (second step)=4? So for a=2 and b=5, the function returns 4?\n\nHmm interesting. So the sum of the quotients in each step of the Euclidean algorithm, including the steps until min becomes zero.\n\nBut in this case, steps would be:\n\n5 divided by 2 \u2192 quotient 2, remainder 1.\n\nThen 2 divided by 1 \u2192 quotient 2, remainder 0. So sum is 2+2=4. Yep.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=7:\n\n3 and 7 \u2192 min 3, max 7.\n\nstep 1: 7//3 \u21922, remainder 1 \u2192 add 2 to result. Now result 2.\n\nNow new min is 1 (min of 3 and 1?), no wait:\n\nWait after first step:\n\nmax (7) mod min (3) is 1. So the new max and min become min(3,1)=1 and new max is 3.\n\nWait: no, after the mod, the previous min is 3 (from the current step), and the new max (after mod) is 1. So, the next assignment:\n\ncurr_min = min(3,1) \u2192 1.\n\ncurr_max = max(3,1) \u21923.\n\nWait no: the variables are min and max, after mod operation, so after the first step:\n\nold max=7 divided by old min=3, so result +=7/3 \u21922. Then the next max is 3 (the old min), since swapping them?\n\nWait perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me track step by step.\n\nOriginal a:3, b:7.\n\nmin =3 (a is min), max =7 ( max).\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nresult +=7/3 \u21922 \u2192 total becomes 2.\n\nThen: new_max =7 mod 3 = 1.\n\nThen, curr_min is min(3,1)=1 (old min was 3, new max is1)? No, after the mod, the new variables' min and max are min(old min, new remainder).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nAfter the first step:\n\nThe new values:\n\nmax was 7, then max mod min (3) gives 1, and the previous min is now becoming 3? Or wait, after computing the remainder (1), the next step is to set min and max to the old min and the remainder?\n\nWait I think the loop variables are updated as follows:\n\nWait in the code, after computing max mod min =1 (in first step here):\n\nmax = mod(old_max, old_min) \u2192 which is 1.\n\nThen, curr_min = min( the old min (min)? So the new min and max are min (min, max mod min ) and their max?\n\nWait, let me look at the code again:\n\nIn Java:\n\nAfter the max = max % min, they compute:\n\ncurr_min = Math.min( min, max );\n\ncurr_max = Math.max( min, max );\n\nWait, after the first step, the max becomes 1, and the old min was 3.\n\nSo:\n\ncurrent min and max are 3 and 1 (since max is now 1). So curr_min = min(3, 1)=1, curr_max = max(3,1)=3. Then set min = curr_min (1), max = curr_max (3). So next iteration, min is 1, max is 3.\n\nWait next iteration:\n\nmin is 1>0: so continue the loop.\n\nresult +=3/1 \u21923/1 is 3, so total is 2 +3=5.\n\nthen compute new_max as 3 mod 1 \u21920.\n\nthen curr_min is min(1,0) \u21920, curr_max 1.\n\nso then min becomes 0, so the next loop check: min is no longer >0 \u2192 exit.\n\nThus total is 5.\n\nWait, but then for a=3, b=7, the sub(a,b) is 2+3=5?\n\nYes.\n\nHmm, but what's the point? The function is returning the sum of the quotients in each step of the Euclidean algorithm until the remainder is zero.\n\nSo that's the key.\n\nNow, translating the Java function to Fortran.\n\nFirst, the main program.\n\nIn Fortran, the main program can be written as:\n\nprogram codeforces_267_A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, a, b, res\n  ! Also need the function sub, which must be defined before it's called or in a separate module.\n\nBut since it's in the Java code as a static method, in Fortran, that would be a subroutine or function declared in the same program.\n\nAlternatively, the function sub can be an integer function. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the declaration for the function.\n\nThe function sub(a,b) takes two integer arguments a and b and returns an integer.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\ninteger function sub(a, b)\n  integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n  ! declarations here\n  ! code goes here\nend function sub\n\nBut functions need to be declared before the program uses them, or in a module. Since we're writing everything in one file, it's better to put the function before the main program or inside a module.\n\nAlternatively, since in older Fortran standards, functions have to be declared at the top. Let me try structuring the code.\n\nThe main program:\n\nprogram codeforces_267_A\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, a, b\n  integer :: i\n\n  read*, n\n  do i = 1, n\n    read*, a, b\n    print*, sub(a, b)\n  enddo\n\ncontains\n\n  integer function sub(a, b)\n    integer, intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer :: min_val, max_val, result, curr_min, curr_max\n    ! initialize min and max\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n    result = 0\n    do while (min_val > 0)\n        result = result + (max_val / min_val)\n        ! compute remainder max mod min_val\n        curr_max = mod(max_val, min_val)\n        ! Now, swap the values for next iteration? Wait, similar steps as in Java:\n\n        ! After getting the remainder, next step is new min and max:\n        ! new numbers are min_val and curr_max (the remainder)\n        curr_min = min( min_val, curr_max )\n        curr_max = max( min_val, curr_max )\n        min_val = curr_min\n        max_val = curr_max\n    enddo\n    sub = result\n  end function sub\n\nend program codeforces_267_A\n\nWait, but let me look back at Java code's sub function:\n\nWait when they set the new min and max after mod.\n\nWait in the Java code's sub function:\n\nAfter max = max % min, they get the new remainder, then they compute curr_min as Math.min(min, max). The old min is min_val, but the new max after mod is max modulo min_val \u2192 which is curr_max here, but in the code above, perhaps the variables are handled differently.\n\nWait let me track variables precisely:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nIn each iteration:\n\nresult += max/min; then\n\nmax = max % min;\n\nThen, compute curr_min = min( min, max )\n\ncurr_max = max( min, max )\n\nThen, set min = curr_min, max = curr_max.\n\nSo in code variables:\n\nLoop step:\n\nLoop runs while min > 0.\n\nInside loop:\n\nAfter division and mod:\n\nOriginal variables are:\n\nAt the start of the loop iteration:\n\nmin and max are current values. After those steps:\n\nnew_max = max % min;\n\nOnce we compute that, the next step is to determine the new min and max for the next iteration. So the new pair becomes (min, new_max). But since new_max might be less than min or not, so swap if needed.\n\nWait, Wait:\n\nAfter the mod, the next remainder (max%min) is new_max (could be 0?), but the next \"a\" and \"b\" would be the previous min and the remainder?\n\nWait in the code, after getting new_max (which is the remainder from max and min):\n\ncurr_min is min of min and new_max (since their order swaps?), and curr_max then the opposite?\n\nWait the Java steps after mod:\n\nAfter max becomes max%min ( new_max ), then:\n\nnew_pair: the new \"a\" and \"b\" are min and new_max? Because in the Euclidean algorithm, after dividing a and b where a is bigger, you take b and a mod b. Wait, maybe I should think of the next iteration's min and max.\n\nWait let me recheck with the variables in code structure.\n\nWait after setting max = max % min:\n\nNow, the old a (which was min) and the new_max (the remainder). Now, these two numbers become next min and max.\n\nSo the new 'a' is min_val and new 'b' is max_val (the remainder). Thus, the next min and max must be the minimal and maximal of those two?\n\nWait the next min is the minimum between the previous min (the min_val) and the new_max (the mod). The next max is the maximum between the previous min and the mod.\n\nWait yes. So the new min and max are the min and max of (old_min, remainder).\n\nTherefore, the code in Java performs that with curr_min and curr_max variables, then assigns min and max.\n\nSo in the code, in the loop:\n\ntemp_max = max % min_val (Java code's max was the max_val )\n\nthen, curr_min = Math.min( min_val, temp_max )\n\ncurr_max = Math.max(min_val, temp_max )\n\nThen assign min_val = curr_min, and max_val = curr_max.\n\nSo the steps are exactly as in the code I wrote above in the Fortran function.\n\nWait in the Fortran code I wrote earlier, in each iteration:\n\n- The result is accumulated with max_val / min_val.\n\n- Then compute the remainder using mod(max_val, min_val) \u2192 curr_max.\n\nWait wait, in the Fortran's mod(max_val, min_val) is the same as Java's max % min_val.\n\nYes. Then, we set curr_min and curr_max as min and max of min_val and curr_max (the remainder).\n\nThen set min_val = curr_min, max_val = curr_max.\n\nBut in the code I wrote, perhaps the variables' names are handled correctly.\n\nWait let me test with the previous example:\n\na=2, b=5:\n\ninitially min_val =2, max_val=5.\n\nLoop runs because 2>0 \u2192 yes.\n\nresult +=5/2 \u21922 (so result becomes 2).\n\nThen compute curr_max = mod(5,2) \u21921.\n\ncurr_min = min(2,1) \u21921.\n\ncurr_max (in new step) \u2192max(2,1)=2.\n\nWait no, variables:\n\ncurr_min and curr_max in the code were:\n\ncurr_min = min( min_val (2), curr_max (1) )\n\ncurr_max is set to max( min_val (2), curr_max (1)), so indeed 2 and 1 \u2192 min is 1, max is 2.\n\nTherefore new min_val is 1, new max_val is 2.\n\nSecond iteration: min_val is 1>0 \u2192yes.\n\nresult += 2/1 =2 \u2192 total now 4.\n\ncurr_max = mod(2,1) \u21920.\n\ncurr_min = min(1, 0) \u21920.\n\ncurr_max = max(1,0)=1.\n\nso new min_val =0, max_val=1.\n\nNow the while loop condition is min_val >0 \u2192 no (since min is 0), so loop exits.\n\nSo total result is 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Fortran.\n\nThe code above in Fortran has variables:\n\nsub(a, b) function.\n\nWait one thing: in Fortran, intrinsic functions min and max are for two arguments, since in the function, the starting min_val is min(a,b), max_val is max(a,b). Then, in the loop steps, when computing curr_min and curr_max, which are min and max of min_val and curr_max (the remainder).\n\nWait: in the code block I wrote earlier, curr_max (variable) was set as mod(max_val, min_val). Wait, in Fortran:\n\nYes, in the code:\n\ncurr_max = mod(max_val, min_val)\n\nThen:\n\ncurr_min = min( min_val, curr_max )\n\ncurr_max = max( min_val, curr_max )\n\nWait no, perhaps I mixed variable names.\n\nWait let me look again at the code:\n\nInside the function loop:\n\nAfter computing the remainder (max_val % min_val), which is stored in the variable curr_max (because curr_max is set as mod(...), but actually in the code I had written:\n\ncurr_max is initially the remainder.\n\nThen, in the code, the code had:\n\ncurr_min = min( min_val, curr_max )\n\ncurr_max = max( min_val, curr_max )\n\nWait, but this would reuse curr_max in RHS before assigning to it anew? Let's see in the code:\n\ncurr_min = min( m, c_max ) \u2192 m = min_val, c_max = remainder (mod res).\n\ncurr_max = max( m, c_max )\n\nYes, that's okay. Because first, the variables curr_min and curr_max are calculated based on min_val and curr_max (original), then assigned.\n\nWait in the code as I had it:\n\nThe variables curr_min and curr_max are the new min and max values of min_val and the remainder (called curr_max here). So:\n\ncurr_min = min( current min_val, remainder (curr_max?) )\n\nYes. Wait the name 'curr_max' is the remainder. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo in code above, variables curr_min and curr_max hold the new min and max. Then min_val is set to curr_min, max_val to curr_max.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter obtaining the remainder, we need to set:\n\nnew_min = min( min_val, remainder)\n\nnew_max = max( min_val, remainder )\n\nWhich is exactly what curr_min and curr_max capture.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible error could be mixing min and max in loops, but seems okay.\n\nNow, the main program in Fortran.\n\nThe code reads 'n', then loops n times. For each iteration, reads a and b, then prints sub(a,b).\n\nIn Fortran, the read statement can be:\n\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nAnd print*, sub(a,b).\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the function is in scope.\n\nThe function definition is inside the program, using the 'contains' keyword.\n\nThe code I wrote uses 'contains' block to declare the function inside the program. This is okay in Fortran 90 and later.\n\nAlternatively, the function could be outside, but putting it inside the program block via contains is better.\n\nNow, variable declarations:\n\nThe function 'sub(a,b)':\n\nThe variables inside the function: min_val, max_val, result, curr_min, curr_max. All integers.\n\nWait the result is being calculated as the cumulative sum. So initialized to 0.\n\nWait in Java, the code has 'int result = 0;' \u2192 same in Fortran, set result =0.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the function has to return the accumulated result. The function's result is assigned to the name of the function: sub = result.\n\nWait yes, as written in the code.\n\nNow, checking all lines:\n\nThe do while loop in the function uses while (min_val > 0). That's okay. Wait in Fortran the syntax for 'do while' is:\n\ndo while (min_val >0 )\n\n    ...loop body...\n\nend do\n\nWhich is exactly in the code.\n\nTesting in code.\n\nNow, possible error points:\n\n- The assignment of the variables:\n\nWhen setting curr_max as mod(max_val, min_val). Should the variables be mod( max_val, min_val ) \u2192 the remainder of dividing max_val by min_val. Yes.\n\nWait the mod function in Fortran returns the remainder, which behaves the same as Java's % for positive numbers. Ensures the remainder has the same sign as the divisor only? Wait in cases where the numbers are negative, but perhaps since the problem constraints are unknown, perhaps assuming inputs are positive.\n\nThe problem statement for codeforces 267A \u2014 if this is from that problem, then the inputs are likely positive. So mod should be fine.\n\nAnother point: the loop must continue until min_val is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=3 \u2192 the same as a=3,5.\n\nWait let me choose a test case where a and b are swapped.\n\nSuppose a=1, b=1:\n\nsub(1,1) \u2192 initial min 1, max 1.\n\nresult +=1/1 \u21921.\n\nThen max mod 1: 0.\n\ncurr_min = min(1,0) \u21920.\n\ncurr_max = max(1,0) \u21921.\n\nSo new min=0 \u2192 loop exits.\n\nTotal result 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nTesting with another case: a=4, b=5 \u2192 initial min 4 and max 5.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nresult increases by 5/4 \u21921 (since 5 divided by 4 is 1, remainder 1.)\n\nmax mod min \u21925 mod4 =1.\n\ncurr_min = min(4, 1)=1.\n\ncurr_max = max(4,1)=4.\n\nNow min becomes 1, max 4.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nresult += 4/1 \u21924 \u2192 total 5.\n\nremainder 0.\n\ncurr_min = min(1,0)=0.\n\ncurr_max=1.\n\nLoop ends.\n\nTotal is 1 +4 =5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThus the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, translating all of that into Fortran as per the above code structure should be okay.\n\nAnother thing: the function must return the result, which it does with sub=result.\n\nFinally, compiling and testing would help, but assuming the code is correct.\n\nOne possible oversight: Did I use integer division correctly in Fortran?\n\nIn the line: result = result + (max_val/min_val). Since in Fortran, integer division is done with / operator when both operands are integers. So yes, 5/2 would be 2, not 2.5. That's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nPutting this all together, the Fortran code would look like this."
