Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java program reads two integers, n and x, from the user. The main goal is to determine if a certain condition is met and then print some numbers based on that. The print method checks if x is either 1 or (2n-1), in which case it outputs \"No\". Otherwise, it says \"Yes\" and proceeds to generate a sequence.\n\nLooking at the print method: When x is not 1 or max (where max is 2n\u22121), it prints \"Yes\". Then it constructs a string by generating a range of numbers starting from (x + n - 1) up to (x + n + max - 1), then for each element e in that sequence, it computes e mod max, adds 1, and appends that to the string with line separators. Finally, it prints that string.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out how to do this in Fortran. Let's break it into steps.\n\nFirst part: input. In Fortran, I can use read(*,*) to get the n and x variables. \n\nThen, the print function: The main logic here is checking if x is 1 or max. The maximum is 2*n -1. If either is true, print \"No\", else \"Yes\" followed by the number sequence.\n\nNow the tricky part is the sequence. In Java they're using IntStream.range with some parameters. Let me see what exactly they're doing. Let me analyze the parameters:\n\nThe starting point is (x + n -1), and the ending point is (x + n + max -1). Let's compute that:\n\nmax = 2n\u22121, so substituting that into the end parameter:\n\nx + n + (2n\u22121) -1 = x +3n -2 ?\n\nWait, the end in Java's range is exclusive, so the end index might be (x + n + max -1). But since the range is [start, end), they're generating numbers from start up to (end-1). Wait, in Java, IntStream.range(a, b) includes a but excludes b. Wait no, wait the range is [start, end), so in this case, the numbers generated are Start to (end-1). Wait, no: The end parameter is exclusive. So the length of the stream would be (end - start). \n\nLet me compute the start and end values again. \n\nmax is 2n-1.\n\nThe start is (x + n -1). \n\nThe end is (x + n + max -1). Let me plug in max: \n\nx + n + (2n-1) -1 = x + 3n -2. Wait, but that's the end parameter, so the numbers generated would go up to (x + 3n - 2 -1), or wait no? Wait, no, the start is x+n-1, end is x+n + max -1.\n\nWait the end is x +n + (max -1 +1)? Not sure. Let me see, maybe compute with some n and x to see what the parameters would be.\n\nLet me take an example: Say n =2, so max is 3. Let's say x is 2 (since x can't be 1 or 3 in that case).\n\nThen:\n\nstart would be 2 +2-1 =3\n\nend = 2 +2 + 3 -1 =2+2+2 =6. Wait 2+2+3-1= (x=2, n=2, max=3: end is 2+2 +3 -1 = 6. So the range is from 3 to 5. Then, for each e in 3,4,5.\n\nWait for the end being 6, so the numbers are 3,4,5. So total of (5-3+1=3 numbers), which makes sense.\n\nNow for the calculation: each e is taken mod max (3) plus 1.\n\nWait the first example: x=2, n=2, max=3.\n\nelements: e =3: 3 mod 3 is 0, +1 =1.\n\ne=4: mod3 is 1, so 2.\n\ne=5: mod3 is 2, so 3.\n\nSo the outputs would be 1,2,3. Which is printed each on separate lines. \n\nWait the answer for that example would be \"Yes\", followed by three lines: 1,2,3? \n\nWait the code's output in this case, the ans is constructed by appending each of those values followed by 'sep' which is the line separator, so each on its own line.\n\nHmm. Now, in Fortran, I need to duplicate that sequence. So first, how to generate this sequence of integers from start to end-1, where start and end are computed similarly, then compute for each e the value e mod max +1.\n\nIn Fortran, loops can be handled with DO loops. Let's think about variables:\n\nVariables:\n\ninteger :: n, x, max, i, e\n\nmax = 2*n -1.\n\nThe check is if (x ==1 .or. x == max), then print \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\nThen, need to output the sequence of numbers as per the Java code's logic.\n\nSo let's outline the Fortran code.\n\nFirst, the program would have a main block. In Fortran 90+, you can write like this:\n\nprogram agc006_b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, x, max, start, end_val, e\n    read *,n,x\n\n    max = 2*n -1\n\n    if (x ==1 .or. x == max) then\n        print *, \"No\"\n    else\n        print *, \"Yes\"\n        start = x + n -1\n        end_val = x + n + max -1 \n\n        ! Now loop from e = start to end_val -1 (since the Java code's end was exclusive)\n        do e = start, end_val-1\n            print *, mod(e-1, max) +1\n        end do\n    end if\nend program agc006_b\n\nWait, wait, note that in the Java code, the calculation is (e % max) +1. Because e can be positive. But in the Java code, mod in Java returns a remainder which has the same sign as the dividend. So for e positive, mod(e, max) would be correct. But in Fortran, mod(a,b) is the remainder after division with a by b. Let me check.\n\nFortran's modulo(a,b) is the mathematical mod, where the result has the same sign as b. For positive numbers, mod(e, max) in both would be same since both are positive. So perhaps mod(e, max) would be correct. Let me see:\n\nWait in Java, their formula: (e % max) +1.\n\nWait in the Java code, (e % max +1). Let me take e =3, max=3: 3 mod 3 is 0, so 0 +1 is 1. So correct. So in Fortran, mod(e, max) +1. Wait but in Fortran, mod(3,3) is 0. So same as Java. So using mod(e, max) is correct.\n\nWait but in the code here, in the Fortran code above, I have (mod(e -1, max)+1). Wait why? Wait, perhaps I made an error here. Let's see:\n\nWait in the original code, the element e is generated in the IntStream.range(start, end_val). So each e is from start, start+1, up to end_val-1. So for e in the range [start ... end_val -1].\n\nIn the Java code, the transformation is e -> (e % max +1).\n\nWait wait, in the Java code's lambda, the code says e%max +1. So it's (e mod max) +1.\n\nIn Fortran, so for each e (the e in the loop) compute mod(e, max)+1.\n\nSo why did I write mod(e -1, max) +1? Oh wait, that was a mistake.\n\nWait in my Fortran code above, in the loop, the variable e loops from start to end_val-1. Each such e is the same as the input e in the java code. For example, in the example n=2, start is 3, end_val is 6. So e would be 3,4,5. So the value computed is mod(e,3) +1. Let's see:\n\ne=3: mod(3,3)=0 \u2192 0+1=1.\n\ne=4 \u2192 mod(4,3) =1 \u2192 2.\n\ne=5 \u2192 mod(5,3)=2 \u21923. \n\nWhich matches the desired output. So the correct calculation is mod(e, max) +1. \n\nTherefore, the line in the code should be:\n\nprint *, mod(e, max)+1\n\nSo in my initial code above, that mistake was present. \n\nTherefore, correcting that, the Fortran code would look like this:\n\nprogram agc006_b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, x, max, start, end_val, e\n    read *,n,x\n\n    max = 2*n -1\n\n    if (x ==1 .or. x == max) then\n        print *, 'No'\n    else\n        print *, 'Yes'\n        start = x + n -1\n        end_val = x + n + max -1\n\n        do e = start, end_val -1\n            print *, mod(e, max) +1\n        end do\n    end if\nend program agc006_b\n\nWait but let me check the end_val calculation again. The end_val in the java code is x + n + max -1 ?\n\nWait in Java, the IntStream.range(start, end_val). The end_val is (x +n +max -1). Because in the java code, the end is x + n + (max -1) ?\n\nWait yes, exactly. So in the code, that's the correct start and end. Let me test with n=2, x=2: \n\nmax is 3.\n\nstart= 2+2-1=3. end_val =2+2 +3-1 \u2192 2+2=4; 4+ (3-1)=4+2=6? Wait no: 2+2+3-1.\n\nYes, x +n + (max) -1? Or is it x +n + (max-1). Let me compute:\n\nx +n + max -1 \u2192 2+2 +3 -1=6.\n\nSo yes, same as 6. The loop variable e runs from 3 to 5, inclusive.\n\nThus the end_val -1 would be 6-1=5. So the loop up to 5. So that is correct.\n\nSo the code looks okay.\n\nAnother test case: let's take n=1, so max = 2-1 =1?\n\nWait n is given, but let me see.\n\nWait n must be at least 1? Well, but the code allows it. Let's say n=1, x must be between 2? but the first check is if x ==1 or 1 (since max is 1). Wait for n=1, max is 2*1 -1=1. So if x is equal to max (1), then it's \"No\". So the problem's input constraints may require n and x such that n \u22651 etc.\n\nBut assuming the code works as written.\n\nAnother test case: Let me take n=3, x=3. Max would be 5. x is 3 which is not 1 or5 \u2192 so \"Yes\".\n\nThen start is 3+3-1=5.\n\nend_val is 3 +3 +5 -1=3+3=6 \u21926+5-1= 10? Wait 3+3=6, adding (5-1?) Wait no, the end_val is x +n + max -1.\n\nWait for n=3, x=3:\n\nstart =3+3-1 =5.\n\nend_val: 3 +3 +5 -1 \u2192 (3+3)=6 +5-1 =6+4=10. So end_val=10. end_val-1 is 9.\n\nThe e runs from 5 to 9. Let's compute each e mod5 +1 (since max is5):\n\ne=5 \u2192 5 mod5=0 \u21921.\n\n6 \u21921 \u2192 2,\n\n7 \u21922 \u21923,\n\n8 \u21923 \u21924,\n\n9 \u21924 \u21925.\n\nSo the output is 1,2,3,4,5. Five numbers? Since the numbers from5 to9 inclusive is 5 elements (5,6,7,8,9). The length would be (end_val -1 -start +1) \u2192 (9-5 +1)=5. Which is correct. So for n=3, that would give 5 numbers, which is correct as max is5. So the sequence is correct.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, their code uses IntStream.range(start, end_val) where end_val is x +n +max-1. The end is exclusive, so the elements are start, ..., end_val-1, which matches how the Fortran code is using e from start to end_val-1.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n- Fortran's modulus is mod function. Also note that the modulo function in Fortran and mod can behave differently with negative numbers, but since all e values here are positive, mod(e, max) is acceptable.\n\n- The print statements in Fortran for \"Yes\" and \"No\" are straightforward.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where x=1: should output 'No'\n\nn=2, x=1:\n\nThen:\n\nprint 'No', nothing else.\n\nAnother edge case: x=2n-1, which is max. Same output 'No'.\n\nNow, what about the sequence length? The number of elements should be (end_val - start). Which is (end_val - start) = (x +n +max -1 - (x+n-1)) \u2192 the x +n terms cancel, leaving (max -1 - (-1)) \u2192 max terms? Let me see:\n\nWait:\n\nend_val - start = (x +n + max -1) - (x +n -1) \u2192 that simplifies to max. So the number of elements is max. Which makes sense because max=2n-1, so when x is not 1 or max, then max numbers? So for n=2, it's three numbers, which matches earlier example.\n\nTherefore, the code should generate the correct sequence.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would be as above."
