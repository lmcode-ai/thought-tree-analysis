So in that case, the code is exploring the path of jumping steps until it reaches the target or overshoots. So for this code, the path is unique.

If we start at 1, and the step is 2 (arr(1) in Fortran), so new_pos is 1 + 2 =3 \u2192 that is equals to size(arr)+1 \u2192 then in the next call, it would check if 3 == target.

Then in the next call, the currpos is 4, which when compared arr.length+1 would be 3 (the length of the array (2)+1). So 4 vs 3: as the currpos is now 4, which is greater than 3: then return false. Ah, here's a correction: \n\nBecause in the Java code, when the currpos is greater than arr.length+1 (like 4 in this example), then in the first condition, check for currpos == target \u2192 if not, then in the second condition it checks currpos == arr.length+1 (which is 3), so that returns false. But if the currposition exceeds that by more, say 4, then the condition (currpos == arr.length +1 \u2192 3) is not met, thus the code proceeds to compute the next step again. Which would cause an exception, because it tries to access arr[currpos-1], which for currpos=4 is 3, but the array has only indices 0 and 1 (length 2). Thus the code is incorrect.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. The main function is the dfs (depth-first search) recursive function. The Java class is for a problem on Codeforces, probably related to checking if you can reach a target position by moving through an array using the values as steps. \n\nFirst, look at the Java code's structure. The method dfs takes current position, the array, target. It checks if current position is the target, returns true. If the current position is beyond the array (arr.length +1?), returns false. Then, it teleports by moving currpos + arr[currpos-1] (since arrays are 0-based in Java). Wait, in Java arrays are 0-based, but in the code, maybe the positions are 1-based? Let me see: for example, when currpos is 1, arr[0] would be used.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are typically 1-based by default unless declared otherwise. That could be an issue. So when translating, I should adjust the indices. \n\nThe main function reads n (probably number of elements?), goal (target position?), and the array of n-1 integers. Then calls dfs starting at position 1 with the array and goal, outputs YES or NO based on the result.\n\nThe problem might be something like: given positions from 1 to n, where each position (except the last?) has a number indicating how far you can jump. You need to see if you can reach the goal by moving through these jumps. \n\nNow, for the Fortran translation. Let's think about the overall structure.\n\nIn Java, the dfs is a static method. In Fortran, functions are either recursive functions or subroutines. Since the dfs is recursive, I need to make sure that the function is declared as recursive. \n\nIn Fortran, function arguments and return types must be clearly specified. Also, the array in Java is passed as an integer array, so in Fortran, it would need to be an array parameter with appropriate dimensions. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the dfs function. Let me look at the Java method:\n\npublic static boolean dfs(int currpos, int[] arr, int target) {\n\nThe Fortran equivalent would be a FUNCTION that returns a logical, takes currpos (integer), arr (integer array), target (integer). However, in Fortran, arrays have to have their dimensions specified. Since in Java arr is of length n-1, where n is the first input, which in the main program is read as n. \n\nWait, in Java the array has length n-1. Because in the code, the array is initialized as new int[n-1], then filled with n-1 elements. So the positions are probably 1-based up to n, where the array for position 1 has arr[0], position 2 arr[1], etc. So arr's indices in Fortran must be 1-based as well (or maybe 0-based? Need to decide.)\n\nHmm, to minimize confusion, in Fortran maybe we can use indices 1-based. Since in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default unless specified with bounds, this might be better. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran code:\n\nThe array in the main program would be declared as dimension(n-1). Then when we refer to the position, like position 'currpos', the array entry would be arr(currpos) if the first element is for position 1. Wait, wait the code in Java is: arr[currpos -1]. Because when currpos is 1, it's using arr[0], which is the first element (since in Java's array, they are 0-based). \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then for currpos in position 1, the element would be arr(1). But wait, the original Java arr has size n-1, since the Java code initializes an array of size n-1. So the n positions (from 1 to n) have their steps in the array except maybe the last position. \n\nWait, the problem mentions \"n\" as the number of elements? Wait, original code: in Java arr's length is n-1. So if n is the number of elements in the array plus 1. For example, n=3 then array is length 2. \n\nSo when looking up arr in the Java code, for position currpos (which goes from 1 to n), the array is accessed with currpos-1. Because arr is size n-1, so position n can't be accessed? Or maybe position n is also a valid, but maybe it's considered terminal or not. The code has a condition: if currpos == arr.length +1. Wait arr.length is n-1, so arr.length +1 would be (n). Wait, so when currpos equals n, then returns false? Because else, they do the next step. Hmm, maybe the positions go from 1 to (n), but the array holds the step values from positions 1 to n-1? So position n has no step, so to reach that position, you have to land exactly on it. \n\nSo the positions are 1,2,...,n. The array arr contains for each position except the last (n). So when at position i (from 1 to n-1), you can jump arr[i-1] (Java) or arr(i) (Fortran, assuming arrays start at 1) steps. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nSuppose the array is:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), intent(in) :: arr\n\nand its length is n-1. So the index runs from 1 (position 1) to n-1 (position n-1). Therefore, in the Fortran function, when the current position is currpos, the step is arr(currpos). Because arr(1) corresponds to Java's arr[0], which was for position 1.\n\nTherefore:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nteleport = dfs(currpos + arr[currpos-1], arr, target);\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nnew_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\nthen call dfs(new_pos, ...)\n\nWait, but currpos must be less than or equal to n. Because if currpos is beyond n, then we return false. Wait, the Java code condition is:\n\nif (currpos == target) return true;\n\nif (currpos == arr.length +1) return false;\n\nThe arr.length is n-1. So in Java, when currpos is (n-1) +1), which is n, the function returns false.\n\nWait. So, in Fortran, the code:\n\nif (currpos == target) => return true.\n\nif (currpos == (size(arr) + 1)) => return false. Because arr has size n-1, so that would give n again.\n\nThus, in Fortran, the condition for returning false is when currpos == size(arr)+1. \n\nSo the dfs function is:\n\nRecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(ok)\n\nok is a logical that is true if reachable.\n\nThe function's code would be:\n\nok = .false.\n\nif ( currpos == target ) then\n\n   ok = .true.\n\nelse if ( currpos == size(arr) + 1 ) then\n\n   ok = .false.\n\nelse\n\n   ! need to check the step, but need to ensure currpos is within the array's indices.\n\n   ! Wait, arr is of length n-1, so arr indices run from 1 to n-1, so:\n\n   step = arr(currpos)\n\n   new_pos = currpos + step\n\n   ! Then explore new_pos?\n\n   ! So call dfs again with new_pos.\n\n   ok = dfs(new_pos, arr, target)\n\n   ! Wait, but what if the new_pos is beyond size(arr) + 1?\n\n   so, this is covered in the next call. \n\n   There's only the one path here. In the java code, it's: teleport is the result of moving. If teleport is true, return true, else return false.\n\nSo in Fortran, we can do:\n\nok = dfs(new_pos, ...)\n\nthen return ok's value.\n\nWait Java code: \n\nteleport = dfs( currpos + ..., ... )\n\nthen if teleport is true return true, else return false. So it is the same as return teleport.\n\nSo in Fortran's code would be:\n\ndf = dfs( new_pos, arr, target )\n\nif ( df ) return true \n\nBut in Fortran, returning the value can be more straightforward.\n\nWait, the code in Java: the recursion returns the result of the next step. So in Fortran the function can be written recursively.\n\nThe base cases:\n\nFUNCTION dfs(currpos, arr, target) RESULT(ok)\n\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: currpos, target\n\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: arr(:)\n\n   LOGICAL :: ok\n\n   ok = .FALSE.\n\n   IF ( currpos == target ) THEN\n\n      ok = .TRUE.\n\n      RETURN\n\n   END IF\n\n   IF ( currpos > size(arr) + 1 ) THEN  ! Wait in Java it was == arr.length +1, but in Fortran size(arr) is (n-1), so size+1 is n, which is the same.\n\n      ! Wait in Java the condition was ==, so if currpos is exactly equal to (arr.length+1), which is n, return false.\n\n      ! So in Fortran, if currpos == size(arr)+1, then ok is false.\n\n      ok = .FALSE.\n\n      RETURN\n\n   END IF\n\n   ! We can proceed.\n\n   ! The step is currpos + arr(currpos)\n\n   ! Because arr has size n-1, so if currpos is from 1 to n-1, valid indices.\n\n   new_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n\n   ok = dfs(new_pos, arr, target)\n\n   ! and return that result.\n\n   ! Because if the result is true, then we should return it.\n\n   ! Since in Java it's returning teleport, which is the result of the dfs on new_pos.\n\n   RETURN\n\nEND FUNCTION dfs\n\nWait, but the Java also has the code:\n\nboolean teleport = dfs(newP, ...)\nif (teleport) return true;\nelse returns false, but after that. But in this code, the only possible path is to go via the step. Because Java does not have another branches here?\n\nWait the Java code's path is:\n\ncall dfs( currpos + arr[currpos-1], ... )\n\nthen if that returns true, return true, else return false.\n\nBut the code doesn't have any alternative path. So the java's code only takes the jump, once, then returns. Wait, is there any other step here?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for multiple paths, but I think in this code, they only explore the option of moving by the step. But why? Like, maybe the initial position is 1, you jump to new position, but maybe in the recursive step you can choose to jump again?\n\nWait no, looking at the code again, perhaps I messed up. Let me see the detailed Java code:\n\nThe code in the Java's dfs:\n\nif currpos == target \u2192 true.\n\nif currpos == (arr.length +1) \u2192 false.\n\n teleport = dfs(currpos + arr[currpos-1], arr, target);\n\n if (teleport) return true.\n\n return false.\n\nWait, that's like, for this current position, you jump to new_pos and see if that path finds the target. If it does, then yes. Else, you can't. Wait but there are no other options: like moving backward? Or is there another possibility?\n\nHmm. Wait maybe there are ambiguities because in the problem description, perhaps the path is determined uniquely. The problem might be that you can move either by jumping the step, but the code is following the jumps until it either arrives at the target or can't move anymore. \n\nWait, the code seems to model moving stepwise \u2014 you can jump from current position to next position, but you can\u2019t choose to stop moving. So it's like a deterministic jump path. Unless there's a cycle (if a step leads back to previous positions, leading to infinite loop?), but in this code it doesn't have cycles because the jumps can't go backward unless the step is negative.\n\nWait the problem may assume that the velocity is always towards the end, so no cycles? But perhaps the code is designed such that once you jump beyond the array length plus one, you can't proceed. So in that case, the code is exploring the path of jumping steps until it reaches the target or overshoots. So for this code, the path is unique.\n\nSo the code represents a path: starting at position 1, you must follow each step's direction. So for the code, the DFS function is only going along the one path possible by following each step.\n\nWait why is it called DFS then? Maybe the name is a misnomer. The function is actually doing a path check with recursive steps, but it's effectively a linear check, not a search with multiple branches because there's only one step to take from any given position. So once you choose the step, there's no alternative.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code can directly model this.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nIn the Java code's main, it reads n, the goal, then the array of n-1 integers. Then call dfs(1, arr, goal).\n\nIn Fortran, the main program needs to read n, goal, then read n-1 integers into the array. Then call the function and output YES or NO.\n\nNow, handling input: in Java, Scanner is used. In Fortran, the standard is to read from stdin using read(*,*) statements. So for a program that takes first n and goal, then the array elements.\n\nIn Fortran, the main program can proceed as:\n\nRead n, goal. Then allocate the array with (n-1) elements. Then read the array elements.\n\nBut in modern Fortran, using allocatable arrays is common, so:\n\ninteger :: n, goal\n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\nread(*,*) n, goal\n\nallocate( arr(n-1) )\n\nread(*,*) arr\n\nBut I have to make sure that the input for arr has exactly n-1 numbers.\n\nThen, call the dfs function with currpos=1, arr, goal. The result (logical) is stored in isFound. Then output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut note that the function is recursive, so in Fortran:\n\nProgram codeforces500a\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n, goal\n\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n\n   logical :: isFound\n\n   read *, n, goal\n\n   allocate( arr(n-1) )\n\n   read *, arr\n\n   isFound = dfs( 1, arr, goal )\n\n   if (isFound) then\n\n      print *, 'YES'\n\n   else\n\n      print *, 'NO'\n\n   end if\n\n   deallocate(arr)\n\ncontains\n\nRecursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(ok)\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n\n   logical :: ok\n\n   ok = .false.\n\n   if ( currpos == target ) then\n\n      ok = .true.\n\n   else if ( currpos > size(arr) + 1 ) then ! Wait: the condition in Java was currpos == (arr.length +1). So in Fortran, currpos == size(arr) + 1 \u2192 the condition for returning .false.\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      ok = dfs( currpos + arr(currpos), arr, target ) \n\n   end if\n\nend function dfs\n\nend program codeforces500a\n\nWait wait the problem is with the condition in the below code.\n\nWait in the condition:\n\nJava had:\n\nif (currpos == target) \u2192 ok=True\n\nelse if (currpos == (arr.length +1)) \u2192 ok = false.\n\nBut in the code above, in Fortran, the code\n\nif (currpos == target) \u2192 ok is true.\n\nElse, the second condition is checking if currpos > (size(arr)+1), then set to false.\n\nWait no. Wait, the first condition in Java is:\n\nif (currpos == target) \u2192 yes.\n\nelse if (currpos is > the max allowed (arr.length +1) \u2192 i.e., if current position is beyond that \u2192 return false.\n\nWait in Java, the condition is currpos == (arr.length +1). So in Java, it's when currpos is exactly that value. \n\nIn the above Fortran code, the second condition is checking if currpos > size(arr) +1 \u2192 so for example, if currpos is equal to size(arr)+1 (i.e., n), the second condition will not trigger. So the code is not correct.\n\nAh, that's a mistake. So need to change.\n\nIn Fortran, the condition should be:\n\nelse if (currpos == (size(arr) +1 )) then \u2192 then ok is .false. \n\nElse, proceed to compute new_pos.\n\nWait but the first condition is done. The second condition in the current code is else if ( currpos > the value), so it would only catch cases where it's over, but not equal. Hence the error.\n\nLet me correct the code structure:\n\nThe order in the IF statements should be:\n\nFirst, check if currpos is the target.\n\nSecond, check if currpos is exactly equal to (size(arr)+1 \u2192 which is target being n is allowed?)\n\nWait the second condition in the Java code is exactly on currpos being arr.length +1 \u2192 which is n. So in Fortran:\n\nIf currpos is equal to target \u2192 return true.\n\nElse if (currpos is equal to size(arr)+1 \u2192 which is n) \u2192 return false.\n\nElse \u2192 compute the step.\n\nHence the code should have:\n\n   if ( currpos == target ) then\n\n      ok = .true.\n\n   else if ( currpos == (size(arr)+1 ) ) then\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      new_pos = currpos + arr(currpos)\n\n      ok = dfs( new_pos, arr, target )\n\n   end if\n\nWait but the code can be simplified as:\n\nif ( currpos == target )\n\n   ok = .true.\n\nelse if ( currpos >= ( size(arr)+1 ) )\n\n   ok = .false.\n\nelse \n\n  ...\n\nWait wait in Java, once you overshoot (currpos > arr.length +1) it would also return false. Because if currpos exceeds arr.length+1 (n), then it would also return false.\n\nThe original code in Java's first condition is checking only exact ==, so in Java, if you jump way past, like currpos becomes say n+2, then in first condition, not target, second check  (currpos == arr.length+1 \u2192 n?), answer no, then jumps again and again?\n\nWait no in Java, for that case:\n\nSuppose currpos is currently greater than (arr.length +1), like say currpos is n+5.\n\nThen when processing:\n\nFirst condition is currpos == target? If the target is not that, then second condition is (currpos == arr.length +1 \u2192 which is n. So n+5 == n? No \u2192 then the else branch is taken.\n\nIn that branch, code is:\n\nteleport = dfs( currpos plus step...)\n\nBut if currpos is n+5, adding the step (arr[currpos-1] ), which would be arr[n+5 -1] \u2192 that is out of bounds. Because arr has only n-1 elements (0 to n-2). Because in Java currpos is n+5, currpos-1 =n+4, which is way beyond array size (arr.length is n-1).\n\nWait that would cause an array out of bounds exception in Java. But that's not handled in the original code. Hmm, so perhaps there's a mistake in the code? Or maybe the problem constraints prevent that?\n\nWait perhaps the steps in the array are such that you can never go back? Maybe the array entries are such that you can't have a step back.\n\nLooking back on the problem's code, perhaps the problem is designed so that the movements are always forward. Since if you can move backward, then the code would have infinite recursion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the array elements are non-negative integers.\n\nAh, so assuming that the jumps are always forward, so each step arr[i] is a non-negative integer. So when the current position is less than size(arr)+1 (the marker which would, if you jump to, would stop), but once you jump beyond that, you can't have another jump? Because you can't have enough to go further.\n\nWait let me think again with an example.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose n=3, so size(arr) is 2 (n-1=2).\n\narr would be arr[0], arr[1].\n\nThe maximum allowable position before returning false is 3 (size(arr)+1=2+1=3). \n\nIf we start at 1, and the step is 2 (arr(1) in Fortran), so new_pos is 1 + 2 =3 \u2192 that is equals to size(arr)+1 \u2192 then in the next call, it would check if 3 == target. If target is 3 \u2192 then yes. Else, the second condition is met (since 3 == 3 \u2192 so returns false.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the target could be n (the last position). \n\nAh right. So in the case where the target is 3 (the last position), when currpos is 1 and the step is 2, then new_pos is 3 \u2192 which is the target, so returns true.\n\nSo that's a valid scenario.\n\nBut if the target is 4 (which is beyond n), but the code allows n to be entered as a goal?\n\nWait the user inputs goal. If the goal is beyond n, the code returns 'NO'.\n\nIn the code's Java, in the main routine, 'goal' is the target. So may possibly be set to n. \n\nThe code correctly returns whether you can reach exactly the target.\n\nTherefore, the recursion in Fortran must be:\n\nClearly, in the code structure:\n\nFUNCTION dfs( ... )\n\nLOGICAL ok\n\n   ok = .false.\n\n   IF (curr == target) => .true.\n\n   ELSE IF ( curr == (size(arr)+1 ) ) \u2192 then return .false.\n\n   ELSE:\n\n      new_pos = curr + arr(current_pos)\n\n      ok = dfs( new_pos )\n\n   ENDIF\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, the conditions need to be ordered correctly, checking first ==, else if curr ==, then else, etc.\n\nWait the code I wrote before would have to have:\n\nAfter the first check for target, check for the second condition ( curr == (size(arr)+1)), which is exactly.\n\nYes. So the code should be:\n\nIn the function:\n\nrecursive function dfs (currpos, arr, target) result (ok)\n  integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n  integer, intent(in) :: arr (:)\n  logical :: ok\n  ok = .false.  ! default, but probably not needed.\n\n  if (currpos == target) then\n     ok = .true.\n  elseif (currpos == size(arr)+1) then  ! which is n\n     ok = .false.\n  else\n     ok = dfs( currpos + arr(currpos), arr, target )\n  end if\n\nend function\n\nThis seems better. So that the second condition is equality. \n\nTherefore, the code I wrote earlier for the function had an error in the second condition. \n\nSo correcting that:\n\nThe corrected function code:\n\nin the program:\n\ncontains\n\nRecursive function dfs (currpos, arr, target) result(ok)\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n\n   logical :: ok\n\n   if (currpos == target) then\n\n      ok = .true.\n\n   else if (currpos == size(arr) + 1) then\n\n      ok = .false.\n\n   else\n\n      ok = dfs( currpos + arr( currpos ), arr, target )\n\n   end if\n\nend function dfs\n\nThis structure should work. \n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, goal=1. \n\nWait but n=1 would have an array of length 0. Wait in the code, in main routine when n=1, then arr is allocate(0), which may be problematic in Fortran for arrays.\n\nWait, the Java code uses an array of new int[n-1]. So if n is 1, the array length is 0, which is allowed. But in Fortran, can we have an array of size zero? \n\nIn Fortran, the array has to have a length>0. Wait in Fortran, arrays can't have size zero. Trying to allocate a zero-length array would be an error. \n\nThus, perhaps in Fortran code, there must be a check. \n\nWait the problem's problem statement may require n to be greater than 1? \n\nThe code when n=1 would have a target of 1, and then the dfs is starting at 1.\n\nTesting n=1, goal=1:\n\nIn the Java code, arr has length 0, so when calling dfs(1, arr, 1), currpos is 1, which equals the target \u2192 returns true. Thus output YES.\n\nIn Fortran, if n=1, the allocate would be arr(n-1) = 0 elements \u2192 which is possible only in Fortran if the array is ZERO_SIZE_CAPABLE. But, in Fortran 90/95, you can have zero-sized arrays, but they may have issues. Alternatively, perhaps the problem its constraints state n>=2, which is unlikely.\n\nWait in the Java code, if n is 1, then the array is new int[0], which is allowed. \n\nThe Fortran code must handle that. So in that scenario, when n=1, then in the program, we have:\n\nallocate( arr(0) ), and then read 0 elements (input line with 0 numbers?), so that's impossible. \n\nHmm, so need to check if n=1 is allowed by the problem. \n\nAssuming the problem allows n=1 and that the goal is 1, then the answer is \"YES\". In this case, the code's dfs(1, arr (which is empty array), 1):\n\ncurrpos is 1 and target 1 \u2192 true.\n\nBut in Fortran, when the array is size zero, then `size(arr)+1` is 1. The currpos is 1. So, when in the function:\n\ncurrpos equals target, returns yes. The array's size(0)+1=1, so when even in the case when the array is length 0, that case is okay.\n\nWait, because when n=1, the array length is 0, then in the second condition, the test for currpos==1 (since size(arr)+1 =0+1=1) \u2192 so, when currpos is 1, which is the target, the first condition is true.\n\nThings work out.\n\nBut in the else clause, when size(arr) is zero, then when currpos is 1 and not the target, for example, if the target was something else?\n\nWait if n=1 and the target is 2 \u2192 then when we call dfs(1, arr, 2).\n\ncurrpos starts at 1 != target (2). Then check whether currpos == size(arr)+1 \u2192 1 ==1 \u2192 second condition hits. So return .false \u2192 which is correct.\n\nThus, even with zero-sized arrays, this code works. So Fortran can handle that as long as it allows allocating arrays with zero length. Not all compilers might allow it, but standard says that arrays can have any integer as the bounds, including zero-length. \n\nTherefore, the code as written should work.\n\nAnother test case. Let's say n=3, goal is 2. The array elements are [1, 1].\n\nCurrent position starts at 1. \n\nStep is arr(currpos = 1) \u2192 arr(1) is 1 (value). \n\nnew_pos =1+1=2 \u2192 which is target. So returns true. So output YES.\n\nAnother test case where the path overshoots. n=3, target=3.\n\narr is [3, 0]. \n\nWait then starting at position 1, takes step 3 \u2192 new_pos =1+3=4. \n\nWhich is greater than (size(arr) +1) \u2192 which is 2+1=3 \u2192 the new_pos is 4.\n\nThen when we call dfs(4, ...) \n\ncurrpos is 4, first condition is 4==3? No. Second condition: 4 =3? No. So enters else clause.\n\nNow, since size(arr)=2 (as n=3) \u2192 the code tries:\n\ncompute new_pos =4 + arr(4). However, arr has indices 1:2. So arr(4) is out of bounds. \n\nThis would cause an error in Fortran, with array out of bounds.\n\nBut according to problem's context, such steps wouldn't be given. The array entries can't cause indexes beyond? Wait the code's current logic does not check before accessing the step.\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because in the code in Java arr[currpos-1], 'currpos' in Java was up to the n (inclusive?), but in Java when the current position exceeds the array length (arr.length +1) \u2192 n \u2192 then it would return false before computing.\n\nWait in the example, when the array is size 2 (n=3), and the current position is 4, when you call dfs(4 ...), the second condition is 4 == 3 (arr.length+1)? No \u2192 so the else clause is taken, and we proceed to calculate new_pos =4 + arr(4). But arr has indices 1-2. So this would crash. So the code is incorrect.\n\nAh! The original Java code may have the same issue. Because in the case where you are at position currpos, which is larger than the array length (i.e., beyond arr.length (array.length is 2 for n=3 \u2192 arr.length +1 is 3) but the currpos is 3? Then proceeding to step.\n\nWait if currpos is 3 (the size(arr)+1 (2+1=3)), then in the Java code's condition, that returns false. But if currpos is 4 (beyond), then the code's first condition is false (target not met), second condition (currpos == arr.length+1 \u2192 4==3? no \u2192 so code proceeds, and then tries to access arr[currpos-1], where currpos-1 is 3. But arr's length is 2 \u2192 index 3 is out of bounds. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nWait that's a problem in the Java code, so is there a missing condition?\n\nThe problem must be that in the code, the array contains only indexes up to n-1, so steps can be made such that you can jump beyond. The code is missing a check when currpos exceeds the array's valid indices. Thus the Java code is incorrect and will crash in some cases. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the original code. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem constraints prevent the array entries from causing out-of-bounds steps. For example, the problem says that the jumps are as per the values, which must not allow steps that would take the current position beyond the array's reach before the termination conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the input is such that it can't have a step that takes you beyond. But in the problem's code, it's not handled. \n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code may need to check whether currpos is within 1: size(arr), because arr(currpos) is used when currpos is the current position and the current position is in 1...size(arr). \n\nBecause the step is only allowed when currpos is between 1 and size(arr), as the array is only defined for those positions. \n\nLooking back at the Java code's logic:\n\narray arr has length n-1 (indices 0 to n-2). So when in Java currpos is between 1 and n-1 \u2192 arr[currpos-1] is valid. \n\nThe stopping condition is when currpos reaches or exceeds arr.length+1 \u2192 which is n. \n\nBut in the code, the steps:\n\ncurrpos (which starts at 1) can only jump as per the steps, which are the allowed array's entries. So if currpos reaches n, then we stop. \n\nWait the array allows steps only for positions up to n-1 \u2192 so to reach n (the stopping point), you can jump to there.\n\nSo, the code implicitly assumes that the step for currpos cannot jump further than n, or else in such case, the path continues until it passes n, returns false.\n\nWait but in the example where steps lead beyond, the Java code would eventually reach a currpos equal to or larger than n (arr.length+1 \u2192 n is arr.length+1 is n= (n-1)+1).\n\nWait in the example I had:\n\nn=3, target=3:\n\narr is [3,0]. So the step at position1 is 3 \u2192 taking you from position1 to 1+3=4, then:\n\nprocessing position4:\n\nthe condition currpos ==3? (target is 3 \u2192 4 is not). Then currpos=4 vs size(arr)+1 (3 \u2192 no). So the code tries to access arr(4), but the array size is 2 \u2192 leading to an out of bounds error.\n\nThis means that the Java code has an error. So the original code is incorrect, leading to a crash in such case. So perhaps the problem was intended to ensure that steps don't allow that?\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, unless we can count on the input constraints, we need to include a check in the code to prevent stepping outside the array.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait the problem's array is given, so the code can't have error-checking. So the problem must ensure that all the steps are valid. Or maybe the step values are such that they are non-negative and arr[i] >0 so that currpos increases? This way, you eventually reach the maximum position.\n\nWait maybe the problem's input ensures that you can never step beyond the array before the termination condition.\n\nWait the termination conditions in Java: once currpos reaches arr.length +1, you fail. But when you jump beyond that (arr.length +1 is n \u2192 then n itself is the stopping point. If a step is for example, starting at position1 -> add a step of arr[0]=3 (n=3, the arr has two elements), 1+3=4 which exceeds n \u2192 then the next step in DFS would enter with currpos4. \n\nIn that case, the next step would be to check whether currpos4 == arr.length +1 \u2192 no (n is 3, 4 vs 3 \u2192 not). So it proceeds to step into arr[4-1=3], but the array only has indexes 0-1, so that's out of bounds.\n\nHence the code is indeed wrong.\n\nThis is a problem in the original Java code, and thus may need to be addressed in the Fortran code as well.\n\nBut why wasn't that mentioned? Maybe because in the problem constraints, the steps are such that you never land on positions beyond n-1 (the positions with valid step entries). Because jumping from i, you can only land on i + arr[i-1].\n\nIf for all i in the Array, the steps must be such that i+arr[i-1] does not exceed n (so they can't go beyond n). Hence when you land on n, then you stop. \n\nFor instance, in Java's step, the arr[length] is n-1 (when the array is n-1 in length). \n\nWait, if arr[i-1] is such that i (the currpos in Java) plus arr[i-1] can be more than n. For example, for i=3, but n=3, then in that case the array hadn't stored that (since indices go only up to 2 (n-1-1)). \n\nWait, no, because in Java for n=3, the array length is 2 (indices 0 and 1). \n\nThe currpos can't reach 3 when making a step. Because in order to reach currpos=2 (Java), then the step is arr[1], then 2 + arr[1]. \n\nIf that step was 2 \u2192 then you jump to 4 (when currpos in java is 2). Then in the next call, the currpos is 4, which when compared arr.length+1 would be 3 (the length of the array (2)+1). So 4 vs 3: as the currpos is now 4, which is greater than 3: then return false.\n\nAh, here's a correction: \n\nBecause in the Java code, when the currpos is greater than arr.length+1 (like 4 in this example), then in the first condition, check for currpos == target \u2192 if not, then in the second condition it checks currpos == arr.length+1 (which is 3), so that returns false. But if the currposition exceeds that by more, say 4, then the condition (currpos == arr.length +1 \u2192 3) is not met, thus the code proceeds to compute the next step again.\n\nWhich would cause an exception, because it tries to access arr[currpos-1], which for currpos=4 is 3, but the array has only indices 0 and 1 (length 2).\n\n Thus the code is incorrect. The Java code is flawed, and will fail when step jumps beyond.\n\nSo how to fix it?\n\nThis indicates that in the problem's conditions, the allowed jumps must be such that you do not leave the array's valid reach before arriving at n. Or, perhaps the problem's array entries are chosen such that they never result in such jumps. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that steps are non-negative and that when currpos reaches 'i <= n-1', then the step must be that i + arr[i-1] <=n. Because then, the steps would never cause you to go beyond n.\n\nIf that's stipulated in the problem constraints, then everything is okay. But if not, then the code is wrong.\n\nAssuming that the problem's inputs are valid and the jumps will never take the current position beyond 'size(arr)+1' (n), then the code can proceed.\n\nThus, the translator must proceed with the given Java code, assuming that the problem's input is valid.\n\nHence, the Fortran code is acceptable as written.\n\nThus the correct code is as I have previously written.\n\nBut to be safe in the code, when the current position is in a range which allows accessing the array, ensure that currpos is within 1 to size(arr).\n\nBut how can we add that?\n\nThe function must only proceed when currpos is between 1 and size(arr).\n\nWait but the first condition would get it.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInside the dfs function:\n\nIf the current pos is between1 and size(arr), then the step is allowed.\n\nOtherwise, but if currpos exceeds that (either above or below 1):\n\n currpos less than 1 is impossible since in the main, we start at 1.\n\nBut if it could go back (negative steps?), but\n\nThe problem might not allow negative numbers, so the steps are positive. Hence currpos always increase.\n\nSo in that case, the only possible stopping at step is when you land on the target exactly, or overshoot (>= n).\n\nHence the Java code logic is okay as long as steps don't allow getting to positions beyond the array on the first steps.\n\nBut the code is flawed without that assumption.\n\nAssuming that the problem's input is such that the step values are non-negative and do not allow jumping beyond the array, then the code can be translated.\n\nTherefore\uff0c proceeding with the Fortran code as I wrote earlier.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct Fortran code is:\n\nFilled in:\n\nThe full code would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_500_A\n \n   implicit none\n   integer :: n, goal\n   integer, allocatable :: arr(:)\n   logical :: isFound\n \n   read *, n, goal\n   allocate(arr(n-1))\n   read *, arr\n   isFound = dfs(1, arr, goal)\n   if (isFound) then\n      print *, \"YES\"\n   else\n      print *, \"NO\"\n   end if\n \n contains\n \n recursive function dfs(currpos, arr, target) result(ok)\n   implicit none\n   integer, intent(in) :: currpos, target\n   integer, intent(in) :: arr(:)\n   logical :: ok\n \n   if (currpos == target) then\n      ok = .true.\n   else if (currpos == size(arr) +1) then ! size(arr)=n-1 \u2192 target could be size(arr)+1?\n      ok = .false.\n   else\n      ok = dfs(currpos + arr(currpos), arr, target)\n   end if\n end function dfs\n \nend program codeforces_500_A\n\nWait but the function is recursive \u2192 need the \"recursive\" in the function statement.\n\nYes, the function must be declared as recursive\uff0c but in the function definition:\n\n The correct syntax is adding recursive before the function name:\n\n recursive function dfs(...) \n\nthe Fortran code uses:\n\n contains\n\n recursive function dfs( ...\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nChecking for the case where currpos is within the array:\n\nIn the function, if currpos is between 1 and (size(arr)), then it can get the arr(currpos). The termination conditions covers the other cases.\n\nThus I think this should be correct.\n\nSo I'll present this as the Fortran solution."
