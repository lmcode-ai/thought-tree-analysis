    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads a bunch of integers from the input. It separates the even and odd numbers. The even numbers are summed immediately. The odd numbers are stored in a list, sorted, then all are added to the sum. However, if there's an odd number of odds, the smallest one (the first in the sorted list) is subtracted, so that the total number of odds becomes even. The final sum is printed.\n\nHmm, in Fortran, I need to handle input, arrays, sorting, and conditions. Let's see. \n\nFirst, the input. In Java, they used Scanner, but in Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) statements. The first input is an integer n, which is the count of numbers. Then there are n long integers. Wait, in Fortran, integers can be 4 or 8 bytes. Since Java uses long (64-bit), maybe I should use 8-byte integers here. Fortran 90 and later have SELECTED_INT_KIND, but maybe just using INTEGER*8 or KIND=8.\n\nNext, the list of numbers. Since Fortran arrays are static, but the size is given first, I can read them into an array of size n. Then separate even and odd numbers.\n\nWait, the Java code uses an ArrayList for the odd numbers. In Fortran, maybe an array that grows as needed? But since we process all elements first, perhaps pre-allocate the maximum possible size, which is n. Let me think. The process is:\n\nLoop through each number. For each, check if even or odd. If even, add to sum. If odd, add to the odd list. Then sort the odd list. Then add all odds to the sum. Then, if the count of odds is odd, subtract the smallest (the first element after sorting).\n\nWait, but in the code, after adding all odds to the sum, the code checks if the size is odd, and subtracts the first element of the sorted list. Wait, original code does:\n\nsum starts as sum of evens. Then adds all odds (so the sum becomes even + all odds). But then, if there are an odd number of odds, it subtracts the smallest odd (so the total becomes even + (sum of odds - the smallest)), effectively making the count of odds even? Because if you remove one odd, the count becomes even. But why do this? Because perhaps the problem requires that the sum has even count of odd numbers? Wait, maybe the problem is about making the sum even? Because even + even is even, odd + even can be odd. The problem from Codeforces 621A might require the maximum even sum achievable. But the code seems to subtract the smallest odd if there's an odd count of odds. \n\nAnyway, regardless of the problem, I need to translate the code correctly. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read n, then the n numbers.\n\nInitialize sum to 0. Initialize an array for odds. Let me see:\n\nIn Java, they have a list. In Fortran, I can have an array that's dynamically resized? Not really. So, perhaps first read all numbers into an array, then process. Let's see:\n\nRead all elements into an array, say arr(1:n). Then, loop through each element. If even, add to sum. If odd, add to the odd array. \n\nThe odd array can be of size n. But since we don't know how many odd elements there are, but n can be up to, well whatever the input allows, but for code submission, maybe the input's n is not too big. \n\nAlternatively, we can first count the number of odds, then allocate an array of that size. But in Fortran, array allocation is possible with ALLOCATE.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n numbers into an array arr.\n\n3. Initialize sum =0.\n\n4. Count the number of odds: count_odds = number of elements where arr(i) is odd.\n\n5. Allocate an array odds of size count_odds.\n\n6. Then loop through arr, and collect all the odds into the odds array.\n\n7. Sort the odds array.\n\n8. Then, add all elements of odds to the sum.\n\n9. If count_odds is odd, subtract the first element (since the array is sorted, it's the smallest). \n\nWait, no. Wait the code in Java does:\n\nsum starts with evens. Then adds all odds. Then subtracts the smallest if the count is odd. \n\nWait, in the Java code, after adding all odds to the sum (so sum initially is even_numbers + all_odds), then check if the count of odds is odd. If yes, subtract the first element (the smallest). So the total becomes even_odds? Because if count was even, you leave it, but if it was odd, you subtract one (the smallest).\n\nThat way, the sum's parity would depend on the original even part plus sum of the remaining odds. The problem must require the sum to be even, so we remove the smallest if necessary.\n\nSo, in fortran steps:\n\n- Read n and the numbers.\n\n- Initialize sum as 0. \n\n- Create an array to hold odds.\n\n- count_odds is initialized to 0.\n\n- Then loop through each element in arr:\n\n   if even: sum += value\n\n   else: add to odds array (so index count_odds +1)\n\nSo, need to track count_odds as we process each element. Then after collecting all odds, we have to sort them. Then:\n\nsum += sum of all odds.\n\nIf count_odds is odd, subtract odds(1), which is the smallest because sorted.\n\nWait, but in the Java code, after collecting odds, they sort the list, then add all odds to sum. So the adding is done after sorting but even the sorted list's elements are added. The subtraction is done if the count is odd, the first element is subtracted again.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nsum starts with even numbers.\n\nfor (i in list) : for evens, add to sum. For odds, add to odd list.\n\nThen, after sorting, for i in odd list: sum += i. Wait, no, the code is:\n\nWait the for loop over odd is:\n\nfor (long i : odd) sum += i; \n\nWait that's inside the code. Wait, the initial loop for (long i : list) was used to process each element. The code then loops again through odd, adding those. Wait a minute, let me see:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nThe list has all numbers (even and odd).\n\nThen:\n\nsum is initialized at 0.\n\nthen, loop over the entire list. For even numbers, sum += i. For odds, add to the odd list.\n\nWait, so the evens contribute to the sum, the odds are stored. Then after that, the code loops over the odd list and adds each element to sum. So the initial sum was the sum of the even numbers, then adding all the odds also. So effectively sum is sum of all even and odds? That would be sum of all elements, and then subtract the smallest if the number of odds was odd. Wait that's not. Hmm, so that can't be correct. Wait maybe I misread the code.\n\nWait, looking again. The code:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nFor each i in list:\n\n   if even: add to sum.\n\n   else: add to odd list.\n\nThen:\n\nafter that, the code does for (i in odd): add to sum. \n\nWait, so the first part adds the evens, the second part adds the odds again. So sum becomes the total sum, plus the odds?\n\nNo, no. The code has: \n\nfirst loop: for (i : list) \n\nif even: add to sum, else: add to odd list.\n\nThen, after that, the code loops over the odd list, adding each to sum. That loop is completely redundant? Because the odds were not added in the first loop. So the second for loop adds the odds to sum, so in the end, the sum is equal to the total of all evens + odds. Which is the total of all numbers. \n\nWait but that's correct? Then the next step is if the number of odds is odd, then subtract the first one. Wait, so the algorithm:\n\nTotal sum of all numbers, minus the smallest odd if the count of odds is odd. \n\nBecause for that case sum is total sum of all + even..., no: let's see:\n\nThe code's order is:\n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nFirst loop: even elements add to sum (so sum is sum of evens). The odds are stored in the list. \n\nSecond loop adds all odds to sum: so after this, the sum becomes even_sum + odd_sum. \n\nYes, because the first loop added evens (so odd numbers not added yet). The second loop adds them. So the total is all numbers sum.\n\nBut then if the number is odd, subtract the first (smallest?)\n\nWait, that's the idea. Because if the number of odds is even or odd? Wait the code subtracts the first (smallest) only when the count of odds (original count) is odd. \n\nBut when the count is even, we do nothing, and return sum (total of all numbers). \n\nWhen count is odd: sum is all numbers except the smallest odd. Because the code subtract the first element again. Because adding the odds in the second loop, and then subtract the first. The total sum is (sum_evens + sum_odds) - odd.get(0). \n\nWait the code's logic is: \n\nsum starts at 0.\n\nfor all elements: \n\nif even, add to sum. \n\nelse add to the odd list. \n\nThen, after the first loop, sum has the even part. Then, we add all elements in the odd list (so total becomes even + all odds). \n\nThen, if the count of odds is odd, subtract the first element (smallest). \n\nThus, the total is even_total + all_odds_total - smallest_odd when odds count was originally odd. \n\nBut why? Because the problem is probably: find the maximum even sum. Since adding all odds (if the count was even) is okay, but if count is odd, removing the smallest (the one that takes least from the total to make the count even) so to maximize the sum. \n\nSo, now, back to code translation.\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nFirst, n is read. Then the array. \n\nFor the odds list: since in Fortran, you can't dynamically grow arrays, perhaps you need to read all numbers first, count the odd ones, then allocate an array with that size.\n\nHere's a step by step plan.\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read n numbers, store them in an array of size n, say input_arr.\n\n3. count_odds = 0\n\n4. Compute sum_evens, and count_odds and collect the odds in an array.\n\nWait: So first, we can loop through the input array, to do following:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nsum_total =0\n\ncount_odds =0\n\nWe can first calculate:\n\nsum_evens: sum of all even numbers.\n\ncount_odds: number of odd numbers.\n\nand also collect the odd numbers in an array.\n\nTo collect odds: since during first pass we don't know how many odds there are, so need to eithe:\n\n- read all numbers first, then allocate array of count_odds.\n\nBut in FORTRAN, you can allocate an array after knowing the size. So here's plan:\n\nFirst loop over all input elements (using a do loop from 1 to n):\n\nsum_evens += if even, add to sum_evens. else count_odds += 1, store the value in a temporary list?\n\nAlternatively, first loop just counts count_odds and also saves all values in input array.\n\nThen after that, allocate an array of size count_odds, and then loop again through the input array, copy the odds to this array.\n\nYes, that could work. \n\nLet me write this step:\n\nvariables:\n\ninteger, parameter :: n= ... \n\ninteger(kind=8) :: input_array(n)\n\ninteger :: count_odds =0\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: odds(:)\n\nreal :: sum_total = 0\n\nWait in fortran, sum could be an integer or something else. Wait in Java it's using long, so sum would be 64-bit integer. So in fortran, sum should be an integer(kind=8).\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nallocate input_array(1:n)\n\nloop i=1 to n: read each element into input_array(i).\n\nthen:\n\nsum_total =0\n\ncount_odds=0\n\nloop over input_array:\n\n  do i =1 to n\n\n    num = input_array(i)\n\n    if mod(num,2) ==0 then\n\n        sum_total = sum_total + num\n\n    else\n\n        count_odds = count_odds +1\n\n    endif\n\n  enddo\n\nWait but this only counts the odds. Need to also save the actual numbers of odds.\n\nSo to collect the odds numbers, we can first count them, then allocate an array of that size, then loop again to fill it.\n\nlike:\n\nafter first pass, count_odds is known.\n\nallocate odds(1:count_odds)\n\nthen loop over input array again, this time storing the odds into the odds array.\n\nHmm, that requires two passes. Alternatively, loop once but keep track of the current index to store in odds array.\n\nAlternatively, during the first loop, when we see an odd number, add it to a temporary list stored in a dynamic array. But in Fortran, you can use dynamic arrays with ALLOCATE.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: \n\nInitialize a counter for odds.\n\nallocate an array (eventually, but initially maybe a size: in the first loop, each time an odd is found, increment a counter, and also append to the array, reallocating?\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Since the elements are in the input array already, perhaps better to do it two times.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nAfter reading input_array, the first step is:\n\nCompute count_odds and the sum_evens:\n\nsum_total =0.0\n\ncount_odds =0 \n\ndo i=1,n\n\n  num = input_array(i)\n\n  ! check if even\n\n  if (mod(num,2) ==0) then \n\n    sum_total = sum_total + num\n\n  else\n\n    count_odds = count_odds +1 \n\n    !then, save the value somewhere. \n\n  end if \n\nend do \n\nWait to save the value, I need an array. Since the first loop can't save them because the array's size is yet unknown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFirst, loop through all elements to count number of odds and also collect them into a list. To do this without knowing the size, perhaps preallocate an array with n elements (the maximum possible for odds). Then track the actual count.\n\nLike:\n\nAfter reading the input array, then:\n\nallocate temp_odds_array(1:n)\n\ncount_odds =0\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n  num = input_array(i)\n\n  if mod(num,2) /=0 then \n\n    count_odds = count_odds +1 \n\n    temp_odds(count_odds) = num \n\n  end if \n\nend do \n\nThen later, we can copy the temp_odds(1:count_odds) into the odds array, which is allocated as size count_odds.\n\nAlternatively, this allows:\n\nallocate odds( count_odds )\n\nodds(1:count_odds) = temp_odds(1:count_odds)\n\nBut maybe even better, we can just work with the temp_odds array of size n, but only use the first count_odds elements.\n\nAlternatively, since in fortran we can read everything first.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nMaybe:\n\nRead all numbers into input array, also while looping once: collect the odds into temp array (with index).\n\nHere's code:\n\nprogram main\n\n  implicit none \n\n  integer :: n, i, count_odds\n\n  integer(kind=8) :: sum_total = 0\n\n  integer(kind=8), allocatable :: input_array(:)\n\n  integer(kind=8), allocatable :: odds(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n \n\n  allocate(input_array(n))\n\n  do i=1,n\n\n     read(*,*) input_array(i)\n\n  end do \n\n  count_odds =0 \n\n  sum_total =0 \n\n  do i=1,n\n\n     if ( mod( input_array(i), 2 ) ==0 ) then \n\n          sum_total = sum_total + input_array(i)\n\n     else \n\n          count_odds = count_odds +1 \n\n          ! save in the odds array? Not yet. Need to store these as we go\n\n     end if \n\n  end do \n\n  ! Now we have count_odds, so allocate odds array:\n\n  allocate(odds(count_odds))\n\n  ! Now loop again to store the odds:\n\n  count=0 ! need a variable for index\n\n  do i=1,n \n\n    if ( mod( input_array(i), 2 ) .ne.0 ) then \n\n        count = count+1 \n\n        odds( count ) = input_array(i)\n\n    end if \n\n  end do \n\nWait. So here count is another variable (same as count_odds?), but need to track index. So count starts at 0, and increments to 1, etc.\n\nWait, since count_odds is known, and the second loop could count properly, as long as it goes through input again.\n\nThis works, but perhaps we need to have:\n\nWait in first loop: the first loop (the one adding to sum_total) can also collect the odds. Let's combine these loops.\n\nSo first loop to read and process:\n\nsum_total =0 \n\ncount_odds =0\n\nthen:\n\ndo i=1,n \n\n    current_num = input_array(i)\n\n    if (mod( current_num, 2 ) ==0) then \n\n        sum_total += current_num\n\n    else \n\n        count_odds +=1\n\n        odds(count_odds) = current_num \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nWait but for that, odds must be allocated before this loop. Since count_odds is growing, but in fortran, if we don't know the array size, it may not work. Hmm, this approach may need a dynamic array. But in Fortran you can't dynamically allocate during the loop till the end. Unless we use a different approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nUse a temporary array of size n for the odds (the maximum possible), then later, trim it.\n\nSo allocate odds(n)\n\nthen count_odds starts at 0. \n\ndo i=1,n \n\n    current_num = input_array(i)\n\n    if mod(current_num, 2) ==0: add to sum \n\n    else: \n\n        count_odds +=1\n\n        odds(count_odds) = current_num \n\nend do \n\nthen after, reallocate the odds array to exactly size count_odds. Hmm but how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can just keep the array as n size but use only first count_odds elements. Since sorting can be done until count_odds elements.\n\nSo perhaps in the code:\n\n no need to reallocate, just treat the odds array as first count_odds elements. \n\nProceeding with code outline, assuming the odds array is size n (since initialized to that size), but the count_odds is the actual elements. \n\nWait but in allocating the odds array, perhaps better to know its final size. \n\nHmm this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again:\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n- collect the list of odds. \n\nTo collect the odds:\n\nInitialize an array for odds with size n, since in the first k steps, may need to store up to n elements, but in reality, the number of odds is smaller.\n\nLoop through the input array, and whenever an odd element is found, put it in odds array at count_odds+1, then count_odds +=1 \n\nThus, odds(1) to odds(count_odds) are the odd numbers. \n\nThus, after collecting, the array has the data, but with possible unused space. \n\nSorting is needed. Then sum the odds and subtract the first (smallest if sum is odd count).\n\nProceeding:\n\nnext steps after collecting odds:\n\nif count_odds>0:\n\n   sort the odds array (from first to count_odds elements)\n\nsum_total = sum_total + sum( odds(1:count_odds)  )\n\nWait, sum( odds is an array. In fortran you can do this with a do loop. \n\nWait in fortran, the intrinsic function SUM can be used. \n\nIf the odds array has been stored in an array, then sum_odds = sum(odds(1:count_odds))\n\nso sum_total would be = sum_evens ( initial value ) + sum_odds. \n\nWait, but the initial sum_total after the first loop was only the even numbers. \n\nWait in the first loop:\n\nsum_total starts at 0. \n\nfor each element:\n\nif even: add to sum_total \n\nelse: stored in odds array. \n\nThus after first loop, sum_total is the sum of even numbers. \n\nThen, to add all odds, we add sum(odds array). \n\nthen, proceed. \n\nSo after that the sum_total becomes total of all numbers. \n\nThen, if count_odds is odd:\n\nthen we subtract the first element (the smallest, but we have to sort first).\n\nWait in Java, the code sorted the odds before adding them. So in our code, after collecting the odds, we must sort them in ascending order. \n\nYes, so after collecting, sort the odds array. \n\nWait in code:\n\nafter collecting odds:\n\ncall quicksort( odds(1:count_odds) ) \n\nWait but Fortran has a built-in sort? Or do I need to write a sorting subroutine. \n\nAh, in Fortran, you can use the intrinsic subroutine Called \"SORT\". Let me check:\n\nFortran 90 has the function MAXLOC and MINLOC, but for sorting, one can use the built in procedures.\n\nWait in fortran 90 and later, you can use the Fortran intrinsic function to sort an array. \n\nYes! The intrinsic subroutine isqs is available in some versions, but perhaps the best portable way is to use the 'sort' provided by Fortran.\n\nWait according to Fortran 2003, there is an intrinsic sort:\n\nThe Fortran library's sort function:\n\nIn Fortran, you can use the following:\n\ncall merge_sort( array )\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, use linalg or another method. \n\nWait, the intrinsic sort routine isn't part of the standard, but there's a package. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the function ISORT. Alternatively, implement a sort with a subroutine. \n\nHmm, this might be the biggest hurdle here. Need to sort the array of odds in ascending order. \n\nLet's think, for simplicity, maybe it's better to write a simple bubble sort. Although inefficient for big data, but since this is a code submission, maybe acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, write a selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, use quicksort. \n\nAlternatively, use the ISO intrinsic if possible. \n\nWait according to the document, in Fortran 90 and higher, the standard does not provide a built-in sort routine. So you need to write your own or use external modules. \n\nBut for the purpose of this code, perhaps implementing a quicksort is okay, but better to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem has to be written for code submission, the code must work even if the odds array can be sorted.\n\nAlternatively, implement a simple bubble sort for the odds array. Let's proceed:\n\nFirst, after the odds array is filled (from 1 to count_odds):\n\ncall bubblesort(odds, count_odds)\n\nWhere bubblesort is a subroutine that sorts an array of integers of size n. \n\nSo, function:\n\nsubroutine bubblesort(array, n)\n\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: array(:)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n    integer :: i, j, temp \n\n    do i=1,n-1\n\n        do j=1,n-i\n\n            if ( array(j) > array(j+1) ) then \n\n                temp = array(j)\n\n                array(j) = array(j+1)\n\n                array(j+1) = temp \n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n    end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nAlternatively, selection sort.\n\nAlternatively, just use selection sort which may be faster for small n. \n\nAlternatively, but perhaps the time constraints won't matter here. \n\nAlternatively, just use the built-in sort function. Wait, in Fortran, you can sort an array in a way using the intrinsic function. Like:\n\ncall merge_sort( odds(1:num_odds) )\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, use the 'sort' function from the ieee or other library, but maybe in standard syntax, the easiest is to use the feature of Fortran to allow ASSOCIATIVE or other.\n\nAlternatively, write a sort.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following: \n\nIn Fortran 2003, there's the intrinsic function ISORT, but I think it's not standard. \n\nWait the module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV has some functions, but sorting isn't part of that. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard approach of implementing a sort.\n\nProceeding with a subroutine. Let's write a selection sort.\n\nsubroutine sort_odds( arr, size )\n\n    integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: size \n\n    integer :: i, j, min_idx \n\n    do i=1, size \n\n        min_idx = i \n\n        do j=i+1, size \n\n            if( arr(j) < arr(min_idx) ) min_idx = j \n\n        end do \n\n        if ( min_idx /=i ) then \n\n            ! swap \n\n            temp = arr(i)\n\n            arr(i) = arr(min_idx)\n\n            arr(min_idx) = temp \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\nend subroutine \n\nWait this is selection sort. \n\nThen call this subroutine with the odds array: size is count_odds.\n\nThus, after collecting the odds into the array:\n\ncall sort_odds( odds(1:count_odds), count_odds )\n\nBut to get the exact size, I need to pass count_odds as the size. \n\nNow, proceeding further:\n\nAfter sorting, the sum of odds is added to the sum_total. Wait no:\n\nWait in the original code, the code first had the sum of even numbers. Then it adds the sum of the odds. So:\n\nsum_total becomes:\n\nsum_even (the original) + sum_odds (the sum of all odds in the list). \n\nBut in the code, these are stored in odds array. So after the odds are sorted, we add all of them to the sum_total. \n\nWait no. Let me clarify:\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nafter getting the evens (sum_evens = sum of even nums), then:\n\nthe code adds all odds (the odd list). Thus the sum becomes sum_evens + sum_odds (all). \n\nSo, in fortran, after collection:\n\nsum_total (which is initially the sum_evens) is increased by the sum of odds array.\n\nSo compute the sum of the odds array (all elements) and add to sum_total. \n\nThen, the code checks if count_odds is odd. \n\nYes.\n\nSo after that:\n\nif mod(count_odds,2) /= 0 \n\nthen subtract the first element of the odds array (the first being the smallest after sorting). \n\nThus, sum_total becomes (sum_evens + sum_odds) - odds(1)\n\nelse \n\nnothing to do.\n\nThus, the code will have:\n\nsum_total = sum_total + sum(odds(1:count_odds))\n\nthen if (mod(count_odds,2) ==1) then \n\nsum_total = sum_total - odds(1) \n\nend if \n\nWait, but in the java code, the code did:\n\nfor each odd in odd list: adds to the sum. \n\nThen if odd count is odd, subtract the first element.\n\nThus, the same as the above.\n\nNow, the matter is how to compute the sum of the odds. \n\nIn fortran, use the sum intrinsic:\n\nsum_odds = sum(odds(1:count_odds))\n\nBut ensure that the array type is handled correctly. \n\nPutting all together, here is the code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_621_A \n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer :: n, count_odds, i,j \n\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum_total =0 \n\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: input_array(:), odds(:) \n\n    read(*,*) n \n\n    allocate( input_array(n) )\n\n    read(*,*) input_array(1:n) \n\n    count_odds =0 \n\n    sum_total =0 \n\n    ! collect odds:\n\n    allocate( odds(n) )\n\n    do i=1,n \n\n        if( mod( input_array(i), 2 ) ==0 ) then \n\n            sum_total = sum_total + input_array(i)\n\n        else \n\n            count_odds = count_odds +1 \n\n            odds(count_odds) = input_array(i)\n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    ! Now count_odds holds the number of odds, and odds array has count_odds elements \n\n    if ( count_odds >0 ) then \n\n        ! sort them \n\n        ! Need to call a sort routine on odds(1:count_odds)\n\n        call sort_odds(odds(1:count_odds), count_odds) \n\n        ! compute sum of odds and add to sum_total \n\n        sum_total = sum_total + sum( odds(1:count_odds) )\n\n        if ( mod(count_odds,2) .ne.0 ) then \n\n            sum_total = sum_total - odds(1) \n\n        end if \n\n    else \n\n        ! no odds, so no change (sum remains the total)\n\n    end if \n\n    print*, sum_total \n\n    deallocate( input_array, odds ) \n\ncontains \n\n    subroutine sort_odds(arr,n) \n\n        integer(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n \n\n        integer :: i, min_idx, temp \n        do i =1, n \n\n            min_idx= i \n\n            do j=i+1, n \n\n                if ( arr(j) < arr(min_idx) ) then \n\n                    min_idx =j \n\n                end if \n\n            end do \n\n            ! swap \n\n            if ( min_idx /=i ) then \n\n                temp = arr(i) \n\n                arr(i) = arr(min_idx) \n\n                arr(min_idx)= temp \n\n            end if \n\n        end do \n\n    end subroutine sort_odds \n\nend program \n\nWait need to ensure that the sorting is done properly.\n\nWait in the subroutine sort_odds, when we call it and pass odds(1:count_odds), but since the array was allocated with size n, the slicing odds(1:count_odds) is okay. However, in the subroutine, the arr is the array passed. But the subroutine can have passed an array of any length, since the size is passed as n variable.\n\nWait in the sort_odds sub, arr is an array of any size, but n is passed as the size.\n\nIn the function, the parameters should have arr, which is a 1D array and n as its length. \n\nWait, in the code above, the subroutine's declaration is:\n\ninteger(kind=8), intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\nSo that can handle any size. The count is passed as n, so that it can function.\n\nTherefore, this should work. \n\nWait, in the program body, the array odds is allocated size n, but after count_odds is known, we fill odds up to count_odds. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nNow, checking for possible mistakes:\n\n- The input reading may not be done properly. In the code after reading n, the input_array is read with read(*,*) input_array(1:n). \n\nWait that is correct: in Fortran, read (*,*) with an array: the read will fill in the array in one read (if the input is space separated?)\n\nYes, in Fortran, the read statement for the array can read all n integers in one line, as long as they are separated by spaces. \n\nAnother point: in Java, the list is stored in the order they are read, but the For does sorting (ascending). The selection sort will sort them in order, and thus the first element is the smallest. \n\nThus, the code's logic is same as Java.\n\nTesting edge cases: \n\nTest case where n=1, the only number is 1 (odd). count_odds is 1. thus, since 1 is odd, after adding all odds (sum becomes 1 (even plus no evens) +1 =2? Wait original sum_even was 0 (even is 1? No, 1 is odd, so evens sum is 0. Then adding the odd. sum_total after adding odds becomes 0+1=1. and since count_odds is 1 (which is odd), subtract the first element (1), so total becomes 0. \n\nOutput would be 0, which is even. \n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3 \n\nthen:\n\nevens are just 2 (sum_even=2).\n\nodds are 1,3 \u2192 count_odds=2, even.\n\nsorted odds are [1,3], so their sum is 4. added to 2, total 6. \n\nThus output 6.\n\nAnother case:\n\n3 numbers: 1,3,5 \u2192 count_odds=3 (odd)\n\nsum_evens is 0. sum_odds (1+3+5=9) \u2192 total 9 then.\n\nsince count_odds 3 is odd, subtract the smallest, 1 \u2192 9-1=8 \u2192 which is correct. \n\nThus, code should output 8.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, check the fortran code for any possible bugs.\n\nThe code may have issues with the proxy for the array in the sort function, but with the selection sort, it should be okay. \n\nAlso, the odds array is allocated with size n. For example, even if count_odds is less than n, that's okay since only the first count_odds elements are used. \n\nAnother possible error: in the code, after reading inputs, the input_array is of size n. But when counting the odds, that loop is correctly taking the elements from there.\n\nSo, that should be okay. \n\nAlso, variables are of kind 8 which corresponds to long in Java (64 bits). Thus, handling larger numbers.\n\nYes, so the code should be correct."
