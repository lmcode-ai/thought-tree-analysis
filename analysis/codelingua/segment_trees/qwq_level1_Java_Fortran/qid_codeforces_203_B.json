Then the expression is now 9. So the check is whether the new value equals 9. So the code does: increment, check if after increment it equals 9. So in Fortran, the statement is:\n\nblack(xx,yy) = black(xx,yy)+1\n\nthen check if black(xx,yy) ==9. So same as Java. Thus, the code seems correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The problem is probably from Codeforces problem 203B. The code reads N and M, then M pairs of (x, y). For each point, it increments the count in the surrounding 3x3 cells in a grid, and when any cell reaches 9 (meaning all 9 of its possible states are hit?), it prints the current M and exits. If none reach 9 after M steps, output -1.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, I need to replicate the logic. The main parts are: handling input, the grid, loops, and checking conditions.\n\nIn Java, the grid is initialized as (N+2)x(N+2), which probably because indices start from 0 or 1, allowing borders to handle edge cases without checking. In Fortran, arrays are declared with explicit sizes. The original code uses 1-based indices for the black array because it's initialized from N+2, and the loops from 1 to M. So in Fortran, I'll declare the black array as (0:N+1, 0:N+1) to have similar bounds. Wait, but in Java it's N+2 because arrays are 0-based, but the code starts m at 1 and loops m from 1 to M. Let me double-check:\n\nOriginal Java code initializes black as new int[N+2][N+2], which gives indexes from 0 to N+1. But the loops for x and y processing start at x-1, etc. So maybe the grid's indexes (xx and yy) can go from 0 to N+1? Well, the initial values x can be as low as 1 (since x is input, which might be 1?), so x-1 would be 0. That's why the array is N+2 in both dimensions.\n\nSo in Fortran, array indices can start at 1, but here maybe we can set them from 0? Wait no, Fortran allows array declarations with any lower bounds, so perhaps best to make it from 0: (0:N+1, 0:N+1). Alternatively, we can start at 1 but adjust variables accordingly, but maybe it's easier to stick with the same indices as Java.\n\nFortran arrays are declared as, for example, integer, dimension(0:N+1, 0:N+1) :: black. But since N is read from input, we might need an allocatable array. Wait, but in Fortran, we need to know the sizes at compile time unless using allocatables. Hmm, so N is input, so it's variable. So yes, need to use an allocatable array.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read N and M from input.\n\nIn Fortran, we can read with read(*,*) variables, but variables must be declared first.\n\n2. Declare the 2D array black as allocatable. The array's dimensions will depend on N: from 0 to N+1 on each side. Because N can vary, we'll have to allocate as (dim1, dim2), where dim1 starts at 0 and goes to N+1, etc. But in Fortran, arrays are declared with lower and upper bounds, so perhaps:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: black(:,:)\n\nallocate(black(0:N+1,0:N+1))\n\n3. Initialize all elements of black to 0. In Fortran, the allocate statement would automatically initialize to zero for integers? Wait, no, in Fortran, allocation does not initialize values. So we have to set all to zero first. We can use a loop, but more efficiently, use a do loop:\n\ndo i = 0, N+1\n   do j = 0, N+1\n      black(i,j) = 0\n   end do\nend do\n\nAlternatively, use a FORALL or some intrinsic function but maybe simplest way is with a double loop.\n\n4. Then loop over M times:\n\ndo m = 1, M\n\nread x and y:\n\nread(*,*) x, y\n\nThen for each point (x,y), we loop over the 3x3 grid around it. In the Java code, the loops for xx and yy start at x-1 to x+1, same for y, so that's three values each (so 3x3 cells).\n\nIn Fortran, loops can be similar, but note that variables need to be declared.\n\ndeclare variables:\n\ninteger :: m, x, y, xx, yy, N, M\n\nBut in the code, N and M are needed. So variable declarations first.\n\nLet me outline the structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_203_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, M, m, x, y, xx, yy\n    integer, allocatable :: black(:,:)\n\n    ! Read N and M\n    read(*,*) N, M\n\n    ! Allocate the array with 0:N+1 on both axes\n    allocate(black(0:N+1, 0:N+1))\n\n    ! Initialize all elements to 0\n    black = 0  ? Wait: Does this work? Assigning a scalar to an array. Yes, in Fortran, black = 0 sets all elements to zero. Or perhaps the earlier loops are needed. So better to assign 0 to entire array. Yes, faster.\n\nWait yes, that's better. Because in the Java code, the black array is initialized to zero. So:\n\nblack = 0\n\nSo that's the initialization done.\n\nThen, loop through M times. For each m from 1 to M:\n\ndo m = 1, M\n\n   read(*,*) x, y\n\n   ! Now loop over the 3x3 square around (x,y)\n   do xx=x-1, x+1\n      do yy=y-1, y+1\n          ! Increment black here\n          black(xx,yy) = black(xx,yy) + 1\n          if (black(xx,yy) == 9) then\n              write(*,*) m\n              deallocate(black)\n              stop  ! exit program\n          end if\n      end do\n   end do\n\nend do  ! end of m loop\n\nAfter the loop, if none hit 9, then print -1.\n\nwrite(*,*) -1\n\nBut also need to clean up the allocatable array. After printing -1, deallocate black.\n\nWait, in Fortran when you stop the program, maybe deallocation is handled, but to be safe, perhaps put deallocate after the loops and after the -1.\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, when the condition hits, it returns immediately, which in Fortran would only terminate in a subroutine, but here in the main program, exit the program.\n\nAlternatively, after writing m, we should stop the program. So in the if statement block, after writing m, we can deallocate and stop.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, if you exit, do you need to explicitly stop? Let me think.\n\nIn the loops, once that condition is hit, you can just write the output and exit the program, either with a STOP statement or return from the program.\n\nSo inside the loop over xx and yy:\n\n    ... the increment, then check:\n\n    if (black (xx,yy) ==9 ) then\n       write(*,*) m\n       deallocate(black)\n       stop\n    end if\n\nWait, but perhaps after the check, you can break out of all the loops and exit.\n\nAlternatively, to make it as efficient as possible, when the condition is met, do the print, clean up, and exit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a loop exit.\n\nWait, but the code may have multiple hits, but the program just needs the first occurrence of any cell reaching 9. So once the if condition is true, we can stop.\n\nAlternatively, after writing and before deallocate, return from the program with STOP.\n\nThe code sequence in Fortran:\n\nSo first, variable declarations:\n\nWe need to declare variables first in the program.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, when reading x,y, read statements are used, and they can be in-line.\n\nWait, the variables need to be declared before usage. So, the declarations are at the top of the program.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_203_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, M, m, x, y, xx, yy\n    integer, allocatable :: black(:,:)\n\n    read(*,*) N, M\n\n    allocate(black(0:N+1, 0:N+1))\n    black = 0 ! set all elements to 0\n\n    do m = 1, M\n        read(*,*) x, y\n\n        do xx = x-1, x+1\n            do yy = y-1, y+1\n                black(xx,yy) = black(xx,yy) + 1\n                if (black(xx,yy) == 9) then\n                    write(*,*) m\n                    deallocate(black)\n                    stop\n                end if\n            end do\n        end do\n    end do\n\n    ! If we get here, output -1\n    write(*,*) -1\n    deallocate(black)\n    stop\n\nend program codeforces_203_B\n\nWait, some points to check:\n\nIs the read statement correctly reading x and y. The original code uses the Scanner, so in Java, it's nextInt(), so in Fortran, it expects integer inputs, but the input may have lines like N M followed by M lines each with two integers x y.\n\nWait yes, in the first line, after N and M, each line is a pair x and y. So for each m, read a line with x and y. So the read(*,*) x,y is correct.\n\nWait about the indexing in Fortran: in the Java code, the black array is N+2 in size. The indexes run from 0 (since in Java arrays start at 0) up to N+1. In Fortran's case, since we allocated black (0:N+1, ...), which is exactly the same, 0-based on each dimension. So the code can directly map.\n\nAnother point: in the Java code, the following is done:\n\nfor (int m = 1; m <= M; m++) {\n    x = ...\n    for loops over xx and y\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the loop over m is from 1 to M with m=1,M so same thing.\n\nAnother thing is that after incrementing, we check if the value becomes exactly 9. The Java code does \"if (++black[xx][yy] ==9)\", which means that it increments first, then the value. Wait no, in Java, the ++operator does pre-increment, so:\n\nblack[xx][yy] was, say, 8. Then the expression is now 9. So the check is whether the new value equals 9. So the code does: increment, check if after increment it equals 9.\n\nSo in Fortran, the statement is:\n\nblack(xx,yy) = black(xx,yy)+1\n\nthen check if black(xx,yy) ==9. So same as Java.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in fortran, loops can start at xx=x-1 and go to x+1, so that's 3 iterations (x-1, x, x+1). Same as Java.\n\nWait, Java for xx from x-1 to x+1 inclusive, so three steps. Same in Fortran.\n\nAnother thing: Fortran uses 1-based indices by default, but in this case, since the array is allocated from 0:N+1, the indices are okay.\n\nTesting edge cases: what if x is 1? Then x-1 is 0, which is within the array's bounds (0 to N+1). Similarly for x = N, then x+1 is N+1. So the array boundaries are correct. So that seems okay.\n\nAlso, after the m is printed, before exiting, we need to free the allocated memory. So calling deallocate(black) then stop is correct. Else, when the program ends normally (printing -1), we should also deallocate. So the code includes the deallocate(black) both after success and after failure.\n\nTesting that in the code:\n\nThe successful path (when a cell reaches 9), writes m, then deallocate and stop.\n\nThe else path, after the loops, we have:\n\nwrite -1 \n\nthen deallocate(black), and then stop.\n\nYes, so both paths get deallocated, which is good.\n\nPotential issue: what if N is 0? Well, the problem depends on N and M being valid, etc., but as per the problem's constraints, perhaps such edge cases are not required here.\n\nAnother point: in the Fortran code, after reading x,y, they might be out of the grid? For example, if the problem assumes that all x and y are between 1 and N, but the Java code does not check that because the surrounding loops. For instance, if x is N+1 or something, then x+1 could be N+2 which is beyond the upper limit (which is N+1). Wait, the problem's input constraints must ensure that x and y are within 1..N, so that x\u00b11 won't cause overflows. Since the problem's original code from codeforces does this, perhaps the code can proceed assuming the input is valid.\n\nBut in codeforces problems, inputs are usually legal. So no need to handle that here.\n\nConclusion: the Fortran code should look like the one above."
