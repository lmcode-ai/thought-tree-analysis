So, here is the plan for each section:\n\n- The first case (n ==0, m ! =0): write \"Impossible\", with a new line (write(*,*) \"Impossible\"). Then, for the case where n ! =0 and m <=n:\n\n    set m to 1, if m is zero (because in this case, n is non-zero, so m cannot be zero unless user input 0 at that point). Then output n followed by m+n-1, with a space between, and NO newline. So in Fortran code:\n\n    if (m ==0) m =1\n\n    write(*, 100) n, (m +n -1)\n\n100 format( i0, 1x, i0 )\n\n    stop \n\nBut how to ensure no newline.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe Java program reads two integers, n and m, from the input. Then it checks several conditions and prints different outputs based on those conditions. \n\nFirst, if n is 0, it checks if m is not 0. If so, it prints \"Impossible\". Otherwise, it outputs \"0 0\" and exits. \n\nNext, if m is less than or equal to n, and if m is 0 (then it sets m to 1?), then it prints n followed by m + n - 1. Wait, actually, looking at the code again: in the 'if (m == 0)' block, they set m to 1, but since m was already <= n which is non-zero (since n is not 0 here), but maybe that's part of the logic. Wait no, the code after if(m <=n) { ... } so in the m <=n case, the code says if m is 0, set m to 1? Wait, the code says:\n\nif (m <=n) {\n    if (m ==0) m =1;\n    System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n    return;\n}\n\nSo when m is 0 but n is non-zero (since we are in the m<=n block after checking n !=0 earlier), then set m to 1, then output n and (m +n-1). Wait, but why set m to 1?\n\nHmm, the code's logic is a bit tricky. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nOriginal Java code structure:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int n = sc.nextInt();\n    int m = sc.nextInt();\n\n    if (n ==0) {\n        if (m !=0) System.out.println(\"Impossible\");\n        else System.out.println(0 + \" \" + 0);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (m <=n) {\n        if (m ==0) {\n            m =1;\n        }\n        System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // else case when m >n:\n    System.out.print(m + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n}\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: n is zero. Then check m:\n\n- if m is non-zero \u2192 print impossible.\n- if m is zero \u2192 0 0.\n\nOtherwise (n not zero):\n\nCheck if m \u2264n.\n\n- If yes: then check if m is zero \u2192 set m to 1. Then print n followed by (m+n-1). \n\nWait, but why is m being set to 1 here?\n\nWait in the first case where n is non-zero and m is 0, then m is set to 1? Because m could be zero. For example, if n=5 and m=0, then since 0 \u22645, the program sets m=1, so the first number printed is 5 (n) and the second is (1 + 5 -1) =5. So the output becomes 5 5.\n\nWait why that logic? The problem might be that the original code might have some constraints based on the problem it's solving. Since the problem name is \"codeforces_190_A\", maybe it's problem A from codeforces 190, which I can check, but maybe the code is handling edge cases here.\n\nBut regardless of that, the code's logic is straightforward as per its structure. So as a translator, I must replicate that in Fortran.\n\nSo now, translating this code to Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran's input handling. In Java, we use Scanner, similarly, in Fortran, we can read from standard input using read(*,*) variables.\n\nFortran uses functions like WRITE for output. Also, in Fortran, variables must be declared.\n\nThe code structure:\n\nSubroutine main() ?\n\nWait, Fortran uses programs, so we can have a program codeforces_190_A, and inside, declarations, then code.\n\nFirst, variables n and m are integers.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nStep 1: Read n and m from input.\n\nREAD*, n, m\n\nThen, check if n is zero:\n\nif (n ==0) then:\n\n    check if m is not zero \u2192 output Impossible.\n\n    else \u2192 output 0 0. Then exit the program.\n\nElse:\n\n    check if (m <=n):\n\n        if yes:\n\n            if m is 0 \u2192 set m =1\n\n            output: n (space) (m +n -1)\n\n        else: (m>n)\n\n            output: m (space) (m +n -1)\n\nWait the else part (when m >n) is handled by the code's last else, which just outputs m and (m+n-1).\n\nSo now, the steps in Fortran code.\n\nBut note that in Fortran, the code will be structured with if-then-else blocks, variables must be declared first.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, integers can be declared as INTEGER :: n, m, etc.\n\nAlso, output with WRITE statements. For \"Impossible\", we can use WRITE(*,*) 'Impossible'\n\nWait, but to print two values separated by space, we can use the WRITE statement with a format, or let the default output handle spaces between variables.\n\nWait in Fortran's default format, when you write *, then integers are separated by one or more spaces. So for example:\n\nWRITE(*,*) n, m will display n and m separated by space, then a new line.\n\nHowever, the Java code in some cases uses System.out.print (without a new line), but in other cases uses printLine (with new line). Wait, in the first branch:\n\nIn the n==0 case, the code has:\n\nif (m !=0) System.out.println(\"Impossible\");\n\nelse System.out.println(0 + \" \" +0); \n\nThese are printLines, so with newlines. Then returns.\n\nIn the other cases (the m <=n part or else), the code has System.out.print(...) followed by return. So that should end with two numbers separated by space, but no newline? Wait no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the Java code code:\n\nIn case of n=0, else, after printing lines (with newlines), return.\n\nIn other cases, after the if/else:\n\nIn the m <=n case: after the print, return. The code uses System.out.print (so just a space between the numbers, but without new line). Wait no! Wait the Java code's print statements are using print, not println. For example:\n\nIn the case where m <=n: after the condition, the code does System.out.print(n + \" \" + ...).\n\nWait wait, in the code for m<=n, the code enters the first case and:\n\n    if (m ==0) then set m=1.\n\n    then System.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1));\n\nWait, in Java, if you use print, not println, then the output is printed without a new line. But in the case of the code, since after the print comes a return; so there's no other code after that, so the output is just the two numbers with a space between, no linefeed.\n\nWait but in Java, when you use System.out.print followed by returning, it may not output a new line, so the output is two numbers with a space, then nothing. However, when using the System.out.println (which adds a newline), that's different.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nThe first two branches (the first being n==0 case) use System.out.println, so they add new lines.\n\nThe other branches (the m<=n and m>n cases) use System.out.print (without the ln, so no newline). But then the program exits (return) immediately after.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, the WRITE statements always end with a new line unless specified with an explicit format.\n\nThus, this discrepancy will need attention.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem's requirements it's okay to have trailing newlines since the problem might accept any output as long as the numbers are separated properly. But we need to match the exact Java output behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem's test cases, it doesn't care about trailing new lines. But for the code translation, perhaps we can proceed with outputting the numbers separated by space and perhaps a new line.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the Java code. \n\nLooking at the Java code's first case (n ==0 and m==0):\n\nthe code prints 0 0 with a new line (due to println). \n\nIn the other case where m is not 0, it prints \"Impossible\" with a new line.\n\nBut in the other branches (when n !=0):\n\nfor the m <=n block: \n\nSystem.out.print(...) \u2192 the output is numbers separated by a space, then (since it is a print and not a println, followed by return so it stops here with no new line. So the output would be \"5 8\", with no new line. \n\nBut this would be problematic as JVM adds the \"\\n\" only when you do println, otherwise, it just prints the string and stops.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, if we use WRITE(*,*) it will terminate with a new line. So this discrepancy will lead to different outputs. Hmm.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So how can we replicate the behavior of Java's print (without newline)?\n\nBecause in Fortran's default, the explicit format is needed for that.\n\nHmm. To write without a new line, perhaps we can use a single statement which writes both numbers separated by space, without a new line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let me think again. Maybe in the problem's test cases, the outputs have a line ending. But perhaps the problem expects the newline. \n\nLooking at the problem possibly being 190A from codeforces (since the java class is named codeforces_190_A), I can check the problem details.\n\nLet me assume that the problem requires the output to be exactly the two numbers with a space, possibly followed by a new line. Since in Java, when you use 'print' and a Line in the code but ends with return, the output may not have a newline. However, perhaps in code forces, the expected output is the exact line. Let me check problem 190A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's required output requires the two numbers followed by a new line. Let me look up the problem.\n\nLooking up Codeforces problem 190A. \n\nProblem \"Large Subtraction\" (maybe?) the problem 190A is \"Cubes\".\n\nWait 190A is called \"Cubes\".\n\nThe problem (brief idea from the problem description):\n\nYou have two cubes with numbers written on them. You want to form numbers up to m. Find the smallest cube lengths n1 and n2 such that together they can be used to display any number from 1 to m inclusive. Each cube has distinct numbers, but the numbers can be from 0-9 or maybe including some other rules.\n\nThen, the program's output is two numbers separated by space, or impossible. So the program outputs two numbers with a space, followed by a new line perhaps.\n\nLooking back at the Java code, the first branch uses System.out.println for both cases. In the other branches (the m<=n and else) the code uses System.out.print which does NOT add a new line, but the problem expects that the output is exactly two numbers, so the newline is needed. Or does the code actually need to have the newline?\n\nWait the Java code uses System. out. print (the output in the else-blocks), and then returns and exits. If it doesn\u2019t print a newline, but the program exits, then the printed text may not have a newline. However, in Java, after the print, the program termination may leave the last line without a newline. This could lead to output that is considered wrong by online judges, unless they are lenient. Therefore, maybe it's a mistake in the Java code, but to match it exactly, it's better to see what the code does.\n\nWait in the code when n !=0 and m is > n, then it does:\n\nSystem.out.print(m + \" \" + (m+n -1)).\n\nWhich is a print without a newline. So in the sample input, for example, suppose n=5 and m=4, then the code prints \"5 8\" (from m=4: (4+5-1)=8, so code prints \"5 8\" then return.)\n\nThen, since there is no newline, the program's output would be \"5 8\" without a newline. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a mistake and should have used println. The problem's correct solution is likely expecting the two numbers followed by a newline.\n\nTherefore, maybe in the Java code, it's a mistake, and perhaps the Fortran translation must adhere to the problem requirements rather than the Java code's mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we need to translate it exactly as per the Java code. So, in the case of the Java using print instead of println, then the Fortran code must also not add a new line in those branches.\n\nHmm, getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of solutions.\n\nIn Fortran, if we write write(*,*) a, b \u2192 this writes a and b with a space separator, followed by a new line.\n\nAlternatively, if we write write(*, '(I0,A,I0)') a,\" \",b \u2192 but that might have issues with the delimiter.\n\nAlternatively, using write statement with formatting.\n\nAlternatively we can write without the space by doing write(*, '(A)'), trim(adjustl(strtrim(a)))// \" \"// trim( adjustl(strtrim(b)) ), but that's complicated.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to write two numbers separated by a space, regardless of newline. Because the problem expects the two numbers separated by space, but with a newline at the end. Because for example, the first cases uses System.out.println, which includes a newline, but the other branches do a print followed by return.\n\nAh, if so, then the Java code may have a bug here because the program produces a different number of newlines depending on the branch. For example:\n\nIf the code path is printing the \"Impossible \" case, it uses a println, so the output has a newline. \n\nIn the n==0 and m ==0 case, \"0 0\\n\" is printed. \n\nIn the other non-n==0 cases:\n\nWhen n is non-zero and m is 3, n=5, then the code would print via \"print\" which would emit the number with space, and no newline. \n\nHowever, perhaps in codeforces, the checker ignores trailing spaces and newlines. So as long as the output is two numbers with a space between them, it\u2019s okay. But in the case of \"Impossible\", it must have only that, with or without a \\n.\n\nSo perhaps in the Fortran code, it's okay to print with new line in all cases. Therefore, perhaps the Java code has a bug, and the Fortran code should output with new line in all cases. \n\nAlternatively, if we have to to follow the code exactly, perhaps use the same approach: in all cases, print with newlines except when not needed. \n\nBut in Fortran, the default write statement adds a new line. So in cases where Java uses print, we can do:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') trim(adjustl(stra))//' '//trim(adjustl(strb))\n\nwhere stra is a string of the first num and strb of the second. Then, the '(A)' specifies to output as a character string without a new line.\n\nAlternatively, using edit descriptor to control the new line.\n\nHmm. Let me outline the Fortran code.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\n      integer :: n, m\n\nRead the inputs:\n\n   read*, n, m\n\nThen checks:\n\n   if (n ==0) then\n\n       if (m /=0) then\n\n           write(*,*) \"Impossible\"\n\n           stop\n\n        else\n\n           write(*,*) \"0 0\"\n\n           stop\n\n        end if\n\n    else\n\n        if (m <=n) then\n\n            if (m ==0) then\n\n                m =1\n\n            end if\n\n            write(*,*) n, (m + n -1)\n\n            stop\n\n        else\n\n            write(*,*) m, (m +n -1)\n\n            stop\n\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nWait but wait: in this code, all the output statements use write(*,*) which adds a new line. So for the cases where the java code used \"print\" (without new line) but here with \"println\", the Fortran code would be adding a new line, which would be different. However, in the problem's test case, maybe it's acceptable as trailing new lines are ignored. Or perhaps the Java code's print is incorrect and the Fortran is following the correct path by adding the newline, which is what the problem expects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires exactly the outputs with no trailing new line when using print, but that would be hard to fix in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, the Fortran code can use an edit descriptor which does not add the new line.\n\nUse:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') trim(adjustl(str1)) // ' ' // trim( adjustl(str2) )\n\nwhere str1 and str2 are strings derived from each variable.\n\nHence, perhaps in Fortran, to replicate the exact output (without newline), one must do:\n\n ...\n\nIn the m<=n case:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, 1X, I0)') n, (m +n-1)\n\nand similarly for other branches, then terminate. But this way, it will output the two numbers separated by a space, and no new line. But how to get that.\n\nAlternatively, the format is (I0, 1X, I0) \u2192 the I0 is a format that writes the integer as a string, then space, then the next. This won't have a trailing new line.\n\nSo the write statement with this format and unit * would send output without a newline?\n\nWait in Fortran, the default record I/O does have a carriage control, but in modern settings, * as the format_number implies list-directed formatting. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, when using explicit format edit descriptors with a WRITE statement without new line, we can do that via format string.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use:\n\nwrite(*,100) n, (m+n -1)\n\n100 format( i0, 1x, i0 )\n\nThat would output the two numbers with space, without any newline, because the format doesn't end with a / , which is the advance. So the next write would write after that.\n\nWait, the format statement format( i0, 1x, i0 ) will output the numbers separated by a space, and then the current position is after the last character. Thus, the next line would output after.\n\nTherefore, the desired behavior is achieved.\n\nHence, for the cases where the Java code uses print (without newline), the Fortran code must do the same, ensuring there's no extra new line.\n\nSo for the cases where the Java code does System.out.println \u2192 use format ending with / ?\n\nWait no. Wait newline can be forced by a / in format. So for example:\n\nformat( i0, 1x, i0, / ) will add a new line. Omitting the slash, it won't.\n\nHence, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, for the \"Impossible\" case, the java code writes with a newline, so we must have the Fortran code do the same. So that is okay with a default write(*,*) which adds the new line.\n\nSo, here is the plan for each section:\n\n- The first case (n ==0, m !=0): write \"Impossible\", with a new line (write(*,*) \"Impossible\").\n\nThen, for the case where n !=0 and m <=n:\n\n    set m to 1, if m is zero (because in this case, n is non-zero, so m cannot be zero unless user input 0 at that point).\n\n    Then output n followed by m+n-1, with a space between, and NO newline.\n\n    So in Fortran code:\n\n    if (m ==0) m =1\n\n    write(*, 100) n, (m +n -1)\n\n100 format( i0, 1x, i0 )\n\n    stop \n\nBut how to ensure no newline. So using the format without /.\n\nSimilarly for the m>n else case, code outputs m and m+n-1 with a space, no newline.\n\nThe other cases with the first branches use println which do add new lines, so use write as before.\n\nPutting all this together:\n\nNow, coding in Fortran:\n\nHere's the outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_190_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, m\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n\n  if (n ==0) then\n\n    if (m /=0) then\n\n      write(*,*) \"Impossible\"\n\n    else\n\n      write(*,*) 0, 0\n\n    end if\n\n    stop\n\n  end if\n\n  if(m <= n) then\n\n    if(m ==0) then\n\n      m =1\n\n    end if\n\n    write(*,100) n, m + n -1\n\n    stop\n\n  else\n\n    write(*,100) m, m +n -1\n\n    stop\n\n  end if\n\n100 format( i0, 1x, i0 )\n\nend program codeforces_190_A\n\nWait but this way:\n\nWhen we use write with format 100, then it writes the numbers with a space between, no newline. \n\nHowever, in the cases where m<=n and n is non-zero, the code outputs numbers without a newline. But if you run this code on a system without a newline, then after execution, the prompt might be on the same line, but online judges usually read the output until a newline. Therefore, this could be a problem.\n\nWait, in codeforces, for this problem, perhaps the output must end with a new line? The problem statement might require that.\n\nIn the Java code's case, when it uses System.out.print, the program exits, so the final output is the two numbers followed by whatever is after. But the judge may read all the input until end of stream. Typically, online judges expect that the submission's output ends with a new line.\n\nTherefore, possibly the code's print should be replaced with a println. So the original Java code may have a mistake and the Fortran code can just use write with a new line in all cases, so that the outputs always have newlines.\n\nTherefore, rewriting with all outputs having new lines:\n\nChange formatted to add new line:\n\nBut in the case of the format:\n\nformat( i0, 1x, i0, / )\n\nThe trailing slash adds a new line.\n\nHence, modify the format to have / at the end.\n\nWait the format with / is to advance to a new line. Hence:\n\nThe format can be:\n\n100 format( i0, 1x, i0, / )\n\nThen, in all cases the outputs are with newlines.\n\nAlternatively, use write(*,*) which does the same thing.\n\nWait the initial code:\n\nIn the first cases, the Fortran code uses write(*,*) \"Impossible\" (with new line).\n\nIn the other branches, using the format, and omit the stop when using the format.\n\nWait perhaps for all cases except the first (the n=0 and m\u22600 and n=0 m=0) cases, we can use write with an asterisk:\n\nSo:\n\nprogram codeforces_190_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\nread *, n, m\n\nif (n ==0) then\n\n    if (m /=0) then\n\n        write(*,*) \"Impossible\"\n\n    else\n\n        write(*,*) \"0 0\"\n\n    end if\n\nelse\n\n    if (m <= n) then\n\n        if (m ==0) then\n\n            m =1\n\n        end if\n\n        write(*,*) n, (m + n -1)\n\n    else\n\n        write(*,*) m, (m +n -1)\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nend program codeforces_190_A\n\nWait this is simpler. Let's see:\n\nIn the case where n is not zero and the m <=n, we use print*, which outputs a space and new line.\n\nThe same for the else part (output uses * and new line).\n\nThis way, all outputs include a newline. That might be the correct approach, as the problem may expect that.\n\nThe original Java code for those non-n=0 branches had the code:\n\nSystem.out.print(...) \u2192 which doesn't add newline, then a return.\n\nBut in Fortran, this code uses print*, which adds a new line, and there's no return (but the program just exits after the writes).\n\nWait:\n\nFor example, the case with n=5 and m=3 (m<=n):\n\nthe Java code would write \"5 7\" followed by return \u2192 so the line is \"5 7\".\n\nThe Fortran code would write 5 7 followed by a new line \u2192 \"5 7\\n\".\n\nSimilarly, online judges usually accept either (if only the numbers are correct), but perhaps the problem expects outputs to be with newlines. Since the Java code's other branches might have a mistake in not adding newlines but the problem requires it, thus replicating the code with newlines is the way to go.\n\nThis seems reasonable. So the Fortran code would be as outlined above.\n\nLet me check again the original Java code:\n\nLooking again, in the non-n=0 cases:\n\nThe code has in the m <=n case:\n\nSystem.out.print(n + ...)\n\nthen return \u2192 so output is the numbers without a newline.\n\nBut if we write in Fortran with *, that adds a new line, which might be different.\n\nHmm. Maybe that is error-prone.\n\nIf the Java code in this case outputs without a newline, but other code does, how to represent in Fortran?\n\nLet me see, perhaps the problem requires that all outputs end with a newline. Because in coding competition problems, you must output the correct line either with a newline or the judge may treat it as wrong. \n\nMany online judges require that, so likely the correct code (the Java code has bug, but since the problem is from codeforces, maybe it was tested and correct). Wait, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait the problem from Codeforces 190A (Cubes) requires to output two space separated integers or \"Impossible\".\n\nTherefore, the correct output should have a trailing newline.\n\nSo the Java code for the cases where it prints with print (with System.out.print) instead of println, then the outputs may not have the final newline. So that code would fail in codeforces because the output is missing a newline. Therefore the java code is wrong, and the Fortran code must output with newlines, so perhaps the correct approach is to fix this in the translation.\n\nWait why would the Java code pass?\n\nWait perhaps the problem's test cases do not require a final newline. But I think they do require that.\n\nAlternatively perhaps, the judge will treat trailing spaces or new lines as negligible.\n\nIn any case, the user wants to translate the given Java code to Fortran, so we must follow the code's behavior, even if it has bugs.\n\nSo the Java code's outputs are:\n\n- For n=0 and m !=0 \u2192 \"Impossible\" with a new line.\n\n- For n=0 and m=0 \u2192 \"0 0\" with new line.\n\n- For n >0 and m<=n: system.out.print(n + \" \" + (m +n -1)), which is for example n=5, m=3 \u2192 prints \"5 7\", without new line. Then return.\n\nTherefore this outputs until the next line is not present.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the code can do the same.\n\nTo print the numbers without a new line.\n\nThe way to do this could be:\n\nwrite (*, '(I0, \" \", I0)') value1, value2\n\nSo that's explicit formatting.\n\nBut in the code, let's see:\n\nIn the first part for n ==0 cases:\n\nThe existing Java code uses System.out.println \u2192 output with new line, so Fortran's write(*,*) is correct.\n\nIn the branches where m <=n or else (the non-n=0 cases):\n\n- they use system.out.print \u2192 so the corresponding Fortran code must print without new line.\n\nThus, the code needs to:\n\nFor the n not zero case, and when m <=n:\n\ncompute the values and write without a new line.\n\nHence, code structure with explicit format:\n\nTherefore, revise the Fortran code as:\n\nprogram codeforces_190_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\nread *, n, m\n\nif (n ==0) then\n\n    if (m ==0) then\n\n        write(*, '(I0, A, I0)') 0, ' ', 0\n\n    else\n\n        write(*, '(A)') 'Impossible'\n\n    end if\n\n    return\n\nelse if (m <=n) then\n\n    if (m ==0) m = 1\n\n    write(*, '(I0, A, I0)') n, ' ', (m+n -1)\n\n    return\n\nelse\n\n    write(*, '(I0, A, I0)') m, ' ', (m +n-1)\n\n    return\n\nend if\n\nend program codeforces_190_A\n\nWait but in this code, 'A' is for the space string.\n\nAlternatively, using the format:\n\nformat( I0, 1X, I0 )\n\nBut the write must not add a new line.\n\nSo creating a format with no new line, and outputting.\n\nSo:\n\n program test\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger n, m\n\n...\n\n format(100 format (I0, 1X, I0)\n\n if (m <=n) then\n\n write(*, 100) n, value \n\nend if \n\nBut to suppress the new line, the format must not end with a /, and when using the write statement with list of values, it should not automatically add /.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nThe default behavior of the fortian is that a write with *, * will append a new line. So when using explicit format, if the format is \"A, B\", with <CR>.\n\nWait if there's no / in the format, then the record is written but the file position isn't advanced to the next line.\n\nSo for example:\n\n write (*, '(I0, I0)' ) 5,6 \u2192 this will print 56 (without a space), but no new line ?\n\n Wait no I think the default for list-directed is new line, but explicit format?\n\nNo, the format's listing determines how the fields are written, but no line terminator except what's in the format.\n\nWait let's see the format line:\n\nThe format is specified as:  number, format string.\n\nThe format:\n\n format ( I0, 1X, I0 )\n\nwill produce number, space, number. Without any new line.\n\nThen, the next write to * would continue on the same line.\n\nHence, the code's output in the non-n=0 cases would put the numbers and the space without new line, and the program ends, so effectively the output has the two numbers on a single line, with no trailing newline.\n\nWhich matches the Java behavior.\n\nThe return statements after each write ensure program ends immediately.\n\nSo in this case, the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the n=0, m=0 case:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, A, I0)') 0, ' ', 0 \u2192 outputs \"0 0\".\n\nBecause between the first and second numbers is an A field, which is ' ', so the two numbers with space.\n\nThis outputs without a newline?\n\nWait, no because the format is specified with three elements: integer, character, integer. The character field is the space, so the write would be 0 followed by space, followed by 0, so \"0 0\".\n\nBut with the write(*, '(format)') syntax \u2192 the format is \"I0 we do each part: I0 (the first 0), then A which is the space character? No, wait a string.\n\nWait the code writes 0 followed by the second parameter (the string ' '), then the third parameter is 0?\n\nWait the format 0 has a sequence of data items:\n\nI0 is first item: 0 \u2192 first number.\n\nA (characters) is the &quot;/\u2019', so the second data is the string ' '.\n\nNext I0 is third parameter: 0 \u2192 third data.\n\nWait the format requires three items for the variables 0, [space string], 0, so the format should have three items.\n\nWait in the write(*, '(A)') 'Impossible' is correct, as (A) accepts a string.\n\nBut the first write in the n=0 case where m ==0:\n\nThe user is trying to write 0 and 0 separated by space. The example I had:\n\nwrite (*, '(I0,A,I0)') 0, ' ', 0\n\nWait the format string would be (I0, A, I0)\n\nThen, the three arguments are 0, the string ' ', and the other 0. So this would be \"0 \u201d (from first I0 0) then the A field is the ' ' string (so that's written next), then the third data is the \u2018remaining 0 \u2192 0 written via I0 \u2192 total is \"0 0\".\n\nThus, the write outputs the two integers with the space, but the format does not include a / (new line). Thus, this will output \"0 0\" without a new line?\n\n But the original Java code uses System.out.println for that case, which includes a new line. Hmm that is a conflict.\n\nAh, this is problematic. The Java code uses for the n==0 and m ==0 case System.out.println(\"0 \" + 0).\n\nWhich produces \"0 0\" followed by newline.\n\nBut the Fortran code in this case, with the proposed write( *, '(I0,A,I0)' ) 0, \" \", 0 \u2192 will output \"0 0\" without a new line?\n\nWait which is incorrect. We have to reproduce the Java code's behavior. Since the Java code uses println, the Fortran code should also have a newline there.\n\nAh, that's a problem. So the initial write for that case must have a new line.\n\nAh so the code for the n==0 and m==0 case must do something like:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0, 1X, I0)' ), followed by new line.\n\nWait but the format must include a / character to advance to new line.\n\nFor example: \n\n100  format (I0, 1X, I0, / )\n\n then write (*, 100) 0, 0.\n\n Similarly for the Impossible case: write (*,*) outputs with a new line, the format would be (A, /) \u2192\n\nSo this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for all those cases that require a newline, add / in the format.\n\nSo in the n==0 cases:\n\nif m ==0:\n\n write (*, '(I0, 1X, I0)' ) 0, 0 \u2192 without newline? No, because the problem requires a new line.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should have in that case:\n\n write (*, '(I0, 1X, I0,/)') 0,0  \u2192 the / adds new line.\n\n Similarly in the Impossible case:\n\n write (*, '(A,/)') 'Impossible' \u2192 adds newline.\n\nIn the sections where, in Java code, print is used (without new line), Fortran code must not include a / in the format.\n\nFor the other cases (m<=n and m> n), the Java uses print (no new line), thus, the Fortran code's format for those must not include/, so the outputs have no new line.\n\nNow\uff0c putting all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_190_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m\n\nread *, n, m\n\nif (n ==0) then\n\n    if (m /=0) then\n\n        write(*, '(A,/)' ) 'Impossible'\n\n    else\n\n        write (*, '(I0, 1X, I0, /)' ) 0, 0\n\n    end if\n\n    stop\n\nend if\n\n!\n\nif (m <=n) then\n\n    if (m ==0) m = 1\n\n    write( *, '(I0, 1X, I0)' ) n, m + n -1\n\nelse \n\n    write( *, '(I0, 1X, I0)' ) m, m + n -1\n\nend if \n\nend program\n\nWait but in this code above:\n\n- The 'stop' after the first block exits.\n\n- For the case where m<=n or else, the program writes using the format without a /. Therefore, the output will not have newline.\n\n- The code for those branches (the else part) lacks a return or stop; thus after write, it will continue to execute the next lines, but since it is the else, after the write, it may hit the program end. But execution stops after the write statements, since after the 'else' block, the stop after?\n\nNo, the code's structure is:\n\nAfter the n==0 check:\n\nif (m <=n) then\n\n   \u5982\u679c m\u662f0\u5219\u7f6e1\uff0c\u7136\u540e write with format( no / ), then program ends at the end of the WRITE?\n\n No, the code after the write requires a return, otherwise code will continue.\n\n Wait the code in the else clauses has no stop, so after the write is done, the program proceeds, and once upon the next line, after the else clause, it proceeds to end program, which is okay.\n\nSo the code will proceed past the end of the code, after each WRITE.\n\nThus:\n\nWhen m is 5, n=3:\n\nWe make to else clause \u2192 write (m (5), and 5+3-1=7 \u2192 write \"5 7\" with no new line. Then end of program \u2192 the output has \"5 7\".\n\n Which matches the Java code.\n\nSimilarly for the cases with new lines, this would be covered.\n\nThus this code is correct except for one thing:\n\nTheJava code for the m> n case does:\n\nSystem.out.print( m + \" \" + ... );\n\nThe Fortran code has a write which outputs that with space but no new line.\n\nYes, this code matches the Java's behavior precisely.\n\nThus this Fortran code is the translation. Thus the Fortran code is as follows:\n\nFinal code:\n\nprogram codeforces_190_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m\n\n    read *, n, m\n\n    if (n == 0) then\n        if (m /= 0) then\n            write (*, '(A,/)') 'Impossible'\n        else\n            write (*, '(I0,1X,I0,/)') 0, 0\n        end if\n        return\n    end if\n\n    if (m <= n) then\n        if (m == 0) m = 1\n        write (*, '(I0,1X,I0)') n, (m + n - 1)\n    else\n        write (*, '(I0,1X,I0)') m, (m + n - 1)\n    end if\n\n    return\nend program codeforces_190_A\n\nWait but the \"return\" is not necessary. Since in Fortran, procedure exits when the program ends the block.\n\nAnother note: the 'implicit none' is crucial to prevent implicit typing.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nCase1: n=0 and m=0:\n\noutput: 0 0 (no new line? No, because in the format has \"/\", so there's a new line.\n\nWait:\n\nIn Fortran, the format '(I0,1X,I0,/)'\n\nThe last / is a new line, so after outputting \u20180 0\u2019, then the / will advance the record.\n\nThus the code will have \u201c0 0\\n\u201d.\n\nThe Java code for that case uses System.out.println \u2192 also has new line.\n\nGood.\n\n \n\nCase2: n=5 and m=3:\n\nm <=5 \u2192 yes.\n\nm is not zero, so write 5 followed by (3+5-1) =7 \u2192 \u20185 7\u2019 no new line.\n\nThen program exits. So the Fortran outputs \u20185 7\u2019, without newline.\n\nWhich matches the Java code\u2019s System.out.print.\n\n \n\nCase3: n=2, m=5.\n\n then m> n \u2192 output m=5 and 5+2-1=6 \u2192 the write\u2019s format outputs 5 6. No new line \u2192 matches.\n\n \n\nThus this code should be correct.\n\nTherefore this is the translated code."
