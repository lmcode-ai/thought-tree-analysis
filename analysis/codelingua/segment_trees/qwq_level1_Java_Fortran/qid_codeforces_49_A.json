Then ch remains as ' ' which is printed as 'NO', but since empty input, the Java code would have length 0. The loop would start at -1 (since length is zero, length-1 = -1) and loops to zero (since i >=0). Wait in that case, the for loop is for (i: -1 downto 0). Which in Java, that loop's condition is i >=0, so i starts at -1, so loop doesn't execute, so 'ch' remains 0. So the code returns 'NO'. But empty input may not be a valid case.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first. The problem is checking if the last non-space and non-question mark character in a string is a vowel (including 'y'). \n\nFirst, the Java code reads a line from input using Scanner. Then, it iterates backward through the string to find the first character that's not a space or '?'. Once found, it converts it to lowercase and checks if it's a vowel. Outputs YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, Fortran isn't as straightforward with strings as Java. Let me recall Fortran's string handling. Strings can be handled with character arrays or character variables. The input might come from a read statement.\n\nHmm, the main steps are: read the input line, loop backwards through the characters, find the first valid character, check if it's a vowel. Also need to ignore spaces and '?'.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings can be read with a read(*,*) statement, but that might stop at whitespace. So perhaps using a formatted input to get the entire line? Maybe using a list-directed input won't work if there are spaces. Alternatively, since we need the entire line, including spaces, perhaps using a character array with a sufficient size and reading using an internal or external method. \n\nWait, perhaps using a character variable of sufficient length. Let me see: in Fortran, if we read a line with read(*,'(A)') s, that should read until the end of the line, including spaces. So that's good.\n\nThe length of the string can be found using the LEN_TRIM function. Because the variable may be declared with a fixed size (like *), but LEN_TRIM gives the actual length excluding trailing spaces. However, when we process the string, we need to loop from the end towards the start. But perhaps checking each character.\n\nWait, the Java code uses s.length() which is the actual length of the string. In Fortran, the LEN function gives the total allocated length of the character variable, which includes trailing spaces if any. However, LEN_TRIM would exclude trailing blanks. But in the problem, the string might end with spaces or questions, so maybe it's better to process the entire declared length? Or maybe not?\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to read the line into a character array of, say, maximum possible length (like 100) and then find the effective length.\n\nAlternatively, let's think step by step:\n\n1. Read the input line into a variable. Let's use a character array with a fixed size. Let's say 100 characters. Then read the line into it using an appropriate format. Wait, but in Fortran, if using list-directed input, it might not capture leading or trailing spaces properly. So maybe using read(*,'(A)') to capture the entire line. Let's define s as a character array of, say, 100:\n\nCharacter(len=100) :: s\n\nRead(*,'(A)') s\n\nThen, the actual length is len_trim(s). Wait no. Actually, the length including all characters read (including leading/trailing spaces) would be up to the declared length. So perhaps better to process each character starting from the end.\n\nThe loop in Java starts from length-1 downto 0. In Fortran, the indices start at 1. So the string's characters are from 1 to len_trim(s), but possibly with trailing spaces if the input was shorter. To loop backward, starting from the end (i.e., from the last character to first):\n\nWait, the length of the input string (i.e., number of characters entered) may not be the same as LEN_TRIM(s). For example, if the input ends with a space, LEN_TRIM would exclude that space, but in the code, the space is considered. Wait, actually the original Java code considers all characters in the input string, including leading and trailing spaces. Because nextLine() gets the entire line. So in the Java code, s.length() includes all characters except the newline. So in Fortran, we need to process the entire string as read into the variable (except the trailing spaces beyond what was actually entered? Hmm, perhaps using LEN_TRIM is not correct here. \n\nWait, if the string was read with read(*,'(A100)') s, then s will have the first 100 characters of the input line, and the rest filled with spaces. So the actual input's length may be less than 100, so we need to process up to the first line, but perhaps the user can have up to a certain length?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to read the input using the get command to capture the entire line up to, say, 100 characters. Let me think that in the Fortran code, I can use a sufficiently large character variable. Let's set the length to 1000, which is a big enough buffer.\n\nNow, the loop in Java starts from length-1 down to 0 (since Java uses 0-based indices). So in Fortran, the first character is at 1, last character (index length) is s(length), then index goes from length down to 1.\n\nWait, so in Fortran, the string length is len_trim(s) but perhaps in the problem's code, it's the actual content including any trailing spaces entered by the user. But perhaps in Fortran, if you read using '(A)', the trailing spaces (after the last non-space character) may or may not be included. Hmm, maybe better to read into a character variable of sufficient length and check each character from the end backward, until we find a character that's not a space or '?'. \n\nLet me proceed:\n\nThe plan is:\n\nDeclare a character string of, say, 1000 characters.\n\nRead the input line into it using '(A)'\n\nThen find the last non-space and non-? character, in reverse order.\n\nStart from the last character (starting at index length = len_trim(s)). But wait, perhaps len_trim gives the length excluding trailing blanks. Wait, let's see, if the input was \"abc  ?\", then the string would have len_trim(s) would be the position of the '?' if it's the last non-blank. Hmm, perhaps actually the 'len_trim(s)' will exclude trailing spaces, but if the last non-space is a '?', then it is counted. So to get all characters up to the first newline, perhaps it's better to step through all characters from the end, even if trailing spaces are there. Wait, perhaps the input has a space or '?' at the end which we need to process.\n\nAlternatively, in Java, nextLine() returns everything up to (but excluding) the newline, including any leading or trailing spaces. Therefore in Fortran, the entire string including leading and trailing spaces is the one we want to process, so using len_trim would not be the right approach. So, in Fortran, since the variable s is allocated with 1000 characters, but maybe the actual input line is shorter. The starting index in Fortran would be 1 to the length of the read string (including possible trailing spaces beyond the actual characters). Wait, no\u2014if we read using read(*,'(a1000)') s, then the variable s is filled with the input up to 1000 characters, with trailing spaces for the rest. So the input line's actual content (including trailing spaces) is up to the newline, but in Fortran, the rest (positions beyond that) are spaces. Therefore, when looking for the last non-space and non-?, need to process up to the actual length? Or maybe better loop from the end towards the beginning.\n\nLet me see: in Java code:\n\nint length = s.length();\n\nthen loop from i = length-1 downto 0 (0-based). The equivalent in Fortran is looping i from len downto 1 (for 1-based indexing). Wait, in Fortran, the length is the declared length of the character variable. But the actual string may have trailing spaces. But according to the problem, the input string's actual length (as in Java) would be whatever the user input, including any spaces. So the Fortran code needs to process all characters from the first to the declared max, but effectively until the actual input ends, but this might get tricky. To be safe, perhaps in the Fortran code, we can loop from the end of the allocated array (the maximum len) backward until we hit a non-space and non-?.\n\nWait, but that would process the trailing spaces added by Fortran's read (the ones beyond the actual input). So for example, if the user enters a string of length 5, and the Fortran variable has a length of 1000, then the remaining 995 characters are spaces. Therefore, the loop would check all those spaces first before reaching the actual string's end. That's not desired.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps it's better to first compute the actual length of the input line, using LEN_TRIM(s) \u2014 but wait, LEN_TRIM(s) gives the length to the last non-space character. So if the input's last non-space character is not a space, then that's correct. However, if the input ends with a question mark and then some spaces, then LEN_TRIM would give the index of the last non-space, which is the '?'. So for the purpose of finding the last non-space and non-?, perhaps even if it's a space after the ?, that would be fine? Wait, in the code we have to loop from the end of the string (the actual end, as per input) backwards, skipping spaces and question marks until we find a character that is neither.\n\nWait, the problem is that in Fortran, when we read into s using, say, read(*,'(a1000)'), then s will have the input up to the newline, but padded with spaces up to 1000. The 'read' is reading the entire line as per '(A)' format, so the new line character is not part of the string.\n\nTherefore, in order to loop through the actual input's characters (the user's input), we need to loop from the last character of the actual input, but how do we find the exact end?\n\nWait, LEN_TRIM(s) will give the index of the last non-blank character (i.e., excluding trailing blanks). But \"non-blank\" in Fortran is any character with a non-space code. So if the last character of the actual input was a question mark followed by spaces, then the LEN_TRIM would point to the '?', so the length we need is LEN_TRIM(s). So the actual string's content up to LEN_TRIM(s). Thus, to loop from the end (LEN_TRIM(s)) backwards.\n\nAh, that's better. Because the actual content of the string, excluding trailing spaces, is up to LEN_TRIM(s). Therefore, the starting point for the loop should be LEN_TRIM(s), going down to 1.\n\nTherefore, here's the plan:\n\n- Declare s as a character array, say, len=1000.\n\n- Read the line into s with read(*,'(A)') s (assuming this reads the entire line into s).\n\n- Compute length = LEN_TRIM(s). Alternatively, use LENS = LEN(s) but that's the total length allocated.\n\nWait, no, LEN(s) is the declared length (1000). LEN_TRIM(s) is the length excluding trailing spaces. So the variable s has characters 1 up to LEN_TRIM(s), and from there trailing spaces until 1000.\n\nThus, the loop must start at i = length (equal to LEN_TRIM(s)), then decrement until 0 (but since Fortran is 1-based, downto 1).\n\nWait, the loop in Java starts at length-1 (since starting from 0) but the last character is at length-1. Hmm. Let's recast this. Let me get the variables straight.\n\nJava:\n\nlength = s.length();\n\nLoop i from length-1 downto 0 (inclusive):\n\n   if s.charAt(i) != ' ' and != '?'\n\n      ch = s.charAt(i); break;\n\nFortran:\n\nstring_length = len_trim(s)\n\nloop i from string_length downto 1:\n\n   c = s(i:i)\n\n   if (c ne ' ' .AND. c ne '?') then\n\n      ch = c\n\n      exitloop\n\n   end if\n\nWait, that's the logic. So yes, the loop over i from string_length down to 1.\n\nOnce we have the 'found character', then convert it to lowercase. In Fortran, the intrinsic function to lowercase would be with 'achar' and 'ichar', or use lowercase function like adjustment. Wait, Fortran has a function called 'adjustl', but that's for left-justifying. Hmm, the intrinsic function to change to lowercase can be done via converting uppercase letters using the following:\n\nIn Fortran 90 and on, there is the function 'lowercase' in some implementations, but maybe it's better to use ichar and achar.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\ncharacter(1) :: c\ninteger :: ich\n\nc = 'A' \nich = ichar(c)\nif (ich >= ichar('A') .and. ich <= ichar('Z') ) then\n   c = char(ich + 32)\nendif\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a built-in function. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the 'achar' function converts an integer to a character. There is the 'char' function for characters. However, for case conversion, there isn't a built-in function provided by the standard. So we need to implement it.\n\nThus, to convert the character to lowercase, need to check if it's uppercase, then add 32 to its ASCII value.\n\nWait, so for Fortran:\n\nIf the character is lowercase or uppercase, check:\n\nTo make it lowercase, if it's uppercase (A-Z), then add 32 to its ASCII code. So:\n\n   integer :: ich = ichar( ch )\n   if (ich >= 65 .and. ich <= 90) then\n       ch = char(ich + 32)\n   end if\n\nBut in code, for generality:\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nAfter finding the first non-space and non-'?', the character is stored in 'c', which is stored in a variable. For example:\n\ncharacter(1) :: ch = ' '\n\nThen:\n\ndo i = sLength,1,-1 \n\n   if (s(i:i) .ne. ' ' .and. s(i:i) .ne. '?') then \n\n       ch = s(i:i)\n\n       exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do \n\nNow, convert that ch to lower case:\n\ninteger :: code \n\ncode = ichar(ch)\n\nif (code >= ichar('A') .and. code <= ichar('Z')) then \n\n   ch = achar(code + 32)\n\nend if \n\nAlternatively, as a one-liner, but perhaps this is clearer.\n\nOnce that's done, check if the lowercase 'ch' is one of aeiouy:\n\nif(ch == 'a' .OR. ch == 'e' .OR. ch == 'i' .OR. ch == 'o' .OR. ch == 'u' .OR. ch == 'y' ) then \n\n   print *, 'YES'\n\nelse \n\n   print *, 'NO'\n\nend if \n\nSo putting all together:\n\nNow let's write the Fortran code step by step.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_49_A \n\n   implicit none \n\n   character(len=1005) :: s \n\n   integer :: i, sLength \n\n   character(1) :: ch \n\n   sLength = 0 \n\n   read(*,'(A)') s \n\n   sLength = len_trim(s) \n\n   ! Initialize ch to something, or assume it's not set?\n\n   ch = ' ' \n\n   do i = sLength, 1, -1 \n\n      if( s(i:i) .ne. ' ' .and. s(i:i) .ne. '?' ) then \n\n         ch = s(i:i) \n\n         exit \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   ! Now convert ch to lowercase \n\n   if (ichar(ch) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(ch) <= ichar('Z') ) then \n\n      ch = achar(ichar(ch)+32) \n\n   end if \n\n   ! check whether it's a vowel \n\n   if ( ch == 'a' .or. ch == 'e' .or. ch == 'i' .or. ch == 'o' .or. ch == 'u' .or. ch == 'y' ) then \n\n      print *, 'YES' \n\n   else \n\n      print *, 'NO' \n\n   end if \n\nend program codeforces_49_A \n\nWait, but need to check what happens if the entire string is all spaces and '?' characters. Then, the ch would remain ' ', but we need to handle that.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop starts from the end and breaks when finding a character other than ' ' and '?', so if there's no such character, then 'ch' is assigned to 0 (Java's code's initial value). Then, the check is done on that (which may be 0 or invalid).\n\nWait, in Java's code, the code initializes char ch =0; which might not be the same as uninitialized. But at least in the Java code, there's no error handling. So if all characters are ' ' and '?', then the loop doesn't execute (since the condition would never be met. Wait:\n\nWait, in the Java loop:\n\nfor (int i = length -1; i >=0; i--)\n\n   if ( s.charAt(i) is not a space or ?)\n\n      set ch and break;\n\nThus, if there are no valid characters (i.e., the entire string is space and '?'), then 'ch' remains 0, which in Java would be ASCII 0. Then, when converting to lower, perhaps that remains?\n\nThen, in that case, the code would compare the char to the vowels, which won't be, leading to 'NO'.\n\nIn our Fortran code, initially set ch to ' ', but if all characters are ' ' or '?', then the loop doesn't find anything, and the 'ch' remains ' ' (a space). Then we check if space is a vowel? No. Also, in the case of all '?', then ch would remain ' ', which also gives NO, which is correct?\n\nWait, but in that scenario, in Java the code sets ch = 0, which is ASCII 0 (NUL), then lowercases it, then compares. Since the NUL isn't a vowel, so outputs NO, which is correct. The Fortran code would set ch to ' ' (space) if no valid characters found. But the code checks for vowels, which would NOT include the space, so still NO.\n\nSo that's equivalent.\n\nAnother point: in Java, the initial ch is set to 0 (which might not be a printable char, but in the code logic, it's allowed to proceed).\n\nSo our Fortran code is correct here.\n\nTest Case:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: \"abroad ?\"\n\nThe last character is '?', so we move back until 'd', which is a consonant. The code outputs NO? Wait 'd is consonant? Wait the vowels are aeiouy. 'y' is considered a vowel here. Wait, but 'd' is consonant. So 'abroad' ends with 'd', which is consonant. So in this case code would output NO.\n\nWait let me see.\n\nWait, 'abroad' ends with 'd', so the code returns 'NO', but wait perhaps the code is wrong. Wait the sample isn't the best.\n\nAnother example: input is \"yellow\"\n\nLast character 'w', but 'y' is a vowel, but 'w' is not. Wait, no, let's think:\n\n\"yellow\" ends with 'w'? The word 'yellow' is spelled y-e-l-l-o-w. So last character is 'w', which is not a vowel. But the vowels include 'y', but the last character is w. So the code returns 'NO'.\n\nWait another example, where last character is 'y': input \"happy\" ends with 'y', which is vowel => YES.\n\nAnother example: \"y\" \u2192 YES.\n\nEdge Case 1: empty string (input was just a newline). Then, the LEN_TRIM(s) will be zero, so loop from 0 down\u2026 but that would have issues. But the program, in that case, the loop variable would be from sLength =0 to 1, which is entirely skipped (since start > end). Then ch remains as ' ' which is printed as 'NO', but since empty input, the Java code would have length 0. The loop would start at -1 (since length is zero, length-1 = -1) and loops to zero (since i >=0). Wait in that case, the for loop is for (i: -1 downto 0). Which in Java, that loop's condition is i >=0, so i starts at -1, so loop doesn't execute, so 'ch' remains 0. So the code returns 'NO'. But empty input may not be a valid case. However in the Fortran code, when sLength is zero, the do loop runs from sLength =0 downto 1. Since in Fortran, a do loop with initial value higher than final value (0 downto 1) doesn't execute. So the 'ch' is kept at ' ', then check, which hits ' ' \u2192 also 'NO'.\n\nWhich matches the Java code.\n\nAnother edge case: input is all spaces and question marks. The loop doesn't find any other character and the code outputs 'NO'.\n\nThus, the code should be okay.\n\nPotential problem in the Fortran: initializing ch as ' ' may not be necessary if the loop sets it, but in the case where there are no characters, then it remains ' '.\n\nWait the code initializes ch to ' ' before the loop. So after the loop, if the loop doesn't find anything, the ch is remain ' ', which is a space. Then the code proceeds to lowercase it (but it's already lowercase ' ', lowercase does nothing). Then, check ' ' against the vowels which are aeiouy. Not, so no. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nOther points:\n\nThe read statement: do we need to set sLength before the do?\n\nWait, in the current code:\n\nsLength = len_trim(s), which is after reading s.\n\nYes that's correct.\n\nAnother thing: the Fortran variable 'ch' is declared as character*(1). Yes.\n\nWait in code:\n\ncharacter(1) :: ch = ' '\n\nimplicit none is present, so variables must be declared.\n\nPutting it all together, the code looks okay.\n\nThus, this should be the correct Fortran translation.\n\nNow, let me code this properly, in the required format.\n\nWait the user may have a mistake in variable naming. Like capitalization? Like the program name? The Java classname is 'codeforces_49_A', perhaps the Fortran program should be codeforces_49_A as the program name.\n\nWait Fortran is case-insensitive, but the names are case-insensitive. So for clarity, same as java.\n\nThus:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_49_A\n\nIMPLICIT NONE\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=1000) :: s\n\nCHARACTER(LEN=1) :: ch\n\nINTEGER :: sLength, i\n\nsLength = 0\n\nREAD(*, '(A)') s\n\nsLength = LEN_TRIM(s)\n\nch = ' '\n\nDO i = sLength, 1, -1\n\n   IF( s(i:i) .NE.

In Fortran, using '(A)' will read the entire line into the character variable, including leading and trailing spaces. So yes.\n\nAnother note: the character length of s is set to 1000. That's arbitrary but big enough for codeforces problems (usually 1e5 but perhaps in this problem the input is small).\n\nAlternatively, can use a parameter like 1005 or so. But the code above uses 1000.\n\nNow, verify in code:\n\nYes. Thus, this should work."
