Wait the original code in Java:\n\nint n is read, and array arr has size n. The first element is arr[0]. So when fun is called, the parameters are arr of length n and n. So in the fun function's code, the loop is while i <= j, with j starting at n, and the midpoint is md = i + (j -i)/2. So when i=0 and j =n (size n), then md could be n, but the array has maximum index n-1. So arr[md] when md is n would be out of bounds. Hmm, this is a problem. But maybe the code is correct for some reason.",

Thus the array in Fortran is declared as:\n\narr(0 :n-1). then in the function fun:\n\nthe array is passed as (0:n-1). The variables i,j are set as in Java:\n\n i=0 \n\n j =n \n\n thus j is n, which is beyond the array's length (n-1). Thus in the function's loop, if md reaches n (array is 0 to n-1) then arr(n) -> index out of bounds. thus the same error. So this approach doesn't resolve the problem, but perhaps the code is intended to use the prefix sum array including the zero, so that the array has n+1 elements:\n\nsuch as:\n\n the array in Java is length n+1, with the first element arr[0] is zero. then the first input placed to arr[1], then others:\n\nthis would fix the g index.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Fortran, but I think I can figure it out. Let me go through the Java code first.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n, then an array of n integers. The first element is just the first input, and each subsequent element is the sum of that input and the previous element. Then it reads m queries, each of which is a number q, and for each, it calls the fun function and prints the result plus 1.\n\nThe fun function seems to be performing a binary search on the prefix sum array. The parameters are the array arr, the query q, n and m (though m isn't used here). The function returns the index where the cumulative sum first exceeds q. Or maybe it returns the position where inserting q would maintain the order? Let me look at the code again.\n\nWait, in the binary search, they set 'res' to md when arr[md] > q, but also track it. When arr[md] is larger than q, they update res and move left. If it's smaller, move right. So this is like finding the first element greater than q, and returning that index. So the result is the index where the sum exceeds q, so adding 1 gives the count of numbers? Like the problem might be from codeforces where you have to find how many elements can be formed with a certain value, so adding 1 makes sense.\n\nAlright, translating this to Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but the Java code uses 0-based arrays. So need to adjust indices. Wait, Java here starts the array at 0 (since arr[0] is assigned first). The first element of arr is the first input, then each next element is previous plus input. So in Fortran, perhaps arrays from 1 to n, but the first element is the first number, and second is first plus the next, etc. So maybe using 1-based here. So when translating, need to adjust loops.\n\nStarting with the main program.\n\nThe Java code uses a Scanner for input. In Fortran, we can read using READ(*,*) statements. Since all input is from standard input, we'll use standard Fortran I/O.\n\nFirst part of the Java code:\n\nRead n. Then read arr[0], then loop from i=1 to n-1 (since in Java it's 0-based). Each next element is previous plus current input. So in Fortran:\n\nRead n. Then declare an array arr of size n, assuming Fortran uses 1-based then:\n\narr(1) = first input value. Then for i from 2 to n: arr(i) = arr(i-1) + next input. That seems right.\n\nWait, in the Java code, arr[0] is set first, and then for i from 1 to n-1. In java, the array has indices 0 to n-1, so the for loop runs i from 1 to i < n, which is up to n-1. The Fortran loop would be from 2 to n, because arr(2) would be arr(1) plus the next input. So that works.\n\nNext, read m. Then an array q of size m. Then read m integers into q. So in Fortran:\n\nRead m, then dimension q(m), then do a loop from 1 to m, reading each element.\n\nThen the main loop: for each k in 0..m-1 (Java's k from 0 to m-1), we call fun(arr, q(k), n, m), add 1, and print.\n\nWait, in Fortran arrays start at 1, so the q array in Fortran would be from 1 to m, and loops would be from 1 to m. So when doing \"for k from 0 to m-1 in Java\", in Fortran we have to loop k from 1 to m, but subtract 1 if needed, but the function parameters probably handle it. Wait, let me check the function.\n\nThe function fun in Java takes arr, q, n, m, but m is not used. So in Fortran, perhaps the function can just take arr, q, and n (since m in the function's parameters isn't needed). So the parameters can be modified, but even if they stay, Fortran will have m be passed as a variable but the function doesn't use it, which is okay.\n\nThe function fun. Let me look at the code:\n\nThe function is static in Java, which in Fortran would be a separate subroutine or function. Let's make a function in Fortran.\n\nThe function's logic:\n\nIt initializes res to 0, and i and j as 0 and n. Wait, in Java, i starts at 0, j at n (since arr has n elements, indexes 0 to n-1. So j is initialized to n, which would be beyond the array, but the loop uses arr[md], so md can go up to n. Wait, let me see:\n\nThe Java code uses i and j as 0 and n? Because the array is size n, indices 0-based, so the maximum index is n-1. So initializing j to n would have a problem. Is that a mistake in the original code?\n\nWait, in the Java code's fun function, arr is declared as length n. So for a 0-based array, the last element is n-1. But the variables i starts at 0, j starts at n (so when md is calculated, (i+j)/2 etc. But in the code's binary search:\n\nWait, that's an interesting point. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe variables i=0 and j = n (the maximum index is n-1). So the loop runs until i<=j. So j is set to n initially, but the array's elements go up to index n-1. So when j is set to n, arr[j] would be arr[n], which is beyond the array's index. That's an array out of bounds error. Wait, that can't be right. Wait that's a bug?\n\nWait the original code in Java:\n\nint n is read, and array arr has size n. The first element is arr[0]. So when fun is called, the parameters are arr of length n and n. So in the fun function's code, the loop is while i <= j, with j starting at n, and the midpoint is md = i + (j -i)/2. So when i=0 and j =n (size n), then md could be n, but the array has maximum index n-1. So arr[md] when md is n would be out of bounds.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. But maybe the code is correct for some reason. Because, perhaps the array is structured such that the maximum possible value is arr[n-1]. So when j is set to n, the code would check md up to n? Maybe the initial conditions have i=0, j =n. But maybe the code is actually handling it so that the first element is 0?\n\nWait, looking back at the calculation of the array:\n\nThe first element is arr[0] = input. The rest are cumulative sums. So arr[0] is the first element, arr[1] = arr[0] + next input, etc. So the sum is up to the nth element (index n-1 in Java). So the total array is [a1, a1+a2, a1+a2+a3, ...].\n\nSo in the fun function, are they searching through the entire array (indices 0 to n-1) but the initial upper bound is set to n (the array's length) which would be an invalid index? So that code is flawed, but maybe it's because it actually starts with arr[-1] as 0? Wait no, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem's code uses arr of size n, with 0-based indexing, and considers the prefix sums starting from the first element. So the index 0 is the first element, and maybe the upper limit in the binary search should be n-1. Because initializing j as n (the length) would cause an issue.\n\nWait in the binary search code:\n\nIn the method fun, the loop is while (i <= j). The starting values are i=0 and j =n. Wait, maybe the original problem's code is incorrect? Because arr[n] does not exist. That's a problem. So perhaps there is an error in the original Java code?\n\nHmm, but perhaps the binary search handles this, because the code proceeds until it narrows down the search. Let me think through:\n\nSuppose n =5 (so indexes 0 to4). So j=5 initially, but the maximum element is 4. So when the first midpoint is (0+5)/2=2, but then?\n\nWait maybe not. Alternatively perhaps the array is meant to be of size n, but the indexes are 0-based, and the binary search is looking for a value greater than q. So the code could be using n as the initial j, but in the code, the array has arr[0] to arr[n-1], so arr[j] where j =n would be indexing beyond array's length. That would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java. So this must be a mistake in the original code. \n\nWait, perhaps the original code's fun function was actually supposed to start the binary search on a different array. Wait the code may have an error. But given that we have to translate it, we need to handle it as given, but perhaps in Fortran, using arrays with 1-based indices, the equivalent code might have different indices. Maybe we should adjust the Java code's indices to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the Java code, the 'n' passed to the function is the length of the array. So in the fun function, the array has size n elements, indices 0 to n-1. So the initial j should be n-1. But the original code in Java initializes j as n, which is wrong. Wait, that's a problem. Because in the Java function, arr has length n, so arr.length is n, but j was set to n in code, leading to a possible out of bounds error. So that must be a bug in the Java code. \n\nWait, but perhaps the code is correct because when they do mid in the first step, when the initial i and j are 0 and n. even if j is n, but the loop ends when i exceeds j? Hmm the loop condition is while (i <=j). So if j is initialized to n and the max array index is n-1, then when j starts at n, the code will compute md as i + (j-i)/2, but if that md is n, then accessing arr[md] would give an error. So the code is wrong. So maybe in the function, the upper bound should be n-1? Let's look again at the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial code was intended for a 1-based array? Or perhaps the function is correct despite that? Because maybe, the first few steps don't reach the j higher than n?\n\nAlternatively maybe the code is correct because in Java, when the loop is over, the logic works out, even if technically the array is accessed out of bounds. But this would be a bug, so perhaps the original Java code is wrong here. Since we need to translate exactly the code, even if it's buggy, but perhaps in the problem context, n is the size, and the binary search is supposed to consider indices up to n-1. So maybe the code's j should be initialized to n-1. But the code has j =n initially. Hmm.\n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps when translating to Fortran, I have to note that. Alternatively, maybe the code is meant to use the prefix sums starting with 0 and the array length is n+1? Let's see the code.\n\nWait in the Java code, the array is built as follows:\n\n(arr[0] is first input). Then for each i from 1 to n-1 (since i starts at 1 and goes up to n). So arr[1] = next input + arr[0], and etc. So the array length is n, and each element is a prefix sum. So arr[i] is the sum of the first (i+1) elements?\n\nWait the first element is the first term, then the second is first + second term, etc. So the array elements correspond to prefix sums starting from 1 element. So the sum up to the k-th element is stored in arr[k-1] (Java's 0-based). So arr's elements are the cumulative sums of the input sequence, starting with the first number and each subsequent step adding the next input. The array has size n elements, so for the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, the prefix sums are S1 = a1, S2 = a1+a2, ..., Sn = total.\n\nSo in the array arr, the elements are S1, S2, ... Sn. \n\nThe function fun is looking for the smallest index (in the array) where the sum is greater than or equal to q? No, let me see the logic again:\n\nIn the fun function:\n\nThey are doing a binary search where they want to find the first element >= q and return the index, or maybe the first element exceeding it?\n\nThe code in fun does:\n\nInitialize res =0, i starts at 0 (the first element index), j = n (which for n elements is beyond the array. So perhaps in the code, j should be n-1. The initial indices are wrong. However, assuming that in the code, despite the problem, the code works because when it checks the midpoints, it somehow stays within the array. Alternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the j initialization? Let's walk through an example.\n\nSuppose n =3, so array elements are indices 0,1,2 (3 elements). So initial i=0 and j =3 (which is beyond the array). The first md is (0+3)/2? Wait md = 0 + (3-0)/2= 1.5, but in integer division, (3)//2 is 1.5 rounded down? Because in Java, integer division truncates, so (j-i) divided by 2. So 3 /2 is 1. So md would be 0+3-0 is 3-0? Wait i is 0 and j is 3, so (j-i)/2 is (3)/2=1, so md is 0 +1=1. So accessing index1, which is okay. Then, for subsequent steps:\n\nSuppose during the search, even if j jumps to higher numbers that are beyond the array's length, it may crash. So I think this code has a bug. But maybe in the original code, the j was supposed to be started as the array length minus one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function was intended to have the arr from size n+1, so the array has 0-based indexes up to n. But the code in the main function only allocated n elements, so the array is size n, so indexes 0..n-1. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Well, perhaps the code has an off-by-one error, but since our task is to translate the code AS-IS to Fortran, even if there's a bug, we have to mirror that.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, so when translating, perhaps the variables must be adjusted for 1-based indices. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the main program. Since we don't have classes in Fortran, the main is just the program.\n\nDeclarations:\n\nn is integer. The array arr of length n. In Fortran, arrays need to be declared with dimension. Since Fortran can have dynamic arrays, perhaps using implicit none and declaring variables.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran 90 or later, we can use allocatable arrays.\n\nAlternatively, it's better to make the code as close as possible to the original structure, so perhaps using parameterized arrays or read the input first and then dimension the array. But because the array size is determined by the first input, we need to read n first, then dimension the array.\n\nIn Fortran, you can read n first, then declare an array arr(1:n).\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the first number as arr(1).\n\nThen a loop from 2 to n:\n\narr(i) = arr(i-1) + sc.nextInt();\n\nWait but in Fortran, we can read from the standard input in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, after reading the first element (arr(1)), then for the remaining elements:\n\nRead the numbers into a temporary or just compute the sum.\n\nWait, here's how it can be structured:\n\nRead first value as arr(1).\n\nThen for each i from 2 to n:\n\nRead next value into a variable x, then arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, m is next, then read m elements into q array.\n\nThen loop through each q and compute fun, etc.\n\nBut for the fun subroutine.\n\nBut first, let me sketch the main program.\n\nSomething like:\n\nProgram codeforces_474_B\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, q\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(1:n))\nread(*,*) arr(1)\n\ndo i =2, n\n   read(*,*) arr(i)\n   arr(i) = arr(i) + arr(i-1)\nend do\n\nWait, no: the first step is arr(1) = input. Then, for each next i, x is the next input, so arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x. So the code above is incorrect.\n\nAh right, the next input for i=2 is x= next input. So:\n\nWait in Java:\n\nfor (int i =1; i <n; i++ )\n\nWait the loop is from i=1 to i <n, i runs from 1 to n-1 (like 0-based in Java's array, starting at 1? Wait the Java loop starts at i=1 (since initial step was 0) and goes up to i <n (so i runs 1..n-1):\n\nIn Fortran, for i from 2 to n:\n\nYes. So the loop part:\n\nIn Java, for the first iteration, i=1 (since the loop starts at 1). But in Java, the loop runs from i=1 to i <n (so until i reaches n-1?), then for each i, the input x is added to arr[i-1]?\n\nYes. So in the Java code's for loop:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <n; i++) {\n\nx = sc.nextInt();\n\narr[i] =x + arr[i-1];\n\nWait, so the first iteration (i=1 in 0-based), adds the new x (input) to the previous arr[0], so arr[1] becomes arr[0]+x. So in Fortran, the first element is the first input. For i from 2 to n (since in Fortran the arrays are 1-based):\n\nWait index in Java's i starts at 1 (so for i=1, the corresponding Fortran is index 2?) because:\n\n- Java's i is 1 (0-based) corresponds to the second element in Fortran. So for each i from 1 to n-1 in Java (since i <n), we have to loop through i=1 (Java) which is element [1] in Java (which is Fortran's arr(2)?\n\nYes, so in Fortran, the loop is from i = 2 to n:\n\nRead x, then set arr(i) =x + arr(i-1). But instead of reading x first, we can read all the elements first. Wait, but in the original code, the x is read in the loop step, so in Fortran, need to read each input value in each iteration of the loop except for the first.\n\nWait for the loop:\n\nJava:\n\nint x = sc.nextInt(); \n\narr[i] = x + arr[i-1]\n\nIn Fortran, inside the loop from i=2 to n:\n\nYou have to read a x each time. So code:\n\nprogram codeforces_474_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i\ninteger, dimension (1:0), allocatable :: arr, q \n\n! Read n\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(arr(1:n))\n\nread(*,*) arr(1)\n\ndo i = 2, n\n    integer ::x\n    read(*,*) x  ! read next element\n    arr(i) = arr(i-1) + x\nend do\n\nThen read m and the q array.\n\nread(*,*), m\n\nallocate(q(1:m))\n\ndo i =1, m\n\nread(*,*) q(i)\n\nend do\n\nThen loop over each element in q and compute fun(...)\n\nBut in Fortran, functions and subroutines have to be defined before use, or at the beginning.\n\nSo the Fun function (actually a function in Fortran) has to be declared.\n\nThe function fun(arr, q, n, m) in Java.\n\nLet me think about the function's parameters in Fortran.\n\nThe function would take the array arr, the value q, the array length n. The m parameter is passed but not used, so just include it.\n\nIn Fortran, function arguments are passed by reference or value depending on the usage, and integers are passed as values unless specified.\n\nSo the function in Fortran:\n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m) \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: arr(:) \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: q \n\ninteger, intent (in) :: n, m \n\ninteger :: i, j, md, res \n\n res =0 \n\n i =0  ! Wait, in Java, the initial i is 0. But the array in Fortran is from 1 to n. \n\nThis is where the confusion comes. Because in the Java function's variables, the initial i=0 and j=n. \n\nSo in Java, the array is 0-based, indexes from 0 to n-1. The search is looking between 0 (i=0) and j started at n (but in Java that's beyond the array size. However, in Java code that would be an error. \n\nIn Fortran's function, the array is 1-based. The equivalent of Java's indices would be shifted by 1. So if the original Java has i=0 and j =n (for their 0-based array which has indexes 0 to n-1), then in Fortran's 1-based array, those would translate to 1-based indices. \n\nWait, in Fortran, the indices are from 1 to n. So the equivalent of Java's i=0 and j =n (for n elements) would correspond to 1-based indices from 1 to ? Wait no. Let's think:\n\nIn Java's binary search variables were:\n\ni =0 (arrays first element in Java's terms is 0, so this corresponds to Fortran's 1?)\n\nWait, Java's lower (i) corresponds to the first index (0) but in Fortran it's 1. Original code's logic is that the lower bound is 0 (Java index) and upper is n (which is beyond the array's length. So in Fortran, to adjust the equivalent indices:\n\nWe need to see what the function is trying to do.\n\nThe fun function is trying to find the earliest point where arr[md] > q. The loop is essentially a binary search to find the first element greater than or equal to q, perhaps. \n\nWait, the original code is:\n\nif arr[md] == q, return md immediately.\n\nElse if (arr[md] > q), that's a candidate, so set res to md, and search left (lower j), perhaps to a smaller element.\n\nElse (arr[md] < q), then you have to move to the right, increase i.\n\nThe 'res' is accumulating the smallest id where arr[i] exceeds q. \n\nThe function returns res. So the result is res, which is the smallest index where the element exceeds q, and the function returns that. Adding 1 when printed (in the main loop) gives the number of elements?\n\nWait perhaps the original problem requires that if q is exactly found, then the index is md, which is +1 gives the correct position. \n\nBut the issue in the array indices must be handled correctly for Fortran. \n\nNow back to code.\n\nIn Fortran, the function's parameters are passed. Let me try to write the function:\n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m) \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: arr(1:n) ! Assuming the array passed is 1 to n.\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: q \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: n, m \n\ninteger :: i, j, md, res \n\n res =0 \n\ni=0; j=n \n\nWait in the original code, the initial i is 0 and j is n. \n\nBut in Fortran, the array is 1-based, so the indices here: \n\nthe first element is 1. So in Java's terms, i=0 is beyond the start of the array (Fortran's 1), so perhaps this is an issue. \n\nWait in Java, initially their array is 0-based with indices up to n-1, so the search range is between 0 and n (which is outside the array). But maybe the code is correct in the logic despite the array access is invalid? Probably not, but perhaps in the context of the problem the worst case.\n\nAlternatively perhaps the original Java code's j is set to n-1, but they coded n. \n\nAssuming that we must translate literally, then in Fortran, the i and j are:\n\ni =0 (start at 0, but the first element is 1) and j =n (array's last element is n, so md could be up to n. \n\nWait for example, if n=3 (array indices 1-3 in Fortran), then j = n would be 3, which is the last element's index. So in Fortran, j is set to n. So no problem here. So when the Java code has j initialized to n, that in their 0-based array is equivalent to the end of the array (n-1) +1? Hmm confusing. \n\nWait maybe it's better to think that the variables i and j are zero-based indices. But in Fortran, the array is 1-based. \n\nSo in the function:\n\nIn Java's fun, the variables i and j are in 0-based, starting at 0 and n (which is invalid), so when translated into 1-based indices, perhaps the equivalent in Fortran is:\n\ni starts at 0 \u2192 index -1? Which is not good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the indices in the code are treated as zero-based but the array is one-based. \n\nWait, perhaps in the function's code, I need to consider that the array is 1-based, but the variables i,j are adjusted to 1-based indices.\n\nWait let's think again:\n\nIn the function's binary search, the code wants to find the first index in the array (which is 0-based in Java) where the value exceeds q. The initial i and j variables are set to 0 (lower bound, first element) and n (upper bound which is beyond the array). But in Fortran, perhaps this would translate to i starting at 0 and j at n+1? No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code even in Java has the search variables as 0 and n-1. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the array is [5], n=1.\n\nThe function's i is 0, j starts at n (1), so the loop runs while i <=j (0 <=1 \u2192 yes).\n\nmd is (0+1)/2 \u2192 0.5 \u2192 rounded down to 0. \n\nSo md is 0, and since arr[0] is 5. Suppose q is 3. Then arr[0] (5) > 3. Set res=0 and j to md-1: -1? Then the loop would exit because i=0, j is -1 \u2192 0 <= -1 is false.\n\nThe result is 0, which is returned. So printing res+1 gives 1. Which is correct if the first element's sum is larger than q, so the number of elements is 1 (the first element would be the first one).\n\nWait the q was 3, and sum at position 0 is 5. The answer is 1, which is correct because the 1st element (arr[0]) already exceeds q. So yes, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait another example with n=3, arr has elements [3, 6, 10]. So the array is indices 0,1,2 (Java style). Suppose q=5.\n\nThe binary search:\n\ni=0, j=3 (initially). So first midpoint is (0+3)/2 =1.5 \u2192 1. arr[1] is 6 >5. So set res=1, and set j=0. \n\nWait first iteration:\n\nmd=1. So arr[1]=6>5 \u2192 yes. So res is set to 1 (the current md?), and j is set to 0. Now loop continues? i is 0, j=0, next iteration. So md again: i=0 and j=0: so md =0. \n\narr[0] is 3<5 \u2192 so then i = md+1 = 1. Now i is 1, j is 0 \u2192 exit loop. So res was last set to 1 (from first step). The function returns 1, so the output is 2. Which would mean 2 elements (since adding 1 \u2192 2). The sum of first 2 elements is 3+3=6>5, so yes, that's correct. So the result is 2, correct.\n\nWait but when md was 0 (second iteration) we set i to md+1=1. \n\nBut the j in the second iteration was 0, so the step of md =0 when i and j are 0 (the loop starts with i <=j \u2192 yes).\n\nSo calculation is okay. \n\nThe problem in Java is that in the first step j starts at n (3 when n is array of size 3), which is the index beyond the last element (index 2). But when md computed as (0+3)/2 =1 (for even numbers?), in the first example. So yes, the code works despite the j starting at n, because the indices step down. However when j is set to n in Java's code, and the array length is n, then in some cases when the required element is at the end, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut for the Fortran code, the function's variables should be set to the array's start and end, in 1-based terms.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nIn Fortran, the binary search variables i and j must be within the array's indices (1 to n):\n\nWait no. Wait in the Java code's fun function, variables i and j are 0-based indices. To translate to 1-based, like Fortran, we can:\n\nAdjust all indices by +1. So in Java's code, i starts at 0 \u2192 Fortran 1. j starts at n (Java's last index +1. )\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitially, i = 0 \u2192 original Java's first element. Wait this is not 1-based. Hmm.\n\nWait in Java's function, the array has indices 0 to n-1 (because Java's function receives arr array of size n). The n in the function is the length of the array.\n\nIn their binary search:\n\nThey set i =0 (start at first element ), j= n \u2192 which is the index n, but the array has only up to n-1. So md would be sometimes up to n, which is invalid, but perhaps it's never used because the algorithm terminates before.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is 0-based, the actual possible indices are 0\u2026n-1. So the j should be initialized to n-1, not n.\n\nAh, so perhaps the original code has a bug. The correct initialization in the function is j = n-1. Then, the binary search would work correctly. \n\nBut the original code has it as j=n. Hence, the code may have a bug that we must replicate when translating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input ensures that arr is always in a way where that bug isn't hit. Still, to stick to the provided code, even with the possible bug, we can proceed.\n\nSo the function in Fortran will have variables i and j initialized as:\n\ni=0 (Java's first index)\n\nj =n (since i and j are 0-based indices). But in Fortran, the array indices are 1-based. \n\nTo adjust, in the function's code, the indices need to be Fortran-1-based indices. \n\nWait, the array in Fortran is 1-based. The fun function needs to reference elements from 1 to n. The original variables i and j (zero-based in Java) correspond in terms of indices:\n\nJava's index 0 \u2192 Fortran's 1.\n\nJava's index 0-based k \u2192 Fortran's k+1.\n\nTherefore, the initial variable:\n\nJava's i starts at 0 \u2192 Fortran's variables will need to have 1? \n\nWait this is getting confusing. Maybe in the Fortran function's variables to directly mirror the Java variables:\n\nSince the array in Fortran is 1-based:\n\nThe first element is arr(1), which is Java's arr[0].\n\nThe second is arr(2) or Java's arr[1], etc.\n\nSo, in Fortran's function's variables, if the original code in Java uses arr[md], then in Fortran, if md is a Java 0-based index, the Fortran equivalent is md+1.\n\nTherefore, in the function, variables i,j are zero-based, but the array accesses would need to add 1 to the index? No, that's not convenient. \n\nAlternatively, we can adjust everything to 1-based indices as per Fortran's standard.\n\nSo, To make it clearer, perhaps in the Fortran function:\n\nThe search is between 0 (Java's first) and n (Java's j start). The values of i and j need to offset accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, to match the original code exactly, perhaps we can just proceed with the code\u2019s variables even though the indices in Fortran are 1-based.\n\nWait the problem is the function's loop could access arr(md), where md is a variable from 0 to n. So in Fortran, if the array is of length n, that would attempt to access arr(0) (which is invalid) and arr(n+1) (assuming md= n in Fortran's code).\n\nThus, we'll need to modify the function's variables so that the indices stay within the array's bounds. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to proceed by replacing the array's 0-based indices with 1-based in Fortran:\n\nIn Fortran's function:\n\nvariables i starts at 1, j starts at n (since array has 1 to n elements). \n\nThus:\n\nReplacing the Java code's variables:\n\nJava's initial i =0 (start) \u2192 becomes 1 in Fortran.\n\nJava's j = n \u2192 becomes n (since array's last index is n. So initial j is n, which is okay).\n\nThen, the loop proceeds:\n\nSo the variables are now 1-based. \n\nThen, the array access arr[md] (Java's 0-based) becomes arr( md_Java+1 ), but perhaps not. \n\nWait in the loop variables:\n\nThe Fortran will have:\n\ni = 1 (instead of 0)\n\nj = n \n\nSo the calculations would proceed similarly. \n\nBut the original code may have a bug, and in the Fortran code, the bounds may be proper since the array is 1-based. \n\nHmm, after considering all this, here's the plan:\n\nThe fun function in Fortran should be:\n\nINTEGER FUNCTION fun(arr, q, n, m)\n\n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: arr(1:n) \n   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: q, n, m\n   INTEGER :: i,j,md, res\n\n   res =0  ! this will initialize to zero, which in Java is 0-based (first array element is 1 in Fortran?)\n\n   i = 0 ! but in Fortran's array, this would be accessing arr(0) which is out of bounds. \n\nWait, this is a problem again. \n\nAlternatively, in FLT currentPlayer's mind. perhaps in Fortran, even if the first element is at position 1, maybe for the indices the variables i and j are zero-based, but the code uses the array with (i+1). So perhaps, for example:\n\nReplace all accesses to arr[(i)] with arr[i+1].\n\nBut maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, use 1-based in variables:\n\nReplace i with i_f where i_f = i_j+1. (where i_j is the Java's 0-based)\n\nWait maybe it's easier to just translate the code verbatim with 1-based arrays but adjust the variables' initializations. \n\nWait in the function's code in Java:\n\ni =0 \u2192 in Fortran, 1-based array, this corresponds to first element (arr(1)). So initializing i to 0 is possible?\n\nWait in Fortran, variables can be 0 (indices just have to be within array).\n\nWait Fortran variables can be 0, just the array indices start at 1.\n\nSo in the function:\n\ni can be initialized to 0 (since variables are integers not related to array indices). But when accessing arr(md):\n\n md can be 0 (fortran's array doesn't like that. \n\nSo to prevent array access issues, we need to map the original variables (0-based in Java) to Fortran variables (1-based) and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me try rewriting the function's variables to 1-based instead.\n\nThen, in Fortran fun's function:\n\nres=0 \u2192 but need to store as index -1 or something?\n\nAlternatively, Let's consider that in the fun function:\n\nJava's variables:\n\nindices start at 0 (start) and go to n (beyond array).\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent indices are 1 to n .\n\nThe variables in Java:\n\ni (starts 0) \u2192 new_java_i = original_i\n\nIn fortran:\n\ni_f = original_i (Java's indices)\n\nthe function's code's array in Java:\n\nenum ...\n\nThus, array access in Java: arr[md]\n\nIn Fortran's array which is indexed as 1-based, the equivalent is arr(md+1?). \n\nWait here's a detailed variable mapping:\n\nMake variables in Fortran as follows:\n\nThe array in Fortran is 1..n indices.\n\nMD in Fortran represents the java md (e.g. the 0-based java index).\n\nThus to access the element in Fortran array at the same position as Java's md, it's arr(md+1)?\n\nNo, because in Java, arr[0] is first element \u2192 Fortran's arr(1).\n\nSo for Java's arr[md], the Fortran equivalent is arr(md+1).\n\nThus:\n\nInside the function:\n\ni starts at 0 \u2192 equivalent to 1 (fortran's first element).\n\nj starts at n \u2192 Java's j is n \u2192 the corresponding Fortran's index for that Java md is n+1, but ptrn array is only up to n elements. Thus, j_F =n (Java's j was n \u2192 md could be up to n, but Fortran's array can't access beyond n so this is a problem. \n\nAh, thus, maybe the original function's code is incorrect and the j should be initialized to n-1 (Java's array's max index is n-1 so the Java's function's code would have j=n-1.\n\nBut since we must translate the code as-is, let's proceed with the code's variables in Fortran, even if the array access could be invalid, but trust that the logic ensures.\n\nSo steps:\n\nfun(arr, q, n, m):\n\nres initialized to 0 (zero-based)\n\ni and j in Fortran's function are initialized as:\n\ni =0 (Java's first element is at this i)\n\nj = n (Java's j starts at n, which in Fortran's array would point to arr(n+1) (if md was even).\n\nWait this is really problematic, but perhaps in the code, the calculation doesn't let it hit that.\n\nI think I need to proceed by replicating the same logic.\n\nNow let's write the Fortran function:\n\nAssume that the array in fun is passed properly, as 1-based. The variables i and j in the function are set as per Java (0-based indices) but accessed using arr( index +1 )?\n\nWait perhaps:\n\nIn Fortran, the functions are:\n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m)\n\n   integer :: arr(n)\n   integer :: q, m, n\n   integer :: i, j, md, res\n\n   res =0 \n\n   i =0  \n\n   j =n \n\n   do while (i .le. j)\n\n       md = i + (j -i)/2 \n\n       ! access array at md:\n\n       if ( arr(md+1) == q ) then \n\n           res = md \n\n           exit \n\n       else if ( arr(md+1) > q ) then\n\n          res = md \n\n          j = md -1 \n\n       else \n\n          i = md +1 \n\n       end if \n\n   end do \n\n   fun = res \n\nend function \n\nWait here, because in Fortran, the first element of arr is 1. So md (0-based from Java's code) is indexed as md+1 in Fortran's array. \n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose in Java, we have a md=0 (first element): then in Fortran's array, it is arr(1) which is correct.\n\n Java's md= n (last Java element (n-1 in 0-based \u2192 Java array has size n) would be md= n \u2192 Fortran's md+1 = n+1 \u2192 that is beyond array which is size n. Thus this is a bug.\n\nAh so this is a problem. \n\nHmm, thus the code is incorrect in its original Java version, and replicating it will cause an out-of-bound access in Fortran.\n\nTo make it run correctly, perhaps the function's Java code uses an array that starts at cumuluavtives[ 0 ] =0?\n\nWait the original Java code in the main part:\n\nThe first array element is arr[0]= first input. Then each next element is the previous plus next input. So perhaps the array is okay. \n\nBut back to the Fortran function's code: the j in the function's java is set to n. In Java's terms, that is a index that's beyond the array (n), but in Java, the array has size n (indices 0..n-1), so the array would throw an error. \n\nBut in the code in Java, maybe this doesn\u2019t occur because the loop variables don\u2019t reach that extreme? \n\nSo for the fortran code, we have to find a way to represent this.\n\nMaybe we can adjust the initial variables to start at 1 and array's last element+1 ?\n\nWait perhaps in Fortran the initial j is set to n (since the array has n elements, so java's n-1 is the last element's 0-based index. Thus, in the Fortran function, the equivalent j in Java's code is n, but the array size is n \u2192 Fortran's max index is n, thus md can be n, which would still be in bounds? \n\nWait for Instance:\n\nJava's array length is n, thus the maximum elements in array are 0 to n-1 (indices).\n\nThus in Java, the maximum md entered is n, which is beyond the array.\n\nBut in Fortran's version's md:\n\nIf the fortran code is using the original variables' i and j values but aligning to the fortran's array:\n\nThen when md is set to n (java's md that would exceed the array), the fortran's array uses that md have0Arr(md+1) ptrn array is indexed from 1 to n, so md+1 = n+1 \u2192 array out of bounds again.\n\nThus it's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's intention is that the j should start at n-1 (arrays end at n-1), so in the Fortran function:\n\nj =n-1 \n\n thus, when Java code is prone to an off-by-one error, but here, the equivalent code for Fortran is corrected.\n\nPossible, but the original code could have other rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem comes from codeforces, perhaps it's better to consider the original question's problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's code considers the array one-based. \n\nWait perhaps the initial Java array is built as follows, but actually contains one more element.\n\nAh perhaps the array in the original Java code is size n+1, where arr[0] =0 and arr[1] is first element, etc. \n\nWait in the main code:\n\nThe code reads n, then reads the first element into arr[0], then for each next i up to n-1:\n\nthe next element is added with previous. \n\nThus the arr contains the prefix sums from 1 element (arr[0] is first element), arr[1] is first+ second, up to n terms. So arr has n elements.\n\n Thus, for example, if n=1 then arr[0] = a1. \n\nBut then the function fun can search for q and return the index, but when the sum is exactly q, returns the same as the index.\n\n In codeforces problem 474B, the problem statement requires that for each query, output the number of first elements (from the array) whose sum is less than or equal to k (adjusted?) \n\nWait the problem B from codeforces474 is \"Vasya and Petya\": The problem says:\n\nEach needs to choose two numbers with certain constraints, and the one with larger sum is the winner. You have to find how many pairs Vasya has where he can win regardless of Petya's choice.\n\nThe problem requires the selection of pairs, but perhaps this code is a solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this code is for problem B of contest474. \n\n Looking up the problem: 474B in codeforces.\n\nProblem B: \"Vasya and Petya's Game\"\n\nThe task is, given two arrays and a number m queries.\n\nWait perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively the code is solution for codeforces problem 474B \"Vasya even numbers\", but the code above might be relevant for a solution where after computing the cumulative array, each query wants to find how many cows Masha could choose such that the total money paid is exactly queried value?\n\n Not sure. \n\nRegardless, the code is as given, and to translate, perhaps I have to proceed with the indexing. \n\nPerhaps the fortran code is better to use 1-based arrays with variables' indices adjusted. So:\n\nIn the function fun:\n\ni starts 1 (was 0 before)\n\nj is initialized to n (since the array is size n). In fortran the array is 1-based so indexes 1 to n. \n\nThen the loop:\n\nmd = (i +j ) /2 \n\nSo the code would access arr(md), which is correct. \n\nThe condition remains similar, so:\n\nWait here is the full function's Fortran version:\n\nFunction fun takes the array (1:n), q, n and m (unused).\n\nLet me try writing it:\n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m)\n\n   implicit None \n   integer, intent(in) :: arr(1:n)\n   integer, intent(in) :: q, n, m\n   integer :: i, j, md, res\n\n   res = 0\n\n   i = 0  \n   j = N \n\n   do while (i .le. j)\n      md = i + (j -i)/2   ! integer division in fortran\n      if ( md < 1 .or. md > n) then \n         print*,\"Error: md out of bounds:\", md\n         stop\n      end if \n\n       if ( arr(md) == q ) then \n          res = md - 1  ! because Java's index is md -1 (since arr(1) is java's 0)\n          exit \n       else if ( arr(md) > q ) then \n\n          res = md -1   ! since in java's index this is md-1?\n\n          j= md -1 \n       else\n\n          i = md +1 \n\n       end if \n\n   end do \n\nfun = res \n\nend function \n\nWait wait, now I'm making this more complicated. Let's see:\n\nThe key issue is that the original function is using 0-based array indices (Java), but Fortran's array is 1-based. Thus, each array accessed in the Java's arr[md] is stored in Fortran as arr(md+1). Or are the other way.\n\nAlternatively, to make it easier, we'll shift everything by one. So in the Fortran code:\n\nThe variables i and j are considered 0-based relative to Java's array. thus:\n\nJava's md maps to Fortran's array(md)+1?\n\n Or in the Fortan function:\n\nThe variables i and j can remain as 0-based (since they are integers variables not array indices). But to access the array in fortran (1-based), the index must be md +1.\n\n Thus:\n\nenum ...\n\nWithin the while loop:\n\nmd is computed as i + (j-i)/2 (same as Java).\n\nThen, the array lookup in Fortran would require using arr( md +1 ), but since the Java array was 0-based. \n\n For example, when md=0, access element 1 in Fortran's array (md+1).\n\n When md= n (Java), that would be md+1 = n+1, which is out of bounds for n elements in array.\n\n Hence the array access is again problematic. \n\n To mitigate, perhaps the initial J should be n-1, so that the maximum md is (0 + (n-1))/2 etc. \n\n Thus, the problem is that the original code has a bug with an off-by-one error. \n\n Given this is a code translation exercise, perhaps the best approach is to proceed as per the code, but adjust the indices for Fortran:\n\n0-based to 1-based ptrn array:\n\nmd is the java's indexer, so fortan's arr(md +1)\n\nHowever the initial j is n, so md can reach n \u2192 (since i starts at 0 and j is n) , then md = (0 +n)/2. \n\nThus, in Fortran this will hit the md+1 =n+1.\n\n Thus problem.\n\nSo, either:\n\n1. The function's code must have j =n-1 (in Java)\n\n but the original code could have other rules.\n\n Or:\n\n2. The array in Fortan has one extra element (like a zero at beginning) so that bound is okay. \n\n If the array starts with arr(0) (extra element), then the array in Fortran programs can be declared from 0 to n.\n\n thus:\n\nmain program would declare:\n\nallocate(arr(0:n)) \n\narr(1)= first input value, and build the rest. \n\nBut in the original Java code, the first element is arr[0], so in Fortran, the array can be zero-based.\n\n perhaps that s a way to go. \n\n Thus, making the array 0-based in Fortran:\n\nprogram codeforces_474_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger ::n, m, i \n\ninteger, allocatable :: arr(:), q(:)\n\n! Read n\n\n read(*,*) n \n\n allocate(arr(0:n)) ! 0-based: size n+1, but useful for the first element?\n\n ! read the first element into arr(0).\n\n read(*,*) arr(0)\n\n ! then for i from 1 to n-1? Or the loop for the next elements. \n\n Wait, the Java loop is from i =1 to i <n.\n\n which in terms of Fortran array zero-based would be:\n\n Fortran loop: from i = 1 to n-1 (because java's loop is for (i from 1 to i <n) \u2192 1 to n-1:\n\n In Fortran, loop from 1 to n-1:\n\n do i = 1 to n-1\n\n next input's x added to arr(i-1).\n\n arr(i) = arr(i-1) + next input.\n\n thus:\n\n do i =1, n-1\n\n read(*,*) x \n\n arr(i) = arr(i-1) +x \n\n end do \n\n Then to the n elements:\n\n Wait wait, the original array in Java's code is of length n (0-based, so elements 0 to n-1) . thus, in Fortran using arr(0 to n-1):\n\n but then declaration would be arr(0:n-1).\n\n Then, the for loop in main would be:\n\n for input:\n\n ! read the first element:\n\nread(*,*) arr(0)\n\n do i =1 to n-1:\n\n read next x.\n\n set arr(i) = arr(i-1) +x \n\n end do \n\n Then the array has length n elements.\n\n Thus the array in Fortran is declared as:\n\narr(0 :n-1).\n\n then in the function fun:\n\nthe array is passed as (0:n-1). \n\n The variables i,j are set as in Java:\n\n i=0 \n\n j =n \n\n thus j is n, which is beyond the array's length (n-1). \n\nThus in the function's loop, if md reaches n (array is 0 to n-1) then arr(n) -> index out of bounds. \n\n thus the same error.\n\n So this approach doesn't resolve the problem, but perhaps the code is intended to use the prefix sum array including the zero, so that the array has n+1 elements:\n\nsuch as:\n\n the array in Java is length n+1, with the first element arr[0] is zero. then the first input placed to arr[1], then others:\n\nthis would fix the g index.\n\n But this depends on the original problem's needs.\n\n unfortunately I don't know.\n\n Thus, the^\u539f code has a bug and must be fixed, but as per the translation task, I\uff05II proceed with the original code's parameters and adjust for the Fortran's 1-based:\n\n adjusted as following:\n\nBe sure that the function's loop does not access beyond the array.\n\n thus. I suggest to set:\n\n in the Fortran function`s jazz, the initial j is n -1.\n\n thus:\n\nmodify the I and J initialization:\n\ni=0 \n\nj= n-1 \n\n thus corrected.\n\n then, the binary search proceeds.\n\n this will ensure the md stays within the array. \n\nCould this be the solution? \n\n perhaps this is the correct approach, because the orginal Java code has the variable\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9519\u8bef, but the correct logic is to search the n elements.\n\n thus, in Fortran:\n\nfun function:\n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m)\n\n   integer, intent(in) :: arr(1:n), q, n, m\n\n   integer :: i, j, md, res\n\n   res =0 \n\n   i =1  ! originally 0, in fortran's 1-based starting at 1 ( first element)\n\n   j =n \n\n   do while( i < =j )\n\n      md = (i+j) / 2 \n\n      if ( arr(md) == q ) then \n\n         res = md \n\n         exit \n\n      else if ( arr(md) > q ) then \n\n         res = md \n\n         j = md -1 \n\n      else \n\n         i = md +1 \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   fun = res \n\nend function \n\n no . wait in fortan arrays, when the array's first\u5143\u7d20is arr(1), the initial i =0 in java corresponds to i=1 in this function.\n\n\u8fd9 way:\n\n the function search is from 1 to n.\n\n thus, in this way, the indices are properly within the array. \n\n the original Java code's bug was initially setting the j to n (0-based), but the array's maximum is n-1.\n\n thus by initializing j as n (F array is 1-based, the n is the last index. \n\n this is correct. \n\n thus the original code\u95ee\u9898 would have the error in java, but in fortran, using 1-based indices, the func can be correctly transformed by shifting the indices appropriately. \n\n this is the most reasonable approach. \n\n thus:\n\n the function code in fortran:\n\n thus, this would handle it correctly.\n\n \u8fd9 way, the fun function in Fortran\u8fd4\u56dethe index+1 \u52a01. Possibly.\n\n the main program:\n\n main code part:\n\nProgram codeforces_474_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, i \n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: arr, q \n\n read(*,*) n \n\n allocate(arr(1:n)) \n\n read(*,*) arr(1) \n\n do i=2, n \n\n   integer ::x \n\n   read(*,\"(i0)\")x \n\n   arr(i)= arr(i-1)+x \n\n end do \n\n read(*,*) m \n\n allocate(q(1:m)) \n\n do i=1, m \n\n   read(*,*) q(i) \n\n end do \n\n do i=1, m \n\n   print*, fun(arr,q(i), n , m) +1 \n\n end do \n\n deallocate(arr, q) \n\ncontains \n\ninteger function fun(arr, q, n, m) \n\nIMPLICIT NONE \n\ninteger, intent(in) :: arr(1:n), q, n, m \n\ninteger :: i, j, md, res \n\n res=0 \n\ni=l \n\nj=n \n\n do while (i .le. j) \n\n md=(i+j)/2 \n\n if (arr(md) == q) then \n\n res = md \n\n exit \n\n else if (arr(md) >q) then \n\n res = md \n\n j=md -1 \n\n else \n\n i = md +1 \n\n end if \n\n end do \n\n fun=res \n\nend function \n\n end program \n\n\u8fd9\u6837, but\u9700\u8981 adjustment:\n\n the variables i \u548c j are initialized as integers:\n\n res=0 \n\ni=1 \n\n j=n \n\n Oh right in the previous code's function.\n\n the original Java:\n\n the parameters of fun are:\n\nfunction even uses intent (n) to get the array's size.\n\n thus in the function, the loop is initialized:\n\nI=0 \u2192 converted to 1 in Fortran.\n\n j = n \n\n thus:\n\n this way, the j starts at the array's last element. \n\n this is correct.\n\n thus this code would work correctly.\n\n thus \u8fd9 is the correct translation.\n\n now checking that code:\n\n If the function returns the index of the first element larger than$q, then the result plus 1 printed. Depending on the problem, adding 1 may be needed to get the count. \n\n In the Java code, the fun returns the index, which, since the array is 0-based, adding 1 gives the count. In fortran, the function returns the 1-based index, so adding 1 also gives count + the index.): example:\n\n if thearray has elements [5], and \u67e5\u8be2q=3. \n\n the function finds that the first element is larger than q. thus in FLT func:\n\n i=1. j=1. \n\n check arr(1) >3 \u2192 yes. set res=1. and j becomes 0. so the loop breaks. returns res is 1. \n\n the main program\u52a01, so printed 2. \n\n that is correct because the number of elements is 1. \n\n thus the \u043a\u043e\u0434 works. \n\n thus this should be the correct translation.\n\n \u8fd9 is the final code."
