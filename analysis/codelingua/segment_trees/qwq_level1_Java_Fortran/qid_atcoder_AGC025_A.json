    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by looking at the Java code carefully. The main goal here is to convert each part step by step, making sure the logic remains the same.\n\nFirst, the Java code has a class with a static method sum and a main method. Fortran doesn't have classes or methods in the same object-oriented way, so I'll need to translate that into a program structure. The sum function is straightforward\u2014it calculates the sum of digits of an integer. \n\nLet me think about the sum function first. In Java, it takes an int a, initializes ans to 0, and loops while a >= 10, adding the last digit (a%10) and then dividing a by 10. Finally, adds the remaining a. In Fortran, functions are defined with a result variable. So I'll write a function called sum that takes an integer and returns an integer. The loop can use a do while loop. Wait, Fortran uses the MOD function for modulus. Also, integer division is done with /, but since in Fortran, there might be a type consideration. Let me note that the input a is an integer, so the function should handle that.\n\nThen, the main program. Java's main method reads N from the user using a Scanner. In Fortran, I can read from standard input using read(*,*) n. The conditional: if N is even, n = N/2 else (N+1)/2. Wait, actually, in the code, the variable 'n' here is assigned based on N's parity. Wait, in Java code, the local variable n is declared as int n =0, then assigned N/2 if even, and else (N+1)/2. Then compute ans as sum(1) + sum(N-1), and loop A from 1 to n inclusive, checking the sum for each A and N -A. \n\nI need to translate those variables. Let me plan:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- The function sum will be an integer function, let's name it sum_digits to avoid confusion with Fortran's SUM intrinsic function. Wait, actually, the function name can be sum but I have to make sure it's not conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps using a different name like digit_sum. Maybe better to avoid calling it sum since Fortran has a built-in function sum for arrays. So, I'll rename it to digit_sum or something. Let me proceed with digit_sum as the function name.\n\nThe main program: declare variables. The variables N and n (the control variable), the loop variable A, and ans.\n\nIn the loop from A =1 to n, compute digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A), and if that's less than the current ans, update ans.\n\nWait, the initial ans is set to digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1). Because in Java's code, N is the input. Then, the loop starts at 1 and goes up to n. Wait, in Java, N is stored in a variable called N, then in the code's logic, the n variable is set to N/2 or (N+1)/2 based on parity. So in Fortran, need to have similar logic.\n\nNow, code structure in Fortran:\n\nStart with the program name, perhaps the same as the Java class name, but Fortran programs can have a main block. Alternatively, maybe just:\n\nprogram agc025a\n  implicit none\n  integer :: N, A, ans, n\n  read (*,*) N\n  if (mod(N,2) == 0) then\n    n = N/2\n  else\n    n = (N+1)/2\n  endif\n  ans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N-1)\n  do A =1, n\n    if (digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A) < ans) then\n      ans = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(N - A)\n    endif\n  end do\n  print *, ans\ncontains\n\ninteger function digit_sum(a)\n  integer, intent(in) :: a\n  integer :: ans =0, tmp\n  tmp = a\n  do while (tmp >=10)\n    ans = ans + mod(tmp,10)\n    tmp = tmp /10\n  end do\n  ans = ans + tmp\n  digit_sum = ans\nend function digit_sum\n\nend program agc025a\n\nWait, let me check each part. The digit_sum function takes an integer a, initializes tmp and ans. Wait, in Java, the code initializes a as the input, and loops until a becomes less than 10. So in the function, we can do that with tmp, which is a copy of a. Then, the loop while tmp >=10 adds mod(tmp,10), and then divides tmp by 10. After loop, add tmp to ans. Return ans.\n\nIn the main program, after computing N, they set n as N/2 if even else (N+1)/2, which is the same as (N+1)/2 for odd numbers. For example, if N is 5, (5+1)/2 is 3, which is correct because you loop up to 3 for the maximum necessary A (since 5-3=2, and the pair (3,2) is same as (2,3)). So the loop is correct.\n\nThe initial ans is set to the sum of digit_sum of 1 and N-1. For example, if N is 10, then 1 and 9 would be considered, but not sure why that's the starting value? The code then iterates through A from 1 to n and tries to find the minimum sum. So the loop checks each A up to n, looking for the minimum value between the current ans and the sum for that split.\n\nNow checking for the variable names. In the Java code the variables are N, n (assigned from N's division), but in the Fortran code, the variables N, n should be read correctly as per.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you read N, it must be declared with an integer type. The code above does that.\n\nNow, syntax in the function:\n\ndigit_sum(a) is the name of the function. The variable 'a' is passed as an input. So in the function, the parameters must be declared as intent(in). The loop uses do-while equivalent with DO WHILE. But in Fortran, the DO WHILE needs to have the loop condition there. The code in the function:\n\ntmp is assigned to a, then a loop:\n\ndo while (tmp >=10)\n\nso the loop proceeds as expected.\n\nWait, but in the code:\n\nInside the function, after the loop, the code does ans = ans + tmp, then returns ans. That should be correct.\n\nThe variable 'ans' in the function is a local variable initialized at zero. Then in each iteration, the mod is added, and at the end, the remaining tmp (the last digit) is added.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the main program, variables must be declared. The 'N' is read, and the rest are declared as integers. The loop for A from 1 to n.\n\nWait, in Fortran, loops use a variable which is not declared as an extra variable. The loop variable A is automatically created in the loop. Wait no, actually in the example code above, the 'A' is declared as an integer in the main program's declarations. So that's correct.\n\nWait in Fortran, variables must be declared, so if you have:\n\ninteger :: N, A, ans, n\n\nthen A is a variable declared here, so the loop variable can use it. However, in a do loop like do A =1, n, that will change the value of A, and continue. That's acceptable but in Fortran, the loop variable in do loops can be an existing variable, so it's okay. That should be fine.\n\nTesting possible edge cases. For example, N=1: then n would be (1+1)/2=1. The initial ans is digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(0). Wait, digit_sum(0): Let's see the function when a is 0. The loop doesn't run (tmp is 0 which is less than 10), so ans starts at 0, and then adds tmp (0). So digit_sum(0) is 0. So ans becomes 1 +0=1. Then the loop for A from 1 to 1, so A=1. Check digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(0) which is again 1+0=1, so ans remains 1. Output 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example, N=2. Even, so n is 1. The initial ans is digit_sum(1)+ digit_sum(1) =2. Then, check A=1: digit_sum(1)+digit_sum(1) is 2, so ans stays 2. So output is 2.\n\nAnother test case: N=3. n is (3+1)/2=2. So A runs from 1 to 2.\n\nInitial ans: digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(2) =1+2=3.\n\nThen A=1: sum is 1+ (3-1)=2, same as before.\n\nA=2: digit_sum(2) + digit_sum(1) which is again 3, so ans remains 3. The minimum sum is 3. So output is 3. But wait, is there a better split? Like A=2 and 1, but same sum. Hmm, but maybe for N=9?\n\nWait the code is trying to find the minimum possible sum of the digits of A and N-A. Let's say N is 19. The maximum split is to A up to N/2 (like 9 and 10, but which gives 9 digits (1+9=10, and 10 is 1). wait 19-10=9, but A would go up to 10? Wait in the code, n is when N is odd, (N+1)/2. For N=19, n = (19+1)/2 =10. So the loop loops A from 1 to 10. For each A, we compute sum(A) and sum(19 -A). The minimum sum would be when A and B are split such that their digit sums are small. Like A=19: but not allowed beyond n. Let's see.\n\nWait the code's approach is to loop up to n (ceil(N/2)), which makes sense because after that, there would be duplicates (as A and N-A would swap, but their sum would be same). So the minimal is found in that range.\n\nNow checking for Fortran specifics:\n\nThe function needs to be inside the program or in a module. The code above uses a contain block, which is correct. The function can be placed in a contains block within the program.\n\nThe variable declarations all have to be in the beginning unless using other constructs, but the standard is to have them at the top of the program.\n\nWait in the main program, the variables must be declared before any executable statements. The code above has the declarations after the program line, which is okay.\n\nWait the code starts with program agc025a. Then implicit none, which is good practice to enforce explicit declarations. Then declares all variables: integer :: N, A, ans, n. Then reads N, computes n, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, the modulo is mod(a,b), but as the function is using a%10 in Java. So in the function, we use mod(tmp,10). Correct.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? Since the problem likely only takes positive integers, but given that the input is read via nextInt in the Java code, but for the purpose of this code, maybe it's safe. The code currently will handle a=0 or any positive integer, but we can assume inputs as per the problem's constraints.\n\nSo, the translated Fortran code should look like the above. Let me write it out properly now.\n\nWait also, in the Fortran, the variables inside the function, the 'ans' and 'tmp' must be declared. Since the function's variables: the function's parameters must have their types specified, so the function has 'integer, intent(in) :: a' for the input. The variables 'ans' and 'tmp' inside the function are declared implicitly? Wait no. Because we have 'implicit none', so all variables in the function must be declared. Oh right, the function also has 'implicit none'? Wait, the 'contains' block's functions would inherit the 'implicit none' from the program? Or each function must declare its own variables?\n\nAh, each function must have its own implicit none. So the function digit_sum must also start with 'implicit none'.\n\nWait in the code I wrote before, I wrote:\n\ninteger function digit_sum(a)\n  integer, intent(in) :: a\n  integer :: ans =0, tmp\n  ... \n\nWait then that's okay because inside the digit_sum function, the variables ans and tmp are declared. So the code is okay. The implicit none is set for the function as well? Well, since the program has implicit none, and the function is within the program's contains, perhaps it inherits it. Wait no, each procedure needs its own implicit none if you want it. Wait, I might be wrong here, but good coding practice dictates that any code using implicit none should have it in each subroutine and function. So to be safe, the function should also start with implicit none.\n\nLet me correct that. The function should have:\n\nimplicit none\n\nat the start inside the function. Let me adjust that.\n\nSo the function's code would be:\n\ninteger function digit_sum(a)\n  implicit none\n  integer, intent(in) :: a\n  integer :: ans, tmp\n  tmp = a\n  ans = 0\n  do while (tmp >= 10)\n    ans = ans + mod(tmp, 10)\n    tmp = tmp /10\n  end do\n  ans = ans + tmp\n  digit_sum = ans\nend function digit_sum\n\nWait initializing ans=0 and tmp =a. Yes.\n\nWait originally in the code I had 'integer :: ans=0, tmp', which declares them and initializes ans to 0. But in Fortran, you can initialize variables in the declaration. So that's okay, but the function's first line is the function statement, then implicit none.\n\nPutting all together, here's the corrected code.\n\nAnother thing: in the main program's initial assignment to ans:\n\nans = digit_sum(1) + digit_sum(N -1)\n\nWait yes, that's exactly the same as Java. Then the loop.\n\nYes, I think this should be correct. Now, I'll write the code."
