Wait in the isPossible function, the keys and counts are local variables with allocatable: So they must be modified in their own storage. So inserting requires a new temporary array.

Set temp_keys(1:pos-1) = keys(1:pos-1)\n\ntemp_keys(pos) = p_val \n\ntemp_keys(pos+1 : n+1) = keys(pos :n)\n\nSame for counts. Wait this is a bit involved.

Then after creating newkeys and newcounts, deallocate the old keys and counts and rePoint to the new arrays. Thus, in code:\n\nold_n = size(keys)\n\nallocate (tempkeys( old_n +1 ), tempcounts( old_n +1 ) )\n\ntempkeys(1: pos -1 ) = keys(1: pos-1 )\n\ntempkeys(pos) = p_val \n\ntempkeys( pos+1 : old_n+1) = keys( pos: old_n )\n\ntempcounts(1: pos-1 ) = counts(1: pos-1 ) \n\ntempcounts( pos ) = count_val \n\ntempcounts( pos+1 : old_n +1 ) = counts( pos : old_n )\n\ndeallocate( keys, counts )\n\nkeys => tempkeys \n\ncounts => tempcounts Wait but in Fortran you can\u2019t do pointer assignment directly if the arrays are allocatable. Alternatively, after allocation:\n\nkeys = tempkeys \n\ncounts = tempcounts Wait but if you have :\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\nallocate(keys(m+1)), etc...

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, the code is solving some problem, probably from a competition like AtCoder. The main function is using binary search with methods isPossible, solve, and set. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part does. The Java class has a set() method reading input. The solve method uses binary search between ng and ok. The core is the isPossible function, which manipulates a TreeMap to track some state.\n\nTranslating Java's TreeMap into Fortran... Oh right, Fortran doesn't have built-in data structures like TreeMap. I'll need to find an alternative. TreeMap is used here for ordered keys. Maybe an array or a list that stays sorted and can be searched? Since TreeMap is a sorted structure, perhaps the equivalent is a list that we maintain in sorted order, and use binary search for operations like lastKey and remove.\n\nWait, in the isPossible(k) method, the code does something like checking the last key in s which is >= ai. Also, when adding/removing entries. So the TreeMap operations here are pollLastEntry and getOrDefault.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps using an array to represent the keys, and another for the counts. Since TreeMap is ordered, perhaps we can have an array (or two arrays) to store keys and their counts, keeping them in sorted order and using binary search to find the required elements.\n\nAlternatively, given that the problem might have constraints that allow a more efficient approach, maybe the TreeMap here is being used with possible O(n^2) time? But since it's part of a binary search, maybe the original Java code uses TreeMap for efficiency. But Fortran might require a different implementation approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key in s is the 'p' variable in the code, and the value stored is the count how many times it's been incremented since being placed. Because the code increments s(p), and checks if it reaches k, which then removes the key and decrements p, and so on.\n\nThe loop in isPossible: when ai <= current, which is the previous a's ai (stored in current?), no, current is set as ai at the end of the loop. Wait in the loop for (ai in a):\n\nWait the variables:\n\ncurrent starts at 0. For each ai in a from start to end:\n\nIf ai <= current, then do some steps. The step where we look for entries in the TreeMap with key >= ai, perhaps?\n\nWait in the Java code's code for isPossible:\n\n- First, they do s.clear();\n- current is initialized to 0\n- loop through each ai in a array:\n\n   if ai <= current: \n\n      then if k==1, return false. \n\n      Then, while the TreeMap's last entry is >= ai, they remove it? Since pollLastEntry() gets the last entry (highest key), and if that key is >= ai, they remove it. Repeat until the last key is less than ai. \n\n      Then set p = ai -1. \n\n      Then loop:\n\n          if p <0 return false. \n\n          sp = s.getOrDefault(p,0) +1 \n\n          s.put(p, sp). \n\n          if sp ==k, then remove p from s and p becomes p-1 \n\n          else break the loop. \n\n      So, the purpose here is: when we have ai <= current, we need to adjust the entries in the TreeMap to account for this ai. \n\n      The process seems to involve moving backward until we can place p.\n\n      Maybe in Fortran, I'm going to have to represent s as two arrays: keys and counts. Let me consider that. Since TreeMap entries are kept sorted, so perhaps maintaining a list in sorted order can help.\n\nAlternatively, since the keys in s are being used in a specific way, maybe we can manage them with insertion and deletion in an array, and always keep it sorted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key can be up to n+1, and we can use an array where indices represent keys, and the values the counts. Since n can be up to 1e5 maybe? Wait the problem's constraints? Not sure, but in code, in the Java code the variables are int, which can be up to 1e9. But if n is large, an array approach might not be feasible. However, given that in the code, the variables are part of a binary search for up to n steps, perhaps the n is small enough, or the operations in isPossible have an acceptable complexity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way, but assuming that, let's think of implementing s as arrays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, use a list (as arrays) where entries are pairs (key, count), kept in sorted order. \n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nFirst: The class data members. The class has n, a (array of integers), and s.\n\nIn Fortran, we can have variables in main program or module, but likely wrap variables in a main.\n\nWait, in Fortran, there are no classes; we have to structure variables in modules or use common blocks or include variables in the main scope.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to convert this into a program with variables in the main program, and the functions set(), solve(), isPossible() as subroutines.\n\nLet me begin structuring the code.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nOriginal Java class variables: \n\nprivate int n;\n\nprivate int[] a; \n\nprivate TreeMap<Integer, Integer> s; \n\nThese become variables in Fortran. \n\nSo in Fortran's main program:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\nAlso, for the TreeMap s which is in the Java class as a TreeMap. So to represent s in Fortran:\n\nSince TreeMap has elements key and value (each an integer), perhaps an array of keys and array of counts, keeping them in order.\n\nSo:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: keys\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: counts \n\nSince TreeMap can have entries added and removed, and when needed, we need to find entries where key >= some value, so the keys array must be maintained in sorted order.\n\nAlternatively, every time we add a new key, we insert it into the correct position so that the keys array remains sorted.\n\nOther option, the code uses the TreeMap's lastKey, which is the maximum key. To do this with a sorted array, lastKey is the last element of the array. But in the Java code, when we pollLastEntry, the last entry is removed. \n\nWait the code in isPossible:\n\n   while (!s.isEmpty() && s.lastKey() >= ai) s.pollLastEntry();\n\nLoops as long as the last entry (highest key) is still >= ai. \n\nThis effectively removes all entries in s with (key) >= ai. Because:\n\n   while the TreeMap isn't empty, and the last key is >= ai:\n\n      remove the last (largest) entry.\n\n   So after this loop, the TreeMap s now contains entries with keys < ai. \n\nBut the process is removing all of the greater keys. The effect is that after this, when we look at the remaining entries, they are all keys less than ai. \n\nThen, the code proceeds with p = ai -1.\n\nSo after that, the next step is taking p = ai -1, and then trying to set s[p] +=1.\n\nBut the code does while (true) {\n\nif p <0: return false \n\nsp = s.get(ip, 0) +1; \n\ns.put(p, sp). \n\nThen, if sp ==k, then remove p from s and p becomes p-1. \n\nElse, break.\n\nThis possibly creates a chain that works down p until it can't anymore.\n\nSo in order to handle the TreeMap s in Fortran, we can keep the keys and counts, sorted.\n\nPerhaps the following structure:\n\nkeys array and counts array, which are kept in strictly increasing order of keys (or are they? Or maybe decreasing? Wait in Java's TreeMap, the natural ordering is ascending. So when you call lastKey(), it gives the largest key.\n\nHence, the keys array in Fortran must be kept in sorted order from smallest to largest. So that the last entry is the largest, so lastKey is the last element of keys array.\n\nThen, to find the last key, just check keys(size_of_keys).\n\nHowever, when doing the loop where we pollLastEntry() while they are >= ai, we need to remove all keys >= ai. So, first, the last key may be >= ai, so, we remove it (by reducing the array's end indices for keys and counts), then repeat until the last key is < ai. \n\nWait, but if there are multiple entries at the end with key >= ai. Like, if keys array has elements like ... 5, 6, 7 and ai is 6, then after removing 7 (last entry), another iteration would check if 6 is still >= ai (yes), so remove that, and so on until the last entry is 5 which is less than 6.\n\nSo the keys array must be sorted in ascending order, so that the last entry is the largest.\n\nThus, for the TreeMap:\n\nImplementation in Fortran:\n\nWe can have:\n\n* Variables: keys (array), counts (array), index cnt (the current size of keys).\n\nInitialize the TreeMap by setting cnt = 0, keys and counts empty.\n\nBut in the code, s is a TreeMap that is reinitialized each time isPossible is called by s.clear().\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nEach call to isPossible is called during the binary search, so s starts from cleared each time. \n\nIn the Java code, isPossible calls s.clear() first. Then, during processing, s is modified, but when returning, the original TreeMap is again reinitialized when the next isPossible is called.\n\nHence in Fortran, for isPossible(k) we need to start with a fresh s (i.e., keys and counts cleared). \n\nHence for each call to isPossible, the state of keys and counts must be reinitialized to empty.\n\nThus, in Fortran, since we can't have multiple instances, perhaps each call to isPossible will have to manage the s's keys and counts. Perhaps these variables need to be allocated and initialized inside the isPossible function.\n\nWait but in Fortran, functions cannot return arrays unless they're allocatable dummy, which complicates things. Maybe better to have variables in the main program that are reset when necessary, but need to be controlled.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe the best approach is to have the keys and counts arrays as attributes in the module, and have a function that handles their reset (similar to s.clear()).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the code, for each call to isPossible, we can store keys and counts in a pointer or have subroutines that can manage them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for Fortran, when writing isPossible(k), we can implement that as a function which uses its own local arrays to represent the TreeMap S, which gets initialized whenever the function is called.\n\nYes, because the Java equivalent of s.clear() in isPossible's method corresponds to not persisting any data between calls, so each isPossible call is its own individual processing.\n\nSo in Fortran, the variables for the TreeMap S can be local arrays to the isPossible function. Since the function is doing computations and needs to discard the data after returning.\n\nIn Fortran 90 or later, we can have allocatable arrays in functions. But since we can use allocatatables here.\n\nWait let's think about the design:\n\nThe main variables:\n\nThe input data is n and the array a (read in set).\n\nThe function isPossible(k) uses its own local keys and counts arrays, which are reinitialized at each call.\n\nHence within function isPossible:\n\nWe can have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:)\n\ninteger, allocatable :: counts(:)\n\nlogical :: isFound \n\nBegin:\n\nDeallocate them, then start as empty.\n\nThen, process each ai in a:\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, in the loop over ai, for each step process:\n\nWait, the problem is that the code in isPossible must process the a array sequentially, so the function can't be parallelized. So the loops must be done stepwise.\n\nSo in Fortran, the function isPossible has to process the entire a array step by step, using its own keys and counts arrays which starts empty each time.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the code structure would be:\n\nProgram main\n\n  integer :: n, current, ok, ng, k\n\n  integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n  ... read variables via set equivalent.\n\n  ... solve uses binary search.\n\n contains:\n\n  function isPossible(k) result(res)\n\n    use some module or contains within main program\n\n    ...\n\n    variables and logic here.\n\n    declare keys and counts as allocatable.\n\n    logical res\n\n    do stuff\n\n  end function\n\nend program\n\nBut in Fortran, functions can't have containments if they are external, but if contained in the program, it's okay.\n\nOkay, let me think through the steps for translating the code.\n\nFirst, the main program: \n\nRead n and a via subroutine set(), similar to Java's set.\n\nThen, binary search between ng and ok.\n\nStarting the Fortran code.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram agc029_c\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, ok, ng, k\n\n  integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n  call set() ! this reads n and a, and allocates a.\n\n  ok = n\n\n  ng = 0\n\n  do while (ok - ng > 1)\n\n    k = (ng + ok)/2\n\n    if (isPossible(k)) then \n\n       ok = k\n\n    else \n\n       ng =k\n\n    endif\n\n  end do\n\n  print *, ok \n\ncontains\n\n    subroutine set()\n\n       ! reads n, a and stores them.\n\n       integer :: i\n\n       read(*,*) n\n\n       allocate(a(n))\n\n       read(*,*) a\n\n    end subroutine\n\n    function isPossible(k_val) result(ok)\n\n       integer, intent(in) :: k_val \n\n       logical :: ok \n\n       ! This function must setup its own TreeMap equivalent\n\n       integer, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\n       integer :: current, p, ai\n\n       integer :: pos, idx, sp \n\n       integer :: i \n\n       ok = .true. \n\n       ! Initialize keys and counts as empty.\n\n       allocate(keys(0))  ! zero-length array? Or start as no elements.\n\n       allocate(counts(0))\n\n       current = 0 \n\n       keys = 0 \n\n       do i=1, n \n\n          ai = a(i)\n\n          if (ai <= current) then \n\n             if (k_val ==1 ) then \n\n                ok = .false.\n\n                return \n\n             end if \n\n             ! Now, poll all last entries with keys >= ai \n\n             ! while the keys array is not empty, and last key (keys(size)) >= ai: \n\n             !      remove it. \n\n             call while_remove_ge_ai(keys, counts, ai, ok)\n\n             if (.not. ok) return \n\n             p = ai -1 \n\n             if (p <0) then \n\n                ok = .false. \n\n                return \n\n             end if \n\n             ! Now, the loop until exit \n\n             do \n\n                ! check if p is present in keys. \n\n                ! Find the position where p would be placed. \n\n                call find_pos(keys, p, pos, idx) \n\n                sp = 0 \n\n                if (idx <= size(keys) .and. keys(idx) == p) then \n\n                   sp = counts(idx) \n\n                end if \n\n                sp = sp +1 \n\n                ! set the new count \n\n                if (idx <= size(keys) .and. keys(idx) == p) then \n\n                   counts(idx) = sp \n\n                   ! check if sp ==k_val, then remove it, and p decreases \n\n                   if (sp ==k_val) then \n\n                        ! remove p from keys and counts \n\n                        call remove_entry(keys, counts, idx) \n\n                        p = p-1 \n\n                   else \n\n                       exit ! loop \n\n                   end if \n\n                else \n\n                   ! insert p into keys array, etc \n\n                   !

The actual code requires:\n\nWhen processing each ai, after the while loop removes keys in s (in keys array) that are >= ai, then we need to process the p steps.\n\nThe problem here is handling the data structures.\n\nLet me think of helper functions.\n\nFirst, to find an entry in keys array. Since they are kept in sort order (ascending).\n\nFunction to find the index where p is in keys:\n\n- Use a binary search.\n\nAlternatively, could do:\n\nfind_pos(keys, p, pos, idx):\n\nIf keys are sorted, then idx is the index where keys(idx) == p or the insertion point before idx where p could go.\n\nImplementing a binary search function.\n\nSecond, when inserting an entry, need to keep keys in sorted order. So:\n\nTo insert p, which is not present, then insert at the insertion point, shift arrays if necessary.\n\nSimilarly when removing.\n\nHmm, since Fortran arrays can be re-allocated or modified, this can be done, but requires allocation of arrays and shifting elements.\n\nThis approach may be a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps represent s as a list, using dynamic arrays that can be expanded. \n\nAlternatively, for the keys array:\n\nInitially empty, with some initial allocation.\n\nWait Fortran's arrays are static in their dimensions unless they're allocatable. But for the problem, since in the isPossible function each call needs to reinitialize, so each isPossible is completely separate. Hence, they can have locally allocatable arrays.\n\nBut the helper functions need to handle their arrays.\n\nAlternative approach for the isPossible function:\n\nLet me use two arrays, keys and counts, initially empty. When inserting or removing keys, we maintain them in sorted order.\n\nSo, for each key p:\n\n- To check if p is present: perform a search.\n\n- When inserting p which may be present or not.\n\n- To find the insertion position, use a binary search.\n\nLet me draft the code for handling keys and counts arrays.\n\nFirst: When I need to add a new p with count sp:\n\n   if p exists already in keys (found at position idx), increment the count. \n\n   Else, insert it at the correct position and set counts(idx) = 1.\n\n   When the current count increases to sp, if sp equals k_val, then it is removed from the array, and p decreases.\n\nAdditionally, during the initial step of removing entries with keys >= ai:\n\nWe have to remove all elements in keys from the end where key >= ai.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the keys are in ascending order, so the largest key is the last element.\n\nSo to perform the while (s.lastKey >= ai) s.pollLastEntry:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- while the keys array is not empty and the last element is >= ai, remove that entry.\n\nThus, until the keys is empty or keys(size) < ai.\n\nWe can do this by checking the last index:\n\n    while (s is not empty) and (keys(size(keys)) >= ai) \n\n       remove last entry.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nwhile ((size(keys) >0) .and. (keys(size(keys)) >= ai)) \n\n   remove the last entry from keys and counts arrays.\n\nThe remove last entry would be: \n\nallocate new arrays with size reduced by 1.\n\nWait maybe better to have an integer index to track the current number of entries, to avoid reallocation every time.\n\nWait, reallocation can be expensive if done often, but given the constraints, perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me track 'cnt' as the current number of elements. So keys and counts are arrays of length, say, maximum possible n (or increment when needed) but perhaps better to dynamically reallocate.\n\nWait I think this is getting too complicated; maybe it's better to outline helper functions for this.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan for handling the keys and counts arrays:\n\nInitialize keys = [] (using zero size).\n\nSimilarly for counts.\n\nThen:\n\nTo check the lastKey (i.e., the largest key), just check if size(keys) >0 and then keys(size(keys)).\n\nTo remove the last entry:\n\n   call a function that pops the last element.\n\nTo perform the while loop for this step in isPossible:\n\nloop:\n\nif keys is not empty and last key >= ai, then remove it.\n\nDo until last key is < ai or nothing.\n\nTo remove elements in a loop:\n\n   do while ((size(keys) >0) .and. (keys(size(keys)) >= ai))\n\n       call remove_last(keys, counts)  ! pop last entry.\n\n    end do\n\nSo, the helper function remove_last would reduce the size.\n\nImplement that.\n\nThen, for adding entries:\n\nSuppose we want to add p with count of 1, and check the current count (if not exists, then 0).\n\nSo, first find_idx = find the index where p is in keys, or insertion point.\n\nif found (keys[find_idx] == p):\n\n    counts[find_idx] +=1\n\n    sp = counts[find_idx]\n\n    if sp ==k: then remove it (this index)\n\n    then decrement p.\n\nElse: \n\n    insert p at index find_idx (shift all elements after)\n\n    counts[find_idx] =1\n\n    if k_val ==1: then after insertion, if counts=1, if k_val is that value, then we remove?\n\nWait when sp reaches k, so after addition, if you reach equality, then you remove and p decreases.\n\nYes, (from the original code):\n\nif (sp ==k) {\n\n    s.remove(p);\n\n    p--;\n\n} else {\n\n    break;\n\n}\n\nHence, after insertion or update, if the count is exactly k_val, then the key is removed (p is then decremented, and the loop continues.\n\nElse, break.\n\nHence, the code in Fortran would need to do that.\n\nLet me think through code structure.\n\nPerhaps in the isPossible(k_val) function:\n\nInitialize keys and counts to empty arrays (allocated as size zero).\n\nLoop over all ai in a array.\n\nfor each ai:\n\n   check if ai <= current:\n\n      if yes:\n\n         if k_val ==1: can't proceed, so return false.\n\n         ! Remove entries >=ai\n\n         while the last key (if exists) >= ai:\n\n             remove last entry.\n\n         p = ai-1\n\n         if p <0: return false.\n\n         loop:\n\n             find existing count for p:\n\n             find index where p exists via binary search (since keys are sorted).\n\n             if exists at idx:\n\n                 current_count = counts(idx)\n\n             else:\n\n                 current_count = 0\n\n             new_count = current_count +1 \n\n             if new_count == k_val:\n\n                 then:\n\n                    if existing entry (i.e., current_count existed)\n\n                         remove that entry (idx)\n\n                    else:\n\n                        allocate them, then remove.\n\n                    then p = p-1\n\n                    so repeat loop.\n\n             else:\n\n                    if it was existing entry, set counts to new_count.\n\n                    else, insert new entry of p at idx with count 1 (then new_count is 1).\n\n                    and exit loop.\n\n             So this part is recursive and needs to be done in a loop.\n\nHmm this is getting complicated, but let's try to code.\n\nFirst, for the keys and counts arrays.\n\nInside the isPossible function:\n\n         The code steps after handling ai <= current:\n\n        ! Process the entries >= ai in S:\n\n        call remove_ge_last(ai, keys, counts)\n\n        if (size(keys) ==0 .and. ...) NO, just check if the loop condition was met.\n\nThe subroutine remove_ge_last(ai, keys, counts) would remove all keys in the keys array that are >= ai. \n\nWait but that may not be as efficient, but can be done by checking each key in reverse:\n\nAlternatively, since the keys are sorted in ascending order, the ones >=ai would be at the end.\n\nWait the keys are in ascending order, so the first key that is larger than or equal can be found via lower bound.\n\nWait to remove all from the end until less than ai.\n\nThus, the loop would work as described before.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a do loop:\n\ndo \n\n   if (size(keys) ==0) exit \n\n   last = keys(size(keys)) \n\n   if (last < ai) exit \n\n   call remove_last(keys, counts)\n\nend do\n\nThat's the same as a while loop, but in Fortran code:\n\ndo while (size(keys) >0 .and. keys(size(keys)) >= ai )\n\n   call remove_last(keys, counts)\n\nend do\n\nBut this is a do loop statement (a bit different but same effect).\n\nThus. \n\nNow for the loop over p:\n\np = ai -1 \n\nIf p <0 return .false.\n\nThen:\n\n  call process_p(p, k_val, keys, counts)\n\n  ! this loop may decrease p until some condition.\n\nWait the original code enters a loop that runs until exit.\n\nSo the process_p function handles the steps:\n\nwhile (1=1):\n\n   if p <0: return false (function fails)\n\n   check current count for p:\n\n   sp = 0 \n\n   pos, idx = find_where_p_is \n\n   if found, then sp = counts(idx)\n\n   sp +=1 \n\n   in Fortran:\n\n   current_count = 0 \n\n   call binary_search(keys, p, pos, idx, found) \n\n   if (found) then \n\n       current_count = counts(idx)\n\n   else \n\n       current_count = 0\n\n   end if \n\n   new_count = current_count +1 \n\n   if new_count == k_val then \n\n           if found: \n\n               then remove that entry (idx)\n\n           else: \n\n                we added it but now it's being removed \n\n                so add to keys, then remove.\n\n           p = p-1 \n\n        else \n\n           ! update counts \n\n           if found:\n\n               counts(idx) = new_count \n\n           else: ! add new entry\n\n               insert(p, new_count, keys, counts)\n\n           end if \n\n           exit the do loop (since we are done, no further p decrement)\n\n    end if \n\nWait this is getting quite involved. So in code:\n\nAt that loop, after p is initialized, loop until break.\n\nThe code would be:\n\n    p = ai-1 \n\n    if (p < 0) then \n\n        ok = .false.\n\n        return \n\n    end if \n\n    !

Thus, the only way new_count equals k_val in this case is if k_val is 1. \n\n               ! But earlier we checked if k_val ==1, returns false.\n\n               ! So perhaps this case can be ignored.\n\n           end if \n\n           p = p-1 \n\n           if (p <0) then \n\n                ok = .false. \n\n                return \n\n           end if \n\n        else \n\n           ! need to set this count. \n\n           if (found) then \n\n                counts(idx) = new_count \n\n           else \n\n                call insert_entry(keys, counts, p, new_count) \n\n           end if \n\n           exit \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\nWait this needs to be enclosed in a do loop that will repeat if p again needs decrement.\n\nWait no, the 'if' condition is that when new_count equals k_val, then p is decremented and **another iteration** is needed.\n\nSo the do loop must continue until such a day that new_count does not equal to k_val.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe loop is necessary:\n\ndo \n\n    ... \n\n    if (new_count ==k_val):\n\n        p was updated (p (p-1)), need to recheck:\n\n         if p <0, return false.\n\n         and start the loop over with p. (p becomes p-1)\n\n    else:\n\n        break (exit)\n\nSo the outer loop is a do-while kind of thing, but in code:\n\nloop_p:\n\n    ...\n\n    if (new_count == k_val):\n\n        p = p-1 \n\n        if (p <0 then ...) \n\n        cycle loop_p \n\n    else \n\n        exit loop_p \n\nThus this requires some looping.\n\nThis is getting quite involved but perhaps manageable.\n\nNow, the functions:\n\nFirst, the find_pos function: \n\nsubroutine find_pos(keys, p, pos, idx, found)\n\nInput: keys is an array sorted in ascending order, the value p to find.\n\nOutput:\n\n- pos: the position where the element would be inserted (e.g., like bisect.bisect_left)\n\n- idx: if found, the index where keys(idx) == p; otherwise, returns the index where it would be inserted (pos)\n\n- found: boolean indicating presence of p in the array.\n\nImplement as a binary search.\n\nFor example:\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: keys(:)\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: p \n\ninteger, intent(out) :: pos, idx \n\nlogical, intent(out) :: found \n\ninteger :: low, high, mid \n\nlow =1 \n\nhigh = size(keys) \n\nfound = .false. \n\npos =1 \n\nif (high ==0) then \n\n   pos =1 \n\n   found =.false. \n\n   idx=1 \n\n   return \n\nend if \n\ndo while (low <= high) \n\n    mid = (low + high)/2 \n\n    if (keys(mid) < p) then \n\n       low = mid +1 \n\n    else if (keys(mid) > p) then \n\n       high= mid-1 \n\n    else \n\n        found =.true. \n\n        idx = mid \n\n        pos= idx \n\n        return \n\n    end if \n\nend do \n\nif (low > high) then \n\n   pos = low \n\n   idx= pos \n\n   found =.false. \n\nend if \n\nidx = pos \n\nSo returning the insertion position and found status.\n\nSecond, inserting a value into keys and counts arrays:\n\nsubroutine insert_entry(keys, counts, p_val, count_val)\n\n     ! adjusts keys and counts arrays by inserting p_val at position pos.\n\n     ! must have the array already sorted, with the insertion point determined.\n\n     ! This requires allocating a new array with size one larger, copying the left part, inserting, copying right part.\n\n     ! Cannot modify the original arrays unless using pointers.\n\nHmm, allocation is needed:\n\nThe arrays are typically allocatable, with variables in the function.\n\nWait in the isPossible function, the keys and counts are local variables with allocatable:\n\nSo they must be modified in their own storage.\n\nSo inserting requires a new temporary array.\n\nPerhaps for each insertion:\n\nFirst, temp_keys(1:len+1) = keys(1: len) \n\n then, insert p into position 'pos':\n\nBut:\n\nSuppose keys has current len = n.\n\nWe need new array of length n+1.\n\nSet temp_keys(1:pos-1) = keys(1:pos-1)\n\ntemp_keys(pos) = p_val \n\ntemp_keys(pos+1 : n+1) = keys(pos :n)\n\nSame for counts.\n\nWait this is a bit involved.\n\nBut in Fortran 90:\n\nSuppose current keys is of length m:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: newkeys(:), newcounts(:)\n\nallocate(newkeys(m+1), newcounts(m+1))\n\nnewkeys(:pos-1) = keys(1:pos-1)\n\nnewkeys(pos: m) = keys(pos: m)\n\nnewkeys(pos) = p_val \n\nNo, perhaps it's better:\n\nif the insertion occurs at pos between 1 and m+1 (since the insertion pos can be m+1):\n\nThus:\n\nnewkeys(1:pos-1) = keys(1:pos-1)\n\nnewkeys(pos) = p_val \n\nnewkeys(pos+1 : m+1) = keys(pos : m) \n\nSimilarly for counts.\n\nThen after creating newkeys and newcounts, deallocate the old keys and counts and rePoint to the new arrays.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nold_n = size(keys)\n\nallocate (tempkeys( old_n +1 ), tempcounts( old_n +1 ) )\n\ntempkeys(1: pos -1 ) = keys(1: pos-1 )\n\ntempkeys(pos) = p_val \n\ntempkeys( pos+1 : old_n+1) = keys( pos: old_n )\n\ntempcounts(1: pos-1 ) = counts(1: pos-1 ) \n\ntempcounts( pos ) = count_val \n\ntempcounts( pos+1 : old_n +1 ) = counts( pos : old_n )\n\ndeallocate( keys, counts )\n\nkeys => tempkeys \n\ncounts => tempcounts \n\nWait but in Fortran you can\u2019t do pointer assignment directly if the arrays are allocatable.\n\nAlternatively, after allocation:\n\nkeys = tempkeys \n\ncounts = tempcounts \n\nWait but if you have :\n\ninteger, allocatable :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\nallocate(keys(m+1)), etc...\n\nBut the deallocate must be done before.\n\nThus:\n\nThis is a possible approach, but may be memory intensive. \n\nAlternatively, use index variables and temporary arrays. \n\nThis feels complicated but necessary.\n\nThe remove_last method is simpler: \n\nsubroutine remove_last(keys, counts)\n\ninteger, intent(inout) :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\ninteger :: m = size(keys)\n\nif (m ==0 ) return \n\ninteger, allocatable :: newkeys(:), newcounts(:)\n\nallocate( newkeys(m-1), newcounts(m-1) )\n\nnewkeys(1:m-1) = keys(1:m-1)\n\nnewcounts(1:m-1 ) = counts(1:m-1)\n\ndeallocate(keys, counts)\n\nkeys => newkeys \n\ncounts => newcounts \n\n! OR \n\nkeys = newkeys \n\ncounts = newcounts \n\nend subroutine \n\nWait, but in Fortran, when dealing with allocatable arrays that are local in a subroutine, their scope is limited.\n\nHmm, actually in the case of a subroutine called within isPossible, perhaps the keys and counts arrays are passed as arguments.\n\nWait all this requires passing the keys and counts arrays as arguments to the helper functions.\n\nThus, the functions are actually procedures that modify them via INTENT INOUT.\n\nAlternatively, code is going to look like:\n\nInside isPossible, after initializing keys and counts variables.\n\nNow, when removing the last, you can do:\n\ncall remove_last(keys, counts)\n\nsubroutine remove_last(keys, counts)\n\n implicit none \n\n integer, intent(inout) :: keys(:), counts(:)\n\n integer :: m, newm\n\n m = size(keys)\n\n if (m <1) return \n\n newm = m-1 \n\n if (newm ==0) then \n\n    deallocate(keys, counts)\n\n    allocate(keys(0), counts(0))\n\n  else \n\n    integer, allocatable :: temp_keys(:), temp_counts(:)\n\n    allocate(temp_keys(newm), temp_counts(newm))\n\n    temp_keys = keys( 1:newm )\n\n    temp_counts = counts(1:newm)\n\n    deallocate(keys, counts)\n\n    keys = temp_keys \n\n    counts = temp_counts \n\n  end if \n\nend subroutine \n\nWait this is possible, but requires management.\n\nAlternatively, the arrays can be passed into subroutines which have them as INTENT(INOUT).\n\nThis is going to be quite a lot of code but manageable.\n\nNow, considering time constraints here, perhaps I'll draft the Fortran code with these considerations in mind.\n\nMain variables in the main program:\n\nProgram main \n\n implicit none\n\n integer :: n, ok, ng, k_val \n\n integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n\n!

For example, the insert_entry may have bounds issues, and the bisect subroutine is named differently here as bisect instead of find_pos.\n\nAlso, there may be missing parameters, such as 'pos' in the call to insert. \n\nThis is a very rough draft, but I think this is the general path to translate the code. \n\nI need to note that in Fortran, the helper subroutines must be written properly with the correct intent for the arrays.\n\nAdditionally, error handling needs to be considered. But the core idea is there: represent the TreeMap S as keys and counts arrays, maintained in sorted order, and use helper functions for insertion, deletion, and search.\n\nAnother thing to note: the initial code's while loop uses a getOrDefault, which in the code translation should check if the element exists.\n\nAlso, in the code's isPossible function, after processing all al's elements, it returns .true. \n\nThe binary search is done **before** the function returns, so the deallocation by deallocate(keys, counts) is necessary to free the arrays.\n\nNow, given that this is a code translation task, but it's quite involved, I think this approach is acceptable. \n\nHowever, due to (time or constraints), maybe the actual code won't be as optimal, but the core logic is there."
