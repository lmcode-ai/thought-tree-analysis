The code also has:\n\ngen /= tim; \n\nWhich is integer division (gen = gen / tim). So, in Fortran, it's gen = gen / tim (since in Fortran, if both are integers, division truncates).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding the code first.\n\nThe Java code seems to be solving some mathematical problem, probably from Codeforces. Let me look through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the code has a main method which reads three variables: gen, st, and tim. It then divides gen by tim, which is a bit confusing because in Java, dividing two longs would do integer division. Wait, but in the original code, the user is passing the division to gen divided by the tim value. Maybe that's important.\n\nThe main part then sets up a loop to perform a binary search between 'beg' and 'end'. The loop uses a while(true) loop, so it needs to check break conditions. The loop tries to find a number where the difference between get(end) and get(st-1) exceeds gen, adjusting the boundaries until they converge. Finally, it prints the result which is (beg - st + 1).\n\nThere are two helper functions:\n\n1. `get(a)`: calculates some kind of accumulated count. It loops with variables ret, now=1, t=1. The loop continues until now*10 exceeds a. It looks like this function counts how many digits are in numbers up to 'a' or something similar, but I need to look closer.\n\nWait looking at the code:\n\nThe function starts with now=1 (which could be the first digit, 1-9?), then now increments by multiplying by 10 each time. For each step, it adds to ret the value (now * 9 * t). The 't' is increasing each step (since t starts at 1 and increments by 1 every loop).\n\nWait, maybe this function calculates the total number of digits from 1 up to 'a'?\n\nLet me think. For example:\n\nSuppose a= 100.\n\nThen first iteration:\n\nnow=1, t=1. now*10 is 10 which is less than 100? Well, the condition in the loop is \"if(now * 10 > a)\". Wait, that's the exit condition. Wait, the for(;;) loop is an infinite loop, and the first thing it does is check if now*10 exceeds a. If so, then it adds (a - now +1)*t and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it adds now*9*t to ret, then now *=10, t increments.\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nSuppose a =5.\n\nThen:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nnow=1. now*10 is 10 which is >5, so the condition is true. So ret += (5 -1+1)*1 \u2192 wait, 5 - now (1) is 4, plus 1 \u2192 5? The term (a - now +1)*t. Which is (5-1+1)=5, multiplied by 1. So ret +=5*1. Since this is the first step, ret would be 5. Then breaks. So the total would be 5?\n\nHmm, but for a=5, sum of digits from 1-5 is 1+1+1+1+1 + ... Wait no, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, maybe the function 'get(a)' actually returns the sum of the number of digits of all numbers from 1 to a? For example, 1 has 1 digit, 2 has 1..., 9 1, 10 has 2 digits, etc. So the total sum of digits' counts up to a. \n\nLet me test with a=5. The sum would be 1+1+1+1+1=5 \u2192 that matches the result above. So that's correct. Then for a=10: \n\nStarts with now=1 (t=1). Check if 10*1 is greater than 10? no, since 1*10 is 10, which is equal to a=10? Wait the condition is \"if (now * 10 > a)\" \u2192 now is 1, 1*10 =10, which is equal to 10, not greater. So the first condition is not met. Therefore:\n\nret += now * 9 * t \u2192 1 *9 *1 =9 \u2192 ret becomes 9. Then now becomes 10, t becomes 2.\n\nNext iteration: now (10) *10= 100>10 \u2192 yes. So then (10 to 10, since a is 10). So (10 - now (10) +1) \u2192 10 -10 =0, +1 =1. Multiply by t (which is now 2 after the first iteration? Wait let's retrace the step. After the first loop iteration:\n\nafter first loop step:\n\nafter doing now *=10 \u2192 now is 10, then t increments to 2. \n\nThen the next loop starts again. \n\nAt the start of next loop:\n\nnow is 10, now*10=100>10 (since a is 10). \n\nSo the code adds (a - now +1)* t (now is 10, so a - now is zero, so (10-10+1)=1. Multiply by t which is 2? \n\nWait t was 2 after the first iteration.\n\nWait after adding the first 9 (the first 9*1*1 from the first step), then in the next step, the code adds (10 -10+1)*2? So adding 2, so total 9+2=11.\n\nThe actual count for a=10 is sum of digits: 1 (for 1 to 9) each have 1 digit (9 numbers \u2192 9) plus 10 has 2 \u2192 total 9+2=11, which matches. So this function works for a=10. \n\nTherefore, the get(a) function returns the total number of digits from 1 up to a. So that function is correct. \n\nThe other helper function is binarySearch. The purpose isn't immediately clear, but it's used in the main. However, looking into the main function, it seems that the main uses the 'get' and a binary search approach to find the smallest or largest value within a range that satisfies some condition. \n\nThe main's binary search loop starts with 'beg' initialized to (st -1), and 'end' initially set to 1e18. They are using a modified binary search where med is computed as (beg + end)/2 +1. The loop condition is whether the difference between get(med) and get(st-1) is greater than gen. That's the condition used to adjust the boundaries.\n\nWait, the main loop looks like this while loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    med = (beg + end)/2 +1\n    if (get(med) - get(st-1) > gen)\n        end = med -1\n    else:\n        beg = med\n    if (beg == end):\n        System.out.println(beg - st +1)\n        break\n}\n\nSo, this is a variation of binary search where they're looking for the smallest 'med' (may not be, need to see which direction they go) such that get(med) - get(st-1) > gen. \n\nWait, the loop logic is:\n\nIf the current med's value (the difference between that med and st-1) is greater than gen, then we can go lower (so set end to med-1). \n\nOtherwise, the condition is not met so we move the lower bound up.\n\nWait, this seems like the bisect approach to find the minimal point where the value exceeds gen. Wait let me think:\n\nSuppose the difference get(med) - get(st-1) is the total digits between st and med (inclusive?) up to med. So if that is greater than gen, then we want to move to the left (end=med-1). But since the loop is structured this way, the final 'beg' will be the smallest index where it's more than gen?\n\nWait, perhaps this is trying to find the minimal number M where the total digits from st up to M is just over gen, and the output is (M - st +1). Because the final result is (beg - st +1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop is trying to find the M where the total digits up to M from st exceeds gen, and then the first M is the solution, with the count being how many steps (M - st+1 numbers contribute digits up to gen). Hmm.\n\nThe main idea seems to be to find a number (up to 1e18) where the number of digits from st to that number is as close or just over gen. The answer would then be the number of terms (number of numbers) which is (M - st + 1).\n\nPutting it all together, the problem is probably to compute the minimal number (n) such that the total digits from 'st' to 'n' is exactly equal to gen. Well, maybe it's the maximum N where sum up to N is within gen?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to find the number of numbers between st and some upper limit whose total digits sum to exactly gen. But the code seems to use the binary search to find where the cumulative passes gen, and then outputs the difference between the computed position and st+1. \n\nThe problem is probably from Codeforces 373B, but I can skip the details since we need only translate the code, not reimplement from scratch.\n\nNow that I have a rough idea, the task is to translate this code into Fortran. Let's look at code sections step by step.\n\nFirst, the functions:\n\npublic static long get(long a): The function returns a long. \n\nThe function loop is an infinite loop (for( ; ;)), the break is when now*10> a. Then, adds (a - now+1)*t. \n\nSo in Fortran, loops can be handled with DO loops, but the infinite loop can be a loop that breaks on condition. Since Fortran has no break, can use a loop with a condition in the 'exit when' statements.\n\nBut in Fortran, functions and subroutines are different. Also variables need to be declared with types, which in this code the functions are static in Java, but in Fortran, we have to structure this differently. \n\nThe main function in Java is the main entry point. So in Fortran, the program will have a main block, maybe a subroutine called main, with the code there.\n\nLet me structure the code step by step.\n\nFirst, declare some variables. The code declares:\n\npublic static long ans = 0;    --> need to have a global (module-scope) variable ans in Fortran.\n\nThen the main method uses Scanner to read input. \n\nWait, in the code provided, they also have variables that are class members: BufferedReader and PrintWriter. Since these are for input and output, in Fortran, perhaps we can use free I/O reads instead. Also, the second line imports java.io, but that's not needed in Fortran since it's standard.\n\nNow, translating functions.\n\nFirst, the function 'get(a)'\n\nSubroutine or a function? In Fortran, a function can return a long (integer*8). So let's define a function get(a) which returns an integer(8).\n\nNow, let's structure the function:\n\nFunction Get(a) result(ret)\n     integer(8) :: a\n     integer(8) :: ret\n     integer(8) :: now, t, temp\n     now = 1\n     t = 1\n     ret =0\n     do\n        if (now * 10 > a) then\n           ret = ret + (a - now +1) * t\n           exit\n        end if\n        ret = ret + now *9 *t\n        now = now * 10\n        t = t +1\n     end do\nEnd Function Get\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check for underflow/overflow? But given that the constraints (up to 1e18) might be okay in Fortran 64bit integers.\n\nWait in the loop, now*10 can be up to hundreds of 10s, but until it reaches when now becomes 1e18, but since a is up to 1e18, need to make sure the loop can handle large numbers, but 64bit should be okay.\n\nSecond function: binarySearch.\n\nLooking at the Java function:\n\npublic static long binarySearch(long k, long l, long r, long x)\n\nIt returns Long, and recursively called. But in Fortran, recursion is possible, but perhaps need to check. Since the function is called in the Java code when k is the value found in some context, but in the main code, I don't see where binarySearch is used. Looking back at the code given.\n\nWait oh! In the provided Java code, the main code uses only the 'get' function. The binarySearch function in the code given is present, but in the main code, it's not called. Wait, maybe I need to check if that's part of the code to be translated. The user provided Java code may have included it even though it's unused? Because examining the main code's code shows that the binarySearch function is not called there, only 'get' is used in the binary search algorithm in the main loop. That is confusing. Wait let me recheck:\n\nIn the provided Java code's main method:\n\nAfter the binary search, they are using a loop (while(true)) that uses 'get' and adjust 'beg' and 'end', but there is no call to binarySearch. So perhaps the binarySearch function is not actually used in the code?\n\nWait, looking at the code given, yes. The main loop in the main method doesn't call the binarySearch function. All calls of the binarySearch are commented in the code?\n\nWait no, perhaps the code is incomplete, or there's a mistake here. Wait the code given by user includes both the 'get' function and a binarySearch, but in the main method, the main loop uses its own binary search-like approach. \n\nThis suggests that the binarySearch function is part of original code, but perhaps was not needed here. Maybe there's a confusion here. Oh, wait perhaps the user maybe had a typo or pasting error, because the binarySearch function in the given code might not be necessary. But since the user says that it's code to be translated, regardless of its applicability, I need to translate all the code.\n\nSo both 'get' and 'binarySearch' functions must be translated.\n\nThe binarySearch function in Java is recursive. Let's see:\n\npublic static long binarySearch(long k, long l, long r, long x) {\n    if (r >= l) {\n        long mid = l + (r - l)/2;\n        if (mid > ans && mid *k <=x) ans = mid;\n\n        if (k*mid ==x) return mid;\n\n        if (k * mid >x) return binarySearch(k, l, mid-1, x);\n        else return binarySearch(k, mid+1, r, x);\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n\nSo, the function performs a binary search to find the maximum mid such that mid*k \u2264x, maybe? Also, it updates the 'ans' variable which is a static variable.\n\nHmm. The function appears to be a standard binary search, but also with an ancillary part where it keeps updating 'ans' if the current mid is larger than the previous best (ans) and meets the condition.\n\nThis function is doing a binary search between l and r to find the maximum mid where mid *k <=x. Because the structure:\n\nif k*mid >x, that's too big, go to left. else (mid*k <x), then maybe higher is better, so explore right.\n\nWait but when k*mid ==x, that's exactly the value, so return mid.\n\nThe function also checks whether mid > ans, and if so, updates ans if mid *k <=x. Since ans is a global variable. So this function could be part of some computation.\n\nHowever in the code given in the Java example above, this function is present but not used. Therefore, maybe it is a misleading part. Since the user may have included code from another problem, perhaps. However, given that the user says \"translate the Java code below\", then we need to do that.\n\nProceeding, since the user's code includes this, I'll need to translate it as well.\n\nNow, in Fortran, how to handle recursion. The function binarySearch is recursive, so in Fortran 90 and later, we can declare a recursive function. \n\nStarting with the first function, 'get(a)'.\n\nFortran syntax:\n\nFUNCTION get(a) RESULT(ret)\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a\n    INTEGER(8) :: ret, now, t\n    now = 1\n    t = 1\n    ret = 0\n    DO\n        IF (now * 10 > a) THEN\n            ret = ret + (a - now + 1) * t\n            EXIT\n        END IF\n        ret = ret + now *9* t\n        now = now * 10\n        t = t + 1\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION get\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the INTEGER(8) uses 64 bits. Depending on the compiler, we might need to use integer*8 or selected_int_kind(18). Alternatively, code with the '8' kind parameter.\n\nNext the 'binarySearch' function. Let's consider:\n\nFUNCTION binarySearch(k,l,r,x) RESULT(res)\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: k, l, r, x\n    INTEGER(8) :: res\n    IF(r < l) THEN\n        res = -1\n        RETURN\n    END IF\n    INTEGER(8) mid = l + (r-l)/2\n    mid = ...\n    etc.\n    Also, the code inside checks mid > ans etc. Since 'ans' is also a global variable in the code.\n\nBut 'ans' is declared as a static long in the Java class, which in Fortran would be a module variable accessible by the function. For Fortran code, all the functions will be in a module, or have access to a common block containing 'ans'.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran:\n\nFirst, define a module to hold the global variable 'ans':\n\nMODULE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8) :: ans = 0\nEND MODULE codeforces_mod\n\nThen, the functions can use this 'ans'.\n\nNow, the function 'binarySearch' can be written as recursive, with 'ans' accessible via the module.\n\nThus, defining the function with:\n\nFUNCTION binarySearch(k,l,r,x) RESULT(res)\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: k, l, r, x\n    INTEGER(8) :: res\n    INTEGER(8) mid\n    IF (r < l) THEN\n        res = -1\n        RETURN\n    END IF\n    mid = l + (r - l)/2\n    IF (mid > ans .AND. mid*k <= x) THEN\n        ans = mid\n    END IF\n    IF (k*mid ==x) THEN\n        res = mid\n        RETURN\n    ELSE IF (k*mid > x) THEN\n        res = binarySearch(k,l,mid-1,x)\n    ELSE\n        res = binarySearch(k, mid+1, r, x)\n    END IF\nEND FUNCTION binarySearch\n\nWait but this is recursive, so the function must be declared as 'recursive'.\n\nSo the function's definition should state 'recursive function binarySearch ... '.\n\nThus:\n\nRECURSIVE FUNCTION binarySearch(k,l,r,x) RESULT(res)\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: k, l, r, x\n    INTEGER(8) :: res\n    INTEGER(8) :: mid\n    ...\nEND FUNCTION\n\nBut in Fortran, the return variable (res) must be of compatible type.\n\nAlso, the condition:\n\nif mid *k <=x. So mid is calculated as (l + (r-l)/2), which in integer division.\n\nNow, the main program:\n\nIn the Java code, the variables are read via Scanner. \n\nThe main method reads three variables using Scanner S:\n\n    Scanner S = new Scanner(System.in);\n    long gen, st, tim;\n    gen = S.nextLong();\n    st = S.nextLong();\n    tim = S.nextLong();\n\nIn Fortran, this would be reading from stdin, using the 'read' statement. \n\nThe code also has:\n\ngen /= tim; \n\nWhich is integer division (gen = gen / tim). \n\nSo, in Fortran, it's gen = gen / tim (since in Fortran, if both are integers, division truncates).\n\nThen:\n\nbeg is initialized as st -1, end as 1e18 (which is 10**18).\n\nThe loop is an infinite loop with true, but the loop ends when beg equals end.\n\nLet's write the main program.\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_373_B\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8) :: gen, st, tim, beg, end, med, temp, x\n    ! Read variables from input\n    READ *, gen, st, tim\n    gen = gen / tim\n    beg = st -1\n    end = 10_8**18  ! Using 10^18 as an integer. Wait 10**18 may be too big for 64-bit? Let me see.\n\nWait, 10^18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros. The largest 64-bit integer is 2^63\u22121 which is about 9e18. So 1e18 is okay as integer(8) in Fortran.\n\nWait 10_8**18 \u2192 but exponentiation may not be allowed in the initialization. Maybe need to write a literal:\n\nend = 1000000000000000000_8\n\nAlternatively compute it as 10**18, but with 10 as integer(8).\n\nAlternatively compute step by step: 10*1e17, but maybe easier to write directly.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\nDO\n   med = (beg + end)/2 + 1\n   temp = get(med) - get(st-1)\n   IF (temp > gen) THEN\n       end = med -1\n   ELSE\n       beg = med\n   END IF\n   IF (beg == end) THEN\n       PRINT *, beg - st +1\n       STOP\n   END IF\nEND DO\n\nWait. There is no loop condition in the while true loop in Java. So in Fortran, an infinite loop until break is 'DO label ... ... ENDDO', but more likely an infinite loop with the loop condition terminating when break (when beg==end).\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran:\n\ndo\n    ... all steps ...\n    if (beg == end) then\n        print ... and exit\n    end if\nend do \n\nBut in the Java code's loop, after checking and setting the beg and end variables, the loop continues.\n\nThus, that's the structure.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nAlso note in the Java code, the main method uses System.out.println, so in Fortran, simply use the 'write' statement as above.\n\nNow, compiling all pieces:\n\nFirst, the module to define the 'ans' variable (though for this main program, the binarySearch function may not be needed, but as per problem statement, need to translate all the code):\n\nWait, the main code uses the 'get' function but not the 'binarySearch' function. However, the user's provided Java code does include the 'binarySearch' function. However the user may have made an error, or perhaps that function is part of the code that should be present and maybe is used in another context not shown.\n\nNonetheless, the user asks to translate the provided Java code into Fortran. So I must include the binarySearch function, even if it's not used here.\n\nBut, given that the problem may contain an error, but the user requires translation as per code given.\n\nNow, putting all into code.\n\nFirst, the module:\n\nMODULE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8) :: ans =0  ! This is for the binarySearch function's ans variable usage.\nEND MODULE\n\nThen the recursive function for binarySearch:\n\nRECURSIVE FUNCTION binarySearch(k,l,r,x) RESULT(res)\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: k, l, r, x\n    INTEGER(8) :: res\n    INTEGER(8) :: mid\n    IF (r < l) THEN\n        res = -1\n        RETURN\n    END IF\n    mid = l + (r - l)/2\n    IF (mid > ans .AND. mid * k <= x) THEN\n        ans = mid\n    END IF\n    IF (k * mid ==x) THEN\n        res = mid\n    ELSE IF (k * mid > x) THEN\n        res = binarySearch(k, l, mid-1, x)\n    ELSE\n        res = binarySearch(k, mid+1, r, x)\n    END IF\nEND FUNCTION binarySearch\n\nThen the get function:\n\nFUNCTION get(a) RESULT(ret)\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8), INTENT(IN) :: a\n    INTEGER(8) :: ret, now, t\n    now =1\n    t =1\n    ret =0\n    DO\n        IF ( now *10 > a ) THEN\n            ret = ret + (a - now +1) * t\n            EXIT\n        END IF\n        ret = ret + now *9 * t\n        now = now *10\n        t = t +1\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION get\n\nFinally, the main program:\n\nPROGRAM codeforces_main\n    USE codeforces_mod\n    IMPLICIT NONE\n    INTEGER(8) :: gen, st, tim, beg, end, med\n    ! Read variables:\n    READ(*,*) gen, st, tim\n    gen = gen / tim\n    beg = st -1\n    end = 1000000000000000000_8 ! 1e18\n    DO\n        med = (beg + end)/2 +1\n        IF ( get(med) - get(st -1) > gen) THEN\n            end = med -1\n        ELSE\n            beg = med\n        ENDIF\n        IF ( beg == end ) THEN\n            WRITE(*,*) beg - st +1\n            STOP\n        ENDIF\n    END DO\nEND PROGRAM codeforces_main\n\nWait, but in this code, the 'binarySearch' is not called anywhere. Hence, perhaps it is unused, but the user asked to translate all provided code. So we included all functions.\n\nBut the code in the Java, the main program uses 'get', which is correctly translated.\n\nTesting for possible errors:\n\nIn the 'get' function: in the first iteration, when 10*now > a?\n\nYes. So the loop should work.\n\nAnother check: for a=0? Though perhaps in the problem constraints, a starts at 1, but that's not my concern.\n\nThe loop in the main is an infinite loop until the 'if (beg == end)' is met, at which point it prints and stops, so the loop is okay.\n\nIn Fortran, when adding in the middle calculation med = (beg+end)/2 +1, the '+1' is crucial. \n\nNow, in the binarySearch( 's case, but that's just part of the code. It's present in the module, so all should be okay.\n\nWait about the 'ans' variable: the binarySearch function modifies the static 'ans' from the module. But since the main program does not use this variable, but the problem may be something where the ans is set in some function calls? But in the code given, the main code doesn't call binarySearch. Thus, the 'ans' variable may not be accessible in the current code. However, since it's part of the module, the function can access and change it, but in the provided code, since the binarySearch isn't called, it won't be used.\n\nThis suggests that in the problem the user provides, perhaps there is a mistake, but since the instructions are to translate the given code, that's all that is required.\n\nPossible other Fortran points:\n\n- The 'use codeforces_mod' must be included in all the functions and the main program.\n\n- The division in calcuating 'gen' is integer division since in Fortran, when you divide two integers, the result is integer.\n\n- The 'end = 10_8**18' would be better written with a literal as 1000000000000000000 to ensure that it's an 8-byte integer. Alternatively, using 1e18 is not correct because exponential notation for integers can be ambiguous, but using 1000... (written out) is safer.\n\n- The loop in the main program: the median calculation as (beg+end)/2 +1. The '+1' will prevent infinite loops in the algorithm, because this is the midpoint and it ensures moving towards the desired direction.\n\nSo that's the code. Now, structuring all parts into the required Fortran 90 program.\n\nAlso, note that in Fortran, the functions ( like Get and binarySearch) need to be declared before their use in the program, so they go into the module or the main program file.\n\nHence, the complete code would be:\n\nThe module and functions must be in a MODULE block, and the main program.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nAlright, so the total code would be as follows:\n\nmodules and functions first.\n\nAlright, now let's write all parts together step by step, making sure all pieces are there.\n\nWait, need to be cautious about the module's use in all the functions and program.\n\nSo, here's the full code as per the above steps:\n\nmodule codeforces_mod\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: ans = 0\ncontains\n    ! Include functions here if they are part of the module, but in Fortran we usually have separate functions.\n    ! But in this code, the functions are separate\n\nend module codeforces_mod\n\n! recursive binarySearch function:\nrecursive function binarySearch(k,l,r,x) result(res)\n    use codeforces_mod\n    implicit none\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: k, l, r, x\n    integer(8) :: res, mid\n    if (r < l) then\n        res = -1\n        return\n    endif\n    mid = l + (r-l)/2\n    ! conditions:\n    if (mid > ans .and. mid*k <=x) then\n        ans = mid\n    end if\n    if (k*mid ==x ) then\n        res = mid\n    else if (k*mid >x ) then\n        res = binarySearch(k, l, mid-1, x)\n    else\n        res = binarySearch(k, mid+1,r,x)\n    end if\nend function binarySearch\n\n! get function\nfunction get(a) result(ret)\n    use codeforces_mod\n    implicit none\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a\n    integer(8) :: ret, now, t\n    now = 1\n    t = 1\n    ret =0\n    do\n        if (now *10 > a) then\n            ret = ret + (a - now +1)*t\n            exit\n        endif\n        ret = ret + now *9 *t\n        now = now *10\n        t = t+1\n    end do\nend function get\n\nprogram codeforces_373_B\n    use codeforces_mod\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: gen, st, tim, beg, end, med\n    ! Read inputs\n    read(*,*) gen, st, tim\n    gen = gen / tim\n    beg = st -1\n    end = 1000000000000000000_8\n    do\n        med = (beg + end)/2 +1\n        if ( get(med) - get(st-1) > gen ) then\n            end = med -1\n        else\n            beg = med\n        end if\n        if (beg == end ) then\n            write(*,*) beg - st +1\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\nend program codeforces_373_B\n\nWait, but in the code, The functions 'get' and 'binarySearch' are not contained within the module's contains section, but this is allowed if they are separate program units. Since the user didn't structure them into the module, they can be written as external functions, but they must use the module for the ans variable.\n\nThus, the structure is okay. The module holds the global 'ans' variable.\n\nAll right. I think that's it. Now, verify the translation for key parts:\n\nThe main loop:\n\n    med is computed as (beg+end)/2 +1 \u2192 which would be e.g. midpoint plus 1. That ensures the midpoint is right-biased.\n\nThe 'get' function correctly implements the algorithm.\n\nYes, I think this should work."
