    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads n integers into an ArrayList called a. Then it calculates a result based on certain conditions.\n\nLooking at the code step by step:\n\n1. The code checks if the first element is more than 15. If so, the result is set to 15.\n2. If not, it loops through the elements from index 1 to n-1, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 15. \n3. If such a pair is found, it sets flag to 1 and records the previous index (pos = i-1).\n4. Then, if flag is 1 (meaning a gap over 15 was found), the result is the value at pos plus 15.\n5. If no such gap exists, the result is the last element plus 15.\n6. Finally, if the result exceeds 90, cap it at 90.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses arrays instead of ArrayLists. Since the size is known (n), I can use a fixed-size array.\n\nVariables:\n- n is an integer.\n- The array a will be of size n (Fortran arrays are usually 1-based by default, but the Java uses 0-based so maybe adjust indices)\nWait, in the Java code, the ArrayList is 0-based. So in Fortran, to avoid confusion, perhaps I can declare the array with indices 0 to n-1 for easier translation? But Fortran arrays typically start at 1, so maybe we can use 1 to n and just adjust the indexes accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to make the array 1-based but be careful with indices. Let me think.\n\nIn Java, the loop is from 0 to n-1. Let's say in Fortran, the array is 1-based. So the first element is 1. Then, in the first condition, if a(1) > 15, then result is 15.\n\nIn the for loop, for i from 2 to n (since i starts at 1 in Java, but in Fortran maybe loop from i=2 to i=n, checking a(i) - a(i-1))\nWait yes. Let me adjust the loops.\n\nAlso, the variables:\n\nIn Java:\n\nint pos =0, flag =0 ;\n\nIn Fortran, variables need to be declared before use. Maybe we can declare all variables at the beginning.\n\nThe result is determined based on flag. So:\n\nFirst, if a(1) >15: result is 15. Else, check for the differences between consecutive elements. \n\nWait, in Java, the first check is for a.get(0) which would be the first element. So in Fortran, if the array is 1-based, then a(1) is the first element.\n\nNow, step by step:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n integers into the array.\n\nDeclaration-wise, in Fortran, perhaps something like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_673_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, pos, flag, result, value\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\n    read*, n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    read*, a\n\nThen, process the array.\n\nWait, but in Java, it's read via Scanner with nextInt each time. The Fortran code can read all at once using read* ,a which would read the n elements in one line.\n\nNext:\n\nCheck if a(1) >15. \n\nIf yes, set result to 15.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck the differences between consecutive elements. Starting from the second element (i from 2 to n).\n\nWait in Java, it loops from 1 < i < n? Wait in Java's loop for(int i=1; i <n; i++), so i runs from 1 to n-1, since for Java's array is 0-based.\n\nWait, in Java, for the loop in the else clause, it's from i=1 to n-1 (since in Java the loop is for i from 1 to n-1 inclusive, since i starts at 1 and increments until i <n).\n\nWait no: in Java, the loop is from i=1 to i < n, so the indices of a go from 1 to n-1? Wait no, the loop is for (int i=1; i <n; ...) so i goes up to n-1 (since i starts from 1 and runs while i <n, so stops at i =n-1-1? Wait no, let's see:\n\nIf i <n, so when i reaches i =n-1, it will still loop, then i becomes n and break.\n\nWait, when n is the upper limit, the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nTherefore in fortran, if the array is 1-based, the loop would need to run from 2 to n?\n\nWait no. Wait, in the original Java code's loop in the else block:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++) : so in the Java code, the indices are from i=1 to i =n-1.\n\nIn the Fortran array (1-based), the equivalent loop would be for i from 2 to n.\n\nWait, because the Java i starts at 1 (for the loop), which corresponds to accessing a[1], which is the second element (since Java array starts at 0 here). So in Fortran's 1-based array, that second element would be a(2). So for each i in the loop in the else block (Java for i from 1 to n-1):\n\nIn Fortran, for i in 2 to n:\n\nWait wait. Wait, in the Java loop over the elements (starting at i=1, so the first iteration is index 1 in Array (since they start at 0 for a). So, the first element in the check is a.get(i) - a.get(i-1) is a[1] - a[0], which in Fortran's 1-based array would be a(2) - a(1).\n\nTherefore, in the Fortran code, the loop would be i from 2 to n:\n\ndo i =2 to n\nthen, compute a(i) - a(i-1) and see if it's >15.\n\nSo yes. So the loop variables need to be adjusted to account for the 1-based vs 0-based array indices.\n\nNow, in Java they set flag =0, and if any gap found, set flag to 1 and break. In Fortran, we can do that by looping and using a 'flag' variable, and when found, set it to 1, then after the loop, check the flag.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, initialize pos =0, flag =0 \n\nWait in Fortran variables need to be declared. Let me see:\n\nVariables:\n\nn, pos, flag, result as integers.\n\na is an array of n elements.\n\nNow, the first condition:\n\nIf a(1) >15 then:\n\nresult=15 \n\nOtherwise, we need to loop through the elements and check the differences.\n\nThen, in the Fortran code:\n\nElse part:\n\nflag =0 \n\ndo i =2, n\n\n   if (a(i) - a(i-1) >15) then\n\n       pos = i-1   ! Because in java, it's i-1 which is the previous index, so in Java terms, the index before i.\n\n       flag =1\n\n       exit    ! Break the loop once found.\n\n    end if\n\nend do\n\nAfter that, if flag is 1, then:\n\nresult = a(pos) +15 \n\nElse:\n\nresult = a(n) +15 \n\nWait but in Java, a.get(n-1) is the last element, and in Fortran it's a(n).\n\nYes.\n\nThen, after computing the result, check if it's over 90. If so, cap at 90.\n\nFinally, print result.\n\nNow let me structure the code step by step.\n\nDeclaration:\n\nProgram starts with:\n\nprogram codeforces_673_A\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n, i, pos, flag, result, aStart\n  integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n! Read n and allocate a array of n elements.\n  read*, n\n  allocate(a(n))\n  read*, a  ! Read all the elements into the array.\n\n  if (a(1) >15) then\n    result =15\n  else\n    flag = 0\n    pos =0  ! Not sure if needed, but let's set \n    do i=2, n\n       if (a(i) - a(i-1) >15 ) then\n          pos = i-1\n          flag =1\n          exit\n       end if\n    end do\n    if (flag ==1) then\n       result = a(pos) +15\n    else\n       result = a(n) +15\n    end if\n  end if\n\n  ! Check if result exceeds 90\n  if (result >90) then\n     result =90\n  end if\n\n  print*, result\n\nend program codeforces_673_A\n\nHmm, that's the structure.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWait in the else case (the first condition is not met), do I need to initialize pos and flag? Since in the Java code, pos and flag are initialized at the start with 0 and 0. \n\nIn the Fortran code, I should initialize flag and pos inside the else block. Wait in the Java code:\n\nInside the else block:\n\nfor (int i =1; ...)\n\nIn Fortran, variables flag and pos: in Fortran variables need to be initialized or declared before use.\n\nIn the current setup, the initial code declares pos and flag as integers, but their initial value could be undefined unless set. Wait in the code above, inside the else block, flag and pos are set only if the loop runs, but what if no condition is met?\n\nWait in the code:\n\nOutside the loop, the code here initializes flag=0 and pos=0 before the loop.\n\nYes, correct. Because in the else clause:\n\nflag =0 \n\nThen, in the loop, if a condition is found, it is set to 1. So that's okay.\n\nAlso note that in the Java code, after the loop, result is set based on flag. The same structure is followed here.\n\nTesting boundary conditions.\n\nTest case where all differences are <=15, so the else condition is flag =0, so result would be a(n)+15.\n\nWhat about if n is 1? Let's see.\n\nIf n is 1, then in the first condition:\n\nCheck a(1) >15: if yes, result is 15.\n\nElse, since n=1, the else clause is taken, but in the else clause, the loop is from 2 to n (since n is 1, 2 >1 so the loop doesn't run. So the flag remains 0, so result is a(1)+15.\n\nWait that would be okay, except what about if n is 1 and a(1) is, say, 20?\n\nThen first condition would be a(1) =20>15, so result is 15. Correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose n=3, elements [10,25, 30 ]\n\nFirst element is 10 <=15, so move into else.\n\nLoop from i=2 to 3 (since n=3):\n\ni=2: a(2) -a(1) =15 which is not greater than 15. So no.\n\ni=3: a(3) -a(2)=5 <=15 \u2192 no.\n\nThus, flag remains 0 \u2192 result is 30+15=45. Also, since 45 <90, so output 45. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: elements [5,20]\n\nCheck 5<=15. Then check between i=2 (since n=2) \u2192 a(2)-a(1)=15 \u2192 not exceeding 15? Since 15 is not >15. So the difference is exactly 15. So the condition won't set flag. Result is a(2)+15 \u2192 20+15=35 \u2192 output 35.\n\nAnother case where there's a gap. Suppose elements [5, 21].\n\nHere, a(2)-a(1)=16>15 \u2192 so in the first i=2 iteration, pos=1, flag=1 \u2192 break loop.\n\nThen result is a(1) +15 \u21925+15=20 \u2192 then check if over 90? No \u2192 output 20.\n\nWait that would be correct.\n\nAnother case where result is over 90:\n\ninput: last element is 85. Adding 15 gives 100. So the cap sets it to 90.\n\nSo the code correctly changes it to 90.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, possible issues with the Fortran code:\n\nIn Fortran, the array must be read in correctly. Using read* to read the array fills the elements in order.\n\nAnother thing: variables must be declared. The code looks okay.\n\nWait, in the code, pos is initialized to 0 in the else block. Even though in the loop, it's set to i-1. The initial value of pos is 0, but in the case where no gaps found and flag is 0, then pos is not used because the else condition is used. So the pos value of zero is okay because it's not used in that case. However, in the case where the flag is 1, pos is correctly set to i-1 which is the correct previous index.\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nWhen the loop finds a gap at i (starting from 2), then pos is set to i-1. For example, if i is 3, then pos becomes 2, which is the index before the current element where the jump occurs. Which is the correct calculation.\n\nAnother point: In Fortran, when you do exit, does it exit the loop early? Yes, the exit statement exits the current do loop.\n\nSo the code should work."
