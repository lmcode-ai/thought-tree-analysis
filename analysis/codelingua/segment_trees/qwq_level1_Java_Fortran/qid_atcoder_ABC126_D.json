Wait in the first step, node2's connection to node1 (length 20), so when DFS processes node2's edge: starting from node1, current_length 10, add edge_len 20 to get 30 \u2192's color is 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I have to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The code seems to be solving some graph problem, maybe related to bipartition. Let me read through the code again.\n\nThe main class is atcoder_ABC126_D. It uses a Point class which probably represents a node in a graph, with edges to friends and weights. The DFS function traverses the graph and assigns colors (0 or 1) based on the parity of the accumulated distance from the starting point (0).\n\nFirst, I see that in Java, there's an array for colors initialized to -1, filled using Arrays.fill. In Fortran, arrays can be initialized with a default value, but I might need to set them explicitly.\n\nThen, the main method reads n nodes and m edges (which is n-1). Since it's m = n-1, the graph is a tree. The edges are added bidirectionally between points. The DFS starts at point 0 with length 0, and then prints the colors.\n\nIn the DFS, for each node, if it's already been visited (color not -1), return. Otherwise, set color based on the total length mod 2. Then recurse on all friends adding their edge lengths.\n\nThe Point class has a name and a Map of Point to integers (friends and lengths). The becomeFriend method adds an entry to the friends map.\n\nHmm, translating this to Fortran will require handling graphs using adjacency lists or some sort of structure. Since Fortran is a statically typed language, I need to structure the data properly. But Fortran doesn't have objects or Point classes, so I'll have to use structured arrays or modules.\n\nLet me think: The main challenge here is representing the graph's adjacency lists. Since in the Java, each point has a map of friends with distances, in Fortran perhaps we can represent each node's edges as a list of connected nodes along with their edge lengths. Since the graph is a tree, the structure is straightforward.\n\nFirst steps:\n\n1. Read the number of nodes, n.\n2. The number of edges is m = n-1, as it's a tree.\n3. For each edge, read the two nodes and the length, then store adjacency info for each node.\n\nSo, in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nUse adjacency lists stored in arrays. Let me consider how to implement these structures.\n\nIn older Fortran (before F2003), pointers were a bit tricky, but assuming F2003 or later allows derived types with pointers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a list-based way. Alternatively, since the maximum nodes are n, which might not be too large, but for arbitrary m, but in this case, edges are up to n-1. Alternatively, pre-allocate a maximum size. Let me think how adjacency lists can be represented.\n\nAlternatively, as the graph is a tree, we can represent edges with two arrays: adjacent nodes and the edge lengths.\n\nWait, let's consider variables needed:\n\nWe need to have for each node a list of adjacent nodes and the length of each edge. So, a list of edges per node.\n\nIn Fortran, using a list of neighbors and list of lengths. Let's try using derived types:\n\nType node\n   type(node), pointer :: next => null()\n   integer :: friend\n   integer :: length\nEnd Type\n\nThen, have an array of pointers to the start of each linked list. But this may complicate things. Alternatively, since the edges are bidirectional, maybe store for each node the adjacency list as an array of structures.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of nodes is up to n, perhaps an adjacency list can be implemented with a dynamic array.\n\nAlternatively, use a list of edges stored in arrays. Let me think of using an array of edges, but with indices.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is small enough (since it's n-1 edges), maybe store all edges in a list, and for each node, have an array of its adjacent nodes and lengths. Since we can precompute everything, maybe for each node, store arrays of indices. For speed, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, since Fortran has a good facility for dynamic arrays using the allocatable attribute, maybe the following approach:\n\nFirst, read all the edges into arrays (current index size m), but then build an adjacency list for each node.\n\nAlternatively, since edges are bidirectional, for each edge between u and v with length l, we can store for each node u a list of v, l, and vice versa.\n\nLet me structure it like this:\n\nWe can have an array of linked lists pointing to other nodes and edge lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach in F:\n\nHave for each node an array of pointers to a dynamically- allocated array for its friends and edge lengths. But working with arrays in Fortran can be managed.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWe can pre-allocate a 2-dimensional array for edges, where for each node, we have the number of edges and a list of their neighbors and lengths. But the size might be tricky. Let me think of using dynamic arrays. For example, using an array where for each node, we have an array of neighbors and an array of lengths. Since we can store them in a list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the edge can be stored in an array of tuples (node, length). Let me think of code steps.\n\nAlternatively, let me see.\n\nFirst, in the original Java code, during the read phase:\n\nFor m edges (the tree is connected), for each edge, we read two nodes (adjusted to 0-based index), and the length. Then, each pair is added as a friend in both points. So the connected nodes have entries for each other in their friend lists with the edge length.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps, during initial setup, for each node u, v, we need to add v to u's friends with the edge length and u to v's friends with the same length.\n\nThus, for each node, store adjacency info as a list of pairs (v, l).\n\nIn Fortran, since the number of edges per node can be variable, this is a bit challenging. The most straightforward way might be to have for each node, a list stored as an array.\n\nBut I need to find the right data structure here.\n\nAnother approach: since for each node, the edges are dynamic, perhaps use linked lists. Or perhaps a 2D array for each adjacency, but with a max size of n-1, but n can be up to something like, maybe 1e5?\n\nThe problem with the code is: in Java, the tree is stored with each node's friend's list being a Map (but in reality, since it's a tree, the friends would be a linked list or any structure), but in our case, bidirectional edges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can read all edges first and store in two arrays for adjacency, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way here is to use a list for each node's edges, using dynamic allocation. Here's an idea:\n\nMake an array of adj lists, each a structure holding the list of friend indices and their lengths.\n\nIn Fortran 2003+ using derived types and pointers.\n\nLet me think:\n\nType :: AdjacentNode\n    integer, pointer :: nodes(:)\n    integer, pointer :: lengths(:)\nEnd Type\n\nType :: NodeList\n   integer :: size = 0\n   Type(AdjacentNode) :: adjInfo\nEnd Type\n\nThen have an array of NodeList type of size n, where each NodeList for a node has its edges stored in the nodes and lengths arrays.\n\nBut this might require managing dynamic allocations. Maybe better to first read all edges into a list, then compute the counts per node, allocate the array sizes, and then fill in the data.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of reading all edges first. Let me see:\n\nFirst, read all edges (m edges), store as a list (in arrays) between u and v, and their length. Then, for each node, we can count how many edges it has. Once counts are known, allocate the arrays for each node's adjacency list, then fill in.\n\nThe following steps would be:\n\nRead the nodes and edges:\n\n1. Read n and m (but m is n-1).\n\nWait, no, in the Java code, after reading n, m is set to n-1. Wait, the code has m = n-1. Because it's a tree. So the input lines will have exactly n-1 edges. So the Java code uses this fact? Because when you read, you loop m times where m is n-1.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nThe main method has:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = n-1;\n\nthen loops m-- >0 which is n-1 loops, reading edges each time.\n\nWait, so the code assumes that exactly n-1 edges will be processed, so the input is correct. So in Fortran, we will just read n, then read n-1 edges.\n\nTherefore, that's manageable.\n\nFirst step:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n-1 edges. Each edge is between two nodes (1-based?) (Java code subtracts 1, so the nodes are converted to 0-based in the code). So in Fortran, the same logic would have to be applied: read the two integers, subtract 1 from each to make them 0-based indices.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe Java code reads \"me = sc.nextInt() -1, you similar\" so input is 1-based for nodes. So in Fortran, the code will read the first input node, say u, v (as integers), then subtract each by 1 to get 0-based.\n\nOk.\n\nThen, for the adjacency lists:\n\nTo build the adjacency lists for each node, I can:\n\nFirst, read all edges into two separate arrays (from, to, length) then go through all edges and build each node's adjacency list.\n\nAlternatively, use two arrays for edges storage. Since in the Java code, for each edge, the bidirectional edge is added as friends in both nodes, but here, doing it the same way would be a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAllocate a list of edges for each node, but pre-allocating might help.\n\nAlternatively, first read all edges. Then, create for each node a list of friends and their lengths.\n\nLet me think that since the graph is undirected, for each edge (u, v, l), we need to add v to u's adjacency list with l, and u to v's as well with l.\n\nTherefore, the steps could be:\n\n1. Read n, then read n-1 triples (u, v, l).\n\n2. For each edge, add an entry to u's adjacency list (v and l), and another entry to v's list (u and l).\n\nThus, need a way to store for each node u: list of neighbor indices and lengths.\n\nTo implement this in Fortran, perhaps:\n\nWe can first count the number of edges per node, then allocate the arrays.\n\nHere's a possible plan:\n\nFirst, read all the edges and store them in a list. Then, the first pass: count per each node (0 to n-1) how many edges they have. Then, allocate the arrays for each node's adjacency arrays (nodes and lengths). Then, fill the arrays.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nInitialize for each node the count is 0.\n\nRead each edge (u, v, l). Then, increment counts[u] +=1 and counts[v] +=1.\n\nOnce counts are known, we can allocate the adjacency arrays for each node.\n\nBut in Fortran arrays must have fixed sizes. So perhaps a structure with an array for nodes and lengths for each node. Here's an idea of using derived type:\n\nFirst, we need to define a type or a structure that can hold the adjacency information for each node. Let's try this approach in code.\n\nLet me think of this:\n\nType adjacency_type\n\n    integer, pointer :: nodes(:) => null()\n\n    integer, pointer :: lengths(:) => null()\n\nEnd Type\n\nType :: node_info\n\n  integer :: count_edge = 0\n\n  Type(adjacency_type) :: adjec\n\nEnd Type\n\nThen create an array of node_info called, say adj_info_arr, with dimensions (0:n-1).\n\nWait, but maybe this is overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have for each node, an array for nodes and an array for lengths.\n\nLet me redesign:\n\nType adj_info\n\n    integer, dimension(:),pointer :: to => null()\n\n    integer, dimension(:),pointer :: len => null()\n\nEnd Type\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:) :: count_edges_per_node\n\n...\n\nRead edges and compute count_edges_per_node: counts the number of edges per node.\n\nAllocate the adj info arrays for each node:\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:) :: adj_list_nodes\n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:) :: adj_list_length\n\nand for each node, have an array. Hmm, perhaps better to collect all the edges for each node, then allocate per node arrays.\n\nBut this can be tricky. Let me think of a different approach, using 2D arrays but with the maximum possible size (which would be n-1 as in the worst case a star-shaped tree). For a node connected to all others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to read all edges first into a list, then process to build the adjacency lists.\n\nLet me step through with an example.\n\nSuppose n=3, so edges are 2.\n\nInput edges:\n\n(1,2,10), (2,3,20). Then nodes are 0-based:\n\nConvert first reads: u1=1 becomes 0, v1=2 becomes 1. The edge between 0 and 1 with length 10.\n\nSecond edge: u=2 (becomes1), v=3 (becomes2). Edge between1 and 2, length 20.\n\nThe adjacency lists for each node:\n\nnode 0: connected to 1 with 10\n\nnode 1: connected to 0 (10), and 2 (20)\n\nnode2: connected to 1 (20)\n\nSo the adj info:\n\nfor node 0: nodes(1), length(10)\n\nnode1: nodes(0,2), lengths (10,20)\n\nnode2: nodes(1), length(20)\n\nSo, to build this structure:\n\nFirst, create a temporary array to hold edge info:\n\nread all edges into a list, then for each edge, add to both nodes.\n\nBut how does one do this in Fortran?\n\nPerhaps here's the plan:\n\nFirst, read all edges, collect them into a list (arrays or a temporary structure). Then, compute per node counts.\n\nInitialize counts to zero.\n\nThen for each e in edges:\n\n   increase counts( u ) by 1\n\n   increase counts( v ) by1\n\nThen, for each node, allocate the nodes and lengths arrays of size counts[node] (this is possible only because the edges are added in both directions).\n\nOnce the counts are known for each node, allocate the arrays for each node. Then, re-traverse the edges to fill the adj lists.\n\nBut in Fortran, how to manage this?\n\nMaybe code-wise:\n\nFirst, allocate a temporary array for all edges:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: edges(:,:), edge_lens(:), since edges have 5 components: but maybe 3 for u, v, length?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFirst, allow to input n, then n-1 edges.\n\nWe need to read n-1 edges.\n\nSo:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n-1 lines each with u, v, length.\n\nThen, store all edges in arrays:\n\nfirst declare:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: edge_1(:), edge_2(:), edge_len(:)\n\nallocate these arrays for n-1 elements.\n\ndo i = 1 to n-1:\n\n   read *, u, v, l\n\n   edge_1(i) = u-1 !\n\n   edge_2(i) = v-1 ! converting to 0-based.\n\n   edge_len(i) = l\n\nend do.\n\nNow, having all edges stored.\n\nNow compute counts for each node (counted from 0 to n-1):\n\ninteger :: counts(n)\n\ncounts =0\n\ndo i=1,n-1:\n\n   counts( edge_1(i) ) = counts( edge_1(i) )+1\n\n   counts( edge_2(i) ) = counts( edge_2(i) ) +1\n\nEnd do\n\nNow, for each node, the number of adjacents is counts(node).\n\nThen, for each node, we can allocate arrays for nodes and lengths.\n\nSo, for each node i (0 to n-1):\n\nallocate adj_info(i, to(1:counts(i)), ... )\n\nWait, perhaps create an array which holds for each node the adjacency:\n\nUse dynamic arrays of pointers.\n\nWe can make use of derived-type variables with pointers.\n\nType adjacency\n\n   integer, pointer :: to(:) => null()\n\n   integer, pointer :: len(:) => null()\n\nEnd Type\n\nadjacency, dimension(:), allocatable :: adjnodes\n\nallocate ( adjnodes(0:n-1) )\n\nthen, for each node i:\n\nallocate( adjnodes(i)%to( counts(i) ) )\n\nallocate( adjnodes(i)%len( counts(i) ) )\n\nthen, fill those arrays by going over the edges again.\n\nBut to fill the arrays, need to know the order.\n\nHmm, perhaps an alternative approach for each node, track the current position in its arrays:\n\nSecond pass through all edges:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: pointer_current\n\npointer_current =0\n\ndo i =1, n-1:\n\n    u = edge_1(i)\n\n    v = edge_2(i)\n\n    l = edge_len(i)\n\n    iptr = pointer_current(u)\n\n    iptr= iptr +1\n\n    adjnodes(u)%to( iptr ) = v\n\n    adjnodes(u)%len( iptr ) = l\n\n    pointer_current(u)=iptr\n\n    ! Now process v likewise, adding u back:\n\n    u1 =v\n\n    v1 =u\n\n    l1 = l\n\n    iptr = pointer_current(u1)\n\n    iptr = iptr +1\n\n    adjnodes(u1)%to( iptr ) = v1\n\n    adjnodes(u1)%len( iptr ) = l1\n\n    pointer_current(u1) = iptr\n\nend do\n\nWait, but this works?\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nTake example from earlier:\n\nFirst edge is between u=0 and v=1 (from the first edge):\n\nFor the first edge:\n\nu=0, v=1, l=10\n\nIn the first loop:\n\nProcess u:\n\npointer_current arrays were all initialized to 0.\n\nSo for the u=0:\n\npointer_current(0) is 0.\n\nso iptr =0.\n\nthen add adjnodes(0)%to(0+1) = 1. 0+1=1st element.\n\nso adjnodes(0)%to(1)=1\n\nadjnodes(0)%len(1)=10\n\npointer_current(0)=1.\n\nThen process v=1:\n\nu1 is 1, v1=0, l=10.\n\npointer_current(1) is 0.\n\niptr becomes 1. adjnodes(1)%to(1)=0, and so on.\n\nSecond edge is between node1 and node2 (edge after converting):\n\nedge1(2): edge_1(2) is 1, edge_2 is 2.\n\nl=20.\n\nProcessing u=1, v=2, l=20.\n\n// process u=1 first:\n\npointer_current(1)=1 (since first edge added there would have been filled at 1?)\n\nWait, in first edge, the first edge between 0 and 1 was handled: for u=0, we added to the adj of 0 (iptr goes from 0 to 1). For v =1, the first time adding, the pointer was 0, so adjnodes(1)'s first element is 0. Then pointer_current(1) becomes 1.\n\nNow, the second edge: processing u=1 and v=2.\n\nSo, first:\n\nu is 1 ( original edge_1(2) is 1 )\n\nFor u=1:\n\npointer(1) is 1.\n\niptr =1 \u2192 adds adjnodes(1)'s second element to 2 ( since v=2).\n\nadjnodes(1)%to(2) will be 2, len 20.\n\niptr becomes 2, so pointer becomes 2.\n\nThen process for v=2:\n\nThe v is 2. So:\n\nu1 is v (2), v1 is u (1), l=20.\n\nSo pointer_current(2) was 0.\n\nAdd to adjnodes(2), first element:\n\nso adjnodes(2)%to(1) =1, len 20.\n\npointer_current(2) becomes 1.\n\nAfter all edges, the adjnodes would contain the required info.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThis way, the nodes' adjacency lists are properly stored.\n\nOnce the adjacency lists are ready, the main processing can proceed.\n\nThen, the DFS part.\n\nIn the Java code, the DFS is a recursive function. Fortran can handle recursion, but with the maximum depth being acceptable. Since the graph is a tree, it's acyclic, so recursion as long as the tree depth is not too large.\n\nHmm, the Java code has a static array colors. In Fortran, colors would be a 1D array, but in the code, in Java it's 0-based. So in Fortran, we'll need to have an array starting from 0: indices 0 to n-1.\n\nThe initial colors are filled with -1, which is stored as a flag for not visited. So in Fortran, declare an array of integers:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: colors(:)\n\nallocate( colors(0:n-1) )\n\ncolors = -1\n\nThen the DFS is called with the first node (0), and starting length 0.\n\nThe DFS function in Java passes the current point (equivalent to a node index?) Well, in Fortran, since we have the adjacency lists structured via the adjnodes array, the current node's index would be known.\n\nWait, looking at Java's Point class: each Point has a 'name' which is the index (from 0 to n-1). The DFS is called with the Point object, which we can track the name. In Fortran, we can track the indices rather than Point objects. Since the nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1, we can pass the current index as an integer to the DFS function, and look up in adjnodes for its edges.\n\nSo the DFS needs to get the node index and the accumulated length. The DFS function in Fortran can be a recursive subroutine.\n\nMoreover, in Fortran, variables declared in the main program can be accessible to the function, so the arrays can be globals.\n\nSo putting together the steps:\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Read all edges and build the adjacency lists using adjnodes as per above.\n\n- Initialize the colors array.\n\n- Call DFS starting at node 0, with length 0.\n\n- Then print the colors.\n\nImplement the DFS as a subroutine:\n\nRecursively:\n\nsubroutine DFS( node_idx, current_length )\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(in) node_idx, current_length\n\ninteger :: i, len_entry, neighbor, length\n\nif( colors( node_idx ) /= -1 ) return\n\ncolors(node_idx) = mod( current_length, 2 )  ! 0 or 1\n\n   do i = 1 to count_edges( node_idx )\n\n      neighbor = adjnodes( node_idx )%to(i)\n\n      length= adjnodes( node_idx )%len(i)\n\n      call DFS( neighbor, current_length + length )\n\n   end do\n\nend subroutine\n\nWait, but the count_edges(node_idx) is not stored, except through the size of the to array. Alternatively, since during the setup, for each adjnode, the array to has a length equal to counts(node).

Also, the function 'counts' for each node must be accessible in the adjacency allocations.\n\nWait, in the code steps, after computing 'counts', which is the length for each node's array, allocate the 'to' and 'length' arrays of each adjnode. The counts array is needed for the sizes.\n\nWait, but the counts array in the above code is computed and used for allocation.\n\nNow, the DFS function would have to be recursive and must access the color array and the adjnodes array. Because modularity often requires passing variables, but in Fortran, if the arrays are in the program's scope, and the DFS is a module procedure, variables can be shared.\n\nWait, in order to share the variables 'adjnodes' and 'colors', I should put the code inside a module, or use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps, instead, I can make the DFS a recursive function within the program, but in Fortran, recursive subroutines can't have their own variables unless everything is passed.\n\nAlternatively, use a module to encapsulate the variables.\n\nLet me try to structure this with a module where the adjacency arrays are available.\n\nAlternatively, pass all necessary arrays as arguments.

Wait, in the module's public section:\n\nWait in the module above, I included:\n\npublic :: dfs, init_colors, setup_graph, build_adjnodes\n\nbut maybe that's not the actual names. Anyway, the code, in the module, declares variables: colors and adjnodes. However, in the main program code above, when I allocate 'adjnodes(0: n-1)', perhaps this is getting into a problem of name clash because the module has a 'adjnodes' that is part of the module's scope.\n\nAh, right! The main program is using variables with names that may clash with the module's variables. \n\nWait, no:\n\nThe 'colors' and 'adjnodes' in the module are global variables in the module's scope. \n\nThus in the Main program, when I do:\n\n allocate( adjnodes(0:n-1 ) )\n\nThat would actually try to allocate a separate variable, but the variable 'adjnodes' in main would not exist, since it's inside the module. So there's confusion here.\n\nHmm, my mistake. \n\nSo, this approach won't work because the module's variables 'adjnodes' and 'colors' can't be directly accessed and modified unless through the module's procedures.\n\nSo perhaps better to encapsulate all variables inside the module's code.\n\nAlternatively, encapsulate the code in procedures. Alternatively, make the module have a \"BuildGraph\" function that takes the data and constructs the adjacency arrays.\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, implement everything inside a module, with the main program serving only to read input and call the functions.\n\nLet me try reorganizing the module with the necessary procedures.\n\nHere's a fresh approach:\n\n!---------- code starts here --------------------\n\nmodule graph_mod\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, allocatable :: colors(:)  ! this will store colors for the nodes.\n\n    type adjacency_node\n\n        integer, pointer :: to(:) => null()    ! nodes connected to\n\n        integer, pointer :: len(:) => null()    ! length of the edge.\n\n    end type adjacency_node\n\n    type adjacency_list\n\n        type( adjacency_node ), pointer :: nodes(:) => null()    !

Let me walk through:\n\nThe adja_info type holds for each node, the number of edges (n_edges), and arrays for nodes and lengths.\n\nCount_edges is computed for each node's degree.\n\nThen, the adjnodes allocated accordingly.\n\nThe pointer_current array is being used to track the insertion position (1-based?), since the edges are added incrementing from pointer_current (which starts at 0). Hence, each entry is the next spot (1, 2, etc).\n\nThe DFS function is inside the contains clause, so it has access to all variables declared in the main program, which are adjnodes, colors, etc.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting this example:\n\nSuppose n=3. edges:\n\n3 nodes \u2192 2 edges:\n\n edge1: 1\u8fde2 (1\u21922) \u2192 first input line as u=1, v=2, length.\n\nRead as:\n\nedge_u(1)=0, edge_v(1)=1, length=... \n\nedge2:2\u21923 \u2192 edge_u(2)=1, edge_v(2)=2.\n\nThen the adjnodes for node0:\n\nn_edges=1. nodes(1)=1, len(1)=... \n\nnode1 has n_edges=2: nodes(1,0?), or order depends on insertion:\n\nFirst insertion for node1 comes from edge_v(1)=1 (original edge1).\n\nWhen processing the first edge:\n\nFirst iteration i=1:\n\nFor edge_u(1) =0 and edge_v(1)=1:\n\nwhen adding current_v (1) to current_u(0):\n\npointer_current(0) is 0 \u2192 j=1, so node0's nodes(1)=1.\n\npointer_current now 1.\n\nThen, adding the current_u (0) into current_v (1):\n\nThe pointer for node1 was 0 \u2192 j becomes 1 \u2192 nodes(1) =0, and pointer becomes1.\n\nSecond edge (i=2):\n\nEdge_u is 1, edge_v is2.\n\nProcessing for node u=1 (current_u=1):\n\nadding neighbor node2:\n\n j is pointer(1) (which is 1) \u2192 j=2 \u2192 so nodes(2) of node 1 will be 2.\n\nlens[2] is the length from edge2's edge_length (e.g. 20?)\n\nThen pointer becomes2.\n\nAnother insertion for node2's side: adding current_u (1) into node2's first slot, etc.\n\nThus, the code should fill the adjacency properly.\n\nThe DFS function is called with node0 and length0.\n\nStarting with node0:\n\nIt's colors starts at -1. So it sets color to 0 mod2 \u21920.\n\nThen loops through its nodes (only node1):\n\ncurrent_length is 0+ length0's edge \u2192 0+10 (suppose). So total length is 10 \u2192 mod 0 \u2192 color1 is 0. But when passing this, the current_length is 10 when calling DFS for node1.\n\nWait, the edge between node0 and node1 with length 10.\n\nSo when doing the first edge:\n\nnode0's lens(1) is 10 (from edge1's length).\n\nThus, the first call gives\n\ncall DFS(1, 0+10)?\n\nWait, the current_length is length + lens[i]. Wait in DFS:\n\nAt node0, the loop:\n\nfor i from 1 to 1:\n\nneighbor is node1. current_length =0 (initial length argument) + adjnode's len[i] \u21920+10 \u219210.\n\nfor node1, the length is 10 (even \u21920 or even?)\n\nWait, when processing node0, it's length argument is 0 \u2192even \u2192 color 0.\n\nThen node1's recursive call has length 10 (even \u2192 color 0).\n\nBut proceeding with node1's adj nodes:\n\nnode1's edges are:\n\nnode0 (edge with len 10), node2 (20).\n\nSo:\n\nDFS on node1 (current_length=10)\n\nSince colors(node1) is now set to mod(10 \u21920).\n\nThen, the edges are 2.\n\nProcessing first entry (index 1 \u21920's node?\n\nadjnodes(1)%nodes(1) is node0 (from edge1, but added first)\n\nneighbor is0. call DFS(0, 10+10=20). But colors(node0?) is not -1, so returns.\n\nSecond entry \u2013 nodes(2) is node2.\n\ncurrent_length is 10+20=30 (even \u2192 mod(30)=0 \u2192 when node2 is processed.\n\nHence, node2's color is mod(30) \u21920 \u2192 but since length is 30, mod2 is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait but what about other paths?\n\nWait in the first step, node2's connection to node1 (length 20), so when DFS processes node2's edge: starting from node1, current_length 10, add edge_len 20 to get 30 \u2192's color is 0.\n\nThus in the example, the output colors are:\n\n0 \u2192 0\n\n1 \u21920\n\n2 \u21920.\n\nHmm, that's tricky.\n\nWait, in that example:\n\nThe first node has color0 (from 0 length).\n\nnode1: accumulated length is 10 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nnode2's accumulated length is 10+20=30 \u2192 even \u21920.\n\nThus all colors 0. Which is correct?\n\nAnother example with odd edges.\n\nSuppose a tree with two nodes.\n\nn=2, edge between them of length 1.\n\nRead n=2 \u2192 m=1 edges.\n\nInput edge is:1 and2 and length 1.\n\nThen:\n\nnode0 and node1.\n\nProcessing:\n\ndfs node0 with length0. color0 is 0.\n\nThen, node1's length 0+1 =1 \u2192 mod(1) \u21921.\n\nSo nodes:\n\n0:0\n\n1:1 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus code would return:\n\n0\n\n1\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, the code I wrote above in the main program with derived type adja_info and contains the DFS.\n\nAlso, note that in the adjnodes array:\n\nIn the subroutine setup, when reading edges, for each edge, the first node and the second are processed.\n\nTherefore, the above code should be correct.\n\nSo after a long thought process, that's the code."
