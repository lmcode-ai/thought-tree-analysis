    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate the given Java code to Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing. The problem is probably about finding the minimum number of steps or something similar using beacons. Let me walk through the code step by step.\n\nThe Java code starts by reading n from input, then for n times, it reads pairs of a and beacon value. The beacon array is size 1000001, which suggests that a can be up to 1e6. Then it initializes a DP array, which probably tracks some kind of maximum count.\n\nLooking at the DP logic:\n\n- For i=0, if beacon[0] is not 0, set dp[0] to 1. Otherwise, it's 0? Wait, the code says if beacon[0] !=0 then dp[0] is 1, but if it's 0, it's not initialized? Wait the code is inside the condition, so maybe in the other cases, maybe the default is dp remains 0, which I think is okay. \n\nThen, for i from 1 to 1e6-1:\n\nCheck if beacon[i] is not zero and beacon[i] is less than i. Then, it uses dp[i - beacon[i] -1] +1. Hmm, so the beacon[i] points back to a previous position, but you subtract that value and add 1. \n\nElse if beacon[i] !=0, then set to 1. \n\nElse (if beacon[i] is zero), just set dp[i] = dp[i-1], so carry over the previous value.\n\nThe maximum value in dp is tracked, and finally, the output is n minus this maximum. So the maximum sequence length is max, and n - max is the answer.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran.\n\nFirst things to note. In Fortran, arrays are declared with dimensions, maybe using 1-based or 0-based indices. Java uses 0-based here. The beacon and dp arrays here in Java are from 0 to 1e6, since the declared size is 1000001, which includes the 0 element. So in Fortran, array declarations need to do the same.\n\nFortran arrays can be declared with DIMENSION(0:1000000). But we have to check if the index can be that big. Wait, 1e6 is manageable in Fortran as long as memory allows. But I should be cautious with Fortran integer sizes. However the code will need that.\n\nNext, the input part. Java uses Scanner, so in Fortran, we can use standard input with read(*,*) statements. Let me structure that.\n\nVariables: n, and the arrays beacon and dp. Since beacon[i] is 0 or some value, maybe we can use integers. Let's see.\n\nThe code reads n first, then reads n pairs of a and b (the beacon values). Wait in the Java code, for each of n iterations:\n\nint a = sc.nextInt();\n\nbeacon[a] = sc.nextInt();\n\nSo, for each a given, we're setting a position in the beacon array. So, the a can be from 0 up to 1e6, given the problem's constraints. So maybe the beacon array is initially all zeros, and for each a, we store the beacon's value there.\n\nNow for Fortran's equivalent array declarations:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\nWait, but in Fortran, arrays can be large. The problem may require up to 1e6 elements. Let me check standard Fortran specs. Fortran compilers can handle arrays up to 1e6 elements without issue, as each integer is typically 4 bytes, so the array would be around 4*1e6*2 bytes (since two arrays), which is manageable in memory.\n\nNow, translating the loops and conditions:\n\nThe main loop for input:\n\nn is first read. Then loop n times to read a and the beacon[a].\n\nIn Fortran, read(*, *) n\n\nThen, initialize beacon. The arrays beacon and dp are declared and first initialized to zero?\n\nInitially, beacon is probably all zeros except those set by inputs. So initializing is necessary. In Java, in array declarations, primitive types like int arrays are initialized to zero, so Fortran arrays must also be initialized.\n\nIn Fortran, when you declare an array, you can set its initial values. So perhaps do:\n\nbeacon = 0\n\ndp = 0\n\nbefore starting the loops. But in code structure, after declarations.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a loop to set initial values. But in the code, the loops read a and set beacon[a], so any that are not set by input remain zero, which is correct.\n\nNow for the first part where they read the beacon array:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*, *) a, b\n\n   beacon(a) = b\n\nend do\n\nWait Wait, but in Java, the loop is for(int i=0 ...), but in this code, in the Java code, the loop is for(int i=0; i < n ...), which loops n times, each time reading 'a', but the nextInt would first read the 'a' value (position), then the beacon's value.\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nint a = sc.nextInt()  // first nextInt is the a\n\nbeacon[a] = sc.nextInt()  // second nextInt is the value\n\nYes. \n\nSo in Fortran, each of the n reads is two integers: a and value for beacon[a]. \n\nIn the loop for i from 1 to n (since Fortran loops can begin at 1, but iterations don't matter here except for reading n elements). So in Fortran's code, maybe:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read(*, *) a, val\n\n   beacon(a) = val\n\nend do\n\nBut the a can be up to 1e6, so variables must be integers.\n\nNow proceeding to the next part.\n\nThe dp array starts with:\n\nif ( bea[0] !=0 ) then, dp[0] =1 \n\nthen later for i from 1 to 1e6:\n\nChecking the beacon[i]. \n\nIn Fortran, the indexes need to be handled the same way. Starting from 0 to 1e6.\n\nThe code:\n\nif (beacon(0) /=0) then\n\n    dp(0) = 1\n\nend if\n\nWait, but for the case when beacon(0)=0, it just leaves dp(0) as zero. Which matches the original Java.\n\nThen for the loop from i=1 to 1000000 (since in Java it's 1000001, since from 0 to 1e6):\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\ndo i = 1, 1000000\n\n   if (beacon(i) /=0 .and. beacon(i) < i) then\n\n      dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) -1) +1 \n\n   else if (beacon(i)/=0) then\n\n      dp(i) =1\n\n   else\n\n      dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\n   end if \n\n   max = max(max, dp(i))\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the max variable. How is it initialized?\n\nOriginally in Java, max is 0. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: max=0\n\nThen, inside the loop, do max = max(max, dp(i)), which in Fortran would be an intrinsic function. Wait, the MAX function in Fortran requires two arguments. So perhaps max = max(max_val, dp(i)), but to get the maximum, in code:\n\nAfter the if statement blocks:\n\nmax = MAX(max, dp(i))\n\nWait yes, the MAX intrinsic takes two integers and returns the larger one. Correct.\n\nBut in the first case, when setting dp(0)=1, that will be part of the max variable. The code's first step is initializing max to zero, then after i=0, maybe the code?\n\nWait hold on, the original Java code has a loop starting i=0 to 1000000?\n\nWait the Java code for the DP loop:\n\nIn the Java:\n\nfor(int i=1; i < 1000001; ... )\n\nWait wait the Java loop after initializing dp[0] has a for loop from i=1 to below 1e6+1 (since the array's size is 1000001 elements), so looping up to but not including 1000001. So that loops i from 1 (inclusive) to 1e6 (inclusive), since the total elements are 1e6+1 (from 0 through 1e6).\n\nSo the Fortran loop is from i=1 to 1000000. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, in the initial part, when setting dp(0), the max is zero. After that, before the loop over i=1 starts, we have already considered dp(0). How does the original code compute max?\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn Java, after initializing dp[0] (if needed), then the for loop starts at i=1, looping up to 1e6.\n\nWait no, the first part:\n\nIn Java:\n\nif (beacon[0] != 0) dp[0] =1; \n\nthen:\n\nfor (int i=1; i < 1000001; i++) {\n\n... compute dp[i], then set max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);\n\n}\n\nWait, the i in that loop starts at 1 and goes up to 1000000 (since the condition is i < 1e6+1).\n\nTherefore, the 0 index was handled before the loop, but the loop over i=1 to 1e6. \n\nAh right, so in the initialization step for dp(0) in the Java code, that affects dp[0], but the max is only initialized to 0 and not yet updated to include that?\n\nWait let's look at the Java code's steps:\n\nThe Java code:\n\nint max =0;\n\nthen ... \n\nif (beacon[0] !=0) dp[0] =1; \n\nThen, in the loop over i from 1 to i <1e6+1:\n\nInside that loop, each dp[i] is calculated, and then the max is compared and updated.\n\nBut the dp[0] was set to 1 (if needed), but the max variable hasn't been updated for dp[0]. Oh wait no! The original code doesn't.\n\nWait, the Java code's 'max' starts at 0. Then the first check is for dp[0], but after setting dp[0], they do NOT update the max. So after initializing dp[0], the max is still 0?\n\nBut that's a bug? Let me see.\n\nWait Let me check.\n\nIn the Java code:\n\npublic static void main ...\n\nmax =0;\n\nif (beacon[0] !=0) dp[0] =1;\n\nthen loop from 1 to 1e6 (inclusive):\n\nSo for the 0 case, dp[0] may be set to 1 (when beacon[0] is non-zero). So the max is not yet updated with that value.\n\nWait that's a problem. Because then, if beacon[0] had a non-zero and the maximum dp[0] is 1, the max might miss that unless done in the loop.\n\nLooking at the code more carefully:\n\nThe code:\n\nIn Java:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    int a = sc.nextInt();\n\n    beacon[a] = sc.nextInt();\n\n}\n\nif (beacon[0] !=0) dp[0] =1;\n\nthen for i =1, iterate 1e6 times (i up to 1e6):\n\nin each loop step:\n\ncompute dp[i], and inside each iteration, do 'max = Math.max(max, dp[i])'\n\nThus, the first dp[i] in the loop is for i=1. The dp[0] was set before the loop, but never enters the max calculation? So that would be a problem.\n\nWait, this is a mistake in the original code?\n\nWait let me see. If beacon[0] is non-zero, then the dp[0] is set to 1. But the max was initialized as 0, so after setting dp[0], it's possible that the max is still tracking only the values inside the loop (i=1 and above). So the initialization would miss the first case. So the code as given in Java has that issue?\n\nFor example, if n=0 (unlikely given constraints), but in a case where beacon[0] is non-zero. Then the max would miss the dp[0] of 1. So the original code may have an error.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that the beacon[0] can't be non-zero? Let me see the problem description's constraints. Oh, since I don't have the problem statement, maybe the code is correct as per the problem. Perhaps beacon[0]=0 in all valid test cases. But maybe not. Maybe the code has a bug.\n\nWait, the code is given as a correct solution to a programming competition. It's possible that the competition problem has the property that beacon[0] must be zero?\n\nAlternatively, the code is incorrect. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the code's final output: n - max. \n\nSuppose for example, that the maximum possible sequence is starting at 0. Then dp[0] would be 1, but the loop over i from 1 won't include that.\n\nWait perhaps the code is wrong? Wait but maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait in the loops:\n\nWait the loop for i from 1 to 1e6:\n\nEach time after computing dp[i], it updates max with Math.max.\n\nSo for example, the dp[0] is only handled if the loop is supposed to include i=0 but it is not in the loop.\n\nWait this must be a mistake in the code!\n\nWait the code in Java sets the dp[0] conditionally, but does not add it into the max until the loop. \n\nSo for the case beacon[0] is non-zero, dp[0]=1. So then, the maximum would be 1. But the loop starts at i=1, so the first iteration could set dp[1] possibly higher, but if even in that case, when n=1 and only a=0 is set with beacon[0] = 5, then max is computed as follows:\n\nAfter setting dp[0]=1, the max will not include this value until somewhere.\n\nWait, OHHHH. The code in Java does not update the max variable for dp[0] case. Only during the loop starting at 1. Thus, there is a bug here.\n\nWait that would be a mistake. Oh no, but perhaps the code is still correct. Maybe that beacon0 is treated specially?\n\nWait if the code is correct, perhaps that in the problem's scenario, beacon[0] must be zero? Or maybe that even if beacon[0] is set to a value, the value is smaller than 0 (but beacon can only take non-negative integers)?\n\nWait according to the code's first condition inside the for loop, when beacon[i] !=0 and beacon[i]<i. Since i=0 in that case, but beacon[i] is set to something non-zero (since we set beacon[0] !=0), then the first condition (beacon[i] is not zero and beacon less than i (which is 0). So since beacon[i] is positive, then the first condition would require beacon[i]<i, which would be beacon[0] <0 (since i is 0). That cannot be true. Hence the first condition would not be triggered. The else if would check if beacon[i] !=0 (yes), then sets dp[0] to 1. So in that case, when beacon[0] is non-zero, the dp[0] is 1. So the maximum would be 1. But in the code, the loop over i=0 is not part of the for loop. Wait the original code's for loop over i starts at 1, so the i=0 case is handled before it?\n\nNo, wait the code for dp[0] is done before the for loop, but the max isn't updated. Therefore, the max variable won't know that dp[0] is 1.\n\nSo this is a bug in the original code. But since I have to translate it literally, I should replicate exactly the Java code's behavior, including that bug. \n\nTherefore, perhaps in the code's logic, the beacon[0] can be non-zero, but in the code, when beacon[0] is non-zero then dp[0] is set to 1, but that value is not included in max calculation. Hence, if the maximum sequence is just length 1 (at position 0), and other dp[0..something] don't get to 1, then the code would mistake it. But perhaps according to the problem's conditions, this cannot happen. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct despite that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to correct the code, but the problem says I should translate it. Since the user provided the Java code and just wants the Fortran equivalent, perhaps the code has a bug but it's intended to be translated as is.\n\nSo, proceed with the code's as it is, without changing the logic, because maybe the problem's constraints ensure beacon[0] is zero.\n\nTherefore, proceeding to translate into Fortran.\n\nNow the variables:\n\nWe'll need variables n, a, val (for the beacon's value), max_val, the beacon and dp arrays as integers with size 0 to 1e6.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, array indices can start from 0.\n\nBut to declare arrays in Fortran from 0 to N (say 1e6):\n\ninteger, dimension (0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nprogram codeforces_607_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, val, max=0\n\n    integer, dimension (0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\n    ... initialization ...\n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    beacon = 0\n\n    dp = 0\n\n    do i =1, n\n\n      read(*,*) a, val\n\n      beacon(a) = val\n\n    end do\n\n    if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n\n      dp(0) =1\n\n    end if\n\n    do i=1, 1000000\n\n       ! compute dp[i] per the conditions\n\n       if (beacon(i)/=0 .and. beacon(i)<i) then\n\n           dp(i) = dp(i-beacon(i)-1)+1\n\n       else if (beacon(i)/=0) then\n\n           dp(i) =1\n\n       else\n\n           dp(i) = dp(i-1)\n\n       end if\n\n       max = max(max, dp(i))\n\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*) n - max\n\nend program codeforces_607_A\n\nWait but in the first part, beacon is initialized to all zeros.\n\nBut wait initializing beacon and dp arrays:\n\nIn Java they are initialized to 0, as in array declarations. In Fortran, after declaration, without explicit initialization, they would have garbage values. Therefore, we have to explicitly set them to zero.\n\nHence, after declarations:\n\nbeacon = 0\n\ndp = 0\n\nThese assignments will set all elements to zero.\n\nThat should be done before the loop for reading in the inputs.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nStart with declarations for n, variables.\n\nThen, initialize beacon and dp to 0.\n\nRead n, process the inputs, then set beacon(a) = val.\n\nProceed to process dp[0].\n\nThen the loops.\n\nWait, the code after read(n):\n\nbeacon and dp arrays set to 0 first.\n\nWait, in the code outline, after the initial declaration:\n\nInside the program:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nbeacon =0\n\ndp =0\n\nBut perhaps that should be first.\n\nWait no, first, in the code:\n\nAfter the variables are declared, the code:\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   beacon =0\n\n   dp =0\n\nNo. Order matters. The initialization must happen before the first use. So the correct order:\n\nThe code would be:\n\nprogram ...\n\n...\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, a, val=0, max=0, i\n\ninteger, dimension (0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   beacon = 0\n\n   dp = 0\n\n   -- then read the a and val.\n\nWait in the code above, the code reads the n first, then does the initialization?\n\nBut that would lead beacon and dp being initialized correctly.\n\nWait better to do:\n\n  read(*, *) n\n\n   beacon(:) = 0\n\n   dp(:) = 0\n\nBut in Fortran, to set all elements to zero, using the assignment beacon =0 and dp=0 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but in some Fortran versions, you have to do beacon = 0, but it might be better to do assignment for the whole array.\n\nWait the line beacon =0 would set all elements to zero, yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the loop where we read a and val: \n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   read (*,*) a, val\n\n   beacon(a) = val \n\nend do \n\nWait, but in Fortran, a can be as large as needed. The beacon array is large enough.\n\nNext, setting dp(0):\n\nif (beacon(0)/=0) dp(0) =1.\n\nThen the loops:\n\ndo i=1,1000000\n\n   ... \n\nLoop over 1 to 1e6.\n\nNow, the condition in the if statements:\n\nInside the first condition: beacon(i)/=0 and beacon(i) <i.\n\nIf so, the new dp is the previous dp up to i - beacon(i)-1 plus 1.\n\nWait wait:\n\ndp(i - beacon(i) -1) +1.\n\nWait in the Java code, it's dp[i - beacon[i] -1] +1. \n\nYes, so same as in the code.\n\nBut in Fortran indices are 0-based so this is okay.\n\nNow, else if statement: the condition is beacon not zero but not less than i.\n\nWait in that case:\n\nbeacon[i] !=0, and not less than i. Wait but it must be >=i, so if the beacon[i] is exactly equal to i, then this clause is entered.\n\nSo, enter the else if, then set to 1.\n\nElse (the beacon is zero), then set as dp[i] = dp[i-1].\n\nThen compute max.\n\nNow, the max variable is initialized to zero. \n\nSo, all cases except the initial dp(0) are considered inside the loop. So the dp(0) is set correctly but not considered in max.\n\nSo if the user's code is wrong here, then so will the translated Fortran.\n\nNow the final line:\n\nwrite(*,*) n - max.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues in the code:\n\nPossible INTEGER overflow? But in Fortran, integers can handle 1e6.\n\nAlternatively, for the beacon indices must be within 0 to 1e6, since that's the array size.\n\nIn Fortran, if a is read to be beyond that, then beacon(a) would be out of bounds. However, the original Java code also has a beacon array of 1e6+1 elements. So, the input a has to be in that range. \n\nAssuming that the problem constraints ensure that the a's are within the array's indices. Hence the code is okay.\n\nNow, let me write the final code.\n\nWait also, in the loop for reading the n pairs: in Fortran, the variable 'a' is read, could be the output of the for loop index variable i? Probably, no. Because in the code's code outline above, in the do i=1,... loop: variable i is used as the loop index. Using 'i' inside a for loop is okay as long as it's not shadowed. But the 'a' is stored as a variable, so it should be okay.\n\nPotential mistake: in the code, in the first part, when setting beacon(a) = val, so when a is read from the input, it must be within 0 to 1e6. Again, the problem's constraints should handle that.\n\nNow writing all that into code:\n\nprogram codeforces_607_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, a, val, max, i\n    integer, dimension(0:1000000) :: beacon, dp\n\n    ! Initialize max\n    max = 0\n\n    read(*, *) n\n\n    ! Initialize beacon and dp arrays to zero\n    beacon = 0\n    dp = 0\n\n    ! Read the next n pairs (a and val)\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*, *) a, val\n        beacon(a) = val\n    end do\n\n    ! Handle dp[0] case\n    if (beacon(0) /= 0) then\n        dp(0) = 1\n    end if\n\n    ! Process from 1 up to 1000000\n    do i = 1, 1000000\n        if (beacon(i) /= 0 .AND. beacon(i) < i) then\n            dp(i) = dp(i - beacon(i) - 1) + 1\n        else if (beacon(i) /= 0) then\n            dp(i) = 1\n        else\n            dp(i) = dp(i - 1)\n        end if\n\n        max = max(max, dp(i))\n    end do\n\n    ! Output the result\n    write(*, *) n - max\n\nend program codeforces_607_A\n\nWait, but in the code, in the first loop's 'do i=1,n', 'i' is used as the counter, but the 'a' and 'val' are stored in their variables. That's okay.\n\nThe condition in Fortran uses .AND. operator for logical expressions, which is correct.\n\nThe declaration of max: in the original code it's initialized to zero, so here, 'max =0' after declarations.\n\nVariables 'a' and 'val' can also be declared as integers.\n\nNow, checking for any possible array size issues.\n\nIn the loop from i=1 to 1000000, which is correct since in Java it's <1e6+1.\n\nWait in Java the code runs for i from 1 to 1e6 (inclusive?), yes.\n\nAlso, in the first condition in the do loop:\n\nWhen checking beacon[i] <i.\n\nBeacon[i] must be a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, I think this code should replicate the original Java code exactly, including the oversight where dp[0] might be 1 and max isn't updated for it.\n\nSo the only problem here is: if the beacon[0] is non-zero and the maximum (dp value) is one at position 0, but the main loop starts at i=1, the max may miss this.\n\nBut the user wants a translation of the exact code.\n\nThus, the code is correct according to the Java original."
