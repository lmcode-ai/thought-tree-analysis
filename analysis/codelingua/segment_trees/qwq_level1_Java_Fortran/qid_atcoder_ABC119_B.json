Alternatively, perhaps better to write:\n\nFUNCTION solve(x, u) RESULT(total)\n  REAL(KIND=8), DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN) :: x\n  CHARACTER(LEN=3), DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN) :: u\n  REAL(KIND=8) :: total\n  REAL(KIND=8) :: factor\n  INTEGER :: i\n  total = 0.0d0\n  DO i = 1, SIZE(x) IF (u(i) == 'JPY') THEN\n      factor = 1.0d0\n    ELSE\n      factor = 380000.0d0\n    END IF\n    total = total + x(i)*factor\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION solve\n\nThis is cleaner.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe Java program reads N entries from the user. Each entry has a number (double) and a unit (string), either \"JPY\" or another currency. The solve function calculates the sum where each value is converted to JPY: if the unit is \"JPY\", it's kept as is, otherwise multiplied by 380000. Then it prints the total.\n\nFirst, the Fortran structure: Fortran programs usually have a main program, and functions. The code uses modules for input/output, but since the user's Java code is using Scanner, I'll need to handle input similarly with Fortran's read statements.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Read N from input.\n2. Read N pairs of x and u.\n3. Compute the sum of each x * (1 if 'jp' else 380000). But need to check case, as Fortran is case-insensitive by default? Or not? Wait, Fortran can treat strings case-sensitively, but depends on compilation options. To be safe, perhaps convert input to uppercase or compare case-insensitively. The Java code uses equals(\"JPY\"), so we can check exactly that, case-sensitive? Hmm, the problem says \"JPY\" as the unit, so probably the input is given as exactly \"JPY\" or others. But maybe better to make sure, but let's stick to case-sensitive in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be declared with a size, but since the size N is read at runtime, we need to use array allocation. Alternatively, use dynamic arrays via allocatable arrays.\n\nFortran 90 or higher (since code uses features like allocatable arrays, etc.) So plan:\n\nMain program:\n\n- Declare an integer N.\n- Read N from input.\n- Allocate two arrays: real*8 x(N) and character(len=3), dimension(:) :: u. Wait, but the strings in Java are stored as \"JPY\" or maybe other strings of variable length? Wait the problem probably states that the unit is either \"JPY\" or something else (like \"BTC\" probably, based on the problem ABC119 B, which I know is called \"Kiloton\", maybe the units are JPY or BTC which is converted by 380000). The exact units beyond JPY are not important, as only JPY are considered. So any unit that's not JPY gets multiplied by 380000. So in the code, I need to check if the string is exactly 'JPY'? So length may be fixed as 3 characters? Let me check the Java code: in the Java code, they read the second part as sc.next(), which would read until whitespace. The problem's input would probably have units of 3 letters. Assumption here is that each u is a 3-character string (like JPY or BTC). So in Fortran, we can declare u as a character array of length 3.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: N\n\nreal(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: x\n\ncharacter(len=3), dimension(:), allocatable :: u\n\nIn main program:\n\nRead N.\n\nallocate x(N) and u(N).\n\nRead N lines, each line has a double (real*8) then the string (3 chars).\n\nThen compute the sum, loop over each element, for each i, if u(i) == 'JPY', add x(i), else add x(i)*380000.0d0.\n\nThen print the total.\n\nThe Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC119_B\n...\n\nsubroutine solve?\n\nBut in Java, the solve function is static, so in Fortran, perhaps a function that takes x and u as parameters. However, in Fortran, passing allocatable arrays can be handled. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the compute can be done in the main program.\n\nAlternatively, the function solve can be a function that takes the arrays.\n\nLet me structure:\n\nFunction solve(x, u, n) which returns the sum. Parameters:\n\nThe arrays x and u, and the integer n? Since in Fortran, arrays passed to functions need to have their sizes handled properly.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when passing an array to a function, the function can have the array declared with assumed size: real(kind=8):: x(:), like.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nThe main program:\n\nRead N, allocate arrays, read the data, then compute sum with a function, then print.\n\nThe function:\n\nfunction solve(x, u) result(total)\n  real(kind=8), dimension(:), intent(in) :: x\n  character(len=3), dimension(:), intent(in) :: u\n  real(kind=8) :: total, factor\n  integer :: i\n  total = 0.d0\n  do i = 1, size(x)\n     if (u(i) == 'JPY') then\n        factor = 1.0d0\n     else\n        factor = 380000.0d0\n     end if\n     total = total + x(i)*factor\n  end do\nend function solve\n\nWait but let me see: the function could be written in the code.\n\nPutting it together:\n\nThe main program:\n\nprogram atcoder\nimplicit none\ninteger :: n, i\nreal(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: x\ncharacter(len=3), dimension(:), allocatable :: u\nreal(kind=8) :: total\n\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(x(n), u(n))\n\ndo i=1,n\n   read(*,*) x(i), u(i)\nend do\n\ntotal = solve(x,u)\nwrite(*,*) total\n\ndeallocate(x, u)\nend program\n\nfunction solve(x, u)\nreal(kind=8), dimension(:) :: x\ncharacter(len=3), dimension(:) :: u\nreal(kind=8) :: solve, total, factor\ninteger :: i\n\ntotal = 0.0d0\ndo i = 1, size(x)\n   if (u(i) == 'JPY') then\n      factor = 1.0d0\n   else\n      factor = 380000.0d0\n   end if\n   total = total + x(i)*factor\nend do\nsolve = total\nend function\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the function needs to be declared or placed in a module before it's used. Since it's in the same program, putting it after the main program's definition (but before the end program) should work in some compilers, but better to place the function after declaring the variables but before the read.\n\nAlternatively, the function can be an internal function, but maybe simplest to put it after the main code, but in Fortran 90, the function can be place after the main program's code as long as it is before the end program statement.\n\nAlternatively, the program could have an implicit none for local variables, function parameters, etc. Also, note that in Fortran, the == for character strings compares lex order? Well, if the u is read as exact 'JPY' then comparing should work.\n\nAnother point: when reading the u string, in Fortran when reading with read(*,*) u(i), then if the input has a longer string, it might read the first three characters. For example, if the input is \"JPY \" (with space), but I think the problem states that the unit is either \"JPY\" or another string (like \"BTC\"), so when reading via read(*,*) the second value would read the next word as the string, trimming whitespace, probably.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when reading a character string from a stream with list-directed input, if the variable has a length of 3, then it would read three characters from the next word, truncating or padding as needed. So if the input unit is \"JPY\", that's three characters, so okay. If it's longer, like \"Bitcoin\", then it would have a problem, but the problem likely states that inputs are either JPY or BTC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses \"BTC\" as the other unit, so the code would be okay.\n\nNow considering the initial Java code's solve method uses IntStream.range to map each element. The equivalent in Fortran is a loop over the arrays with DO loop.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n1000 JPY\n0.1 BTC\n5000 JPY\n\nShould give 1000 + 0.1*380000 + 5000 = ?\n\n0.1 *380000 = 38000 \u2192 total is 1000 +38000 +5000 = 44000 \u2192 44000 = 44000.0 ?\n\nWait, wait let's recalculate:\n\n1000 JPY \u2192 1000.\n\n0.1 BTC \u2192 0.1 *380000 \u2192 38000.\n\n5000 \u2192 5000. Sum is 1000+38000+5000 = 44000 \u2192 the output would print 44000.0 ?\n\nHmm yes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nWhat if all are JPY. So sum is straightforward.\n\nPossible gotchas in Fortran code:\n\n- Make sure the function is correctly returning real(kind=8).\n\nIn the function, the variable solve is declared as the function's return type. Since it's a function, the statement \"solve = total\" is required.\n\nAnother thing: the function is in the code. Let me check syntax.\n\nThe function's definition needs to have \"FUNCTION solve(x,u) RESULT(total)\" or similarly. Wait the code I outlined earlier says:\n\nfunction solve(x, u)\nreal(kind=8), dimension(:) :: x\ncharacter(len=3), dimension(:) :: u\nreal(kind=8) :: solve, total, factor\nthen compute total and set solve = total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to write:\n\nFUNCTION solve(x, u) RESULT(total)\n  REAL(KIND=8), DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN) :: x\n  CHARACTER(LEN=3), DIMENSION(:), INTENT(IN) :: u\n  REAL(KIND=8) :: total\n  REAL(KIND=8) :: factor\n  INTEGER :: i\n  total = 0.0d0\n  DO i = 1, SIZE(x)\n    IF (u(i) == 'JPY') THEN\n      factor = 1.0d0\n    ELSE\n      factor = 380000.0d0\n    END IF\n    total = total + x(i)*factor\n  END DO\nEND FUNCTION solve\n\nThis is cleaner. So the function uses the RESULT clause to name the return value. That might be better practice.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nThe complete code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC119_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: N\nreal(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: x\ncharacter(len=3), dimension(:), allocatable :: u\nreal(kind=8) :: total\n\n! Read N\nread(*,*) N\n\n! Allocate arrays\nallocate( x(N), u(N) )\n\n! Read N lines of x and u\ninteger :: i\ndo i = 1, N\n   read(*,*) x(i), u(i)\nend do\n\n! Compute total using solve function\ntotal = solve(x, u)\n\n! Output the result with enough precision\nwrite(*,*) total\n\n! Deallocate arrays (though may not needed in program termination, but good practice)\ndeallocate(x, u)\n\ncontains\n\n  real(kind=8) function solve(x, u)\n    real(kind=8), dimension(:), intent(in) :: x\n    character(len=3), dimension(:), intent(in) :: u\n    real(kind=8) :: factor\n    integer :: i\n    solve = 0.0d0\n    do i = 1, size(x)\n      if (u(i) == 'JPY') then\n        factor = 1.0d0\n      else\n        factor = 380000.0d0\n      end if\n      solve = solve + x(i)*factor\n    end do\n  end function solve\n\nend program atcoder_ABC119_B\n\nWait, I placed the function after the contains keyword. That way, in Fortran 90, we can have internal procedures inside the main program. Alternatively, the function must be either external or in a module, but using the CONTAINS block allows the function to be defined in the program unit. That's better because otherwise, the compiler would complain about the order.\n\nAh yes, using CONTAINS after the variables is crucial here, so the code structure should be:\n\nThe program has a CONTAINS section where the solve function is placed.\n\nIn my previous code outline, I did that so the solve function is inside the program unit, after the CONTAINS keyword.\n\nSo that code should be correct.\n\nI should also consider the format of the output. The Java code uses System.out.println(solve(...)), which for a double uses default formatting. In Fortran, writing with * write(*,*) might be sufficient, although sometimes the decimal precision matters. For double/REAL(kind=8), it's usually okay, but in Fortran the default write might format it as a real number with decimal places. The problem expects the precise sum, so maybe as * for the output.\n\nTesting in code: when I have the sample input with 0.1 BTC, the factor is 380,000, so 0.1 *380k =38,000. Which is an integer, so the sum there is 44,000, so the output would be written correctly.\n\nEdge cases: Very large numbers? The REAL*8 should handle it.\n\nAnother edge case: when all are BTC, then the sum would require multiplying each by 380000.\n\nAnother thing: the strings are compared exactly for 'JPY'. Case sensitive? If the input is uppercase, then. Since Java uses equals(\"JPY\"), the Fortran code must as well. If any input line's u is not exactly 'JPY' (for example, different case letters, but the problem's input is defined to give either JPY or other units like BTC), so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the code should work."
