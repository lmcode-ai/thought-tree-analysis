The formula gives ( 10 /1 +1)/2 = (11)/2=5.5 \u2192 trunc to 5 (since integer division). But maybe in Java the code uses (10/1 +1) is 11, then divided by 2 rounds down, gives 5. So for integer division it's correct. Another example: suppose n=2, and a is 4 and 6. Then the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. Suppose m is 24.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. It's solving a problem, probably from AtCoder contest ABC150's D problem.\n\nThe code reads two integers n and m, then reads n integers into array a. Then it processes them to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of certain values. \n\nFirst, in the main part, the code initializes an array a with n elements. Each element of a is the input divided by 2. Wait, why divided by two? Maybe because the problem requires considering even numbers? Hmm, not sure yet but I'll proceed.\n\nThe code then calculates the LCM of the elements in a. It uses a helper function getGCD to compute the GCD and then the LCM via the formula LCM(a,b)=a*b/GCD(a,b). For each element in a, it updates the LCD (which is actually the LCM) step by step. If at any point LCD exceeds m, it outputs 0 and exits. That probably means any multiple beyond m can't count, so the answer is 0.\n\nNext, after computing the LCM, there's a loop checking each a[i] such that LCD divided by a[i] is even. If any of those are even, then output 0 and exit. Maybe this ensures that each a[i] must divide LCD such that LCD/a[i] is odd? Not sure, but the logic is to check that.\n\nFinally, if all checks pass, the output is (m/LCD +1)/2. Probably because the valid numbers are multiples of LCD, but compensated for the division by 2 earlier.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me note the differences between Java and Fortran here.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses modules but maybe I don't need that here. The main program will be a program block. Arrays in Fortran are declared with dimensions, and are 1-based by default, but can be declared with a starting index. Since the Java code uses 0-based arrays, maybe I have to set the array index from 0 or adjust loops accordingly. Hmm, in Fortran, arrays typically start at 1 unless specified. So for variables like a in the code, which are declared as int[n], in Java they are from 0 to n-1. Therefore, in Fortran, I can declare a(n) with indices 1 to n, then adjust loops accordingly. Need to watch out for the loops.\n\nVariables: Java has a Scanner class. In Fortran, we can use read(*,*) to get inputs. Since in Java the code reads n, then m, then n numbers, the Fortran code will do the same via read statements.\n\nThe GCD function: In Java it's a recursive method. Fortran can handle recursion, but sometimes people prefer loops. Here, the getGCD function is recursive, so in Fortran I need to create a function with recursion. The parameters would be integers or integers, but since the Java code uses long, maybe the Fortran version uses integers of larger kind (like 8 bytes) to handle big numbers. Since m could be up to what? Let's check problem constraints, but since it's translated, the code's original constraints must have been considered. The LCM might be very large, so variables should be 64-bit integers. So in Fortran, using integer(selected_int_kind(18)) variables perhaps, but I'll use kind=8 which is 64-bit on most systems.\n\nSo, for the variables n and m: in Java they're integers. Since in Fortran, they can be integers as well, unless m can be up to something very big. The output's formula (m/lcd) may need m and LCM to be 64-bit integers. Therefore, maybe using integer(kind=8) types for n, m, a array, gcd, and LCM.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n, m: in Fortran, read(*,*) n, m.\n\nThen read an array a of n elements, each is input number divided by 2. So in Fortran:\n\nallocate or declare an array of size n (since n is read dynamically). Wait, in Fortran 90 and later, you can have allocate-able arrays, but the Java code uses fixed n at the start, so maybe declare a as a(n) with explicit-shape. Hmm, but the size is known after reading n. Therefore better to read n first, then declare the array.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variables have to be declared before they can be used. So, the code would need to read n first, then declare the array a with size n, then m. But in Fortran you can't have a declaration after the read unless using declarations in a way that allows it. Alternatively, use an allocatable array. Let me think:\n\nProbably:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc150_d\n  implicit none\n  integer(kind=8) :: n, m\n  integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  integer(kind=8) :: i, current_a, gcd_val, lcm\n\n  read(*,*) n, m\n  allocate(a(n))\n\n  do i =1, n\n     read(*,*) a(i)\n     a(i) = a(i)/2\n  end do\n\nThen compute the LCM.\n\nWait, but in Java, the loop was for(int i=0; i<n; i++), but here in Fortran it's from 1 to n, so array indices start at 1.\n\nSo in the loop, the first element is a(1) which is a[0] in Java.\n\nThen, the LCM computation:\n\ninitialize LCM =1. So initially,\n\nlcm = 1\n\nThen loop over elements of a:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   compute GCD of current LCM and a(i), then set LCM = LCM * a(i) / GCD(...)\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i in 1 to n:\n   gcd_val = getgcd(lcm, a(i))\n   lcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n   if (lcm > m) then\n       print *, 0\n       stop\n   end if\nend do\n\nThe getgcd function is recursive. So in Fortran:\n\nfunction getgcd(a, b) result(res)\n   integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: a, b\n   integer(kind=8) :: res\n\n   if (b == 0) then\n      res = a\n   else\n     res = getgcd(b, mod(a,b))\n   end if\nend function\n\nBut I need to handle the parameters correctly. The base is Euclidean algorithm, right? So that function should be declared before the main code, perhaps.\n\nWait, in Fortran, functions can be in the same program. But I have to declare the function. Maybe declare it inside the main program as an internal function.\n\nAlternatively, put all in the main program? Hmm. Let me see:\n\nAnother approach: declare the function inside the program block, as an internal function.\n\nWait, in standard Fortran, how are functions included?\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to write a recursive function at the top.\n\nBut, in Fortran code blocks, the order is: program, then any functions or subroutines, then statements.\n\nWait, actually, in Fortran, the main program is after all the external functions, etc. But internal functions can be inside the program. Let me structure the code.\n\nAlternatively, I'll need to write the getgcd() function as a separate function.\n\nAlternatively, in the C manner, perhaps define a recursive function.\n\nAlternatively, since recursion is okay, but recursion in Fortran 90+ is allowed.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc150_d\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(kind=8) :: n, m\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    integer(kind=8) :: i, lcm, res\n\n    read(*,*, end=10) n, m\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    do i =1, n\n      read(*,*) a(i)\n      a(i) = a(i)/2 \n    end do\n\n    lcm =1\n\n    do i = 1,n\n        call compute_gcd(lcm, a(i), lcm)\n        gcd_val etc. Hmm, maybe better to compute via function:\n\nWait, code for the LCM step. Let's think again:\n\nIn Java code:\n\ngcd = getGCD(lcd, a[i]);\n\nlcd = lcd * a[i] / gcd;\n\nThe function getGCD is a helper that returns the GCD.\n\nSo in Fortran, the getgcd function returns the GCD, so we can call it as:\n\ngcd_val = getgcd(lcm, a(i))\n\nthen compute new LCM: lcm * current a(i) divided by gcd_val.\n\nWait, but the initial LCM is 1, and then being multiplied by each a's elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each element in a array:\n\ncurrent_gcd = getgcd(lcm_val(old), a(i))\n\nlcm_val = lcm_val * a(i) / current_gcd.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nIn the loop:\n\ngcd_val = getgcd(lcm, a(i))\n\nlcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n\nProceed as per.\n\nSo, the function getgcd must be defined before the main program. Wait, no, in Fortran, functions can be inside the program. Let me think: define an internal function.\n\nWait, here's the code outline:\n\nprogram main_name\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: n, m\n    ... variables...\n\ncontains\n    function getgcd(a, b)\n    contains...\n    end function\n\n end program.\n\nWait, no, perhaps:\n\nAlternatively, I can have a function getgcd inside the program, as an internal function. The code would look like this:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_D\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8) :: n, m, i\n  integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  integer(8) :: lcm, gcd_val, current_a\n  integer(8) :: result\n\n  ! Read Inputs\n  read(*,*) n, m\n\n  allocate(a(n))\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     read(*,*) a(i)\n     a(i) = a(i) / 2\n  end do\n\n  lcm = 1\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     gcd_val = getgcd(lcm, a(i))\n     lcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n     if (lcm > m) then\n        print *, 0\n        deallocate(a)\n        stop\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Now check for each term (lcm /a[i]) %2 ==0\n\n  do i = 1, n\n     if (mod( lcm / a(i), 2) ==0 ) then\n        print *, 0\n        deallocate(a)\n        stop\n     end if\n  end do\n\n  ! Output the formula\n  result = (m / lcm +1 ) / 2\n  print *, result\n\n  deallocate(a)\n  stop\n\ncontains\n\n  recursive function getgcd( a,b ) result(res)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n    integer(8) :: res\n\n    if (b ==0 ) then\n       res = a\n    else\n       res = getgcd(b, mod(a,b))\n    end if\n  end function getgcd\n\nend program atcoder_ABC150_D\n\nWait, that's more like it. Now, checking possible mistakes.\n\nFirst, the variables. The a array is read, divided by 2. The loop indices in Fortran.\n\nAlso, note that in the initial loops, i is from 1 to n, which matches the 0-based Java code (because in Java, the array was 0-based but with n elements, so loop from 0 to n-1 corresponds to 1 to n in Fortran).\n\nThe getgcd function is recursive, so the 'recursive' keyword is necessary.\n\nIn Fortran, mod(a,b) is mod function, which is similar to % in Java but returns the remainder. Wait, but when a is divided by b, mod gives remainder. However, the GCD function uses a mod b, which is correct in the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe first check after computing LCM each step: if LCM exceeds m, output 0 and stop, as in the Java code.\n\nThen, the second loop: for each a(i), check if (lcm/a(i)) is even. The condition in Java is 'if ((lcd / a[i]) % 2 == 0)'. In Fortran, 'mod(lcm/a(i),2) ==0 would be equivalent.\n\nWait, in the code above, mod( lcm /a(i), 2) ==0 ?\n\nYes. So in that case, the code proceeds to print 0.\n\nFinally, the answer is (m/lcm +1)/2. In integer division, in Fortran, using / with integers may perform division with truncation towards zero. Need to ensure that m/lcm is integer division.\n\nFor example, if m is even, then (m/lcm +1)/2 is ( (whole number) +1 ) / 2, which in integer division would be correct?\n\nWait, in Java, the code uses (m / lcd + 1)/ 2 as an integer division. In Fortran, since the variables are integers, the expression will automatically be integer division. So if m and lcm are 8, then (8/4 +1)/2 = 3/2 =1 (truncated to 1). Wait, but maybe need to ensure it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid possible issues with the division, since Fortran does integer division automatically here.\n\nNow, what about the variables' size? Since LCM could become very large. The original code uses long, which is 64 bits. Therefore, variables need to be 64 bit (like integer(8)), which I've accounted for in the code as integer(8). However, in some Fortran compilers, the 8 might be different. But generally, kind=8 is 64-bit on most 64-bit systems. Alternatively, using parameter for reliability, but that's maybe more complex.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nLet me think about test cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m= any.\n\nSuppose the input is like:\n\n1 10 3 \u2192 in Java a becomes 3/2 =1. LCM is 1. Then check LCD (lcm) is 1. The formula gives (10 /1 +1)/2 = (11)/2=5.5 \u2192 trunc to 5 (since integer division). But maybe in Java the code uses (10/1 +1) is 11, then divided by 2 rounds down, gives 5. So for integer division it's correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=2, and a is 4 and 6. Then the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. Suppose m is 24. The formula would be (24/12 +1)/2 \u2192 (2+1)/2 = 3/2 \u2192 1.5 \u2192 1.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nWait, the problem's original context is probably about counting the number of integers \u2264m that are multiples of each a_i's original value after accounting for division.\n\nBut maybe the translation is correct.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the LCM is even or something, but in the second part checks whether lcm / a_i is even. If not, then proceed.\n\nWait in code:\n\nif (mod( (lcm/a(i)), 2)==0) then \u2192 any of these being even \u2192 Output 0.\n\nBecause for example, in the LCM must not be twice a multiple? Wait, perhaps the problem requires that each a[i] (before division by 2?), but need to think of the problem.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct in translation. So the Fortran code I outlined should work.\n\nNow syntax fixes.\n\nLet me check code details:\n\nThe program uses a recursive function, which needs the 'recursive' keyword in the function definition.\n\nAlso, in Fortran, variable declarations need to include type and perhaps kind. So all variables are declared with integer(8), which in Fortran is written as integer(kind=8), but also sometimes integer*8.\n\nWait, in my code I have 'integer(8)', which is a short form for kind parameter 8, but compilers sometimes require explicitly writing kind=8 or using selected_int_kind(18) (since 64-bit can store up to 9e18. Alternatively, the code uses kind=8 which is 64 bits.\n\nAlso, in the array allocation, we need to ensure the correct size.\n\nThe main steps seem correct, but I need to check all syntax.\n\nAnother possible issue is the deallocate(a) in the stopping points. Because, once the code hits print and stop, the array is allocated, so when exiting early, deallocation is needed (to avoid memory issues?), but Fortran might not care. But better to do it.\n\nWait in the second loop, after the print 0 and deallocate(a), but the loop may exit, so it's there. In other points like the first loop:\n\nif (lcm> m \u2192 then do print 0, deallocate and stop.\n\nSame for the second check.\n\nSo those lines are okay.\n\nNow, to make sure all variables are declared.\n\nVariables in the main block:\n\nn, m: read first.\n\na is allocatable array (size n).\n\nThe lcm variable and gcd_val (type integer(8)), and current_a? No, because in code above, current_a is not used, maybe that's an error. Looking at previous code:\n\nIn the first code lines I wrote, I had variables current_a, but in the edited code they are not present. Probably that line was a mistake. Will correct.\n\nWait in the code outline:\n\nVariables in main program:\n\nn (integer8), m ( int8), a(alloc array), lcm(int8), gcd_val (8), and result (integer8.\n\nYes, variables are declared before used.\n\nThe loops:\n\nThe first two loops for reading and for LCM calculation, and then for the second check.\n\nThus the code should work.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would be as I outlined in the code block above, with parameter types set correctly and function declared inside.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the 'contains' section comes after variable declarations, and before the executable code? Or after the variables?\n\nWait right! The contains section for internal procedures must come after variable declarations but before the executable statements.\n\nOh, right! In Fortran, once the executable code starts (i.e., the first executable line after declarations), you can not have declarations. So the code structure should be:\n\nprogram ... \n\n  implicit none\n\n  variable declarations here...\n\ncontains   (procedures)\n\n  internal functions\n\nend contain\n\nthen executable code.\n\nWait no, the contain is at the end before procedures? Let me recall.\n\nThe correct structure is:\n\nprogram whatever\n    implicit none\n    declarations\n    contains\n    subroutine or function ...\n    end function\n    ... any others ...\n    ! the codes starts here after contains?\n No, wait, the structure is: after the variable declarations, you can have the contains clause followed by the subprograms (functions, subroutines), then after that, the executable statements.\n\nSo the code must be structured so that the contains comes after all variable declarations but before any of the executable statements. Wait, so the variable declarations must come first, then the contains with the function(s), then the code.\n\nThus, in current code outline, the getgcd function is in contains, but the executable part (read, etc) comes after that.\n\nThus, the program would be written as:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc150_D\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8) :: n, m, i\n  integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  integer(8) :: lcm, gcd_val, result\n\n  containss\n    recursive function getgcd(a, b) result(res)\n    end function\n\n  end contain\n\n  read statements... and other executable code.\n\nWait no, let me write correctly.\n\nCorrect structure:\n\nprogram example \n   implicit none \n\n   integer :: a \n\n   contains \n      function f(x) \n         real :: f, x \n         f = sqrt(x) \n      end function f \n\n   end program example \n\nThus, the code is:\n\nprogram atCodercode\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8) :: n, m, i\n  integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n  integer(8) :: lcm, gcd_val\n  integer(8) :: result\n\ncontains\n\n    recursive function getgcd(a, b) result(res)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n        integer(8) :: res\n        if (b ==0 ) then\n           res = a\n        else\n           res = getgcd(b, mod(a,b))\n        end if\n    end function getgcd\n\nend contain\n\n! Now executable statements come after the contains block.\n\n  read(*, *) n, m\n  allocate(a(n))\n  do i = 1, n\n      read(*,*) a(i)\n      a(i) = a(i)/2\n  end do\n\n  ... rest of code.\n\nWait, no. Hmm, perhaps it's confused me.\n\nWait in Fortran, the contain is followed by the procedure definitions (functions, etc), and then after that you can have the main program code. Wait, no, the contain comes after variables, but before the executable code. So code outline must be:\n\nprogram ...\n\n  implicit none\n  declare variables...\n\n  contain\n    functions and others\n\n  executable code here...\n\nend program.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprogram name\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: variables, etc.\n\n    CONTAINS\n        function here.\n\n    ! Now, executable begins here:\n    read*, ... \n    ... rest of code\n....\n\nThus, the code I had before was almost correct except the order.\n\nThus, in the code outline:\n\nThe 'contains' block with the getGCD function comes after variables but before the executable statements.\n\nSo putting this all together, the program would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC150_D\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: n, m, i, lcm, gcd_val, result\n    integer(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n\n    ! Declare internal functions first via contains\n    contains\n\n    recursive function getgcd(a, b) result(res)\n        integer(8), intent(in) :: a, b\n        integer(8) :: res\n\n        if (b == 0) then\n            res = a \n        else\n            res = getgcd(b, mod(a, b))\n        end if\n    end function getgcd\n\n    ! Now the main code\n\n    ! Read n and m\n    read(*,*) n, m\n\n    allocate(a(n))\n\n    do i = 1, n\n       read(*,*) a(i)\n       a(i) = a(i) /2\n    end do\n\n    lcm = 1_8\n\n    do i=1, n\n        ! compute GCD of lcm and a(i)\n        gcd_val = getgcd(lcm, a(i))\n        lcm = lcm * a(i) / gcd_val\n\n        ! Check if exceeds m\n        if (lcm > m) then\n            print *,0 \n            deallocate(a)\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Check phase 2\n    do i =1, n\n        if (mod( lcm / a(i), 2) ==0 ) then\n            print *,0\n            deallocate(a)\n            stop\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! output\n    result = (m / lcm +1 ) /2 \n    print *, result\n\n    deallocate(a)\n    stop\n\nend program atcoder_ABC150_D\n\nA few points to check:\n\n- The initial lcm is set to 1, but with the suffix _8 to ensure it's 8 kind? Or not needed, because variables are already declared as 8. Since lcm is declared as integer(8), 1 is promoted to that. So lcm=1 is okay.\n\nWait, but sometimes initializing with assignment like,\n\nlcm = 1_8 could avoid issues.\n\nProbably better to write lcm=1_8.\n\nOther points:\n\nIn the first loop, the code uses mod(a,b). But in Fortran, mod(a,b) gives same result as in Java's % operator when a and b are positive. Since a and b are counts divided by 2 (so they are positive?), wait, the input a[i] is calculated as the original value /2, but the original inputs can be zero? Maybe the problem constraints require that a[i] is even before divided by 2, so a(i) after division is an integer.\n\nBut in code, no input checking for zero.\n\nBut assuming the problem requires the inputs to be such that a[i]/2 is integer.\n\nIn the gcd computations, since the numbers are positive.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, any possible bugs?\n\nCheck for LCM = 0. But since the a[i] are computed as (input/2). The inputs are presumably positive, since divided by 2 and stored as int. So gcd of zero might not even occur.\n\nWait if a[i] is zero. But the problem says a[i] must be even?\n\nBut if an a[i] was zero after division, then the LCM would become zero, but the first check in>Lcm*m would fail (if m is positive) but in such case, probably the problem rejects that case, but in that case, LCM divides by zero may occur. But the problem's original constraints might not allow zero.\n\nSo assuming that inputs are correct.\n\nAnother possible error is in the LCM computation when two numbers have GCD=0?\n\nNo, since Euclidean algorithm ensures that if b is non-zero, it proceeds, etc.\n\nAnother point: The code uses integer division in Fortran, which for m/lcm will be correct as per the problem's logic.\n\nNow, check the final formula (m/lcm +1)/2. \n\nIn Java, the original code uses:\n\n(m / lcd +1) / 2 \u2192 in integer division (since they are integers). For example, m=3, lcm=2: (3/2 +1) is (1+1)=2 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 1. \n\nWhich is correct (the multiples of 2 up to m are 2 \u2192 but when multiplied by 2, maybe the original problem requires counting even numbers that are multiples? Not sure, but the code logic is preserved.)\n\nSo assuming the formula is correct.\n\nThe code should be equivalent to the Java code."
