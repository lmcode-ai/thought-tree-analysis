Then the new array has to have total 3 elements, so adding the res into position3. So:\n\ntemp_arr(3) = res \n\nThus the correct code is:\n\ntemp_arr( counter ) = res \n\n Also, temp_size is set as n-1 = 4-1=3, so that's correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look through the Java code first to understand what it's doing. \n\nThe problem seems related to Codeforces problem 55B. The Java code is trying to find the minimum possible value after performing a series of operations on four numbers. The operations are either addition or multiplication, specified by the input strings \"+\" or \"*\". \n\nThe code uses a recursive approach with backtracking. The main method reads four numbers and three operations, then calls a utility function util. The util function tries all possible pairs of numbers to apply the next operation, then proceeds recursively until all operations are used. Finally, it keeps track of the minimum value from the first element after all operations.\n\nAlright. Now translating to Fortran. Let's think about the data structures first. Java's ArrayList<Long> can be translated to a fixed-size array in Fortran since the size is known (starts with 4 elements and reduces each step by 1, adding 1 each time? Wait, no. Let's think: \n\nEach time, the util function picks two elements to perform an operation. Then those two are removed, and their result is added. So the array (or list) decreases by one each step. Because starting with 4 elements, each step reduces the count by 1 (since two elements are removed and one added). The operations array is of size 3, so after three steps, the list will have 4 - 3 = 1 element. Then the min is computed based on that. \n\nHmm, but in Fortran, passing arrays around recursively can be tricky. Since Fortran doesn't have dynamic arrays in the same way, I might have to use a module with parameters, or maybe use a global array of fixed size? Or perhaps use a fixed size array with packing/unpacking.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations are up to 3 steps (since 3 operations given), the size of the temporary array won't get too big. Let's see:\n\nStep by step:\nStart with 4 elements (array length 4)\nAfter first step, array length is 3 (since choosing 2 numbers to combine, leaving 4-2 = 2 left plus the result, total 3)\nAfter second step, array length is 2\nThird step, array length is 1. Then the recursion stops.\n\nTherefore, in the recursive calls, the current array can be handled using a fixed size array of 4 elements, since the maximum required is when starting (4 elements). Then when we process, the indices can track the current size. Maybe using an array of size 4, but track current size.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe use a global array or pass an array with length. Wait, in Fortran, arrays have fixed dimensions when declared, but when passing them to functions, we can pass the current usage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the list as a one-dimensional array with a current size variable. \n\nLet me think of how the Java code works:\n\nThe main method initializes an ArrayList arr with 4 elements.\n\nThen, in the util function, it processes the current arr (which can be of size 4 initially, then 3, etc.)\n\nInside the util function, they loop over all possible i and j pairs, pick i and j, then create a new list 'a' containing all elements except those at positions i and j, then append the result of the operation.\n\nThen call util recursively with the new list and next index.\n\nThe recursion proceeds until idx reaches 3, at which point the first element is checked and the minimum is updated.\n\nIn Fortran, to emulate this process, perhaps the arrays can be copied manually each time, since the number of elements reduces each step by one. The maximum array size is 4, so a 4-element array should suffice.\n\nThe main challenge here will be handling permutations and the recursive backtracking.\n\nBut first, let's think about structures.\n\nThe main program will read the initial four numbers and the three operators, then perform the recursive function.\n\nVariables in Fortran:\n\nThe input numbers can be read into an array of size 4, of type integer (or real? Looking at the code, in Java it's long, so in Fortran maybe 64-bit integer, but Fortran doesn't have a standard 64-bit integer in older standards. But assuming we are using Fortran 90/95, we can use integer(8) if available.)\n\nWait: In the problem, the initial numbers are read via sc.nextLong(), so they can be up to Long.MAX_VALUE (Java's long is 64 bits). But in Fortran, integers can be 8 bytes if the compiler supports it. Let me assume using 8-byte integers.\n\nSo variables:\n\nIn the main program:\n\nRead four long integers (into array arr), then the 3 operator strings.\n\nThe operators can be stored as characters in an array of length 3, each being '+' or '*' (or '*' for multiplication, as per problem statement)\n\nThe min variable is a variable to keep track of the global minimal value, which starts at infinity (Java's Long.MAX_VALUE is 2^63-1). But in Fortran, can't get the maximum value directly, but can set it to a very large number.\n\nThe recursive function (similar to Java's util) will need to take the current array, current operations, and the current index. But in Fortran, you can't have variables declared in a subroutineaccessed globally as easily as in Java (Java's min is static but in Fortran variables are different).\n\nWait, in Java, the 'min' is a static variable: so in Fortran, we can either make it a global variable accessible through module or pass it around. Since we need to track the global minimum, perhaps a better approach is to pass it as an argument, but considering recursion, maybe a global variable.\n\nAlternatively, set it in a module:\n\nPerhaps better to define variables in a module and use that. Let me plan it:\n\nCreate a module that includes:\n\n- the global min (initialized to a large value, say 9223372036854775807 which is 2^63-1)\n\nThen the main program will initialize it. The recursion will reference min.\n\nHmm, yes, this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, variables in the main program can be passed through, but in function calls.\n\nAlternatively, use a recursive function.\n\nWait, perhaps in Fortran code, variables from the main program can be accessible to the recursive function, but only if they are passed properly. Let me think:\n\nAlternatively, since the java code uses static variables, in Fortran, perhaps using a module to hold the min is better.\n\nLet me structure this step by step:\n\nFirst, the Fortran code outline:\n\nmodule global_variables\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: current_min\nend module global_variables\n\nprogram main\n  use global_variables\n  implicit none\n  integer(8), dimension(4) :: arr\n  character(len=1), dimension(3) :: ops\n  integer :: i\n  ... read the input, initialize current_min to huge value ...\n  ...call the recursive function starting with the array arr, ops, and starting index 0...\nend program main\n\nThe recursive subroutine util would have to take the current array, current index.\n\nWait, but how to handle the current array and its size?\n\nWait the problem is the array is shrinking each time. Let me think: Initially, the array has 4 elements, size 4. At step one, after choosing two elements, the new array has 3 elements. When you pass into next level, the array size is 3. But to represent this, we need to track the current size as part of the data.\n\nThus, perhaps the array can be passed as a fixed size (say 4 elements maximum) and track the size.\n\nAlternatively, the routine can be written such that the current array has a certain size, and pass both.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nThe subroutine util might have parameters such as the current array, its current size, the operations array, current index (idx), and the current_min is(global or passed as an in/out parameter).\n\nWait perhaps better to pass current_min as an argument with the comma so as to modify it. Let me think:\n\nWe need the util subroutine to be able to mutate the global minimum. Alternatively, pass it by reference.\n\nAlternatively, here's the plan:\n\nStructure:\n\nModule to hold the current_min (initialized in main)\n\nMain:\n\nRead the four numbers into arr(1:4), and the three operator strings into ops(1:3) as characters of size 1.\n\nInitialize current_min to the big number (like 9223372036854775807)\n\nCall the first step of the recursion.\n\nThe subroutine util:\n\nSubroutine util (current_array, current_array_size, ops, idx)\n\nThis takes the current array, which is an array that can hold at least 4 elements or similar, but the current size is tracked by current_array_size.\n\nWait, for example, the original array has size 4, after an operation, the array will have size 3 (since two elements are replaced by one, so 4-2+1=3), and so on.\n\nSo the array size starts at 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 when the recursion ends.\n\nThus, the passed array in the subroutine can be of a fixed size (4 elements), and the current_array_size is passed as an integer. At each step, the array is only in use up to current_array_size.\n\nBut when we process the two elements (i and j), then create a new array with those two elements removed and their operation result added, which can be done by copying the elements except i and j, and appending res, then calling the subroutine again with current size decreased by one.\n\nWait maybe:\n\nInside the util function,\n\nthe parameters are current array (with actual size tracked as variable), the current_ops (the array of operations), and the current index (idx)\n\nWait in the context of the recursive steps:\n\nThe subroutine will need to know which operations are to be applied (the ops array is fixed).\n\nHence, maybe in Fortran, the ops array can be passed as an argument (since it doesn't change), or since it's global.\n\nAlternatively, to emulate the Java code, perhaps the ops array is passed as an argument.\n\nHmm.\n\nPutting this together, the steps required in each recursive call:\n\nIn the util routine:\n\nif idx == 3:\n\n   current_array has size 1 (due to starting with 4, each step reduces by 1), so check if current_array(1) is lower than current_min, if so, update current_min.\n\nElse:\n\nfor each i from 0 to current_array_size-1:\n\n   for each j from i+1 to current_array_size-1:\n\n      then create a new array of size current_array_size -1 \n\n      copy the elements, except exclude positions i and j (assuming zero-based?), and then add the result of the operation.\n\nWait actually in the Java code, the indices are zero-based? The for loops for 'i' start at 0 to arr.size(). So yes, zero-based in that code.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays are often one-based unless declared otherwise, so I need to be cautious here.\n\nProbably better to handle everything as one-based arrays in Fortran but adjust the loops accordingly. Or maybe using a zero-based approach by declaring arrays with 1:4 but using indices from 0 to 3.\n\nWait to avoid confusion, perhaps the array will be of size 4, with actual elements stored from 1 to current_size. But let's see.\n\nWait in Java, the code uses for (int i =0; i < arr.size(); ... so in the first call, when the array has size 4, i ranges 0 to 3.\n\nEach element's index is from 0 to N-1.\n\nIn Fortran, if the array is stored as 1-based, indices 1 to N. Maybe I can use 1-based arrays as that's more natural in Fortran.\n\nThus, let me plan:\n\nIn Fortran, array size is 4 (the maximum), but the current size is tracked via a variable. The elements are numbered 1 to current_size.\n\nInside the util subroutine:\n\nFor each i from 1 to current_size-1:\n\n  for each j from i+1 to current_size:\n\n    (selecting pairs)\n\nWait, since i and j need to be different indices, i must be less than j.\n\nSo loop over i from 1 to current_size -1, and j from i+1 to current_size.\n\nSo in the nested for loops.\n\nThen, when selecting the elements at i and j, compute the result of the operation ops(idx) -- which is at index idx since indices start from 0 in Java (since for the calls in Java start at idx, so in Fortran, indices may need similar management).\n\nWait, the java code's 'ops' array is of size3, indices 0,1,2. The current index is 'idx' which starts at0, and increments, stopping at 3 (like in the code: if (idx == 3) so 3 is the stop condition when done. Because when idx is 0 to 2, then when idx becomes 3, we have used all 3 operations.\n\nHence, in Fortran:\n\nthe ops array should be dimension 3 (indices 1 to 3?), or dimensions (0:2) but then passed as such.\n\nWait let's think:\n\nIn the Java code, the loop that fills 'ops' is for (i=0; i <3; i++) ops[i] = sc.next(). So indexes 0, 1, 2.\n\nHence in Fortran, the array in the main program can be a 1-based array with indices 1 to3, but when passing to the subroutine, perhaps adjust, but the operators are accessed at ops(idx). \n\nWait:\n\nAfter reading the three operators into the array in Fortran, if the array is 1-based (indexed 1 to3), then when idx in Java is from0 to2 (for the three operations), so in Fortran, the first operation is at idx 0 (the original parameter), but in Fortran's 1-based arrays, so perhaps need to adjust indices.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use 0-based for the array if possible. \n\nAlternatively, just handle it via indices:\n\nSuppose in Fortran, the ops array is stored as 1-based (indexes 1:3), then in the util subroutine, when checking the operator to use, the index is (idx+1) ? Not sure, better to be careful.\n\nWait the parameters passed to the subroutine would need to have the same indexing order.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran code, the ops array can be of 1-based indexing, with 3 elements, and the current 'idx' variable that starts at 0 and goes up to 3. Then, the index for the ops in the first three steps are idx=0 to idx=2 (using op(1) through op(3)? No, that would be off.\n\nWait, no: the first operation corresponds to the first element of the input (ops[0] in Java is first operator), so in Fortran, if the ops array is stored as 1-based, ops(1) is the first operator. So the Java code's 'idx' in 0-based (0,1,2) would correspond to Fortran's 1-based indices 1,2,3. But since the Java code's condition is when idx<3, that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we keep the ops array as 0-based (i.e, dimension (0:2)), but still, Fortran arrays are 1-based by default. To have 0-based:\n\nWe can do dimension (0:2), allocate it as a lower-bound 0 array. But in Fortran 90, arrays can be declared with any starting index.\n\nYes, for example: \n\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(0:2) :: OPS \n\nthen the indices can be 0 to2.\n\nBut in Fortran, the declaration would be:\n\ncharacter(len=*, dimension(0:2) :: ... \n\nWait, no, for an array of length 3 starting at zero, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a 1-based array but subtract 1 when needed.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, perhaps better to use 1-based and adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nSuppose in the main program:\n\nThe ops array is read into a 1:3 array. Then in util, when the current index is (say) idx starting from 0, and up to 2, the operator is ops(idx+1). Since for the first call (idx=0), that would be the first element (index1). So for the condition in the Java code, when idx is less than3 (up to2), the operator is 'ops[idx]'. So in Fortran, the operator is ops(idx+1).\n\nWait, the problem is that in the subroutine's parameters:\n\nWhen the main program calls the subroutine with idx=0 (first step, the first operator). So in the first call, the first operation is ops(1), assuming the array is 1:3. \n\nYes, that's okay. The code can be:\n\nif (idx <3) then\n\n   the operator is ops(idx+1)\n\nWait let me think:\n\nJava code:\n\n        if (idx < 3 && ops[idx].equals(\"+\")) \n\nSo the idx in Java runs from 0-2 for the first three steps, after which when idx becomes 3, it is done.\n\nIn Fortran, when idx reaches 3, it should also stop. But the ops array has three elements (indices1-3?), then the first three calls will have idx from 0 to2 (since when you pass 3 to the idx, it's time to return and check the min.\n\nThus, for the operator access in fortran:\n\nsame condition: if ( idx < 3 ) then \n\n   ope = ops(idx +1 )\n\nWait, because in the first call, idx is0 (argument passed from main), so ops(1) is the first operator, which matches the Java's ops[0]? \n\nNo, that shows an issue.\n\nWait sorry, the input is for the three operators in order. Suppose in Java:\n\nops[0] is first operator, ops[1] second, etc.\n\nIn file input, user enters three tokens, the first becomes ops[0], second ops[1], third ops[2].\n\nIn Fortran, when reading, assuming the input is read into ops(1), ops(2), ops(3) (1-based):\n\nSo the first operator (Java's ops[0]) is Fortran's ops(1).\n\nHence the index in the recursive function must take into account that in Fortran the operators are stored in positions 1-3 for the 3 elements.\n\nThus in the fortran code, the index idx can be from 0 to 2 (the first three steps):\n\nThus, the operator being used at step 'idx' (starting from 0) would be ops(idx+1). \n\nThus in fortran code's \"util\" function, when we want to check whether to add or multiply, we do:\n\nthe current operator is ops( idx+1 )\n\nSo if (idx <3 ) then:\n\n   op = ops( idx +1 )\n\nThus.\n\nNow, moving back to the code's logic:\n\nInside the util subroutine, for each pair (i, j) in the current array (indices 1 to current_size):\n\ncreate a new array (new_arr) of size current_size -1 (since 2 elements are removed, and one added, so one less in total).\n\nThe new array first includes all elements except positions i and j. Since in Fortran arrays, we can't shrink, perhaps best to create a temporary array of the same size as the original (to avoid reallocations sort of) but only use the necessary elements.\n\nThus, the steps to build new_arr:\n\nThe new array has size current_size -1.\n\nTo create it, we loop through the elements of the current array, and exclude i and j:\n\nallocate a new array (maybe another array of same size as original 4), then copy each element except those at i and j.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, allocations within a subroutine can be problematic. Since the array is small, perhaps the arr can be of a fixed size, say 4 elements. Then, in the recursive step:\n\ncurrent array is of maximum 4 elements:\n\nThus, the current array passed to the subroutine is an array with size 4 but only using the first 'current_size' elements.\n\nWhen we need to generate new_arr:\n\nWe can create a temporary array (also size4), with current_size -1 elements.\n\nThe characters would be:\n\nfor k =1 to current_size:\n\n   if k is not i or j, then add to the new array.\n\nWait the code in Java is:\n\nfor (int k =0; k < arr.size(); k++) {\n\n    if (k !=i && k !=j) {\n\n        a.add( arr.get(k) );\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nso in Fortran, for the current array (1-based, from 1 to current_size):\n\nnew array elements are all elements except from indices i,j.\n\nThus:\n\nnew_array\ttemp is the new array of length current_size minus 1.\n\nAvoid i and j.\n\nthe new array is constructed by:\n\nnew_size = current_size -1\n\nnew_arr = 0 (initialized?) but in code, we can loop through elements:\n\ncounter = 1\n\ndo k=1, current_size:\n\n   if (k /=i .and. k /=j ) then\n\n       new_arr(counter) = current_array(k)\n\n       counter = counter +1\n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nthen add the result at the end.\n\nThus:\n\nAfter building the new array (size current_size-1), place the result (res) at position new_size.\n\nnew_arr(new_size) = res \n\nThen, the new array will have the old elements (excluding i,j) plus the result.\n\nThen, the recursive call is made with this new array, but only up to new_size (current_size -1).\n\nSo in the routine parameters, maybe the current array is a one-dimensional array, and the current_size is an integer.\n\nSo perhaps in the subroutine signature:\n\nrecursive subroutine util(arr, n, ops, idx) \n\n    integer(8), dimension(*) :: arr\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: n\n\n    character(len=1), dimension(3), intent(in) :: ops\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: idx \n\nBut need also to reference the current_min variable (the global minimum). Since it's a module variable, can be accessed.\n\nThen, inside the subroutine, when the base case is hit (idx ==3), then the remaining array has only one element (n=1), so the value is arr(1). \n\nTherefore, in that case, current_min is set to min(current_min, arr(1) )\n\nElse, for the recursive steps:\n\nLoop over all i and j pairs. \n\nFirst, outer loop for i from 1 to n-1, j from i+1 to n.\n\nSo double loops:\n\ndo i=1, n-1 \n\n   do j=i+1, n \n\n       ... process these two indices...\n\nThus.\n\nInside the loops, compute the result:\n\nif (idx <3 and ops( idx+1 ) == '+') then\n\n    res = arr(i) + arr(j) \n\nelse \n\n    res = arr(i)*arr(j) \n\nthen construct the new array as explained before.\n\nThen, call util with the new array (only the first new_size elements need be passed), new_size =n-1, the same ops, and idx+1.\n\nWait the problem here is that in Fortran, arrays are passed by reference, but when building the new array locally, perhaps the subroutine can receive a temporary array. So by creating a temporary array in the current function, passing it to the recursive call.\n\nThus, in code terms:\n\nallocate a new array?\n\nWait no, perhaps in the loop, for each possible i, j pair:\n\ncreate a new array (temp_arr, say), of size 4, but filled for the new elements.\n\nThe process:\n\nIn the inner loop over i and j:\n\ncompute the res.\n\nthen, create the new array temp_arr with the elements excluding i and j.\n\nLoop as follows:\n\ntemp_size =n -1 \n\ntemp_arr(1 to temp_size )\n\ninitialize counter to 1 \n\nloop over the original elements of arr up to n elements:\n\nfor each k from 1 to n:\n\n   if k is not i or j then:\n\n        temp_arr(counter) =arr(k)\n\n        counter +=1 \n\nend loop\n\nthen, add the result:\n\ntemp_arr(temp_size) = res \n\nThen, call util( temp_arr, temp_size, ops, idx+1 ) \n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut since the array can be of fixed length, say 4 elements (since maximum size is 4 initially), we can pre-declare it as a fixed array. So inside the do loops, temp_arr can be a local array inside the subroutine, of size4:\n\ndimension: temp_arr(4) \n\nThen assign the first (n-1) elements after the loop, and add the res as the (n-1)th element?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose current_size is n, new_size is n-1.\n\nWe need to make the new array with n-1 elements.\n\nThus, after the loop, we have filled temp_arr up to counter-1 (initially counter starts at 1, so after processing the exclusion, we have counter-1 elements?), no.\n\nWait counter starts at1, then for each element not excluded, counter increases by1. \n\nSo the final counter is the new_size +1 ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose current array has n elements. After excluding two elements (i and j), so there are n-2 elements not excluded (since those two are removed). So those are copied into the new array's elements 1.. (n-2), and then we add res as element (n-1). \n\nWait total new elements is (n-2) +1 = n-1. \n\nSo the temp_arr is size 4 (since initially, n can be up to 4).\n\nThus, the code for building the temp array:\n\ninteger :: temp_size = n -1 \n\ninteger(8), dimension(4) :: temp_arr \n\ninteger :: counter =1 \n\ndo k=1, n\n\n   if( k /=i .and. k /=j ) then \n\n       temp_arr(counter) = arr(k)\n\n       counter = counter +1 \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\n! now add the result \n\ntemp_arr(temp_size) = res \n\nthen call util with temp_arr and temp_size.\n\nWait wait, temp_size is n-1. The previous elements are filled from 1 to (counter-1). but (counter-1) = (n-2) of the non-excluded elements, since \n\ninitial counter is 1, and for each element not i or j (there are n-2 elements), counter goes from 1 to (n-2 +1)=n-1.\n\nWait n elements total, subtract two => so n-2 elements. Thus, after the first do loop, counter is n-1, so temp_arr(1:counter-1) ? Not exactly: temp is filled up to counter-1. Let me see:\n\nLet me walk through an example:\n\nn was 4, which implies processing in the first step.\n\nTake n=4, i=1, j=2 (indices 1 and 2). \n\nThe first loop over the original elements (1 to4):\n\nfor k=1: excluded (i=1). \n\nk=2: excluded (j=2).\n\nk=3: not excluded \u2192 temp_arr(1) = arr(3) \u2192 counter=2.\n\nk=4 \u2192 added \u2192 temp_arr (2) = arr(4). counter becomes 3.\n\nThus, after that, the counter is 3 (n-1 =4-1=3), so the first elements are 1 to 2 filled (since counter goes to 3?) Wait, no. After the loop, the elements 1 to counter-1 (3-1=2?), or counter is 3, so the array has had two elements added (3 and4). So the indexes 1 and2 have been filled. So the temp array has elements from 1 to 2 (from the k=3 and4).\n\nThen we add the res to temp_arr(3) (since temp_size is3). \n\nSo the final temp array has first two elements from k=3 and4, and third element the result. Which is the desired new array after combining elements 1 and2 into result.\n\nThus the code is okay.\n\nTherefore, with this approach, the code should work.\n\nSo the subroutines all have a predeclared array of size4 as their parameters. The size is passed via the 'temp_size' variable.\n\nNow putting all together:\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nModule for current_min.\n\nmodule MinTracker\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: current_min = huge(current_min)\nend module MinTracker\n\nThe main program:\n\nprogram main\n    use MinTracker\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: arr(4)\n    character(len=1) :: ops(3)\n    integer :: i\n    ! Read input\n    read(*, *) (arr(i), i =1,4)\n    read(*, *) (ops(i), i=1,3)\n    ! Initialize current_min\n    current_min = huge(current_min)  ! which gives the maximum value for 8-byte integer\n    ! Call recursive function\n    call util(arr,4, ops,0)\n    ! Output the result\n    print*, current_min\nend program main\n\nHmm, but wait, in the read, do we need to read the three operators as characters?\n\nYes, assuming each character is a single character. But let's see the read format:\n\nThe second read is for the three operators as a string. For example, input like \" + * + \" so the three are the next three tokens.\n\nIn Fortran, you can read this with something like:\n\nread(*, *) (ops(k),k=1,3)\n\nassuming they are each in their own column.\n\nBut, if the input is given as a single line, like something like 1 2 3 4 * + * (example input), then the first read is four integers, then the next read is three characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using list-directed input:\n\nThe code:\n\nread(*,*) arr(1),arr(2),arr(3),arr(4)\n\nread(*,*) (ops(i), i=1,3)\n\nBut the user must input 3 characters (each for the operators; like ' ' to space, but it might be read from the next entries). \n\nThis is important to test, but proceeding.\n\nNow, the util function:\n\nrecursive subroutine util(arr, n, ops, idx)\n\n    use MinTracker\n    implicit none \n\n    integer(8),intent(in) :: arr(4) ! the current array, up to n elements\n    integer, intent(in) :: n ! current array length from 1 to n\n    character(len=1), dimension(3), intent(in) :: ops\n    integer, intent(in) :: idx\n    integer(8) :: temp_arr(4) ! temporary array to hold new array\n    integer :: temp_n  ! the new array size: n-1\n    integer :: res,i,j,k,counter\n    integer :: temp_size \n\n    if (idx ==3) then \n        ! base case: n should be 1 then\n        current_min = min(current_min, arr(1))\n        return\n    end if \n\n    ! perform all possible pairs \n    do i=1, n-1\n        do j = i+1, n\n            ! choose to combine i and j using the next operator\n            temp_size = n-1\n            temp_arr = 0 ! Initialize array maybe not necessary?\n\n            counter = 1 \n            do k=1, n\n                if (k /=i .and. k /=j) then \n                    temp_arr(counter) = arr(k)\n                    counter = counter +1\n                end if\n            end do \n\n            ! compute the operation\n            if (idx <3 .and. ops(idx+1) == \"+\") then \n                res = arr(i)+arr(j)\n            else\n                res = arr(i)*arr(j)\n            end if \n\n            temp_arr(counter-1) = res  ! because counter is now counter= (number of remaining elements) +1 \u2192 the missing spot is where to place res?\n\nWait here is an error! Let me think after the loop, the counter is (number of elements not selected) +1. \n\nWait in the loop over k:\n\nthe initial counter is 1. \n\nFor each k not excluded, we add it, and counter increases.\n\nThus, after processing all k from1 to n, the counter is (number of elements in temp_arr so far) +1 \u2192 to get number of elements in the include elements, it's 'counter -1' (since not counting the last increment after adding each element). \n\nThus, the elements in the temp_arr up to (counter-1). \n\nThus the res has to be put in the next position (counter).\n\nSo, wait in code above:\n\nWe have after the k loop, the array has counter-1 elements (not including the increment at the last addition).\n\nWait let's think with the previous example of n=4, i=1, j=2.\n\nAfter the loop for the two excluded elements (1 and2), the remaining elements (k=3 and4) are copied to positions 1 and 2 (since counter started at 1, then became 2, then 3. After loop, counter is 3. Thus:\n\ntemp_arr(1) is arr(3), temp_arr(2) is arr(4).\n\ncounter is3.\n\nso the number of elements in the first part is 2 (since counter is3, elements 1 and2). \n\nWe need to add the result to the third position (temp \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440 l\u00e0 3 elements n\u00ean v\u1ecb tr\u00ed cu\u1ed1i l\u00e0 3. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ntemp_arr( counter-1+1) = res \u2192\n\ntemp_arr( counter ) ?\n\nWait, the first elements are filling up to (counter-1). The next element is at position (counter). \n\nHence:\n\ntemp_arr(counter) = res \n\nthen the resulting array has size counter, but temp_size is n-1.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\noriginal n =4, new size should be 3. \n\ncounter after loop is3 (since 2 elements stored in 1 and2, so counter is 3. Then the new array has to have total 3 elements, so adding the res into position3.\n\nSo:\n\ntemp_arr(3) = res \n\nThus the correct code is:\n\ntemp_arr( counter ) = res \n\n Also, temp_size is set as n-1 = 4-1=3, so that's correct.\n\nNext code:\n\ntemp_size = n -1 \n\ntemp_arr(counter) = res \n\nThen call util with the new array (temp_arr(1:temp_size)), but how to pass it to the recursive function.\n\nThe subroutine takes 'arr' as an array of 4, since the parameter is arr(4).\n\nSo when we call the subroutine:\n\ncall util( temp_arr, temp_size, ops, idx+1 )\n\nBut temp_arr is of size 4 in the subroutine.\n\nThus the parameters are okay because the remaining elements are in the first temp_size entries.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\n            temp_arr(counter) = res \n\n            ! now, call with the new array \n            call util( temp_arr , temp_size, ops, idx+1 )\n\n        end do ! j loop\n    end do !i loop\n\n    return \nend subroutine util\n\nWait that's the code. \n\nWait in code:\n\n     temp_size = n-1 \n\n     do loops...\n\nthen after:\n\n            call util( temp_arr, temp_size, ops, idx+1 )\n\nYes.\n\nPutting this all together.\n\nPutting together all the pieces:\n\nNow checking some details.\n\nInitialization of the module variable current_min to a very large value.\n\nIn Fortran, to get the huge value of an integer. \n\ninteger(8) :: current_min \n\nThe initial assignment can be done via 'current_min = huge(current_min)'\n\nSo in the MinTracker module initialization:\n\nHuge is a Fortran function (intrinsic) that gives the largest integer of that kind.\n\nHence that should work.\n\nNow, the read statements in the main program:\n\nThe first read reads 4 integers into arr(1) to arr(4).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array is 4 elements, so the loop to read can be written as:\n\nread(*,*) (arr(i), i=1,4)\n\nBut perhaps using list-directed:\n\nread*, arr(1), arr(2), arr(3), arr(4)\n\nEither way.\n\nThe second read is for the three operators. Each is a character in a 1-length array. So the input would have, after the first line with 4 numbers, the next line must have three characters, each being '+' or '*'.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput: \n\n1 2 3 4\n\n+ * *\n\nThat would work.\n\nWait but when you read, the next line has three characters, so using:\n\nread *, (ops(i), i=1,3)\n\nshould read the next set of three characters.\n\nAlternatively, possible that reading them as strings with a single character each.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the characters might be read with spaces, but in Fortran list directed input, spaces separate items. So if the ops are provided as three characters (e.g., + * -) then each is a separate item.\n\nSo that code should work.\n\nNow, the base case:\n\nIf (idx ==3) then check if current array (of size1) so minimum is the value.\n\nThus correct.\n\nNow, in the code, what if the operator at steps beyond3? No, because the check in the condition.\n\nNow the fortran code should be:\n\nBut need to ensure the module is use'd in the subroutine.\n\nThus, the complete code is as follows.\n\nNote: Final code in Fortran should include the module, the program and the subroutine.\n\nAlso, the function should be declared as recursive.\n\nThus, here's the plan for the final code:\n\nThe code structure:\n\nmodule MinTracker\n  implicit none\ncontains\n  integer(8) :: current_min\nend module MinTracker\n\nWait no, a module can't have a contained variable without a containing type (unless using Fortran 2003 modules). Actually, to define a global variable accessible to the program and the subroutine.\n\nIn modules, variables declared at the top are module variables.\n\nThus, the module can be written as:\n\nmodule global_vars\nimplicit none\ninteger(8) :: current_min\nend module global_vars\n\nThen, in the main program and the subroutine, use global_vars.\n\nSo the module definition:\n\nmodule global_vars\nimplicit none\ninteger(8) :: current_min = huge(current_min)\nend module global_vars\n\nWait yes. We can even initialize it right there.\n\nWait in Fortran, initial declarations must be constants or parameterizable. So assigning the huge value may not be allowed directly. \n\nAh, right. Because `huge(current_min)` is a function that can't be used in a module's variable initialization.\n\nThus, the solution is to initialize it in the main program.\n\nSo in the module, the variable is declared without initial value:\n\nmodule global_vars\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: current_min\n    contains\n    ! if needed \nend module global_vars\n\nThen, in the program:\n\nuse global_vars, then in main program:\n\n    current_min = huge(current_min)\n\nThus, that's okay.\n\nTherefore the corrected module is:\n\nmodule global_vars\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: current_min\nend module global_vars\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nFull Fortran code:\n\nHere's the code:\n\nmodule global_vars\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: current_min\ncontains\nend module global_vars\n\nrecursive subroutine util(arr, n, ops, idx)\n  use global_vars\n  implicit none\n  integer(8), intent(in) :: arr(4)\n  integer, intent(in) :: n\n  character(len=1), dimension(3), intent(in) :: ops\n  integer, intent(in) :: idx\n  integer(8) :: temp_arr(4)\n  integer :: temp_size, i, j, k, counter\n  integer(8) :: res\n\n  if (idx == 3) then\n    current_min = min(current_min, arr(1))\n    return\n  end if\n\n  do i = 1, n -1\n    do j = i +1, n\n      temp_size = n -1\n      temp_arr = 0  ! Initialize to zeros, but not necessary?\n      counter = 1\n\n      do k = 1, n\n        if (k /= i .and. k /=j) then \n          temp_arr(counter) = arr(k)\n          counter = counter +1\n        end if\n      end do\n\n      if (idx <3 .and. ops(idx + 1) == '+') then\n        res = arr(i) + arr(j)\n      else\n        res = arr(i) * arr(j)\n      end if\n\n      temp_arr(counter) = res\n\n      call util(temp_arr, temp_size, ops, idx+1)\n    end do\n  end do\n\n  return\nend subroutine util\n\nprogram main\n  use global_vars\n  implicit none\n  integer(8) :: arr(4)\n  character(len=1) :: ops(3)\n  integer :: i\n\n  read(*, *, iostat=ios) (arr(i), i =1,4)\n  read(*, *, iostat=ios) (ops(i), i=1,3)\n\n  current_min = huge(current_min)\n\n  call util(arr,4, ops, 0)\n\n  print*, current_min\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but I realize I missed including 'use global_vars' in the subroutine 'util' (edited now).\n\nAlso, in the subroutine parameters for the call to util, the first call in program main should be with the array arr (size4), n=4, ops, idx=0.\n\nYes.\n\nWait some possible errors:\n\nIn the code above, the temp_arr should be declared with dimension4, which is fine.\n\nThe counter can go up to n-1, but ensuring:\n\nAfter the loop over k from 1 to n, the counter reaches (number of retained elements) +1. So the last index is counter is the correct.\n\nBut perhaps the temp is initialized with 0 or not?\n\nThe initial values of temp_arr are undefined, but in the loop, all elements of temp_arr that are used are set.\n\nWait:\n\nIn Fortran, if you have an array declared with memory, and you don't initialize it, the elements may have garbage, so when you fill the positions 1 to counter=..., but the rest are kept as garbage.\n\nSince the new array's first 'temp_size' elements are important, but since the subroutine's next call will only use the first temp_size elements.\n\nSo for those elements not used (beyond temp_size), it's not a problem.\n\nThus, it's okay.\n\nAnother point: when we call the subroutine util, the first parameter is temp_arr, which is an array(4) in the current scope. Since fortran passes by reference (or by descriptors), so when the function is called, the array's first 4 elements are passed, but the called function gets an array only up to the first 'n' elements (temp_size).\n\nThis should be okay, since the subroutine only uses the first 'temp_size' elements (since it checks n, then the calls with temp_size = n-1 etc.)\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSuppose the input is something like :\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n* + *\n\nThis problem from the original problem (Codeforces 55B, which iscn 2015 problem).\n\nThe java code should work. The analogous Fortran code needs to process it correctly.\n\nThe sample's expected output is 3.\n\nIn Java code, the correct min would be 3.\n\nIn the Fortran code, we have to see.\n\nPerhaps the code can work.\n\nAnother thing to note is that variables in the util subroutine are properly allocated.\n\nConclusion: I think the code above is correct. However, perhaps the Fortran syntax needs some corrections.\n\nChecking the 'implicit none' in all programs and subroutines, which is good.\n\nAnother possible issue is in the recursion: the temp_arr must be passed correctly.\n\nThe code should work as intended. I think this is a solid translation."
