Wait the code adds the days of each iteration's year, so for each i starting at y+1, the first iteration's i is the target year? Let me see.

Maybe the problem requires that the total days since the original year until the new year's end, but the code is accumulating each year's days until sum mod7 ==0 and then returning that i. So that when the total days up to i (including it) mod7 is zero, then that's the year. But the leap condition is compared between the original y and the current i's status. Hmm.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm. Alright, let me start by understanding what the Java code does first. \n\nThe code is for a problem where we start from a given year y and need to find the next year such that the total number of days passed since the start has a remainder of 0 when divided by 7. Wait, actually looking at the code more carefully, it's a bit different. The loop increments each year, adding 365 or 366 days depending on whether that year is a leap year, then checks if the cumulative sum mod 7 is zero. Additionally, there's a condition involving whether both years are leap or not. Wait, let's look at the code lines again.\n\nThe code starts with a given y. Then, in the loop, for each i starting at y+1 onward:\n\n- Add 366 if leap, else 365 to sum.\n- If sum mod7 ==0:\n   - Check if (either both leap years or both not leap). Wait, the condition is ((check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap)). So, the leap status between the current starting year and the i?\n\nWait, the variable 'leap' is whether the starting year y was a leap year. So after adding each year's days, when the sum mod7 is zero, the code checks if the leap status of the current year (i) is the same as the original year's leap status. Wait, why? Let me think. Perhaps the problem requires that the new year must have the same leapiness as the original y? Or maybe it's part of the problem's condition.\n\nLooking back, in the original Java code, it seems that after calculating the sum mod7 is zero, it also requires the leap status of the two years to be the same. That is, if the starting year was a leap, the next should also be leap, else if original wasn't, then new must not be?\n\nWait the condition in the code is ( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) ). So, that's equivalent to (check_leap(i) == leap). Because if leap is true, check_leap(i) must be true, or if leap is false, it must be false. So the condition checks whether the current i is also a leap year as the original y was. But why?\n\nMaybe this is for the problem's specific conditions. The problem statement probably requires that the next year has the same leap status as the starting year, so that the day progression can loop back to the same day of the week? Hmm, perhaps the problem requires that the next year must 'match' the leap status of the starting year so that the cumulative days modulo 7 equals zero. Well, I have to stick with the code here anyway.\n\nNow moving on to translating the code to Fortran. Let's note the structure. The main function reads a year y, initializes variables leap, sum, mod. Then loops from y+1 upwards, each iteration checks leap status of current i, adds to sum, checks sum mod7. When it satisfies mod7 0 and the leap condition between i and y, then output i and return.\n\nThe check_leap function is a helper that returns true if leap year.\n\nIn Fortran, subroutines and functions have to be placed appropriately. Since this is a program, in Fortran, we can write it as a program, perhaps with a main block. But the check_leap function can be a function inside the program (since Fortran allows internal functions in some versions like Fortran 90/95 or later).\n\nBut let's think about the variables and code.\n\nFirst, the leap variable in Java is initialized to check_leap(y). So in Fortran, similar processing needed.\n\nThe loop is an infinite loop, breaking once a condition is met, using 'return;'. In Java, the return exits the main method. In Fortran, we can use 'exit' statements or a loop control structure.\n\nBut Fortran doesn't have a 'for' loop like Java's, but uses DO loops. Alternatively, a DO loop with labels? Wait, but since it's an infinite loop, in Fortran, perhaps a DO loop where the loop condition is not fixed, but we can have a loop that continues until a return is found. Let me think.\n\nHmm. The Java's loop starts at y+1 and increments by 1 each time. Since it's infinite, but in Fortran, perhaps we can write a DO loop that keeps going until we exit via a RETURN. Alternatively, a endless loop with DO while(true). But syntax?\n\nAlternatively, using a label like DO 100, and a GOTO jump when the condition is found. Maybe that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, use a DO loop with a dummy variable and an IF to check to exit.\n\nWait, let's try to structure the code.\n\nThe main parts:\n\n1. Read the input y.\n\nIn Fortran, using a read statement: read(*,*) y\n\n2. Compute leap = check_leap(y). The check_leap is a function we need to code.\n\n3. Initialize sum and mod variables. Well, in the Java code, there's 'sum' and 'mod' variables, but in the code, the mod is not stored; instead, each iteration checks if (sum %7 ==0). Perhaps 'mod' in the code is a typo? Wait, in the code, the variable 'mod' is initialized to 0, but in the loop, it doesn't get used. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait the code:\n\nThe code in Java uses: if (sum %7 ==0). The 'mod' variable was created as an int initialized to 0 but never used. So that is a mistake. Wait, the original code has:\n\nWait the problem may have had a typo. Let me check the Java code provided again.\n\nThe user provided code:\n\nThe code has sum initialized to 0, and mod initialized to 0; however, the mod variable is not used except in declaration. So the line \"int mod =0;\" must be a mistake. The rest uses sum %7 ==0.\n\nTherefore, in fortran, I can ignore that variable and just calculate sum modulo 7 in the condition.\n\nSo, when translating, we can ignore the 'mod' var, and proceed with the sum%7 ==0 check.\n\nNow.\n\nNow, starting the code.\n\nThe Fortran code structure would be as follows:\n\nProbably:\n\nprogram codeforces_678_B\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: y, i, sum\n    logical :: leap\n    logical :: check_leap\n\n    read(*,*) y\n    leap = check_leap(y)\n    sum = 0\n    i = y+1\n\n    ! loop starts here\n    do\n        if (check_leap(i)) then\n            sum = sum + 366\n        else\n            sum = sum + 365\n        end if\n\n        if (mod(sum,7) ==0) then\n            if ( (check_leap(i) .eqv. leap) ) then\n                write(*,*) i\n                exit\n            end if\n        end if\n        i = i +1\n    end do\n\n    end program\n\nFunction check_leap:\n\nWe can write check_leap as a function.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, functions declared in the program need to be written after the main code, or as in Fortran90, an internal function.\n\nWait, in the code above, after defining variables, but better to write the function after.\n\nAlternatively, code:\n\nFirst, the check_leap function. Let me write it.\n\nThe function:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    logical :: is_leap\n    is_leap = (mod(y,400) ==0) .or. (mod(y,4)==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0)\n    check_leap = is_leap\n    return\nend function check_leap\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables in function must be compatible.\n\nWait in Fortran, the function's name can be used as the return variable, so we can write the function directly:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    check_leap = (mod(y,400) ==0) .or. (mod(y,4) ==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0)\n    ! No return instruction needed. Oh, but in compilers, perhaps better to have return?\n\nWait in Fortran, when you assign to the function name variable, then the implicit return would be sufficient. So the above is okay.\n\nPutting together:\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe program would have the function declared, then the main.\n\nHowever, in Fortran, functions can be placed after the main program, if declared as external. Or, in Fortran90, we can have internal functions inside the program.\n\nWait, in fortran90, you can have the function inside the program.\n\nWait, the program would be something like:\n\nprogram codeforces_678_B\n    implicit none\n    logical function check_leap(y)\n        implicit none\n        integer, intent(in) :: y\n        check_leap = mod(y,400) ==0 .or. (mod(y,4) ==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0)\n    end function check_leap\n\n    integer :: y, i, sum\n    logical :: leap\n\n    read(*,*) y\n    leap = check_leap(y)\n    sum =0\n    i = y+1\n    do\n        if (check_leap(i)) then\n            sum = sum + 366\n        else\n            sum = sum +365\n        end if\n        if (mod(sum,7) == 0) then\n            if (check_leap(i) .eqv. leap ) then\n                write(*,*) i\n                exit\n            end if\n        end if\n        i = i+1\n        \n    end do\nend program\n\nWait, but inFortran, the function must be declared in the correct scoping. Alternatively, putting the function check_leap outside the program.\n\nWait perhaps better to have the function defined outside, making sure it can be called.\n\nWait, here's the correct structure:\n\nAlternatively, write the function outside the program, so that it can be seen.\n\nSo:\n\nlogical function check_leap(y)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: y\n    check_leap=(mod(y,400)==0 .or. (mod(y,4)==0 .and. mod(y,100)/=0))\nend function\n\nprogram codeforces_678_B\n    implicit none\n    integer y, i, sum\n    logical leap\n\n    read(*,*) y\n    leap = check_leap(y)\n    sum =0\n    i = y +1\n\n    do\n        if (check_leap(i)) then\n            sum = sum+366\n        else\n            sum = sum+365\n        end if\n        if (mod(sum,7) ==0) then\n            if ( (check_leap(i) .eqv. leap) ) then\n                write(*,*) i\n                exit\n            end if\n        end if\n        i=i+1\n    end do\nend program\n\nWait that might work, but let me check.\n\nWait the function is declared before the program. But in Fortran, the main program must be terminated properly. Also, the functions have to be placed correctly. In free-form Fortran (with the 90 standard), functions can be included in modules, but here perhaps simpler to just put the function before the program.\n\nWait in most Fortran compilers, the order is allowed as long as the function is visible. So if the function is before the program, it's okay.\n\nNow, but in my first write-up, I tried putting the function's definition inside the program, but maybe that's not allowed here.\n\nWait, in Fortran90, an internal function (i.e., defined within the program) can be done like this:\n\nprogram ...\nimplicit none\n      integer y, ...\n    CONTAINS\n      pure function check_leap(y) result( is_leap )\n          integer, intent(in) :: y\n          logical is_leap\n          is_leap = ... etc.\n      end function\n    END program ...\n\nAh right! So to make this work, the CONTAINS block can have the function.\n\nHmm. So the better approach is:\n\nprogram codeforces_678_B\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: y, i, sum\n    logical :: leap\n\n    read*, y\n    leap = check_leap(y)\n    sum =0\n    i = y +1\n\n    do\n        if (check_leap(i)) then\n            sum = sum+366\n        else\n            sum = sum +365\n        end if\n\n        if (mod(sum,7) ==0) then\n            if ( check_leap(i) .eqv. leap ) then\n                write(*,*) i\n                exit\n            end if\n        end if\n        i = i+1\n    end do\n\ncontains\n\n    logical function check_leap(year)\n        integer, intent(in) :: year\n        check_leap = mod(year,400) ==0 .or. (mod(year,4)==0 .and. mod(year,100) /=0 )\n    end function check_leap\n\nend program\n\nThis way, the function check_leap is contained within the program, and can be used there.\n\nYes, this is better. Since the function is within the contains block, then that's allowed in Fortran90.\n\nNow, checking each part:\n\nIn the original code, the check_leap function is static in Java. Here in the Fortran code, check_leap is a contained function, so that's fine.\n\nChecking the variables: y is read, then initialized. Sum starts at 0, loops adding daily counts.\n\nWait, in the Java code, for each i (the next year), i starts at y+1. For each iteration:\n\nFirst compute if check_leap(i), then add 366 or 365 to sum.\n\nWait, in the Java code, sum is cumulative for all years since y+1. Because for each i beyond y, you're adding the total days of each previous year. Wait, no. Wait the loop starts at i = y+1 and each i corresponds to adding the days of the year i. So, the first iteration adds the days of i = y+1, so sum is 365 or 366.\n\nThen, the condition is sum mod7 ==0, and the leap condition between the original leap status and the current i (the new year).\n\nBecause the problem wants to find the next year where the total days passed since the starting year's next year would form a multiple of 7 days?\n\nAlternatively, the logic may be that after starting at y+1, the cumulative days from those years must exceed to when mod7 ==0 and the leap status is same.\n\nHmm. As in, perhaps the days after starting from y until the next year, so the days from y to i, but the code counts starting from y+1. But according to the code.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is looking for the next year such that the total days (summing all full years from y+1 to i-1?) summed up to reach a multiple of 7 and the leap years from the initial and the new years agree.\n\nWait the code adds the days of each iteration's year, so for each i starting at y+1, the first iteration's i is the target year? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nFor example, the initial variables are set as:\n\nAfter initializing variables, for the first pass, i = y+1. The code adds the days of the first year (i), then checks the mod 7 condition. Then if that meets the criteria, it writes i and exits. So 'i' is the candidate year.\n\nBut the problem is to find the next year i after y such that the number of days from y+1 to i-1 plus i's days up to some day?\n\nMaybe the problem requires that the total days since the original year until the new year's end, but the code is accumulating each year's days until sum mod7 ==0 and then returning that i. So that when the total days up to i (including it) mod7 is zero, then that's the year. But the leap condition is compared between the original y and the current i's status.\n\nHmm. The code's logic seems to check every i incrementally, adding i's day count. So maybe the total for i years until the sum mod7 is 0. But perhaps the Java code is designed this way.\n\nAnyway, I need to stick to translating the code as is.\n\nNow, looking at the Fortran code I proposed above.\n\nWait in Fortran, when writing <=0, the mod function: in fortran, mod(a,b) gives the remainder, but the sign depends on the first argument. So mod(sum, 7) remains as is, so equivalence to Java mod. Therefore correct.\n\nNow checking the logical condition:\n\nIn Java condition:\n\n( (check_leap(i) && leap) || (!check_leap(i) && !leap) )\n\nWhich is equivalent to ( check_leap(i) == leap )\n\nIn Fortran: ( check_leap(i) .eqv. leap )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing with an example to see if the code works, but we can proceed.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nIf y is a leap year: check_leap(i) must be true.\n\nOtherwise, the current i must also be a non-leap year.\n\nWait in the problem's condition, perhaps.\n\nSo, the code should work as per the Java original.\n\nNow, Fortran's infinite loop: the do loop keeps going until the exit statement is hit. Correct.\n\nVariables:\n\nThe variables y, i, sum are integers. The leap is a logical variable. The function's return is logical.\n\nThe read statement is correct with implicit format, using read(*,*) \n\nThe loop increments i each time.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, potential issues:\n\nIn Fortran, the function name check_leap is called with (i). The function takes an integer parameter.\n\nYes, the function's declaration says:\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: year\n\nThen, when called with check_leap(i), that's correct, since the argument is an integer.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible mistake is in the loop's logic. The first iteration is i = y+1, which is correct. The loop adds the days of that year, then checks the conditions.\n\nYes.\n\nThe write statement then outputs that i and exits the program.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should be correct.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would look like the code I wrote above."
