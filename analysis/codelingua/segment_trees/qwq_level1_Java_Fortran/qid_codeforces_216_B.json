But the code during processing edges takes x and y, which might be up to m? Wait in the code:\n\n\"ft.graph.get(x).add(y); ft.graph.get(y).add(x);\" so if x can be up to m then the array must go to m.\n\nWait the problem statement likely treats node numbers from 1 up to m. Because in the problem code, the main program's for loop is for i from 1 to m, so maybe the nodes are supposed to be numbered from 1 to m. But in Java code, the graph array was initialized as 0 up to m, which is m+1 elements. Hmm. Wait that's a crucial point. So the Java graph has size m+1, so nodes 0 to m.",

But perhaps the problem requires that the resulting tree has an even number of edges, which is (m-1), so m-1 must be even. For m=1: the required edges would be 0 (even?), but 0 is even, so it's okay. Thus the minimal edge to remove is 0 (already fine). But according to the code, the output is 1, suggesting that the code has a bug. Wait for the code's first phase:\n\n for components without cycles (since it's a forest):\n\n the dfs returns path (0), and the count of edges is edges in component. in case of m=1 \u2192 count is 0 (edges). so the code's first loop adds nothing to toremove (since mod(count,2) is 0 \u2192 no.\n\n then m - toremove \u21921-0=1 (odd). thus code's final logic increases toremove by 1 \u2192 total to_remove is1.\n\n but the correct output would be 0, because the tree has 0 edges, which is even. So the code is incorrect for this case.",

But this logic is similar to cycle detection (for any neighbor ! = par that has already been processed, then there's a cycle). Wait the base condition in the Java code was if (seen(child)) then return cycle, but only before setting seen to true. Wait let's recheck the Java's dfs function:\n\npublic int dfs(int child, int par) {\n\n    if (seen[child] == true) return cycle;\n\n    seen[child] = true;\n\n    for (each neighbor i) {\n\n    if (i ! =par ){\n\n       count++\n\n       if (dfs(child, next) == cycle) then return cycle. }\n\n   }\n\n   return path (0);\n\nSo in java code, the first thing is: if the node was seen before and is already visited, return cycle.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The code is solving some problem, probably related to graphs, since it uses a DFS traversal. The main goal seems to compute the number of edges to remove to make the graph a tree or something similar. \n\nThe code structure: \n\nIt reads m and n, which are the number of nodes and edges. Then builds an adjacency list for the graph. Then, it does a DFS on each unvisited node. The DFS function counts edges in the path and checks for cycles. Depending on the cycle detection and edge count mod 2, it calculates the number of edges to remove. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about the data structures first. Java uses a LinkedList of LinkedLists for the graph. In Fortran, we can represent this with an array of linked lists, but since Fortran doesn't have linked lists in the standard library (at least before Fortran 2003), but maybe using dynamic arrays. Alternatively, since the graph is undirected, perhaps we can use an adjacency list represented as a list for each node. \n\nAlternatively, since edges are added in the Java code as bidirectional (adding x to y's list and vice versa), maybe in Fortran, we can use an array of dynamic arrays. Wait, Fortran's arrays are more static. Hmm, perhaps use an array of pointers or something, but that might complicate. Alternatively, since m is the number of nodes, maybe the maximum possible nodes are limited (the problem constraints aren't known, but assuming m isn't too big). So we can represent the adjacency list as a list of adjacency nodes.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, dynamic arrays may require some handling. Alternatively, we can represent it with a fixed-size array where each row has entries for the nodes it's connected to. But the problem is that linked lists are dynamic. Alternatively, perhaps use an adjacency list with vectors, but maybe in Fortran, we can use an array where the size is determined at runtime.\n\nWait, in Fortran 90 or higher, you can have allocatable arrays. So perhaps for each node, we can have an array of integers, and use an array of these. Let me think. The code in Java is creating a graph of size m+1 (since in Java's code, the loop is from i=0 up to m, so the size is m+1 elements). Wait, but in the main, the nodes are referred by indices 1 to m (since in the loop that checks if seen[i], i starts at 1). \n\nSo, in Fortran:\n\nFirst, the graph would be an array of linked lists. Since Fortran's standard doesn't have linked lists, the best approach would be to represent the adjacency list using a structure with dynamic arrays. Alternatively, since you can have an array of pointers to arrays, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, use a flat array for storage with a list length. \n\nAlternatively, using an adjacency list in Fortran 90 with an array that's a list of nodes. Here's a common approach for adjacency lists in Fortran:\n\nWe can have an array that stores the adjacency lists as a single vector and have an offset array pointing to the start of each list. For example:\n\n* adj_node: an array that holds all the edges. \n* adj_ptr: an array that keeps track of starting indices for each node in adj_node. \n\nBut that might be more advanced. Alternatively, given that the Java code uses a linked list, perhaps better to use a list of linked lists represented as dynamic arrays in Fortran. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a dynamic approach with an array of linked lists. But maybe using an array of integers and keeping track of the length with another array. Let me try to think through the steps:\n\nFirst, in the Java code, the graph is an array of LinkedList<Integer>, so each node's list contains its adjacent edges. \n\nFor Fortran, maybe the following:\n\nWe can have a type for a linked list node, but that's a stretch since Fortran doesn't have linked lists. Maybe instead, use a dynamic array approach with allocatable arrays. \n\nI'll consider a 2D array. For each node, say 1 to m, we can have the adjacent nodes. So we can have an array for each node, like adj: list(adjacents). \n\nUnfortunately, in Fortran, declaring an array of arrays where each array can have variable length is not straightforward. One possible way is to use an array of pointers to derived types. Let me think of using a mixing of allocation approaches.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum number of edges can be determined by n edges (each edge is stored twice in adjacency list). But again, during input, when the edges are read, for each x and y, we need to add y to x's list and x to y's list.\n\nHmm, perhaps first read all edges, collect the adjacency lists into dynamic arrays. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the code needs to read m and n first. So first step: Read m and n. \n\nThen, construct the graph. Let me think of the following setup:\n\nWe can have an array of lists, where each list is represented as an array. \n\nLet\u2019s try using a module with dynamic memory:\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Let me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, the main program will read m and n. Then, create an adjacency list structure. Then, for each of the n edges, add the nodes to each other's adjacency list.\n\nIn Fortran, perhaps we can represent the adjacency list as an array of pointers to dynamically sized arrays. For each node, we can start with an initial size and then expand as needed. But this could get a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can use a 2D array with enough columns to hold up to, say, m nodes (since each node can have up to m-1 edges). But perhaps that's overkill. Alternatively, use an array of linked lists via a type.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the adjacency lists are linked lists, which allow adding elements to the end as they come. When building the adjacency lists, each time you add an edge x -> y, you add y to the linked list of x and x to y's. So, dynamic length.\n\nHmm, maybe in Fortran, using linked lists would require a lot of manual coding. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each node's adjacency list can be stored as a list implemented using a dynamic array. To do this, perhaps using an array for each node, and when adding, append to a list by expanding the array.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible structure:\n\nWe can have a 2D array for the adjacency list with a certain capacity for each node, resizing when necessary. But that's tricky in Fortran. \n\nAlternatively, since the code uses a linked list, perhaps instead of pointers, just using a linked list stored in arrays. For each node, we can give it a starting index in an array of edges. Like a linked list via adjacency lists as in the following:\n\nWait, perhaps a common way to represent adjacency lists in Fortran is with a pair of arrays: one is an array of nodes for each edge, and another array pointing to where each node's adjacency list starts. \n\nThe structure is as follows:\n\nadj: integer array (allocated to size 2n, since each edge is stored twice)\nstart: integer array of size (m+1), where start(i) points to the first edge for node i.\nend is start + 1 (for m+1 nodes). Then for each node i, its edges are from adj(start(i) : start(i+1) -1). \n\nThis way, the edge list is stored in one array, and each node's list is a section of that array. \n\nThis approach uses a lot less memory. However, constructing such arrays requires tracking where each node's edges start, and how many edges they have. Let's see how this would work here.\n\nAlright, let's start structuring this step by step.\n\nFirst, in Fortran:\n\nWe need to process m nodes and n edges, then build the adjacency lists into arrays. \n\nIn the code:\n\nFirst, read m and n: read *, m, n.\n\nThen, allocate the arrays. Let's assume adjacency lists and edge lists need to be built.\n\nWe can have:\n\ninteger, allocatable :: adj(:)\ninteger, allocatable :: start(:)  ! array of length m+1 (nodes 1..m)\ninteger :: ptr = 1\n\nInitialization:\n\n! start array initialized to 1 for each node?\nWait, let's think. The start array for node i will hold the starting index of their edges in the adj array. So initially, for all nodes, start(i) is 1, but need to increment properly.\n\nWait here's a better approach:\n\nFirst, initialize the start array such that start(1) = 1. The next nodes start is equal to start(i-1) + length of previous edges. But perhaps during edge insertion, we can track the current pointer.\n\nWait, perhaps for this approach, first, we need to first create the adjacency list by scanning all edges and counting the edges per node, then allocate the adj array properly.\n\nAlternative approach to adjacency list via arrays:\n\n1. First, for each node, count the number of edges by a first run through the edges.\n\n2. Allocates the start array of size m+1.\n\n3. Allocates the adj array of size total_edges.\n\nThen:\n\n- Initialize start(1) = 1, then for each node index 1 through m, start(n+1) = start(n) + count(n).\n\nThen, when inserting edges, starting with the first edge:\n\nBut since this requires two passes over the edges (to first count and then add), this is feasible. \n\nAlternatively, we can process the edges while building the adjacency lists:\n\nBut that might complicate. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start by reading all edges into a temporary array first, then process for adjacency lists. Since n edges can be stored as two arrays, x and y.\n\nAlternatively, step-by-step:\n\nFirst create an array for all edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the best approach for adjacency list here is to use a structure where:\n\n- Each node has a list of its adjacent nodes, stored as an array.\n\nIn Fortran, for each node, say, 1..m, we can have an array (an array of components). This can be represented using a one-dimensional array and a pointer array, similar to linked list.\n\nAlternatively, since in Fortran 90, allocatable arrays can be used with pointers, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nAnother idea:\n\nWe can have an array of dynamic pointers. For example, each adjacency list is a dynamic array for each node.\n\nSo for this, we can use a derived type:\n\ntype list_type\n    integer, allocatable :: items(:)\nend type list_type\n\ntype(list_type), dimension(:), allocatable :: graph\n\nThen, allocate graph(1 to m), and each element in the array is a list that can be expanded. \n\nAdding an item is done by resizing and appending.\n\nThis may be manageable. But this requires using dynamic arrays allocated with each element's items array growing as needed. But in Fortran, this requires careful appending, perhaps with reallocation.\n\nHmm, but maybe it's manageable. Let's see how to implement this.\n\nFirst, declaration:\n\nWe can have:\n\ntype node_list\n    integer, allocatable :: edges(:)\nend type node_list\n\ntype(node_list), dimension(:), allocatable :: graph\n\nThen, allocate graph(0:m) (since in Java code, the loop goes from 0 to m, maybe?)\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nThe for loop in the graph initialization is from 0 to m, meaning it's creating m+1 elements (indices 0 to m). But in the code, when adding nodes, the input is x and y, which are between 1 and m presumably, so perhaps node indices are from 1 to m. But in the Java code, the nodes are 1-based? The main loop for checking \"if (!ft.seen[i]) { ... }\" loops i from 1 to m. So nodes are 1-based.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in Fortran, the graph array has indices from 1 to m.\n\nWait the Java code's graph had m+1 elements because i goes up to m (inclusive) in the loop. So array size is m+1, but the first element (index 0) is unused? Or perhaps the nodes are from 0 to m-1? Not sure. Need to check the code.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe main function reads m and n, then in the for loop for initializing the graph:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) \n\nWait this loop runs for (i=0 to m) so the graph has m+1 nodes (from 0 to m). But the code during processing edges takes x and y, which might be up to m?\n\nWait in the code:\n\n\"ft.graph.get(x).add(y); ft.graph.get(y).add(x);\" so if x can be up to m then the array must go to m.\n\nWait the problem statement likely treats node numbers from 1 up to m. Because in the problem code, the main program's for loop is for i from 1 to m, so maybe the nodes are supposed to be numbered from 1 to m. But in Java code, the graph array was initialized as 0 up to m, which is m+1 elements. Hmm. \n\nWait that's a crucial point. So the Java graph has size m+1, so nodes 0 to m. But, perhaps the nodes are numbered from 1 to m, making the extra 0th entry unused. Maybe a bug? Or perhaps the first node is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines nodes as 1-based, so the graph's 0th entry is unused. The code may not even use node 0 except as the initial parameter in dfS. \n\nLooking at the Java DFS function: \"public int dfs(int child, int par)\". the parent variable 'par' can be 0. For example, when starting with node i, ft.dfs(i, 0) is called. Then, in the for loop:\n\nfor (Integer i : graph.get(child)) {\n\n      if (i != par) {\n\n          this.count++;\n\n          ...\n\n      }\n\n      }\n\nSo the child starts at 1 perhaps. So when child is, say, 1, the parent is 0. Since 'par' is passed as 0.\n\nThus, the nodes are numbered from 1 up to m, and the graph includes 0 but perhaps using it as a sentinel value for parent in the initial call. \n\nThus, in Fortran, we need the graph to have entries from 1 to m (assuming 1-based numbering and 0 being a dummy value). Or maybe just 0 to m nodes. \n\nHmm, so in Fortran, to replicate this, perhaps the graph array will have entries from 0 to m (so size of m+1). For node indices from 0 to m? Or perhaps the graph is 1-based with size m.\n\nNeed to clarify. Let me see how the code is used.\n\nThe main loop for building the graph:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) { ft.graph.add(new LinkedList<>()); }\n\nSo the first node is index 0. But in the edges:\n\nfor (int i=0; i < n; i++) {\n\nint x = sc.nextInt();\n\nint y = sc.nextInt();\n\n graph.get(x).add(y); graph.get(y).add(x);\n\n}\n\nThus, x and y can be from 0 up to m.\n\nWait in the problem, perhaps nodes are numbered from 0 to m, so the total nodes are m+1.\n\nWait that would be a problem if the problem says that m is the number of nodes, then this code would be incorrect. Unless there is a misread between Java's 0-based indices and the problem's 1-based.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines nodes as starting at 1, and the code incorrectly uses 0 to m. That would be a bug? Or perhaps the problem allows nodes 1..m and the code's indices are just 0-based (so 0 ~ m would be 1 to m+1?), but that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables were transposed. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem's node numbering starts at 1, so m is the number of nodes, so the code's nodes are 1..m, but the initial loop for the graph is from 0 to m (so creating an extra node 0 which is not used except as a par parameter). \n\nTherefore in the Fortran code, when creating the graph, should we have nodes from 1 to m, but in the graph array, include 0? Or adjust so that node numbers start from 1?\n\nAlternatively, adjust the code to be 1-based. So the Fortran program can use 1-based indices.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nWe need an array graph(1:m). \n\nBut in the initial loop in Java, it's from 0 to m, which would correspond to 0..m (so m+1 nodes). However, with that in the DFS function, perhaps node 0 is possible.\n\nWell, in any case, proceeding.\n\nLet me first think of variables.\n\nVariables in Java:\n\nclass variables:\n\n- count (this is an instance variable initialized to maybe 0 but looks like it tracks something in the DFS path length?)\n\nWait in the DFS function, when you call return path or cycle, the variables path and cycle are Class fields. path is 0, and cycle is 1. \n\nSo \"path =0\" and \"cycle=1\". Inside the DFS function, when returning path, it returns 0. \n\nWait the code has:\n\npublic int dfs(int child, int par) {\n\n    if (seen[child]) return cycle;\n\n    seen[child] = true;\n\n    for (Integer i : graph.get(child)) {\n\n        if (i != par) {\n\n            this.count++;\n\n            if (dfs(i, child) == cycle) { return cycle; }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return path;\n\n}\n\nSo the function returns either path (0) or cycle (1). \n\nThus, when during traversal, if the current node leads to a cycle (that is, the recursive call returned cycle (1)), then propagate it. Else, after processing all children, if no cycle was detected, return path (0).\n\nThe purpose of this is to detect whether a cycle exists in the current subtree. So the presence of a cycle in the subtree will set the final return value as cycle (1), otherwise path (0). \n\nSo, the 'count' variable is being used to count edges in the current path? Because each time we go into a child that's not the parent, we increment count by 1. Since every time you traverse from child to i, that's one edge, except the parent, and you recursively go, so count is effectively counting the number of edges in the current path, or the edges traversed during the path. \n\nWait in the for loop:\n\nfor (Integer i : graph.get(child)) {\n\n   if (i != par) {\n\n         count++          < ... \n\nso each time a neighboring node is visited, except parent, the count increases by 1. But the parent is the one that we came from.\n\nSo the count is the total number of edges in the tree or the component? Or perhaps the number of edges traversed during the traversal of the component?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's counting the number of edges in the entire path? Since in a tree, the number of edges is (nodes -1). When there's a cycle, some edge is counted twice. Wait, not sure.\n\nBut the key variables here are the count variables and the cycle detection.\n\nTranslating the code's variables:\n\nIn the class variables in Fortran, because Fortran doesn't have class/object variables, so the variables count, seen, path, cycle, graph need to be either global variables or passed to the dfs function. \n\nHowever, in Fortran, the functions can't have non-locally-scoped variables unless declared as module variables. Since the program is a simple translation and perhaps written as one proc., but I can have them as global variables, or in a module.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to code in such a way that the variables are in the same scope as the main program.\n\nBut for the purposes of this translation, it can be manageable. \n\nStarting with variables:\n\nIn the class codeforces_216_b has:\n\nint count;\n\nboolean[] seen;\n\nint path =0, cycle=1;\n\nLinkedList<LinkedList<Integer>> graph;\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be variables that are global or enclosed in a parent program's scope. \n\nLet me think of the Fortran code structure:\n\nThe program will have to:\n\n1. Read m and n from stdin.\n\n2. Read the n edges.\n\n3. Build the graph.\n\n4. Traverse each unvisited node.\n\n5. Perform DFS on each, and track count accordingly.\n\nSo, variables required:\n\n- m, n (input)\n\n- graph: adjacency lists of nodes. Let me choose the linked list as arrays.\n\n- seen: an array of boolean (logical) for tracking visited nodes. So arrays in Fortran, integers (0/1) or logical arrays.\n\n- count (an integer), path (constant 0), cycle (constant 1). \n\nWait in Fortran, path is set to 0 and cycle 1 as part of the class variables (but since in Fortran we might only do that with constants.)\n\nWait the class variables path is initialized to 0, and cycle to 1. So in Fortran, since those are just constants used as returns from DFS, perhaps best to just use integer parameters:\n\ninteger, parameter :: path = 0, cycle =1.\n\nYes, path can be a constant, and cycle another.\n\nThus, variables:\n\nglobal variables would be:\n\ninteger m, n\n\nlogical, dimension(:), allocatable :: seen\n\ninteger, dimension(:), pointer :: graph(:)  ? Wait no, the graph is a list of lists.\n\nHmm, perhaps better to use the structure approach with a type.\n\nGiven time constraints, let's think of using the adjacency list approach via linked lists via arrays.\n\nOption: the adjacency list for each node is a linked list represented by a dynamic array. \n\nSo for Fortran, here's a possible structure:\n\nWe'll need a type for the adjacency list:\n\ntype node\n   integer, dimension(:), pointer :: adj_list => null()\nend type node\n\ntype(node), dimension(:), pointer :: graph => null()\n\nBut this requires dynamically allocating each node's adjacency list. So when adding an edge to the list, we can append to the array.\n\nAlternatively, use an array of linked lists through linked list nodes.\n\nWait maybe better with a derived type to store the pointers.\n\nBut maybe the following approach can work:\n\n- Create an array graph for each node (from 1 to m) with a dynamic array. \n\nWe can allocate graph as follows:\n\nallocate(graph%adj_list(1: initial_size)), but need to be able to expand whenever adding a new item. Since each edge requires adding the other node in each's list.\n\nWait perhaps a more straightforward way is to represent each adjacency list as an array that may be of variable length. Fortran's allocatable arrays can be shrinked or expanded, but this can be done by creating a temporary array and copying.\n\nWait here's a possible step-by-step approach:\n\nInitialize the graph as array of 1-based for each node (1..m).\n\nEach node has an array (like adj_i) to store its neighbors, and current size. \n\nInitialize each adj_i as a null array. \n\nWhen adding an edge x <--> y:\n\nfor node x, add y to x's list.\n\nfor node y, add x to y's list.\n\nThus, to add to a node's list the element 'val', you can: \n\nIf the current size is at capacity, allocate a new array with increased size. copy over elements, add val, then associate back.\n\nBut this can be cumbersome. \n\nAlternatively, since we know beforehand how many edges each node has (due to the edge list being read in first), perhaps pre-allocate the array for each node.\n\nWait maybe better to first read all edges into an array, process all the edges, and count the number of edges per node, then pre-allocate the adjacency lists for each node, then read the edges again to fill in. This is two passes.\n\nLet me sketch this:\n\nRead all edges into temporary arrays:\n\nallocate the node1 and node2 arrays:\n\n    read n edges:\n\n    allocate( in_edges(1:2*n) ) \u2013 no, need node1array and 2, but just pair of arrays:\n\n    allocate(xarr(1:n), yarr(1:n))\n\n    then read the mats into them:\n\n      read *, (xarr(i), yarr(i), i=1, n)\n\nThen, after reading, for each node, count the number of edges.\n\ncounts(1:m) = 0\n\n    do i =1, n\n\n       counts(xarr(i)) = counts(xarr(i))+1\n\n       counts(yarr(i)) = counts(yarr(i)) +1\n\n    end do\n\nThen, allocate each graph node's array.\n\nallocate graph(1 to m)\n\nThen for each graph node, allocate its adj_list:\n\ndo i =1, m\n\n   allocate(graph(i)%adj_list(1: counts(i))\n\nend do\n\nBut then when filling in, the order must be tracked. For that, it requires pointers or an index for each.\n\nWait probably better approach is to use array of array pointers. Here's the plan:\n\nFirst, store the edges in a temporary array. Then for each node, have a list of its edges. Alternatively, here's another way:\n\nFirst, create a cumulative count array. \n\nInitialize:\n\nnum_edges = counts. \n\nThen, allocate for each node's adj_list the appropriate size.\n\nBut then, insert into each node's list.\n\nWait, let me write:\n\nread the edges first into two arrays x and y.\n\nthen compute for each node i, the number of edges (counts(i)) which is sum.\n\nthen initialize the start array as starting indices:\n\nallocate(adj_lists(1 tot ), but maybe:\n\nWait perhaps the linked list approach is easier here. Let me try to think again.\n\nAlternative to adjacency lists using arrays:\n\nUse:\n\ninteger,_allocatable :: adj(:) \n\ninteger, allocatable :: heads(:) \n\ninteger,_allocatable :: nexts(:)\n\nbut this may be overcomplicating as it's a link list structure. \n\nAnother idea:\n\nThe best way is perhaps to implement the adjacency list in Fortran 90 with a list that's an array of pointers to arrays (linked lists).\n\nAlternatively, since the code uses a linked list, but in Fortran it's hard, perhaps using arrays and recognizing that in the code's DFS function, each list is traversed in order, but in any order, since order doesn't matter (we just need neighboring nodes except parent). So during traversal, as long as each neighbor except the parent is processed, it's okay.\n\nThus, perhaps allocate for each node an array of adjacency nodes. \n\nLet me try this step by step:\n\nFirst, declare the following variables:\n\ninteger,parameter :: cycle=1, path=0\n\ninteger,allocatable :: adjList(:,:), sizeList(:), maxSize(:)\n\nBut perhaps using the following:\n\nEach node's adjacency list is stored in a dynamic array with a size. \n\nLet me create a derived type for a linked list:\n\nWe could use the following:\n\ntype adjacencyNode\n    integer, allocatable :: list(:)\n    integer  :: count =0  ! current size\n    integer  :: capacity =0  ! current allocated size\nend type \n\ntype(adjacencyNode), allocatable, dimension(:) :: graph\n\nThen, during initialization of each node's list:\n\n Initialize the list for each node as:\n\n- when a node has an empty list: capacity maybe 0?\n\nWhen adding a new element y to node x's list:\n\nif count +1 > capacity:\n\n   allocate a new array with capacity *2 (at least 1+current count?)\n\n   then copy existing elements, set the new element, then replace the pointer.\n\nThis requires a lot of code. Alternatively, pre-allocate some capacity.\n\nBut given the time constraints here, perhaps use a simpler approach where each list is represented as a 1D array and the size is tracked. \n\nAlternatively use a list in an external array.\n\nPossible step-by-step steps in Fortran code:\n\nFirst, the code will need to:\n\n1. Read m and n.\n\nThen, since each edge will need to be stored for both nodes, the number of adjacency entries is 2*n. \n\nThus:\n\nMan, I'm getting into a rut here. Let me try to code the adjacency list using a single array with start array.\n\nThis is perhaps the most efficient way.\n\nFirst, let me outline:\n\nWe need to build an adjacency list using the \"adjacency list array\" approach:\n\nvariables:\n\n\u2022 size m+1 (since in java code nodes from 0 to m, but in the problem probably 1..m). \n\nLet's proceed with the assumption that nodes are numbered 0 to m as in the Java code. Wait in Java code the loop is:\n\nfor i from 0 to m in the graph initialization. So the graph is built for nodes 0..m.\n\nThus, in Fortran, we need to represent nodes 0 to m (total m+1 nodes, node 0 to m). \n\nThus nodes are from 0 to m (inclusive).\n\nThen, the edges are stored as indices.\n\nThus:\n\nBuild adjacency list array-based:\n\nFirst, the total number of edges read is n edges, each contributing two entries (x to y and y to x).\n\nThus, the total entries needed: 2n.\n\nHence:\n\nAllocate the adj list as:\n\nAdj is an integer array of size 2n.\n\nThen, heads array of size m+2 (since for 0..m node, heads(0) to heads(m+1)), each pointing to start the adjacency list for that node.\n\nBut the steps to build these arrays.\n\nFirst step:\n\nAllocate head and adj arrays:\n\nallocate( adj(1:2*n), heads(0:m+1), next_node(m+1) ) \n\nWait perhaps steps:\n\nallocate(heads(0: m), next_node(1:2*n), adj_node(1:2*n) )\n\nbut let me think, perhaps the linked list is the correct approach here.\n\nAlternative method using linked list structure:\n\nThe standard linked list for adjacency lists in Fortran can be done using three arrays:\n\n\u2022 next_node: pointers to the next edge for a given node.\n\n\u2022 adj_node: stores the neighbor node.\n\n\u2022 This forms a linked list for each node. \n\nThe process is:\n\nInitialize:\n\nfor each node, heads(node) = 0 (null pointer)\n\nedges_counter =1 \n\nfor each edge (x,y):\n\n    adj_node(edges_counter) = y\n\n    next_node(edges_counter) = heads(x)\n\n    heads(x) = edges_counter\n\n    edges_counter +=1\n\n    adj_node(edges_counter) =x\n\n    next_node(edges_counter) = heads(y)\n\n    heads(y) = edges_counter\n\n    edges_counter +=1 \n\nThus, when processing node, you can traverse its edges as:\n\ncurrent = heads(x)\n\ndo while (current >0 )\n\n    neighbor = adj_node(current)\n\n    current = next_node(current)\n\nloop.\n\nThis is probably the best way. Since linked list is easier to build incrementally without needing to know the list length in advance.\n\nYes! This approach is manageable. \n\nThus, the variables would be:\n\n INTEGER :: adj_node, next_node (dimension set to max number of edges), heads (for nodes 0 to m).\n\nThe maximum edges is 2n, thus arrays can be size 2n.\n\nThus steps:\n\n1 Read m and n. (lines 3-4?)\n\nBut since we need to pre-allocate the arrays (F77 style no dynamic, F90 allows allocatable).\n\nThus in code:\n\ndeclare:\n\ninteger::m, n\n\ninteger,allocatable :: heads(:)\n\ninteger,allocatable :: adj_node(:)\n\ninteger,allocatable :: next_node(:)\n\ninteger :: ptr=1 ! used to keep track of next free position in adj_node and next_node arrays.\n\n...\n\nRead m,n\n\nallocate( heads(0:m)) ! node are from 0 to m, hence 0..m indices.\n\nallocate(adj_node(1:2*n))\n\nallocate(next_node(1:2*n))\n\nheads =0  !initialize all heads to 0 (zero is the base case for not existing)\n\nThen, read edges:\n\ndo i=1,n\n\n   read*,x,y\n\n   call add_edge(x,y)\n\nend do \n\nsubroutine to add_edge(x,y) is:\n\nthis would create the two edges.\n\nsubroutine add_edge(x,y, heads, adj_node, next_node, ptr) // basically other vars may need to pass. \n\n  adj_node(ptr) = y\n\n  next_node(ptr) = heads(x)\n\n  heads(x)=ptr\n\n  ptr=ptr+1\n\n  adj_node(ptr)=x\n\n  next_node(ptr) = heads(y)\n\n  heads(y)=ptr\n\n  ptr=ptr+1\n\nend\n\nWait, but in Fortran function arguments are by reference by default, but arrays must be passed by pointer. Alternatively, this approach may be clunky, but can be handled.\n\nAlternatively, since all the variables are stored in main or module, just use globally accessible variables.\n\nProceeding with that.\n\nThen, the DFS function:\n\nNow, the DFS function. The variables:\n\nglobal count (initially set to 0 each time), seen array of logical (size up to m nodes? Wait since nodes are from 0 to m (m+1 nodes) so the seen array should be logical array size m+1.\n\nNo, the problem mentions main code loops i from 1 to m, so perhaps nodes 1..m are the valid ones, and node zero is just a dummy parent.\n\nThus, the seen array can be logical of size m+1 (for 0 to m, inclusive).\n\nvariables:\n\ninteger count\n\nlogical,allocatable :: seen(:)\n\nIn the main program, allocate:\n\nallocate( seen(0:m) )\n\nSet seen = .false.\n\nThe count variable can be a normal variable. \n\nThe DFS function needs to have access to the heads, adj_node, next_node arrays (as they are global?), the seen array, the count variable, etc.\n\nThe DFS function in Fortran:\n\nThe function can be written with parameters: (i.e., child, par, ... but perhaps use a recursive function.\n\nWait in Fortran, recursive functions can return integers.\n\nThe Java's dfs is:\n\nint dfs(int child, int par):\n\nso in Fortran: integer function dfs(child, par). \n\nVariables accessed inside: adj_node, next_node, heads, seen, count.\n\nThus the code outline for DFS function (assuming all are global).\n\nfunction dfs(child, par) result(rval)\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: child, par\n\ninteger :: rval\n\nrval = path  ! assume no cycle unless found\n\n...\n\nend function.\n\nWait let's write that:\n\ninteger function dfs(child, par)\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer, intent(in) :: child, par\n\n  integer :: current_edge, neighbor\n\n  if ( seen(child) ) then \n\n    dfs = cycle\n\n    return\n\n  end if\n\n  seen(child) = .true.\n\n  current_edge = heads(child)\n\n  ! traverse all edges from current node:\n\n  dfs = path   ' default, unless a cycle is found.\n\n  do while ( current_edge >0 ) \n\n    neighbor = adj_node(current_edge)\n\n    if (neighbor /= par ) then \n\n        count = count +1 \n\n        ! recursive call:\n\n        r = dfs( neighbor, child )\n\n        if (r ==cycle ) then \n\n            dfs = cycle \n\n            return \n\n        end if \n\n    end if \n\n    current_edge = next_node(current_edge)\n\n  end do\n\n  return \n\nend function\n\nWait but the Current_edge is the 'current edge' which points to the neighbor.\n\nWait let me think through:\n\nThe current_edge variable is starting at heads(child), then the first neighbor is adj_node(current_edge). \n\nThen, moving to next Edge = next_node(current_edge)\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Java for (Integer i : graph.get(child)) loops all neighbors except parent.\n\nIn this way, the Fortran code above loops each neighbor (since it's moving through the edge list), but skips the par.\n\nWait but the par could be the parent's node.\n\nIn this way, this would be correct.\n\nNow, variables tracked here: the variables count is a global (module variable) for the total count during the traversal. \n\nBut since this is a recursive function, if this is in a function, the count needs to be initialized and tracked between recursive calls.\n\nWait yes, because the function is done as part of a traversal of a component (so for the entire DFS of a component, the count is cumulative. Thus, the count variable is part of the state common to the entire computation chain leading to that child.)\n\nThus the count variable must be in a global scope and is reset for each component's traversal.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting this together.\n\nThe variables in the Fortran code:\n\nGlobal variables (declared in program or in a module. ):\n\ninteger, parameter:: cycle =1, path=0 \n\ninteger, allocatable :: adj_node(:), next_node(:), heads(:)\n\ninteger :: m, n, ptr=1 \n\nlogical, allocatable :: seen(:)\n\ninteger :: count\n\nThe main program would be structured as:\n\nprogram codeforces_216_B\n\n implicit none \n\n ! variable declarations...\n\n read *, m, n \n\n allocate( heads(0:m) )  ! for node 0 to m.\n\n allocate(adj_node(1:2*n), next_node(1:2*n) )\n\n heads=0 \n\n ptr =1 \n\n ! read edges:\n\n integer :: x,y, i \n\n do i =1, n \n\n   read*,x,y \n\n   call add_edge(x,y)  ! process first edge \n\n end do \n\n allocate( seen(0:m) )\n\n seen=.false. \n\n integer :: toremove =0 \n\n do i=1,m \n\n   if( .not. seen(i) ) then \n\n     count=0 \n\n     if ( dfs(i, 0) == cycle ) then \n\n        if( mod(count,2) ==1 ) then \n\n           toremove= toremove+1 \n\n        end if \n\n     end if \n\n   end if \n\n end do \n\n if ( mod( m - toremove, 2 ) ==1 ) then \n\n    toremove= toremove +1 \n\n end if \n\n print*, toremove \n\n contains \n\n subroutine add_edge(x,y)\n\n!

Then, during traversal, if any recursive call returns cycle (1), then we propagate that.\n\nOtherwise, after processing all edges, return the original dfs value (path).\n\nBut in the initial if statement, what if the seen(child) is true. Like when backtracking, or because there's a cycle.\n\nWait, for example, suppose during the call to the neighbor, that node is already seen. So:\n\nIf neighbor is par, then it is skipped.\n\nIf neighbor is not par, and the node was already visited but not via the current path, then that means the path has a cycle. Because otherwise, the only way to have been visited earlier is through another path. But this logic is similar to cycle detection (for any neighbor != par that has already been processed, then there's a cycle).\n\nWait the base condition in the Java code was if (seen(child)) then return cycle, but only before setting seen to true.\n\nWait let's recheck the Java's dfs function:\n\npublic int dfs(int child, int par) {\n\n    if (seen[child] == true) return cycle;\n\n    seen[child] = true;\n\n    for (each neighbor i) {\n\n    if (i !=par ){\n\n       count++\n\n       if (dfs(child, next) == cycle) then return cycle.\n\n    }\n\n   }\n\n   return path (0);\n\nSo in java code, the first thing is: if the node was seen before and is already visited, return cycle. That means that the current path has revisited, indicating a cycle.\n\nWait, but this can only happen if during traversal back via a different path. Wait this is cycle detection.\n\nThus the base condition in the java function is that if in the current path, the child has been already visited, then we have a cycle. That is, the code assumes that the node is being revisited via a path different than the parent.\n\nWait the code's approach is that: as we mark the node (seen as true) before following its edges. \n\nThus, the problem is that:\n\nSuppose we have a cycle like A -> B -> C -> A. \n\nUpon entering A (parent 0), mark as seen= true.\n\nThen when processing neighbor B, set par=A.\n\n On B's call, enter its edge C (not parent A). Then C's node is called. \n\nOn C we process neighbor B (parent is B?), not sure. Wait when in C's call, the call comes from B, so par is B.\n\nThen when processing C's neighbor A:\n\nthe neighbor is not par (B), so we call dfs(A, C).\n\n When entering A's dfs routine, we check seen[A] is true (already set when first processing A).\n\n Thus the first condition is true, so return cycle. \n\nThis indicates that the path found a cycle.\n\nThus the code's loop correctly detects cycles via back edges.\n\nSo for Fortran, in the same way:\n\nIn the function dfs(child, par):\n\n first, if seen(child) is true, then return cycle.\n\n Else set seen to true.\n\n Proceed in the edges.\n\nThus, in the Fortran code, the first line inside dfs is:\n\n   if ( seen(child) ) then \n\n      dfs = cycle \n\n      return \n\n   end if \n\nWait, thus the function needs to have that as first step.\n\nModifying the code as:\n\n integer function dfs(child, par)\n\n    implicit none \n\n    integer, intent(in):: child, par \n\n    integer current_edge, neighbor \n\n    integer r \n\n    if ( seen(child) ) then \n\n        dfs = cycle \n\n        return \n\n    endif \n\n    seen(child) = .true. \n\n    current_edge= heads(child)\n\n    do while(current_edge >0 ) \n\n        neighbor = adj_node(current_edge) \n\n        if ( neighbor /= par ) then \n\n            count =count +1 \n\n            r= dfs(neighbor, child)\n\n            if (r ==cycle) then \n\n                dfs= cycle \n\n                RETURN \n\n            endif \n\n        end if \n\n        current_edge= next_node(current_edge) \n\n    end do \n\n    dfs= path \n\n    return \n\nend function \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, in the main program, when we do the call for each node not seen:\n\nIn main:\n\n do i =1 to m: loop the nodes?\n\nYes, as in the Java code's \"for(int i=1...\".\n\nSo:\n\nThe loop:\n\ndo i=1, m \n\n   if(.not. seen(i)) then \n\n     count=0 \n\n     if ( dfs(i,0) == cycle ) then \n\n         if( mod(count,2) ==1 ) then \n\n            toremove +=1 \n\n         end if \n\n     end if \n\n  end if \n\nend do \n\nNow, the count variable is a global variable which is set to zero each time a new component is processed. \n\nThe important thing is that each time, the count starts at zero, and counts edges for that component.\n\nThen, the the code's final part:\n\n if ( mod( m - toremove, 2 ) ==1 ) then \n\n      toremove +=1 \n\n  end if \n\n  print *, toremove \n\nThus, this code seems correct.\n\nAnother thing: in the add_edge routine, when we add edges between x and y:\n\nthe parameters in the add_edge subroutine:\n\nthe x and y inputs are passed, and the arrays heads, adj_node, next_node are global variables. \n\nYes.\n\nTesting possible errors.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- if m=1 (single node, no edges) \u2192 then n=0. Then, when processing, the node 1 is unvisited. The dfs call starts with count=0.\n\n the dfs returns path (0).\n\n then, since 0%2=0, toremove is 0.\n\n Then, m-toremove =1\u2192 which is odd. so toremove becomes 1. So the answer is 1?\n\nWhat is the correct answer? For a single node, the tree must have zero edges. Since m=1, it is already a valid tree (root is alone). So no edges to Cut. But the code would give 1?\n\nHmm, that suggests an error.\n\nWait let me see what the code does.\n\nIn this case:\n\nm=1, n=0.\n\nThe loop for reading edges will process n=0 times, so no edges added.\n\nThe graph has node 1 not connected. \n\nThe seen array initializes all to false.\n\nThen, the loop i=1:\n\nseen(1)=false.\n\ncount set to 0.\n\ncall dfs(1,0).\n\nIn dfs(1,0):\n\nseen(1) is false. Set it to true.\n\nloop through edges of node 1: the edges list for node 1.\n\nHeads(1) \u2192 initially 0 (no edges). \n\ncurrent_edge= heads(1) =0. So loop not entered.\n\nThus dfs returns path (0).\n\nthe if statement (result ==cycle ? 1? 0 \u2192 no. So no adding of toremove.\n\nThen the first phase ends: toremove is 0. \n\nThen, m-toremove = 1-0=1. Which is odd. Thus, toremove +=1 \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nThe answer is 1, which is incorrect.\n\nBut the correct answer should be 0: already a valid tree (no edges, single node is a tree).\n\nAh, so there's a mistake here.\n\nThis indicates an error in the logic.\n\nWait let me see what the original code does in the same case.\n\nLet's view the Java code's logic.\n\nIn the Java code, for m=1, n=0:\n\nThe graph is built for nodes 0..m (1 nodes: 0,1).\n\nBut during main's loop:\n\ni loops from 1 to m:\n\nso i=1 is considered.\n\nseen[i] is initially false.\n\nCount is set to 0.\n\nCall dfs(1,0).\n\nInside dfs(1, 0):\n\nseen is marked true.\n\nthe graph's node 1 has no edges (adj.get(1) is empty list.\n\nThus, for loop is 0 iterations. thus, after the loop, return path(0).\n\nSo in the main code, \n\nthe \"if (dfS==cycle?) condition is false \u2192 thus, toremove is not incremented.\n\nThen, the toremove is 0.\n\nThen, the next line:\n\nif ( (m - toremove) is odd \u2192 1-0=1: yes. so toremove +=1 \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nThis causes the answer to be 1, which the user would expect 0.\n\nThus, there is a bug in the original Java code. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows multiple components?\n\nWait the original problem seems to be about a \"forest\" and the number of edges to remove to make it a single tree. \n\nWait the problem must have some specific conditions. Looking up problem CFE 216b:\n\nLooking up [Codeforces problem 216B], the problem is:\n\nYou are given a non-empty undirected forest (a graph without cycles). Find the minimal number of edges to be remove so that after removing these edges, the remaining graph is a tree with even number of edges.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is differently stated. Let me quickly check.\n\nProblem 216 B: Transforming a Forest into a Tree.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYou have a forest (multiple disconnected trees), you can add/remove edges, but the task is: remove sufficient edges so that the remaining graph is a tree with an even number of edges.\n\nAh, no, the problem description is:\n\nThe problem is:\n\nYou are given a forest (an undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of m vertices and some edges. You are to remove at least one edge so that the resulting is a tree with an even number of edges. Find the minimal number of edges to remove.\n\nWait no, let me check.\n\nProblem 216 B:\n\nInput is graph is a forest (already acyclic), so edges e= (m \u2013k), where k is components.\n\nWe can remove edges to make a tree (must be connected), but the final tree must have even number of edges.\n\nBecause a tree requires exactly (nodes -1) edges.\n\nWait to form a tree, you have to make the graph connected (so you need to have one connected component).\n\nWait no, you have to have exactly m-1 edges and be connected, forming a tree.\n\n Wait the problem says \"The minimal number of edges to be removed so that the remaining graph is a tree\".\n\nSince the original graph is a forest (so, several trees). To turn it into a single tree: \n\nFirst, the removal must leave a tree, i.e. connected (so it has one component) and the number of edges is (m-1).\n\nThus, the idea is to choose which branches to keep so that the result is a single tree with an even number of edges.\n\nWait the problem requires that the resulting graph is a tree, which has an even number of edges. \n\nWait wait the problem says, that the resulting graph after removing edges must be a tree AND have an even number of edges. The minimal number of edges to remove to achieve this.\n\nThus, two conditions:\n\n- It must be a tree (connected, and has exactly m-1 edges )\n\n- furthermore, the number of edges (m-1 ) must be even.\n\nThe minimal number of edges to remove is to have ( desired edges - original edges )\n\nWait wait no: the original graph is a forest, so it may have several components. To make it a single tree, you have to leave exactly m-1 edges. \n\nBut you can choose any subset that forms a tree with even edges.\n\nThus, the problem requires to choose edges so that the remaining graph is a tree with an even number of edges. \n\nThus:\n\nThe steps:\n\nThe minimal number of edges to remove is total edges now minus desired edges (m-1) when possible.\n\nHowever, the desired edges (m-1) must be even. \n\nThus, if (m-1 is even):\n\nThus, you can leave exactly m-1 edges ( a tree, so the forest has exactly m-1 edges? it can)\n\nWait the initial forest may have edges less than m-1 (if it has multiple components, thus edges = sum over each tree: (nodes-in-tree -1), so total edges less than (m - number of components). \n\n Thus, to make a tree (requires m-1 edges and connected), you must start with at least (m-1 edges). So? only possible if the initial forest's edges are >= m-1. But no, perhaps you can only remove edges, not add.\n\nAh wait, the problem says you can remove edges. \n\nSo to get a tree with exactly m-1 edges, you have to ensure you have exactly a tree (1 component) and edges= m-1. \n\nThus, the initial graph can't contain a tree? so how? \n\nEffec\n\nAnyway, the problem requires that the final graph is a tree (so, n edges must become m-1 , and connected), and when possible to have m-1 edges being even.\n\nThus, if m-1 is even, then the answer is (original edges - (m-1)), provided that the original forest can have its edges reduced to exactly m-1 edges with connectivity ( which requires that the original has at least m-1 edges, but since it's a forest, edges is m - components.\n\nThus to get the required edges of m-1, we need to have the original graph's edges: m - components = e, then to have e >= m-1 \u2192 only possible if the number of components <=1. \n\n Because components of the original is C, so m-C edges. To have m-1 = edges after removal:\n\n must have m-1 >= m-C \u2192 so C >=1 (possible only if C=1, so already a tree).\n\n Thus, the problem likely is to check if:\n\nif possible to make a tree with even number of edges:\n\nIf the current number of edges is at least m-1 (so original edges =m-1, meaning already a tree). \n\nThus, the only way is that the original graph is a tree with even edges: then you don't need to remove any edge. \n\nElse, find a minimal way etc.\n\nWait I'm getting confused with the problem statement, but the original code's approach:\n\nLooking at the Java code's logic:\n\nAfter several manipulations, the code is in a way counting the number of \" components which have an odd number of branches, but how?\n\nWait the code in the Java dfs returns 1 if there is a cycle, but the code is built for a forest (no cycles), so the dfs will not find cycles.\n\n The Java code is building an adjacency list for a forest.\n\nThe dfs counts edges in the path for each component.\n\nThus for each component (tree), which has edges = nodes -1 in the tree.\n\nso count is the number of edges (since the code traverses all edges, but adding 1 for each edge in the path (except parent). Thus count would equals the number of edges in the component.\n\n For example, in a single node, the component has 0 edges. The count after processing is 0.\n\n Thus in the case of m=1, the count is 0 \u2192 even, so toremove isn't increased. \n\n Then (m - toremove) = 1-0=1 (odd), so the final toremove becomes 1. \n\n The code produces the wrong result. This suggests that a bug exists in the code and possibly explained by incorrect problem understanding.\n\n But perhaps the problem requires that the resulting tree has an even number of edges, which is (m-1), so m-1 must be even. For m=1: the required edges would be 0 (even?), but 0 is even, so it's okay. Thus the minimal edge to remove is 0 (already fine). But according to the code, the output is 1, suggesting that the code has a bug.\n\n Wait for the code's first phase:\n\n for components without cycles (since it's a forest):\n\n the dfs returns path (0), and the count of edges is edges in component. \n\n in case of m=1 \u2192 count is 0 (edges).\n\n so the code's first loop adds nothing to toremove (since mod(count,2) is 0 \u2192 no.\n\n then m - toremove \u21921-0=1 (odd). \n\n thus code's final logic increases toremove by 1 \u2192 total to_remove is1.\n\n but the correct output would be 0, because the tree has 0 edges, which is even. \n\n So the code is incorrect for this case.\n\nPerhaps the problem guarantees that the graph is a tree initially? Or requires that any input of a forest can have such a removal?\n\nThis suggests that there is a bug in the code, which must be addressed in the translation.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps my analysis is incorrect, and the code is correct.\n\n Let me see another scenario:\n\n let m=3 nodes connected as a tree ( edges 2). which is even. Thus toremove is 0.\n\n The code would output 0. \n\n which is correct.\n\n But when the edges are 3 nodes but the graph is two separate trees:\n\n e.g. m=3, edges are 1 ( two components), the code will calculate for components:\n\neach component's edges count is computed. \n\n Then toremove would depend on how many components have an odd count.\n\n For instance:\n\n node 1 connected with node2 (edge count for component 1 is1). node3 is isolated (component count is0).\n\n then:\n\n when processing i=1: count is1 \u2192 mod 1 is 1 \u2192 toremove +=1.\n\n processing i=3: component count 0 \u2192 mod 0 \u2192 no addition.\n\n total toremove=1.\n\n then m is3, m-toremove=3-1=2 (even), so no increment.\n\n total remains 1. \n\n Then the minimal edges to reach even total edges: \n\n the desired is to have edges =m-1 =2.\n\n The current total edges is1 ( assuming n=1). To make it 2 edges (even), we need to add an edge, but the code is for removing. \n\nAh this shows the code may be incorrect.\n\n Alternatively this is way too time consuming.\n\n Given that the user requested a translation of the Java code into fortran, I shall proceed with the translation as per the code structure, noting that there may be an issue in the logic, but that's presumably beyond the current task.\n\nThus proceeding with the fortran code written earlier.\n\nNow, the full code would look as follows.\n\nThe final Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_216_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: cycle =1, path =0\n\ninteger :: m, n\n\ninteger, allocatable :: adj_node(:), next_node(:), heads(:)\ninteger :: ptr =1\n\nlogical, allocatable :: seen(:)\n\ninteger :: count, toremove\n\n\tINTEGER :: i, x,y, r\n\n!

Suppose during the loop over edges:\n\nAfter encountering a recursive call where the returned r is 'cycle', we exit the loop. \n\nThe cycle flag is propagated.\n\nThus, the function's loop must terminate after encountering a cycle.\n\nBut in the function code inside the do while loop:\n\n             r=dfs(neighbor, child)\n             if (r ==cycle) then\n                rval= cycle\n                !

Perhaps the code's logic is flawed but is correct for the actual problem conditions.\n\n Presuming the code is correct as per the problem's intended solution, the translation is correct.\n\n Thus the Fortran code as above is the translation.\n\n I'll write it."
