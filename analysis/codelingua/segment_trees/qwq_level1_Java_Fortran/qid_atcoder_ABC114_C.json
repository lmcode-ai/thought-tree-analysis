Then the code does reverse, which would give \"373\", so that when read as an integer, it's 373, but reversed would be same. Wait in the string \"373\" reversed is still same, so that works. Another example with 3\u219273 (original s=\"357\" gives next i=373, so yes). Wait so the process is that after the for loop building new_str, the new string is then reversed to form the next number's digits in the correct order.",

Here's the code: After constructing new_str up to current_length:\n\nrev_length = current_length \n\nrev_str = \" \"*rev_length\n\ndo i = 1, current_length \n\n   rev_str(i:i) = new_str(current_length +1 -i : current_length +1 -i )\n\nend do Thus the rev_str will hold the reversed characters. Then convert rev_str to the next_i:\n\n read(rev_str,*) next_i But in practice, use an integer*8 value:\n\ninteger(8) next_i \n\nread(rev_str,*) next_i \n\nThus, the process for building next_i is implemented.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should have been:\n\n            if (!f) sb.append('3');\n\nBut the code uses append(3), which in Java is allowed (though appending char is more correct).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Java to Fortran translation. Hmm, the code is for solving a problem from AtCoder's ABC114, specifically problem C. The Java code reads an integer N, then counts numbers starting from 357 that are <= N and contain the digits 3,5,7. It also generates the next number in some way each iteration. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the Java code's logic thoroughly before translating it. Let me read through it step by step.\n\nThe main function starts by reading N. Then initializes i with 357 and a counter c at 0. The loop runs while i is <= N. Each iteration checks if the string representation of i contains all three digits '3', '5', '7'. If yes, increment c.\n\nThen the part with the StringBuilder is more complex. Let me parse that. \n\nThe code constructs a new number by processing each character of the current i's string. Starting from the end (since they loop in reverse with j from 0 to length-1, but step is reversed). The logic might be building the next number by appending 3,5,7 in some order... The 'f' flag is used to track whether they've started modifying digits. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nWait, the loop for the digits: j starts at 0, and the characters are accessed from s.length()-1 -j which seems like starting from the last character, moving backwards. Wait, in the loop variables: \n\nfor (int j=0; j < s.length(); j++) {\n   char a = s.charAt(s.length()-1 -j );\n}\n\nWait that would mean that for j=0: the last character, then j=1: the second last, etc. So processing the digits from least significant to most? \n\nThen the code builds a new string (sb) by going through each digit (starting from the end). \n\nIf 'f' is false, then a is processed. \n\nInitially, f is false, so for each character:\n\nFor the first character (the last digit in the original number):\n\nIf a is '3', then append '5', set f = true.\n\nElse if a is '5', append '7', set f = true.\n\nElse, append '3'.\n\nThen, for subsequent characters (j>0, so f might still be false), until f becomes true. Once f is true, they just append whatever a is. \n\nWait, this loop is a bit tricky. Let me see an example. Suppose current i is 357. \n\nThe string s is \"357\", length 3.\n\nProcessing with j=0, 1, 2:\n\nStart with f set to false.\n\nFor j=0: the character is s.charAt(2) - the last digit, '7'.\n\na is '7', so in the else clause (since 7 isn't 3 or 5). So append '3'. Set f to not touched here, so remains false?\n\nWait, no. The code inside the else part appends '3' without setting f. Wait the code:\n\nelse {\n    sb.append('3');\n}\n\nso in this case, if a is neither '3' nor '5', then append '3', and f stays as false.\n\nWait for the first digit (the last digit of the number) being '7', so append '3' to the sb. So after processing first character (j=0):\n\nsb currently has '3'.\n\nThen, moving to j=1: the second character (since 2-1 =1). The character is s.charAt(1) which is '5'.\n\nNow, since f is still false? Because the previous step was a 7, so in the else clause, so f remains false.\n\nCheck a (now '5'). So:\n\nif (a is '3'? no), then check if is '5'? yes. Append '5'? Wait no. Wait, in the code for the if block when a is '5', the code appends '7', and sets f to true. Wait, yes. \n\nWait the code says, if f is false (which it is), the if a is 3, then append 5, set f true.\n\nElse if a is 5: append 7 and set f true.\n\nElse (if a is neither 3 nor 5): append '3' (and no f change?)\n\nWait in the case when the current a is 5:\n\nSo when processing the character at j=1 (second last digit):\n\na is '5', since the first digit (j=0) was '7', so the digits are 3 (hundreds?), 5 (tens?),7 (units). \n\nWait the example initial digit when i=357 is \"357\" as a string. Then:\n\nProcessing the loop starts with j from 0 to 2:\n\nFor j=0, the characters are the last one (position 2, char is '7')\n\nIn that case, appending '3', and f remains false? Because that's in the 'else' part (since a isn't 3 or 5?), so that code's \"else\" adds 3, leaving f as false.\n\nWait wait 'a' is 7 here, which doesn't hit the first two conditions (since 3 or 5), so goes to the else clause, so appends '3' and f remains false.\n\nThen, moving to the next j (1). The character is s.charAt(2 -1 -1? Wait let's see the calculation again.\n\nWait the loop is for j from 0 to s.length-1 (since j < s.length() )\n\nso for a string length 3:\n\nj takes 0,1,2\n\nfor each j, the index is s.length()-1 -j. \n\nSo:\n\nj=0: 2-0 \u21922 \u2192 char at index 2 \u2192 '7'\n\nj=1 \u21922-1=1 \u2192 s[1] \u2192 '5'\n\nj=2 \u21922-2=0 \u2192s[0] \u2192 '3'\n\nWait that's not the case I expected. The indexes are being reversed here. So the order of processing is '7','5','3', in the first iteration, since the j loop goes from 0 to 2, getting the reversed digits starting from the end.\n\nWait, that's the way the code is processing each digit, in reverse order (starting from the least significant digit, since that's the last character in the string).\n\nThen in each step:\n\nAt j=0 (processing the last digit: '7):\n\nf is initially false. \n\na is '7' \u2192 else clause \u2192 append '3' \u2192 f remains false? Or since it's in the else clause, the code doesn't set f?\n\nWait the code for the else block is only appending '3', and doesn't set f. So the f remains false.\n\nSo after j=0, the sb is \"3\" so far, and f is still false.\n\nMoving on to j=1.\n\na is the second to last digit, which is '5'.\n\nNow, f is still false. So check:\n\na = '5'.\n\nSo in the code: since it is a '5', so:\n\nappend '7', and set f = true.\n\nSo after this, f becomes true.\n\nNow, the sb is \"3\" + \"7\" \u2192 current value is \"37\".\n\nThen for j=2, the first character (3):\n\nNow, since f is now true. \n\nthe code checks \"if (f)\", which is true \u2192 so append the a (which is '3'). \n\nSo now the string becomes \"373\". Wait, no \u2014 let's see the steps again:\n\nThe loop runs j=2 next.\n\nAt this step:\n\na = s.charAt(0) \u2192 '3'.\n\nf is true now.\n\nSo since f is true, append a \u2192 '3'.\n\nThus, after all three steps (j=0,1,2):\n\nthe sb is concatenated as:\n\nj=0: append '3'\n\nj=1: append '7'\n\nj=2: append '3' \u2192 giving \"373\"?\n\nWait the internal order:\n\nThe sb starts empty.\n\nAfter processing each j step, the new character is added to the end of the string.\n\nWait wait, the code uses:\n\nfor each j, the characters are processed in the order from last digit first.\n\nWait the code is processing the digits in reverse (starting from the least significant digit).\n\nSo when building the 'sb', the first character added is for the least significant digit.\n\nWait let me think again. Let's see the code:\n\nfor each j in 0..2 (for the example):\n\nThe current digit (from the end) is '7', then '5', then '3'.\n\nThe first j step (j=0):\n\nAppend '3' \u2192 sb \u2192 \"3\".\n\nj=1 (a=5):\n\nAppend '7' (since in the then clause, because a=5 \u2192 added to the current \"3\", making \"37\".\n\nj=2 (a=3):\n\nAppend '3' (since f is now true \u2192 just append the a's value (3). So '3' is added to make \"373\".\n\nThen after the loop, check 'f' is true? so no addition after that. Else, if f is false, append 3.\n\nBut in this example, f was set to true in j=1 step. \n\nSo then the sb is \"373\" \u2192 then it is reversed again, to form the new number?\n\nWait wait, after the loop, the code's next step is:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \n\nand then reversing it and parsing as a long. \n\nWait the code says: sb2.reverse() \u2192 so the reversal is needed to get the right-order number?\n\nWait let me think: the digits were processed in the reversed order (since we start from the end of the original string). The code builds the next number by processing digits from back to front, perhaps creating a number with higher digits first?\n\nHmm, perhaps the logic is building the next number by increasing the digits in a certain order? Let me see:\n\nAfter building sb as \"373\", then reversing it would give \"373\", so the new number is 373 again, but that can't be, since the original loop started at 357. Hmm, maybe this is getting confusing. Perhaps the example with 357 would need more care.\n\nWait the first iteration, i is 357. the sb after processing would be:\n\nThe example steps give that the sb is \"373\"?\n\nThen reversing it would give \"373\", so the new i would be 373, which is indeed larger than 357, so next loop?\n\nWait then, next steps could proceed to 373 and so on. Wait, but how does the next number come up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should walk through the code's first steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's building the numbers by always appending 3/5/7 in some way, but in a way to generate all possible numbers with digits 3,5,7. \n\nWait perhaps the code is generating all possible numbers formed by 3,5,7 sorted in some order.\n\nBecause starting with 357, the code may incrementally build next numbers by adding a digit, but in a way following a pattern? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses breadth-first search-like approach to generate all numbers that consist of 3,5,7 and have at least one of each?\n\nThe Java code's loop: for each step i (starting at 357), and while i <= N, increment c if i meets the condition, then generate the next number to check.\n\nWait, but in each step, the next i is computed by some process. \n\nThe process of construction of next i is via the string manipulation described in the code. \n\nLet's try to see what happens with the first step (i=357):\n\nThe string s is \"357\".\n\nProcessing as per the code:\n\nsb is initially empty.\n\nLoop for j from 0 to length-1 (3 digits):\n\nfirst iteration (j=0):\n\na = '7'\n\nsince f is false, and a is not 3 or 5 \u2192 else clause.\n\nappend '3', f remains false.\n\nSecond iteration j=1:\n\na = '5'\n\nsince f is still false. \n\nCheck: a is '5', so append '7', set f = true.\n\nThird j=2: a is '3'\n\nnow f is true, so append '3'\n\nSo after the loop for the digits, the sb's content is '3' (from first iteration?), then '7', then '3', totaling \"373\". Wait no, first step: j=0 appends '3'; j=1 adds '7' \u2192 \"37\" + then '3' \u2192 \"373\". \n\nThen, since f was set in a previous step, after the for loop, check !f \u2192 which is false since f is true here, so the final step is the SB being 373 \u2192 then reverse it?\n\nWait, no. Wait sb2 is a StringBuffer of sb, so sb2 = sb which is 373, then we call reverse? \n\nWait the code is:\n\nsb2.reverse().toString() \u2192 \n\nThe original sb is \"373\" (assuming the example). \n\nReversing it would still be \"373\". \n\nWait, but in this case, the new i is still 373, so the loop continues? \n\nBut then next, in next iteration, i is now 373, so it will go again. \n\nThis seems possible. Hmm. Let me see this code's next step. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is building numbers in a way that each step appends a higher digit. \n\nWait, maybe the way they process the digits is that:\n\nThe process is building the next number by incrementally appending any of the higher numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's function is to step through all numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits, in the order of 3 as first digit, then 5, then 7. So starting with 357, then the next would be 357*10+3? Not sure.  \n\nWait perhaps the code is generating all numbers that consist of the digits 3/5/7, and contains at least each of them once. So the condition is the first part (contains 3,5,7 in its digits). \n\nTherefore, the code is processing numbers in this set, starting from the minimal one which is 357, and generating the next one each loop.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm generates each candidate, starting from 357, and the next number is built by a process that appends a digit or increments a digit? \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran involves a number of steps. First, read N from input. Then the loop starts at 357. The problem is, the while loop increments i through some logic that's handled via the number manipulation. \n\nNow, the key parts to translate:\n\n1. Reading N - easy: read(*,*) N.\n\n2. Initializing variables. Since variables in Fortran can be scalar. i is a long (integer*8?), because in Java, the i starts at 357 and could go up to N, which might be large (up to 1e18?), so in Fortran, need to use an 8-byte integer. Similarly, N must be 8-byte.\n\n3. the loop condition while (i <= N) \n\n4. The conversion of i to a string to check presence of 3,5,7.\n\nIn Fortran, converting a number to a string can be done with write and read statements or by using character arrays. \n\nThen, check if the string contains all three characters. \n\nThen the next part is building the next 'i' value via the logic in the java code's string modification. \n\nThe main challenge is the logic for generating the next number. \n\nLet me think about how the java code processes the current i's digits to get the next number. \n\nThe code takes the current number's digits as a string, processes them from the end (reverse order), building a string in the following way:\n\nStart with an empty string. For each digit from last to first (original order):\n\n- If 'f' is false (meaning we're still looking for a '3' to turn into '5', or '5' to '7', etc.):\n\n   - if the current digit is '3', then replace it with '5', set f to True, and append.\n\n   - if '5', replace with '7', set f to True, and append.\n\n   - else (e.g., a digit !=3 or 5, like 7?), replace with '3', and leave f as false (remain in this state).\n\nOnce f becomes true, we just append the next digits as they are. \n\nOnce all digits are processed, if f is still false (i.e., the loop didn't find a 3 or 5 to act on), then append a '3' to the end. \n\nWait, but the check is at the end:\n\nif (!f) \u2192 append 3 here? \n\nWait the code after the loop is:\n\nif (!f) sb.append(\"3\"); ?\n\nWait the code's part:\n\nafter for loop:\n\nif ( !f )  sb.append(3);\n\nWaitWait the code said:\n\n  if (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nWait the code says: \n\nif (!f) sb.append(\"3\"); ?\n\nWait in Java, sb is a string buffer, so:\n\n     if (!f) sb.append('3'); ?\n\nYes. The line is \"sb.append(3);\" \u2192 but in java that's an integer, which will cause an error for append(int) \u2192 since append with an int appends the char with that ASCII code. Wait that's a problem. Wait no, in the original Java code, there's a mistake here. \n\nWait looking at the Java code's original line:\n\n        if (!f) sb.append(3);\n\nWait that line would append a 3 as an integer, but the append(int) method appends the character with that int value, which would be the ASCII code for 3 (which is 51, which is '3' character). So this works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should have been:\n\n            if (!f) sb.append('3');\n\nBut the code uses append(3), which in Java is allowed (though appending char is more correct). So the code in the original is correct (as 3 as character code is correct for '3').\n\nSo that line appends a '3' to the end, if f was false. \n\nThen, after constructing the new string, it is reversed (because the initial processing was from the end, so the string is built in reverse order?), then parsed as long. \n\nWait the code:\n\nStringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(sb); \u2192 makes a copy of the sb?\n\nThen, sb2.reverse().toString();\n\nSo the original sb is the string built in the forward direction when processing. \n\nWait the processing loop is processing the digits from last digit to first (so for the original number 357, the code processes 7,5,3 in that order).\n\nWhen building the new string:\n\nIn the first example, for 357, after the loop, the sb would have \"3\",\"7\", \"3\" \u2192 the 3 comes from processing the last (7), then 5 becomes 7 (so next character is '5' \u2192 output '7', and then the first character (3 in the original string) after f is set to true, so it's added as is (so the 3 digit there is left as 3).\n\nWait, but the final string before reversing might be \"373\", then reversed would still be the same, so the next i is 373. \n\nWait but what about 357's next number?\n\nWait, perhaps the code builds numbers in a way such that each subsequent number is the next in a lexicographical ordering of numbers composed of 3,5,7 digits with each present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the code constructs the next number is similar to how numbers are generated in lex order, with 3 before 5 before7. \n\nSuppose current number is formed with the digits arranged in certain order. When generating next, it looks for the rightmost 3,5,7... but seems complex. \n\nSo in the case of 357, the first step allows transformation of the last digit (7) into a 3. \n\nWait, the problem is that in that case, the next number is smaller than 357, but that would not fit with the code's incrementing. \n\nHmm, maybe my analysis is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the process ensures that the numbers are always increasing? \n\nWait, in the example of 357, the generated next i would be 373, which is higher. \n\nThen the next step, for 373:\n\nProcessing digits would be 3 s:\n\nDigits: 3 (hundreds?), 7, 3 again (wait the number 373's digits are [3,7,3]\n\nSo the digits are 3,7,3 \u2192 their reversed processing would be from the last digit (3).\n\nLet me walk through another example. Let's process 373:\n\ni is 373, so s is \"373\"\n\nlength is 3. \n\nProcessing:\n\nf initialized to false.\n\nloop for j from 0 to 2 (digits processed in order 3 (j=0: index s.length() -1 -j \u2192 for j=0: 2? Wait no, indexes:\n\nWait for j=0: \n\nthe index is s.length-1 -0 \u2192 2 (since length is 3 \u2192 3-1=2-so the third character is 3 (the third digit of \"373\" is 3, which is the units digit.\n\nWait s is \"3\" (hundreds?), '7' (middle), '3' (units).\n\nProcessing j=0 \u2192 index 2 (the third character '3'):\n\nSince f is false, check the character '3' \u2192 it's a '3', so append '5' and set f = true.\n\nThen, next j=1 \u2192 index s.length -1 -1 = 1 (middle digit is '7').\n\nSince f is now TRUE, so append that character (7) as-is (since in 'if (f)' part? Wait code:\n\nif (f) \u2192 then:\n\n   sb.append(a)\n\nelse \u2192 process the previous steps. \n\nWait at j=1, a is the second digit now: the middle digit '7' (s's second digit (s is \"373\", so index 2 is third digit, first is index 0 as '3').\n\nWait j=0 for \"373\" gives a = s(3-1-0) \u2192 2 \u2192 third character: 3,\n\nthen j=1 \u2192 s(3-1-1)=s(1) is '7',\n\nj=2 \u2192 s(0) '3'.\n\nProcessing each step:\n\nAfter j=0: \n\nWe have a=3 \u2192 so append '5' and set f to true. \n\nThen j=1 (a is '7') \n\nsince f is already true, append '7'.\n\nj=2 (a is '3', f is true \u2192 append '3'\n\nThus the sb after the loop is \"5\" (from j=0) plus \"7\" (from j=1), then \"3\" (from j=2) \u2192 so overall \"573\".\n\nThen, the code checks if f was set (it was \u2192 yes), so the 'if !f' does not append anything. \n\nThen the sb is \"573\". Reversing it (since sb2 is new String buffer of sb \u2192 then reverse \u2192 so reversing \"573\" would produce 375? or no \u2192 wait the reverse of \"573\" would produce \"375\".\n\nWait no. Wait the original sb is built as 5 (from first step), then 7 and 3, so the string is \"573\".\n\nReversing \"573\" gives \"375\"? Wait no, reversing the string 5-7-3 would be 3-7-5 \u2192 \"375\".\n\nWait yes, so when reversed, the string is \"375\".\n\nThus the new i would be 375? \n\nWait but the original i was 373? So moving from 373 to 375? Which is indeed higher.\n\nWait so after that step, next i is 375. \n\nProcessing digits of 375 would then check the digits. \n\nThus the algorithm steps through the numbers in a way that increases them.\n\nThus, the loop processes numbers in the order 357, 373, 375, etc., as generated by the string modification. \n\nThe problem's Java code's loop uses this method to iterate each candidate number. \n\nThe key now is to translate this into Fortran.\n\nFirst, let's recap the main steps:\n\nLoop while i <= N:\n\n   Convert i to string s.\n\n   Check if s contains '3', '5', and '7'. If yes, increment c by 1.\n\n   Generate next number i by:\n\n      Process each digit of s in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n         build a new string according to rules involving a flag f.\n\n      append '3' at the end if f wasn't set.\n\n      reverse the new string to form next i.\n\nNow to implement in Fortran:\n\nHandling string manipulation is needed, but Fortran is a bit stricter.\n\nStep 1: Read input N. \n\nThese numbers can be up to 1e18 (maybe, since in the problem's constraints). So we need to use integer(8) variables. \n\nThe Java code uses Long.parseLong, but in Fortran, perhaps handling non-allocatable variables is tricky. \n\nBut first, variables needed:\n\ni: type integer(8). \n\ninitial i = 357.\n\ncount c: integer. \n\nThe process for the next i is the most complex part. \n\nStep to code the generation of the next i. \n\nLet's think about each part. Let's first implement the loop.\n\nThe main loop is something like:\n\ninteger*8 :: N, i, next_i \n\ni=357\n\nc = 0 \n\nread*, N \n\ndo while (i <= N)\n\n   ... \n\n   compute next_i based on the steps \n\nloop \n\nBut the core is writing a function or block that takes the string (of i's value) and returns next_i.\n\nLet me consider the code structure.\n\nFirst, convert the current i into a string. \n\nIn Fortran, the way to convert an integer to a string with the desired representation can be done with an internal read or write statement.\n\nFor example:\n\ncharacter(100) :: s\nwrite(s, '(I10)') i\ns = trim(adjustl(s))\n\nWait but maybe better with a specific length. \n\nAlternatively, to get the number into a string, perhaps using:\n\ncharacter(len= * ) statements? Not sure, need to be cautious. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, you can use the intrinsic function num2str, but I don't think that's standard. Instead:\n\ninteger(8) :: i = some value \n\n! Get the number of digits:\n\ndigits = 1 \n\ntemp = i\n\nif (temp ==0) then digits=1\n\ndo while (temp /= 0)\n\n   digits +=1 \n\n   temp = temp /10\n\nenddo \n\nBut that could be error-prone. Alternatively, the best approach is to convert to string using write:\n\ncharacter(20) s\n\nwrite(s,*) i \n\nthen trim leading spaces, but maybe better using a format that avoids any obvious.\n\nWait, using:\n\nwrite(s, '(I20)') i \n\nthis will format it as 20-digit, so the spaces before are zeros? No, it pads with spaces on the left. \n\nHmm, so to get rid of leading spaces:\n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nThen, the length of the string is len_trim(s).\n\nThis string can be processed character by character, similar to Java's code.\n\nOnce s is the string representation, processing starts.\n\nNext, Check for presence of '3','5','7':\n\nIn Fortran, to check if a character is present in the string.\n\nlogical :: has3, has5, has7 \n\nhas3 = .false.\n\nhas5 = .false.\n\nhas7 = .false.\n\ndo k=1, len_trim(s)\n\n   if (s(k:k) == '3') has3 = .true. \n\n   if (s(k:k) == '5') has5 = .true. \n\n   if (s(k:k) == '7') has7 = .true.\n\nenddo\n\nif (has3 .and. has5 .and. has7) then \n\n   c = c +1 \n\nendif \n\nThat's the count part.\n\nNow, the next step is generating next_i.\n\nSo to generate next_i:\n\nThe algorithm in the code:\n\n1. Process the digits from last to first (i.e., from least significant digit to most?)\n\nWait processing the digits in reverse order (since in Java, the loop j goes from 0 to len-1, getting the first character as last digit). \n\nThus in Fortran, the first character to process is s(len_trim)\u200b\n\nthe last character.\n\nThe program Processing each character in the reversed order to build the next number.\n\nLet me try to code this:\n\nInitialize variables for the next string.\n\nThe code uses a string buffer, which in Fortran can be implemented with a character array with a dynamic length, but since string length is variable, we can assume it won't exceed, say, 20 digits (safe for up to 1e20). \n\nDeclare chars as character(20) :: new_str, etc.\n\nInitialize new_str as empty (or filled with space? need to track actual positions).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a character array with a length appropriate for the maximum N (if we know N's maximum, but in code, better to use adaptative length.\n\nAlternatively, loop through the characters in reversed order and construct new_str step by step.\n\nHere's the plan step by step for the next i:\n\nProcessing each original digit from last to first.\n\nSteps:\n\nInitialize:\n\nnew_str \u2014 null.\n\nflag f (logical) = .false.\n\nprocess the first character (original last digit):\n\nLoop over each original digit in reverse order (from last to first):\n\nfor idx in 1 to len(s):\n\n   original digit position: pos = len(s) - idx? Or perhaps an index over all characters from the last to first.\n\nWait let's think in terms of the Fortran s string.\n\ns is the string of current i, stored as a zero-padded but adjusted string, and already adjusted to non-spaced.\n\nThe length is l = len_trim(s).\n\nSo to process the digits in reverse order, start from the end of the string.\n\nLoop over i_char from l downto 1:\n\nWait in Fortran, the loop:\n\ndo i_char = l,1,-1\n\n   current_char = s(i_char:i_char)\n\nend do\n\nSo, for the first character (the '7' in \"357\"), this would be when i_char =3 (for 3 characters)\n\nThen, for each character in current_char, we decide what to append.\n\nProcessing:\n\nfor each character in the reversed order, build new_str:\n\nnew_str starts as empty.\n\nflag f is .false.\n\nthen during each iteration:\n\n   current_char = s(i_char)\n\n   if .not. f then:\n\n       if current_char == '3', then:\n\n          append '5' to new_str, set f to .true.\n\n       else if current_char == '5':\n\n          append '7', set f to .true.\n\n       else:\n\n          append '3', leave f as false.\n\n   else:\n\n       append current_char to new_str.\n\nProceed until all char processed.\n\nAfter processing, if f is still false \u2192 append a '3' to the end of new_str.\n\nThen, to reverse the new_str to get the actual next_i value.\n\nWait but how is the new_str built?\n\nWait in the Java code, the processing order is:\n\nthey build the new string as follows:\n\nstart with empty, and for each character processed from original's last (i.e., i_char = l downto 1), and appending characters to the new_str (each step adding to what's already there?), so the new_str builds in order.\n\nWait in Java code:\n\nthe for loop processes in the order s(l) then s(l-1) ... s(1):\n\nfor each of them, the new_str builds the new code as:\n\nthe first character processed (last digit of original) is first decision.\n\nso for example with 357's first processing:\n\nthe first digit (7) \n\nthen first in for loop:\n\nf is false, so the '7' goes through the else clause: appending '3' to new_str, and f remains false.\n\nSecond digit in the loop (5):\n\nf is still false.\n\nCheck: '5' is the char \u2192 so if yes (current char is '5'), then append '7', set f=true.\n\nThird step (3):\n\nthen f is now true, so append the '3'.\n\nNew_str after all is '3', '7', '3' \u2192 373, then reversed to get 373 (since reversed 373 is same).\n\nWait, but the java code's final code is:\n\nonce the new_str is built, it calls reverse on it, so:\n\nthe new_str (after appending all the steps) is stored in a SB which is then reversed and parsed.\n\nThus:\n\nThe string is built in the order of processing the digits from last to first. \n\nBut the new_str is built in a way that each step appends to the end of the new string. The new_str thus represents the digits, order being the first processed (original last digit) as the first in new_str.\n\nThen the reversal is needed to return to the correct digit order.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nProcessing s=\"357\" gives new_str = \"3\" (from first step) then \"37\", then \"373\". Then the code does reverse, which would give \"373\", so that when read as an integer, it's 373, but reversed would be same.\n\nWait in the string \"373\" reversed is still same, so that works.\n\nAnother example with 3\u219273 (original s=\"357\" gives next i=373, so yes).\n\nWait so the process is that after the for loop building new_str, the new string is then reversed to form the next number's digits in the correct order. \n\nWait, actually, the new string's digits are the next digits but in reverse. Hence need reversal to get the actual number.\n\nWait that's confusing. Let me think: \n\nSuppose the original digits are \"abcdefg\".\n\nThe processing loops over the digits in reverse order (starting with 'g', then 'f',..., first 'a').\n\nEach step appends to the new_str's end the transformed digit.\n\nThus the new_str after processing the first digit 'g' will be \"x\" (e.g. '3' for 7), then processing 'f' gives a second character, then 'e', etc. so the result new_str is \"???... some sequence depending on processing\". \n\nTo get the next number's digits correctly, we must reverse the new_str string. \n\nYes, because the way it's being built is left to right as the original Last digit first, so reversal combines them back to original first to last order. \n\nThus the code's 'reverse' is essential.\n\nThus the algorithm steps in Fortran:\n\nAfter processing all the characters from end to start, building the new_str as in steps, and appending a '3' to the end if f remains false, then reversing the new_str, and converting to integer.\n\nThus, to implement this in Fortran:\n\nWe can:\n\nInitialize new_str as a character (20) array with blank.\n\nInitialize f as .false.\n\ncurrent_length =0.\n\nloop over each digit in reverse order (i_char from l downto 1)\n\nthen: \n\ncurrent_char = s(i_char:i_char)\n\nif (.not. f) then\n\n   if current_char == '3':\n\n       new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '5'\n\n       current_length +=1\n\n       f = .true.\n\n   else if current_char == '5':\n\n       new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '7'\n\n       current_length +=1\n\n       f = .true.\n\n   else\n\n       new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '3'\n\n       current_length +=1 \n\n       ! f remains .false.\n\n   else \n\n       !Else? (if current_char is not 3 5 7?)\n\n       !However, the original problem's next number is built only for numbers with all 3/5/7? \n\nWait but in the Java code's problem, input N can be up to what? \n\nProbably the original i's digits are always composed of 3/5/7. Because the algorithm starts with 357, and then appends digits only from 3,5,7? \n\nWait the algorithm is building numbers by adding digits in a way that only appends allowed digits. Thus the current i's digits are all 3/5/7.\n\nTherefore, the current_char will only be '3', '5', or '7'.\n\nThus the else clause (for current_char is neither 3, nor5) \u2192 but that won't ever happen? But our code can process it anyway.\n\nContinuing, else clause: append '3' to new_str, current_length +1, and f remains false.\n\nElse, if f is already true, then we just append the current_char to new_str.\n\n   else:\n\n      new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = current_char \n\n      current_length +=1 \n\nAfter processing all characters:\n\nif f remains .false. then append '3' to new_str. \n\nThen, reverse new_str(1:current_length) \u2192 which is the string in the correct order.\n\nFinally, convert that reversed string to an integer(8) to get next_i. \n\nWait the code is:\n\nReversed_str = reverse(new_str)\n\nThese steps in code.\n\nThus in Fortran code.\n\nHandling the new_str:\n\nSince we can't dynamically grow a string, but in fortran fixed size. We can set new_str as a 20-digit string (assuming max N is manageable within 20 digits), but we have to track the length properly. \n\nHere's pseudocode for the processing:\n\nl = len_trim(s)\n\nf = .false.\n\ncurrent_length = 0\n\ndo i_char = l, 1, -1\n\n  current_char = s(i_char:i_char)\n\n  if (.not. f) then \n\n    if (current_char == '3') then \n\n      new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '5'\n\n      f = .true.\n\n      current_length = current_length +1 \n\n    else if (current_char == '5') then \n\n      new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '7'\n\n      f = .true.\n\n      current_length = current_length +1 \n\n    else if (current_char == '7') then \n\n      new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = '3'\n\n      current_length = current_length +1 \n\n    else\n\n      ! Shouldn't occur unless s has invalid digits.\n\n    end if \n\n  else \n\n    new_str(current_length+1:current_length+1) = current_char \n\n    current_length = current_length +1 \n\n  end if \n\nend do \n\nif (.not.f) then \n\n  current_length = current_length +1 \n\n  new_str(current_length:current_length) = '3' \n\nend if \n\n! now reverse the new_str(1:current_length)\n\n! reverse the string \n\nreversed_str = reverse(new_str(1:current_length))\n\n! reversed_str is now the correct string for next_i.\n\nTherefore, we need a function to reverse a string in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, we can loop through and build the reversed_str manually.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nfunction reverse_str(s) result(res)\n\ninteger, parameter :: str_len = len_trim(s)\n\ncharacter(len=str_len) res\n\nres = ''\n\ndo i =1, str_len \n\n   res(i:i) = s(str_len +1 -i : str_len +1 -i )\n\nend do \n\nend function \n\nAlternatively, inside the code, we can reverse the new_str.\n\nHere's the code:\n\nAfter constructing new_str up to current_length:\n\nrev_length = current_length \n\nrev_str = \" \"*rev_length\n\ndo i = 1, current_length \n\n   rev_str(i:i) = new_str(current_length +1 -i : current_length +1 -i )\n\nend do \n\nThus the rev_str will hold the reversed characters.\n\nThen convert rev_str to the next_i:\n\n read(rev_str,*) next_i \n\nBut in practice, use an integer*8 value:\n\ninteger(8) next_i \n\nread(rev_str,*) next_i \n\nThus, the process for building next_i is implemented.\n\nNow putting all the steps together into Fortran code.\n\nNow, possible concerns:\n\nVar handling of strings. The conversion of i to string may lead to leading spaces if the i is small (like 357 may be represented as e.g. \"357 \" with trailing spaces in a fixed-size string, unless properly trimmed.\n\nHence, in Fortran, to get the string correctly, the write statement with an asterisk may include leading spaces which must be adjust.\n\nWait, the safest way is:\n\nwrite(s, '(I20)') i \n\ns = adjustl(s)\n\nso that s is filled with the left-justified string. \n\nFor example i=357: s would be '357' with the rest of the 20 chars being spaces, then after adjustl, the s becomes '357' followed by spaces which are irrelevant, but when using len_trim(s), only the '3', '5', '7' are considered.\n\nBut when processing the loop for i_char from len_trim(s) down to 1, we only process the real digits.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ncharacter(20) :: s_str, new_str, rev_str \n\n...\n\nwrite(s_str, '(I20)') i \n\ns_str = adjustl(s_str)\n\nl = len_trim(s_str)\n\nThen loop over i_char from l downto 1 ... \n\nThus, variables can be declared inside the loop. \n\nNow putting all together.\n\nThe detailed steps:\n\nThe main program will look like:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc114_c \n\n  implicit none \n\n  integer(8) :: N, i, next_i \n\n  integer :: c =0 \n\n  read*, N \n\n  i = 357_8\n\n  ! main loop \n\n  do while (i <= N) \n\n     ! process i to check and compute next_i \n\n     ! step 1: convert i tostring \n\n     character(20) :: s_str \n\n     write(s_str '(I20)') i \n\n     s_str = adjustl(s_str) \n\n     integer :: l = len_trim(s_str) \n\n     ! check count condition \n\n     logical :: has3, has5, has7 \n\n     has3 = .false. \n\n     has5 = .false. \n\n     has7 = .false. \n\n     integer :: k \n\n     do k =1, l \n\n        select case (s_str(k:k)) \n\n           case('3')  \n\n              has3 = .true. \n\n           case('5') \n\n              has5 = .true. \n\n           case('7') \n\n              has7 = .true. \n\n           case default \n\n              !

Let me check the increment:\n\nWait the new_str is built correctly, but when reversed, the order should be maintained correctly. \n\nWait in the part of reversing the new_str:\n\noriginal new_str is constructed as:\n\n for i_char from l down to 1 (reverse order of digits):\n\n thus, for example, the first digit processed (last digit of original number) was '7' in 357, which resulted in appending '3' to new_str (since '7', appended '3', f remains false until next iteration).\n\nWait, the key part is in the reversal code:\n\nFor rev_str: \n\nrev_str(j) = new_str(current_length -j +1:j=1..current_length) ?\n\nWait the code currently has:\n\nrev_str(j:j) = new_str(current_length -j +1 : current_length -j +1 )\n\nSo for j from 1 to current_length.\n\nThus, for j=1: position current_length \u2192 the last character of new_str\n\nso the last character is first in the reversed string.\n\nTherefore the reversed_str is correct.\n\nAn example:\n\nUsing previous example 357 \u2192 new_str is built as \"3 7 3\" (after first loop steps):\n\nwhen l =3, the processing \n\nFor i_char =3: \n\ncurrent_char is '7' \u2192 which is case '7' \u2192 new_str first position becomes '3, current_length =1, f remains false?\n\nWait let's step through:\n\nProcessing 357's s_str is '357' (without spaces).\n\nLoop over i_char from 3 down to1:\n\nFirst iteration i_char=3 (the last digit, '7')\n\nf is false:\n\ncurrent_char is '7' \u2192 case '7' \u2192 \n\nnew_str(1:1) = '3', current_length 1, f remains false?\n\nYes, because case '7' sets f =? \n\nWait in the code:\n\ncase '7':\n\n        current_length +=1 (to 1)\n\n        new_str(1) = '3'\n\n        (f remains false? yes. Because the code sets 'f = .true.' only for cases '3' and '5'\n\nWait '7' appends '3' and doesn't set f.\n\nThus, after this step, f remains false until later steps?\n\nContinuing with i_char=2: which is '5'.\n\nAt this point, f is still false.\n\ncurrent_char is '5'. \n\nNow case '5':\n\n\u2192 append '7' to new_str(2:2), current_length becomes 2. set f = true.\n\nNow f is true.\n\ni_char=1 (original first digit is '3')\n\ncurrent_char is '3' \u2192 since f is now true.\n\nso append that '3' to new_str(3:3) (current_length becomes 3).\n\nAfter processing all, current_length is 3. \n\nf is true \u2192 so no appending to new_str.\n\nThus new_str is '3','7', '3' \u2192 \"373\".\n\nReversing this would mean:\n\nrev_str is 3 characters: rev_str(1)= new_str(3), rev_str(2)= new_str(2), rev_str(3)= new_str(1)\n\nThus, rev_str is \"373\", which is correct. \n\nNext_i is 373.\n\nThus the code works in this case.\n\nAnother example with i=373:\n\ns_str is '373'\n\nlength 3.\n\nLoop through i_char 3,2,1:\n\ni_char=3: current_char is '3'.\n\nf is false.\n\ncase '3' \u2192 append '5', set f=true. \n\nnew_str current_length 1: '5'\n\ni_char=2 \u2192 current_char '7'.\n\nsince f is true, append to new_str(2) as '7', length is now 2.\n\ni_char=1 \u2192 current_char is '3'. \n\nf is true, so append as is: '3' \u2192position3 of new_str.\n\nThus new_str after processing: '5','7', '3' \u2192 '573'.\n\nf is true (since first step was '3' \u2192 set f to true.\n\nThus no appending after loop. \n\nThen reversing:\n\nrev_str would be \"375\"? Wait no:\n\nnew_str is \"573\" \u2192 reversed is 375 (3 first, 7 next, 5 last?)\n\nWait the new_str after processing is '5','7','3' \u2192 the characters are in:\n\npositions 1:5, 2:7, 3:3.\n\nReversing this string would be '3','7','5' \u2192 making the string '375', so the rev_str is \"375\" \u2192 read as 375. \n\nThus the next_i is 375. \n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus the code works that way.\n\nKnown potential issues:\n\n- Handling numbers where f remains false: appended a '3' at the end.\n\nE.g., if processing '7':\n\nprocessing '7' (i=7? but i is first 357). So initial numbers won't have such.\n\nBut the algorithm should build starting at 357 and only adding digits.\n\nThus the code should be correct.\n\nNow, for the initialization:\n\nNote that when converting the rev_str to next_i, but in Fortran, if the reversal produces leading spaces, the read statement might have problems. So when the rev_str has leading spaces (e.g. if the new_str has a space in the reversed part?), no. Because the new_str was prepended with blanks but then the rev_str is built as:\n\nWe have initialized rev_str as ' ' * len, but then the loop over each character set the jth position of rev_str as the reversed new_str character.\n\nBut the new_str's length is current_length, which is non-zero.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nrev_str is declared as a variable of length current_length. That won't work as it's a local variable. Oh, no: wait in the present pseudo-code, rev_str is declared inside the loop as a fixed variable:\n\nWait in the current Fortran code outline I wrote:\n\n     rev_str = ' ' \n\n     do j =1,current_length \n\n        rev_str(j:j) = new_str(current_length -j +1 : current_length -j +1 )\n\n     end do \n\nBut if rev_str is declared with len = current_length, but in fortran, variables cannot be size-dependent in a loop. So this approach is problematic. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to have rev_str as a large enough array.\n\nThus, the code should instead declare new_str and rev_str as 20-character variables.\n\nBut in Fortran, the dummy rev_str can be set similar to new_str.\n\nThus, proper code would have:\n\ncharacter(20) rev_str \n\n...\n\nrev_str = \" \" \n\n! but then resetting to blanks \n\nrev_str = repeat(' ',20)\n\nthen looping for j up to current_length:\n\ndo j=1, current_length \n\n   rev_str(j:j) = new_str(current_length - j +1 : current_length -j +1 )\n\nend do \n\nrev_str(current_length+1:) is kept as space, but when reading, trailing spaces ignored. \n\nThus, the read statment uses rev_str appropriately.\n\nSo, revisiting the code:\n\nIn the part where building rev_str:\n\n   rev_str = ' ' \n\n   Then loop:\n\n   rev_str(j:j) = ... \n\nBut the initialized rev_str could just be the same len as the new_str.\n\nBut in Fortran, the code can be:\n\ncharacter(20) rev_str \n\nrev_str(1:current_length) = \" \" \n\n! or just assign into the characters:\n\nfor j= 1 to current_length \n\n rev_str(j:j) = new_str(current_length -j +1:j=...)\n\nThe rest of the string (positions > current_length) can be left as whatever (since read ignores those).\n\nThus the code can proceed as:\n\nThus the corrected code would have:\n\n    integer(8) next_i \n\n    ! Reversing the new_str \n\n    integer :: cl = current_length \n\n    character(20) rev_str = \" \" \n\n    do j =1, cl \n\n       rev_str(j:j) = new_str(cl -j +1:cl -j +1 ) \n\n    end do \n\n    ! Now read the rev_str \n\n    read(rev_str(1:cl),*) next_i \n\nBecause in fortran's read, you can specify rev_str(1:cl), which is the part filled.\n\nThis way, trailing spaces are not part of the read. \n\nThus this should work.\n\nAnother potential issue: if current_str is larger than possible to fit into a 20-digit rev_str. But given the problem's constraints (N is up to 10^18, which is 18 digits), so 20 digits are sufficient. \n\nThus, the code is manageable.\n\nThus the final Fortran code can be written as:\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe final code would resemble this:\n\nThe full code is:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc114_c\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer(8) :: N, i, next_i, c\n\n  c = 0\n\n  read(*, *) N\n\n  i = 357_8\n\n  !
