Wait, the Java code says:\n\nfor (Edge e : g.get(to)) {\n     ... if(k == color) k++;\n        ans[e.id] = k; dfs(e.to, k, to);\n        k++;\n}\n\nWait, the loop processes all edges (except parent ones) in the adjacency list's order, and for each, it assigns k to ans, then moves to the next. Wait let me parse it step by step. The code is:\n\nk starts at 1.\n\nfor all edges (for e in edges):\n\n    if the edge leads back to parent (e.to == parents) \u2192 skip. then \u2192 \n\n     if k == color \u2192 then, increment k by 1 (choose next color so that it doesn't match the parent's edge's color). assign ans[e.id] = k.\n\n    then call dfs(e.to, k, to)\n\n    then after that, increment k by 1 (so next edge uses higher color) Wait the sequence is crucial here. The parent's edge has color 'color', so the current node's edges must choose a color that is not 'color', starting with k=1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the code does. \n\nThe Java code is solving a problem where you have a tree structure and you need to assign colors to edges such that no two edges from the same node have the same color. Then it finds the maximum color used and outputs all the colors. The main function reads input, builds the graph as an adjacency list, performs a DFS traversal to assign colors, and then prints the results.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to represent the adjacency list in Fortran. In Java, they use ArrayLists of Edge objects. Since Fortran doesn't have objects, I have to find an alternative. Maybe I can use arrays or a linked list-like structure. Alternatively, since the edges are bidirectional and we need edge identifiers, perhaps an array of linked lists where each edge in the list has the target node and the edge ID.\n\nWait, in the Java code, each Edge has an ID (the 'id' field) and the target node. The ID probably corresponds to the index in the original problem's edges list, which in the code is based on the iteration from 0 to n-2. Let me see the initial loop in the main function: for i from 0 to n-2 (since n-1 edges), when adding an edge between a and b, each adds an Edge with id = i and respective to the other node. So each edge between a and b has the same id. \n\nBut in Fortran, arrays start from 1 or 0? The default is 1-based, so maybe I'll have to handle indices properly. Also, considering Fortran's array limitations, especially for variable-length arrays. Hmm, Fortran 90+ allows allocatable arrays but for adjacency lists, it's a bit tricky. Maybe we can pre-allocate arrays based on the maximum possible number of edges, but since the graph is a tree (so each node has up to n-1 edges), but the tree structure has exactly n-1 edges. Wait, the adjacency list for a tree with n nodes can have size n arrays, each with up to n-1 edges, but in practice for each node, the number of edges is its degree. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the adjacency lists as arrays of structures. But structures in Fortran can be a bit old-school.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using dynamic arrays. Since Fortran supports allocatable arrays but in a limited way for complex structures. For example, perhaps each edge can be represented by an array of lists, where each list contains the target node and the edge ID.\n\nLet me consider that first, the Edge class in Java has two integer fields: id and to. In Fortran, perhaps we can create an array for each node's edges. Each entry in the adjacency list for a node can hold an ID and a to (target node) value.\n\nWait, in Java's code, the Edge's 'id' is determined when the edge is created, so for each of the n-1 edges, they are added in a loop where the index i (from 0 to n-2) is the id. Each edge between a and b is added twice: once from a to b and once from b to a, each with the same id. Therefore, when storing the edges in the adjacency lists, the direction is considered, but the edge's ID is the same for both directions.\n\nIn the Java code, the Edge's 'id' is the parameter passed to the Edge constructor (the first argument is 'i', the loop index). So each edge in the list (for both nodes a and b) will have that edge's ID. The problem requires that for each node, the edges going out from it must have distinct colors. However, when they traverse, the 'ans' array stores the color for each edge's ID, so that the two directed edges (a to b and b to a) share the same ID and thus the same color in ans.\n\nWait the problem's task is to color the edges such that the edges from the same node to its children along the tree don't have the same color. So the code uses DFS to assign colors in a way that ensures this.\n\nNow, moving on to translation. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, the main variables in Java:\n\n- n is the number of nodes (static variables but in Fortran, probably module variables or module constants)\n\n- g is a list of ArrayLists of Edge objects. In Fortran, perhaps an array of linked lists. Hmm, that's tricky. Alternatively, since we can know n at the beginning, we can pre-allocate arrays. Let's think, for each node, the edges connected to it. So, an array of edges for each node. But in Fortran, you can use arrays of derived types.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nDefine a derived type Edge with ID and to:\ntype :: Edge\ninteger :: id, to\nend type Edge\n\nThen the adjacency list is an array of type Edge, but each node may have variable-length edges.\n\nHmm. There's a problem here because Fortran arrays must have fixed lengths. To handle variable-length adjacency lists, perhaps the best is to have an array of pointers or lists implemented with allocatable arrays. Alternatively, since the maximum number of edges for each node is n-1, but overkill perhaps, but possible to pre-allocate.\n\nAlternatively, using an adjacency list implemented with linked lists. But linked lists are not straightforward in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is a tree, we can represent the adjacency list as two arrays for each node: one for the target nodes, another for the IDs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to pre-allocate the maximum possible edges for each node and forgo dynamic sizing. Since it's a tree, each node has degree up to n-1. But let's see:\n\nIn Fortran code, perhaps first, after reading n, we can:\n\n- Read all edges (n-1 edges) first, then for each node, count the edges, then construct an adjacency list with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Fortran, the adjacency list can be represented with an array of linked lists. But linked lists are more tedious to manage in Fortran.\n\nAlternatively, another way to structure the problem.\n\nThe code uses a DFS approach to assign colors. The Edge's ID is used to reference entries in the ans array. The 'dfs' function visits nodes and assigns the next available color (ensuring it's different from the parent's edge's color). \n\nGiven that, perhaps structuring nodes and edges in a way that when processing a node, I can iterate through its edges.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can have an array for the adjacent nodes and their edge IDs.\n\nPerhaps in Fortran, after reading all edges, we can organize for each node, a list of connected nodes along with the edge ID.\n\nHere's a plan:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Read n-1 edges. Each edge (a,b) has an ID from 0 to n-2. Since the problem's input is \n\nWait, in the java code:\n\nThe edges are read as a and b, then they are each converted to 0-based indices (since we subtract 1). Then, the code adds an Edge with id = i (the loop index from 0 to n-2), and the 'to' is the other node.\n\nTherefore, the Edge id is the 0-based index of the edge in the list. But for Fortran, perhaps the code will store the edges, and arrays can start at 1.\n\nWait, maybe in Fortran it's better to use 1-based indices for nodes (assuming input nodes are given in 1-based and then converted to 0-based in Java code, but maybe the problem's nodes are numbered from 1 to n in the input, so in Fortran we can read them as ints and not subtract 1, perhaps adjust in processing.\n\nHmm, the problem's input details are important here. Since Java code converts a and b to 0-based (by subtracting 1 since the problem likely reads nodes from 1-based in input). So in Fortran, to make it compatible with the problem's input, I can keep a and b as read from input (if the problem numbers nodes from 1), so they don't need to be adjusted. Wait, in the code, a and b are taken via sc.next(), which gives them as per problem's input (presumably starting at 1?), then subtract 1. So the Java code processes 0-based indices for the nodes. In Fortran, perhaps better to use 0-based indices as well, so the nodes are stored from 0 to n-1. Therefore, read a and b from input, subtract 1 to get into the correct indices.\n\nAlright, moving to structure:\n\nWe can create an array for each node's edges. Each edge has a 'to' and an 'id' (the edge's id as per the edge's order in input).\n\nSince edges are bidirectional, for each a and b, two entries are added in their adjacency lists:\n\nFor a, add an Edge with id = current edge count (starting from 0), and 'to' = b.\n\nSimilarly, for b, add an Edge with same id and 'to'=a.\n\nWait, each of the loops in the for loop for edge creation:\n\nThe loop runs from i =0 to n-2.\n\nfor each of the a and b from input, they add to g for a and for b.\n\nWait, in the java code, the loop is for (int i =0 to n-2; i++) { ... }, because there are n-1 edges. So each edge is processed with i from 0 to n-2. So the Edge object's id is i. So the edge ID is unique to each edge. So in Fortran's terms, each entry in the adjacency list will need to store the edge's id (i) as stored in Java's case.\n\nThus, Edge.id is the edge's number in the list of edges, from 0 up.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nThe edges' direction is handled in both nodes, but each has the same id. So whenever accessing ans[edge.id], it corresponds to the same edge's color in both directions.\n\nNow, how to represent the adjacency lists:\n\nAssuming in Fortran code, we can have an array for each node, storing the list of edges (to node and edge id). Since in Fortran arrays have to be known size, perhaps the following approach:\n\nFirst, since the graph is a tree, the total number of edges for each node is equal to their degree. But pre-allocating for each node's edges based on their degree is a bit of a problem. Alternatively, we can store all edges in two arrays for each node: one for the to nodes and one for the edge ids. To handle dynamic arrays, we can use a list of linked lists, but that's tricky. Alternatively, we can pre-allocate for each node an edge array with a size of maximum possible degree (which for n nodes is n-1). So for each node, an array of size n (to allow for 0-based index and up to n-1 edges).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use an approach with a dynamic array structure. Fortran's allocatable arrays can be used in derived types to represent linked lists, but this may complicate.\n\nAnother idea: Since each edge between a and b has an id, and for each node, we just need to access all edges connected to it. So perhaps both nodes have entries in their adjacency lists with the id of the edge.\n\nSince edges go both ways, each edge is represented twice, once in each node's adjacency list. The key is that when we process an edge from a to b, we treat it as part of the adjacency of a with id=i, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best is to use an array of lists using allocatable arrays in Fortran 90.\n\nWait here's how it could work:\n\nThe main variables:\n\n- n: integer.\n\n- Edge data structure: \n\ntype Edge\n    integer :: id, to\nend type Edge\n\n- The adjacency list 'g' as an array of linked lists. However, in Fortran, we can use dynamic arrays with deferred shape, but perhaps better to structure g as an array of linked lists, where for each node's adjacency list, we have an array of Edge elements, with the length determined at runtime.\n\nAlternatively, since every edge has two entries (one in a's list, one in b's list), perhaps we can store the edges in two separate arrays for each direction: for nodes a and b, we add entries in each's adjacency lists with the edge id.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps pre-allocate arrays. Since the total number of edges is exactly n-1, each node's edges count is the degree, but we can keep an array for the edges connected to each node, with a list of their to and id.\n\nPerhaps in code steps:\n\nFirst, after reading n, allocate arrays to read edges.\n\nWe can first read all edges into temporary arrays, then compute for each node the number of edges (degree), then allocate the adjacency lists with the correct size.\n\nWait, here's the step-by-step process for handling the adjacency lists:\n\nStep 1: Read n.\n\nStep 2: Read n-1 edges. For each edge a and b.\n\nWe can store all edges first into two arrays, from_edge (array of a's) and to_edge (array of b's), but also each edge has an index (id from 0 to n-2).\n\nWait for each edge (input a, b), we can store:\n\nid is 0-based (from 0 to n-2)\n\nthe a and b (converted to 0-based node nums).\n\nThen, to build the adjacency lists for each node:\n\nThe adjacency list for node a will have an entry with 'to' as b and 'id' as the edge's id.\n\nSimilarly, node b's adjacency list has an entry with 'to' as a and 'id' same as edge's id.\n\nTherefore, for each node, the adjacency list is a collection of Edge structs (to and id).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, after having read all edges (n-1 edges), we can count for each node how many edges it has, then allocate the adjacency arrays for each node with size equal to its degree.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize two arrays for the temporary edges for each edge:\n\ninteger, dimension(n-1) :: a_edges, b_edges\n\nThen:\n\nloop over each edge (id i from 0 to n-2):\n\nRead a and b (1-based), subtract 1 to convert to 0-based.\n\nStore a_edges[i] = a, b_edges[i] = b.\n\nThen, to build the adjacency lists:\n\nFirst, compute for each node, its degree: the number of edges connected to it.\n\nInitialize an array degrees(0 to n-1) = 0.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-2:\n\ndegrees(a_edges(i)) = degrees(a_edges(i)) + 1\n\ndegrees(b_edges(i)) = degrees(b_edges(i)) + 1\n\nOnce we have the degrees, we can allocate the same dimension arrays for each node.\n\nSo for each node 'k' (0 to n-1):\n\nallocate(g(k)%edges(degrees(k)))\n\nWait, but first need to structure the adjacency list as an array of linked lists.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure adjacency list as an array of Edge pointers or similar. Wait maybe let's use a derived type for adjacency lists:\n\ntype EdgeList\n    type(Edge), dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type EdgeList\n\ntype(EdgeList) :: g(0:n-1) \n\ninitializing g(0) to g(n-1) as EdgeList objects with lists of the appropriate size.\n\nWait, this may work. The idea:\n\n1. After determining degrees(k) for each node k:\n\nLoop over all nodes. For each node k:\n\nallocate(g(k)%list(degrees(k)) )\n\nThen we need to fill the lists with the edges. \n\nBut, to fill them, we have to build the entries in order.\n\nThis might be a bit complex. Another approach: for all nodes, loop through each edge and record entries in their adjacency lists. \n\nBut with that approach:\n\nAfter initializing the degrees arrays and the allocated lists, we can have an index array to track where in the list we are adding new entries.\n\nInitialize for each node k an index pointer, say pointers(0..n-1) = 0.\n\nAgain, for each edge i 0..n-2:\n\nnodeA = a_edges(i)\n\nnodeB = b_edges(i)\n\nentry for nodeA's list:\n\ng(nodeA)%list(pointers(nodeA)+1) = Edge(id=i, to= nodeB)\n\npointers(nodeA) = pointers(nodeA) +1\n\nSimilarly for nodeB's list:\n\ng(nodeB)%list(pointers(nodeB)+1) = Edge(id=i, to= nodeA)\n\npointers(nodeB) = pointers(nodeB) +1\n\nBut in Fortran, when using allocatable arrays as in the EdgeList's list, the index would start at 1 (Fortran's default) so adding each entry sequentially would be possible with pointers (which must track the current index).\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nAlright, assuming that is possible, but now the Edge type must be defined properly.\n\nProceeding with the plan.\n\nFirst, in Fortran, the Edge derived type:\n\ntype Edge\n    integer :: id\n    integer :: to\nend type Edge\n\ntype EdgeList\n    integer :: n_edges ! maybe not necessary, but size can be used via size(g(i)%list)\n    type(Edge), dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type EdgeList   ! Or just use Edge, as the edgeList can have an array.\n\nWait, perhaps the EdgeList type can just be the Edge array (allocatable), but using a derived type for each node's Edge list.\n\nAlternatively, the g array can be of type EdgeList, each of which has an Edge array.\n\nSo the structure is okay.\n\nNext, for the ans array, which in Java is size n-1 (since there are n-1 edges, each with an id from 0 to n-2). So in Fortran, ans can be an array of size n-1 (or 0 based from 0 to n-2, but that's up to implementation).\n\nNow, the DFS function: in Java, a method that takes 'to', 'color', 'parents'.\n\nThe DFS is implemented recursively, but Fortran can handle recursive functions as well.\n\nThe function would be called with the node (to), the color (which is the color assigned to the edge to parent?) \n\nWait, in the Java's dfs function:\n\nstatic void dfs(int to, int color, int parents) {\n\nThis function's parameters: \n\n* to: current node being processed.\n\n* color: the color used on the edge that led to 'to' from its parent.\n\n* parents: the previous node (parent) in the traversal.\n\nInitially the DFS is called with dfs(0, -1, -1)\n\nThe function loops over each edge in g.get(to):\n\nfor (Edge e : g.get(to)) {\n\nif the edge's 'to' is the parent (since parents is sent ?), continue.\n\nThen assign a new color k, ensuring that it doesn't equal to the parent's edge's color ?\n\nWait, looking into the code's logic:\n\nThe initial color passed into dfs is the color of the parent's edge leading into the current node. Because the first call is dfs(0, -1, -1), the root node (0) has color -1 (no color). \n\nThe loop through edges does:\n\nfor each edge in current node (to):\n\n   if the edge.to is the parent node (parents), then skip.\n\n   then, the code wants to choose the next available color for this edge.\n\n   current node's first edge can take color 1, but must not match the parent's edge's color.\n\n   variable k is the current candidate color.\n\n   starts at 1.\n\n   if the current edge is the first, and the parent's color is not 1, then assign.\n\n   Wait, let's see:\n\n   The code has:\n\n   int k =1;\n\n   then, loop over the edges (filtered to those not leading back to parent).\n\n   For each such edge's loop iteration:\n\n      if (k == color) then increment k by 1, so it doesn't equal to the parent's color.\n\n      then set ans[e.id] = k.\n\n      call dfs(e.to, k, to).\n\n      then increment k by 1.\n\n   ?\n\nWait, the Java code says:\n\nfor (Edge e : g.get(to)) {\n     ...\n        if(k == color) k++;\n        ans[e.id] = k;\n        dfs(e.to, k, to);\n        k++;\n}\n\nWait, the loop processes all edges (except parent ones) in the adjacency list's order, and for each, it assigns k to ans, then moves to the next.\n\nWait let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe code is:\n\nk starts at 1.\n\nfor all edges (for e in edges):\n\n    if the edge leads back to parent (e.to == parents) \u2192 skip.\n\n    then \u2192 \n\n     if k == color \u2192 then, increment k by 1 (choose next color so that it doesn't match the parent's edge's color).\n\n    assign ans[e.id] = k.\n\n    then call dfs(e.to, k, to)\n\n    then after that, increment k by 1 (so next edge uses higher color)\n\nWait the sequence is crucial here.\n\nThe parent's edge has color 'color', so the current node's edges must choose a color that is not 'color', starting with k=1. \n\nTo ensure that, when k is equal to 'color', we choose the next available color.\n\nThen for \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the parent's edge has color 'c', which is passed as 'color'. \n\nThe child (current node 'to') has to assign colors to its edges (except the parent), with none having 'c'.\n\nWhen processing the edges in the adjacency list for 'to', the first edge's desired color is 1, but if 1 == color, it becomes 2, then set to that value. \n\nThen for each subsequent edge, we increment k by 1. \n\nSo the first edge after adjusting the initial k gets k, then each next edge uses the next number, so all colors are distinct. Since each step increments k, the colors assigned are unique for edges from the current node (except the parent edge).\n\nThis ensures:\n\n- Nodes assign colors in such a way that the edges leaving them don't have duplicates.\n\nAlso, the fact that the colors are generated in this incrementing sequence ensures all children get non-conflicting colors.\n\nSo the logic of the code is designed to choose the earliest okay colors and assign them so that no two edges from a single node have same colors.\n\nOkay, so in Fortran, the DFS needs variables similar to this.\n\nNow, variables like:\n\nans is an array of length n-1, which in fortran we can declare as integer, dimension(0:n-2) since edge count is n-1 (since the problem likely has the edges numbered 0 to n-2).\n\nThe DFS function will be a recursive subroutine, containing parameters:\n\nto: integer (current node)\n\ncolor: integer (the color of the incoming edge)\n\nparent: integer (the previous node from which the current came).\n\nThe code is also to modify the ans array.\n\nIn Fortran, parameter passing for arrays needs to be handled properly (as assumed-shape variables perhaps). Also, since ans is a global array (like in the Java code), perhaps we can use a module or declare it inside the program's main block, making it accessible to the subroutine.\n\nSo thinking about Fortran structure:\n\nThe code would be in a module for the data types or as a standalone program.\n\nA possible outline:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ntype Edge\n    integer :: id\n    integer :: to\nend type Edge\n\ntype :: EdgeList\n    type(Edge), dimension(:), allocatable :: list\nend type EdgeList\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger :: i\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a_edges, b_edges\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: degrees\ntype(EdgeList), dimension(:), allocatable :: g\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: ans\n\ninteger :: max_color\ninteger :: a, b, id, current_k\n! etc.\n\nALLOCATE(a_edges(0: (n-2))) and so on.\n\nBut this needs to be structured properly.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n-1 edges:\n\nallocate (a_edges(n-1)) \n\nWait, but need to be careful with 0-based or 1-based. The problem's nodes are probably 1-based (since Java code converts via -1), so the Fortran code will read a and b, subtract 1 to make 0-based indices.\n\nWait, but edges (n-1 are there). Therefore:\n\nRead the edges:\n\nallocate(a_edges(0:n-2)) and b_edges similarly? Wait Fortran arrays can be dimensioned from 0, but that's up to us. Alternatively, let's have 1-based for a_edges indexes (edge 1 to n-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be set up with:\n\nAfter reading n:\n\nallocate(a_edges(0:n-2))  (dimension from 0 to n-2, inclusive: size n-1 entries).\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array index can be set with a colon in allocation.\n\nAh, the range is important. Let's consider all variables as 0-based:\n\nStep by step code outline:\n\nCall the main program.\n\nprogram main\n\n    implicit none\n\n    !

So when processing each edge:\n\nFor node_a, the current position in the Edge list is pointers(node_a)+1 (since they start at 1 in fortran arrays).\n\nWait pointers(node_a) starts at 0. So the first addition would be pointers(node_a)=0 \u2192 pointers(node_a) increases to 1, so next index is position 1. \n\nYes.\n\nNow, the rest of the variables. \n\nThe 'ans' array is an array of length n-1 (since edge_count is n-1).\n\nAllocate ans:\n\nallocate(ans(0:edge_count-1))\n\nInitialize? No, since we will set them via the dfs.\n\nNow, the DFS function.\n\nWe need to declare a recursive subroutine for the DFS.\n\nThe function can be written as:\n\nrecursive subroutine dfs(to, current_color, parent_node) result(()) \n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer, intent(in) :: to, current_color, parent_node\n    ! ...\n    !

Now, process this edge.\n\n        ! First, check if k equals the current_color (which is the color of the edge that brought us here)\n        ! We must choose a color for this edge that is not the same as current_color.\n\n        if (k == current_color) then\n            k = k +1\n        end if\n        \n        ans(e_id) = k\n\n        ! call DFS on e_to with parent as 'to', and color k (this edge's color, since the edge that connects to the next node is the opposite edge, which shares the same id)\n\n        call dfs(e_to, k, to)\n\n        ! increment k to choose next possible color\n        k = k + 1\n\n    end do\n\nend subroutine dfs\n\nWait but in Fortran, variables like 'ans' must be accessible in the entire program, since in the Java code ans is a static array inside the class. So in the Fortran program, 'ans' is declared in the main program's scope, allocated there, and the function can access it if it is contained in the same scoping unit. \n\nHmm, so perhaps using a module, or declaring the variables in the main program and making the subroutine internal.\n\nYes. To use 'ans' inside the dfs, the subroutine must be within the main program and have access. Alternatively.\n\nLet's write the code with an internal subroutine inside the main program:\n\nprogram main\n\n    ! ... variables declared earlier here (n, g, etc.)\n\n    ! Read and build the edges as before...\n\n    ! Allocate the ans array:\n    allocate(ans(0:edge_count-1))\n\n    ! Initialize ans?\n\n    ! Now call the DFS starting at root node (0), with color -1 (or some invalid value to represent 'no color', since initially no parent edges. In Java it starts with -1, which is considered different from any valid color (since colors are assigned starting at 1).\n\n    The Java code starts with calling:\n\n    dfs(0, -1, -1)\n\n    So in Fortran:\n\n    call dfs(0, -1, -1)\n\n    !

Initially, for to=0, parent_node is -1, so no edge would match that.).\n\nTesting this code for a simple case:\n\nSuppose n=3 nodes arranged as 0 connected to 1 and 2.\n\nEdges:\n\nEdge 0 connects 0-1.\n\nEdge 1 connects 0-2.\n\nWait, the first edge (0 and 1) would be a=0, b=1 (java codes subtract 1 via input 1-based to 0-based).\n\nWait no wait if in the code the input for edges if the first is between 1 and 2 (nodes 1 and 2), but according to the code's traversal, the first edge will have id 0.\n\nWait but in the example where the tree is a root 0 with children 1 and 2, the edges are 0 with 1 (edge ID 0), and 0 with 2 (edge ID1).\n\nWhen the DFS starts at node 0 with current_color =-1 and parent_node =-1.\n\nIn the loop over edges for node 0:\n\nFirst, k=1.\n\nFirst edge is when i is first in edges_here.\n\nSupposing the edges in the adjacency lists of 0 are:\n\nperhaps the order could be first edge 0 (to 1 with id 0), then edge 1 (to 2 with id1).\n\nFirst edge (to=1, id=0):\n\nProcessing this edge:\n\ne_to is 1, parent_node is -1. Not equal. \n\nCheck if k (1) == current_color (-1) \u2192 no.\n\nso assign ans[0] =1.\n\nThen call dfs on 1, with current_color =1, parent is 0.\n\nNow in the recursive call to dfs(1,1,0).\n\nedges_here for node 1 includes the edge to 0 (id0), and maybe others?\n\nWait node 1's edges would be:\n\nedge with id0 (to 0) and other edges (if any). Assuming the tree has only two edges from 0 to 1 and 0-2, then node 1's adjacency list includes the edge from 0 to 1's edge ID0 (pointing back to 0), so in the loop:\n\nedges_here for node1 has edges.\n\nIn the loop over edges of node 1, the 'edges_here' list includes the edge to node0 (id0). So when processing all edges of node1:\n\ni loops over each entry in the list.\n\nWe have the first entry may be to node0, which is the parent (0), so it is skipped.\n\nOther edges (if any), but node1 has only the edge to 0 in this case.\n\nWait in this case, the loop over the edges for node 1 will not process any edges except to 0 (parent). \n\nHence, the loop runs, but no further edges to process. So after returning from dfs(1,1,0), the current recursion loops to the next edge for node0 (edge to node2 with id=1).\n\nAt that point, back in node0's loop:\n\nafter the first edge (id0) processed (set to color 1), the code proceeds to increment k=2, then enters the loop again for the next edge (next in the list: edge to node2 (id1).\n\nSo for the second edge:\n\nk was after previous iteration 1 (because after assigning ans(0)=1 and calling dfs on node1, the code did \"k =k+1\" \u2192 after the first edge (i_edge=1) processing, after the call returns to node0's loop, \n\nWait: Let me clarify step after processing edge1:\n\nWhen at node 0's loop first iteration (i=1):\n\nThe edge is for node1 (id0). \n\nAfter executing that iteration:\n\nans(0) was set to k=1.\n\nThen called dfs(1,1,0). \n\nThen after that returns, executes the k = k+1 \u2192 so k becomes 2 before proceeding.\n\nThen the next iteration (i=2 for edges_here's second edge, which would be to node2: edge 1.\n\nprocessing this edge (e_to is 2, not equal to parent (0's parent is _-1., but the parent in this loop is the original call, but wait, in the first call the parent_node is -1, so when processing node0's edges:\n\nwhen checking e_to == parent_node? the parent_node is -1, e_to is 2 (the node 2's address).\n\nHence not skipped.\n\nSo process that edge:\n\ncurrent k is 2 (after increment from the previous steps).\n\nCheck k == current_color (which is -1) \u2192 yes? no, current_color is -1.\n\nNo equality since 2 != -1.\n\nHence assign ans(1)=2.\n\nCall dfs(2, 2, 0), which will run on node2, etc.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEventually, the ans array for edges 0(id0) has 1, edge 1 (id1) has 2. \n\nThe max color is 2, which would be correct here.\n\nWhich indicates that the algorithm is working.\n\nNow, code considerations:\n\nEdgeList type:\n\nThe EdgeList's list member is an allocatable array of Edge.\n\nWhen building the adjacency lists, during the pointer incrementing and edge addition, I had:\n\nFor each edge i in the temp array,\n\nnodeA (a_edges(i))\n\nThe first call for nodeA:\n\npointers(nodeA) is 0. \n\nnode_a's current edge count is degrees[node_a], but that's already confirmed.\n\nSo the new edge is added to position pointers(node_a)+1 (since Fortran counts from 1).\n\nYes.\n\nBut in code:\n\nAfter incrementing pointers(node_a) by 1, \n\nthen assign:\n\ng(node_a)%list(pointers(node_a))%id =current_id \n\nWait. \n\nWait suppose starting at pointers(node_a) =0. \n\nThen after pointers +=1 \u21921, the element g(node_a)%list(1) is assigned.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nNow, variables in the DFS subroutine:\n\nThe loop over edges in edges_here must go from 1 to the size of edges_here (which is the degree of that node).\n\nThe logic there seem okay.\n\nNow, dealing with pointers for parent and current_color:\n\n- parents (node) and node_to being tracked correctly.\n\nNow, corner cases:\n\nEdge case when n=1 (no edges):\n\nBut the code requires to have n >=1.\n\nIf n=1, the code:\n\n- reads n=1 \n\n- then edge_count =0, so loop reading edges is 0 iterations.\n\n- build adj lists (degrees are all 0 \u2192 each node's list is of size 0).\n\nThen the 'ans' would have dimension 0:0-1 \u2192 invalid perhaps (since edge_count-1 = -1).\n\nNeed to handle that.\n\nWait Fortran cannot have arrays of extent 0 unless it's an allocatable with size zero.\n\nWait the allocation for ans(0:edge_count-1) where edge_count =0 \u2192 array has 0 elements.\n\nTherefore, when n=1, the program rejects.\n\nBut according to the problem constraints, perhaps the input is for n>=2?\n\nProbably, the problem ensures that n >= 2. but if need to handle n=1, perhaps output 0 and nothing else.\n\nBut in the given code, when n=1,\n\nthe main code would have:\n\nans is array [0:-1], undefined, but the code would crash.\n\nTherefore, in the code, need to handle the n=1 case before proceeding with allocations.\n\nIn the beginning:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\n\ntype Edge ... \n\n...\n\n! Read n\n\nread *, n\n\nif (n <=1) then\n\n    ! no edges. since n-1 edges is 0 edges.\n\n    if (n==1) then\n\n        print *, 0 \n        print *, \n\n        ! but according to Java code, the output is 'max' which is 0, then n-1=0 edges, so no lines after. \n\n        write(*, '(I0)') 0 \n\n        stop \n\n    else \n\n        error. \n\n    end if \n\nend if \n\nso add this check at the start.\n\nSimilarly, after the allocations.\n\nNow, in Fortran code, the main parts are:\n\nBut now, the code in Fortran must be written properly.\n\nAnother thing: the DFS functions loop over all edges, including in any order. Since the Edge are stored in the list of the node, the order of traversal is dependent on the order they were inserted, which depends on the order in the edges and the pointers. Since the code uses two pointers for each edge ( adds in a and b's lists in the order encountered), the edge's list for a node may have the edges in an order that is the reverse of the edge's insertion.\n\nThe code's correctness doesn't depend on the order so long as all edges are processed except the parent.\n\nNow, possible other issues in code:\n\nIn the initial code, the 'k' is incremented even if the edge's to is the parent's node.\n\nWait in the edges loop:\n\nfor each edge in g.get(to):\n\n    if(e.to == parent_node)... continue.\n\n    ... the rest.\n\nThus, the skipped edges do not cause increment of k. \n\nBecause in the code, the edges are in the list and the loop iterates over all, but the 'continue' skips. \n\nThe 'k' is only incremented if the edge is not skipped.\n\nWait no. The 'k' is incremented regardless.\n\nWait in the Java code, the loop is for each edge in the list:\n\nBut after filtering (skipped ones are ignored). The 'k' is only modified for non-skipped edges?\n\nWait looking again at the Java code:\n\nfor (Edge e : g.get(to)) {\n    if (e.to == parents) continue;\n    if(k == color) k++;\n    ans[e.id] = k;\n    dfs(e.to, k, to);\n    k++;\n}\n\nThus:\n\nThe 'k' is only tracked and the k++ for the edge that is processed (after advancement and after the assignment.\n\nWait for each edge (non-parent),\n\nthe steps are:\n\nif(k is equal to color, advance to the next color.\n\nSet ans[e.id] = k.\n\ncall dfs.\n\nthen increment k.\n\nThus, after each edge processing, irrespective of whether the 'if' clause above happened, because we have after checking, proceeding to increment by one for next edge.\n\nSo, for each edge that is processed, there is a k increment after processing.\n\nTherefore, the increment is only for edges that passed the parent check.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nInside the loop over edges of 'to':\n\nif (e_to == parent_node \u2192 cycle (skip).\n\nElse:\n\nthen, ...\n\nSo, the code in the do loop:\n\nif (e_to == parent_node) cycle\n\nthen process steps.\n\nThe 'k' is increased every time the code continues after processing an edge (the 'k =k+1' line after setting the ans and invoking dfs).\n\nThus, the loop should function correctly.\n\nBased on that, I think the code should be functional.\n\nNow, putting this all into code:\n\nBelow is the compiled translation."
