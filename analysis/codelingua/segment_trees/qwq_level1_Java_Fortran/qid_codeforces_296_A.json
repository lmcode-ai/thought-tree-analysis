But it's expected. But since the task is to translate the code, not to fix it, we must keep the code as is. Therefore the Fortran code as written earlier is correct. Wait in the Fortran code, when initializing max_count as -1. Wait in the code: max_count = -1\n\nthen loop i from 1 to 1000.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does.\n\nThe main class has a main method that reads input, processes it, and outputs the result. The Task class's solve method is the core logic here. The problem seems to involve counting occurrences of integers and checking if the maximum frequency is within a certain limit based on the total count n.\n\nFirst, the input is read using the InputReader class. In Java, they're using a BufferedReader with a buffer size of 32768. Hmm, but in Fortran, I/O is a bit different. I might not need to worry about the buffer size since Fortran's read statements are straightforward for basic inputs. So maybe I can read from standard input directly.\n\nLooking at the solve method:\n\n- Read n, the number of integers.\n- An array of size 1001 (indices 0-1000) is initialized to count frequencies. Wait, Java array indices start at 0, so elements 0 to 1000. But in Fortran, arrays are typically 1-based unless specified otherwise. Oh right, but in this Java code, the problem might involve integers that can be 0 or up. The array[1001] can hold up to index 1000, so maybe the input numbers are up to 1000? The code increments array[index], but the index is read from input as per the nextInt() calls. So the allowed input values are up to 1000?\n\nWait, the problem needs to count the occurrences of each given index. So the input integers must be between 0 and 1000, inclusive, since the array size is 1001. That way, if an input number is 0, it will be stored in array[0], and 1000 in array[1000]. Since Java's array indices go from 0 to 1000 when declared as int[1001], the same logic in Fortran would need an array of size 1001, but with indices from 0 to 1000. In Fortran, arrays can be declared with a starting and ending index. So, perhaps declaring an array of size 1001, with indices 0:1000.\n\nIn Fortran, the code structure is different. There's no classes, so I need to convert the object-oriented code into a more procedural style. The main program will handle reading the input and calling the required functions.\n\nThe key steps in Fortran would be:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read n integers, each between 0 and 1000, and count their occurrences in an array of size 1001 (array indexes 0 to 1000).\n3. Find the maximum count in that array.\n4. Check if the maximum count satisfies the condition:\n   - If n is even: max <= n/2\n   - If n is odd: max <= (n//2) +1 (integer division)\n5. Output YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, let's map this step by step to Fortran.\n\nFirst, for the input. In Java, the input reader splits the line into tokens. But in Fortran, when reading from stdin, each read statement can take numbers from the input. Since in Java code, they're reading each nextInt() which is essentially the next token. So in Fortran, if the inputs are given as space-separated numbers on multiple lines, but more likely, all in one line.\n\nWait, looking at the InputReader's next() method: it reads lines and breaks into tokens. So the input can be multiple lines, and each time next() gives the next token across all lines. But for the problem's case, perhaps the input is a single line with n followed by n numbers. But let's see how the code works.\n\nThe Task's solve method first reads n with in.nextInt(); then reads n times in.nextInt() each time. So the input would be n followed by n integers separated by spaces, maybe all on a single line after n. So in Fortran, to read n, then read the next n integers.\n\nThe first line is n, and the next line is the list of numbers? Or maybe all the numbers are on the same line? Typically, in such programming competition problems, the input is structured such that after the first number n, the next line has n numbers in one line. Alternatively, it could be all in one line, but let's assume the input is in one line: the first number is n, then the n numbers follow separated by spaces.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the plan:\n\nRead n first. Then read the next n integers, accumulate counts in an array. Then process as before.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFortran has modules, but perhaps this can be a simple program with subroutines.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nMain program:\n\n- Read n.\n- Read n numbers into an array.\n- Initialize a count array of size 1001 (indexes 0-1000)\n- Iterate through the numbers and increment count[index]\n- Find the max count\n- Compute condition\n\nBut how to read the n numbers?\n\nIn Fortran, reading from stdin can be done with read(*,*) or similar.\n\nBut first, let's outline the code.\n\nProgram:\n\nprogram codeforces\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, num, max_count, count(0:1000)\n    integer, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n\n    ! Allocate array for n integers\n    allocate(array(n))\n\n    ! Read the numbers\n    read(*,*) (array(i), i = 1, n)  ! because in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default.\n\n    ! Initialize counts to zero\n    count = 0\n\n    ! Iterate over each number and count\n    do i = 1, n\n        num = array(i)\n        count(num) = count(num) + 1\n    end do\n\n    ! Find max count\n    max_count = 0\n    do i = 0, 1000\n        if (count(i) > max_count) then\n            max_count = count(i)\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    ! Determine the condition\n    if (mod(n,2) == 0) then\n        if (max_count <= n/2) then\n            write(*,*) 'YES'\n        else\n            write(*,*) 'NO'\n        end if\n    else\n        if (max_count <= (n+1)/2) then  ! Or n/2 +1? Because if n is odd, n/2 is integer division (since n is integer)\n            write(*,*) 'YES'\n        else\n            write(*,*) 'NO'\n        end if\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(array)\nend program\n\nWait, let's check the conditions in Java. In Java:\n\nFor even n:\n\nif (countMax <= n / 2)\n\nfor example, n=4 \u2192 4/2=2 \u2192 max must be <=2.\n\nFor odd n, like n=5, it's n/2 +1. Because n/2 is 2, so 2+1=3. So max must be <=3. Which can also be written as (n+1)/2 \u2192 (5+1)/2 =3.\n\nYes, because n is an integer. (n+1)/2 is integer division. So in Fortran, the condition can be written as (n/2) +1, but perhaps (n+1)/2 will work.\n\nWait, for n even, (n)/2= n//2 (integer division). For example 4: (4+1)/2 =2.5? No, wait in Fortran integer division.\n\nWait, need to check Fortran's division. If in Fortran, (5)/2 =2 (as integer division), since 5/2 =2.5, but when divided as integers, the result is 2. So for 5+1 divided by 2 (6/2) gives 3, which is correct.\n\nYes, so for the condition for odd n, the max <= (n+1)/2. So in code, compute (n+1)/2 as an integer, since n is integer, adding 1 then dividing by 2.\n\nThus, the condition can be written as:\n\nif (mod(n,2) == 0) then\n    if (max_count <= n/2) then ...\nelse \n    if (max_count <= (n+1)/2) then...\n\nWait but in the Java code, it is written as n/2 +1. Let me see:\n\nfor example n=5: n/2=2 (since 5//2 is 2 in integer division), so +1 gives 3. (5+1)/2=3. So same result.\n\nThus, that formula works.\n\nSo in Fortran, the condition is acceptable as written.\n\nNow, what about the array in Fortran:\n\nthe array is count(0:1000). So that's okay because indices start at 0. accessing count(num), where num is the integer from 0-1000.\n\nPossible? Well, if the numbers can be 0 to 1000, then yes.\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when declaring arrays with explicit bounds, you can have from 0. So using count(0:1000) is correct.\n\nNow, the Problem input: when the code reads the integers, in Java, the InputReader's nextInt() can read numbers up to 1000 (assuming the problem constraints say that the numbers are between 0 and 1000, inclusive). The Fortran code has to handle that. So when reading the array, each number should be within 0 to 1000, otherwise the count array may be out of bounds.\n\nBut in any case, the problem likely specifies that the numbers are in that range, so we can proceed.\n\nNow, in Fortran, when reading numbers with read(*,*) (free format), the input can be entered in any way, as long as they are separated by whitespaces.\n\nWait the first read statement: first line is n, then the next line has the n numbers. Or, after the first read, the numbers could be on the same line?\n\nThe Java code uses the InputReader, which reads tokens from all lines. For instance, if the user enters n followed by many numbers on separate lines, the code will process them as needed. So in Fortran, the code should also read all the following numbers after n, even if they are on subsequent lines.\n\nIn the Fortran code as outlined earlier:\n\nThe Read for the array is read(*,*) (array(i), i =1,n).\n\nFortran will read the next n numbers from the input, regardless of the line breaks. So that's okay.\n\nNow, when initializing the counts to zero, the code does count =0. Becausearrays were initialized with count(0:1000), setting count =0 initializes all elements to zero.\n\nThe loop to count:\n\ndo i=1 to n, get the number array(i), then count(num) +=1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, variables are by default integers (if declared as integer, that is). The \"array(i)\" is integer, so the index is okay.\n\nNow, check for the maximum count. Initializing max_count to zero. Wait in Java the code had countMax initialized to -1. Hmm, that's important.\n\nWait in the Java code, the countMax is initialized to -1, and then loops from i=1 to array.length (which is 1001, so indexes from 0-1000). Wait, in the Java code, the loop is for (int i =1; i < array.length; i++) ... Wait that's weird. Wait, array.length is 1001 (since declared as new int[1001]). So the loop runs from i=1 to 1000 (since the index is up to but not including array.length?), but wait:\n\nWait looking at Java code in the Task's solve method:\n\nfor (int i =1; i < array.length; i++) {\n\nSo array is 0-based, with elements 0..1000. So this loop starts at index 1, so from 1 to 1000. So the code is skipping index 0's count. Because in array.length is 1001, loop runs up to array.length-1. Wait no, 1001 elements are from 0 to 1000, so the indices go from 0 to 1000. The loop starts at i=1 and runs while i < array.length (1001), so the upper limit is 1000. So the loop goes from 1 to 1000, thereby missing index 0. That's a bug if the input can have 0's.\n\nWait this is a critical error in the original Java code? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the Java code's solve method:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) { ... }\n\narray.length is 1001, so i runs from 1 to 1000. So they are not including the count at index 0. Which is wrong because values can be 0, and their count would be at index 0 of the array.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So in the original Java code, this would lead to incorrect max_count, if any of the numbers is zero. Thus, this is a bug in the original code?\n\nWait, the Java code's array is initialized as int[1001], so indexes go from 0 to 1000. But the loop starts at i=1. So if any number is zero, the count for zero will not be considered for the max_count. So the max will be undercounted.\n\nIs that a problem? Oh yes! The code is wrong here, but since the user said to translate the code as given, even if it has a bug, we still have to replicate that behavior in Fortran.\n\nSo according to the code, the maximum is calculated from index 1 to 1000 (since i starts at 1), thus ignoring any counts in array[0].\n\nSo in the Fortran code, we must replicate this bug.\n\nSo, in the Fortran code, the max loop should be from i =1 to 1000, and not check index 0.\n\nWait the original code in Java had the for loop as for (int i =1; i < array.length; i++) which runs from i=1 to 1000 (since array.length is 1001). So in Fortran, the max loop would be:\n\nmax_count = -1  (Wait, but in the Java code, countMax was initialized to -1. Wait let's check the Java code again.)\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nint countMax = -1;\n\nfor (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {\n\n    if (countMax < array[i]) countMax = array[i];\n\n}\n\nSo the initial countMax is -1, which is lower than any possible array[i], since array[i] counts, which are \u22650. So this ensures that the first non-zero element will set countMax to that. But since they skip index 0, even if there's a high count at 0, it won't be counted.\n\nIn Fortran's case, to replicate this exactly, the max_count should start at -1 (or maybe 0? Wait no, in Fortran, initializing max_count as -1 is needed, but in Fortran, integer variables can be negative).\n\nHmm, in Fortran code:\n\nmax_count = -1\n\nthen:\n\ndo i =1, 1000  ! loop over indices 1 to 1000 (since the Java code does i from 1 to 1000 inclusive?)\n\n   if (count(i) > max_count) then...\n\n   end if\n\nThus, the zero index is skipped. So in the code, the error is present, and we need to replicate that.\n\nSo modifying the Fortran code's max_count initialization and loop.\n\nLet me rebuild the code:\n\nThe correct Fortran code (with the bug):\n\nprogram codeforces\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, num, max_count, count(0:1000)\ninteger, allocatable :: array(:)\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(array(n))\n\n    read(*,*) (array(i), i=1, n)\n    count = 0  ! all elements initialized to zero\n\n    do i=1,n\n        num = array(i)\n        count(num) = count(num) +1\n    end do\n\n    max_count = -1\n    do i=1,1000   ! starting at 1, up to 1000\n        if (count(i) > max_count) then\n            max_count = count(i)\n        end if\n    end do  ! loop for max count\n\n    ! Determine condition:\n    if (mod(n,2) ==0) then\n        if (max_count <= n/2) then\n            print*, \"YES\"\n        else\n            print*, \"NO\"\n        end if\n    else  ! odd case\n        if (max_count <= (n+1)/2) then\n            print*, \"YES\"\n        else\n            print*, \"NO\"\n        end if\n    end if\n\n    deallocate(array)\nend program\n\nWait but in Fortran, the first index is 1 for the array, but count is declared from 0 to 1000, so count(1) refers to the second element (since in Java's array[1], which is the second element). So the loop over i from 1 to 1000 will check all indices from 1 to 1000 (the same as the Java code's loop). The count for '0' would be stored in count(0), which is ignored in the max calculation. So this replicates the original bug.\n\nTherefore, the code must have that loop.\n\nNow, possible issues.\n\nWhat if all the numbers are 0? Then count[0] will be the count, but the max would be -1, since the loop starts at 1. So the code would set max_count to the max of the elements from 1 to 1000's counts, which are zero. Then, since the initial max_count was -1, the first such check would set max_count to 0 (for all zeros case). Because count(i) (starting at i=1) would be 0 for all, except perhaps if there were a higher count.\n\nWait, let's take an example: input is 5 numbers all being zero.\n\nThen n =5.\n\ncounts(0)=5, counts from 1 to 1000 are zero.\n\nThe loop in java's code for max checks indices 1-1000, which have counts 0, which are greater than -1, so the first one will set max to 0, and then others don't change.\n\nSo max_count becomes 0. Then the condition is (n=5 is odd, so 5+1/2=3; the max_count is 0, so 0<= 3 \u2192 outputs \"YES\". Which is correct if the problem's condition is that each group must not exceed (n+1)/2.\n\nWait the problem, since original code has that condition. \n\nBut if there was a case where the maximum count is in index 0 (say, n=3 zeros), the code would treat the max as 0 (since all others are zero). But the actual max is 3 (count[0]). Thus the code would incorrectly think the max is zero, leading it to output YES, even though the actual max is 3 which is greater than (3+1)/2 =2. So output would be wrong, but the java code has this bug. Since the user wants a direct translation of their code (even if erroneous), the Fortran code needs to have this bug.\n\nThus the code is correct as per the Java's incorrect loop.\n\nNow, let's see code in Fortran. Also, the 'count' array is 0-based here. The 'array' (of the input numbers) is 1-based, but that's okay.\n\nAdditional checks: when the input numbers are more than 1000, but the problem likely restricts the input, so no problem here. Since Fortran's counts can't handle them beyond 1000, but that's the same in Java.\n\nAnother point: in the initial code, in Java they have PrintWriter out, then close it. But in Fortran, standard output is handled by write statements, no need to close.\n\nNow, testing edge case:\n\nCase 1: All numbers 0. Let's say n=3.\n\nThen count[0] =3, but other counts are zero. The max in 1-1000 is 0, so max_count set to 0. Then condition:\n\nn=3 is odd. (3+1)/2 = 2. max_count=0 <=2 \u2192 Yes.\n\nBut the correct answer (if problem requires maximum freq not exceeding ceiling(n/2)) would require 3<=2 \u2192 which is false \u2192 output NO. But because of the bug, the code outputs YES. But it's expected.\n\nBut since the task is to translate the code, not to fix it, we must keep the code as is.\n\nTherefore the Fortran code as written earlier is correct.\n\nWait in the Fortran code, when initializing max_count as -1.\n\nWait in the code:\n\nmax_count = -1\n\nthen loop i from 1 to 1000.\n\ncount(i) will be 0 in all those positions when all are 0.\n\nThe first time, 0 >-1 \u2192 yes. So max becomes 0. So that is correct for that code.\n\nNow, compiling and testing.\n\nAnother example:\n\nTest case where the first element is the maximum, but in the first position (index 0, but not considered).\n\nSuppose n=4, and numbers are all 0's. Then the maximum count is 4 (in 0), but since the code skips it, max counted as 0.\n\nThe cod ewill compute max_count 0 \u22644/2 \u21920 <=2 \u2192 yes, output is \"YES\".\n\nWhich is wrong because 4 count is 4, which is bigger than 2. But code's bug.\n\nSo the code does translate the problem as per the Java code, even if it's bug-ridden.\n\nThus the Fortran code is correct as per the original Java code's logic."
