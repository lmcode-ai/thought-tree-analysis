MIN_VALUE;\n} so since the Java array has 4010 elements, but when n is small, maybe n=10, then only the first 10 elements are set to MIN_VALUE, the rest remain as 0? That might be an issue.

But in that way:\n\nInitialize all to zero, then first set everything from 0 to n-1 to MIN, then set dp(0)=0. Yes. That would achieve the same. So code:\n\ndo i = 0, maxn-1\n\n   dp(i) = 0\n\nend do\n\nthen:\n\ndo i =0,n-1\n\n   dp(i) = -huge_value\n\nend do\n\ndp(0) = 0\n\nWait but then how do I do that in code. Alternatively, first set all to zero, then:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   dp(i) = -1e9 (JAVA's min is -2^31). So the smallest possible integer. But in Fortran, the range is -2^31 to 2^31-1, same as Java's integer. So -huge(n) might be like -2^31. But perhaps better to use a constant.",

Wait , in the first loop:\n\nDo I=0 to maxn-1:\n\n   dp(i) =0. Second loop:\n\nI from 0 to n-1\n\n   dp(i) becomes minval. Then after that, dp(0) is reset to 0 again.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I should understand what the Java code does. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe Java program starts by importing Scanner. Then, in the main method, it reads an integer n from the user. It initializes some variables: maxn is 4010, which is probably the maximum possible value for n. Then it reads a, b, c. The array arr has those three values. \n\nThe next part is a dynamic programming array dp with size maxn, initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE except for dp[0] which is 0. Then there's a loop over the three elements of arr. For each arr's value, it loops from j starting at arr[i] up to maxn, and updates dp[j] to be the maximum between its current value and dp[j - arr[i]] + 1. Finally, it prints dp[n].\n\nSo the goal is to find the minimum number of coins (a, b, c denominations?) needed to make up n, and print that value. But wait, actually the standard coin change problem's DP usually tracks the minimum. Here though, since they use Math.max, maybe the problem is different. Wait, let me think. The update is dp[j] = max( current, dp[j - arr[i]] +1 ). So the DP array tracks the maximum number of coins needed to form the amount j? Wait, that might not make sense. Or perhaps the problem is to form exactly n as a combination of a, b, and c terms, and find the maximum number of coins possible? Because adding 1 each time when you take a coin, so the maximum would be achieved by using the smallest denominations. Hmm, but I guess the code is written as is, so my job is to translate that code to Fortran.\n\nNow, translating the code into Fortran. Let's see. In Java, arrays are different from Fortran. Also, in Fortran, array indices start at 1 by default, but we may need to adjust for that. \n\nFirst, variables: n is the input. The maxn is 4010. The a,b,c are the three numbers read. The array arr in Java is [a, b, c], so in Fortran, an integer array of size 3.\n\nThe dp array in Java is of size maxn (4010), but in Fortran, we can declare an array of size maxn. Wait, in Fortran 90 or later, arrays are declared with explicit sizes. The initialization part is important. The Java code initializes dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE for all i up to n, but actually the loop is for(int i=0; i< n; i++) dp[i] = ... Hmm wait, the original loop in Java is for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE; }, but that's not initializing the entire array. Wait a second, in the code, after defining dp as new int[maxn], all elements are initialized to 0 by default, but then in this loop, they run from i=0 to n-1, and set those elements to Integer.MIN_VALUE. The rest (from n to maxn-1) remain as zero? Wait, no, because in Java, arrays of primitive types are initialized to zero. So when they do the loop, they overwrite the first 'n' elements to MIN_VALUE, but the rest are kept as 0? Wait no, no, hold on. The code here:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n   dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n}\nso since the Java array has 4010 elements, but when n is small, maybe n=10, then only the first 10 elements are set to MIN_VALUE, the rest remain as 0? That might be an issue. Wait, the code also does DP[0] =0 after. So the DP starts with 0 for position 0. The rest positions from 1 to n-1 are set to MIN, except position 0. Then, when the loops start, for each of the a, b, c coins, they iterate j from arr[i] to the end of the array. \n\nHmm, okay, so the initial setup is that dp[0] is 0 and all others (except maybe the ones beyond the first n elements?) are set to MIN or 0? But maybe the original logic is intended to have the dp array's first n+1 elements? Because the loop is from j starting at arr[i], but I need to make sure in Fortran the array is big enough. Since maxn is 4010, it's okay.\n\nNow translating this:\n\nFirst read n, a, b, c. In Fortran, we can read them via read(*,*) \n\nThe variables:\n\nn: integer\n\na, b, c: integers, part of an array.\n\nmaxn is a constant, perhaps parameter.\n\nThe dp array is an integer array of size 4010. However, in Fortran, arrays can be declared with dimension(maxn), but considering that indices can start from 1, but maybe here in Java indices start at 0, so we need to shift. \n\nWait, in Java, dp[0] is accessible, so in Fortran, perhaps we can declare it with indices from 0 to maxn. Because in Fortran you can set the lower bound. For example, in Fortran 90, declare as integer, dimension(0:maxn) :: dp.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran arrays default to 1-based, so to make it similar to Java's 0-based indices, setting the indices accordingly is important.\n\nSo, first, variables and arrays:\n\nDefine the maxn as a constant:\n\nparameter (maxn=4010)\n\nThen integer arrays dp(0:maxn) \n\nThen initialize dp(0:maxn) = something. But in Java, initially, all elements are zero. \n\nWait:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\n1) initial dp array is created with new int[maxn], so all zero.\n\nThen loop runs for i from 0 to n-1: setting dp[i] to MIN_VALUE. So:\n\nAfter this loop, dp[0] is set to MIN later, so first, let's see:\n\nIn Java:\n\ndp array starts as all 0 (since primitive int are initialized to 0).\n\nThen for i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   set dp[i] to Integer.MIN_VALUE except then dp[0] is immediately reset to 0.\n\nWait, the code's next line is dp[0]=0;. So the first step for indices 0..n-1, set to MIN, then dp[0] is set to 0 again. That way, the initial dp array has dp[0] as 0, and other indices (up to n-1) as MIN, but beyond n-1, those elements are untouched as 0. Wait, so after the loop runs, the code then sets dp[0] to 0, which overwrites the earlier MIN setting for index 0.\n\nAh, right, that's important. The code runs the loop from i=0 to i < n, so all indices up to n-1 are set to MIN, but immediately after that, dp[0] is set back to 0. And the dp array beyond index n-1 (but less than 4010) are still 0, since they were never touched by the loop except their initial 0.\n\nSo in Fortran, the process is:\n\nInitialize all dp elements to whatever, and then:\n\nFirst: dp(0) = 0.\n\nWait no, original code's steps are:\n\nInitialize all elements to 0 (Java's default).\n\nThen set elements i=0 to i=n-1 to min value.\n\nThen set dp[0] to 0 again.\n\nHmm. But that initial method can be done more simply. In Fortran, you can start by initializing all elements except dp[0] to the minimum, and dp[0] to zero, but it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, use the same steps as the original code. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran:\n\nFirst, declare dp(0:maxn). Then:\n\nAfter declaration, need to set all elements to the minimum except for dp[0]. Let's think step by step.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can initialize arrays on declaration. Like:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:maxn) :: dp = -big\n\nBut that would set all to -big, which is the equivalent of MIN. But also:\n\nWait, in Java, the loop from 0 to n-1 sets those indices to MIN, but others (from n to maxn-1) are left as 0. So to copy that in Fortran:\n\nMaybe need:\n\nFirst, set dp(0) = 0\n\nThen, loop over i from 1 to n-1:\n\n    dp(i) = -huge value\n\nand the rest (n to maxn) remain as zero.\n\nWait, but initial array is initialized to what? In Fortran, variables may have undefined values unless initialized. So need explicit initialization.\n\nAlternatively, use a DO loop:\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 4010\n\ninteger :: n, a, b, c, dp(0:maxn)\n\nRead input:\n\nRead *, n\n\nread *, a, b, c\n\nThen, the array arr would be an integer array of [a, b, c]\n\nIn Fortran, arrays can be initialized like:\n\ninteger, dimension(3) :: arr = [a, b, c]\n\nWait, but in the code a,b,c are read, so after reading them, we can assign as arr = [a, b, c].\n\nBut in Fortran 90, to declare the array after reading variables, you can do:\n\ninteger, dimension(3) :: arr\n\narr = [a, b, c]\n\nNow, Initialize the dp array:\n\nFirst, set all elements to a large negative number except dp(0) which is 0.\n\nSo:\n\ndo i = 0, maxn\n\n   dp(i) = -huge(n) ! which is a very large negative number\n\nend do\n\ndp(0) = 0\n\nWait, but the Java original sets only the first n elements to MIN, but in the code after that they set dp(0) back to 0. But in Java, the other indices (from n up) are still zero. Hmm, so the original code allows for the dp entries beyond the considered range (maybe beyond n) to be initialized to zero. Wait that's conflicting with the original approach. Because in the code:\n\nThe first loop here:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n\nso if i runs from 0 to n-1, the loop sets dp[0] through dp[n-1] to MIN, then sets dp[0] to 0. But the rest of dp[n] up to maxn-1 remains 0 (their initial value).\n\nIn Fortran, if I set all elements (from 0 to maxn) to a huge negative, except 0, then it is not the same as the original code. Instead, in the original code, only the first n elements are set to MIN, and the rest remain as zero. To replicate that, maybe need:\n\nFirst, set dp(0:maxn) to zero (using a do loop) , but then set elements 1 ton-1 to -huge(). Not sure if that's necessary. Let me see:\n\nWait original's dp array is initialized as new int[maxn], which in Java initialized all elements to zero. Then the for loop sets elements 0 to n-1 to MIN. Then set dp[0] back to 0. The rest (from n to maxn-1) stay as zero.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nInitialize the array to zero first.\n\nThen, set dp(0:maxn) = 0, then loop:\n\ndo i=0, n-1\n\n   dp(i) = -huge(n) + 1 (or equivalent to java's MIN)\n\nbut then dp(0) gets set here to MIN and then later set to 0.\n\nalternatively, set dp(0) to 0 first, then set elements 1 to n-1 to MIN.\n\nHmm, so in code steps:\n\ninitialize dp=0 to all elements.\n\nloop i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   if (i ==0) then, after setting, we'll do another assignment.\n\nbut it's better to first set all elements 0 to n-1 to min, then dp(0)=0.\n\nBut in that way:\n\nInitialize all to zero, then first set everything from 0 to n-1 to MIN, then set dp(0)=0.\n\nYes. That would achieve the same.\n\nSo code:\n\ndo i = 0, maxn-1\n\n   dp(i) = 0\n\nend do\n\nthen:\n\ndo i =0,n-1\n\n   dp(i) = -huge_value\n\nend do\n\ndp(0) = 0\n\nWait but then how do I do that in code.\n\nAlternatively, first set all to zero, then:\n\ndo i =0, n-1\n\n   dp(i) = -1e9 (JAVA's min is -2^31). So the smallest possible integer.\n\nBut in Fortran, the range is -2^31 to 2^31-1, same as Java's integer. So -huge(n) might be like -2^31. But perhaps better to use a constant.\n\nAlternatively, set it to -2^31. Since huge(integer) in Fortran is 2^31-1. Therefore, -huge(integer) would be -2147483647, but the min is -2147483648. Hmm, perhaps use -huge(integer) -1. Not sure. Alternatively, use a constant:\n\nBut to map exactly, perhaps:\n\ninteger, parameter :: minval = -2147483648\n\nthen set dp(i) = minval where needed.\n\nAlternatively, to keep it simple, just set it to a very negative value, like -1e9. Since the problem's constraints may not need the exact minimum. But for portability, perhaps better to use -2^31.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, the minimum for a 4-byte integer is -2147483648, so we can set the dp[i] to that.\n\nBack to the code structure. So:\n\nAfter reading a,b,c, we set the dp array as:\n\ndo i=0, maxn\n\n   dp(i) = 0\n\nend do\n\nthen do i=0, n-1\n\n   dp(i) = minval\n\nend do\n\ndp(0)=0\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop to set the first n elements (from 0 to n-1) to minval.\n\nNow the next steps. The loops for the DP:\n\nOuter loop: for each coin in arr (Java's for\u5faa\u73af for i in 0-2 (since arr is size 3).\n\nIn Fortran, the 3 coins are stored in the array arr(1:3), assuming arr is 1-based. Wait, no, in the Fortran code, I declared arr as a dimension 3, but in Java, the index starts at 0 (arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]).\n\nWait, in the code written in Fortran:\n\nIf we have:\n\ninteger, dimension(3) :: arr = [a,b,c]\n\nthen the elements are arr(1), arr(2), arr(3).\n\nSo maybe better to index:\n\n do i=1,3\n\n   current coin is arr(i)\n\nso, for each coin in arr:\n\nthen for j from arr(i) to maxn:\n\n   dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - arr(i)) +1 )\n\nWait in Java, the inner loop was:\n\nfor (int j = arr[i]; j < dp.length; j++) \n\nso j starts at the coin value (arr[i]) up to maxn-1 (since dp.length is 4010, indexes go to 4009).\n\nIn Fortran, the j will loop from arr(i) to maxn. Wait, the maxn is the upper limit of the array. Since dp has indices from 0 to maxn(?). Wait, actually in the Java code, the dp's length is 4010, so indexes 0..4009. The Java code uses j < dp.length. So j goes up to 4009.\n\nWait in Fortran's dp(0:maxn), which would have indexes from 0 to 4010? No, that can't be. Because 0 to 4010 would be 4011 elements, but in code the maxn is 4010. Wait the code says: in Java, new int[maxn], so maxn is 4010, indexes 0 to 4009. So the Fortran array should be declared as 0:maxn-1? Wait in the Java code, dp is initialized with new int[maxn], so size maxn, indexes 0 to maxn-1. So Fortran array needs to be index from 0 to maxn-1. Because in the loops, in Java the inner j runs up to dp.length (which is maxn), but in Java, the maximum index is maxn-1, so the j in Java last iteration is at maxn-1. Wait the code loops while j < dp.length, so j goes up to maxn-1. Therefore, in Fortran, the dp array should have indices 0:maxn-1. So we need to declare it as:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:maxn-1) :: dp\n\nThen the loop can go from arr[i] to maxn-1. So the parameter:\n\ninteger, parameter :: maxn = 4010\n\nThus array is 0 to 4009 inclusive. So in the code's declaration:\n\nThen, in the loops:\n\ndo i=1,3\n\n    coin = arr(i)\n\n    do j = coin, maxn-1 ! since maxn-1 is the upper index.\n\n        if ( dp(j - coin) .eq. -huge(... ) then, maybe?\n\nBut what about the max. To get the max between current dp[j] and dp[j-coin]+1.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\ncurrent_val1 = dp(j)\n\ncurrent_val2 = dp(j - coin) +1\n\nthen dp(j) = max(current_val1, current_val2 )\n\nBut in Fortran, if dp[j - coin] was set to the min value, then adding 1 to it may lead to an overflow, but perhaps the problem's constraints prevent it. Like if the coin values can form the number, otherwise min remains.\n\nHmm, the original DP approach uses the max, so if even if dp[j - coin] is min, then that path is invalid, so we choose the existing value if it's better. So in the code it'll work.\n\nNow, in the inner loop, the code must iterate j from arr[i] (the coin's value) to maxn-1.\n\nWait, but 'coin' can be as big as say 4000 (if a,b,c are up to N). So the coin could be larger than j, but then j - coin would go negative, so that's impossible. So in the loop for j, they need to ensure that the coin's value is <= j. But inside the loop, when j is >= coin, but for j - coin down to 0.\n\nWait, the problem here is that dp[j-coin] might have been set to a very low value (like -2^31), but in that case, adding 1 would be worse than the current dp[j]. But that's okay. So even if j-coin is larger than zero but has not been reached, then it's okay to compare and not overwrite.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndo i =1,3  \n    coin = arr(i)\n    do j = coin, maxn-1\n        dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - coin) +1 )\n    end do\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java it's:\n\ndp[j] = Math.max( dp[j], dp[j-arr[i]] +1 )\n\nYes, that's the same logic here.\n\nFinally, we need to print dp(n). So after the loops, output the value of dp(n). But need to check that n is within the array's indices. The array is from 0 to maxn-1, and since in the problem, n is read as input, which is <= the maxn? Well, I suppose that the problem constraints allow n up to 4010, so if n is up to that, then the array can hold it. \n\nBut in Fortran, writing something like:\n\nwrite(*,*) dp(n)\n\nBut what if dp(n) hasn't been reached? Like, if none of the combinations can sum to n, then dp(n) would be the initial value (either min or 0? No, in the setup, the first initialization loop sets the first n elements (if n is within the array) as MIN, except dp(0). So if n is larger than maxn, but according to the code, maxn is 4010 which covers the problem's input? \n\nAssuming the problem constraints set n up to 4000+, that's okay. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nNow code structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_189_A\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer, parameter :: maxn = 4010\n  integer :: dp(0:maxn-1)\n  integer :: n, a, b, c, i, j, coin\n  integer, dimension(3) :: arr\n  integer, parameter :: minval = -2147483648\n\n  ! Read input\n  read(*,*) n\n  read(*,*) a\n  read(*,*) b\n  read(*,*) c\n\n  ! Initialize the array arr with a, b, c\n  arr = [ a, b, c ]\n\n  ! Initialize dp array\n  do i =0, maxn-1\n     dp(i) = 0\n  end do\n\n  ! Set first n elements (indices 0 to n-1) to minval, then set dp(0) to 0\n  do i =0, n-1\n     dp(i) = minval\n  end do\n\n  dp(0) = 0\n\n  ! Now iterate through coins and compute DP\n  do i =1,3\n     coin = arr(i)\n     do j = coin, maxn-1\n        if ( dp(j - coin) +1 > dp(j) ) then  ! Using a condition to avoid max function maybe? or use 'max'\n           dp(j) = dp(j - coin) +1\n        else\n           dp(j) = dp(j)\n        end if\n        ! Alternatively use max\n        ! dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - coin) + 1 ) \n     end do\n  end do\n\n  write(*,*) dp(n) \n\nend program codeforces_189_A\n\nWait a second, but the indices here. When n is greater than maxn-1? Like, suppose n is 4010 when Maxn is4010, then the dp array is 0:4010-1=4009, so n=4010 would be beyond the array. Wait the problem may have specified n up to maxn-1. Since in the Java code, the array has maxn size (with indexes 0-based) so maximum index is maxn-1. Therefore the problem constraints must have n \u2264 maxn-1. Hence, in the code, when n is up to 4009, then dp(n) is okay. If the problem allows n to be equal to maxn, that would be a problem, but I assume it's within constraints.\n\nWait, original code uses maxn =4010 so their DP array can handle n up to 4010-1= 4009. Because array of size maxn (4010) is 0 to 4009. So if the problem has n up to 4009, that's okay.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the initialization loops, when n exceeds maxn, but the read could have n as something over that. But the code would not handle that. Since as per problem constraints, probably okay.\n\nNow, fix the loops. Let me see. Also the initialization, the code starts with filling dp with 0, then loops from 0 to n-1 setting to minval, but after that, dp(0)=0 is set again.\n\nWait, in the first loop:\n\nDo I=0 to maxn-1:\n\n   dp(i) =0.\n\nSecond loop:\n\nI from 0 to n-1\n\n   dp(i) becomes minval.\n\nThen after that, dp(0) is reset to 0 again.\n\nSo that is accurate to the original code.\n\nAnother thing, when setting arr, since in Java arrays start at 0, but in our code here, arr is 3 elements (1-based). So that's okay. So arr(1)= a, arr(2)=b, arr(3)=c.\n\nNow in the loops for i=1 to3, so that's correct.\n\nThe calculation in the inner loop can be written with the max function. But Fortran has a function, max(a,b). So:\n\n dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j-coin)+1 )\n\nYes, so I can replace the IF block with that line.\n\nSo updated code inside the loops:\n\n    do i =1,3\n        coin = arr(i)\n        do j = coin, maxn-1\n            dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - coin) +1 )\n        end do\n    end do\n\nWhich is better and concise.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nprogram codeforces_189_A\n   implicit none\n   integer, parameter :: maxn =4010\n   integer, dimension(0:maxn-1) :: dp\n   integer :: n, a, b, c\n   integer :: i,j, coin\n   integer, dimension(3) :: arr\n   integer, parameter :: minval = -2147483648  ! which is the Integer.MIN_VALUE in Java\n\n   read(*,*) n\n   read(*,*) a\n   read(*,*) b\n   read(*,*) c\n   arr = [a, b, c]\n\n   ! Initialize dp to all zero first\n   do i=0, maxn-1\n      dp(i) =0\n   end do\n\n   ! set dp[0..n-1] to minval except dp[0] becomes min then back to 0\n   do i =0, n-1\n      dp(i) = minval\n   end do\n   dp(0) =0 ! revert dp[0] back to zero\n\n   ! main DP loop\n   do i =1,3\n      coin = arr(i)\n      do j= coin, maxn-1\n         dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - coin)+1 )\n      end do\n   end do\n\n   write(*,*) dp(n)\n\nend program codeforces_189_A\n\nWait a second, the code reads a, b,c with three separate read statements. Because in the Java code, after the initial n, it reads three values via scanner, so three scanner.nextInt() calls. But in the Fortran code, after reading n, we can read a,b,c in a single read statement.\n\nAh, right. The code can be adjusted to:\n\nRead them all in one line:\n\n   read(*,*) a, b, c\n\nThat would group them together and read all 3 in one line.\n\nThe original code:\n\nJava reads:\n\nn = scanner.nextInt();\n\nthen a=scanner.nextInt(); ... \n\nSo the second read in the Fortran code could be read(*,*) a, b, c. \n\nSo line:\n\n   read(*,*) a\n   read(*,*) b\n   read(*,*) c\n\nShould be replaced with:\n\n   read(*,*) a, b, c \n\nThat would be more efficient.\n\nSo corrected code:\n\nprogram codeforces_189_A\n   implicit none\n   integer, parameter :: maxn =4010\n   integer, dimension(0:maxn-1) :: dp\n   integer :: n, a, b, c\n   integer :: i,j, coin\n   integer, dimension(3) :: arr\n   integer, parameter :: minval = -2147483648  ! which is the Integer.MIN_VALUE in Java\n\n   read(*,*) n\n   read(*,*) a, b, c\n\n   arr = [a, b, c]\n\n   ! Initialize dp to all zero first\n   do i=0, maxn-1\n      dp(i) =0\n   end do\n\n   ! set dp[0..n-1] to minval except dp[0] becomes min then back to 0\n   do i =0, n-1\n      dp(i) = minval\n   end do\n   dp(0) =0 ! revert dp[0] back to zero\n\n   ! main DP loop\n   do i =1,3\n      coin = arr(i)\n      do j= coin, maxn-1\n         dp(j) = max( dp(j), dp(j - coin)+1 )\n      end do\n   end do\n\n   write(*,*) dp(n)\n\nend program codeforces_189_A\n\nThat should be correct.\n\nNow, let's check a few points:\n\n- The array dp is initialized to all zeros, then the first n elements set to minval, then dp(0) is zero.\n\nWait, the first loop sets dp(0) to minval first. Then the next line dp(0) =0.\n\nYes. So that is exactly like the Java code.\n\n- The main loops iterate each coin, and the outer loops are the same.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=0, then the output is 0 (since dp[0]=0). \n\nI think this translation is correct."
