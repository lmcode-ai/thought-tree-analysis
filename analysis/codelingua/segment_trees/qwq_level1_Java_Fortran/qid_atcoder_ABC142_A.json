    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. The main function here is taking a double input from the user. Then it calculates something called countOdd by dividing the input by 2 and rounding it. After that, it computes a result as (countOdd divided by input) with 10 decimal places of precision, and prints it out. \n\nFirst step, I need to read an input. In Java, they use a BufferedReader, but in Fortran, you can just read directly from the standard input. So I'll have a variable, maybe 'input' which is a real number. \n\nWait, but in Fortran, variables need to be declared first. So the program will start by declaring variables. Let's think. The input is a double, so in Fortran, that would be a real(kind=8). The countOdd is calculated as input divided by 2, rounded. Oh, Math.round in Java rounds to the nearest integer. So the countOdd is essentially the closest integer to input divided by 2, right?\n\nIn Fortran, converting that rounding might need something like NINT (nearest integer function). Wait, no. Because in Java, Math.round(double) returns a long. So for a double, when you round it, is it the nearest integer? So for example, input/2 is the value to round. Let's say the input is 3.7, then input/2 is 1.85, and Math.round would give 2.0. So in Fortran, we can use the NINT function, which rounds to nearest integer. But since input is a real(kind=8), these variables should probably be in double precision. \n\nWait, in Fortran, if the input is a real*8, then dividing by 2 gives another real*8, and when we apply NINT to that, which converts to integer, but we can assign that to a real variable or just use it as an integer? Well, let's see \u2014 countOdd is stored as a double in Java. So in Fortran, perhaps countOdd is a real variable, but the initial calculation is the rounded integer value. So maybe in Fortran, countOdd is integer? Or it's better to keep it real? Hmm, since it's used in division with input, which is real.\n\nSo, here is the plan: \n\n Declare variables:\n- input as a double precision real (kind=8)\n- countOdd as integer (since it's the rounded value)\n- result as double precision real, or maybe with enough precision, then written to the required decimal.\n\nThen first step, read input from stdin:\n\nread(*,*) input\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, you have to be careful with the input, but using the standard read statement should work. Let's see. Exception handling is there in Java, but Fortran typically does not have try-catch blocks unless using some extensions. The user probably doesn't need exception handling in the Fortran code as rigorously as in Java. The original code catches IOException and NumberFormatException, but in Fortran, if the input is not a number, the read statement would fail and the program might terminate with an error. So perhaps that's acceptable here. \n\nSo first, read in the input. Then compute countOdd as the rounded integer, which uses NINT(input/2.0d0). \n\nThen compute result as (countOdd / input). \n\nWait, because in Java, countOdd is a double. Wait in the code, the line countOdd is double countOdd = Math.round(input/2); so Math.round returns a long, but they cast it to a double? Or no, actually in the Java code, the variable is declared as a double. Wait Math.round(input/2) returns a long when the input is a double. Because Math.round(double) returns a long. So in Java, assigning a long to a double would work, but in Fortran, the variable countOdd can be integer. \n\nTherefore in Fortran, since countOdd is the rounded value, let me have countOdd as an integer. \n\nSo countOdd = nint(input / 2.0d0) \n\nWait but the input is a double, so input/2 is a double, then NINT would make it an integer. \n\nYes. \n\nThen the result is countOdd divided by input. That's a real number. \n\nJava's code then creates a BigDecimal from that value, sets the scale to 10 decimal places using RoundingMode.HALF_UP. \n\nHmm, in Fortran, how to handle the precision. The problem requires to output the result with 10 decimal digits. So we need to compute countOdd/input accurately as a double, but when it's divided, perhaps with enough precision, and then print it with 10 digits after the decimal point. \n\nWait\u957f\u957f\u6309. The original code uses BigDecimal with setScale(10, HALF_UP). So that ensures that the quotient is rounded to 10 decimal places. \n\nSo in Fortran, how do we perform division with round-to-nearest and then format the output accordingly. \n\nWait, in Fortran, if you divide two real numbers with double precision, the result is also to double precision. However, when you want to round it to exactly 10 decimal places. \n\nSo maybe we can compute the value as (countOdd/input), then format the output to 12 characters, with something like F12.10, but adjusted properly. Wait perhaps:\n\nWe can compute the value as a real(kind=8) variable, say \"result = dble(countOdd) / input\". Wait countOdd is an integer, so converting to double precision first to prevent integer division.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nYes, since countOdd is integer, input is real, then dividing integer by real gives a real. But to ensure that in double precision, the variables are declared as kind=8. So let's make the variables double precision.\n\nWait perhaps better to spell this out explicitly.\n\nLet me redeclare variables properly.\n\nFirst, in the code:\n\n    real(kind=8) :: input, result\n    integer :: countOdd\n\n    read(*,*) input \n\n    countOdd = nint(input / 2.0d0)\n\n    result = real(countOdd, kind=8) / input \n\n    then print with 10 decimal places.\n\nWait but in Java, the division is (countOdd / input). Since countOdd is stored as a double in Java, which in the Fortran code, when converted to a real(kind=8) then divided by input, which is also real(kind=8), that would make it accurate.\n\nHmm, but perhaps in Fortran, the formula is correct.\n\nThen printing the result: To print with 10 decimal places, in Fortran you can use format statement. Like:\n\nwrite(*, '(F12.10)') result \n\nWait but how many digits before decimal? The F12.10 would allocate 12 characters total: 2 before decimal, and 10 after, but if the number is larger, it will go to scientific notation. Alternatively using something like '(G12.10)' which is like general format (G) which would choose between fixed or exponential based on the value, but maybe the problem expects fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to write something like '(F14.10)' which has more space for the integer part and 10 decimals. The exact format may vary but the key is that 10 decimal places are present. \n\nWait, let's see the example. Suppose input is 3. and countOdd is 2. Then result is 2/3 = 0.6666666667 (when rounded to 10 decimals). The Java code uses BigDecimal with scale 10 and HALF_UP rounding. Let me see what that does.\n\nThe Java code's result is:\n\nnew BigDecimal(countOdd/input) then sets scale to 10 with HALF_UP. So the division should be done with sufficient accuracy to properly round. However, since countOdd is an integer and input is a floating point, when divided, we can get a precise value (if the numbers are such that it can be represented, though some fractions won't be exact, leading to the need for rounding after 10 decimals). \n\nIn Fortran, if both numbers are double precision, then the division is performed to double precision (about 15-17 digits). When outputting 10 decimals, Fortran's print statement (with the right format) should automatically handle this as the round to the displayed precision. \n\nWait the Java code's code is setting scale to 10 with half-up, so it's exactly the way the number is rounded to 10 decimal places. In Fortran, the output with F12.10 would do these rounding according to the implementation, but I think it's fairly standard. \n\nThus the plan is: \n\nVariables: \n\n- input is double precision real (8 bytes)\n\n- countOdd is integer\n\n- result is double precision real \n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead input\n\nCompute countOdd = nint(input/2.0)\n\nResult = dble(countOdd)/input  (since countOdd is integer and dividing by input which is real)\n\nPrint with 10 decimal places using format F followed by the correct number of digits. \n\nNow some possible syntax in Fortran.\n\nFirst, the code:\n\nprogram main\nimplicit none\ndouble precision :: input, result\ninteger :: countOdd\n\nread *, input\n! compute countOdd as rounded to nearest integer of input/2 \ncountOdd = nint(input / 2.d0)\nresult = dble(countOdd)/input\n\n! Now print with 10 decimal digits\nwrite(*, '(F12.10)') result\nend program main\n\nWait but what if the input is a very large number? The F12.10 might not have enough space. For example, if input is 1e9, countOdd would be around 5e8. Then the result would be ~0.5, which fits in F12.10. Wait 0.5000000000 is 12 characters. Hmm. But if the input is, say, 0.0000000001, then the result would be around 5e8 (countOdd would be 0, so 0 divided by 0.0000000001 is zero? Wait let me think: for input of 0.0000000001, the nint(input/2) would be nint(5e-10) which is 0. So countOdd=0, so result is zero. So even then it would be okay. For numbers that are exactly 2, giving a result of 1.0000000000, which is 12 characters. \n\nBut maybe to be safe, using more digits in the format. Like F14.10, so two digits before decimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a G format: for example, G12.10, which allows scientific notation if needed, but perhaps the problem wants fixed point always.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: in the format, we can use F20.10 or similar.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the code in Java:\n\nIn Java, when creating the BigDecimal, it's possible that the division countOdd/input is done precisely, but in Fortran, when we do dble(countOdd)/input, since both are double precision, then that's fine. \n\nWait but the original Java code did:\n\nBigDecimal result = new BigDecimal(countOdd / input);\n\nWait countOdd is double here. So in Fortran, countOdd is integer, but converted to double precision via dble() so yeah, that's the same. \n\nNow the Java's BigDecimal is using setScale, which rounds to 10 decimal digits. \n\nFortran's write statement, when using F12.10, will typically round to the nearest 10th decimal place according to the floating-point value, because when you write with that format, it should round to the required decimal places. \n\nTherefore this approach should be okay.\n\nWait, but let me check possible edge cases. Suppose countOdd / input is exactly 0.123456789577, then with 10 decimals would it be 0.123456790? or is there a possibility of precision error?\n\nWell in Fortran, the default decimal format should use arithmetic rounding.\n\nAssuming that is correct, then the code would be correct.\n\nNow, what about input being zero? Wait, in the Java code, dividing by zero would cause an error. The original code's input is taken as a double, and if someone enters 0, then division by zero occurs. The Java code would throw an exception (Arithmetic Exception when parsing maybe? Wait in Java, actually the code first parses the input as a double. If someone enters zero, that's okay, because Double.parseDouble(\"0\") works. Then input/2 is zero, so Math.round gives zero, and countOdd is zero. Then countOdd/input is zero divided by zero, which would be NaN. Wait that's a problem. So in the Java code, if the user enters zero, you have a division by zero?\n\nAh, that's a bug in the original Java code. Because when input is zero, it would result in 0/0 which is NaN. Same for negative numbers?\n\nBut in any case, the Fortran code would also have exactly the same issue. The problem statement probably expects inputs for which countOdd is not zero when input is zero, but maybe that's beyond the translation task. The user just wants the translation.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code proceeds as per above.\n\nAnother consideration: the NINT function in Fortran operates on the value, so for positive and negative numbers?\n\nWait the original Java code handles the rounding with Math.round which rounds to the closest long. NINT in Fortran is the nearest integer. So that should be matching.\n\nWait, for example, input is 2.5, countOdd would be Math.round(2.5/2) \u2192 Math.round(1.25) is 1. Java code would calculate countOdd as 1. \n\nThen NINT(1.25d0) is also 1. \n\nAnother example input 3.0 \u2192 input/2 is 1.5 \u2192 rounded to 2? Math.round(1.5) rounds to 2. NINT(1.5d0) in Fortran would be 2? Let me confirm. \n\nYes, the NINT function rounds 1.5 to 2. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nWhat if it is negative? For example: input is -3.5 \u2192 -3.5/2 = -1.75 \u2192 Math.round(-1.75) is (-2), and NINT(-1.75d0) would be -2. Correct. \n\nAnother edge case: when input is 1, then countOdd is Math.round (0.5)=1? Wait 0.5 would round to 1. Wait wait 0.5 is .0.5 and in Java's Math.round, for doubles, 0.5 rounds up to 1. Because Math.round(0.5) returns 1. So in Fortran NINT(0.5d0), the NINT function rounds halfway cases to the even integer. Wait, does NINT(0.5) round to 1 or 0?\n\nThe Fortran standard says that NINT rounds away from zero when halfway between two integers, so for 0.5 \u2192 1, -0.5 \u2192 -1. Therefore, correct.\n\nTherefore, NINT is correct here.\n\nHence, the code should work.\n\nAnother consideration: the Java code uses RoundingMode.HALF_UP, which also rounds 0.5 up. So that matches with NINT's behavior. So the code should be correct.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nThe Fortran code would be structured as follows.\n\nBut let me check the variable types.\n\nWait in declaring variables in Fortran, you can have:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc142_a\n\nimplicit none\n\nreal(kind=8) :: input, result\n\ninteger :: countOdd\n\ncharacter (len=100) :: line\n\n! reading the input. But how to handle invalid inputs?\n\n! The original Java code catches NumberFormatException, which in Fortran if the user inputs something not a number, the program will crash. Since the problem might require handling only valid inputs, perhaps the code can proceed.\n\nBut the user's problem is about code translation, so perhaps the exception handling can be omitted as Fortran typically doesn't have that. The Fortran code can proceed without the exceptions, and in an actual contest scenario, inputs are given correctly.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc142_a\n    implicit none\n    real(kind=8) :: input, result\n    integer :: countOdd\n\n    ! Read input\n    read(*,*) input\n\n    ! Compute countOdd as rounded to nearest integer of input/2\n    countOdd = nint(input / 2.d0)\n    result = dble(countOdd)/input\n\n    ! Write with 10 decimal places\n    write(*, '(F12.10)') result\n\nend program atcoder_abc142_a\n\nWait but when testing this code, how?\n\nLet me test with example.\n\nExample 1: input 3 \u2192 countOdd is nint(3/2)=nint(1.5)=2\n\nResult is 2/3 = 0.6666666667 (rounded to 10 decimals).\n\nSo in Fortran write statement using F12.10 should give that as 0.6666666667.\n\nAnother example, input is 2 \u2192 countOdd=1 \u2192 1/2 \u2192 0.5 \u2192 output 0.5000000000.\n\nAnother test case, input 1 \u2192 countOdd =nint(0.5)=1 \u2192 1/1=1 \u2192 output 1.0000000000.\n\nAnother input 4.0 \u2192 countOdd is 2 \u2192 2/4=0.5 \u2192 as expected.\n\nHmm, but let's think of a fractional input like 2.3.\n\ninput is 2.3 \u2192 input/2=1.15 \u2192 countOdd =1 (nint(1.15)=1)\n\nresult is 1/2.3 \u2248 0.4347826087 (which would round to 0.4347826087? with 10 decimals).\n\nThe Java code's result would calculate 1 divided by 2.3. They use countOdd as 1. So in Fortran, the same.\n\nWait, exact value:\n\n1/2.3 = 0.4347826086956522...\n\nSo the printed value with 10 decimals would be 0.4347826087 (rounded at 10th decimal). \n\nFortran's output with F12.10 would print 0.4347826087, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code is as above."
