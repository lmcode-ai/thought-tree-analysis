    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at what the Java code does first. \n\nThe Java program takes two integers a and b from the user. Then it calculates a sum by adding the larger of the two numbers to the sum, then subtracting 1 from that larger number, and repeating this process once more. Finally, it prints the total sum.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, I need to read two integers. Let me remember how input works in Fortran. Probably using READ(*,*) to get the values. \n\nThe loop is for i in 0 to 1 (since it's less than 2, so two iterations). Each time, compare a and b. If a is larger or equal, add a to sum and decrement a. Else, add b and decrement b. \n\nWait, variables in Fortran are declared with types. Let's see, the variables a, b, sum are integers. So I should declare them as INTEGER :: a, b, sum. \n\nStarting with the program structure. The main program in Fortran can be written as a program block. Like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC124_A\n    implicit none\n    ! declarations here\n    ! code here\nend program atcoder_ABC124_A\n\nOkay. Then read a and b. \n\nThen the loop: do i = 1, 2. Wait, Java uses 0-based, but the loop runs twice. So in Fortran, using a loop from 1 to 2 would work. The index variable isn't used inside, so it doesn't matter. \n\nInside the loop, the same condition: if a >= b then take a, else take b. \n\nWait in each iteration, subtract 1 from the chosen one. So in the first iteration, take the larger, subtract 1. Then in the next iteration, the numbers are now a-1 and b (if a was larger), or a and b-1, etc. \n\nSo in Fortran code:\n\nsum = 0\ndo i = 1, 2\n    if (a >= b) then\n        sum = sum + a\n        a = a -1\n    else\n        sum = sum + b\n        b = b -1\n    end if\nend do\n\nThen print the sum. Using write(*,*) sum.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nDECLARE VARIABLES:\nINTEGER :: a, b, sum, i\n\nRead a and b:\nread(*,*) a, b\n\nInitialize sum to 0.\n\nWait, in Java, the sum is initialized to 0. So in Fortran, sum = 0.\n\nWait, variables need to be declared before assignment. So:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC124_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: a, b, sum, i\n\n    read(*,*) a, b\n    sum = 0\n    do i = 1, 2\n        if (a >= b) then\n            sum = sum + a\n            a = a -1\n        else\n            sum = sum + b\n            b = b -1\n        end if\n    end do\n    write(*,*) sum\n\nend program atcoder_ABC124_A\n\nWait, that's the basic structure. Let me check for any possible issues.\n\nDoes Fortran handle the read with two integers correctly? The user inputs two numbers, space-separated, and READ(*,*) a, b should read them into a and b. \n\nYes. \n\nThe loop runs twice, so two iterations. Each time, pick the larger, subtract 1. \n\nYes. \n\nTesting with an example. Suppose a=5, b=4. First iteration: add 5, a becomes 4. Then next iteration, a and b are 4 and 4. So we add 4 again, sum is 9. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example, a=3 and b=5. First picks 5 (sum 5), then b becomes 4. Next compare 3 vs 4: takes 4, sum is 9. Total 5+4=9. Correct.\n\nAnother case where a and b are equal. Say 2 and 2. First iteration: take 2, subtract 1 (now 1 and 2). Next iteration take 2, so sum is 4. \n\nWait wait, no. When a and b are equal in first iteration, after subtracting a becomes a-1 (so 1 and 2?), wait no. Let's see:\n\nWait initial a=2, b=2. \n\nFirst iteration: a >= b is true (since equal). So add a (2), then a becomes 1. Then second iteration, a is 1, b is 2. Now, since a < b, take b (2) and subtract 1. So sum is 2 +2 =4. Which is correct.\n\nYes, so the code seems to do that. \n\nTherefore, the Fortran code should be as above. Let me check the code again for syntax.\n\nThe loop variable i is declared as part of the INTEGER list. That's okay.\n\nThe write statement uses (*,*) which is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's the right translation."
