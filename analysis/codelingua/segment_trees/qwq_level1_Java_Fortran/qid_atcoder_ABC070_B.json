So for example:\n\na=0, d=3 \u2192 a \u2264d. Then, in the a <c case, the code proceeds to compute:\n\nthe minimum between b (whatever) and d.\n\nSuppose b= 5; d=4 \u2192 min(5,4)=4. Since c is, for example, 2, so 4 -2 = 2. That is correct. But what if b is 1 and d is 2, c is 2. Wait:\n\nSuppose a=0 < c=2. Check first condition: c > b? b is 1, c=2 \u2192 c>1: yes \u2192 then first condition is true, so first case prints 0.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main part of the code reads four integers a, b, c, d from input. Then it checks some conditions to determine the output. The output is either 0, Math.min(b, d) - c, or the difference between the second and first elements of a sorted list of these four numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to handle the input in Fortran. In Java, they use an InputReader class with a nextInt method. But Fortran typically reads from stdin using read or read(*,*) statements. So the InputReader here can be replaced with simple Fortran reads. \n\nLet me outline the structure:\n\n1. Read a, b, c, d. Probably with a read(*,*) statement.\n2. Check the conditions:\n   - If c > b \u2192 print 0\n   - Else if a > d \u2192 print 0\n   - Else if a < c \u2192 print min(b,d) - c\n   - Else, create a list of the four numbers, sort them, then output the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list. Wait, no, looking at the code again: it's l.get(2) - l.get(1). Wait, in Java, ArrayList is 0-based, so the list elements after sorting are ordered from smallest to largest. The four elements are added in order a,b,c,d. So after sorting, l will be sorted in increasing order. Then l.get(1) is the second element, l.get(2) is third? Wait no: the indices in Java for the ArrayList are 0-based. Let's see:\n   The list after adding a, b, c, d will have elements [a,b,c,d], then sorted. So after sorting, the list's first element is the smallest, and the next elements go up. So if you have a list of four elements sorted, l.get(1) is the first element, l.get(2) second, etc. Wait no, indices start at 0. Let's see, after sorting, the four numbers are in order. The code then does get(2) and get(1). Wait, no: get(2) is the third element in the list's new order. Wait, no, in Java's Collections.sort, the list is sorted in natural order, so from smallest to largest. So for example, if the elements after sort are [x1, x2, x3, x4], l.get(0)=x1, l.get(1)=x2, l.get(2)=x3, l.get(3)=x4. So l.get(2) - l.get(1) would be the gap between the third and second elements, but that seems a bit odd. Wait, but the code's logic is such that when the else case is triggered (i.e., when a >= c and the first two conditions aren't met), it creates the list and sorts it, then outputs l.get(2)-l.get(1). Wait, perhaps the fourth element's position is such that the overlapping might be between the sorted first two? Hmm, maybe I need to make sure I get the Fortran code to replicate that calculation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, in the else case, they take the four numbers, sort them, then take the second and first elements (since get(1) would be index 1 after 0-based, but in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default so perhaps I need to adjust the indices accordingly. Wait, but in Fortran, array indices start at 1 (unless specified otherwise), so after sorting in Fortran, the first element is the smallest, second next, etc. So the equivalent of l.get(2) in Java (the third element in the Java list, since 0-based) would be the second element in Fortran's array? Wait no. Let me clarify:\n\nJava list after sorting has elements [x0, x1, x2, x3]. The code is doing x2 - x1 (the difference between third and second elements?). Hmm, that might be different, so perhaps the code's logic was intended to compute the overlapping between the intervals [a,b] and [c,d], and the maximum overlap. The problem might be from AtCoder's ABC070_B, which this code is solving. I should check the logic, maybe using the interval overlap. \n\nWait, let me think again: the problem's code. The code is checking these conditions:\n\nCase 1: if c > b \u2192 no overlap. So output 0.\n\nCase 2: a >d \u2192 also no overlap. 0.\n\nCase 3: a <c \u2192 then the start of the overlap is c, the end is the min(b, d). So output min(b,d) -c. \n\nElse (when a >=c and a is not less than c, so a would be >=c, but also considering that previous conditions failed), then perhaps when the intervals partially overlap in such a way that a is between c and d?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is calculating the length of the overlap between the intervals [a, b] and [c, d].\n\nThe standard way is to compute the difference between the minimum of the end points and the maximum of the start points, if that's positive. Otherwise, zero.\n\nThe maximum of (a, c) is the start, the minimum of (b,d) is the end. The overlap is end - start if start <= end else zero. \n\nLooking back, in the code's first case: if c > b, which would mean that interval [c,d] starts after [a,b] ends, so overlap is zero.\n\nSimilarly, if a>d \u2192 interval [a,b] starts after [c,d] ends \u2192 overlap zero.\n\nElse, if a < c \u2192 then the start is c, end is the minimum of b and d. So the overlap length is max(0, end - start).\n\nWait in code:\n\nElse if (a < c) \u2192 then compute min(b,d) - c, but only if this is positive? Because otherwise, if for instance the end is before c, but that should be covered in previous conditions. \n\nWait, let me see the code logic steps:\n\nAfter checking first two cases (output 0):\n\nElse if a < c \u2192 then the start is c. The end is min of (b, d). So the overlap is min(b,d) - c. But what if min(b,d) is less than c? Then that would give negative, but in that case, if that's allowed, but the code would still output it, which is wrong. So maybe the code is written under the assumption that the previous conditions (like if min(b,d) < c then that would have triggered the first condition.) \n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose a < c \u2192 so the code does the else case (the first two conditions were not true, since in the first condition, if c > b then first case would have been called. So when we enter the a < c case, the first condition was not true, meaning that c was <=b. So min(b,d) is at least c. Because in this case, since c <=b (since the first condition c >b is not true here). Wait, no: the first condition is if (c > b), which would check whether c is greater than b. If that's not true, then the code proceeds. So in the else-if (a <c) condition, the value of C could be <=b (since the first condition was false). Therefore, min(b, d) would be between c and b if d is >= c. Wait perhaps the code's logic is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is a bit error-prone but works because of the prior conditions. Let me not overcomplicate the code's logic, and just need to translate it as is.\n\nNow, moving to Fortran. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, variables a, b, c, d. They are integers. So declare them as integer variables.\n\nThe first part: read input. Since in java they read via InputReader's nextInt. So in Fortran, perhaps something like:\n\nread*, a,b,c,d\n\nThen proceed with the conditions.\n\nFirst, check if c > b \u2192 if so, output 0.\n\nElse if a > d \u2192 output 0.\n\nElse if a < c \u2192 then compute min(b,d) -c, print this.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to create a list of a,b,c,d, sort them, then output (the 2nd element sorted minus the 1st element? Wait in the code:\n\nIn the else block (after those conditions), the list is created with a, b, c, d. Sorted. Then get(2) - get(1). Wait, in the Java code the sorted list is after a sorted in natural( increasing) order, so after sorting, the list is ordered [smallest, next, ... next, largest].\n\nWait the list is added in the order: a,b,c,d \u2192 sorted. So after sorting, the list elements are in order from smallest to largest. The code then takes l.get(2), which is the third element (since indices start at 0) minus the second? Wait, l.get(2) would be third element, and l.get(1) is the second. So the difference between the third and second elements?\n\nWait why would that be the case. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant l.get(1) - l.get(0), but looking back:\n\nWait in the code, after adding a, b, c, d to the list (so the list has four elements, then sorted, then they are doing get(2) - get(1). Wait the indices 2 and 1 here would be third and second element (since 0 is first, 1 is second, 2 third, 3 fourth). The sorted list are four elements in order x1, x2, x3, x4 (sorted increasingly). \n\nSo l.get(2) is x3 (3rd element), l.get(1) is x2 (second). But x3 -x2 would be difference between third and second elements, but perhaps in this case, when else is entered, the a >= c but a or b...? Maybe the intended code is to take the second element of the sorted list minus the third? No, that would be negative. Maybe the code is actually for some other logic, but we just need to translate it exactly.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, to do the same logic as the code:\n\nCreate an array of the four numbers a,b,c,d, sort them in ascending order, then take the (third element - second element). Or in Fortran terms, since arrays start at 1, after sorting the array becomes [x1, x2, x3, x4], so the third element is x3 (index3), second is x2 (index2). Thus difference would be x3 -x2. But why would they subtract those 2? \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's supposed to be the second and third elements' difference? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the code's original problem had overlapping between intervals, and the sorted list is used for finding overlapping ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I just have to translate the logic as is.\n\nNow, the key steps:\n\nWhen the else block is executed (i.e., the first two conditions are false and a is not less than c):\n\nSo the else part requires creating the list, sort, then output l.get(2) - l.get(1). In Java that's (third - second). So in Fortran's arrays, the third and second elements after sorting.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nWe can create an integer array l of size 4.\n\nl(1)=a, l(2)=b, etc.? Or l(1) is a, l(2) b, l(3)c, l(4) d? Wait, in Java, the list is created with:\n\n l.add(a); l.add(b); l.add(c); l.add(d), so the elements list is exactly [a, b, c, d]. Then sorted. \n\nSo in Fortran, the array l(4) = [a, b, c, d], then sort it, then get the second and third elements (since array indices start at 1, sorted list's indices 1,2,3,4). The third index would be element3, second index2. So element3 - element2 \u2192 that is l(3)-l(2). \n\nWait in code logic would be l.get(2) minus l.get(1)? Wait in Java the indices are 0 based:\n\nList after sorting is [x0, x1, x2, x3], so l.get(2) is x2, l.get(1) is x1 \u2192 difference x2 -x1. In Fortran's sorted array [x1, x2, x3, x4], that would be elements 1-based indices. So the difference would be l(3)-l(2). Wait no: x0 in Java is first element (l(0)), then x1 (index1), etc. So x2 (index2) corresponds to third element, which in Fortran's sorted list is index3?\n\nWait maybe there is confusion between 0-based and 1-based:\n\nLet me take an example. Imagine the numbers are 1,3,2,4 \u2192 sorted would be [1,2,3,4]. In Java, the indices are:\n\nl.get(0)=1, l.get(1)=2, l.get(2)=3, l.get(3)=4.\n\nThus, l.get(2) (3) - l.get(1) (2)=1. \n\nIn Fortran, the array will be l(1)=1, l(2)=2, l(3)=3, l(4)=4. Thus, l(3) - l(2) =1, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the difference in Fortran would be l(3) - l(2).\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the code for that else part is to output l(3) - l(2).\n\nNow, to code this in Fortran:\n\nIn the else block:\n\nAllocate an array, sort it, then compute difference between 3rd and 2nd elements.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nIn the Fortran code, the steps are:\n\nRead a, b, c, d.\n\nCheck the conditions in order.\n\nFirst condition: if (c > b) then print 0.\n\nElse if (a>d) \u2192 0.\n\nElse if (a < c) \u2192 then compute min(b, d) - c, then print. \n\nElse:\n\nNeed to create an array l(4) containing a, b, c, d \u2192 l(:) = [ / a, b, c, d / ] ?\n\nThen sort it (Fortran has sorting functions, but may have to write a sort or use a built-in or an intrinsic?).\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can use the intrinsic 'merge sort' with array functions, but I think the simplest approach is to put the four elements in an array and sort them, perhaps using the built-in sort (like in Fortran 90?).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write a function or use the sort statement.\n\nWait I'm not sure what's the best way. Let's think: To sort an array in Fortran.\n\nAssuming Fortran90+, perhaps:\n\ninteger :: temp\n\nDo a bubble sort manually? For four elements that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively use the built-in method?\n\nIn modern Fortran:\n\ncall merge_sort(l) \u2192 but merge sort may not be available, you need to use the intrinsic, which may be as follows.\n\nWait, perhaps using ISPFSV and such, but it may not be straightforward for portability. Alternatively, use the 'sort' intrinsic function which was introduced in Fortran 95 or later?\n\nWait maybe there is an intrinsic routine in the language.\n\nLooking up:\n\nFortran's standard does not have an intrinsic sort function, but many compilers provide one. \n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\nSorting a small array (4 elements) can be done via Bubble Sort manually since it's trivial.\n\nAlternatively, use an array with a sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the algorithm:\n\nl having 4 elements:\n\nTo sort in ascending order, perhaps:\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just code the four numbers into variables and determine the sorted order.\n\nBut manually coding the sort may be error-prone, but since the list is four elements, perhaps manageable.\n\nFirst, create an array of the four numbers.\n\ninteger :: l(4)\n\nl = [a,b,c,d]\n\nthen perform sort in ascending order. \n\nIn Fortran 95 and above, you can use the following:\n\ncall msort(l, 4, 1) \u2192 but that requires a sort\u4f8b\u884c routine, perhaps not standardized.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to write a helper function to sort the array.\n\nAlternatively, use the built-in function 'omp_sort' or another?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following code structure:\n\nallocate the array, then do sorting via the built-in function.\n\nWait maybe the simplest way is to use a small piece of code for the sort.\n\nAlternatively, use the sort procedure. Here's an approach:\n\nTo sort an array in ascending order manually for four elements:\n\nl(1) is a, l(2) b; etc.\n\nWe can sort using a simple algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, use selection sort:\n\ndo i=1,3\n\n   find the minimum element from i to 4, swap.\n\nSo for four elements:\n\nFirst pass (i=1):\n\nfind min between 1-4 elements:\n\n min_val = min(l(1), l(2), l(3), l(4))\n\n But since it's easier to avoid functions:\n\nmanual comparison.\n\nAlternatively, better to code step by step.\n\nBut I might just write a simple sort for four elements.\n\nAlternatively, even if the code is a bit longer, it's manageable.\n\nBut maybe an easier way is to realize that after getting the four elements, the sorted array is the same as [min, next, next, max].\n\nWait, perhaps the code can compute the four elements and sort using the following:\n\nAlthough I might forget a step. Alternatively, use the following bubble sort for four elements.\n\nHere's how:\n\ninteger :: temp\n\ndo i =1 to 3\n\n   do j=i+1 to4\n\n      if (l(i) > l(j)) then\n\n          swap l(i) and l(j)\n\n      end if\n\n   end do \n\nBut even better to just code this for four elements.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nl(1)=a; l(2)=b; l(3)=c; l(4)=d\n\ncall sort(l)\n\nthen code the sort.\n\nWait perhaps the Fortran can use this code.\n\nAlternatively, here is how to sort four elements:\n\ntemp = l(1)\n\nlet me write a routine.\n\nAlternatively, here's a code snippet for the sorting function:\n\nBut perhaps for brevity, let's just code four elements in four variables.\n\nAlternatively, use the selection sort approach.\n\nOption 1: code bubble sort for four elements.\n\nIn code:\n\nl(1) = a; l(2)=b; l(3)=c; l(4)=d\n\n! perform bubble sort\n\ndo i = 1,3\n\n   do j =1,4 -i\n\n      if (l(j) > l(j+1)) then\n\n          temp = l(j)\n\n          l(j) = l(j+1)\n\n          l(j+1) = temp\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend do\n\nWait, however, I think in bubble sort the code should be:\n\nThe outer loop controls the number of passes. For n elements, n-1 passes. For four elements, three passes needed.\n\nIn each pass (i), we compare adjacent pairs from 1 to 4 - i.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nFor i in 1 to 3 (number of passes):\n\n   For each pair j from 1 to 4 -i:\n\n       compare j and j+1.\n\nThus, for the first pass (i=1):\n\n   j runs from 1 to 3 (because 4-1=3)\n\n   so compare 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. Swap if needed.\n\nSecond pass (i=2):\n\n   j runs from 1 to 2 (4-2=2)\n\n   compare 1-2, 2-3.\n\nThird pass (i=3):\n\n  j runs from 1 to 1 (4-3=1)\n\n   only compare 1-2.\n\nThus, this should sort the array in four elements.\n\nThis would be code.\n\nAlternatively, let me code this in Fortran.\n\nOnce sorted, the desired difference is l(3)-l(2) \u2192 the third and second elements in the 1-based array.\n\nThen print that difference.\n\nNow, putting all the code together.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nStart with\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC070_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: a, b, c, d\n\ninteger :: l(4), temp, i, j\n\nread(*,*) a, b, c, d\n\n if (c > b ) then\n\n    write(*,*) 0\n\n else if (a >d) then\n\n    write(*,*)0\n\n else if (a < c) then\n\n    write(*,*) min(b, d) - c\n\n else\n\n    l(1)=a; l(2)=b; l(3)=c ; l(4)=d\n\n    ! sort l in ascending order\n\n    do i=1,3\n\n       do j=1,4 -i\n\n          if (l(j) > l(j+1) ) then\n\n             temp = l(j)\n\n             l(j) = l(j+1)\n\n             l(j+1) = temp\n\n          end if\n\n       end do\n\n    end do\n\n    write(*,*) l(3) - l(2)\n\n end if\n\nend program.\n\nWait but I need to loop through j correctly in the nested loop. Let me structure it properly:\n\nThe bubble sort loop is:\n\n do i=1, 3  ! 3 passes for 4 elements\n\n     do j=1, 4 - i\n\n        if (l(j) > l(j+1)) then\n\n            swap them\n\n        end if\n\n     end do\n\n end do\n\nYes; so in the j loop, for each i, the inner loop runs from j=1 to 4 - i, and in each iteration, compare j and j+1.\n\nThat should correctly sort them.\n\nNow testing this logic with an example:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose a=1, b=4, c=2, d=3.\n\nThe sorted list would be 1,2,3,4.\n\nThus l(2)=2, l(3)=3 \u2192 difference 1. \n\nThe correct overlap between [1\u20134] and [2\u20133] is 3-2=1, so correct.\n\nAnother test case: What if intervals [2,5] and [3,6]. \n\na=2, b=5, c=3, d=6. \n\nThe code enters else clause, because a >= c (2 <3 is false; not entering the a <c clause). The a is not less than c, hence the else of the last case.\n\nThen the array l = (2,5,3,6). The sorted list would be (2,3,5,6). l(2)=3, l(3)=5 \u2192 difference is 2. The actual overlap between [2\u20135] and [3\u20136] is from 3 to5 \u2192 2, so correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=8, c=5, d=7.\n\nThe four elements l array is 3,8,5,7 \u2192 sorted gives 3,5,7,8 \u2192 l(3)-l(2)=7-5=2. The overlap is 5-8 vs 5\u20137 \u2192 overlap is from5 to7 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo code seems okay.\n\nEdge Cases: \n\nFirst condition example: c >b.\n\nFor example: a=1, b=2; c=3, d=4 \u2192 because c=3>2 \u2192 output 0.\n\nElse else if (a>d). Like a=5, b=6; c=1, d=2 \u2192 a=5> d=2 \u2192 output 0.\n\nIn the a <c case.\n\nLet a=0, b=5, c=2, d=3 \u2192 a <c. min(b, d)=3 \u2192 3-2=1 \u2192 output 1.\n\nIf the overlap is correct: [0-5] and [2\u20133], the overlap is 1 (from 2-3), correct.\n\nIn the else part (neither first 2 conditions met, a not <c, so a >= c).\n\nLike a=3, c=2, then a is >=c.\n\nSuppose a=3, d=4; c=2, d=4 \u2192 then intervals [3, ... and others.\n\nAs before, code computes correctly.\n\nThus the code seems to handle those cases.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nPutting together the fortran code, with the sorting in the else.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the min function.\n\nIn the else if (a <c), the code would compute min(b,d) -c. In Fortran, min(b, d) is min(b,d). \n\nThus, the code fragment:\n\nwrite (*,*) min(b, d) -c\n\nBut need to ensure that when the min is less than c, it would give negative, but the conditions should prevent that?\n\nWait in the code's condition for entering this else if (a <c), but the first condition c >b is not met, which means that c <= b. Also, the a <c condition is met. \n\nThus, in that case:\n\nEither min(b, d) will be >=c?\n\nBecause:\n\nc <=b (since c> b is false). So if d is <=b, then min(b, d) is d which could be less than c? Wait that's possible. Wait, for example, let me take:\n\na=1, c=2. d=0. So c=2, d=0 \u2192 then the second condition (a>d: 1>0 \u2192 yes? So in this case the condition would not have entered the a<c clause? Wait let me see:\n\nWait in that example:\n\n a=1 < c=2 \u2192 enters the a <c clause \u2192 but then D is 0 ?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst condition: check if c >b? Let's say 2 is compared to b ( b's value is needed).\n\nAh, I need to create a concrete example:\n\nLet a=1, b=3, c=2, d=0. \n\nWait then c is 2. Here, first condition is c (2) > b (3)? No \u2192 not. \n\nThe second condition is a (1) > d? d is 0. So yes, a> d \u2192 the second condition is entered, which prints 0, so the code would not pass to the a <c clause.\n\nWait that is right. So in such a case, the code's conditions would have already fired the else if (a> d) clause.\n\nWait, so the code has the evaluations in order, so first, it checks if c > b \u2192 first condition. Then second condition is a> d \u2192 else if.\n\nSo the example where a=1, b=3, c=2, d=0:\n\nsince the second condition (a>d \u2192 1>0 \u2192 yes), so it will print 0.\n\nThus the case where D is less than C but a< c is only allowed if the first two conditions are not met.\n\nWait in the a <c clause, the first two conditions must have been false:\n\nFirst condition: c >b is false (so c <=b).\n\nSecond condition: a >d is false \u2192 a <=d.\n\nSo for example:\n\na=0, d=3 \u2192 a \u2264d.\n\nThen, in the a <c case, the code proceeds to compute:\n\nthe minimum between b (whatever) and d.\n\nSuppose b= 5; d=4 \u2192 min(5,4)=4. Since c is, for example, 2, so 4 -2 = 2. That is correct. \n\nBut what if b is 1 and d is 2, c is 2.\n\nWait:\n\nSuppose a=0 < c=2. \n\nCheck first condition: c > b? b is 1, c=2 \u2192 c>1: yes \u2192 then first condition is true, so first case prints 0.\n\nThus, such a case would not reach the a <c block.\n\nThus, the code is safe, since the conditions are in order, and only enters the a <c clause if the first two conditions are not met, and c <=b and a <=d.\n\nTherefore, the min(b, d) would have at least the value of c is?\n\nWait, since in the a <c case, first condition is c <=b, so min(b,d) can be:\n\nb is >=c, but if d is smaller than c, then min is d. But then, if d could be smaller than c.\n\nWait if d < c, then min(b,d ) would be d, and since a <c but d could be less than c.\n\nWait, e.g.:\n\na=1 <c=5.\n\nb = 6. So first condition c(5) >b (6) \u2192 no, condition passes.\n\nSecond condition a> d? let d=3.\n\nThus, a=1 >d=3 \u2192 no, so proceed.\n\nSo, a=1 <c=5 \u2192 enters the third condition. \n\nThen, d is 3 < 5, so min(b=6, d=3) \u21923. \n\nThen the calculation is 3 - c (5) \u2192 negative (3-5 =-2 \u2192 but in that case, that would mean negative, but what does it mean?\n\nThe overlapping interval starts at c (5) and ends at min(b=6, d=3)=3 \u2192 but the end is before the start, so the overlap is negative \u2192 meaning zero? \n\nWait that would be a bug.\n\nWait but according to the code written, in that case, the code would print -2, but that's impossible.\n\nAh, that shows a problem. Wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait in the example: a=1 < c=5, and d=3.\n\nThen the interval [a, b] is [1,6], and [c, d] is [5, 3], which is invalid since d is less than c. Or does the code assume that d\u2265c?\n\nWait the problem's input must have d \u2265c? \n\nThe code doesn't check that. But perhaps in the problem the inputs are intervals with c <=d?\n\nYes. Looking at the problem's name (AtCoder problem ABC070 B), which is called \"Over The Time Again\" probably about intervals.\n\nAssuming that the inputs c and d are given in order where c <=d, and similarly a<=b, then the code will handle correctly.\n\nThe problem probably enforces the input such that a<=b and c<=d, which the code does not check.\n\nThus, the code can have negative outputs in cases where d <c. \n\nIn the problem, perhaps such cases are excluded due to problem constraints, but in the code, the conditions may not take that into account. \n\nThus, in the code provided, it's assumed that the first condition's c> b is to check whether the interval's starting point is after the ending of the other, and in code's conditions, but the else if (a <c) case may have min( b, d) where d can be less than c, but that's only possible if the first condition (c> b) is not met.\n\nWait no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose c> d \u2192 then the interval [c, d] is invalid as it's start>c's end? Or perhaps not. \n\nAssuming that in the problem statement, the intervals are given with a \u2264b and c \u2264d. So the inputs are valid intervals with start \u2264 ends.\n\nThus, the code can be correct.\n\nThus, when handling the a <c case:\n\nsince c <=b, so the start of overlap is at c.\n\nThe end is min(b, d). Because c <=b, so min(b,d) is at least c? Not necessarily.\n\nSuppose d is less than c, but the first condition (c> b) is not true, but c> d \u2192 thus d <c \u2264b.\n\nThen, min(b, d) \u2192 d. which is less than c, so c(start point) is greater than end \u2192 overlap is negative.\n\nThus the code would output negative number. But according to problem, since the points may have overlapping or not, the code's correct approach should not print negative numbers, but zero?\n\nAh, so I think there is a bug in the Java code's logic here.\n\nWait, but in the Java code's else if (a <c) case:\n\nthe condition to enter here is first two conditions weren't met:\n\nfirst condition (c> b) is not true \u2192 so c \u2264b.\n\nsecond condition (a> d) is also not true. \u2192 a \u2264d.\n\nif the rest of the conditions are met:\n\nthen, the code prints min(b,d) - c.\n\nBut in the case where the minimum is below c:\n\nfor example, min(b,d) is less than c \u2192 so min(b,d) -c is negative \u2192 thus the output would be negative, which would indicate negative length \u2192 but overlap can't be negative \u2192 so should be zero. \n\nThus the code is incorrect here?\n\nTherefore, perhaps the code should compute max(0, min(b,d)-c). \n\nBut given that the problem's given as a correct solution, perhaps the conditions have been set up so that this doesn't happen. \n\nLooking back to the code's conditions:\n\nthe conditions are:\n\n- If the first condition (c> b \u2192 then the intervals don't overlap. Thus output is zero.\n\nElse if (a> d \u2192 similarly no overlap).\n\nElse if (a <c \u2192 then the overlap starts at c, and ends as min(b,d).\n\nIf that min is >= c \u2192 then positive.\n\nThe case where min(b,d) < c would would be when min(b,d) is less than c.\n\nBut that would require that both b and d are less than c \u2192 but since %c <=b (since the first condition is not met (c> b is false \u2192 c \u2264b). Thus, if BOTH b and d are <c \u2192 then min(b,d) is the smaller of the two which is also less than c.\n\nBut if c \u2264 B:\n\nThen, min(b,d) <c would require that d is less than c, and also since, in this case,  the second condition (a >d) must have been false \u2192 since we entered the else if.\n\nSo for a< c?\n\nWait in this scenario, let's see:\n\nif input a < c\n\nthen, to even get into the a <c clause:\n\nthe first condition (c> b must have been false \u2192 c <=b.\n\nthe second condition (a>d) must have been false \u2192a<=d.\n\nThe case if min(b,d) is the min between b (c \u2264b) and d. If d is less than c and less than b, then min is d. But a <=d implies a can be any \u2264d, but since d <c, then a must also be <c? Well, in this scenario, the a <c is met since a <c. \n\nBut in that scenario, the start of overlap would be c, but min(b,d) is d <c \u2192 thus gap is negative \u2192 so overlap is negative \u2192 but in reality overlap would be zero. So the code would incorrectly output a negative number?\n\nBut why would such an input be allowed?\n\nBecause if d < c:\n\nThe interval [c, d] is invalid? Unless the problem allows d <c \u2192 but probably not. \n\nThe Problem's constraints likely require that a \u2264 b and c \u2264d \u2192 so that d cannot be less than c. Thus in that case, the second term is d \u2265c, so the calculation min(b, d) will be min(b,d), but since c <=b, and c \u2264d, then:\n\nthe min between b and d could be between c and some.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nSince the first condition is not met (c >b \u2192 false \u2192 so c \u2264b.\n\nThe d is >=c, so min(b, d) \u2192 the min between b and a d which is >=c. So:\n\nIf d <=b \u2192 then min is d.\n\nSince d is >=c \u2192 then d - c is non-negative (since d >=c). \n\nif d is> b \u2192 then min is b \u2192 which is >=c (since c <=b). \n\nThus in this case, min(b, d) is at least c, so the a <c condition's calculation gives a non-negative result.\n\nThus, in the problem's constraints, this code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nNow in the Fortran coding, the code can proceed as written.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose a=3, b=6.\n\nc=3, d=5 \u2192 intervals [3-6], [3-5]\n\nThe code path:\n\nfirst condition: c=3 <=b=6 \u2192 ok.\n\nsecond condition a=3 not >d=5 \u2192 so proceed.\n\nElse if a (3) < c (3?) No, a=3 equal to C \u2192 so no.\n\nThus the else clause.\n\nSo the list is [3,6,3,5]. sorted is 3,3,5,6 \u2192 l(2)=3, l(3)=5 \u2192 difference is 2 (5-3). which is correct overlap is from 3-5: 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother example. a=5, b=8; c=5, d=7. Thus intervals [5-8], [5-7]. The sorted list of the four values is 5,5,7,8 \u2192 difference between l(3) and l(2) is 2 (7-5) \u2192 correct.\n\nThus the code works.\n\nThus, the Fortran code as I outlined should work.\n\nNow, coding this in Fortran correctly.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code would be like this:"
