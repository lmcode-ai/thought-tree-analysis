    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's start by looking at the Java code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java program is a class with a main method. The purpose seems to be finding the next prime number after x if x is even and not 2. Wait, let me read the code again. The code first reads x. Then, if x isn't 2 and is even, it increments x by 1, making it odd. Then there's a loop where it checks if x is prime.\n\nThe algorithm is: start with x (if it's even and not 2, start at next odd). Then check if it's a prime. If not, add 2 and check again. The loop continues until a prime is found, then it prints x.\n\nNow translating this to Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran doesn't have classes, so it will be a program with a main block. The input can be read using a standard read statement.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read integer x from input.\n\nIn Java, it's using Scanner. In Fortran, probably:\n\nread *, x\n\nBut need to declare variables. Let me think: variables in Fortran need to be declared. Let's think about the variables:\n\nx is the starting number, and will be updated. \n\nAlso, the loop checks whether x is a prime. The way it does it in Java is, for the current x (starting at adjusted x), compute sqrt(x), then loop from 3 to sqrt(x) in steps of 2 (since even divisors would have been checked already?), but wait in Java code:\n\nThe code starts with i=3 up to sqrt(x), but increments by 2 each time, so checks odd divisors.\n\nWait, the initial logic: in Java, they first set x to x++ if x is even and not 2. Then they start the loop. The loop's first part: compute sqrtNum (sqrt(x)), then loop from i=3 to sqrtNum, step 2, check if i divides x. If any divisor is found, break, then check if i exceeded sqrtNum. If so, then x is prime, exit loop, else increment x by 2 (next odd) and repeat.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n- Adjust x to next odd if even (unless 2) to find next prime.\n\nNow, in Fortran:\n\nVariables needed: x, sqrtNum (but in Fortran, sqrt is a function), i, and some flags or logic to know when the loop should break. Hmm, but in the Java code, they use a for loop, and then break upon divisor found. So if the loop completes without breaking, then x is prime.\n\nIn Fortran, the structure will be different.\n\nFirst, input part. Let's start with:\n\nPROGRAM ATCODER_ABC149_C\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: x, i, is_prime\n  REAL :: sqrt_x\n\n  ! Read x from input\n  READ (*,*) x\n\n  ! Adjust x if necessary\n  if (x /= 2 .AND. MOD(x,2) == 0) then\n    x = x + 1\n  end if\n\n  ! Now enter a loop to find the next prime\n  DO\n    sqrt_x = SQRT(REAL(x))  ! Convert x to real before sqrt to avoid type issues\n    is_prime = 1  ! assume prime\n    DO i = 3, INT(sqrt_x), 2\n      IF (MOD(x,i) == 0) THEN\n        is_prime = 0\n        EXIT\n      END IF\n    END DO\n    if (is_prime == 1) EXIT\n    ! If not prime, add 2 and continue\n    x = x + 2\n  END DO\n\n  WRITE (*,*) x\nEND PROGRAM ATCODER_ABC149_C\n\nWait, but in the Java version, the loop is \"while (true)\", and the conditions inside to break. Let me see the difference:\n\nJava's loop structure:\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n   ... calculate sqrtNum ...\n\n   for (i from 3 to ...) check divisors.\n\n   if (i > sqrtNum) break; \n\n   else x +=2;\n\n}\n\nWait, let's think in Java:\n\nAfter the for loop, if the loop broke out because the for loop finished (i reached beyond sqrt), meaning no divisor found, then i would be sqrtNum + 2 if the loop ended normally? Not exactly. Let's see: in Java, 'for (i=3 ...; i<=sqrtNum; i+=2)' when it exhausted the loop, then i would exit when i>sqrtNum, so after the loop, i is either sqrtNum+2, but not sure. The Java code checks whether i > sqrtNum, so if after the for loop, the loop didn't break early, the i would have gone beyond sqrtNum.\n\nWait in Java's code:\n\nInside the while loop:\n\nthey have a for loop, and if during the for loop, x mod i is 0, then break. Then after the for loop, check if i > sqrt_num (the sqrt value). If yes, then break (exit the outer loop, so the current x is prime). Otherwise, add 2 and loop again.\n\nHmm, so in Fortran, how to replicate that? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Java code's logic is:\n\nCheck x: for each candidate (starting at adjusted x), check divisibility up to sqrt(x). If the loop finishes without finding a divisor, then it's prime.\n\nIn Java's code, the logic is: after the for loop, if the for loop completed normally, then i would be the next after sqrtNum (since for loop runs until i<=sqrtNum). But since the for loop step is 2, after the loop, i would be sqrtNum +2 ?\n\nWait, let's consider for example x= current candidate.\n\nSuppose the sqrt is 5 (so i increments up to 5, in steps of 2, starting at 3). The steps are 3,5. Then when i exceeds sqrt_x (after 5, loop ends, so i is 7). Wait no, in for loop:\n\nInitialization: i=3, then check if i<= sqrtNum each time.\n\nTake sqrt as 5 (say x is 25, sqrt is 5). The for loop runs from 3 to 5 (3, then 5). Then after increment i +=2, i becomes 7, which is beyond 5, so loop exits, but the loop variable is 7.\n\nIn the code, after the for loop the code checks: if (i>sqrtNum) then break.\n\nBecause if it did, then it means the for loop completed without breaking, so no divisor found. So if the for loop found a divisor, it breaks and the i would be at the current divisor, which is <= sqrt(x), so i would not be greater than sqrt.\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the equivalent logic would be: after the for loop (the inner loop over i), if the loop terminated normally (didn't break early) then x is prime.\n\nBut in Fortran, the inner loop (over i) can't exit early like a break; you can use a goto or an exit statement. Alternatively, a flag variable to track if it found a divisor.\n\nAlternatively, let's look back:\n\nIn Java, the inner loop's 'break' only exits the for loop. After that, the code has if (i > sqrtNum) break (to exit the outer loop? Wait no, the outer loop is a while (true).\n\nWait the code after for loop:\n\nif (i > sqrtNum) break; \nthen the outer loop breaks, so x is considered as prime.\n\nOtherwise, increment x and loop again.\n\nWait the Java code is structured as:\n\nInside the infinite while (true) loop:\n\nloop ends if after testing x, its factors aren't found.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nThe outer loop is forever.\n\nThen after the for loop, if (i > sqrtNum) \u2192 then we can break the outer loop.\n\nElse, we add 2 to x and start over.\n\nSo the condition to break out of the outer loop is that the for loop completed without any break.\n\nHmm.\n\nTherefore, in FORTRAN, perhaps the approach is:\n\nInstead of a flag variable, perhaps increment x until the condition is met.\n\nAlternatively, in the inner loop, can set a flag to indicate primality. Let me think:\n\nUsing flag variables would make it clearer. The flag is 1 (true) until a divisor is found.\n\nWait here's how to structure it in Fortran:\n\nIn the outer loop:\n\n   inner loop: check all i from 3 to sqrt_x.\n\n   if any i divides x, then it's not prime \u2192 set flag to 0 and break inner loop.\n\n   after inner loop, check the flag.\n\n   if flag is 1 \u2192 exit outer loop.\n\n   else, x +=2 and repeat.\n\nSo here's code:\n\nInside main program loop:\n\n   flag = 1\n\n   sqrt_x = sqrt(x)\n\n   DO i=3, int(sqrt_x), 2\n\n      if (mod(x,i)==0) then\n\n          flag=0\n\n          exit   ! exit the do loop over i\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   if (flag ==1) exit outer loop\n\n   else \u2192 increment x by 2\n\nSo the outer loop could be a do while.\n\nAlternatively, the outer loop is a loop with 'do while ( .true. ) ... end do'\n\nBut in Fortran, loop constructs can be a bit limited compared to Java's break.\n\nHmm, let me try writing this with flags.\n\nSo constructing the code:\n\nThe main loop is infinite until x is found as prime.\n\nStarting after adjusting x.\n\nThen:\n\n outer_loop: DO\n\n    flag = 1\n\n    sqrt_x = SQRT(REAL(x))\n\n    DO i = 3, INT(sqrt_x), 2\n\n       if ( MOD(x, i) == 0 ) then\n\n          flag = 0\n\n          exit   ! breaks out of the inner loop\n\n       end if\n\n    END DO\n\n    ! now check flag\n\n    if (flag ==1) then\n\n      exit outer_loop\n\n    else\n\n      x = x + 2\n\n    end if\n\n END DO outer_loop\n\nThen proceed to print x.\n\nHmm, that would work. The 'exit outer_loop' allows exiting from the outer loop (the outer do).\n\nIn Fortran, you can label loops and then exit to the label. The outer loop is labeled as outer_loop, so exit outer_loop will exit from there.\n\nSo putting this into code.\n\nLet me also note variable declarations:\n\nvariables:\n\nx: integer input.\n\nThen in outer loop, flag is an integer (or logical?), but since it's 1 or 0, integer is okay.\n\nsqrt_x would be a real variable, because sqrt of integer x may not be integer, so using real to hold the square root.\n\nNow, steps in code:\n\n- Read x.\n\n- adjust to odd if even (except 2).\n\n- enter outer loop.\n\nWait code outline:\n\nPROGRAM atcoder_ABC149_C\n  IMPLICIT NONE\n  INTEGER :: x, i, flag\n  REAL :: sqrt_x\n\n  ! Read input\n  READ(*, *) x\n\n  ! adjust x if necessary\n  IF (x /= 2 .AND. MOD(x,2) ==0) THEN\n     x = x +1\n  END IF\n\n  outer_loop: DO\n     flag =1\n     sqrt_x = SQRT(REAL(x))\n     DO i =3, INT(sqrt_x), 2\n        IF (MOD(x,i) ==0) THEN\n           flag =0\n           EXIT\n        END IF\n     END DO\n     IF (flag ==1) THEN\n        EXIT outer_loop\n     ELSE\n        x =x +2\n     END IF\n  END DO outer_loop\n\n  ! output x\n  WRITE(*,*) x\n\nEND PROGRAM atcoder_ABC149_C\n\nThis looks like it should work. Let's check edge cases.\n\nWait when x is 2, which is prime. So if input x is 2, since x is not even (since the condition is (x !=2 and mod2==0), so the adjustment is skipped. Then, enter outer loop:\n\nx remains 2. Now, sqrt_x is sqrt(2) ~1.414, so INT(sqrt_x) is 1. The loop DO i=3,...,1,... which won't execute. The loop over i doesn't run. So flag remains 1. So then, yes, exit loop and print 2. That's correct.\n\nAnother test case: input x is 3. Which is prime. After adjustment (since it's odd), so x remains 3.\n\nloop over i from 3 to (sqrt(3)~1.73). So the loop's upper limit is 1. Again, doesn't run. flag is1 \u2192 exits and returns 3. Correct.\n\nTest for x=4, which is even and not 2 \u2192 adjustment sets x=5. Then check 5.\n\nsqrt(5) ~2.236 \u2192 int is 2. loop i from 3 to 2? So no iterations, so flag=1. So returns 5, correct.\n\nAnother example: x = 6 \u2192 adjusted to 7 (since 6 is even and not 2 \u2192 x becomes 7).\n\nCheck if 7 is prime: sqrt(7) ~2.645 \u2192 int sqrt_x is 2 \u2192 the DO i=3 to 2 is skipped. So it is prime. So output is 7.\n\nIf suppose x=9 \u2192 the adjusted x (since 9 is odd, no adjustment. So start with x=9.\n\nTesting 9: sqrt is ~3.0 \u2192 so the loop runs from 3 up to 3.\n\nSo check i=3: 9 mod3 is 0 \u2192 flag set to 0. Then flag is not 1 \u2192 so x +=2 \u2192 x=11.\n\nNow check x=11: sqrt is ~3.316 \u2192 int is 3. So loop from 3 to 3 \u2192 i=3 \u2192 11 mod3 is 2 \u2192 so no. So flag remains 1 \u2192 exits. So returns 11. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input x=15, which is adjusted to 15 (since it's odd). 15 is checked:\n\nsqrt(15)=~3.872 \u2192 int(3.872)=3. loop runs i from 3 to 3 \u2192 test i=3 \u2192 15 mod3 is zero \u2192 flag is 0. So x becomes 17.\n\nCheck 17: sqrt(17) ~4.123 \u2192 int(4). So i loops from 3 to 4, but step is 2 \u2192 next i is 3,5? No, step 2 \u2192 3 then 5?\n\nWait the loop is i from 3 to 4, stepping by 2.\n\nWait, in this case, the step is 2. So starting at i=3: the next would be 5, which is beyond 4, so only i=3 is considered. 17 mod3 is 2 \u2192 so no division. So the loop ends without finding a divisor. So flag is 1 \u2192 exit and output 17.\n\nYes.\n\nHmm, the code should work.\n\nWait but in the code, when calculating sqrt_x, the original x is integer, converting to real first so that the sqrt is accurate. Because SQRT(15) as an integer might give zero? No, in Fortran functions, if you do SQRT(integer), the function can handle it, but perhaps better to cast to REAL(x).\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAnother point: in the inner loop, is the step correct?\n\nYes: from 3 up to sqrt_x, stepping by 2. So we test all the odd numbers dividing x (since even divisors would have been eliminated if x is odd).\n\nWait x is being incremented by 2 each time, so after adjustment, all x's considered are odd. Thus, checking divisors starting at 3, stepping by 2 ensures we check only odd divisors, which is correct.\n\nTherefore this code should work.\n\nOther possible points:\n\n- Are negative x inputs handled? The problem states x is input, but since primes are >1, maybe the code expects x >=2, but in the problem, probably.\n\nBut since the code is for a specific problem (AtCoder ABC149 C?), the input is probably ensured to be a positive integer.\n\nThe code should handle that case. For example, x=1? Well, it would be adjusted to x=2 (since 1 !=2 and mod(1,2) is 1. So x remains 1.\n\nSo proceed to loop:\n\nCheck x=1: sqrt_x is sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 the inner loop i starts at 3 which is >1, so no iterations. The code will then set flag=1 \u2192 exit and output 1. But 1 is not a prime. Oops, so here is an issue!\n\nAh, right. The code must account for the case when x is 2, but if x starts as 1.\n\nWait, the problem says the code expects x as input, but in AtCoder problem ABC149 C, probably x is a positive integer and the required condition is to find the smallest prime >=x, but only considering that if x is not 2 and is even, starting with next odd.\n\nWait let's see the original Java code:\n\nThe code sets x to x++ only when x is even and not 2. So for x=1 (odd), so no change. Then, the code checks if it is a prime.\n\nBut 1 is not a prime, so the code would proceed.\n\nThe code's logic for x=1 would be:\n\nsqrt_x is 1 \u2192 in the inner loop, i starts at 3 (so upper limit is 1 which is less than 3 \u2192 loop doesn't run. Thus, flag remains 1 (since it wasn't set to 0). Thus, it exits and returns x=1 as prime, which is wrong.\n\nHence, this is a problem.\n\nAh, here the code has a bug. The same applies in the original Java code.\n\nWait let me check the Java code.\n\nOriginal Java code:\n\nif the input is 1.\n\nThen, input x=1 is odd. So the code doesn't do x++.\n\nThen, enters the next loop (the infinite while loop):\n\nInside, compute sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 loop over i from 3 to 1, which doesn't run. the i variable would be set to 3 (since initial i is 3 and not exceeds sqrt(1)=1) \u2192 then after loop, i is 3, sqrt(1) is 1.\n\nSo checking i > sqrtNum \u2192 3>1 \u2192 yes, break the outer loop. So outputs 1, which is not a prime. So the original Java code has a bug.\n\nTherefore, there's a problem in the original code for x values less than 2.\n\nThe problem requires handling x=1?\n\nLooking at the problem ABC149 C: the problem says \"your program should print the smallest prime not less than X\".\n\nIf the problem is as stated, then when X=1, the answer should be 2.\n\nHmm, so the Java code's logic is flawed because it treats 1 as a prime. \n\nWait what's the actual problem? Let me check.\n\nThe original problem for ABC149 C ( probably \"Prime Swapping\") is different.\n\nWait maybe I should check the problem statement. Since I can't actually do that, perhaps I should just note that the original code's logic is not handling x less than 2, but the code may have been written under assumed constraints (like X >= 2).\n\nAssuming that in the original problem, the input X is at least 2. But if the code must handle X=1, then there's a bug.\n\nIn any case, since the question is to translate the given Java code into Fortran, not to fix the logic. So the Fortran code will have the same problems as the Java code.\n\nThus, our Fortran code should mirror the Java code exactly, including its flaws.\n\nHence, we proceed with the code as above.\n\nAnother possible point: The code uses a real function, sqrt_x.\n\nWe have to compute sqrt of x, then cast it to integer. Because in Fortran, when you use i up to sqrt_x's integer value, it works.\n\nWait in the inner loop, the upper bound is INT(sqrt_x).\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the DO loop's upper bound must be an integer. So that works.\n\nWait, also, the loop 'do i=3, INT(sqrt_x), 2'.\n\nAnother edge case: x=3.\n\nsqrt_x=1.732 \u2192 INT is 1. So upper limit is 1. The loop runs from 3 to 1, which does not execute. Thus, flag remains 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nx=2, which is correctly handled.\n\nAnother case x=4 \u2192 becomes x=5, which is prime \u2192 correct.\n\nx=5 is prime \u2192 works.\n\nOkay. Thus, I think this translation should be accurate to the original Java code."
