Alternatively, perhaps character assignments in Fortran are actual strings, and when you set h = 'NO', it becomes 'NO' followed by a single blank, making it three characters.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me see what the Java code does first. \n\nThe Java code reads three integers from the input line split by spaces. Then it checks two conditions: first, if any of the three numbers is 5 or 7. Second, if the sum of all three numbers equals 17. If both conditions are met, it outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nHmm, Fortran's input handling is a bit different. In Java, they use BufferedReader, but in Fortran, I can read from the standard input using a read statement. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to declare variables. The Java variables x, a, y are integers. The result is stored in h, which is a string. In Fortran, character types have to specify length, so maybe h is character(len=3) since \"YES\" and \"NO\" are 3 and 3 characters? Wait, \"YES\" is 3, \"NO\" is 2. Oh right, in Fortran, when using fixed-length strings, we need to make sure the length is sufficient. Let's set it to 3 characters to accommodate both cases. Or perhaps 4 just in case, but looking at the Java code, it's either \"NO\" or \"YES\". So 3 is enough.\n\nWait, in the code, the initial value of h is \"NO\", so that's two characters, but \"YES\" is three. So to store \"YES\", the length has to be at least 3. Therefore, h should be declared as character(len=3). The initial value will be \"NO\", but in Fortran, maybe we need to fill the rest with spaces? Or does Fortran allow it as long as it's at least as long as the string? Let me recall. Fortran 90 and later allows character assignments to adjust, but best to set the length correctly. So declare as character(len=3) :: h.\n\nNow, the input. In Fortran, reading input via command line would be using the read(5,*) statement, but wait, standard input in Fortran is usually unit 5? Wait, maybe unit 5 is for input files, but sometimes people use 5 for input. But in practice, for reading from stdin, I think you use the * unit. Wait, no. Wait, in Fortran, the syntax is to use unit numbers. The default input unit is 5, but sometimes it's 5, sometimes 5 is assumed. Alternatively, using the * for formatted input. Wait, perhaps better to just read using read(*,*) and that should pick up from stdin.\n\nWait, I should check: In the code, in Fortran, to read three integers, the code would be something like:\n\nread *, x, a, y\n\nBut the input might come in as a line split by spaces, which this should handle. So the variables will be read in order. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNext, the conditions. The first condition is checking if any of x, a, or y is 5 or 7. So in Fortran logic, that's an OR between (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a==7) .or. (y ==5 .or. y==7)? \n\nYes, in Fortran, the logical operators are .AND., .OR., and the comparisons are done with .eq. or ==. Wait in Fortran 90, you can use \"==\", right? Or maybe it's better to use .eq. for clarity? Actually, in modern Fortran, both == and .eq. are allowed for equality, but .eq. might be better for consistency. \n\nSo the first condition:\n\nif ( (x .eq. 5 .or. x .eq.7) .or. (a .eq.5 .or. a .eq.7 ) .or. (y .eq.5 .or. y .eq.7 )) then\n\nThen the inner condition is whether x + y + a equals 17. So:\n\nif ( (x + a + y) == 17 .or. (x + a + y) ==17 )? Wait in Fortran, the arithmetic would be straightforward. The sum x + a + y should equal 17, so the condition is (x +a + y) .eq. 17.\n\nWait, combining conditions. The original Java code has two if statements. The outer \"if either of the variables is 5 or7\", then it checks if the sum is 17. Only if both conditions are true does it set h to \"YES\".\n\nWait, the Java code's structure is:\n\nif (condition1) { \n\n    if (sum ==17) {h = yes}\n\n}\n\nso the else parts remain as h=\"NO\"\n\nTherefore, in Fortran, the logic is that first check condition1, then within that, check condition2, and if both are true, then set h to \"YES\". Otherwise, h remains \"NO\". So the Fortran code can use an if-then block where the first condition is condition1, and the second condition is the sum check, and then set h accordingly.\n\nWait, also, in the Java code, the code does this:\n\nif (any is 5/7) then:\n\n   if (sum is 17):\n\n       h = \"YES\"\n\n   else, not changing. \n\nElse, not changing.\n\nSo in Fortran, the same structure.\n\nThe variables:\n\nprogram name would be something like AtCoder_ABC042_A, but programs in Fortran can have names? Or just the code block. Since you can't have a class in Fortran like Java, the main program is a program block. So:\n\nProgram atcoder_ABC042_A\n\nBut the name is up to me. Probably the code can be written as a program.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nVariables: x, a, y as integers.\n\nCharacter h (len=3) initialized to 'NO'.\n\nFirst check whether any of x, a, y is 5 or7. If so, check if sum is 17.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none !declare variables explicitly\n\ninteger :: x, a, y\n\ncharacter(len=3) :: h = 'NO'\n\n! read input\n\nread *, x, a, y\n\n! check first condition\n\nif ( (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a==7) .or. (y ==5 .or.y ==7) ) then\n\n    if (x + a + y == 17) then\n\n        h = 'YES'\n\n    end if\n\nend if\n\nprint *, h\n\nend program main\n\nWait, but I need to check the parentheses correctly. The first condition's OR operations must correctly cover all three variables.\n\nLet me see, the expression in the first if:\n\nEither x is 5 or7, or a is 5 or7, or y is 5 or7. To construct that in Fortran, each of the variables is tested as (variable .eq.5 or variable .eq.7), so:\n\nSo the first condition is:\n\n( (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a ==7) .or. (y ==5 .or. y ==7) )\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen, the second part is sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way to write the comparison in Fortran is with .eq., so maybe using x == 5 is okay, but some might prefer .eq. for consistency. But both are valid in Fortran 90+.\n\nTesting the code: Let me think of some test cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 5 6 6 \u2192 Sum is 17? 5+6+6 =17? 17 yes. So the conditions:\n\nsince 5 is present, and sum is 17 \u2192 output YES.\n\nTest case 2: 3 4 10 \u2192 sum 17, but none are 5 or7: so output no.\n\nAnother test case 7 7 3: sum 17 (7+7+3=17), then since 7 is present \u2192 yes.\n\nWait 7 +7+3=17 yes.\n\nWait another case: 5, 5,7. sum is 17? 5+5=10+7 is 17 \u2192 yes. So that's yes.\n\nIf any of the numbers is 5 or7 and sum is 17 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait the original java code uses | which in java is bitwise or, but in an if condition, it acts as logical OR. Wait, let me check the original code's condition again:\n\nOriginal Java code's condition:\n\nif (x ==5 | x ==7 | a ==5 | a ==7 | y ==5 | y ==7) {\n\nWait hold on! Wait in Java, | is a bitwise OR, not a logical OR. The logical OR is ||. But this code uses |, so that might be an error. Wait, but in an if condition, if someone uses |, then it evaluates all three terms. But in the expression written like that, like x==5 | x==7 would be interpreted as (x==5) | x==7? But in Java, the operator precedence for | is lower than ==, so the original code's condition would be (x==5) | x ==7 | a ==5 | a ==7 | y==5 | y==7.\n\nWait actually, no. Let me check operator precedence in Java: The == has higher precedence than |. So the code:\n\nx ==5 | x ==7 \u2192 (x ==5) | (x ==7), right? Because | has lower precedence than ==. Wait | has lower priority than ==. So parentheses are correct here. So the code is grouping the terms correctly. Because without parentheses, each == is evaluated first, then | is done left to right. So in the code:\n\nx ==5 | x ==7 \u2192 same as (x ==5) | (x ==7 )\n\nSame for a terms. So the original Java code is correct, checking any of the three variables is 5 or7.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is correct as per the current structure.\n\nWait but in the Java code, the code uses x ==5 | x ==7 | a ==5 | ... which is equivalent to (x is 5 or7) or (a is5 or7) or (y is5 or7). Which is exactly what I wrote in Fortran's condition. So the code is okay.\n\nWait wait, the Fortran code has:\n\n( (x ==5 or x==7) OR (a ...) OR (y ...) ) \u2192 correct.\n\nOkay, so that's correct.\n\nNow, in the code's output, h is initialized to \"NO\". Then if both conditions are met it becomes \"YES\".\n\nThe print statement in Fortran can be done using print *, h. However, I should note that in Fortran, the output might have a trailing space if h is \"NO\", since it's length 3. Because \"NO\" is two letters, so stored as 'NO \\n' perhaps? Wait Fortran character strings are fixed-length. If h is declared as length 3, and you set h to 'NO' then the third character is a space? Let's see. When you assign 'NO' to a 3-character variable, the third character is filled with a space, so when printed, it would show as \"NO \" instead of \"NO\". Which might not be desired. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nBecause in the original code, Java outputs \"NO\" or \"YES\". The Fortran code would have to make sure that the output is exactly three characters, but \"NO\" is shorter. Wait, perhaps in the code, the initial value is 'NO', so stored as 'NO '? But when printed, it would show the space. So that's an issue. To fix this, maybe set h to 'NO' and then when setting to 'YES', it uses exactly three letters. So the output will be correct as per Java.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fortran code can set h as a character(len=3) and when printing, use an edit descriptor to write only the characters, like:\n\nprint '(A)', trim(h)\n\nWait, but if h is 'YES' then trim won't change anything. If h is 'NO ', then trim gives 'NO'. Hmm, yes! So to avoid trailing spaces when outputting \"NO\", I should use trim.\n\nModify the print statement to:\n\nprint *, trim(h)\n\nWait but in Fortran, the print *, will automatically output the trimmed string. Wait, no. In Fortran, when you print a character variable, if it has trailing blanks, it will still include them unless you use an explicit format. Wait let me think. The \"print *, ...\" uses list-directed formatting. For character variables, trailing blanks are skipped. Wait no, actually in list-directed output, I think if h is a character(len=3) variable, and is 'NO ', then printing h will output the entire 3 characters, so including the space. But trailing blanks may be omitted? According to Fortran standards, list-directed output for character data should output the value without any leading or trailing blanks, except when the value is a reference to a CHARACTER variable with sufficient space, but actually, the standard says that trailing blanks are omitted. Wait maybe I should check.\n\nWait according to Fortran standards: List-directed output for a character variable trims trailing spaces. So if h is 'NO ', the printed value will be 'NO'. Because the trailing blank is considered trailing and is omitted. So maybe it's okay. Let's test with the code:\n\nSuppose h is 'NO', then length 3 with third character a space? If the initial value is h = 'NO', then the characters are 'N','O',' ' (assuming the assignment fills with blanks). Then the print would display 'NO' because trailing space is omitted. However, the assignment in code to 'YES' will fill exactly three letters: 'YES' with no trailing space.\n\nWait yes:\n\nh = 'YES' \u2192 stored as 'YES' in three characters, so correct.\n\nh = 'NO' \u2192 stored as 'NO ' (third character a space?), but when printing, the trailing space is omitted so it prints 'NO'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps character assignments in Fortran are actual strings, and when you set h = 'NO', it becomes 'NO' followed by a single blank, making it three characters. So the output would be taken as 'NO ' but when printed via list-directed, it would omit trailing blanks and output 'NO' (without the space between O and the end). So maybe that's okay. So in that case, the print statement is fine with print *, h. The output will match the original Java code, except that maybe sometimes there's a trailing space but the problem expects 'YES' or 'NO'. Let me confirm the problem.\n\nThe problem says that the code is about the ABC042 A problem from AtCoder. Looking at the problem statement, probably the outputs must be exactly \"YES\" or \"NO\". So trailing spaces would be considered incorrect. Therefore, I must ensure that h is exactly three characters when it's \"YES\", and two, but in Fortran's string, when stored in a 3 character variable, setting h = 'NO' would result in the third character being a space. However, list-directed output trims trailing whitespace, so it would be okay. But to be safe, perhaps setting h to 'NO ' may look like 'NO ' in the output if the code is not trimming. Wait, the code may have different behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use character(len=3) :: h, then set h to 'YES' or 'NO'. However 'NO' is length 2. When you set h = 'NO', the excess characters are filled with spaces. The problem requires exactly \"NO\", so when printed, the trailing space would be omitted by the list-directed format. Therefore, it is okay. The program will produce \"NO\" or \"YES\" correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code as written should be acceptable.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, the .or. and .AND. logical operators have a certain precedence. For multiple ORs, since they are all ORs, the parentheses I added should group the terms correctly. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the Fortran if condition:\n\nif ( (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a ==7) .or. (y ==5 .or. y ==7) ) then\n\nYes, this groups each variable's own conditions first (like (x is 5 or7)), then OR those together. So that is correct. The parentheses ensure that each variable's condition is evaluated together.\n\nNow, another thing to note is integer values. In the Java code, the inputs are parsed as integers. So in Fortran, the input is read via read *, which expects integers. So as long as the input is three space-separated numbers, it should work.\n\nPutting all together, the code becomes:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc042_a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: x, a, y\n  character(len=3) :: h = \"NO\"\n\n  read *, x, a, y\n\n  if ( (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a ==7) .or. (y ==5 .or. y ==7) ) then\n      if (x + a + y == 17) then\n          h = \"YES\"\n      end if\n  end if\n\n  print *, trim(h)\n\nend program atcoder_abc042_a\n\nWait wait, adding trim might not be necessary, but as I thought earlier, but to be safe, perhaps use trim. Wait in the case when h is 'NO' \u2192 trim(h) would be 'NO', which is correct. When h is 'YES' it is 'YES' no change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nprint '(A)', h(1:LEN_TRIM(h))\n\nbut no, since for \"YES\", it's already three characters. Hmm. Alternatively, since the problem requires outputting exactly \"YES\" or \"NO\", either case is okay. Wait we can just use:\n\nprint '(A3)', h\n\nWait if h is \"NO\" it would be 'NO  ' but that would add spaces. So no. Maybe better to use list directed output and rely on it trimming. Alternatively using an edit descriptor. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is to print using:\n\nwrite (*, '(A)') h\n\nWhich will print exactly the value without trailing blanks.\n\nWait, using this instead of print * may be better.\n\nSo here's the revised code:\n\nChange the print statement to:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') h\n\nThat way, the output is as stored, but Fortran's WRITE with (A) will trim trailing blanks. Wait no, the format (A) with no length specified, it will write the entire stored value. Let me check.\n\nWait in the specification, the format '(A)' denotes a variable-length character, which would output the entire stored string, including any trailing spaces. So that's bad. To actually print the string without trailing spaces, we can use '(A)' but with trim:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') trim(h)\n\nBecause whether h has a trailing space or not, trim(h) removes trailing blanks. However, in cases where h is \"YES\" (stored as three characters, no trailing space, so trim does nothing. If h is \"NO \" \u2192 trim becomes \"NO\".\n\nTherefore, that's better.\n\nSo the code should use:\n\nwrite(*,'(A)') trim(h)\n\nBut in list-directed output (the *), the print *, h may do the same. Alternatively, let me confirm with the code.\n\nAlternatively, in list-directed output, when printing a character variable, the trailing blanks are omitted. So when h has 'NO ', the print *, h would output 'NO'. So maybe the original is okay.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps use trim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assignment could be:\n\nh = \"NO\" \u2192 stored as two characters, but in a 3-character variable, so 'NO' followed by blank. However when you set h='YES' it's stored as three letters with no space.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure that when setting h=\"NO\", exactly two characters are stored? Not possible in Fortran, since the declared length has to be known. The alternative is to set the variable as a scalar string, but in Fortran 90, you can have varying length strings with the kind parameter, but older standards might not. But assuming Fortran90 and newer:\n\nWait, alternatively, the initial value can be set as h = \"NO\" in a 3 character variable, then when set to \"YES\", it's three characters.\n\nAnyway, the code should be correct with the \"trim\" in the print statement to avoid any trailing space.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc042_a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: x, a, y\n  character(len=3) :: h = \"NO\"\n\n  read *, x, a, y\n\n  if ( (x ==5 .or. x ==7) .or. (a ==5 .or. a ==7) .or. (y ==5 .or. y ==7) ) then\n    if (x + a + y == 17) then\n        h = \"YES\"\n    end if\n  end if\n\n  print *, trim(h)\n\nend program atcoder_abc042_a\n\nAlternatively, using explicit write statement with trim.\n\nTesting:\n\nCase 1: 5 6 6 \u2192 sum 17, with 5 being present \u2192 output YES.\n\nIn code:\n\nh becomes YES \u2192 trim(h) \u2192 YES.\n\nCase 2: 3 4 10 \u2192 sum 17, but no numbers are 5/7 \u2192 remains NO \u2192 correct.\n\nCase 3: 7 7 3 \u2192 17 and 7 present \u2192 YES.\n\nCase 4: 0 0 17 \u2192 sum 17 but none are 5/7 \u2192 NO.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 7 \u2192 sum is 17? 5+5+7 = 17 \u2192 yes, so output is YES.\n\nAll should work.\n\nAnother possible edge case: 5 7 5. Sum is 17. Check: 5+7+5 = 17 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus the code seems correct."
