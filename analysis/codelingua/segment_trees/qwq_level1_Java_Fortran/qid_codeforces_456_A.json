    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code to Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code is doing. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then for each of n pairs of integers (a[i] and b[i]), it does some checks and sets flags. At the end, it prints \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\" depending on whether the flag f is true or false.\n\nLet me look at the variables. The code has an ArrayList called md but it's not used anywhere, so maybe that's a mistake? Oh well, in the translation, I can ignore that since it's not being used in the main logic.\n\nThe main variables are a and b arrays, temp, q, w, e, and a boolean f. \n\nNow, translating the loops and logic. The code uses a for loop from i=0 to n-1 in Java. Since Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, I might need to adjust that. Let me see, but perhaps I can use 0-based arrays in Fortran by using 'dimension' with 0.\n\nWait, in Fortran, arrays are declared with a dimension. Maybe I can use the Fortran 95 standard where arrays are allocatable. But the Java code uses int[n], which would translate to an array of size n. Let me see.\n\nThe first step: declaring the variables. Let's see:\n\n- The Scanner is for input in Java. In Fortran, we can read from stdin using read(*,*) statements. So I can use that.\n\nVariables:\n\nint n: in Fortran, n would be an integer. Declare as integer :: n.\n\nint a[n]: same for b[n]. But in Fortran, arrays are fixed size or we can allocate them. Since n is input first, maybe better to read n then allocate the arrays.\n\nWait, in Fortran, you can have allocatable arrays. So maybe:\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n\nThen after reading n:\n\nallocate(a(n), b(n))\n\nThat's better because the size is known at runtime.\n\nThe variables temp, q, w, e are integers. Easy enough, declare those. The boolean f becomes a logical variable.\n\nNext, the loop in the Java code is over i from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, naturally, array indices start at 1 unless specified. Wait, no, unless we use the lbound and ubound. Alternatively, in the declaration, when using allocatable, the default lower bound is 1.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you allocate a(n), the array will have indices from 1 to n. But in the code, the Java array starts at 0. Hmm. Wait no, in the Java code, the Java array is [n], so indices from 0 to n-1, but the loop is from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, to mirror that, maybe it's easier to make the arrays 1-based but loop from 1 to n. But the logic should be okay as long as the indices are handled correctly. Alternatively, set the lower bound to 0 explicitly.\n\nLet me think: In Fortran, you can specify the array's starting indices. So perhaps:\n\ninteger, dimension(0:n-1) :: a, b\n\nBut you can only do that when the size is known at compile time, but here n is input, so that might not work. Therefore maybe it's better to use 1-based arrays, and adjust the loop indices accordingly. The code logic in the loops will need to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem variables don't depend on the array indices, so changing 0 to start at 1 wouldn't affect the calculations.\n\nLooking at the Java code, the loops process each element no matter the index, so as long as we loop correctly over all the elements, it should be okay.\n\nSo I'll proceed with 1-based arrays in Fortran, and adjust the loop to start at 1.\n\nLet me go through the code step by step:\n\nFirst, read n from input. Then read n pairs of a[i] and b[i]. \n\nThe first loop does something with temp, q, etc.\n\nNow, let me look at the Java code's loops:\n\nThe Java for loop is for(int i=0; i < n; i++) {\n\nIn our Fortran code, we will loop from 1 to n:\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\nThen, in Java code inside the loop:\n\na[i] = in.nextInt();\n\nBut in Fortran arrays are 1 based. So the same.\n\nThe next variables:\n\ntemp starts at 0, q is also initialized to 0, w=0, e=0 (but these are outside the loop). Wait, variables q, w, e are declared outside the loop in Java. Wait, in Java, variables like temp, q, w, e are all in the method, declared before the loop.\n\nWait, Java's for loop variables are in the loop, but the others are declared in the method's scope.\n\nSo in the Fortran code:\n\nThese variables are declared as:\n\ninteger :: temp, q, w, e\n\nlogical :: f\n\nInitially, temp is 0, q is 0, etc.\n\nWait in the Java code, the initial values of variables:\n\ntemp was initialized to 0,\n\nq is 0,\n\nw and e are 0,\n\nboolean f = false.\n\nSo, in Fortran, we need to set these variables before the loop.\n\nWe can initialize temp=0, q=0, w=0, e=0, f = .false.\n\nThen the loop runs over each pair, reading a and b.\n\nInside the loop, the code does:\n\nif (temp < a[i]) { ... }\n\nWait, in Fortran, the variables inside the loop: the variable 'a's array elements are a(i) in Fortran.\n\nLet me go through each condition:\n\nFirst block:\n\nif (temp < a[i]) {\n\n   if (q > b[i]) {\n\n      f = true;\n\n   }\n\n   q = b[i]\n\n   temp = a[i]\n\n}\n\nWait, in Java, the array indexes are 0-based. So in Fortran, as per 1-based, the variable a(i) is equivalent to a[i] in Java.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (temp < a(i)) then\n\n   if (q > b(i)) then\n\n      f = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   q = b(i)\n\n   temp = a(i)\n\nend if\n\nSimilarly, the next condition:\n\nif (temp > a[i]) {\n\n   if (q < b[i]) {\n\n      f = true;\n\n   }\n\n   q = b[i]\n\n   temp = a[i]\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code, these two conditions (temp < a[i] and temp > a[i]) are separate. However, perhaps there's a problem if temp equals a[i], but perhaps the code doesn't care in that case.\n\nBut I need to transcribe them as in the original code.\n\nThus, in Fortran:\n\nelse if (temp > a(i)) then\n\n   if (q < b(i)) then\n\n      f = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   q = b(i)\n\n   temp = a(i)\n\nend if\n\nWait, actually in Java, those are two separate 'if' statements after the first, not else clauses. So the code first checks if temp < a[i], does the part. Then separately checks if temp > a[i], does another part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code could have multiple branches. Oh right, in Java:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nThere are 4 if blocks:\n\n1. if (temp < a[i]) { ... }\n\n2. if (temp > a[i]) { ... }\n\nThen two more if:\n\n3. if (a[i] > w) { ... }\n\n4. if (a[i] < w) { ... }\n\nThese are four separate conditions, so the code needs to transcribe all of them as separate conditionals.\n\nWait:\n\nThe first part:\n\nif (temp is less than a[i]) do something.\n\nElse, perhaps not, but the second if (temp > a[i]) is a separate condition. So in Fortran, the two initial if statements are separate.\n\nSame for the other two conditions. So need to handle that in code.\n\nSo in the loop over i from 1 to n:\n\nOnce a(i) and b(i) are read:\n\nFirst check the temp < a(i):\n\nif (temp < a(i)) then\n\n    ... set f, update q and temp\n\nelse\n\n   check if temp > a(i). Wait, no, in Java they are separate. So perhaps:\n\nFirst code:\n\nif (temp < a(i)) then\n\n   if (q > b(i)) then\n\n      f = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   q = b(i)\n\n   temp = a(i)\n\nend if\n\nThen, a separate:\n\nif (temp > a(i)) then\n\n   if (q < b(i)) then\n\n      f = .true.\n\n   end if\n\n   q = b(i)\n\n   temp = a(i)\n\nend if\n\nWait, but what if temp equals a(i)? Then both would be skipped.\n\nNow the next two ifs:\n\n 3. if (a[i] > w) then ... \n\nHere, in the third if:\n\nif (a(i) > w) then\n\n    w = a(i)\n\n    if (b[i] < e ) then f = true end if\n\n    e = b[i]\n\nend if\n\nThen the fourth condition:\n\n4. if (a[i] < w ) then\n\n    if (b[i] > e ) then f = true end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, in the fourth:\n\nif (a[i] < w) then:\n\n   if (b[i] > e ) then f becomes true end if\n\nend if\n\nWait, in the original Java, the code:\n\nif (a[i] > w) { \n\n    w = a[i]; \n\n    if (b[i] < e) f = true; \n\n    e = b[i]; \n\n} \n\nif (a[i] < w) { \n\n   if (b[i] > e) f = true; \n\n}\n\nBut wait, after the first if, if a[i] > w sets w to a[i], so in the same iteration, the second if (a < w) would not be true if a was just set to be greater than previous w. Hmm, but need to transcribe exactly.\n\nSo the code first checks if current a[i] is larger than w (the previous maximum). If yes, then: \n\n- set w to a[i]\n\n- set e = b[i], but before that, compare if the new b[i] (which is the current one) is less than the previous e. Wait, in the code: the existing e is the old value? Because the current w was previous. \n\nWait let me redo the Java code for that third block:\n\nif (a[i] > w) {\n\n   w = a[i]; // so first set w to the larger value. \n\n   if (b[i] < e) { // e is previous e value (before the assignment to e)\n\n      f = true;\n\n   }\n\n   e = b[i]; // then set e to this new b[i].\n\n}\n\nWait, so in Java's code, the check for b[i] < e is using the old e, before updating e. So that's important.\n\nIn Fortran code:\n\nin the same sequence:\n\n  if (a(i) > w) then \n\n    ! save old e and w before?\n\n    ! or proceed step-wise:\n\n    ! first set the new w\n\n    w = a(i)\n\n    ! then check if the current b(i) < previous e (now stored in e)\n\n    if (b(i) < e) then\n\n       f = .true.\n\n    end if\n\n    ! then set e to b(i)\n\n    e = b(i)\n\n  end if\n\nSame for the code's logic.\n\nFor the fourth conditional in the loop (after those three):\n\nNext, the fourth 'if' block in Java is:\n\nif (a[i] < w) {\n\n   if (b[i] > e) {\n\n      f = true;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nif (a(i) < w) then \n\n   if (b(i) > e) then \n\n      f = .true.\n\n   end if \n\nend if \n\nYes, exactly.\n\nNow, after all iterations, the final f value is checked, and then \"Happy Alex\" or \"Poor Alex\" printed accordingly.\n\nI need to code this all correctly.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the declaration.\n\nLet me outline the structure:\n\nWe need to read n first. Then allocate arrays of size n.\n\nDeclare variables:\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a,b\n\ninteger :: i, temp, q, w, e\n\nlogical :: f\n\nThen:\n\nread *, n\n\nallocate(a(n))\n\nallocate(b(n))\n\nthen, read the pairs. So for each i from 1 to n, read a(i) and b(i):\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   read *, a(i), b(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the code reads all a and b in the loop. Let me check the original code's loop. The Java code does for each i, gets a[i] and b[i].\n\nYes, so in Fortran, perhaps the loop from 1 to n where the a and b are read, then process the rest in the same loop, or can separate.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, the entire logic (including the ifs after reading a and b) is done in the same loop.\n\nYes, so the FORTRAN code has to first read the data in a and b, and then loop through each element applying all the conditions.\n\nWait, in the Java code's main loop for(int i ...), the first two lines are getting a[i] and b[i]. The rest of the code is inside that loop. So in Fortran, the loop must first read the pair, then run the if checks, etc.\n\nTherefore, it's better to do the reading of a and b inside the same loop where all the processing happens. Thus, the code would be:\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   ! read this iteration's a and b first\n\n   read *, a(i), b(i)\n\n   ! Now perform the rest of the checks inside the loop.\n\n   ... checks here ...\n\nend do\n\nAlternatively, pre-read all a and b first. But perhaps the first approach is better. Let me think.\n\nLet me see the Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_problem\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: n\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b\n\n   integer :: i, temp, q, w, e, \n\n   logical :: f \n\n   ! initialize variables\n\n   read(*,*) n\n\n   allocate( a(n), b(n) )\n\n   temp = 0\n\n   q = 0\n\n   w = 0\n\n   e =0 \n\n   f = .false.\n\n   do i=1, n\n\n       read*, a(i), b(i)\n\n       ! process each a and b here\n\n       if (temp < a(i)) then\n\n           if (q > b(i)) then \n\n               f = .true.\n\n           end if \n\n           q = b(i)\n\n           temp = a(i)\n\n       end if \n\n       if (temp > a(i)) then \n\n           if (q < b(i)) then \n\n               f = .true.\n\n           end if \n\n           q = b(i)\n\n           temp = a(i)\n\n       end if \n\n       if (a(i) > w) then \n\n           w = a(i)\n\n           if (b(i) < e) then \n\n               f = .true.\n\n           end if \n\n           e = b(i)\n\n       end if \n\n       if ( a(i) < w ) then \n\n           if ( b(i) > e ) then \n\n               f = .true.\n\n           end if \n\n       end if \n\n   end do \n\n   if (f) then \n\n       print*, 'Happy Alex'\n\n   else\n\n       print*, 'Poor Alex'\n\n   end if\n\nend program codeforces_problem\n\nWait, but there's an issue here:\n\nIn the third condition block (checking a(i) >w), the sequence is important. The original code first sets w = new a(i), checks if current b(i) < e (using previous e), then sets e to b(i). \n\nYes, so in the code above that is preserved: after setting w = a(i), the code checks if the new b is less than the old e (before e gets updated).\n\nTherefore, the code seems okay.\n\nAnother thing: in the second IF (temp > a(i)), after the first if, if the first block (temp < a) was executed, then the second condition may or may not be still true.\n\nWait no in the first case: Suppose initially temp is 0. Then for the first iteration's a(1)=5, so temp <5 is true, so we execute first block. Then after that code, temp becomes 5. So for next iterations, temp will be 5.\n\nBut each loop iteration is separate. That's okay.\n\nYes, perhaps that's okay.\n\nNow check the code's variables. Let me see if variables are initialized properly.\n\nInitial variables:\n\ntemp =0, q=0, w=0, e=0, f=false.\n\nWait, but in the original code, variables w and e are being updated. So in the first iteration, for example, if a(1) > w (which is 0), then w will be set to a(1), then compare if (current b's b(i) < e (which is 0). So if b(i) is negative (unlikely?), then f becomes true.\n\nWait but in the problem, perhaps the inputs are positive or other constraints. Anyway, the code is transcribed as per the original.\n\nAnother point: in the second if clause, 'if (temp > a(i) ) then' \u2014 suppose temp was just set in the first clause to a(i). Then temp would be equal to a(i) so won't trigger this. So overlapping of variables is okay.\n\nThe code should be okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nWhat if n is 1?\n\nSuppose n=1, and a(1)=5, b(1)=3.\n\nFirst, loop starts i=1:\n\nRead a(1)=5, b(1)=3\n\nCheck temp (initially 0) <5: yes. \n\nThen check if q (0) > b(i) (3 ? 0>3? No \u2192 so no f set.\n\nThen set q=3, temp=5.\n\nThen next condition: temp (5) > a(i) (5 \u21925>5? No. So skips this.\n\nProceed to the next conditions.\n\nThe third condition: a(1)=5 > w(0). \n\nSo set w to 5. Then check if b(1) (3) < e (0)? 3>0 \u2192 no. So f remains false. \n\nThen set e to 3.\n\nThen the fourth condition: a < w \u2192 5<5? No, so skips that.\n\nThus, f is false \u2192 output \u2018poor\u2019.\n\nIs that correct with original Java code?\n\nHmm. The Java code's output for n=1 and input 5 3 would be 'Poor Alex'?\n\nWait, in original Java code, let me see:\n\nIn the code's first pair, temp is 0. After setting a[0] =5, and b[0]=3.\n\nThe temp < a[i] is true, so:\n\nq =3, temp=5.\n\nSecond condition (temp> a doesn't apply)\n\nThird condition: a[i] (5> w (initial 0), so w becomes 5, then:\n\nif b[i] (3) < old e (0) \u2192 3 <0 is false \u2192 nothing. \n\nThen e=3.\n\nFourth condition: a < w (5 <5 no \u2192 no.\n\nThus, f remains false \u2192 output 'Poor'.\n\nYes, so correct.\n\nAnother test case: Let's see a scenario where f becomes true.\n\nSuppose n=2.\n\nFirst pair (a, b) = (3, 6). \n\nSecond pair: (2, 5). \n\nLet me see.\n\nFirst iteration (i=1).\n\ntemp is 0 <3 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if q (0) >6? \u2192 0>6 no. Thus, f remains false. Then q becomes 6 and temp 3.\n\nThen second condition: temp 3>3? (n/a).\n\nThird condition: a (3> w (0). so set w =3. then check if current b (6 is b?) wait no, wait input first pair is a=3, b=6:\n\nWait let me check step by step.\n\nWait in first iteration, a is 3, b is6.\n\nThird condition: a>i's a:3> w (0 \u2192 yes.\n\nw\u21923. \n\nthen the check is if (b[i] < e (initial 0). Since b[i] is 6 (so 6 <0? no. Thus f still false.\n\nSet e to 6.\n\nFourth condition: check a=3 < w=3 \u2192 no \u2192 skip.\n\nProceed to second iteration. i=2:\n\na(2)=2, b=5.\n\nFirst check temp (3) < current a (2? 3 <2? no \u2192 skip first condition.\n\nCheck temp=3 > a (2? yes.\n\nThus second condition:\n\ntemp (3) > a (2).\n\ncurrent q is still 6 (since the first condition didn't fire).\n\nCheck if q < current b (5? 6 <5 \u2192 no \u2192 so f remains.\n\nThen set q = b (5?), and temp becomes 2.\n\nThus q becomes 5, temp is 2.\n\nWait wait why? The code says in the second condition:\n\nif (temp > a[i]):\n\nif q < b[i], so q was 6, so 6 <5 \u2192 false, so no f set. \n\nThen set q=5 (since assigns q = b[i] (5?), yes.\n\n Temp is set to a[i] (2).\n\nThus after this block, the new values are temp=2, q=5.\n\nThen proceed to third condition (a(2)=2> w which was before 3 \u2192 no.\n\nFourth condition: a(2)=2 < w (3). So yes.\n\nCheck if b(2)=5 > e which was 6? 5>6 \u2192 no. So f still no.\n\nThus, all done. At end, f remains false \u2192 so output 'Poor Alex'.\n\nWait, but in another scenario.\n\nLet's try:\n\nInput:\n\nn=3\n\nPairs:\n\n5 4\n\n6 3\n\n5 2 \n\nWait, let's see what happens.\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\na=5, b=4.\n\ntemp 0 <5 \u2192 first clause.\n\nq (0) >4 \u2192 no. Set q=4. temp=5. \n\nCheck third condition: a >w (0 \u2192 yes. so set w=5. \n\nCheck if b(4) < e=0 \u2192 4>0 \u2192 no \u2192 f stays false.\n\nset e=4 now.\n\nFourth condition: a=5 <w (which was 0 now 5, so no. \n\nProceed to i=2.\n\nPair 6,3:\n\na=6, b=3.\n\nfirst condition: temp was 5 <6 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck q (4) > b=3 \u2192 4>3 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus set f =true here.\n\nThen, after that: \n\nq becomes 3, temp set to6. \n\nAlso proceed third, fourth checks.\n\nThird condition: a=6> w (5 \u2192 yes. \n\nSet w=6.\n\nCheck if b (3) < e (4 \u2192 yes (3<4). \n\nThus f is already true. \n\nThen set e to3. \n\nFourth condition: a=6 <w (no).\n\nProceed to third iteration i=3.\n\nPair (5,2):\n\nCheck first temp (current is 6 after second iteration) <5 \u21926>5 \u2192 first condition no.\n\nCheck second: temp 6>5 \u2192yes.\n\nCheck q was 3 < current b=2 \u2192 3 <2? no \u2192 so no f change. \n\nSet q to2 and temp to5.\n\nthird condition a=5 < w (6 \u2192 no.\n\nFourth condition a=5 <w (6 \u2192 yes.\n\nCheck if b is 2> e (3 now? Since after the second step e was set to 3). \n\nWait in second iteration e was set to3 after third condition block. \n\nThus in this iteration, current e is 3. The current b is 2. b < e \u2192 thus the fourth condition is (a <w), and the check if b>i>s b(2) > e (3?) no. \n\nThus f is true from the second loop, so overall true \u2192 happy.\n\nThus, the output would be 'Happy'.\n\nIn this case, the Fortran code would do the same.\n\nSo the code might be correct.\n\nNow coding that, but in Fortran:\n\nWait looking at the code I sketched earlier, the structure is correct. \n\nAnother thing: variables must be declared before use. In the code's variables, w and e are integers initialized to 0. \n\nLet me check the code again:\n\nVariables are:\n\ninteger :: n, temp, q, w, e\n\nlogical :: f\n\ninitialized before do loop:\n\ntemp =0, q=0, w=0, e=0, f =.false.\n\nThe loops:\n\nIn the code structure above, the variables are properly initialized.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWait in the first IF block:\n\nif (temp < a(i)) \u2192 when a(i) is 5, initial temp 0.\n\nYes, so correct.\n\nSecond clause after the first, but separate.\n\nNow, for the fourth conditional:\n\nThe fourth condition is if (a < w), then check if b[i] > e.\n\nYes, because in the code: \n\nif (a[i] < w):\n\n   if ( b[i] > e \u2192 set to f.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, are there any variable initialization errors?\n\nYes, the variable e starts as zero. So in the first iteration, if a is larger than zero, then w is set to a, then check if b < e (which is zero). Thus, even if b is positive and less than e (0?), it would trigger? But since e is set to b only after that check.\n\nWait yes. For example, if a and b are 3 and -1. Then in the 3rd condition block, the initial e is 0, so if b is -1 <0 \u2192 f is set to true, then e is set to -1.\n\nHmm, but this is per the original Java code.\n\nSo in the code it's correct.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should be as written above.\n\nNow, in Fortran, arrays can be read in one go. But perhaps better to read each pair step by step as per the loop.\n\nWait, if I code the 'read a(i), b(i)' inside the do loop, then after allocation, loop over i from 1 to n, and in each iteration, read a(i) and b(i), then compute.\n\nThe code should look like the code I've written earlier.\n\nAnother thing: the code's first two condition blocks may sometimes have temp and q updated, changing their values for future loops. Which is intended.\n\nYes, that's part of the algorithm, as in the Java code.\n\nThus, the Fortran code should now be correct.\n\nAnother small thing: In Fortran, in the print statements, the strings must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\nYes. \n\nFinal Fortran code would be as written above."
