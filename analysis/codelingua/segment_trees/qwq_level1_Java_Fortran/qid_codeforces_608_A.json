    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code is doing.\n\nThe Java program reads input parameters: first, an integer n, then an integer s. Then, it reads n pairs of integers (f and t). For each pair, it calculates f + t and keeps track of the maximum value of these sums. Finally, it outputs the maximum between this max value and s.\n\nSo translating this to Fortran requires me to handle input/output, loops, and variables. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in Java, they use a FastScanner class for efficient input. But in Fortran, I can just read from stdin using read(*,*) statements. Since Fortran is more straightforward for I/O, I might not need a custom class here.\n\nStart by declaring variables. The main variables are n, s, max, f, t. The max variable needs to be initialized to 0.\n\nThe structure will be roughly:\n\nRead n and s.\n\nInitialize max to 0.\n\nLoop n times:\n\n    Read f and t.\n\n    Compute current_sum = f + t.\n\n    If current_sum > max, then update max.\n\nAfter the loop, compute the maximum between max and s and print that.\n\nWait, the Java code's final output is Math.max(max, s). So that's right.\n\nNow, for Fortran syntax:\n\nVariables need to be declared. Let's see: in free-form Fortran (modern style), use integers.\n\nProgram Structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_608_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, s, max_val, f, t, current_sum\n\n    read(*,*) n, s\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    do while (n > 0)\n        read(*,*) f, t\n        current_sum = f + t\n        if (current_sum > max_val) then\n            max_val = current_sum\n        end if\n        n = n -1\n    end do\n\n    print *, max(max_val, s)\n\nend program codeforces_608_A\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the loop might be better with a counting variable. The code uses n-- in Java, so in Fortran, we can do a loop from 1 to n.\n\nAlternatively, since n is being decremented, but in the Java code, the loop is 'while (n-- >0) which is a common pattern. Let me think: Initially n is the count. For each iteration, n is decremented, and if it's still >0, loop continues. So the loop runs exactly n times. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, it's cleaner to use a do loop:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\nthen inside, read f and t, etc. That might be better.\n\nWait, the original code uses while(n-- >0), which starts with the original n value. Let me see:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nthen loop: while (n-- >0)\n\nSo the first iteration happens if n was positive. After entering, n is decremented. So the loop runs exactly n times.\n\nHence in Fortran, better to do a loop from 1 to initial n. Let's correct that.\n\nSo, to avoid using the decrement in the loop variable, perhaps better:\n\nRead n, s.\n\nThen do i = 1, n\n\nthen read each pair.\n\nSo changing the variables.\n\nHence adjusting the code:\n\nRewriting:\n\nprogram codeforces_608_A\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer :: n, s, max_val, f, t, current_sum\n\n    read(*,*) n, s\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    integer :: i\n\n    do i = 1, n\n\n        read(*,*) f, t\n\n        current_sum = f + t\n\n        if (current_sum > max_val) then\n\n            max_val = current_sum\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\n    print *, max(max_val, s)\n\nend program codeforces_608_A\n\nHmm, but in Fortran, is the max function available?\n\nWait, Fortran has the max function, yes. So max(a,b) gives the maximum. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the arguments are integers. Since all variables here are integers, that's okay.\n\nTesting some possible cases.\n\nBut perhaps the variables should be declared with appropriate types. Let me list all variables:\n\nn is the number of pairs, so integer.\n\ns is the initial s (as per the problem), integer.\n\nmax_val starts at 0, updates.\n\ncurrent_sum is each f + t. So all integers.\n\nThis code should work. \n\nWait, in the code, when reading, the read statements. Are there any issues with input? For example, in Java they are using a FastScanner which splits tokens, so each nextInt() reads the next number in the line.\n\nSimilarly in Fortran, the read(*,*) statements read formatted input, so if numbers are on separate lines or separated by spaces, it should work.\n\nAssuming inputs are coming in the way that read(*,*) expects. So that should be okay.\n\nWait the FastScanner is used in Java, but in the code, the user is using both sc (Scanner) and a FastScanner? Let me check the Java code again.\n\nWait looking at the Java code again. There is a FastScanner and also a Scanner sc. Wait, the FastScanner class is present in the code as part of the code class, but in the main function, they create a FastScanner in = new FastScanner(); a Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); but in the code, they only use sc's methods, not the FastScanner. That seems redundant. Probably, maybe a copy-paste error. Because the code uses sc.nextInt() which is the Scanner. The FastScanner has methods like nextInt(), but they are not used here. So probably the code uses sc (the standard Scanner), but maybe in some cases uses the FastScanner, but in the main code, they only use sc. Hmm, but that's an aside.\n\nIn any case, translating to Fortran doesn't require using multiple input methods, since we'll just use read.\n\nThus, the translated code should be as above.\n\nWait, in the original Java code, after reading n and s, they proceed to process n pairs. The loop is 'while (n-- >0)', which is a loop that runs n times, starting with the original value. So the loop runs exactly n times. The same as the for i in 1 to n loop.\n\nSo the Fortran code with the DO loop should be correct.\n\nLet me write the code again clearly:\n\nProgram codeforces_608_A\n\n  Implicit None\n\n  Integer :: n, s, max_val, f, t, i\n\n  Read *, n, s\n\n  max_val = 0\n\n  Do i = 1, n\n\n    Read *, f, t\n\n    If (f + t > max_val) Then\n\n      max_val = f + t\n\n    End If\n\n  End Do\n\n  Write (*,*) Max(max_val, s)\n\nEnd Program codeforces_608_A\n\nWait, I can even omit the current_sum variable, since f + t can be used directly.\n\nThat's better, saving a variable.\n\nSo yes, this should work.\n\nTesting with a sample case:\n\nSuppose input is 3 10\n\nThen three pairs: say 5 3, (sum 8, so max now 8), next pair 6 4 (sum 10, new max), then 7 0 (sum7). So the max would be 10. The s is 10. So the output would be max(10, 10) =10. Correct.\n\nAnother case: 2 5\n\nPairs 3 0 (3), 4 1 (5). Max is 5. So between s=5 and 5, it's 5. So correct.\n\nAnother case where max exceeds s: let s be 5, pairs have 6 and 0. Then max becomes 6. So output is 6>5.\n\nYes.\n\nFortran's max function should handle that. So the code should work.\n\nThus, the final code should look like that. So putting it all together."
