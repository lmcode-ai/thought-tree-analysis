    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The main method takes an integer n from the user and then outputs the nth character of a generated string. The generateString method builds a string by appending numbers from 1 to 1000. So, the first character is '1', then '2' up to 1000, and each number is converted to its string form.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how to create that concatenated string of numbers 1-1000 in Fortran. In Java, it's using a StringBuilder, but Fortran doesn't have an equivalent. So, maybe I can build a character array or a single string variable by looping from 1 to 1000, converting each integer to a string, and appending it to the string.\n\nWait, in Java, generateString() returns a character array. But in Fortran functions have to return a single array or value. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can construct an array of characters directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute the entire string, represented as a character array long enough to hold all the numbers. Let's think about the total length. The numbers from 1 to 1000 can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit (since 1000 has four digits). Let me compute the total length required:\n\nNumbers 1-9: 9 numbers, each 1 digit \u2192 9\n10-99: 90 numbers, each 2 digits \u2192 180\n100-999: 900 numbers, each 3 digits \u2192 2700\n1000: 4 digits \u2192 4\nTotal is 9+180=189, 189+2700=2889, 2889+4=2893 characters. So the string needs 2893 characters. So the array has to be of size 2893.\n\nSo, in Fortran, I can create a character array of size 2893, build the string into it, then just index the (n)th element (adjusting for 1-based indexing in Fortran and Java's 0-based array).\n\nWait, in Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, unless specified. So in the Java code, the user inputs n and they do n-1 to index the array (since 0-based there). In Fortran, the array would be 1-based, so perhaps the user inputs n would use directly, but need to confirm.\n\nFirst step: create the character string. The loop in Java appends each integer i from 1 to 1000, so I can do the same:\n\nLoop i from 1 to 1000 inclusive:\n\nConvert i to a string (CHAR or string descriptor) and append it to the main string array.\n\nSo in Fortran, perhaps the way is to have a character array of length 2893, then loop and for each i, write its string to a temporary character variable, and then place it at the current position in the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a character variable to build up the string.\n\nWait, but Fortran variables have fixed length, so a character variable has a set length, unless we use an assumed-length or as in Fortran 2003 perhaps unlimited? I think in Fortran 90, the maximum length is compiler-dependent, but assuming it can handle 2893 characters.\n\nAlternatively, the better approach is to build the entire string as a character array with length 2893.\n\nLet me think how to structure this.\n\nWe can have a function generate_string that returns the character array of length 2893. But in Fortran, functions returning character arrays can be done, but need to know the length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to handle the generation in the main program, but better to use a subroutine or function.\n\nWait, in the Java code, generateString is static, so in Fortran a function is okay.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the Java code steps:\n\nIn the main function:\n\n- Read n (the user inputs a number n from 1 to ... (up to the string length 2893).\n\n- Output the (n-1)th character. Because in Java, arrays are zero-based, so for the first character, it's 0's index.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays start at 1 by default, so the function would build an array with indices 1 to 2893. Therefore, if the Fortran code uses a 1-based array, then for the user input n, we can directly take n, but if the code uses 0-based arrays (which is non-standard), would be different.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the array can be declared with a given length. Let's say:\n\nIn Fortran, we have a CHARACTER(LEN=2893) :: s\n\nBut building it would require concatenating each number.\n\nThe loop in Fortran would start with s = ' ' or some initialization, but perhaps better to concatenate each time.\n\nWait, but how to efficiently build a string in Fortran by appending each number's string.\n\nAn approach:\n\nInitialize a character variable with enough length to hold all concatenated numbers. Let's say the variable 's' starts as an empty string. Then, for each i from 1 to 1000:\n\ns = s // TRIM(ADJUSTL(STR(i)))\n\nWait, but how do you convert an integer to a string in Fortran.\n\nIn Fortran, you can use internal write.\n\nFor example, each integer i can be written into a character string.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nInitialize a character array s with sufficient length. The exact size is 2893.\n\nInitialize the index position to 1.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 1000:\n\nConvert i into a string, e.g. using a temporary character variable. Let's say we set a temporary variable temp as the string representation of i.\n\nFor example,\n\ntemp = '     ' (allocating enough space, say 4 characters for each number up to 1000)\n\nBut actually, instead of pre-allocating:\n\nUse an internal write:\n\ninteger :: i\n\ncharacter(len=*) :: temp\n\nwrite(temp, *) i\n\nBut better to use the ADJUSTL and trim function.\n\nAlternatively, how to do this:\n\nWe can loop over each number, and for each number, we write it into a character buffer, then append to the main string.\n\nAlternatively, let's step through:\n\nThe total length is known (2893), so allocate s as a character array of that length.\n\nInitialize a variable 'current position' as starting at 1.\n\nThen for each i in 1 to 1000:\n\n1. Convert i to a string (say, temp).\n\n2. Get the length of that string.\n\n3. Copy it into the s array starting at position offset.\n\n4. Update the offset.\n\nWait, that method may be more efficient memory-wise than building via strings, but perhaps inFortran it's more straightforward to build via an array.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible plan:\n\nIn Fortran, the code could look like this:\n\nfunction generatesString() result(s)\n    character(len=2893) :: s\n    character(len=4) :: temp\n    integer :: i, pos\n    s = ''\n    pos = 1\n    do i = 1, 1000\n       write(temp, '(I4)') i\n       temp = adjustl(temp)  ! remove leading spaces\n       s(pos:) = temp\n       pos = pos + len_trim(temp)\n    end do\nend function generateString\n\nWait, but using string assignment. However, the assignment s(pos:) = temp would require the target substring to be same length, but temp is 4 characters, but the length needed is the trimmed length. So perhaps better to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use an internal file with write:\n\nFor each i, convert to a string and using the write statement, append to the position in the target array:\n\nInitialize the target array.\n\nWhen writing internally, maybe this is possible.\n\nWait, this might be tricky. Let me think again of steps.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nInitialise the target array (s) of length 2893 as filled with spaces perhaps? Or automatically empty?\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to 1000:\n\nwe convert i to a string (say, with variable tempi, length as needed), then copy each character of tempi to s starting at the current position.\n\nThe exact steps could be like this:\n\ns = ' '\npos = 1\n\ndo i=1, 1000\n   call add_number_to_string(s, pos, i)\nend do\n\nwhere sub procedure add_number_to_string takes a current number, and appends it.\n\nAlternatively, how to implement this in Fortran:\n\nPerhaps in Fortran, the most straightforward way is:\n\nBuild the string character by character. For each number, convert it to a character string, and then assign the characters starting at the current position.\n\nExample code for the function:\n\ncharacter(len=2893) function generate_string()\n    integer :: i\n    integer :: pos\n    character(len=20) :: temp  ! (long enough to hold any number's string)\n    generate_string = ' '      ! Initialize all spaces (or whatever)\n    pos = 1\n    do i = 1, 1000\n        write(temp, '(I10)') i  ! Writes the integer into the temp, but I10 is sufficient since 1000 is 4 digits.\n                                ! (Actually, I4 would be enough but maybe to be safe)\n        temp = trim(adjustl(temp))  ! removes leading spaces\n        ! Now write each character from the temporary string into the main array\n        generate_string(pos:pos + len_trim(temp)-1) = temp\n        pos = pos + len_trim(temp)\n    end do\nend function generate_string\n\nWait, that could work. Let's see:\n\nThe temporary variable temp has the entire number with leading zeros (but actually, I10 would format with leading spaces, so we use adjustl to move the numeric text to the left, then trim to get rid of spaces. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the formatting code: when you write i=1 to (I10), it writes the integer as a 10 character long string, with leading blanks. So for i=5, temp will have 9 spaces then '5'. Apply adjustl: it moves the non-blank region to the left, so the temp becomes '5       ' followed by 9 spaces? Wait, no, adjustl moves all characters left so that leading spaces collapse. So in this case, the '5' is at the first non-blank position, and the rest are spaces, but trim would simply remove trailing blanks, so TRIM(adjustl(temp)) would give the actual length. Wait, perhaps better to write it as just TRIM(temp) and not adjustl? Wait let's think again:\n\nThe formatted output for i=5 using I10 would produce a string with nine spaces followed by the digit 5. So the string temp would be \"         5\".\n\nSo TRIM(temp) would remove all trailing blanks (the 5 is last non-blank character), so TRIM(temp) would have just the single '5' followed by 9 spaces not? Or does TRIM remove all trailing blanks. So the TRIM(temp) would leave just the part up to the last non-blank character. So in this case, the last non-blank character is the '5', so the length would be 1, and the string is \"5\" followed by spaces?\n\nWait, the TRIM function removes all trailing blanks in the string. The original string is \"         5 \" (if 10 characters, but no. Wait, I10 would need to see. Let me think, for an I10 format descriptor, the number takes 4 digits, so \"1000\" is 4, so the write to temp of 10 characters would be followed by six blanks? No, actually the 1000 would be written in I10 as \"   1000\" perhaps? Wait no:\n\nWait, let's test: If writing a number say 1 to a variable of length 10 with I10 format.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nThe output would be '          1', but actually the width is 10, so padding left with spaces so that the total length is 10. The digits take the minimum needed plus the leading spaces.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use an edit descriptor that ensures that the number is written without leading spaces except what's needed? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using an A edit descriptor with a to_string function?\n\nAlternatively, another way to get the characters properly is to use a more appropriate format:\n\nThe number n can be formatted as an I4 field. Because the largest is 1000, which needs 4 digits. So using I4.\n\nSo if I write to a character variable of length 4, using I4:\n\nThen for i=5, it would be '   5', with three leading blanks. Then adjustl would move the '5' to the first position, so becomes '5  ' (spaces after). Then TRIM would remove the trailing blanks. Wait, no, TRIM would only remove trailing blanks. The three leading spaces after adjustment?\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe an easier way is to write the integer into a temporary string and then use TRIM(ADJUSTL(...) ?\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nTo get the string of number i as a character string with no leading/trailing spaces, perhaps I can do something like:\n\nwrite(temp, '(I0)') i\n\nThen temp will have the numeric value without leading spaces. But in Fortran, when you write with I0, the number is written without leading spaces. But then the temporary variable's length needs to be enough to hold the biggest number: 4 digits.\n\nHmm, let me check I0. Oh, I0 allows for the minimal width. So that the number is written with the minimum number of digits necessary. But in this case, the variable temp has to be large enough. So if I have temp as len(20), then writing 1 as I0 would give a single '1', and the rest are spaces, so when trim(temp) is taken, the value is the number without leading or trailing spaces. Wait, but the left side may have spaces beyond the number's digits. Wait, maybe scratch that.\n\nAnother idea:\n\nAlternatively, write the integer into an integer string using Fortran's internal conversion. For example:\n\nuse intrinsic methods, perhaps standard in Fortran 2003:\n\nIn Fortran 2003, you can do:\n\ncharacter(len(:)), allocatable :: temp = ' '\ntemp = trim(temp) and something else? Or use the appropriate intrinsic functions.\n\nWait, in Fortran 2008, the intrinsic function 'ltrim' or something, but perhaps a portable way using the 'string' intrinsic?\n\nHmm, perhaps the easiest way is to stick with the Iw format and take care.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of code:\n\nSuppose we use a temporary character variable of length 4 (since 1000 is 4 characters). So for all numbers 1-1000, the maximum length is 4.\n\ncharacter(len=4) :: temp\ninteger :: i\ndo ... loop over i:\n   write(temp, '(I4)') i\n   temp = adjustl(temp) ! bring the number to the left, so leading blanks are gone except on the right?\n   ! Then the length of the current string's non-blank part is len_trim(temp) \u2192 but since the number is 4 digits for 1000, 3 for 999 etc.\n\nWait, the function ADJUSTL(temp) would move the leftmost non-blank character to position 1, and the rest follow, padding with blanks on the right. So for i=5,\n\ntemp after write is \"   5\", then adjustl makes it \"5  \".\n\nSo trim(temp) gives \"5\" and the length is 1.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nAfter ADJUSTL(\"   5\"), the result is \"5  \", right? So TRIM(\"5  \") gives \"5\".\n\nWait, TRIM removes trailing blanks. The adjusted string is \"5\" followed by two spaces. So TRIM in this case would remove the two trailing spaces, so the length is 1.\n\nYes. So:\n\nchar(len=4) :: temp\nwrite(temp,'(I4)') i\ntrimmed = TRIM( ADJUSTL( temp ) )\n\nWait, but first, ADJUSTL(\"   5\") becomes \"5  \", which has the first character '5' followed by two spaces, then the pos would take the length as 1. Because TRIM(\"5  \") gives a length 1.\n\nWait, but TRIM(adjustl(temp))'s length is exactly the length of the number's string.\n\nSo the correct way would be:\n\nThe string to be added is the trim(adjustl(temp)), which is the actual numeric string with no leading or trailing spaces.\n\nTherefore, the length of that string is len(trim(...)), so the above method can be used.\n\nSo putting this all into code:\n\nThe function can be written as a function:\n\nfunction generate_string() result(s)\n    character(len=2893) :: s\n    character(len=4) :: temp\n    integer :: i, pos\n    s = '0'  ! initializing all to spaces might be better, but can be []\n    s = ' '  ! initializing the array to all blanks?\n    pos = 1\n    do i = 1, 1000\n        write(temp, '(I4)') i\n        temp = adjustl(temp)\n        temp = trim(temp) ! can we combine?\n        s(pos:pos + len_trim(temp)-1) = temp\n        pos = pos + len_trim(temp)\n    end do\nend function generate_string\n\nWait, note that s is initialized as all spaces, then each new number's digits are placed starting at position pos. This should build the concatenated string.\n\nWait, the first operation would be:\n\ni=1:\n\nwrite(temp) gives \"   1\", ADJUSTL makes it \"1  \", then TRIM removes the trailing spaces? Wait, no:\n\nWait, after adjusting left, temp becomes '1  ' (assuming original was three leading spaces and '1' in the fourth digit. So the ADJUSTL moves the '1' to first position, trailing spaces remain after.\n\nTRIM on the adjusted variable would leave only the non-blank characters. Wait, no:\n\nTRIM is a Fortran intrinsic that removes trailing blanks. So if the variable is adjusted to \"1  \", the trailing two blanks are considered, so TRIM would give the substring \"1\" with length 1, and discard the two spaces.\n\nTherefore, the effective TRIM(adjustl(temp)) gives the string \"1\" for i=1.\n\nWait, maybe better to combine adjustl and trim?\n\nWait, the above approach:\n\ntemp = trim(adjustl( temp )) would give exactly the desired string with no leading/trailing spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just TRIM(adjustl(temp)) is redundant? Let me think:\n\nSuppose after writing, the temp is \"   5\", then adjustl gives \"5  \" (so first character is '5', rest two spaces. trim( \"5  \" ) becomes \"5\" (length 1).\n\nYes. So temp = trim(adjustl(temp)) would make temp have length equal to the actual digit count of the number.\n\nBut the temp variable is 4 characters long. So when we do the assignment s(pos:pos+len_trim(temp)-1) = temp, but actually, the right-hand side is the entire temp, which is 4 characters, but the desired part is the first len_trim(temp).\n\nWait, no. Wait:\n\nWait, in the statements:\n\ntemp is a 4-character variable, and after processing:\n\ntemp = trim(adjustl(temp)), which returns a string that is the actual numeric, with no trailing blanks.\n\nWait, no, the trim function when assigning to a variable reduces the length? Or not?\n\nWait, sorry, in Fortran, when you take trim(adjustl(temp)), which is a function returns the string without trailing blanks. But the returned length is the length without trailing blanks, so if you have a variable temp of length 4:\n\nAfter adjustl and trim:\n\ntrim(...'5  '), the result is '5', but stored in a temp of length 4 would become '5   ', no. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the function trim( temporary ) would return a character string of the same length as the variable's length, but with trailing blanks removed? Or does it return a shorter one? Wait, Fortran does not have variable length, so when you call trim(a), the result has the same length as a but trims the trailing blanks. Wait no, I think trim in fortran:\n\nThe TRIM intrinsic takes a CHARACTER argument and returns a CHARACTER with the kind and type parameters same as the argument. The length is same as the argument but the result is the contents with trailing blanks removed. However, if you try to assign this to a variable shorter than the original, you have to ensure compatibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set:\n\ntemp_trimmed = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\nwhere temp_trimmed is a variable with length 4? Because the original temp was 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to not store in temp, but use directly the trimmed string in the assignment.\n\nSo the code:\n\npartially:\n\ns(pos:) = trim(adjustl(temp))\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nFor each iteration:\n\n1. write temp with I4, which is 4 characters, so temp is something like \"   1\" for i=1.\n\nthen after adjusting left and trimming, the string is \"1\".\n\nthen s from position pos to pos + length-1 is the trimmed string.\n\nThe length is the current string's length, which is len_trim(temp).\n\nWait, but in this code, assign the substring from pos to (pos+len_trim(temp)-1), of s to temp, which is a 4-character string, but just the first len_trim(temp) characters? Wait, no. Because the right-hand side is the entire temp variable, which has the extra spaces. So maybe I need to extract the only the required part.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because when you write:\n\n    s(pos:pos + len_trim(temp)-1) = temp(1:len_trim(temp))\n\nWait, yes! That way you are assigning the first len_trim(temp) characters of temp into the appropriate slice of s.\n\nAh, right. Because the original temp may have some trailing blanks, but the desired part is only up to the non-trailing blanks. So, to take only the non-blank part, we can index the temp as from 1 to len_trim(temp).\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the assignment would be:\n\ns(pos : pos + len_trim(temp) - 1) = temp(1: len_trim(temp))\n\nTherefore the revised code section in the function becomes:\n\nInside the do loop:\n\n        write(temp, '(I4)') i\n        temp = adjustl(temp)\n        temp_length = len_trim(temp)\n        s(pos: pos + temp_length - 1) = temp(1:temp_length)\n        pos = pos + temp_length\n    end do \n\nWait but then, need to calculate the temp_length as the length of the trimmed string. Alternatively:\n\ntemp_length = len_trim(adjustl(temp)) \n\nWait, but maybe the following steps:\n\nCompute:\n\ntemp = adjustl(temp)\nstr_part = trim(temp)  \n(temp) \u2192 '1  ' in the 4 characters, after trim, becomes the first character '1', but that's perhaps stored in a string of same length.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute len_trim(temp):\n\nAfter the WRITE statement:\n\ntemp is the written I4 to a character variable of length 4.\n\nADJUSTL brings leading spaces to the end, so the actual data starts from first character.\n\nThe length of the non-space part is the length of the actual number's digits.\n\nSo len_trim(adjustl(temp)) is exactly the digits count.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor i=1000:\n\nwrite(temp, I4) \u2192 becomes '1000', so ADJUSTL (the original has no leading blanks?), yes. Because 1000 takes 4 digits, so the temp is '1000'.\n\nadjustl leaves it as '1000'.\n\nTRIM(adjustl(temp)) is still '1000', but its length is 4.\n\nSo len_trim(adjustl(temp)) would be 4. Thus the code works.\n\nBut even without adjustl:\n\nWait, if the number is written as I4:\n\nfor 1, it's '   1', so len_trim(temp) would be 1? No, because there are three leading spaces.\n\nWait, no, TRIM only removes trailing blanks. So the original temp after write(\")\", (I4)) for '1' is \"   1\", so trim(temp) is \"   1\" with the spaces before the '1' being considered as required.\n\nWait I think I made a mistake earlier. TRIM only removes trailing blanks.\n\nThus, the need to first adjust the number to the left. So, the process should be:\n\nwrite(temp, '(I4)') \u2192 gives the number with leading blanks to the left of the number. So the first part before the number are spaces, the number is to the right, but with trailing spaces after?\n\nWait, for example:\n\ni = 5, temp is '   5' (spaces, then 5).\n\nadjustl(temp) moves all non-blank characters to the left, so you have '5 ' (space in other 3?). So the adjusted temp is '5   ' (assuming 4 characters).\n\nNow, trim(adjustl(temp)) would trim the trailing blanks after the 5.\n\nWait, the adjusted version becomes: the first character is '5', then the rest are spaces. The trim would remove trailing spaces (so all characters after '5' are considered trailing?), so the trimmed string is '5'.\n\nThus, the len_trim(adjustl(temp)) gives the correct length.\n\nSo the correct code would need to consider that.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nIn the loop:\n\n    write(temp, '(I4)') i \u2192 temp \u2192 '    1' (for i=1), etc.\n\n    temp_adj = adjustl(temp) \u2192 brings all non-blank characters to the left, so for i=1, temp_adj is '1... (with leading 1 followed by spaces)\n\n    current_length = len_trim(temp_adj) \u2192 which is the length without trailing blanks (the number of digits)\n\n    start at pos, length current_length\n\nTherefore, code:\n\nInside the function generate_string:\n\n...\ninteger :: pos, current_length\n    s = ' '\n    pos = 1\n    do i = 1, 1000\n        write(temp, '(I4)') i\n        temp_adj = adjustl(temp)\n        current_length = len_trim(temp_adj)\n        s(pos:pos + current_length-1) = temp_adj(1:current_length)\n        pos = pos + current_length\n    end do\nend function generate_string\n\nBut need to declare temp_adj as a 4-character variable.\n\nWait, temp is a 4-character variable, so temp_adj is allowed to be the same len.\n\nWait thus, variables:\n\n    character(len=4) :: temp, temp_adj\n\nAh, but then temp_adj is also 4 chars. So:\n\ntemp = write as above.\n\nthen temp_adj = adjustl(temp).\n\ncurrent_length is len_trim(temp_adj).\n\nThen:\n\ns(pos: ... ) is assigned the substring of temp_adj up to current_length.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure the total length of all numbers is 2893 as we computed earlier. So let's see:\n\nNumbers from 1-9 (9 numbers) \u2192 1 digit each \u2192 total 9\n\n10-99: 90 numbers x2 = 180 \u2192 total up to 2-99: 189 before\n\nWait, already correct.\n\nThus, this function should work.\n\nNow, handling the array in Fortran.\n\nSecond part is the main program.\n\nJava's main is taking input n, then output generateString()[n-1]\n\nIn Fortran, the function returns a string (since it's the array) of length 2893, then we take the n-th position (because the array is 1-based). The user inputs an integer n. So in Fortran, 1-based:\n\nThus:\n\nprogram codeforces_...\n  implicit none\n  integer :: n\n  character(len=2893) :: s\n  read *, n\n  s = generate_string()\n  print*, s(n:n)       ! single character\nend program\n\nWait, yes. In Fortran, the first character is 1, so subscripts from 1 to 2893.\n\nThus, the main code would be straightforward:\n\nNow, testing edge cases:\n\nTest with n=1 \u2192 output '1'\n\nn= 4 \u2192 which is first three characters 123 then '4' on fourth (if first 3 numbers):\n\nWait wait numbers 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3), 4 (4), so the fourth character is 4, so if n=4, the output is '4'.\n\nAnother test: the number 999 ends at a certain position, the next is 1000.\n\nThe transition from 999 (3 digits) and 1000 (4 digits).\n\nSo the code's logic must account for that, but since the calculation of the total length is correct, and the loops are over 1000 numbers, it should.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut let's see the Fortran code:\n\nNow code:\n\nFirst, the function generate_string must be defined either as an internal function or a separate function.\n\nIn Fortran90, the function could be inside the main program or as a module.\n\nSo perhaps in the main program, declare the function inside, but it's allowed, or just write:\n\nThe code:\n\nFUNCTION generate_string() RESULT(s)\n    CHARACTER(LEN=2893) :: s\n    CHARACTER(LEN=4) :: temp, temp_adj\n    INTEGER :: i, pos, current_length\n\n    s = ' '\n    pos = 1\n    DO i = 1, 1000\n        WRITE(temp, '(I4)') i\n        temp_adj = ADJUSTL(temp)\n        current_length = LEN_TRIM(temp_adj)\n        s(pos:pos + current_length -1) = temp_adj(1:current_length)\n        pos = pos + current_length\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION generate_string\n\nprogram codeforces_672a\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    character(len=2893) :: s\n\n    read *, n\n    s = generate_string()\n    print *, trim(adjustl(s(n:n)))\n    ! alternatively, just print *, s(n:n)\n\nend program codeforces_672a\n\nWait, but what is trim doing here? No, because s(n:n) is a single character, so it's either a digit or space? Because when building the string.\n\nWait, but in the function generate_string, all spaces are replaced by the numbers, right?\n\nThe initial s is made of spaces? Wait, in the initialization, s = ' ', but that might fill all characters to the first ASCII character? Wait in Fortran, the declaration character(len=2893) s = ' '.\n\nThe default initializer for s is all spaces. So during the writing, the loop overwrites the spaces at the needed positions, and leaves the rest as blanks? No, the loop fills in all the numbers, so the entire string from position 1 to 2893 should be filled with digits, and the tail should not exist. Because the total length is exactly 2893 digits?\n\nYes, because the total digits count is 2893, as computed before, so there's no overflows, so after the loop, all positions except maybe from 2893 are properly filled. But the loop is controlled so that the pos increments correctly adding current_length to 2893: yes.\n\nTherefore, the character at s(n) will be a digit.\n\nThus, when printing s(n:n), the output is a single character. So a line such as:\n\nprint *, s(n:n)\n\nshould be sufficient. The * in the format will print the character as a Fortran string.\n\nAlternatively, but need to ensure the output is correct.\n\nWait, in Fortran, when you do print *, character-string. The asterisk as format allows the item to be printed without adjustment. So s(n:n) is a length 1.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nWait, but in the main program example, I used 'trim(adjustl(...))', which is unnecessary here. So just print $(s(n:n))?\n\nAlternatively, using print *, trin(s(n:n)) would be unneeded.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nTesting possible problem: when writing numbers, the code could have some leftover spaces if there's any mistake in the length handling?\n\nSuppose for example, the initial s is filled with spaces, but the loop correctly replaces the positions.\n\nBut let's see: the first iteration for i=1:\n\ntemp is '   1', then temp_adj is '1   ', current_length is 1 (the len_trim(temp_adj is 1, because the first character is '1', and the rest are trailing spaces after -> trim gives '1'.\n\nThus, the subarray s(1:1) is filled with '1'.\n\nThen pos becomes 2.\n\nSecond iteration i=2:\n\ntemp is '   2', adj= '2   ', current_length=1.\n\nThen s(2:2) = first 1 characters of temp_adj (i.e. '2'), so position 2 is '2'.\n\nSo proceeding, the first 9 characters are 1,2,3,...,9.\n\nThen when i=10, two digits.\n\nIn this case, the temp_adj is '10 ' (since I4 for 10 is '  10 ' (actually, let me compute it:\n\nWait for i=10: writing 10 as I4 would give '  10' ?\n\nWait I think I made a mistake earlier in the format:\n\nI4 format requires that the integer be written in a field of exactly 4 characters. Positive numbers will be written left-justified in the field, signs occupying a place?\n\nWait scratch that. The I4 format uses the field width 4, which includes any signs. However since the numbers are positive, they won't have a sign. So for the number 5:\n\nI4 is filled with 3 spaces followed by '5'\n\nfor 10 \u2192 needs 2 digits, so two spaces followed by '10'\n\nthus ' 10' (space filled before the start? No, left-aligned or right-aligned?\n\nAh here is confusion! What is the correct way numbers are written using Fortran's Iw format?\n\nI4 format for the integer 5: The number is written with leading blanks.\n\nThe Iw format by default writes the number right-justified in the field. So using I4 for 1 gives:\n\n\"   1\" \u2192 three spaces, then 1.\n\n10 would be \" 10\" \u2192 two spaces followed by '10', requiring total width of 4.\n\nAh so the correct format is the value is right-aligned (filled with blanks to the left).\n\nThus the ADJUSTL call would move the string's non-blank characters to the left, so that leading blanks are taken from the beginning.\n\nThus for 10:\n\nthe temp after write is \" 10\", which is actually ' 10', and ADJUSTL will shift everything left, so it becomes '10  ' (trimming to '10', length 2).\n\nHence the code works.\n\nSo the loop for i=10:\n\ncurrent_length = 2 \u2192 s(10?) Wait no.\n\nLet me see:\n\npos starts at 1 after first 9 numbers.\n\nAfter 1-9: pos is 1+1,... total after 9:\n\nsumming from 1 to 9, each contributing 1 digit, so after 9 elements, pos is 10 (since for the first, 1-1: pos becomes 2, then 2, etc \u2192 after 9 numbers, pos is 1 + 9*1=10.\n\nThen i=10 (the tenth number):\n\ncurrent_length is 2 \u2192 so assigns characters 10 and 11, value '1' and '0'?\n\nWait:\n\ns(10:11) is assigned temp_adj(1:2), which for temp_adj is '10' followed by two spaces (after ADJUSTL of the original \" 10\").\n\nThus the first two characters after adjustment's first two characters are '1' and '0'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final Fortran code is as written above.\n\nAnother possible optimization: the temp_adj is not necessary. Since after writing to temp, adjustl and taking the trim's length can be done in one step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\ncurrent_length = len_trim(adjustl(temp))\n\nthen in assignment:\n\ns(pos:pos + current_length-1) = adjustl(temp)(1: current_length)\n\nWait, but maybe. But whatever, the code is functionally correct.\n\nSo the overall Fortran code:\n\nThe function and the main program as:\n\nFUNCTION generate_string() RESULT(s)\n    CHARACTER(LEN=2893) :: s\n    CHARACTER(LEN=4) :: temp\n    INTEGER :: i, pos, current_length\n\n    s = ' '\n    pos = 1\n    DO i = 1, 1000\n        WRITE(temp, '(I4)') i\n        temp = ADJUSTL(temp)\n        current_length = LEN_TRIM(temp)\n        s(pos: pos + current_length - 1) = temp(1: current_length)\n        pos = pos + current_length\n    END DO\nEND FUNCTION generate_string\n\nprogram codeforces_672a\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n\n    character(len=2893) :: s\n\n    read *, n\n    s = generate_string()\n    print *, s(n:n)\nend program codeforces_672a\n\nWait, change temp_adj to directly process temp after adjustment.\n\nYes, in the function above, I can remove temp_adj variable and instead of:\n\ntemp_adj = _ , we can do:\n\nafter WRITE(temp, ...) do temp = adjustl(temp).\n\nso the revised code is more compact.\n\nHence, this is correct.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nTest n=2893 (the last character of the string 1000's fourth digit?)\n\nthe total length is 2893. the last character should be the 4th of \"1000\".\n\nYes.\n\nThe last number is 1000's digits \"1000\", so four digits. So the string ends at 2893, so the 2893rd position is '0'.\n\nThus, the function can handle this.\n\nOther tests:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nIf input is n=1 \u2192 output '1'\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn= 4 \u2192 1234's 4th is 4.\n\nThus works.\n\nThus this code should work."
