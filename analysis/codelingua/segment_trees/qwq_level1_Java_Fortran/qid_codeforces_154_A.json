    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe program reads a string, then an integer K. Then for each of K lines, it reads a two-character input. For each input pair, it processes the original string to count how many times the two characters alternate in some way and accumulate the minimum counts. The final sum is printed.\n\nHmm, let me look at the loops. The main loop goes through each character in the input string 'arr'. For each of the two characters from the current input, the variables 'a' and 'b' count their occurrences. However, whenever a character not in the pair is found, it adds the minimum of a and b to the result and resets a and b. Then, after each string process, adds whatever min(a,b) remains.\n\nIn Fortran, I need to replicate this logic. Let me think about the steps:\n\nFirst: Read the initial string. In Fortran, reading a string can be done with a read statement, but the length might vary. Need to read it into an array of characters.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are a bit tricky. Let me see. We might use a character array. Since the input could be up to some length (maybe until end of line), but in the Java code, it's read as a line, which in Fortran would be with a limited length. Perhaps using a large enough dimension. But maybe using list-directed input, like reading a string with read(*,*) to read the entire line (up to the first newline). Also, note that in Fortran, when reading a string with read(*,*,end=...), it might stop at the first blank unless using an asterisk. Hmm, but the program doesn't need to process blanks specifically unless the input includes them. Let's assume that the first input is a line read as a single string, then the next is the integer K, then K lines each of two characters? Not necessarily, but in Java's code, the second input is K as integer, then K strings each expected to be two-character? Because the Java code uses input.charAt(0) and charAt(1). So each of the K lines is a two-character string.\n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst read the initial string. Let me think: Let's reserve a character array of size, say, 100000? Or maybe parameterize it, but for simplicity, perhaps 100000 (as the problem constraints might not be known here). The Java code uses a BufferedReader, but in Fortran, we can read line by line using read(*,'(A)') and then trim the string. Wait, but in Fortran, when reading a string with implicit length, using read (*,*) might read until the first separator (space or newline?) but if the first input is the first line, then the next read would be the K, then the subsequent lines are the commands.\n\nAlternatively, using a list-directed READ, but perhaps better to read lines with an explicit format.\n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, perhaps we can read each line explicitly using ADVANCE='NO' but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe read each line with a character array of sufficient length. For example, first read the first line as a character variable. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nProcessing:\n\n1. Read the first string (the main string to analyze). Let's say, in Fortran:\n\n   character(len=100000) :: main_str\n   read(*,'(a)') main_str\n   n = len_trim(main_str)\n\n2. Read K:\n\n   integer:: K\n   read(*,*) K\n\nThen loop over K times, each time reading a two-character string (the pair to process). For each pair, process the main_str and accumulate the result.\n\nWait, each of the K lines is a two-character input. So each input line is two characters, no more? The Java code's input.readLine() would read the entire line (including possible newlines, but in the problem, I assume the two characters are on each line with possibly a space, but maybe the problem requires each line to have exactly two characters. So in Fortran, perhaps read each two-character string. \n\nAlternatively, for each K iterations:\n\ncharacter(len=2) :: input_pair\nread(*,'(a2)') input_pair\n\nBut need to ensure that each input line is two characters. So if the user enters more, it might be problematic, but that's the problem's specification. \n\nNow the main processing part. Let me think about how to loop through the main_str's characters. \n\nInitialize res and a, b variables. Then, for each iteration (each pair):\n\nres is being accumulated. Variables a and b reset to 0 each time. \n\nLoop over each character in main_str (up to n chars). \n\nFor each character at position i (starting from 1 in Fortran?), check if it's equal to the first input character, increment a; else if equal to second, increment b, else:\n\n  add min(a, b) to res, then set a and b to 0.\n\nAt the end of the loop over characters in the string, add min(a,b) to res.\n\nWait, Fortran indices are 1-based. Need to be careful.\n\nWait, in the Java code, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n\nSo the indices start at 0, going to N-1, where N is the length of the original string.\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be from 1 to n:\n\nSince the variable n is the length of the main_str (from len_trim(main_str)). \n\nTherefore, in the loop for each character in main_str: i from 1 to n.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nch = main_str(i:i) \n\nThen, compare to input_pair(1:1) and input_pair(2:2).\n\nWait, variables declarations:\n\nInside the loop over K iterations:\n\n   do k=1, K\n       read the input_pair (two characters)\n       then:\n           initialize a=0, b=0, temp_res increases...\n       and so on.\n   end do\n\nWait, the code in Java is structured with:\n\nfor (k=0; ...) but in Fortran starting at 1.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nInitialize res =0 \n\nloop over each of the K pairs:\n\n    read input_pair \n\n    a=0; b=0 \n\n    for each character in main_str from 1 to n:\n\n        c = main_str(i:i)\n\n        if c == input_pair(1:1):\n\n            a +=1 \n\n        else if c == input_pair(2:2):\n\n            b +=1 \n\n        else: \n\n            res += min(a, b) \n\n            a=0 \n\n            b=0 \n\n    end do \n\n    res += min(a,b) \n\nend loop K \n\nSo in code:\n\nIn Fortran, functions are different. For strings, comparing characters is straightforward. The function MIN(a,b) for integers.\n\nBut in Fortran, the syntax will require variable declarations, with types. Let me plan the variables.\n\nDeclarations:\n\nprogram codeforces_154_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: max_main_length = 100000\n\ncharacter(len=max_main_length) :: main_str\n\ninteger :: N, K, res=0, a, b \n\ncharacter(len=2) :: input_pair\n\ninteger :: i, k\n\n... but need to loop over K pairs:\n\nWait, let me structure this:\n\nRead the main_str and get its length.\n\nN = len_trim(main_str)\n\nRead K.\n\nThen:\n\ndo k = 1, K\n\n    read(*,'(a2)') input_pair \n\n    a = 0 \n\n    b = 0 \n\n    do i = 1, N \n\n        character(1) :: c \n\n        c = main_str(i:i) \n\n        if (c == input_pair(1:1)) then \n\n            a = a +1 \n\n        else if (c == input_pair(2:2)) then \n\n            b = b +1 \n\n        else \n\n            res = res + min(a,b) \n\n            a=0 \n\n            b=0 \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    res = res + min(a,b) \n\nend do \n\nprint *, res \n\nWait, that's the structure. But I have to be careful with the data types. Let me check possible issues:\n\n1. Reading the first line:\n\nThe first read is the main string. Since the user may type it as a line, using:\n\nread(*,'(a)') main_str \n\nBut if the line is longer than max_main_length, it might be truncated. So the initial max_main_length better be large enough. For programming competition purposes, perhaps use 1e5 or similar, but in the Java code, they used .readLine() which reads the entire line. Assuming in fortran that the first line is not longer than the parameter. Alternatively, we can use an implicit-length read, but in Fortran versions that support it, perhaps with allocatable arrays. Wait, maybe it's safer to use an explicit length variable and read up to that. Let's proceed with fixed-length, which may be a possible issue but manageable here.\n\nOther points:\n\nIn Fortran, strings are characters with length specified. When accessing a character's substring, like main_str(i:i) gives the ith character as a string of length 1. Comparing two 1-character strings with == is okay.\n\nThe MIN function in Fortran for integers: can use min(a,b). \n\nAnother consideration: The original code in Java uses Math.min which is straightforward.\n\nWhat about the loops? The structure seems okay.\n\nWait: in the Java code, after the inner loop over i, there's an addition of min(a,b) after the loop. Then in the K-Loop, that's added again each time.\n\nSo that's correct in the Fortran code as well.\n\nPotential issue with the first read: The first read(*,'(a)') may read until end of line, but in FORTRAN list-directed input, if the variable is a character array, it may read until the end of the line, trimming spaces? Wait, maybe not. \n\nWait, in FORTRAN, when using list-directed input (the * format), reading a character string will stop at the first blank, unless the entire input line is read. But using '(a)' format specifier may read the entire line, but how?\n\nAlternatively, using '(a100000)' as the format, but that could be better. Since we know that the input line may be up to 1e5, perhaps using:\n\nread(*,'(a)') main_str \n\nBut in some Fortran versions, the '(a)' may read the entire line. Better to look it up. Alternatively, to read the entire line, perhaps use a read with '(a)'. The specifics may vary, but in F90 and later, the 'a' in the format will read until the end of the line, so that works.\n\nAnother possible problem is that the input_pair in FORTRAN is two characters. But the code reads each of the K lines as two characters with '(a2)'. So if the actual input line is exactly two characters, then it's okay. But if there's a longer input, perhaps it's an error. So depending on the problem statement, but since the Java code required that, it's okay.\n\nTesting the first part:\n\nmain_str is read as '(a)'.\n\nThen K is read with read(*,*), meaning list-directed.\n\nWait, the next line is K, so after the first read, the next 'read*, K' would read an integer. Since list-directed, reading from the next logical line. So that should work.\n\nNow, loops.\n\nIn FORTRAN, the loop variables are declared. The 'i' and 'k' variables need to be declared integers. The variable 'res', 'a', 'b' also need to be integers. The program variables:\n\nprogram codeforces_154_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: len_max = 100000\n\ncharacter(len=len_max) :: main_str\n\ninteger :: K, N, res\n\ninteger :: a, b \n\ncharacter(len=2) :: input_pair\n\ninteger :: i, k \n\n... \n\nread(*,'(a)') main_str\n\nN = len_trim(main_str)\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nres =0\n\ndo k = 1,K \n\n   ! Read the two characters as input_pair:\n\n   read(*,'(a2)') input_pair \n\n   a = 0 \n\n   b =0 \n\n   do i = 1,N \n\n      character(1) :: c \n\n      c = main_str(i:i) \n\n      ! Compare to input_pair's first and second characters \n\n      if (c == input_pair(1:1)) then \n\n         a = a + 1 \n\n      else if (c == input_pair(2:2)) then \n\n         b = b + 1 \n\n      else \n\n         res = res + min(a,b) \n\n         a =0 \n\n         b=0 \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   res = res + min(a,b) \n\nend do \n\nprint *, res \n\nend program\n\nWait, but in Fortran, the variables need to be declared. The character(1) declaration of 'c' inside the loop: no, in F90 you can declare variables inside a DO loop's body. But variables declared inside a loop have block scope. But some older compilers may not like that, but it's standard F90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe declare 'c' outside the loop, but since it's re-declared every loop, it's okay? Hmm, no. Alternatively, better declare 'c' as a character(1) variable in the declarations. Let me adjust:\n\ncharacter(len=1) :: c \n\ndeclared at the top.\n\nWait, let me restructure:\n\nprogram codeforces_154_A\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, parameter :: len_max = 100000\n\ncharacter(len=len_max) :: main_str\n\ninteger :: K, N, res\n\ninteger :: a, b \n\ncharacter(len=2) :: input_pair\n\ninteger :: i, k \n\ncharacter(len=1) :: c \n\nread(*, '(a)') main_str\n\nN = len_trim(main_str)\n\nread(*,*) K\n\nres = 0\n\ndo k = 1, K\n\n    read(*, '(a2)') input_pair\n\n    a = 0\n\n    b = 0\n\n    do i = 1, N\n\n        c = main_str(i:i)\n\n        if (c == input_pair(1:1)) then\n\n            a = a +1\n\n        else if (c == input_pair(2:2)) then\n\n            b = b +1\n\n        else\n\n            res = res + min(a, b)\n\n            a = 0 \n\n            b = 0 \n\n        end if \n\n    end do \n\n    res = res + min(a, b)\n\nend do \n\nprint *, res \n\nend program codeforces_154_A\n\nBut need to confirm about the reads. Let's test a sample input.\n\nSuppose first input line is \"abc\", then K is 1, and the next line is \"ab\".\n\nThen main_str would have \"abc\" (with N 3). Then pair is \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nLoop through each character of main_str:\n\ni=1 -> c is 'a' equals first char (a). a=1, b=0.\n\ni=2 -> c is 'b' equals second, so b=1.\n\ni=3 -> 'c'. \n\nElse clause: res += min(1,1) \u2192 +1, and a/b set to 0. Then the loop continues.\n\nWait no: when c is the third character, the current a and b values are a=1, b=1 (after first two characters). So on third char (c is 'c'), which is different from both 'a' and 'b', so we add min(1,1)=1 to res (res becomes 1). Then a and b reset.\n\nres += min(a=1, b=1) \u2192 yes. \n\nSo after handling the third character, a and b are zero. \n\nThen, after the loop (i=3), we have to add min(a,b) (0) again. So res becomes 1+0 \u2192 res is still 1 for the iteration.\n\nWait in the code after the inner loop over i, we do res += min(a,b). So after processing i from 1 to N, we add the min(a,b) once. So after the third character, the else clause had reset a and b to 0. Thus after the loop, min(0,0) \u2192 0. So total for this pair is 1. \n\nTesting that code would output 1.\n\nDoes the original Java code do the same?\n\nOriginal Java: \n\nFor each character in arr (indexes 0,1,2):\n\nFirst character 'a' \u2192 a=1, b still 0.\n\nSecond character 'b' \u2192 b=1. a=1, b=1.\n\nThird character 'c':\n\n In the else clause, adding the minimum (1,1)=1 to res. Then a and b become 0. \n\n So after processing third character, the next iteration (no, the loop stops at i=2 (in Java code, N is 3, so i goes up to 2 included?). Wait, in original Java, arr length is N=3. The loop runs i from 0 to 2 inclusive. The third (i= 2) is the 'c'. \n\n So in Java:\n\nAt i=2 (third character), it is 'c', which is not a or b. So:\n\nres increases by min(a=1, b=1 \u2192 1\u2192 res +=1 \u2192 that's the first addition. Then after the loop (which ends at i=2), adding the min of a and b which is now 0,0 \u2192 0. So for that pair, total 1. \n\nThus the FORTRAN code has that result. So the code seems correct.\n\nPotential problem: In Fortran, the loop for the k starts at 1, but that's okay.\n\nAnother possible issue is that in the FORTRAN code, the input_pair is read with 'a2' which reads two characters each time. But if the line has more characters, it would read the first two. For example, if the line is \"ab\\t\" or \"abxwhatever\", the first two characters are taken. If the problem requires that each input pair is exactly two characters on that line, then this is okay. The java code uses input.readLine(), which reads entire line, then calls charAt(0) and charAt(1). If the input line is longer than two characters, those are ignored (though they are not part of the compared pair). The FORTRAN code would read exactly 2 characters, ignoring any beyond as part of that read, so it's equivalent.\n\nNow, let me think about possible edge cases where the main_str has a variety of characters.\n\nAnother point: When processing the pair, if the entire main_str consists of only those two characters, then at the end, after the loop, min(a,b) is added. \n\nTesting that scenario.\n\nSuppose main_str is \"aabbbaaa\", and the pair is \"ab\".\n\nLet's see. \n\nProcessing each character:\n\na a a b b b a a a \n\nWait no, need exact counts. Let's suppose the main_str is \"ababab\", pair \"ab\".\n\nAt each step:\n\ni=1: 'a' \u2192 a=1\n\ni=2: 'b' \u2192 b=1\n\ni=3: 'a' \u2192 a=2, since the previous was b \u2192 no, step by step.\n\nWait let me track:\n\nAt iteration:\n\nInitial a=0, b=0.\n\ni=1: 'a' \u2192 a becomes 1.\n\ni=2: 'b' \u2192 b becomes 1.\n\ni=3: 'a' \u2192 increment a to 2 (since it's the first character of pair). So a is now 2, b is 1?\n\nYes. \n\ni=4: 'b' \u2192 b becomes 2. \n\ni=5: 'a' \u2192 a is now 3. \n\ni=6: 'b' \u2192 b is 3.\n\nLoop ends. After the loop, we add min(3,3)=3. \n\nTotal for the pair is 0 (since no characters caused resetting) + 3 \u2192 3? \n\nYes, in this case. \n\nThe Java code would have the same. \n\nOkay, the code seems to be correct.\n\nAnother consideration is that the FORTRAN READ with '(a2)' might consume trailing characters, requiring the next read to start at the next unread character. If the input lines have varying lengths, but each has exactly two characters (as per the problem), then it should be okay.\n\nTherefore, the final Fortran code should look like this."
