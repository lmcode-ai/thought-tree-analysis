    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. Oh right, the main method takes two integers n and m, reverses m using the reverse function, and then adds that reversed number to n, printing the result.\n\nFirst, let's look at the FastReader class. Java uses this to read input efficiently. In Fortran, I/O is handled a bit differently. Since for command-line input, in Fortran we can use read(*,*) statements. So maybe that's simpler here. The FastReader's methods like nextInt() would just translate into reading from standard input with appropriate formats.\n\nNow, the reverse function. Let me see how it works in Java. The reverse function takes an integer, reverses its digits. For example, if n is 123, then it becomes 321? Wait, but in the Java code, there's an if condition: if (n < 10) return n * 10. Hmm, that's a bit odd. So for a single-digit number, like 5, it returns 50? Because reversing would just be 5, but then multiplied by 10? Wait, that's probably a bug? Wait, looking at the problem, perhaps the problem itself expects that when you reverse a single-digit number you have two digits? Or maybe that's part of the problem's specification. For instance, if m is 5, then reverse(m) would be 50. So I have to preserve that logic in Fortran.\n\nWait the code in Java's reverse function says: if the number is less than 10 (so 1 digit), then return n multiplied by 10. So a single digit becomes two digits (but the same digit followed by zero). Wait, but let's see an example. Suppose m is 12. Then reverse(12) is 21. If m is 3, then reverse(3) is 30. Oh, so that's important. The reverse function, when given a one-digit number, returns it times 10. Maybe the problem requires that?\n\nOkay, so the main function adds n and the reversed m. So in Fortran, I need to read two integers, process the reversal of the second, then add to the first, and print the sum.\n\nNow, the FastReader class in Java is handling input efficiently. In Fortran, I can use the standard read (*,*) to read the variables directly. So the FastReader is not needed here. So in Fortran main program, the code can be straightforward.\n\nNow, translating the reverse function. Let's think about how to write the reverse function in Fortran. The function takes an integer, and returns an integer. Let's see the steps for the reverse function.\n\nFirst, if the number is less than 10, return n*10.\n\nElse, do the reversal.\n\nThe algorithm in the reverse function in Java is:\n\nr starts at 0.\n\nt is initialized to n.\n\nloop while t > 0:\n\nr = r * 10 + t mod 10 (mod here is mod in Fortran, but since in Fortran the mod function can handle negative numbers differently, but since here t is positive, as it's coming from t = t / 10 and the initial n, which is non-negative. So okay.\n\nthen t = t / 10 (integer division)\n\nSo the steps are the same.\n\nIn Fortran, the modulo can be done with mod(t,10), and t = t /10 (integer division). So yes.\n\nNow, in Fortran, functions have to be declared with function names and return types.\n\nSo let's outline the code structure.\n\nThe program would be:\n\nprogram prob\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, m, reversed_m, sum\n\nRead n and m from input:\n\nread(*,*) n, m\n\ncall reversed_m = reverse(m) \n\nWait in Fortran, functions are called with assignment, not via a call statement. So reversed_m = reverse(m). Then, sum = reversed_m + n. Then, print *, sum.\n\nThen, the reverse function. Let's think about the declaration. We need to write a function that takes an integer and returns an integer.\n\nsubroutine? No, a function. So:\n\ninteger function reverse(n)\n  integer, intent(in) :: n\n  integer :: r, t\n  if (n < 10) then\n    reverse = n*10\n    return\n  endif\n  t = n\n  r = 0\n  do while ( t > 0 )\n    r = r *10 + mod(t,10)\n    t = t /10\n  enddo\n  reverse = r\nend function reverse\n\nWait, but wait the function's return variable is reverse, which is the function's name. So in Fortran, the function's name is the return variable. Wait, so the code would set reverse = ... and then return.\n\nWait, also in the case when n is a two-digit number, like 30, then mod(30,10) is 0, so the code would reverse properly. Let's think about an example: m = 123, the loop would process 123, 12, 1, 0, so:\n\nInitial t is 123, r 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nr = 0 *10 +3 \u2192 3, t becomes 12.\n\nSecond iteration: r is 3*10 +2 \u2192 32, t 1.\n\nThird: 32*10 +1 \u2192 321. T becomes 0. So the reversed is 321.\n\nWhich is correct. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, for a single-digit number, like 5, n<10, so it returns 5*10=50, which is per the code.\n\nNow, in the case when n is 0, but wait since n here is an integer. Wait in the problem, does m have constraints? Well, in the Java code, it's just reversed as per the given function.\n\nNow, for Fortran code.\n\nWait, also note that Fortran is case-insensitive by default. So variable names may be written as all lowercase or uppercase, but in code the standard is to follow the style, but since the user may expect code in a certain way, maybe keep the function name as reverse.\n\nWait, for the function's declaration: in Fortran you can have a function with the same name as the variable. So for function reverse(n), the function's return value is stored in a variable named reverse. So that's okay.\n\nPutting everything together, the program would be:\n\nprogram codeforces_171_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, reversed_m\n    read(*,*) n, m\n    reversed_m = reverse(m)\n    print*, reversed_m + n\ncontains\n    integer function reverse(n)\n        integer, intent(in) :: n\n        integer :: r, t\n        if (n < 10) then\n            reverse = n * 10\n            return\n        endif\n        t = n\n        r = 0\n        do while(t > 0)\n            r = r * 10 + mod(t, 10)\n            t = t / 10\n        end do\n        reverse = r\n    end function reverse\nend program codeforces_171_A\n\nHmm, yes. Let me check if the 'contains' is correct here. The reverse function has to be inside the program, so we can use an internal function (if the compiler allows), or in Fortran 90 and above, you can use a module. But for simplicity, using an internal function should be okay.\n\nWait, in standard Fortran 90/95, you can have internal procedures inside the program. So the contains statement is needed after the variables declarations, before the function. Because, after the contains comes the internal procedures.\n\nWait in the code structure after the implicit none and variables, then the read and processing steps. The contains should come before the function definition. Let me rearrange:\n\nprogram codeforces_171_A\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, m, reversed_m\n    read(*,*) n, m\n    reversed_m = reverse(m)\n    print*, reversed_m + n\n\ncontains\n\n    integer function reverse(n)\n    ... function code ...\n    end function ...\n\nend program ...\n\nSo that's correct. So that code should work.\n\nWait but when testing, what if the input has, say, n and m on separate lines? No, in the Java code, they read n and m via sc.nextInt() twice, so they're on the same line.\n\nIn the read(*,*) n, m statement in Fortran, it expects them to be on the same line, separated by whitespace. That's correct.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput: 5 3 \u2192 reversed_m = 3*10 =30, total 5+30=35.\n\nAnother test case: m is 12 \u2192 reverse is 21 \u2192 21 +n whatever.\n\nAnother edge case: m is 0 \u2192 but perhaps the problem doesn't allow that. Suppose m is 0, reversed is 0 \u2192 but the code's function says, if n (which is 0 in this case) <10 \u2192 returns 0*10=0. Wait no, 0 is less than 10, so it returns 0, but multiplied by 10 \u2192 0. Because 0*10 is 0. So even if m is 0, then reversed_m is 0. So that's okay.\n\nAnother case: m is 9, reversed is 90 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, the code in Fortran should work.\n\nBut need to use mod correctly. Also, in Fortran, integer division discards fractional part, so t / 10 is okay.\n\nThis should be the correct translation. I need to make sure that all parts are covered. The FastReader is not needed because in Fortran, standard input is straightforward with read."
