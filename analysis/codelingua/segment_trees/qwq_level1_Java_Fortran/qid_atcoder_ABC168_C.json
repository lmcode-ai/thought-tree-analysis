Wait, let's see. Suppose the angle_deg is 270, then the minimal angle is 90 degrees ( since 270 > 180, 360-270=90). But cos(270 degrees) is cos(3*PI/2) which is 0. But cos(90) is also 0. So in this case it's okay. So using absolute difference works here because cos(theta) = cos(360 - theta), so it doesn't matter whether the actual angle is the small or large difference, as the formula uses cosine of the angle (which would be same as the small angle's cosine). Therefore the code is correct. Therefore the code seems okay. Testing edge cases:\n\nExample input: Let's say A=0 or B=0. But according to problem constraints, probably A and B are positive?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the Java code is doing. \n\nFirst, it reads four integers: A, B, H, M. Then, it calculates some angles related to clock hands, probably the angle between the hour and minute hands. Then uses those angles in some geometric formula involving A and B to compute the answer. The output is the square root of a value computed using those terms. \n\nHmm, looking at the variables, they use BigDecimal for precise calculations. But in Fortran, maybe using double precision variables would be sufficient? Let me check the operations.\n\nThe code first calculates mkaku as MM * 6 (since each minute is 6 degrees for the minute hand). Then hkaku is HH * 30 (each hour is 30 degrees) plus M/2 (since the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute). So the angle between them is the difference, then take absolute value, converted to radians?\n\nWait, then the angle is used in a formula involving A and B. The formula seems to be sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 - 2AB cos(theta)), which is the law of cosines. Oh right, so the problem is probably to compute the distance between the tips of the hour and minute hands, where A and B are the lengths of the hour and minute hands respectively?\n\nRight. So need to convert all that into Fortran.\n\nFirst, Fortran uses REAL variables for decimals. Since Java used BigDecimal but the operations here don't need arbitrary precision, using double precision in Fortran should be fine. \n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Read A, B, H, M. These are integers.\n2. Compute the angles:\n   - minute angle: 6 * M (since M here is the minutes)\n   - hour angle: 30*H + 0.5*M\n   - The difference angle in degrees, take absolute value, then convert to radians\n3. Compute the formula: sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 - 2*A*B*cos(angle)))\n\nWait the code in Java does:\n\nkaku is the difference between mkaku (minute angle) and hkaku (hour angle). Then dkaku is the absolute value as radians? Because Math.toRadians is called on kaku.doubleValue(). Wait, wait the code in Java does:\n\nkaku = mkaku - hkaku; \nthen dkaku = Math.abs( Math.toRadians(kaku.doubleValue()) )\n\nWait no, wait let me retrace:\n\nWait the Java code:\n\nmkaku = MM.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(6)); // which is M*6 (but MM is the input M as a BigDecimal)\n\nSimilarly, hkaku = HH * 30, then add M/2 (since the 2nd term is BigDecimal.valueOf( (double) M / 2 )\n\nSo the hour angle is H*30 + M/2 degrees. The minute angle is M*6 degrees. \n\nThen kaku is (minuteAngle - hourAngle), the angle between them is the absolute value of that, but in the code, it's taking Math.toRadians of the kaku's value. \n\nWait wait, the code first gets kaku as the difference, then takes its doubleValue, applies Math.toRadians to it? Wait no, the line is:\n\ndkaku = Math.abs( Math.toRadians( kaku.doubleValue() ) );\n\nWait, that would convert the angle (in degrees stored in kaku) into radians. So angle in degrees is kaku.doubleValue(), so to_rad converts it to radians. Wait but is that correct? Because the difference in degrees is converted to radians. So angle in degrees difference is (M*6 - H*30 - M/2). Wait, no, the formula for hour angle is H * 30 + M * 0.5, so the difference between that and minute angle is correct.\n\nWait, but then, the angle between the hands is the absolute value of (minute_angle - hour_angle). If that difference is more than 180 degrees, take 360 - difference, but the code here seems to take absolute and then, because when you take cos(angle), since cosine is periodic, cos(theta) = cos(-theta), and cos(360-theta) = cos(theta). Therefore, using the absolute value of the angle difference, and if it's over 180, it will automatically get the minimal angle's cosine, because cos(360 - theta) is same as cos(theta). So the code takes the absolute value but the angle between is taken as modulo 360. Since the code takes the absolute angle (kaku's absolute value) in degrees, which then converted into radians, but the actual angle between is the minimum. However, cosine is even, and if the angle is over 180 degrees, cos(that) would be equal to cos(360 - angle), which is same as cos(angle - 360) if negative. Wait, but in the code, they take Math.abs, so angle is in [0, 360). The actual minimal angle is min( angle, 360-angle ), but since cosine has cos(\u03c0 - \u03b8) = -cos\u03b8, etc. Wait, cos(180\u00b0 - \u03b8) is -cos(theta), but here we just take absolute value of the angle difference, then convert to radians.\n\nWait, but in any case, regardless of interpretation, the code converts the difference in degrees (with absolute) to radians for cosine.\n\nSo moving forward, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the steps in Fortran:\n\nUse variables A,B,H,M as integers. Then:\n\nread *, A,B,H,M\n\nCompute:\n\n- minute_angle = 6 * M \n- hour_angle = 30 * H + 0.5 * M \n- angle_deg = abs( minute_angle - hour_angle )\n- angle_rad = angle_deg * pi / 180.0 (since Java is converting to radians via Math.toRadians, which is exactly that radians = degrees * pi/180).\n\nThen compute the formula: sqrt( A^2 + B^2 - 2*A*B*cos(angle_rad) )\n\nIn Fortran code, we need to compute this. So variables:\n\nWe need to do all in double precision. Let's see:\n\nFirst, declare variables:\n\nINTEGER :: A, B, H, M\n\nREAL*8 :: ang_min, ang_h, angle_deg, angle_rad, ans2, ans\n\nThen:\n\nang_min = 6.0D0 * M\n\nang_h = 30.0D0 * H + 0.5D0 * M \n\nangle_deg = DABS( ang_min - ang_h )\n\nangle_rad = angle_deg * (4*ATAN(1D0)/180D0 )\n\nWait, 4*ATAN(1) is pi, so ATAN(1D0) = pi/4, so 4*ATAN(1D0) = pi. \n\nAlternatively, just use DTHETA = angle_deg * (pi/180D0)\n\nSo the cosine term is DCOS(angle_rad)\n\nThen compute:\n\nans2 = A**2 + B**2 - 2D0*A*B * DCOS(angle_rad)\n\nans = DSQRT( ans2 )\n\nThen print ans with enough decimal places.\n\nWait, but need to make sure of integer to real conversions. Since A and B are read as integers but used in calculations, we have to cast them to double precision.\n\nThus, in code, for A and B read as integers, when used in expressions like A**2, they'll automatically upconverted to real*8 because of the operators involved.\n\nNow, writing the code step by step:\n\nThe code structure:\n\nprogram name? Probably similar to the Java class name? But Fortran's main program is just PROGRAM something.\n\nSo let's name it something like main or as the Java class, but in Fortran, the filename would be .f90 or similar. \n\nThe steps:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc168_c\n\nimplicit none ! Required for variable declarations\n\ninteger :: A, B, H, M\n\nreal*8 :: ang_min, ang_h, angle_deg, angle_rad\n\nreal*8 :: ans2, ans\n\n! Read inputs\n\nread*, A, B, H, M\n\nang_min = 6.0d0 * dble(M)\n\nang_h = 30.0d0 * dble(H) + 0.5d0 * dble(M)\n\nangle_deg = dabs( ang_min - ang_h )\n\nangle_rad = angle_deg * (4.0d0 * datan(1.0d0) / 180.0d0 )\n\nans2 = (A*A) + (B*B) - 2.0d0 * A * B * dcos(angle_rad)\n\nans = dsqrt(ans2)\n\nprint*, ans\n\nend program\n\nWait, but wait need to check for possible mistakes. \n\nWait the angle between is angle_deg which is |minute_angle - hour_angle|. Since angle_deg can be more than 180, but cosine is the same for angle and 360-angle, since cos(theta)=cos(-theta)=cos(360-theta). Therefore taking the absolute difference is okay. \n\nWait, because angle_rad could be 270 degrees (in radians), but cos(270) is zero. Whereas the minimal angle is 90 degrees, but in that case the actual angle should be 90? Wait, let's see.\n\nSuppose the angle_deg is 270, then the minimal angle is 90 degrees ( since 270 > 180, 360-270=90). But cos(270 degrees) is cos(3*PI/2) which is 0. But cos(90) is also 0. So in this case it's okay. So using absolute difference works here because cos(theta) = cos(360 - theta), so it doesn't matter whether the actual angle is the small or large difference, as the formula uses cosine of the angle (which would be same as the small angle's cosine). Therefore the code is correct.\n\nTherefore the code seems okay.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nExample input: Let's say A=0 or B=0. But according to problem constraints, probably A and B are positive? The code would handle it mathematically, but the problem might assume that. \n\nNow in Fortran code, the lines:\n\nang_h = 30.0d0 * H + ... Wait, in the code above, H and M are integers, so when multiplied by 30.D0 which is double, the H is automatically converted to real*8. \n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nSuppose H is integer, then 30.0d0 * H will be H's value converted to double.\n\nYes. \n\nThus the code is okay. \n\nNow, the printing: The print statement should output the answer with sufficient precision. Since in Java, it just prints the double, which usually gives several decimal digits, so in Fortran, using print*, ans will work. \n\nWait the problem's expected output may need more precise decimals? Well, the original code uses BigDecimal, but in this calculation, since double precision is more than enough for angles (since the formula's cosine calculation uses radians). So I think it's okay.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWait in the angle difference, the code uses \"dabs( ang_min - ang_h )\", which is correct.\n\nWait in Java's code, when calculating hkaku (hour_angle), the code is:\n\nhkaku = HK.multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(30)). Then adds BigDecimal.valueOf( (double) M / 2 ). So it's exactly 30 * H + M / 2. \n\nIn the Fortran code, that's correct because 30.0D0 * H + 0.5d0 * M. \n\nYes. \n\nTesting another example:\n\nSuppose H=0, M=0. Then hour angle is 0, minute angle 0, angle_diff is zero. the formula becomes sqrt(A^2 + B^2 - 2AB*1 ) = sqrt( (A-B)^2 ), so |A-B|. \n\nIf A=3 and B=4, then 3-4 = -1, absolute 1. Outputs 1. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: At 12:00, the angle is 0. \n\nAt 3:00, hour at 90 degrees. Minute at 0. Difference is 90. The formula would compute distance between two hands of length 0? Wait if A is the hour length, B the minute?\n\nWait in any case, the code seems correct. \n\nThus, translating the code. \n\nWait the Java code's angle difference was kaku = mkaku - hkaku (minute_angle - hour_angle), then absolute. The Fortran code does the same.\n\nThus the code is okay. \n\nTherefore the Fortran code should be as written above, but let me double check the formula:\n\nFormula is A squared plus B squared minus 2AB cos(angle), all under square root. Yes.\n\nYes, code has:\n\nans2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2AB * cos(angle_rad)\n\nThus the code is correct. \n\nNow, writing this code according to Fortran's conventions. \n\nI'll present the code accordingly."
