If N is, say, 8: \n\nSo 8 = 5*1 +3 \u2192 R=3.\n\nsince 3>2, then the first condition met. then compute:\n\nThe first formula:\n\nA*k + R (where R=3) \u2192 2*1 +3 =5.\n\nsubtract (N - ( (k*(A+B)+A ) ) N is 8, k*(5)+A is 5+2=7 \u2192 8-7=1. So 5 -1 \u21924? Wait what's the actual value? Hmm. But according to prior analysis, that should be A*(k+1) \u2192 2*2=4. So that's correct. Thus, the formula is correct. So the code works. Another example: N=6, A=3, B=1 \u2192 A+B=4. Since 4 <=6, yes. k=6/4 =1. R=2. R=2 <3 \u2192 A*k+ (2) =3+2=5. Thus, correct. So I think the code is correct as per the translation.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe code reads three long integers N, A, B from input. The problem is to compute some value k and then print the result based on certain conditions. \n\nFirst, there are some condition checks using if statements. The first part checks if N is between 1 and 1e18, A and B are non-negative, and their sum is positive but <=1e18. If all that holds, the code proceeds. \n\nNext, the code checks if the sum of A and B is less than or equal to N. If so, it calculates k as integer division of N by (A+B). Then there's an inner if-else: if the remainder (N - k*(A+B)) is greater than A, the output is A*k + (remainder - (remainder - A)). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me recalculate. Wait, the first part: remainder is (N -...). Let's call remainder R. \n\nIn the else clause of that, the code prints A*k + R. Wait but in the first case when R is larger than A, the code does A*k + (R) minus (R - A) maybe? Let's see: (N - ...) is R, so (R - (N - k*(A+B)+A))? Wait, maybe I need to parse that expression again. \n\nWait the first part: System.out.println(A * k + (N - k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)));\n\nBreaking that down: \n\nThe subtracted term is (N - (k*(A+B)+ A)). So the total would be [A*k + R] minus [N - (k*(A+B)+A)].\n\nWait that looks complicated. Wait maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simplification here. Let's think algebraically.\n\nLet me substitute R = N - k*(A+B). Then the expression becomes: \n\nA*k + R - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) \n\nWhich simplifies:\n\nA*k + (R) - (N - k*(A+B) - A) \n\nBut R = N -k*(A+B), so substitute that into the first part: \n\nA*k + (N -k(A+B)) - [N - (k(A+B) + A) ]\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe second term inside the brackets is N minus [k(A+B)+A] \n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\nA*k + N -k(A+B) - N + (k(A+B) + A)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nThe N cancels, the -k(A+B) and +k(A+B) cancel, so we're left with A*k + (A). \n\nWait that's interesting. So A*k + R gives A*k + (R), which would be A*k + R = A*k + (N - k(A+B)). That would be A*k + N -kA - kB \u2192 N - kB. \n\nWait but in the first case when R > A, then the final result is A*k + R - (something). Wait but the code's expression simplifies to A*k + R minus ( N - (k(A+B)+A)). But perhaps the code has a typo or perhaps I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first line's print statement is A *k + (R) minus ( ... ) \u2192 but perhaps the code has a miscalculation here? Or perhaps it's intended. Hmm. Maybe I need to just transcribe it as written. \n\nAnyway, in any case, the code has three main cases: \n\nCase 1: A+B <= N: compute k = N/(A+B), then:\n\nR = N mod (A+B) \n\nif R > A, then output is A*k + (R - (N - ... ?)) \u2192 but according to previous simplification, it's A*k + R - (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) which simplifies to A*(k+1). \n\nWait let me compute that term again. Let me use substituting R. \n\nThe term is:\n\n(A*k + R) - (N - (k*(A+B) +A))\n\nBut R is N - k*(A+B), so substituting R:\n\nA*k + (N -k(A+B)) - [ N - (k(A+B) + A) ]\n\nInside the brackets, N minus (k(A+B)+A) equals N -kA - kB -A.\n\nSo the entire expression:\n\nA k + N -k(A+B) - [ N - (kA + kB + A) ]\n\nThe terms inside the subtraction: N - kA - kB -A \n\nSo subtract that term, so:\n\nA k + N -kA - kB - (N -kA - kB - A) \n\nWait that's:\n\nA k + (N -k(A+B)) - ( N -k(A+B + A/(something? No, wait miscalculation. Let me recompute step by step.\n\nTotal expression:\n\nExpression1 = A*k + R \u2192 R is the remainder.\n\nExpression2 = N - (k*(A+B) + A)\n\nThen the total becomes Expression1 - Expression2 \u2192 but wait in the code's first print line, it's printing:\n\nExpression1 minus Expression2, so:\n\n(A*k + R) - [expression2]\n\nBut substituting:\n\nExpression2 = N - (k*(A+B) + A )\n\nR is N -k*(A+B). So:\n\nexpression2 = N - (k*(A+B)+A) = (N -k*(A+B)) ) - A = R - A\n\nSo then:\n\nExpression1 - Expression2 = [A*k + R] - (R - A) \u2192 A*k + R - R +A = A(k+1).\n\nSo the print in that situation becomes A*(k+1). Because R must be greater than A, so R -A is positive? Wait if R > A, then making this term. \n\nAlternatively, the calculation for R being greater than A leads to total being A*(k+1), because imagine the full cycle A steps in one direction. \n\nSo the code's first case when R> A, which would be that in the remainder, the total is A + 1 full cycles. \n\nWait this is perhaps due to the problem statement which I might not have. Maybe the problem is about Seimei Cities or a specific competition problem. Like, where A is the up and B is the down, each day. The problem might be that each cycle of A+B days adds A to the total? Not sure, but maybe the code is for a particular problem like that. \n\nAnyway, focusing on the code translation.\n\nThe first step is the input. \n\nJava reads N, then A, then B from a Scanner. \n\nFortran reads from standard input, so I'll need to read them using read(*,*) statements. But in Fortran, variables must be declared. \n\nThe variables N, A, B, and k (k is a long in Java, so in Fortran, using 64-bit integers. \n\nFortran has kinds for integers. Probably using integer(8) for all since they can be up to 1e18, which is 64 bits. \n\nWait in Java, long is 64 bits. For Fortran, we have to use INTEGER*(8) or with kind parameter. \n\nSo first, in the program, I should declare variables. Let's see. So the code would be structured as a Fortran program.\n\nNow, the IF conditions: \n\nThe first IF checks the conditions 1 <= N <=1e18, and 0<=A, 0<=B and A+B>0 and A+B <= 1e18. \n\nIn Fortran, the Math.pow(10,18) is 1e18. Since in Fortran, integer can't have exponents like that, so the condition would use 10_8**18, but since Fortran is static, maybe 1e18 would be 1000000000000000000 but written as integer(8). Wait but 1e18 is too big to fit in an integer, but in Fortran, using 8-byte integers. The max for 64-bit integer is 2^63-1 ~ 9e18, so 1e18 is okay. \n\nWait in Fortran literal 1000000000000000000 is 10^18, which is 1e18. But writing that as a constant could be done as 1000000000000000000_8 (if using kind=8), or maybe the compiler can handle that. Alternatively, define a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, compute 10**18 as a constant. Wait for exponentiation, the ** operator exists. However, 10.0**18.0 would be a real number, which we can cast to integer. But better to compute as (10_8)**18. \n\nYes, in Fortran, (10_8)**18 would be integer*8.\n\nSo the conditions:\n\nFirst if block:\n\nif ( (1 <= N .and. N <= (10_8**18)) .and. (A >=0) .and. (B >=0) .and. (A+B >0) .and. ((A+B) <= (10_8**18)) ) then \n\nWait but the Java checks on A and B is \"0 <= A\" and same for B. \n\nOK. \n\nNow the next part is: \n\nIf A+B <=N:\n\nCompute k = N/(A+B) \u2192 integer division.\n\nIn Fortran, the integer division is done with / when integers are involved, but when dividing two integers, it truncates towards zero. But in this case, since A+B and N are positive, division is okay. \n\nSo k = N/(A+B).\n\nThen compute R = N -k*(A+B).\n\nThen:\n\nif (R > A ) : \n\nthen the expression is formula as in Java's first print statement.\n\nBut as per my earlier analysis, this simplifies to A*(k+1) ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe to be safe, just transcribe the code exactly, so in fortran, the code would write that formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code for the first print is: \n\nwrite(*,*) (A*k + (N - k*(A+B))) - ( N - (k*(A+B)+A) )\n\nWait let's see what that is:\n\nThe first part (A*k + R) \u2192 A*k + (N - k*(A+B))\n\nThen subtract \n\n(N - (k*(A+B)+A )) \u2192 which is (N -k*(A+B) -A) \u2192 R - A.\n\nSo the total becomes (A*k + R) - (R - A) \u2192 A*k + R - R + A \u2192 A*k + A \u2192 A*(k+1)\n\nTherefore, maybe in the first case when R >A, the result is A*(k+1), which is shorter to write. \n\nHmm, but perhaps the original code's first case was written that way, perhaps because when the remainder is beyond A's contribution, then the total is k full cycles (each giving A, because after each A+B days, the total is +A over the cycle) plus the A portion in the remaining steps. So when R >A, the remaining R days would have A added (since the extra is in the A part? Like, each cycle goes A steps then B steps backwards. So after k cycles (A+B)*(k) steps, up to position A*k, then in the next R steps (R \u2264 A+B), since there are R steps:\n\nif R <=A \u2192 total is A*k + R \u2192 because those R days all add.\n\nif R >A, then after A days you've added A to reach A*(k+1), but then for the next (R - A) days you go down, but since the problem might ask for the maximum distance reached up to day N, which maybe this code is about? Because in such problems, you might reach maximum in the days before going down again. \n\nSo, for example, if after a cycle of A+B days, you start again, so that for R steps beyond the cycles, the first step after the cycle is step A+1, etc.\n\nBut regardless, the code's logic is written as:\n\nif R >A, then the output is (A*k + R) minus (N - (k*(A+B)+A))?\n\nWait, perhaps that is being used to compute the maximum value during that partial cycle. Like the expression subtracts the overstepping part. \n\nAlternatively, that's the code's way to compute it. So the code has:\n\nIn case where A+B <=N: \n\ncompute k = N/(A+B).\n\nR = mod(N, A+B) \u2192 N modulo (A+B).\n\nThen, if R >A, the value is (A*k + R) minus (N - (k*(A+B)+A)) ) ?\n\nWait, but I think it's better to just translate the expressions exactly as in the code.\n\nBecause when transcribing a code, even if the code might have a simplification, the task is to translate it as is, unless the user says to optimize. \n\nThus, for the first case:\n\nThe code does this:\n\nif (R> A):\n\n   output A*k + (N -k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B) +A  ))\n\nElse:\n\n   output A*k + (N -k*(A+B))\n\nSo the first part simplifies to (A*k + R) - ( ... ), where ... is N - (k*(A+B)+A). \n\nBreaking down, yes:\n\nA*k + (N -k(A+B)) \u2192 A*k + R\n\nSubtract ( N - ( (k*(A+B))+ A )) \u2192 subtract (terms). \n\nSo the first term is A*k + R minus ( N - (k(A+B) +A) )\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n(Ak + R ) - ( N - k(A+B) - A )\n\nThe N here is N. Wait, substituting R = N -k(A+B):\n\nThe term inside the subtracted part:\n\nN - k(A+B) - A \u2192 (R) -A \n\nSo overall:\n\nAk + R - (R - A) \u2192 A*k + R -R +A \u2192 A(k +1 )\n\nSo the code's first case's first option is A*(k+1). \n\nThe second case is when R <= A \u2192 A*k + R.\n\nIndeed. So perhaps the code can be simplified, but since I need to translate the code as given, I need to write exactly what it has. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nFirst, compute R. \n\nR = mod( N, A+B ) \u2192 assuming that is how mod works in Fortran. Wait in Fortran, mod(n, m) returns n - m*(floor(n/m)). Since all variables are positive, this should work. \n\nAlternatively, R = N - (A+B)*k. So in code, R = N - (A+B)*k\n\nThen, if R > A, then:\n\nprint the expression:\n\n (A *k + (N - k*(A+B))) \u2192 this becomes A*k + R \n\nthen subtract (N - (k*(A+B)+A) )\n\nWait the code is doing \n\n (A*k + (N -k*(A+B) )) - ( N - (k*(A+B)+A) )\n\nWhich in Fortran is written:\n\nA*k + (N - k*(A+B)) - (N - (k*(A+B)+A))\n\nSo that's the exact computation. \n\nNow the next part,Else if (A+B >N and A <=N). So in this case, can we have N being less than A+B? If so, but A is <= N. Then, the output is A. So it's the minimum between... maybe in that case the total after N days is A, because you have A is less than or equal to N, so you can do A steps, but then adding the next? Hmm, perhaps in that scenario, after A days, you've gone up A, and then the next (N -A) days you come down B? Not sure, but code says to output A.\n\nElse, if neither of the above, output N?\n\nWait the code has an else case:\n\nElse if (A+B>N and A<=N) \u2192 print A \n\nElse \u2192 output N.\n\nWait, the code's second condition is (A+B>N && A <= N). So when A+B exceeds N, but A is less than or equal to N, then the output is A. But if A is greater than N, then it does the else? Which would be the third option, N.\n\nWait example: N=5, A=6, then since A> N, so the third condition would be triggered, so output N (5). But if A + B exceeds N and A<= N, like N=5, A=3, B=4 \u2192 A+B=7>5. Then output A=3?\n\nHmm. \n\nSo the code proceeds:\n\nThe first main condition is if A+B <= N \u2192 do the first calculation. \n\nElse if A+B >N and A <= N \u2192 print A. \n\nElse \u2192 print N. \n\nSo the third case is when A+B>N and A>N. but in that case, maybe N is the available days, so the total reaches N? Or perhaps when A is more than N, you can only go up N days, so the total is N?\n\nThus, when A>N, the output is N, even if A is bigger, since you can't go beyond N days. \n\nTherefore, these are the cases. \n\nNow, translating to Fortran.\n\nSo the code needs variables N, A, B, k as integers (kind=8). \n\nFirst, the declarations:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC158_B\n\n    implicit none\n\n    integer(8) :: N, A, B, k, R\n\n    read(*,*) N\n\n    read(*,*) A \n\n    read(*,*) B \n\n    (Then the conditions and calculations)\n\nWait the first condition: \n\nif ( (1 <= N) .and. (N <= 10_8**18) .and. &\n\n     (A >=0) .and. (B >=0) .and. & \n\n     ( (A + B) > 0 ) .and. & \n\n     ( (A + B) <= 10_8**18 ) ) then \n\n    ... \n\nElse \n\n   print something ?\n\nWait in the original Java code, if these conditions are not met, does it skip? Or just does nothing?\n\nIn Java, the code doesn't process any output if any condition fails. Because the entire code is inside that if clause. So in the Fortran code, we can structure similarly. \n\nThus, the code must check those conditions. \n\nNow, proceeding inside the if block:\n\nif ( A + B <= N ) then \n\n    compute k = N/(A+B)\n\n    (in Fortran, division is / operator. But does 8 byte integers handle that?\n\nYes. \n\n  k = N / (A+B)\n\n  R = N - k*(A+B)\n\n  if (R > A ) then \n\n    write(*,*) A*k + (R) - ( N - (k*(A+B)+A) )\n\n  else \n\n    write(*,*) A*k + R \n\n  end if \n\nelse if ( (A+B > N ) .and. (A <= N) ) then \n\n   write(*,*) A \n\nelse \n\n   write(*,*) N \n\nend if \n\nWait that would be the structure. \n\nWait but in Fortran, the else if and else is structured with end if:\n\nthe main condition is dividing into three cases:\n\nFirst, when A+B <=N:\n\nthen handle the first part.\n\nElse, check if (A+B > N) and (A <= N), then second case.\n\nElse (since neither of the first two conditions, so A > N ), then output N. \n\nYes.\n\nNow, the first part's R calculation with remainder. \n\nWait in the Fortran code, R is calculated as mod(N, A+B) ?\n\nAlternatively, the code uses N - k*(A+B). Which for integer division in Fortran (since k = N/(A+B), and since the variables are positive, mod is correct. But in case of division in Fortran: if N is divisible by A+B, mod is zero. \n\nWait the code uses R = N -k*(A+B). For example, if N = 10, A+B = 3, then A+B=3, so k = 10/3=3 (integer division 3*3=9, so R=1). So that's correct. \n\nSo R is correctly computed as N-k*(A+B).\n\nHence, the R calculation is okay.\n\nSo the code is executable? Almost. \n\nNow, edge cases: \n\nIn Java, using long variables. In Fortran, making sure that A+B can be represented as 8-byte integers. The constants 1e18 are handled via 10**18 with integer precision. \n\nWait 10_8**18 would give 1e18 as an 8-byte integer. So the code must have the exponentiation evaluated correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use a parameter:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: max_val = 1000000000000000000_8 \n\nThis way you can directly use max_val. \n\nSo in the code:\n\ninteger(8) :: N, A, B, k, R \n\ninteger(8), parameter :: upper = 10_8**18 \n\nWait but actually, writing 1000000000000000000_8 is safer?\n\nAlternatively, the problem may be in some cases where A+B exceeds a value that cannot be stored in 8 bytes, but according to the problem constraints, it's allowed, so the variables are 8-byte.\n\nAlternatively, writing literals in Fortran for the maximum values:\n\nSince 1e18 is 10^18, which is 1 followed by 18 zeros. So the literal is 1000000000000000000. To represent this as an integer(8), in Fortran code, perhaps:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: max_pow = 10**18\n\nBut need to cast to 8-byte:\n\nWait in Fortran 10**18 is 1e18. However, with integers:\n\n10_8 ** 18 would be better, but Fortran is not as flexible as Java with exponents.\n\nWait to compute 10^18:\n\nmax_val = 1E18? No, that's real. As an integer:\n\nmax_val = 1000000000000000000_8 \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the code can have parameter declarations:\n\ninteger(8), parameter :: check_max = 1000000000000000000_8 \n\nThen the first condition is:\n\nif ( ( N >= 1 ) .and. ( N <= check_max ) .and. & \n\n     ( A >=0 ) .and. ( B >=0 ) .and. & \n\n     ( (A + B) >0 ) .and. & \n\n     ( (A+B) <= check_max ) ) then \n\nThis way, instead of recomputing 10^18 each time, uses a parameter. \n\nThis could make code clearer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps even better. \n\nBut in any case, the code can be written with the 1000000000000000000_8 written out in full as we know. \n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow testing some edge cases. For example:\n\nCase where N = 5, A=2, B=3:\n\nThen A+B =5. So since N equals A+B, so k = 1 \u2192 N/(2+3)=1. \n\nRemainder R=0. Since R is not greater than A, 0 is not >2, so output A*k + R \u2192 2*1 +0 = 2. \n\nBut maybe the problem expected something else? Not sure, but following code's logic.\n\nAnother case: suppose N=6, A=2, B=3. Then A+B=5.\n\n6 div 5 is 1 \u2192 k=1. R=1.\n\nR is 1 < 2 \u2192 so output 2+1 = 3.\n\nAlternatively, if R=3 (like N= (5*1 +3)), then 3>2 \u2192 so 2*1 + (3) would give 5, but then subtract (N - (5+2) ), which would be 6 -7 \u2192 -1 \u2192 so the expression would be 5 - ( -1?) \u2192 hmm wait let me compute this.\n\nWait in that example:\n\nN=5+3 =8? Wait maybe another example. Let me pick N= (5*2) =10. A=2, B=3 \u2192 A+B=5. \n\nIf N is, say, 8: \n\nSo 8 = 5*1 +3 \u2192 R=3.\n\nsince 3>2, then the first condition met. then compute:\n\nThe first formula:\n\nA*k + R (where R=3) \u2192 2*1 +3 =5.\n\nsubtract (N - ( (k*(A+B)+A ) )\n\nN is 8, k*(5)+A is 5+2=7 \u2192 8-7=1. So 5 -1 \u21924?\n\nWait what's the actual value? \n\nHmm. But according to prior analysis, that should be A*(k+1) \u2192 2*2=4. So that's correct. \n\nThus, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother example: N=6, A=3, B=1 \u2192 A+B=4. \n\nSince 4 <=6, yes. \n\nk=6/4 =1. R=2. R=2 <3 \u2192 A*k+ (2) =3+2=5.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nSo I think the code is correct as per the translation.\n\nNow implementing in Fortran:\n\nProgram code.\n\nFirst, declaration of variables and parameters.\n\nThen read N, A, B. \n\nCheck conditions. \n\nProceed accordingly. \n\nSo the full Fortran code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC158_B\n\n    implicit none\n    integer(8) :: N, A, B, k, R\n    integer(8), parameter :: max_val = 1000000000000000000_8\n\n    read(*,*) N\n    read(*,*) A\n    read(*,*) B\n\n    if ( (1 <= N) .and. (N <= max_val) .and. &\n         (A >= 0) .and. (B >= 0) .and. &\n         ( (A + B) > 0 ) .and. &\n         ( (A + B) <= max_val ) ) then\n\n        if ( (A + B) <= N ) then\n            k = N/(A + B)\n            R = N - k*(A + B)\n            if ( R > A ) then\n                write(*,*) (A*k + R) - (N - ( k*(A + B) + A ) )\n            else\n                write(*,*) A*k + R\n            end if\n\n        else if ( (A + B > N) .and. (A <= N) ) then\n            write(*,*) A\n        else\n            write(*,*) N\n        end if\n\n    end if\n\nend program atcoder_ABC158_B\n\nWait check the order of conditions in the else if.\n\nOriginal code's second condition is:\n\n Else if ( (A+B>N) && A <=N )\n\nThe Fortran code has that in the else if. \n\nNow check when A+B>N and A> N. So the else clause runs, outputs N. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nNow, in the first condition's case (A+B <= N ), the code proceeds as above. \n\nYes. The expression (A*k + R) - (N - (... )) has the correct bracketing.\n\nWait the code has:\n\nFor the first condition met (R> A), the formula written is correct. \n\nAnother thing: the max_val is 1e18.\n\nBut need to ensure that the code compiles. \n\nIn Fortran, to represent 1e18 as an integer(8), the parameter is set correctly.\n\nBut when using the written out 1000000000000000000_8, which is safe. \n\nTesting for correct conditions.\n\nEdge cases like A=0 or B=0? E.g., if B is zero and A is non-zero. Then A+B is >=0, but since A + B>0 is required, so if B is zero, A can have value 0 as long as their sum is positive. \n\nBut the code checks that A and B are both >=0, and their sum is positive. \n\nLike when A=1 and B=0 \u2192 sum is 1>0 is okay.\n\nYes. \n\nThus, this code should do the same as the Java code."
