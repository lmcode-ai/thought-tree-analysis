Correcting: do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do \n\nNext, the lines for temp_s:\n\n    allocate( character(len=n) :: temp_s )\n\nBut in Fortran, variable length declaration must be explicit. However, in recent versions using allocatable character variables. \n\nAlternatively, use:\n\n    temp_s = ' ' But since n is the length, that won't work. Alternatively, use:\n\n    character(len=n) :: temp_s\n\nBut then the allocate isn't needed? Wait in that case:\n\n    read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nthen the do loop. Wait no, the temp_s must be declared with length n, but since n is not known till runtime, we need to declare it as allocatable. Wait in Fortran 2003, we can use deferred length. Like:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: temp_s\n\nAllocate it as len=n. Yes, so then:\n\n    allocate( character(len = n) :: temp_s )\n\nThen read the entire string into it with read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nWait in that case, yes. Wait in Fortran, when you have a deferred length allocatable character variable, you can allocate it with a specific length. So perhaps that's the correct way. So modifying:\n\n    ! Read the string s into a temporary string, then split into individual characters\n    allocate( character(len = n) :: temp_s )\n    read(*, '(a)') temp_s do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do\n    deallocate(temp_s) That should work.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, first I should understand what the Java code is doing. Let me read through it.\n\nThe Java program reads an integer n, then an array of n integers, and a string s. Then it calculates a sum by adding elements of the array where the corresponding character in s is 'B'. Then it does some more processing with 'A's and 'B's to find the maximum possible sum. \n\nWait, let me go step by step. The first part: sum is initialized as the sum of all a[i] where s's character at i is 'B'. Then, they have two loops: one going forward and another backward. In each loop, they adjust the sum by adding or subtracting a[i] based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B', tracking the maximum ans along the way.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's start with variables. Java uses public class, but in Fortran, it's a program. The main method becomes the program's entry point. \n\nFortran uses modules for input, so we'll need a way to read input. The Scanner in Java is replaced with read statements. \n\nWait, the variables: n is an integer, the array a has n elements. The string s is a character array in Fortran. Let's see:\n\nFirst, declare variables. Let me think about the structure.\n\nMain program steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n integers into array a.\n3. Read the string s (as a character array of length n? Because the string's length in the Java should be n since the loop is for i < n in the first part? Wait, looking back at the Java code. \n\nWait in Java, for (int i=0; i <n, read a[i], then s is next(). So the s's length is read as next token. The code's for loop for the first sum is i < s.length()? Oh right. Wait, but the problem might assume that the string s has exactly n characters. Because the first loop for a[i] is from 0 ton. So perhaps the input ensures that s has n characters. Let me check:\n\nThe code uses for (int i =0; i <n; i++) reads a[i] so the array a has exactly n elements. Then s is read as next(), which could be a string of any length but in the problem's context, it's probably n characters. Because the subsequent loops over s's characters go up to i < s.length(), so sum is calculated over all characters of s. So the fortran needs to read a string of length n. So in Fortran, we can read a character array of size n.\n\nWait, in Fortran, strings are arrays of characters. To read the string correctly, perhaps we need to read each character as a character array. So first, read s as a character array of length n.\n\nSo variables:\n\ninteger :: n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\ncharacter(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s\ninteger :: sum, sum1, ans\n\nWait, but in Java, the sums are long, so in Fortran, we need to use integers or integers with larger size. Assuming the problem constraints, maybe 4 bytes is enough, but perhaps the Fortran variables need to be integers. Alternatively, in case the sums could be large, perhaps use 8 byte integers, but maybe the problem allows with regular integers. Well, in fortran, default integers are 4 bytes, but if needed, we can use 'integer*8' or 'integer(kind=8)', but perhaps sticking with default unless issues arise.\n\nWait, the Java code uses \"long\", so in Fortran we should use integers also sufficient for large numbers. Let me see.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nprogram codeforces_632_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer, allocatable :: a(:)\n    character(len=1), allocatable :: s(:)\n    integer :: sum, sum1, ans\n    ! Read n\n    read(*,*) n\n    ! Allocate arrays\n    allocate(a(n), s(n))\n    ! Read the array a\n    do i=1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n    end do\n    ! Read the string s as a array of characters. But how?\n    ! Since input might be a string, perhaps using a character variable of length n to read it, then splitting into s array.\n    character(len=n) :: temp_s\n    read(*,*) temp_s\n    do i=1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do\n\nWait, yes. Because in Fortran, to read a string, you can read into a character variable of length n. Then extract each character into the array s.\n\nSo temp_s is a string of length n. Then each s(i) is the i-th character of temp_s.\n\nThen calculating the first sum. In Java:\n\nsum is initialized as 0. Then for each i from 0 to s.length()-1, if s[i] == 'B', add a[i].\n\nWait in Fortran, arrays are 1-based. So in Java, a has 0-based indexes from 0 to n-1. In Fortran, the array starts at 1. So when translating, indices start at 1. So need to adjust all loops.\n\nFirst:\n\nsum =0\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\nif (s(i) == 'B') sum = sum + a(i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, in Java's first loop, for (int i =0; i < n; i++) reads the a's. Then the first sum loop is over s's characters (i from 0 to s.length() -1). Since in Fortran, it's the same as loop 1 to n, so the index should be okay.\n\nYes, since in the input part, s has n characters, so the loop 1 to n includes all characters.\n\nThen, the ans is assigned to sum.\n\nThen sum1 is assigned to sum, same variable.\n\nThen the first loop for the forward direction:\n\nsum1 starts as sum. Then for each i from 1 to n, if s(i) is 'A' then add a(i) to sum1, else subtract a(i). Wait, in Java code: \n\nfor the loops:\n\nIn the forward pass:\nfor (int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n    if (s.charAt(i) == 'A') sum1 += a[i] \n    else sum1 -= a[i] \n    ans = max(...)\n\nWait in Java's 'else' here is 'B' case. So in Fortran, for each step, if s(i) is 'A' add, else subtract (since else would be 'B' as per the problem? Because all characters are either A or B, given the problem context.)\n\nSo code translation:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (s(i) == 'A') then \n        sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n    else\n        sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n    end if\n    if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\nend do\n\nWait, but wait: wait the loop in Java adds a[i] when it's 'A', but the initial sum1 was sum (which is the sum of B's in the initial sum). So original sum is the initial B's contribution. Now for the forward loop:\n\nThe process is modifying sum1 as follows: the first step would be when starting from the sum (sumB = original sum). Then, for each character from start to i, we change the contribution of the previous sum. Wait perhaps the explanation isn't needed, but code-wise, the translation needs the indices right.\n\nWait the first loop (the forward one) starts with sum1 = sum (the base sum of B's). Then for each character in the string, we decide:\n\n- if it's 'A', then we can think of this as changing it from B (so adding a[i] because initially it wasn't B, but the 'A' changes it somehow? Not sure, but code-wise, it's adding to sum1 when 'A', subtracting when 'B'.\n\nWait, perhaps in the forward loop, the logic is different but the code is straightforward, so in Fortran it's do the same.\n\nThen, after processing all the forward steps, then we reset sum1 to the original sum (since we have to do another pass again), and loop backwards again, same logic but goes from the end forwards.\n\nWait the backward loop is from i = n down to 1:\n\nLoop from i = n downto 1:\n\nsum1 again starts as sum (original), and then each step, if 'A', add a(i), if else (B), subtract?\n\nWait same as the forward loop, but processed in reverse order. So the code for the backward loop is:\n\nsum1 = sum\n\ndo i = n, 1, -1\n\n    if (s(i) == 'A') then \n\n        sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n\n    else\n\n        sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n\n    end if \n\n    if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n\nend do \n\nWait, but in the Java code's backward loop, the code starts with sum1 = sum (again). Then loops from s.length()-1 downto 0 (which in Fortran would be 1 to n stepping backward).\n\nNow, in the backward loop, the initial sum is the same, and each step modifies the sum based on the current character, and records the maximum.\n\nWait but the Java code goes in the backward loop as: for (int i = s.length()-1 down to 0). In Fortran we start at n and down to 1.\n\nNow, another point: in Java, the arrays are 0-based, so the first character is index 0, then 1 etc. In Fortran, arrays start at 1, so that's correct.\n\nNow variables: in Java, sum, sum1, ans are all long. So in Fortran, since the code could have large numbers (since a[i] up to like 1e9?), but considering that if n is up to say 1e5, and a[i] 1e9, the sum can be up to 1e14 which requires 64-bit integers. Java uses long (64 bits). In Fortran, the integer size depends on the compiler. \n\nBut if Fortran's default integer is 4 bytes, which can hold up to 2e9, but for cases where n is 1e5 and a[i] is 1e9, sum would be 1e14 which overflows. So in Fortran, I need to use 8 byte integers. So variables like a, sum, sum1, ans should be declared with 8 bytes. \n\nHmm, so in the variables, perhaps better to use integer*8 (old style) or use kind parameter. \n\nWait Fortran 90+ uses 'integer(kind=8)' for 64-bit integers. Alternatively, maybe using selected_int_kind(). Let me decide to use integer*8 for simplicity, but perhaps better to use kind=8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows with integers but I think given the code uses 'long' in Java, we need to use integer*8 in Fortran.\n\nSo modifying variable declarations:\n\ninteger(kind=8) :: sum, sum1, ans\n\nSame for the array a:\n\ninteger(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n\nSo all variables that can be big should be 8-byte integers.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nLet me write the code step by step.\n\nProgram starts:\n\nprogram codeforces_632_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    character(len=1), allocatable :: s(:)\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: temp_s\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum, sum1, ans\n\nWait wait, but reading the string s: how? Because in Fortran, reading variable-length strings. \nWait in the code, I first read a temp string of length n. Hmm. \nAlternatively, better to read the entire line as a string and then take each character.\n\nBut in Fortran, dynamic length variables can be used. But perhaps better to read using a temporary string of length n.\n\nWait but since n is known here, so we can allocate s as a(n). \n\nWait, maybe temp_s is declared as a character of length n, but how to read it?\n\nLet me think. The input for the string is read after the array a. So the code is:\n\nRead n, then read the array a (n times), then read the string s (as a single token? So the string is the next input line? Since in Java, sc.next() gets the next token, but since the a's are read with nextInt(), then the string is read via next(), but if there are multiple tokens, but in the problem's case, the input probably is structured as:\n\nn \n\nfollowing is n integers \n\nthen the string.\n\nLike for example:\n\ninput:\n\n3\n\n5 3 2 \n\nABBA\n\nThen the string is 'ABBA' but n=3? Wait, that can't be. So maybe the problem requires that the string s has exactly n characters. Thus, when reading, the string will consume exactly n characters.\n\nHmm, so the Java reads the string via next(), but in Fortran, perhaps to read a string of exactly n characters, we need to read a string of length n, stripping any whitespace. Or, read from the input line.\n\nWait in Fortran, to read a character string of fixed length, we can use:\n\nread(*, '(a)') temp_s\n\nbut then temp_s must have sufficient length. Wait, but maybe using the following code:\n\nallocate character(len=n) temp_s\n\nthen read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nthen, loop over each character.\n\nAlternatively, read the line into temp_s. \n\nAlternatively, to read each character one by one? Hmm, perhaps better to first read into a temp string of length n, then process each character.\n\nWait perhaps:\n\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    character(len=1), dimension(:), allocatable :: s\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: temp_s\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum, sum1, ans\n\nFirst read n:\n\n    read(*,*) n \n\nAllocate the arrays:\n\n    allocate(a(n), s(n))\n\nRead the a array:\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n    end do \n\nRead the string:\n\n    allocate(character(len=n) :: temp_s)\n\n    read(*,*) temp_s \n\n    do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do \n\nBut in Fortran, the allocation may need to be done before, but maybe it's easier to just use a dummy array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a non-allocatable temp_s. For fixed length? No, because n is variable.\n\nAlternatively, use a character string with length determined by the input.\n\nAlternatively, the code can read the string using direct input:\n\nSuppose:\n\n    temp_s = ' '\n\n    read(*,'(a)') temp_s \n\nBut this requires that the string contains exactly n characters (excluding any whitespace). \n\nWait perhaps this is better:\n\nAssuming that after the n integers, the next input is the string s with exactly n characters.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead the string into a character of sufficient length, but since we know n, use that.\n\nBut allocation is required for temp_s as n-length. \n\nSo code:\n\n    allocate( character(len = n) :: temp_s )\n\n    read( *, '(a)' ) temp_s \n\n    do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do\n\n    deallocate(temp_s)\n\nWait, but I can't do that since temp_s is a local variable. Wait no, in Fortran, allocate-able variables have to have pointers or assumed length. Well perhaps better to make temp_s as a fixed length once n is known.\n\nHmm, but the code can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in reading, instead of using temp_s, read s directly as a character array of length n.\n\nWait in Fortran, when reading into a character array, for example:\n\n    read(*, '(a)') (s(i), i=1, n)\n\nBut I need to check. Because each character would be read in sequence.\n\nWait yes, perhaps the following code can work:\n\n    read(*, '(a)', advance='no') (s(i), i=1,n, 1)\n\nWait but leading and trailing spaces? Not sure, but assuming that the string is entered properly.\n\nAlternatively, to read the entire line after the array a, but in Fortran, read statements may skip leading blanks unless using lists.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is the way, but let's try to proceed with using temp_s.\n\nAnother possible problem: when the string is read as the next token, perhaps leading spaces may be present. But given the problem's input, the strings are probably not in the same line as the integers. The Java code uses next() which takes the next token, so the integers are each in their own tokens, then the string is the next token.\n\nSo in Fortran, the equivalent of nextInt() is to read the integers one by one. So the code structure is correct.\n\nNow variables:\n\nEnsure all the variables that hold sums are kind 8.\n\nsum is initialized as 0.\n\nThen the first sum calculation:\n\n    sum = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (s(i) == 'B') then \n            sum = sum + a(i)\n        end if\n    end do \n\nSet ans and sum1 to sum:\n\n    ans = sum\n    sum1 = sum\n\nThen the first loop (forward):\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (s(i) == 'A') then \n            sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n        else\n            sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n        end if \n        if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n    end do \n\nWait wait in the Java code, the first forward loop is:\n\nsum1 starts as sum (the B sum). Then, for each character in order (since the loop increments i from start to end):\n\nWait, in the Java loop:\n\nfor (int i=0; ... (Java's version starts at 0):\n\nSo in Fortran's version, the loop starts at 1.\n\nProcessing each character. For each character:\n\nif (s[i] is 'A') add a[i] to sum1, else subtract (since 'B' would subtract? Wait in the Java code:\n\nIn the forward loop, after starting sum1 as the initial sum (B's count), then each A adds a[i], and B subtracts a[i]. \n\nWait, the original sum was adding a[i] for B's. But in the first loop the initial sum is the B's sum.\n\nThen, in this forward loop, for each character, if it's A, you add a[i], but that's because previously, not counting A's? Or perhaps the logic here is flipping the contribution of each character.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is that in the forward pass, each time we consider a prefix where we \"force\" each character to be A first or something like that?\n\nNot sure of the algorithm's intention, but translating the code line by line.\n\nThe Java code does for each step in the first loop (forward):\n\nsum1 starts as sum (the initial B's).\n\nThen, for the i-th character (from 0 to n-1 in Java, which is 1-based to n in Fortran):\n\nIf the character is 'A', then add a[i] to sum1. Else (it's 'B'), subtract a[i].\n\nWait, but the initial sum already includes a[i] when it's 'B', so subtracting here might indicate changing it from B to something else? Or perhaps the algorithm is considering alternative paths?\n\nRegardless, the code is doing that, so need to translate accordingly.\n\nYes, the code for the loop in Fortran is as before.\n\nThen, after the forward loop, reset sum1 to the original sum again, and do the backward loop:\n\n    sum1 = sum\n    do i = n,1,-1\n        if (s(i) == 'A') then \n            sum1 = sum1 + a(i)\n        else\n            sum1 = sum1 - a(i)\n        end if\n        if (sum1 > ans) ans = sum1\n    end do \n\nFinally, print ans.\n\nBut wait, in the backward loop:\n\nThe loop processes each character starting from the end backwards, each step adjusting sum1.\n\nNow, printing the result.\n\n    print*, ans \n\nBut in Fortran, variables must be of compatible types. Since ans is an 8-byte integer, which is compatible.\n\nNow putting all together, let me write the code step by step, making sure all parts are correctly translated.\n\nAlso note that Fortran uses 1-based indices, so the code is adjusted accordingly.\n\nNow, dealing with the string s.\n\nWait another thing: in Fortran, comparison of characters is case-sensitive. The Java code checks if ch == 'B' (uppercase). So in the Fortran code, s(i) must compare with 'B', so make sure that the input is read in uppercase.\n\nBut assuming the problem inputs uppercase letters.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing some edge case:\n\nSuppose n=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n5\n\nB\n\nThen the initial sum is 5. The forward loop:\n\ni=1:\n\ns is 'B' \u2192 else clause, subtract a(1). sum1 becomes 5 -5 =0. So ans remains 5.\n\nThen the backward loop, similarly sum1 is again 5:\n\ni=1:\n\nsame, ends with sum1=0.\n\nSo total ans remains 5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, a = [3, 5], s = 'AB'\n\nInitial sum: B is at second character \u2192 5? Wait wait 'AB' \u2192 'A' and 'B'\n\nThe first sum counts 'B's \u2192 second character, so sum is 5.\n\nForward loop:\n\ni=1 (A):\n\nsum1 becomes 5 +3 \u21928, ans is now 8.\n\ni=2 (B):\n\nsum1 is 8 -5 \u21923 (less than 8, so ans remains 8.\n\nThen, then the backward loop starts with sum1=5.\n\ni=2 (B):\n\nsum1 = 5-5=0. ans still 8.\n\ni=1 (A):\n\nsum1 +=3 \u2192 0+3 =3, which is less than 8.\n\nSo final answer is 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe maximum can be achieved when you process the first character as 'A', adding that element. So yes, the code would do that.\n\nNow putting all the code together with correct variables and loops.\n\nFinal Fortran code:\n\nprogram codeforces_632_B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8), allocatable :: a(:)\n    character(len=1), allocatable :: s(:)\n    character(len=:), allocatable :: temp_s\n    integer(kind=8) :: sum, sum1, ans\n\n    !

Output the result\n    print *, ans\n\nend program codeforces_632_B\n\nWait, but the reading of the string in the Fortran code may have an issue. The 'read(*, 'a)' with advance='no' might leave possible issues with advancing or trailing characters, but I think it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using read(*,*) temp_s will read the next record, but since the previous reads are using '*', spaces, the next read should be next line.\n\nWait let me think: the first reads are:\n\nRead n as *, which is a single number, then a loop to read each a(i).\n\nThen, after those reads, the next read is the temp_s string. Suppose the a's were read in separate lines, so the next line after the a's is the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input comes all in a single line after a's. But in Java, the 'next()' gets the next token after the ints. In any case, perhaps using the following read statement:\n\n    read(*, '(a)', advance='no') temp_s \n\nBut advance='no' might cause issues because reading the rest of the line.\n\nWait, better to use:\n\n    read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nBecause this reads an entire line.\n\nWait but if the previous reads (reading the a's) left it pointing on the same line, but assuming the input is done properly, probably okay.\n\nAlternatively, a better way may be to read the string like this:\n\n    read(*, '(/a)') temp_s\n\nBut maybe it's better not to worry and proceed. The code may have some issues depending on the input layout, but assuming that the string s is on its own line after the a elements.\n\nAlternatively, in the first loop, after reading a(i), the next read for the s is getting the next line. \n\nHmm, perhaps in the code:\n\nAfter the a array is read, the next line is the s string. \n\nWait, in the Java code, Scanner nextInt() reads tokens from the input (possibly separated by any whitespaces), then next() reads the next token. \n\nIn Fortran, reading the a elements each via read(*,*) which takes each subsequent integer, including from separate lines or in line, and then the next read for the string is read as a line.\n\nSo perhaps the code works if the a elements and s are in lines. Alternatively:\n\nAlternative approach: Read the s string as the next input token, even if it's inline. \n\nHmm, but to handle this, reading as 'a' may not be the best. Perhaps read using a list:\n\n    read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n), temp_s\n\nWait, but that would read n integers and then the string, which may require the string to be in the same line after the a elements. \n\nAlternatively, in Fortran, to read the string as a final token, maybe:\n\nallocate(temp_s as length n)\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,n), temp_s \n\nBut I'm not sure. This could be error-prone if the user input is not carefully structured. Since the problem is code submission, we can assume the inputs are properly structured. \n\nAlternatively, using the method with reading a temporary string of length n is better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first code is okay.\n\nAnother thing in the string loop:\n\nThe loop to read s is:\n\n    do concurrent (i=1:n)\n\nWait using 'concurrent' may not be needed. It's a parallel loop, which may not be necessary. Since the order doesn't matter, but for clarity, a simple do loop:\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do \n\nYes, better to use sequential loop.\n\nCorrecting:\n\n    do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do \n\nNext, the lines for temp_s:\n\n    allocate( character(len=n) :: temp_s )\n\nBut in Fortran, variable length declaration must be explicit. However, in recent versions using allocatable character variables. \n\nAlternatively, use:\n\n    temp_s = ' ' \n\nBut since n is the length, that won't work. \n\nAlternatively, use:\n\n    character(len=n) :: temp_s\n\nBut then the allocate isn't needed? Wait in that case:\n\n    read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nthen the do loop.\n\nWait no, the temp_s must be declared with length n, but since n is not known till runtime, we need to declare it as allocatable.\n\nWait in Fortran 2003, we can use deferred length. Like:\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: temp_s\n\nAllocate it as len=n.\n\nYes, so then:\n\n    allocate( character(len = n) :: temp_s )\n\nThen read the entire string into it with read(*, '(a)') temp_s \n\nWait in that case, yes.\n\nWait in Fortran, when you have a deferred length allocatable character variable, you can allocate it with a specific length.\n\nSo perhaps that's the correct way.\n\nSo modifying:\n\n    ! Read the string s into a temporary string, then split into individual characters\n    allocate( character(len = n) :: temp_s )\n    read(*, '(a)') temp_s\n    do i = 1, n\n        s(i) = temp_s(i:i)\n    end do\n    deallocate(temp_s)\n\nThat should work.\n\nSo the corrected code: replaced 'concurrent' with a normal loop.\n\nThus, the final code is as follows:\n\nNow I think that's the correct translation."
