    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me look at the Java code first to understand what it's doing. \n\nThe program reads a word from the user, then counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. Depending on which count is higher, it converts the entire word to uppercase or lowercase. If they're equal, it goes to lowercase.\n\nHmm, Fortran is a bit different from Java. Let me think about how to approach each part.\n\nFirst, reading input. In Java, they use Scanner. In Fortran, I can read from standard input using a read statement. The word here is a string, so I need to declare a character variable. Since the length isn't fixed, maybe use a fixed size array, like 100 characters, just to be safe. Alternatively, in newer Fortran versions, you can have variable length strings with \"CHARACTER(len=:)\", but maybe I'll use a fixed length to keep it simple.\n\nWait, the input is a single word, so maybe read until a space or newline. But in Fortran, the read statement can read a string until the end of line. Let me think. Maybe declare a variable as a character string with a length sufficient, say 1000, then read using \"read(*,'(A)') word\". That should read the entire line, but the problem might just have a single word, so that's okay.\n\nNext, counting uppercase and lowercase letters. The loop over each character. In Fortran, strings are arrays of characters, so we can loop from 1 to LEN_TRIM(word). Because trailing spaces in a fixed-length string are ignored with LEN_TRIM.\n\nWait, in Fortran, string indices start at 1, right? So the first character is 1, not zero. So for loops need to adjust for that. For example, do i = 1, length of word.\n\nFor each character, check if it's uppercase or lowercase. Java has Character.isUpperCase, but Fortran doesn't have built-in functions for that. Hmm. How to do that in Fortran?\n\nI think comparing the ASCII values. Uppercase letters are from 'A' to 'Z' (ASCII 65-90), lowercase from 'a' to 'z' (97-122). So for a character c:\n\nIf ICHAR(c) >= ICHAR('A') .and. ICHAR(c) <= ICHAR('Z'), then it's uppercase.\n\nSimilarly for lowercase. \n\nSo the loop would be:\n\nuppercase = 0\nlowercase = 0\ndo i = 1, len_trim(word)\n    c = word(i:i)\n    if (c >= 'A' and c <= 'Z') then\n        uppercase = uppercase +1\n    else if (c >= 'a' and c <= 'z') then\n        lowercase = lowercase +1\n    else\n        * Hmm, what about other characters? The problem probably assumes letters only. So maybe just skip others, but the original code would count them as lowercase? Wait, in the original Java code, else (not uppercase) increments lowercase. So in Java, any character that's not uppercase (including non-letters) would be considered lowercase. Wait, but in the problem from Codeforces, maybe the input only has letters. Maybe the Java code counts any non-uppercase as lowercase. So in Fortran, same logic.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as such, just checking the ranges for letters, but in Java's code, even if a character is something else (like a digit or symbol), it counts it as lowercase. But perhaps the problem doesn't have that case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the same approach: if the character is uppercase, then up, else down.\n\nWait, in Fortran:\n\nif (ICHAR(c) >= ICHAR('A') .and. ICHAR(c) <= ICHAR('Z')) then\n   uppercase = uppercase +1\nelse\n   lowercase = lowercase +1\nend if\n\nYes, that's equivalent.\n\nThen after the loop, decide which is bigger. If uppercase > lowercase, output all uppercase. Else, lowercase. If equal, also lowercase.\n\nSo the code in Fortran could be structured as follows:\n\nRead the word first. Then loop through each character. Increment counters. Then decide.\n\nNow, converting the string to upper or lower case. Fortran has the functions for that: uppercase with ADJUSTL or ... Wait, no, to convert a character to uppercase, can use the ACHAR function to shift. Alternatively, there are intrinsic functions?\n\nWait, Fortran intrinsic functions: UCASE or something? Wait, I think in Fortran 2003 there is FORTRAN_C_Is_Upper() but maybe not certain. Wait, better to check.\n\nAlternatively, useTRANSFER to manipulate ASCII codes. Alternatively, use the following:\n\nTo convert to uppercase, you can subtract 32 from lowercase letters (if between a-z). For lowercase, add 32 if uppercase. But that might be error-prone. \n\nAlternatively, the Fortran standard has functions:\n\nUCASE and LCASE? Not sure. Let me recall, perhaps there's a built-in function. Wait, no, probably not. So, to convert a string to upper case, perhaps:\n\nupper_word = words in uppercase:\n\nDO I = 1, len_trim(word)\n    c = word(i:i)\n    IF (c >= 'a' .AND. c <= 'z') CYCLE (Wait no). \n\nAlternatively, for each character, check if it is lowercase. To uppercase, subtract 32 (ASCII difference between lowercase and uppercase letters).\n\nSo, to make the entire string uppercase:\n\nupper_string = \"\"\nDO I = 1, LEN(word)\n    char = word(i:i)\n    IF (char >= 'a' .AND. char <= 'z') THEN\n        new_char = CHAR(ICHAR(char) - 32)\n    ELSE\n        new_char = char\n    ENDIF\n    upper_string = upper_string // new_char\nEND DO\n\nSimilarly for lowercase, adding 32 for uppercase letters. \n\nHmm, since in the Java code, the transformation is straightforward. But in Fortran, perhaps easier to use the built-in functions if they exist. Alternatively, the user may have to write these routines. \n\nAlternatively, Fortran has the functions: Adjustl (but that lowers the letters?) Actually, no: ADJUSTL just moves the string to left, trimming leading whitespace. Not related.\n\nWait, perhaps the code has to process each character individually. Since in Fortran each character can be manipulated by their ASCII value.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's an intrinsic function.\n\nLooking up, Fortran has the following: the \"TRANSFORM\" function in some compilers but standard? Or in new Fortran standards?\n\nAlternatively, use the following idea:\n\nword_upper = ADJUSTL(word)  ? Not useful here.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a loop to create the uppercase string.\n\nSince the problem requires converting the entire string to upper or lower, maybe the code for conversion can be done as per the following:\n\nSo, let me code the Fortran program step by step.\n\nProgram steps:\n\n1. Read the input word: let's use a character array of, say, 1000 length.\n\nBut better to use a parameter for the max length. Let's say:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: word\n\nread(*,'(A)') word\n\nBut in some Fortran versions, the A format may read until the end of line.\n\nBut in any case, the problem states a single word, so it's okay.\n\nBut in Fortran, the read statement might require trimming. Until the code just reads into word properly.\n\nThen count uppercase and lowercase:\n\ninteger :: uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(word)\n    c = word(i:i)\n    if (ichar(c)>= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c)<= ichar('Z')) then\n        uppercase = uppercase +1\n    else\n        lowercase = lowercase +1\n    endif\nend do\n\nThat's for counting. \n\nNow, decide which to output. If uppercase > lowercase then uppercase, else lowercase.\n\nThen to convert:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase then:\n\ncall convert to uppercase, then print.\n\nElse:\n\nconvert to lowercase.\n\nWait, how to do the conversion.\n\nFirst, for converting to lowercase, for each character in uppercase, we add 32. For example 'A' becomes 'a'.\n\nSo create the new string:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: result\ninteger :: i\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n    do i = 1, len_trim(word)\n        c = word(i:i)\n        if (ichar(c) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('Z')) then\n            result(i:i) = char(ichar(c)+32)\n        else\n            result(i:i) = c\n        end if\n    end do\nelse\n    do i = 1, len_trim(word)\n        c = word(i:i)\n        if (ichar(c) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('z')) then\n            result(i:i) = c\n        else if (ichar(c) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('Z')) then\n            result(i:i) = char(ichar(c)+32)\n        else\n            result(i:i) = c\n        end if\n    end do\nend if\n\nWait but the else also includes the case when lowercase equals uppercase? Since the condition is \"else\" which includes equality. The original code had:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase: uppercase\n\nElse if lowercase > then lowercase else (equal) also lowercase.\n\nWait in the original code: else if (lowercase>uppercase) then print to lowercase else (the else is when they are equal) print to lowercase, so overall, if equal, lowercase.\n\nSo in Fortran code, the condition can be structured as:\n\nif (uppercase > lowercase) then\n    make to uppercase\nelse\n    make to lowercase\nend if\n\nBecause in the else case, either lowercase is > or equal to uppercase.\n\nThus, when converting to lowercase, the code can be:\n\nmake all uppercase letters lowercase. For others, leave as is.\n\nSimilarly, upper makes lowercase letters uppercase. \n\nWait, in the code for converting, in the uppercase case, we change lowercase letters? No, no. Let's correct that.\n\nIf we want to uppercase the entire word:\n\neach lowercase letter is turned to uppercase via adding 32. \n\nWait no. To uppercase a lowercase, subtract 32 (since 'a' is 97, 'A' is 65). So 'a' -32 is A.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo:\n\nfor uppercase case:\n\nfor each character:\n\nif it's lowercase, convert to uppercase (subtract 32), else leave as is.\n\nWait no. Wait, uppercase letters should stay as uppercase, and lowercase letters should be uppercase. \n\nWait in uppercase conversion, all letters become uppercase.\n\nSo code for conversion to uppercase:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(word)\n    c = word(i:i)\n    if (c >= 'a' .and. c <= 'z') then\n        result(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n    else\n        result(i:i) = c\n    end if\nend do \n\nSimilarly, converting to lowercase:\n\ndo i = 1, len_trim(word)\n    c = word(i:i)\n    if (c >= 'A' .and. c <= 'Z') then\n        result(i:i) = char(ichar(c)+32)\n    else\n        result(i:i) = c\n    end if\nend do\n\nWait that's better. So for converting to uppercase, we check if it's lowercase and then uppercase it. For converting to lowercase, check if its uppercase and then lower.\n\nThus, the code can be written like that.\n\nPutting this together, the entire Fortran program would look like:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: word, result\n    integer :: uppercase = 0, lowercase = 0, i, n\n    integer :: len_word\n\n    read(*, '(A)') word\n    len_word = len_trim(word)\n    \n    ! Count uppercase and lowercase\n    do i = 1, len_word\n        character :: c = word(i:i)\n        integer :: cv = ichar(c)\n        if (cv >= ichar('A') .and. cv <= ichar('Z')) then\n            uppercase = uppercase +1\n        else\n            lowercase = lowercase +1\n        endif\n    end do\n\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n        ! Convert to uppercase\n        do i = 1, len_word\n            character :: c = word(i:i)\n            if (ichar(c) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('z')) then\n                result(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n            else\n                result(i:i) = c\n            end if\n        end do\n    else\n        ! Convert to lowercase\n        do i = 1, len_word\n            character :: c = word(i:i)\n            if (ichar(c) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('Z')) then\n                result(i:i) = char(ichar(c) +32)\n            else\n                result(i:i) = c\n            end if\n        end do\n    endif\n\n    ! Trim the result to the length of the word (since result is initialized with trailing spaces)\n    write(*, '(A)') trim(result)\nend program main\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when assigning to 'result', which is declared as length 1000, but after the loops, the length is correct, because the loop is up to len_word. However, when outputting, you can just write the entire result (or better, use trim, but in this case, since result holds up to len_trim(word), which was the length of the original input, but with possibly trailing spaces beyond the len_word. Wait, no. The original word is stored in a 1000 length array. But in the loops, we do up to 'len_word' (the Trim's length). The characters in result after the loop would have values set up to len_word, with possible leading spaces in the result? Not exactly.\n\nWait, when you assign result(i:i) = ... for i from 1 to len_word, then the result has its first len_word characters as the transformed string, but the rest (from len_word+1 to 1000) are empty or whatever was in the array before. But when we print, you can trim it, but the original word's length is len_word, so trimming would leave it as len_word's length, so it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, the write statement can be 'write(*,*) trim(result)' which would print the trimmed version.\n\nWait, but maybe the result has exactly those characters set, so leading characters up to len_word are correct. \n\nAlternatively, in the conversion loops, perhaps use the current c and build the result as a string, concatenated via something like result = result // c. But that would require dynamic strings, which can be done in Fortran fortran 90 with allocatable arrays but maybe more complex.\n\nAlternatively, initializing the result array first might be okay. The previous approach should work.\n\nWait, testing for example:\n\nIf the input is 'aBc', then len_word is 3. After processing, result(1:3) will have the transformed letters, and the rest of the string from 4 to 1000 may have whatever was there. When we write, using '(A)' format specification, the write statement would print the entire array up to the first end of string. Wait, but in Fortran, character variables after a write statement with '(A)' would print the entire variable, but trailing blanks are output as spaces. So it's better to either use ADJUSTL to move it left (but not needed here) or simply trim. Wait, perhaps better to output only the first len_word characters.\n\nWait the problem is that if the result array's first len_word characters are correct and the rest are undefined, but when printed with '(A)', the entire array would be printed as a string with trailing spaces. To prevent that, you can trim the result, but since the result is exactly as long as the original input (len_trim(word)), the TRIM function would work.\n\nWait, the result has exactly the same length as the input? The len_trim(word) is the original length. The conversion process made sure the first len_word characters are correctly set. The rest are whatever was there before (maybe initial value?), but the TRIM(ADJUSTL(result))? Or just trim? Wait, because ADJUSTL would left-align, but the content is already in the first part. So just using 'write(*, '(A)')' would output the entire len=1000 string, but that would include trailing blanks. To avoid that, use the G0 format: write(*, '(G0)') result(1:len_word) \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') result(1:len_word)\n\nWhich would print exactly the first len_word characters, avoiding any trailing spaces. \n\nBecause the input word may have spaces but that wasn't part of the input? No, since we are reading the word via '(A)' which reads the entire line, but the problem is about a single word.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to:\n\nAfter the conversion loops, the result has the first len_word characters correctly filled. So to output, we can write that substring.\n\nHence, the final write statement should be:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') result(1:len_word)\n\nAlternatively, since result is allocated for 1000, but len_word can be up to that. So the write.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be adjusted as follows:\n\nbefore the write, set result to have exactly the length of the input.\n\nHmm, but this might complicate. The easiest way is to use write(*, '(A)') trim(result). But is the result's trailing characters spaces?\n\nIn the conversion loops, the code loops up to len_word, so for the positions 1 to len_word in result, each character is set. All characters after are whatever their initial value was, which might be undefined or spaces (since in Fortran, variables are initialized to ASCII 0 or spaces? Not sure. But if you don't initialize result, then the initial values are undefined.)\n\nWait, in the code above, the result is declared with len=1000, but not initialized. So those characters might contain any random characters. That's a problem. So when you output 'trim(result)', TRIM looks for the first trailing whitespace from the end. If any of the characters after the useful length are non-whitespace, the 'trim(result)' might not work as expected.\n\nSo, the better approach is to initialize the result variable to all blanks first, then fill up to len_word.\n\nAlternatively, after declaring 'result', do:\n\nresult = ' ' \n\nor perhaps better to initialize to all blanks. \n\nWait, in Fortran, automatic variables are not necessarily initialized to zero. So the code needs to fill the entire result array? Well, unless you can just work with strings.\n\nAlternatively, here's a safer approach:\n\nWhen building the result array, you can start with an empty string, but in Fortran standard variable length strings. \n\nAlternatively, switch to using an array of characters for result.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to use an intermediate variable.\n\nAlternatively, here's an alternative plan.\n\nLet me restructure the code:\n\nAfter counting the letters, decide which case to convert to, then process each character of the word, building the transformed string.\n\nIn the loop for converting, perhaps build the result as a character string in stages:\n\nresult = ''\n\nBut in Fortran, appending to strings isn't straightforward. Instead, we can use an array to collect characters.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: temp\n\ntemp = word  ! copy the word into temp, then modify temp in place.\n\nThen process each character of 'temp' and modify it.\n\nWait, that's possible. Let me see.\n\nSo for converting to uppercase:\n\ndo i=1, len_word\n    c = temp(i:i)\n    if (ichar(c) >= a_low and etc.. )\n\nWait, to do it in-place in the temp array:\n\nWe can do:\n\nLet me think. Using array sections:\n\nWait, perhaps the code would be better written as:\n\nAfter computing the uppercase count and lowercase count, we need to decide whether to uppercase or lowercase, then process each character.\n\nSuppose we have the variable temp = word, then process each character.\n\nBut for Fortran 90, perhaps:\n\nif uppercase > lowercase then\n\n    do i=1, len_word\n\n        current_char = temp(i:i)\n\n        if ( current_char >= 'a' and current_char <= 'z' ) then\n\n            temp(i:i) = char(ichar(current_char) -32)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nelse\n\n    do i =1, len_word\n\n        current_char = temp(i:i)\n\n        if ( current_char >= 'A' and current_char <= 'Z' ) then\n\n            temp(i:i) = char(ichar(current_char)+32)\n\n        end if\n\n    end do\n\nend if\n\nwrite(*, '(A)') temp(1:len_trim(word))\n\nThat would be better, reusing the word's array, but not overwriting the original? Wait, but we can use temp as a temporary copy.\n\nYes. Let me code that approach.\n\nSo here's the revised plan:\n\nUse the original word's string.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter reading word, get len_word.\n\nThen, make a copy (temp) as the original, and modify temp.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncharacter(len=1000) :: word, temp\n\nread(*,*) word\n\ntemp = word\n\nThen do the uppercase/lowercase modification on temp.\n\nThus, the code can become:\n\nprogram main\n    implicit none\n    character(len=1000) :: word, temp\n    integer :: uppercase, lowercase, i, len_word\n\n    read(*, '(A)') word\n    len_word = len_trim(word)\n    temp = word  ! copies the string for modification\n\n    uppercase = 0\n    lowercase = 0\n    do i = 1, len_word\n        character :: c = word(i:i)\n        if (ichar(c) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('Z')) then\n            uppercase = uppercase +1\n        else\n            lowercase = lowercase +1\n        end if\n    end do\n\n    if (uppercase > lowercase) then\n        do i = 1, len_word\n            character :: c = temp(i:i)\n            if (ichar(c) >= ichar('a') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('z')) then\n                temp(i:i) = char(ichar(c) - 32)\n            end if\n        end do\n    else\n        do i = 1, len_word\n            character :: c = temp(i:i)\n            if (ichar(c) >= ichar('A') .and. ichar(c) <= ichar('Z')) then\n                temp(i:i) = char(ichar(c) + 32)\n            end if\n        end do\n    end if\n\n    write(*, '(A)') temp(1:len_word)\nend program main\n\nHmm, this seems better, as it avoids the need to initialize a new result array. It modifies temp in place.\n\nWait, but in the first loop (count), we are using the original word's characters, which is okay. \n\nThis is better because it reduces the number of loops. The count uses the original, and then modification on temp.\n\nThus, this should be more efficient and manageable.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nSuppose the input is \"codeforces\".\n\nThat's all lowercase except the 'C'? Or no: 'codeforces' is all lowercase. Then lower count is higher. So it outputs as lowercase.\n\nIf input is \"CoDe\", then uppercase C, lowercase o, uppercase D and e. Wait: \"CoDe\" has uppercase letters: C and D. Lowercase: o and e.\n\nUpper: 2, lower:2 \u2192 outputs lowercase.\n\nYes, which is correct according to the problem statement.\n\nAnother test case: input \"abC\" \u2192 lower: 2, up:1 \u2192 lower case transformation \u2192 \"abc\".\n\nThe code would process this correctly.\n\nTesting conversion:\n\nTake uppercase scenario: input \"UPper\". U is 85, P is 80, p is 112, e etc. UPPERCASE letters U, P (first letters). So uppercase count is 2 (U and P?), no, let's count all caps. Wait \"UPper\":\n\nU \u2013 uppercase, P \u2013 uppercase, the rest p is lowercase etc.\n\nWait \"UPper\" has the first two letters uppercase: so uppercase count is 2, lowercase letters: p (3rd character), e, r? So 3 letters. So total.\n\nWait 2 uppercase and 3 lowercase \u2192 lowercase case, output to lowercase: \"upper\".\n\nAnother example: \"Hello\" \u2192 uppercase count for H is 1, lowercase 4. So total 1 vs 4: output lowercase.\n\nOkay, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: empty string? Probably not required here, but the problem specifies a word.\n\nWhat if the input is all non-letters, like \"123aB\"? The code would count uppercase and lowercase letters. \n\nIn \"123aB\" the uppercase letters: 'B', lowercase 'a'. uppercase count:1, lowercase:1. So equal \u2192 output lowercase.\n\nThe non-letters are counted as non-uppercase thus lowercase.\n\nWhich is consistent with the Java code.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses character variables. In the code when we have loops, for each character, we can compare against lowercase and uppercase ranges.\n\nI think this code should be correct. Now, to write the Fortran code."
