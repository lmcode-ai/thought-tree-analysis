    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to convert this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nThe main program reads three inputs: an integer r, an integer d, and a long x. Then it runs a loop 10 times, each time updating x as r*x - d and printing the result. The SimpleScanner class is a custom scanner for reading inputs efficiently.\n\nFirst, I need to handle input in Fortran. Since standard Fortran I/O can read from stdin using read(*,*) statements, maybe I can replace the SimpleScanner with standard input. The SimpleScanner in Java is probably for faster reading, but in Fortran, I/O is usually okay unless the data is extremely large, which doesn't seem the case here.\n\nSo the main part of the code in Fortran could be straightforward. Let's see:\n\nThe main code reads r, d, x (x as integer*8 since it's a long in Java). Then loop 10 times, compute x = r*x - d, and print each result.\n\nNow, translating the Java code's main function into Fortran:\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC127_B\n  implicit none\n  integer :: r, d\n  integer(8) :: x\n  integer :: i\n\n  read(*,*) r, d, x\n\n  do i = 1, 10\n     x = r * x - d\n     write(*,*) x\n  end do\n\nend program atcoder_ABC127_B\n\nWait, but in the Java code, the loop runs 10 times starting from i=0. But in Fortran, if I loop i from 1 to 10, it's equivalent. The number of iterations is correct.\n\nWait, checking the loop in Java: for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) \u2192 10 iterations. The Fortran do i=1,10 also 10 iterations. So that's okay.\n\nNow, about data types: in Java, r and d are ints, x is a long. So in Fortran:\n\nr and d should be integers. x should be 8-byte integer (SELECTED_INT_KIND(18) perhaps?), but for simplicity, since in Java it's a long (64 bits), in Fortran use INTEGER(8).\n\nSo that part is straightforward.\n\nThe Java code uses a custom scanner. But in Fortran, the input can be read with a simple READ statement. If the input is provided correctly, there's no need for anything else. Let me think: the input comes as three numbers, so we can read them all at once with:\n\nread(*,*) r, d, x\n\nAssuming the input is given in one line, or split across lines, but standard read would handle it. So the SimpleScanner code can be ignored in Fortran, since standard input is easier here.\n\nTherefore, the Fortran code is much simpler without needing to replicate the SimpleScanner class. The only thing I need to ensure is correct data types for input variables and the loop.\n\nWait, let me check if I missed anything from the SimpleScanner. The problem might have required handling of large input, but the problem here is simple: three integers, then process them. The custom scanner might have been for efficiency in contests, but in Fortran, regardless, the code can handle it directly.\n\nTherefore, the translated code should be as I outlined above.\n\nWait, the initial variables:\n\nIn Java, x is a long. So in Fortran, using INTEGER*8 or integer(selected_int_kind(18)), but in modern Fortran, integer(8) is 64 bits. So okay.\n\nWait, the loop needs to execute 10 times, starting with the initial x. For example, the first x after calculation is r*x_initial -d, then that becomes the new x, etc.\n\nThe Fortran code's loop starts with the initial x, then each iteration applies the formula, so that's correct.\n\nYes, I think this is the correct translation. The Fortran code would be straightforward. \n\nWait, perhaps I should test with sample input. Suppose input is r=2, d=3, x=10.\n\nThen first iteration: x = 2*10 -3 = 17 \u2192 printed.\n\nSecond: 2*17-3 = 31 \u2192 etc. So the code would output 10 times.\n\nYes, the Fortran code will do that.\n\nTherefore, this is the correct translation."
