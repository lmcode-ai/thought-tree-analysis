The array for que needs to be size >= N.\n\nI declared que as dimension 0 to N, which is N+1 elements. That's okay. Wait in the declarations: allocate( que(0:N) ) so indices from 0 through N (inclusive) = N+1 elements. But in code, top was initialized to 0, and the top can go up to N elements as maximum.

No. Wait wait:\n\nWait the formula in the Java code:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - index -1 \n\nSuppose when the que is processed after the loop, the index is -1 (after the last iteration), so:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nLooking at the code, it reads some input numbers and calculates some arrays called leftl and rightl. Then uses them to compute the answer. The main part is using a deque (like a stack?) to track indices. The algorithm seems like it's finding for each element how many consecutive elements to the left and right are smaller than it. Probably for calculating the maximum area histogram problem or similar.\n\nFirst, let's note the data types. Java uses int arrays, which in Fortran could be integers. Also, the deque is from ArrayDeque, which is a doubly-ended queue, but in the code's usage, it's used as a stack since it's always pushing and popping from the top. Wait, looking at the code: que.push(index) and que.poll() as first element? Wait, in Java's ArrayDeque, the peek() returns the first element, so when pushing on a deque, when you call push, it's like adding to the front. The loops have que.poll() which takes the first element (like a stack pop).\n\nHmm, Fortran doesn't have a native deque, but I can represent it using an array with indices to track the front and back. However, since in the code the deque is used in a stack-like way (using push and poll, which when using the peek of the deque's first element?), Wait, perhaps the way the deque is used here is actually as a stack. Because in the first loop:\n\nwhile (index < N) {\n    while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n        int ind = que.poll();\n        rightl[ind] = index - ind -1;\n    }\n    que.push(index++);\n}\n\nque.push(index) adds to the top, and poll takes from the top? Wait, ArrayDeque has push() which adds to front (so like a stack), and poll() removes from front. So the code is effectively using a stack where the elements are in the order that they are pushed, and when the current a[index] is smaller than the stack top, it pops elements. Wait, wait, the condition is while the top of the stack (que.peek()) has an a value greater than current a[index], then we pop. Wait, no, the loop is while que not empty and a[que.peek()] > current a, so when the current a is smaller, they pop until the top is smaller or equal. Then push the current index (increment index). \n\nHmm, this is the standard approach for finding the next smaller element. The code is calculating for each element the number of elements to the right that are smaller than it. Then, similarly on the left. Then, the answer is the sum over each element of a[i] * (left_count+1) * (right_count+1). \n\nIn the first part for rightl:\n\nThe initial loop builds the stack in such a way that each time an element is popped, it is because the current index is the first element to its right that is smaller than it. So rightl stores how many consecutive elements after it are smaller? \n\nWait, rightl[ind] is set to index - ind -1. So for example, if ind was last entry and now when index is at a position where a[index] is smaller than the ind's a value, then rightl[ind] is set to (index - ind -1). This would be the number of elements between ind and index minus 1? Hmm maybe.\n\nThe first loop handles some elements, and then after the first loop runs (when index runs past N), any remaining entries in the stack are those for which there is no next smaller element. For those, the rightl is set to N - ind - 1?\n\nSimilarly for the leftl, but reversed.\n\nNow, in translating this to Fortran, I need to find an equivalent data structure for the deque/stack. Since in the Java code, it's using a stack (as per the operations), maybe an array-based stack would work. Since Fortran is statically typed and arrays are fixed size, we can pre-allocate for the maximum possible depth (like size N). \n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the variables:\n\nIn Java, variables:\n\n- N is the input size (integer)\n- a is an integer array of size N, inputted via Scanner\n- leftl and rightl are integer arrays of size N\n- que is the ArrayDeque\n- index is a loop variable\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n- Integer array declarations can be done with DIMENSION statements. Since Fortran uses 1-based indices by default, but Java uses 0-based. Need to adjust for that. \n\nWait, the Java code uses indices from 0 to N-1, so in Fortran, I can either use 1-based (adjusting all indices) or 0-based. Alternatively, the Fortran arrays can be declared as (0:N-1) but in fortran, the indexes usually start at 1, but we can specify the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, better to use 0-based, but I need to declare the array with appropriate bounds. In Fortran, dimensions are usually done with LBOUND to UBOUND. So for a array of N elements, declare it as (0:N-1). The same for the leftl and rightl arrays.\n\nFirst, the code:\n\nThe code starts by reading N, then reading N integers into the array a. \n\nSo in Fortran:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc005_b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, index\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, leftl, rightl\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: que   ! stack array\n    integer :: top\n    ... read input here ...\n\nWait, but how to handle the queue/deque /stack.\n\nIn Java it's ArrayDeque, which can grow dynamically, but in Fortran, since N is known, perhaps can pre-allocate arrays for que. The maximum size of the stack won't exceed N, so allocate que array of size N, with index from 1 to N, and a top pointer.\n\nWait, the stack can be implemented with an array and a pointer to top. Let me see:\n\nThe que in Java is being used as a stack. So the Fortran code can have an array for que of length N, and have a variable 'top' that tracks the top index. \n\nSo:\n\nStarting with the queue management:\n\nInitialize 'que' as an array of integers, say of size N, and a stack pointer 'top' which is the current top. \n\nInitialize the stack as empty (top=0). Then, for push: que(top+1) = x; top +=1; for pop: top -=1 and get que(top+1), etc.\n\nWait, let's think in steps:\n\nOriginal loops:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nindex starts at 0, goes up to N. While index <N, \n\nthe inner loop does while !que.isEmpty && a[que.top()] > a[index]:\n\npop the top and set rightl[ind] (the popped index) to index - ind -1.\n\nThen push the current index, then index increases.\n\nWait in Fortran code:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nallocate: que has size (1 to N), top is an integer, initialized to 0.\n\nThen:\n\nindex = 0\n\ndo while (index < N)\n\n   do while ( top >=1 .and. a( que(top) ) > a( index+1 )  ??? Wait wait indexes.\n\nWait the Fortran arrays for a are going to be 1-based? Let's see:\n\nIn the Java code, the input a is from a[0] to a[N-1]. To use 1-based in Fortran:\n\nIn fortran, the array a can be sized as (N). Then:\n\nIn the java code, for each i from 0 to N-1, a[i] is read. In Fortran, it will be 1 to N, so the first element is a(1), etc. So the indices need adjustment.\n\nWait, this can be a point of error. Alternatively, just use 0-based in Fortran. But Fortran 90 allows any lower bounds, so:\n\ndeclare the arrays a(0:N-1), etc. So that a(0) is first element.\n\nYes, perhaps easier to align with java's indices.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nDimension variables:\n\ninteger :: N\n\nallocate a(0:N-1), leftl(0:N-1), rightl(0:N-1). All from 0 to N-1.\n\nSo for the stack 'que' array, which in java holds the indices of elements (0 to N-1). So, stack array can be of size N, with elements indices from 0 to N-1. \n\nThen the stack can be managed with a que array (que(1) to que(top)), top is the index of the top element. \n\nSo when we push an index: top = top +1, que(Top) = ind\n\nPop: ind = que(top), then top = top -1.\n\nThen the first loop:\n\nIn Java:\n\nindex starts at 0, loop while index <N.\n\nInside, while the que is not empty and a[que.peek] > a[index], we pop the top.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nInitially, top is 0 (empty)\n\nLoop: do while (index < N)\n\n    do while ( (top >0 ) .AND. ( a( que(top) ) > a(index) ) )\n\nHmm, no: a in fortran is similar to Java's. Wait a[index] is a(index).\n\nWait, in the condition, in Java it's a[que.peek()] which is the value at the top of the stack. Que is the stack array, so que(top) gives the index in a, so the value is a( que(top) )\n\nSo in the condition, the value at the current index is compared to the top's a value. \n\nInside the loop:\n\nwe pop the top, ind is that popped value (ind = que(top) before decrement top?)\n\nWait in code:\n\n    ind = que(top)\n\n    top = top -1\n\n    rightl(ind) = index - ind - 1 \n\nThen after that, inner loop continues until that condition is not met.\n\nThen, pushing the current index (index) into the stack:\n\nque(top+1) = index \n\ntop = top+1 \n\nThen, increment index (i.e., index = index +1 )\n\nWait, in the Java code, index is first used, then pushed, then ++.\n\nWait the Java's que.push(index++) is equivalent to pushing index, then index increases by 1. So in Fortran: que(top+1) = index; top = top+1; then index = index+1.\n\nWait in the loop:\n\nindex starts at 0, then in the loop: the inner loop pops as needed, then push current index (which is say 0), then index increments.\n\nWait the Java code uses que.push(index++), so after pushing the index, it becomes index+1. So in FORTRAN:\n\nbefore pushing, the current index is used, then after, we do index=index +1.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nAfter manipulating the inner loop:\n\npush:\n\ntop = top +1\n\nque(top) = index\n\nthen index = index +1 \n\nWait but in the code structure:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\n        do\n            ! process until loop condition is done ...\n\n            exit when ... condition no longer holds\n\n        end do \n\nHmm. Let me outline the first loop:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nindex starts at 0, and while index < N,\n\n    while top >0 and a(que(top)) > a(index):\n\n        pop the ind (take que(top), then top--, then set rightl[ind] = index - ind -1\n\n    then, push index into the stack (que(top+1)= index, top +=1 )\n\n    then increment index by 1 ( index = index +1 )\n\n    but how to capture the exit condition for the outer loop?\n\nAlternatively, using a do while loop:\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nindex =0\n\ndo while (index < n)\n\n    do while ( (top >0) .and. ( a( que(top) ) > a(index) ) )\n\n        ind = que(top)\n\n        top = top-1\n\n        rightl( ind ) = index - ind -1\n\n    end do\n\n    top = top +1\n\n    que( top ) = index\n\n    index = index +1\n\nend do\n\nWait but that's the way I think.\n\nWait in the Java code inside the first loop:\n\nInside the while (index <N):\n\n  while ( condition ) {...} \n\n  que.push(index++) \n\nWait the push is push, then index increments. The que is pushed to the stack before incrementing index.\n\nIn my fortran code above, the que is pushed as current index, then after that, index increases.\n\nYes, which is the same.\n\nSo this loop should handle the first part.\n\nThen, after that, the rest of the code processes the stack leftovers for rightl.\n\nWhat comes next in the Java code:\n\nAfter the first loop (where index went through all N elements):\n\nwhile ( !que.isEmpty() ) { \n\n    ind = que.poll();\n\n    rightl[ind] = N - ind -1 \n\n}\n\nThis is for elements which never had a smaller element to their right. Their right contribution is from their position up to end.\n\nIn Fortran:\n\nWhile the stack is not empty (top >0):\n\n    ind = que(top)\n\n    top = top -1 \n\n    rightl( ind ) = ( N - ind -1 )\n\nSo a loop:\n\ndo while ( top >0 )\n\n    ind = que(top)\n\n    top = top -1 \n\n    rightl( ind ) = N - ind -1\n\nend do \n\nNow moving on to the second part for leftl. \n\nThe code for leftl starts with setting index to N-1 (Java's last index)\n\nThen while index >=0:\n\n    while (the que is not empty and a[que.top()] >a[index]):\n\n        pop, set leftl = ind - index -1 \n\n    pushes index, then index decreases.\n\nWait:\n\nWait in the second loop (for leftl):\n\nindex initialized to N-1 (Java's ), then in the loop:\n\n index starts at N-1, while index >=0:\n\nloop while que not empty and a[que.Peek()] > a[index]:\n\n    pop the ind, then set leftl as ind - index -1 ?\n\nWait the Java code:\n\n        while (!que.isEmpty() && a[que.peek()] > a[index]) {\n            int ind = que.poll();\n            leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n        }\n        que.push(index--);\n\n        index's value is then decreased by 1.\n\nWait in java, it's que.push(index--) \n\nWhich means push index, then index decreases by 1. So after the push, index is current value minus 1.\n\nSo in fortran:\n\nthe loop processing is:\n\nInside the outer while loop (index >=0):\n\ndo while ( (top >0) .and. (a( que(top) ) > a(index) ) )\n\n    ind = que(top)\n\n    top = top-1 \n\n    leftl(ind) = ind - index -1 \n\nloop. Then, push the index into the stack:\n\ntop = top +1 \n\nque(top) = index \n\nThen, index = index -1 \n\nWait, because in the Java code, after the while loop, it does que.push( index-- ) which is equivalent to push the current index, then subtracts 1. \n\nThus, in Fortran, the code is:\n\nafter popping:\n\npush:\n\nque(top+1) = index\n\ntop +=1\n\nthen index becomes index -1 \n\nWait the code inside the index >=0 loop:\n\n          do while ( (top >0) .and. ( a( que(top) ) > a(index) ) )\n\n            ind = que(top)\n\n            top = top-1 \n\n            leftl(ind) = ind - index -1 \n\n          end do \n\n          top = top +1 \n\n          que( top ) = index \n\n          index = index -1 \n\nThen the outer loop continues (while index >=0).\n\nWait but the outer loop is looped via while (index >=0 ), so perhaps using a do while loop again.\n\nAlternatively, starting with:\n\nindex = N -1 \n\ndo while ( index >=0 )\n\n   process inner loop ...\n\n   process push and index decrement \n\n   continue the loop \n\nEnd do. \n\nHmm, perhaps that can be set up similarly.\n\nThen, after processing all the indices, the remaining que elements (those for which there's nothing smaller on left) are handled:\n\nwhile (que not empty):\n\n    ind = que.pop() \n\n    leftl [ind] = ind - (index) -1 \n\nWait, looking at Java code:\n\n        while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n            int ind = que.poll();\n            leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n        }\n\nWait wait, wait. Wait here in Java after that loop, the code after processing the leftl.\n\nWait in Java after the index reaches N-1's end:\n\nthe remaining entries in the stack are those for which no element is smaller to the left. \n\nSo for those, we set leftl[ind] = ind - (index after...) but in the code:\n\nWait after pushing and all the elements in the stack after processing the indexes from N-1 down to 0: what's the value of index when exiting the loop? \n\nWait in Java's code, during the processing of index from N-1 down to 0, the loop's condition is while (index >=0). \n\nEventually, when exiting the loop, the index will be -1.\n\nThen in the processing for the remaining stack elements:\n\nfor each ind in que_POLL():\n\n    leftl[ind] = ind - index -1 \n\nWait the index at this point would be -1 (since the last iteration's push is done with index-1?)\n\nWait let's see. Let's track the index variable. \n\nSuppose in the final iteration of the inner loop when index is 0:\n\nProcess inner loop that could possibly pop.\n\nThen push index into queue. \n\nThen index is reduced to -1 (since index = index-1 (0-1)).\n\nHence, when we reach the while ( ! que.isEmpty() ) loop after the first leftl's processing:\n\nAt that point, the index is already -1.\n\nWait the code for the leftl after the loop is:\n\n        while (!que.isEmpty()) {\n            int ind = que.poll();\n            leftl[ind] = ind - index - 1;\n        }\n\nWait, in Java, the code after the loop for index goes down to 0 would have set index to -1 (due to the decrements). So when calculating leftl [ind] = ind - index -1, which with index being -1:\n\nind - (-1) -1 \n\n= ind +1 -1 = ind? No. Wait wait:\n\nWait the formula in the Java code:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - index -1 \n\nSuppose when the que is processed after the loop, the index is -1 (after the last iteration), so:\n\nleftl[ind] = ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind.\n\nWait that can't be right. Wait that would mean that for the remaining elements, their left contribution is ind - (previous index) ?\n\nHmm, this might be a mistake in the code, but perhaps that's how the original code is written. Since I'm translating, I have to follow as per the Java code.\n\nIn Fortran, for that part:\n\nAfter the outer loop (index went down to -1), the que is again processed:\n\n        do while ( top >0 )\n\n            ind = que(top)\n\n            top=top-1 \n\n            leftl(ind) = ind - index -1\n\n        end do \n\nWait index at this point is -1, so the value ind - (-1) -1 = ind +1.\n\nWait the formula in the code's comment said that leftl is calculating the left side. For elements that have not had any smaller to their left, their contribution would be ind's distance from the left end? Hmm, perhaps I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, check the original code again. Let me re-examine the Java code's leftl processing.\n\nThe code first processes from N-1 downto 0:\n\nfor each index, we compare against the stack. While stack has elements and a[stack top] is greater than current a[index], those elements in the stack have their left side as current index and ind.\n\nFor the elements remaining in the stack, when the stack is popped, their leftl is set to ind - index -1, where index is now N after? Wait, in the code of leftl's remaining part:\n\nWait, the index variable after the loop is -1 (because we have processed down to 0, then push to stack, then index becomes -1, and then the loop stops).\n\nTherefore, in the code:\n\nLeftl for those remains is set to ind - ( -1 ) -1 = ind +1 -1 = ind, but the remaining elements are the ones which are on the stack. \n\nWait this might be a mistake, but according to the code, it is so.\n\nWait perhaps the code is working on the left as the reverse. \n\nIn the right processing, for those elements with nothing smaller to the right, the rightl is set to N - ind -1 (total elements to the right including itself?)\n\nHmm, perhaps the left's case is similar: the elements left on stack would have their left contribution being ind's position from the start. \n\nWait, in any case, I have to translate exactly.\n\nNow, moving forward.\n\nFinally, after building left and right arrays, the code calculates the answer:\n\nans += a[i]*(left+1)*(right+1)\n\nIn Fortran, since arrays a are 0-based in this setup.\n\nThen, after all, print ans.\n\nNow, for the code structure in Fortran:\n\nFirst, read N.\n\nallocate arrays.\n\nInitialize the leftl and rightl arrays to 0? Or are they initially zero?\n\nIn the Java code, rightl and leftl are initialized as 0 arrays, because in Java, int arrays are initialized to 0. \n\nSo in Fortran, when declaring with allocatable arrays, they need to be initialized to 0 first. \n\nOtherwise, their initial values are undefined, which might be a problem.\n\nSo after allocating, we have to set them to 0.\n\nE.g., after allocation:\n\nleftl =0\n\nrightl =0 \n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nThe code outline would be:\n\nprogram atcoder_agc005_b\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, index, topp , ind \n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, leftl, rightl, que \n\n    !

Wait the que in code starts with topp starting at 0 (initially before any elements), so the que's capacity is at least N elements. The array for que needs to be size >= N.\n\nI declared que as dimension 0 to N, which is N+1 elements. That's okay.\n\nWait in the declarations:\n\nallocate( que(0:N) )\n\nso indices from 0 through N (inclusive) = N+1 elements. \n\nBut in code, top was initialized to 0, and the top can go up to N elements as maximum. So when pushing, when topp is N-1, adding one to N is okay. \n\nWait no: if the stack has N elements, then topp can go up to N. So the array starting at 0. So yes, que(0:N) can hold up to N+1 elements. \n\nAlternatively, in the Java code, the stack's maximum size is N elements, so the FORTRAN array que can be of size N with indices 1-based? \n\nWait let me think: if I use que(1:N), and topp starting at 0 (meaning empty), then pushing to que(1), increment topp to 1. \n\nWait then perhaps using 1-based arrays for que would be better, to avoid confusion. Let me think.\n\nAlternative approach for the stack (que):\n\n- declare que as (1: N), with variable topp starting at 0 (because when topp is zero, no elements). \n\nThen pushing and popping would refer to que(1) as the first element.\n\nWait modifying:\n\nDeclare:\n\ninteger :: topp \n\ndimension, allocatable :: que(1:N)\n\nThen:\n\nInitially topp =0 \n\npush: top = top +1 \n\nque(top) = x \n\npop: que(top) \n\ntop = top-1 \n\nThis would be better. \n\nPerhaps that's easier.\n\nWait returning to the original code's variables.\n\nIn Java code, que is used as a stack with push (add to front?), but operations in code are just treated as a stack with usual push/pop.\n\nSo, in Fortran, the que array can be 1-based, with topp being the number of elements (eg, elements que(1) to que(top) are the stack's elements.\n\nWait let me rework the stack variables:\n\nInstead of starting with topp as 0, use topp as the current top index (the element count). \n\nWait:\n\nFirst approach: \n\nque is array (1:N)\n\ninteger topp =0 ( meaning, empty).\n\nTo push:\n\n topp = topp +1 \n\n que(topp) = value \n\nTo pop:\n\nvalue = que(topp)\n\n topp = topp -1 \n\nSo, let me redo the code with this style.\n\nThis way the stack indexes can start at 1.\n\nThus, there is no offsets and easier.\n\nSo:\n\nIn the rightl processing:\n\n    !*** First loop for rightl\n    index =0 \n    do while (index <N )\n\n        !*** Inner loop: pop until stack is smaller \n        !*** note: topp is the current top's position. \n\n        !*** So while ( topp>0 ) and condition \n        !*** note not topp >=1 ?\n\n        !*** yes. For topp being the count. \n        !*** So:\n\n        !*** Checking:\n\n        !*** if topp>0 (elements present)\n        !***  and a( que(top) ) > current a?\n        !*** que(1) to que(top) are the elements.\n\n        !*** So:\n\n        !*** loop:\n\n        !*** it's equivalent to:\n\n        do while ( topp >0 .and. a( que( topp ) ) > a(index) )\n\n            ind = que(topp) \n\n            topp = topp -1 \n\n            rightl( ind ) = index - ind -1 \n\n        end do \n\n        !*** Now push current index \n\n        !*** topp increases first?\n\n        !*** push:\n\n        !*** new entry is que( topp+1 ) = index \n\n        !*** need to increment topp first?\n\n        !*** so:\n\n        topp = topp +1 \n\n        que(topp) = index \n\n        !*** increment index \n\n        index = index +1 \n\n    end do \n\nWait in this way. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly in other parts.\n\nIf this is done, then the stack can be handled with variables topp starting at 0.\n\nNow, since this may avoid problems when using 0-based array for que.\n\nNow, going back, let's recode:\n\nThis will replace all previous que TOP variable as the number of elements, and que array as 1-based.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nInitial variables:\n\ninteger :: N \n\ninteger, allocatable, dimension(:) :: a, leftl, rightl, que \n\nWith the que having size N. \n\nWe need to allocate que( N ), since the maximum stack size is N elements. \n\nSo the code for the que would be:\n\nAllocate (que(1:N) )\n\nthen topp is initialized to zero.\n\nSo here's the revised code outline:\n\n(_ALLOCATE QUE AS 1-TO N)\n\nallocate( que(1:N) )\n\nFor rightl processing:\n\nindex =0\n\ntopp =0 \n\ndo while ( index <N )\n\n    !pop elements ... \n\n    do while ( topp >0 .and. a(que(top)) > a(index) )\n\n    etc. \n\nThis would be better. \n\nNow, going back, to avoid errors with the zero-based array:\n\nLet me proceed with this approach, but in code. \n\nTherefore, recoding all the stack handling.\n\nThe revised code:\n\n\u2014 \n\nHere's the code in Fortran with these changes.\n\nWait, the final code would be something like this:\n\nNow, proceeding to rewrite the code step-by-step with these changes.\n\nThe full translation would have:\n\n...\n\n    !*** Declare variables\n\n    !*** using topp to track the current number of elements in the stack. \n\n    !*** So for the stack que, using topp as the top index. \n\nNow, Rewriting the code:\n\nStarting with variable declarations:\n\nThe stack que allocated as 1:N.\n\n    !*** Preparation and memory allocations: \n\n    !*** Read N \n\n    !*** Read N \n    read(*,*) N \n\n    !*** allocate arrays \n\n    !*** a is size 0 to N-1 \n\n    allocate( a(0:N-1) ) \n\n    !*** left and right arrays same \n\n    allocate( leftl(0:N-1 ), rightl(0:N-1) )\n\n    !*** queue array: 1-based up to N elements \n\n    allocate( que(1: N) )\n\n    !*** Initialize stack pointers to zero \n\n    !*** for right part\n\n    !*** First process rightl \n\n    !*** Initial reset of topp \n\n    !*** Starting with topp =0 \n\n    !*** Read the a elements \n\n    !*** Read the numbers \n\n    !*** (this part is the same as before )\n\n    !*** Read the a array \n\n    !*** (wait the code reading a is done after allocations \n\n    !*** since they are declared after N is read \n\n    !*** so the original part:\n\n    !*** after reading N:\n\n    !*** read input \n\n    !*** the a array is read as:\n\n    !*** do i=0,N-1 \n\n    !***    read \u2026 \n\n    !*** then proceed. \n\n    !*** Then set leftl and rightl to zero:\n\n    !*** leftl =0 \n\n    !*** rightl =0 \n\n    !*** now processing rightl \n\n    !*** first loop:\n\n    !*** index=0 \n\n    !*** initially, topp is zero. \n\n    !*** to process:\n\n    !*** first do while loop:\n\nSo the first loop:\n\n    !*** processing rightl \n\n    !*** Initialize topp to 0 \n\n    !*** reset queue \n\n    !*** topp =0 \n\n    !*** index=0 \n\n    !*** Enter the loop \n\n    !*** First():\n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** rightl processing \n\n    !*** For first loop. \n\n    !*** code for right part \n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** rightl loop \n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** now in code: \n\n    !*** Initialize topp =0 \n\n    !*** then loop starts \n\n    !*** code:\n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** \n\nWait proceeding to code each part step by step.\n\nHere comes the Fortran CODE.\n\nNow, in code after allocation, the first part is reading a:\n\n do i =0,N-1 \n\n    read(*,*) a(i) \n\n end do \n\nLeftl and rightl assigned 0:\n\nleftl(:) = 0 \n\nrightl(:) =0 \n\n\u2014 \n\nProceeding to rightl processing:\n\nFirst:\n\n !*** rightl processing loop \n\n !*** first loop \n\n  \n top =0 \n\n index =0 \n\n do while ( index < N )\n\n !*** process \n\n !*** process the inner loop \n\n !*** while not empty and ... \n\n !*** \n\n !*** \n\n !*** \n\n !*** \n\n    !*** process the elements in the queue \n\n    !*** loop: \n\n    !*** check while topp>0 and a( que(top) ) > a[index ] \n\n    !*** loop until fulfilled \n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** the queue is not empty (topp>=1 )\n\n    !*** \n\n    !*** this loop \n\n    do while( ( top >0 ) .and.
