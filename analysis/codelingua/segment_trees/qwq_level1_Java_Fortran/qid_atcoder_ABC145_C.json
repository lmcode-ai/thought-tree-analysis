    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. The program reads N points from the input, each with x and y coordinates. Then it calculates the average distance between all pairs of points. \n\nFirst, looking at the structure: there's a main class with a main method, and a helper method 'dist' to calculate the distance between two points. The main method reads N, then N pairs of integers for the positions. It then loops over all pairs of points (i and j), skips when i equals j, calculates the distance between them, sums all distances, and finally prints the average (sum divided by N).\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Fortran doesn't have classes like Java, so I'll need to write a program with modules or just a main program. Since the code is straightforward, a single program should suffice here. Let's start.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read N and then the coordinates. In Fortran, variables must be declared before use. So maybe start with the program name and declarations. The input comes from standard input, so we'll use a read statement. For dynamic arrays, since N is read first, we can use allocatable arrays. \n\nThe points are stored in a 2D array. Let's declare an array of size N by 2, integers. Wait, in Fortran, the first index is the dimension. Wait no, Fortran arrays are declared as, say, pos(N,2) where rows are first. Wait, in Java it's new int[N][2], so in Fortran, the first dimension is N, and the second is 2. So the declaration would be like integer, allocatable :: pos(:,:) then allocate(pos(N,2)).\n\nThe distance function in Java uses Math.sqrt, which in Fortran is SQRT. The variables x1,y1,x2,y2 are integers. The formula is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2). The function in Fortran would be a function that takes four integers and returns a real number (double precision in Fortran is either REAL*8 or use real(kind=8)).\n\nWait, in the code, the distance function is called, and the results are added to 'sum', which is a double in Java. In Fortran, sum should be declared as a real number. Let me note that.\n\nThe loops: the main loop is over i from 1 to N (but in Java it starts at 0, so need to adjust indices). Wait, in Java, the loops are from 0 to N-1. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless we use an explicit lower bound. Hmm, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Wait, in Java, for the positions, pos[i][0] and pos[i][1] correspond to the x and y of the ith point (0-based for N elements). So in Fortran, if we use indices from 1 to N, then the first element is at 1, so that's okay.\n\nWait, in the Fortran code, the variables i and j would loop from 1 to N. So the code for the loops would similar, but with 1-based indices.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Read N. So, read(*,*) n\n\n2. Allocate the array pos, size n x 2 (integer). \n\n3. Read the positions. Loop over i from 1 to N.\n\n   Read each x and y into pos(i,1) and pos(i,2).\n\nAlternatively, read all in a loop.\n\n4. Compute sum. Initialize sum to 0.0.\n\n   Loop i from 1 to N, loop j from 1 to N.\n\n   If i == j, then skip. Else, add the distance between pos(i,1), pos(i,2) and pos(j,1), pos(j,2).\n\n   Then after loops, compute average sum / (N*N - N) ? Wait no. Wait in Java code: the loops are i and j from 0 to N-1. The code loops over all pairs except (i,i). So the total number of terms is N*(N-1). The sum averages over N? Wait in the code, the output is (sum)/(N). \n\nWait let me check the original code. The sum is the total of all distances between every pair of points except when i=j. Then the average is sum divided by N. But wait, that can't be. Wait the way the code is written: the loops are for i and j from 0 to N-1, but for each i and j, if they are the same, skip adding the distance. So, the total terms are N*(N-1). The sum is over all these terms and then they divided by N. So the average is sum divided by N. Wait that's not the average between all pairs. The average of all pairwise distances (excluding same pairs) is sum/(N*(N-1)), but the code is average over N, so perhaps it's different. Wait the original problem, perhaps it's a specific question? Well, assuming that the code is correct as given. So in Fortran, the logic must be the same.\n\nSo the Fortran code needs to compute the sum of all distances between any two different points (regardless of order?), but adding both i,j and j,i. e.g., for two points A and B, the distance is counted twice (i=A,j=B, i=B,j=A). Or wait, in the loops, for i and j from 0 to N, and for each pair (i,j) where i != j, it adds the distance. Therefore, for each unordered pair (A,B), the distance is added twice (once as i=A,j=B and once as i=B,j=A). Therefore the total is N*(N-1), so sum is all pairwise distances *2. Then when divided by N, that's (sum/(N*(N-1))) * 2*N. Wait maybe the problem itself has a particular setup. Anyway, the code is as given, so I just need to translate it correctly.\n\nSo in Fortran code, the loops will again iterate i from 1 to N and j from 1 to N. When i ==j skip, else sum += distance. The same as before.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nStart with program name, e.g. atcoder_ABC145_C.\n\nThen, variables:\n\ninteger :: N\n\nreal(kind=8) :: sum_d, average\n\ninteger, allocatable :: pos(:,:)\n\nThen, read N, allocate, read data.\n\nNow functions: the distance function. Since Fortran is procedural, we can define a function.\n\nFUNCTION dist(x1, y1, x2, y2) result(res)\n    integer, intent(in) :: x1, y1, x2, y2\n    real(kind=8) :: res\n    real(kind=8) :: dx, dy\n    dx = x1 - x2\n    dy = y1 - y2\n    res = sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)\nEND FUNCTION dist\n\nBut since functions in Fortran can be internal or external. Alternatively, use an inline computation, but better to structure it as a function.\n\nAlternatively, write it as an inline calculation each time, but better to have a function.\n\nNow, step by step code:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC145_C\n    implicit none\n    integer :: N, i, j\n    real(kind=8) :: sum_d = 0.0d0, average\n    integer, allocatable :: pos(:,:)\n    \n    ! Read N\n    read(*,*) N\n    \n    ! Allocate the array\n    allocate(pos(N,2))\n    \n    ! Read the positions\n    do i = 1, N\n        read(*,*) pos(i,1), pos(i,2)\n    end do\n    \n    ! Compute the sum\n    do i = 1, N\n        do j = 1, N\n            if (i == j) cycle\n            sum_d = sum_d + dist(pos(i,1), pos(i,2), pos(j,1), pos(j,2))\n        end do\n    end do\n    \n    ! Compute average and print it\n    average = sum_d / dble(N)\n    print *, average\n    \ncontains\n    ! Function to calculate distance\n    real(kind=8) function dist(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n        integer, intent(in) :: x1,y1,x2,y2\n        real(kind=8) :: dx, dy\n        dx = x1 - x2\n        dy = y1 - y2\n        dist = sqrt( dx**2 + dy**2 )\n    end function dist\nend program atcoder_ABC145_C\n\nWait, in the average calculation, divide the sum by N. Since sum is a real, but N is integer. Need to use dble(N) to convert to double.\n\nNow, let me check the function. The sum_d starts at 0.0d0 (double precision). The distance function returns a real(kind=8). The variables in the loops: i and j go from 1 to N, with i and j being integers, so their equality check is okay.\n\nTesting the code structure: the contains statement allows the function to be inside the program. That's valid in Fortran 90/95. Alternatively, can have the function declared before the program, but the contains is better.\n\nWait, the 'contains' is used inside the program block. So the function is internal.\n\nI think this should work. Let me make sure all variables are declared.\n\nWait, in the declaration part:\n\nsum_d is initialized to 0.0d0, which is good. \n\nThe 'cycle' in the inner loop skips when i == j. The calculation of distance is correct, taking dx squared plus dy squared to get the squared distance, then the sqrt.\n\nThe print statement uses print *, average to output the result. \n\nThis should replicate the Java code's behavior. Let me check data types again:\n\nIn Java, the positions are integers. In Fortran, they are also stored as integers, so that's correct. The distance function's parameters take integers as input, which is okay since the subtraction and squaring would still work.\n\nAnother thing: In Fortran, the order of the loop: for each i, the code loops over all j except i, so the inner loop goes from 1 to N each time.\n\nYes. \n\nI think this should be correct. Let me check for any possible mistakes:\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- 0-based vs 1-based indices: the original code uses 0-based (c is from 0 to N-1). The Fortran code uses 1-based, so the indices would be correct as per the loop from 1 to N. Since the problem's input is just N points, the start index doesn't affect the calculation of distances, only that all points are processed.\n\n- The division by N: The sum is the total over all ordered pairs (excluding i=j), which is N*(N-1) terms. Then dividing by N gives (total distance)/(N), but that's what the original code does, so it's correctly replicated here.\n\nYes, so this should be correct."
