But in Fortran, perhaps we can track the maximum b and keep track of the corresponding a[i], instead of using a TreeMap. Alternatively, since we just need to track the element with maximum b, perhaps it's easier to track variables:\n\n- the maxB: initialise as lowest possible or zero, but only consider those with b !=0 (since only elements not divisible by 10 have a b value)\n- variable to track which index has that maxB.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the 5 elements, calculate the b (if exists), and track maxB and the index with that maxb.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let me start by understanding what the Java code does. Hmm, it looks like it's solving some kind of problem where you have 5 numbers, and you process them to calculate an answer. Let's go through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code imports Scanner and TreeMap. The main method reads five integers. Then for each of them, it computes the remainder when divided by 10 (r[i]). If the remainder isn't zero, it calculates a value b = 10 - r[i] and adds it to a TreeMap where the key is b and the value is a[i]. \n\nThen, the code checks if the TreeMap is empty. If it is, that means all numbers were multiples of 10, so they just add all to get the answer and print.\n\nIf there are entries in the TreeMap, it takes the last key (so the largest b?), which would correspond to the largest rounding needed, right? Wait, TreeMap stores keys in natural order, so the last key is the highest one. Wait, but the entries are b's equal to 10 - remainder. Since remainder can be from 1-9, so b would be 1-9. Wait, if a number ends with 9, then b would be 1. For endings like 1, b is 9. So TreeMap stores them in sorted order. The largest b is when remainder is smallest. So the last key in TreeMap would be the biggest b, but that's more timing in the rounding?\n\nHmm, but the code then gets the value map.get(map.lastKey()), which is the a[i] with the largest b. Wait, but TreeMap's last key is the largest b. So the entry with the largest needed addition to reach the next 10. But why take that element?\n\nThen, the code finds the index of that last element. After that, the loop sums all other elements, but each is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 (since if remainder isn't 0, then adding (10 - r[i]) brings it to a multiple of 10). But for the element at idx (the one with the maximum b), they just add it as is. So the idea is to not round that one to the nearest 10? \n\nWait, let me think about the problem. The code seems to be calculating the minimal sum where all numbers except one are rounded up to the nearest ten, but including their remainder? Wait no, rounding up. Or maybe the opposite? Let me parse the logic again.\n\nWait, here'a a breakdown:\n\nThe problem probably involves choosing which number not to round up so that the total is minimized. So when you have numbers like, for example, 15, 22, 33, etc., each needs an additional 5, 8, 7 to the next ten. However, you can choose one of them not to round, so you keep its original value, and the others are rounded up. But the code picks the number with the largest 'b' (which is the smallest remainder?), so why?\n\nWait, in Java code:\n\nThey compute for each a[i], the remainder r[i] = a[i]%10.\n\nIf r is not zero, then b is 10 - r. So for 15%10=5, so b would be 5. Wait 10 -5=5. So that entry would be b=5 for a number like 15.\n\nSo, for each a[i], if it's not divisible by 10, they compute how much it needs to round up to the next multiple of 10 (since if r is 5, then 15 +5 =20). So the amount added here is b. But in the code, the TreeMap's keys are the b. So, when they take the maximum key (since the TreeMap is sorted), the corresponding a[i] would be the one requiring the smallest amount to round up. Because the key is (10 - r), so higher keys mean lower remaining. So the maximum key corresponds to the number with the smallest remainder, which when not being rounded up, saves the most time (since the b is the time to reach next 10, so the max B is when remainder is smallest. By not rounding that number, we save that B to pay later. Because when we add that number in its original value, it's better than adding it rounded up. Since adding the original value instead of adding the B.\n\nWait, the algorithm here is: find all the numbers that are not multiples of 10. Among them, pick the one with the largest \"b\" (because that corresponds to least required to round it), so that when you don't round it, you can save that b from being added. Since the code says, for the element with the last key (which has the largest b) it will add it as is. \n\nThe goal must be to choose to not round the number which requires the smallest amount to reach the next ten (since its remainder is largest, but wait no, the key 'b' is 10 - r. So r = 0 would not be in the TreeMap. For r=1, b is 9. For r=9 (which is remainder, need 1 to get to 10). The b is 1 here. So then the TreeMap's keys are ascending. The largest key corresponds to the smallest remainder. For example:\n\nNumbers 28 (r=8, b=2), 31 (r=1, b=9). So the key 9 is the max. So the number 31 has this. So choosing it as the one to not round, since saving the 9 required to make it reach 40, but instead just adding 31 instead of 40. So the total saved is 9, which is the largest possible saving. Thus, the minimal total is achieved by picking the element with the maximum 'b' as the one not to round. Because that element's b is the amount you would add if you did round it, so by not rounding, you skip adding that B. So indeed.\n\nSo the algorithm works as follows:\n\n- For numbers not divisible by 10, compute how much they need to round up (b is that value)\n- Choose the one with largest b (so that saving b is biggest) to not round, and add the others rounded.\n- So in the code:\n    - if all numbers are multiples of 10, sum all.\n    - else, select the element with the largest b, which is in the lastKey. Or is it? Because the TreeMap is ordered so the keys are in ascending order. Wait, TreeMap is a sorted map by key order. So the lastKey is the largest key. So yes, the max b is the last key.\n\nTherefore the steps for translating:\n\nNow we need to replicate this logic in Fortran.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nIn Java: 5 array integers. In fortran, we can use arrays. The code uses a and r arrays of size 5.\n\nTreeMap is a sorted map of key (b) to value (a[i]). But in Fortran, there's no built-in TreeMap. So might need to handle this manually.\n\nHmm. The TreeMap in Java is used to find the item with the maximum b (since its keys are sorted, and the last key is the largest). So in a way, the TreeMap here is just a data structure to hold all the (b, value) pairs, and then select the one with maximum b.\n\nBut in Fortran, perhaps we can track the maximum b and keep track of the corresponding a[i], instead of using a TreeMap.\n\nAlternatively, since we just need to track the element with maximum b, perhaps it's easier to track variables:\n\n- the maxB: initialise as lowest possible or zero, but only consider those with b !=0 (since only elements not divisible by 10 have a b value)\n- variable to track which index has that maxB.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the 5 elements, calculate the b (if exists), and track maxB and the index with that maxb.\n\nThis approach might be better, as it would avoid needing complex data structures.\n\nSo steps to do in Fortran:\n\nRead 5 integers. Loop through each to calculate r(i) = a mod10.\n\nthen for each element not divisible by 10 (i.e. r(i) !=0 ), compute b =10 - r(i).\n\nWe can create an array of the b's and the indices where they exist. But to track the maximum b:\n\nInitialize max_b to -1, the index of the element with maximum b. Or, suppose:\n\nInitialize the max_b as 0, and then for each element where r(i)!=0, we compare b with current max.\n\nWait, for each element, if it has r(i)!=0:\n\n    b is 10 - r(i).\n\n    if b > current_max_b, then we update current_max_b and note the index. If b is same as current_max_b, then have to decide (but since TreeMap would take the latest insertion?), but in Java, the TreeMap.map() stores entries sorted by key. When multiple same keys, the put overwrites? Wait, since TreeMap keys are unique. So when two a's have the same b, the code will store the latest a?\n\nWait, original code's TreeMap is used by putting \"map.put(b, a[i]);\". So if two numbers have the same b, the later one will override the existing key's value. So the last occurrence wins. Because when putting key b again, with a new a[i], that will replace the previous entry.\n\nSo, if there are multiple a elements with the same b value, the last one (since elements are added in order from 0 to 4) is the one stored in the TreeMap. Because the TreeMap is using put which replaces existing keys.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nSuppose the first element has a value 11 (r=1, b=9)\n\nThen another element has 21, same r=1, so when you put b=9 again, the map will keep the latest a[i]. \n\nSo in the code's case, when the map's lastKey (which has the highest b) has the value of the last a[i] that had that maximum b.\n\nBut in Fortran, if I track the max and index, then each time a new b is equal to current max, need to check whether this is part of the sequence and track the index for the last occurrence. Because otherwise, the maximum b may have multiple elements, but the one with index 4 (the last one) would be the correct one.\n\nHmm, but perhaps it's easier in Fortran to store all the relevant b and indices, but since there are only five elements, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the loop:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmaxb = -1 (so any b will be larger)\n\nmaxindex = -1 \n\nThen for each element i from 1 to 5 (assuming 1-based, which in Fortran arrays are 1-based unless specified):\n\na(i) = read from input.\n\nr(i) = mod(a(i),10)\n\nif (r(i) /=0) then\n\n   b = 10 - r(i)\n\n   if (b > maxb) then\n\n      maxb = b\n\n      maxindex = i\n\n   else if (b == maxb) then \n\n      ! if same b, the later index will replace the previous maxindex, so updating is correct.\n\n      maxindex = i  ! because the code in Java, which stored the last in TreeMap because put would overwrite\n\n   end if \n\nend if \n\nThus, after processing all elements, if maxindex is still -1 (i.e., no elements with r!=0), then all are multiples of 10. \n\nWait, but in the code, if all a are divisible by 10, then all are added.\n\nSo in Fortran variables:\n\nWe can have:\n\ninteger :: a(5), r(5)\n\ninteger :: maxb = -1\n\ninteger :: maxidx = -1\n\nthen, in the loop:\n\ndo i=1,5\n\n   read the a's.\n\n   r(i) = mod(a(i), 10)\n\n   if (r(i) .ne.0) then \n\n      b = 10 - r(i)\n\n      if (b > maxb) then \n\n          maxb = b\n\n          maxidx = i\n\n      elseif (b == maxb) then \n\n          maxidx = i\n\n      end if \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nafter this:\n\nif (maxidx == -1) then \n\n   sum all a and output.\n\nElse \n\n   compute the answer by adding all except the maxidx, but for them, add their rounded value (add a( i) + (10 - r(i)), since to round up to next ten, or if already on... oh, but only those who have r not zero need adding (10 -r). So for numbers not in maxidx and with r not zero: add the rounded value. But others (those with mod 10 0) can just be added as is.\n\nWait, but the code also includes the possibility: when a number is divisible by 10 (r=0), which isn't in the TreeMap. So in the Fortran code:\n\nThe logic in the loop after is:\n\nans =0 \n\nthen, loop over each element:\n\nif the index is not the maxidx, then:\n\n   if r(i) ==0: Then add a(i) to ans \n\n   else: add (a(i) + (10 - r(i))) to ans \n\nthen finally, add the a(maxidx) to ans.\n\nWait that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nans = 0 \n\ndo i=1,5\n\n   if (i .ne. maxidx) then \n\n       if (r(i) ==0 ) then \n\n           ans = ans + a(i)\n\n       else \n\n           ans = ans + a(i) + (10 -r(i))\n\n       end if \n\n   end if \n\nend do \n\nans = ans + a(maxidx) \n\nthen output ans.\n\nSo putting this all together in Fortran.\n\nNow, handling input:\n\nJava uses a scanner. Fortran reads with read(*,*) or something similar.\n\nThe variables for a would be an array of 5 elements, possibly declared as integer a(5).\n\nFirst read the five inputs:\n\nread(*,*) , and in Fortran the easiest way is to read them in a loop, or directly read into the array? Like:\n\nread(*,*) (a(i), i=1,5)\n\nYes.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nNow, putting the Fortran code.\n\nStart with module or just a program:\n\n_PROGRAM_\n\nBut in Free-form source:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC123_B\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer :: a(5), r(5), maxb, maxidx, ans, i, b, input_val \n\n   ! Initialize variables\n\n   maxb = -1\n\n   maxidx = -1 \n\n   ! Read input into a(1) to a(5)\n\n   read(*,*) (a(i), i=1,5)\n\n   ! process each element \n\n   do i=1,5\n\n      r(i) = mod(a(i),10)\n\n      if (r(i) .ne. 0 ) then \n\n          b= 10 - r(i)\n\n          if (b>maxb) then \n\n              maxb = b \n\n              maxidx =i \n\n          else if (b==maxb ) then \n\n              ! keep the later index \n\n              maxidx =i \n\n          end if \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   ! Compute ans \n\n   if (maxidx == -1 ) then \n\n      ! all are multiples of 10 \n\n      ans = sum(a(1:5))\n\n      print '(i0)', ans \n\n      stop \n\n   end if \n\n   ans =0 \n\n   do i=1,5 \n\n      if (i .ne. maxidx ) then \n\n          if (r(i) ==0 ) then \n\n              ans = ans +a(i)\n\n          else \n\n              ans = ans + (a(i) + (10 - r(i)) )\n\n          end if \n\n      end if \n\n   end do \n\n   ans = ans + a(maxidx)\n\n   print '(i0)', ans \n\nend program \n\nWait, testing possible edge cases.\n\nWait let me check: For example, when one element has remainder 0 (so in TreeMap it's not in), others have remainder.\n\nIf all elements except one (say the third, r(3)=5), but another has a higher b?\n\nWait another case:\n\nSample Input from code.\n\nSuppose the code had a case where two elements have same b. For instance, two elements both need 2 seconds to round up: their r is 8 and 8, then their b is 2 each. Then the later one would have the maxidx as the later.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose the elements are 10, 20, 35, 44,55.\n\nSo the r array: 0, 0,5 mod10 is 5 \u2192 r(3)=5, 4 mod4: 4. So r for fourth is 4 (44 mod 10 is4?), yes. 55 mod10 is5?\n\nWait 44 mod10 is4?\n\nWait 44 mod10 is 4, yes.\n\nWait for 44: the a[3] (if it's the 4th element, say a(4) =44, then r is 4. Then b =6 (10-4=6). \n\nSo among 35's r=5 \u2192 b=5? No, 10-5=5, so (wait 35 mod10 is5, so b=5.\n\nSo in a(4) with b=6, that's higher, so maxb would be 6 at the 4th element. \n\nSo when calculating, the maxelement is the 4th element, so that is added as is, and others are either 10 (r=0), their a is added, and for the rest, like the third (35) would have to be rounded (35 +5=40). The 55 mod10 is5 \u2192r=5, so need to be rounded up to60 (adding 5). \n\nThus, the sum would be 10+20 +40 (35) plus 60 (55) and add the 44 (original). Let me compute:\n\n10+20=30 +40=70 +60 (55 rounded up is 60) \u2192 130, plus 44 \u2192 total 174? Let's see if code in Java would have the same.\n\nWait according to the code:\n\nMax index is the item with b=6 (a[i] =44 which b is 6, the second highest? Or yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo in this case, the maxb is6, a(4) is 44. Thus, the code would sum the other elements except a(4):\n\nFor the first two (modifiable elements with mod10==0, remainders are zero, so add as is. Then the third element: 35, mod5\u22600. So it is processed as a[i] + (10-5)=40. The fifth element (55 mod10 is5 \u2192 10-5=5 \u2192 so the 55 becomes 55+5=60. \n\nAdding all except a(4) gives 10+20 + (35+5)=40 \u2192 +60 (from55) \u2192 total 10+20 is30 +40=70 +60 is 130 \u2192 plus the a(4)=44 \u2192 total 174. Which is correct.\n\nSo looks like the code works.\n\nNow, check the case where all elements are multiples of 10. For example:\n\n10, 20, 30,40,50\u2192 all r=0.\n\nThus, maxidx = -1 (since all r are zero), so the program sums them: 10+20+30+40+50=150.\n\nAnother case where one is not:\n\nLet's say 15, others are all multiples.\n\nThen for a1=15, r=5, b=5.\n\nOthers have r=0.\n\nThus, the maxidx is1.\n\nThus, ans will be:\n\nsum of elements except 15: (e.g,20+30+40+50 = 140, plus 15 \u2192 total 155?) \n\nWait no, the code would:\n\nans starts at0.\n\nFor each i not the maxidx:\n\nIf the element is a multiple of10, add it normally. The other elements (after removing a1) are 20 etc.\n\nFor i=2 (assuming a(2) is 20, r is0 \u2192 so add 20. i=3, etc, so all non-m.isHidden elements (other than the first, maxidx=1) except first, so they are added as is. Thus the sum of the others is 20+30+40+50 = 140. Then adding a(1)=15 gives 155.\n\nAlternatively, if you rounded the 15 would add 20 (15+5=20. But because the code chooses not to round that element (since it is the one with maxb=5 (since it's the only), the total is 20+30 etc plus15. So yes.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, for Fortran coding, I need to check some syntax.\n\nIn the code:\n\nsum(a(1:5)) would be correct in fortran for summing the array.\n\nPrint statements: the Fortran code uses print '(i0)' which should print as an integer. That's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default.\n\nSo indices 1-5 for the arrays a and r.\n\nWait, in the code written above, variables are:\n\na is declared as integer(5). The loop for i=1 to5, the remainder is stored in r(i), which is properly declared as integer array as well.\n\nWait, in the code above for Fortran:\n\nThe variables are declared correctly:\n\nvariables are all integers. \n\nmaxidx is initialized as -1 and remains thus only when there are no elements with remainders. So the condition \"if (maxidx ==-1)\" works.\n\nAnother possible edge case: all elements have remainders zero? Then yes, sum them directly.\n\nAnother case where two elements have same max b, latest one is picked. \n\nTesting in code.\n\nExample input: 21, 11 (since 21 mod10 is1, 10-1=9; 11 mod10 is1, same b=9). So elements 21 (i=1) and 11 (i=2) have same b. The maxb will be 9 (initialized as first occurrence i=1, then when i=2 (b also 9), so maxidx will be updated to 2. Thus the maxindex is 2 (so the second element is the chosen to be kept).\n\nAnother test case with the numbers 11, 21, 33,49,9:\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nNumbers: 11,21,33,49,9.\n\nTheir remainders: 1,1,3,9,9.\n\nSo:\n\nFor each:\n\n- 11: r=1 \u2192 b=9.\n\n-21: same \u2192 b=9.\n\n-33 mod10=3 \u2192 b=7.\n\n-49 mod10=9 \u2192 b=1.\n\nWait no, 49 mod10 is9 \u2192 b=1.\n\n9 mod10 is9 \u2192 same \u2192 b=1.\n\nThus, the first two elements have b of9. The maxb is 9.\n\nThe first element (i=1), then the next (i=2) also sets mi to 2.\n\nThus maxindex is 2.\n\nSo the element to keep is the 2nd one (21).\n\nThe other elements (except the second) are to be rounded up.\n\nLet me see the computation.\n\nThe kept element's value is 21.\n\nThe total ans will be:\n\nOther numbers:\n\nFirst element is 11 not chosen:\n\nb was9, not max anymore since max was at index 2, so the first (11) has r=1, so rounded up (11 \u2192 up to +9 gives 20). \n\nThird element (33's remainder 3, so b=7. Because it's not chosen, so added 33+7 =40.\n\nThe fourth (49) 49 \u219249 mod9? No, remainder is9. \u2192 b is1, so rounds to 50 when rounded. So adding 49+1=50. \n\nThe fifth element is 9 mod10 give 9 \u2192 remainder=9 \u2192 b=1. Not chosen, rounded as 9+1=10. Sum all but index2 (21):\n\n11 +9 rounds to 20 and 40 (third), 50 (fourth) and10 (fifth) \u2192 summing those would be 20+33? No wait:\n\nWait the first, third, fourth, fifth elements:\n\nelement1 (11): not chosen. since the kept is element2 (21). So for the first element:\n\nit's remainder is1\u22600 \u2192 add 11 + (10 -1)=20.\n\nelement3: 33 has r=3. so added 33+7=40.\n\nelement4 (49 \u2192r=9 \u2192 10-9=1. adding to become 50.\n\nelement5 (9 \u2192 r=9 \u2192 addition is1 \u2192 10.\n\nsum of other than element2 is 20 (11) +40 (33) +50 (49) +10 (9) \u2192 20+40 is 60 \u2192 60+50=110; +10=120.\n\nPlus the kept element2 (21) \u2192120+21 = 141. Is that correct?\n\nYes, because choosing the second element (21) which allows not having to round it (saves the 9 seconds compared to 21 rounded would be 30, so difference saved is 9. Whereas the previous element had the same b, so the choice between the first and second elements would make no difference in the sum. Because both the maxb is9, so choosing either the first or second as the kept, the result would be same. However, in our case, since the latest is chosen (second), but it doesn't matter because their b is the same. So the program would choose the second element, and the total is as calculated.\n\nTesting in code:\n\nElements after loop variables:\n\nmaxidx would be 2.\n\nThus ans would be sum of elements except 2.\n\nWait 11 (i=1):\n\nadded as 11+9 \u2192 20 \n\n33 (3rd) added40, 49 as50, 9 \u219210.\n\nTotal for those four is20 +40 \u219260, plus50 = 110 +10 \u2192120. Plus the 21 \u2192 total 141.\n\nThus correct.\n\nSo the Fortran code should work as intended.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWas maxb set to -1 and check maxidx == -1.\n\nYes.\n\nHandling the indices properly in loops (1 to5).\n\nYes.\n\nEdge case when all have remainders except one, but others have higher b?\n\nWait, in the code even if a number has no remainder (r=0), it is not put in the TreeMap, so they can't be considered. So the kept element must have a non-zero remainder, unless there are none (so all are multiples of 10).\n\nThus, the variables' initializations and logic should work.\n\nThus, I think the Fortran code is correct."
