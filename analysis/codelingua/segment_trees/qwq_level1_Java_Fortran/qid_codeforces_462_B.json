Wait in the while loop approach, it's more straightforward. So perhaps that would be better. Wait let me see the logic in the original code: In Java's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n\n   sort the array\n\n   compute change = min( cards[25].left, k - i )\n\n   ans += change * change \n\n   subtract change from the left of that card, then i += change-1 \n\n} The effect here is after the first iteration, the \"change\" steps are processed, so the remaining steps are (k - i) starts at k, and in that iteration, we take up to (k - i) steps. Then adding i by change-1, so after next iteration's i increases by 1, the total is i+change, which skips over the next (change-1) steps. Thus the total number of steps accounted for by each loop is change steps each time. So the same as doing in each iteration (loop in Java), a single processing of \"up to remaining steps\" (remaining = k - i) with the maximum possible card.",

Wait the algorithm loops as long as remaining>0. But when the sum of the counts is less than remaining, but the program has already counted the sum, but in the loop, once all counts are 0, the next \"change\" will be zero, and thus remaining cannot be reduced. So leading to infinite loop. Hmm. Therefore in the code, I need to add a condition that the remaining is only decremented when change is non-zero.

Wait in the for loop statement, it's a for( ;; i++) loop, but inside the loop body, you're modifying i. \n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose k=10, and the loop has arrived at i=5, but all the cards have their left values zero. (sum is 5, for example). Then:\n\nchange = Math.min(0, 10-5) \u2192 0\n\nans += 0 \u2192 no change. cards[25].left -=0 \u2192 no change. i += 0-1; \u2192 i becomes 5-1=4\n\nthen the for loop will increment i to 5 again (because the post-increment), so after the loop body, the i is set to 4 +1 \u2192 5 again. Wait the loop's iteration is: when processing the loop body, the code inside modifies the i variable, but the for-loop's increment is still executed. Wait no. The for loop's syntax is:\n\nfor(init; condition; increment) { ... } Thus, the increment is executed after the body, so the steps are:\n\nInitialize i=0. While (i <k) {\n\n   execute body, which may change i.\n\n   increment the i (i++)\n\n}\n\nWait no, the post increment occurs after the body, regardless of anything. Wait no. For loops work as follows:\n\nfor (init; cond; increment) {\n\n   statement(s)\n\n} The loop steps are:\n\ninit\n\nloop:\n\nif cond true \u2192 execute statements. then, execute increment. then back to top of loop. So in the code's loop in Java, i will be incremented after the code's body, even if it was changed inside. So in the example where i=5, change=0:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ninitial i before this loop iteration is 5. The condition is true (5<10). Body runs:\n\ni becomes 5 +0-1 =4. Then, after body, the post-increment happens (i++ \u2192 becomes 4+1=5 again. So next loop, the condition is (5 <10) \u2192 again true.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let me look at the Java code first. The main class is codeforces_462_B, and it's reading input from the user, processing it, and outputting an answer. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads two integers n and k, then a string s of length n. Then it counts the number of each character in the string. Each character's count is stored in an array of objects of a class c462b, which has a 'left' field. The class implements Comparable so that when they sort the array, it sorts by the 'left' value. The processing part loops k times, each time sorting the array to get the card with the most left, then takes as many as possible (either the remaining cards for that type or what's left of k steps), adds change squared to the answer, subtracts change from that card, and adjusts the loop counter. \n\nTranslating that into Fortran. First, Fortran doesn't have classes or objects like Java. So the c462b array needs to be something else. Since the main thing is an array of integers (the 'left' fields), and we need to sort them in decreasing order each time. \n\nSo for data structure: maybe an array of 26 integers (for each letter A-Z), initialized to zero. Then reading the string and counting each occurrence. \n\nThe next part is the loop over k iterations. But in Java's code, each iteration might process multiple cards. For example, when they take 'change' steps, they increase i by change. But in Fortran, loops are a bit different. Alternatively, the loop structure might need adjustment.\n\nWait, the code in Java's main loop is for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) but within, they adjust i by adding 'change -1' so that the next iteration skips some steps. That's a trick to simulate a loop that can process multiple increments in one step. Let me see how that works. The 'i' is incremented, but the total steps are controlled to add up to k, but each loop effectively chooses a 'change' steps to process then add i. Since change * change is being accumulated.\n\nAlternative way: maybe it can be considered as processing 'change' steps at once. The loop runs until some condition, but the approach here is to collect the maximum available each time, until k steps are done. Let me think differently. \n\nThe problem seems to be similar to choosing the card with the highest count, taking as much as possible (min of current card count and remaining steps). Each time you choose a card, the count is reduced. The total is the sum of (change)^2 each time you take change steps. \n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to sort the counts in descending order and process them in a greedy way. The code in Java is doing exactly that: each step, they sort the array of card counts (in c462b objects) so that the largest 'left' is at the end (since the comparator in the code returns left1 - left2, so that when sorted, smaller elements come first? Wait, the compareTo function in Java is for the Comparable interface where the return is a.compareTo(b) should return negative if a < b. Wait, in the compare function:\n\npublic int compareTo(Object o) {\n    return left - ((c462b) o).left;\n}\n\nWait, so comparing two objects a and b, a.compareTo(b) gives a.left - b.left. So in Java's sort, it will order the elements in natural order. So the array after sort becomes sorted in ascending order, from least to most? Wait, no. The return of a.compareTo(b) is negative, zero, or positive. So if a has less left than b, then a comes first. So the array after sort would have elements in order of increasing left. Thus the most \"left\" element is at the end (cards[25]) after sorting. Wait no, if it's in a list from 0 to 25, then when sorted in the natural order, the elements will be arranged so that 0 has the smallest left and 25 has the largest left. Wait, arrays in Java are sorted from 0 to N-1, and the comparator's arrangement determines that. Wait the default sort (Arrays.sort) orders the elements into ascending order based on the comparator, so the element with smaller left (because of the comparator's a - b gives their order) will come first. So, after sorting, the array is ordered from smallest to largest left. Wait no, the compare method is a.compareTo(b) which is a.left - b.left. So when comparing a and b, if a.left < b.left, this returns a negative, so in the sort, a comes before b. So when you sort, the array will be in order of increasing left. Thus cards[25] will have the largest left value, and cards[0] the smallest. Wait wait no, the largest is at index 25? Or after sorting, the last element (cards[25]) is the maximum? Wait no. Wait, if you have elements sorted in ascending order, the first element is the smallest. The last is the largest. Yes. So cards[25] is the one with largest left. \n\nThus, in each iteration, the code picks the maximum card, takes the minimum of (its count and remaining steps (k - i)), adds the square, subtract from the count, and then skips (change-1) steps? Let me see:\n\nThe loop steps through i from 0 to k. For each \"i\", we process step i, but when you take a change, which is the number of steps you can take now (could be 1 or more?), then you do i += change-1. So that after adding, i becomes i + (change-1). So when you go around the loop, next iteration adds 1, so effectively, the next i is i + change. Thus, this effectively batches the steps into chunks where each change steps are done in one iteration of the loop. \n\nSo in code:\n\nSuppose remaining steps is remaining = k - i.\n\nThe current max count is cards[25].left. Change is min(cards[25].left, remaining)\n\nThen the square is change^2 added to ans.\n\nThen, subtract change from the current max's count.\n\nThen, i is increased by (change-1) steps so that after the next loop increment (adding i by 1), i goes forward to i + change. \n\nThus, the loop variable i progresses by steps up to reach k. \n\nThe problem is translating this logic into Fortran.\n\nFortran doesn't have objects, so I need to have an array of integers (left(1:26)), initialized to 0. Then count each character in the string. Then, in the loop, I need to sort the array in descending order each time, then pick the maximum to process.\n\nWait, each time we need to sort the array in descending order, then process only the first element (or maybe the last in Fortran array if stored in ascending order? Wait need to see).\n\nIn Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, unless declared with lower bounds as 0. Since in Java it's 0-based, 26 elements (for 0-25). We can use an array in Fortran with indices 1 to 26.\n\nThe process will need to sort the array in such a way that after sorting, the first element (say) is the largest. Wait, or perhaps sort it in descending order, so the first element is largest. Then in each iteration, we can pick the first element, take min of its value and remaining steps (steps_remaining = remaining steps until k), add the square and proceed.\n\nWait in Java, each time before taking the action, they sort the array so the maximum is at cards[25] (since array was 0-25, and sorted in increasing order, so the last element is largest). So in Fortran, after sorting in descending order, the first element is largest, so we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Fortran, we can track the maximum value each time without full sorting. However, the problem here is that each time after taking 'change' from the maximum, the next iteration again requires the new maximum. So sorting may be necessary each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following steps:\n\nWe have an array counts(1:26) where counts(i) is the count for each of the 26 letters.\n\nInitialize to 0. Read n, k.\n\nRead string s of length n, then for each character in s (with ASCII value, converting to index).\n\nThen, the processing loop:\n\nInitialize remaining = k\n\nans = 0\n\nwhile remaining >0\n\n   sort the array in descending order\n\n   current_max = counts(1)\n\n   take change = min( current_max, remaining )\n\n   ans = ans + change*change\n\n   counts(1) = counts(1) - change\n\n   remaining = remaining - change\n\nend loop \n\nWait is this the same as the Java code? Let's see.\n\nOriginal Java approach: Each iteration, after sorting, takes the next step, but with the steps grouped so that the \"change\" steps can be taken at once, thereby saving time.\n\nWait, the Java code processes each of the 'change' times in batch, but since the loop's 'i' is advanced by (change-1), so in each loop iteration, it handles \"change\" steps at once, counting 1* change^2. \n\nThe above suggested Fortran code (as a while loop over remaining steps) is similar, because each iteration (of the while loop) would process as much as possible.\n\nWait in the while loop approach, it's more straightforward. So perhaps that would be better.\n\nWait let me see the logic in the original code:\n\nIn Java's loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n\n   sort the array\n\n   compute change = min( cards[25].left, k - i )\n\n   ans += change * change \n\n   subtract change from the left of that card, then i += change-1 \n\n}\n\nThe effect here is after the first iteration, the \"change\" steps are processed, so the remaining steps are (k - i) starts at k, and in that iteration, we take up to (k - i) steps. Then adding i by change-1, so after next iteration's i increases by 1, the total is i+change, which skips over the next (change-1) steps. Thus the total number of steps accounted for by each loop is change steps each time.\n\nSo the same as doing in each iteration (loop in Java), a single processing of \"up to remaining steps\" (remaining = k - i) with the maximum possible card. The current way loops once for each change group. But the key is that each change group's contribution is the change squared. \n\nSo in Fortran, a better way would be to compute the min(current_max, remaining), take that value, add its square to the total, subtract the change from current_max, and subtract from remaining.\n\nThis way, the while loop continues until remaining steps reach 0.\n\nYes, so that's better. Thus, in Fortran, the loop over each change group can be done with a while loop on the remaining. \n\nThus, the steps:\n\nFirst read n and k.\n\nThen read the string s, which has n characters.\n\nThen, for each character in s, increment counts(ichar(c) - ichar('A')+1), assuming Fortran uses 1-based index? Or perhaps A is stored in array element 1. So if the character is uppercase, subtracting 'A' gives 0-based, so adding 1 gives 1 to 26.\n\nSo counts(1) is A, counts(26) is Z.\n\nThen initialize ans to 0, remaining as k.\n\nThen, while remaining >0:\n\n   sort the counts array in descending order (so the first element is the maximum)\n\n   change = min( counts(1), remaining )\n\n   ans = ans + change * change \n\n   counts(1) = counts(1) - change \n\n   remaining = remaining - change \n\nBut then after subtracting, we need to sort again in the next iteration. \n\nWait but after we subtract from counts(1), the counts for the first element (which has been max) is now lower, so in the next sort, that might be in a different place.\n\nYes, this would correctly find the new maximum each time.\n\nThus, this approach would work correctly, provided that in each iteration, after sorting, we pick the first element, process it, then sort again next time.\n\nNow, the problem in Fortran is how to sort the array in descending order each time. Fortran can do array sorts, but it's arrays, and perhaps you can sort in descending order.\n\nIn Fortran, the `sort` function can sort an array either in ascending or descending order. The standard way would be to use `call merge_sort(counts, 1)` for ascending, but you can have a custom comparator? Alternatively, maybe using a subroutine to reverse after sort?\n\nAlternatively, using the `SORT` intrinsic function with a mask that sorts in descending order.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the intrinsic sort may not directly support custom orderings. Depending on the standard. The standard `SORT` is ascending by default. So to sort in descending, one can sort and then reverse.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFirst sort the array in ascending order, then reverse it so it's descending. \n\nWait for example:\n\ncall sort(counts)\n\ncall reverse(counts)\n\nBut let's check.\n\nAlternatively, we can sort in descending by using a key function that is negative.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way: first make counts(1:26) into an array, sort it in ascending order, then assign the array in reverse order. \n\nWait, in code, for example:\n\n   allocate(temp(26))\n\n   temp = counts\n\n   call sort(temp)\n\n   counts = temp(26:1:-1)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, in Fortran, there's a function that can do this.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way here is to implement a simple sorting routine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a bubble sort or selection sort in a loop, but for N=26, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since it's small, maybe a selection sort.\n\nThe sort of 26 elements can be done quickly with a selection sort each time. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, here's the algorithm outline in Fortran subroutines:\n\nIn each iteration of the while loop, we need to sort the array in descending order, so the first element is the max.\n\nWe can implement a sort in descending order here.\n\nAlternatively, use the `SORT` intrinsic and then reverse.\n\nWait, here's an example of how to sort an array in descending order in Fortran:\n\nSuppose we have an array A(26), then:\n\ninteger example(26); ... \n\ncall sort(example)\n\nexample = reverse(example)\n\nHmm but reverse isn't an intrinsic function. Alternatively, we can use back to front indices.\n\nAnother approach:\n\n   call sort(aux, key=index, ... )\n\nHmm not sure. Alternatively, use the `SORT` procedure and then back to front.\n\nAlternatively, to sort in descending order:\n\naux = counts\n\ncall sort(aux)\n\ncounts = reverse(aux) \n\nBut without reverse function, perhaps we can do something like:\n\ndo i = 1 to 26\n\n   auxiliary(i) = aux(27 - i) \n\nWait, no. Let's see, after sorting in ascending order, aux(1) is smallest, aux(26) is largest. So to get descending order, reversing the array would set the first element to largest:\n\ncounts = aux(26:1:-1)\n\nIn Fortran array assignment:\n\ncounts(1:26) = aux(26:0:-1)\n\nWait a step by -1 with start and end at 26 and 1?\n\nWait the syntax is array(start:end:step). So to get from 26 down to 1, step-1:\n\naux(26:-1:1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to code a loop.\n\nWait, here's an example:\n\nAfter sorting aux in ascending order, then to get descending:\n\ndo i=1,26\n\n   counts(i) = aux(27 - i)\n\nend do\n\nWait, that would map i=1 to aux(26), which is the max. So counts(1) is the max, counts(2) is second max, etc. Yes.\n\nSo here's the way:\n\nFirst, in each loop iteration, to sort:\n\n1. Create a temporary array.\n\n2. Copy counts into the temporary array.\n\n3. Sort the temp array in ascending order (using Fortran's sort).\n\n4. Assign temp from reverse into the counts array.\n\nBut in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to implement sorting in descending order.\n\nAlternatively, using another variable.\n\nAlternatively, let's code it step by step.\n\nNow, the Fortran code will look like this:\n\nprogram codeforces_462_B\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger, dimension(26) :: counts\n\ninteger :: n, k, remaining, change\n\ncharacter(len=:), allocatable :: s\n\ncharacter :: c\n\ninteger :: i, pos\n\ninteger :: ans = 0\n\n!

Sort the counts array in descending order\n\n   call sort_desc(counts)  ! need to implement this\n\n   ! Now counts(1) is the maximum\n\n   change = min(counts(1), remaining)\n\n   ans = ans + change * change\n\n   counts(1) = counts(1) - change\n\n   remaining = remaining - change\n\nend do\n\nprint*, ans\n\ndeallocate(s)\n\ncontains\n\n! subroutine to sort an array in descending order\n\nsubroutine sort_desc(arr)\n\n  integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n\n  integer :: i, j, temp, n\n\n  n = size(arr)\n\n  do i = 1, n-1\n     do j = i+1, n\n        if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then\n           temp = arr(i)\n           arr(i) = arr(j)\n           arr(j) = temp\n        end if\n     end do\n  end do\nend subroutine sort_desc\n\nend program codeforces_462_B\n\nWait, but the sort sub might not be the best way. Wait in this code, the sort_desc uses a bubble-like sort (nested loops), which for 26 elements is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe a selection sort would be better, but since it's just 26 elements, even several loops are okay.\n\nWait let's see the code above. The key step is that the called sort_desc will sort the input array in place, in descending order. \n\nWait the sort_desc loops through each element i, then for j starting at i+1, if arr(i) is less than arr(j), it swaps. This is the Bubble sort algorithm, and it will arrange the array in descending order. Since for each i, we ensure that arr(i) is greater than or equal to the following elements. \n\nWait let me see:\n\nSuppose the array is [ 3, 1, 4 ]\n\nFirst i=1: check j=2: 3>1, so no swap. j=3: 3<4 \u2192 swap \u2192 [4,1,3]\n\nthen, after j loop for i=1, array is [4,1,3].\n\nNext i=2: j=3 \u2192 1 vs 3 \u2192 swap \u2192 [4,3,1]\n\nNow next j loops, and after i=3, nothing. \n\nThe result is descending [4,3,1]. \n\nYes, this works. So the selection here is correct.\n\nTherefore the sort_desc is correct for sorting array in place to descending order. \n\nNow, the code's structure:\n\nRead n and k. Then read the input string. Then count the letters. \n\nLoop while remaining>0: call sort_desc on counts array. Then take the first element, which is the maximum. Compute change, add to ans, subtract from counts(1) (the max), reduce remaining. \n\nWait, but after subtracting, when we do the next iteration, the array is re-sorted again, so the next max is whatever is current.\n\nThat should be correct.\n\nWait but in the code, each iteration calls sort_desc on counts, which takes the current counts and sorts them into descending order. Thus, each time, the \"current maximum\" is the first element. \n\nYes, so the algorithm in Fortran would be equivalent to the Java approach. \n\nNow, in Fortran's code: \n\nWait, perhaps in the counting step, for each character in the string s. The code loops from 1 to n, and s(i:i) is each character. \n\nAlso, characters in fortran are read correctly with ichar. \n\nWait 'A' has ASCII code 65. So 'A'-'A' gives 0, plus 1 gives 1. So the first entry in counts is for 'A'. That's correct.\n\nNow, what about performance? Sorting 26 elements each time inside the loop. Since each iteration decreases remaining by at least 1, so the loop runs O(k) times. Since k can be up to 26 (because in the worst case where all letters are same?), but probably the maximum possible k? The problem constraints might have n and k up to 1e5? Wait the problem was from Codeforces, which is usually up to 1e5, but since in the code, in each iteration, doing a sort of 26 elements, that would be 26^2 ~ 676 operations per iteration. If k is up to say 1e5, then total operations would be 67.6 million. That's acceptable for Fortran, but perhaps better to find a way to do a single sort, but perhaps it's not necessary. Since 26 is small.\n\nYes. The code should work.\n\nAnother possible issue: in Fortran's array, if a count becomes 0, but the counts are being sorted. So in the sorting, the zero counts are placed at the end. So when they are sorted descending, zeros are pushed back, so in the loop, once the max is zero (because remaining is still positive), then the code would have a problem.\n\nWait suppose all counts are zero. remaining is still k, but then in the loop, change = min(0, remaining), which is zero. Thus, ans doesn't change, change=0; remaining decreases by 0, thus the loop will continue infinitely.\n\nWait, but how to avoid that?\n\nAh, in the original code (Java), the loop runs for at most k times. The code in the loop is:\n\nfor (int i =0 ; i < k ; i++ {\n\nprocess ... }\n\nbut in the Java code, the loop will run exactly k iterations. But when the remaining steps is exhausted (i.e. remaining steps (k -i) reaches zero), the change would be zero, so nothing added to ans, but the loops runs until i has counted up to k.\n\nIn the Fortran code, the loop is while (remaining >0). So if the remaining was exhausted (i.e., remaining can only become zero, once it reaches zero, the loop stops.\n\nWait:\n\nSuppose that after some steps, the available counts are all zero but remaining is still >0. But this could occur, for example, when n is less than k? No, but n is the length of the string. Since the problem states the input is a string of length n. The counts have a total of n. So when the remaining k is greater than n?\n\nWait the problem allows that. For example, if the total count is less than k.\n\nIn that case, the remaining could still be > counts's sum, so the maximums are being decremented to zero, and then in next loops, the max is zero, so in the loop:\n\nchange = min( counts(1), remaining ), but counts(1) is zero. So, change is zero.\n\nBut then, remaining remains the same. So this would loop infinitely until the universe ends. Thus, the loop would become infinite. Wait that's a problem.\n\nAh right. The program must stop once remaining reaches zero, but in the case with no more options, when the sum <k, but after losing all counts, remaining can never reach zero.\n\nWait sum(counts(1:26)) is the total number of cards. If the sum is S, then maximum possible ans is the sum_{i}(x_i)^2 where the total steps chosen can be at most min(k, S). Wait no.\n\nWait the algorithm loops as long as remaining>0. But when the sum of the counts is less than remaining, but the program has already counted the sum, but in the loop, once all counts are 0, the next \"change\" will be zero, and thus remaining cannot be reduced. So leading to infinite loop.\n\nHmm. Therefore in the code, I need to add a condition that the remaining is only decremented when change is non-zero.\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nchange = min( counts(1), remaining )\n\nthen subtracts change from counts(1), subtracts from remaining.\n\nThus, in the case that counts(1) is zero, it will take change 0, so remaining remains the same, so the loop continues.\n\nThus, in case the cards are zero but remaining is positive (because the original k was greater than the sum of counts), then the remaining can't be decreased, so enters an infinite loop.\n\nTherefore, the code must end the loop when either remaining reaches zero, or the counts array has no elements with counts left.\n\nWait but the problem says that we need to process k steps as much as you can. But in the problem, perhaps k steps are required, but with the limitation of the counts available. The problem's actual logic, from the Java code, allows for that; when the available counts is less than k, the remaining will just take the sum to zero, after that the code will stop. \n\nWait let me think:\n\nSuppose counts are exhausted (sum reaches zero). So, each iteration, after sort, top count is zero. Then:\n\nThe variable change = min(0, remaining). \n\nSo, the change will be 0, and thus:\n\nans += 0 \u2192 no change\n\ncounts(1) will subtract 0, so it stays zero.\n\nremaining - change \u2192 remaining - 0 \u2192 stays same. So the loop continues indefinitely.\n\nThus, the code logic must ensure that, if counts array has zero in all elements, the loop can terminate.\n\nHmm. How to fix that?\n\nIn the Java code:\n\nThe loop runs over each iteration up to i <k (k could be any number, even if the sum is less). For example, in that case, once the cards have been all exhausted, subsequent iterations will add zero (because the change will be min(0, ...) so zero. So in Java, the loop runs for exactly k loops, but after the total is exhausted, adding nothing after.\n\nBut in the current Fortran code's while loop, the loop will run until remaining is zero. But when remaining>0 and no elements with counts left, remaining stays the same.\n\nThus, in that case, it will loop infinitely.\n\nTo handle this, the problem is: when the sum(counts) < remaining, then we need to set remaining to min(remaining, sum). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the code, before entering the 'do while' loop, compute the total sum of counts. If k > sum, then remaining is sum, else k.\n\nWait no, the problem's code accepts k as given, and in the loop, you can take each step but only up to min(change_available, remaining). But in the Java code, it proceeds even when the total available steps (sum) is less than k. The code would then after the sum is exhausted, it can't take any more steps, so the remaining will not decrease, but the 'i' loop in Java would only run k iterations. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn Java's code: For example, sum =5. k=10. \n\nEach iteration of the for loop runs up to 10 times.\n\nThe loop is for i from 0 to 10:\n\nBut once the total steps taken is 5, then the remaining (10 -i) is 5, but counts[25] is zero. So change is min(0, ...) so zero. Thus, in that iteration, the change is zero. So ans +=0, and i increases by (0-1 ) \u2192 which meant that the for loop runs i increment, but the remaining is not reduced. \n\nWait let's think through an example where sum is 5, k is 10.\n\nSuppose all change are taken until remaining reaches zero, then any further iterations would have no change. However, in the loop's flow, once the cards are exhausted, during the first iteration over remaining 5 steps (when i is 5, say) the change would be 0, so adding nothing and i +=0-1 \u2192 thus, i becomes 5-1=4, then the loop continues. Wait this may cause it to run carefully.\n\nHmm, perhaps the Java code also has an infinite loop when sum is less than k? Or is there a condition.\n\nWait in the Java code:\n\nAfter remaining steps (k - i) is computed, suppose in the first situation:\n\nSuppose all counts have been exhausted. For example, the first step when remaining (k -i) is still remaining. When cards[25].left is 0. Then change is 0. So ans increases by 0, then i +=0-1 \u2192 so i becomes i-1. \n\nThen, the loop increments i for next step, which becomes i -1 +1 \u2192 stays the same, thus looping infinitely. \n\nWait that would be a problem in the original Java code! Oh wait that's a bug in the original code.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nIn Java's code: \n\nFor each iteration:\n\nchange = Math.min(cards[25].left, k - i);\n\nthen ans += change * change;\n\ncards[25].left -= change;\n\ni += change-1;\n\nSo for example, when change is zero:\n\ncards[25].left is zero, which was the maximum. Thus, in this case, change is zero. \n\nThen i += (0-1) = -1 \u2192 so after that, in the loop, the loop has already been running through the 'for' loop:\n\nWait, the loop is for (int i=0; i< k; i++) {\n\n   ... \n\n   i += change-1;\n\n}\n\nSuppose when change is zero here (i.e., at i = some number, the change is zero):\n\nAfter executing \"i += -1\", which subtracts 1 from i, but after that, the for loop will advance to i +=1 after the next iteration. \n\nWait in the for loop statement, it's a for( ;; i++) loop, but inside the loop body, you're modifying i. \n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose k=10, and the loop has arrived at i=5, but all the cards have their left values zero. (sum is 5, for example). Then:\n\nchange = Math.min(0, 10-5) \u2192 0\n\nans += 0 \u2192 no change. \n\ncards[25].left -=0 \u2192 no change.\n\ni += 0-1; \u2192 i becomes 5-1=4\n\nthen the for loop will increment i to 5 again (because the post-increment), so after the loop body, the i is set to 4 +1 \u2192 5 again. Wait the loop's iteration is: when processing the loop body, the code inside modifies the i variable, but the for-loop's increment is still executed. \n\nWait no. The for loop's syntax is:\n\nfor(init; condition; increment) { ... }\n\nThus, the increment is executed after the body, so the steps are:\n\nInitialize i=0.\n\nWhile (i <k) {\n\n   execute body, which may change i.\n\n   increment the i (i++)\n\n}\n\nWait no, the post increment occurs after the body, regardless of anything.\n\nWait no. For loops work as follows:\n\nfor (init; cond; increment) {\n\n   statement(s)\n\n} \n\nThe loop steps are:\n\ninit\n\nloop:\n\nif cond true \u2192 execute statements.\n\nthen, execute increment.\n\nthen back to top of loop.\n\nSo in the code's loop in Java, i will be incremented after the code's body, even if it was changed inside.\n\nSo in the example where i=5, change=0:\n\nInside the loop:\n\ninitial i before this loop iteration is 5. The condition is true (5<10).\n\nBody runs:\n\ni becomes 5 +0-1 =4.\n\nThen, after body, the post-increment happens (i++ \u2192 becomes 4+1=5 again. \n\nSo next loop, the condition is (5 <10) \u2192 again true.\n\nThe loop will then run again for k iterations? No, because the iteration would be continuing in a loop with same i value each time.\n\nThus, this would lead to an infinite loop in the original Java code when remaining > sum of counts. \n\nUh-oh. So that's a bug in the original Java code!\n\nWait is that correct? Let me think again with small example.\n\nExample:\n\nsum =3. k=5 (want to take up to 5 steps).\n\nThus, sum is 3. At the first three steps (using the algorithm in for loop):\n\nSuppose each has maximum 1, etc. So steps taken:\n\ni=0:\n\nchange = min(3 (or whatever), 5-0 =5 \u2192 to min(3,5) \u21923.\n\nans += 9.\n\nsubtract 3.\n\ni +=2 \u2192 i becomes 0 +3-1 =2 (then: post-increment in the for loop's i++ becomes 3.\n\nThus, next iteration, i=3.\n\nsteps remaining are 5-3 =2.\n\nSort the counts again, which have 0 now? (depends on initial setup). \n\nWait perhaps I need a concrete example. Let me see:\n\nLet's imagine all cards have exactly one count (sum is 26, but let's pick a simpler case).\n\nExample where n=3 (A,A,A), so counts for A is 3, others zero.\n\nk=4 (more than the sum 3).\n\nRun the Java code:\n\nFirst iteration i=0 (steps_remaining 4).\n\nchange is min(3 (left of A), 4) \u21923.\n\nans += 3^2=9. Remaining steps now is 4-3=1 (because k - i is 4 steps, but at i=0, after this change is 3 \u2192 steps_remaining reduced from 4 to 1?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate how this works:\n\nOriginal total is 3. \n\nFirst iteration (i=0):\n\nchange=3 (min(3, 4-0=4). \n\nans +=9. \n\nsubtract 3 \u2192 cards[A].left is 0. \n\ni +=3-1 =0 \u2192 i becomes 0 + (3-1) \u2192 2?\n\nWait, no:\n\nOriginal i is 0.\n\nIn the loop body:\n\ncards[25].left is 3 (assuming after sorting). \n\nchange = min(3, 4 -0 (steps remaining?) \u2192 is k-i?\n\nWait change = Math.min(3, k - i) \u2192k is 4, so 4-0=4.\n\nThus change is 3.\n\nCards[25].left -=3 \u2192 0.\n\ni += change-1 \u2192 0 +3-1 \u2192i becomes 2.\n\nThen the for loop's post-increment:\n\ni = 2 +1 =3.\n\nNow, the next loop checks i=3 <4 \u2192 yes.\n\nSecond iteration with i=3:\n\nsteps_remaining: k-i is 4-3 =1.\n\ncards[25].left must be sorted again. \n\nAfter first iteration, all counts except A (now zero) have been zero except possible others?\n\nSince after example, the counts are:\n\ncounts(1) (A's) is zero. \n\nThe other counts are zero except A. \n\nAfter sorting, the A is sorted to the end ( because left is zero?).\n\nWait no, the other cards (like B etc) are zero. \n\nWhen sorted in the Java code's comparator, which sorts based on their 'left's in increasing order. Thus, the sorted array has the elements with left 0 first. The cards with higher left come later. \n\nWait the comparator of a.compareTo(b) returns a.left - b.left.\n\nSo if a's left is 0 and b's left is also 0, the compare returns zero \u2192 they are equal? \n\nWhen the counts of other letters are zero except for others, the array after first step is A has zero. \n\nSo when we re-sort the array in Java's comparator, \n\nthe next iteration:\n\ncards[25] will have the maximum 'left' (0), but since all are zero, the maximum is 0. \n\nThen change would be min(0, 1 \u2192 remaining steps) \u21920.\n\nThen i increments by -1 \u21923 \u2192 change-1 is -1 \u21923-1 =2? Then after body, \n\ni after the body becomes i (before body was 3) plus change-1 \u2192 (change is 0 \u2192 i=3 -1=2?\n\nWait let's run step:\n\nIteration 2: i=3 (before the body). \n\nsteps remaining (rest is 4 -3 =1)\n\nthe array is all zeros, so when sorted, all left are 0. Therefore the max is 0 (cards[25].left is 0). \n\nThus change=min (0,1) \u2192 0. \n\nThus, \n\nans +=0 \u2192 nothing added.\n\nthen cards[25].left reduces by 0 \u2192 no change. \n\nThen i += (0 -1) \u2192 i becomes 3-1 =2.\n\nThen, the post increment i is now 2+1=3.\n\nLoop again. So entering into infinite loop between i=3 \u21922 \u2192 then 3?\n\nWait:\n\nAfter body, i becomes 3 (initial) becomes 3 + (0-1)= 2. \n\nPost increment makes it 2+1=3 again. \n\nSo, entering infinite loop at i=3. \n\nThus, the original Java code has a bug in this case. Which is problematic.\n\nThis suggests that the Java code is incorrect, but maybe it's fixed in some way. Alternatively, maybe the problem specifies that n and k are such that it's possible to do all steps, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Wait perhaps the problem's input constraints ensure that the sum is at least k? Or perhaps not.\n\nStuck here for a moment. I think this indicates that the original code may have a potential bug. However, since it's presented as the correct solution, maybe there's something else.\n\nWait the problem requires to process k attempts. Each attempt, you can do a certain number of changes, but when there are no more cards to take, you can do nothing. Thus, in such cases:\n\nIn the example above (k=4, sum 3), the maximum is 3 steps. So the answer is 3^2 (from first change of 3) plus then 0 (for the other step). So total 9. But with the Java code's logic. \n\nBut the code's processing would take 3 steps (first step gives 3 steps. remaining steps after: [rest is 1]. Then for the fourth step (i=3), but no left, so adding nothing). \n\nThus, the for loop will run 4 iterations (i from 0 to 3). \n\nWait when change is zero, the code's loop continues:\n\nThe for loop runs i from 0 to 3 (because initially, the loop limit is k=4 \u2192 0 \u2264i <4 \u2192 i runs up to 3).\n\nThus, in the fourth iteration (i=3), with remaining steps (k -i=1). But no cards left. So change=0, ans is 9. \n\nBut the code then subtracts nothing, changes i to 3-1=2, then post-increment makes it 3 again, leading the loop to run the same i again? Wait no, after processing i=3's iteration:\n\nDuring the iteration (now i starts at 3):\n\nAfter body processing, i becomes 3-1=2.\n\nThen the post increment makes it 2+1=3 again.\n\nThe condition i <4 holds \u2192 loop continues indefinitely.\n\nAh that's bad. So original code has a problem here. It's an infinite loop.\n\nThus, to resolve this in the for loop, the code requires an adjustment to break the loop after the counts are exhausted. Or to avoid the case when change is zero. \n\nHowever, the original code is likely intended to handle this as follows: because if sum <=k, the program counts all the steps from the available totals, and any further steps would add nothing. Thus, after all the available steps are exhausted (the sum), the remaining is zero, but k is larger. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn the example with sum=3 and k=4:\n\nAfter first iteration:\n\nchange=3 \u2192 ans +=9 \u2192 remaining (k -i) initially for this iteration is 4 steps remaining, since it's the first.\n\nNow, after that, the cards left is zero. \n\nNow, the loop's i was made 2, and then in the for loop, it increments to 3 (post-increment).\n\nSecond iteration (i=3, which is less than k=4):\n\nsteps_remaining=4-3=1.\n\nsort the array \u2192 maximum left is zero. \n\nchange is 0.\n\nThus: ans +=0, \n\ni becomes i (3) + (0-1)=3-1=2. \n\nPost increment step: i becomes 2+1=3 again. \n\nThus, infinite loop at i=3.\n\nThus, the original code has a bug here. \n\nWhat's the correct behavior?\n\nThe problem likely expects us to stop once the total is processed. Thus after 3 steps, the other steps contribute nothing, so the final answer is 9. \n\nBut in the code, it would loop infinitely. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the original code is not correct. \n\nTo fix the issue, in the Fortran code, we need to modify the while loop condition to terminate when the remaining is zero OR. we can check that in the 'do while' loop:\n\nWait in the Fortran code's while loop:\n\nWe have ans +=change^2, then counts(1) is subtracted, remaining is subtracted.\n\nWait when the sum of the counts is zero, and remaining is still >0, the change is zero, so remaining remains same. The loop will continue indefinitely unless we break.\n\nBut in that case, after the change is zero, the remaining is the remaining.\n\nSo the loop must be exited when remaining reaches zero OR the maximum left is zero and change is zero, so no further increases. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the maximum possible steps, which is sum_counts, and set remaining = min(k, sum). But that might not be.\n\nWait the sum of all counts is S. \n\nIf k < S, then you can process the steps up to k. \n\nIf k > S, you process all S steps. thus the answer is what's accumulated over the first S steps (exhausted). \n\nTherefore, prior to the loop, remaining should be the minimum of remaining and S. \n\nThus, the loop can only trap if the program may loop infinitely.\n\nTo handle this case in the code, before the loop, we can set remaining to min(remaining, sum_counts), where sum_counts = sum(counts(1:26).\n\nThus in Fortran's code:\n\nsum_counts is the sum of the counts array. \n\nremaining = min( k, sum_counts )\n\nThen the loop while remaining>0:\n\nthis ensures that in the worst case (k exceeds the counts sum), it will process until remaining hits zero.\n\nYes, so adding that step would prevent infinite loops.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nsum_counts = sum(counts(1:26))\n\nremaining = min(k, sum_counts)\n\nThen the loop while remaining>0: \n\nThis is a major correction.\n\nSo counting steps:\n\nBefore the while loop:\n\nsum_counts = sum( counts(1:26) )\n\nremaining = min(k, sum_counts)\n\nans =0\n\nthen the loop:\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this avoids the infinite loop problem.\n\nTherefore, the corrected Fortran code will have that additional step.\n\nSo the full code would be:\n\nprogram CodeForce462B\n  implicit none\n  integer, dimension(26) :: counts\n  integer :: n, k, remaining, change, sumcounts\n  character(len=:), allocatable :: s\n  integer :: i, pos\n  integer :: ans =0\n\n  read*, n, k\n  allocate( character(n) :: s )\n  read(*,*) s\n  counts = 0\n\n  do i=1,n\n    pos = ichar(s(i:i)) - ichar('A') +1\n    counts(pos) = counts(pos)+1\n  end do\n\n  sumcounts = sum( counts )\n  remaining = min( k, sumcounts )\n\n  do while ( remaining >0 )\n    call sort_desc(counts)\n    change = min( counts(1), remaining )\n    ans = ans + change * change\n    counts(1) = counts(1) - change\n    remaining = remaining - change\n  end do\n\n  print*, ans\n\n  deallocate(s)\ncontains\n\n  subroutine sort_desc(arr)\n    integer, intent(inout) :: arr(:)\n    integer :: i, j, temp, n\n    n = size(arr)\n\n    do i=1, n-1\n      do j=i+1, n\n        if (arr(i) < arr(j)) then\n          temp = arr(i)\n          arr(i) = arr(j)\n          arr(j) = temp\n        end if\n      end do\n    end do\n  end subroutine sort_desc\n\nend program CodeForce462B\n\nNow, this should handle cases where remaining is set properly.\n\nAnother point: in the code above, the 's' string read via the read(*,*) statement may include leading or trailing spaces. For example, if the string is input with a newline or spaces after, that could affect the length. Thus, to read the string as exactly n characters, perhaps using formatted read. \n\nBecause current code uses:\n\nread *, n, k\n\nthen reads s:\n\nread *, s \n\nBut when k is the second number, and then the next line has a string with n characters, that may work if the string is read from a new line. \n\nAlternatively, the second line may be read correctly as:\n\nBut in Fortran, reading 'read *, s' might read the entire line into 's' including possible trailing spaces if there are any, but the program assumes exactly n characters. So unless the input is provided correctly, there might be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, to read the string s as the next line after reading n and k. So first a newline. thus:\n\nPerhaps it's better to read the string with an explicit read:\n\nRead(n, '(a)') s \n\nBut I'm not sure. Need to think.\n\nAlternatively, after reading the first line with 'read *, n, k', then read the next line with:\n\nread *, s \n\nBut the next line contains n characters, so this should work.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure the string is read correctly, perhaps read it character by character:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nread *, s \ns = adjustl(s)  ! to remove leading white space\n\nBut again, the problem states the second line contains exactly n characters. We may have to rely on proper input.\n\nAnother thing: For the counts array, I used 'counts' as 1-based. The loop for i=1 to 26, for all letters, which should be okay. \n\nThe 'sort_desc' routine sorts the array in descending order. \n\nThis should now be correct."
