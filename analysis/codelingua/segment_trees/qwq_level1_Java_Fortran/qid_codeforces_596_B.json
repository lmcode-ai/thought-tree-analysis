    "original_reasoning": "Alright, let's tackle this code translation from Java to Fortran. Hmm, the user wants me to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let me first understand what the Java code is doing step by step so I can replicate it accurately in Fortran.\n\nThe Java code starts by importing the Scanner class, which is used for input. Then, in the main method, it reads an integer n from the user, which is the size of the array. Then it reads n integers into an array called arr. After that, it calculates an answer which initially is the absolute value of the first element. Then for each subsequent element, it adds the absolute difference between the current element and the previous one. Finally, it prints out the total.\n\nSo the plan is to translate this into Fortran. First, I need to figure out how to handle input in Fortran. Since Java uses Scanner, Fortran typically reads from standard input using read statements. Let me recall the syntax for reading an integer and an array. \n\nIn Fortran, I'll need to declare variables. The variable n is an integer, the array will be of type integer or, considering possible large values, maybe integer*8 to handle it since in Java it was long. Wait, in the Java code, they declared the array as long[], so in Fortran, using integer*8 (which is 64-bit) makes sense.\n\nThe absolute value function in Fortran is ABS, so that's the same as Math.abs in Java. The loop structure will be similar: a do loop. Also, initializing the answer with the absolute value of the first element. Then, looping from the second element up to n, adding each absolute difference between consecutive elements.\n\nStarting to outline the code:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n2. Read n elements into an array.\n3. Compute the answer as described.\n4. Print the answer.\n\nNow for the actual code structure. Since Fortran doesn't have classes, the main program is standalone. Let's start with the program declaration.\n\nFirst line could be:\n\nprogram codeforces_596B\n    implicit none\n\nThen, declare variables. Let's say:\n\ninteger :: n, i\ninteger(kind=8) :: answer\ninteger(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n!\n! Read n from input\n!\nread(*,*) n\nallocate(arr(n))\n!\n! Read the array elements\n!\ndo i = 1, n\n    read(*,*) arr(i)\nend do\n\nWait, but in Java, the numbers are read in a loop with nextInt() for each element. So in Fortran, if the numbers are given in one line, this do loop might not be the right approach. Wait, how is the input structured here?\n\nHmm, the Java code uses nextInt() each time, so probably, the input is given as:\n\nFirst line has the integer n. Then the second line has n integers separated by spaces. So maybe in Fortran, after reading n, the next line is read as the array.\n\nWait, in Java, for reading the array, the loop reads all n elements, which suggests that they are entered on a single line. Since in the Java code, after the first nextInt(), it reads the rest on the same line. Therefore in Fortran, perhaps the array can be read all at once after n is known. Let me think. Are the elements all on the same line as each other? If so, in Fortran, once we know n, we can read the array elements from the next line.\n\nSo code after reading n should be:\n\n! Read all elements on the next line. Let's adjust:\n\nread(*,*) (arr(i), i=1,n)\n\nBut we need to read the whole next line as the array. So after getting n, the next read statement would be that. So maybe the initial code was more suitable with read statements in a loop, but if the input is all on one line, perhaps the elemental read is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe that's not important here because as long as it reads all elements properly. Let me proceed and adjust as needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial code uses a loop for each element. If in the Java code it's a for loop from 0 to n-1, then in Fortran array indices start at 1, so arr(1) corresponds to arr[0] in Java. So arrays in Fortran by default start at 1, but can be declared with any lower bound. Since in the Java, the indices are 0-based, so to match, perhaps we can set the array in Fortran to start at 0? Wait, but in Fortran typically arrays are 1-based unless specified. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't matter because the indices are just being accessed in order. So in the code:\n\nInitially, answer is the absolute value of the first element (arr(1) in Fortran corresponds to arr[0] in Java). Then the loop runs from i=2 to n (Java's for (int i=1; i <n ; i++) becomes Fortran's i from 2 to n inclusive because in Fortran the 2nd element in the array would be next).\n\nSo let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, declaring variables:\n\nprogram codeforces_596B\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i\n    integer(kind=8) :: answer\n    integer(kind=8), dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(arr(n))\n\n    ! Read elements into the array:\n    read(*,*) (arr(i), i=1,n)\n\n    ! Initialize answer\n    answer = abs(arr(1))\n\n    ! Loop over remaining elements\n    do i = 2,n\n        answer = answer + abs( arr(i) - arr(i-1) )\n    end do\n\n    print*, answer\n\nend program codeforces_596B\n\nHmm, let's check:\n\nWait, in Java, the loop starts from index 1 (since it's 0-based). The loop in the Java code is for (int i=1; i <n; i++). The loop runs from 1 to n-1. In the Fortran code, the loop runs from 2 to n (since the first index is 1, and the last index is n). That corresponds to the same number of steps, since (n-1) steps. For example, n=2: i from 2 to 2 is 1 step, which matches Java's loop from i=1 to 1 (since i <2, so i=1).\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct. Now, the input handling.\n\nThe first read reads scalar n, the second read reads n integers into the array. But if the array is entered in one line, then the read for the array would be fine. Wait, in Java, after n is read with nextInt(), the next ones are read in a for loop which is likely that they are entered on the same line as nextInt() automatically gets the next tokens regardless of whitespace, but in Fortran, the READ statement for list-directed input (the * format) will read a line, and the next READ will start on the next line. So the user might have the following input:\n\nFirst line is n.\n\nSecond line has the n numbers, all on the same line.\n\nHence, the Fortran code will read n from first line, then read the next line as the array.\n\nTherefore the code as written is okay.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, if the input is given with all numbers in one line, then the first read for n would read the first number, then the read for the array would read from the same line. Wait no: In list-directed input, each list item is separated by commas or spaces. When you do read(*,*) two separate statements, the first read (for n) will read the first line. For example, if the user enters 5 followed by Enter, that is n. Then the second read (for the array) must then read the subsequent numbers.\n\nBut in reality, maybe the input is on the next line. Alternatively, maybe all the numbers are on a single line. Let's see, suppose the input is like:\n\n5 10 20 30 40 50\n\nWait no, that's n=5 followed by the numbers. Then when you read n first, then the rest are read as the array.\n\nWait, but in that case, the second read would read the first 5 elements but they are on the same line. Let's think about possible input scenarios. The Java code would read n then n numbers from the same line. For example:\n\nSample input:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nBut then the first read in Fortran would read n=3, and the array reading would require that the next line has 1 2 3. Alternatively, input as:\n\n3 1 2 3\n\nIn that case, the first read for n takes '3', and then the array read takes the next numbers '1 2 3' ?\n\nBut in FORTRAN, if those are all on the same line, then the first read of n would read 3, and then the array read would proceed with the remaining numbers. Because in list-directed input, all data is in the input file. \n\nWait, in list-directed mode (the * format descriptor), the reading continues as needed. For instance, if the user inputs:\n\n3 1 2 3\n\n, the first read(*,*) n will read first 3, and remaining 1 2 3 will be left, which is read by the next read statement which uses n=3 to read them. Wait no. Let me think. If you have:\n\nSuppose the input after the first read is:\n\n3 1 2 3 (all on a single line with spaces), then first read(*,*)n will read n=3, but the rest (1,2,3) will be left in the buffer. Then the next read statement ( read(*,*) (arr(i), i= 1,n) ) would read 1,2,3. \n\nAlternatively, if the first read consumes the entire first line (like if the n was on its own line), then the second read would get the next line's input. So regardless of the input structure, as long as the user's input provides first n, then the list of n integers (could be on one or more lines, separated by whitespace), this code should work correctly. Because list-directed can handle multi-line inputs as separate records.\n\nSo the code as written is correct in that sense.\n\nNow, check the loop for accumulating answer. \n\nYes, starts with the first element's absolute value.\n\nWait in the Java code, the initial answer is Math.abs(arr[0]), and the next part loops starting from i=1 (the second element). So the initial answer is correct in Fortran with the first element's absolute value.\n\nThen loops through 2 to n (inclusive), adding absolute difference between current and previous element. Which is correct.\n\nCheck the print statement. In Fortran, print *, answer will print the answer with a newline. The Java code uses System.out.println(answer) which also adds a newline. So this is correct.\n\nNow, data types: since the Java code uses long in the array and the answer, we must use a 64-bit integer in Fortran. Because in Java, a long is 64 bits. So in Fortran, to get 64-bit integers, we can use the SELECTED_INT_KIND function, but perhaps to keep it simple, if the compiler allows, we can use integer*8. Alternatively, use the standard intrinsic types.\n\nIn Fortran 90/95, integer(8) is not standard, but integer(kind=8) is usually the way. However sometimes integer(selected_int_kind(18)) would ensure a 64-bit kind. But if the user is using a compiler that has default integer(8) for large numbers, perhaps that's better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use a kind parameter. To be safe, perhaps:\n\ninteger, parameter :: int64 = selected_int_kind(18)\ninteger(int64) :: answer\ninteger(int64), dimension(:), allocatable :: arr\n\nBut then in the code, you have to define the parameter first.\n\nAlternatively, if we can rely on integer(kind=8), that's okay for the code to work. So perhaps in the code given, using kind=8 is sufficient, unless there is a possibility that 8 is not the right kind.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of this problem, given that the original Java uses long (64 bits), using kind=8 is acceptable.\n\nSo putting that into the code, variables declared with kind=8.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nI think that's the correct translation. Let me write it clearly now.\n\nWait also, in the initialization: answer is set to the absolute value of arr(1). The code has that correctly.\n\nTesting in mind: for example, n=1, then the output is the absolute value of the single element. The code would compute that. \n\nAnother example from the Java code? Like the problem statement. Let me see, look for Problem B from codeforces596? Maybe it's about the frog jumping over lily pads. But maybe not necessary, but the code works as described.\n\nSo the final Fortran code would be as written earlier, with proper variable declarations and flow."
