Wait, but what about when n=0? Well, in programming contest tasks like AtCoder, probably the constraints say n >=1, so no problem. Alternatively, in the original code, in Java, if n is zero, the code would print nothing, but in Fortran code as written, if n is zero, it would crash because a is allocated to (n =0). So better to add a check for n>0:\n\nPerhaps:\n\n    if(n ==0) then\n        write(*,*)\n        return\n    end if\n\nBut given the problem's context, probably not needed. Now another point: in the initial loop where we read the array, the code reads each a(i), and cumulatively computes 'r' as the XOR of all elements, using ieor(r, a(i)). Wait, because the initial r is 0, so after first a(1): r=0 ^a(1). Then next step r^=a(2) would be r = ieor(0^a1,a2) = a1^a2, etc. So yes.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the Java code does. \n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer n, then reads n integers into an array a. It calculates the XOR of all elements in a and stores it in variable r. Then, for each element in a, it prints r XOR a[i], separating them with spaces.\n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. **Reading input**: In Fortran, input is usually handled with read(*,*) statements. The first input is n. Then we need to read n integers into an array. \n\n2. **Calculating the XOR**: The XOR operation in Java is done with the ^ operator. In Fortran, the XOR is denoted by the same operator ^. However, I should confirm if Fortran uses the same bit operation for integers. Wait, Fortran has elemental functions like ieor for integer XOR. Oh right! In Fortran, the intrinsic function for XOR of two integers is ieor(a,b). Because in Fortran, the ^ is not the XOR operator; rather, it's an exponentiation operator in older versions. Wait, actually in Fortran, the XOR operator can be ambiguous. To be safe, using ieor is the correct way to perform bitwise XOR between two integers. So the initial approach to calculate r needs to use ieor accumulatively.\n\nSo for r, which starts at 0, then for each element a(i), we compute r = ieor(r, a(i)).\n\nThen, for each a(i), the output is ieor(r, a(i)). \n\n3. **Loops**: The loops in Fortran are a bit different. The for loop in Java with 0 to n-1 would translate to a do loop from 1 to n? Because Fortran arrays are 1-based by default, unless specified otherwise. Wait, the Java code uses zero-based indexing (indices from 0 to n-1). But in Fortran, array indices start at 1 unless declared with a different lower bound. So need to adjust for that. \n\nAlternatively, if in the Fortran code, the array is dimensioned as (n), then the indices are from 1 to n. So when translating the loop, make sure that the 'i' in Fortran's loop runs from 1 to n, and the same logic applies. \n\nFirst, the declaration: in Java, the array is declared as int[n]. In Fortran, an integer array of size n would be something like integer :: a(n).\n\n4. **Initialization**: r starts as 0. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nFirst read n. Then read the array. Then compute r as the cumulative XOR of all elements. Then loop over each element, compute r XOR a(i), and print them separated by spaces.\n\nNow, handling the control statements:\n\nThe second loop in Java is over i from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, with 1-based indices, it would be 1 to n. So in the output loop:\n\nFortran code:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (i > 1) then\n        write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n    end if\n    write(*, '(I0)', advance='yes') ieor(r, a(i))\nend do\n\nWait, but in the original Java code, the first element is printed without a preceding space. So in the loop, for i not 0 (since Java's first i is 0), but in Fortran, since the loop starts at i=1, for i != 0 would translate to i >1 here. So the first element (i=1) is printed without space, and others start with a space.\n\nAlternatively, Fortran's write statement allows formatting, so maybe better to write all elements with a space delimiter, but avoiding a trailing space. Hmm, but in code, that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using an 'if' condition to not print a space before the first element. The above code does that.\n\nNow, Fortran code structure:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC171_E\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, r\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    r = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n        r = ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    do i = 1, n\n        if (i > 1) then\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n        end if\n        write(*, '(I0)', advance='yes') ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    write(*,*) ''  ! To ensure a new line?\nend program atcoder_ABC171_E\n\nWait, but the second write statements for the elements. Let me check:\n\nWait, in Fortran, when using advance='no', the next write will continue on the same line. So in the first write of each element after the first, we output a space without advancing, then write the number with advance=yes (so next write will be on next line?), but I think 'advance' just controls whether to advance after the write. \n\nWait, perhaps the code above for printing each number with a space separator. Let's think again:\n\nAlternatively, using an unformatted write with a format that prints space separated numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the second loop can be written as:\n\nFirst, write all the numbers into an array, then write them in a single write statement with the appropriate format. But that might be more involved. \n\nAlternatively, the first method should work:\n\nFor each element except the first, print a space before the number. The first element is printed without preceding space. \n\nThe code:\n\nIn the first iteration (i=1): \n\nCondition i >1 is false. So no space, then write the number. \n\nSecond iteration (i=2): condition true, write space, then write the number.\n\nThis way, each number after the first has a space before it, which effectively puts all numbers on the same line separated by spaces. \n\nAt the end of the second loop, the current line will have all the numbers but no trailing space. Then, the final write(*,*) '' would start a new line? Wait, but in the given Java code, after the print loop, there is no printing of a new line? Or does Java automatically add a new line when the System.out.print finishes? \n\nWait, the Java code for printing is: \n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    if (i !=0)  print space, \n\n    print value }\n\nSo the numbers are all on one line, with a space between them. So the Fortran code should also output all numbers on a single line, separated by spaces, then a newline. \n\nThe way the code above writes is that each number is written with write ( with advance=yes which is the default), so each write would go to new line unless controlled. Wait, no: the write statements with '(I0)' will write the integer as a string without the format controlling spacing, but the way it's designed here with the first write for the space and then the next for the integer, but perhaps I need to better manage this. \n\nAlternatively perhaps the following approach is better:\n\nThe second loop can be done with a single write statement, by first collecting all the terms into an array and then printing them in one statement. \n\nAlternatively, let me see what the code would look like with the loops as written. \n\nWait, in the code I had written:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n    if (i > 1) then \n        write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n    end if\n    write(*, '(I0)', advance='yes') ieor(r, a(i))\nend do\n\nBut the effect is:\n\nFor i=1: output the first number, then since advance='yes', the cursor is on the next line. Wait no, write(*,...) will write to the current line, unless told otherwise. The advance='yes' means that the next write will start on a new line. Wait, the variable advance in Fortran's output specifies whether to advance to a new record (next line) after completing this write. \n\nSo for the first write (of the number), when we do advance='yes', so after writing the first number, the next write (for i=2) would start on the next line. But then the space would be written on that line before the next number. \n\nWait, I think the approach in the original code has a problem here. Because each number is printed as a separate write statement. Since after the first write (with advance='yes'), the next line is started, so the space and the next number would be on the next line. That would not work. \n\nHmm, so that approach is wrong. Need to find another way. \n\nPerhaps the 'advance' must be set to 'no' for the first write (for the space and before the last element?), but that might complicate.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nUse the first write for the first element, then for the next elements do a space followed by the element. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe loop can be structured so that the first element is written, then for the remaining elements, write a space followed by the element. \n\nLike:\n\nFirst write the first element without a space. \n\nThen for the rest (from i=2 to n) do: write(' ' and then the element. \n\nBut to do this, maybe split it into first writing the first element, then looping from 2 to n. \n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nwrite(*, '(I0)', advance='no') ieor(r, a(1))\ndo i = 2, n\n    write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n    write(*, '(I0)', advance='no') ieor(r, a(i))\nend do\nwrite(*,*)  ! To write a newline at the end.\n\nWait, that might work. \n\nThis way, after writing the first number, the cursor stays on the same line. \n\nThen for each subsequent element, write a space (with advance=no, then the number, so continuing on same line. \n\nAt the end, after the loop, the last write(*) outputs a newline to terminate the line.\n\nThis seems better. \n\nSo revising the code:\n\nFirst loop:\n\nRead the array as done before. \n\nSecond:\n\nCompute the outputs: \n\nwrite(*, '(I0)', advance='no') ieor(r, a(1))\n\nthen do i=2 to n:\n\nwrite(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\nwrite(*, '(I0)', advance='no')  ieor(r, a(i))\n\nend do\n\nThen write *, to go to new line. \n\nThis way, the entire line is printed without a trailing space.\n\nSo putting it all together, the full Fortran code would be something like:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC171_E\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, r\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    r = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n        r = ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    if (n == 0) then   ! edge case, but input would have n >=1 probably.\n        write (*,*)\n    else \n        write(*, '(I0)', advance='no')  ieor(r, a(1))\n        do i = 2, n\n            write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n            write(*, '(I0)', advance='no')  ieor(r, a(i))\n        end do\n        write(*,*)  ! move to new line\n    end if\nend program atcoder_ABC171_E\n\nWait but in Java's code, when n is 0, but the problem may ensure n is at least some number? Perhaps the problem constraints ensure n \u22651, so we can assume n is at least 1. So maybe the 'if' block is unnecessary, and we can just proceed with:\n\n    if (n ==0 ) then\n       ... (but perhaps it's better to handle it, but given the problem's input likely has n\u22651, perhaps removed?)\n\nThen the code is simpler.\n\nThus:\n\nprogram atcoder_ABC171_E\n    implicit none\n    integer :: n, i, r\n    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n    read(*,*) n\n    allocate(a(n))\n    r = 0\n    do i = 1, n\n        read(*,*) a(i)\n        r = ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    write(*, '(I0)', advance='no')  ieor(r, a(1))\n    do i = 2, n\n        write(*, '(A)', advance='no') ' '\n        write(*, '(I0)', advance='no')  ieor(r, a(i))\n    end do\n    write(*,*)\nend program atcoder_ABC171_E\n\nThis should work.\n\nWait but in this code, when i goes from 2 to n, the loop iterates (n-1) times, writing a space and the value for the current index. \n\nTesting for n=1: Then only the first write happens, and the loop from 2 to 1 is skipped, leaving only the first element. The write(*) will add the newline.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting n=3:\n\nFirst write a(1) term without space, then for i=2 and 3:\n\nFor i=2, write space + a[2], then for i=3, space + a(3). But each space is written before the number. This will lead to:\n\nterm1 space term2 space term3 followed by a new line. Exactly correct.\n\nAnother approach is to use a format statement. Like:\n\nAfter computing all terms, store them in an array, and then write them with a space-separated format.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps the first approach is straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about when n=0? Well, in programming contest tasks like AtCoder, probably the constraints say n >=1, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, in the original code, in Java, if n is zero, the code would print nothing, but in Fortran code as written, if n is zero, it would crash because a is allocated to (n =0). So better to add a check for n>0:\n\nPerhaps:\n\n    if(n ==0) then\n        write(*,*)\n        return\n    end if\n\nBut given the problem's context, probably not needed.\n\nNow another point: in the initial loop where we read the array, the code reads each a(i), and cumulatively computes 'r' as the XOR of all elements, using ieor(r, a(i)).\n\nWait, because the initial r is 0, so after first a(1): r=0 ^a(1). Then next step r^=a(2) would be r = ieor(0^a1,a2) = a1^a2, etc. So yes.\n\nAnother thing: array allocation in Fortran. Since the code uses 'dimension(:), allocatable', and allocates based on n.\n\nAnother thought: The Fortran code uses implicit none, which is good, so all variables must be declare\n    ed. The variables: n, i, r, and a. \n\nAlso, the read statements for the array elements are all done in order. \n\nYes, the code seems to be correct.\n\nThus this should be the Fortran translation."
