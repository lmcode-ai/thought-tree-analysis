So in Java's first case (now >=0):\n\nthey are trying to find the first index c where now*a[c] >=x? Or what's the condition here? Wait in the 'check' function in Java, for a[i], the code is trying to count the number of elements a[c] such that now (a[i]) * a[c] >=x (for negative numbers) or < x? Let me relook the Java code's check function. Looking at Java's check function:\n\nNow, in the case when now >=0 (positive):\n\nThe inner code:\n\nint l=0, r = n;\n\nwhen now (which is positive) is multiplied by a[c], and they want to find how many a[c] that now *a[c] <x ?\n\nWait the loop:\n\nwhen now >=0, the loop does a binary search for when 'now * a[c] <x'?",

So all elements before that (indices less that l) have a[c]*now <x. So the number of elements with a[c] * now <x is l. \n\nHence, the code adds l to the 'tot' variable. Therefore, for the now >=0 case, the code is counting all entries where product <x, and adding those. So the total for now (the a[i]) is the number of a elements less than x/a_i. Wait perhaps. Wait but the code is also adjusting for the case when a[i] itself is considered?",

The adjustment is needed because when a[i]*a[i] is less than x, then the element when j=i is counted but shouldn't be when calculating unordered pairs or if self-pairs are excluded. But the adjustment here might be necessary due to how the calculations are done. The code's 'tot' counts for each i, the number of j's (including j=i?) such that a_i *a_j <x, and then adds all those counts. Since each pair is counted twice (once for i and j, unless i =j). So when you divide by 2, the total is the number of unordered pairs (i,j), but including where i =j?\n\nWait perhaps the code adds all pairs (i,j) where product <x, and counts them, but since the problem likely counts ordered pairs?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the code does. It seems like it's solving a problem where, given an array of integers and a value k, it finds the number of pairs (i,j) such that a[i] * a[j] < x, and uses binary search to find the x where the count is just below or equal to k. Wait, not exactly\u2014 looking at the code structure, the main function uses binary search on x, and the check function counts the number of pairs with product greater than x, or is it the other way around? Let me see.\n\nThe main function initializes variables and arrays. Let me look at the check function. The check returns true if the total is less than 2*k? Wait, looking at check's return statement: if (tot /2 <k ), then return true. So, maybe we want when the number of pairs with a[i]*a[j] >=x is >=k? Or maybe the logic here is inverted. Let me parse that.\n\nThe check function computes tot, which is the total count of some condition, perhaps for each element a[i], how many elements to the right (since the array is sorted) that satisfy the product condition. Maybe the binary search is trying to find the minimum x such that the number of pairs with product >=x is less than k? Not sure, but the key parts are translating the loops and the binary search logic correctly.\n\nNow, looking at the code structure: variables like mod and the DX, DY arrays. Wait in Java, those are static. In Fortran, perhaps they can be module variables or constants.\n\nFirst, variables:\n\nJava has mod as a static int of 1e9+7. However, looking at the main function, I don't see mod being used. Wait, the code uses mod maybe in the Java version, but in the code provided, maybe it's not used. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the Java code, mod is initialized, but in the main function, it's not used. So perhaps this mod is part of another problem and isn't used here. Maybe a leftover. Since the Fortran code doesn't need it unless it's required in the problem. Maybe I can ignore it for now unless there's some modulo operation.\n\nThe DX and DY arrays are also not used in the code. The arrays DX and DY for directions, but the code does not seem to use them. So maybe those can be safely omitted in the Fortran code.\n\nProceeding. So the variables used are n, k, a array. Let's see variables in Java's main method:\n\nn is the count of elements, k is the given value, a is the array of n elements. \n\nThe code sorts the array, then does a binary search between l and r which start at -INF and INF, but I'll see the binary search loop. The check function computes some total which is compared against k to decide if to adjust the binary search.\n\nNow, translating the variables: in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default, but can be made 0-based by declaration. Since Java uses 0-based arrays (the inputs are 0-based), we need to handle that. Alternatively, we can use 1-based in Fortran and adjust loops accordingly. Let me see:\n\nIn Java's main method, the array is a[n], with for loop from 0 to n-1. The array in Fortran could be declared as a(1:n). So we can map the indices 0..n-1 in Java to 1..n in Fortran. So in loops, when i is from 0 to n-1 in Java, in Fortran it would be 1 to n.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn Java, the loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n    a[i] = fs.nextLong();\n}\n\nIn Fortran, the equivalent would be:\n\ndo i=1, n\n    read *, a(i)\nend do\n\nSo the array is 1-based here. \n\nThe next step is sorting the array. Java uses Arrays.sort(a), which in Fortran can be done via a bubble sort? Or using a built-in function. Fortran 90 has the intrinsic function merge_sort, but actually, you can use the built-in \"sort\" function, but perhaps in older versions? Let me recall\u2014 in Fortran 90 and above, you can use the \"sort\" function needs an integer array. Wait no, the function is \"sort(array)\" or do you use the 'order' keyword.\n\nWait, in Fortran, the best way is to use the built-in sort. Let me check: the statement is:\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nThat would sort a in ascending order. \n\nYes, the Fortran intrinsic function is 'sort', so a = sort(a) or call sort(a). Wait, perhaps the following:\n\ncall merge_sort(a) or similar? Hmm, perhaps I should use a subroutine. Alternatively, assuming that the intrinsic is available.\n\nAlternatively, if the compiler does not support, perhaps a different approach. Let me assume that we can do it with:\n\n a = sort(a)\n\nYes, perhaps. Let me confirm: in Fortran, the sort function is part of ISO Fortran environment? Wait, actually, the function to sort an array is contained in modules, e.g., for an array of integers, you can use the 'sorted' function. Maybe better to use the intrinsic function. Wait, according to some references, in Fortran 90 and later, there is the 'sort' subroutine in the ISO_C_BINDING module? Alternatively, perhaps the easiest is to use the syntax:\n\ncall msort(a) where msort is an external merge sort. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps using the 'sort' intrinsic. Let me check, in Fortran, perhaps the following is the correct way to sort an array:\n\nINTEGER :: a(10) = [ ... ]\nCALL QSORT(a)\n\nBut perhaps that's part of a specific compiler. Maybe the code should use a pure Fortran function.\n\nWait, in the code, the array is of integers. Wait no, the array 'a' is of long in Java. In Fortran, type would be integer*8? Or in Fortran 2008, using integer(kind=int64). Since the array elements can be large (up to 1e18?), so in Fortran, declare the array as real*8 or integer(8)? Wait in the code, the a array is 'long', which is 64-bit. So Fortran needs to use integer(8) or double precision? Wait for products, but in the original code, a[i] are multiplied as Long in Java, which is 64 bits. So in Fortran, variables should be 8-byte integers, potentially.\n\nSo the variables in the Fortran code could be declared as integers with kind=8 or double precision, depending on compiler.. But since in the code, variables like 'x' are multiplied as a[i] * a[j], which can be up to 1e18 squared which would be too big for 64-bit, but in the problem statement, perhaps the product is checked against x (also 1e18 maybe?), so possibly we can manage with variables of 64 bits. Let me think.\n\nWait, the maximum value for a 64-bit signed integer is about 9e18, so 1e18^2 is 1e36 which is way too big. But in the code, the variables x and the products are being stored. So in Java, the product would overflow long which is 64 bits. Wait, but according to the initial code, the array elements are read as Long (Java's long), which is 64 bits. The product of two large numbers might overflow here, but the code in the Java code uses:\n\n'now * a[c] <x' for some elements. But in Java, the product may overflow, leading to incorrect comparisons. However, perhaps the problem's constraints avoid that, or perhaps not; but in the translation, we should avoid that.\n\nThus, in Fortran, maybe using double precision (real*8) for the variables, so products don't overflow, as floating point can handle larger exponents.\n\nWait, in the check function, 'now * a[c] <x' is a comparison. So perhaps in Fortran, we can use double precision for x and all the a elements. Let me think. Alternatively, use integer(8) since the code is written with the variables as long in Java, and assuming they are intended to be 64-bit integers.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the comparison:\n\nIf a[i] and a[j] are large integers, their product may be very big, but if x is up to 1e18 (like in the code's INF is 1e18), then for example, if x is an 1e18, but a[i] is sqrt(x)*2, then product can be up to 4e18. But in 64-bit signed integers can handle up to about 9e18. So maybe the product can be stored in 64 bits as long as |a[i]| and |a[j]| are not too big. Alternatively, perhaps in code, when doing comparisons, it's safer to use arithmetics in 64 bits, but we have to ensure no overflow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem constraints, elements are small enough so that their squares are under 1e18. But assuming the problem has constraints that it's manageable, perhaps the variables can be handled as integers in Fortran with kind=8.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nStart translating the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the Java code starts with defining the mod, DX, DY, which are statics. But in the code given, only mod and the arrays aren't used. Since they are not used, except mod is set and not used, I think they can be omitted in the translation.\n\nFirst, declare variables. The variables are:\n\nstatic int mod = ... \u2014 not used, ignore.\n\nstatic int DX and DY arrays. Not used, ignore.\n\nstatic int n and k is long, but in the main(), n is read via nextInt(). So in Fortran, n is an integer variable, but in the code, the first input is n as int from standard input. Since in Fortran, integers can be 4-byte (most default), but if n is large, but the problem probably limits n to 1e5 or up, so 4 bytes might be enough. So in Fortran:\n\ninteger :: n, k\n\nWait but in the code, k is read as a nextLong(), so in Fortran, k is an integer*8 or 8-byte integer. The array a is declared as long in Java, which is 8 bytes. So perhaps variables:\n\nVariables in Fortran:\n\ninteger(8), dimension(:), allocatable :: a\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger(8) :: k, l, r, c, x, tot, now, INF\n\nWait the binary search uses l, r, c as variables. Also, in the loops.\n\nFirst, in the main program, the first step is to read n, k, and the array a.\n\nPutting this into Fortran:\n\nIn free-form Fortran (90 or later), code structure would be like:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n\n\ninteger(8) :: k, INF\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n\ninteger(8) :: l, r, c, x, tot\n\nRead n and k, then read array a(n).\n\nBut first, we need to read n, allocate array a, then read n elements into a, then sort a.\n\nHere's a step by step outline.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nThe main program block:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: i\ninteger(8) :: n, k\ninteger(8), allocatable :: a(:)\ninteger(8) :: INF, l, r\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(a(n))\nread*, a\n\ncall sort(a)\n\nINF = 1e18 +1\nl = -INF\nr = INF\n\ndo while ( l +1 < r )\n    c = (l + r)/2\n    if ( check(c) ) then\n        l = c\n    else\n        r = c\n    end if\nend do\n\nprint*, l\n\ncontains\n\nfunction check(x) result (ok)\n    integer(8), intent(in) :: x\n    integer(8) :: i, now, tot\n    integer(8) :: l2, r2, c2\n    integer(8) :: temp\n    logical :: ok\n    \n    tot =0\n    do i=1, n\n        now = a(i)\n        l2 =0\n        r2 =n\n        \n        if (now >=0) then\n            do while(l2 < r2)\n                c2 = (l2 + r2)/2\n                if (now * a(c2) <x ) then\n                    l2 = c2 +1\n                else\n                    r2 =c2\n                end if\n            end do\n            tot = tot + l2\n        else\n            do while(l2 < r2 )\n                c2 = (l2 + r2 ) /2\n                if ( now *a(c2) >=x ) then\n                    l2 = c2 +1\n                else\n                    r2 = c2\n                end if\n            end do\n            tot = tot + ( n - l2 )\n        end if\n        \n        if ( now * now <x ) then\n            tot = tot -1\n        end if\n    end do\n    \n    ok = ( tot / 2 < k )\n    \nend function check\n\nend program atcoder_abc155_d\n\nWait, but let me walk through each part.\n\nWait the loop in check function:\n\nWait, in Java's check, the loop over i is from 0 to n-1 (since Java is zero-based, and the array has size n), but in Fortran, the array is 1-based here, so it loops from 1 to n.\n\nThen, the variables l2 and r2: in the original code, the code uses l=0, r=n (arrays have indices 0 to n-1?), but in Fortran's array indices starting at 1 and up to n, so in the Java code's code in the for loop over each element a[i], in the for loops of searching, there's initial l = 0, r= n. So in Java's first case (now >=0):\n\nthey are trying to find the first index c where now*a[c] >=x? Or what's the condition here?\n\nWait in the 'check' function in Java, for a[i], the code is trying to count the number of elements a[c] such that now (a[i]) * a[c] >=x (for negative numbers) or < x? Let me relook the Java code's check function.\n\nLooking at Java's check function:\n\nNow, in the case when now >=0 (positive):\n\nThe inner code:\n\nint l=0, r = n;\n\nwhen now (which is positive) is multiplied by a[c], and they want to find how many a[c] that now *a[c] <x ?\n\nWait the loop:\n\nwhen now >=0, the loop does a binary search for when 'now * a[c] <x'? The code is in the for loop over n elements. For each a[i], they do this:\n\nIn the first case:\n\nnow (the current a[i]) is non-negative.\n\nThe code is:\n\nif (now * a[c] <x \u2192 then l = c+1. The loop is to find the lower bound.\n\nWait, in the code's 'while (l < r) loop:\n\nIn the now >=0 case:\n\nif (now*a[c] <x \u2192 then the l is set to c+1?\n\nWait the condition here is to find the minimal index where the multiplied value is >=x ?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nWait in Java's code, when now is >=0:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nif (now*a[c] <x \u2192 l = c +1 ?\n\nWait, the standard binary search logic is like this: the code is trying to find the first position where a[c] * now >= x. Let's see:\n\nThe code wants to find the number of elements where 'now * a[c] >=x', since in the sum 'tot += l', maybe?\n\nWait the variables are a bit conflicting.\n\nWait the code's logic here is:\n\nFor each a[i], 'now' is the current a[i].\n\nThe case when now is non-negative:\n\nthe condition is counting the number of elements a[c] where now * a[c] >= x. ?\n\nWait no. Let's see:\n\nIn the code for now >=0:\n\nthe loop's condition:\n\nwhen now*a[c] <x \u2192 then 'l = c +1'.\n\nWait the segments of Java code:\n\nInside the 'if (now >=0)' block:\n\nWe have l and r set to 0 and n. The loop continues when l <r.\n\nSo for each iteration, they compute c = (l + r)/2. \n\nThe if condition is: if now * a[c] <x \u2192 then we need to move l to c+1.\n\nElse, set r =c.\n\nWait this is a typical upper bound or lower bound? Let me think.\n\nSuppose we want to find the first index where the product is not less than x.\n\nWait when now is non-negative:\n\nsuppose the array a is sorted (as done earlier).\n\nWe are searching for elements a[c], where now *a[c] <x ?\n\nWait let's consider:\n\nSuppose now is fixed, and we are looking for all elements a[c] such that a[i] * a[c] <x.\n\nBut in the code, the binary search here is for the first position where the product is >=x, but I'm confused here.\n\nSuppose:\n\nSuppose we have a sorted array. We want to find how many elements in a where now*a[c] < x. Or the opposite?\n\nLet me think of the loop logic:\n\nThe binary search is narrowing down the lower and upper bounds.\n\nSuppose the loop finds the first a[c] where now*a[c] is >= x.\n\nThe variables l is initially 0 and r is n (the total number of elements).\n\nWait after exiting this loop, l here would be the first index where now * a[c] >=x. Because whenever the condition is 'now*a[c] < x', l is set to c+1 (moves upper limit upwards). Wait no:\n\nLet me take a simple example.\n\nLet me say the array is sorted ascending. So a[0], a[1],..., a[n-1] are sorted.\n\nIn the case now \u22650, since 'a' is already sorted, we can binary search.\n\nWait now is a[i], which is part of the array. So for a[i] being part of the array, the array is sorted, so for 'now' (a[i]) being part of the array, but this is in the check function over all 'i's. \n\nThe loop is finding, in the a array (already sorted), how many elements a[c] (could be any element including a[i]) such that now * a[c] < x ?\n\nWait the current code's loop in the Java code for the 'now >=0' case:\n\nThe loop code:\n\nFor a given now (which is a[i]), the code is trying to find how many a[c] match now*a[c] <x? Or the opposite.\n\nWait the code inside the while loop:\n\nIf (now*a[c] < x), then the code moves l up. So the target is to find the first c where now*a[c] >=x.\n\nTherefore, once the loop exits, l would be that first c.\n\nWait when you exit the loop, l is the leftmost position where a[c] * now >=x.\n\nThus the number of element where a[c] * now < x is exactly l (assuming the indices are from 0). Because from 0 to l-1 are the elements before the first element satisfying the condition, hence how many elements are less.\n\nWait the total elements before the cutoff would be l elements?\n\nWait perhaps the total is l elements where a[c] * now is less than x. So the count is l.\n\nWait that's how the code adds l to the tot.\n\nWait, example:\n\nSuppose the array is [1,2,3,4], now is 1, and x is 5.\n\nEach a[c] is multiplied by 1: 1,2,3,4.\n\nLooking for elements where a[c] * now <5 \u2192 1,2,3? Because 1*4 is 4 <5, but 1*4 is 4, but 1*3 is 3 <5, etc. The first element where the product is >=5 would be 5, which is at index 4 (when a[c]=4, 1*4=4 <5, so no. All elements are less than 5, so the cutoff is after 4 elements, so l=4. The number of elements less than x is 4, added to tot.\n\nSo the code is counting how many elements a[c] in the array (including potentially itself) where a[c]*now < x, and adding that to the total. \n\nWait in that case, for each a[i], the code counts how many a's entries (regardless of index) multiply with a[i] to be less than x. But then, since the array is sorted, this is the number of elements a_1 ... a_{l-1}, so the count is l. \n\nWait in the example, all 4 elements (indices 0,1,2,3 if zero-based array). \n\nYes, so the count is indeed l.\n\nThus, the code in the if (now >=0) case is counting the number of elements a_j where a[i] * a[j] < x, and adding that to the total.\n\nWait not exactly, but in the code, it's adding l, which is the leftmost index where a[c] * now >=x. So the number of elements <x is l (the cutoff index?), or the elements before l?\n\nWait in the binary search loop:\n\nfor now >=0, starting with l=0, r=n (presumably n is the array's length in Java). Each time, they split the array. If now * a[c] <x then the target is to the right, so set l to c+1. Else, set r to c.\n\nEventually, when loop ends, l is the index where the first a[c] that has product >=x. So elements before l (0 to l-1) would not meet that, so there are l elements which are less? Or the other way around?\n\nWait:\n\nSuppose in the array, after the search, l is the first element (smallest index) where a[c] * now >=x. So all elements before that (indices less that l) have a[c]*now <x. So the number of elements with a[c] * now <x is l. \n\nHence, the code adds l to the 'tot' variable. \n\nTherefore, for the now >=0 case, the code is counting all entries where product <x, and adding those. So the total for now (the a[i]) is the number of a elements less than x/a_i. Wait perhaps. \n\nWait but the code is also adjusting for the case when a[i] itself is considered? \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires considering all pairs i,j except (i,i)? Because in the code's loop:\n\nAfter computing tot for each i, it has an adjustment:\n\nif (a[i] squared is less than x) \u2192 subtract 1 from tot.\n\nPerhaps this is to exclude when a[i] * a[i] would be part of the product?\n\nWait let me look at the code again.\n\nIn the Java code, after the loop over the elements in the binary search, then:\n\n'if ( (long)a[i] * a[i] <x ) tot -=1 '\n\nAh, when calculating for each a[i], the code is counting the products a[i]*a[j] for all elements j (including j=i), but when doing so, when a[i]^2 is less than x, that would count it in the products, but in the problem's context, perhaps the loop includes i and j as any two indices, but if the number of pairs (i,j) where i and j can be the same? But the problem might consider ordered pairs or unordered. The code's approach of dividing tot by 2 suggests that each pair (i,j) and (j,i) are considered separately and divided by 2 (if the pair counts unordered pairs). But that's a side issue.\n\nThe adjustment is needed because when a[i]*a[i] is less than x, then the element when j=i is counted but shouldn't be when calculating unordered pairs or if self-pairs are excluded. But the adjustment here might be necessary due to how the calculations are done. The code's 'tot' counts for each i, the number of j's (including j=i?) such that a_i *a_j <x, and then adds all those counts. Since each pair is counted twice (once for i and j, unless i =j). So when you divide by 2, the total is the number of unordered pairs (i,j), but including where i =j?\n\nWait perhaps the code adds all pairs (i,j) where product <x, and counts them, but since the problem likely counts ordered pairs? Or perhaps the question says something different, but in any case, the code uses this logic.\n\nThe critical part for the Fortran translation is to track this exactly.\n\nNow, going back to variables. \n\nFirst, when translating to Fortran:\n\nIn the check function, the variable 'l2' and 'r2' are declared. In Java, they are integers initialized as 0 and n, but in Fortran:\n\nFortran arrays are 1-based here (since the a array is read from 1 to n), so in the 'now >=0' case, the l and r should be set as 0 and n. Wait here's the problem: in Fortran arrays start at 1, but the code is using l=0 which may be out of bounds.\n\nWait the code in the original Java has:\n\nin the first case (now >=0):\n\nl=0 and r =n. The code is doing a binary search between 0 and n. So the elements considered are from 0 to n-1, but in Fortran, the array is from 1 to n. So the translated code might have indices off by one.\n\nHmm, this is a critical issue.\n\nBecause the Java code's array is 0-based, so when in the 'now >=0' case, they have l=0 and r =n (the array's length). So when the 'c' variable is (l + r)/2, the index can be 0 or n, but the elements are only from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn the original code's scenario:\n\nnow is a[i] in the Java code, which ranges from 0 to n-1 (since the loop is for i from 0 to n\u20141).\n\nBut the array is of length n. Thus, in the binary search for the indices, the possible 'c' is 0-based in the Java code.\n\nThus in the Fortran code:\n\nThe array is 1-based (since we read from 1 to n). So to translate the indices, the original l and r (in the Java code) of 0 and n can be mapped to Fortran's using 1-based indices:\n\nFor example:\n\nl in Java's case (0) becomes 1 in Fortran?\n\nWait no, perhaps:\n\nSuppose in the Java code's binary search, the initial l is 0 and r is n, so the possible indices are 0,1,...,n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, the same indices would be 1 to n. Wait since in Fortran, when we have i from 1 to n, the indices are 1-based. \n\nTherefore to map between:\n\nJava's index 0 \u2192 Fortran's 1?\n\nBut that complicates the loops. To avoid confusion, perhaps in the Fortran code's binary search loops, adjust variables accordingly.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe logic in the Java code for 'now >=0' is:\n\nThe binary search is over the indices 0 to N-1 (since the array elements are 0-based). The search's l starts at 0, r at N (exclusive?), but in Java's arrays, accessing a[c] where c is n-1 is the last element.\n\nWait in Java:\n\nIn the first loop (for each a[i]), the array has indices 0 to n-1. The initial l and r are 0 and n, so the condition is while l < r, and c = (l + r)/2. So the possible 'c' can be up to n. But when 'c' is n, then a[c] is beyond the array boundary.\n\nWait that's a bug in the Java code? Or perhaps a mistake in the code?\n\nWait in Java: the array a has n elements from 0 to n-1. The code in the binary search for 'now >=0' sets l =0, r=n. So for the first iteration when l=0 and r =n, the c= (0 +n)/2 \u2192 drops to integer division.\n\nBut when c is exactly N (if l had been n, which it can't).\n\nWait when r is n (exclusive?), so a[c] must be in the valid indices (0..n-1).\n\nWait wait the loop condition is l <r. So when l and r are 0 and n, the loop runs when (0 <n) is true for positive n.\n\nInside, c = (0 +n)/2.\n\nSuppose n=4. Then c is 2 (since (0+4)/2=2.\n\nAt each step, the loop proceeds until l >= r. Thus, the iterations will ensure that c is between l and r-1. Because when (l +r)/2 is (l +r-1)/2?\n\nWait sorry, integer division in Java: (l + r) /2.\n\nLet me think when l=0, r=4:\n\nc=(0+4)/2=2 \u2192 a[2] is valid (since n=4, indices 0 to3).\n\nThe next iterations:\n\nSuppose if the condition is a[c] < x, then l = c +1 (starting with 0). Let's say at c=2: if the test condition (a[c]<x) is true \u2192 set l to 3. Then next loop.\n\nEventually, the loop will exit with l=4. In which case, then adding l (4) to totals. But the array only has elements 0,1,2,3. The count would be 4 elements. Maybe that's allowed. Thus the code is expecting that the initial l and r are set so that when the binary search loop ends, l is the first position beyond n (but the count is l, which can be 'n', but adding 'n' might have been out of array, but in terms of counts, that's okay).\n\nWait the binary search in this setup:\n\nThe code's for the now >=0 case:\n\nThe code is trying to count the number of elements a[c] (where c ranges from 0 to n-1) such that now*a[c] <x. The binary search is locating the first c where condition is not met. The count is then l (which has gone beyond the index of the last element) \u2192 l can be from 0 to n. The count of elements before is then l. Which can include 0 (when all are less) up to n (meaning none are less \u2192 count is 0? Wait no, perhaps n is when all elements were more than the desired value.)\n\nWait maybe the logic is okay.\n\nIn terms of translating to Fortran:\n\nThe solution is to adjust the arrays' indices and loops.\n\nFirst, the array 'a' is 1-based in Fortran.\n\nThe variables l2 and r2 in the 'now >=0' case must be initialized to 0 and n. But since the Fortran array's indices go from 1 to n, then when c is (l +r)/2:\n\nBut for l =0 and r =n, then when c is 0, accessing a(c) which would be invalid. Thus, there's a problem in the binary search's indices. \n\nWait this is a bug in the original Java code?\n\nBecause if the array has indices from 0 to n-1, then in the loop, when l=0 and c is 0, then a[c] is valid.\n\nBut in the Fortran code with a 1-based array, this would be problematic.\n\nWait to replicate the behavior, perhaps we need to shift the indices in the loops.\n\nThus, perhaps in the Fortran code, instead of using 0-based indices for l and r, we should adjust them to be 1-based. Let's try to adjust:\n\nIn the Java code, the original loop in check function:\n\nNow the variables l (for now non-negative):\n\nl starts at 0 (exclusive?), or what is the exact logic?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the Fortran code's loops, we can set 'l2' to 0 and 'r2' to n, but when accessing a(c2) in the loop, we have:\n\nWait NO: the fortran array starts at 1. thus, if c2 is zero, then accessing a(c2) is invalid. \n\nSo to avoid this, we need to adjust the indices so that they start at 1. \n\nWait perhaps in Fortran:\n\nFor the case when now is non-negative:\n\nThe search for the first position where a[c] * now \u2265x.\n\nIn the original code's scenario:\n\nnow's array elements are in indices 0 to n-1 (Java's zero-based). \n\nWe want to map these to Fortran's array's indices 1 to n.\n\nTherefore:\n\nthe l (start) would be 1 (for the first element), instead of 0, and the r is n+1? \n\nHmm, this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fortran code, for the variables l2 and r2, perhaps adjust the initial settings:\n\nWait:\n\nIn the original Java:\n\nfor now >=0 case:\n\nl starts at 0, r starts at n.\n\nThus, the maximum index is n-1 (because if l reaches n, r was n and that is out of the array).\n\nTherefore in the fortran code, to make the indices 1-based:\n\nthe equivalent would be setting l2 (for the original 0) to 1, and r2 (n) to n+1?\n\nWait but then when calculating c2, (l2 + r2)/2 might land outside the array again.\n\nAlternatively: perhaps in FORTRAN, to map all indices to 1-based, when original code had l=0, r =n, set them to l2=1 and r2=n+1?\n\nWait perhaps the Fix is:\n\nAdjust the code so that:\n\nIn the code's Java loops, when the original code uses l=0 to r=n (exclusive), in Fortran, they should be l=1 and r = n+1, so that the binary search still runs in the indices from 1 to n (inclusive), and the initial values are such that the midpoint is computed properly.\n\nLet me try to redefine variables for Fortran:\n\nIn the 'now >=0' case:\n\nthe initial variables:\n\nl2 =0 \u2192 1 (since original)\n\nr2 =n (but n is the array size 1-based) \u2192 thus in java, the upper was 'n' (the exclusive limit?), so perhaps in Fortran, the upper bound is n?\n\nWait perhaps better to just shift the indices.\n\nIn the original code's binary search:\n\nfor the element 'now':\n\nfor a[i], the array is 0-based in java (a has indices 0 to n-1). The binary search is over 0-based indices, so the code's l starts at 0 and r starts at n (indices 0 to n-1 is covered by this).\n\nIn Fortran's code with 1-based indexing, the equivalent for the array indices 1 to n requires l and r to be set to l2 =0 and r2 =n+1. This way the initial range covers indices from 0 to n, which when l is 0 and r is n+1:\n\nthe loop will process until convergence, so the midpoint will be between 0 and n+1, which can reach the indices 1..n.\n\nWait this may not work properly. Perhaps a better approach is to convert the loop ranges to 1-based by adjusting the indices:\n\nIn FORTRAN code for the case now >=0:\n\nlogical variables:\n\nl2 and r2 in the original Java are 0 and n (array from 0 to n-1).\n\nIn Fortran, since the array is 1-based (indices 1 to n):\n\nthey have to be l2=1 and r2 =n +1.\n\nBut then the binary search loops will iterate with the midpoint being (l2 +r2)/2, which can sometimes point be beyond the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adjust l and r initial values to start at 1 and n, which covers 1..n-1? No, because:\n\nWait in FORTRAN arrays 1-based, the indices are exactly the same as the java' s 0-based array except shifted +1.\n\nSo:\n\nTo map array element a (java's index 0 \u2192fortran's index 1), a's 1 \u2192 FORTRAN's 2..., up to JAVA's n-1 \u2192 Fortran's n.\n\nThus, the previous code's l (JAVA's zero-based starting at 0) corresponds to FORTRAN's starting at 1 (which java 0 \u2192 FORTRAN 1). \n\nthus:\n\nJAVA's l=0 \u2192 FORTRAN's l=1,\n\nJAVA's r=n (since the endpoints are exclusive?) the maximum is n, so starting at r= n+1?\n\nWait:\n\nSince in FORTRAN's binary search for the same indices, it's confusing.\n\nPerhaps the following approach:\n\nIn the original Java code, for the 'now >=0' binary search on indices 0 ...n-1 (so n elements). So in FORTRAN's indices need to represent this same range as indices 1..n (Fortran's indices). \n\nThus, the variables l2 and r2 (the fortran equivalents) should start at 0 and n+1?\n\nNO, perhaps:\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nl2 =1\n\nr2 =n+1\n\nthen the binary search boundaries are from 1 to n. But the midpoint would be (1 +n+1)/2?\n\nThis may work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize l2 and r2 as 0 and n (in JAVA' s variables), but in FORTRAN, the variables l2 and r2 will track the same relationship, but the array is accessed with (c2) starting at 1?\n\nWait no, that's confusing. \n\nAlternatively, in FORTRAN, shift all the variables so the range l2 to r2 in FORTRAN's code covers 1 to n elements.\n\nWait in Java, the loop is for indices 0-based:\n\nThe starting l is 0 (as in the first element 0), r is n (so that the first iteration considers the mid of [0, n). Thus, all indices from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn FORTRAN's 1-based array, the indices are 1 to n. So the equivalent would be l2 =0 (but this is not valid since the array starts at 1) \u2192 so need to adjust so that the FORTRAN loops are shifted.\n\nSo, to fix this, in the FORTRAN code's 'now >=0' case:\n\nWe can start with l2 =1 and r2 =n+1. Since the binary search will end when l+1 ==r, and the indices must stay within 1..n.\n\nWait here's what I can proposes:\n\nIn the FORTRAN code's 'now >=0' block:\n\nl2 = 1, r2 =n+1\n\nthen the loop runs while l2 <r2.\n\nc2 = (l2 + r2)/2.\n\nNow, in this case:\n\nWhen c2 is between 1 and n, the access to a(c2) is valid.\n\nIf c2 exceeds n, then a(c2) would be out of bounds. However in this scenario when r2 is set to n+1 and the loop is executed:\n\nFor example, let's say n=5 (i.e. FORTRAN's array has indices 1 to5. The original code's JAVA case would allow indices 0-4).\n\nIn FORTRAN's case, the initial l2 is 1, r2 is6.\n\nFirst, c2 is (1+6)/2=3.5 \u21923 (using integer division, but need to see FORTRAN's division).\n\nIn Fortran integer division, (1+6)/2 is (7/2)=3.5 \u2192 but in Fortran, with integer division (subject to kind), it would be (1+6)/2 =3 provided we are using integer variables.\n\nWait assuming all variables are integer*8, the division is integer.\n\nThus calculating c2=(l2 + r2)//2 \u2192 in integers truncate towards 0.\n\nThus in FORTRAN, c2 would be (l2 + r2)/2. Since (1+6)/2 is 3.5 \u2192 3.\n\nBut when l2 and r2 are 5 and6 \u2192 their sum is 11/2 \u21925.5 \u21925.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nThen, for the conditions:\n\nif (now * a(c2) <x \u2192 set l=l2 to c2+1?\n\nWait the condition is:\n\nif (now*a(c2) <x \u2192 then the target is to c2 on the right?\n\nWait not sure, maybe proceed as follows.\n\nInside 'now >=0' block in Fortran's code:\n\ninitialize l2 =1, r2= n+1 (so that the initial max is beyond the array's indices). Then during the binary search loop:\n\nSteps:\n\nwhile l2 < r2 :\n\n    c2 = (l2 + r2)/2\n\n    if ( now * a(c2) <x \u2192 then the current c2 is still part of the \"less than x\" elements, so need to move the left boundary up.\n\n    so:\n\n    if ( now * a(c2) <x ) then \n\n        l2 = c2 +1\n\n    else \n\n        r2 =c2\n\n    end if\n\nAt the end of this loop, l2 is the first index (1-based) where the element a(c2) multiplied by now is >=x. \n\nThe count of elements less then is l2-1 ?\n\nBecause the indices from 1 up to l2-1 are the elements where the product is less than x. \n\nTherefore the count would be l2-1.\n\nBut in the original java code, they added 'l' ( which was from 0). The original code added 'l' (JAVA's l variable was the count, which was the number of elements found). \n\nWait in JAVA's original case, for the same example scenario (a has n elements and indices0..n-1), in case where l_converges to 'k', then the count of elements with product <x is k.\n\nSo if in Fortran's l2 is converging to the first element's index where condition is met, then the count is l2 -1-0 = l2 -1 ?\n\nWait for example:\n\nIf in the FORTRAN code's indices 1-n:\n\nand l2=3 (so a(2) is the last element that's less than), then 3-1=2 elements have passed?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose l2 is set to the first index (1-based) where a[index] * now >=x.\n\nThe count would be index-1 (how many are before it). \n\nThus the number of elements less than is (l2 -1).\n\nHence in the FORTRAN code's now >=0 case, the total would be adding l2 -1.\n\nBut in the original code, the 'l' was added.\n\nSo the code would have to be:\n\n  l2 =1 \n\n  r2 =n+1\n\n  while ( ... ) \n\n  then after the loop, \n\ntot = tot + l2-1\n\nWait this is the key change.\n\nTherefore, the shift from zero-based to one-based introduces an adjustment.\n\nSimilarly, when handling the 'else case (now <0):\n\nIn Java code, the variables were l=0 and r= n. Same as before.\n\nneed to adjust the indices and the count accordingly.\n\nLet me consider the 'else' case (now is negative):\n\nIn Java code:\n\n    int l=0, r=n;\n    while( l <r ){\n        int c = (l+r)/2; \n        if( now*a[c] >= x ) \u2192 then set l to c+1 ?\n\nWait the condition here is in the now <0 case:\n\nThe binary search is finding the indices where now * a[c] >= x.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn this case, now is negative. To make sure that:\n\nThe 'now' is negative. The code is in the else case.\n\nIn the loop for this else case:\n\nThe code's condition is now * a[c] vs x.\n\nWe want to find for each a[c] where the product is >=x?\n\nThe loop's action:\n\nif now*a[c] >= x \u2192 set l to c+1? \n\nWait the loop is conditioned to find the first position where now*a[c] < x?\n\nSimilar to the previous case. \n\nWait let me think:\n\nThe current loop's end:\n\nAfter the loop finishes, l's value is the first position (index in Java's 0-based) where the product is <x.\n\nWait the code is similar to the previous case. The code increments 'l' or reduces 'r' based on the comparison.\n\nAfter the loop, 'tot' is added with (n-l).\n\nWhich seems to add the number of positions from l to n (because n-l is the count for the else case?):\n\nWait in Java's else case (now negative):\n\ntot += (n - l). \n\nWhich equals to the number of indexes from l to n\u20141 (since the array has 0 to n-1)? Thus (n - l).\n\nSo in Fortran's adjusted case, the code would be similar.\n\nNow, transforming that into FORTRAN:\n\nIn the 'now <0' case in FORTRAN:\n\nVariables:\n\nl2 starts at 1, r2 at n+1 again.\n\ninside the loop:\n\nwhile l2 <r2:\n\n    c2 = (l2 +r2)/2\n\n    if( now*a(c2) >= x ) \u2192 \n\n    then need to move l2 to c+1 ? \n\nSuppose:\n\nThe current condition (now is negative, so the \">=x\" is part of the condition.\n\nThe loop will tracks where the first a[c] is found such that the product is <x. \n\nWait:\n\nWe want to count how many a[c] multiplied by now (which is negative) give a product less than x \u2192?\n\nBecause in the code's else case (now<0):\n\n    the \"tot += (n-l)\" is added.  \n    The code logic here is perhaps adding the count of elements for which a[i] * a[c] <x ?\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to see that the code in Java adds (n-l):\n\nIn FORTRAN, since n is the array length (1-based, array of size 'n'), then the original java 'n' (number of elements) is same. \n\nIn the else case, the count is (n - l) in Java's code.\n\nSince Java's l is the index where a[c]*now <x. \n\nWait for the else case:\n\nThe code:\n\nafter the loop:\n\n    tot += (n -l)\n\nHere, l is the first index where the condition is not met (since the 'now' is negative).\n\nThus, the count is how many a[c] are after this point?\n\nWait the else case involves:\n\n    while (l <r) {\n        if (now*a[c] >=x \u2192 then set l = c+1 ?\n    }\n\nSo in this case, the code finds the first position c where the condition is now*a[c] <x \u2192 so l after the loop is the first position where it is true (or beyond?), so the elements from that index onward would give products less than x?\n\nWait it's a bit hard to track without tracing variables.\n\nBut regardless of that, the critical point for the FORTRAN code's else case is when handling the 1-based array:\n\nthe code in FORTRAN's else case would then after the loop:\n\nthe 'tot' addition would require converting Java's l (0-based) to FORTRAN's variables.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nJAVA:\n\ntot = tot + (n - l)\n\nWhere l is 0-based index.\n\nIn FORTRAN, after calculating l2:\n\nthe equivalent is:\n\ntot + ( ( n ) - (l2 -1 -1 )  ??? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nIn FORTRAN, when converting the 0-based l from JAVA:\n\nJAVA's 'l' in else case is the first index (0-based) such that a[c]*now <x? \n\nIf that is the case, then the count of such elements is (n - JAVA's l).\n\nBut in FORTRAN, since the indices are shifted by 1:\n\nJAVA's l corresponds to FORTRAN's (l_ in Java ) + 1. \n\nWait no, FORTRAN's l2 after the loop (initialized to 1, r2 = n+1):\n\nThe initial variables are l2 and r2.\n\nAt the end of the loop in FORTRAN's case:\n\nfor the else condition, after the loop, the l2 is the first index (1-based) where a(c)*now <x. \n\nThe count of elements from l2 to n would be (n - l2 +1 \u2192 since in 1-based). \n\nSo the JAVA's count is (n - l) \u2192 JAVA's l is (fortran_l -1). Because:\n\nJAVA index = FORTRAN's index-1.\n\nThus JAVA's target (n-l) \u2192 the fortran's analog would be: \n\nJAVA's l (\tJPanel's l) =fortran's l's index -1.\n\nThus n - l in JAVA = n - (fortran's selected l) +1 \n\nWait let's suppose:\n\nJAVA's l is the number of elements before the first condition. \n\nWait perhaps it's better to recast variables and conditions:\n\nThe goal is to make the FORTRAN code count correctly when translated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nIgnore the indices and modify the code's logic.\n\nPerhaps the easiest path is:\n\nThe original code in Java:\n\nThe key variables l and r start at 0 and n (zero-based).\n\nIn FORTRAN, the variables should start at 1 and n+1 (so the array indices are within 1..n).\n\nBut when you compute the count, the adjustment would be required t o account for the shift:\n\ntot += (l) \u2192 in original's 'now \u22650' case,\n\nthus in FORTRAN, the FORTRAN's l's value minus 1 is the nuber of elements before ( since it's 1-based).\n\nWait, in FORTRAN:\n\n    now is a[i] (which is a(1) to a(n) in FORTRAN).\n\n    For the 'now >=0' case:\n\n    compute l2 = ... the loop's end l2 is the first position where a(l2) *now >=x \u2192 so the count of elements less is (l2-1) elements (from 1 to l2-1). \n\nThus the code would do:\n\ntot = tot + (l2 -1)\n\nSimilarly in the else case:\n\nthe loop finds first index where a(c2)*now <x \u2192 so the elements before (including?) that index?\n\nThus:\n\n    after loop, we have l2 = first index where a(c2)*now <x \u2192 the elements from 1 to l2-1 may have been the ones with product >=x, so total of (n - (l2-1) ) elements? \n\n    So the code would be tot += (n - (l2 -1) )\n\n    Wait the original JAVA for else case adds (n -l ). \n\n    Since in FORTRAN's case, l_java is (l2 -1), because FORTRAN's indices are off by one.\n\n    Thus, for else case the JAVA's l is (l1_FORTRAN -1).\n\n    The JAVA expression (n -l ) \u2192 n - (l_f\u22121) \u2192 n +1 - l_f.\n\n    Thus, in the FORTRAN:\n\n    Else case:\n\n    tot += ( (n ) - ( (l2) -1) )\n\nBut not sure, this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to do shifts, we can:\n\n- use 0-based arrays in FORTRAN by changing the code.\n\nFor that, in the FORTRAN array, the declaration:\n\ninteger(8),dimension(0:n-1) \u2192 but need to declare the size first. It's possible in FORTRAN.\n\nAlternatively, use an array with a lower bound of 0.\n\nBut in FORTRAN it's possible via:\n\ninteger(8) , dimension(lb:ub) allocatable :: a\n\nthen allocate(a(0:n-1)), after reading n.\n\nThis way the array indices can be 0-based.\n\nThen, in FORTRAN code it's easier to mirror the JAVA indices.\n\nLet me modify that.\n\nThis way the array can be accessed with indices 0 to n-1 like in JAVA.\n\nHence:\n\nRevised plan for code translation:\n\nIn the FORTRAN program's main:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n\n2. allocate a(0: n-1) \u2192 array 0-based.\n\nThus the i loops from 0 to n-1 in the FORTRAN code, directly mirroring JAVA's.\n\nThis avoids index shifts and compatibility issues.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc155_d\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: i, n\ninteger(8) :: k, INF, l, r, c\n\ninteger(8), allocatable :: a(:)\n\nread*, n, k\n\nallocate(a(0:n-1)) ! zero-based array\n\nread*, a(0:n-1)\n\n!

Alternatively, include a sorting subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, use a procedure. \n\nWait but if the fortran compiler supports intrinsic sort, like in modern compilers (GFortran, Intel), then the following code may work.\n\nAlternatively, if not:\n\n -- the code may need to implement a sort routine.\n\nBut assuming that we can use sort(a) for an integer array.\n\nThus this code should work.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. The array is declared as a(0:) to be 0-based.\n\n2. All array accesses are compatible with the original JAVA indices (e.g., a[i], and loops from 0 to n-1)\n\n3. The 'check' function now correctly uses the indices, and the variables l2 and r2 can be initialized as 0 and n (java's approach), which works.\n\nThe only possible issue is the data type for the variables.\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\n- integers are at least 4 bytes. But the problem may contain numbers up to 1e18, so the variables are required as 64-bit integers. So the kind number is important.\n\nThe variables 'integer(8)' would allocate 64 bits, which is needed for values up to 1e18.\n\nIn declaring literals like '1e18', which is 1e18, but in FORTRAN, to denote as an 64-bit integer, it's needed to write '1000000000000000000_8' (1e18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros).\n\nAlternatively, use double precision for x and variables where needed:\n\nWait, for example, checking 'now * a(c2) <x', in FORTRAN:\n\nIf now is an integer(8) and a(c2) is integer(8), then their product is also integer(8), and comparing to x (integer(8)). Thus it should work.\n\nThus the code above should be a valid translation.\n\nTesting potential issues:\n\nThe 'sort' needs to sort the integer array in ascending order. \n\nthe INF is 1e18 + 1 \u2192 written with integer(8) literal.\n\nNow, in the code's check function:\n\n the variables l2 and r2 are initialized as Java's.\n\nIn the case 'now >=0': \n\nThe loop runs with l2=0 and r2 =n (number of elements). \n\nThe binary search identifies l2 (the first position where now*a(c2)>=x \u2192 thus the count is l2 entries where product <x (indices 0..l2-1). So tot += l2 \u2192 same as JAVA.\n\n else case:\n\nthe loop returns l2 being the first position where the product is <x (now negative is multiplied by a(c2). Thus the elements from l2 onwards have product <x. but since now <0, the product >=x when the condition is met?\n\nWait in the code's else case:\n\nfor now negative:\n\nthe code including a different condition and adding (n - l2). Let's see:\n\nThe loop when now is negative:\n\nthe else block code:\n\nif (now*a(c2) >=x \u2192 then set l2=c2+1.\n\nAt the end, the loop has l2 = the first index where now*a(c2) <x.\n\nthis means before that (indices 0 to l2-1 elements), they are the a's for which the product >=x, thus the count of those is l2 elements. \n\nThe code adds (n - l2) \u2192 because the total elements for which product <x are the remaining elements ( >=l2), count of elements is (n - l2).\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nTherefore this code should work.\n\nNow the final answer is this FORTRAN code:\n\nI must ensure that the code uses the correct declarations and syntax. Here's the final code:\n\nBut also note in the JAVA code, the 'tot -=1' part:\n\n// after the loops:\n\n    if ( (now * a[i] )^2 < x \u2192 etc. \n\nWait in the JAVA code:\n\n // has \n\n        if ( (long)a[i] * a[i] <x ) tot-- ;\n\nWait in the JAVA code's inner loop, after calculating l and adding it or n-l to tot:\n\nthen they calculate a[i] multiplied by itself (which is the same as now * a[i], but wait since now is a[i], so it's a squared.\n\nYes.\n\nIn FORTRAN:\n\nif ( now * now <x )  \u2192 then subtract 1 from tot.\n\nThus, that part should be fine.\n\nSo the code above seems correct.\n\nNow ensure that the code uses allocatable arrays (allocating a(0:n-1) after reading n).\n\nThus:\n\nThe correct FORTRAN code is as follows:\n\nHere's the code with comments and proper declarations."
