Wait wait the Java code would have an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException here if n=1. Because when a=1, the array has length 1, so indices 0. For i=0, then i+1 = 1, which is out of bounds. So this Java code is incorrect for n=1? Hmm. Wait but that seems like a mistake in the original code. Because if n is 1, the min calculation when i is the first element (i=0) would try to access ar[1], which is not present. Wait, perhaps the problem requires that n >= 2? Probably, since the problem statement for codeforces 567A may have constraints n >= 2? Wait let me check the problem (since maybe I should know that, but I'm reconstructing).",

Perhaps the problem expects n >= 2, so the code is correct given the problem constraints. So assuming that's the case, maybe we can proceed. Other edge cases: when n=2. Take n=2.

So the first component is max(ar(2) -ar(1) ) Wait no, max is between (ar(1)- ar(1) and ar(n) - ar(1) \u2192 so when n=2, ar(2) - ar(1). So the max is that, the second term is bigger.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to translate this Java code into Fortran. Let's see what the code does first. The Java code reads some integers, stores them in an array, then loops through each element calculating a max and a min, and prints those values each iteration. \n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The first thing the Java programs does is read an integer 'a', which is the size of the array. Then it reads 'a' integers into the array 'ar'. \n\nThen for each element in the array, the maximum is calculated as the max between (current element - first element) and (last element - current element). Wait no, looking at the code again: For each i, max is set to the max of (ar[i] - ar[0]) and (ar[ar.length-1] - ar[i]). Oh right, so for each position, the max is the larger of the distance from the first element and the distance to the last element. Interesting.\n\nThen, the min calculation varies depending on the position of i. If i is the first element (i=0), the min is the difference between the next element and current. If it's the last element (i=ar.length-1), it's the difference between current and previous. Else, it's the minimum between the previous difference and next difference. \n\nThe code then prints min and max for each iteration. \n\nNow, translating this into Fortran. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, handling input. In Java, they use Scanner, so in Fortran, we can use READ(*,*) to read from standard input. The first input is the integer 'a', which in Fortran would be an integer variable, say 'n'. Then, the array can be declared as an integer array of size n. But in Fortran, arrays are 1-based by default unless specified. Oh, but in the Java code, the array is 0-based. So I need to be careful with the indices.\n\nWait, in Fortran, if I declare an array AR(10), then the indices are from 1 to 10. But in Java, it's 0-based. So when translating the loops and indices, I have to adjust for that. \n\nSo first step:\n\nRead n. Then read n integers into the array. Let me think.\n\nIn Fortran code structure:\n\nRead the value of n.\n\nThen read the array elements. So perhaps something like:\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(ar(n))  -- wait no, since in Fortran, unless using allocatable arrays, we need to declare with a constant size. Alternatively, using an allocatable array. Let me see, the Java version uses an array size set by the user, so in Fortran, probably better to use an allocatable array.\n\nSo, first lines:\n\nprogram codeforces567a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, max_val, min_val\n\ninteger, dimension(:), allocatable :: ar\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(ar(n))\n\nread(*,*) (ar(i), i=1,n)\n\nThen, the loops. The main loop is over each element. So for each i from 1 to n, do the calculations.\n\nWait, the Java code uses 0-based indices. So in the original Java code:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < ar.length; i++)\n\nSo when i is 0 in Java, in Fortran, that would correspond to i=1 (since Fortran starts at 1). So when translating the indices, need to shift appropriately.\n\nThe Java code's first loop initializes the array with ar[i] = s.nextInt(). In Fortran, that's handled by the read statement already.\n\nNow, the main computations:\n\nFor each i in 1 to n:\n\nmax_val = max( ar(i) - ar(1), ar(n) - ar(i) )\n\nWait, because in Java's code, ar[0] is the first element, so in Fortran, that's ar(1). Similarly, the last element in Java is ar.length-1 which in Fortran would be ar(n).\n\nSo for max, it's the maximum between current element minus first element or last element minus current element.\n\nThen for min_val, Java checks the value of i:\n\nIf i ==0 (Fortran i = 1), min_val is ar[i+1] (Java's ar[1]) minus ar[i] (ar[0] in Java is now ar(1) in Fortran). Wait, so in Ftorn i=1 (Java i=0), the next element is i+1=2 in Fortran, and the current is i=1.\n\nWait let me make sure. Let me suppose in Java:\n\nJava indices:\n\nfor i from 0 to a-1:\n\nIn Fortran indices from 1 to n.\n\nThus, in min calculation:\n\nIn Java, first i=0:\n\nmin = ar[i+1] - ar[i] \u2192 in Fortran, when i = 1, that would be ar(2) - ar(1). The next elements are same.\n\nSo yes, when i == 0 in Java (i=1 in Fortran's index? No. Wait Java's i=0 corresponds to Fortran's i=1). So yes, the first element is i=1 in Fortran, so the code should check whether i == 1 (since Java's i=0 is i=1 in Fortran terms) for the first element.\n\nSimilarly, the last element: in Java when i == ar.length-1 \u2192 which is (a-1), so in Fortran that's i =n.\n\nSo for min:\n\nif (i ==1) \u2192 (i is first element, so min is next element - current.\n\nElse if (i ==n) \u2192 last element, so min is current minus previous.\n\nElse:\n\nmin is the minimum between (ar(i) - ar(i-1)), and (ar(i+1) - ar(i)).\n\nWait the java code has for the middle elements:\n\nelse min = Math.min( ar[i] - ar[i-1], ar[i+1] - ar[i] )\n\nYes, right, that's the min between previous difference and next difference.\n\nSo in Fortran the code inside the loop would be:\n\ndo i = 1, n\n\n   max_val = max( ar(i) - ar(1), ar(n) - ar(i) )\n\n   if (i ==1) then\n\n      min_val = ar(i+1) - ar(i)\n\n   else if (i ==n) then\n\n      min_val = ar(i) - ar(i-1)\n\n   else\n\n      min_val = min(ar(i) - ar(i-1), ar(i+1) - ar(i) )\n\n   end if\n\n   print*, min_val, max_val\n\nend do\n\nWait, but the code in Java outputs min followed by max, with a space. So in Fortran's print statement, same thing, using ' ' separated, and maybe formatting.\n\nWait, the print statement in Fortran might need a format. The Java code uses System.out.println which adds a new line. So in Fortran, the print*, would handle that as well.\n\nWait, but let me check for the loops.\n\nBut let me also check the original code for any other points.\n\nWait, in Java's code, the max is re-assigned every time. Wait, in one line: max = Math.max(ar[i]-ar[0], ar[ar.length-1] - ar[i]);\n\nYes, so for each iteration, the max is being computed as the maximum between those two values. So in Fortran that's straightforward using the max function.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the intrinsic functions for max and min. So 'max(a,b)' returns the maximum, 'min(a,b)' the minimum. So that's okay.\n\nNow the code's variables:\n\nIn the Java code, 'max' and 'min' are initialized to 0, but they get overwritten each loop. So in Fortran, maybe variables can be declared inside (since it's within the loop). But in Fortran variables have to be declared before the loop. So the variables max_val and min_val would be declared.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the array correctly with the indices. Also, the Fortran array starts at 1, so we have to be careful when accessing the first and last elements.\n\nWait, about the max computation. If the array in fortran is 1 based, then the first element is ar(1) and last is ar(n). So the max is:\n\nmax( ar(i) - ar(1), ar(n) - ar(i) )\n\nWhich is exactly what the Java code does, with the adjusted indices, so that's correct.\n\nNow let's see the steps for the code.\n\nProgram structure:\n\nprogram codeforces567a\n\nimplicit none\n\ninteger :: n, i, max_val, min_val\n\ninteger, allocatable :: ar(:)\n\nread(*,*) n\n\nallocate(ar(n))\n\nread(*,*) (ar(i), i=1,n)\n\ndo i=1, n\n\n   max_val = max(ar(i) - ar(1), ar(n) - ar(i))\n\n   if (i == 1) then\n\n       min_val = ar(i+1) - ar(i)\n\n   else if (i == n) then\n\n       min_val = ar(i) - ar(i-1)\n\n   else\n\n       min_val = min( ar(i) - ar(i-1), ar(i+1) - ar(i) )\n\n   end if\n\n   print*, min_val, max_val\n\nend do\n\ndeallocate(ar)\n\nend program codeforces567a\n\nWait but does fortran require to deallocate the array? Depending on which compiler, perhaps. Though in some old versions, you need to but modern Fortran allows allocation and deallocation automatically, but it's better to be explicit. Wait allocatable arrays should be deallocated. Or is it deallocated when the program ends? Hmm, but in this case, since its at end of program, perhaps it's not necessary, but better to do so. So the deallocate is added after the loop.\n\nWait, but in code structure, the allocation is inside the program, so before the end program, but after the loop. So that's okay.\n\nTesting edge cases. For example, when n=1:\n\nWait in that case, when n is 1, the code will have issues. Let's see.\n\nSuppose n=1. Then in the loop, i=1.\n\nmax_val is (ar(1) - ar(1)) and (ar(1) - ar(1)), so both zero, so max is 0.\n\nFor the min:\n\nsince i is 1 and also n=1, the code will go into the second condition (i ==n):\n\nso min_val is ar(1) - ar(0)? Wait no. Wait in the code, for i==n, which is 1, then the code is ar(i) - ar(i-1). But ar(i-1) is ar(0). Which is outside the array's bounds because i=1, i-1=0, but array starts at 1. That will cause a runtime error.\n\nAh! Wait this is a problem. Because in the Java code, when n=1, the code is okay since in Java, when n is 1, the code would have i=0 (since ar is size 1), so the loop runs from i=0 to 0. So when i=0, in Java's code, since i is first element, it would compute min = ar[1] - ar[0], but ar[1] is out of bounds? No, wait n is one, so ar has length 1. So ar.length-1 is 0, but the loop for i in 0 (since i <1). Let me check the Java code when n is 1.\n\nWait in the case where a=1, the code has:\n\nthe loop runs for i from 0 to 0.\n\nWhen i is 0, it's the first element (the only element). Then in the min:\n\nsince i is 0 (first element), min is ar[i+1] - ar[i]. But ar[i+1] is ar[1], which is beyond the array which has a length of 1 (indexes 0). That's an error. Wait wait the Java code would have an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException here if n=1. Because when a=1, the array has length 1, so indices 0. For i=0, then i+1 = 1, which is out of bounds. So this Java code is incorrect for n=1? Hmm.\n\nWait but that seems like a mistake in the original code. Because if n is 1, the min calculation when i is the first element (i=0) would try to access ar[1], which is not present. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that n >= 2? Probably, since the problem statement for codeforces 567A may have constraints n >= 2? Wait let me check the problem (since maybe I should know that, but I'm reconstructing).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original java code has an error, but perhaps there's a mistake. Wait, assuming that the code is correct as given, then perhaps in the fortan translation, I need to consider that. \n\nBut according to the code as written, when n is 1, the min calculation fails. However, that's a problem in the original code. Since the user has provided the Java code, perhaps I can proceed to convert it as is, without fixing that logic.\n\nSo in the Fortran code, when n is 1, then the same logic would be applying. So when i=1, the code checks if i==1 (i== first element), then computes min_val as ar(2) - ar(1), but ar(2) is out of bounds since array length is 1. Thus, the Fortran code would also crash in that case. \n\nPerhaps the problem expects n >= 2, so the code is correct given the problem constraints. So assuming that's the case, maybe we can proceed. \n\nOther edge cases: when n=2.\n\nTake n=2. First element is ar(1), second ar(2).\n\nFirst iteration (i=1):\n\nmax is (ar(1) - ar(1), ar(2) - ar(1)) \u2192 max(0, (ar(2)-ar(1))). So the first component is max(ar(2) -ar(1) )\n\nWait no, max is between (ar(1)- ar(1) and ar(n) - ar(1) \u2192 so when n=2, ar(2) - ar(1). So the max is that, the second term is bigger.\n\nFor min, i=1 (first element) \u2192 min is ar(2) - ar(1)\n\nSecond iteration (i=2):\n\nmax is (ar(2) -ar(1), ar(2) -ar(2) \u2192 max between (ar(2)-ar(1)) and 0 \u2192 so first term again.\n\nMin is ar(2) - ar(1) (since i is last element (2 =n), so min_val is ar(2) - ar(1).\n\nSo that works. \n\nBut anyway, assuming that the original code is correct within the context of its problem, I'll proceed.\n\nNow, looking again at the variables. The code declares max and min as 0 initially. But in the Java version, in each iteration, they are re-assigned. So in the Fortran code, the variables max_val and min_val can be declared as integers.\n\nWait, also, in FORTRAN variables need to be declared before use. So in the current code I have the variables declared correctly before the loop.\n\nTesting variable scoping: the loop on i, with all else variables are local to the subroutine (since it's a program).\n\nWait, another thing: the Math.max and Math.min in java return the maximum of their two arguments, same as Fortran's max and min functions. So Fortran's intrinsic functions do that. The functions can be used directly because we can pass two arguments. \n\nAnother thing: The original code uses variables named max and min. But in FORTRAN, are those reserved words? 'max' is not the name of any Fortran function, but 'min' is, but I am using min_val instead so that's okay.\n\nWait, the code above uses 'max' as a function. For example, max(a,b) is acceptable in Fortran?\n\nYes, in ISO Fortran 90 and later, the intrinsic functions MAX and MIN can take two arguments. \n\nWait, the Fortran MAX function can be used as:\n\nmax_val = max( (ar(i) - ar(1)), (ar(n) - ar(i)) )\n\nYes, and similarly for min function.\n\nSo that code should be okay.\n\nNow, formatting the output. Java outputs min followed by max, separated by space, and each pair on its own line. The Fortran print*, statement should do that as well, since it's a list of two integers. The * in the print statement will format as many items as needed. \n\nTesting the syntax:\n\nAlso, when I wrote 'print *, min_val, max_val' or 'print*, min_val, max_val', either is okay.\n\nNow, is the array allocation necessary? The code is using an allocatable array, which is required since the size is determined at run-time.\n\nThus, the code should be correct as I've written.\n\nWait but let me write the code properly.\n\nWait in the Fortran code, I have to make sure that in the read statement, when we read the array elements, all are read in one line.\n\nYes. The read(*,*) (ar(i), i=1,n) will read n integers from the next line, which is as in Java's code where the second line of input contains the array elements separated by spaces.\n\nSo that is okay.\n\nThe only possible issue is with the index in the min calculation for i=1, but that's same as the original code.\n\nThus, the Fortran translation should be:\n\nHere's the code:\n\nprogram codeforces567a\n\n  implicit none\n\n  integer :: n, i, max_val, min_val\n\n  integer, allocatable :: ar(:)\n\n  read(*,*) n\n\n  allocate(ar(n))\n\n  read(*,*) (ar(i), i=1, n)\n\n  do i = 1, n\n\n    max_val = max(ar(i) - ar(1), ar(n) - ar(i))\n\n    if (i == 1) then\n        min_val = ar(i + 1) - ar(i)\n    else if (i == n) then\n        min_val = ar(i) - ar(i - 1)\n    else\n        min_val = min(ar(i) - ar(i - 1), ar(i + 1) - ar(i))\n    end if\n\n    print *, min_val, max_val\n\n  end do\n\n  deallocate(ar)\n\nend program codeforces567a\n\nWait, adding spaces in formatting for readability but that's okay.\n\nTesting this code for a sample case.\n\nSuppose input is:\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\nThen for each index 1, 2, 3.\n\nFirst i=1:\n\nmax is max( (1-1)=0 , (3-1)=2 \u2192 max is 2).\n\nmin is ar[2]-ar[1] =1 \u2192 min=1.\n\nSo output: 1 2.\n\nSecond iteration i=2:\n\nmax is (2-1)=1 vs (3-2)=1 \u2192 max is 1.\n\nmin is min(2-1=1, 3-2=1 \u21921. So output \u201c1 1\u201d\n\nThird iteration (i=3):\n\nmax is (3-1=2 and 3-3=0 \u2192 2. \n\nmin is 3-2=1 \u2192 so output 1 2.\n\nSo the three outputs would be:\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 \n\n1 2\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2:\n\ninput: 2, elements 5 and 10.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nmax is max(5-5=0 vs 10-5=5 \u21925.\n\nmin is 10-5=5 \u2192 output 5 5.\n\ni=2:\n\nmax is 10-5=5 (from first) and 0 \u2192 5.\n\nmin: 10-5 (since it's last element. so 5. Output 5 5.\n\nSo outputs 5 5 twice.\n\nThus the code works here.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Input is 5.\n\nThen code tries to read 5 elements but on the second line, only 5 is present. Then in the loop for i=1, the first condition (i==1) triggers, and the code tries to compute ar(2) - ar(1). But ar(2) is out of bounds. So the program will crash. Which is same as Java. Since problem may not have n=1, but assuming that the code is as per user's provided code, it's okay.\n\nThus this should be the correct translation."
