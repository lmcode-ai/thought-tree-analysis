Original code steps:\n\nK =7 \u2192 not divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 okay. Check 7 mod7 ==0 \u2192 yes, so we divide by7 \u2192 temp_K =1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 temp becomes 9. Now, remainder starts at 10 mod9 \u2192 mod(10,9)=1. Then since remainder is 1, the loop does not run. The ans is 1. So solve returns 1. So input 7 \u2192 output 1.\n\nWhich seems correct, because 7 divides 7 (1 digit). So it's right. Another example, K= 3 (assuming 3 is not divisible by 2 or5. Wait: Let's say K= 3: since not divisible by 7, we don't divide by7. Then temp_K is 3*9=27. Then remainder starts as 10 mod27 \u219210. Then entering loop:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nremainder is 10 \u2192 ! =1 \u2192 loop:\n\nans=2, remainder = (10*10) mod27 \u2192 100 mod27: 27*3=81 \u2192 100-81=19 \u2192 remainder19. Still not 1.\n\nans 3, remainder 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27: 27*7= 189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 loop ends. Wait, let me recalculate:\n\nstep1: remainder=10 \u2192 ans=1 (initial)\n\nthen loop continues. iteration 1 (ans becomes 2):\n\nnew remainder = (10 *10 ) mod27 \u2192 100 mod27. 27*3=81 \u2192 100-81=19 \u2192 19.\n\nthen ans=2. Then remainder 19 \u2192 check again ! =1, so proceed. ans becomes3, remainder is 19*10=190 mod27. 190/27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 190 mod27 is 1. Now remainder equals1. Exit loop \u2192 ans is3. So solve returns 3. So the minimal n is3. Because 777 ( three 7s) \u2192 777 mod3 is 777/3 = 259 \u2192 so divisible. Indeed, 3 divides 777. So the code works here, and the Fortran version should also.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to translate the given Java code into Fortran. Let's start by understanding what the Java code does step by step. The problem it's solving seems to be about finding the minimal number of digits such that the number composed of all 7s is divisible by K. But maybe I should focus on the code structure first.\n\nThe Java code reads an integer K from input. Then there are some checks: if K is even or divisible by 5, return -1 immediately. Then if K is divisible by 7, it divides it by 7. Then multiplies by 9? Wait no, after K /= 7, K becomes K divided by 7, then it's multiplied by 9? Hmm, maybe that step is part of the setup. The solve() method does that, and then proceeds to compute the minimal n such that 10^n mod (K*9?)... Wait, let me really parse the code.\n\nLooking at the solve() function:\n\nint K = readInt();\nif (K%2 == 0 || K%5 ==0 ) return -1;\nif (K%7 ==0) K= K/7;\nK *=9;\nThen, ans is 1, remainder is 10%K, then there's a loop where remainder = remainder *10 mod K until remainder is 1. The ans increments each time until the remainder becomes 1. So the actual calculation is finding the smallest n where (10^n -10^0)/9 or something? Wait, perhaps it's looking for the smallest n where 10^{n} \u2261 1 mod (K). Because in the loop: initialize ans as 1, remainder is 10 mod K. Then, while remainder !=1, multiply remainder by 10 mod K each step. Wait, remainder starts at 10 mod K. So the loop is continuing until remainder^pow equals 1 mod K? Hmm, so the code is trying to find the multiplicative order of 10 modulo K. However, the steps before adjusting K might complicate that. Let me think.\n\nWait, after the first steps, K first is divided by 7 if it's a multiple. Then they multiply by 9? Or maybe I got the steps wrong. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nOriginal K (input) is stored in K. If it's divisible by 2 or 5, return -1. Then check if divisible by 7: if yes, divide K by 7. Then multiply K by 9.\n\nWait, why? Because the problem is to find the minimal length of a number made of all 7's divisible by K. The code seems to manipulate K somehow into another value. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the number is 77...7 (n digits). Then 77...7 = 7*(10^{n}-1)/9. So to have this divisible by K, which is not divisible by 2 or 5, so 2 and 5 are factors already taken care of? Since if K has 2/5, the answer would be impossible, so return -1. So when K is not divisible by 2 or 5, then to have 7*( (10^n-1)/9 ) divisible by K. Let's factor that: needs (10^n -1)/9 divisible by K/(gcd(7, K)). Hmm maybe that's the reasoning. Alternatively, the code is making some transformations to represent the division by 7, perhaps? \n\nBut regardless, the code's structure is to return -1 if there are 2 or 5 factors. Then it divides by 7 once if possible, and then multiplies by 9, then proceeds to find the order of 10 modulo the resulting K.\n\nHmm, perhaps the algorithm is essentially computing the minimal n such that 7 * (10^n - 1)/9 mod K == 0. Let me see.\n\nMultiply both sides by 9: 7*(10^n - 1) mod (9*K) must be 0? Not sure. Alternatively, after dividing K by 7 (once, but perhaps only once because K can have multiple 7 factors?), but the code only divides once if divisible by 7, but then why multiply by 9?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to set a modified K', defined as:\n\nFirst, if K is divisible by 2 or 5, return -1.\n\nThen, K becomes K divided by 7 if it's divisible by 7 (so remove one 7?)\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the constructed number must consist entirely of 7s, so each digit is 7. The minimal n where 77...7(n times) is divisible by K. Since 7 and K: since K may have factors of 7, but then we need that 7 divides the number, so we can have that. But the approach in code seems to adjust K by dividing by 7 once, perhaps because the first digit can account for the factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code expects that after dividing K by 7 (if divisible), then multiply by 9, so K is of a certain form. So the K after step is being turned into 9*(K divided by 7)? Then the problem reduces to finding the order of 10 modulo that K' = 9*(K/7), but let's not get bogged down here. Since the code is given and correct, I have to just translate it to Fortran.\n\nNow, translating the code's structure:\n\nFirst, the Java code reads an integer K via readInt() method that uses Buffered reader and StringTokenizer. The Fortran program will need to read that input from standard input. So in Fortran, the read statement is straightforward.\n\nNow, the main function structure. The Java translation needs to be rethought in Fortran, which typically doesn't have classes, so the code must be a standalone program.\n\nThe solve function is called, which returns an integer. The main program would read K, call solve, print the result, then close.\n\nBut in Fortran, each procedure is a subroutine or function. Let me consider the functions involved.\n\nFirst, the code reads K via the readInt() function which uses some tokenized input. The Java method is handling input by reading lines and splitting on whitespace.\n\nIn Fortran, it's easier to read from standard input with read(*,*) or equivalent, line by line. Perhaps in this problem, the input is a single integer, so the tokenizer in the original code might not be necessary. Wait: the original Java code reads K via the readInt() method, which uses the buffered reader but splits into tokens. The readInt() function reads multiple tokens: the StringTokenizer reads each line, so the user may have multiple inputs on a single line or multiple lines, but for this problem, according to the problem statement, it's a single integer. So the Fortran code will read the first (and only) integer from input. So the readInt() method can be replaced by a straightforward read in Fortran.\n\nThus, the solve function in Fortran can be a function that takes an integer K, and returns an integer.\n\nLet's structure:\n\nWe'll write a Fortran program with a main program that reads K, calls solve, prints the result, then ends.\n\nFirst, the main:\n\nprogram main\n  implicit none\n  integer :: K, ans\n  read(*,*) K\n  ans = solve(K)\n  print*, ans\nend program\n\nBut need to define the solve function as a function.\n\nNow, looking at the solve function.\n\nThe solve logic:\n\nFunction solve(K) result (res)\ninteger, intent(in) :: K\ninteger :: res\n\nFirst check if K mod 2 ==0 OR K mod5 ==0: then return -1.\n\nif ( mod(K, 2) == 0 ) then\n   res = -1\n   return\nelseif ( mod(K,5) ==0 ) then\n   res = -1\n   return\nend if\n\nWait, better: if mod(K,2) ==0 .OR. mod(K,5)==0 \u2192 then return -1.\n\nThen:\n\nif ( mod(K,7) ==0 ) then\n   K = K/7\nendif\n\nWait, but in Java code: if K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K is divided by7, then K gets multiplied by 9 (so K *=9 \u2192 K becomes (K/7)*9 ?). Wait in the code:\n\noriginal steps:\n\nif ( ( K %2 ==0) || (K%5 ==0) ) \u2192 return -1.\n\nCheck K mod7 ==0 \u2192 K divided by7.\n\nThen K *=9;\n\nSo after that K is original K divided by7, multiplied by9.\n\nWait, that's:\n\nK in the code is first adjusted by dividing by7, then multiplied by9, so newK is ( (K /7)*9 ) if divisible by7; else, new K is K *9.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nAfter the first condition (on 2 and 5):\n\nif (K %7 ==0) then K = K//7 (integer division in Fortran). Then K = K *9.\n\nIn Fortran code variables are changeable within the function, but the input is passed as intent(in), but since the function will modify K, perhaps need local variables.\n\nWait, in the function, the K is passed as an argument, so it's best to make a local variable.\n\nWait, better approach in Fortran:\n\nwithin the function:\n\ninside the function:\n\ninteger, intent(in) :: K\n\nWait but in the solve function, the code modifies K (the original K is input, but we need to work on it, so better to copy into a temp variable.)\n\nWait, for example:\n\nInside solve:\n\ninteger:: temp_K\ntemp_K = K\n\nthen, apply the checks:\n\nif ( temp_K mod 2 ==0 or mod5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen check if modulo7 \u2192 temp_K/7?\n\nthen multiply by9.\n\nContinue with calculations.\n\nYes. Let's write step by step:\n\ninteger function solve(K)\n  integer, intent(in) :: K\n  integer:: temp_K, ans, remainder\n\n  temp_K = K\n  if ( mod(temp_K, 2) ==0 .or. mod(temp_K,5) ==0 ) then\n     solve = -1\n     return\n  end if\n\n  if ( mod(temp_K,7) ==0 ) then\n     temp_K = temp_K/7\n  end if\n  temp_K = temp_K *9 ! multiply by9.\n\n  ans =1\n  remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n  do while ( remainder /= 1 )\n    ans = ans +1\n    remainder = mod( remainder *10, temp_K )\n  end do\n\n  solve = ans\nend function\n\nWait, that seems to be the core logic. Let's check loop: initial remainder is 10 mod temp_K. Because in the original code, remainder is 10%K (i.e., mod K). So we compute 10 mod temp_K (since temp_K is already multiplied by9 and so on).\n\nWait, original java code after modifying K to K*9, then sets remainder = 10 mod K (now K*9? Because the code after K *=9 becomes K = new value. So yes, the remainder is 10 mod temp_K (which is K *9 now).\n\nThen, the loop:\n\nWhile remainder !=1:\n\nans increases each time.\n\nEach step, remainder is updated to (remainder *10) mod temp_K.\n\nThe loop continues until the remainder becomes 1.\n\nThus, the function is supposed to return the minimal ans (power?) such that 10^ans \u2261 1 mod temp_K.\n\nWait, but starting from initial remainder=10 mod temp_K, which is 10^1 mod temp_K. Then, the loop steps:\n\nafter first iteration:\n\nIf after first step (ans=1), remainder is 10^1 mod temp_K.\n\nnext step, multiply by 10 \u2192 10^2 mod temp_K. So we're seeking the smallest exponent n where 10^n mod temp_K = 1, but starting from the first (ans=1, which is exponent=1 term?), but in the loop:\n\nWait the loop condition is while remainder !=1. The loop starts with initial remainder =10 mod temp_K (which is 10^1 mod temp).\n\nWait, the loop checks whether remainder is 1, so step by step:\n\nInitially ans is 1, remainder is 10^1 mod temp.\n\nThe loop : while remainder not equals to 1 \u2192 so it seeks to find when the remainder is one. \n\nWait, for example: if temp_K divides 10^ans -1 \u2192 10^ans \u22611 mod temp_K.\n\nWait, but:\n\nSuppose temp_K divides (10^ans -1) \u2192 then 10^ans \u2261 1 mod temp_K \u2192 remainder is 1 mod temp.\n\nWe need to find minimal such ans.\n\nYes. The loop computes that minimal exponent.\n\nNow, in Fortran, the 'mod' function is remainder, but in Fortran, mod(a,b) is the remainder with the same sign as b. However, in Java's % operator, if the dividend is negative, it's different. But here, since inputs are positive, temp_K is positive, and all variables (remainder, etc) stay positive.\n\nSo mod function should be safe here.\n\nNow, but in Fortran, the mod(10, temp_K) is indeed 10 mod temp_K.\n\nTesting edge cases: Let me check an example where K is 7 (from ABC174 problem). Let's see:\n\nIn the problem description for problem C of ABC174 is called \"755\", but the actual code here might correspond to problem ABC174 C (which is \"Apple Mammy\").\n\nWait, the problem details might not be necessary here, as I have the code.\n\nTesting: if input is 7.\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\nK =7 \u2192 not divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 okay.\n\nCheck 7 mod7 ==0 \u2192 yes, so we divide by7 \u2192 temp_K =1. Then multiply by9 \u2192 temp becomes 9.\n\nNow, remainder starts at 10 mod9 \u2192 mod(10,9)=1.\n\nThen since remainder is 1, the loop does not run. The ans is 1. So solve returns 1. So input 7 \u2192 output 1.\n\nWhich seems correct, because 7 divides 7 (1 digit). So it's right.\n\nAnother example, K= 3 (assuming 3 is not divisible by 2 or5.\n\nWait: Let's say K= 3: since not divisible by 7, we don't divide by7. Then temp_K is 3*9=27.\n\nThen remainder starts as 10 mod27 \u219210. Then entering loop:\n\nans starts at 1.\n\nremainder is 10 \u2192 !=1 \u2192 loop:\n\nans=2, remainder = (10*10) mod27 \u2192 100 mod27: 27*3=81 \u2192 100-81=19 \u2192 remainder19. Still not 1.\n\nans 3, remainder 19*10 mod27 \u2192 190 mod27: 27*7= 189 \u2192 1 \u2192 remainder is 1 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nstep1: remainder=10 \u2192 ans=1 (initial)\n\nthen loop continues.\n\niteration 1 (ans becomes 2):\n\nnew remainder = (10 *10 ) mod27 \u2192 100 mod27.\n\n27*3=81 \u2192 100-81=19 \u2192 19.\n\nthen ans=2.\n\nThen remainder 19 \u2192 check again !=1, so proceed.\n\nans becomes3, remainder is 19*10=190 mod27.\n\n190/27 \u2192 27*7=189 \u2192 190 mod27 is 1.\n\nNow remainder equals1. Exit loop \u2192 ans is3. So solve returns 3. So the minimal n is3. Because 777 ( three 7s) \u2192 777 mod3 is 777/3 = 259 \u2192 so divisible. Indeed, 3 divides 777.\n\nSo the code works here, and the Fortran version should also.\n\nNow, in coding:\n\nVariables and functions in Fortran need to be correctly defined. \n\nNow, translating the function:\n\nNow, putting this together into a complete program.\n\nFirst, the program structure:\n\nprogram main\n\nimplicit none\ninteger :: K, result\n\nread(*,*) K\nresult = solve(K)\nwrite(*,*) result\n\ncontains\n  FUNCTION solve(K) result (ans_out)\n    integer, intent(in) :: K\n    integer :: temp_K, ans, remainder, ans_out\n\n    temp_K = K\n    if (mod(temp_K, 2) == 0 .or. mod(temp_K,5) ==0) then\n      ans_out = -1\n      return\n    end if\n\n    if (mod(temp_K,7) ==0) then\n      temp_K = temp_K /7\n    end if\n    temp_K = temp_K *9  ! multiply by 9\n\n    ans =1\n    remainder = mod(10, temp_K)  !10 mod temp_K\n    do while (remainder /=1 )\n      ans = ans +1  \n      remainder = mod( remainder *10, temp_K )\n    end do\n    ans_out = ans\n  ENDFUNCTION solve\n\nend program\n\nWait, but in the function, the 'contains' block is inside the main program. The FUNCTION must be declared within the main program's contains block.\n\nAlso, variable types: in the function, the 'ans_out' is the function's return value. So the function returns ans.\n\nWait, Let me check:\n\nThe function 'solve' has to return an integer. The variable 'ans_out' is set to -1 in the conditions, otherwise, after computation, 'ans_out = ans'. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut also, in the case where temp_K*9 is zero? But because the first condition ensures K is not divisible by 2/5. And after division by7 (if needed), K is at least 1 (assuming original K is positive). Since the input K is from user, but likely a positive integer. Thus, temp_K*9 will be positive.\n\nAnother possible issue: when temp_K is 1, then mod(10,1) is 0. Wait wait:\n\nWait, let's take K=7. Then:\n\ntemp_K starts as K=7 \u2192 okay.\n\nSince divisible by7 \u2192 temp becomes 1, multiply by9 \u2192 temp_K=9.\n\nThen remainder = mod(10,9) \u2192 10 mod9 is 1 \u2192 so answer 1.\n\nAnother test: K=1:\n\nInput 1 \u2192 K=1 is not divisible by 2/5. Check if divisible by7? No (since 1 mod7=1\u22600). So temp_K remains 1. Then temp_K *=9 \u2192 becomes 9. Then remainder = mod(10,9) =1. So the ans is 1. Which would mean the number 7 is divisible by 1 \u2192 yes, so correct.\n\nBut what if K=9:\n\nWait, original K is 9 (divisible by 3). So let's see:\n\nIs 9 divisible by 2 or 5 \u2192 no. So proceed.\n\nIs divisible by7? No, so temp remains 9 \u2192 multiply by9 \u2192 temp becomes 81.\n\nWe need to compute the minimal n such that 10^n mod81 =1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nLooking for n where 10^n \u22611 mod81.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nmod(10,81)=10 \u2192 ans starts at1.\n\n10^1 mod81=10 mod81 \u2192 10 not 1.\n\nans increments to 2: 10*10 mod81 \u2192 100 mod81=19.\n\nthen ans 3: 19*10=190 \u2192 mod81: 190-2*81=190-162=28.\n\nans=3 \u2192 rem=28.\n\nans=4 \u2192 28*10=280 \u2192 mod81: 81*3=243 \u2192280-243=37.\n\nans=4: 37 mod81 is 37.\n\nans=5: 37*10=370 \u2192 mod81: 81*4=324 \u2192 370-324 =46 mod81.\n\nans=5, rem46.\n\nans=6 \u2192460 mod81: 81*5=405 \u2192460-405=55 \u2192 rem55.\n\nans6\u219255.\n\nans7:550 mod81. 81*6=486. 550-486=64. rem64.\n\nans7:64.\n\nans8: 64*10=640 mod81. 81*7 =567 \u2192 640-567=73 \u2192 rem73.\n\nans8\u219273.\n\nans9: 73*10=730 mod81: 81*9=729 \u2192 remainder 1.\n\nWait, 730-729=1 \u2192 yes. So when ans becomes 9, remainder is 1\u2192 loop ends. Thus, ans is9.\n\nThus the code would return9 for K=9 \u2192 which would correspond to an answer where the number made of 9 7's \"777777777\" (9 digits) is divisible by K=9 (yes, since sum is 9*7=63 divisible by9, but also the code's logic here. So for K=9, the code returns9?\n\nWait, yes. But what's the minimal n? Let me see:\n\nLet me see for temp_K=81.\n\n10^n mod81 =1:\n\nAt n=9, that's 10^9 mod81.\n\nWait, but let me calculate 10^9 mod81.\n\nAlternatively, note that 10^ phi(81) mod81=1, where phi is Euler's totient function.\n\nSince 81 is 3^4, phi(81) = 81*(1-1/3)=54. So 10^54 mod81 is1. But perhaps the order is less.\n\nIn our example above, the minimal n is9 \u2192 so 10^9 mod81=1, as per calculation.\n\nHence the code would return9. So for K=9, which can be input, the code returns9. That would be correct.\n\nSo our Fortran code seems to be correctly translating the algorithm.\n\nNow, code specifics:\n\nIn the solve function, after setting temp_k to K, the first check is if temp is divisible by2 or5 \u2192 return -1.\n\nThen if divisible by7 \u2192 divide by7.\n\nMultiply by9.\n\nThen, the loop.\n\nNow, in Fortran function definitions are enclosed in a block, and the code must have correct variable declarations.\n\nIn the code I wrote above, the solve function is declared as having intent(in) K, and the variables temp_K, ans, remainder are declared as integers. The return value is via ans_out.\n\nAnother thing to check: in Fortran, the / operator for integers may give the integer division (floor division) as expected. Since in the condition mod(K,7) ==0 \u2192 temp_K = temp_K/7.\n\nYes, if temp_K is divisible by 7, integer division of temp_K/7 will be clean. So that would work.\n\nIn the initialization of remainder:\n\nRemainder is set to mod(10, temp_K). Now, if temp_K is 1, mod(10,1) is0. Then the loop condition is remainder /=1 \u2192 0 /=1 \u2192 true. Then ans increments to2, and remainder = mod(0 *10, 1) \u2192 mod(0,1)=0. So the loop continues forever? Wait wait that's a problem.\n\nWait in the case temp_K is 1 (for example, when K is7, after K is divided by7 and multiplied by9 \u2192 temp becomes (7/7)*9=9. So temp is9, and when K was 7 \u2192 if K was 1?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where temp_K is 1.\n\nWait, let me see what input would make temp_K=1:\n\nSuppose K= (7*1/9) but no, since original K is integer. So when K=7, the code after dividing by7 (K becomes1), multiplied by9 \u2192 9, which does not result in temp_K being1. To have temp_K=1, the only way is:\n\nOriginal K is 7*1 (K=7), then divided by7 \u2192 1 \u2192 then multiplied by9 \u2192 9. So not 1.\n\nBut suppose K=7* (something that after division and multiplying by 9, gives 7/7 =1, but then *9=9. So temp_K is 9, not 1.\n\nTo get temp_k to be 1: Suppose k is 7 * ... so after dividing by7, gets x, which then x*9 is 1 \u2192 impossible because 7/7*9 is9, so to get x such that x*9 =1 \u2192 x must be 1/9, but since x must be integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe temp_k can be 1 only if initial K is divided7 and the division is by7 (K originally was7), then temp divided by7 gives 1 \u2192 temp after divide by7 \u21921. Then multiply by9 \u21929.\n\nWait, so perhaps temp can never be1 here unless we have a temp_K=1. How?\n\nLet me see: Suppose K=7, and the code is:\n\nOriginal K=7 \u2192 check if divisible by2 or5 \u2192 no.\n\nCheck divisible by7 \u2192 yes, so divide by7 \u2192 temp becomes 1. Multiply by9 \u21929.\n\nSo temp_K is9 \u2192 thus the remainder is mod(10,9)=1, so loop does not run, ans is1. So correct.\n\nWait, what if temp_K is 1?\n\nExample: K is 7/7 (because modified from original input? Wait the original input must be 7, but then temp after dividing by7 gives 1? Then multiply by9: 9, not1.\n\nHmm, maybe it's impossible to have temp_K be 1 unless temp is 1/9 which can't happen because temp is an integer.\n\nWait, let's suppose the user inputs K= 7:\n\nOriginal K is7 \u2192 through code steps \u2192 temp_k is9 \u2192 remainder 1 \u2192 so ok.\n\nAnother example, K= 21 \u2192 divisible by 7 \u2192 divisible by7, so temp_K becomes3, multiplied by9 \u2192 27.\n\nNow, remainder is 10 mod27 \u219210, then the loop steps until 1.\n\nWait what about K= (7 \u00d7 7) \u2192 K=49. Then divided by7 once \u2192 becomes7, then multiplied \u00d79 \u219263. \n\nThe code would proceed with temp_K=63.\n\nSo code should handle correctly.\n\nThus, the possible problematic temp_K is when temp_K is 1? Let me imagine someone input a K where temp_K could be 1:\n\nSuppose, suppose original K starts as7*(something, after division it is1 divided by?, maybe not)\n\nWait original K = 7/(7) \u2192 K was7. Then divided by7 \u2192 gives1, multiplied by9 gives9.\n\nThus, temp cannot be 1 unless temp is afterdivision has x and x*9=1 \u2192 then x is 1/9 \u2192 which isn't possible.\n\nSo the only case when temp is1 is if 9*x =1 and x was the K divided by7, but that requires x = 1/9 \u2192 not integer, so not possible. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code's loop conditions are fine.\n\nNow, the code in Fortran written above should be correct.\n\nNow, let me write it properly formatted:\n\nFirst, the program:\n\nThe main program reads K, calls the function solve(K), then outputs the result.\n\nWithin the contains block, the solve function is defined.\n\nThe variables inside solve are correctly declared.\n\nThus, putting it all together.\n\nAnother note: In Fortran, functions can be placed inside the main program in a \"contains\" section.\n\nTesting: writing the function correctly.\n\nIn code:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc174_c\n  implicit none\n  integer :: K, ans\n\n  read(*, *) K\n  ans = solve(K)\n  print *, ans\ncontains\n  integer function solve(K)\n    implicit none\n    integer, intent(in) :: K\n    integer :: temp_K, remainder, temp_ans\n\n    temp_K = K\n    ! Check if divisible by 2 or 5\n    if (mod(temp_K, 2) == 0 .or. mod(temp_K, 5) == 0) then\n      solve = -1\n      return\n    end if\n\n    ! Check divisibility by 7\n    if (mod(temp_K, 7) == 0) then\n      temp_K = temp_K / 7\n    end if\n    temp_K = temp_K * 9\n\n    temp_ans = 1\n    remainder = mod(10, temp_K)\n\n    do while (remainder /= 1)\n      temp_ans = temp_ans + 1\n      remainder = mod(remainder * 10, temp_K)\n    end do\n\n    solve = temp_ans\n  end function solve\nend program atcoder_abc174_c\n\nThis should be the complete Fortran code.\n\nWait in the above code, 'temp_ans' and 'remainder' are declared as integers in the solve function.\n\nYes, and 'temp_K' is also declared. Since the function has its own declarations.\n\nTesting some examples:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:7 \u2192 expected output 1.\n\nThe code:\n\ntemp_K starts as7 \u2192 no divisible by2/5 \u2192 good.\n\ndivisible by7 \u2192 temp_becomes1 \u2192 *9 =9. \n\nThen remainder= mod(10,9) is1 \u2192 loop does not run \u2192 temp_ans=1. So correct.\n\nTest case2:\n\ninput3 (then function processing: temp_K is 3, no division, *9 \u2192 27. Middle steps go to ans3. Which is correct.)\n\nTest case K=9:\n\ntemp_K after division steps (not divisible by7 \u2192 remains9 \u2192 *9 \u2192 81 \u2192 loop gives 9.\n\nSo all looks good.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nInput K=1 \u2192 should return 1? Let's see.\n\nK=1 \u2192 not divisible by 2/5. Not divisible by7, so temp_K *9 is9.\n\nremainder=mod(10,9)=1 \u2192 ans is1. Yes. Which is correct since 7 is divisible by1.\n\nAnother case: K=7 \u2192 gives1.\n\nNow, when K has factors such as 2:\n\nInput K=2 \u2192 code returns -1 \u2192 correct.\n\nInput K=5 \u2192 returns-1.\n\nK=7 again, which works.\n\nWhat about K= 7*2 \u2192 K=14? \u2192 divisible by2 \u2192 return-1.\n\nThus, the code correctly implements the condition.\n\nThus, this should be correct."
