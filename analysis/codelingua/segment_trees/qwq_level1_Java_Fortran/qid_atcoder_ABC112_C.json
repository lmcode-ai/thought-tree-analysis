The program is solving a problem where we have N points with x, y coordinates and a height h. The goal is to find the center (cx, cy) of a tower such that for each point, the height h[i] is equal to the maximum of (original tower height minus distance from (cx, cy) plus the tower's initial h, or zero). \n\nThe Java code loops through all possible cx and cy values from 0 to 100 (since MAX is 100), and for each pair, it checks if there's a consistent height that fits all the points. The check function computes the necessary tower height and verifies if all points satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, translating this to Fortran. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the main structure. In Fortran, we typically use modules and subroutines. Since it's a simple program, maybe just a main program. The MAX constant is 100, so define it as a parameter.\n\nThe input handling in Java uses a Scanner. In Fortran, we'll read from stdin, probably using a read statement. Java uses arrays, so Fortran needs arrays as well. Since N is given first, we need to read it first, then allocate arrays dynamically. Wait, Fortran has fixed-size arrays unless using allocatable arrays. Oh right, from Fortran 90 onwards, we can have allocatable arrays. So declare x, y, h as integers, dimension(:), allocatable.\n\nThe loop over the input lines: for each i from 0 to n-1 in Java. In Fortran, arrays start at 1 by default, but we can set the lower bound. Wait, maybe better to make them 0-based? But Fortran is 1-based unless specified. To be consistent with the Java code, perhaps the arrays should be 1-based? Or not, since the indices in Java start at 0. Well, in Fortran, it's easier to use 1-based. Wait, but the code uses IntStream.range(0, n), so indexes from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, we can make the arrays 0-based by specifying the lower bound. For example, dimension(0:n-1).\n\nWait, but in Fortran, when allocating arrays, the lower bound can be set. So maybe declare arrays as 0 to n-1? Let me see. Alternatively, just use 1-based and adjust indices accordingly. Hmm, perhaps better to handle the index difference as needed.\n\nOkay, handling the input loop:\n\nIn Java, there are loops over i from 0 to n-1, reading x[i], y[i], h[i].\n\nIn Fortran, after input n:\n\nallocate( x(n), y(n), h(n) )\n\nthen read loop over i=1 to n, reading each line.\n\nWait, but the input lines after n would be n lines with three integers each. So in Fortran, after reading n, loop n times, reading each x(i), y(i), h(i).\n\nNow the main loop: for each i (cx) from 0 to MAX (Java has MAX=100). So cx ranges from 0 to 100 inclusive. Similarly cy.\n\nWait the Java code loops for (int i=0; i <= MAX; ...), so that's 101 values (0 to 100). In Fortran, we can loop from 0 to 100 with a do loop.\n\nThen inside, for each cx and cy, call the check function, which returns ch. If ch is positive, output i, j, ch (i and j here are the cx and cy variables).\n\nThe check function is more complex. Let me look at the Java function check.\n\nThe check function takes n, x, y, h arrays, and cx, cy. It returns an integer ch.\n\nIn the first loop, it loops over the points, and for the first one with h[i]>0 (since if h[i] is zero, perhaps it can be ignored?), computes ch as the distance between (x[i], y[i]) and (cx, cy), then adds h[i], so ch is that distance + h[i]. Then breaks after the first h[i]>0.\n\nWait, that's the initial computation. The idea here is that the tower's height at the center is such that the height of the point with non-zero h is calculated from the maximum between (original tower height - distance + h[i], or zero). Wait, maybe the tower's height 'ch' is the height at the center. So for any point with h[i]>0, the height h[i] must be equal to (ch - distance between point and center) but if that would be less than zero, it's zero. So the original tower's height at center must be exactly distance_plus_h[i] for that point.\n\nWait, in the first loop of check, they pick the first h[i]>0's point and set ch as |x[i] - cx| + |y[i] - cy| + h[i], since that is the required tower height: tower's height is at least the distance plus h, so when you subtract distance, you get h. So that's the initial guess for ch. However, then in the second loop, we verify all other points.\n\nAh, but this selection of the first point with h>0 might not work if there's multiple points with different h values. The code's logic first picks the first non-zero h's ch, then checks all points.\n\nWait, that's probably the way the problem is structured. Because, the tower's ch must satisfy for all points: h[i] = max( ch - |x - cx| - |y - cy| , 0 )\n\nTherefore, the first non-zero h point must have h = (ch - distance), which gives ch = h + distance, so that is how we compute ch.\n\nThen other points must satisfy h[i] = max( ch - distance, 0 ).\n\nSo the check function works by finding the ch from one point, then verifying others.\n\nNow in Fortran code:\n\nThe check function would need to be a function that returns an integer. Since Fortran functions can't have pass-by-reference like Java, but arrays are passed as arguments.\n\nNow in Fortran, functions can return an integer. So the function check would be defined, taking n, x, y, h, cx, cy as arguments.\n\nWait the arrays in Fortran: when passing arrays to a function, we need to pass the entire array? Or can specify the size. But since Arrays in Fortran can be passed with their size.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the function signature would be:\n\nFUNCTION check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) result(ch)\n\nwhere ch is the returned integer, and x, y, h are arrays of length n.\n\nWait need to make sure that in the function declarations, the array dimensions are specified properly.\n\nAnother thing is that in Fortran, we can't have local functions very easily in a program. So, maybe all functions have to be in the main program? Or better structure as a subroutine. Wait, but the user wants it translated properly.\n\nAlternatively, we can structure it as a program with a function and a main block.\n\nWait perhaps proceed as follows:\n\nDeclare variables:\n\nparameter (MAX = 100)\n\ninteger :: n, x(:), y(:), h(:), cx, cy, i, j, ch\n\nallocate arrays after reading n.\n\nWait code outline:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc112_c\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: MAX = 100\n\n   integer :: n, cx, cy, i, j, ch\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: x, y, h\n\n   ! Read n\n\n   read *,n\n\n   allocate(x(n), y(n), h(n))\n\n   ! Read the n lines\n\n   read *, ((x(i), y(i), h(i)), i = 1, n)\n\n   ! Or loop over each to read\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      read *, x(i), y(i), h(i)\n\n   end do\n\nWait, the read statement can be either way. Hmm. Wait, the input after n has n lines with three integers per line, so the second approach of looping is straightforward.\n\nThen, the loop over cx and cy:\n\n   do cx = 0, MAX\n\n      do cy = 0, MAX\n\n         call check_result(n, x, y, h, cx, cy, ch)\n\n         if (ch > 0) then\n\n            print *, cx, ' ', cy, ' ', ch\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\nWait, but need to have the check function as a function or subroutine.\n\nAlternatively, the function check can return the ch value. So, in Fortran:\n\nFUNCTION check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) result (result_ch)\n\n   integer :: n, cx, cy\n\n   integer, dimension(n) :: x, y, h\n\n   integer :: result_ch, i, current_h\n\n   result_ch = -1\n\n   ! First loop to find the ch\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      if (h(i) > 0) then\n\n         result_ch = abs(x(i) - cx) + abs(y(i) - cy) + h(i)\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\n   ! if no h is >0, then not possible? Not sure.\n\n   ! But for that case, but according to the problem statement, the tower exists.\n\n   ! Then, second loop to check all points.\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      current_h = max( result_ch - (abs(x(i) - cx) + abs(y(i) - cy)), 0 )\n\n      if (h(i) /= current_h) then\n\n         result_ch = -1\n\n         exit\n\n      end if\n\n   end do\n\nend FUNCTION check\n\nWait, that seems manageable.\n\nBut need to ensure that the function is declared properly. Also, the first loop is only executed if there is at least one h[i]>0. Otherwise, the check returns -1.\n\nWait, but in the first loop, if all h are zero, then the first h(i) >0 condition would never be met, so the do loop will not change result_ch from its initial -1. Then in the second loop, it will check, but since h(i) would all be zero, and current_h would be -1 - ... which might not hold.\n\nHmm. But according to the problem statement, there should be exactly one such solution, so maybe there is at least one h[i]>0 in the input.\n\nIn any case, the code works for such cases.\n\nNow, in the main program, when we compute ch via the check function. The fortran syntax.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut wait, in Fortran, functions must be declared in the program's scope before they are used. So perhaps place the function definition before the main code.\n\nAlternatively, at the end. In Fortran 90, functions can be at the end.\n\nAnother point: in Fortran, strings are written differently for print statements. The print *, followed by values. So in the print statement:\n\nprint *, cx, \" \", cy, \" \", ch\n\nWait, no, in Fortran to print a space between numbers, you might need to surround them with commas, and the print statement will separate them by spaces. Alternatively, use formatted output.\n\nBut in this case, the Java code outputs the three numbers separated by spaces. So using commas in the print * list will suffice.\n\nWait in Fortran:\n\nprint *, i, \" \", j, \" \", ch\n\nWait no, strings can be in quotes, but that will print the quotes. We need to print the values of cx, cy, ch, separated by spaces. The print *, list will automatically space them.\n\nWait, yes:\n\nprint *, cx, cy, ch\n\nWill print the three numbers separated by spaces, which matches the Java's output.\n\nSo the print statement in the Fortran can be written as:\n\nprint *, cx, cy, ch\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the check function. The initial loop looks for the first h(i) >0. However, in the Java code, the first loop is written as:\n\nfor (int i=0; ... ){\nif (h[i] >0){\n} break;\n}\n\nWait the Java code loops through IntStream.range(0, n), which is from 0 to n-1. So in Fortran, since arrays start at 1, we can just loop from 1 to n. The logic is same.\n\nWait, in the Java code:\n\nIn the initialization part for the arrays x, y, h, they read in the next inputs into x[i], y[i], h[i], where i ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn Fortran, the arrays x, y, h are 1-based, so i from 1 to n. But since the problem's input is per the problem, it shouldn't matter as long as all elements are read correctly.\n\nOK. Now, the check function's first loop:\n\ndo i = 1,n\n\n   if (h(i) .GT.0) then\n\n       result_ch=...\n\n      exit\n\n   end if\n\nend do\n\nNow, if none of the h(i) are positive, then the first loop won't set result_ch, leaving it at -1, and then the second loop will go through, but since h(i) is 0, and the current_h would be max( -1 - distance, 0 ), which is 0 if distance is larger, but then if the h(i) is 0, then comparison is okay? Not sure, but according to problem constraints, that case may not exist.\n\nMoving on.\n\nNow, in the Fortran code, we can structure it like this:\n\nprogram atcoder_abc112_c\n\n   implicit none\n\n   integer, parameter :: MAX = 100  ! 0-based in original?\n\n   integer :: n, cx, cy, i, j, ch\n\n   integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: x, y, h\n\n   ! Read n\n\n   read*, n\n\n   allocate( x(n), y(n), h(n) )\n\n   ! Read the n lines:\n\n   do i = 1, n\n\n      read*, x(i), y(i), h(i)\n\n   end do\n\n   ! loop over possible cx and cy from 0 to MAX inclusive (same as 0..100)\n\n   do cx=0, MAX\n\n      do cy=0, MAX\n\n         ch = check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy)\n\n         if (ch >0) then\n\n            print*, cx, cy, ch\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end do\n\ncontains\n\n   integer function check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) result(res)\n\n      integer, intent(in) :: n, cx, cy\n\n      integer, dimension(n), intent(in) :: x, y, h\n\n      integer :: i, current_h\n\n      res = -1\n\n      ! First loop to compute ch based on first non-zero h\n\n      do i=1, n\n\n         if (h(i) >0) then\n\n            res = abs( x(i) - cx ) + abs( y(i) - cy ) + h(i)\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n! Now, assuming that there is at least one h(i) >0\n\n      do i=1,n\n\n         current_h = max( res - ( abs(x(i)-cx) + abs(y(i)-cy) ), 0 )\n\n         if (h(i) .ne. current_h) then\n\n            res = -1\n\n            exit\n\n         end if\n\n      end do\n\n   end function\n\nend program atcoder_abc112_c\n\nWait, but let me check the Max function in Fortran. In the code:\n\ncurrent_h = max( res - (distance), 0 )\n\nYes, since in Fortran, max(a, 0) can be written as max(0,a) as well, but here we need the maximum between (res - ...) and zero.\n\nWait in the expression:\n\nres - (abs(x(i) - ...) ... so maybe:\n\ncurrent_h = max( res - ( abs(x(i) - cx) + abs(y(i)-cy) ), 0 )\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, the function declaration.\n\nWait, in check, the function's return value is res, which is an integer. So the function is correctly declared to return an integer, and the variables are defined with their intent.\n\nBut in Fortran, arrays passed as parameters to the function should be specified with their dimension, but in the function parameters, perhaps need to have the size.\n\nWait in the check function's parameters:\n\ninteger, dimension(n), intent(in) :: x, y, h\n\nBut n is also an input parameter. So the function needs to take n as an argument. So the function's parameter list should be (n, x, y, h, cx, cy).\n\nWait yes, in the function check:\n\ninteger function check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy) ... \n\nWith n as one of the arguments.\n\nWhich is exactly as shown.\n\nNow, the allocated arrays in Fortran: since the function is internal to the program and uses the same n, it can access the same variables, but in this case, the arrays passed as parameters to the function have to be dimensioned with the correct n.\n\nWait, no. The n here, passed as a parameter to the check function, is the variable n from the main program. But in Fortran, unless the function has a common block or something, but here we have to use the parameters properly.\n\nWait in the program, when we call check(n, x, y, h, cx, cy), then the n is passed, the x array has dimension (n). So in the function, the x,y,h arrays have dimension(n), and the n is part of the input, so the function's parameters are okay.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nWait but inside the function, the function can't tell the size of the arrays unless the parameter n is provided. So this is correct.\n\nNow, handling the loops correctly.\n\nAnother thing: The absolute value function in Fortran is ABS(), so that is correctly used in the code.\n\nNow, testing possible issues:\n\nWhat if in the function, during the first loop, there are no h(i) >0? Then res remains -1, and in the second loop, subtracting from that. But that would give a negative value inside the current_h calculation. For example, if res is still -1, and then:\n\ncurrent_h = max(-1 - distance, 0). This will be 0 only if distance is greater than -1. But distance is non-negative (absolute values, so all terms are non-negative, so the first term would be -1 - (something >=0) becomes -2, etc. But if all h are zero, the original problem requires that ch must be such that h[i] =0 for all, so the initial computation if all h are zero would leave res = -1, but then in the second loop:\n\ncurrent_h = max( -1 - distance,0 ), but for that h(i)=0, so:\n\nWe have (h(i) = 0) must equal current_h, which is max (res - distance, 0). So if res is -1, then res-distance is -1-distance <0, so current_h is zero. So for all h=0, as long as computed correctly? But how would the code find a valid ch.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem conditions are satisfied if ch can be anything, but the h's are zero for all. Then in that case, any cx, cy would suffice as long as the tower's height is less than the distance from any point plus zero, but since the h is zero, it can be either <= distance or not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, if all h are zero, then ch must be at least the distance from each point's center (since h[i] = max(ch - distance, 0) => for h zero, ch - distance must be less than or equal to 0, so ch <= distance for all points. But the required ch must be the same for all points.\n\nWait so if all h=0, then the tower's height at (cx, cy) must be less than the distance from every point. But the tower's ch is set initially as -1 (from no h>0), causing the function to find -1, so the ch returned is -1, which wouldn't be printed. Hmm but according to the problem statement, there must be exactly one solution. So the problem's inputs must have at least one point with h[i]>0, so perhaps those cases are already handled.\n\nThus the code is as above.\n\nWait, another possible issue:\n\nIn the check function, if the first non-zero h is picked, but another non-zero h does not match the resulting ch. The function then returns -1. So this is correct.\n\nSo the code seems okay.\n\nTesting edge cases.\n\nWait, in the Java code check's first part:\n\nIn the first loop, the for (i: IntStream...) is same as for each index from 0 to n-1.\n\ntranslating to Fortran loop from 1 to n.\n\nDoes that matter? Because in the Java arrays, x[0], y[0], etc are first elements, but in the Fortran, x(1) is the first element, but the problem is independent of the order because all points are considered. So as long as all elements are read correctly, it's okay.\n\nYes, the code should work.\n\nThus the Fortran code should be as written."
